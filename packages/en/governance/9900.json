Cook, D.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone was cosmopolitan. The Premier of the British Empire\r\nis ever a prominent personage, but he has stood above them all. For more\r\nthan half a century he has been the active advocate of liberty, morality\r\nand religion, and of movements that had for their object the prosperity,\r\nadvancement and happiness of men. In all this he has been upright,\r\ndisinterested and conscientious in word and deed. He has proved himself\r\nto be the world's champion of human rights. For these reasons he has\r\nendeared himself to all men wherever civilization has advanced to\r\nenlighten and to elevate in this wide world.\r\n\r\nWith the closing of the 19th century the world is approaching a crisis\r\nin which every nation is involved. For a time the map of the world\r\nmight as well be rolled up. Great questions that have agitated one or\r\nmore nations have convulsed the whole earth because steam and\r\nelectricity have annihilated time and space. Questions that have sprung\r\nup between England and Africa, France and Prussia, China and Japan,\r\nRussia and China, Turkey and Armenia, Greece and Turkey, Spain and\r\nAmerica have proved international and have moved all nations. The daily\r\nproceedings of Congress at Washington are discussed in Japan.\r\n\r\nIn these times of turning and overturning, of discontent and unrest, of\r\ngreed and war, when the needs of the nations most demand men of\r\nworld-wide renown, of great experience in government and diplomacy, and\r\nof firm hold upon the confidence of the people; such men as, for\r\nexample, Gladstone, Salisbury, Bismark, Crispi and Li Hung Chang, who\r\nhave led the mighty advance of civilization, are passing away. Upon\r\nyounger men falls the heavy burden of the world, and the solution of the\r\nmighty problems of this climax of the most momentous of all centuries.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Record of these illustrious lives remains to us for\r\nguidance and inspiration. History is the biography of great men. The\r\nlamp of history is the beacon light of many lives. The biography of\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone is the history, not only of the English\r\nParliament, but of the progress of civilization in the earth for the\r\nwhole period of his public life. With the life of Mr. Gladstone in his\r\nhand, the student of history or the young statesman has a light to guide\r\nhim and to help him solve those intricate problems now perplexing the\r\nnations, and upon the right solution of which depends Christian\r\ncivilization--the liberties, progress, prosperity and happiness of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\nHence, the life and public services of the Grand Old Man cannot fail to\r\nbe of intense interest to all, particularly to the English, because he\r\nhas repeatedly occupied the highest position under the sovereign of\r\nEngland, to the Irish whether Protestant or Catholic, north or south,\r\nbecause of his advocacy of (Reforms) for Ireland; to the Scotch because\r\nof his Scottish descent; to the German because he reminds them of their\r\nown great chancellor, the Unifier of Germany, Prince Bismarck; and to\r\nthe American because he was ever the champion of freedom; and as there\r\nhas been erected in Westminster Abbey a tablet to the memory of Lord\r\nHowe, so will the American people enshrine in their hearts, among the\r\ngreatest of the great, the memory of William Ewart Gladstone.\r\n\r\n     \"In youth a student and in eld a sage;\r\n        Lover of freedom; of mankind the friend;\r\n        Noble in aim from childhood to the end;\r\n      Great is thy mark upon historic page.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\nANCESTRY AND BIRTH\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\nAT ETON AND OXFORD\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\nEARLY PARLIAMENTARY EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\nBOOK ON CHURCH AND STATE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTRAVELS AND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\nENTERS THE CABINET\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\nMEMBER FOR OXFORD\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\nTHE NEAPOLITAN PRISONS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\nTHE FIRST BUDGET\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\nTHE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\nIN OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\nHOMERIC STUDIES\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\nGREAT BUDGETS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\nLIBERAL REFORMER AND PRIME MINISTER\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\nTHE GOLDEN AGE OF LIBERALISM\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\nTHE EASTERN QUESTION\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\nMIDLOTHIAN AND THE SECOND PREMIERSHIP\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\nTHIRD ADMINISTRATION AND HOME RULE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\nPRIME MINISTER THE FOURTH TIME\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\nIN PRIVATE LIFE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\nCLOSING SCENES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gladstone entering Palace Yard, Westminster.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"In thought, word and deed,\r\n     How throughout all thy warfare thou wast pure,\r\n     I find it easy to believe.\"\r\n                                --ROBERT BROWNING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Illustrations.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM E.

GLADSTONE, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nThere are few, even among those who differed from him, who would deny to\r\nMr. Gladstone the title of a great statesman: and in order to appreciate\r\nhis wonderful career, it is necessary to realize the condition of the\r\nworld of thought, manners and works at the time when he entered\r\npublic life.\r\n\r\nIn medicine there was no chloroform; in art the sun had not been\r\nenlisted in portraiture; railways were just struggling into existence;\r\nthe electric telegraph was unknown; gas was an unfashionable light;\r\npostage was dear, and newspapers were taxed.\r\n\r\nIn literature, Scott had just died; Carlyle was awaiting the publication\r\nof his first characteristic book; Tennyson was regarded as worthy of\r\nhope because of his juvenile poems; Macaulay was simply a brilliant\r\nyoung man who had written some stirring verse and splendid prose; the\r\nBrontës were schoolgirls; Thackeray was dreaming of becoming an artist;\r\nDickens had not written a line of fiction; Browning and George Eliot\r\nwere yet to come.\r\n\r\nIn theology, Newman was just emerging from evangelicalism; Pusey was an\r\nOxford tutor; Samuel Wilberforce a village curate; Henry Manning a young\r\ngraduate; and Darwin was commencing that series of investigations which\r\nrevolutionized the popular conception of created things.\r\n\r\nPrincess, afterwards Queen Victoria, was a girl of thirteen; Cobden a\r\nyoung calico printer; Bright a younger cotton spinner; Palmerston was\r\nregarded as a man-about-town, and Disraeli as a brilliant and eccentric\r\nnovelist with parliamentary ambition. The future Marquis of Salisbury\r\nand Prime Minister of Great Britain was an infant scarcely out of arms;\r\nLord Rosebery, (Mr. Gladstone's successor in the Liberal Premiership),\r\nLord Spencer, Lord Herschell, Mr. John Morley, Mr. Campbell-Bannerman,\r\nMr. Asquith, Mr. Brice, Mr. Acland and Mr. Arnold Morley, or more than\r\nhalf the members of his latest cabinet remained to be born; as did also\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire, Mr. Balfour and Mr. Chamberlain, among those who\r\nwere his keenest opponents toward the end of his public career.\r\n\r\nAt last the end of Mr. Gladstone's public life arrived, but it had been\r\nextended to an age greater than that at which any English statesman had\r\never conducted the government of his country.\r\n\r\nOf the significance of the life of this great man, it would be\r\nsuperfluous to speak. The story will signally fail of its purpose if it\r\ndoes not carry its own moral with it. We can best conclude these\r\nintroductory remarks by applying to the subject of the following pages,\r\nsome words which he applied a generation ago to others:\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of common experience we see some human beings live and\r\ndie, and furnish by their life no special lessons visible to man, but\r\nonly that general teaching in elementary and simple forms which is\r\nderivable from every particle of human histories. Others there have\r\nbeen, who, from the times when their young lives first, as it were,\r\npeeped over the horizon, seemed at once to--\r\n\r\n       \"'Flame in the forehead of the evening sky,'\"\r\n     --Whose lengthening years have been but one growing\r\n              splendor, and who at last--\r\n       \"------Leave a lofty name,\r\n     A light, a landmark on the cliffs of fame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nANCESTRY AND BIRTH\r\n\r\nAll history, says Emerson, \"resolves itself into the biographies of a\r\nfew stout and earnest persons.\" These remarks find exemplification in\r\nthe life of William Ewart Gladstone, of whom they are pre-eminently\r\ntrue. His recorded life, from the early period of his graduation to his\r\nfourth premiership, would embrace in every important respect not only\r\nthe history of the British Empire, but very largely the international\r\nevents of every nation of the world for more than half a century.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone, M.P., D.C.L., statesman, orator and scholar,\r\nwas born December 27, 1809, in Liverpool, England. The house in which he\r\nwas born, number 62 Rodney Street, a commodious and imposing\r\n\"double-fronted\" dwelling of red brick, is still standing. In the\r\nneighborhood of the Rodney Street house, and a few years before or after\r\nthe birth of William E. Gladstone, a number of distinguished persons\r\nwere born, among them William Roscoe, the writer and philanthropist,\r\nJohn Gibson, the sculptor, Doctor Bickersteth, the late Bishop of Ripon,\r\nMrs. Hemans, the poetess, and Doctor James Martineau, Professor of\r\nMental and Moral Philosophy in Manchester New College, and the brother\r\nof Harriet Martineau, the authoress.\r\n\r\nThe Gladstone family, or Gledstanes, which was the original family name,\r\nwas of Scottish origin. The derivation of the name is obvious enough to\r\nany one familiar with the ancestral home. A _gled_ is a hawk, and that\r\nfierce and beautiful bird would have found its natural refuge among the\r\n_stanes_, or rocks, of the craggy moorlands which surround the\r\n\"fortalice of gledstanes.\" As far back as 1296 Herbert de Gledstane\r\nfigures in the Ragman Roll as one of the lairds who swore fealty to\r\nEdward I. His descendants for generations held knightly rank, and bore\r\ntheir part in the adventurous life of the Border. The chief stock was\r\nsettled at Liberton, in the upper part of Clydesdale. It was a family of\r\nScottish lairds, holding large estates in the sixteenth century. The\r\nestate dwindled, and in the beginning of the seventeenth century passed\r\nout of their hands, except the adjacent property of Authurshiel, which\r\nremained in their possession for a hundred years longer. A younger\r\nbranch of the family--the son of the last of the Gledstanes of\r\nArthurshiel--after many generations, came to dwell at Biggar, in\r\nLanarkshire, where he conducted the business of a \"maltster,\" or\r\ngrain merchant.\r\n\r\nHere, and at about this time, the name was changed to Gladstones, and a\r\ngrandson of the maltster of Biggar, Thomas Gladstones, settled in Leith\r\nand there became a \"corn-merchant.\" He was born at Mid Toftcombs, in\r\n1732, and married Helen Neilson, of Springfield. His aptitude for\r\nbusiness was so great that he was enabled to make ample provision for a\r\nlarge family of sixteen children. His son, John Gladstone, was the\r\nfather of William E. Gladstone, the subject of our sketch.\r\n\r\nSome have ascribed to Mr. Gladstone an illustrious, even a royal\r\nancestry, through his father's marriage. He met and married a lovely,\r\ncultured and pious woman of Dingwall, in Orkney, the daughter of Andrew\r\nRobertson, Provost of Dingwall, named Ann Robertson, whom the\r\nunimpeachable Sir Bernard Burke supplied with a pedigree from Henry III,\r\nking of England, and Robert Bruce, of Bannockburn, king of Scotland, so\r\nthat it is royal English and Scottish blood that runs in the veins of\r\nMr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\n\"This alleged illustrious pedigree,\" says E.B. Smith, in his elaborate\r\nwork on William E. Gladstone, \"is thus traced: Lady Jane Beaufort, who\r\nwas a descendant of Henry III, married James I, of Scotland, who was a\r\ndescendant of Bruce. From this alliance it is said that the steps can be\r\nfollowed clearly down to the father of Miss Robertson. A Scottish writer\r\nupon genealogy, also referring to this matter, states that Mr. Gladstone\r\nis descended on the mother's side from the ancient Mackenzie of Kintail,\r\nthrough whom is introduced the blood of the Bruce, of the ancient Kings\r\nof Man, and of the Lords of the Isles and Earls of Ross; also from the\r\nMunros of Fowlis, and the Robertsons of Strowan and Athole. What was of\r\nmore consequence to the Gladstones of recent generations, however, than\r\nroyal blood, was the fact that by their energy and honorable enterprise\r\nthey carved their own fortunes, and rose to positions of public esteem\r\nand eminence.\" It has been their pride that they sprang from the ranks\r\nof the middle classes, from which have come so many of the great men of\r\nEngland eminent in political and military life.\r\n\r\nIn an address delivered at the Liverpool Collegiate Institute, December\r\n21, 1872, Sir John Gladstone said; \"I know not why the commerce of\r\nEngland should not have its old families rejoicing to be connected with\r\ncommerce from generation to generation. It has been so in other\r\ncountries; I trust it may be so in this country. I think it is a subject\r\nof sorrow, and almost of scandal, when those families who have either\r\nacquired or recovered wealth and station through commerce, turn their\r\nbacks upon it and seem to be ashamed of it. It certainly is not so with\r\nmy brother or with me. His sons are treading in his steps, and one of my\r\nsons, I rejoice to say, is treading in the steps of my father and\r\nmy brother.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge W.E. Russell, in his admirable biography of Mr. William E.\r\nGladstone, says, \"Sir John Gladstone was a pure Scotchman, a lowlander\r\nby birth and descent. Provost Robertson belonged to the Clan Donachie,\r\nand by this marriage the robust and business-like qualities of the\r\nLowlander were blended with the poetic imagination, the sensibility and\r\nfire of the Gael.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting story is told, showing how Sir John Gladstone, the father\r\nof William E. Gladstone, came to live in Liverpool, and enter upon his\r\ngreat business career, and where he became a merchant prince. Born at\r\nLeith in 1763, he in due time entered his father's business, where he\r\nserved until he was twenty-one years old. At that time his father sent\r\nhim to Liverpool to dispose of a cargo of grain, belonging to him, which\r\nhad arrived at that port. His demeanor and business qualities so\r\nimpressed Mr. Corrie, a grain merchant of that place, that he urged his\r\nfather to let him settle there. Consent was obtained and young Gladstone\r\nentered the house of Corrie & Company as a clerk. His tact and\r\nshrewdness were soon manifest, and he was eventually taken into the firm\r\nas a partner, and the name of the house became Corrie, Gladstone\r\n& Bradshaw.\r\n\r\nJohn Gladstone on one occasion proved the temporary preserver of the\r\nfirm of which he had become a member. He was sent to America to buy\r\ngrain for the firm, in a time of great scarcity in Europe, owing to the\r\nfailure of the crops, but he found the condition of things the same in\r\nAmerica. There was no grain to be had. While in great perplexity as to\r\nwhat to do he received advices from Liverpool that twenty-four vessels\r\nhad been dispatched for the grain he was expected to purchase, to bring\r\nit to Europe. The prospect was that these vessels would have to return\r\nto Europe empty as they had come, and the house of Corrie & Company be\r\ninvolved thereby in ruin. It was then that John Gladstone rose to the\r\nemergency of the occasion, and by his enterprise and energy saved\r\nhimself and partners from financial failure, to the great surprise and\r\nadmiration of the merchants of Liverpool. It was in this way: He made a\r\nthorough examination of the American markets for articles of commerce\r\nthat could be sold in Europe to advantage, and filling his vessels with\r\nthem sent them home. This sagacious movement not only saved his house,\r\nbut gave him a name and place among the foremost merchants of his day.\r\nHis name was also a synonym for push and integrity, not only on the\r\nLiverpool exchange, but in London and throughout all England. The\r\nbusiness of the firm became very great and the wealth of its members\r\nvery large.\r\n\r\nDuring the war with Napoleon, on the continent, and the war of 1812 with\r\nthe United States, the commerce of England, as mistress of the seas, was\r\ninjured, and the Gladstone firm suffered greatly and was among the first\r\nto seek peace, for its own sake and in the interests of trade. In one\r\nyear the commerce of Liverpool declined to the amount of 140,000 tons,\r\nwhich was about one-fourth of the entire trade, and there was a decrease\r\nof more than $100,000 in the dock-dues of that port. John Gladstone was\r\namong those who successfully petitioned the British government for a\r\nchange of its suicidal policy towards the American States.\r\n\r\nAfter sixteen years of successful operations, during a part of which\r\ntime it had been government agent, the firm was dissolved and its\r\nbusiness was continued by John Gladstone. His six brothers having\r\nfollowed him from Leith to Liverpool, he took into partnership with him\r\nhis brother Robert. Their business became very extensive, having a large\r\ntrade with Russia, and as sugar importers and West India merchants. John\r\nGladstone was the chairman of the West India Association and took an\r\nactive part in the improvement and enlargement of the docks of\r\nLiverpool. In 1814, when the monopoly of the East India Company was\r\nbroken and the trade of India and China thrown open to competition, the\r\nfirm of John Gladstone & Company was the first to send a private vessel\r\nto Calcutta.\r\n\r\nJohn Gladstone was a public-spirited man and took great interest in the\r\nwelfare of his adopted city. He was ever ready to labor for its\r\nprosperity, and consequently endeared himself to the people of all\r\nclasses and conditions, and of every shade of political opinion.\r\n\r\nThe high estimation in which he was held by the citizens of Liverpool\r\nwas especially manifest October 18, 1824, when they presented him with a\r\ntestimonial, consisting of a magnificent service of plate, of\r\ntwenty-eight pieces, and bearing the following inscription: \"_To John\r\nGladstone, Esq., M.P., this service of plate was presented MDCCCXXIV, by\r\nhis fellow townsmen and friends, to mark their high sense of his\r\nsuccessful exertions for the promotion of trade and commerce, and in\r\nacknowledgment of his most important services rendered to the town of\r\nLiverpool_.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Gladstone, though devoted to commerce, had time for literary\r\npursuits. He wrote a pamphlet, \"On the Present State of Slavery in the\r\nBritish West Indies and in the United States of America; and on the\r\nImportation of Sugar from British Settlements in India.\" He also\r\npublished, in 1830, another pamphlet, containing a statement of facts\r\nconnected with the same general subject, \"in a letter addressed to Sir\r\nRobert Peel.\" In 1846 he published a pamphlet, entitled \"Plain facts\r\nintimately connected with the intended Repeal of the Corn Laws; or\r\nProbable Effects on the Public Revenue and the Prosperity of\r\nthe Country.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the subject discussed it can be readily and truly imagined that\r\nJohn Gladstone had given thought to political subjects. He was in favor\r\nof a qualified reform which, while affording a greater enfranchisement\r\nof the people, looked also to the interests of all. Having an opinion,\r\nand not being afraid to express it, he was frequently called upon to\r\naddress public meetings. The matters discussed by him were, however,\r\nrather national than municipal, rather humane than partisan. He was a\r\nstrong advocate for certain reforms at home in 1818, and in 1823 on the\r\nseas, and for Greek independence in 1824. \"On the 14th of February,\r\n1824, a public meeting was held in Liverpool Town Hall, 'for the purpose\r\nof considering the best means of assisting the Greeks in their present\r\nimportant struggle for independence.' Mr. Gladstone spoke impressively\r\nin favor of the cause which had already evoked great enthusiasm amongst\r\nthe people, and enlisted the sympathies and support of Lord Byron and\r\nother distinguished friends of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in 1818 that he addressed a meeting called \"to consider the\r\npropriety of petitioning Parliament to take into consideration the\r\nprogressive and alarming increase in the crimes of forging and uttering\r\nforged Bank of England notes.\" The penalties for these crimes were\r\nalready heavy, but their infliction did not deter men from committing\r\nthem, and these crimes increased at an enormous rate. Resolutions were\r\npassed at the Liverpool meeting, recommending the revision and amendment\r\nof existing laws.\r\n\r\nThen again, so late as the year 1823, the navigation between Liverpool\r\nand Dublin was in a lamentable condition, and human life was recklessly\r\nimperiled, and no one seemed willing to interfere and to interest\r\nhimself in the interests of humanity. It was then that he again came to\r\nthe front to advocate a just cause. To illustrate the dangers to vessels\r\nand passengers, the case of the sloop _Alert_ may be cited. It was\r\nwrecked off the Welsh coast, with between 100 and 140 persons on board,\r\nof whom only seventeen were saved. For the safety and rescue of all\r\nthose souls on board this packet-boat there was only one small shallop,\r\ntwelve feet long. Mr. Gladstone was impressed with the terrible nature\r\nof the existing evil, and obtained an amendment to the Steamboat Act,\r\nrequiring imperatively that every passenger vessel should be provided\r\nwith boats sufficient for every passenger it was licensed to carry. By\r\nthis wise and humane provision thousands of lives were doubtless saved\r\nthat would otherwise have been lost--the victims of reckless seamanship\r\nand commercial greed.\r\n\r\nJohn Gladstone, either through the influence of Mr. Canning, or from\r\nhaving imbibed some political taste, sat in the House of Commons nine\r\nyears, representing Lancaster in 1819, Woodstock from 1821 to 1826, and\r\nBerwick in 1827; but he never would consent to sit in Parliament for the\r\ncity of Liverpool, for he thought that so large and important a\r\nconstituency required peculiar representation such as he was\r\nunqualified to give.\r\n\r\nHe was the warm supporter and intimate friend of the celebrated Canning.\r\nAt first he was a Whig, but finally came to support Mr. Canning, and\r\nbecame a Liberal Conservative. In 1812 he presided over a meeting at\r\nLiverpool, which was called to invite Mr. Canning to represent the\r\nborough in Parliament. After the election the successful candidates were\r\nclaimed and carried in procession through the streets. The procession\r\nfinally halted at Mr. Gladstone's house, in Rodney Street, from the\r\nbalcony of which Mr. Canning addressed the populace. His election laid\r\nthe foundation of a deep and lasting friendship between Mr. Canning and\r\nMr. Gladstone. \"At this time the son of the latter was but three years\r\nof age. Shortly afterwards--that is, as soon as he was able to\r\nunderstand anything of public men, and public movements and\r\nevents\"--says G.B. Smith, \"the name of Canning began to exercise that\r\nstrange fascination over the mind of William Ewart Gladstone which has\r\nnever wholly passed away,\" and Mr. Gladstone himself acknowledged that\r\nhe was brought up \"under the shadow of the great name of Canning.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Gladstone presided at a farewell dinner given by the Liverpool\r\nCanning Club, in August, 1822, in honor of Mr. Canning, who had been\r\nGovernor-General of India. But Mr. Canning, instead of going to India,\r\nentered the British Cabinet, and in 1827 became Prime Minister, and John\r\nGladstone moved a congratulatory address to the king upon the formation\r\nof the Canning Ministry.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 John Gladstone was created a baronet by Sir Robert Peel, but he\r\nlived to enjoy his deserved honors but a short time, for he died in\r\n1851, at the advanced age of eighty-eight. His motto had ever been,\r\n\"Diligent in business.\" His enormous wealth enabled him to provide\r\nhandsomely for his family, not only after death, but during\r\nhis lifetime.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his father's death, William E. Gladstone was still an\r\nadherent of the Tory party, yet his steps indicated that he was\r\nadvancing towards Liberalism; and he had already reached distinction as\r\na statesman, both in Parliament and in the Cabinet, while as yet he was\r\nbut 42 years old, which was about half of his age when called for the\r\nfourth time to be Prime Minister of England.\r\n\r\nSir John Gladstone and his wife had six children--four sons, Thomas\r\nGladstone, afterwards baronet; John Gladstone, who became a captain, and\r\ndied in 1863; Robert Gladstone, brought up a merchant, who died in 1875,\r\nand two daughters, Annie McKenzie Gladstone, who died years ago, and\r\nHelen Jane Gladstone. William E. Gladstone was the fourth son. The\r\nfollowing is from the pen of the son, who says of his aged father, Sir\r\nJohn Gladstone: \"His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated; he\r\nwas full of bodily and mental vigor; whatsoever his hand found to do he\r\ndid it with his might; he could not understand or tolerate those who,\r\nperceiving an object to be good, did not at once and actively pursue it;\r\nand with all this energy he gained a corresponding warmth, and, so to\r\nspeak, eagerness of affection, a keen appreciation of humor, in which he\r\nfound a rest, and an indescribable frankness and simplicity of\r\ncharacter, which, crowning his other qualities, made him, I think, and I\r\nstrive to think impartially, nearly or quite the most interesting old\r\nman I ever knew.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, Sir John Gladstone was a man of much intelligence and of\r\nsterling principle, of high moral and religious character, and his\r\nhouse consequently was a model home. \"His house was by all accounts a\r\nhome pre-eminently calculated to mould the thoughts and direct the\r\ncourse of an intelligent and receptive nature. There was a father's\r\nmasterful will and keen perception, the sweetness and piety of the\r\nmother, wealth with all its substantial advantages and few of its\r\nmischiefs, a strong sense of the value of money, a rigid avoidance of\r\nextravagance and excesses; everywhere a strenuous purpose in life,\r\nconstant employment, and concentrated ambition.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. John Gladstone, the wife and mother, is described by one who knew\r\nher intimately as \"a lady of very great accomplishments; of fascinating\r\nmanners, of commanding presence and high intellect; one to grace any\r\nhome and endear any heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe following picture of the everyday life of the family is interesting\r\nand instructive, on account of Sir John Gladstone, as well as on that of\r\nhis more distinguished son, and is from the pen of an eye-witness:\r\n\"Nothing was ever taken for granted between him and his sons. A\r\nsuccession of arguments on great topics and small topics\r\nalike--arguments conducted with perfect good humor, but also with the\r\nmost implicable logic--formed the staple of the family conversation. The\r\nchildren and their parents argued upon everything. They would debate as\r\nto whether a window should be opened, and whether it was likely to be\r\nfair or wet the next day. It was all perfectly good-humored, but curious\r\nto a stranger, because of the evident care which all the disputants took\r\nto advance no proposition, even as to the prospect of rain, rashly.\"\r\n\r\nIn such a home as this was William E. Gladstone in training as the great\r\nParliamentary debater and leader, and for the highest office under the\r\nBritish crown. This reminds us of a story of Burke. The king one day,\r\nunexpectedly entering the office of his minister, found the elder Burke\r\nsitting at his desk, with his eyes fixed upon his young son, who was\r\nstanding on his father's desk in the attitude of speaking. \"What are you\r\ndoing?\" asked the astonished king. \"I am making the greatest minister\r\nEngland ever saw,\" was the reply. And so in fact, and yet all\r\nunconsciously, was Sir John doing for his son, William.\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone \"was born,\" says his biographer, G.W.E. Russell,\r\n\"at a critical moment in the fortunes of England and of Europe. Abroad\r\nthe greatest genius that the world has ever seen was wading through\r\nslaughter to a universal throne, and no effectual resistance had as yet\r\nbeen offered to a progress which menaced the liberty of Europe and the\r\nexistence of its States. At home, a crazy king and a profligate\r\nheir-apparent presided over a social system in which all civil evils\r\nwere harmoniously combined. A despotic administration was supported by a\r\nparliamentary representation as corrupt as illusory; a church, in which\r\nspiritual religion was all but extinct, had sold herself as a bondslave\r\nto the governing classes. Rank and wealth and territorial ascendency\r\nwere divorced from public duty, and even learning had become the\r\nhandmaid of tyranny. The sacred name of justice was prostituted to\r\nsanction a system of legal murder. Commercial enterprise was paralyzed\r\nby prohibitive legislation; public credit was shaken to its base; the\r\nprime necessaries of life were ruinously dear. The pangs of poverty were\r\naggravated by the concurrent evils of war and famine, and the common\r\npeople, fast bound in misery and iron, were powerless to make their\r\nsufferings known or to seek redress, except by the desperate methods of\r\nconspiracy and insurrection. None of the elements of revolution were\r\nwanting, and the fates seemed to be hurrying England to the brink of a\r\ncivil catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"The general sense of insecurity and apprehension, inseparable from such\r\na condition of affairs, produced its effect upon even the robust minds.\r\nSir John Gladstone was not a likely victim of panic, but he was a man\r\nwith a large stake in the country, the more precious because acquired by\r\nhis own exertion; he believed that the safeguards of property and order\r\nwere imperilled by foreign arms and domestic sedition; and he had seen\r\nwith indignation and disgust the excesses of a factious Whiggery, which\r\nwas not ashamed to exult in the triumph of the French over the English\r\nGovernment. Under the pressure of these influences Sir John Gladstone\r\ngradually separated himself from the Whigs, with whom in earlier life he\r\nhad acted, and became the close ally of Canning, whose return for\r\nLiverpool he actually promoted.\"\r\n\r\nWith such surroundings it is not to be wondered at that William E.\r\nGladstone entered political life a Tory, contending against the\r\nprinciples he afterwards espoused. His original bent, however, was not\r\ntowards politics, but the church; and it was only at the earnest desire\r\nof his father that he ultimately decided to enter Parliament, and serve\r\nhis country in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nHis subsequent life proved the wisdom of the choice. In the Legislature\r\nof his country was begun, carried on and consummated grandly, one of the\r\nmost remarkable careers in the annals of history for versatility,\r\nbrilliancy, solidity and long continuance. Rarely has there been\r\nexhibited so complete a combination of qualities in statesmanship. His\r\nintellectual endowments were almost without a parallel, and his\r\nachievements without a precedent. In him seemed to be centered a rich\r\ncollection of the highest gifts of genius, great learning and readiness\r\nin debate and discourse in the House of Commons, and extraordinary\r\nwisdom in the administration of the affairs of the nation. His financial\r\ntalent, his business aptitude, his classical attainments, and above all\r\nhis moral fervor, and religious spirit were conspicuous. Some men would\r\nhave been contented with political power, or classical learning, or\r\nliterary distinction, but he excelled in all these--not only as a\r\nstatesman, but as a man of letters and a classical scholar. Neither has\r\nheld him exclusively as its own--he belongs to all, or rather they\r\nbelong to him--for he explored and conquered them. His literary\r\nproductions equal in merit his papers of State, while his knowledge of\r\nthe classics would do credit to any scholar.\r\n\r\nHe possessed the unusual quality of throwing the light of his own mind\r\non the greatest questions of national and international importance, of\r\nbringing them down to the understanding and appreciation of the masses\r\nof the people, of infusing, by his earnestness, the fire of his own soul\r\nin the people, and of arousing in them the greatest enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn the biography of this wonderful person we propose to set before the\r\nreader the man himself--his words and his deeds. This method enables him\r\nto speak for himself, and thus the reader may study him and know him,\r\nand because thereof be lifted into a higher plane of nobler and better\r\nbeing. The acts and utterances of such a character are his best\r\nbiography, and especially for one differing so largely from all other\r\nmen as to have none to be compared with him.\r\n\r\nIn this record we simply spread before the reader his private life and\r\npublic services, connected together through many startling changes, from\r\nhome to school, from university to Parliament, from Tory follower to\r\nLiberal leader, from the early start in his political course to the\r\ngrand consummation of the statesman's success in his attainment to the\r\nfourth Premiership of this Grand Old Man, and the glorious end of an\r\neventful life.\r\n\r\nWe could not do better, in closing this chapter, than to reproduce a\r\npart of the character sketch of William E. Gladstone, from the pen of\r\nWilliam T. Stead, and published in the \"Review of Reviews:\"\r\n\r\n\"So much has been written about Mr. Gladstone that it was with some\r\nsinking of heart I ventured to select him as a subject for my next\r\ncharacter sketch. But I took heart of grace when I remembered that the\r\nobject of these sketches is to describe their subject as he appears to\r\nhimself at his best, and his countrymen. There are plenty of other\r\npeople ready to fill in the shadows. This paper claims in no way to be a\r\ncritical estimate or a judicial summing up of the merits and demerits\r\nof the most remarkable of all living Englishmen. It is merely an attempt\r\nto catch, as it were, the outline of the heroic figure which has\r\ndominated English politics for the lifetime of this generation, and\r\nthereby to explain something of the fascination which his personality\r\nhas exercised and still exercises over the men and women of his time. If\r\nhis enemies, and they are many, say that I have idealized a wily old\r\nopportunist out of all recognition, I answer that to the majority of his\r\nfellow-subjects my portrait is not overdrawn. The real Gladstone may be\r\nother than this, but this is probably more like the Gladstone for whom\r\nthe electors believe they are voting, than a picture of Gladstone,\r\n'warts and all,' would be. And when I am abused, as I know I shall be,\r\nfor printing such a sketch, I shall reply that there is at least one\r\nthing to be said in its favor. To those who know him best, in his own\r\nhousehold, and to those who only know him as a great name in history, my\r\nsketch will only appear faulty because it does not do full justice to\r\nthe character and genius of this extraordinary man.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone appeals to the men of to-day from the vantage point of\r\nextreme old age. Age is so frequently dotage, that when a veteran\r\nappears who preserves the heart of a boy and the happy audacity of\r\nyouth, under the 'lyart haffets wearing thin and bare' of aged manhood,\r\nit seems as if there is something supernatural about it, and all men\r\nfeel the fascination and the charm. Mr. Gladstone, as he gleefully\r\nremarked the other day, has broken the record. He has outlived Lord\r\nPalmerston, who died when eighty-one, and Thiers, who only lived to be\r\neighty. The blind old Dandolo in Byron's familiar verse--\r\n\r\n     The octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe,\r\n\r\nhad not more energy than the Liberal leader, who, now in his\r\neighty-third year, has more nerve and spring and go than any of his\r\nlieutenants, not excluding the youngest recruit. There is something\r\nimposing and even sublime in the long procession of years which bridge\r\nas with eighty-two arches the abyss of past time, and carry us back to\r\nthe days of Canning, and of Castlereagh, of Napoleon, and of Wellington.\r\nHis parliamentary career extends over sixty years--the lifetime of two\r\ngenerations. He is the custodian of all the traditions, the hero of the\r\nexperience of successive administrations, from a time dating back longer\r\nthan most of his colleagues can remember. For nearly forty years he has\r\nhad a leading part in making or unmaking of Cabinets; he has served his\r\nQueen and his country in almost every capacity in office and in\r\nopposition, and yet to-day, despite his prolonged sojourn in the malaria\r\nof political wire-pulling, his heart seems to be as the heart of a\r\nlittle child. If some who remember 'the old Parliamentary hand' should\r\nwhisper that innocence of the dove is sometimes compatible with the\r\nwisdom of the serpent, I make no dissent. It is easy to be a dove, and\r\nto be as silly as a dove. It is easy to be as wise as a serpent, and as\r\nwicked, let us say, as Mr. Governor Hill or Lord Beaconsfield. But it is\r\nthe combination that is difficult, and in Mr. Gladstone the combination\r\nis almost ideally complete.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone is old enough to be the grandfather of the younger race\r\nof politicians, but still his courage, his faith, his versatility, put\r\nthe youngest of them to shame. It is this ebullience of youthful energy,\r\nthis inexhaustible vitality, which is the admiration and despair of his\r\ncontemporaries. Surely when a schoolboy at Eton he must somewhere have\r\ndiscovered the elixir of life, or have been bathed by some beneficent\r\nfairy in the well of perpetual youth. Gladly would many a man of fifty\r\nexchange physique with this hale and hearty octogenarian. Only in one\r\nrespect does he show any trace of advancing years. His hearing is not\r\nquite so good as it was, but still it is far better than that of\r\nCardinal Manning, who became very deaf in his closing years. Otherwise\r\nMr. Gladstone is hale and hearty. His eye is not dim, neither is his\r\nnatural force abated. A splendid physical frame, carefully preserved,\r\ngives every promise of a continuance of his green old age.\r\n\r\n\"His political opponents, who began this Parliament by confidently\r\ncalculating upon his death before the dissolution, are now beginning to\r\nadmit that it is by no means improbable that Mr. Gladstone may survive\r\nthe century. Nor was it quite so fantastic as it appears at first sight,\r\nwhen an ingenious disciple told him the other day that by the fitness of\r\nthings he ought to live for twenty years yet. 'For,' said this political\r\narithmetician, 'you have been twenty-six years a Tory, twenty-six years\r\na Whig Liberal, and you have been only six years a Radical Home Ruler.\r\nTo make the balance even you have twenty years still to serve.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir Provo Wallis, the Admiral of the Fleet, who died the other day at\r\nthe age of one hundred, had not a better constitution than Mr.\r\nGladstone, nor had it been more carefully preserved in the rough and\r\ntumble of our naval war. If the man who smelt powder in the famous fight\r\nbetween the Chesapeake and the Shannon lived to read the reports of the\r\npreparations for the exhibition at Chicago, it is not so incredible that\r\nMr. Gladstone may at least be in the foretop of the State at the dawn of\r\nthe twentieth century.\r\n\r\n\"The thought is enough to turn the Tories green with sickening despair,\r\nthat the chances of his life, from a life insurance office point of\r\nview, are probably much better than Lord Salisbury's. But that is one of\r\nthe attributes of Mr. Gladstone which endear him so much to his party.\r\nHe is always making his enemies sick with despairing jealousy. He is the\r\ngreat political evergreen, who seems, even in his political life, to\r\nhave borrowed something of immortality from the fame which he has won.\r\nHe has long been the Grand Old Man. If he lives much longer he bids fair\r\nto be known as the immortal old man in more senses than one.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLADSTONE'S BIRTHPLACE, RODNEY STREET, LIVERPOOL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nAT ETON AND OXFORD\r\n\r\nThere is very little recorded of the boyhood of some great men, and this\r\nis true of the childhood of William E. Gladstone, until he leaves the\r\nparental home for school, which he does in 1821, at the early age of\r\neleven. He was fortunate in his parentage, but no less so in his early\r\nassociations, both in and out of school. We refer particularly to his\r\nprivate preceptors, two of whom, the venerable Archdeacon Jones and the\r\nRev. William Rawson, first Vicar of Seaforth, a watering-place near\r\nLiverpool, were both men of high character and great ability. Mr.\r\nGladstone always highly esteemed Mr. Rawson, his earliest preceptor, and\r\nvisited him on his death-bed. Dr. Turner, afterwards Bishop of Calcutta,\r\nwas for two years young Gladstone's private tutor, beginning his\r\ninstruction when his pupil left Eton in 1827.\r\n\r\nBesides these associations of his early life there were Canning, a\r\nfrequent visitor, as has been mentioned, at his father's house, and\r\nHannah More--\"Holy Hannah,\" as Horace Walpole called her. She singled\r\nout \"Billy\" Gladstone for her especial pet out of the group of eleven\r\nchildren in whom her warm heart delighted, and it has been asked\r\nwonderingly if Miss More could preternaturally have lengthened her days\r\nuntil William E. Gladstone's present glory, whether she would have gone\r\non dubbing him \"Billy\" in undignified brevity until the end.\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone, when very young, gave such evidence of uncommon\r\nintellectual ability and promise of future greatness that his father\r\nresolved upon educating him in the best schools of England. There are\r\nfour or five great schools in England in which the English youth are\r\nprepared in four or five years for Cambridge or Oxford. \"Eton, the\r\nlargest and the most celebrated of the public schools of England, ranks\r\nas the second in point of antiquity, Winchester alone being older.\"\r\nAfter the preparation at home, under private teachers, to which we have\r\nreferred, William E. Gladstone was sent to Eton, in September, 1821. His\r\nbiographer, George W.E. Russell, writes, \"From a provincial town, from\r\nmercantile surroundings, from an atmosphere of money-making, from a\r\nstrictly regulated life, the impressible boy was transplanted, at the\r\nage of eleven, to the shadow of Windsor and the banks of the Thames, to\r\nan institution which belongs to history, to scenes haunted by the\r\nmemory of the most illustrious Englishmen, to a free and independent\r\nexistence among companions who were the very flower of English boyhood.\r\nA transition so violent and yet so delightful was bound to produce an\r\nimpression which lapse of time was powerless to efface, and no one who\r\nknows the man and the school can wonder that for seventy years Mr.\r\nGladstone has been the most enthusiastic of Etonians.\"\r\n\r\nEton of to-day is not in all respects the Eton of three-quarters of a\r\ncentury ago, and yet in some particulars it is as it was when young\r\n\"Billy\" Gladstone studied within its walls. The system of education and\r\ndiscipline pursued has undergone some modifications in recent\r\nyears--notably during the provostship of the Rev. Francis Hodgson; but\r\nradical defects are still alleged against it. It is not remarkable,\r\nhowever, that every Eton boy becomes deeply attached to the school,\r\nnotwithstanding the apprenticeship to hardships he may have been\r\ncompelled to undergo.\r\n\r\nThe \"hardships\" there must have been particularly great when young\r\nGladstone entered Eton, at the close of the summer holidays of 1821. The\r\nschool was under the head-mastership of \"the terrific Dr. Keate.\" He was\r\nnot the man to spare even the scholar who, upon the emphatic testimony\r\nof Sir Roderick Murchison, was \"the prettiest boy that ever went to\r\nEton,\" and who was as studious and well-behaved as he was good-looking.\r\n\r\nThe town of Eton, in which the school is located, about 22 miles from\r\nLondon, in Berkshire, is beautifully situated on the banks of the river\r\nThames, opposite Windsor Castle, the residence of the Queen of England.\r\n\r\nEton College is one of the most famous and best endowed educational\r\ninstitutions of learning in England. It was founded in 1440 by Henry VI.\r\nThe king was very solicitous that the work should be of a durable kind,\r\nand he provided for free scholarships. Eton of Mr. Gladstone's day,\r\naccording to a critic, was divided into two schools--the upper and the\r\nlower. It also had two kinds of scholars, namely, seventy called king's\r\nscholars or \"collegers,\" who are maintained gratuitously, sleep in the\r\ncollege, and wear a peculiar dress; and another class--the\r\nmajority--called \"oppidans,\" who live in the town. Between these two\r\nclasses of students there prevails perpetual hostility. At Cambridge,\r\nthere was founded, in connection with Eton, what is called King's\r\nCollege, to receive as fellows students from Eton, and to give them\r\ngratuitously an education. The ground on which students of Eton were\r\npromoted to King's College and these fellowships was, strangely to say,\r\nupon that of seniority, or long residence, and not of merit. Because\r\nthere was no competition, scholars who were deficient in education at\r\nEton were promoted to Cambridge, where they had no incentive to work,\r\nbeing exempt from the ordinary university examination.\r\n\r\nAt Eton \"no instruction was given in any branch of mathematical,\r\nphysical, metaphysical or moral science, nor in the evidences of\r\nChristianity. The only subjects which it professed to impart a knowledge\r\nof were the Greek and Latin languages; as much divinity as can be gained\r\nfrom construing the Greek Testament, and reading a portion of Tomline on\r\nthe Thirty-nine Articles, and a little ancient and modern geography.\" So\r\nmuch for the instruction imparted. As regards the hours of tuition,\r\nthere seems to have been fault there, in that they were too few and\r\ninsufficient, there being in all only eleven hours a week study. Then as\r\nto the manner of study, no time was given the scholar to study the style\r\nof an author; he was \"hurried from Herodotus to Thucydides, from\r\nThucydides to Xenophon, from Xenophon to Lucian, without being\r\nhabituated to the style of any one author--without gaining an interest\r\nin the history, or even catching the thread of the narrative; and when\r\nthe whole book is finished he has probably collected only a few vague\r\nideas about Darius crying over a great army, Abydos and Nicias and\r\nDemosthenes being routed with a great army near Syracuse, mixed up with\r\na recollection of the death of Cyrus and Socrates, some moral precept\r\nfrom Socrates, and some jokes against false philosophers and heathen\r\ngods.\" Hence the Eton student who goes to Cambridge finds he has done\r\nbut a little desultory reading, and that he must begin again. It was\r\ncharged that the system of education at Eton failed in every point. The\r\nmoral discipline of the school was also called in question. The number\r\nof scholars was so great that the proper control of them seemed\r\nimpossible under the management. Great laxity prevailed among the larger\r\nboys, while the younger and weaker students were exposed to the tyranny\r\nof the older and stronger ones without hope of redress. The result was\r\nthat the system of \"fagging,\" or the acting of some boys as drudges for\r\nthe others, flourished. \"The right\" of fagging depended upon the place\r\nin the school; all boys in the sixth and fifth forms had the power of\r\nordering--all below the latter form being bound to obey. This system of\r\nfagging has a very injurious effect upon most of the boys; \"it finds\r\nthem slaves and leaves them despots. A boy who has suffered himself,\r\ninsensibly learns to see no harm in making others suffer in turn. The\r\nwhole thing is wrong in principle, and engenders passions which should\r\nbe stifled and not encouraged.\" Why free and enlightened England should\r\ntolerate, even then, such barbarous slavery cannot be understood and\r\nyet there are outrageous customs prevailing among college students of\r\nour day in every civilized land that should be suppressed.\r\n\r\nFlogging was in vogue, too, at Eton, with all its degrading and\r\ndemoralizing effects, and was performed by the Head-Master himself. In\r\n1820, the year before Mr. Gladstone entered Eton, there were 280 upper\r\nstudents and 319 lower, a total of 612, and none were exempt.\r\n\r\nSome curious stories are told of flogging, which has ever existed at\r\nEton, and from which even the largest boys were not exempt. Mr. Lewis\r\nrelates how a young man of twenty, just upon the point of leaving\r\nschool, and engaged to be married to a lady at Windsor, was well and\r\nsoundly whipped by Dr. Goodford, for arriving one evening at his tutor's\r\nhouse after the specified time. And it is related that Arthur Wellesley,\r\nafterwards the Iron Duke of Wellington, was flogged at Eton for having\r\nbeen \"barred out.\" At the same time there were eighty boys who\r\nwere whipped.\r\n\r\nAnd the Eton of twenty years later was very little improved over its\r\ncondition in Mr. Gladstone's time there, or in 1845. John D. Lewis,\r\nspeaking of this period, says that after the boys reached the fifth\r\nform, then began \"some of the greatest anomalies and absurdities of the\r\nthen Etonian system.\" The student was now safe from the ordeal of\r\nexaminations, and that the higher classes, including ten senior\r\ncollegers and ten senior oppidans, contained some of the very worst\r\nscholars. \"A boy's place on the general roll was no more a criterion of\r\nhis acquirements and his industry than would be the 'year' of a young\r\nman at Oxford or Cambridge.\" The collegers, however, were required to\r\npass some kind of examination, in accordance with which their place on\r\nthe list for the King's college was fixed. But the evils regarding the\r\nhours of study and the nature of the studies were as bad. \"The regular\r\nholidays and Saints' days, two whole holidays in a week, and two\r\nhalf-holidays, were a matter of common occurrence.\"\r\n\r\nLord Morley, in his examination before the Commission on Public Schools,\r\nwas asked whether a boy would be looked down upon at Eton for being\r\nindustrious in his studies, replied, \"Not if he could do something else\r\nwell.\" And this seems to be the spirit of the Eton boy with whom a lack\r\nof scholarship is more than made up by skill in river or field sports.\r\n\r\nThis is true to-day; for a recent writer in the _Forum_, upon \"The\r\nTraining of Boys at Eton,\" says: \"Athletic prominence is in English\r\npublic schools almost synonymous with social prominence; many a boy\r\nwhose capacity and character commanded both respect and liking at the\r\nuniversities and in after life, is almost a nobody at a public school,\r\nbecause he has no special athletic gifts.... Great athletic capacity may\r\nco-exist with low moral and intellectual character.\"\r\n\r\nThere were few inducements to study and to excel in scholarship, and\r\nplenty to idleness and neglect, hence he who did so must study in hours\r\nand out of hours, in season and out of season. The curriculum is still\r\nstrictly classical, but French, German and mathematics are taught. The\r\ncollegers of recent years have done very fair work and carried off many\r\ndistinctions at Cambridge. With all these odds against them, and these\r\ndifficulties to surmount, yet there were Eton boys whose attainments\r\nwere deep and solid, and who became famous men, and one of these was\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nWhen young Gladstone entered Eton his brothers, Thomas and Robertson\r\nGladstone, were already there, and the three boys boarded at Mrs.\r\nShurey's, whose house \"at the south end of the broad walk in front of\r\nthe schools and facing the chapel,\" was rather nearer the famous\r\n\"Christopher Inn\" than would be thought desirable nowadays. On the wall\r\nopposite the house the name of \"Gladstone\" is carved. Thomas Gladstone\r\nwas in the fifth form, and William was placed in the middle remove of\r\nthe fourth form, and became his eldest brother's \"fag.\" This doubtlessly\r\nsaved him much annoyance and suffering, and allowed him better to\r\npursue the studious bent of his indications.\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone was what Etonians called a \"sap\"--in other words, a\r\nstudent faithful in the discharge of every duty devolving upon him at\r\nschool--one who studied his lessons and was prepared for his recitations\r\nin the classroom. This agreeable fact has been immortalized in a famous\r\nline in Lord Lytton's \"New Timon.\" He worked hard at his classical\r\nstudies, as required by the rules of the school, and applied himself\r\ndiligently to the study of mathematics during the holidays.\r\n\r\nIt is said that his interest in the work of the school was first aroused\r\nby Mr. Hawtrey, who afterwards became Head-Master, who commended some of\r\nhis Latin verses, and \"sent him up for good.\" This led the young man to\r\nassociate intellectual work with the ideas of ambition and success.\r\nWhile he did not seem to be especially an apt scholar in the restricted\r\nsense for original versification in the classical languages, or for\r\nturning English into Greek or Latin, yet he seemed to seize the precise\r\nmeaning of the authors and to give the sense. \"His composition was\r\nstiff,\" but yet, says a classmate, \"when there were thrilling passages\r\nof Virgil or Homer, or difficult passages in 'Scriptores Graeci' to\r\ntranslate, he or Lord Arthur Hervey was generally called up to edify\r\nthe class with quotations or translations.\"\r\n\r\nHe had no prizes at Eton except what is called being sent up for good,\r\non account of verses, and he was honored on several occasions. Besides\r\nhe took deep interest in starting a college periodical, and with some of\r\nthe most intellectual of the students sustained it with his pen. The\r\nmore studious of Eton boys have on several occasions in the present\r\ncentury been in the habit of establishing periodicals for the purpose of\r\nventilating their opinions. In 1786 Mr. Canning and Mr. Hookham Frere\r\nestablished the _Microcosm_, whose essays and _jeux d'esprit_, while\r\nhaving reference primarily to Eton, demonstrated that the writers were\r\nnot insensible to what was going on in the great world without. It was\r\nfor this college paper that Canning wrote his \"Essay on the Epic of the\r\nQueen of Hearts,\" which, as a burlesque criticism, has been awarded a\r\nhigh place in English literature. Lord Henry Spencer, Hookham Frere,\r\nCapel Lofft, and Mr. Millish, were also contributors to the columns of\r\nthe _Microcosm_. In the year 1820 W. Mackworth Praed set on foot a\r\nmanuscript journal, entitled _Apis Matina_. This was in turn succeeded\r\nby the _Etonian_, to which Praed contributed some of his most brilliant\r\nproductions. John Moultrie, Henry Nelson Coleridge, Walter Blunt, and\r\nChauncy Hare Townshend were also among the writers for its papers, who\r\nhelped to make it of exceptional excellence. Its articles are of no\r\nordinary interest even now.\r\n\r\nIn the last year of William E. Gladstone's stay at Eton, in 1827, and\r\nseven years after Praed's venture, he was largely instrumental in\r\nlaunching the _Eton Miscellany_, professedly edited by Bartholomew\r\nBouverie, and Mr. Gladstone became a most frequent, voluminous and\r\nvaluable contributor to its pages. He wrote articles of every\r\nkind--prologues, epilogues, leaders, historical essays, satirical\r\nsketches, classical translations, humorous productions, poetry and\r\nprose. And among the principal contributors with him were Sir Francis\r\nDoyle, George Selwyn, James Colville, Arthur Hallam, John Haumer and\r\nJames Milnes-Gaskell. The introduction, written by and signed \"William\r\nEwart Gladstone\" for this magazine, contained the following interesting\r\nand singular passage, which probably fairly sets forth the hopes and\r\nfears that beset statesmen in maturer years, as well as Eton boys of\r\nonly seventeen years of age:\r\n\r\n\"In my present undertaking there is one gulf in which I fear to sink,\r\nand that gulf is Lethe. There is one stream which I dread my inability\r\nto stem--it is the tide of Popular Opinion. I have ventured, and no\r\ndoubt rashly ventured--\r\n\r\n     Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\r\n     To try my fortune in a sea of glory,\r\n     But far beyond my depth.\"\r\n\r\nAt present it is hope alone that buoys me up; for more substantial\r\nsupport I must be indebted to my own exertions, well knowing that in\r\nthis land of literature merit never wants its reward. That such merit is\r\nmine I dare not presume to think; but still there is something within me\r\nthat bids me hope that I may be able to glide prosperously down the\r\nstream of public estimation; or, in the words of Virgil,\r\n\r\n     '--Celerare viam rumore secundo.'\r\n\r\n\"I was surprised even to see some works with the names of Shakespeare\r\nand Milton on them sharing the common destiny, but on examination I\r\nfound that those of the latter were some political rhapsodies, which\r\nrichly deserved their fate; and that the former consisted of some\r\neditions of his works which had been burdened with notes and mangled\r\nwith emendations by his merciless commentators. In other places I\r\nperceived authors worked up into frenzy by seeing their own compositions\r\ndescending like the rest. Often did the infuriated scribes extend their\r\nhands, and make a plunge to endeavor to save their beloved offspring,\r\nbut in vain; I pitied the anguish of their disappointment, but with\r\nfeelings of the same commiseration as that which one feels for a\r\nmalefactor on beholding his death, being at the same time fully\r\nconscious how well he has deserved it.\"\r\n\r\nLittle did this diffident and youthful editor imagine that he was\r\nforecasting the future for himself by the aid of youth's most ardent\r\ndesires, and that he would live to become the Primate of all England and\r\nthe foremost statesman of his day.\r\n\r\nThere were two volumes of the _Miscellany_, dated June-July and\r\nOctober-November, respectively, and Mr. Gladstone contributed thirteen\r\narticles to the first volume. Among the contributions were an \"Ode to\r\nthe Shade of Watt Tyler,\" a vigorous rendering of a chorus from the\r\nHucuba of Euripides, and a letter under the name of \"Philophantasm,\"\r\ndetailing an encounter he had with the poet Virgil, in which the great\r\npoet appeared muttering something which did not sound like Latin to an\r\nEton boy, and complaining that he knew he was hated by the Eton boys\r\nbecause he was difficult to learn, and pleading to be as well received\r\nhenceforth as Horace.\r\n\r\nWe give a quotation from a poem, consisting of some two hundred and\r\nfifty lines, from his pen, which, appeared also in the _Miscellany_:\r\n\r\n     \"Who foremost now the deadly spear to dart,\r\n      And strike the javelin to the Moslem's heart?\r\n      Who foremost now to climb the leaguered wall,\r\n      The first to triumph, or the first to fall?\r\n      Lo, where the Moslems rushing to the fight,\r\n      Back bear their squadrons in inglorious flight.\r\n      With plumed helmet, and with glittering lance,\r\n     'Tis Richard bids his steel-clad bands advance;\r\n     'Tis Richard stalks along the blood-dyed plain,\r\n      And views unmoved the slaying and the slain;\r\n     'Tis Richard bathes his hands in Moslem blood,\r\n      And tinges Jordan with the purple flood.\r\n      Yet where the timbrels ring, the trumpets sound,\r\n      And tramp of horsemen shakes the solid ground,\r\n      Though 'mid the deadly charge and rush of fight,\r\n      No thought be theirs of terror or of flight,--\r\n      Ofttimes a sigh will rise, a tear will flow,\r\n      And youthful bosoms melt in silent woe;\r\n      For who of iron frame and harder heart\r\n      Can bid the mem'ry of his home depart?\r\n      Tread the dark desert and the thirsty sand,\r\n      Nor give one thought to England's smiling land?\r\n      To scenes of bliss, and days of other years--\r\n      The Vale of Gladness and the Vale of Tears;\r\n      That, passed and vanish'd from their loving sight,\r\n      This 'neath their view, and wrapt in shades of night?\"\r\n\r\nAmong other writers who contributed to the first volume of the\r\n_Miscellany_ were Arthur Henry Hallam and Doyle, also G.A. Selwyn,\r\nafterwards Bishop Selwyn, the friend of Mr. Gladstone, and to whom he\r\nrecently paid the following tribute: \"Connected as tutor with families\r\nof rank and influence, universally popular from his frank, manly, and\r\nengaging character--and scarcely less so from his extraordinary rigor as\r\nan athlete--he was attached to Eton, where he resided, with a love\r\nsurpassing the love of Etonians. In himself he formed a large part of\r\nthe life of Eton, and Eton formed a large part of his life. To him is\r\ndue no small share of the beneficial movement in the direction of\r\nreligious earnestness which marked the Eton of forty years back, and\r\nwhich was not, in my opinion, sensibly affected by any influence\r\nextraneous to the place itself. At a moment's notice, upon the call of\r\nduty, he tore up the singularly deep roots which his life had struck\r\ndeep into the soil of England.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Gladstone and the future Bishop of Selwyn contributed humorous\r\nletters to \"The Postman,\" the correspondence department of the _Eton\r\nMiscellany_.\r\n\r\nIn the second volume of the _Eton Miscellany_ are articles of equal\r\ninterest to those that appeared in the first. Doyle, Jelf, Selwyn,\r\nShadwell and Arthur Henry Hallam were contributors, the latter having\r\nwritten \"The Battle of the Boyne,\" a parody upon Campbell's\r\n\"Hohenlinden.\" But here again Mr. Gladstone was the principal\r\ncontributor, having contributed to this even more largely than to the\r\nfirst, having written seventeen articles, besides the introductions to\r\nthe various numbers of the volume. Indeed one would think from his\r\ndevotion to these literary pursuits during his last year at Eton, that\r\nhe had very little leisure for those ordinary sports so necessary to\r\nEton boys. He seems to have begun his great literary activity. Among\r\nthem may be mentioned an \"Ode to the Shade of Watt Tyler,\" mentioned\r\nbefore, which is an example of his humorous style:\r\n\r\n     \"Shade of him whose valiant tongue\r\n      On high the song of freedom sung;\r\n      Shade of him, whose mighty soul\r\n      Would pay no taxes on his poll;\r\n      Though, swift as lightning, civic sword\r\n        Descended on thy fated head,\r\n      The blood of England's boldest poured,\r\n        And numbered Tyler with the dead!\r\n\r\n     \"Still may thy spirit flap its wings\r\n      At midnight o'er the couch of kings;\r\n      And peer and prelate tremble, too,\r\n      In dread of mighty interview!\r\n      With patriot gesture of command,\r\n        With eyes that like thy forges gleam,\r\n      Lest Tyler's voice and Tyler's hand\r\n        Be heard and seen in nightly dream.\r\n\r\n     \"I hymn the gallant and the good\r\n      From Tyler down to Thistlewood,\r\n      My muse the trophies grateful sings,\r\n      The deeds of Miller and of Ings;\r\n      She sings of all who, soon or late,\r\n        Have burst Subjection's iron chain,\r\n      Have seal'd the bloody despot's fate,\r\n        Or cleft a peer or priest in twain.\r\n\r\n     \"Shades, that soft Sedition woo,\r\n      Around the haunts of Peterloo!\r\n      That hover o'er the meeting-halls,\r\n      Where many a voice stentorian bawls!\r\n      Still flit the sacred choir around,\r\n        With 'Freedom' let the garrets ring,\r\n      And vengeance soon in thunder sound\r\n        On Church, and constable, and king.\"\r\n\r\nIn a paper on \"Eloquence,\" in the same volume, he shows that even then\r\nhis young mind was impressed by the fame attached to successful oratory\r\nin Parliament. Visions of glory and honor open before the enraptured\r\nsight of those devoted to oratorical pursuits, and whose ardent and\r\naspiring minds are directed to the House of Commons. Evidently the young\r\nwriter himself \"had visions of parliamentary oratory, and of a\r\nsuccessful _debut_ in the House of Commons, with perhaps an offer from\r\nthe Minister, a Secretaryship of State, and even the Premiership itself\r\nin the distance.\" But then there are barriers to pass and ordeals to\r\nundergo. \"There are roars of coughing, as well as roars of cheering\"\r\nfrom the members of the House, \"and maiden speeches sometimes act more\r\nforcibly on the lungs of hearers than the most violent or most cutting\r\nof all the breezes which AEOLUS can boast.\" But the writer draws comfort\r\nfrom the fact that Lord Morfeth, Edward Geoffrey, Stanley and Lord\r\nCastlereagh who were all members of the Eton college debating society\r\nwere then among the most successful young speakers in Parliament. This\r\nsounds more like prophecy than dreams, for within a very few years after\r\nwriting this article the writer himself had passed the dreaded barrier\r\nand endured the ordeal, and had not only made his appearance in the\r\nHouse of Commons, but had been invited to fill an honorable place in the\r\nCabinet of the Ministry then in power.\r\n\r\nAnother contribution of Mr. Gladstone's to the _Miscellany_, and perhaps\r\nthe most meritorious of the youthful writer's productions, was\r\nentitled, \"Ancient and Modern Genius Compared,\" in which the young\r\nEtonian editor ardently and affectionately apostrophized the memory of\r\nCanning, his father's great friend and his own ideal man and statesman,\r\nwho had just then perished untimely and amid universal regret. In this\r\narticle he first takes the part of the moderns as against the ancients,\r\nthough he by no means deprecates the genius of the latter, and then\r\neloquently apostrophizes the object of his youthful hero-worship, the\r\nimmortal Canning, whose death he compares to that of the lamented Pitt.\r\nThe following are extracts from this production:\r\n\r\n\"It is for those who revered him in the plenitude of his meridian glory\r\nto mourn over him in the darkness of his premature extinction: to mourn\r\nover the hopes that are buried in his grave, and the evils that arise\r\nfrom his withdrawing from the scene of life. Surely if eloquence never\r\nexcelled and seldom equalled--if an expanded mind and judgment whose\r\nvigor was paralleled only by its soundness--if brilliant wit--if a\r\nglowing imagination--if a warm heart, and an unbending firmness--could\r\nhave strengthened the frail tenure, and prolonged the momentary duration\r\nof human existence, that man had been immortal! But nature could endure\r\nno longer. Thus has Providence ordained that inasmuch as the intellect\r\nis more brilliant, it shall be more short-lived; as its sphere is more\r\nexpanded, more swiftly is it summoned away. Lest we should give to man\r\nthe honor due to God--lest we should exalt the object of our admiration\r\ninto a divinity for our worship--He who calls the weary and the mourner\r\nto eternal rest hath been pleased to remove him from our eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The degrees of inscrutable wisdom are unknown to us; but if ever there\r\nwas a man for whose sake it was meet to indulge the kindly though frail\r\nfeelings of our nature--for whom the tear of sorrow was to us both\r\nprompted by affection and dictated by duty--that man was\r\nGeorge Canning.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Hallam, Selwyn and other contributors to the _Miscellany_ left\r\nEton, at midsummer, 1827, Mr. Gladstone still remained and became the\r\nmainstay of the magazine. \"Mr. Gladstone and I remained behind as its\r\nmain supporters,\" writes Sir Francis Doyle, \"or rather it would be more\r\nlike the truth if I said that Mr. Gladstone supported the whole burden\r\nupon his own shoulders. I was unpunctual and unmethodical, so were his\r\nother vassals; and the '_Miscellany_' would have fallen to the ground\r\nbut for Mr. Gladstone's untiring energy, pertinacity and tact.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Gladstone labored in editorial work upon the _Miscellany_,\r\nyet he took time to bestow attention upon his duties in the Eton\r\nSociety of the College, learnedly called \"The Literati,\" and vulgarly\r\ncalled \"Pop,\" and took a leading part in the debates and in the private\r\nbusiness of the Society. The Eton Society of Gladstone's day was a\r\nbrilliant group of boys. He introduced desirable new members, moved for\r\nmore readable and instructive newspapers, proposing new rules for better\r\norder and more decorous conduct, moving fines on those guilty of\r\ndisorder or breaches of the rules, and paying a fine imposed upon\r\nhimself for putting down an illegal question. \"In debate he champions\r\nthe claims of metaphysics against those of mathematics, and defends\r\naristocracy against democracy;\" confesses innate feelings of dislike to\r\nthe French; protests against disarmament of the Highlanders as\r\ninexpedient and unjust; deplores the fate of Strafford and the action of\r\nthe House of Commons, which he claimed they should be able to \"revere as\r\nour glory and confide in as our protection.\" The meetings of the Eton\r\nSociety were held over Miss Hatton's \"sock-shop.\"\r\n\r\nIn politics its members were Tory--intensely so, and although current\r\npolitics were forbidden subjects, yet, political opinions were disclosed\r\nin discussions of historical or academical questions. \"The execution of\r\nStrafford and Charles I, the characters of Oliver Cromwell and Milton,\r\nthe 'Central Social' of Rousseau, and the events of the French\r\nRevolution, laid bare the speakers' political tendencies as effectually\r\nas if the conduct of Queen Caroline, the foreign policy of Lord\r\nCastlereagh, or the repeal of the Test and Corporation Act had been the\r\nsubject of debate.\"\r\n\r\nIt was October 15, 1825, when Gladstone was elected a member of the Eton\r\nSociety, and on the 29th of the same month made his maiden speech on the\r\nquestion \"Is the education of the poor on the whole beneficial?\" It is\r\nrecorded in the minutes of the meeting that \"Mr. Gladstone rose and\r\neloquently addressed the house.\" He spoke in favor of education; and one\r\nwho heard him says that his opening words were, \"Sir, in this age of\r\nincreased and increasing civilization.\" Says an eminent writer, by way\r\nof comment upon these words, \"It almost oppresses the imagination to\r\npicture the shoreless sea of eloquence which rolls between that exordium\r\nand the oratory to which we still are listening and hope to listen for\r\nyears to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"The peroration of his speech on the question whether Queen Anne's\r\nMinisters, in the last four years of her reign, deserved well of their\r\ncountry, is so characteristic, both in substance and in form,\" that we\r\nreproduce it here from Dr, Russell's work on Gladstone:\r\n\r\n\"Thus much, sir, I have said, as conceiving myself bound in fairness not\r\nto regard the names under which men have hidden their designs so much\r\nas the designs themselves. I am well aware that my prejudices and my\r\npredilections have long been enlisted on the side of Toryism (cheers)\r\nand that in a cause like this I am not likely to be influenced unfairly\r\nagainst men bearing that name and professing to act on the principles\r\nwhich I have always been accustomed to revere. But the good of my\r\ncountry must stand on a higher ground than distinctions like these. In\r\ncommon fairness and in common candor, I feel myself compelled to give my\r\ndecisive verdict against the conduct of men whose measures I firmly\r\nbelieve to have been hostile to British interests, destructive of\r\nBritish glory, and subversive of the splendid and, I trust, lasting\r\nfabric of the British constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the diary of William Cowper, afterwards Lord\r\nMount-Temple, we also reproduce from the same author: \"On Saturday,\r\nOctober 27, 1827, the subject for debate was:\r\n\r\n\"'Whether the deposition of Richard II was justifiable or not.' Jelf\r\nopened; not a good speech. Doyle spoke _extempore_, made several\r\nmistakes, which were corrected by Jelf. Gladstone spoke well. The Whigs\r\nwere regularly floored; only four Whigs to eleven Tories, but they very\r\nnearly kept up with them in coughing and 'hear, hears,' Adjourned to\r\nMonday after 4.\r\n\r\n\"Monday, 29.--Gladstone finished his speech, and ended with a great deal\r\nof flattery of Doyle, saying that he was sure he would have courage\r\nenough to own that he was wrong. It succeeded. Doyle rose amidst\r\nreiterated cheers to own that he was convinced by the arguments of the\r\nother side. He had determined before to answer them and cut up\r\nGladstone!\r\n\r\n\"December 1.--Debate, 'Whether the Peerage Bill of 1719 was calculated\r\nto be beneficial or not.' Thanks voted to Doyle and Gladstone; the\r\nlatter spoke well; will be a great loss to the Society.\"\r\n\r\nThere were many boys at Eton--schoolfellows of Mr. Gladstone--who became\r\nmen of note in after days. Among them the Hallams, Charles Canning,\r\nafterwards Lord Canning and Governor-General of India; Walter Hamilton,\r\nBishop of Salisbury; Edward Hamilton, his brother, of Charters; James\r\nHope, afterwards Hope-Scott; James Bruce, afterwards Lord Elgin; James\r\nMilnes-Gaskell, M.P. for Wenlock; Henry Denison; Sir Francis Doyle;\r\nAlexander Kinglake; George Selwyn, Bishop of New Zealand and of\r\nLitchfield; Lord Arthur Hervey, Bishop of Bath and Wells; William\r\nCavendish, Duke of Devonshire; George Cornwallis Lewis; Frederic\r\nTennyson; Gerald Wellesley, Dean of Windsor; Spencer Walpole, Home\r\nSecretary; Frederic Rogers, Lord Blachford; James Colvile, Chief Justice\r\nat Calcutta, and others.\r\n\r\nBy universal acknowledgment the most remarkable youth at Eton in that\r\nday was Arthur Hallam, \"in mind and character not unworthy of the\r\nmagnificent eulogy of 'In Memoriam.'\" He was the most intimate friend of\r\nyoung Gladstone. They always took breakfast together, although they\r\nboarded apart in different houses, and during the separation of\r\nvacations they were diligent correspondents.\r\n\r\nThe father of William E. Gladstone, as we have seen, discovered\r\npremonitions of future greatness in his son, and we may well ask the\r\nquestion what impression was made by him upon his fellow school-mates at\r\nEton. Arthur Hallam wrote: \"Whatever may be our lot, I am confident that\r\n_he_ is a bud that will bloom with a richer fragrance than almost any\r\nwhose early promise I have witnessed.\"\r\n\r\nJames Milnes-Gaskell says: \"Gladstone is no ordinary individual; and\r\nperhaps if I were called on to select the individual I am intimate with\r\nto whom I should first turn in an emergency, and whom I thought in every\r\nway pre-eminently distinguished for high excellence, I think I should\r\nturn to Gladstone. If you finally decide in favor of Cambridge, my\r\nseparation from Gladstone will be a source of great sorrow to me.\" And\r\nthe explanation of this latter remark is that the writer's mother wanted\r\nhim to go to Cambridge, while he wished to go to Oxford, because\r\nGladstone was going there.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Doyle writes: \"I may as well remark that my father, a man of\r\ngreat ability, as well as of great experience of life, predicted\r\nGladstone's future eminence from the manner in which he handled this\r\nsomewhat tiresome business. [The editorial work and management of the\r\n_Eton Miscellany._] 'It is not' he remarked, 'that I think his papers\r\nbetter than yours or Hallam's--that is not my meaning at all; but the\r\nforce of character he has shown in managing his subordinates, and the\r\ncombination of ability and power that he has made evident, convince me\r\nthat such a young man cannot fail to distinguish himself hereafter.'\"\r\n\r\nThe recreations of young Gladstone were not in all respects like his\r\nschool-mates. He took no part in games, for he had no taste in that\r\ndirection, and while his companions were at play he was studiously\r\nemployed in his room. One of the boys afterwards declared, \"without\r\nchallenge or contradiction, that he was never seen to run.\" Yet he had\r\nhis diversions and was fond of sculling, and kept a \"lock-up,\" or\r\nprivate boat, for his own use. He liked walking for exercise, and walked\r\nfast and far. His chief amusement when not writing, reading or debating,\r\nwas to ramble among the delights of Windsor with a few intimate friends;\r\nand he had only a few whom he admitted to his inner circle. To others\r\nbeyond he was not known and was not generally popular. Gladstone,\r\nCharles Canning, Handley, Bruce, Hodgson, Lord Bruce and Milnes-Gaskell\r\nset up a Salt Hill Club. They met every whole holiday or half-holiday,\r\nas was convenient, after twelve, \"and went up to Salt Hill to bully the\r\nfat waiter, eat toasted cheese, and drink egg-wine.\" It is startling to\r\nhear from such an authority as James Milnes-Gaskell that \"in all our\r\nmeetings, as well as at almost every time, Gladstone went by the name of\r\nMr. Tipple.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe strongest testimony is borne to the moral character of young\r\nGladstone while at Eton. By common consent he was pre-eminently\r\nGod-fearing, orderly and conscientious. Bishop Hamilton, of Salisbury,\r\nwrites: \"At Eton I was a thoroughly idle boy; but I was saved from some\r\nworse things by getting to know Gladstone.\" This is the strong testimony\r\nof one school-boy after he has reached maturity and distinction for\r\nanother. \"To have exercised, while still a school-boy, an influence for\r\ngood upon one of the greatest of contemporary saints, is surely such a\r\ndistinction as few Prime Ministers ever attain.\"\r\n\r\nTwo stories are told of him while at Eton that go to show the moral\r\ndetermination of the boy to do right. On one occasion he turned his\r\nglass upside down and refused to drink a coarse toast proposed,\r\naccording to annual custom, at an election dinner at the \"Christopher\r\nInn.\" This shows the purity of his mind, but there is another\r\nillustrating the humane feeling in his heart. He came forth as the\r\nchampion of some miserable pigs which it was the inhumane custom to\r\ntorture at Eton Fair on Ash Wednesday, and when he was bantered by his\r\nschool-fellows for his humanity, he offered to write his reply \"in good\r\nround hand upon their faces.\"\r\n\r\nAt Christmas, 1827, Gladstone left Eton, and after that studied six\r\nmonths under private tutors, Dr. Turner, afterwards Bishop of Calcutta,\r\nbeing one. Of this Mr. Gladstone writes: \"I resided with Dr. Turner at\r\nWilmslow (in Cheshire) from January till a few months later. My\r\nresidence with him was cut off by his appointment to the Bishopric of\r\nCalcutta.... My companions were the present (1877) Bishop of Sodor and\r\nMan, and Sir C.A. Wood, Deputy-Chairman of the G.W. Railway. We employed\r\nour spare time in gymnastics, in turning, and in rambles. I remember\r\npaying a visit to Macclesfield. In a silk factory the owner showed us\r\nhis silk handkerchiefs, and complained much of Mr. Huskisson for having\r\nremoved the prohibition of the foreign article. The thought passed\r\nthrough my mind at the time: Why make laws to enable people to produce\r\narticles of such hideous pattern and indifferent quality as this?\r\nAlderly Edge was a favorite place of resort. We dined with Sir John\r\nStanley (at Alderly) on the day when the king's speech was received; and\r\nI recollect that he ridiculed (I think very justly) the epithet\r\n_untoward_, which was applied in it to the Battle of Navarino.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1828, and after two years as a private pupil of Dr. Turner, Mr.\r\nGladstone entered Christ Church College, Oxford and in the following\r\nyear was nominated to a studentship on the foundation. Although he had\r\nno prizes at Oxford of the highest class, unless honors in the schools\r\nbe so called--and in this respect he achieved a success which falls to\r\nthe lot of but few students. In the year 1831, when he went up for his\r\nfinal examination, he completed his academical education by attaining\r\nthe highest honors in the university--graduating double-first-class.\r\n\r\nOf the city of Oxford, where Oxford University is situated, Matthew\r\nArnold writes: \"Beautiful city! So venerable, so lovely, so unravaged by\r\nthe fierce intellectual life of our century, so serene! And yet, steeped\r\nin sentiment as she lies, spreading her gardens to the moonlight, or\r\nwhispering from her towers the last enchantments of the Middle Age, who\r\nwill deny that Oxford, by her ineffable charm, keeps ever calling us\r\nnear to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to perfection--to\r\nbeauty, in a word, which is only truth seen from another side.\"\r\n\r\nDescribing Christ Church College, a writer has said that there is no\r\nother College where a man has so great a choice of society, or a man\r\nentire freedom in choosing it.\r\n\r\nAs to the studies required, a greater stress was laid upon a knowledge\r\nof the Bible and of the evidences of Christianity than upon classical\r\nliterature; some proficiency was required also, either in mathematics or\r\nthe science of reasoning. The system of education accommodated itself to\r\nthe capacity and wants of the students, but the man of talent was at no\r\nloss as to a field for his exertions, or a reward for his industry. The\r\nhonors of the ministry were all within his reach. In the cultivation of\r\ntaste and general information Oxford afforded every opportunity, but the\r\nmodern languages were not taught.\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact is related of young Gladstone when he entered\r\nOxford, as to his studies at the university. He wrote his father that he\r\ndisliked mathematics, and that he intended to concentrate his time and\r\nattention upon the classics. This was a great blow to his father, who\r\nreplied that he did not think a man was a man unless he knew\r\nmathematics. The dutiful son yielded to his father's wishes, abandoned\r\nhis own plan, and applied himself with energy and success to the study\r\nof mathematics. But for this change of study he might not have become\r\nthe greatest of Chancellors of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nGladstone's instructors at Oxford were men of reputation. Rev. Robert\r\nBiscoe, whose lectures on Aristotle attracted some of the best men to\r\nthe university, was his tutor; he attended the lectures of Dr. Burton on\r\nDivinity, and of Dr. Pusey on Hebrew, and read classics privately with\r\nBishop Wordsworth. He read steadily but not laboriously. Nothing was\r\never allowed to interfere with his morning's work. He read for four\r\nhours, and then took a walk. Though not averse to company and suppers,\r\nyet he always read for two or three hours before bedtime.\r\n\r\nAmong the undergraduates at Oxford then, who became conspicuous, were\r\nHenry Edward Manning, afterwards Cardinal Archbishop; Archibald Campbell\r\nTait, Archbishop of Canterbury; Sidney Herbert, Robert Lowe, Lord\r\nSherbrooke, and Lord Selborne. \"The man who _took_ me most,\" says a\r\nvisitor to Oxford in 1829, \"was the youngest Gladstone of Liverpool--I\r\nam sure a very superior person.\"\r\n\r\nGladstone's chosen friends were all steady and industrious men, and many\r\nof them were more distinctively religious than is generally found in the\r\nlife of undergraduates. And his choice of associates in this respect was\r\nthe subject of criticism on the part of a more secularly minded student\r\nwho wrote, \"Gladstone has mixed himself up with the St. Mary Hall and\r\nOriel set, who are really, for the most part, only fit to live with\r\nmaiden aunts and keep tame rabbits.\" And the question, Which was\r\nright--Gladstone or the student? may be answered by another, Which one\r\nbecame Prime Minister of England?\r\n\r\n\"Gladstone's first rooms were in the 'old library,' near the hall; but\r\nfor the greater part of his time he occupied the right-hand rooms on the\r\nfirst floor of the first staircase, on the right as the visitor enters\r\nCanterbury gate. He was, alike in study and in conduct, a model\r\nundergraduate, and the great influence of his character and talents was\r\nused with manly resolution against the riotous conduct of the 'Tufts,'\r\nwhose brutality caused the death of one of their number in 1831. We read\r\nthis note in the correspondence of a friend: 'I heard from Gladstone\r\nyesterday; he says that the number of gentlemen commoners has increased,\r\nis increasing, and ought to be diminished.' Every one who has\r\nexperienced the hubristic qualities of the Tufted race, and its\r\nsatellites, will cordially sympathize with this sentiment of an orderly\r\nand industrious undergraduate. He was conspicuously moderate in the use\r\nof wine. His good example in this respect affected not only his\r\ncontemporaries but also his successors at the university; men who\r\nfollowed him to Oxford ten years later found it still operative, and\r\ndeclare that undergraduates drank less in the forties, because Gladstone\r\nhad been courageously abstemious in the thirties.\"\r\n\r\nBut there were those who better estimated Gladstone's worth and looked\r\napprovingly upon his course, as \"the blameless schoolboy became the\r\nblameless undergraduate; diligent, sober, regular alike in study and\r\ndevotion, giving his whole energies to the duties of the place, and\r\nquietly abiding in the religious faith in which he had been trained.\r\nBishop Charles Wordsworth said that no man of his standing in the\r\nuniversity habitually read his Bible more or knew it better. Cardinal\r\nManning described him walking in the university with his 'Bible and\r\nPrayer-book tucked under his arm.' ... He quitted Oxford with a\r\nreligious belief still untinctured by Catholic theology. But the great\r\nchange was not far distant, and he had already formed some of the\r\nfriendships which, in their development were destined to effect so\r\nprofoundly the course of his religious thought.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the religious and political opinions and influences\r\nprevailing at Oxford, it may be remarked that the atmosphere of Oxford\r\nwas calculated to strengthen Mr. Gladstone's conservative views, and did\r\nhave this effect, and as English statesmen had not then learned to put\r\ntheir trust in the people, the cause of reform found few or no friends\r\nat the university, and he was among those hostile to it, and was known\r\nfor his pronounced Tory and High Church opinions.\r\n\r\nHe belonged to the famous debating society known as the Oxford Union,\r\nwas a brilliant debater, and in 1831 was its secretary, and later its\r\npresident. On various occasions he carried, by a majority of one only, a\r\nmotion that the Wellington Administration was undeserving of the\r\nconfidence of the country; he defended the results of the Catholic\r\nEmancipation; he opposed a motion for the removal of Jewish\r\ndisabilities, and he persuaded 94 students out of 130 to condemn Earl\r\nGrey's Reform Bill as a measure \"which threatened not only to change the\r\nform of government, but ultimately to break up the very foundation of\r\nsocial order.\" His last speech at Oxford was in support of his own\r\namendment to a motion for the immediate emancipation of the slaves in\r\nthe West Indies. On a certain occasion he entertained a party of\r\nstudents from Cambridge, consisting of Sir Francis Doyle, Monckton\r\nMilnes, Sunderland, and Arthur H. Hallam, who discussed among them the\r\nsuperiority of Shelley over Byron as a poet. The motion was opposed by\r\none Oxonion, the late Cardinal Manning, but Shelley received 90 votes to\r\n33 for Byron.\r\n\r\nOne who heard the debate on the Reform Bill says that \"it converted\r\nAlston, the son of the member in Parliament for Hertford, who\r\nimmediately on the conclusion of Gladstone's speech walked across from\r\nthe Whig to the Tory side of the house, amidst loud acclamations.\"\r\nAnother who was present writes, \"Most of the speakers rose, more or\r\nless, above their usual level, but when Mr. Gladstone sat down we all of\r\nus felt that an epoch in our lives had occurred. It certainly was the\r\nfinest speech of his that I ever heard.\" And Bishop Charles Wordsworth\r\nwrites his experience of Mr. Gladstone at this time, \"made me feel no\r\nless sure than of my own existence that Gladstone, our then\r\nChrist-Church undergraduate, would one day rise to be Prime Minister\r\nof England.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1832 Mr. Gladstone quitted Oxford. In summing up\r\nresults it may be said, in the language of Mr. Russell: \"Among the\r\npurely intellectual effects produced on Mr. Gladstone by the discipline\r\nof Oxford, it is obvious to reckon an almost excessive exactness in the\r\nstatement of propositions, a habit of rigorous definition, a microscopic\r\ncare in the choice of words, and a tendency to analyze every sentiment\r\nand every phrase, and to distinguish with intense precaution between\r\nstatements almost exactly similar. From Aristotle and Bishop Butler and\r\nEdmund Burke he learned the value of authority, the sacredness of law,\r\nthe danger of laying rash and inconsiderate hands upon the ark of State.\r\nIn the political atmosphere of Oxford he was taught to apply these\r\nprinciples to the civil events of his time, to dread innovation, to\r\nrespect existing institutions, and to regard the Church and the Throne\r\nas inseparably associated by Divine ordinance.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gladstone's London Home]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY PARLIAMENTARY EXPERIENCES\r\n\r\nIt is customary for the sons of gentlemen who graduate at Cambridge and\r\nOxford to spend some time in travel on the continent upon the completion\r\nof their university studies. The custom was observed in Mr. Gladstone's\r\nearly days even more than at the present. In accordance then with the\r\nprevailing usage he went abroad after graduating at Oxford. In the\r\nspring of 1832 he started on his travels and spent nearly the whole of\r\nthe next six months in Italy, \"learning the language, studying the art,\r\nand revelling in the natural beauties of that glorious land.\" In the\r\nfollowing September, however, he was suddenly recalled to England to\r\nenter upon his first Parliamentary campaign.\r\n\r\nAt Oxford Toryism prevailed, and was of the old-fashioned type, far\r\nremoved from the utilitarian conservatism of the present day. Charles I\r\nwas a saint and a martyr, the claims of rank and birth were admitted\r\nwith a childlike simplicity, the high functions of government were the\r\nbirthright of the few, and the people had nothing to do with the laws,\r\nexcept to obey them. Mr. Gladstone was a Tory. The political views he\r\nheld upon leaving Oxford had much to do with his recall from abroad and\r\nhis running for a seat in the House of Commons. Of these opinions held\r\nby him then, and afterwards repudiated, he, in a speech delivered at the\r\nopening of the Palmerston Club, Oxford, in December, 1878, says: \"I\r\ntrace in the education of Oxford of my own time one great defect.\r\nPerhaps it was my own fault; but I must admit that I did not learn, when\r\nat Oxford, that which I have learned since, viz., to set a due value on\r\nthe imperishable and inestimable principles of human liberty. The temper\r\nwhich, I think, too much prevailed in academic circles, was that liberty\r\nwas regarded with jealousy and fear, which could not be wholly dispensed\r\nwith, but which was continually to be watched for fear of excess.... I\r\nthink that the principle of the Conservative party is jealousy of\r\nliberty and of the people, only qualified by fear; but I think the\r\npolicy of the Liberal party is trust in the people, only qualified by\r\nprudence. I can only assure you, gentlemen, that now I am in front of\r\nextended popular privileges. I have no fear of those enlargements of the\r\nConstitution that seem to be approaching. On the contrary, I hail them\r\nwith desire. I am not in the least degree conscious that I have less\r\nreverence for antiquity, for the beautiful, and good, and glorious\r\ncharges that our ancestors have handed down to us as a patrimony to our\r\nrace, than I had in other days when I held other political opinions. I\r\nhave learnt to set the true value upon human liberty, and in whatever I\r\nhave changed, there, and there only, has been the explanation of\r\nthe change.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Gladstone's Tory principles that led to an invitation from\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, whose son, the Earl of Lincoln, afterwards a\r\nmember of Lord Aberdeen's Cabinet during the Crimean War, had been his\r\nschoolmate at Eton and Oxford, and his intimate friend; to return to\r\nEngland and to contest the representation of Newark in Parliament. In\r\naccordance with this summons he hurried home.\r\n\r\nLet us review the national situation. It was a time of general alarm and\r\nuncertainty, from political unrest, commercial stagnation, and\r\ndevastating pestilence. \"The terrors of the time begat a hundred forms\r\nof strange fanaticism; and among men who were not fanatics there was a\r\ndeep and wide conviction that national judgments were overtaking\r\nnational sins, and that the only hope of safety for England lay in a\r\nreturn to that practical recognition of religion in the political sphere\r\nat the proudest moments of English history. 'The beginning and the end\r\nof what is the matter with us in these days,' wrote Carlyle, 'is that we\r\nhave forgotten God.'\"\r\n\r\nEngland was in a condition of great political excitement and expectancy.\r\nOne of the greatest battles in Parliamentary history had just been\r\nfought and won by the people. The Reform Bill, which admitted large\r\nclasses, hitherto unrepresented, to the right of citizenship, had\r\npassed, after a long struggle, during which law and order were defied\r\nand riots prevailed in various parts of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe King clearly perceiving that the wish of the people could no longer\r\nbe disregarded with safety, and heedless of the advice of the\r\naristocracy, gave his assent to the measure. This bill, which became a\r\nlaw June 7, 1832, \"transformed the whole of the Electoral arrangements\r\nof the United Kingdom.\" It was demanded that the King be present in the\r\nHouse of Lords to witness the ceremony of the subjugation of his crown\r\nand peers, as it was deemed, but the King, feeling he had yielded enough\r\nto the popular will, refused. Walpole, in his history, writes: \"King and\r\nQueen sat sullenly apart in their palace. Peer and country gentleman\r\nmoodily awaited the ruin of their country and the destruction of their\r\nproperty. Fanaticism still raved at the wickedness of a people; the\r\npeople, clamoring for work, still succumbed before the mysterious\r\ndisease which was continually claiming more and more victims. But the\r\nnation cared not for the sullenness of the Court, the forebodings of the\r\nlanded classes, the ravings of the pulpit, or even the mysterious\r\noperations of a new plague. The deep gloom that had overshadowed the\r\nland had been relieved by one single ray. The victory had been won. The\r\nbill had become law.\"\r\n\r\nThe first reformed House of Commons, after the passage of the terrible\r\nReform Bill, met and was looked upon by some of the friends of Reform\r\nwith fond hopes and expectations, and by others, the Tories, with fear\r\nand apprehension. The poor looked upon the Reform Bill as a measure for\r\ntheir redemption, and the landed proprietors regarded it as the first\r\nsign of departed national greatness. Both classes were disappointed. It\r\nneither revived business nor despoiled owners. The result was a surprise\r\nto politicians of both parties. The Reformers did not, as was\r\nanticipated, carry their extreme measures, and the Tories did not\r\nrealize the great losses they expected. While the Ministry preserved its\r\npower and even obtained some victories in England and Scotland, it\r\nsustained serious defeats in Ireland. In England many earnest and\r\npopular friends of Reform were defeated in the election, and some\r\ncounties, among them Bristol, Stamford, Hertford, Norwich and Newark,\r\nwere pronounced against the Ministry.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Newcastle, who was one of the chief potentates of the high\r\nTory party, and had lost his control of Newark in 1831, by the election\r\nof a Radical, was determined to regain it. He regarded it as his right\r\nto be represented in the House of Commons, or that Newark should elect\r\nwhom he nominated. And he had propounded the memorable political maxim,\r\n\"Have I not a right to do what I like with my own?\" The Duke wanted a\r\ncapable candidate to help him regain his ascendency. His son, Lord\r\nLincoln, here came to his aid. He had heard the remarkable speech of his\r\nfriend, Mr. Gladstone, in the Oxford Union, against the Reform Bill, and\r\nhad written home regarding him, that \"a man had uprisen in Israel.\" At\r\nhis suggestion the Duke invited the young graduate of Oxford to run as\r\nthe Tory candidate for a seat in Parliament from Newark. The wisdom of\r\nthis selection for the accomplishment of the purpose in view, was fully\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Lobby of the House of Commons]\r\n\r\nHis personal appearance at this time may be thus described: He was\r\nsomewhat robust. His youthful face bore none of those deep furrows which\r\nhave rendered his countenance so remarkable in maturer years. But there\r\nwas the same broad intellectual forehead, the massive nose, the same\r\nanxious eyes and the earnest enthusiasm of later years. His look was\r\nbright and thoughtful and his bearing attractive. He was handsome and\r\npossessed a most intelligent and expressive countenance. Says his\r\nbiographer, Mr. Russell: \"William Ewart Gladstone was now twenty-two\r\nyears old, with a physical constitution of unequalled vigor, the\r\nprospect of ample fortune, great and varied knowledge, and a natural\r\ntendency to political theorization, and an inexhaustible copiousness and\r\nreadiness of speech. In person he was striking and attractive, with\r\nstrongly marked features, a pale complexion, abundance of dark hair and\r\neyes of piercing lustre. People who judged only by his external aspect\r\nconsidered that he was delicate.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Gladstone found two opponents contesting with him to represent\r\nNewark in Parliament, W.F. Handley and Sergeant Wilde, afterwards Lord\r\nChancellor Truro. The latter was an advanced Liberal and had\r\nunsuccessfully contested the borough in 1829 and 1830, and had in\r\nconsideration of his defeat received from his sympathetic friends a\r\npiece of plate inscribed: \"By his ardent friends, the Blue electors of\r\nthe borough, who by their exertions and sufferings in the cause of\r\nindependence, largely conduced to awaken the attention of the nation to\r\nthe necessity of Reform in Parliament. Upon this humble token of respect\r\n(contributed in the hour of defeat) the Blue electors of Newark inscribe\r\ntheir sense of the splendid ability, unwearied perseverance, and\r\ndisinterested public spirit displayed by Sergeant Wilde in maintaining\r\nthe two contests of 1829 and 1830, in order to emancipate the borough\r\nfrom political thraldoms, and restore to its inhabitants the free\r\nexercise of their long-lost rights.\" But Sergeant Wilde was more\r\nsuccessful the following year, 1831, when the \"Reform fever\" was at its\r\nheight, and defeated the Duke of Newcastle's nominee and became member\r\nof the House of Commons for the borough. These facts made the coming\r\nelection, which followed the passage of the Reform Bill, of unusual\r\ninterest, to those concerned, and the struggle would be of a close and\r\ndetermined character.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone entered upon the contest with his experienced, able and\r\npopular antagonist, with much against him, for he was young, unknown and\r\nuntried; but his youth and personal appearance and manly bearing were in\r\nhis favor, and these, with his eloquence and ready wit, gained for him\r\nmany friends. His speeches demonstrated that he lacked neither\r\narguments, nor words wherewith to clothe them. He needed, however, to\r\ncall into requisition all his abilities, for Sergeant Wilde was a\r\npowerful antagonist, and had no thought of being displaced by his\r\nyouthful opponent, \"a political stripling,\" as he called him, without a\r\ndesperate struggle. But Mr. Gladstone had behind him the ducal influence\r\nand the support of the Red Club, so he entered upon the contest with\r\nenergy and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe young Tory's first election address was delivered upon this\r\noccasion. It was dated October 9th, 1832, was all such an address should\r\nbe, and was addressed, \"To the worthy and independent electors of the\r\nborough of Newark.\" It began by saying that he was bound in his opinions\r\nby no man and no party, but that he deprecated the growing unreasonable\r\nand indiscriminating desire for change then so common, but confessed\r\nthat labor has a right to \"receive adequate remuneration.\" On the\r\nquestion of human slavery, then greatly agitated, he remarked, \"We are\r\nagreed that both the physical and the moral bondage of the slave are to\r\nbe abolished. The question is as to the _order_, and the order only; now\r\nScripture attacks the moral evil _before_ the corporal one, the corporal\r\none _through_ the moral one, and I am content with the order which\r\nScripture has established.\" He saw insurmountable obstacles against\r\nimmediate emancipation, one of which was that the negro would exchange\r\nthe evil now affecting him for greater ones--for a relapse into deeper\r\ndebasement, if not for bloodshed and internal war.\r\n\r\nHe therefore advocated a system of Christian education, to make the\r\nnegro slaves fit for emancipation and to prepare them for freedom, Then,\r\nhe argued, without bloodshed and the violation of property rights, and\r\nwith unimpaired benefit to the negro, the desirable end might be reached\r\nin the utter extinction of slavery.\r\n\r\nOf this appropriate address, so important in the light of coming events,\r\nwe quote two paragraphs in full. In speaking of existing evils and the\r\nremedies for them, he observed: \"For the mitigation of these evils, we\r\nmust, I think, look not only to particular measures, but to the\r\nrestoration of sounder general principles. I mean especially that\r\nprinciple on which alone the incorporation of Religion with the State in\r\nour Constitution can be defended; that the duties of governors are\r\nstrictly and peculiarly religious; and that legislatures, like\r\nindividuals, are bound to carry throughout their acts the spirit of the\r\nhigh truths they have acknowledged. Principles are now arrayed against\r\nour institutions; and not by truckling nor by temporizing--not by\r\noppression nor corruption--but by principles they must be met.\r\n\r\n\"And now, gentlemen, as regards the enthusiasm with which you have\r\nrallied round your ancient flag, and welcomed the humble representative\r\nof those principles whose emblem it is, I trust that neither the lapse\r\nof time nor the seductions of prosperity can ever efface it from my\r\nmemory. To my opponents, my acknowledgments are due for the good humor\r\nand kindness with which they have received me; and while I would thank\r\nmy friends for their jealous and unwearied exertions in my favor, I\r\nbriefly but emphatically assure them, that if promises be an adequate\r\nfoundation of confidence, or experience a reasonable ground of\r\ncalculation, our victory _is sure_\"\r\n\r\nThe new candidate for Parliamentary honors was \"heckled,\" as it is\r\ncalled, at the hustings, or was interrupted continually while speaking,\r\nand questioned by his opponents as to the circumstances of his\r\ncandidature, his father's connection with slavery, and his own views of\r\ncapital punishment. From his first appearance in Newark, Mr. Gladstone\r\nhad been subjected to these examinations and he stood the ordeal well\r\nand answered prudently. An instance of this is given. A Radical elector,\r\nMr. Gillson, asked the young Tory candidate if he was the Duke of\r\nNewcastle's nominee, and was met by Mr. Gladstone demanding the\r\nquestioner's definition of the term \"nominee.\" Mr. Gillson replied that\r\nhe meant a person sent by the Duke of Newcastle to be pushed down the\r\nthroats of the voters whether they would or not. But Mr. Gladstone was\r\nequal to the occasion, and said according to that definition he was not\r\nthe nominee of the Duke, but came to Newark by the invitation of the Red\r\nClub, than whom none were more respectable and intelligent.\r\n\r\nThis same Red Club was Conservative, and promised to Mr. Gladstone, the\r\nthorough Conservative candidate, 650 votes, the whole number within its\r\nranks. He also received the promise of 240 votes of other electors. This\r\nwas known before the election, so that the result was confidently\r\npredicted. On the 11th of December, 1832, the \"nomination\" was held and\r\nthe polling or election was held on the two following days, and Mr.\r\nGladstone was chosen by a considerable majority, the votes being,\r\nGladstone, 882; Handley, 793; Wilde, 719. Sergeant Wilde was defeated.\r\n\r\nDuring the public discussions before the election Mr. Gladstone was\r\nplaced at a great disadvantage. There were three candidates to be heard\r\nfrom and his speech was to be the last in order. Sergeant Wilde made a\r\nvery lengthy speech, which exhausted the patience of his hearers, who\r\nhad already stood for nearly seven hours, and showed disinclination to\r\nlisten to another three hours' address, which, from Mr. Gladstone's\r\ntalents, they were far from thinking impossible. The Sergeant was\r\ncondemned for occupying the attention of the electors for such an\r\ninordinate length of time, but this did not prevent a scene of\r\noutrageous noise and uproar when the Tory candidate rose to speak. The\r\nimportant topic was slavery, but Mr. Gladstone had not proceeded far\r\nwhen the hooting and hissing drowned his voice so that he found it\r\nimpossible to proceed. When a show of hands was demanded it was declared\r\nin favor of Mr. Handley and Sergeant Wilde, but when the election came,\r\nit was Mr. Gladstone who triumphed, as has been seen, and who was sent\r\nto Parliament as the member from Newark.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the manner in which the Parliamentary elections are\r\nconducted, an English writer says: \"Since 1832, few of those scenes of\r\nviolence, and even of bloodshed, which formerly distinguished\r\nParliamentary elections in many English boroughs, have been witnessed.\r\nSome of these lawless outbreaks were doubtless due to the unpopularity\r\nof the candidates forced upon the electors; but even in the largest\r\ntowns--where territorial influence had little sway--riots occurred upon\r\nwhich we look back with doubtful amazement. Men holding strong political\r\nviews have ceased to enforce those views by the aid of brickbats and\r\nother dangerous missiles. Yet at the beginning of the present century\r\nsuch arguments were very popular. And to the violence which prevailed\r\nwas added the most unblushing bribery. Several boroughs, long notorious\r\nfor extensive bribery, have since been disfranchised. The practice,\r\nhowever, extended to most towns in the kingdom, though it was not always\r\ncarried on in the same open manner. By a long established custom, a\r\nvoter at Hull received a donation of two guineas, or four for a\r\nplumper. In Liverpool men were openly paid for their votes; and Lord\r\nCochrane stated in the House of Commons that, after his return for\r\nHoniton, he sent the town-crier round the borough to tell the voters to\r\ngo to the chief banker for £10 10s. each. The great enlargement of the\r\nconstituencies, secured by the Reform Bill of 1832, did much to put an\r\nend to this disgraceful condition of things; but to a wider political\r\nenlightenment also, some portion of the credit for such a result must be\r\nattributed.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the friends and foes of the new Tory member for Newark thought of\r\nhis successful canvass and election, it is interesting to learn. When\r\nMr. Gladstone entered upon the contest the question was frequently put,\r\n\"Who is Mr. Gladstone?\" And it was answered, \"He is the son of the\r\nfriend of Mr. Canning, the great Liverpool merchant. He is, we\r\nunderstand, not more than four or five and twenty, but he has won golden\r\nopinions from all sorts of people, and promises to be an ornament to the\r\nHouse of Commons.\" And a few days after his election he addressed a\r\nmeeting of the Constitutional Club, at Nottingham, when a Conservative\r\njournal made the first prophecy as to his future great political fame,\r\nsaying: \"He will one day be classed amongst the most able statesmen in\r\nthe British Senate.\" The impression his successful contest made upon the\r\nlate friends of his school-days may be learned from the following: A\r\nshort time before the election Arthur Hallam, writing of his friend,\r\n\"the old _W.E.G._,\" says: \"I shall be very glad if he gets in.... We\r\nwant such a man as that. In some things he is likely to be obstinate and\r\nprejudiced; but he has a fine fund of high, chivalrous Tory sentiment,\r\nand a tongue, moreover, to let it loose with.\" And after the election he\r\nexclaims: \"And Gladstone has turned out the Sergeant!... What a triumph\r\nfor him. He has made his reputation by it; all that remains is to keep\r\nup to it.\"\r\n\r\nThat one of Mr. Gladstone's Liberal opponents was impressed by his\r\ntalent and character is shown by the following lines of \"descriptive\r\nprophecy, perhaps more remarkable for good feeling than for\r\ngood poetry:\"\r\n\r\n     \"Yet on one form, whose ear can ne'er refuse\r\n      The Muses' tribute, for he lov'd the Muse,\r\n     (And when the soul the gen'rous virtues raise,\r\n      A friendly Whig may chant a Tory's praise,)\r\n      Full many a fond expectant eye is bent\r\n      Where Newark's towers are mirror'd in the Trent.\r\n      Perchance ere long to shine in senates first,\r\n      If manhood echo what his youth rehears'd,\r\n      Soon Gladstone's brows will bloom with greener bays\r\n      Than twine the chaplet of the minstrel's lays;\r\n      Nor heed, while poring o'er each graver line,\r\n      The far, faint music of a flute like mine.\r\n      His was no head contentedly which press'd\r\n      The downy pillow in obedient rest,\r\n      Where lazy pilots, with their canvas furl'd,\r\n      Let up the Gades of their mental world;\r\n      His was no tongue which meanly stoop'd to wear\r\n      The guise of virtue, while his heart was bare;\r\n      But all he thought through ev'ry action ran;\r\n      God's noblest work--I've known one honest man.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone spoke at Newark in company with his friend, the Earl of\r\nLincoln, shortly after his election, when another favorable testimony\r\nwas given, and his address spoken of as \"a manly, eloquent speech,\r\nreplete with sound constitutional sentiments, high moral feeling, and\r\nability of the most distinguished order.\"\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon the result of the election a representative of the\r\npress of Newark wrote: \"We have been told there was no reaction against\r\nthe Ministry, no reaction in favor of Conservative principles. The\r\ndelusion has now vanished, and made room for sober reason and\r\nreflection. The shadow satisfies no longer, and the return of Mr.\r\nGladstone, to the discomfiture of the learned Sergeant and his friends,\r\nhas restored the town of Newark to the high rank which it formerly held\r\nin the estimation of the friends of order and good government. We\r\nventure to predict that the losing candidate in this contest has\r\nsuffered so severely that he will never show his face in Newark on a\r\nsimilar occasion.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Gladstone had made bitter political enemies already, who were\r\nnot at all reconciled to his election, nor pleased with him. That they\r\nwere not at all slow to express unbecomingly their bitterness against\r\nhim, because of their unexpected defeat, the following shows from the\r\n_Reflector_: \"Mr. Gladstone is the son of Gladstone of Liverpool, a\r\nperson who (we are speaking of the father) had amassed a large fortune\r\nby West India dealings. In other words, a great part of his gold has\r\nsprung from the blood of black slaves. Respecting the youth himself--a\r\nperson fresh from college, and whose mind is as much like a sheet of\r\nwhite foolscap as possible--he was utterly unknown. He came recommended\r\nby no claim in the world _except the will of the Duke_. The Duke nodded\r\nunto Newark, and Newark sent back the man, or rather the boy of his\r\nchoice. What! Is this to be, now that the Reform Bill has done its work?\r\nAre sixteen hundred men still to bow down to a wooden-headed lord, as\r\nthe people of Egypt used to do to their beasts, to their reptiles, and\r\ntheir ropes of onions? There must be something wrong--something\r\nimperfect. What is it? What is wanting? Why, the Ballot! If there be a\r\ndoubt of this (and we believe there is a doubt even amongst intelligent\r\nmen) the tale of Newark must set the question at rest. Sergeant Wilde\r\nwas met on his entry into the town by almost the whole population. He\r\nwas greeted everywhere, cheered everywhere. He was received with delight\r\nby his friends and with good and earnest wishes for his success by his\r\nnominal foes. The voters for Gladstone went up to that candidate's booth\r\n(the slave-driver, as they called him) with Wilde's colors. People who\r\nhad before voted for Wilde, on being asked to give their suffrage said,\r\n'We cannot, we dare not. We have lost half our business, and shall lose\r\nthe rest if we go against the Duke. We would do anything in our power\r\nfor Sergeant Wilde and for the cause, but we cannot starve!' Now what\r\nsay ye, our merry men, touching the Ballot?\"\r\n\r\nHowever Mr. Gladstone had won as we have seen the golden opinions of\r\nmany, and the dreams of his more youthful days were realized when he was\r\nsent to represent the people in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of January, 1833, the first Reformed Parliament met, and\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone, as the member from Newark, took his seat for the\r\nfirst time in \"an assembly which he was destined to adorn, delight and\r\nastonish for more than half a century, and over which for a great\r\nportion of that period, he was to wield an unequalled and a paramount\r\nauthority.\" There were more than three hundred new members in the House\r\nof Commons. Lord Althorp led the Whigs, who were largely in the majority\r\nand the Tories constituted a compact minority under the skillful\r\nleadership of Sir Robert Peel, while the Irish members who were hostile\r\nto the ministry followed O'Connell. On the 5th of February the king\r\nattended and delivered the speech from the throne in person. This\r\nParliamentary session was destined to become one of the most memorable\r\nin history for the importance of the subjects discussed and disposed of,\r\namong them the social condition of Ireland, the position of the Irish\r\nchurch, the discontent and misery of the poor in England, and slavery in\r\nthe British colonies; and for the fact that it was the first Parliament\r\nin which William E. Gladstone sat and took part.\r\n\r\nThere was no reference made to the subject of slavery in the speech from\r\nthe throne, but the ministry resolved to consider it. Mr. Stanley, the\r\nColonial Secretary, afterwards fourteenth Earl of Derby and Prime\r\nMinister, brought forth, May 14th, 1833, a series of resolutions in\r\nfavor of the extinction of slavery in the British colonies. \"All\r\nchildren of slaves, born after the passage of the Act, and all children\r\nof six years old and under, were declared free. But the rest of the\r\nslaves were to serve a sort of apprenticeship--three-fourths of their\r\ntime was for a certain number of years to remain at the disposal of the\r\nmasters; the other fourth was their own, to be paid for at a fixed rate\r\nof wages.\" The planters were to be duly compensated out of the national\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nIt was during the discussion of these resolutions that Mr. Gladstone\r\nmade his maiden speech in Parliament. It was made in answer to what\r\nseemed a personal challenge by Lord Howick, Ex-Under Secretary for the\r\ncolonies, who, opposing gradual emancipation, referred to an estate in\r\nDemerara, owned by Mr. Gladstone's father, for the purpose of showing\r\nthat great destruction of life had taken place in the West Indies owing\r\nto the manner in which the slaves were worked. In reply to this Mr.\r\nGladstone said that he would meet some of Lord Howick's statements with\r\ndenials and others with explanations. He admitted that he had a\r\npecuniary interest in it as a question of justice, of humanity, and of\r\nreligion. The real cause of the decrease, he said, was owing, not to the\r\nincreased cultivation of sugar, but to the very large proportion of\r\nAfricans upon the estate. When it came into his father's possession it\r\nwas so weak, owing to the large number of negroes upon it, that he was\r\nobliged to add two hundred more people to the gang. It was well known\r\nthat negroes were imported into Demarara and Trinidad up to a later\r\nperiod than into any of the colonies; and he should at a proper time, be\r\nable to prove that the decrease on his father's plantation, Vreeden\r\nHoop, was among the old Africans, and that there was an increase going\r\non in the Creole population, which would be a sufficient answer to the\r\ncharges preferred. The quantity of sugar produced was small compared to\r\nthat produced on other estates. The cultivation of cotton in Demarara\r\nhad been abandoned, and that of coffee much diminished, and the people\r\nengaged in these sources of production had been employed in the\r\ncultivation of sugar. Besides in Demarara the labor of the same number\r\nof negroes, distributed over the year, would produce in that colony a\r\ncertain quantity of sugar with less injury to the people, than negroes\r\ncould produce in other colonies, working only at the stated periods\r\nof crops.\r\n\r\nHe was ready to concede that the cultivation was of a more injurious\r\ncharacter than others; and he would ask, Were there not certain\r\nemployments in other countries more destructive of life than others? He\r\nwould only instance those of painting and working in lead mines, both of\r\nwhich were well known to have that tendency. The noble lord attempted to\r\nimpugn the character of the gentleman acting as manager of his father's\r\nestates; and in making the selection he had surely been most\r\nunfortunate; for there was not a person in the colony more remarkable\r\nfor humanity and the kind treatment of his slaves than Mr. Maclean. Mr.\r\nGladstone, in concluding this able defense of his father, said, that he\r\nheld in his hand two letters from Mr. Maclean, in which he spoke in the\r\nkindest terms of the negroes under his charge; described their state of\r\nhappiness, content and healthiness--their good conduct and the\r\ninfrequency of severe punishment--and recommended certain additional\r\ncomforts, which he said the slaves well deserved.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of June, on the resumption of the debate on the abolition of\r\nslavery, Mr. Gladstone again addressed the House. He now entered more\r\nfully into the charges which Lord Howick had brought against the\r\nmanagement of his father's estates in Demarara, and showed their\r\ngroundlessness. When he had discussed the existing aspect of slavery in\r\nTrinidad, Jamaica and other places, he proceeded to deal with the\r\ngeneral question. He confessed with shame and pain that cases of wanton\r\ncruelty had occurred in the colonies, but added that they would always\r\nexist, particularly under the system of slavery; and this was\r\nunquestionably a substantial reason why the British Legislature and\r\npublic should set themselves in good earnest to provide for its\r\nextinction; but he maintained that these instances of cruelty could\r\neasily be explained by the West Indians, who represented them as rare\r\nand isolated cases, and who maintained that the ordinary relation of\r\nmaster and slave was one of kindliness and not of hostility. He\r\ndeprecated cruelty, and he deprecated slavery, both of which were\r\nabhorrent to the nature of Englishmen; but, conceding these things, he\r\nasked, \"Were not Englishmen to retain a right to their own honestly and\r\nlegally-acquired property?\" But the cruelty did not exist, and he saw no\r\nreason for the attack which had recently been made upon the West India\r\ninterest. He hoped the House would make a point to adopt the principle\r\nof compensation, and to stimulate the slave to genuine and spontaneous\r\nindustry. If this were not done, and moral instruction were not imparted\r\nto the slaves, liberty would prove a curse instead of a blessing to\r\nthem. Touching upon the property question, and the proposed plans for\r\nemancipation, Mr. Gladstone said that the House might consume its time\r\nand exert its wisdom in devising these plans, but without the\r\nconcurrence of the Colonial Legislatures success would be hopeless. He\r\nthought there was excessive wickedness in any violent interference under\r\nthe present circumstances. They were still in the midst of unconcluded\r\ninquiries, and to pursue the measure then under discussion, at that\r\nmoment, was to commit an act of great and unnecessary hostility toward\r\nthe island of Jamaica. \"It was the duty of the House to place as broad a\r\ndistinction as possible between the idle and the industrious slaves, and\r\nnothing could be too strong to secure the freedom of the latter; but,\r\nwith respect to the idle slaves, no period of emancipation could hasten\r\ntheir improvement. If the labors of the House should be conducted to a\r\nsatisfactory issue, it would redound to the honor of the nation, and to\r\nthe reputation of his Majesty's Ministers, whilst it would be delightful\r\nto the West India planters themselves--for they must feel that to hold\r\nin bondage their fellow-men must always involve the greatest\r\nresponsibility. But let not any man think of carrying this measure by\r\nforce. England rested her power not upon physical force, but upon her\r\nprinciples, her intellect and virtue; and if this great measure were not\r\nplaced on a fair basis, or were conducted by violence, he should lament\r\nit, as a signal for the ruin of the Colonies and the downfall of the\r\nEmpire.\" The attitude of Mr. Gladstone, as borne out by the tenor of his\r\nspeech, was not one of hostility to emancipation, though he was\r\nundoubtedly unfavorable to an immediate and indiscriminate\r\nenfranchisement. He demanded, moreover, that the interests of the\r\nplanters should be duly regarded.\r\n\r\nThe result of the consideration of these resolutions in the House of\r\nCommons was that human slavery in the British Colonies was abolished,\r\nand the sum of twenty million pounds, or one hundred million dollars was\r\nvoted to compensate the slave-owners for their losses. Thus was the\r\nwork begun by Wilberforce finally crowned with success.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question how Mr. Gladstone's first efforts in\r\nParliament were received. Among his friends his speech was anticipated\r\nwith lively interest. That morning he was riding in Hyde Park, on his\r\ngray Arabian mare, \"his hat, narrow-brimmed, high up on the centre of\r\nhis head, sustained by a crop of thick curly hair.\" He was pointed out\r\nto Lord Charles Russell by a passer-by who said, \"That is Gladstone. He\r\nis to make his maiden speech to-night. It will be worth hearing.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the first he appears to have favorably impressed the members of the\r\nHouse. Modest in demeanor, earnest in manner, and fluent in speech, he\r\nat once commanded the respect and attention of his fellow-members.\r\n\r\nAnd here is a later testimony as to the early impression made upon his\r\ncolleagues and contemporaries, when he was twenty-nine years of age,\r\nerroneously stated as thirty-five: \"Mr. Gladstone, the member for\r\nNewark, is one of the most rising young men on the Tory side of the\r\nHouse. His party expect great things from him; and certainly, when it is\r\nremembered that his age is only thirty-five, the success of the\r\nParliamentary efforts he has already made justifies their expectations.\r\nHe is well informed on most of the subjects which usually occupy the\r\nattention of the Legislature; and he is happy in turning his\r\ninformation to good account. He is ready on all occasions, which he\r\ndeems fitting ones, with a speech in favor of the policy advocated by\r\nthe party with whom he acts. His extempore resources are ample. Few men\r\nin the House can improvise better. It does not appear to cost him an\r\neffort to speak.... He is a man of very considerable talent, but has\r\nnothing approaching to genius. His abilities are much more the result of\r\nan excellent education and of mature study than of any prodigality of\r\nnature in the distribution of her mental gifts. _I have no idea that he\r\nwill ever acquire the reputation of a great statesman. His views are not\r\nsufficiently profound or enlarged for that; his celebrity in the House\r\nof Commons will chiefly depend on his readiness and dexterity as a\r\ndebater, in conjunction with the excellence of his elocution, and the\r\ngracefulness of his manner when speaking_.... His style is polished, but\r\nhas no appearance of the effect of previous preparation. He displays\r\nconsiderable acuteness in replying to an opponent; he is quick in his\r\nperception of anything vulnerable in the speech to which he replies, and\r\nhappy in laying the weak point bare to the gaze of the House. He now and\r\nthen indulges in sarcasm, which is, in most cases, very felicitous. He\r\nis plausible even when most in error. When it suits himself or his party\r\nhe can apply himself with the strictest closeness to the real point at\r\nissue; when to evade the point is deemed most politic, no man can wander\r\nfrom it more widely.\"\r\n\r\nHow far these estimates were true we leave to the reader to determine,\r\nafter the perusal of his life, and in the light of subsequent events.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, after his maiden speech, took an active part in the\r\nbusiness of the House during the remainder of the session of 1833. He\r\nspoke upon the question of bribery and corruption at Liverpool, and July\r\n8th made an elaborate speech on the Irish Church Temporalities Bill. The\r\ncondition of Ireland was then, as now, one of the most urgent questions\r\nconfronting the Ministry. Macaulay \"solemnly declared that he would\r\nrather live in the midst of many civil wars that he had read of than in\r\nsome parts of Ireland at this moment.\" Sydney Smith humorously described\r\n\"those Irish Protestants whose shutters are bullet-proof; whose\r\ndinner-table is regularly spread out with knife, fork, and cocked\r\npistol; salt-cellar and powder-flask; who sleep in sheet-iron nightcaps;\r\nwho have fought so often and so nobly before their scullery-door, and\r\ndefended the parlor passage as bravely as Leonidas defended the pass of\r\nThermopylae.\" Crime was rife and to remedy the serious state of affairs\r\na stringent Coercion Bill was introduced by the government. Mr.\r\nGladstone voted silently for the bill which became a law.\r\n\r\nThe other bill introduced was that upon the Irish Church, and proposed\r\nthe reduction of the number of Protestant Episcopal Bishops in Ireland\r\nand the curtailment of the income of the Church. This bill Mr. Gladstone\r\nopposed in a speech, and he voted against it, but it was passed.\r\n\r\nIt was in the following session that Mr. Hume introduced his\r\n\"'Universities Admission Bill,' designed to enable Nonconformists of all\r\nkinds to enter the universities, by removing the necessity of\r\nsubscribing to the thirty-nine articles at matriculation.\" In the debate\r\nthat followed Mr. Gladstone soon gave evidence that he knew more about\r\nthe subject than did the author of the bill. In speaking against the\r\nbill, he said in part, \"The whole system of the university and of its\r\ncolleges, both in study and in discipline, aimed at the formation of a\r\nmoral character, and that aim could not be attained if every student\r\nwere at liberty to exclude himself from the religious training of the\r\nplace.\" And in reply to a remark made by Lord Palmerston in reference to\r\nthe students going \"from wine to prayers, and from prayers to wine,\" Mr.\r\nGladstone replied, he did not believe that in their most convivial\r\nmoments they were unfit to enter the house of prayer. This bill was\r\nalso passed.\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected that Mr. Gladstone's active participation in\r\nthe debates in the House of Commons, and the practical ability and\r\ndebating power he manifested would not escape the attention of the\r\nleaders of his party. But the recognition of his merit came sooner than\r\ncould have been expected. It became evident, towards the close of 1834\r\nthat the downfall of the Liberal Ministry was near at hand. Lord\r\nAlthorp, who had kept the Liberals together, was transferred to the\r\nHouse of Lords, and the growing unpopularity of the Whigs did the rest.\r\nThe Ministry under Lord Melbourne was dismissed by the king, and a new\r\nCabinet formed by Sir Robert Peel. The new Premier offered Mr. Gladstone\r\nthe office of Junior Lord of the Treasury, which was accepted.\r\n\r\nTruly has an eminent writer said: \"When a Prime Minister in\r\ndifficulties, looking about for men to fill the minor offices of his\r\nadministration, sees among his supporters a clever and comely young man,\r\neloquent in speech, ready in debate, with a safe seat, an ample fortune,\r\na high reputation at the university, and a father who wields political\r\ninfluence in an important constituency, he sees a Junior Lord of the\r\nTreasury made ready to his hand.\"\r\n\r\nAppealing to his constituents at Newark, who, two years before, had sent\r\nhim to Parliament, he was re-elected. Mr. Handley having retired,\r\nSergeant Wilde was elected with Mr. Gladstone without opposition. Mr.\r\nGladstone was \"chaired,\" or drawn by horses through the town, seated on\r\na chair, after the election, and then addressed the assembled people to\r\nthe number of 6,000, his speech being received with \"deafening cheers.\"\r\n\r\nShortly after Parliament assembled, Mr. Gladstone was promoted to the\r\noffice of Under-Secretary for the Colonies. His official chief was Lord\r\nAberdeen, afterwards Prime Minister; and thus began a relation which was\r\ndestined to greatly affect the destinies of both statesmen.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone gave ample proof in his new office of his great abilities\r\nand untiring energies.\r\n\r\nIn March he presented to the House his first bill, which was for the\r\nbetter regulation of the transportation of passengers in merchant\r\nvessels to the continent and to the Islands of North America. This bill,\r\nwhich contained many humane provisions, was very favorably received. The\r\nnew Parliament, which met February 10, 1835, contained a considerable\r\nLiberal majority. The old House of Commons had been destroyed by fire\r\nduring the recess, and the new Commons reassembled in the chamber which\r\nhad been the House of Lords, and for the first time there was a gallery\r\nfor reporters in the House.\r\n\r\n\"A standing order still existed, which forbade the publication of the\r\ndebates, but the reporters' gallery was a formal and visible recognition\r\nof the people's right to know what their representatives were doing in\r\ntheir name.\" However, the new Ministry was but short-lived, for Sir\r\nRobert Peel resigned April 8th, and Mr. Gladstone retired with\r\nhis chief.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone spent the days of his retirement from ministerial office\r\npartly in study, and partly in recreation. Being free to follow the bent\r\nof his own inclinations, he ordered his life according to his own\r\nideals. He lived in chambers at the Albany, pursued the same steady\r\ncourse of work, proper recreation and systematic devotion, which he had\r\nmarked out at Oxford. He freely went into society, dined out frequently,\r\nand took part in musical parties, much to the edification of his friends\r\nwho were charmed with the beauty and cultivation of his rich baritone.\r\nHis friend Monckton Milnes had established himself in London and\r\ncollected around him a society of young men, interested in politics and\r\nreligion, and whom he entertained Sunday evenings. But this arrangement\r\n\"unfortunately,\" as Mr. Milnes said, excluded from these gatherings the\r\nmore serious members, such as Acland and Gladstone. Mr. Milnes expressed\r\nhis opinion of such self-exclusion in these words: \"I really think when\r\npeople keep Friday as a fast, they might make a feast of Sunday.\" But\r\nMr. Gladstone evidently was not of this opinion, and remained away from\r\nthese Lord's Day parties. However at other times he met his friends, and\r\nreceived them at his own rooms in the Albany, and on one memorable\r\noccasion entertained Wordsworth at breakfast and a few admirers of this\r\ndistinguished guest.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's relaxations were occasional, and the most of his time\r\nwas devoted to his Parliamentary duties and study. His constant\r\ncompanions were Homer and Dante, and he at this time, it is recorded,\r\nread the whole of St. Augustine, in twenty-two octavo volumes. He was a\r\nconstant attendant upon public worship at St. James', Piccadilly, and\r\nMargaret Chapel, and a careful critic of sermons. At the same time he\r\ndiligently applied himself to the work of a private member of the House\r\nof Commons, working on committees and taking constant part in debate.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the question of slavery again came up before Parliament. This\r\ntime the question was as to the working of the system of negro\r\napprenticeship, which had taken the place of slavery. It was asserted\r\nthat the system was only slavery under another name. He warmly and ably\r\ndefended again the West Indian planters. He pleaded that many of the\r\nplanters were humane men, and defended also the honor of his relatives\r\nconnected with the traffic so much denounced, when it was assailed. He\r\ncontended that while the evils of the system had been exaggerated, all\r\nmention of its advantages had been carefully withheld. The condition of\r\nthe negroes was improving. He deprecated the attempt made to renew and\r\nperpetuate the system of agitation at the expense of candor and truth.\r\nHe also at this time spoke on support of authority and order in the\r\ngovernment of Canada, and on Church Rates, dwelling upon the necessity\r\nof national religion to the security of a state. Mr. Gladstone was not\r\nonly a Tory but a High Churchman.\r\n\r\nKing William IV died June 20, 1837, and was succeeded by Queen Victoria.\r\nA general election ensued. The Parliament, which had been prorogued by\r\nthe young queen in person, was dissolved on the 17th of July. Mr.\r\nGladstone, without his consent, was nominated to represent Manchester in\r\nthe House, but was re-elected for Newark without opposition. He then\r\nturned his steps towards Scotland, \"to see what grouse he could persuade\r\ninto his bag.\" The new Parliament met October 20th, but no business of\r\nimportance came before it until after the Christmas holidays.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 a bill was presented in both Houses of Parliament for the\r\nimmediate abolition of negro apprenticeship. Many harrowing details of\r\nthe cruelties practiced were cited. Mr. Gladstone returned to the\r\nchampionship of the planters with increased power and success. His long,\r\neloquent and powerful speech of March 30th, although on the unpopular\r\nside of the question, is regarded as having so greatly enhanced his\r\nreputation as to bring him to the front rank among Parliamentary\r\ndebaters. Having impassionately defended the planters from the\r\nexaggerated charges made against them, he further said: \"You consumed\r\nforty-five millions of pounds of cotton in 1837 which proceeded from\r\nfree labor; and, proceeding from slave labor, three hundred and eighteen\r\nmillions of pounds! And this, while the vast regions of India afford the\r\nmeans of obtaining at a cheaper rate, and by a slight original outlay,\r\nto facilitate transport, all that you can require. If, Sir, the\r\ncomplaints against the general body of the West Indians had been\r\nsubstantiated, I should have deemed it an unworthy artifice to attempt\r\ndiverting the attention of the House from the question immediately at\r\nissue, by merely proving that delinquencies existed in other quarters;\r\nbut feeling as I do that those charges have been overthrown in debate, I\r\nthink myself entitled and bound to show how capricious are the honorable\r\ngentlemen in the distribution of their sympathies among those different\r\nobjects which call for their application.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, \"having turned the tables upon his opponents,\" concluded\r\nby demanding justice, and the motion before the House was rejected.\r\n\r\nAbout one month later Rev. Samuel Wilberforce, afterwards Bishop of\r\nOxford, and of Winchester, wrote to Mr. Gladstone: \"It would be an\r\naffectation in you, which you are above, not to know that few young men\r\nhave the weight you have in the House of Commons, and are gaining\r\nrapidly throughout the country. Now I do not wish to urge you to\r\nconsider this as a talent for the use of which you must render an\r\naccount, for so I know you do esteem it, but what I want to urge upon\r\nyou is that you should calmly look far before you; see the degree of\r\nweight and influence to which you may fairly, if God spares your life\r\nand powers, look forward in future years, and thus act _now_ with a view\r\nto _then_. There is no height to which you may not fairly rise in this\r\ncountry. If it pleases God to spare us violent convulsions and the loss\r\nof our liberties, you may at a future day wield the whole government of\r\nthis land; and if this should be so, of what extreme moment will your\r\n_past steps_ then be to the real usefulness of your high station....\r\nAlmost all our public men act from the merest expediency.... I would\r\nhave you view yourself as one who may become the head of all the better\r\nfeelings of this country, the maintainer of its Church and of its\r\nliberties, and who must now be fitting himself for this high\r\nvocation.... I think my father's life so beautifully shows that a deep\r\nand increasing personal religion must be the root of that firm and\r\nunwearied consistency in right, which I have ventured thus to press\r\nupon you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone began his Parliamentary life as a Tory. Later he developed\r\ninto a Liberal, a Radical, and yet there is not one who conscientiously\r\ndoubts his utter honesty. His life has been that of his\r\ncentury--progressive, liberal, humanitarian in its trend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grattan]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK ON CHURCH AND STATE\r\n\r\nWe have now followed Mr. Gladstone in his course until well on the way\r\nin his political career, and yet he is but twenty-eight years of age.\r\nHis personal appearance in the House of Commons at this early stage of\r\nhis Parliamentary life is thus described: \"Mr. Gladstone's appearance\r\nand manners are much in his favor. He is a fine looking man. He is about\r\nthe usual height and of good figure. His countenance is mild and\r\npleasant, and has a highly intellectual expression. His eyes are clear\r\nand quick. His eyebrows are dark and rather prominent. There is not a\r\ndandy in the House but envies what Truefit would call his 'fine head of\r\njet-black hair.' It is always carefully parted from the crown downwards\r\nto his brow, where it is tastefully shaded. His features are small and\r\nregular, and his complexion must be a very unworthy witness if he does\r\nnot possess an abundant stock of health.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone's gesture is varied, but not violent. When he rises he\r\ngenerally puts both his hands behind his back, and having there suffered\r\nthem to embrace each other for a short time, he unclasps them and allows\r\nthem to drop on either side. They are not permitted to remain long in\r\nthat locality before you see them, again closed together and hanging\r\ndown before him. Their reunion is not suffered to last for any length of\r\ntime, Again a separation takes place, and now the right hand is seen\r\nmoving up and down before him. Having thus exercised it a little, he\r\nthrusts it into the pocket of his coat, and then orders the left hand to\r\nfollow its example. Having granted them a momentary repose there, they\r\nare again put into gentle motion, and in a few seconds they are seen\r\nreposing _vis-a-vis_ on his breast. He moves his face and body from one\r\ndirection to another, not forgetting to bestow a liberal share of his\r\nattention on his own party. He is always listened to with much attention\r\nby the House, and appears to be highly respected by men of all parties.\r\nHe is a man of good business habits; of this he furnished abundant proof\r\nwhen Under-Secretary for the Colonies, during the short-lived\r\nadministration of Robert Peel.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this pen picture and other like notices of Mr. Gladstone he must,\r\nat that time, have attained great distinction and attracted a good deal\r\nof attention for one so young, and from that day to this he has\r\ncommanded the attention not only of the British Senate and people, but\r\nof the world at large. And why? may we ask, unless because of his modest\r\nmanner and distinguished services, his exalted ability and moral worth.\r\n\r\n\"The House of Commons was his ground,\" writes Justin McCarthy. \"There he\r\nwas always seen to the best advantage.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Gladstone wrote with the same earnestness and ability\r\nwith which he spoke. It was early in life that he distinguished himself\r\nas an author, as well as an orator and debater in the House of Commons.\r\nAnd it was most natural for him to write upon the subject of the Church,\r\nfor not only his education led him to the consideration of such themes,\r\nbut it was within his sphere as an English statesman, for the law of the\r\nland provided for the union of the Church and State. It was in 1838,\r\nwhen he was not thirty years of age, that he wrote his first book and\r\nstepped at once to the front rank as an author. He had ever been a\r\nstaunch defender of the Established Church and his first appearance in\r\nliterature was by a remarkable work in defense of the State Church\r\nentitled, \"The State in its Relations with the Church.\" The treatise is\r\nthus dedicated: \"Inscribed to the University of Oxford, tried and not\r\nfound wanting through the vicissitudes of a thousand years; in the\r\nbelief that she is providentially designed to be a fountain of\r\nblessings, spiritual, social and intellectual, to this and other\r\ncountries, to present and future times; and in the hope that the temper\r\nof these pages may be found not alien from her own.\"\r\n\r\nThis first published book of Mr. Gladstone's was due to the perception\r\nthat the _status_ of the Church, in its connection with the secular\r\npower, was about to undergo the severe assaults of the opponents of the\r\nUnion. There was growing opposition to the recognition of the Episcopal\r\nChurch as the Church of the State and to taxation of people of other\r\nreligious beliefs for its support; and this objection was to the\r\nrecognition and support of any Church by the State. What is called the\r\n\"American idea\"--the entire separation of the Church and State--or as\r\nenunciated first by Roger Williams in 1636, in Rhode Island, that the\r\nmagistrate should have authority in civil affairs only, was becoming\r\nmore and more the doctrine of dissenters. Preparations were already\r\nbeing made for attacking the national establishment of religion, and\r\nwith all the fervor springing from conviction and a deep-seated\r\nenthusiasm, he came forward to take part in the controversy on Church\r\nand State, and as a defender of the Established or Episcopal Church\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nSome of the positions assumed in this work have since been renounced as\r\nuntenable, but its ability as a whole, its breadth and its learning\r\ncould not be denied. It then created a great sensation, and has since\r\nbeen widely discussed. After an examination and a defense of the theory\r\nof the connection between Church and State, Mr. Gladstone thus\r\nsummarizes his principal reasons for the maintenance of the Church\r\nestablishment:\r\n\r\n\"Because the Government stands with us in a paternal relation to the\r\npeople, and is bound in all things not merely to consider their existing\r\ntastes, but the capabilities and ways of their improvement; because it\r\nhas both an intrinsic competency and external means to amend and assist\r\ntheir choice; because to be in accordance with God's mind and will, it\r\nmust have a religion, and because to be in accordance with its\r\nconscience, that religion must be the truth, as held by it under the\r\nmost solemn and accumulated responsibilities; because this is the only\r\nsanctifying and preserving principle of society, as well as to the\r\nindividual, that particular benefit, without which all others are worse\r\nthan valueless; we must, therefore, disregard the din of political\r\ncontention and the pressure of novelty and momentary motives, and in\r\nbehalf of our regard to man, as well as of our allegiance to God,\r\nmaintain among ourselves, where happily it still exists, the union\r\nbetween the Church and the State.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Russell in the following quotation not only accounts for this\r\nproduction from the pen, of Mr. Gladstone, but gives also an outline of\r\nthe argument:\r\n\r\n\"Naturally and profoundly religious ... Mr. Gladstone conceived that\r\nthose who professed the warmest regard for the Church of England and\r\nposed as her most strenuous defenders, were inclined to base their\r\nchampionship on mistaken grounds and to direct their efforts towards\r\neven mischievous ends. To supply a more reasonable basis for action and\r\nto lead this energy into more profitable channels were the objects which\r\nhe proposed to himself in his treatise of 1838. The distinctive\r\nprinciple of the book was that the State had a conscience. This being\r\nadmitted, the issue was this: whether the State in its best condition,\r\nhas such a conscience as can take cognizance of religious truth and\r\nerror, and in particular whether the State of the United Kingdom at that\r\ntime was, or was not, so far in that condition as to be under an\r\nobligation to give an active and an exclusive support to the established\r\nreligion of the country.\r\n\r\n\"The work attempted to survey the actual state of the relations between\r\nthe State and the Church; to show from history the ground which had been\r\ndefined for the National Church at the Reformation; and to inquire and\r\ndetermine whether the existing state of things was worth preserving and\r\ndefending against encroachment from whatever quarter. This question it\r\ndecided emphatically in the affirmative. Faithful to logic and to its\r\ntheory, the book did not shrink from applying them to the external case\r\nof the Irish Church. It did not disguise the difficulties of the case,\r\nfor the author was alive to the paradox which it involved. But the one\r\nmaster idea of the system, that the State as it then stood was capable\r\nin this age, as it had been in ages long gone by, of assuming\r\nbeneficially a responsibility for the inculcation of a particular\r\nreligion, carried him through all. His doctrine was that the Church, as\r\nestablished by law, was to be maintained for its truth; that this was\r\nthe only principle in which it could be properly and permanently upheld;\r\nthat this principle, if good in England, was good also for Ireland; that\r\ntruth is of all possessions the most precious to the soul of man; and\r\nthat to remove this priceless treasure from the view and the reach of\r\nthe Irish people would be meanly to purchase their momentary favor at\r\nthe expense of their permanent interests, and would be a high offense\r\nagainst our own sacred obligations.\"\r\n\r\nWe quote also from the opening chapter of the second volume of this\r\nwork, which treats of the connection subsisting between the State of the\r\nUnited Kingdom and the Church of England and Ireland, and shows Mr.\r\nGladstone's views at that period of his life upon the relations of the\r\nChurch as affecting Ireland in particular. The passage also indicates\r\nthe changes that have taken place in his mind since the time when he\r\ndefended these principles. It also shows the style in which this\r\nremarkable book was written and enables us to compare, not only his\r\nopinions now and then, but his style in writing then with his style now.\r\n\r\n\"The Protestant legislature of the British Empire maintains in the\r\npossession of the Church property of Ireland the ministers of a creed\r\nprofessed, according to the parliamentary enumeration, of 1835, by\r\none-ninth of its population, regarded with partial favor by scarcely\r\nanother ninth, and disowned by the remaining seven. And not only does\r\nthis anomaly meet us full in view, but we have also to consider and\r\ndigest the fact, that the maintenance of this Church for near three\r\ncenturies in Ireland has been contemporaneous with a system of partial\r\nand abusive government, varying in degree of culpability, but rarely,\r\nuntil of later years, when we have been forced to look at the subject\r\nand to feel it, to be exempted in common fairness from the reproach of\r\ngross inattention (to say the very least) to the interests of a noble\r\nbut neglected people.\r\n\r\n\"But, however formidable at first sight the admissions, which I have no\r\ndesire to narrow or to qualify, may appear, they in no way shake the\r\nforegoing arguments. They do not change the nature of truth and her\r\ncapability and destiny to benefit mankind. They do not relieve\r\nGovernment of its responsibility, if they show that that responsibility\r\nwas once unfelt and unsatisfied. They place the legislature of the\r\ncountry in the condition, as it were, of one called to do penance for\r\npast offences; but duty remains unaltered and imperative, and abates\r\nnothing of her demand on our services. It is undoubtedly competent, in a\r\nconstitutional view, to the Government of this country to continue the\r\npresent disposition of Church property in Ireland. It appears not too\r\nmuch to assume that our imperial legislature has been qualified to take,\r\nand has taken in point of fact, a sounder view of religious truth than\r\nthe majority of the people of Ireland in their destitute and\r\nuninstructed state. We believe, accordingly, that that which we place\r\nbefore them is, whether they know it or not, calculated to be beneficial\r\nto them; and that if they know it not now, they will know it when it is\r\npresented to them fairly. Shall we, then, purchase their applause at the\r\nexpense of their substantial, nay, their spiritual interests?\r\n\r\n\"It does, indeed, so happen that there are powerful motives on the other\r\nside concurring with that which has here been represented as paramount.\r\nIn the first instance we are not called upon to establish a creed, but\r\nonly to maintain an existing legal settlement, when our constitutional\r\nright is undoubted. In the second, political considerations tend\r\nstrongly to recommend that maintenance. A common form of faith binds the\r\nIrish Protestants to ourselves, while they, upon the other hand, are\r\nfast linked to Ireland; and thus they supply the most natural bond of\r\nconnection between the countries. But if England, by overthrowing their\r\nChurch, should weaken their moral position, they would be no longer\r\nable, perhaps no longer willing, to counteract the desires of the\r\nmajority tending, under the direction of their leaders (however, by a\r\nwise policy, revocable from that fatal course) to what is termed\r\nnational independence. Pride and fear, on the one hand, are therefore\r\nbearing up against more immediate apprehension and difficulty on the\r\nother. And with some men these may be the fundamental considerations;\r\nbut it may be doubted whether such men will not flinch in some stage of\r\nthe contest, should its aspect at any moment become unfavorable.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the opponents of Mr. Gladstone's views, as set forth in his\r\nbook, strongly combated his theories. They replied that \"the taxation of\r\nthe State is equal upon all persons, and has for its object their\r\nindividual, social and political welfare and safety; but that the\r\ntaxation of one man for the support of his neighbor's religion does not\r\ncome within the limits of such taxation, and is, in fact, unjust and\r\ninequitable.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no easy task for Mr. Gladstone, with all his parliamentary\r\nduties, to aspire to authorship, and carry his book through the press.\r\nIn preparing for publication he passed through all the agonies of the\r\nauthor, but was nobly helped by his friend, James R. Hope, who\r\nafterwards became Mr. Hope-Scott, Q.C., who read and criticised his\r\nmanuscript and saw the sheets through the press. Some of the letters\r\nfrom the young Defender of the Faith to his friend contain much that is\r\nworth preserving. We give some extracts.\r\n\r\nHe writes: \"If you let them lie just as they are, turning the leaves one\r\nby one, I think you will not find the manuscript very hard to make out,\r\nthough it is strangely cut in pieces and patched.\r\n\r\n\"I hope its general tendency will meet with your approval; but a point\r\nabout which I am in doubt, and to which I request your particular\r\nattention, is, whether the work or some of the chapters are not so\r\ndeficient in clearness and arrangement as to require being absolutely\r\nrewritten before they can with propriety be published.... Between my\r\neyes and my business I fear it would be hard for me to re-write, but if\r\nI could put it into the hands of any other person who could, and who\r\nwould extract from my papers anything worth having, that might do.\r\n\r\n\"As regards myself, if I go on and publish, I shall be quite prepared to\r\nfind some persons surprised, but this, if it should prove so, cannot be\r\nhelped. I shall not knowingly exaggerate anything; and when a man\r\nexpects to be washed overboard he must tie himself with a rope to\r\nthe mast.\r\n\r\n\"I shall trust to your friendship for frankness in the discharge of your\r\nirksome task. Pray make verbal corrections without scruple where they\r\nare needed.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"I thank you most cordially for your remarks, and I rejoice to\r\nfind you act so entirely in the spirit I had anticipated. I trust you\r\nwill continue to speak with freedom, which is the best compliment as\r\nwell as the best service you can render me.\r\n\r\n\"I think it very probable that you may find that V and VI require quite\r\nas rigorous treatment as II, and I am very desirous to set both my mind\r\nand eyes at liberty before I go to the Continent, which I can now hardly\r\nexpect to do before the first week in September. This interval I trust\r\nwould suffice unless you find that the other chapters stand in\r\nequal need.\r\n\r\n\"I entirely concur with your view regarding the necessity of care and of\r\nnot grudging labor in a matter so important and so responsible as an\r\nendeavor to raise one of the most momentous controversies which has\r\never agitated human opinion,\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"Thanks for your letter. I have been pretty hard at work, and\r\nhave done a good deal, especially on V. Something yet remains. I must\r\nmake inquiry about the law of excommunication.... I have made a very\r\nstupid classification, and have now amended it; instead of faith,\r\ndiscipline and practice, what I meant was the rule of faith, discipline,\r\nand the bearing of particular doctrines upon practice.\r\n\r\n\"I send back also I and II that you may see what I have done.\"\r\n\r\nThe work was successfully issued in the autumn of 1838, and passed\r\nrapidly through three editions. How it was received it would be\r\ninteresting to inquire. While his friends applauded, even his opponents\r\ntestified to the ability it displayed. On the authority of Lord\r\nHoughton, it is said that Sir Robert Peel, the young author's political\r\nleader, on receiving a copy as a gift from his follower, read it with\r\nscornful curiosity, and, throwing it on the floor, exclaimed with truly\r\nofficial horror: \"With such a career before him, why should he write\r\nbooks? That young man will ruin his fine political career if he persists\r\nin writing trash like this.\" However, others gave the book a heartier\r\nreception. Crabb Robinson writes in his diary: \"I went to Wordsworth\r\nthis forenoon. He was ill in bed. I read Gladstone's book to him.\"\r\n\r\nDecember 13, 1838, Baron Bunsen wrote: \"Last night at eleven, when I\r\ncame from the Duke, Gladstone's book was lying on my table, having come\r\nout at seven o'clock. It is a book of the time, a great event--the first\r\nbook since Burke that goes to the bottom of the vital question; far\r\nabove his party and his time. I sat up till after midnight, and this\r\nmorning I continued until I had read the whole. Gladstone is the first\r\nman in England as to intellectual power, and he has heard higher tones\r\nthan any one else in the land.\" And again to Dr. Arnold he writes in\r\nhigh praise of the book, but lamenting its author's entanglement in\r\nTractarian traditions, adds: \"His genius will soon free itself entirely\r\nand fly towards Heaven with its own wings.\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry Taylor wrote to the Poet Southey: \"I am reading Gladstone's\r\nbook, which I shall send you if he has not.... His party begin to think\r\nof him as the man who will one day be at their head and at the head of\r\nthe government, and certainly no man of his standing has yet appeared\r\nwho seems likely to stand in his way. Two wants, however, may lie across\r\nhis political career--want of robust health and want of flexibility.\"\r\n\r\nCardinal Newman wrote: \"Gladstone's book, as you see, is making a\r\nsensation.\" And again: \"The _Times_ is again at poor Gladstone. Really I\r\nfeel as if I could do anything for him. I have not read his book, but\r\nits consequences speak for it. Poor fellow! it is so noble a thing.\"\r\n\r\nLord Macaulay, in the _Edinburgh Review_, April, 1839, in his well-known\r\nsearching criticism, while paying high tribute to the author's talents\r\nand character, said: \"We believe that we do him no more than justice\r\nwhen we say that his abilities and demeanor have obtained for him the\r\nrespect and good will of all parties.... That a young politician should,\r\nin the intervals afforded by his Parliamentary avocations, have\r\nconstructed and propounded, with much study and mental toil, an original\r\ntheory, on a great problem in politics, is a circumstance which,\r\nabstracted from all considerations of the soundness or unsoundness of\r\nhis opinions, must be considered as highly creditable to him. We\r\ncertainly cannot wish that Mr. Gladstone's doctrine may become\r\nfashionable among public men. But we heartily wish that his laudable\r\ndesire to penetrate beneath the surface of questions, and to arrive, by\r\nlong and intent meditation, at the knowledge of great general laws, were\r\nmuch more fashionable than we at all expect it to become.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this article, by Lord Macaulay, that the mow famous words\r\noccurred which former Conservative friends of Mr. Gladstone delight to\r\nrecall in view of his change of political opinions: \"The writer of this\r\nvolume is a young man of unblemished character and of distinguished\r\nparliamentary talents; the rising hope of those stern and unbending\r\nTories who follow, reluctantly and cautiously, a leader whose experience\r\nand eloquence are indispensable to them, but whose cautious temper and\r\nmoderate opinions they abhor. It would not be strange if Mr. Gladstone\r\nwere one of the most unpopular men in England.\"\r\n\r\nHigginson writes: \"The hope of the stern and unbending Tories has for\r\nyears been the unquestioned leader of English Liberals, and though he\r\nmay have been at times as unpopular as Macaulay could have predicted,\r\nthe hostility has come mainly from the ranks of those who were thus\r\nearly named as his friends. But whatever may have been Mr. Gladstone's\r\nopinions or affiliations, whoever may have been his friends or foes, the\r\ncredit of surpassing ability has always been his.\"\r\n\r\nIt was remarked by Lord Macaulay that the entire theory of Mr.\r\nGladstone's book rested upon one great fundamental proposition, namely,\r\nthat the propagation of religious truth is one of the chief ends of\r\ngovernment _as_ government; and he proceeded to combat this doctrine. He\r\ngranted that government was designed to protect our persons and our\r\nproperty, but declined to receive the doctrine of paternal government,\r\nuntil a government be shown that loved its subjects, as a father loves\r\nhis child, and was as superior in intelligence to its subjects as a\r\nfather was to his children. Lord Macaulay then demonstrated, by\r\nappropriate illustrations, the fallacy of the theory that every society\r\nof individuals with any power whatever, is under obligation as such\r\nsociety to profess a religion; and that there could be unity of action\r\nin large bodies without unity of religious views. Persecutions would\r\nnaturally follow, or be justifiable in an association where Mr.\r\nGladstone's views were paramount. It would be impossible to conceive of\r\nthe circumstances in which it would be right to establish by law, as the\r\none exclusive religion of the State, the religion of the minority. The\r\nreligious teaching which the sovereign ought officially to countenance\r\nand maintain is that from which he, in his conscience, believes that the\r\npeople will receive the most benefit with the smallest mixture of evil.\r\nIt is not necessarily his own religious belief that he will select. He\r\nmay prefer the doctrines of the Church of England to those of the Church\r\nof Scotland, but he would not force the former upon the inhabitants of\r\nScotland. The critic raised no objections, though he goes on to state\r\nthe conditions under which an established Church might be retained with\r\nadvantage. There are many institutions which, being set up, ought not\r\nto be rudely pulled down. On the 14th of June, 1839, the question of\r\nNational Education was introduced in the House of Commons by the\r\nMinistry of the day. Lord Stanley opposed the proposal of the government\r\nin a powerful speech, and offered an amendment to this effect: \"That an\r\naddress be presented to her Majesty to rescind the order in council for\r\nconstituting the proposed Board of Privy Council.\" The position of the\r\ngovernment was defended by Lord Morpeth, who, while he held his own\r\nviews respecting the doctrines of the Roman Catholics and also\r\nrespecting Unitarian tenets, he maintained that as long as the State\r\nthought it proper to employ Roman Catholic sinews, and to finger\r\nUnitarian gold, it could not refuse to extend to those by whom it so\r\nprofited the blessings of education. Speeches were also made by Lord\r\nAshley, Mr. Buller, Mr. O'Connell and others, and in the course of\r\ndebate reference was freely made to Mr. Gladstone's book on Church and\r\nState. Finally Mr. Gladstone rose and remarked, that he would not flinch\r\nfrom a word he had uttered or written upon religious subjects, and\r\nclaimed the right to contrast his principles, and to try results, in\r\ncomparison with those professed by Lord John Russell, and to ascertain\r\nthe effects of both upon the institutions of the country, so far as they\r\noperated upon the Established Church in England, in Scotland and in\r\nIreland. It was at this time that a very remarkable scene was witnessed\r\nin the House. Turning upon Mr. O'Connell, who had expressed his great\r\nfondness for statistics, Mr. Gladstone said the use he had made of them\r\nreminded him of an observation of Mr. Canning's, \"He had a great\r\naversion to hear of a fact in debate, but what he most distrusted was a\r\nfigure.\" He then proceeded to show the inadequacy of the figures\r\npresented by Mr. O'Connell. In reply to Lord Morpeth's declaration\r\nconcerning the duty of the State to provide education for Dissenters so\r\nlong as it fingered their gold, Mr. Gladstone said that if the State was\r\nto be regarded as having no other functions than that of representing\r\nthe mere will of the people as to religious tenets, he admitted the\r\ntruth of his principle, but not that the State could have a conscience.\r\nIt was not his habit to revile religion in any form, but he asked what\r\nground there was for restricting his lordship's reasoning to\r\nChristianity. He referred to the position held by the Jews upon this\r\neducational question, and read to the House an extract from a recent\r\npetition as follows: \"Your petitioners feel the deepest gratitude for\r\nthe expression of her Majesty's most gracious wish that the youth of the\r\ncountry should be religiously brought up, and the rights of conscience\r\nrespected, while they earnestly hope that the education of the people,\r\nJewish and Christian, will be sedulously connected with a due regard to\r\nthe Holy Scriptures.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone very pertinently asked how the education of the Jewish\r\npeople, who considered the New Testament an imposture, was \"to be\r\nsedulously connected with a due regard to the Holy Scriptures,\" which\r\nconsisted of the Old and New Testaments? To oblige the Jewish children\r\nto read the latter would be directly contrary to the views of the\r\ngentlemen on the other side of the House. He would have no child forced\r\nto do so, but he protested against paying money from the treasury of the\r\nState to men whose business it was to inculcate erroneous doctrines. The\r\ndebate was concluded, and the government carried its motion by a very\r\nsmall majority. Two years later, when the Jews' Civil Disabilities Bill\r\nwas before Parliament, Mr. Gladstone again took the unpopular side in\r\nthe debate and opposed the Bill, which was carried in the House of\r\nCommons but defeated in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone published, in 1840, another work, entitled \"Church\r\nPrinciples Considered in their Results.\" It was supplementary to his\r\nformer book in defense of Church and State, and was written \"beneath the\r\nshades of Hagley,\" the house of Lord and Lady Lyttelton, and dedicated\r\n\"in token of sincere affection\" to the author's life-long friend and\r\nrelative, Lord Lyttelton. He dwelt upon the leading moral\r\ncharacteristics of the English Episcopal Church, their intrinsic value\r\nand their adaptation to the circumstances of the times, and defined\r\nthese characteristics to be the doctrine of the visibility of the\r\nChurch, the apostolic succession in the ministry, the authority of the\r\nChurch in matters of faith and the truths symbolized in the sacraments.\r\n\r\nIn one chapter he strongly attacks Rationalism as a reference of the\r\ngospel to the depraved standard of the actual human natures and by no\r\nmeans to its understanding properly so called, as its measure and\r\ncriterion. He says: \"That therefore to rely upon the understanding,\r\nmisinformed as it is by depraved affections, as our adequate instructor\r\nin matters of religion, is most highly irrational.\" Nevertheless, \"the\r\nunderstanding has a great function in religion and is a medium to the\r\naffections, and may even correct their particular impulses.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to the question of the reconversion of England to\r\nCatholicism, earnestly desired by some, Mr. Gladstone forcibly remarked:\r\n\"England, which with ill grace and ceaseless efforts at remonstrance,\r\nendured the yoke when Rome was in her zenith, and when her powers were\r\nbut here and there evoked; will the same England, afraid of the truth\r\nwhich she has vindicated, or even with the license which has mingled\r\nlike a weed with its growth, recur to that system in its decrepitude\r\nwhich she repudiated in its vigor?\" If the Church of England ever lost\r\nher power, it would never be by submission to Rome, \"but by that\r\nprinciple of religions insubordination and self-dependence which, if it\r\nrefuse her tempered rule and succeed in its overthrow, will much more\r\nsurely refuse and much more easily succeed in resisting the\r\nunequivocally arbitrary impositions of the Roman scheme.\" Here is the\r\nkey-note of many of Mr. Gladstone's utterances in after years against\r\nthe pretentious and aspirations of Rome. The defense of the English\r\nChurch and its principles and opposition to the Church of Rome have been\r\nunchanging features in Mr. Gladstone's religious course. But, in the\r\nlight of these early utterances, some have criticised severely that\r\nlegislative act, carried through by him in later years, by which the\r\nDisestablishment of the Irish Church was effected. How could the author\r\nof \"The State in its Relations with the Church\" become the destroyer of\r\nthe fabric of the Irish Church?\r\n\r\nTo meet these charges of inconsistency Mr. Gladstone issued, in 1868, \"A\r\nChapter of Autobiography.\" The author's motives in putting forth this\r\nchapter of autobiography were two--first, there was \"the great and\r\nglaring change\" in his course of action with respect to the Established\r\nChurch of Ireland, which was not due to the eccentricity or perversion\r\nof an individual mind, but to the silent changes going on at the very\r\nbasis of modern society. Secondly, there was danger that a great cause\r\nthen in progress might suffer in point of credit, if not of energy and\r\nrapidity, from the real or supposed delinquencies of the author.\r\n\r\nHe stated that \"The author had upheld the doctrine that the Church was\r\nto be maintained for its truth, and that if the principle was good for\r\nEngland it was good for Ireland too. But he denied that he had ever\r\npropounded the maxim _simpliciter_ that we were to maintain the\r\nestablishment. He admitted that his opinion of the Church of Ireland was\r\nthe exact opposite of what it had been; but if the propositions of his\r\nwork were in conflict with an assault upon the existence of the Irish\r\nEstablishment, they were even more hostile to the grounds upon which it\r\nwas now sought to maintain it. He did not wish to maintain the Church\r\nupon the basis usually advanced, but for the benefit of the whole people\r\nof Ireland, and if it could not be maintained as the truth it could not\r\nbe maintained at all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone contended that the Irish Episcopal Church had fallen out\r\nof harmony with the spirit and use of the time, and must be judged by a\r\npractical rather than a theoretic test. In concluding the author puts\r\nantithetically the case for and against the maintenance of the Church of\r\nIreland: \"An establishment that does its work in much and has the hope\r\nand likelihood of doing it in more; that has a broad and living way open\r\nto it into the hearts of the people; that can command the services of\r\nthe present by the recollections and traditions of the past; able to\r\nappeal to the active zeal of the greater portion of the people, and to\r\nthe respect or scruples of living work and service, and whose\r\nadversaries, if she has them, are in the main content to believe that\r\nthere will be a future for them and their opinions; such an\r\nestablishment should surely be maintained.\r\n\r\n\"But an establishment that neither does nor has her hope of doing work,\r\nexcept for a few, and those few the portion of the community whose\r\nclaims to public aid is the smallest of all; an establishment severed\r\nfrom the mass of the people by an impassable gulf and a wall of brass;\r\nan establishment whose good offices, could she offer them, would be\r\nintercepted by a long, unbroken chain of painful and shameful\r\nrecollections; an establishment leaning for support upon the extraneous\r\naid of a State, which becomes discredited with the people by the very\r\nact of leading it; such an establishment will do well for its own sake,\r\nand for the sake of its creed, to divest itself, as soon as may be, of\r\ngauds and trappings, and to commence a new career, in which renouncing\r\nat once the credit and the discredit of the civil sanction, and shall\r\nseek its strength from within and put a fearless trust in the message\r\nthat it bears.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the reasons that led the defender of the Irish Church\r\nto become its assailant, \"That a man should change his opinions is no\r\nreproach to him; it is only inferior minds that are never open to\r\nconviction.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone is a firm Anglican, as we have seen, but the following\r\nextract from his address made at the Liverpool College, in December,\r\n1872, gives a fine insight as to the breadth of his Christian\r\nsentiments:\r\n\r\n\"Not less forcibly than justly, you hear much to the effect that the\r\ndivisions among Christians render it impossible to say what Christianity\r\nis, and so destroy all certainty as to the true religion. But if the\r\ndivisions among Christians are remarkable, not less so is their unity in\r\nthe greatest doctrines that they hold. Well-nigh fifteen hundred years\r\nhave passed away since the great controversies concerning the Deity and\r\nthe person of the Redeemer were, after a long agony, determined. As\r\nbefore that time, in a manner less defined but adequate for their day,\r\nso, even since that time, amid all chance and change, more--aye, many\r\nmore--than ninety-nine in every hundred Christians have, with one\r\nvoice, confessed the Deity and incarnation of our Lord as the cardinal\r\nand central truth of our religion. Surely there is some comfort here,\r\nsome sense of brotherhood; some glory due to the past, some hope for the\r\ntimes that are to come.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone as Prime Minister of England, during his several\r\nadministrations, has had a large Church patronage to dispense, in other\r\nwords, has been called upon, by virtue of his office, to till many\r\nvacancies in the Established Church, but it has been truly testified\r\nthat there has probably never been so laboriously conscientious a\r\ndistributor of ecclesiastical crown patronage as Mr. Gladstone. In his\r\necclesiastical appointments he never took politics into consideration. A\r\nconspicuous instance of this may be mentioned. When it was rumored that\r\nhe intended to recommend Dr. Benson, the present Archbishop, for the\r\nvacant See of Canterbury, a political supporter called to remonstrate\r\nwith him. Mr. Gladstone begged to know the ground of his objection. \"The\r\nBishop of Truro is a strong Tory,\" was the answer; \"but that is not all.\r\nHe has joined Mr. Raikes's election committee at Cambridge; and it was\r\nonly last week that Raikes made a violent personal attack upon\r\nyourself.\" \"Do you know,\" replied Mr. Gladstone, \"that you have just\r\nsupplied me with a strong argument in Dr. Benson's favor? for, if he\r\nhad been a worldly man or self-seeker he would not have done anything so\r\nimprudent.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone sympathized more or less with the Nonconformists\r\nstruggling against the application of university tests and other\r\ndisabilities from which the Dissenters suffered, but it was not until\r\n1876 that he really discovered the true religions work of the English\r\nNonconformists. The manner in which the Congregationalists, Baptists,\r\nQuakers and others rallied to the standard raised in the cause of\r\nBulgarian nationality effected a great change in his attitude towards\r\nhis Dissenting fellow countrymen. He entertained many of the\r\nrepresentative Nonconformist ministers at breakfast, and the fidelity\r\nand devotion of Nonconformists generally to the Bulgarian cause left on\r\nhis mind an impression which has only deepened with the lapse of time.\r\nThe extent to which this influences him may be gathered from the reply\r\nwhich he made to Dr. Döllinger whilst that learned divine was discussing\r\nwith him the question of Church and State. Dr. Döllinger was expressing\r\nhis surprise that Mr. Gladstone could possibly coquette in any way with\r\nthe party that demanded the severance of Church and State in either\r\nWales or Scotland. It was to him quite incomprehensible that a statesman\r\nwho held so profoundly the idea of the importance of religion could make\r\nhis own a cause whose avowed object was to cut asunder the Church from\r\nthe State. Mr. Gladstone listened attentively to Dr. Döllinger's\r\nremarks, and then, in an absent kind of way, said, \"But you forget how\r\nnobly the Nonconformists supported me at the time of the Eastern\r\nQuestion.\" The blank look of amazement on Dr. Döllinger's face showed\r\nthe wide difference between the standpoint of the politician and the\r\necclesiastic. But Mr. Gladstone knew upon whom to rely in the hour of\r\nneed, when great moral issues were at stake. The Bishops of the House of\r\nLords had not always done their duty. Lord Shaftesbury, himself a very\r\nardent Churchman, wrote, June 16, 1855, in reference to the Religious\r\nWorship Bill: \"The Bishops have exhibited great ignorance, bigotry and\r\nopposition to evangelical life and action, and have seriously injured\r\ntheir character, influence and position.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone never displayed more marked respect for the \"Nonconformist\r\nconscience\" than when, in deference to their earnest appeal, he risked\r\nthe great split in the Home Rule ranks that followed his repudiation of\r\nMr. Parnell. Mr. Gladstone never hesitated or made the slightest\r\npretense about the matter. If the Nonconformists had been as indifferent\r\nas the Churchmen, his famous letter about the Irish leadership would not\r\nhave been written. \"He merely acted, as he himself stated, as the\r\nregistrar of the moral temperature which made Mr. Parnell impossible.\r\nHe knew the men who are the Ironsides of his party too well not to\r\nunderstand that if he had remained silent the English Home Rulers would\r\nhave practically ceased to exist. He saw the need, rose to the occasion\r\nand cleared the obstacle which would otherwise have been a fatal\r\nimpediment to the success of his course. Mr. Gladstone is a practical\r\nstatesman, and with some instinct divined the inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's religious belief, as well as his opinion of the Bible\r\nand the plan of salvation revealed in the Gospel, are manifest as\r\nexpressed in the following words from his pen:\r\n\r\n\"If asked what is the remedy for the deeper sorrows of the human\r\nheart--what a man should chiefly look to in his progress through life as\r\nthe power that is to sustain him under trials and enable him manfully to\r\nconfront his afflictions--I must point him to something which, in a\r\nwell-known hymn is called 'the old, old story,' told of in an old, old\r\nbook, and taught with an old, old teaching, which is the greatest and\r\nbest gift ever given to mankind.\"\r\n\r\nAnother may read the lessons on the Lord's day in Hawarden Church and\r\nwrite and speak in defense of the Established Church of England, but Mr.\r\nGladstone did more--he put his trust in his Lord and Saviour, and\r\nbelieved in his word. Mr. Gladstone was denominationally a member of\r\nthe Episcopal Church, but religiously he held to views commonly held by\r\nall Evangelical Christians, from which the temptations of wealth at\r\nhome, of college and of politics never turned him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kilmainham Jail, where the Irish M.P.'s were confined in\r\n1883]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELS AND MARRIAGE\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone spent the winter of 1838-9 in Rome. The physicians had\r\nrecommended travel in the south of Europe for his health and\r\nparticularly for his eyes, the sight of which had become impaired by\r\nhard reading in the preparation of his book. He had given up lamps and\r\nread entirely by candle-light with injurious results. He was joined at\r\nRome by his friend, Henry Manning, afterwards Cardinal, and in company\r\nthey visited Monsignor, afterwards Cardinal, Wiseman, at the English\r\nCollege, on the feast of St. Thomas of Canterbury. They attended solemn\r\nmass in honor of that Saint, and the places in the missal were found for\r\nthem by a young student of the college, named Grant, who afterwards\r\nbecame Bishop of Southwark.\r\n\r\nBesides visiting Italy he explored Sicily, and kept a journal of his\r\ntour. Sicily is a beautiful and fertile island in the Mediterranean\r\nSea, and is the granary of Rome. His recorded observations show the\r\nkeenness of his perceptions and the intensity with which he enjoyed the\r\nbeautiful and wonderful in nature.\r\n\r\nMount Etna, the greatest volcano of Europe, and which rises 10,000 feet\r\nabove the sea, stirred his soul greatly, and he made an ascent of the\r\nmountain at the beginning of the great eruption of 1838. Etna has many\r\npoints of interest for all classes of scientific men, and not least for\r\nthe student of arboriculture. It bears at the height of 4000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea a wonderful growth--a very large tree--which is\r\nclaimed by some to be the oldest tree in the world. It is a venerable\r\nchestnut, and known as \"the father of the forest.\" It is certainly one\r\nof the most remarkable as well as celebrated of trees. It consists not\r\nof one vast trunk, but of a cluster of smaller decayed trees or portions\r\nof trees growing in a circle, each with a hollow trunk of great\r\nantiquity, covered with ferns or ivy, and stretching out a few gnarled\r\nbranches with scanty foliage. That it is one tree seems to be evident\r\nfrom the growth of the bark only on the outside. It is said that\r\nexcavations about the roots of the tree showed these various stems to be\r\nunited at a very small depth below the surface of the ground. It still\r\nbears rich foliage and much small fruit, though the heart of the trunk\r\nis decayed, and a public road leads through it wide enough for two\r\ncoaches to drive abreast. Travelers have differed in their measurements\r\nof this stupendous growth. Admiral Smyth, who takes the lowest estimate,\r\ngiving 163 feet, and Brydone giving, as the highest, 204 feet. In the\r\nmiddle of the cavity a hut is built, for the accommodation of those who\r\ncollect and preserve the chestnuts. One of the Queens of Arragon is\r\nreported to have taken shelter in this tree, with her mounted suite of\r\none hundred persons; but, \"we may, perhaps, gather from this that\r\nmythology is not confined to the lower latitudes.\"\r\n\r\nFurther up the mountain is another venerable chestnut, which, with more\r\nreason, probably, may be described without fear of contradiction as the\r\nlargest chestnut tree in the world. It rises from one solid stem to a\r\nremarkable height before it branches. At an elevation of two feet from\r\nthe earth its circumference was found by Brydone to be seventy-six feet.\r\nThese trees are reputed to have flourished for much more than a thousand\r\nyears. Their luxuriant growth is attributed in part to the humid\r\natmosphere of the Bosco, elevated above the scorching, arid region of\r\nthe coast, and in part to the great richness of the soil. The luxuriance\r\nof the vegetation on the slopes of Etna attracts the attention of every\r\ntraveler; and Mr. Gladstone remarked upon this point: \"It seems as\r\nthough the finest of all soils were produced from the most agonizing\r\nthroes of nature, as the hardiest characters are often reared amidst\r\nthe severest circumstances. The aspect of this side of Sicily is\r\ninfinitely more active and the country is cultivated as well as most\r\nparts of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nHe and his party started on the 30th of October, and found the path\r\nnearly uniform from Catania, but the country bore a volcanic aspect at\r\nevery step. At Nicolosi their rest was disturbed by the distant booming\r\nof the mountain. From this point to the Bosco the scenery is described\r\nas a dreary region, but the tract of the wood showed some beautiful\r\nplaces resembling an English park, with old oaks and abundant fern.\r\n\"Here we found flocks browsing; they are much exposed to sheep-stealers,\r\nwho do not touch travelers, calculating with justice that men do not\r\ncarry much money to the summit of Etna.\" The party passed the Casa degli\r\nInglesi, which registered a temperature of 31°, and then continued the\r\nascent on foot for the crater. A magnificent view of sunrise was\r\nhere obtained.\r\n\r\n\"Just before we reached the lip of the crater the guide exultingly\r\npointed out what he declared to be ordinarily the greatest sight of the\r\nmountain, namely, the shadow of the cone of Etna, drawn with the utmost\r\ndelicacy by the newly-risen sun, but of gigantic extent; its point at\r\nthis moment rested on the mountains of Palermo, probably one hundred\r\nmiles off, and the entire figure was visible, the atmosphere over the\r\nmountains having become and continuing perfectly and beautifully\r\ntransparent, although in the hundreds of valleys which were beneath us,\r\nfrom the east to the west of Sicily, and from the mountains of Messina\r\ndown to Cape Passaro, there were still abundant vapors waiting for a\r\nhigher sun to disperse them; but we enjoyed in its perfection this view\r\nof the earliest and finest work of the greater light of heaven, in the\r\npassage of his beams over this portion of the earth's surface. During\r\nthe hour we spent on the summit, the vision of the shadow was speedily\r\ncontracting, and taught us how rapid is the real rise of the sun in the\r\nheavens, although its effect is diminished to the eye by a kind of\r\nforeshortening.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer next describes in vivid and powerful language the scene\r\npresented to the view at the very mouth of the crater. A large space,\r\none mile in circumference, which a few days before had been one\r\nfathomless pit, from which issued masses of smoke, was now absolutely\r\nfilled up to within a few feet of the brim all round. A great mass of\r\nlava, a portion of the contents of this immense pit, was seen to detach\r\nitself by degrees from one behind. \"It opened like an orange, and we saw\r\nthe red-hot fibres stretch in a broader and still broader vein, until\r\nthe mass had found a support on the new ground it occupied in front; as\r\nwe came back on our way down this had grown black.\" A stick put to it\r\ntook fire immediately. Within a few yards of this lava bed were found\r\npieces of ice, formed on the outside of the stones by Frost, \"which here\r\ndisputes every inch of ground with his fierce rival Fire.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone and his fellow-travelers were the first spectators of the\r\ngreat volcanic action of this year. From the highest peak attainable the\r\ncompany gazed upon the splendid prospect to the east spread out before\r\nthem, embracing the Messina Mountains and the fine kindred outline of\r\nthe Calabrian coast, described by Virgil in the third book of the\r\nAeneid. Mr. Gladstone graphically describes the eruption which took\r\nplace and of which he was the enraptured witness. Lava masses of 150 to\r\n200 pounds weight were thrown to a distance of probably a mile and a\r\nhalf; smaller ones to a distance even more remote. The showers were\r\nabundant and continuous, and the writer was impressed by the closeness\r\nof the descriptions in Virgil with the actual reality of the eruption\r\nwitnessed by himself. On this point he observes:\r\n\r\n\"Now how faithfully has Virgil (Ae. iii, 571, et seq.) comprised these\r\nparticulars, doubtless without exaggeration, in his fine description!\r\nFirst, the thunder-clap, or crack--\r\n\r\n     'Horrificis juxta tonat Aetna ruinis.'\r\n\r\nSecondly, the vibration of the ground to the report--\r\n\r\n     'Et, fessum quoties mutet latus, intremere omnem\r\n      Murmure Trinacriam.'\r\n\r\nThirdly, the sheet of flame--\r\n\r\n     'Attolitque globos flarmmarum, et sidera lambit.'\r\n\r\nFourthly, the smoke--\r\n\r\n     'Et coelum subtexere fumo.'\r\n\r\nFifthly, the fire shower--\r\n\r\n     'Scopulos avulsaque viscera montis\r\n      Erigit erucatans, liquefactaque saxa sub auras\r\n      Cum gemitu glomerat, fundoque exae tuat imo.'\r\n\r\nSixthly the column of ash--\r\n\r\n     'Atram prorumpit ad aethera nubem\r\n      Turbine fumantem piceo et candente favilla.'\r\n\r\nAnd this is within the limits of twelve lines. Modern poetry has its own\r\nmerits, but the conveyance of information is not, generally speaking,\r\none of them. What would Virgil have thought of authors publishing poems\r\nwith explanatory notes (to illustrate is a different matter), as if they\r\nwere so many books of conundrums? Indeed this vice is of very\r\nlate years.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire description, of which this is but an extract, is very\r\neffective and animated, and gives with great vividness the first\r\nimpressions of a mind susceptible to the grand and imposing aspects\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\n\"After Etna,\" says Mr. Gladstone in his diary, \"the temples are\r\ncertainly the great charm and attraction of Sicily. I do not know\r\nwhether there is any one among them which, taken alone, exceeds in\r\nbeauty that of Neptune, at Paestum; but they have the advantage of\r\nnumber and variety, as well as of highly interesting positions. At\r\nSegesta the temple is enthroned in a perfect mountain solitude, and it\r\nis like a beautiful tomb of its religion, so stately, so entire; while\r\naround, but for one solitary house of the keeper, there is nothing,\r\nabsolutely nothing, to disturb the apparent reign of Silence and of\r\nDeath.... The temples enshrine a most pure and salutary principle of\r\nart, that which connects grandeur of effect with simplicity of detail;\r\nand, retaining their beauty and their dignity in their decay, they\r\nrepresent the great man when fallen, as types of that almost highest of\r\nhuman qualities--silent yet not sullen, endurance.\"\r\n\r\nWhile sojourning at Rome Mr. Gladstone met Lord Macaulay. Writing home\r\nfrom Rome in the same year, Lord Macaulay says: \"On Christmas Eve I\r\nfound Gladstone in the throng, and I accosted him, as we had met, though\r\nwe had never been introduced to each other. He received my advances with\r\nvery great _empressement_ indeed, and we had a good deal of pleasant\r\ntalk.\" And again he writes: \"I enjoyed Italy immensely; far more than I\r\nhad expected. By-the-by, I met Gladstone at Rome. We talked and walked\r\ntogether in St. Peter's during the best part of an afternoon. He is\r\nboth a clever and an amiable man.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the visitors at Rome the winter that Mr. Gladstone spent in the\r\neternal city were the widow and daughters of Sir Stephen Richard Glynne,\r\nof Hawarden Castle, Flintshire, Wales. He had already made the\r\nacquaintance of these ladies, having been a friend of Lady Glynne's\r\neldest son at Oxford, and having visited him at Hawarden in 1835. He was\r\nthrown much into their society while at Rome, and became engaged to the\r\nelder of Lady Glynne's daughters, Catharine Glynne. It is strange to\r\nrelate that some time before this when Miss Glynne met her future\r\nhusband at a dinner-party, an English minister sitting next to her had\r\nthus drawn her attention to Mr. Gladstone: \"Mark that young man; he will\r\nyet be Prime Minister of England.\" Miss Glynne and her sister were known\r\nas \"the handsome Miss Glynnes.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam E. Gladstone and Catharine Glynne were married July 25, 1839, at\r\nHawarden Castle. At the same time and place Miss Mary Glynne was married\r\nto George William, fourth Lord Lyttleton, with whom Mr. Gladstone was on\r\nthe most intimate terms of friendship until his lordship's untoward and\r\nlamented death. The brother of these ladies was Sir Stephen Glynne, the\r\nthen owner of Hawarden. Mrs. Gladstone was \"in her issue heir\" of Sir\r\nStephen Glynne, who was ninth and last baronet of that name.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony has been thus described by an eye-witness:\r\n\r\n\"For some time past the little town of Hawarden has been in a state of\r\nexcitement in consequence of the anticipated nuptials of the two sisters\r\nof Sir Stephen Glynne, Bart., M.P., who have been engaged for some time\r\npast to Lord Lyttelton and to Mr. W. Ewart Gladstone. Thursday last\r\n(July 25th) was fixed upon for the ceremony to take place; but in\r\nconsequence of the Chartists having attacked Lord Lyttelton's mansion in\r\nWorcestershire, it was feared that the marriage would be delayed. All\r\nanxieties on this subject were put an end to by orders being issued to\r\nmake ready for the ceremony, and the Hawarden folks lost no time in\r\nmaking due preparations accordingly. The church was elegantly and\r\nprofusely decorated with laurels, while extremely handsome garlands,\r\ncomposed of the finest flowers, were suspended from the venerable roof.\r\nAbout half-past ten a simultaneous rising of the assembled multitude and\r\nthe burst of melody from the organ announced that the fair brides had\r\narrived, and all eyes were turned towards the door to witness the bridal\r\n_cortege_. In a few minutes more the party arrived at the communion\r\ntable and the imposing ceremony commenced. At this period the _coup\r\nd'oeil_ was extremely interesting. The bridal party exhibited every\r\nelegance of costume; while the dresses of the multitude, lit up by the\r\nrays of a brilliant sunlight, filled up the picture. The Rev. the Hon.\r\nG. Neville performed the ceremony. At its conclusion the brides visited\r\nthe rectory, whence they soon afterwards set out--Lord and Lady\r\nLyttelton to their seat in Worcestershire, and Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone on\r\na visit to Sir Richard Brooke, Norton Priory Mansion, in Cheshire. The\r\nbridal party having returned to the castle, the good folks of Hawarden\r\nfilled up the day with rambling over Sir Stephen Glynne's delightful\r\npark, to which free access was given to all comers; and towards evening\r\na dance on the green was got up.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that by his marriage Mr. Gladstone became allied\r\nwith the house of Grenville, a family of statesmen, which, directly or\r\nin its ramifications, had already supplied England with four Prime\r\nMinisters. Baron Bunsen, who made his acquaintance that year, writes\r\nthat he \"was delighted with the man who is some day to govern England if\r\nhis book is not in the way.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gladstone is widely and deservedly known for her many philanthropic\r\nenterprises, but even better, perhaps, has proved herself to be a noble\r\nand devoted wife and mother. She has cheered by her sympathy her\r\nillustrious husband in his defeats as well as in his triumphs, in the\r\nmany great undertakings of his political career, and been to him all the\r\nlate Viscountess Beaconsfield was to Mr. Gladstone's Parliamentary\r\nrival. As a mother, she nursed and reared all her children, and ever\r\nkept them in the maternal eye, carefully watching over and tending them.\r\nOne of the most interesting buildings at Hawarden is Mrs. Gladstone's\r\norphanage, which stands close to the castle. Here desolate orphans are\r\nwell cared for, and find, until they are prepared to enter on the\r\nconflict and to encounter the cares of life, a happy home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gladstone, although in many respects an ideal wife, was never able\r\nto approach her husband in the methodical and business-like arrangement\r\nof her affairs. Shortly after their wedding, the story runs, Mr.\r\nGladstone seriously took in hand the tuition of his handsome young wife\r\nin book-keeping, and Mrs. Gladstone applied herself with diligence to\r\nthe unwelcome task. Some time after she came down in triumph to her\r\nhusband to display her domestic accounts and her correspondence, all\r\ndocketed in a fashion which she supposed would excite the admiration of\r\nher husband. Mr. Gladstone cast his eye over the results of his wife's\r\nlabor and exclaimed in despair: \"You have done them all wrong, from\r\nbeginning to end!\" His wife, however, has been so invaluable a helpmeet\r\nin other ways that it seems somewhat invidious to recall that little\r\nincident. She had other work to do, and she wisely left the accounts to\r\nher husband and his private secretaries.\r\n\r\nThe union of Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone has been blessed by eight children,\r\nall of whom save two still survive. There were four sons, the eldest,\r\nWilliam Henry, was a member of the Legislature, and the second, the Rev.\r\nStephen Edward Gladstone, is rector of Hawarden. The third son is named\r\nHenry Neville and the fourth Herbert John Gladstone. The former is\r\nengaged in commerce and the latter is the popular member for Leeds. The\r\neldest daughter, Anne, is married to Rev. E.C. Wickham, A.M., headmaster\r\nof Wellington College; and the second, Catharine Jessy Gladstone, died\r\nin 1850; the third daughter, Mary, is married to Rev. W. Drew, and the\r\nfourth, Helen Gladstone, is principal of Newnham College. As Sir John\r\nGladstone had the pleasure of seeing his son William Ewart become a\r\ndistinguished member of Parliament, so Mr. Gladstone in his turn was\r\nable to witness his eldest son take his seat in the British Senate.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad bereavement when the Gladstones were called upon to part\r\nwith their little daughter, Catharine Jessy, April 9, 1850, between four\r\nand five years old. Her illness was long and painful, and Mr. Gladstone\r\nbore his part in the nursing and watching. He was tenderly fond of his\r\nlittle children and the sorrow had therefore a peculiar bitterness. But\r\nMr. Gladstone has since had another sad experience of death entering the\r\nfamily circle. July 4, 1891, the eldest son, William Henry Gladstone,\r\ndied. The effect upon the aged father was greatly feared, and the world\r\nsympathized with the great statesman and father in his sad trial, and\r\nwith the afflicted family. In a letter dated July 9, the day after the\r\ninterment, Mr. Gladstone wrote:\r\n\r\n\"We, in our affliction are deeply sensible of the mercies of God. He\r\ngave us for fifty years a most precious son. He has now only hidden him\r\nfor a very brief space from the sight of our eyes. It seems a violent\r\ntransition from such thoughts to the arena of political contention, but\r\nthe transition may be softened by the conviction we profoundly hold that\r\nwe, in the first and greatest of our present controversies, work for the\r\nhonor, well-being and future peace of our opponents not less than\r\nfor our own.\"\r\n\r\nWhen away from the trammels of office, Mr. Gladstone taught his elder\r\nchildren Italian. All the sons went to Eton and Oxford, and the\r\ndaughters were educated at home by English, French and German\r\ngovernesses. A close union of affection and sentiment has always been a\r\nmarked characteristic of this model English family. Marriage and\r\ndomestic cares, however, made little difference in Mr. Gladstone's\r\nmode of life. He was still the diligent student, the constant debater\r\nand the copious writer that he had been at Eton, at Oxford and in\r\nthe Albany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OFFICIAL RESIDENCE OF THE BRITISH PREMIER, No. 10\r\nDOWNING STREET, LONDON.]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of their married life, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone lived in\r\nLondon with Lady Glynne, at 13 Carlton House Terrace. Later they lived\r\nat 6 Carlton Gardens, which was made over to them by Sir John Gladstone;\r\nthen again at 13 Carlton House Terrace; and when Mr. Gladstone was in\r\noffice, at the official residence of the Prime Minister, Downing Street.\r\nIn 1850 Mr. Gladstone succeeded to his patrimony, and in 1856 he bought\r\n11 Carlton House Terrace, which was his London house for twenty years;\r\nand he subsequently lived for four years at 73 Harley Street. During the\r\nparliamentary recess Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone divided their time between\r\nFasque, Sir John Gladstone's seat in Kincardineshire, and Hawarden\r\nCastle, which they shared with Mrs. Gladstone's brother, Sir Stephen\r\nGlynne, till in his death in 1874, when it passed into their sole\r\npossession. In 1854 Mrs. Gladstone's brother added to the castle a new\r\nwing, which he especially dedicated to his illustrious brother-in-law,\r\nand which is fondly known as \"The Gladstone Wing.\" And Mr. Gladstone,\r\nhaving only one country house, probably spent as much time at Hawarden\r\nas any other minister finds it possible to devote to residence out\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nHawarden, usually pronounced Harden, is the name of a large market-town,\r\nfar removed from the centre and seat of trade and empire, in Flintshire,\r\nNorth Wales, six miles southwest from the singular and ancient city of\r\nChester, of which it may be called a suburb. It is not pretty, but a\r\nclean and tolerably well-built place, with some good houses and the\r\nusual characteristics of a Welsh village. The public road from Chester\r\nto Hawarden, which passes by the magnificent seat of the Duke of\r\nWestminster, is not, except for this, interesting to the stranger. There\r\nis a pedestrian route along the banks of the river Dee, over the lower\r\nferry and across the meadows. But for the most part the way lies along\r\ndreary wastes, unadorned by any of the beautiful landscape scenery so\r\ncommon in Wales. Broughton Hall, its pleasant church and quiet\r\nchurchyard, belonging to the Hawarden estate, are passed on the way. The\r\nvillage lies at the foot of the Castle, and outside of the gates of\r\nHawarden Park. The parish contains 13,000 acres, and of these the estate\r\nof Mr. Gladstone consists of nearly 7000. The road from the village for\r\nthe most part is dreary, but within the gates the park is as beautiful\r\nas it is extensive. Richly wooded, on both sides of its fine drive are\r\ncharming vistas opening amongst the oaks, limes and elms. On the height\r\nto the left of the drive is the ancient Hawarden Castle, for there are\r\ntwo--the old and the new--the latter being the more modern home of the\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARK GATE, HAWARDEN.]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Castle of Hawarden, situated on an eminence commanding an\r\nextensive prospect, is now in ruins. What, however, was left of the old\r\nCastle at the beginning of the century stands to-day a monument of the\r\nmassive work of the early masons. The remnant, which ages of time and\r\nthe Parliamentary wars and the strange zeal of its first owner under\r\nCromwell for its destruction, allowed to remain, is in a marvelous state\r\nof preservation, and the masonry in some places fifteen feet thick.\r\nThere is a grandeur in the ruin to be enjoyed, as well as a scene of\r\nbeauty from its towers. The old Castle, like the park itself, is open to\r\nthe public without restriction. Only two requests are made in the\r\ninterests of good order. One is that visitors entering the park kindly\r\nkeep to the gravel walks, while the other is that they do not inscribe\r\ntheir names on the stone-work of the ancient ruin, which request has\r\nbeen unheeded.\r\n\r\nThis ancient Castle was doubtless a stronghold of the Saxons in very\r\nearly times, for it was found in the possession of Edwin of Mercia at\r\nthe Norman Conquest, and was granted by William the Conqueror to his\r\nnephew, Hugh Lupus. In later times Prince Llewelyn was Lord of Hawarden,\r\nof which he was dispossessed by his brother, David. It was only after\r\nWales was conquered that Hawarden became an English stronghold, held\r\nagainst the Welsh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HAWARDEN CASTLE.]\r\n\r\nThe Castle had its vicissitudes, both as to its condition and\r\nproprietorship, for many years, even generations. Somewhere between 1267\r\nand 1280 the Castle had been destroyed and rebuilt. It was rebuilt in\r\nthe time of Edward I or Edward II, and formed one link in the chain by\r\nwhich the Edwards held the Welsh to their loyalty. Its name appears in\r\nthe doomsday-book, where it is spelled Haordine. It was presented by\r\nKing Edward to the House of Salisbury. Then the Earls of Derby came\r\ninto possession, and they entertained within its walls Henry VII in the\r\nlatter part of the fifteenth century. During the Parliamentary wars it\r\nwas held at first for the Parliament, and was taken by siege in 1643.\r\nThe royalists were in possession two years later, and at Christmas time,\r\nin 1645, Parliament ordered that the Castle be dismantled, which was\r\neffectively done. The latest proprietor of those times was James, Earl\r\nof Derby. He was executed and the estates were sold. They were purchased\r\nby Sergeant Glynne, Lord Chief Justice of England under Cromwell, from\r\nwhom in a long line of descent they were inherited, upon the death of\r\nthe last baronet, Sir Stephen Glynne, in 1874, by the wife of William E.\r\nGladstone. Sergeant Glynne's son, Sir William, the first baronet, when\r\nhe came into possession, was seized with the unaccountable notion of\r\nfurther destroying the old Castle, and by the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury very little remained beyond what stands to-day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GLIMPSE OF THE CASTLE FROM THE PARK.]\r\n\r\nHawarden is supposed to be synonymous with the word Burg-Ardden, Ardin,\r\na fortified mound or hill. It is usually supposed to be an English word,\r\nbut of Welsh derivation, and is no doubt related to dinas, in Welsh the\r\nexact equivalent to the Saxon _burg_. The Welsh still call it Penarlas,\r\na word the etymology of which points to a period when the lowlands of\r\nSaltney were under water, and the Castle looked over a lake. The\r\nearlier history of the Castle goes back to the time when it was held by\r\nthe ancient Britons, and stood firm against Saxon, Dane, or whatever\r\ninvading foe sought to deprive the people of their heritage in the\r\nsoil. On the invasion of William, as we have seen, it was in the\r\npossession of Edwin, sovereign of Deira. \"We find it afterwards,\" says\r\nanother account, \"in the possession of Roger Fitzvalarine, a son of one\r\nof the adventurers who came over with the Conqueror. Then it was held,\r\nsubordinately, by the Monthault, or Montalt, family, the stewards of the\r\npalatinate of Chester. It is remarkable, as we noticed in our story of\r\nHughenden Manor, that as the traditions of that ancient place touched\r\nthe memory of Simon de Montfort, the great Earl of Leicester, so do they\r\nalso in the story of the old Castle of Hawarden. Here Llewelyn, the last\r\nnative prince of Wales, held a memorable conference with the Earl. With\r\nin the walls of Hawarden was signed the treaty of peace between Wales\r\nand Cheshire, not long to last; here Llewelyn saw the beautiful daughter\r\nof De Montfort, whose memory haunted him so tenderly and so long. Again\r\nwe find the Castle in the possession of the Montalt family, from whom it\r\ndescended to the Stanleys, the Earl of Derby.... Here the last native\r\nprinces of Wales, Llewelyn and David, attempted to grasp their crumbling\r\nsceptre, Here no doubt halted Edward I, 'girt with many a baron bold;'\r\nhere the Tudor prince, Henry VII, of Welsh birth, visited in the later\r\nyears of the fifteenth century; and this was the occasion upon which it\r\npassed into the family whose representatives had proclaimed him monarch\r\non Bosworth field. But when James, Earl of Derby, was beheaded, after\r\nthe battle of Worcester, in 1651, the estate was purchased under the\r\nSequestration Act by Sergeant Glynne, whose portrait hangs over the\r\nmantleshelf of the drawing-room; 'but,' says Mrs. Gladstone, in calling\r\nour attention to it, 'he is an ancestor of whom we have no occasion to\r\nbe and are not proud.'\"\r\n\r\nThis remark of Mrs. Gladstone's may be explained by the following from\r\nthe pen of a reputable author: \"Sergeant Glynne, who flourished\r\n(literally flourished) during the seventeenth century, was a most\r\nunscrupulous man in those troubled times. He was at first a supporter of\r\nCharles I, then got office and preferment under Cromwell, and yet again,\r\nlike a veritable Vicar of Bray, became a Royalist on the return of\r\nCharles II. The Earl of Derby, who was taken prisoner at the battle of\r\nWorcester, in 1661, was executed, and his estates forfeited. Of these\r\nestates Sergeant Glynne managed to get possession of Hawarden; and\r\nthough on the Restoration all Royalists' forfeited estates were ordered\r\nto be restored, Glynne managed somehow to remain in possession of the\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERFALL IN HAWARDEN PARK.]\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that Hawarden Castle was no exception to those cruel\r\nhaunts of feudal tyranny and oppression belonging to the days of its\r\npower. Many years ago, when the rubbish was cleared away beneath the\r\nCastle ruin, a flight of steps was found, at the foot of which was a\r\ndoor, and a draw-bridge, which crossed a long, deep chasm, neatly faced\r\nwith freestone; then another door leading to several small rooms, all,\r\nprobably, places of confinement; and those hollows, now fringed with\r\ntimber trees, in those days constituted a broad, deep fosse.\r\n\r\nThe old Hawarden Castle, a curious ruin covered with moss and ivy, like\r\nmany other ancient piles of stone in historic England, is a reminder of\r\na past and warlike age, when an Englishman's home had to be a castle to\r\nprotect him and his family from his enemies. But times have changed for\r\nthe better, and long immunity from internal foes and invading armies has\r\nhad its peaceful effects upon the lands and the homes of men. As the\r\ngrounds of Hawarden show the remarkable cultivation produced by long\r\nperiods of peaceful toil, so the ancient castle has given way for the\r\nmodern dwelling, a peaceful abode whose only protecting wall is that\r\nwith which the law surrounds it.\r\n\r\nModern Hawarden Castle is a castle only in name. The new \"Castle\" has\r\nbeen the home of the Glynns' for generations, and ever since the\r\nmarriage of Mr. Gladstone and Miss Glynn has been the dwelling of the\r\nGladstones. Mr. Gladstone has greatly improved the Hawarden estate and\r\nthe castle has not been overlooked. Among the improvements to the castle\r\nmay be named the additions to the library and the Golden Wedding Porch.\r\n\r\nThe new Castle was begun in 1752, by Sir John Glynne, who \"created a\r\nstout, honest, square, red-brick mansion;\" which was added to and\r\naltered in the Gothic style in 1814. The Glynnes lived in Oxfordshire\r\ntill early in the eighteenth century, when they built themselves a small\r\nhouse, which was on the site of the present Castle. The new Hawarden\r\nCastle stands in front of the massive ruin of the old Castle, which has\r\nlooked down on the surrounding country for six centuries. A recent\r\nwriter speaking of the new structure as a sham Castle, with its plaster\r\nand stucco, and imitation turrets, says: \"It would not have been\r\nsurprising if the old Castle had, after the manner of Jewish chivalry,\r\ntorn its hair of thickly entwined ivy, rent its garments of moss and\r\nlichen, and fallen down prostrate, determined forever to shut out the\r\nsight of the modern monstrosity.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the author somewhat relents and thus describes the modern\r\nedifice:\r\n\r\n\"The aspect of the house is very impressive and imposing, as it first\r\nsuddenly seems to start upon the view after a long carriage-drive\r\nthrough the noble trees, if not immediately near, but breaking and\r\nbrightening the view on either hand; yet, within and without, the house\r\nseems like its mighty master--not pensive but rural; it does not even\r\nbreathe the spirit of quiet. Its rooms look active and power-compelling,\r\nand we could not but feel that they were not indebted to any of the\r\naesthetic inventions and elegancies of furniture for their charm. Thus\r\nwe have heard of one visitor pathetically exclaiming, 'Not one _dado_\r\nadorns the walls!' Hawarden is called a Castle, but it has not, either\r\nin its exterior or interior, the aspect of a Castle. It is a home; it\r\nhas a noble appearance as it rises on the elevated ground, near the old\r\nfeudal ruin which it has superseded, and looks over the grand and\r\nforest-like park, the grand pieces of broken ground, dells and hollows,\r\nand charming woodlands.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURT YARD, HAWARDEN CASTLE.]\r\n\r\nThe traditional history of Hawarden Church, as well as that of the\r\nCastle, travels back to a very remote antiquity, and is the central\r\npoint of interest to many a tragedy, and some of a very grotesque\r\ncharacter. For instance, for many ages the inhabitants of Hawarden were\r\ncalled \"Harden Jews,\" and for this designation we have the following\r\nlegendary account. In the year 946, during the reign of Cynan ap Elisap\r\nAnarawd, King of Gwynedd North, there was a Christian temple at Harden,\r\nand a rood-loft, in which was placed an image of the Virgin Mary, with a\r\nvery large cross in her hands, which was called \"holy rood.\" During a\r\nvery hot and dry summer the inhabitants prayed much and ardently for\r\nrain, but without any effect. Among the rest, Lady Trowst, wife of\r\nSytsyllt, governor of Harden Castle, went also to pray, when, during\r\nthis exercise, the holy rood fell upon her head and killed her. Such\r\nbehavior upon the part of this wooden Virgin could be tolerated no\r\nlonger. A great tumult ensued in consequence, and it was concluded to\r\ntry the said Virgin for murder, and the jury not only found her guilty\r\nof wilful murder, but of inattention in not answering the prayers of\r\ninnumerable petitioners. The sentence was hanging, but Span, of Mancot,\r\nwho was one of the jury, opposed this act saying it was best to drown,\r\nsince it was rain they prayed for. This was fiercely opposed by Corbin,\r\nof the gate, who advised that she should be laid on the sands by the\r\nriver. So, this being done, the tide carried the lady, floating gently,\r\nlike another lady, Elaine, upon its soft bosom, and placed her near the\r\nwalls of Caerleon (now Chester), where she was found next day, says the\r\nlegend, drowned and dead. Here the inhabitants of Caerleon buried her.\r\nUpon this occasion, it is said, the river, which had until then been\r\ncalled the Usk, was changed to Rood Die, or Rood Dee. We need not stay\r\nhere to analyze some things belonging to locality and etymology, which\r\nappear to us somewhat anachronistic and contradictory in this ancient\r\nand queer legend.\r\n\r\nHawarden Church is a fairly large structure, externally a plain old\r\nbrick building with a low tower and a dwarf spire, standing in the midst\r\nof a large population of graves. There is preserved in the annals of\r\nthe Church a list of the rectors of Hawarden as far back as 1180.\r\n\r\nAbout forty years ago a fire broke out in the Church, and when all was\r\nover, very little was left of the original structure except the walls.\r\nIt was restored with great expedition, and was re-opened within the same\r\nyear. The present building is a restoration to the memory of the\r\nimmediate ancestor, from whom the estate is derived by the present\r\nfamily. It is the centre of hard, earnest work, done for an\r\nexceptionally large parish. But the Church population is occasionally\r\nrecruited from all the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the Gladstone family worship on the plain, uncushioned\r\npew, near the lectern and opposite the pulpit. When the estates came\r\ninto the hands of the Glynnes the living was bestowed upon a member of\r\nthe family. The Rector is Rev. Stephen Gladstone, second son of the\r\nPremier. He is not a great preacher, but he is quietly earnest and\r\ninstructive. Mr. Gladstone was up early on Sunday mornings and seldom\r\nfailed to be in his pew at Church. Crowds filled the Church Sunday,\r\nmorning and evening, week after week, many of them strangers, to see the\r\nPrime Minister of England, and behold him leave his pew and, standing at\r\nthe reading-desk, go through his part of the service--that of reading\r\nthe lessons for the day, in this obscure village Church. After church\r\nMr. Gladstone went to the rectory with his family, with his cloak only\r\nover his shoulders, when the weather required, and as he walked along\r\nthe path through the churchyard would bow to the crowds that stood on\r\neither side uncovered to greet him as he passed by. The two brothers,\r\nuntil recently, lived at the rectory, and the whole family seemed to\r\nlive in the most beautiful harmony together.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone attribute much of his health to the fact\r\nthat he will have his Sabbath to himself and his family, undisturbed by\r\nany of the agitations of business, the cares of State, or even the\r\nrecreations of literature and scholastic study. This profound public\r\nregard for the day of rest, whether in London or at Hawarden, awakens a\r\nfeeling of admiration and puts us in mind of his great predecessor in\r\nstatesmanship, Cecil, Lord Burleigh, who, when he arrived at Theobalds\r\non a Saturday evening would throw off his cloak or chain of office and\r\nexclaim, \"Lie there and rest, my good lord treasurer.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REV. H. DREW, WARDEN OF ST. DENIOL'S.]\r\n\r\nOne of the main points of interest at the home of Mr. Gladstone is the\r\nlibrary. There is not a room in Hawarden Castle in which there is not an\r\nabundance of books, which are not all collected in the library, but\r\ndistributed all over the house. Where other people have cabinets for\r\ncuriosities, china, etc., there are here shelves and cases full of\r\nbooks. In ante-room and bed-room dressing-room and nursery they are\r\nfound, not by single volumes, but in serried ranks; well-known and\r\nuseful books. But it is in the library where Mr. Gladstone has collected\r\nby years of careful selection, a most valuable and large array of\r\nbooks, from all parts of the world, upon every subject. These books are\r\nclassified and so arranged as to be of immediate use. All those on one\r\nparticular subject are grouped together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY'S DOVECOTE]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was a familiar figure in the book stores, and especially\r\nwhere rare, old books were to be found, and he seldom failed to return\r\nhome with some book in his pocket. Mrs. Gladstone is said to have gone\r\nthrough his pockets often upon his return home, and sent back many a\r\nvolume to the book-seller, that had found its way to the pocket of her\r\nhusband, after a hasty glance at its title. He kept himself informed of\r\nall that was going on in the literary, scientific and artistic worlds,\r\nreceiving each week a parcel of the newest books for his private\r\nreadings. Every day he looked over several book-sellers's catalogues,\r\nand certain subjects were sure of getting an order.\r\n\r\nHawarden library gave every evidence of being for use, and not show. Mr.\r\nGladstone knew what books he had and was familiar with their contents.\r\nSome books were in frequent use, but others were not forgotten. He could\r\nput his hand on any one he wanted to refer to. At the end of a volume\r\nread he would construct an index of his own by which he could find\r\npassages to which he wished to refer.\r\n\r\nThere are few stories that Mr. Gladstone told with greater relish than\r\none concerning Sir Antonio Panizzi, who many years ago visited the\r\nlibrary at Hawarden. Looking round the room and at its closely packed\r\nshelves, he observed in a patronizing tone, \"I see you have got some\r\nbooks here.\" Nettled at this seemingly slighting allusion to the paucity\r\nof his library, Mr. Gladstone asked Panizzi how many volumes he thought\r\nwere on the shelves. Panizzi replied: \"From five to six thousand.\" Then\r\na loud and exulting laugh rang round the room as Mr. Gladstone answered:\r\n\"You are wrong by at least two thousand, as there are eight thousand\r\nvolumes and more before you now.\" Since then the library has\r\ngrown rapidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DINING ROOM IN THE ORPHANAGE, HAWARDEN.]\r\n\r\nThe fate of this large library was naturally a matter of much\r\nconsideration to Mr. Gladstone. It was particularly rich in classical\r\nand theological works, so it occured to its owner to form a public\r\nlibrary under a trusteeship, for the benefit of students, under the care\r\nof the Rector of Hawarden, or some other clergyman. So he caused to be\r\nerected at a cost to him of about $5,000, a corrugated iron building on\r\na knoll just outside Hawarden Church. The name of this parish library is\r\n\"The St. Deiniol's Theological and General Library of Hawarden.\" In\r\n1891, Mr. Gladstone had deposited about 20,000 volumes upon the shelves\r\nin this new building, with his own hands, which books were carried in\r\nhand-carts from the castle. Since that time thousands have been added to\r\nthis valuable collection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STAIRCASE IN THE ORPHANAGE, HAWARDEN.]\r\n\r\nIt was a happy thought of Mr. Gladstone to found a theological library\r\nin the immediate vicinity of Hawarden; also to have connected with it a\r\nhostel where students could be boarded and lodged for six dollars a week\r\nand thus be enabled to use the library in the pursuit of their studies.\r\nMr. Gladstone has endowed the institution with $150,000. Rev. H. Drew,\r\nthe son-in-law of Mr. Gladstone, is warden and librarian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAWARDEN CHURCH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nENTERS THE CABINET\r\n\r\nWe come now to another memorable period in the life of William E.\r\nGladstone. This period, beginning with 1840, has been styled \"a\r\nmemorable decade\" in the history of Parliament. His marriage and the\r\npublication of his first book were great events in his eventful life,\r\nbut the young and brilliant statesman was soon to enter the British\r\nCabinet. He was before long to demonstrate that he not only possessed\r\nthe arts of the fluent and vigorous Parliamentary debater, but the more\r\nsolid qualities pertaining to the practical statesman and financier. In\r\nfollowing his course we will be led to observe the early stages of his\r\nchanging opinions on great questions of State, and to trace the causes\r\nwhich led to his present advanced views as well as to his exalted\r\nposition. The estimation in which he was then held may be indicated by\r\nthe following, from one of his contemporaries, Sir Stafford Northcote,\r\nafterwards Lord Iddesleigh, and who subsequently succeeded him as\r\nleader of the House of Commons: \"There is but one statesman of the\r\npresent day in whom I feel entire confidence, and with whom I cordially\r\nagree, and that statesman is Mr. Gladstone. I look upon him as the\r\nrepresentative of the party, scarcely developed as yet, though secretly\r\nforming and strengthening, which will stand by all that is dear and\r\nsacred in my estimation, in the struggle which I believe will come ere\r\n_very_ long between good and evil, order and disorder, the Church and\r\nthe world, and I see a very small band collecting round him, and ready\r\nto fight manfully under his leading.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Mr. Gladstone crossed swords with the distinguished historian\r\nand Parliamentary debater, Lord Macaulay, in debate in the House of\r\nCommons on the relations of England with China. The speech of Mr.\r\nGladstone was remarkable for its eloquent expression of anxiety that the\r\narms of England should never be employed in unrighteous enterprises. Sir\r\nJames Graham moved a vote of censure of the ministry for \"want of\r\nforesight and precaution,\" and \"especially their neglect to furnish the\r\nsuperintendent at Canton with powers and instructions calculated to\r\nprovide against the growing evils connected with the contraband traffic\r\nin opium, and adapted to the novel and difficult situation in which the\r\nsuperintendent was placed.\" Mr. Gladstone, on the 8th of April, spoke\r\nstrongly in favor of the motion, and said if it failed to involve the\r\nministry in condemnation they would still be called upon to show cause\r\nfor their intention of making war upon China. Answering the speech of\r\nLord Macaulay of the previous evening, Mr. Gladstone said: \"The right\r\nhonorable gentleman opposite spoke last night in eloquent terms of the\r\nBritish flag waving in glory at Canton, and of the animating effects\r\nproduced on the minds of our sailors by the knowledge that in no country\r\nunder heaven was it permitted to be insulted. But how comes it to pass\r\nthat the sight of that flag always raises the spirit of Englishmen? It\r\nis because it has always been associated with the cause of justice, with\r\nopposition to oppression, with respect to national rights, with\r\nhonorable commercial enterprises; but now, under the auspices of the\r\nnoble lord, that flag is hoisted to protect an infamous contraband\r\ntraffic, and if it were never to be hoisted except as it is now hoisted\r\non the coast of China, we should recoil from its sight with horror, and\r\nshould never again feel our hearts thrill, as they now thrill with\r\nemotion, when it floats proudly and magnificently on the breeze.\" The\r\nministry escaped censure when the vote was taken by a bare majority.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1840 Mr. Gladstone, accompanied by Lord Lyttleton, went\r\nto Eton to examine candidates of the Newcastle Scholarship, founded by\r\nhis political friend, the Duke of Newcastle. Mr. Gladstone had the\r\npleasure in this examination of awarding the Newcastle medal to Henry\r\nFitzmaurice Hallam, the youngest brother of his own beloved friend and\r\nson of the historian Hallam. One of the scholars he examined writes: \"I\r\nhave a vivid and delightful impression of Mr. Gladstone sitting in what\r\nwas then called the library, on an _estrade_ on which the head master\r\nhabitually sate, above which was placed, about 1840, the bust of the\r\nDuke of Newcastle and the names of the Newcastle scholars.... When he\r\ngave me a Virgil and asked me to translate Georg. ii, 475, _seq_., I was\r\npleasantly surprised by the beautiful eye turning on me with the\r\nquestion, 'What is the meaning of _sacra fero_?' and his look of\r\napproval when I said, 'Carry the sacred vessels in the procession.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you to understand that Mr. Gladstone appeared not to me only,\r\nbut to others, as a gentleman wholly unlike other examiners or school\r\npeople. It was not as _a politician_ that we admired him, but as a\r\nrefined Churchman, deep also in political philosophy (so we conjectured\r\nfrom his quoting Burke on the Continual State retaining its identity\r\nthough made up of passing individuals), deep also in lofty poetry, as we\r\nguessed from his giving us, as a theme for original Latin verse, 'the\r\npoet's eye in a fine frenzy,' etc. When he spoke to us in 'Pop' as an\r\nhonorary member, we were charmed and affected emotionally: his voice was\r\nlow and sweet, his manner was that of an elder cousin: he seemed to\r\ntreat us with unaffected respect; and to be treated with respect by a\r\nman is the greatest delight for a boy. It was the golden time of\r\n'retrograding transcendentalism,' as the hard-heads called the\r\nAnglo-Catholic symphony. He seemed to me then an apostle of unworldly\r\nardor, bridling his life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whig administration, which for some time had been growing very\r\nunpopular, was defeated and went out of power in 1841. From the very\r\nbeginning of the session their overthrow was imminent. Among the causes\r\nwhich rendered the ministry obnoxious to the country, and led to their\r\ndownfall, may be named the disappointment of both their dissenting\r\nEnglish supporters and Irish allies; their financial policy had proved a\r\ncomplete failure and dissatisfied the nation; and the deficit in the\r\nrevenue this year amounted to no less a sum than two millions and a half\r\npounds. Every effort to remedy the financial difficulties offered by the\r\nministry to the House was rejected, Hence it was felt on all sides that\r\nthe government of the country must be committed to stronger hands.\r\nAccordingly, in May, Sir Robert Peel proposed a resolution in the House\r\nof Commons to the effect that the ministry did not possess sufficiently\r\nthe confidence of the House to carry through measures deemed essential\r\nfor the public welfare; and that their continuance in office was, under\r\nthe circumstances, at variance with the Constitution, For five days this\r\nresolution was discussed, but Mr. Gladstone took no part in the debate.\r\nThe motion of Sir Robert Peel passed by a majority vote of one, and on\r\nthe 7th of June Lord John Russell announced that the ministry would at\r\nonce dissolve Parliament and appeal to the country. Parliament was\r\nprorogued by the Queen in person June 22d, and the country was soon in\r\nthe turmoil of a general election. By the end of July it was found that\r\nthe ministry had been defeated and with greater loss than the Tories\r\neven had expected. The Tories had a great majority of the new members\r\nreturned. The Liberal seats gained by the Tories were seventy-eight,\r\nwhile the Tory seats gained by Liberals were only thirty-eight, thus\r\nmaking a Tory majority of eighty. Mr. Gladstone was again elected at\r\nNewark, and was at the head of the poll; with Lord John Manners,\r\nafterwards Duke of Rutland, as his colleague.\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament met in August, and the ministers were defeated, in\r\nboth Houses, on the Address and resigned. Sir Robert Peel was called\r\nupon by the Queen to form a new ministry, and Mr. Gladstone was\r\nincluded by his leader in the administration. In appearing on the\r\nhustings at Newark Mr. Gladstone said that there were two points upon\r\nwhich the British farmer might rely--the first being that adequate\r\nprotection would be given him, and, second, that protection would be\r\ngiven him through the means of the sliding scale. The duties were to be\r\nreduced and the system improved, but the principle was to be maintained.\r\n\"There was no English statesman who could foresee at this period the\r\nresults of that extraordinary agitation which, in the course of the next\r\nfive years, was destined to secure the abrogation of the Corn Laws.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that, having already conceived a lively interest in\r\nthe ecclesiastical and agrarian problems of Ireland, Mr. Gladstone had\r\nset his affections on the Chief Secretaryship. But Sir Robert Peel, a\r\nconsummate judge of administrative capacity, had discerned his young\r\nfriend's financial aptitude, and the member for Newark became\r\nvice-president of the Board of Trade and master of the Mint.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the midst of engrossing cares of office as vice-president of\r\nthe Board of Trade, yet Mr. Gladstone found time to renew his old\r\ninterest in ecclesiastical concerns. In the fall of 1841 an English\r\nEpiscopal Bishopric was established at Jerusalem, Mr. Gladstone dined\r\nwith Baron Bunsen on the birthday of the King of Prussia, when, as\r\nreported by Lord Shaftesbury, he \"stripped himself of a part of his\r\nPuseyite garments, spoke like a pious man, rejoiced in the bishopric of\r\nJerusalem, and proposed the health of Alexander, the new Bishop of that\r\nsee. This is delightful, for he is a good man, a clever man and an\r\nindustrious man.\" And Baron Bunsen, speaking of the same occasion, said,\r\n\"Never was heard a more exquisite speech, It flowed like a gentle,\r\ntranslucent stream. We drove back to town in the clearest starlight;\r\nGladstone continuing with unabated animation to pour forth his\r\nharmonious thoughts in melodious tone.\" And Mr. Gladstone himself writes\r\nlater; \"Amidst public business, quite sufficient for a man of my\r\ncompass, I have, during the whole of the week, perforce, been carrying\r\non with the Bishop of London and with Bunsen a correspondence on, and\r\ninquisition into, the Jerusalem design, until I almost reel and stagger\r\nunder it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd still later he writes: \"I am ready individually to brave\r\nmisconstruction for the sake of union with any Christian men, provided\r\nthe terms of the union be not contrary to sound principle; and perhaps\r\nin this respect might go further, at least in one of the possible\r\ndirections, than you. But to declare the living constitution of a\r\nChristian Church to be of secondary moment is of course in my view\r\nequivalent to a denial of a portion of the faith--and I think you will\r\nsay it is a construction which can not fairly be put upon the design,\r\nas far as it exists in fixed rules and articles. It is one thing to\r\nattribute this in the way of unfavorable surmise, or as an apprehension\r\nof ultimate developments--it is another to publish it to the world as a\r\ncharacter ostentatiously assumed.\"\r\n\r\nWe have evidence also that at this time he was not permitted to forget\r\nthat he was an author, for he thus writes, April 6, 1842, to his\r\npublisher: \"Amidst the pressure of more urgent affairs, I have held no\r\nconsultation with you regarding my books and the sale or no sale of\r\nthem. As to the third edition of the 'State in its Relations,' I should\r\nthink that the remaining copies had better be got rid of in whatever\r\nsummary or ignominious mode you may deem best. They must be dead beyond\r\nrecall. As to the others, I do not know whether the season of the year\r\nhas at all revived the demand; and would suggest to you whether it would\r\nbe well to advertise them a little. I do not think they find their way\r\nmuch into the second-hand shops. With regard to the fourth edition, I do\r\nnot know whether it would be well to procure any review or notice of it,\r\nand I am not a fair judge of its merits, even in comparison with the\r\noriginal form of the work; but my idea is that it is less defective,\r\nboth in the theoretical and in the historical development, and ought to\r\nbe worth the notice of those who deemed the earlier editions worth\r\ntheir notice and purchase; that it would really put a reader in\r\npossession of the view it was intended to convey, which I fear is more\r\nthan can with any truth be said of its predecessors. I am not, however,\r\nin any state of anxiety or impatience; and I am chiefly moved to refer\r\nthese suggestions to your judgment from perceiving that the fourth\r\nedition is as yet far from having cleared itself.\"\r\n\r\nIt was from this time that a marked change was observable in the\r\nsubjects of Mr. Gladstone's Parliamentary addresses. \"Instead of\r\nspeaking on the corporate conscience of the State and the endowments of\r\nthe Church, the importance of Christian education and the theological\r\nunfitness of the Jews to sit in Parliament, he was solving business-like\r\nproblems about foreign tariffs and the exportation of machinery; waxing\r\neloquent over the regulation of railways and a graduated tax on corn;\r\nsubtle on the momentary merits of half-farthings and great in the\r\nmysterious lore of quassia and cocculus indicus.\"\r\n\r\nIn the short session of Parliament, in 1841, that which followed the\r\naccession of Sir Robert Peel to the office of Prime Minister, he was\r\nquestioned by his opponents as to his future policy. The Premier\r\ndeclined to state the nature of the measures he intended to present, or\r\nwhich he contemplated making, in the intervening months of the recess\r\nof Parliament so near at hand. He wanted time for the arrangement of his\r\nplans and the construction of his political programme. An effort was\r\nmade to embarrass the administration by refusing to vote the necessary\r\nsupplies, until inquiry should be made into the existing distress, but\r\nit was defeated. Three weeks later Parliament was dissolved by Royal\r\ncommission. In the following sitting of Parliament several measures of\r\nhigh practical character were presented.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel acceded to office in very critical times. The condition\r\nof the country was truly lamentable. Distress and discontent were\r\nwidespread and the difficulties of the government were greatly enhanced\r\nby popular tumults. The Free Trade agitation was already making great\r\nheadway in the land, and when the Premier brought forward his new\r\nsliding scale of duties in the House of Commons it was denounced by Mr.\r\nCobden as an insult to a suffering people. The Premier said that he\r\nconsidered the present not an unfavorable time for discussing the corn\r\nlaws; that there was no great stock on hand of foreign growth to alarm\r\nthe farmers; that the recess had been marked by universal calm; that\r\nthere was no popular violence to interrupt legislation; and that there\r\nwas a disposition to view any proposal for the adjustment of the\r\nquestion with calmness and moderation.\r\n\r\nThe Premier's view of the situation did not seem to be wholly in accord\r\nwith the well-known facts, for the Queen even, on her appearance at the\r\nLondon theatres, had been hooted, and the Prime Minister himself was\r\nburnt in effigy during a riot at Northampton; great excitement prevailed\r\nthroughout the country, and Lord John Russell moved as an amendment\r\n\"That this House, considering the evils which have been caused by the\r\npresent corn laws and especially by the fluctuation of the graduated or\r\nsliding scale, is not prepared to adopt the measure of her Majesty's\r\ngovernment, which is founded on the same principles and is likely to be\r\nattended by similar results.\"\r\n\r\nIt was incumbent upon Mr. Gladstone to lead the opposition to this\r\nmotion. He showed that the proposed plan was not founded on the same\r\nprinciple of the existing one, except that both involved a sliding\r\nscale; that the present distress was caused by fluctuation of the\r\nseasons and not by the laws; that high prices of food were chargeable to\r\nsuccessive failures of the crops; that these unavoidable fluctuations\r\nwere not aggravated by the corn laws; that Sir Robert Peel's plan of\r\nworking was far superior to that of Lord John Russell; that the drains\r\nupon the currency, caused by bad harvests, were not to be prevented by a\r\nfixed duty; that a uniform protection could not be given to corn, as to\r\nother articles, because at high prices of corn no duty could be\r\nmaintained, and that, therefore, at low prices, it was but just to give\r\na duty which would be an effectual protection. The debate which followed\r\nwas characterized by vigorous speeches from Mr. Roebuck and Lord\r\nPalmerston. Lord John Russell's amendment was lost by a large majority.\r\nA motion presented by Mr. Villiers, the Free Trade advocate, for the\r\nimmediate repeal of the corn laws was also lost by a majority of over\r\nthree hundred.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of March Sir Robert Peel introduced his budget. The budget\r\nfor 1842 was produced under depressing circumstances. There was a\r\ndeficit of £2,750,000, or about $15,000,000, and taxation upon articles\r\nof consumption had been pushed to its utmost limit. Peel was a great\r\nfinancier, but the fiscal difficulties by which he was now surrounded\r\nwere enough to appall the most ingenious of financial ministers.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone rendered the Premier invaluable service in the preparation\r\nboth of his budget and of his tariff scheme. The merit of the budget was\r\nits taxation of wealth and the relief of the manufacturing industry. The\r\nsecond branch of the financial plan, the revised tariff--a customs\r\nduties scheme--was very important, and it was understood to be mainly\r\nthe work of Mr. Gladstone. Out of nearly 1200 duty-paying articles, a\r\ntotal abolition, or a considerable reduction, was made in no fewer than\r\n750. This was certainly a great step towards the freedom of\r\nmanufacturers, Sir Robert Peel's boast that he had endeavored to relieve\r\nmanufacturing industries was more than justified by this great and\r\ncomprehensive measure. The very best means for relieving the\r\nmanufacturing industries had been devised.\r\n\r\nBut while this great relief to industry was welcomed the Opposition did\r\nnot relax their efforts for the abolition of the corn laws, which were\r\ncontinued into the session of 1843. Sir Robert Peel acknowledged, amidst\r\nloud cheers from the Opposition, that all were agreed in the general\r\nrule that we should purchase in the cheapest market and sell in the\r\ndearest; but he added, \"If I propose a greater change in the corn laws\r\nthan that which I submit to the consideration of the House I should only\r\naggravate the distress of the country, and only increase the alarm which\r\nprevails among important interests.\" Mr. Hume hailed with joy the\r\nappearance of the Premier and his colleagues as converts to the\r\nprinciples of Free Trade; Mr. Gladstone replied, that, whoever were the\r\nauthors of the principles on which the government measures rested, he\r\nmust protest against the statement that the ministry came forward as\r\nconverts to principles which they had formerly opposed.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the debate of 1842, on the revised Tariff Bill,\r\nMr. Gladstone's labors were very great. He was called upon to explain or\r\ndefend the details of the scheme, and had something to say about every\r\narticle of consumption included in, or excluded from, the list. He spoke\r\none hundred and twenty-nine times, chiefly on themes connected with the\r\nnew fiscal legislature. He demonstrated his capacity for grasping all\r\nthe most complicated details of finance, and also the power of\r\ncomprehending the scope and necessities of the commercial interests of\r\nthe country. No measure with which his name has since been connected has\r\ndone him more credit. He spoke incessantly, and amazed the House by his\r\nmastery of details, his intimate acquaintance with the commercial needs\r\nof the country, and his inexhaustible power of exposition. On March 14th\r\nGreville wrote, \"Gladstone has already displayed a capacity which makes\r\nhis admission into the Cabinet indispensable.\" A commercial minister had\r\nappeared on the scene, and the shade of Hoskisson had revived.\r\n\r\nThough engrossed in schemes of practical legislation, and in all the\r\nexcitements and interests of office, he could, as he has ever done\r\nduring his long career, turn aside for the discourse on social and\r\neducational questions with much earnestness and eloquence, as if they,\r\nand only they, possessed his mind. In January, 1843, he spoke at the\r\nopening of the Collegiate Institute of Liverpool, and delivered a\r\npowerful plea for the better education of the middle classes, which was\r\none of the most forcible speeches he ever delivered. He said:\r\n\r\n\"We believe that if you could erect a system which should present to\r\nmankind all branches of knowledge save the one that is essential, you\r\nwould only be building up a Tower of Babel, which, when you had\r\ncompleted it, would be the more signal in its fall, and which would bury\r\nthose who had raised it in its ruins. We believe that if you can take a\r\nhuman being in his youth, and if you can make him an accomplished man in\r\nnatural philosophy, in mathematics, or in the knowledge necessary for\r\nthe profession of a merchant, a lawyer, or a physician; that if in any\r\nor all of these endowments you could form his mind--yes, if you could\r\nendow him with the science and power of a Newton, and so send him\r\nforth--and if you had concealed from him, or, rather, had not given him\r\na knowledge and love of the Christian faith--he would go forth into the\r\nworld, able indeed with reference to those purposes of science,\r\nsuccessful with the accumulation of wealth for the multiplication of\r\nmore, but 'poor, and miserable, and blind, and naked' with reference to\r\neverything that constitutes the true and sovereign purposes of our\r\nexistence--nay, worse, worse--with respect to the sovereign purpose--\r\nthan if he had still remained in the ignorance which we all commiserate,\r\nand which it is the object of this institution to assist in removing.\"\r\n\r\nIt was admitted on all hands that great fiscal reforms had been\r\nconceived and executed; and speaking of the session of 1842, a writer,\r\nnot favorable to the Tories, wrote: \"The nation saw and felt that its\r\nbusiness was understood and accomplished, and the House of Commons was\r\nno longer like a sleeper under a nightmare. The long session was a busy\r\none. The Queen wore a cheerful air when she thanked Parliament for their\r\neffectual labors. The Opposition was such as could no longer impede the\r\noperations of the next session. The condition of the country was fearful\r\nenough, but something was done for its future improvement, and the way\r\nwas now shown to be open for further beneficent legislation.\"\r\n\r\nThe corn law reformers renewed their efforts, led by Lord Howick, as\r\nsoon as the parliamentary session of 1843 opened. An inquiry by the\r\nwhole House was demanded into the causes of the long continued\r\nmanufacturing depression referred to in the Queen's speech. Mr.\r\nGladstone replied that while the Opposition proposed to repeal the corn\r\nlaws, they offered no measure of relief in their place. The corn laws\r\nwere at the root of the distress in the country, but the difficulty was\r\nto unite the ranks of the Opposition in opinion as to what ought to\r\nfollow the repeal of the corn laws. The question between the government\r\nand the Opposition was not really so great as the latter wished to make\r\nout. It was simply as to the amount of relaxation the country could bear\r\nin the duties. It was the intention of the First Lord of the Treasury to\r\nattain his object \"by increasing the employment of the people, by\r\ncheapening the prices of the articles of consumption, as also the\r\narticles of industry, by encouraging the means of exchange with foreign\r\nnations, and thereby encouraging in return an extension of the export\r\ntrade; but besides all this, if he understood the measure of the\r\ngovernment last year, it was proposed that the relaxation should be\r\npractically so limited as to cause no violent shock to existing\r\ninterests, such as would have the tendency of displacing that labor\r\nwhich should be employed, and which, if displaced, would be unable to\r\nfind another field.\" The measure of the previous year had nothing but a\r\nbeneficial effect, but the repeal of the corn laws would displace a vast\r\nmass of labor. Lord Howick's motion was defeated and so were others\r\noffered by Mr. Villiers and Lord John Russell, by diminishing\r\nmajorities, and Mr. Gladstone protested against the constant renewal of\r\nuneasiness in the country by successive motions of this kind in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe year 1843 was one destined to witness a great advance in Mr.\r\nGladstone's progress towards the front rank among statesmen. June 10th,\r\nLord Ripon, who was President of the Board of Trade, left this place for\r\nthe Board of Control, and Mr. Gladstone was appointed to the position,\r\nand thus became a member of the Cabinet at the age of thirty-three Mr.\r\nGladstone now became in name what he had been already in fact--the\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade. He states that \"the very first opinion\r\nwhich he was ever called upon to give in Cabinet\" was an opinion in\r\nfavor of withdrawing the bill providing education for children in\r\nfactories; to which vehement opposition was offered by the Dissenters,\r\non the ground that it was too favorable to the Established Church. It\r\nseemed that his position was assured and yet in October he wrote to a\r\nfriend: \"Uneasy, in my opinion, must be the position of every member of\r\nParliament who thinks independently in these times, or in any that are\r\nlikely to succeed them; and in proportion as a man's course of thought\r\ndeviates from the ordinary lines his seat must less and less resemble a\r\nbed of roses.\" Mr. Gladstone possibly felt when he penned these lines\r\nthat the time was at hand when his convictions would force him to take a\r\nposition that would array against him some of his most ardent friends.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1844 Mr. Gladstone addressed the House on a\r\nvariety of subjects, including rail ways, the law of partnership, the\r\nagricultural interest, the abolition of the corn laws, the Dissenters'\r\nChapel Bill and the sugar duties. One very valuable bill he had carried\r\nwas a measure for the abolition of restrictions on the exportation of\r\nmachinery. Another was the railway bill, to improve the railway system,\r\nby which the Board of Trade had conditional power to purchase railways\r\nwhich had not adopted a revised scale of tolls. The bill also\r\ncompulsorily provided for at least one third-class train per week-day\r\nupon every line of railway, to charge but one penny a mile, regulated\r\nthe speed of traveling, compelled such trains to stop at every station,\r\nand arranged for the carrying of children under three years of age for\r\nnothing and those under twelve at reduced fares. This measure, conceived\r\nso distinctly in the interests of the poorer classes, met with\r\nconsiderable opposition at first from the various railway companies, but\r\nit was ultimately passed into law. These were measures passed in the\r\nspirit of reform, though by a Conservative government.\r\n\r\nThere was another matter legislated upon which shows how Mr. Gladstone's\r\nmind was undergoing changes in the direction of religious toleration.\r\nLady Hewley had originally founded and given to Calvinistic Independents\r\ncertain charities which had gradually passed to Unitarians, who were\r\nousted from their benefits. A bill was proposed to vest property left to\r\nDissenting bodies in the hands of that religions body with whom it had\r\nremained for the preceding twenty years. The measure was passed, but\r\nwhen it was discussed in the House of Commons Mr. Gladstone said that it\r\nwas a bill which it was incumbent upon the House to endorse; that there\r\nwas no contrariety between his principles of religious belief and those\r\non which legislation in this case ought to proceed; that there was a\r\ngreat question of justice, viz., whether those who were called\r\nPresbyterian Dissenters, and who were a century and a half ago of\r\nTrinitarian opinions, ought not to be protected at the present moment in\r\npossession of the chapels which they held, with the appurtenances of\r\nthose chapels? On the question of substantial justice he pronounced the\r\nstrongest affirmative opinion. \"After this speech there were those who\r\nthought, and expressed their hope and belief in words, that the\r\n'champion of Free Trade' would ere long become the advocate of the most\r\nunrestricted liberty in matters of religion. Their hope, if sanguine as\r\nto its immediate fulfillment, was far from groundless.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, in December of the same year Mr. Gladstone wrote to his friend\r\nArchdeacon, afterwards Bishop Wilberforce, about the prospects of the\r\nChurch of England: \"I rejoice to see that your views on the whole are\r\nhopeful. For my part I heartily go along with you. The fabric\r\nconsolidates itself more and more, even while the earthquake rocks it;\r\nfor, with a thousand drawbacks and deductions, love grows larger, zeal\r\nwarmer, truth firmer among us. It makes the mind sad to speculate upon\r\nthe question how much better all might have been; but our mourning\r\nshould be turned into joy and thankfulness when we think also how much\r\nworse it _was_.\"\r\n\r\nThe next event in the life of Mr. Gladstone is marked by a momentous\r\nchange in his political position. Scarcely had Parliament met in\r\nJanuary, 1845, when it was announced to the astonishment of everyone\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone had resigned his place as President of the Board of\r\nTrade in the Cabinet. He set a good deal of speculation at rest by the\r\nannouncement made in his speech on the address of the Queen, that his\r\nresignation was due solely to the government intentions with regard to\r\nMaynooth College. Before, however, he had resigned, Mr. Gladstone had\r\ncompleted a second and revised tariff, carrying further the principles\r\nof the revision of 1842.\r\n\r\nIn the session of 1844 Sir Robert Peel, in response to the requests of\r\nIrish members, had promised that the Government would take up the\r\nquestion of academical education in Ireland, with the view of bringing\r\nit more nearly to the standard of England and Scotland, increasing its\r\namount and improving its quality. In fulfillment of this pledge the\r\ngovernment, at the beginning of the session of 1845, proposed to\r\nestablish non-sectarian colleges in Ireland, and to increase the\r\nappropriation to Maynooth. The College of Maynooth, which was\r\nestablished for the education of Roman Catholic priests and laymen, had\r\nfallen into poverty and decay. In order to gratify the Irish, the\r\ngovernment offered to increase the grant already made from $45,000 to\r\n$150,000 a year. This appropriation was not to be subject to any annual\r\nvote, and the affairs of the College were to be executed by the Board of\r\nWorks. These proposals placed Mr. Gladstone in a position of great\r\ndifficulty. He must either support Sir Robert Peel's measure, or retire\r\nfrom the Cabinet into isolation, if not subject to the imputation of\r\neccentricity. He took council with his friends, Archdeacon Manning and\r\nMr. Hope, who advised him to remain, and with Lord Stanley who warned\r\nhim that his resignation must be followed by resistance of the proposals\r\nof the government, which would involve him in a storm of religious\r\nagitation. But Mr. Gladstone persisted in his intention, in what seemed\r\nlike giving up his brilliant prospects, but said it would not\r\nnecessarily be followed by resistance to the proposal about Maynooth.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone said that the proposed increase in the Maynooth endowment\r\nand the establishment of non-sectarian colleges were at variance with\r\nviews he had written and uttered upon the relations of the Church and\r\nState. \"I am sensible how fallible my judgment is,\" said Mr. Gladstone,\r\n\"and how easily I might have erred; but still it has been my conviction\r\nthat although I was not to fetter my judgment as a member of Parliament\r\nby a reference to abstract theories, yet, on the other hand, it was\r\nabsolutely due to the public and due to myself that I should, so far as\r\nin me lay, place myself in a position to form an opinion upon a matter\r\nof so great importance, that should not only be actually free from all\r\nbias or leaning with respect to any consideration whatsoever, but an\r\nopinion that should be unsuspected. On that account I have taken a\r\ncourse most painful to myself in respect to personal feelings, and have\r\nseparated myself from men with whom and under whom I have long acted in\r\npublic life, and of whom I am bound to say, although I have now no\r\nlonger the honor of serving my most gracious Sovereign, that I continue\r\nto regard them with unaltered sentiments both of public regard and\r\nprivate attachment.\"\r\n\r\nThen again he said: \"My whole purpose was to place myself in a position\r\nin which I should be free to consider any course without being liable\r\nto any just suspicion on the ground of personal interest. It is not\r\nprofane if I now say, '_with a great price obtained I this freedom_.'\r\nThe political association in which I stood was to me at the time the\r\n_alpha_ and _omega_ of public life. The government of Sir Robert Peel\r\nwas believed to be of immovable strength. My place, as President of the\r\nBoard of Trade, was at the very kernel of its most interesting\r\noperations; for it was in progress from year to year, with continually\r\nwaxing courage, towards the emancipation of industry, and therein\r\ntowards the accomplishment of another great and blessed work of public\r\njustice. Giving up what I highly prized, aware that\r\n\r\n                            male sarta\r\n     Gratia nequicquam coit, et rescinditur.\r\n\r\nI felt myself open to the charge of being opinionated and wanting in\r\ndeference to really great authorities, and I could not but know that I\r\nshould inevitably be regarded as fastidious and fanciful, fitter for a\r\ndreamer, or possibly a schoolman, than for the active purposes of public\r\nlife in a busy and moving age.\"\r\n\r\nThere were some of his party angry and others who thought that there was\r\nsomething almost Quixotic in Mr. Gladstone's honorable resignation,\r\nbecause so soon as he felt himself free he gave his support to the\r\nMaynooth Bill and also to the scheme for the extension of academical\r\neducation in Ireland, which latter was described by Sir R. Inglis as a\r\n\"gigantic scheme of godless education.\" In Greville's \"Memoirs\" we find:\r\n\"Gladstone's explanation is ludicrous. Everybody said that he had only\r\nsucceeded in showing that his resignation was unnecessary. He was\r\ncriticised as the possessor of a kind of supernatural virtue that could\r\nscarcely be popular with the slaves of party, and he was considered\r\nwhimsical, fantastic, impracticable, a man whose 'conscience was so\r\ntender that he could not go straight,' a visionary not to be relied\r\non--in fact, a character and intellect useless to the political\r\nmanager.\" \"I am greatly alarmed at Gladstone's resignation. I fear it\r\nforetells measures opposed to the Church truth,\" wrote Wilberforce; and\r\nPeel told Gladstone beforehand that his reasons for his resignation\r\nwould be considered insufficient. But Mr. Gladstone's resignation, when\r\nunderstood, elicited the liveliest expressions of regret from friend and\r\nfoe, as well as the most flattering testimonies as to his ability and\r\ncharacter. His chief, Sir Robert Peel, and Lord John Russell, the leader\r\nof the Opposition, were alike complimentary in their remarks.\r\n\r\nDr. Russell, the biographer of Mr. Gladstone, says: \"Mr. Gladstone's\r\nretirement, by impairing his reputation for common sense, threatened\r\nserious and lasting injury to his political career, But the whirligig\r\nof time brought its revenges even more swiftly than usual. A conjunction\r\nof events arose in which he was destined to repair the mischief which\r\nthe speculative side had wrought; but for the moment the speculative\r\nside was uppermost.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was fast leaving his Toryism behind. To show how far his\r\nviews had changed in the course of seven years, it may be said that in\r\nhis speech on these measures he observed how that exclusive support to\r\nthe Established Church was a doctrine that was being more and more\r\nabandoned. Mr. Burke considered it contrary to wise policy to give\r\nexclusive privileges to a negative creed like that of Protestantism.\r\nThey could not prove their religious scruples for denying this grant to\r\nRoman Catholics, because they gave their votes of money to almost every\r\nDissenting seat. He hoped the concession now made--which was a great and\r\nliberal gift, because unrestricted and given in a spirit of\r\nconfidence--would not lead to the renewal of agitation in Ireland by Mr.\r\nO'Connell. It might be well for him to reflect that agitation was a\r\ntwo-edged sword. Being conformable to justice and not contrary to\r\nprinciple, he hoped the measure proposed would pass into a law.\r\n\r\nW.T. Stead, in a recent article, said, in relation to Mr. Gladstone's\r\nretirement from the Cabinet, that \"It is ridiculous to pretend, with\r\nMr. Gladstone's career before us, that his course has been swayed by\r\ncalculating self-interest. He has been the very madman of politics from\r\nthe point of view of Mr. Worldly Wiseman. 'No man,' said he, the other\r\nday, 'has ever committed suicide so often as I,' and that witness is\r\ntrue. The first and perhaps the most typical of all his many suicides\r\nwas his resignation of his seat in Sir Robert Peel's Cabinet, not\r\nbecause he disapproved of the Maynooth Grant, but because, as he had at\r\none time written against it, he was determined that his advocacy of it\r\nshould be purged of the last taint of self-interest. As Mr. George\r\nRussell rightly remarks, 'This was an act of Parliamentary Quixotism too\r\neccentric to be intelligible. It argued a fastidious sensitiveness of\r\nconscience, and a nice sense of political propriety so opposed to the\r\nsordid selfishness and unblushing tergiversation of the ordinary\r\nplace-hunter as to be almost offensive.' But as Mr. Gladstone was then,\r\nso he has been all his life--the very Quixote of conscience. Judged by\r\nevery standard of human probability, he has ruined himself over and over\r\nand over again. He is always ruining himself, and always rising, like\r\nthe Phoenix, in renewed youth from the ashes of his funeral pyre. As was\r\nsaid in homely phrase some years ago, he 'always keeps bobbing up\r\nagain.' What is the secret of this wonderful capacity of revival? How\r\nis it that Mr. Gladstone seems to find even his blunders help him, and\r\nthe affirmation of principles that seem to be destructive to all chance\r\nof the success of his policy absolutely helps him to its realization?\"\r\n\r\nFrom a merely human standpoint it is inexplicable. But\r\n\r\n     'If right or wrong in this God's world of ours\r\n      Be leagued with higher powers,'\r\n\r\nthen the mystery is not so insolvable. He believed in the higher powers.\r\nHe never shrank from putting his faith to the test; and on the whole,\r\nwho can deny that for his country and for himself he has reason to\r\nrejoice in the verification of his working hypothesis?\r\n\r\n'We walk by faith and not by sight,' he said once; 'and by no one so\r\nmuch as by those who are in politics is this necessary.' It is the\r\nevidence of things not seen, the eternal principles, the great invisible\r\nmoral sanctions that men are wont to call the laws of God, which alone\r\nsupply a safe guide through this mortal wilderness.\r\n\r\n     'Men of a thousand shifts and wiles, look here!\r\n        See one straightforward conscience put in pawn\r\n      To win a world; see the obedient sphere\r\n        By bravery's simple gravitation drawn!\r\n      Shall we not heed the lesson taught of old,\r\n        And by the Present's lips repeated still?\r\n      In our own single manhood to be bold,\r\n        Fortressed in conscience and impregnable.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone has never hesitated to counter at sharp right angles the\r\npassion and the fury of the day. Those who represent him as ever strong\r\nupon the strong side, wilfully shut their eyes to half his history. He\r\nchallenged Lord Palmerston over the Don Pacifico question, and was\r\nbelieved to have wrecked himself almost as completely as when in 1876 he\r\ncountered even more resolutely the fantastic Jingoism of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield. It is easy for those who come after and enter into the\r\nspoils gained by sacrifices of which they themselves were incapable to\r\ndescribe the Bulgarian agitation as an astute party move. The party did\r\nnot think so. Its leaders did not think so. Some of those who now halloo\r\nloud enough behind Mr. Gladstone were then bitter enough in their\r\ncomplaint that he had wrecked his party. One at least, who was\r\nconstrained to say the other thing in public, made up for it by bitter\r\nand contemptuous cavilings in private. Now it is easy to see that Lord\r\nBeaconsfield was mistaken and that Mr. Gladstone held the winning card\r\nall along. But no one knew it at the time when the card had to be\r\nplayed, certainly not Mr. Gladstone himself. He simply saw his duty a\r\ndead sure thing, and, like Jim Bludsoe on the burning boat, 'He went for\r\nit there and then.' It turned up trumps, but no one knew how heavy were\r\nthe odds against it save those who went through the stress and the\r\nstrain of that testing and trying time by his side.\"\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1845 Mr. Gladstone proposed to his intimate friend, Mr.\r\nJ.R. Hope, that they should spend the month of September in a working\r\ntour in Ireland, giving evidence of his characteristic desire always to\r\ncome in personal contact with any question that he had to discuss. He\r\nsuggests \"their eschewing all grandeur, and taking little account even\r\nof scenery, compared with the purpose of looking, from close quarters,\r\nat the institutions for religion and education of the country, and at\r\nthe character of the people. It seems ridiculous to talk of supplying\r\nthe defects of second-hand information by so short a trip; but although\r\na longer time would be much better, yet even a very contracted one does\r\nmuch when it is added to an habitual, though indirect, knowledge.\" The\r\nprojected trip, however, had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year 1845 Mr. Gladstone issued a pamphlet\r\nentitled \"Remarks upon recent Commercial Legislation,\" in which he not\r\nonly discussed the salutary effects of the late commercial policy, but\r\nused arguments clearly showing that he was advancing to the position of\r\na free-trader. His general conclusion was that English statesmen should\r\nuse every effort to disburden of all charges, so far as the law was\r\nconcerned, the materials of industry, and thus enable the workman to\r\napproach his work at home on better terms, as the terms in which he\r\nentered foreign markets were altered for the worse against him.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Gladstone was so willing to deal generously more than ever\r\nbefore with the Irish Roman Catholics, his confidence in the Established\r\nEpiscopal Church of Ireland was growing less. \"I am sorry,\" he wrote to\r\nBishop Wilberforce, \"to express my apprehension that the Irish Church is\r\nnot in a large sense efficient; the working results of the last ten\r\nyears have disappointed me. I may be answered, Have faith in the\r\nordinance of God; but then I must see the seal and signature, and these,\r\nhow can I separate from ecclesiastical descent? The title, in short, is\r\nquestioned, and vehemently, not only by the Radicalism of the day, but\r\nby the Roman Bishops, who claim to hold succession of St. Patrick, and\r\nthis claim has been alive all along from the Reformation, so that lapse\r\nof years does nothing against it.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Dr. Döllinger, the distinguished reformed Roman Catholic,\r\nhas been mentioned already in connection with that of Mr. Gladstone. In\r\nthe fall of 1845 Mr. Gladstone went to Munich and paid his first visit\r\nto Dr. Döllinger. For a week he remained in daily intercourse with this\r\neminent divine, and the foundation was laid of a friendship which was\r\nsustained by repeated visits and correspondence, and which lasted until\r\nthe doctor's death in 1890.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1845 Mr. Gladstone met with a painful accident that\r\nresulted in a permanent injury to his hand. He was by no means what is\r\ntermed a sportsman, yet he was somewhat fond of shooting. His gun was\r\nprematurely discharged while he was loading it, and shattered the first\r\nfinger of his left hand, so that amputation was necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loyal Ulster]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMBER FOR OXFORD\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone's career,\" says his biographer, G.W.E. Russell,\r\n\"naturally divides itself into three parts. The first of them ends with\r\nhis retirement from the representation of Newark. The central part\r\nranges from 1847 to 1868. Happily the third is still incomplete.\" The\r\nfirst division, according to Dr. Russell, of this remarkable life, we\r\nhave considered, and we now pass on to the development of the second\r\nperiod. The causes which led up to Mr. Gladstone's retirement from the\r\nrepresentation for Newark to that of Oxford we will now proceed\r\nto trace.\r\n\r\nThe agitation by the ablest orators against the corn laws had been going\r\non for ten years, when an announcement was made in the \"Times\" of\r\nDecember 4, 1845, that Parliament would be convened the first week in\r\nJanuary, and that the Queen's address would recommend the immediate\r\nconsideration of the corn laws, preparatory to their total abolition.\r\nThis startling news took the other daily papers by surprise, for there\r\nhad been recently a lull in the agitation, and several of them\r\ncontradicted it positively. Yet the newspapers had noticed the unusual\r\noccurrence of four cabinet meetings in one week. The original statement\r\nwas confirmed. The ministry was pledged to support the measure. The hour\r\nhad come, the doom of the corn laws was sealed. Mr. Gladstone's thoughts\r\nand labors for some years past had been leading him away from\r\nProtection, in which he had been brought up, in the direction of Free\r\nTrade; and although he was unable to participate in the last part of the\r\nstruggle in Parliament, because he was not a member of the House, he was\r\nyet in harmony with Sir Robert Peel, and indeed is said to have\r\nconverted the Premier to Free Trade views. Such a change of views was\r\nnot the sudden impulse of an hour. The next step was to announce his\r\nchanged convictions. And so upon other occasions in his life, his\r\nattitude on the question of the corn laws led to his separation from\r\nsome old and greatly cherished political and personal friends, and among\r\nthe first to disapprove of his new departure must have been his own\r\nfather, who would think his son was going to ruin the country.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buccleuch and Lord Stanley informed Sir Robert Peel that\r\nthey could not support a measure for the repeal of the corn laws, and\r\nSir Robert Peel, being doubtful whether he could carry through the\r\nproposed measure in the face of such opposition, tendered his\r\nresignation as premier to the Queen. Lord John Russell was called upon\r\nto form a new ministry, but, having failed in this, the Queen desired\r\nSir Robert Peel to withdraw his resignation, and resume the head of the\r\ngovernment again.\r\n\r\nIt was found when the list of the new Peel Cabinet was published, that\r\nMr. Gladstone was a member of it; having accepted the office of Colonial\r\nSecretary, in the place of Lord Stanley, who had resigned because not in\r\nsympathy with the proposed movement and of repeal. Accepting office in a\r\nministry pledged to repeal the corn laws led to the retirement of Mr.\r\nGladstone from the House of Commons as the representative for Newark.\r\nThe Duke of New Castle, the patron and friend of Mr. Gladstone, was an\r\nardent Protectionist, and could not sanction the candidature of a\r\nsupporter of Free Trade principles. His patronage was therefore\r\nnecessarily withdrawn from Mr. Gladstone. Indeed, the Duke had turned\r\nhis own son, Lord Lincoln, out of the representation of Nottinghamshire\r\nfor accepting office under Sir Robert Peel, and he naturally showed no\r\nmercy to the brilliant but wayward politician, whom his favor had made\r\nmember for Newark. Besides, Mr. Gladstone felt he held opposite\r\nprinciples from those he held when elected, and that unless the\r\nconstituency had changed with him, he could no longer honorably continue\r\nto represent them, even if the influence and friendship of the Duke\r\npermitted it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he did not offer himself for re-election, but retired and\r\nissued an address to the electors of Newark, dated January 5, 1846, of\r\nwhich the following is an extract: \"By accepting the office of Secretary\r\nof State for the Colonies, I have ceased to be your representative in\r\nParliament. On several accounts I should have been peculiarly desirous\r\nat the present time of giving you an opportunity to pronounce your\r\nconstitutional judgment on my public conduct, by soliciting at your\r\nhands a renewal of the trust which I have already received from you on\r\nfive successive occasions, and held during a period of thirteen years.\r\nBut as I have good reason to believe that a candidate recommended to\r\nyour favor through local connections may ask your suffrages, it becomes\r\nmy very painful duty to announce to you on that ground alone my\r\nretirement from a position which has afforded me so much of honor and of\r\nsatisfaction.\" Mr. Gladstone further goes on to explain that he accepted\r\noffice because he held that \"it was for those who believed the\r\nGovernment was acting according to the demands of public duty to testify\r\nthat belief, however limited their sphere might be, by their\r\nco-operation.\" He had acted \"in obedience to the clear and imperious\r\ncall of public obligation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that Mr. Gladstone became a voluntary exile from the\r\nHouse of Commons during this important season, and took no part in the\r\ndebates, his personal powerful advocacy being lost in the consideration\r\nof the great measure before the House. He was a member of the Cabinet,\r\nbut not of the House of Commons. It was no secret, however, that he was\r\nthe most advanced Free Trader in the Peel Cabinet, and that the policy\r\nof the government in regard to this great measure of 1846 was to a large\r\nextent moulded by him.\r\n\r\nIt is also known that his representations of the effects of Free Trade\r\non the industry of the country and the general well-being of the people\r\nstrengthened the Premier in his resolve to sweep away the obnoxious corn\r\nlaws. His pamphlet on recent commercial legislation had prepared the way\r\nfor the later momentous changes; and to Mr. Gladstone is due much of the\r\ncredit for the speedy consummation of the Free Trade policy of the Peel\r\nMinistry. Mr. Gladstone may be regarded as the pioneer of the movement.\r\n\r\nJust at this time a calamity occurred in Ireland which furnished Sir\r\nRobert Peel an additional argument for the prompt repeal of the corn\r\nlaws; namely, a prospective famine, owing to the failure of the potato\r\ncrop. With threatened famine in Ireland, such as had never been\r\nexperienced, the Prime Minister saw clearly that corn must be admitted\r\ninto the country free of duty. The Anti-Corn Law League was growing\r\npowerful and even irresistible, while both in England and Ireland many\r\nlandlords of influence, who did not belong to the League, were in\r\nsympathy with the movement started by the Premier and ready to extend to\r\nhim a hearty support.\r\n\r\nBut the friends of Protection did not leave the Premier without\r\nopposition. Knowing that Sir Robert Peel's personal influence was\r\ngreater than that of any minister who had \"virtually governed the\r\nempire,\" they used every means at their command, fair and unfair, to\r\ndefeat the bill. However, their efforts were destined to failure. Some\r\ncontended that the presentation and passage of the corn law repeal bill\r\nought to be left to the Liberals. But Free Trade had not received the\r\nsupport of every member of the Liberal party, and Sir Robert Peel was in\r\na position to carry out the measure, and it was not in accordance with\r\nthe wisdom of practical politics to halt. Indeed, at this very juncture,\r\nMr. Cobden wrote to the Premier that he had the power, and that it would\r\nbe disastrous to the country for him to hesitate. Writing from\r\nEdinburgh, Lord John Russell announced his conversion to total and\r\nimmediate repeal of the corn laws. Sir Robert Peel hesitated no longer,\r\nbut, feeling that the crisis had arrived, determined to grapple with it.\r\nIt was duty to country before and above fancied loyalty to party to be\r\nconsidered. It is strange what remedies some men deem sensible,\r\nsuggested to prevent famine in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"Obviously the Government was in difficulties. What those difficulties\r\nwere it was not hard to guess. In the previous autumn it had become\r\nknown that, after a long season of sunless wet, the potatoes had\r\neverywhere been attacked by an obscure disease. The failure of this crop\r\nmeant an Irish famine. The steps suggested to meet this impending\r\ncalamity were strange enough. The head of the English peerage\r\nrecommended the poor to rely on curry-powder as a nutritious and\r\nsatisfying food. Another duke thought that the government could show no\r\nfavor to a population almost in a state of rebellion, but that\r\nindividuals might get up a subscription. A noble lord, harmonizing\r\nmaterialism and faith, urged the government to encourage the provision\r\nof salt fish, and at the same time to appoint a day of public\r\nacknowledgment of our dependence on Divine goodness. The council of the\r\nRoyal Agricultural Society, numbering some of the wealthiest noblemen\r\nand squires in England, were not ashamed to lecture the laborers on the\r\nsustaining properties of thrice-boiled bones.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament assembled the Premier entered into an explanation of the\r\nlate ministerial crisis, and unfolded his projected plans. He said that\r\nthe failure of the potato crop had led to the dissolution of the late\r\ngovernment, that matters now could brook no further delay; that prompt\r\naction must now be taken on the Corn Laws; that the progress of reason\r\nand truth demanded it; that his opinions on the subject of Protection\r\nhad undergone a great change; that the experience of the past three\r\nyears confirmed him in his new views; that he could not conceal the\r\nknowledge of his convictions, however much it might lay him open to the\r\ncharge of inconsistency; that, though accused of apathy and neglect, he\r\nand his colleagues were even then engaged in the most extensive and\r\narduous inquiries into the true state of Ireland; and that, as these\r\ninquiries progressed, he has been forced to the conclusion that the\r\nprotection policy was unsound and consequently untenable.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that Mr. Disraeli, the future Parliamentary rival\r\nof Mr. Gladstone, took part, as a member of the House of Commons, in the\r\ndiscussion of the question under consideration. The following words show\r\nhis attitude: \"To the opinions which I have expressed in this House in\r\nfavor of Protection I adhere. They sent to this House, and if I had\r\nrelinquished them I should have relinquished my seat also.\" \"It would be\r\nan unprofitable talk,\" writes Barnett Smith, \"to unravel the many\r\ninconsistencies of Lord Beaconsfield's career; but with regard to this\r\ndeliverance upon Protection, the curious in such matters may turn back\r\nto the records of 1842, when they will discover that at that time he was\r\nquite prepared to advocate measures of a Free Trade character. But we\r\nmust pass on from this important question of the Corn Laws, with the\r\nangry controversy to which it gave rise. Sir Robert Peel brought forward\r\nhis measure, and after lengthened debate in both Houses, it became law,\r\nand grain was admitted into English ports under the new tariff.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all their success in carrying through the important Corn Law\r\nRepeal scheme, the ministry of Sir Robert Peel was doomed to fall upon\r\nan Irish question. The very day that brought their victory in the\r\npassage of the Corn Law Repeal Act in the House of Lords saw the defeat\r\nof the ministry in the House of Commons on their bill for the\r\nsuppression of outrage in Ireland. Sir Robert Peel found himself in a\r\nminority of 73 and therefore tendered his resignation. It was accepted\r\nand Sir Robert Peel went out of office forever. Lord John Russell was\r\nsent for by the Queen, and he succeeded in forming a Whig Ministry.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's return to the Cabinet of Sir Robert Peel, as we have\r\nseen, cost him his seat in the House of Commons. It was not until the\r\nbrief session of 1847, that he appeared again in Parliament. The Queen\r\ndissolved Parliament in person, July, 23d. The election succeeding\r\nturned in many instances upon ecclesiastical questions, and especially\r\nupon the Maynooth grant.\r\n\r\nIt was announced early in 1847 that one of the two members of the House\r\nof Commons for the University of Oxford intended to retire at the next\r\ngeneral election. Mr. Canning had pronounced the representation of the\r\nuniversity as the most coveted prize of public life, and Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself confessed that he \"desired it with an almost passionate\r\nfondness.\" Mr. Gladstone, as a graduate of Oxford, was looked upon not\r\nonly by his contemporaries, but by his seniors and those who came after\r\nhim, with feelings of enthusiastic admiration. The feeling then was\r\nreciprocal, and he was proposed for the vacant seat. Sir R.N. Inglis was\r\nsecure in his seat, and so the contest lay between Mr. Gladstone and Mr.\r\nRound, who was of the ultra-Protestant and Tory school. The contest\r\nexcited the keenest interest and was expected on all hands to be\r\nvery close.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone in his address to the electors of his _Alma Mater_\r\nconfessed that in the earlier part of his public life he had been an\r\nadvocate for the exclusive support of the national religion of the\r\nstate, but it had been in vain; the time was against him. He said: \"I\r\nfound that scarcely a year passed without the adoption of some fresh\r\nmeasure involving the national recognition and the national support of\r\nvarious forms of religion, and, in particular, that a recent and fresh\r\nprovision had been made for the propagation from a public chair of Arian\r\nor Socinian doctrines. The question remaining for me was whether, aware\r\nof the opposition of the English people, I should set down as equal to\r\nnothing, in a matter primarily connected not with our own but with their\r\npriesthood, the wishes of the people of Ireland; and whether I should\r\navail myself of the popular feeling in regard to the Roman Catholics for\r\nthe purpose of enforcing against them a system which we had ceased by\r\ncommon consent to enforce against Arians--a system, above all, of which\r\nI must say that it never can be conformable to policy, to justice or\r\neven to decency, when it has become avowedly partial and one-sided in\r\nits application.\"\r\n\r\nThis address intensified the determination of those opposed to Mr.\r\nGladstone to defeat him. A great portion of the press was, however, in\r\nhis favor. Some of the journals that were enthusiastic for Mr. Gladstone\r\nwere very bitter against Mr. Round. Mr. Gladstone's distinguished talent\r\nand industry were lauded, as well as his earnest attachment to the\r\nChurch of England. He had, however, renounced the exclusiveness of his\r\npolitico-ecclesiastical principles, and no longer importuned Parliament\r\nto ignore all forms of religion but those established by law, or which\r\nwere exactly coincident with his own belief. \"His election,\" declared\r\none journal, \"unlike that of Mr. Round, while it sends an important\r\nmember to the House of Commons, will certainly be creditable, and may be\r\nvaluable to the university; and we heartily hope that no negligence or\r\nhesitation among his supporters may impede his success.\" Even outside of\r\nchurch circles the election was regarded with great interest.\r\n\r\nThe nomination took place July 29th. After the usual ceremony, the\r\nvoting commenced in convocation-house, which was densely crowded. So\r\ngreat was the pressure of the throng that men fainted and had to be\r\ncarried out. Mr. Coleridge, afterward Lord Coleridge, was the secretary\r\nof Mr. Gladstone's committee. Distinguished men, among them Sir Robert\r\nPeel, his colleague in the Cabinet, came from a great distance to\r\n\"plump\" for Mr. Gladstone. The venerable Dr. Routh, then nearly\r\nninety-two years old, came forth from his retirement at Magdalen College\r\nto vote for him. Mrs. Gladstone, according to Mr. Hope-Scott, was an\r\nindefatigable canvasser for her husband. At the close of the poll the\r\nvote stood: Inglis, 1700; Gladstone, 997; Round, 824. Of course Sir\r\nRobert Inglis, with his \"prehistoric Toryism,\" stood at the head. To the\r\nsupporters of Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Round must be added 154 who were\r\npaired. Mr. Gladstone received a majority of 173 over his\r\nultra-Protestant opponent. The total number of those polled exceeded\r\nthat registered at any previous election, showing the intense and\r\ngeneral interest in the result.\r\n\r\nThis period of Mr. Gladstone's life has been very properly styled by one\r\nof his biographers, as the transition period. \"On one side the\r\nConservative Free-trader clings fondly and tenaciously to the Toryism of\r\nhis youth, on another, he is reaching out toward new realms of Liberal\r\nthought and action. He opposes marriage with a deceased wife's sister on\r\ntheological and social grounds, asserting roundly that such marriage is\r\n'contrary to the law of God, declared for three thousand years and\r\nupwards.' He deprecates the appointment of a Commission to enquire into\r\nthe Universities, because it will deter intending benefactors from\r\neffecting their munificent intentions. He argues for a second chamber in\r\nAustralian legislatures, citing, perhaps a little unfortunately, the\r\nconstitutional example of contemporary France. In all these utterances\r\nit is not hard to read the influence of the traditions in which he was\r\nreared, or of the ecclesiastical community which he represents in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\"Yet even in the theological domain a tendency towards Liberalism shows\r\nitself. His hatred of Erastianism is evinced by his gallant but\r\nunsuccessful attempt to secure for the clergy and laity of each colonial\r\ndiocese the power of self-government. Amid the indignant protests of his\r\nTory allies, and in opposition to his own previous speech and vote, he\r\nvindicates the policy of admitting the Jews to Parliament. He defends\r\nthe establishment of diplomatic relations with the Court of Rome; he\r\nsupports the alteration of the parliamentary oath; and, though he will\r\nnot abet an abstract attack on Church Rates, he contends that their\r\nmaintainance involves a corresponding duty to provide accommodation in\r\nthe church for the very poorest of the congregation.\r\n\r\n\"On the commercial side his Liberalism is rampant. With even fanatical\r\nfaith he clings to Free Trade as the best guarantee for our national\r\nstability amid the crash of the dynasties and constitutions which went\r\ndown in '48. He thunders against the insidious dangers of reciprocity.\r\nHe desires, by reforming the laws which govern navigation, to make the\r\nocean, 'that great highway of nations, as free to the ships that\r\ntraverse its bosom as to the winds that sweep it.'\r\n\r\n\"And so the three years--1847, 1848, 1849--rolled by, full of stirring\r\nevents in Europe and in England, in Church and in State, but marked by\r\nno special incidents in the life of Mr. Gladstone. For him these years\r\nwere a period of mental growth, of transition, of development. A change\r\nwas silently proceeding, which was not completed for twenty years, if,\r\nindeed, it has been completed yet. 'There have been,' he wrote in later\r\ndays to Bishop Wilberforce, 'two great deaths, or transmigrations of\r\nspirit, in my political existence--one, very slow, the breaking of ties\r\nwith my original party.' This was now in progress. The other will be\r\nnarrated in due course.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the general election of 1847 that excited the\r\nwildest popular comment was the election of Baron Rothschild for the\r\nCity of London. There was nothing illegal in the election of a Jew, but\r\nhe was virtually precluded from taking his seat in the House of Commons,\r\nbecause the law required every member to subscribe not only to the\r\nChristian religion, but to the Protestant Episcopal faith. To obviate\r\nthis difficulty, Lord John Russell, soon after Parliament assembled,\r\noffered a resolution affirming the eligibility of Jews to all functions\r\nand offices to which Roman Catholics were admissible by law. Sir R.H.\r\nInglis opposed the resolution and Mr. Gladstone, his colleague,\r\nsupported it.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone inquired whether there were any grounds for the\r\ndisqualification of the Jews which distinguished them from any other\r\nclasses in the community. They contended for a \"Christian Parliament,\r\nbut the present measure did not make severance between politics and\r\nreligion, it only amounted to a declaration that there was no necessity\r\nfor excluding a Jew, as such, from an assembly in which every man felt\r\nsure that a vast and overwhelming majority of its members would always\r\nbe Christian. It was said that by admitting a few Jews they would\r\nun-Christianize Parliament; that was true in word, but not in\r\nsubstance.\" He had no doubt that the majority of the members who\r\ncomposed it would always perform their obligations on the true faith of\r\na Christian. It was too late to say that the measure was un-Christian,\r\nand that it would call down the vengeance of heaven. When he opposed the\r\nlast law of the removal of Jewish disabilities, he foresaw that if he\r\ngave the Jew municipal, magisterial and executive functions, we could\r\nnot refuse him legislative functions any longer. \"The Jew was refused\r\nentrance into the House because he would then be a maker of the law; but\r\nwho made the maker of the law? The constituencies; and into these\r\nconstituencies had been admitted the Jews. Now were the constituencies\r\nChristian constituencies? If they were, was it probable that the\r\nParliament would cease to be a Christian Parliament?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone admitted the force of the prayer in Bishop Wilberforce's\r\npetition, that in view of this concession measures should be taken to\r\ngive greater vigor to the Church, and thus operate to the prevention of\r\nan organic change in the relations between Church and State. In\r\nconcluding his defence of Lord John Russell's resolution Mr. Gladstone\r\nexpressed the opinion that if they admitted Jews into Parliament,\r\nprejudice might be awakened for awhile, but the good sense of the people\r\nwould soon allay it, and members would have the consolation of knowing\r\nthat in case of difficulty they had yielded to a sense of justice, and\r\nby so doing had not disparaged religion or lowered Christianity, but\r\nrather had elevated both in all reflecting and well-regulated minds. The\r\nlogic of this speech could not be controverted, though Mr. Newdegate\r\ndeclared that Mr. Gladstone would never have gained his election for the\r\nUniversity of Oxford had his sentiments on the Jewish question been then\r\nknown. The resolution of Lord John Russell was carried by a large\r\nmajority, whereupon he announced first a resolution, and then a bill, in\r\naccordance with its terms.\r\n\r\nThe year 1848 was a year of excitement and revolution. All Europe was in\r\na state of agitation, and France by a new revolution presented another\r\none of her national surprises. The news of a revolution in France caused\r\nthe greatest perturbation throughout England, and disturbances in the\r\ncapital of the country. Great demonstrations were made at Trafalgar\r\nSquare and Charing Cross, March 6th, but the meetings assumed more of a\r\nburlesque than of a serious character. In Glasgow and other parts of the\r\ncountry there were serious riots. Shops were sacked, and the military\r\nwas called out to quell the disturbance, which was not effected until\r\nthe soldiers fired with fatal results upon the rioters. There were\r\nuprisings and mob violence also at Manchester, Edinburgh, Newcastle, but\r\nthey were of a less formidable character. A Chartist meeting was held on\r\nKennington Common, March 13th, but, though the meeting had been looked\r\nforward to with great apprehensions by all lovers of law and order, yet\r\nit passed off without the serious results anticipated.\r\n\r\nThough great preparations were made in view of the demonstration, yet,\r\nfortunately it passed off without loss of life. The meeting however had\r\nfurnished a pretext for the gathering of a lawless mob, although but few\r\nwere politically concerned in it. It was deemed necessary, to provide\r\nagainst every emergency, so special constables in great numbers were\r\nsworn in previous to the meetings, and it is interesting to observe that\r\namongst the citizens who came forward in London to enroll themselves as\r\npreservers of the peace of society were William Ewart Gladstone, the\r\nDuke of Norfolk, the Earl of Derby, and Prince Louis Napoleon,\r\nafterwards Emperor of France.\r\n\r\nThe people were becoming dissatisfied with the government of the\r\ncountry, particularly with its financial measures. A deficiency of two\r\nmillion pounds appeared, and additional taxation would be necessary\r\nowing to the Caffre War. It was therefore proposed to continue the\r\nincome tax for five years and increase it slightly. Owing to the\r\ndistress in Ireland it was not proposed to extend the operation of this\r\nmeasure to that country. The property tax was defended on the same\r\nprinciples laid down by Mr. Pitt, and in 1842, by Sir Robert Peel. But\r\nthis scheme was bitterly opposed and many attributed the depressed\r\ncondition of the finances to free trade. Sir Robert Peel decided to\r\nsupport the proposed tax for three years. Mr. Disraeli desired the\r\nsuccess of Sir Robert Peel's policy, and described himself as a\r\n\"free-trader, but not a free-booter of the Manchester school;\" and he\r\ndubbed the blue-book of the Import Duties Committee \"the greatest work\r\nof imagination that the nineteenth century has produced.\" He said that\r\nthe government, by acting upon it, and taking it for a guide, resembled\r\na man smoking a cigar on a barrel of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nThis epigrammatic speech of Mr. Disraeli brought Mr. Gladstone to his\r\nfeet. He said, by way of introduction, that he could not hope to sustain\r\nthe lively interest created by the remarkable speech of his\r\npredecessor--a display to which he felt himself unequal--he would pass\r\nover the matters of a personal description touched upon by the\r\nhonorable gentleman, and confine himself to defending the policy which\r\nhad been assailed. Mr. Gladstone then demonstrated, by a series of\r\nelaborate statistics, the complete success of Sir Robert Peel's policy.\r\nHe also said, that the confidence of the public would be greatly shaken\r\nby an adverse vote, and he alluded to the unsettled condition of affairs\r\nin the Cabinet. \"I am sure,\" said Mr. Gladstone, \"that this House of\r\nCommons will prove itself to be worthy of the Parliaments which preceded\r\nit, worthy of the Sovereign which it has been called to advise, and\r\nworthy of the people which it has been chosen to represent, by\r\nsustaining this nation, and enabling it to stand firm in the midst of\r\nthe convulsions that shake European society; by doing all that pertains\r\nto us for the purpose of maintaining social order, the stability of\r\ntrade, and the means of public employment; and by discharging our\r\nconsciences, on our own part, under the difficult circumstances of the\r\ncrisis, in the perfect trust that if we set a good example to the\r\nnations--for whose interests we are appointed to consult--they, too,\r\nwill stand firm as they have in other times of almost desperate\r\nemergency; and that through their good sense, their moderation, and\r\ntheir attachment to the institutions of the country, we shall see these\r\ninstitutions still exist, a blessing and a benefit to prosperity,\r\nwhatever alarms and whatever misfortunes may unfortunately befall other\r\nportions of civilized Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was fortunate for the future interests of the country,\" says Dr.\r\nSmith, his biographer, \"that the proposals of the government were at\r\nthis juncture supported by a great majority of the House of Commons. In\r\na moment of unreasoning panic there was some danger of the adoption of a\r\nreactionary policy--a step that would have lost to the country those\r\nblessings which it subsequently enjoyed as the outcome of Free Trade.\"\r\n\r\nMay 15, Mr. Labouchere, President of the Board of Trade, proposed a plan\r\nfor the modification of the navigation laws. Reserving the coasting\r\ntrade and fisheries of Great Britain and the Colonies, it was proposed\r\n\"to throw open the whole navigation of the country, of every sort and\r\ndescription.\" But the Queen claimed the right of putting such\r\nrestrictions as she saw fit upon the navigation of foreign countries, if\r\nthose countries did not meet England on equal terms; and that each\r\ncolony should be allowed to throw open its coasting trade to foreign\r\ncountries. Mr. Gladstone made a lengthy speech, examining closely the\r\noperation of existing laws, and showing the necessity for their repeal.\r\nWith regard to the power claimed by the Queen in Council, with a view to\r\nenforcing reciprocity, Mr. Gladstone said, \"I confess it appears to me\r\nthere is a great objection to conferring such a power as that which is\r\nproposed to be given to the Queen in Council.\" He contended also for a\r\ngradual change in the laws. The policy of excluding the coasting trade\r\nfrom the measure he also condemned. \"It would have been much more frank\r\nto have offered to admit the Americans to our coasting trade if they\r\nwould admit us to theirs.\" If England and America concurred in setting\r\nan example to the world, he hoped we should \"live to see the ocean, that\r\ngreat highway of nations, as free to the ships that traverse its bosom\r\nas the winds that sweep it. England would then have achieved another\r\ntriumph, and have made another powerful contribution to the prosperity\r\nof mankind.\" The bill was postponed until the following year.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1848 Mr. Gladstone spoke upon the proposed grant\r\nof Vancouver's Island to the Hudson's Bay Company; and upon the Sugar\r\nDuties Bill; but the most important speech delivered by him at that time\r\nwas upon a measure to legalize diplomatic relations with the Court of\r\nRome. It was objected that thus recognizing the spiritual governor of\r\nRome and of all the Roman Catholic population of the world, would\r\nneither conciliate the affections of the Protestants, nor satisfy the\r\nwishes of the Roman Catholics, who had denounced it strongly to\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone took broad and comprehensive views of the question. To\r\nsome features of the Bill he was opposed, but was in favor of its\r\nprinciple. It was unfortunate as to time, owing to the condition of\r\naffairs in Italy. England must take one of two positions. If she\r\ndeclined political communication with the See of Rome, she had no right\r\nto complain of any steps which the Pope might take with respect to the\r\nadministration of his own ecclesiastical affairs; but an act so directly\r\nin contravention of the laws of the land as the partitioning of the\r\ncountry into archbishoprics and bishoprics was a most unfortunate\r\nproceeding; wrong because it was generally and justly offensive to the\r\nfeelings of the people of England, and totally unnecessary, as he\r\nbelieved, for Roman Catholic purposes, but also because it ill assorted\r\nwith the grounds on which the Parliament was invited by the present bill\r\nto establish definite relations with the See of Rome. For one hundred\r\nyears after the Reformation the Pope was actually in arms for the\r\npurpose of recovering by force his lost dominions in this country. It\r\nwas only natural, therefore, that we should have prohibited relations\r\nwith the See of Rome when it attacked the title of the Sovereign of\r\nthese realms, but there was no such reason for continuing the\r\nprohibition at the present moment.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied Mr. Gladstone's career carefully attest that this\r\nspeech would have been impossible from his lips ten years before the\r\ntime it was delivered; and early in the next session of Parliament he\r\ndelivered another speech which furnishes us an example of the growth of\r\nhis liberal views in matters of conscience. Lord John Russell proposes\r\nfurther relief upon the matter of oaths to be taken by members of\r\nParliament. Mr. Gladstone said that the civil political claims of the\r\nJew should not be barred, and he deprecated the tendency to degenerate\r\nformalism in oaths, but he was glad that the words, \"on the true faith\r\nof a Christian\" in respect to all Christian members of the House of\r\nCommons had been retained. He also, later in the session, favored\r\ncorrecting the enormous evils growing out of the Church rate system,\r\nwith taxation of all the further support of the State Church. He did not\r\nbelieve in imposing an uncompensated burden upon any man. Every man\r\ncontributing his quota was entitled to demand a free place in the house\r\nof his Maker. \"But the centre and best parts of the Church were occupied\r\nby pews exclusively for the middle classes, while the laboring classes\r\nwere jealously excluded from almost every part of light and hearing in\r\nthe Churches, and were treated in a manner most painful to\r\nreflect upon.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Labouchere re-introduced the ministerial bill for the repeal of\r\nthe Navigation Laws, in the session of 1849, Mr. Gladstone supported\r\ngenerally the measure in a full and exhaustive speech. He favored the\r\nbill with certain modifications. The Marquis of Granby expressed fears\r\nat the consequences of the change proposed, and Mr. Gladstone answered\r\nhim: \"The noble Marquis,\" he observed, \"desired to expel the vapours and\r\nexhalations that had been raised with regard to the principle of\r\npolitical economy, and which vapours and exhalations I find for the most\r\npart in the fears with which those changes are regarded. The noble\r\nMarquis consequently hoped that the Trojan horse would not be allowed to\r\ncome within the walls of Parliament. But however applicable the figures\r\nmay be to other plans, it does not, I submit, apply to the mode of\r\nproceeding I venture to recommend to the House, because we follow the\r\nprecedent of what Mr. Huskisson did before us. Therefore more than one\r\nmoiety of the Trojan horse has already got within the citadel--it has\r\nbeen there for twenty-five years, and yet what has proceeded from its\r\nbowels has only tended to augment the rate of increase in the progress\r\nof your shipping. Therefore, let us not be alarmed by vague and dreamy\r\nratiocinations of evil, which had never been wanting on any occasion,\r\nand which never will be wanting so long as this is a free State, wherein\r\nevery man can find full vent and scope for the expression, not only of\r\nhis principles, but of his prejudices and his fears. Let us not be\r\ndeterred by those apprehensions from giving a calm and serious\r\nexamination to this question, connected as it is with the welfare of our\r\ncountry. Let us follow steadily the light of experience, and be\r\nconvinced that He who preserved us during the past will also be\r\nsufficient to sustain us during all the dangers of the future.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli seized the opportunity to make a caustic speech, in which\r\nhe fiercely attacked both Mr. Labouchere and Mr. Gladstone, and alluded\r\nsarcastically to their \"great sacrifices,\" and said that the latter was\r\nabout to give up that good development of the principle of reciprocity\r\nwhich the House had waited for with so much suspense. Mr. Gladstone\r\nreplied, \"I am perfectly satisfied to bear his sarcasm, good humoured\r\nand brilliant as it is, while I can appeal to his judgment as to whether\r\nthe step I have taken was unbecoming in one who conscientiously differs\r\nwith him on the freedom of trade, and has endeavoured to realize it;\r\nbecause, so far from its being the cause of the distress of the country,\r\nit has been, under the mercy of God, the most signal and effectual means\r\nof mitigating this distress, and accelerating the dawn of the day of\r\nreturning prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone spoke also during the session upon the subject of Colonial\r\nReform which came before the House on several occasions, and especially\r\nin connection with riots in Canada; and on a bill for the removal of\r\nlegal restrictions against marriage with a deceased wife's sister. He\r\nopposed the latter measure upon theological, social, and moral grounds,\r\nand begged the House to repeat the almost entire sentiment of the\r\ncountry respecting the bill. To do otherwise would be to inflict upon\r\nthe Church the misfortune of having anarchy introduced among its\r\nministers. He hoped they would do all that in them lay to maintain the\r\nstrictness of the obligations of marriage, and the purity of the\r\nhallowed sphere of domestic life. The bill was rejected.\r\n\r\nIn the Parliamentary session of 1850 one of the chief topics of\r\ndiscussion was the great depression of the agricultural interests of the\r\ncountry. The country was at peace, the revenues were in a good\r\ncondition, foreign trade had increased, but the farmers still made loud\r\ncomplaints of the disastrous condition, which they attributed to\r\nfree-trade measures, which they contended had affected the whole of the\r\nagricultural interests. Consequently, February 19th, Mr. Disraeli moved\r\nfor a committee of the whole House to consider such a revision of the\r\nPoor Laws of the United Kingdom as might mitigate the distress of the\r\nagricultural classes. Some thought that this was a movement against\r\nfree-trade, but Mr. Gladstone courted the fullest investigation, and\r\nseeing no danger in the motion, voted for it. However, the motion of\r\nMr. Disraeli was lost.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone likewise favored the extension of the benefits of\r\nConstitutional government to certain of the colonies,--for example as\r\nset forth in the Australian Colonies Government Bill; and twice during\r\nthe session he addressed the House on questions connected with slavery,\r\nand upon motion of Mr. Haywood for an inquiry into the state of the\r\nEnglish and Irish universities, and the government unexpectedly gave\r\ntheir consent to the issuing of a Royal Commission for the purpose. Mr.\r\nGladstone said that any person who might be deliberating with himself\r\nwhether he would devote a portion of his substance for prosecuting the\r\nobjects of learning, civilization and religion, would be checked by the\r\nprospect that at any given time, and under any given circumstances, a\r\nminister, who was the creature of a political majority, might institute\r\na state inquiry into the mode in which the funds he might devise were\r\nadministered. It was not wise to discourage eleemosynary establishments.\r\nIt would be better for the Crown to see what could be done to improve\r\nthe colleges by administering existing laws.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the past ten years we exclaim, truly has the period from\r\n1841 to 1850, in the political life of Mr. Gladstone, been called a\r\nmemorable decade.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1850, as we have seen, that the Gladstones were\r\nplunged into domestic sorrow by the death of their little daughter,\r\nCatharine Jessy; and it was this same year that brought to Mr. Gladstone\r\nanother grief from a very different source. This second bereavement was\r\ncaused by the withdrawal of two of his oldest and most intimate friends,\r\nthe Archdeacon of Chichester and Mr. J.R. Hope, from the Protestant\r\nEpiscopal Church of England and their union with the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. Mr. Hope, who became Hope-Scott on succeeding to the estate of\r\nAbbotsford, was the gentleman who helped Mr. Gladstone in getting\r\nthrough the press his book on Church and State, revising, correcting and\r\nreading proof. The Archdeacon, afterwards Cardinal Manning, had, from\r\nhis undergraduate days, exercised a powerful influence over his\r\ncontemporaries. He was gifted with maturity of intellect and character,\r\nhad great shrewdness, much tenacity of will, a cogent, attractive style,\r\ncombined with an impressive air of authority, to which the natural\r\nadvantages of person and bearing added force. Besides having these\r\nqualifications for leadership, he had fervid devotion, enlarged\r\nacquaintance with life and men, and an \"unequalled gift of\r\nadministration;\" though a priest, he was essentially a statesman, and\r\nhad at one time contemplated a political career. He was Mr. Gladstone's\r\nmost trusted counsellor and most intimate friend.\r\n\r\nThe cause, or rather occasion for these secessions from the Church of\r\nEngland to the Church of Rome, is thus related: \"An Evangelical\r\nclergyman, the Rev. G.C. Gorham, had been presented to a living in the\r\ndiocese of Exeter; and that truly formidable prelate, Bishop Phillpotts,\r\nrefused to institute him, alleging that he held heterodox views on the\r\nsubject of Holy Baptism. After complicated litigation, the Judicial\r\nCommittee of the Privy Council decided, on March 8, 1850, that the\r\ndoctrine held by the incriminated clergyman was not such as to bar him\r\nfrom preferment in the Church of England. This decision naturally\r\ncreated great commotion in the Church. Men's minds were rudely shaken.\r\nThe orthodoxy of the Church of England seemed to be jeopardized, and the\r\nsupremacy of the Privy Council was in a matter touching religious\r\ndoctrine felt to be an intolerable burden.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, as well as others, was profoundly agitated by these\r\nevents, and June 4th he expressed his views in a letter to Dr.\r\nBlomfield, Bishop of London. The theme of his letter was, \"The Royal\r\nSupremacy, viewed in the light of Reason, History and the Constitution.\"\r\nHe contended that the Royal Supremacy, as settled at the Reformation,\r\nwas not inconsistent with the spiritual life and inherent jurisdiction\r\nof the Church, but the recent establishment of the Privy Council as the\r\nultimate court of appeal in religious causes was \"an injurious and even\r\ndangerous departure from the Reformation settlement.\"\r\n\r\nIn this letter Mr. Gladstone said, in summing up: \"I find it no part of\r\nmy duty, my lord, to idolize the Bishops of England and Wales, or to\r\nplace my conscience in their keeping. I do not presume or dare to\r\nspeculate upon their particular decisions; but I say that, acting\r\njointly, publicly, solemnly, responsibly, they are the best and most\r\nnatural organs of the judicial office of the Church in matters of\r\nheresy, and, according to reason, history and the constitution, in that\r\nsubject-matter the fittest and safest counsellors of the Crown.\"\r\n\r\nBut this view regarding the Church of England did not suit some minds,\r\nand among them the two friends with whom Mr. Gladstone had, up to this\r\ntime, acted in religious matters. These troubles in the Church so\r\npowerfully affected them that they withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe following quotation shows Mr. Gladstone's firmness in regard to his\r\nown choice of the Protestant Christianity over and above Catholicism, In\r\na letter, written in 1873, to Mrs. Maxwell-Scott, of Abbotsford, the\r\ndaughter of his friend Hope, he thus writes of an interview had with\r\nher father: \"It must have been about this time that I had another\r\nconversation with him about religion, of which, again, I exactly\r\nrecollect the spot. Regarding (forgive me) the adoption of the Roman\r\nreligion by members of the Church of England as nearly the greatest\r\ncalamity that could befall Christian faith in this country, I rapidly\r\nbecame alarmed when these changes began; and very long before the great\r\nluminary, Dr. Newman, drew after him, it may well be said, 'the third\r\npart of the stars of Heaven.' This alarm I naturally and freely\r\nexpressed to the man upon whom I most relied, your father.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gladstone in Wales; addressing a meeting at the foot of\r\nSnowden]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEAPOLITAN PRISONS\r\n\r\nIn considering Mr. Gladstone's exposure of the cruelties practiced in\r\nthe prisons of Naples, we are confronted with his attitude in the House\r\nof Commons just before, in a case where the same principles seemed to be\r\ninvolved, and in which Mr. Gladstone took the directly opposite course.\r\nWe refer to the Don Pacifico case. Both were at first merely personal\r\nquestions, but finally became international. Mr. Gladstone to many\r\nappeared to take an inconsistent course in these seemingly similar\r\ncases, in that while opposing national intervention in the affairs of\r\nDon Pacifico, he tried to stir up all Europe for the relief of the\r\nsufferers in the Neapolitan prisons. \"It is not a little remarkable that\r\nthe statesman who had so lately and so vigorously denounced the 'vain\r\nconception that we, forsooth, have a mission to be the censors of vice\r\nand folly, of abuse and imperfection, among the other countries of the\r\nworld,' should now have found himself irresistibly impelled by\r\nconscience and humanity to undertake a signal and effective crusade\r\nagainst the domestic administration of a friendly power.\"\r\n\r\nThe most memorable debate in the new chamber of the House of Commons,\r\nwhich was first occupied in 1850, was that associated with the name of\r\nDon Pacifico. It is however conceded that the circumstances from which\r\nit all proceeded were comparatively trivial in the extreme. Don Pacifico\r\nwas a Maltese Jew and a British subject, dwelling at Athens. He had made\r\nhimself distasteful to the people of Athens, and consequently his house\r\nwas destroyed and robbed by a mob, April 4, 1847. He appealed to the\r\ngovernment at Athens for redress, demanding over $150,000 indemnity for\r\nthe loss of his property, among which \"a peculiarly sumptuous bedstead\r\nfigured largely.\" Don Pacifico's claim was unheeded, probably because it\r\nwas exorbitant and the Greek government was poor. Lord Palmerston was\r\nthen the Foreign Secretary of the English Government. He was rash and\r\nindependent in his Foreign policy, and often acted, as the Queen\r\ncomplained, without consultation and without the authority of the\r\nSovereign.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Secretary had had other quarrels with the Government at\r\nAthens. Land belonging to an English resident in Athens had been seized\r\nwithout sufficient compensation; Ionian subjects of the English Crown\r\nhad suffered hardships at the hands of the Greek authorities, and an\r\nEnglish Midshipman had been arrested by mistake. Lord Palmerston looked\r\nupon these incidents, slight as they were in themselves, as indicative\r\nof a plot on the part of the French Minister against the English, and\r\nespecially as the Greek Government was so dilatory in satisfying the\r\nEnglish claims. \"This was enough. The outrage on Don Pacifico's bedstead\r\nremained the head and front of Greek offending, but Lord Palmerston\r\nincluded all the other slight blunders and delays of justice in one\r\nsweeping indictment; made the private claims into a national demand, and\r\nperemptorily informed the Greek Government that they must pay what was\r\ndemanded of them within a given time. The Government hesitated, and the\r\nBritish fleet was ordered to the Piraeus, and seized all the Greek\r\nvessels which were found in the waters. Russia and France took umbrage\r\nat this high-handed proceeding and championed Greece. Lord Palmerston\r\ninformed them it was none of their business and stood firm. The French\r\nAmbassador was withdrawn from London, and for awhile the peace of Europe\r\nwas menaced.\" The execution of the orders of Lord Palmerston was left\r\nwith Admiral Sir William Parker, who was first to proceed to Athens with\r\nthe English fleet, and failing to obtain satisfaction was to blockade\r\nthe Piraeus, which instructions he faithfully obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe debate began in Parliament June 24, 1850. The stability of the Whig\r\nadministration, then in power, depended upon the results. In the House\r\nof Lords, Lord Stanley moved a resolution, which was carried, expressing\r\nregret that \"various claims against the Greek Government, doubtful in\r\npoint of justice and exaggerated in amount, have been enforced by\r\ncoercive measures, directed against the commerce and people of Greece,\r\nand calculated to endanger the continuance of our friendly relations\r\nwith foreign powers.\" A counter-resolution was necessary in the House of\r\nCommons to offset the action of the Lords, so a Radical, Mr. Roebuck,\r\nmuch to the surprise of many, came to the defense of the Government and\r\noffered the following motion, which was carried: \"That the principles\r\nwhich have hitherto regulated the foreign policy of Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment are such as were required to preserve untarnished the honor\r\nand dignity of this country, and, in times of unexampled difficulty, the\r\nbest calculated to maintain peace between England and the various\r\nnations of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate which followed, and which was prolonged over four nights, was\r\nmarked on both sides by speeches of unusual oratorical power and\r\nbrilliancy. The speeches of Lord Palmerston, Sir Robert Peel, Mr.\r\nCockburn, Mr. Cobden, Mr. Disraeli and Mr. Gladstone were pronounced as\r\nremarkable orations. Sir Robert Peel made a powerful speech against the\r\nMinisters, which was made memorable not only for its eloquence, but\r\nbecause it was his last. Lord Palmerston defended himself vigorously in\r\na speech of five hours' duration. \"He spoke,\" said Mr. Gladstone, \"from\r\nthe dusk of one day to the dawn of the next.\" He defended his policy at\r\nevery point. In every step taken he had been influenced by the sole\r\ndesire that the meanest, the poorest, even the most disreputable subject\r\nof the English Crown should be defended by the whole might of England\r\nagainst foreign oppression. He reminded them of all that was implied in\r\nthe Roman boast, _Civis Romanus sum_, and urged the House to make it\r\nclear that a British subject, in whatever land he might be, should feel\r\nconfident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of England could\r\nprotect him. This could not be resisted. _Civis Romanus sum_ settled\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's reply was a masterpiece. It was exhaustive and\r\ntrenchant, and produced a great effect. He first spoke upon the position\r\nof the Government and the constitutional doctrines which they had laid\r\ndown in regard to it, and then severely condemned the conduct of the\r\nPremier for being so heedless of the censure of the House of Lords and\r\nin trying to shield himself behind the precedents which are in reality\r\nno precedents at all. With reference to the Greek question, he\r\nrepudiated precedents which involved the conduct of strong countries\r\nagainst weak ones. The Greek Government had put no impediment in the way\r\nof arbitration. Instead of trusting and trying the tribunals of the\r\ncountry and employing diplomatic agency simply as a supplemental\r\nresource, Lord Palmerston had interspersed authority of foreign power,\r\nin contravention both of the particular stipulations of the treaty in\r\nforce between Greece and England and of the general principles of the\r\nlaw of nations. He had thus set the mischievous example of abandoning\r\nthe methods of law and order, and resorted to those of force.\r\nNon-interference had been laid down as the basis of our conduct towards\r\nother nations, but the policy of Lord Palmerston had been characterized\r\nby a spirit of active interference.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's words were in part as follows: \"Does he [Lord\r\nPalmerston] make the claim for us [the English] that we are to be lifted\r\nupon a platform high above the standing-ground of all other nations?...\r\nIt is indeed too clear ... that he adopts, in part, the vain conception\r\nthat we, forsooth, have a mission to be the censors of vice and folly,\r\nof abuse and imperfection among the other countries of the world; that\r\nwe are to be the universal schoolmasters, and that all those who\r\nhesitate to recognize our office can be governed only by prejudice or\r\npersonal animosity, and shall have the blind war of diplomacy forthwith\r\ndeclared against them.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"Let us recognize, and recognize with frankness, the equality of\r\nthe weak with the strong; the principles of brotherhood among nations,\r\nand of their sacred independence. When we are asking for the maintenance\r\nof the rights which belong to our fellow-subjects, resident in Greece,\r\nlet us do as we would be done by, and let us pay all respect to a feeble\r\nState and to the infancy of free institutions.... Let us refrain from\r\nall gratuitous and arbitrary meddling in the internal concerns of other\r\nStates, even as we should resent the same interference if it were\r\nattempted to be practiced toward ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nIn this address Mr. Gladstone evinces his inclination to appeal to the\r\nhigher and nobler nature of man, to the principles of brotherhood among\r\nnations, to the law of God and nature, and to ask as a test of the\r\nforeign policy of the government, not whether it is striking, or\r\nbrilliant, or successful, but whether it is right.\r\n\r\nThis speech of Mr. Gladstone's was recognized as the finest he had\r\ndelivered in Parliament, and its power was acknowledged by both sides of\r\nthe House, by political opponent and friend. Lord Chief Justice\r\nCockburn, then a member of the House, referring in a speech the\r\nfollowing evening to Mr. Gladstone and his remarkable speech, uttered\r\nthese words: \"I suppose we are now to consider him as the representative\r\nof Lord Stanley in the House--Gladstone _Vice_ Disraeli, am I to say,\r\nresigned or superseded?\" The government was sustained.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that it was during this memorable debate that Sir\r\nRobert Peel made his last speech.--On the following day, 29th of June,\r\n1850, Sir Robert called at Buckingham Palace for the purpose of leaving\r\nhis card. On proceeding up Constitution Hill on horse back he met one of\r\nLady Dover's daughters, and exchanged salutations. Immediately\r\nafterwards his horse became restive and shying towards the rails of the\r\nGreen Park, threw Sir Robert sideways on his left shoulder. Medical aid\r\nwas at hand and was at once administered. Sir Robert groaned when lifted\r\nand when asked whether he was much hurt replied, \"Yes, very much.\" He\r\nwas conveyed home where the meeting with his family was very affecting,\r\nand he swooned in the arms of his physician. He was placed upon a sofa\r\nin the dining-room from which he never moved. His sufferings were so\r\nacute that a minute examination of his injuries could not be made. For\r\ntwo or three days he lingered and then died, July 2d. An examination\r\nmade after death revealed the fact that the fifth rib on the left side\r\nwas fractured, the broken rib pressing on the lung, producing effusion\r\nand pulmonary engorgement. This was probably the seat of the mortal\r\ninjury, and was where Sir Robert complained of the greatest pain.\r\n\r\nThe news of Sir Robert's death produced a profound sensation throughout\r\nthe land. Great and universal were the tokens of respect and grief.\r\nThere was but one feeling,--that England had lost one of her most\r\nillustrious statesmen. Even those who had been in opposition to his\r\nviews, alluded to the great loss the nation had sustained and paid a\r\nfitting tribute to his memory. The House of Commons, on motion of Mr.\r\nHume July 3d, at once adjourned. In the House of Lords the Duke of\r\nWellington and Lord Brougham spoke in appreciative words of the departed\r\nstatesman. \"Such was the leader whom Mr. Gladstone had faithfully\r\nfollowed for many years.\"\r\n\r\nSupporting Mr. Hume's motion, Mr. Gladstone said: \"I am quite sure that\r\nevery heart is much too full to allow us, at a period so early, to enter\r\nupon a consideration of the amount of that calamity with which the\r\ncountry has been visited in his, I must even now say, premature death;\r\nfor though he has died full of years and full of honors, yet it is a\r\ndeath which our human eyes will regard as premature; because we had\r\nfondly hoped that, in whatever position he was placed, by the weight of\r\nhis character, by the splendor of his talents, by the purity of his\r\nvirtues, he would still have been spared to render to his countrymen the\r\nmost essential services. I will only, sir, quote those most touching and\r\nfeeling lines which were applied by one of the greatest poets of this\r\ncountry to the memory of a man great indeed, but yet not greater than\r\nSir Robert Peel:\"\r\n\r\n     'Now is the stately column broke,\r\n      The beacon light is quenched in smoke;\r\n      The trumpet's silver voice is still;\r\n      The warder silent on the hill.'\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I will add no more--in saying this I have, perhaps, said too much.\r\nIt might have been better had I confined myself to seconding the motion.\r\nI am sure the tribute of respect which we now offer will be all the more\r\nvaluable from the silence with which the motion is received, and which I\r\nwell know has not arisen from the want, but from the excess of feeling\r\non the part of members of this House.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Sir Robert Peel began the disintegration of the party\r\ndistinguished by his name--Peelites. Some of its members united with the\r\nConservatives, and others, such as Sir James Graham, Sidney Herbert, and\r\nMr. Gladstone held themselves aloof from both Whigs and Tories.\r\nConservative traditions still exercised considerable influence over\r\nthem, but they could not join them, because they were already\r\nsurrendering to strong liberal tendencies. It is said that Mr. Gladstone\r\nat this time, and for a decade thereafter, until the death of Sir James\r\nGraham, was greatly indebted to this statesman, not only for the growth\r\nof his liberal principles, but for his development as a practical\r\nstatesman. Sir James wielded great influence over his contemporaries\r\ngenerally, because of his great knowledge of Parliamentary tactics, and\r\nthe fact that he was the best educated and most thoroughly accomplished\r\nstatesman of his age. \"If he could be prevailed upon to speak in the\r\ncourse of a great debate, his speech was worth fifty votes,\" so great\r\nwas his influence and power. \"However great may have been the\r\nindebtedness of Mr. Gladstone to Sir James Graham, if the former had not\r\nbeen possessed of far wider sympathies--to say nothing of superior\r\nspecial intellectual qualities--than his political mentor, he never\r\ncould have conceived and executed those important legislative acts for\r\nwhich his name will now chiefly be remembered.\"\r\n\r\nThe other case occupying the attention of Parliament, to which we have\r\nalluded, we must now consider--Mr. Gladstone and the prisons of Naples.\r\nOwing to the illness of one of his children, for whom a southern climate\r\nwas recommended, Mr. Gladstone spent several months of the Winter of\r\n1850-1 in Naples. His brief visit to this city on a purely domestic\r\nmission was destined to assume an international importance. It came to\r\nhis knowledge that a large number of the citizens of Naples, who had\r\nbeen members of the Chamber of Deputies, an actual majority of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, had been exiled or imprisoned by King\r\nFerdinand, because they formed the opposition party to the government,\r\nand that between twenty and thirty thousand of that monarch's subjects\r\nhad been cast into prison on the charge of political disaffection. The\r\nsympathies of Mr. Gladstone were at once enlisted in behalf of the\r\noppressed Neapolitans. At first Mr. Gladstone looked at the matter only\r\nfrom a humanitarian and not from a political aspect, and it was only\r\nupon the former ground that he felt called and impelled to attempt the\r\nredress of the wrongs which were a scandal to the name of civilisation\r\nin Europe. And it was not long before England and the Continent were\r\naroused by his denunciations of the Neapolitan system of government. Mr.\r\nGladstone first carefully ascertained the truth of the statements made\r\nto him in order to attest their accuracy, and then published two letters\r\non the subject addressed to the Earl of Aberdeen. These letters were\r\nsoon followed by a third. In the first of these letters, dated April 7,\r\n1851, he brings an elaborate, detailed and horrible indictment against\r\nthe rulers of Naples, especially as regards their prisons and the\r\ntreatment of persons confined in them for political offenses. He\r\ndisclaimed any thought of having gone to Naples for the purpose of\r\npolitical criticism or censorship, to look for defects in the\r\nadministration of the government, or to hear the grievances of the\r\npeople, or to propagate ideas belonging to another country. But after a\r\nresidence of three or four months in their city he had returned home\r\nwith a deep feeling of the duty upon him to make some endeavor to\r\nmitigate the horrors in the midst of which the government of Naples was\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nThere were chiefly three reasons that led him to adopt the present\r\ncourse: \"First, that the present practices of the Government of Naples,\r\nin reference to real or supposed political offenders, are an outrage\r\nupon religion, upon civilization, upon humanity and upon decency.\r\nSecondly, that these practices are certainly, and even rapidly, doing\r\nthe work of Republicanism in that country--a political creed which has\r\nlittle natural or habitual root in the character of the people. Thirdly,\r\nthat as a member of the Conservative party in one of the great family of\r\nEuropean nations, I am compelled to remember that party stands in\r\nvirtual and real, though perhaps unconscious alliance with all the\r\nestablished Governments of Europe as such; and that, according to the\r\nmeasure of its influence, they suffer more or less of moral detriment\r\nfrom its reverses, and derive strength and encouragement from its\r\nsuccesses.\"\r\n\r\nHe passed over the consideration of the all important question whether\r\nthe actual Government of the Two Sicilies was one with or without a\r\ntitle, one of law or one of force, and came to the real question at\r\nissue. His charge against the Neapolitan Government was not one of mere\r\nimperfection, not corruption in low quarters, not occasional severity,\r\nbut that of incessant, systematic, deliberate violation of the law by\r\nthe power appointed to watch over and maintain it.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, with impassionate language, thus formulates his fearful\r\nindictment: \"It is such violation of human and written law as this,\r\ncarried on for the purpose of violating every other law, unwritten and\r\neternal, human and divine; it is the wholesale persecution of virtue,\r\nwhen united with intelligence, operating upon such a scale that entire\r\nclasses may with truth be said to be its object, so that the Government\r\nis in bitter and cruel, as well as utterly illegal hostility to whatever\r\nin the nation really lives and moves, and forms the mainspring of\r\npractical progress and improvement; it is the awful profanation of\r\npublic religion, by its notorious alliance in the governing powers with\r\nthe violation of every moral rule under the stimulants of fear and\r\nvengeance; it is the perfect prostitution of the judicial office which\r\nhas made it, under veils only too threadbare and transparent, the\r\ndegraded recipient of the vilest and clumsiest forgeries, got up\r\nwilfully and deliberately, by the immediate advisers of the Crown, for\r\nthe purpose of destroying the peace, the freedom, aye, and even, if not\r\nby capital sentences, the life of men among the most virtuous, upright,\r\nintelligent, distinguished and refined of the whole community; it is the\r\nsavage and cowardly system of moral as well as in a lower degree of\r\nphysical torture, through which the sentences obtained from the debased\r\ncourts of justice are carried into effect.\r\n\r\n\"The effect of all this is a total inversion of all the moral and social\r\nideas. Law, instead of being respected, is odious. Force and not\r\naffection is the foundation of government. There is no association, but\r\na violent antagonism between the idea of freedom and that of order. The\r\ngoverning power, which teaches of itself that it is the image of God\r\nupon earth, is clothed in the view of the overwhelming majority of the\r\nthinking public with all the vices for its attributes. I have seen and\r\nheard the strong expression used, 'This is the negation of God erected\r\ninto a system of Government.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was not merely the large numbers imprisoned unjustly, to which public\r\nattention was directed, that called for righteous indignation and made\r\nMr. Gladstone's words create such a sensation in Europe, but the mode of\r\nprocedure was arbitrary in the extreme. The law of Naples required that\r\npersonal liberty should be inviolable, except under warrant from a court\r\nof justice. Yet in utter disregard of this law the authorities watched\r\nthe people, paid domiciliary visits, ransacked houses, seized papers and\r\neffects, and tore up floors at pleasure under pretense of searching for\r\narms, imprisoned men by the score, by the hundred, by the thousand\r\nwithout any warrant whatever, sometimes without even any written\r\nauthority whatever, or anything beyond the word of a policeman,\r\nconstantly without any statement whatever of the nature of the offense.\r\nCharges were fabricated to get rid of inconvenient persons. Perjury and\r\nforgery were resorted to in order to establish charges, and the whole\r\nmode of conducting trials was a burlesque of justice.\r\n\r\nHe thus describes the dungeons of Naples, in which some of the prisoners\r\nwere confined for their political opinions: \"The prisons of Naples, as\r\nis well known, are another name for the extreme of filth and horror. I\r\nhave really seen something of them, but not the worst. This I have seen,\r\nmy Lord: the official doctors not going to the sick prisoners, but the\r\nsick prisoners, men almost with death on their faces, toiling up stairs\r\nto them at that charnel-house of the Vicaria, because the lower regions\r\nof such a palace of darkness are too foul and loathsome to allow it to\r\nbe expected that professional men should consent to earn bread by\r\nentering them.\" Of some of those sufferers Mr. Gladstone speaks\r\nparticularly. He names Pironte, formerly a judge, Baron Porcari, and\r\nCarlo Poerio, a distinguished patriot. The latter he specially speaks of\r\nas a refined and accomplished gentleman, a copious and elegant speaker,\r\na respected and blameless character, yet he had been arrested and\r\ncondemned for treason. Mr. Gladstone says: \"The condemnation of such a\r\nman for treason is a proceeding just as conformable to the laws of\r\ntruth, justice, decency, and fair play, and to the common sense of the\r\ncommunity--in fact, just as great and gross an outrage on them all--as\r\nwould be a like condemnation in this country of any of our best known\r\npublic men--Lord John Russell, or Lord Lansdowne, or Sir James Graham,\r\nor yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no name dearer to Englishmen than that of Poerio to his\r\nNeapolitan fellow-countrymen. Poerio was tried and condemned on the sole\r\naccusation of a worthless character named Jerrolino. He would have been\r\nacquitted nevertheless, by a division of four to five of his judges, had\r\nnot Navarro (who sat as a judge while directly concerned in the charge\r\nagainst the prisoner), by the distinct use of intimidation, procured\r\nthe number necessary for a sentence. A statement is furnished on the\r\nauthority of an eye-witness, as to the inhumanity with which invalid\r\nprisoners were treated by the Grand Criminal Court of Naples; and Mr.\r\nGladstone minutely describes the manner of the imprisonment of Poerio\r\nand six of his incarcerated associates. Each prisoner bore a weight of\r\nchain amounting to thirty-two pounds and for no purpose whatever were\r\nthese chains undone. All the prisoners were confined, night and day, in\r\na small room, which may be described as amongst the closest of dungeons;\r\nbut Poerio was after this condemned to a still lower depth of calamity\r\nand suffering. \"Never before have I conversed,\" says Mr. Gladstone,\r\nspeaking of Poerio, \"and never probably shall I converse again, with a\r\ncultivated and accomplished gentleman, of whose innocence, obedience to\r\nlaw, and love of his country, I was as firmly and as rationally assured\r\nas your lordship's or that of any other man of the very highest\r\ncharacter, whilst he stood before me, amidst surrounding felons, and\r\nclad in the vile uniform of guilt and shame.\" But he is now gone where\r\nhe will scarcely have the opportunity even of such conversation. I\r\ncannot honestly suppress my conviction that the object in the case of\r\nPoerio, as a man of mental power sufficient to be feared, is to obtain\r\nthe scaffold's aim by means more cruel than the scaffold, and without\r\nthe outcry which the scaffold would create.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone said that it was time for the veil to be lifted from\r\nscenes more fit for hell than earth, or that some considerable\r\nmitigation should be voluntarily adopted. This letter was published in\r\n1851--the year of the great Exposition in London--and a copy was sent to\r\nthe representative of the Queen in every court of Europe. Its\r\npublication caused a wide-spread indignation in England, a great\r\nsensation abroad, and profoundly agitated the court of Naples.\r\n\r\nIn the English Parliament Sir De Lacy Evans put the following question\r\nto the Foreign Secretary: \"If the British Minister at the court of\r\nNaples had been instructed to employ his good offices in the cause of\r\nhumanity, for the diminution of these lamentable severities, and with\r\nwhat result?\" In reply to this question Lord Palmerston accepted and\r\nadopted Mr. Gladstone's statement, which had been confirmed from other\r\nquarters, expressing keen sympathy and humanitarian feeling with the\r\ncause which he had espoused, but Lord Palmerston pointed out that it was\r\nimpossible to do anything in a matter which related entirely to the\r\ndomestic affairs of the Government at Naples. He said: \"Instead of\r\nconfining himself to those amusements that abound in Naples, instead of\r\ndiving into volcanoes, and exploring excavated cities, we see him going\r\ninto courts of justice, visiting prisons, descending into dungeons, and\r\nexamining great numbers of the cases of unfortunate victims of\r\nillegality and injustice, with the view afterwards to enlist public\r\nopinion in the endeavor to remedy those abuses.\" This announcement by\r\nthe Foreign Secretary was warmly applauded by the House. \"A few days\r\nafterwards Lord Palmerston was requested by Prince Castelcicala to\r\nforward the reply of the Neapolitan Government to the different European\r\ncourts to which Mr. Gladstone's pamphlet had been sent. His lordship,\r\nwith his wonted courage and independent spirit, replied that he 'must\r\ndecline being accessory to the circulation of a pamphlet which, in my\r\nopinion, does no credit to its writer, or the Government which he\r\ndefends, or to the political party of which he professes to be the\r\nchampion.' He also informed the Prince that information received from\r\nother sources led him to the conclusion that Mr. Gladstone had by no\r\nmeans overstated the various evils which he had described; and he [Lord\r\nPalmerston] regretted that the Neapolitan Government had not set to work\r\nearnestly and effectually to correct the manifold and grave abuses which\r\nclearly existed.\"\r\n\r\nThe second paper of Mr. Gladstone upon the same subject was a sequel to\r\nthe first. His wish was that everything possible should be done first\r\nin the way of private representation and remonstrance, and he did not\r\nregret the course he had taken, though it entailed devious delays. In\r\nanswer to the natural inquiry why he should simply appear in his\r\npersonal capacity through the press, instead of inviting to the grave\r\nand painful question the attention of the House of Commons, of which he\r\nwas a member, he said, that he had advisedly abstained from mixing up\r\nhis statements with any British agency or influences which were\r\nofficial, diplomatic, or political. The claims and interests which he\r\nhad in view were either wholly null and valueless, or they were broad as\r\nthe extension of the human race and long-lived as its duration.\r\n\r\nAs to his general charges he had nothing to retract. His representations\r\nhad not been too strongly stated, for the most disgraceful circumstances\r\nwere those which rested upon public notoriety, or upon his own personal\r\nknowledge. It had been stated that he had overestimated the number of\r\nprisoners, and he would give the Neapolitan Government the full benefit\r\nof any correction. But the number of political prisoners _in itself_,\r\nwas a secondary feature of the case, for \"if they were fairly and\r\nlegally arrested, fairly and legally treated before trial--fairly and\r\nlegally tried, that was the main matter. For the honor of human nature\r\nmen would at first receive some statements with incredulity. Men ought\r\nto be slow to believe that such things could happen, and happen in a\r\nChristian country, the seat of almost the oldest European civilization.\"\r\nBut those thus disposed in the beginning he hoped would not close their\r\nminds to the reception of the truth, however painful to believe. The\r\ngeneral probability of his statements could not, unfortunately\r\nbe gainsaid.\r\n\r\nMany replies were made to Mr. Gladstone's pamphlet that were violent and\r\nabusive. They appeared not only in Naples, Turin, and Paris, but even\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nAll these answers, were in truth no replies at all, for they did not\r\ndisprove the facts. These professed corrections of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nstatements did not touch the real basis of the question. It was\r\nnecessary to say something if possible by way of defense, or justice,\r\nwhich had as yet not been done.\r\n\r\nThere was one reply that was put forth that Mr. Gladstone felt demanded\r\nsome attention, namely, the official answer of the Neapolitan Government\r\nto his charges. To this he replied in a letter, in 1852. In his reply he\r\nplaced, point by point, the answers in the scales along with his own\r\naccusations. There was in the Neapolitan answers to the letters really a\r\ntacit admission of the accuracy of nine-tenths of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nstatements, Mr. Gladstone enumerated the few retractions which he had\r\nto make, which were five in number. That the prisoner, Settembrine, had\r\nnot been tortured and confined to double chains for life, as was\r\ncurrently reported and believed; that six judges had been dismissed at\r\nReggio upon presuming to acquit a batch of political prisoners, required\r\nmodifying to three; that seventeen invalids had not been massacred in\r\nthe prison of Procida during a revolt, as stated; and that certain\r\nprisoners alleged to have been still incarcerated after acquittal had\r\nbeen released after the lapse of two days. These were all the\r\nmodifications he had to make in his previous statements. And as to the\r\nlong list of his grave accusations, not one of them rested upon hearsay.\r\nHe pointed out how small and insignificant a fraction of error had found\r\nits way into his papers. He fearlessly reasserted that agonizing\r\ncorporal punishment was inflicted by the officials in Neapolitan\r\nprisons, and that without judicial authority. As to Settembrine, the\r\npolitical prisoner named, he was incarcerated in a small room with eight\r\nother prisoners, one of whom boasted that he had murdered, at various\r\ntimes, thirty-five persons. Several of his victims had been his prison\r\ncompanions, and \"the murders of this Ergastolo\" had exceeded fifty in a\r\nsingle year. It was true that at the massacre at Procida the sick had\r\nnot been slain in the prisons, yet prisoners who hid under beds were\r\ndragged forth and shot in cold blood by the soldiery after order had\r\nbeen restored. The work of slaughter had been twice renewed, and two\r\nofficers received promotion or honors for that abominable enormity.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone found in the reply of the Government of Naples no reason\r\nto retract his damaging statements in reference to Neapolitan\r\ninhumanity, on the other hand he discovered grounds for emphasizing his\r\naccusations. And as to his statement regarding the number of the\r\nsufferers from Neapolitan injustice and cruelty, he defended at length\r\nhis statement as to the enormous number of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to all candid minds that all the replies had failed to\r\nprove him wrong in any of his substantial changes, which retained their\r\nfull force. \"The arrow has shot deep into the mark,\" observed Mr.\r\nGladstone, \"and cannot be dislodged. But I have sought, in once more\r\nentering the field, not only to sum up the state of the facts in the\r\nmanner nearest to exactitude, but likewise to close the case as I began\r\nit, presenting it from first to last in the light of a matter which is\r\nnot primarily or mainly political, which is better kept apart from\r\nParliamentary discussion, which has no connection whatever with any\r\npeculiar idea or separate object or interest of England, but which\r\nappertains to the sphere of humanity at large, and well deserves the\r\nconsideration of every man who feels a concern for the well-being of\r\nhis race, in its bearings on that well-being; on the elementary demands\r\nof individual domestic happiness; on the permanent maintenance of public\r\norder; on the stability of thrones; on the solution of that great\r\nproblem, which, day and night, in its innumerable forms must haunt the\r\nreflections of every statesman, both here and elsewhere, how to\r\nharmonize the old with the new conditions of society, and to mitigate\r\nthe increasing stress of time and change upon what remains of this\r\nancient and venerable fabric of the traditional civilization of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone also said, that the question had been asked, whether a\r\ngovernment \"could be induced to change its policy, because some\r\nindividual or other had by lying accusations held it up to the hatred of\r\nmankind,\" yet he had the satisfaction of knowing that upon the challenge\r\nof a mere individual, the government of Naples had been compelled to\r\nplead before the tribunal of general opinion, and to admit the\r\njurisdiction of that tribunal. It was to public sentiment that the\r\nNeapolitan Government was paying deference when it resolved on the manly\r\ncourse of a judicial reply; and he hoped that further deference would be\r\npaid to that public sentiment in the complete reform of its departments\r\nand the whole future management of its affairs.\r\n\r\nAfter a consideration of the political position of the throne of the\r\nTwo Sicilies, in connection with its dominions on the mainland, Mr.\r\nGladstone thus concluded his examination of the official reply of the\r\nNeapolitan Government: \"These pages have been written in the hope that,\r\nby thus making, through the press, rather than in another mode, that\r\nrejoinder to the Neapolitan reply which was doubtless due from me, I\r\nmight still, as far as depended on me, keep the question on its true\r\nground, as one not of politics but of morality, and not of England but\r\nof Christendom and of mankind. Again I express the hope that this may be\r\nmy closing word. I express the hope that it may not become a hard\r\nnecessity to keep this controversy alive until it reaches its one only\r\npossible issue, which no power of man can permanently intercept. I\r\nexpress the hope that while there is time, while there is quiet, while\r\ndignity may yet be saved in showing mercy, and in the blessed work of\r\nrestoring Justice to her seat, the Government of Naples may set its hand\r\nin earnest to the work of real and searching, however quiet and\r\nunostentatious, reform; that it may not become unavoidable to reiterate\r\nthese appeals from the hand of power to the one common heart of mankind;\r\nto produce these painful documents, those harrowing descriptions, which\r\nmight be supplied in rank abundance, of which I have scarcely given the\r\nfaintest idea or sketch, and which, if laid from time to time before the\r\nworld, would bear down like a deluge every effort at apology or\r\npalliation, and would cause all that has recently been made known to be\r\nforgotten and eclipsed in deeper horrors yet; lest the strength of\r\noffended and indignant humanity should rise up as a giant refreshed with\r\nwine, and, while sweeping away these abominations from the eye of\r\nHeaven, should sweep away along with them things pure and honest,\r\nancient, venerable, salutary to mankind, crowned with the glories of the\r\npast and still capable of bearing future fruit.\"\r\n\r\nThe original purpose of these letters, though at first not gained, was\r\nunmistakable in the subsequent revolution which created a regenerated,\r\nfree and united Italy. The moral influence of such an exposure was\r\nincalculable and eventually irresistible. The great Italian patriot and\r\nliberator of Italy, General Garibaldi, was known to say that Mr.\r\nGladstone's protest \"sounded the first trumpet call of Italian liberty.\"\r\nIf France and England had unitedly protested against the Neapolitan\r\nabuse of power and violation of law, such a protest would have been\r\nheard and redress granted, but such joint action was not taken. The\r\nletters reached the fourteenth edition and in this edition Mr. Gladstone\r\nsaid that by a royal decree, issued December 27, 1858, ninety-one\r\npolitical prisoners had their punishment commuted into perpetual exile\r\nfrom the kingdom of the two Sicilies, but that a Ministerial order of\r\nJanuary 9, 1859, directed that they should be conveyed to America; that\r\nof these ninety-one persons no less than fourteen had died long before\r\nin dungeons, and that only sixty-six of them embarked January 16, 1859,\r\nand were taken to Cadiz, where they were shipped on board an American\r\nsailing vessel, which was to have carried them to New York, but\r\neventually landed them at Cork. \"Eleven men were kept behind, either\r\nbecause it was afterwards thought advisable not to release them, as in\r\nthe case of Longo and Delli Franci, two artillery officers, who were\r\nstill in the dungeons of Gaeta. Whenever the prisoners were too sick to\r\nbe moved, as was the case with Pironti, who was paralytic; or because\r\nthey were in some provincial dungeons too remote from Naples.\" Such was\r\nthe fate of some of the patriots officially liberated by Ferdinand's\r\nsuccessor, Francis II.\r\n\r\nThe charges of Mr. Gladstone against the Neapolitan Government met with\r\nconfirmation from another source nearer home. In 1851 Mr. Gladstone\r\ntranslated and published Farini's important and bulky work, entitled,\r\n\"The Roman State, from 1815 to 1850.\" The author, Farini, addressed a\r\nnote to his translator, in which he said that he had dedicated the\r\nconcluding volume of his work to Mr. Gladstone, who, by his love of\r\nItalian letters, and by his deeds of Italian charity, had established a\r\nrelationship with Italy in the spirit of those great Italian writers who\r\nhad been their masters in eloquence, in civil philosophy and in national\r\nvirtue, from Dante and Macchivelli down to Alfieri and Gioberti. Signor\r\nFarini endorsed the charges made by Mr. Gladstone against the Neapolitan\r\nGovernment. He wrote: \"The scandalous trials for high treason still\r\ncontinue at Naples; accusers, examiners, judges, false witnesses, all\r\nare bought; the prisons, those tombs of the living, are full; two\r\nthousand citizens of all ranks and conditions are already condemned to\r\nthe dungeons, as many to confinement, double that number to exile; the\r\nmajority guilty of no crime but that of having believed in the oaths\r\nmade by Ferdinand II. But, in truth, nothing more was needed to press\r\nhome the indictment.\"\r\n\r\nAt the period of Mr. Gladstone's visit to Naples there was a growing\r\nsentiment throughout Italy for Italian independence and union. The\r\ninfamous measures adopted by the King of Naples to repress in his own\r\ndominions every aspiration after freedom, only succeeded in making the\r\npeople more determined and the liberty for which they sighed surer in\r\nthe end. His system of misgovernment went on for a few years longer and\r\nwas the promoting cause of the revolutionary movements which continually\r\ndisturbed the whole Italian peninsula. A conference was held in Paris\r\nupon the Italian question, which failed to accomplish anything, against\r\nwhich failure Count Cavour addressed a protest to the French and British\r\nGovernments in April, 1856. Afterwards the King of Naples and his\r\nMinisters were remonstrated with, but this was of no avail, only drawing\r\nforth an assertion that the sovereign had the right to deal with his own\r\nsubjects as he pleased. France and England finally withdrew their\r\nrepresentatives from Naples, and the storm soon afterwards broke. The\r\nbrilliant success of Garibaldi in 1860 filled Francis II with terror. He\r\nwas now, like all evil men, ready to make the most lavish promises of\r\nliberal reform to escape the consequences of his misdeeds. However, his\r\nrepentance came too late. The victorious Garibaldi issued a decree\r\nultimately, stating that the Two Sicilies, which had been redeemed by\r\nItalian blood, and which had freely elected him their dictator, formed\r\nan integral part of one and indivisable Italy, under the constitutional\r\nKing Victor Emmanuel and his descendants. Francis II was dethroned and\r\nexpelled from his kingdom by the legitimate fruits of his own hateful\r\npolicy and that of his predecessor. \"Count Cavour was the brain as\r\nGaribaldi was the hand of that mighty movement which resulted in the\r\nunity of Italy,\" says an English writer, \"but as Englishmen we may take\r\npride in the fact that not the least among the precipitating causes of\r\nthis movement was the fearless exposure by Mr. Gladstone of the\r\ncruelties and tyrannies of the Neapolitan Government.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLADSTONE VISITING NEAPOLITAN PRISONS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BUDGET\r\n\r\nThe precise date at which Mr. Gladstone became a Liberal cannot be\r\ndetermined, but during the Parliamentary sessions of 1851 and 1852 he\r\nbecame finally alienated from the Conservative party, although he did\r\nnot enter the ranks of the Liberals for some years afterward. He himself\r\nstated that so late as 1851 he had not formally left the Tory party,\r\nnevertheless his advance towards Liberalism is very pronounced at this\r\nperiod. It is well for us to trace the important events of these two\r\nsessions, for they also lead up to the brilliant financial measures of\r\n1853, which caused Mr. Gladstone's name to be classed with those of Pitt\r\nand Peel. Mr. Gladstone's trusted leader was dead, and he was gradually\r\ncoming forward to take the place in debate of the fallen statesman.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone returned home from Italy he found England convulsed\r\nover renewed papal aggressions. The Pope had, in the preceding\r\nSeptember, issued Letters Apostolic, establishing a Roman Catholic\r\nHierarchy in England, and in which he had mapped out the whole country\r\ninto papal dioceses. This act of aggression produced a storm of public\r\nindignation. It was regarded by the people generally as an attempt to\r\nwrest from them their liberties and enslave them. It was looked upon by\r\nthe Protestants indignantly as an attack upon the Reformed Faith.\r\nAnglicans resented it as an act which practically denied the\r\njurisdiction and authority of the Church of England, established already\r\nby law. Englishmen, faithfully devoted to the British Constitution,\r\nwhich guaranteed the Protestant Religion, were incensed by this\r\ninterference with the prerogative of the Crown; while all ardent\r\npatriots were influenced by the unwarranted and unsolicited interference\r\nof a foreign potentate. Every element of combustion being present,\r\nmeetings were held everywhere, inflammatory speeches were made on every\r\npublic occasion, and patriotic resolutions were passed. Pulpit and\r\nplatform rang with repeated cries of \"No Popery,\" and echoed at the Lord\r\nMayor's banquet, at the Guildhall, and even at Covent Garden Theatre in\r\nShakesperian strains. The Prime Minister, Lord John Russell, published\r\nhis famous Durham letter, addressed to the Bishop of Durham, rebuking\r\nand defying the Pope, and charging the whole High Church Party of the\r\nChurch of England with being the secret allies and fellow-workers\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the Parliamentary session of 1851 Lord John Russell\r\nmoved for permission to bring in a bill to counteract the aggressive\r\npolicy of the Church of Rome, on account of which aggression of the Pope\r\nthe whole country was well-nigh in a condition of panic. The measure was\r\ndebated for four days, and was entitled the Ecclesiastical Faiths Bill.\r\nIt was designed to prevent the assumption by Roman Catholic prelates of\r\ntitles taken from any territory or place in England. Severe penalties\r\nwere attached to the use of such titles, and all acts done by, and\r\nrequests made to, persons under them were to be void. The bill was not\r\nwell received by some, being thought, on one side too mild and on the\r\nother as too stringent. Mr. Disraeli and Mr. Gladstone both opposed it;\r\nthe latter because the change was wanted by English Catholics rather\r\nthan by the Vatican. He condemned the vanity and boastful spirit of the\r\npapal documents, but contended that his fellow Catholic countrymen\r\nshould not suffer for that. The difficulty of applying it to Ireland,\r\nwhere the system objected to already existed, was pointed out. However\r\nthe preliminary motion was passed by 395 votes against 63, \"this\r\nenormous majority,\" says an English author, \"attesting the wide-spread\r\nfear of Romish machinations.\" The measure became a law, but it was a\r\ndead letter, and was quietly repealed twenty years afterwards at Mr.\r\nGladstone's request.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, the bill was passed a ministerial crisis had\r\nintervened. During this session other difficulties were encountered by\r\nthe Ministry. The financial as well as this ecclesiastical question was\r\na problem. The Conservatives were strong and compact, and enjoyed the\r\nadhesion of the Peelites, while the Ministerial party was to a great\r\nextent demoralized. Mr. Disraeli, owing to the deep distress that\r\nprevailed in the agricultural districts, renewed his motion upon the\r\nburdens on land and the inequalities of taxation, and consequently he\r\npresented a resolution that it was the duty of the government to\r\nintroduce measures for the alleviation of the distress without delay.\r\nThe government admitted the distress, but denied that it was increasing.\r\nThey attempted to prove that pauperism had decreased in all parts of the\r\nkingdom--England, Ireland and Scotland. Commerce was in a most\r\nprosperous condition, while the revenues had reached the unexampled\r\namount of $350,000,000. \"Sir James Graham stigmatized the motion as an\r\nattempt to turn out the administration, to dissolve Parliament, and to\r\nreturn to Protection.\" The Ministry was sustained by a small majority,\r\nand was successful in some measures, but soon suffered several minor\r\ndefeats and finally was forced to retire.\r\n\r\nOne of the successful measures was that introduced by Mr. Loche King,\r\nand opposed by Lord John Russell, for assimilating the country franchise\r\nto that of the boroughs. The budget of the government introduced January\r\n17th was unpopular. It demanded a renewed lease for three years of the\r\nobnoxious income-tax, but promised a partial remission of the window\r\nduties, which was a tax upon every window in a house, together with some\r\nrelief to the agriculturists. The first budget having been rejected a\r\nsecond financial statement was offered later in the session. It imposed\r\na house-tax, withdrew the bonus to agriculturists, repealed the\r\nwindow-tax, but re-demanded the income-tax for three years. The main\r\nfeatures of the budget were acceptable to the House, but the Government\r\nsuffered defeat on minor financial questions, which tendered still\r\nfurther to diminish the popularity of the ministry.\r\n\r\nUpon the resignation of Lord John Russell and his Cabinet, in February,\r\n1851, Lord Stanley was called upon to form a new administration, and Mr.\r\nGladstone was invited to become a member of the Cabinet. Lord Stanley\r\nhaving failed, Lord Aberdeen was invited to form a new Cabinet, by the\r\nQueen, with like results. Both these gentlemen having declined the task\r\nof forming a new administration, Lord John Russell and his colleagues\r\nresumed office, but the reconstructed ministry was soon to receive a\r\nfatal blow through Lord Palmerston, the foreign Secretary.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of December, 1851, Louis Napoleon, Prince President of the\r\nFrench Republic, by a single act of lawless violence, abolished the\r\nconstitution, and made himself Dictator. The details of this monstrous\r\ndeed, and of the bloodshed that accompanied it, created a profound\r\nsensation in England. The Queen was very anxious that no step should be\r\ntaken and no word said by her ministry which could be construed into an\r\napproval by the English government of what had been done. Indeed the\r\nQueen who knew the failing of her Foreign Secretary to act hastily in\r\nimportant matters of State without the consent or advice of Queen or\r\nCabinet, questioned the Premier and was assured that nothing had been\r\ndone in recognition of the new government in Paris. Indeed the Cabinet\r\nhad passed a resolution to abstain from the expression of opinions in\r\napproval or disapproval of the recent _coup d'état_ in France. But it\r\nsoon leaked out that Lord Palmerston who thought he understood full well\r\nthe foreign relations of England, and what her policy should be, had\r\nboth in public dispatches and private conversation spoken favorably of\r\nthe policy adopted by Louis Napoleon. He had even expressed to Count\r\nWalewski, the French Ambassador in London, his entire approval of the\r\nPrince President's act. This was too much for the Queen, who had as\r\nearly as the August before, in a memorandum sent to the Premier,\r\nimperatively protested against the crown's being ignored by the Foreign\r\nSecretary, so Lord Palmerston was dismissed from office by Lord John\r\nRussell, Christmas Eve, 1851. He bore his discharge with meekness, and\r\neven omitted in Parliament to defend himself in points where he was\r\nwronged. But Justin McCarthy says: \"Lord Palmerston was in the wrong in\r\nmany if not most of the controversies which had preceded it; that is to\r\nsay, he was wrong in committing England as he so often did to measures\r\nwhich had not the approval of the sovereign or his colleagues.\"\r\n\r\nIn February following, 1852, Lord Palmerston enjoyed, as he expressed\r\nit, his \"tit-for-tat with Johnny Russell\" and helped the Tories to\r\ndefeat his late chief in a measure for reorganizing the militia as a\r\nprecaution against possible aggression from France. The ministry had not\r\nsaved itself by the overthrow of Lord Palmerston.\r\n\r\nUpon the retirement of Lord John Russell from office, in 1852, the Earl\r\nof Derby, formerly Lord Stanley, succeeded him as Prime Minister. Mr.\r\nGladstone was invited to become a member of the new Tory Cabinet, but\r\ndeclined, whereupon Lord Malmesbury dubiously remarked, November 28th:\r\n\"I cannot make out Gladstone, who seems to me a dark horse.\" Mr.\r\nDisraeli was chosen Chancellor of the Exchequer, and became Leader in\r\nthe House of Commons, entering the Cabinet for the first time. \"There\r\nwas a scarcely disguised intention to revive protection.\" It was Free\r\nTrade or Protection, and the Peelites defended their fallen leader,\r\nPeel. \"A makeshift budget\" was introduced by Mr. Disraeli and passed. It\r\nwas destined, it seems, that the Derby Administration was not to be\r\nsupported, but to be driven out of power by Mr. Gladstone, who was to\r\ncross swords before the nation with his future parliamentary\r\nrival, Disraeli.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli seemed now bent upon declaring the Free Trade Policy of Sir\r\nRobert Peel a failure. Mr. Disraeli's power of forgetfulness of the past\r\nis one of the most fortunate ever conferred upon a statesman. During the\r\ndebate he declared that the main reason why his party had opposed Free\r\nTrade was not that it would injure the landlord, nor the farmer, but\r\nthat \"it would prove injurious to the cause of labor.\" \"He also said,\r\nthough interrupted by cries of astonishment and of 'Oh, oh!' that not a\r\nsingle attempt had been made in the House of Commons to abrogate the\r\nmeasure of 1846.\" Mr. Sidney Herbert, who was wounded to the quick by\r\nthe assaults on Sir Robert Peel, rose to defend the great Conservative\r\nstatesman. His speech contained one passage of scathing invective\r\naddressed to Mr. Disraeli.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert said: \"The memory of Sir Robert Peel requires no\r\nvindication--his memory is embalmed in the grateful recollection of the\r\npeople of this country; and I say, if ever retribution is wanted--for it\r\nis not words that humiliate, but deeds--if a man wants to see\r\nhumiliation, which God knows is always a painful sight, he need but look\r\nthere!\"--and upon this Mr. Herbert pointed with his finger to Mr.\r\nDisraeli sitting on the Treasury Bench. The sting of invective is truth,\r\nand Mr. Herbert certainly spoke daggers if he used none; yet the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer sat impassive as a Sphinx.\r\n\r\nParliament was dissolved soon after the formation of the new government,\r\nJuly 1, 1852, and during the recess, September 14, 1852, the Duke of\r\nWellington passed away and a public funeral was given the victor\r\nof Waterloo.\r\n\r\nOn the assembling of Parliament Mr. Gladstone delivered a eulogy on the\r\nDuke, drawing special lessons from his illustrious career, which had\r\nbeen prolonged to a green old age. Mr. Gladstone said: \"While many of\r\nthe actions of his life, while many of the qualities he possessed, are\r\nunattainable by others, there are lessons which we may all derive from\r\nthe life and actions of that illustrious man. It may never be given to\r\nanother subject of the British Crown to perform services so brilliant as\r\nhe performed; it may never be given to another man to hold the sword\r\nwhich was to gain the independence of Europe, to rally the nations\r\naround it, and while England saved herself by her constancy, to save\r\nEurope by her example; it may never be given to another man, after\r\nhaving attained such eminence, after such an unexampled series of\r\nvictories, to show equal moderation in peace as he has shown greatness\r\nin war, and to devote the remainder of his life to the cause of internal\r\nand external peace for that country which he has so well served; it may\r\nnever be given to another man to have equal authority, both with the\r\nSovereign he served and with the Senate of which he was to the end a\r\nvenerated member; it may never be given to another man after such a\r\ncareer to preserve, even to the last, the full possession of those great\r\nfaculties with which he was endowed, and to carry on the services of one\r\nof the most important departments of the State with unexampled\r\nregularity and success, even to the latest day of his life. These are\r\ncircumstances, these are qualities, which may never occur again in the\r\nhistory of this country. But these are qualities which the Duke of\r\nWellington displayed, of which we may all act in humble imitation: that\r\nsincere and unceasing devotion to our country; that honest and upright\r\ndetermination to act for the benefit of the country on every occasion;\r\nthat devoted loyalty, which, while it made him ever anxious to serve the\r\nCrown, never induced him to conceal from the Sovereign that which he\r\nbelieved to be the truth; that devotedness in the constant performance\r\nof duty; that temperance of his life, which enabled him at all times to\r\ngive his mind and his faculties to the services which he was called on\r\nto perform; that regular, consistent, and unceasing piety by which he\r\nwas distinguished at all times of his life; these are qualities that are\r\nattainable by others, and these are qualities which should not be lost\r\nas an example.\"\r\n\r\nAt this session of Parliament Mr. Disraeli brought forward his second\r\nbudget in a five hour speech. The new Chancellor of the Exchequer\r\nproposed to remit a portion of the taxes upon malt, tea, and sugar, but\r\nto counterbalance these losses he also proposed to extend the income-tax\r\nand house-tax. The debate, which was very personal, was prolonged\r\nseveral days, and Mr. Disraeli, towards its close, bitterly attacked\r\nseveral members, among them Sir James Graham, whom Mr. Gladstone not\r\nonly defended, but in so doing administered a scathing rebuke to the\r\nChancellor for his bitter invective and personal abuse. Mr. Gladstone's\r\nspeech at the close of Mr. Disraeli's presentation was crushing, and was\r\ngenerally regarded as giving the death-blow to this financial scheme.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone told Mr. Disraeli that he was not entitled to charge with\r\ninsolence men of as high position and of as high character in the House\r\nas himself, and when the cheers which had interrupted him had subsided,\r\nconcluded: \"I must tell the right honorable gentleman that he is not\r\nentitled to say to my right honorable friend, the member for Carlisle,\r\nthat he regards but does not respect him. And I must tell him that\r\nwhatever else he has learnt--and he has learnt much--he has not learnt\r\nto keep within those limits of discretion, of moderation, and of\r\nforbearance that ought to restrain the conduct and language of every\r\nmember in this House, the disregard of which, while it is an offence in\r\nthe meanest amongst us, is an offence of tenfold weight when committed\r\nby the leader of the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\nThe thrilling scene enacted in the House of Commons on that memorable\r\nnight is thus described: \"In the following month the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer produced his second budget. It was an ambitious and a skillful\r\nattempt to reconcile conflicting interests, and to please all while\r\noffending none. The government had come into office pledged to do\r\nsomething for the relief of the agricultural interests. They redeemed\r\ntheir pledge by reducing the duty on malt. This reduction created a\r\ndeficit; and they repaired the deficit by doubling the duty on inhabited\r\nhouses. Unluckily, the agricultural interests proved, as usual,\r\nungrateful to its benefactors, and made light of the reduction on malt;\r\nwhile those who were to pay for it in double taxation were naturally\r\nindignant. The voices of criticism, 'angry, loud, discordant voices,'\r\nwere heard simultaneously on every side. The debate waxed fast and\r\nfurious. In defending his hopeless proposals, Mr. Disraeli gave full\r\nscope to his most characteristic gift; he pelted his opponents right and\r\nleft with sarcasms, taunts, and epigrams, and went as near personal\r\ninsult as the forms of Parliament permit. He sat down late at night, and\r\nMr. Gladstone rose in a crowded and excited House to deliver an\r\nunpremeditated reply which has ever since been celebrated. Even the cold\r\nand colorless pages of 'Hansard' show signs of the excitement under\r\nwhich he labored, and of the tumultuous applause and dissent by which\r\nhis opening sentences were interrupted. 'The speech of the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer,' he said, 'must be answered on the moment. It must be\r\ntried by the laws of decency and propriety.'\" He indignantly rebuked his\r\nrival's language and demeanor. He reminded him of the discretion and\r\ndecorum due from every member, but pre-eminently due from the leader of\r\nthe House. He tore his financial scheme to ribbons. It was the beginning\r\nof a duel which lasted till death removed one of the combatants from the\r\npolitical arena. 'Those who had thought it impossible that any\r\nimpression could be made upon the House after the speech of Mr.\r\nDisraeli had to acknowledge that a yet greater impression was produced\r\nby the unprepared reply of Mr. Gladstone.' The House divided and the\r\ngovernment were left in a minority of nineteen. This happened in the\r\nearly morning of December 17, 1852. Within an hour of the division Lord\r\nDerby wrote to the Queen a letter announcing his defeat and the\r\nconsequences which it must entail, and that evening at Osborne he placed\r\nhis formal resignation in her majesty's hands.\r\n\r\nIt is related as an evidence of the intense excitement, if not frenzy,\r\nthat prevailed at the time, that Mr. Gladstone met with indignity at his\r\nClub. Greville, in his \"Memoirs,\" says that, \"twenty ruffians of the\r\nCarleton Club\" had given a dinner to Major Beresford, who had been\r\ncharged with bribery at the Derby election and had escaped with only a\r\ncensure, and that \"after dinner, when they were drunk, they went up\r\nstairs and finding Mr. Gladstone alone in the drawing-room, some of them\r\nproposed to throw him out of the window. This they did not quite dare to\r\ndo, but contented themselves with giving some insulting message or order\r\nto the waiter and then went away.\" Mr. Gladstone, however, remained a\r\nmember of the Club until he joined the Whig administration in 1859.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's crushing _exposé_ of the blunders of Mr. Disraeli's\r\nbudget was almost ludicrous in its completeness, and it was universally\r\nfelt that the scheme could not survive his brilliant attack. The effect\r\nthat the merciless criticism of Disraeli's budget was not only the\r\ndiscomfiture of Mr. Disraeli and the overthrow of the Russell\r\nadministration, but the elevation of Mr. Gladstone to the place vacated\r\nby Chancellor Disraeli.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Aberdeen became Prime Minister. The new government was a\r\ncoalition of Whigs and Peelites, with a representative of the Radicals\r\nin the person of Sir William Molesworth. Mr. Gladstone, the Duke of\r\nNewcastle, Sir James Graham and Mr. Sidney Herbert were the Peelites in\r\nthe Cabinet. Mr. Gladstone was chosen Chancellor of the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nWe may refer here to a letter of Mr. Gladstone, written Christmas, 1851,\r\nin order to show his growing Liberalism. The letter was to Dr. Skinner,\r\nBishop of Aberdeen and Primus, on the positions and functions of the\r\nlaity in the Church. This letter is remarkable, because, as Dr. Charles\r\nWordsworth, Bishop of St. Andrew's, said at the time, \"it contained the\r\ngerm of liberation and the political equality of all religions.\" The\r\nBishop published a controversial rejoinder, which drew from Dr.\r\nGaisford, Dean of Christ Church, these emphatic words: \"You have proved\r\nto my satisfaction that this gentleman is unfit to represent the\r\nUniversity,\" meaning the representation for Oxford in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis feeling was growing, for when the Russell Ministry fell and it\r\nbecame necessary for Mr. Gladstone, because he accepted a place in the\r\nCabinet, to appeal for re-election to his constituents at Oxford, he met\r\nwith much opposition, because of his Liberalism. Appealing to his\r\nuniversity to return him, and endorse his acceptance of office in the\r\nnew Ministry of the Earl of Aberdeen, Mr. Gladstone soon discovered that\r\nhe had made many enemies by his manifest tendencies toward\r\nLiberal-Conservatism. He had given unmistakable evidence that he held\r\nless firmly the old traditions of that unbending Toryism of which he was\r\nonce the most promising representative. Lord Derby, whom he had deposed,\r\nhad been elected Chancellor of the University to succeed the Duke of\r\nWellington, deceased. Consequently his return to the House was ardently\r\ncontested. His opponents looked around for a candidate of strong\r\nConservative principles. The Marquis of Chandos, who was first elected,\r\ndeclined to run in opposition to Mr. Gladstone; but at length a suitable\r\nopponent was found in Mr. Dudley Perceval, of Christ Church, son of the\r\nRight Hon. Spencer Perceval, who was nominated January 4th.\r\n\r\nDr. Hawkins, Provost of Oriel, one of the twenty colleges of Oxford,\r\nproposed Mr. Gladstone, and Archdeacon Denison, leader of the High\r\nChurch party, proposed Mr. Dudley Perceval. According to the custom at\r\nuniversity elections, neither candidate was present. It was objected to\r\nMr. Gladstone that he had voted improperly on ecclesiastical questions,\r\nand had accepted office in \"a hybrid ministry.\" The \"Times\" described\r\nMr. Perceval as \"a very near relative of our old friend Mrs. Harris. To\r\nremove any doubt on this point, let him be exhibited at Exeter Hall with\r\nthe documentary evidence of his name, existence and history; his\r\nfirst-class, his defeat at Finsbury, his talents, his principles. If we\r\nmust go to Oxford to record our votes it would at least be something to\r\nknow that we were voting against a real man and not a mere name.\" The\r\n\"Morning Chronicle,\" on the other hand, affirmed that a section of the\r\nCarleton Club were \"making a tool of the Oxford Convocation for the\r\npurpose of the meanest and smallest political rancor against Mr.\r\nGladstone.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, who fought the battle on ecclesiastical lines, wrote,\r\nafter the nomination, to the chairman of his election committee,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"Unless I had a full and clear conviction that the interests of the\r\nChurch, whether as relates to the legislative functions of Parliament,\r\nor the impartial and wise recommendation of fit persons to her majesty\r\nfor high ecclesiastical offices, were at least as safe in the hands of\r\nLord Aberdeen as in those of Lord Derby (though I would on no account\r\ndisparage Lord Derby's personal sentiments towards the Church), I should\r\nnot have accepted office under Lord Aberdeen. As regards the second, if\r\nit be thought that during twenty years of public life, or that during\r\nthe latter part of them, I have failed to give guarantees of attachment\r\nto the interests of the Church--to such as so think I can offer neither\r\napology nor pledge. To those who think otherwise, I tender the assurance\r\nthat I have not by my recent assumption of office made any change\r\nwhatever in that particular, or in any principles relating to it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was again elected by a fair majority and returned to\r\nParliament. Seventy-four of the professors voted for Mr. Gladstone and\r\nfifteen for Mr. Perceval.\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament assembled the Earl of Aberdeen announced in the House of\r\nLords that the measures of the Government would be both Conservative and\r\nLiberal,--at home to maintain Free Trade principles and to pursue the\r\ncommercial and financial system of the late Sir Robert Peel, and abroad\r\nto secure the general peace of Europe without relaxing defensive\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone had already proved himself to have a wonderful mastery of\r\nfigures, and the confused technicalities of finance. He did not\r\ndisappoint the hopes of his friends in regard to his fiscal abilities.\r\nOn the contrary, he speedily inaugurated a new and brilliant era in\r\nfinance. Previous to presenting his first budget, in 1853, Mr. Gladstone\r\nbrought forward a scheme for the reduction of the national debt, which\r\nwas approved by Radicals as well as Conservatives, and adopted by the\r\nHouse. The scheme worked most successfully until the breaking out of the\r\nCrimean war. During this very short period of two years the public debt\r\nwas reduced by more than $57,500,000.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of his general reputation and also of this brilliant\r\nfinancial scheme, the first budget of Mr. Gladstone was waited for with\r\nintense interest. His first budget was introduced April 18, 1853. It was\r\none of his greatest budgets, and for statesmanlike breadth of conception\r\nit has never been surpassed. In bringing it forward Mr. Gladstone spoke\r\nfive hours, and during that length of time held the House spellbound.\r\nThe speech was delivered with the greatest ease, and was perspicuity\r\nitself throughout. Even when dealing with the most abstruse financial\r\ndetail his language flowed on without interruption, and he never paused\r\nfor a word. \"Here was an orator who could apply all the resources of a\r\nburnished rhetoric to the elucidation of figures; who could make pippins\r\nand cheese interesting and tea serious; who could sweep the widest\r\nhorizon of the financial future and yet stoop to bestow the minutest\r\nattention on the microcosm of penny stamps and post-horses. The members\r\non the floor and ladies in the gallery of the House listened attentively\r\nand showed no signs of weariness throughout.\" A contemporary awarded to\r\nhim the palm for unsurpassed fluency and choice of diction, and says:\r\n\r\n\"The impression produced upon the minds of the crowded and brilliant\r\nassembly by Mr. Gladstone's evident mastery and grasp of the subject,\r\nwas, that England had at length found a skillful financier, upon whom\r\nthe mantle of Peel had descended. The cheering when the right honorable\r\ngentleman sat down was of the most enthusiastic and prolonged character,\r\nand his friends and colleagues hastened to tender him their warm\r\ncongratulations upon the distinguished success he had achieved in his\r\nfirst budget.\"\r\n\r\nThe budget provided for the gradual reduction of the income tax to\r\nexpire in 1860; for an increase in the duty on spirits; for the\r\nabolition of the soap duties; the reduction of the tax on cabs and\r\nhackney coaches; the introduction of the penny receipt stamp and the\r\nequalization of the assessed taxes on property. By these provisions it\r\nwas proposed to make life easier and cheaper for large and numerous\r\nclasses. The duty on 123 articles was abolished and the duty on 133\r\nothers reduced, the total relief amounting to $25,000,000. Mr. Gladstone\r\ngave a clear exposition of the income tax, which he declared was never\r\nintended to be permanent. It had been the last resort in times of\r\nnational danger, and he could not consent to retain it as a part of the\r\npermanent and ordinary finances of the country. It was objectionable on\r\naccount of its unequal incidence, of the harassing investigation into\r\nprivate affairs which it entailed and of the frauds to which it\r\ninevitably led.\r\n\r\nThe value of the reduction in the necessities of life proposed by Mr.\r\nGladstone is seen from the following from a contemporary writer:\r\n\r\n\"The present budget, more than any other budget within our recollection,\r\nis a cupboard budget; otherwise, a poor man's budget. With certain very\r\nugly features, the thing has altogether a good, hopeful aspect, together\r\nwith very fair proportions. It is not given to any Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer to make a budget fascinating as a fairy tale. Nevertheless,\r\nthere are visions of wealth and comfort in the present budget that\r\nmightily recommend it to us. It seems to add color and fatness to the\r\npoor man's beef; to give flavor and richness to the poor man's\r\nplum-pudding. The budget is essentially a cupboard budget; and let the\r\nname of Gladstone be, for the time at least, musical at the poor man's\r\nfireside.\"\r\n\r\nIt unquestionably established Gladstone as the foremost financier of\r\nhis day. Greville, in his \"Memoirs,\" says of him: \"He spoke for five\r\nhours; and by universal consent it was one of the grandest displays and\r\nmost able financial statements that ever was heard in the House of\r\nCommons; a great scheme, boldly and skillfully and honestly devised,\r\ndisdaining popular clamor and pressure from without, and the execution\r\nof its absolute perfection.\"\r\n\r\nWe reproduce some extracts from this important speech: \"Depend upon it,\r\nwhen you come to close quarters with this subject, when you come to\r\nmeasure and test the respective relations of intelligence and labor and\r\nproperty in all their myriad and complex forms, and when you come to\r\nrepresent those relations in arithmetical results, you are undertaking\r\nan operation of which I should say it was beyond the power of man to\r\nconduct it with satisfaction, but which, at any rate, is an operation to\r\nwhich you ought not constantly to recur; for if, as my noble friend once\r\nsaid with universal applause, this country could not bear a revolution\r\nonce a year, I will venture to say that it cannot bear a reconstruction\r\nof the income tax once a year.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you do in regard to the income tax, you must be bold, you must\r\nbe intelligible, you must be decisive. You must not palter with it. If\r\nyou do, I have striven at least to point out as well as my feeble\r\npowers will permit, the almost desecration I would say, certainly the\r\ngross breach of duty to your country, of which you will be found guilty,\r\nin thus putting to hazard one of the most potent and effective among all\r\nits material resources. I believe it to be of vital importance, whether\r\nyou keep this tax or whether you part with it, that you should either\r\nkeep it or should leave it in a state in which it will be fit for\r\nservice on an emergency, and that it will be impossible to do if you\r\nbreak up the basis of your income tax.\r\n\r\n\"If the Committee have followed me, they will understand that we found\r\nourselves on the principle that the income-tax ought to be marked as a\r\ntemporary measure; that the public feeling that relief should be given\r\nto intelligence and skill as compared with property ought to be met, and\r\nmay be met with justice and with safety, in the manner we have pointed\r\nout; that the income tax in its operation ought to be mitigated by every\r\nrational means, compatible with its integrity; and, above all, that it\r\nshould be associated in the last term of its existence, as it was in the\r\nfirst, with those remissions of indirect taxation which have so greatly\r\nredoubled to the profit of this country and have set so admirable an\r\nexample--an example that has already in some quarters proved contagious\r\nto the other nations of the earth, These are the principles on which we\r\nstand, and these the figures. I have shown you that if you grant us the\r\ntaxes which we ask, to the moderate amount of £2,500,000 in the whole,\r\nmuch less than that sum for the present year, you, or the Parliament\r\nwhich may be in existence in 1860, will be in the condition, if it shall\r\nso think fit, to part with the income tax.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I scarcely dare to look at the clock, shamefully reminding me, as\r\nit must, how long, how shamelessly, I have trespassed on the time of the\r\ncommittee. All I can say in apology is that I have endeavored to keep\r\nclosely to the topics which I had before me--\r\n\r\n          --immensum spatiis confecimus aequor,\r\n     Et jam tempus equum fumantia solvere colla.\r\n\r\n\"These are the proposals of the Government. They may be approved or they\r\nmay be condemned, but I have at least this full and undoubting\r\nconfidence, that it will on all hands be admitted that we have not\r\nsought to evade the difficulties of our position; that we have not\r\nconcealed those difficulties, either from ourselves or from others; that\r\nwe have not attempted to counteract them by narrow or flimsy expedients;\r\nthat we have prepared plans which, if you will adopt them, will go some\r\nway to close up many vexed financial questions--questions such as, if\r\nnot now settled, may be attended with public inconvenience, and even\r\nwith public danger, in future years and under less favorable\r\ncircumstances; that we have endeavored, in the plans we have now\r\nsubmitted to you, to make the path of our successors in future years not\r\nmore arduous but more easy; and I may be permitted to add that, while we\r\nhave sought to do justice, by the changes we propose in taxation, to\r\nintelligence and skill as compared with property--while we have sought\r\nto do justice to the great laboring community of England by furthering\r\ntheir relief from indirect taxation, we have not been guided by any\r\ndesire to put one class against another. We have felt we should best\r\nmaintain our own honor, that we should best meet the views of\r\nParliament, and best promote the interests of the country, by declining\r\nto draw any invidious distinctions between class and class, by adapting\r\nit to ourselves as a sacred aim to differ and distribute--burden if we\r\nmust, benefit if we may--with equal and impartial hand; and we have the\r\nconsolation of believing that by proposals such as these we contribute,\r\nas far as in us lies, not only to develop the material resources of the\r\ncountry, but to knit the hearts of the various classes of this great\r\nnation yet more closely than heretofore to that throne and to those\r\ninstitutions under which it is their happiness to live.\"\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that a venture of such magnitude as Mr. Gladstone's first\r\nbudget meets with universal success. But from the outset the plan was\r\nreceived with universal favor. Besides the plaudits with which the\r\norator was greeted at the conclusion of his speech, his proposals were\r\nreceived favorably by the whole nation. Being constructed upon Free\r\nTrade principles, it was welcomed by the press and the country. It added\r\ngreatly, not only to the growing reputation of the new Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer as a financier, but also to his popularity.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote of Mr. Gladstone is told by Walter Jerrold and is\r\nappropriate as well as timely here:\r\n\r\n\"During Mr. Gladstone's first tenure of office as Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer, a curious adventure occurred to him in the London offices of\r\nthe late Mr. W. Lindsay, merchant, shipowner and M.P. There one day\r\nentered a brusque and wealthy shipowner of Sunderland, inquiring for Mr.\r\nLindsay. As Mr. Lindsay was out, the visitor was requested to wait in an\r\nadjacent room, where he found a person busily engaged in copying some\r\nfigures. The Sunderland shipowner paced the room several times and took\r\ncareful note of the writer's doings, and at length said to him, 'Thou\r\nwrites a bonny hand, thou dost.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am glad you think so,' was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, thou dost. Thou makes thy figures weel. Thou'rt just the chap I\r\nwant.'\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed!' said the Londoner.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, indeed,' said the Sunderland man. 'I'm a man of few words. Noo,\r\nif thou'lt come over to canny ould Sunderland thou seest I'll give thee\r\na hundred and twenty pounds a year, and that's a plum thou dost not meet\r\nwith every day in thy life, I reckon. Noo then.'\r\n\r\n\"The Londoner replied that he was much obliged for the offer, and would\r\nwait till Mr. Lindsay returned, whom he would consult upon the subject.\r\nAccordingly, on the return of the latter, he was informed of the\r\nshipowner's tempting offer.\r\n\r\n\"'Very well,' said Mr. Lindsay, 'I should be sorry to stand in your way.\r\nOne hundred and twenty pounds is more than I can afford to pay you in\r\nthe department in which you are at present placed. You will find my\r\nfriend a good and kind master, and, under the circumstances, the sooner\r\nyou know each other the better. Allow me, therefore, Mr.----, to\r\nintroduce you to the Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone, Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer.' The Sunderland shipowner was a little taken aback at first,\r\nbut he soon recovered his self-possession, and enjoyed the joke quite as\r\nmuch as Mr. Gladstone did.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRIMEAN WAR\r\n\r\nThe Crimean War, the great event with which the Aberdeen Cabinet was\r\nassociated, was a contest between Russia and Turkey, England and France.\r\nA dispute which arose between Russia and Turkey as to the possession of\r\nthe Holy Places of Jerusalem was the precipitating cause. For a long\r\ntime the Greek and the Latin Churches had contended for the possession\r\nof the Holy Land. Russia supported the claim of the Greek Church, and\r\nFrance that of the Papal Church. The Czar claimed a Protectorate over\r\nall the Greek subjects of the Porte. Russia sought to extend her\r\nconquests south and to seize upon Turkey. France and England sustained\r\nTurkey. Sardinia afterwards joined the Anglo-French alliance.\r\n\r\nThe people of England generally favored the war, and evinced much\r\nenthusiasm at the prospect of it. Lord Aberdeen and Mr. Gladstone wished\r\nEngland to stand aloof. The Peelite members of the cabinet were\r\ngenerally less inclined to war than the Whigs. Lord Palmerston and Lord\r\nJohn Russell favored England's support of Turkey. Some thought that\r\nEngland could have averted the war by pursuing persistently either of\r\ntwo courses: to inform Turkey that England would give her no aid; or to\r\nwarn Russia that if she went to war, England would fight for Turkey. But\r\nwith a ministry halting between two opinions, and the people demanding\r\nit, England \"drifted into war\" with Russia.\r\n\r\nJuly 2, 1853, the Russian troops crossed the Pruth and occupied the\r\nDanubian Principalities which had been by treaty, in 1849, evacuated by\r\nTurkey and Russia, and declared by both powers neutral territory between\r\nthem. London was startled, October 4, 1853, by a telegram announcing\r\nthat the Sultan had declared war against Russia. England and France\r\njointly sent an _ultimatum_ to the Czar, to which no answer was\r\nreturned. March 28, 1854, England declared war.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March, while great excitement prevailed and public\r\nmeetings were held throughout England, declaring for and against war,\r\nMr. Gladstone made an address on the occasion of the inauguration of the\r\nstatue of Sir Robert Peel, at Manchester. He spoke of the designs of\r\nRussia, and described her as a power which threatened to override all\r\nother powers, and as a source of danger to the peace of the world.\r\nAgainst such designs, seen in Russia's attempt to overthrow the Ottoman\r\nEmpire, England had determined to set herself at whatever cost. War was\r\na calamity that the government did not desire to bring upon the country,\r\n\"a calamity which stained the face of nature with human gore, gave loose\r\nrein to crime, and took bread from the people. No doubt negotiation is\r\nrepugnant to the national impatience at the sight of injustice and\r\noppression; it is beset with delay, intrigue, and chicane; but these are\r\nnot so horrible as war, if negotiation can be made to result in saving\r\nthis country from a calamity which deprives the nation of subsistence\r\nand arrests the operations of industry. To attain that result ... Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers have persevered in exercising that self-command and\r\nthat self-restraint which impatience may mistake for indifference,\r\nfeebleness or cowardice, but which are truly the crowning greatness of a\r\ngreat people, and which do not evince the want of readiness to\r\nvindicate, when the time comes, the honor of this country.\"\r\n\r\nIn November a conference of some of the European powers was held at\r\nVienna to avert the war by mediating between Russia and Turkey, but was\r\nunsuccessful. Mr. Gladstone said: \"Austria urged the two leading\r\nstates, England and France, to send in their _ultimatum_ to Russia, and\r\npromised it her decided support.... Prussia at the critical moment, to\r\nspeak in homely language, bolted.... In fact, she broke up the European\r\nconcert, by which France and England had hoped to pull down the\r\nstubbornness of the Czar.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone had opposed the war, not only on humanitarian and\r\nChristian grounds, but also because the preparation of a war budget\r\noverthrew all his financial schemes and hopes; a new budget was\r\nnecessary, and he as Chancellor of the Exchequer must prepare it.\r\nKnowing that the struggle was inevitable, he therefore bent his energies\r\nto the task and conceived a scheme for discharging the expenses of the\r\nwar out of the current revenue, provided it required no more than ten\r\nmillion pounds extra, so that the country should not be permanently\r\nburdened. It would require to do this the imposition of fresh taxes.\r\n\r\n\"It thus fell to the lot of the most pacific of Ministers, the devotee\r\nof retrenchment, and the anxious cultivator of all industrial arts, to\r\nprepare a war budget, and to meet as well as he might the exigencies of\r\na conflict which had so cruelly dislocated all the ingenious devices of\r\nfinancial optimism.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone afterwards moved for over six and a half millions of\r\npounds more than already granted, and proposed a further increase in the\r\ntaxes. Mr. Disraeli opposed Mr. Gladstone's budget. He devised a scheme\r\nto borrow and thus increase the debt. He opposed the imposition of new\r\ntaxes. Mr. Gladstone said: \"Every good motive and every bad motive,\r\ncombated only by the desire of the approval of honorable men and by\r\nconscientious rectitude--every motive of ease, comfort, and of certainty\r\nspring forward to induce a Chancellor of the Exchequer to become the\r\nfirst man to recommend a loan.\" Mr. Gladstone was sustained.\r\n\r\nThe war had begun in earnest. The Duke of Newcastle received a telegram\r\non the 21st of September announcing that 25,000 English troops, 25,000\r\nFrench and 8000 Turks had landed safely at Eupatoria \"without meeting\r\nwith any resistance, and had already begun to march upon Sebastopol.\"\r\n\r\nThe war was popular with the English people, but the ministry of Lord\r\nAberdeen, which inaugurated it, was becoming unpopular. This became\r\napparent in the autumn of 1854. There were not actual dissensions in the\r\nCabinet, but there was great want of harmony as to the conduct of the\r\nwar. The Queen knew with what reluctance Lord Aberdeen had entered upon\r\nthe war, but she had the utmost confidence in him as a man and a\r\nstatesman. She was most desirous that the war be prosecuted with vigor,\r\nand trusted the Premier for the realization of her hopes and those of\r\nthe nation, but unity in the Cabinet was necessary for the successful\r\nprosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nParliament assembled December 12, 1854, \"under circumstances more\r\nstirring and momentous than any which had occurred since the year of\r\nWaterloo.\" The management of the war was the main subject under\r\ndiscussion. The English troops had covered themselves with glory in the\r\nbattles of Alma, Balaclava and Inkermann. But the sacrifice was great.\r\nThousands were slain and homes made desolate, while the British army was\r\nsuffering greatly, and the sick and wounded were needing attention. Half\r\na million pounds were subscribed in three months, and Miss Florence\r\nNightingale with thirty-seven lady nurses, soon to be reinforced by\r\nfifty more, set out at once for the seat of war to nurse the sick and\r\nwounded soldiers. It is recorded that \"they reached Scutari on the 5th\r\nof November, in time to receive the soldiers who had been wounded at the\r\nbattle of Balaclava. On the arrival of Miss Nightingale the great\r\nhospital at Scutari, in which up to this time all had been chaos and\r\ndiscomfort, was reduced to order, and those tender lenitives which only\r\nwoman's thought and woman's sympathy can bring to the sick man's couch,\r\nwere applied to solace and alleviate the agonies of pain or the torture\r\nof fever and prostration.\"\r\n\r\nIt was natural to attribute the want of proper management to the\r\nministry, and hence the Government found itself under fire. In the House\r\nof Lords the Earl of Derby condemned the inefficient manner in which the\r\nwar had been carried on, the whole conduct of the ministry in the war,\r\nand the insufficiency of the number of troops sent out to check the\r\npower of Russia. The Duke of Newcastle replied, and while not defending\r\nall the actions of the ministry during the war, yet contended that the\r\ngovernment were prepared to prosecute it with resolve and unflinching\r\nfirmness. While not standing ready to reject overtures of peace, they\r\nwould not accept any but an honorable termination of the war. The\r\nministry relied upon the army, the people, and upon their allies with\r\nthe full confidence of ultimate success.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli, in the House of Commons, attacked the policy of the\r\nministry from beginning to end. Everything was a blunder or a mishap of\r\nsome description or other; the government had invaded Russia with 25,000\r\ntroops without providing any provision for their support.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons assembled, in January, 1855, it became\r\napparent that there was a determination to sift to the bottom the\r\ncharges that had been made against the ministry regarding their manner\r\nof carrying on the war. The Queen expressed her sympathy for Lord\r\nAberdeen, who was in a most unenviable position. Motions hostile to the\r\ngovernment were introduced in the House of Lords, while in the House of\r\nCommons Mr. Roebuck moved for a select committee \"to inquire into the\r\ncondition of the army before Sebastopol, and into the conduct of those\r\ndepartments of the government whose duty it has been to minister to the\r\nwants of the army.\"\r\n\r\nLord John Russell resigned his office and left his colleagues to face\r\nthe vote. He could not see how Mr. Roebuck's motion could be resisted.\r\nThis seemed to portend the downfall of the ministry. The Duke of\r\nNewcastle, Secretary of War, offered to retire to save the government.\r\nLord Palmerston believed that the breaking up of the ministry would be a\r\ncalamity to the country, but he doubted the expediency of the retirement\r\nof the Duke of Newcastle, and his own fitness for the place of Minister\r\nof War, if vacated. Finally the Cabinet resolved to hold together,\r\nexcept Lord John Russell.\r\n\r\nIn the debate it was declared that the condition of things at the seat\r\nof war was exaggerated; but the speech of Mr. Stafford caused a great\r\nsensation. He described the sufferings which he declared he had himself\r\nwitnessed. He summed up by quoting the language of a French officer, who\r\nsaid: \"You seem, sir, to carry on war according to the system of the\r\nMiddle Ages.\" The situation of the ministry was critical before, but\r\nthis speech seemed to make sure the passage of the resolutions.\r\n\r\nIt was under all these depressing circumstances that Mr. Gladstone rose\r\nto defend himself and his colleagues. In a fine passage he thus\r\ndescribed what the position of the Cabinet would have been if they had\r\nshrunk from their duty: \"What sort of epitaph would have been written\r\nover their remains? He himself would have written it thus: Here lie the\r\ndishonored ashes of a ministry which found England at peace and left it\r\nin war, which was content to enjoy the emoluments of office and to wield\r\nthe sceptre of power so long as no man had the courage to question their\r\nexistence. They saw the storm gathering over the country; they heard the\r\nagonizing accounts which were almost daily received of the state of the\r\nsick and wounded in the East. These things did not move them. But as\r\nsoon as the Honorable Member for Sheffield raised his hand to point the\r\nthunderbolt, they became conscience-stricken with a sense of guilt, and,\r\nhoping to escape punishment, they ran away from duty.\"\r\n\r\nThis eloquent passage was received with tumultuous cheers. Mr.\r\nGladstone claimed that there had been many exaggerations as to the state\r\nof the army and there were then more than 30,000 British troops under\r\narms before Sebastopol. The administration of the War Department at home\r\nwas no doubt defective, but he declined to admit that it had not\r\nimproved, or that it was as bad as to deserve formal censure, and the\r\nDuke of Newcastle did not merit the condemnation sought to be cast on\r\nhim as the head of the War Department.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli was eagerly heard when he rose to speak. He said that the\r\ngovernment admitted that they needed reconstruction, and that now the\r\nHouse was called upon to vote confidence in the administration. It was\r\nnot the Duke of Newcastle nor the military system, but the policy of the\r\nwhole Cabinet which he characterized as a \"deplorable administration.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of the vote was a strange surprise to all parties, and one of\r\nthe greatest ever experienced in Parliamentary history. The vote for Mr.\r\nRoebuck's committee was 205; and against it, 148; a majority against the\r\nministry of 157. \"The scene was a peculiar and probably an unparalleled\r\none. The cheers which are usually heard from one side or the other of\r\nthe House on the numbers of a division being announced, were not\r\nforthcoming. The members were for a moment spellbound with\r\nastonishment, then there came a murmur of amazement and finally a burst\r\nof general laughter.\" The resignation of the Aberdeen ministry was\r\nannounced February 1st, the Duke of Newcastle stating that it had been\r\nhis intention to give up the office of Secretary of War whether Mr.\r\nRoebuck's resolution had passed or not.\r\n\r\nThus was overthrown the famous coalition Cabinet of Lord Aberdeen--one\r\nof the most brilliant ever seen--a Cabinet distinguished for its\r\noratorical strength, and for the conspicuous abilities of its chief\r\nmembers. Mr. Gladstone, who was the most distinguished Peelite in the\r\nCabinet, certainly could not, up to this period, be suspected of\r\nlukewarmness in the prosecution of the war. Lord Palmerston formed a\r\nreconstructed rather than a new Cabinet. Mr. Gladstone and his friends\r\nat first declined to serve in the new Cabinet, out of regard for the\r\nDuke of Newcastle and Lord Aberdeen, the real victims of the adverse\r\nvote. But these noblemen besought Mr. Gladstone not to let his personal\r\nfeelings stand in the way of his own interests, and not to deprive the\r\ncountry of his great services, so he resumed office as Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer. Lord Palmerston had been regarded as the coming man, and his\r\nname carried weight upon the Continent and at home. But the new\r\nministry was surrounded by serious difficulties, and did not pull\r\ntogether very long. The War Minister, Lord Panmure, entered upon his\r\nduties with energy, and proposed, February 16th, his remedy for existing\r\nevils; but on the 19th of February Mr. Layard in the House of Commons\r\nsaid, \"the country stood on the brink of ruin--it had fallen into the\r\nabyss of disgrace and become the laughing-stock of Europe.\" He declared\r\nthat the new ministry differed little from the last.\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston, in answer to inquiries, lamented the sufferings of the\r\narmy and confessed that mishaps had been made, but the present ministry\r\nhad come forward in an emergency and from a sense of public duty, and he\r\nbelieved would obtain the confidence of the country. But another strange\r\nturn in events was at hand. Mr. Roebuck gave notice of the appointment\r\nof his committee. Hostility to the ministry was disclaimed, but Mr.\r\nGladstone, Sir James Graham and Mr. Sidney Herbert took the same view of\r\nthe question they had previously taken. They were opposed to the\r\ninvestigation as a dangerous breach of a great constitutional principle,\r\nand if the committee was granted, it would be a precedent from whose\r\nrepetition the Executive could never again escape, however unreasonable\r\nmight be the nature of the demand. They therefore retired from office.\r\n\r\nThe report of the committee, when presented, practically advised a vote\r\nof censure upon the Aberdeen Cabinet for the sufferings of the British\r\narmy, hence the house declined to entertain it by a large majority of\r\n107. As the appointment of the committee, however, was the only way to\r\nallay the popular excitement, there were many who thought that the\r\nPeelites would have done well to recognize the urgency of the crisis and\r\nnot to have abandoned the Government.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of Mr. Gladstone made him very unpopular. However, \"the\r\nwave of unpopularity lasted perhaps for a couple of years, and was\r\nafterwards replaced by a long-sustained popularity, which has not been\r\nexceeded by any statesman of the country. Greville referred to Gladstone\r\nabout this time as 'the most unpopular man in the country.'\"\r\n\r\nMarch 2d the Emperor Nicholas died suddenly, and there were momentary\r\nhopes of peace; but his successor, Alexander, resolved to prosecute the\r\nstruggle rather than yield the positions taken by the late Czar. He\r\nissued a warlike proclamation, and though he agreed to take part in the\r\nVienna Conference of European powers, to be held March 15th, there were\r\nno signs that he intended to recede from the Russian claims.\r\n\r\nLord John Russell was sent to Vienna as English Plenipotentiary. The\r\nEnglish aimed to secure the limitation of the preponderance of Russia in\r\nthe Black Sea, and the acknowledgment of Turkey as one of the great\r\nEuropean powers. To gain these points would, it was thought, end the\r\nwar. Russia \"would not consent to limit the number of her ships--if she\r\ndid so she forfeited her honor, she would be no longer Russia. They did\r\nnot want Turkey, they would be glad to maintain the Sultan, but they\r\nknew it was impossible; he must perish; they were resolved not to let\r\nany other power have Constantinople--they must not have that door to\r\ntheir dominions in the Black Sea shut against them.\" The Conference\r\nfailed, and Lord John Russell was held responsible for its failure, and\r\nwas eventually forced out of the Cabinet on that account. The failure of\r\nthe Vienna negotiations produced great excitement, and the ministry were\r\nattacked and defeated in both Houses of Parliament. Mr. Disraeli offered\r\na resolution of dissatisfaction in the House of Commons. Mr. Gladstone\r\nspoke during the debate on the failure of the Vienna Conference, and\r\ndefended the war of the Crimea. He did not consider it a failure, for\r\nRussia now agreed to most of the points raised by the allies, and the\r\nonly matter to be adjusted, was the proposition to limit the power of\r\nRussia in the Black Sea. Personally, he had formerly favored the\r\ncurtailment of Russia's power there, but he now thought that such a\r\nproposal implied a great indignity to Russia. He believed that the\r\nproposal of Russia to give to Turkey the power of opening and shutting\r\nthe straits was one calculated to bring about a peaceful settlement. The\r\ntime was favorable to make peace. Lord John Russell replied vigorously\r\nto Mr. Gladstone. The House decided by a majority of 100 to support the\r\nministry in the further prosecution of the war until a safe and\r\nhonorable peace could be secured.\r\n\r\nBut on the 10th of July Sir E. Bulwer Lytton offered the following\r\nresolution: \"That the conduct of our Ministry, in the recent\r\nnegotiations at Vienna, has, in the opinion of this House, shaken the\r\nconfidence of this country in those to whom its affairs are entrusted.\"\r\nLord John Russell again declined to face discussion and resigned. During\r\nthe debate on the motion Mr. Disraeli bitterly attacked Lord John\r\nRussell and the Premier, Lord Palmerston. But Mr. Gladstone said that so\r\nfar from blaming the Ministry for hesitating about the offers of peace\r\nat Vienna, he blamed them for not giving the propositions that\r\nconsideration which their gravity demanded, and for abruptly\r\nterminating the Conference and closing the hope of an honorable peace.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, on the 3d of August, made another powerful appeal for the\r\ncessation of the war. He held that there was now no definite object for\r\ncontinuing the struggle; defended the Austrian proposals; defied the\r\nWestern powers to control the future destinies of Russia, save for a\r\nmoment; and he placed \"the individual responsibility of the continuance\r\nof the war on the head of the Ministry.\"\r\n\r\nBut while Sebastopol held out there was no prospect of peace with\r\nRussia. Finally, in September, that fortress was taken and destroyed,\r\nand the Peace of Paris was concluded, March, 1856.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE OF COMMONS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nIN OPPOSITION TO THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nIt was in February, 1855, that Mr. Gladstone resigned his seat in the\r\nCabinet. After the Treaty of Paris, March, 1856, which put an end to the\r\nCrimean War, Mr. Gladstone found himself in opposition to the Ministry\r\nof Lord Palmerston. He had assumed a position of independence,\r\nassociating politically with neither party. The political parties\r\ndreaded criticism and attack from him, for he was not properly\r\nconstructed for the defense of either. He had himself declared his\r\n\"sympathies\" were \"with the Conservatives, and his opinions with the\r\nLiberals,\" and that he and his Peelite colleagues, during this period of\r\npolitical isolation, were like roving icebergs on which men could not\r\nland with safety, but with which ships might come into perilous\r\ncollision. Their weight was too great not to count, but it counted first\r\nthis way and then that. Mr. Gladstone was conscientious in his\r\nopposition. He said: \"I greatly felt being turned out of office. I saw\r\ngreat things to do. I longed to do them. I am losing the best years of\r\nmy life out of my natural service. Yet I have never ceased to rejoice\r\nthat I am not in office with Palmerston, when I have seen the tricks,\r\nthe shufflings, the frauds he daily has recourse to as to his business.\r\nI rejoice not to sit on the Treasury Bench with him.\"\r\n\r\nIn August, 1855, Lord Aberdeen said; \"Gladstone intends to be Prime\r\nMinister. He has great qualifications, but some serious defects. He is\r\nsupreme in the House of Commons. He is too obstinate; if a man can be\r\ntoo honest, he is too honest. I have told Gladstone that when he is\r\nPrime Minister, I will have a seat in his Cabinet, if he desires it,\r\nwithout an office.\"\r\n\r\nDuring 1856, several measures came before Parliament which Mr. Gladstone\r\nopposed. He vindicated the freedom of the Belgian press, whose liberty\r\nsome of the powers would curtail, and opposed resolutions to consider\r\nthe state of education in England and Wales, as tending to create a\r\ncentral controlling power, involving secular instruction and endless\r\nreligious quarrels. He also opposed the budget of Sir G.C. Lewis, which\r\nimposed more duties upon the tea and sugar of the working-man, and was\r\nsaid to be generally at variance with the policy pursued by every\r\nenlightened minister of finance. Besides, he condemned the continuance\r\nof the war duties in times of peace. \"He was a particularly acute thorn\r\nin the side of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and criticised the\r\nbudget with unsparing vigor. 'Gladstone seems bent on leading Sir George\r\nLewis a weary life,' wrote Mr. Greville. But finance was by no means the\r\nonly subject of this terrible free-lance.\"\r\n\r\nA resolution was offered in the House of Commons expressing\r\ndisapprobation with the English Cabinet for sanctioning, in 1855 and\r\n'56, the violation of international law, by secretly enlisting the\r\nsubjects of the United States as recruits for the British army, by the\r\nintervention of the English Ambassador. Mr. Gladstone said: \"It appears\r\nto me that the two cardinal aims that we ought to keep in view in the\r\ndiscussion of this question are peace and a thoroughly cordial\r\nunderstanding with America for one, the honor and fame of England for\r\nthe other. I am bound to say that in regard to neither of these points\r\nam I satisfied with the existing state of things, or with the conduct of\r\nHer Majesty's Government. A cordial understanding with America has not\r\nbeen preserved, and the honor of this country has been compromised.\"\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston, though very popular with the people, had greatly\r\noffended a large portion of the House of Commons by his interference in\r\nChina. A lorcha, called the _Arrow_, flying the British flag, had been\r\nseized by the Chinese, and the question arose as to the right of the\r\nvessel to the protection of England. The opponents of the government\r\ncontended that the vessel was built in China, was captured by pirates,\r\nand recaptured by the Chinese, and hence had no claim to British\r\nprotection. To bring the matter to an issue Mr. Cobden introduced a\r\nresolution of inquiry and censure. For five nights the debate was\r\nprotracted, and many able speeches were made on both sides, but Mr.\r\nGladstone made one of the most effective speeches, against the ministry.\r\nHe said: \"Every man, I trust, will give his vote with the consciousness\r\nthat it may depend upon his single vote whether the miseries, the\r\ncrimes, the atrocities that I fear are now proceeding in China are to be\r\ndiscountenanced or not. We have now come to the crisis of the case.\r\nEngland is not yet committed. With you, then, with us, with every one of\r\nus, it rests to show that this House, which is the first, the most\r\nancient, and the noblest temple of freedom in the world, is also the\r\ntemple of that everlasting justice without which freedom itself would\r\nonly be a name or only a curse to mankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe Premier ably defended himself, but the resolution of Mr. Cobden was\r\npassed. Parliament was dissolved March 21, 1857, and Lord Palmerston\r\nappealed to the country. He was victorious at the polls. Among the\r\nprominent Liberals who lost their seats were Cobden, Bright, and Milner\r\nGibson. The Peelites suffered loss too, but Mr. Gladstone was again\r\nelected for Oxford University. However, Mr. Greville writes, under date\r\nof June 3d: \"Gladstone hardly ever goes near the House of Commons, and\r\nnever opens his lips.\" But his indifference and silence were not to\r\nlast long.\r\n\r\nWhen the Divorce Bill, which originated in the Lords, came up in the\r\nCommons, Mr. Gladstone made an impassioned speech against the measure,\r\ncontending for the equality of woman with man in all the rights\r\npertaining to marriage. He dealt with the question on theological, legal\r\nand social grounds. He contended that marriage was not only or chiefly a\r\ncivil contract, but a \"mystery\" of the Christian religion. By the law of\r\nGod it could not be so annulled as to permit of the re-marriage of the\r\nparties. \"Our Lord,\" he says, \"has emphatically told us that, at and\r\nfrom the beginning, marriage was perpetual, and was on both sides\r\nsingle.\" He dwelt with pathetic force on the injustice between man and\r\nwoman of the proposed legislation, which would entitle the husband to\r\ndivorce from an unfaithful wife, but would give no corresponding\r\nprotection to the woman; and predicted the gloomiest consequences to the\r\nconjugal morality of the country from the erection of this new and\r\nodious tribunal. Nevertheless the bill became a law.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 a bill was introduced in the House of Commons by Lord\r\nPalmerston, to make conspiracy to murder a felony. It grew out of the\r\nattempt of Orsini upon the life of Napoleon III. The bill at first was\r\ncarried by an immense majority, but the conviction spread that the\r\nmeasure was introduced solely at the dictation of the French Emperor,\r\nand hence the proposal was strongly opposed. Mr. Gladstone said: \"These\r\ntimes are grave for liberty. We live in the nineteenth century; we talk\r\nof progress; we believe we are advancing, but can any man of observation\r\nwho has watched the events of the last few years in Europe have failed\r\nto perceive that there is a movement indeed, but a downward and backward\r\nmovement? There are few spots in which institutions that claim our\r\nsympathy still exist and flourish.... But in these times more than ever\r\ndoes responsibility centre upon the institutions of England, and if it\r\ndoes centre upon England, upon her principles, upon her laws and upon\r\nher governors, then I say that a measure passed by this House of\r\nCommons--the chief hope of freedom--which attempts to establish a moral\r\ncomplicity between us and those who seek safety in repressive measures,\r\nwill be a blow and a discouragement to that sacred cause in every\r\ncountry in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill was defeated by a majority of nineteen, and Lord Palmerston\r\nagain resigned. He was succeeded by Lord Derby, who once more came into\r\npower. Mr. Disraeli again became Chancellor of the Exchequer, and leader\r\nof the House of Commons. The new ministry, which existed largely on\r\nsufferance, passed some good measures.\r\n\r\nThe one hundredth anniversary of the battle of Plassey was celebrated in\r\nEngland June 23, 1857, to obtain funds for a monument to Lord Clive, who\r\nsecured India to England. The English then felt secure in the government\r\nof that land, yet at that very time one of the most wide-spread,\r\ndestructive and cruel rebellions was raging, and shaking to its very\r\nfoundations the English rule in Hindostan. Suddenly the news came of the\r\nterrible Indian mutiny and of the indiscriminate slaughter of men, women\r\nand children, filling all hearts with horror, and then of the crushing\r\nout of the rebellion. Lord Canning, Governor-General, issued a\r\nproclamation to the chiefs of Oudh, looking to the confiscation of the\r\npossessions of mutineers who failed to return to the allegiance of\r\nEngland. It was meant as clemency. But Lord Ellenborough, the officer in\r\ncharge of affairs in India, dispatched \"a rattling condemnation of the\r\nwhole proceeding.\" Says Justin McCarthy: \"It was absurd language for a\r\nman like Lord Ellenborough to address to a statesman like Lord Canning,\r\nwho had just succeeded in keeping the fabric of English government in\r\nIndia together during the most terrible trial ever imposed on it by\r\nfate.\" The matter was taken up by Parliament. Lord Shaftesbury moved\r\nthat the Lords disprove the sending of the dispatch. In the Commons the\r\nministry were arraigned. But Lord Ellenborough took upon himself the\r\nsole responsibility of the dispatch, and resigned. Mr. Gladstone was\r\ninvited to the vacant place, but declined.\r\n\r\nThe most important among the bills passed by Parliament was the India\r\nBill, by which the government of India was transferred from the East\r\nIndia Company to the Crown and the Home government. Mr. Gladstone, who\r\nopposed the bill, proposed a clause providing that the Indian troops\r\nshould not be employed in military operations beyond the frontiers\r\nof India.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1858, Mr. Gladstone accepted from the Premier the post of\r\nLord High Commissioner Extraordinary to the Ionian Islands. The people\r\nof the Ionian Islands, which in 1800 was formed into the Republic of the\r\nSeven Islands, and was under the protection of Great Britain from 1815,\r\nwere desirous of adding themselves to Greece. But the British government\r\nobjected to the separation and their union with Greece. Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas to repair to Corfu for the purpose of reconciling the people to the\r\nBritish protectorate. The Ionians regarded his appointment as a virtual\r\nabandonment of the protectorate of Great Britain. Mr. Gladstone,\r\nDecember 3d, addressed the Senate at Corfu in Italian. He had the\r\nreputation of being a Greek student, and the inhabitants of the Islands\r\npersisted in regarding him not as a Commissioner of a Conservative\r\nEnglish Government, but as \"Gladstone the Phil-Hellene!\" He made a tour\r\nof the Islands, holding levees, receiving deputations and delivering\r\nharangues, and was received wherever he went with the honors due to a\r\nliberator. His path everywhere was made to seem like a triumphal\r\nprogress. It was in vain he repeated his assurance that he came to\r\nreconcile them to the protectorate and not to deliver them from it. But\r\nthe popular instinct insisted upon regarding him as at least the\r\nprecursor of their union with the Kingdom of Greece. The legislative\r\nassembly met January 27, 1859, and proposed annexation to Greece.\r\nFinding that this was their firm wish and determination, Mr. Gladstone\r\ndespatched to the Queen a copy of the vote, in which the representatives\r\ndeclared that \"the single and unanimous will of the Ionian people has\r\nbeen and is for their union with the Kingdom of Greece.\" Mr. Gladstone\r\nreturned home in February, 1859. The Ionians continued their agitation,\r\nand in 1864 were formally given over to the government of Greece.\r\n\r\nParliament was opened February 3, 1859, by the Queen, who in her speech\r\nfrom the throne said that the attention of Parliament would be called\r\nto the state of the law regulating the representation of the people. The\r\nplan of the government was presented by Mr. Disraeli. \"It was a fanciful\r\nperformance,\" says an English writer. The ministry proposed not to alter\r\nthe limits of the franchise, but to introduce into boroughs a new kind\r\nof franchise founded on personal property. Mr. Disraeli characterized\r\nthe government measure as \"wise, prudent, adequate, conservative, and\r\nframed by men who reverence the past, are proud of the present, and\r\nconfident of the future.\" Two members of the Cabinet promptly resigned\r\nrather than be parties to these proposals. Mr. Bright objected because\r\nthe working classes were excluded. An amendment was moved by Lord John\r\nRussell condemning interference with the franchise which enabled\r\nfreeholders in boroughs to vote in counties, and demanding a wider\r\nextension of the suffrage in boroughs.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, though agreeing with these views, declined to support the\r\namendment, because, if carried, it would upset the government and bring\r\nin a weaker administration. He did not propose to support the\r\ngovernment, but he desired to see a settlement of the question of\r\nreform, and he thought the present opportunity advantageous for such\r\nsettlement. He pleaded eloquently for the retention of the\r\nsmall boroughs.\r\n\r\nThe bill was lost by a majority of thirty-nine. Lord Derby having\r\nadvised the Queen to dissolve Parliament, this was done April 3d. The\r\ngeneral elections which resulted from the defeat of the Conservatives in\r\nthe House of Commons on the Reform Bill, resulted in returning the\r\nLiberals with a considerable majority. Mr. Gladstone was again returned\r\nunopposed for the University of Oxford. The Queen opened the new\r\nParliament June 7th. In reply to the speech from the throne an amendment\r\nto the address was moved by Lord Hartington, proposing a vote of want of\r\nconfidence in the ministers. After three nights debate it was carried on\r\nJune 10th, by a majority of thirteen, Mr. Gladstone voting with the\r\ngovernment. Lord Derby and his colleagues immediately resigned. The\r\nQueen being averse to choosing between Lord John Russell and Lord\r\nPalmerston, turned to Lord Granville, leader of the Liberal party in the\r\nHouse of Lords. He failed to form a Cabinet, and Lord Palmerston again\r\nbecame Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of the political wheel once more brought Mr. Gladstone\r\ninto office as Chancellor of the Exchequer. It became necessary in\r\naccepting a Cabinet position to again appeal to his constituents at\r\nOxford for re-election. He voted as he did to sustain Lord Derby's\r\nadministration and to settle the Reform question, yet he was\r\nmisunderstood and some of his constituents alienated. He was strongly\r\nopposed by the Conservative Marquis of Chandos. The Conservatives\r\nclaimed that he should not be returned, because, as Professor Mansel\r\nsaid, by his \"acceptance of office he must now be considered as giving\r\nhis definite adhesion to the Liberal party, as at present reconstructed,\r\nand as approving of the policy of those who overthrew Lord Derby's\r\ngovernment.\" It was found on the conclusion of the poll, which continued\r\nfor five days, that Mr. Gladstone was returned with a majority of nearly\r\ntwo hundred over his opponent. It is worthy of note that this same year\r\nCambridge conferred upon Mr. Gladstone the honorary degree of D.C.L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMERIC STUDIES\r\n\r\n\"The plenitude and variety of Mr. Gladstone's intellectual powers,\" says\r\nG. Barnett Smith, \"have been the subject of such frequent comment that\r\nit would be superfluous to insist upon them here. On the political side\r\nof his career his life has been as unresting and active as that of any\r\nother great party leader, and if we regard him in the literary aspect we\r\nare equally astonished at his energy and versatility. Putting out of\r\nview his various works upon Homer, his miscellaneous writings of\r\nthemselves, with the reading they involve, would entitle their author to\r\ntake high rank on the score of industry.... We stand amazed at the\r\ninfinity of topics which have received Mr. Gladstone's attention.\"\r\n\r\nTo solve the problems associated with Homer has been the chief\r\nintellectual recreation, the close and earnest study of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nliterary life. \"The blind old man of Scio's rocky isle\" possessed for\r\nhim an irresistible and a perennial charm. Nor can this occasion\r\nsurprise, for all who have given themselves up to the consideration and\r\nattempted solution of the Homeric poems have found the fascination of\r\nthe occupation gather in intensity. It is not alone from the poetic\r\npoint of view that the first great epic of the world attracts students\r\nof all ages and of all countries. Homer presents, in addition, and\r\nbeyond every other writer, a vast field for ethnological, geographical,\r\nand historical speculation and research. The ancient world stands\r\nrevealed in the Homeric poems. Besides, almost numberless volumes have\r\nbeen written based upon the equally debatable questions of the Homeric\r\ntext and the Homeric unity.\r\n\r\nSome literary works of Mr. Gladstone have been already noticed. \"Studies\r\non Homer and Homeric Age\" shows Mr. Gladstone's classic tastes and\r\nknowledge as well as his great industry and ability. This work was\r\npublished in three volumes, in 1858. It is his _magnum opus_ in\r\nliterature, and exhibits wide and laborious research. \"It discusses the\r\nHomeric controversy in its broad aspects, the relation of Homer to the\r\nSacred Writings, his place in education, his historic aims, the probable\r\nperiod of the poet's life, the Homeric text, the ethnology of the Greek\r\nraces, and the politics and poetry of Homer. Among subsequent Greek\r\nstudies by Mr. Gladstone were his 'Juventus Mundi' and the 'Homeric\r\nSynchronism.' There is probably no greater living authority on the text\r\nof Homer than Mr. Gladstone, and the Ancient Greek race and literature\r\nhave exercised over him a perennial fascination.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone dwells much on the relation of Homer to Christianity. \"The\r\nstandard of humanity of the Greek poet is different, yet many of his\r\nideas almost carry us back to the early morning of our race; the hours\r\nof its greater simplicity and purity, and more free intercourse with\r\nGod.... How is it possible to overvalue this primitive representation of\r\nthe human race in a form complete, distinct and separate, with its own\r\nreligion, stories, policy, history, arts, manners, fresh and true to the\r\nstandard of its nature, like the form of an infant from the hand of the\r\nCreator, yet mature, full, and finished, in its own sense, after its own\r\nlaws, like some masterpiece of the sculptor's art?\" The Homeric scene of\r\naction is not Paradise, but it is just as far removed from the vices of\r\na later heathenism.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone compares the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey,\" which he believed\r\nto be the poems of one poet, Homer, with the Old Testament writings, and\r\nobserves that \"Homer can never be put into competition with the\r\nScriptures as touching the great fundamental, invaluable code of truth\r\nand hope;\" but he shows how one may in a sense be supplementary to the\r\nother. As regards the history of the Greek race, it is Homer that\r\nfurnishes \"the point of origin from which all distances are to be\r\nmeasured.\" He says: \"The Mosaic books, and the other historical books of\r\nthe Old Testament, are not intended to present, and do not present, a\r\npicture of human society or of our nature drawn at large. The poems of\r\nHomer may be viewed as the complement of the earliest portion of the\r\nsacred records.\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"The Holy Scriptures are like a thin stream, beginning from the\r\nvery fountain-head of our race, and gradually, but continuously, finding\r\ntheir way through an extended solitude into times otherwise known, and\r\ninto the general current of the fortunes of mankind. The Homeric poems\r\nare like a broad lake, outstretched in the distance, which provides us\r\nwith a mirror of one particular age and people, alike full and\r\nmarvelous, but which is entirely disassociated by a period of many\r\ngenerations from any other records, except such as are of the most\r\npartial and fragmentary kind. In respect of the influence which they\r\nhave respectively exercised upon mankind, it might appear almost profane\r\nto compare them. In this point of view the Scriptures stand so far apart\r\nfrom every other production, on account of their great offices in\r\nrelation to the coming of the Redeemer and to the spiritual training of\r\nmankind, that there can be nothing either like or second to them.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone thinks that \"the poems of Homer possess extrinsic worth as\r\na faithful and vivid picture of early Grecian life and measures; they\r\nhave also an intrinsic value which has given their author the first\r\nplace in that marvelous trinity of genius--Homer, Dante, and\r\nShakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the historic aims of Homer, Mr. Gladstone says: \"Where other poets\r\nsketch, Homer draws; and where they draw he carves. He alone of all the\r\nnow famous epic writers, moves (in the 'Iliad' especially) subject to\r\nthe stricter laws of time and place; he alone, while producing an\r\nunsurpassed work of the imagination, is also the greatest chronicler\r\nthat ever lived, and presents to us, from his own single hand, a\r\nrepresentation of life, manners, history, of morals, theology, and\r\npolitics, so vivid and comprehensive, that it may be hard to say whether\r\nany of the more refined ages of Greece or Rome, with their clouds of\r\nauthors and their multiplied forms of historical record, are either more\r\nfaithfully or more completely conveyed to us.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone fixes the probable date of Homer within a generation or\r\ntwo of the Trojan war, assigning as his principal reason for so doing\r\nthe poet's visible identity with the age, the altering but not yet\r\nvanishing age of which he sings, and the broad interval in tone and\r\nfeeling between himself and the very nearest of all that follow him. He\r\npresents several arguments to prove the trustworthiness of the text\r\nof Homer.\r\n\r\nIn 1877, Mr. Gladstone wrote an article on the \"Dominions of the\r\nOdysseus,\" and also wrote a preface to Dr. Henry Schliemann's \"Mycenae.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his most remarkable productions bore the title of, \"The Vatican\r\nDecrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance; a Political\r\nExpostulation.\" This book was an amplification of an article from his\r\nown pen, which appeared October, 1874, in the _Contemporary Review_. It\r\ncreated great public excitement and many replies. One hundred and twenty\r\nthousand copies were sold. Mr. Higginson says: \"The vigor of the style,\r\nthe learning exhibited, and the source whence it came, all contributed\r\nto give it an extraordinary influence.... It was boldly proclaimed in\r\nthis pamphlet that, since 1870, Rome has substituted for the proud boast\r\nof _semper eadem_, a policy of violence and change of faith;... 'that\r\nshe had equally repudiated modern thought and ancient history;' ... 'that\r\nshe has reburnished and paraded anew every rusty tool she was thought to\r\nhave disused,' and 'that Rome requires a convert who now joins her to\r\nforfeit his moral and mental freedom, and to place his loyalty and\r\ncivil duty at the mercy of another.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone issued another pamphlet, entitled \"Vaticanism; and Answers\r\nto Reproofs and Replies,\" He reiterated his original charges, saying:\r\n\"The Vatican decrees do, in the strictest sense, establish for the Pope\r\na supreme command over loyalty and civil duty.... Even in those parts of\r\nChristendom where the decrees and the present attitude of the Papal See\r\ndo not produce or aggravate open broils with the civil power, by\r\nundermining moral liberty, they impair moral responsibility, and\r\nsilently, in the succession of generations, if not in the lifetime of\r\nindividuals, tend to emasculate the vigor of the mind.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone published in seven volumes, in 1879, \"Gleanings of Past\r\nYears.\" The essay entitled \"Kin Beyond the Sea\" at first created much\r\nexcitement. \"The Kin Beyond the Sea\" was America, of which he says: \"She\r\nwill probably become what we are now, the head servant in the great\r\nhousehold of the world, the employer of all employed; because her\r\nservices will be the most and ablest.\" Again: \"The England and the\r\nAmerica of the present are probably the two strongest nations in the\r\nworld. But there can hardly be a doubt, as between the America and the\r\nEngland of the future, that the daughter, at some no very distant time,\r\nwill, whether fairer or less fair, be unquestionably yet stronger than\r\nthe mother.\" Mr. Gladstone argues in support of this position from the\r\nconcentrated continuous empire which America possesses, and the enormous\r\nprogress she has made within a century.\r\n\r\nIn an address at the opening of the Art Loan Exhibition of Chester,\r\nAugust 11, 1879, Mr. Gladstone said: \"With the English those two things\r\nare quite distinct; but in the oldest times of human industry--that is\r\nto say amongst the Greeks--there was no separation whatever, no gap at\r\nall, between the idea of beauty and the idea of utility. Whatever the\r\nancient Greek produced he made as useful as he could; and at the same\r\ntime, reward for work with him was to make it as beautiful as he could.\r\nIn the industrial productions of America there is very little idea of\r\nbeauty; for example, an American's axe is not intended to cut away a\r\ntree neatly, but quickly. We want a workman to understand that if he can\r\nlearn to appreciate beauty in industrial productions, he is thereby\r\ndoing good to himself, first of all in the improvement of his mind, and\r\nin the pleasure he derives from his work, and likewise that literally he\r\nis increasing his own capital, which is his labor.\"\r\n\r\nIn his articles on \"Ecce Homo\" he expresses the hope \"that the present\r\ntendency to treat the old belief of man with a precipitate, shallow,\r\nand unexamining disparagement, is simply a distemper, that inflicts for\r\na time the moral atmosphere, that is due, like plagues and fevers, to\r\nour own previous folly and neglect; and that when it has served its work\r\nof admonition and reform, will be allowed to pass away.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture\" is the title of a book by Mr.\r\nGladstone, the articles of which were originally published in _The\r\nSunday School Times_, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. GLADSTONE'S AXE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT BUDGETS\r\n\r\nThe year 1860 marked the beginning of the second half of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nlife as a statesman, in which he stood prominently forward as a\r\nReformer. July 18, 1859, as Chancellor in the Liberal government of Lord\r\nPalmerston, he brought forward his budget. The budget of 1860 was the\r\ngreatest of all his financial measures, for a new departure was taken in\r\nBritish commerce and manufactures. Mr. Cobden, in behalf of the English\r\nGovernment, had negotiated with France a treaty based on free trade\r\nprinciples--\"a treaty which gave an impetus to the trade of this\r\ncountry, whose far-reaching effects are felt even to our day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor explained the various propositions of his financial\r\nstatements. Speaking of discontent with the income tax he observed: \"I\r\nspeak on general terms. Indeed, I now remember that I myself had, about\r\na fortnight ago, a letter addressed to me complaining of the monstrous\r\ninjustice and iniquity of the income tax, and proposing that, in\r\nconsideration thereof, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be\r\npublicly hanged.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone said that the total reduction of duties would be over\r\n£1,000,000, requiring a slight extension of taxation; that by this means\r\nnearly £1,000,000 would be returned to the general revenue; that the\r\nloss to the revenue by the French Treaty, which was based upon free\r\ntrade principles, and the reduction of duties, would be half made up by\r\nthe imposts specified; that the abolition of the paper duty would\r\nproduce the happiest results from the spread of cheap literature. The\r\nreductions proposed would give a total relief to the consumer of nearly\r\n£4,000,000, and cause a net loss of the revenue of over £2,000,000, a\r\nsum about equivalent to the amount coming in from the cessation of\r\ngovernment annuities that year. The total revenue was £70,564,000, and\r\nas the total expenses of government was £70,000,000, there remained an\r\nestimated surplus of £464,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone concluded; \"There were times, now long by, when sovereigns\r\nmade progress through the land, and when at the proclamation of their\r\nheralds, they caused to be scattered whole showers of coin among the\r\npeople who thronged upon their steps.... Our Sovereign is enabled,\r\nthrough the wisdom of her great council, assembled in Parliament around\r\nher, again to scatter blessings among her subjects by means of wise and\r\nprudent laws; of laws which do not sap in any respect the foundations of\r\nduty or of manhood, but which strike away the shackles from the arm of\r\nindustry.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was one of the peculiarities of Mr. Gladstone's budget addresses\r\nthat they roused curiosity in the outset, and, being delivered in a\r\nmusical, sonorous, and perfectly modulated voice, kept the listeners\r\ninterested to the very close. This financial statement of 1860 was\r\nadmirably arranged for the purpose of awakening and keeping attention,\r\npiquing and teasing curiosity, and sustaining desire to hear from the\r\nfirst sentence to the last. It was not a speech, it was an oration, in\r\nthe form of a great State paper, made eloquent, in which there was a\r\nproper restraint over the crowding ideas, the most exact accuracy in the\r\nsentences, and even in the very words chosen; the most perfect balancing\r\nof parts, and, more than all, there were no errors or omissions; nothing\r\nwas put wrongly and nothing was overlooked. With a House crowded in\r\nevery corner, with the strain upon his own mental faculties, and the\r\ngreat physical tax implied in the management of his voice, and the\r\nnecessity for remaining upon his feet during this long period, 'the\r\nobserved of all observers,' Mr. Gladstone took all as quietly, we are\r\ntold, as if he had just risen to address a few observations to Mr.\r\nSpeaker. Indeed, it was laughingly said that he could address a House\r\nfor a whole week, and on the Friday evening have taken a new departure,\r\nbeginning with the observation, 'After these preliminary remarks, I will\r\nnow proceed to deal with the subject matter of my financial plan.'\"\r\n\r\nThe ministry was supported by large majorities, and carried their\r\nmeasures, but when the bill for the repeal of the duty on paper at home,\r\nas well as coming into the country, came before the House of Lords, it\r\nwas rejected. Mr. Gladstone appeared to be confronted by the greatest\r\nconstitutional crisis of his life. He gave vent to his indignation, and\r\ndeclared that the action of the Lords was a gigantic innovation, and\r\nthat the House of Commons had the undoubted right of selecting the\r\nmanner in which the people should be taxed. This speech was pronounced\r\nby Lord John Russell \"magnificently mad,\" and Lord Granville said that\r\n\"it was a toss-up whether Gladstone resigned or not, and that if he did\r\nit would break up the Liberal party.\" Quiet was finally restored, and\r\nthe following year Mr. Gladstone adroitly brought the same feature\r\nbefore the Lords in a way that compelled acceptance.\r\n\r\nThe budget of 1861 showed a surplus of £2,000,000 over the estimated\r\nsurplus, and proposed to remit the penny on the income tax, and to\r\nrepeal the paper duty. Instead of being divided into several bills as in\r\nthe previous year, the budget was presented as a whole--all included in\r\none. By this device the Lords were forced to acquiesce in the repeal of\r\nthe paper duty, or take the responsibility of rejecting the whole bill.\r\nThe Peers grumbled, and some of them were enraged. Lord Robert Cecil,\r\nnow Marquis of Salisbury, rudely declared that Mr. Gladstone's conduct\r\nwas only worthy of an attorney. He begged to apologize to the attorneys.\r\nThey were honorable men and would have scorned the course pursued by the\r\nministers. Another member of the House of Lords protested that the\r\nbudget gave a mortal stab to the Constitution. Mr. Gladstone retorted:\r\n\"I want to know, to what Constitution does it give a mortal stab? In my\r\nopinion it gives no mortal stab, and no stab at all, to any Constitution\r\nthat we are bound to care for. But, on the contrary, so far as it alters\r\nanything in the most recent course of practice, it alters in the\r\ndirection of restoring that good old Constitution which took its root in\r\nSaxon times, which grew from the Plantagenets, which endured the iron\r\nrepression of the Tudors, which resisted the aggressions of the Stuarts,\r\nand which has come to its full maturity under the House of Brunswick. I\r\nthink that is the Constitution, if I may presume to say so, which it is\r\nour duty to guard, and which--if, indeed, the proceedings of this year\r\ncan be said to affect it at all--will be all the better for the\r\noperation. But the Constitution which my right honorable friend worships\r\nis a very different affair.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Mr. Gladstone was elected Lord Rector of Edinburgh University,\r\nand the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon him.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, in 1861, introduced one of his most beneficial\r\nmeasures--a bill creating the Post Office Savings Bank. The success of\r\nthe scheme has gone beyond all expectation. At the close of 1891, the\r\namount deposited was £71,608,002, and growing at the average rate of\r\nover £4,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's financial measures for 1862, while not involving such\r\nmomentous issues as those of the preceding year, nevertheless\r\nencountered considerable opposition. The budget was a stationary one,\r\nwith no surplus, no new taxes, no remission of taxes, no\r\nheavier burdens.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1862, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone made a journey down the Tyne,\r\nwhich is thus described: \"It was not possible to show to royal visitors\r\nmore demonstrations of honor than were showered on the illustrious\r\nCommoner and his wife.... At every point, at every bank and hill and\r\nfactory, in every opening where people could stand or climb, expectant\r\ncrowds awaited Mr. Gladstone's arrival. Women and children, in all\r\ncostumes and of all conditions, lined the shores ... as Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGladstone passed. Cannon boomed from every point;... such a succession\r\nof cannonading never before greeted a triumphant conqueror on\r\nthe march.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during this journey that Mr. Gladstone made the memorable speech,\r\nat New Castle, upon the American Civil War, which had broken out the\r\nsame year. There had been much speculation as to whether the English\r\ngovernment would recognize the Confederacy as a separate and independent\r\npower, and the utterance of a member of the Cabinet under the\r\ncircumstances was regarded as entirely unwarranted. Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself frankly acknowledged his error in 1867: \"I must confess that I\r\nwas wrong; that I took too much upon myself in expressing such an\r\nopinion. Yet the motive was not bad. My sympathies were then--where they\r\nhad long before been, where they are now--with the whole\r\nAmerican people.\"\r\n\r\nThe session of 1863 was barren of important subjects of debate, and\r\nhence unusual interest was centered in the Chancellor's statement, which\r\nwas another masterly financial presentation, and its leading\r\npropositions were cordially received. The whole reduction of taxation\r\nfor the year was £3,340,000, or counting the total reductions, present\r\nand prospective, of £4,601,000. This still left a surplus of £400,000.\r\n\r\nIn four years £8,000,000 had been paid for war with China out of the\r\nordinary revenues. A proposition to subject charities to the income tax,\r\nalthough endorsed by the whole cabinet, led to such powerful opposition\r\nthroughout the country that it was finally withdrawn. The arguments of\r\nthe Chancellor were endorsed by many who were opposed to the\r\nindiscriminate and mistaken beneficence which was so prevalent on\r\ndeath-beds.\r\n\r\nA bill was introduced at this session by Sir Morton Peto, entitled the\r\n\"Dissenters' Burial Bill,\" the object of which was to enable\r\nNonconformists to have their own religious rites and services, and by\r\ntheir own ministers, in the graveyards of the Established Church. The\r\nbill was strongly opposed by Lord Robert Cecil and Mr. Disraeli. Mr.\r\nGladstone favored the measure. The bill was rejected, and Mr. Gladstone\r\nat a later period discovered that his progress in ecclesiastical and\r\npolitical opinions was creating a breach between himself and his\r\nconstituents at Oxford.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's financial scheme for 1864 was received with undiminished\r\ninterest. It was characterized as \"a policy of which peace, progress and\r\nretrenchment were the watchwords.\" An available surplus of £2,260,000\r\nenabled him to propose reductions.\r\n\r\nThe subject of reform, which had been coming up in the House of Commons\r\nin one way or another and agitating the House and the country since\r\n1859, when the Conservative party was beaten on the question, reappeared\r\nin 1864. The question of lowering the borough franchise came up, and Mr.\r\nGladstone startled the House and the country by his declaration upon the\r\nsubject of reform, which showed the rapid development of his views upon\r\nthe subject. The Conservative party was filled with alarm, and the hopes\r\nof the Reform party correspondingly elated. \"The eyes of all Radical\r\nReformers turned to Mr. Gladstone as the future Minister of Reform in\r\nChurch and State. He became from the same moment an object of distrust,\r\nand something approaching to detestation in the eyes of all steady-going\r\nConservatives.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone said: \"I say that every man who is not presentably\r\nincapacitated by some consideration of personal unfitness or political\r\ndanger, is morally entitled to come within the pale of the\r\nconstitution.\" This declaration was the first note sounded in a conflict\r\nwhich, twelve months later, was to cost Mr. Gladstone his seat for\r\nOxford University, and finally to culminate in the disruption of the\r\nLiberal Government. The general feeling in regard to this speech was\r\nthat if the Liberal party had failed in its duty on the subject of\r\nreform in the existing Parliament after Mr. Gladstone's utterances,\r\nthat the condition of things must undergo a change, so great was the\r\neffect of his speech in the country. The bill, which was presented by a\r\nprivate member and lost, was made memorable by the speech of the\r\nChancellor. The eyes of careful political leaders were again turned\r\ntowards Mr. Gladstone, and strong predictions made of his coming\r\nexaltation to the Premiership. Mr. Speaker Denison said, in October,\r\n1864: \"I now anticipate that Mr. Gladstone will be Premier. Neither\r\nparty has any leader. I hope Mr. Gladstone may get support from the\r\nConservatives who now support Palmerston.\" And these expectations were\r\nknown to Mr. Gladstone himself, for Bishop Wilberforce had a\r\nconversation with him and writes: \"Long talk with Gladstone as to\r\nPremiership: he is for acting under John Russell.\" Again to Mr.\r\nGladstone: \"Anything which breaks up, or tends to break up, Palmerston's\r\nsupremacy, must bring you nearer to the post in which I long to see you,\r\nand, if I live, shall see you.\" Lord Palmerston himself said: \"Gladstone\r\nwill soon have it all his own way; and whenever he gets my place we\r\nshall have strange things.\"\r\n\r\nThe hostile feeling towards the Palmerston government, which had been\r\ngrowing in intensity, chiefly on the ground of its foreign policy,\r\nreached its full height in a fierce battle between the Ministry and the\r\nOpposition. July 4, 1864, Mr. Disraeli brought forward his motion of\r\n\"no confidence.\" Mr. Gladstone replied for the government, and sought to\r\nrebut the accusations made by the leader of the Opposition. He said that\r\nit was the very first time in which the House of Commons had been called\r\nupon to record the degradation of the country, simply for the sake of\r\ndisplacing a ministry.\r\n\r\nAn amusing episode which occurred during this debate is worthy of record\r\nhere; Mr. Bernard Osborne \"grew amusingly sarcastic at the expense of\r\nthe government, though he paid at the same time a great compliment to\r\nMr. Gladstone. He likened the Cabinet to a museum of curiosities, in\r\nwhich there were some birds of rare and noble plumage, both alive and\r\nstuffed. There had been a difficulty, unfortunately, in keeping up the\r\nbreed, and it was found necessary to cross it with the famous Peelites.\r\n'I will do them the justice to say that they have a very great and noble\r\nMinister among them in the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and it is to his\r\nmeasures alone that they owe the little popularity and the little\r\nsupport they get from this Liberal party.' Describing Mr. Milner Gibson,\r\nthe honorable gentleman said he was like some 'fly in amber,' and the\r\nwonder was 'how the devil he got there.' Mr. Cobden and Mr. Bright must\r\nhave been disappointed in this 'young man from the country.' He had\r\nbecome insolent and almost quarrelsome under the guidance of the noble\r\nlord. Should that Parliament decide on terminating its own and their\r\nexistence, they would find consolation that the funeral oration would be\r\npronounced by Mr. Newdegate, and that some friendly hand would inscribe\r\non their mausoleum, 'Rest and be thankful.'\" Mr. Disraeli's motion was\r\nlost, and the ministry was sustained.\r\n\r\nThe budget of 1865 represented the country as in a prosperous financial\r\ncondition. The total reduction was over £5,000,000. Such a financial\r\nshowing gained the warm approval of the people, and excited but little\r\nopposition in the House. It was evident that a master-hand was guiding\r\nthe national finances, and fortunately the Chancellor's calculations\r\nwere verified by the continued prosperity of the country. At a later\r\nperiod, in commenting upon the policy of the two parties--Conservative\r\nand Liberal--Mr. Gladstone said: \"From thence it follows that the policy\r\nof the Liberal party has been to reduce the public charges and to keep\r\nthe expenditure within the estimates, and, as a result, to diminish the\r\ntaxation of the country and the national debt; that the policy of the\r\nTory government, since they took office in 1866, has been to increase\r\nthe public charges, and to allow the departments to spend more than\r\ntheir estimates, and, as a result, to create deficits and to render the\r\nreduction of taxation impossible. Which policy will the country prefer?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERAL REFORMER AND PRIME MINISTER\r\n\r\nJuly, 1865, Parliament having run its allotted course, according to the\r\nconstitution, was dissolved, and a general election took place, which\r\nresulted in the Liberal party being returned again with a majority. Mr.\r\nGladstone's relations with many of his constituents were not harmonious,\r\nowing to his pronounced Liberal views, and his seat for Oxford was\r\nseriously imperilled. Mr. Gathorne Hardy was nominated to run against\r\nhim. The High Tory party resolved to defeat him, and he was defeated by\r\na majority of 180. \"The electors preferred the uncompromising defender\r\nof the Church and Toryism to the brilliant statesman and financier.\"\r\nAlmost all of the distinguished residents of Oxford and three-fourths of\r\nthe tutors and lecturers of the University voted for Mr. Gladstone, and\r\nhis rejection was entirely owing to the opposing vote of non-residents\r\nand the bigotry of the hostile country clergymen of the Church of\r\nEngland. From the Bishop of Oxford Mr. Gladstone received the following\r\nindignant protest:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot forbear expressing to you my grief and indignation at the\r\nresult. It is needless for me to say that everything I could with\r\npropriety do I did heartily to save our University this great loss and\r\ndishonor, as well from a loving honor of you. You were too great\r\nfor them.\"\r\n\r\n\"The enemies of the University,\" observed the _Times_, \"will make the\r\nmost of her disgrace. It has hitherto been supposed that a learned\r\nconstituency was to some extent exempt from the vulgar motives of party\r\nspirit, and capable of forming a higher estimate of statesmanship than\r\ncommon tradesmen or tenant-farmers.\"\r\n\r\nHis valedictory address to his former constituents was short: \"After\r\nan arduous connection of eighteen years, I bid you, respectfully,\r\nfarewell.... It is one imperative duty, and one alone, which induces me\r\nto trouble you with these few parting words, the duty of expressing my\r\nprofound and lasting gratitude for indulgence as generous, and for\r\nsupport as warm and enthusiastic in itself, and as honorable from the\r\ncharacter and distinctions of those who have given it, as has, in my\r\nbelief, ever been accorded by any constituency to any representative.\"\r\n\r\nOne event in Parliament, in 1865, contributed much to Mr. Gladstone's\r\ndefeat: In March, 1865, Mr. Dillwyn, the Radical member for Swansea,\r\nmoved \"that the present position of the Irish Church Establishment is\r\nunsatisfactory, and calls for the early attention of her Majesty's\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nSir Stafford Northcote wrote: \"Gladstone made a terribly long stride in\r\nhis downward progress last night, and denounced the Irish Church in a\r\nway which shows how, by and by, he will deal not only with it, but with\r\nthe Church of England too.... He laid down the doctrines that the tithe\r\nwas national property, and ought to be dealt with by the State in a\r\nmanner most advantageous to the people; and that the Church of England\r\nwas only national because the majority of the people still belong\r\nto her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was now felt that henceforth Mr. Gladstone must belong to the\r\ncountry, and not to the University.\" He realized this himself, for\r\ndriven from Oxford, he went down to South Lancashire, seeking to be\r\nreturned from there to Parliament, and in the Free Trade Hall,\r\nManchester, said: \"At last, my friends, I am come among you, and I am\r\ncome among you unmuzzled.\" These words were greeted with loud and\r\nprolonged applause. The advanced Liberals seemed to take the same view,\r\nand regarded Mr. Gladstone's defeat at Oxford by the Conservatives as\r\nhis political enfranchisement. His defeat was not wholly unexpected to\r\nhimself. In 1860 he said: \"Without having to complain, I am entirely\r\nsick and weary of the terms upon which I hold the seat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone felt keenly the separation, for he wrote to the Bishop of\r\nOxford: \"There have been two great deaths, or transmigrations of spirit,\r\nin my political existence--one, very slow, the breaking of ties with my\r\noriginal party, the other, very short and sharp, the breaking of the tie\r\nwith Oxford. There will probably be a third, and no more.\" And in a\r\nspeech at Liverpool, there was something of pathos in his reference to\r\nOxford, when he said that if he had clung to the representation of the\r\nUniversity with desperate fondness, it was because he would not desert a\r\npost to which he seemed to have been called. But he had now been\r\ndismissed from it, not by academical, but by political agencies.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was elected to represent his native district in\r\nParliament, and he was at the head of the poll in Manchester, Liverpool,\r\nand all the large towns. The result of the general elections was a\r\nconsiderable gain to the Liberal party, but that party sustained a\r\nsevere loss by the death of Lord Palmerston, October 18, 1865.\r\n\r\nA new cabinet was constructed, with Earl Russell as Premier, and Mr.\r\nGladstone as the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Gladstone became for\r\nthe first time the recognized leader in the House of Commons, which\r\nthen meant virtually Prime Minister, for with the aged Premier in the\r\nHouse of Lords, and the youthful Chancellor in the Commons, it meant\r\nnothing else. But Earl Russell and his younger colleague were calculated\r\nto work in harmonious action, for they were both Reformers. The ardent\r\ntemperament and the severe conscientiousness of the leader was the cause\r\nof much speculation and anxiety as to his management. His first\r\nappearance as leader of the House was therefore waited for with much\r\ncuriosity. The new Parliament was opened February 6, 1866, by the Queen\r\nin person, for the first time since the death of Prince Albert. In the\r\nspeech from the throne it was announced that Parliament would be\r\ndirected to consider such improvements in the laws which regulate the\r\nright of voting in the election of the members of the House of Commons\r\nas may tend to strengthen our free institutions, and conduce to the\r\npublic welfare. Bishop Wilberforce wrote: \"Gladstone has risen entirely\r\nto his position, and done all his most sanguine friends hoped for as\r\nleader.... There is a general feeling of insecurity of the ministry, and\r\nthe Reform Bill to be launched to-night is thought a bad rock.\"\r\n\r\nMay 3, 1866, Mr. Gladstone brought forward what was destined to be his\r\nlast budget for some years. There was a surplus of over a million and a\r\nquarter of pounds, which allowed a further and considerable reduction\r\nof taxation.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Ireland was very grave at this time, and as\r\napprehensions were felt in regard to the Fenians, a bill suspending the\r\nHabeas Corpus Act in Ireland was passed. Mr. Gladstone, in explaining\r\nthe necessity for the measure, said that the government were ready at\r\nany time to consider any measure for the benefit of Ireland, but it was\r\nthe single duty of the House at the moment to strengthen the hands of\r\nthe Executive in the preservation of law and order. The bill was renewed\r\nby the Derby government, and passed as before, as the result of an\r\nanticipated great Fenian uprising under \"Head-Centre\" Stephens.\r\n\r\nDuring a debate on the bill for the abolition of Church rates, Mr.\r\nGladstone said that the law requiring Church rates was _prima facie_\r\nopen to great objection, but he could not vote for total abolition. He\r\noffered a compromise and proposed that Dissenters be exempted from\r\npaying Church rates, and at the same time be disqualified from\r\ninterfering with funds to which they had not contributed. The compromise\r\nwas accepted, but failed to become a law.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of reform, mentioned in the address, there were great\r\ndebates, during the session of 1866. The new Cabinet, known as the\r\nRussell-Gladstone Ministry, set themselves to work in earnest upon a\r\nquestion that had baffled all the skill of various administrations. As a\r\npart of the reform scheme, Mr. Gladstone brought forward a Franchise\r\nBill in the House of Commons, March 12th.\r\n\r\nThe bill satisfied most of the Liberal party. Mr. Robert Lowe, a\r\nLiberal, became one of its most powerful assailants. His enmity to the\r\nworking classes made him extremely unpopular. Mr. Horseman also joined\r\nthe Conservatives in opposing the bill. Mr. Bright, in a crushing\r\nretort, fastened upon the small party of Liberals, led by these two\r\nmembers in opposition to the bill, the epithet of \"Adullamites.\" Mr.\r\nHorseman, Mr. Bright said, had \"retired into what may be called his\r\npolitical Cave of Adullam, to which he invited every one who was in\r\ndistress, and every one who was discontented. He had long been anxious\r\nto found a party in this house, and there is scarcely a member at this\r\nend of the House who is able to address us with effect or to take much\r\npart, whom he has not tried to bring over to his party and his cabal. At\r\nlast he has succeeded in hooking ... Mr. Lowe. I know it was the opinion\r\nmany years ago of a member of the Cabinet that two men could make a\r\nparty. When a party is formed of two men so amiable and so disinterested\r\nas the two gentlemen, we may hope to see for the first time in\r\nParliament a party perfectly harmonious and distinguished by mutual and\r\nunbroken trust. But there is one difficulty which it is impossible to\r\nremove. This party of two is like the Scotch terrier that is so covered\r\nwith hair that you could not tell which was the head and which was the\r\ntail.\" This sally, which excited immoderate laughter, remains one of the\r\nhappiest examples of Parliamentary retort and badinage.\r\n\r\nDuring this session the Conservative party met at the residence of the\r\nMarquis of Salisbury, and decided upon strongly opposing the measure\r\nproposed by the Liberal government. Mr. Bright characterized it as \"a\r\ndirty conspiracy.\" On the other hand, the country supported the bill,\r\nand great meetings were held in its interest. Mr. Gladstone spoke at a\r\ngreat meeting at Liverpool. He said: \"Having produced this measure,\r\nfounded in a spirit of moderation, we hope to support it with\r\ndecision.... We have passed the Rubicon, we have broken the bridge and\r\nburned the boats behind us. We have advisedly cut off the means of\r\nretreat, and having done this, we hope that, as far as time is yet\r\npermitted, we have done our duty to the Crown and to the nation.\" This\r\nwas regarded as the bugle-call to the Liberal party for the\r\ncoming battle.\r\n\r\nThe debate began April 12th, and continued for eight nights. \"On no\r\noccasion since, and seldom before, has such a flow of eloquence been\r\nheard within the walls of the House of Commons.\" Mr. Disraeli spoke for\r\nthree hours against the bill, and in his speech accused Mr. Gladstone of\r\nintroducing American ideas of Government, and of having once assailed\r\nthe very principles he now advocated, when in the Oxford Union he spoke\r\nagainst the Reform Bill of 1832. Mr. Gladstone's reply was one of the\r\nmost noteworthy parts of this famous debate. He rose at one o'clock in\r\nthe morning to conclude a legislative battle which had begun two weeks\r\nbefore. \"At last,\" Mr. Gladstone said, \"we have obtained a declaration\r\nfrom an authoritative source that a bill which, in a country with five\r\nmillions of adult males, proposes to add to a limited constituency\r\n200,000 of the middle class and 200,000 of the working class, is, in the\r\njudgment of the leader of the Tory party, a bill to reconstruct the\r\nconstitution upon American principles.\r\n\r\n\"The right honorable gentleman, secure in the recollection of his own\r\nconsistency, has taunted me with the errors of my boyhood. When he\r\naddressed the honorable member of Westminster, he showed his magnanimity\r\nby declaring that he would not take the philosopher to task for what he\r\nwrote twenty-five years ago; but when he caught one who, thirty-six\r\nyears ago, just emerged from boyhood, and still an undergraduate at\r\nOxford, had expressed an opinion adverse to the Reform Bill of 1832, of\r\nwhich he had so long and bitterly repented, then the right honorable\r\ngentleman could not resist the temptation.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill was put upon its passage. The greatest excitement prevailed.\r\n\"The house seemed charged with electricity, like a vast thunder-cloud;\r\nand now a spark was about to be applied. Strangers rose in their seats,\r\nthe crowd at the bar pushed half-way up the House, the Royal Princes\r\nleaned forward in their standing places, and all was confusion.\"\r\nPresently order was restored, and breathless excitement prevailed while\r\nthe tellers announced that the bill had been carried by a majority of\r\nonly five.\r\n\r\n\"Hardly had the words left the teller's lips than there arose a wild,\r\nraging, mad-brained shout from floor and gallery, such as has never been\r\nheard in the present House of Commons. Dozens of half-frantic Tories\r\nstood up in their seats, madly waved their hats and hurrahed at the top\r\nof their voices. Strangers in both galleries clapped their hands. The\r\nAdullamites on the Ministerial benches, carried away by the delirium of\r\nthe moment, waved their hats in sympathy with the Opposition, and\r\ncheered as loudly as any. Mr. Lowe, the leader, instigator, and prime\r\nmover of the conspiracy, stood up in the excitement of the\r\nmoment--flushed, triumphant, and avenged.... He took off his hat, waved\r\nit in wide and triumphant circles over the heads of the very men who had\r\njust gone into the lobby against him.... But see, the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer lifts up his hand to bespeak silence, as if he had something\r\nto say in regard to the result of the division. But the more the great\r\norator lifts his hand beseechingly, the more the cheers are renewed and\r\nthe hats waved. At length the noise comes to an end by the process of\r\nexhaustion, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer rises. Then there is a\r\nuniversal hush, and you might hear a pin drop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Few, if any, could anticipate at this time, that in the course of one\r\nshort year a Conservative Government would find itself compelled to take\r\nup that very question of Reform, whose virtual defeat its opponents now\r\nhailed with such intoxicating expressions of delight.\" However, the bill\r\nwas unexpectedly wrecked June 18th, by an amendment substituting a ratal\r\ninstead of a rental basis for the borough franchise. The ministry\r\nregarding this as a vital point, could not agree to it, and consequently\r\nthrew up their measure and resigned office. The Queen was unwilling to\r\naccept their resignation. But the ministry felt that they had lost the\r\nconfidence of the House, so their resignation was announced June 26th.\r\n\r\nThe apathy of the people about reform that Earl Russell thought he\r\nperceived, as far as London was concerned, at once disappeared. A great\r\ndemonstration was made at Trafalgar Square, where some ten thousand\r\npeople assembled and passed resolutions in favor of reform. A serious\r\nriot occurred at Hyde Park in consequence of the prohibition by the\r\nGovernment of the meeting of the Reform League. The Reformers then\r\nmarched to Carleton House Terrace, the residence of Mr. Gladstone,\r\nsinging songs in his honor. He was away from home, but Mrs. Gladstone\r\nand her family came out on the balcony to acknowledge the tribute paid\r\nby the people. It is said that Mr. Gladstone, now for the first time,\r\nbecame a popular hero. Great meetings were held in the interest of\r\nreform in the large towns of the North and the Midlands, where his name\r\nwas received with tumultuous applause. Mr. Gladstone was hailed\r\neverywhere as the leader of the Liberal party. Reform demonstrations\r\ncontinued during the whole of the recess. A meeting was held at\r\nBrookfields, near Birmingham, which was attended by nearly 250,000\r\npeople. The language of some of the ardent friends of reform was not\r\nalways discreet, but Mr. Gladstone appears to have preserved a calm and\r\ndignified attitude.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1866, Lord Derby had announced his acceptance of office\r\nas Premier, and the formation of a Conservative Cabinet. The\r\ndemonstrations of the people compelled the Conservatives to introduce\r\nmeasures in Liberal Reform. Accordingly, in 1867, Mr. Disraeli and his\r\ncolleagues passed a Reform Bill, which, after various modifications, was\r\nfar more extreme than that presented by the Liberals and defeated.\r\n\r\nOwing to a division in the ranks of the Liberal members on the pending\r\nbill, Mr. Gladstone withdrew from the active leadership of the House,\r\nbut soon resumed it. Mr. Bright said, at Birmingham, that since 1832,\r\nthere had been no man of Mr. Gladstone's rank as a statesman who had\r\nimported into the Reform question so much of conviction, of earnestness,\r\nand of zeal.\r\n\r\nNot long after this deputations from various parts of the country,\r\naccompanied by their representatives in Parliament, called on Mr.\r\nGladstone to present addresses expressive of confidence in him as\r\nLiberal leader.\r\n\r\nLord Cranborne expressed his astonishment at hearing the bill described\r\nas a Conservative triumph. It was right that its real parentage should\r\nbe established. The bill had been modified by Mr. Gladstone. All his\r\npoints were conceded. If the adoption on the principles of Mr. Bright\r\ncould be described as a triumph, then indeed the Conservative party, in\r\nthe whole history of its previous annals, had won no triumphs so simple\r\nas this. In the House of Lords the Duke of Buccleuch declared that the\r\nonly word in the bill that remained unaltered was the first word,\r\n\"whereas.\"\r\n\r\n\"The work of reform was completed in the session of 1868, by the passing\r\nof the Scotch and Irish Reform Bills, a Boundary Bill for England and\r\nWales, an Election Petitions and Corrupt Practices Prevention Bill, and\r\nthe Registration of Voters Bill. The object of the last-named measure\r\nwas to accelerate the elections, and to enable Parliament to meet before\r\nthe end of 1868.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1866, Mr. Gladstone and his family again visited Italy,\r\nand at Rome had an audience with Pope Pio Nono. It became necessary two\r\nyears later, owing to this interview, for Mr. Gladstone formally to\r\nexplain his visit.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1868, Lord Derby, owing to failing health, resigned. The\r\nDerby Ministry retired from office, and Mr. Disraeli became Prime\r\nMinister. An English author writes: \"There was, of course, but one\r\npossible Conservative Premier--Mr. Disraeli--he who had served the\r\nConservative party for more than thirty years, who had led it to\r\nvictory, and who had long been the ruling spirit of the Cabinet.\"\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Mr. Disraeli to the Premiership before Mr. Gladstone,\r\nproduced, in some quarters, profound regret and even indignation. But\r\nMr. Disraeli, though in office, was not in power. He was nominally the\r\nleader of a House that contained a large majority of his political\r\nopponents, now united among themselves. The schism in the Liberal party\r\nhad been healed by the question of Reform, and they could now defeat the\r\ngovernment whenever they chose to do so; consequently Mr. Gladstone took\r\nthe initiative. His compulsory Church Rates Abolition Bill was\r\nintroduced and accepted. By this measure all legal proceedings for the\r\nrecovery of church rates were abolished. The question that overshadowed\r\nall others, however, was that of the Irish Church.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of March Mr. Gladstone struck the first blow in the struggle\r\nthat was to end in the disestablishment of the Irish Church. Mr. Maguire\r\nmoved that the House consider the condition of Ireland. Mr. Gladstone\r\nsaid that Ireland had a controversy with England and a long account\r\nagainst England. It was a debt of justice, and he enumerated six\r\nparticulars, one of which was the Established Episcopal Church.\r\nReligious Equality, he contended, must be conceded. He said, in\r\nreferring to his speech made on the motion of Mr. Dillwyn in 1865: \"The\r\nopinion I held then and hold now--namely, that in order to the\r\nsettlement of this question of the Irish Church, that Church, as a State\r\nChurch must cease to exist.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech excited feelings of consternation amongst the\r\nMinisterialists. Mr. Disraeli bewailed his own unhappy fate at the\r\ncommencement of his career as Prime Minister, at finding himself face\r\nto face with the necessity of settling an account of seven centuries\r\nold. He complained that all the elements of the Irish crisis had existed\r\nwhile Mr. Gladstone was in office, but no attempt had been made to deal\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nMarch 23d Mr. Gladstone proposed resolutions affirming that the Irish\r\nEpiscopal Church should cease to exist as an establishment, and asking\r\nthe Queen to place at the disposal of Parliament her interest in the\r\ntemporalities of the Irish Church.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's resolution was carried by a majority of 65, and the\r\nQueen replied that she would not suffer her interests to stand in the\r\nway of any measures contemplated by Parliament. Consequently Mr.\r\nGladstone brought in his Irish Church Suspensory Bill, which was adopted\r\nby the Commons, but rejected by the Lords. During the discussion,\r\nministerial explanations followed; Mr. Disraeli described, in his most\r\npompous vein, his audiences with the Queen. His statement amounted to\r\nthis--that, in spite of adverse votes, the Ministers intended to hold on\r\ntill the autumn, and then to appeal to the new electorate created by the\r\nReform Act.\r\n\r\nLord Houghton wrote: \"Gladstone is the great triumph, but as he owns\r\nthat he has to drive a four-in-hand, consisting of English Liberals,\r\nEnglish Dissenters, Scotch Presbyterians, and Irish Catholics, he\r\nrequires all his courage to look the difficulties in the face and trust\r\nto surmount them.\"\r\n\r\nAn appeal was now made to the country. The general election that\r\nfollowed, in November, was fought out mainly upon this question. A great\r\nLiberal majority was returned to Parliament, which was placed at 115.\r\nBut there were several individual defeats, among them Mr. Gladstone\r\nhimself, who was rejected by South Lancaster. This was in part owing to\r\nthe readjustment of seats according to the Reform Bill. But Mr.\r\nGladstone received an invitation from Greenwich, in the southwestern\r\ndivision, where he was warmly received by the electors. \"He spoke\r\neverywhere, with all his fiery eloquence, on the monstrous foolishness\r\nof a religious establishment which ministered only to a handful of the\r\npeople.\" Is the Irish Church to be or not to be? was the question. He\r\nwas returned for that borough by a large majority over his Conservative\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Wilberforce wrote in November: \"The returns to the House of\r\nCommons leave no doubt of the answer of the country to Gladstone's\r\nappeal. In a few weeks he will be in office at the head of a majority of\r\nsomething like a hundred, elected on the distinct issue of Gladstone and\r\nthe Irish Church.\"\r\n\r\nThe feeling was so enormously great in its preponderance for Mr.\r\nGladstone's policy of Liberal Reform, especially for the\r\ndisestablishment of the Irish Church, that Mr. Disraeli did not adopt\r\nthe usual course of waiting for the endorsement of the new Parliament,\r\nwhich he felt sure would be given to Mr. Gladstone, but resigned, and\r\nthe first Disraeli Cabinet went out of office, December 2d.\r\n\r\nDecember 4, 1868, the Queen summoned Mr. Gladstone to Windsor to form a\r\nCabinet. He had now attained the summit of political ambition. He was\r\nthe first Commoner in the land--the uncrowned king of the British Empire\r\n--for such is the English Premier. \"All the industry and self-denial of\r\na laborious life, all the anxieties and burdens and battles of five and\r\nthirty years of Parliamentary struggle were crowned by this supreme and\r\nadequate reward. He was Prime Minister of England--had attained to that\r\ngoal of the Eton boy's ambition; and, what perhaps was to him of greater\r\nconsideration, he was looked up to by vast numbers of the people as\r\ntheir great leader.\"\r\n\r\nDecember 9th the new government was completed and the ministers received\r\ntheir seals from the Queen. Mr. Bright, contrary to all expectation,\r\nbecame President of the Board of Trade. In offering themselves for\r\nre-election, the members of the new Cabinet found no trouble--all were\r\nreturned. Mr. Gladstone was returned by Greenwich.\r\n\r\nWith the year 1869 Mr. Gladstone entered upon a great period of Reform.\r\nThe new Parliament was opened December 10th. On the 11th Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGladstone paid a visit to Lord and Lady Salisbury, at Hatfield. Bishop\r\nWilberforce was there and had opportunity to observe his old and honored\r\nfriend in the first flush of his new dignity. Here are his comments:\r\n\"Gladstone, as ever, great, earnest, and honest; as unlike the tricky\r\nDisraeli as possible.\" To Dr. Trench the Bishop wrote: \"The nation has\r\ndecided against our establishment, and we bow to its decision, and on\r\nwhat tenure and conditions it is to be held, remains confessedly open.\"\r\n\"But his sagacious and statesmanlike counsel was disregarded. The Irish\r\nBishops ranged themselves in bitter but futile hostility to the change.\r\nA frantic outbreak of Protestant violence began in Ireland and spread to\r\nEngland.\" Bishop Wilberforce notes this conversation at Windsor Castle:\r\n\"The Queen very affable. 'So sorry Mr. Gladstone started this about the\r\nIrish Church, and he is a great friend of yours.'\"\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of February Parliament assembled. March 1st Mr. Gladstone\r\nintroduced his momentous bill in a speech of three hours, his first\r\nspeech as Prime Minister, which was characterized as \"calm, moderate and\r\nkindly.\" It was proposed that on January 1, 1871, the Irish Church\r\nshould cease to exist as an establishment and should become a\r\nfree Church.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli, in the Commons, moved the rejection of the bill. In\r\nopposing the measure he objected to disestablishment, because he was in\r\nfavor of the union of Church and State.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone eloquently concluded as follows: \"As the clock points\r\nrapidly towards the dawn, so as rapidly flow out the years, the months,\r\nthe days, that remain to the existence of the Irish Established\r\nChurch.... Not now are we opening this great question. Opened, perhaps,\r\nit was when the Parliament which expired last year pronounced upon it\r\nthat emphatic judgment which can never be recalled. Opened it was,\r\nfurther, when in the months of autumn the discussions were held in every\r\nquarter of the Irish Church. Prosecuted another stage it was, when the\r\ncompleted elections discovered to us a manifestation of the national\r\nverdict more emphatic than, with the rarest exceptions, has been\r\nwitnessed during the whole of our Parliamentary history. The good cause\r\nwas further advanced towards its triumphant issue when the silent\r\nacknowledgment of the late government, that they declined to contest the\r\nquestion, was given by their retirement from office, and their choosing\r\na less responsible position from which to carry on a more desultory\r\nwarfare against the policy which they had in the previous session\r\nunsuccessfully attempted to resist. Another blow will soon be struck in\r\nthe same good cause, and I will not intercept it one single\r\nmoment more.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill passed by an overwhelming vote--368 against 250--and went up to\r\nthe Lords, where stirring debates occurred. But there, as well as in the\r\nHouse, the Irish Establishment was doomed. The bill, substantially\r\nunaltered, received the Royal assent July 26, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Register for 1869 declared that the bill \"was carried through\r\nin the face of a united and powerful opposition, mainly by the resolute\r\nwill and unflinching energy of the Prime Minister.... Upon the whole,\r\nwhatever may be thought of its merits or demerits, it can hardly be\r\ndisputed that the Act of the Disestablishment of the Irish Church,\r\nintroduced and carried into a law within somewhat less than five months,\r\nwas the most remarkable legislative achievement of modern times.\"\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary session of 1870 was rendered memorable by the passing\r\nof a scarcely less popular and important measure--the Irish Land Bill.\r\nMr. Gladstone, in speaking of Ireland, had referred to three branches of\r\nan Upas tree, to the growth of which her present sad condition was\r\nlargely owing--the Irish Church, the Irish Land Laws, and the Irish\r\nUniversities. The first branch had fallen with the disestablishment of\r\nthe Irish Church, and Mr. Gladstone, pressing on in his reform, now\r\nproposed to lop off the second branch by his Irish Land Bill, which was\r\nin itself a revolution. It was claimed for Mr. Gladstone's new bill, or\r\nLand Scheme, that while it insured for the tenant security of holding,\r\nit did not confiscate a single valuable right of the Irish land-owner.\r\nMr. Gladstone remarked that he believed there was a great fund of\r\nnational wealth in the soil of Ireland as yet undeveloped, and said he\r\ntrusted that both tenant and landlord would accept the bill because it\r\nwas just. The bill passed, and received the approval of the Queen,\r\nAugust 1, 1870.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Old Lion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN AGE OF LIBERALISM\r\n\r\nIn what has been denominated the \"Golden Age of Liberalism\" the Liberal\r\nparty was united, enthusiastic, victorious, full of energy, confidence\r\nand hope. \"I have not any misgivings about Gladstone personally,\" says\r\nan English writer, \"but as leader of the party to which the folly of the\r\nConservatives and the selfish treachery of Disraeli, bit by bit, allied\r\nhim, he cannot do what he would, and, with all his vast powers, there is\r\na want of sharp-sighted clearness as to others. But God rules. I do not\r\nsee how we are, after Disraeli's Reform Bill, long to avoid fundamental\r\nchanges, both in Church and State.\"\r\n\r\nJustin McCarthy has well summed up the aims of Mr. Gladstone and his\r\nparty on their accession to power: \"Nothing in modern English history is\r\nlike the rush of the extraordinary years of reforming energy on which\r\nthe new administration had now entered. Mr. Gladstone's government had\r\nto grapple with five or six great questions, any one of which might\r\nhave seemed enough to engage the whole attention of an ordinary\r\nadministration. The new Prime Minister had pledged himself to abolish\r\nthe State Church in Ireland, and to reform the Irish Land Tenure system.\r\nHe had made up his mind to put an end to the purchase of commissions in\r\nthe army. Recent events and experiences had convinced him that it was\r\nnecessary to introduce the system of voting by ballot. He accepted for\r\nhis government the responsibility of originating a complete system of\r\nnational education.\"\r\n\r\nThe first great measure of the new administration had been successfully\r\npushed through, and, flushed with triumph, the Liberal leaders were now\r\nready to introduce other important legislation. In 1870, the Elementary\r\nEducation Act, providing for the establishment of school boards, and\r\nsecuring the benefits of education for the poor in England and Wales was\r\nintroduced. By it a national and compulsory system of education was\r\nestablished for the first time. \"It is important to note that the\r\nconcessions made during its course to the convictions of Tories and\r\nChurchmen, in the matter of religious education, stirred the bitter and\r\nabiding wrath of the political Dissenters.\" The measure was passed,\r\nwhile the half-penny postage for newspapers, and the half-penny post\r\ncards were among the benefits secured.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1870, a party of English travelers in Greece were seized by\r\nbrigands. The ladies were released and also Lord Muncaster, who was sent\r\nto Athens to arrange for ransom and a free pardon. But the Greek\r\nGovernment sending soldiers to release the captives and capture the\r\ncaptors, the English were murdered. The English Minister at Athens was\r\nin treaty for the release of his countrymen, but the great difficulty\r\nwas to procure pardon from the Greek government. This terrible affair\r\ncreated a profound sensation in England, and it was brought before\r\nParliament. Mr. Gladstone pleaded for further information before taking\r\ndecided steps. But for the arrest and execution of most of the brigands,\r\nand the extirpation of the band, the diabolical deed went unavenged.\r\n\r\nIn July, war broke out suddenly between France and Germany, which\r\nresulted in the dethronement of Napoleon III. England preserved\r\nneutrality. However, Mr. Gladstone had his opinion regarding the war and\r\nthus represented it: \"It is not for me to distribute praise and blame;\r\nbut I think the war as a whole, and the state of things out of which it\r\nhas grown, deserve a severer condemnation than any which the nineteenth\r\ncentury has exhibited since the peace of 1815.\" And later, in an\r\nanonymous article, the only one he ever wrote, and which contained the\r\nfamous phrase, \"the streak of silver sea,\" he \"distributed blame with\r\ngreat impartiality between both belligerent powers.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the business transacted in the session of 1870 was the following:\r\nAll appointments to situations in all Civil Departments of the State,\r\nexcept the Foreign Office and posts requiring professional knowledge,\r\nshould be filled by open competition; and the royal prerogative that\r\nclaimed the General Commanding-in-Chief as the agent of the Crown be\r\nabolished, and that distinguished personage was formally declared to be\r\nsubordinate to the Minister of War. Mr. Gladstone announced the\r\nintention of the government to release the Fenian prisoners then\r\nundergoing sentences for treason or treason-felony, on condition of\r\ntheir not remaining in or returning to the United Kingdom. The Premier,\r\nalluding to the enormity of their offenses, said that the same\r\nprinciples of justice which dictated their sentences would amply\r\nsanction the prolongation of their imprisonment if the public security\r\ndemanded it. The press and country generally approved this decision of\r\nthe Premier, but some condemned him for the condition he imposed in the\r\namnesty. The religious test imposed upon all students entering at the\r\nuniversities was abolished, and all students of all creeds could now\r\nenter the universities on an equal footing. Heretofore special\r\nprivileges were accorded to members of the Established Episcopal Church,\r\nand all others were cut off from the full enjoyment of the\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nA bill to establish secret voting was rejected by the Lords, but was\r\npassed the next session. The House of Lords, emboldened by their success\r\nin throwing out the voting bill, defeated a bill to abolish the purchase\r\nof commissions in the army, but Mr. Gladstone was not to be turned from\r\nhis purpose, and startled the peers by a new departure--he dispensed\r\nwith their consent, and accomplished his purpose without the decision of\r\nParliament. Finding that purchase in the army existed only by royal\r\nsanction, he, with prompt decision, advised the Queen to issue a royal\r\nwarrant declaring that on and after November 1, 1871, all regulations\r\nattending the purchase of commissions should be cancelled. The purchase\r\nof official positions in the army was thus abolished. It was regarded as\r\na high-handed act on the part of the Prime Minister, and a stretch of\r\nexecutive authority, and was denounced by Lords and Commons, friends and\r\nfoes. Tories and Peers especially were enraged, and regarded themselves\r\nas baffled.\r\n\r\nThe condition of affairs in Ireland was alarming. The spread of an\r\nagrarian conspiracy at Westmeath compelled the government to move for a\r\ncommittee to inquire into the unlawful combination and confederacy\r\nexisting. \"Mr. Disraeli was severely sarcastic at the expense of the\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nThe grant proposed by the government to the Princess Louise on her\r\nmarriage aroused the opposition of some members of the House, who\r\nclaimed to represent the sentiments of a considerable number of people.\r\nIt was proposed to grant £30,000 and an annuity of £6,000. The Premier\r\nstated that the Queen in marrying her daughter to one of her own\r\nsubjects, had followed her womanly and motherly instincts. He dwelt upon\r\nthe political importance of supporting the dignity of the crown in a\r\nsuitable manner; upon the value of a stable dynasty; and the unwisdom of\r\nmaking minute pecuniary calculations upon such occasions. It was carried\r\nby a remarkable majority of 350 votes against 1.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the treaty of Washington was concluded. But the Geneva awards\r\nfor the damage done to American shipping by the \"Alabama,\" did much to\r\nundermine Mr. Gladstone's popularity with the warlike portion of the\r\nBritish public and there were various indications that the Ministry were\r\nbecoming unpopular. There were other causes tributary to this effect.\r\nHis plans of retrenchment had deprived Greenwich of much of its trade,\r\nhence his seat was threatened. Mr. Gladstone resolved to face the\r\ndifficulty boldly, and to meet the murmurers on their own ground,\r\nOctober 28, 1871, he addressed his Greenwich constituents. The air was\r\nheavy with murmurs and threats. Twenty thousand people were gathered at\r\nBlackheath. It was a cold afternoon when he appeared bare-headed, and\r\ndefended the whole policy of the administration. \"His speech was as\r\nlong, as methodical, as argumentative, and in parts as eloquent, as if\r\nhe had been speaking at his ease under the friendly and commodious\r\nshelter of the House of Commons.\" The growing unpopularity of the\r\nGovernment was evidenced in the first reception given to the Premier by\r\nhis constituents. Groans and cheers were mingled, and his voice at first\r\nwas drowned by the din. Finally he was heard, and won the day, the\r\npeople enthusiastically applauding and waving a forest of hats. One\r\ncause of unpopularity was what is called \"the Ewelme Scandal,\" and\r\nanother the elevation of Sir Robert Collin to the Judicial Committee of\r\nthe Privy Council.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone said: \"I have a shrewd suspicion in my mind that a very\r\nlarge proportion of the people of England have a sneaking kindness for\r\nthe hereditary principle. My observation has not been of a very brief\r\nperiod, and what I have observed is this, that wherever there is\r\nanything to be, done, or to be given, and there are two candidates for\r\nit who are exactly alike--alike in opinions, alike in character, alike\r\nin possessions, the one being a commoner and the other a lord--the\r\nEnglishman is very apt indeed to prefer the lord.\" He detailed the great\r\nadvantage which had accrued from the legislation of the past generation,\r\nincluding free-trade, the removal of twenty millions of taxation, a\r\ncheap press, and an education bill, Mr. Gladstone thus restored himself\r\nto the confidence of his constituents, but the ministry did not wholly\r\nregain the popularity they once enjoyed. The Gladstone period had passed\r\nits zenith and its decadence had already begun.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn Mr. Gladstone received the freedom of the city of\r\nAberdeen, and made a speech, in which occurred a remarkable reference to\r\n\"the newly-invented cry of Home Rule.\" He spoke of the political\r\nillusions to which Ireland was periodically subject, the extremes to\r\nwhich England had gone in satisfying her demands, and the removal of all\r\nher grievances, except that which related to higher education. He said\r\nthat any inequalities resting between England and Ireland were in favor\r\nof Ireland, and as to Home Rule, if Ireland was entitled to it, Scotland\r\nwas better entitled, and even more so Wales.\r\n\r\nIreland had proved the glory of Mr. Gladstone's administration. Its name\r\nhad been associated with the most brilliant legislative triumphs of\r\ngovernment. But Ireland was also destined to be the government's most\r\nserious stumbling-block, and fated to be the immediate measure of its\r\noverthrow. In the session of 1873 Mr. Gladstone endeavored to further\r\nhis plans for Reform, and consequently vigorously attacked the third\r\nbranch of the \"upas tree,\" to which he had referred. He labored to put\r\nthe universities on a proper basis, that they might be truly educational\r\ncentres for the whole of Ireland, and not for a small section of its\r\ninhabitants alone. This step followed legitimately after the\r\ndisestablishment of the Irish Church. He introduced to this end a large\r\nand comprehensive measure, but although it was favorably received at the\r\noutset, a hostile feeling soon began and manifested itself. Mr.\r\nGladstone pleaded powerfully for the measure, and said: \"To mete out\r\njustice to Ireland, according to the best view that with human infirmity\r\nwe could form, has been the work--I will almost say the sacred work--of\r\nthis Parliament. Having put our hands to the plough, let us not turn\r\nback. Let not what we think the fault or perverseness of those whom we\r\nare attempting to assist have the slightest effect in turning us, even\r\nby a hair's-breadth, from the path on which we have entered. As we begun\r\nso let us persevere, even to the end, and with firm and resolute hand\r\nlet us efface from the law and practice of the country the last--for I\r\nbelieve it is the last--of the religious and social grievances of\r\nIreland.\" Mr. Disraeli made fun of the bill, stalwart Liberals condemned\r\nit, and the Irish members voted against it, hence the bill was defeated\r\nby a small majority of three votes. Mr. Gladstone consequently resigned,\r\nbut Mr. Disraeli positively declined to take office with a majority of\r\nthe House of Commons against him, and refused to appeal to the country.\r\nMr. Gladstone read an extract from a letter he had addressed to the\r\nQueen, in which he contended that Mr. Disraeli's refusal to accept\r\noffice was contrary to all precedent. But under the extraordinary\r\ncircumstances he and his colleagues consented to resume office, and they\r\nwould endeavor to proceed, both with regard to legislation and\r\nadministration upon the same principle as those which had heretofore\r\nregulated their conduct. Mr. Lowe, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\r\nhaving resigned, Mr. Gladstone assumed the duties of the office himself,\r\nthus serving in the double offices of Premier and Chancellor. During the\r\nrecess various speeches were made in defence of the Ministerial policy,\r\nbut the government failed to recover its once overwhelming popularity.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July, 1873, Mr. Gladstone lost by sudden death one of his\r\noldest and most highly esteemed friends--Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of\r\nWinchester. He was riding to Holmbury with Earl Granville, when he was\r\nthrown from his horse and killed instantly.\r\n\r\nThe end of Mr. Gladstone's first ministry was now drawing near. The\r\npeople no longer desired to keep up with the reforming zeal of the\r\nadministration. Mr. Disraeli's strongly exaggerated description of the\r\nPremier's policy had the effect of forming the popular discontent;\r\nLiberal members were deserting him. The Bible was in danger of being\r\nleft out of the schools, and beer was threatened with taxation. The flag\r\nof \"Beer and the Bible\"--strange combination--having been hoisted by\r\nclergy and publicans, the cry against the ministry became irresistible.\r\nDeserted by the people and by many of his own party, what was to be done\r\nunless to appeal to the country and decide by a general election what\r\nwas wanted and who would be sustained.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1874, Mr. Gladstone issued a manifesto dissolving Parliament.\r\nIn this document, entitled to be called a State paper for its political\r\nand historical importance, Mr. Gladstone stated his reasons for what was\r\nregarded by many as a _coup d' tat_. It is impossible to describe the\r\npublic excitement and confusion which attended the general election thus\r\nunexpectedly decreed. Mr. Gladstone, recovering from a cold, appealed\r\nwith great energy to Greenwich for re-election. The general election\r\nresulted in the defeat of the Liberals, and gave to the Conservatives a\r\nmajority of forty-six in the House. Mr. Gladstone was elected, but\r\nGreenwich which returned two members, placed the Premier second on the\r\npoll--below a local distiller. Following the example of his\r\npredecessor, in 1868, Mr. Gladstone resigned. \"Thus was overthrown one\r\nof the greatest administrations of the century; indeed, it may be\r\ndoubted whether any other English Ministry was ever able to show such a\r\nsplendid record of great legislative acts within so short a period.\r\nThere was not one measure, but a dozen, which would have shed lustre\r\nupon any government; and the six years of Mr. Gladstone's first\r\nPremiership are well entitled to the epithet which has been accorded to\r\nthem of 'the Golden Age of Liberalism.'\"\r\n\r\nBefore the next Parliament met Mr. Gladstone was to give the country\r\nanother surprise. He was now sixty-four years old, had been forty years\r\nin active parliamentary labors, and thought himself justified in seeking\r\nrest from the arduous duties of public life, at least the pressing cares\r\nas leader of one of the great political parties. When his contemplated\r\nretirement had before become known to his friends, they induced him for\r\na while longer to act as leader, but in February, 1875, he finally\r\nretired from the leadership and indeed appeared but rarely in the House\r\nof Commons during that session.\r\n\r\n\"The retirement of Mr. Gladstone from active leadership naturally\r\nfilled his party with dismay. According to the general law of human\r\nlife, they only realized their blessings when they had lost them. They\r\nhad grumbled at their chief and mutinied against him and helped to\r\ndepose him. But, now that this commanding genius was suddenly withdrawn\r\nfrom their councils they found that they had nothing to put in its\r\nplace. Their indignation waxed fast and furious, and was not the less\r\nkeen because they had to some extent, brought their trouble on\r\nthemselves. They complained with almost a ludicrous pathos that Mr.\r\nGladstone had led them into a wilderness of opposition and left them\r\nthere to perish. They were as sheep without a shepherd and the ravening\r\nwolves of Toryism seemed to have it all their own way.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the time of Mr. Gladstone's retirement from the Premiership and\r\nhis resignation of leadership in the House, he had quickly reappeared in\r\nthe House of Commons and vigorously opposed the Public Worship\r\nRegulation Bill. Mr. Gladstone attacked the bill with a power and\r\nvehemence which astonished the House. The great objection to it was its\r\ninterference with liberty, and with the variety of customs which had\r\ngrown up in different parts of the country. To enforce strict uniformity\r\nwould be oppressive and inconvenient. The bill became law, however,\r\nthough it has largely proved inoperative, Mr. Gladstone also opposed the\r\nEndowed Schools Act Amendment Bill, which practically gave to the Church\r\nof England the control of schools that were thrown open to the whole\r\nnation by the policy of the last Parliament. So great a storm was raised\r\nover this reactionary bill that Mr. Disraeli was obliged to modify its\r\nprovisions considerably before it could become a law. Mr. Gladstone was\r\nalso active at this time in delivering addresses at Liverpool College,\r\nthe Buckley Institute and the well-known Nonconformist College at\r\nMill Hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. GLADSTONE'S MAIL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EASTERN QUESTION\r\n\r\nDuring his retirement from the leadership of the Liberal Party, Mr.\r\nGladstone employed his great abilities in theological controversy and\r\nliterary productions. It was during this period that he collected his\r\nmiscellaneous writings, entitled \"Gleanings from Past Years.\" A little\r\nmore than a year had elapsed when he again entered the political arena.\r\n\"He threw aside polemics and criticisms, he forgot for awhile Homer and\r\nthe Pope,\" and \"rushed from his library at Hawarden, forgetting alike\r\nancient Greece and modern Rome,\" as he flung himself with impassioned\r\nenergy and youthful vigor into a new crusade against Turkey. A quarter\r\nof a century before he had aroused all Europe with the story of the\r\nNeapolitan barbarities, and now again his keen sense of justice and\r\nstrong, humanitarian sympathies impel him with righteous indignation to\r\nthe eloquent defence of another oppressed people, and the denunciation\r\nof their wrongs. It was the Eastern Question that at once brought back\r\nthe Liberal leader into the domain of politics. \"The spirit of the\r\nwar-horse could not be quenched, and the country thrilled with his fiery\r\ncondemnation of the Bulgarian massacres.\" His activity was phenomenal.\r\n\"He made the most impassioned speeches, often in the open air; he\r\npublished pamphlets which rushed into incredible circulations; he poured\r\nletter after letter into the newspapers; he darkened the sky with\r\ncontroversial postcards, and, as soon as Parliament met in February,\r\n1877, he was ready with all his unequalled resources of eloquence,\r\nargumentation and inconvenient enquiry, to drive home his great\r\nindictment against the Turkish government and its champion, Mr.\r\nDisraeli, who had now become Lord Beaconsfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reason of all this passion is not difficult to discover. Mr.\r\nGladstone is a Christian; and in the Turk he saw the great\r\nanti-Christian power where it ought not, in the fairest provinces of\r\nChristendom, and stained with the record of odious cruelty practised\r\nthrough long centuries on its defenceless subjects who were worshippers\r\nof Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nTurkish oppression, which had for a long time existed in its worst\r\nforms, resulted in an insurrection against Turkey and Herzegovina,\r\nJuly 1, 1875. This, however, was only the beginning, for others suffering\r\nunder Ottoman oppression rebelled, and all Europe was involved.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1876, the Herzegovinians gained a victory over the Turkish\r\ntroops. The European powers then suggested a settlement favorable to the\r\ninsurgents, which was accepted by the Sultan. But early in May another\r\ninsurrection broke out in several Bulgarian villages, which was quickly\r\nfollowed by the most horrible atrocities. A conference on the Eastern\r\nquestion was held at Berlin in May, and soon afterward the English\r\nministers announced in Parliament that they were unable to assent to the\r\nterms agreed upon at the Berlin Conference. This announcement caused\r\nmuch surprise and comment in England. Public feeling already aroused,\r\nwas not allayed when it became known that the British fleet in the\r\nMediterranean had been ordered to Besiki Bay, seemingly for the\r\nprotection of the Turkish Empire.\r\n\r\nJune 28th the Bulgarian insurrection was suppressed. On the 10th of July\r\nthe Sultan, Abdul Aziz, was deposed and was succeeded by Murad V, who\r\ndeclared that he desired to guarantee liberty to all. Mr. Disraeli\r\nstated, in the House of Commons, that the steps taken by the Ministry\r\nwould lead to permanent peace. But within two weeks the _Daily News_\r\npublished a letter from Constantinople detailing the massacre in\r\nBulgaria by the Turks, which moved all England with indignation.\r\nInnocent men, women and children had been slaughtered by the thousands;\r\nat least sixty villages had been utterly destroyed; the most revolting\r\nscenes of violence had been enacted; and a district once the most\r\nfertile in the Empire had been laid waste and completely ruined. Forty\r\ngirls were shut up in a straw loft and burnt, and outrages of the most\r\nfearful description were committed upon hundreds of defenceless\r\ncaptives.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli, in the House of Commons, grew \"jocular upon the cruelties\r\nand sufferings almost unparalleled in the world's history,\" and\r\nexpressed his belief that the outrages committed by the Turkish troops\r\nhad been exaggerated, and sneered at the rumor as \"coffee-house babble;\"\r\nwhile as to the torture of the impalement, which had caused universal\r\nanger and disgust, that an Oriental people have their way of executing\r\nmalefactors, and generally terminated their connection with culprits in\r\nan expeditious manner.\r\n\r\nIn the official report presented to Parliament by Mr. W. Baring, the\r\nreported outrages in Bulgaria were corroborated. No fewer than 12,000\r\npersons had perished in the sandjak of Philippopolis! The most fearful\r\ntragedy, however, was at Batak, where over 1000 people took refuge in\r\nthe church and churchyard. The Bashi-Bazouks fired through the windows,\r\nand, getting upon the roof, tore off the tiles and threw burning pieces\r\nof wood and rags dipped in petroleum among the mass of unhappy human\r\nbeings inside. At last the door was forced in and the massacre was\r\ncompleted. The inside of the church was then burnt, and hardly one\r\nescaped. \"The massacre at Batak was the most heinous crime which stained\r\nthe history of the present century;\" and for this exploit the Turkish\r\nCommander, Achmet Agha, had bestowed on him the order of the Medjidie.\r\nSir Henry Elliot, the English Ambassador at Constantinople, was directed\r\nto lay these facts before the Sultan and to demand the punishment of the\r\noffenders. The demand, however, was never enforced.\r\n\r\nPrince Milan issued a proclamation to his people, declaring that, while\r\nprofessing neutrality, the Sultan had continued to send military forces\r\nof savage hordes to the Servian frontier. In June, Prince Milan left\r\nBelgrade and joined his army on the frontier. The Montenegrins declared\r\nwar on Turkey and joined forces with Servia. July 6th the Servians were\r\ndefeated. Thus was Turkey plunged into war with her Christian provinces,\r\nand all through her own misrule in peace and her barbarities in war.\r\n\r\nMr. Disraeli in a speech made in the House of Commons, August 11th,\r\nexplained that he had not denied the existence of the \"Bulgarian.\r\nAtrocities,\" but he had no official knowledge of them. He affirmed that\r\nGreat Britain was not responsible for what occurred in Turkey, nor were\r\nthe Turks the special _protégés_ of England. He announced that the\r\nspecial duty of the Government at that moment was to preserve the\r\nBritish Empire, and that they would never consent to any step that would\r\nhazard the existence of that empire, This speech, which was\r\ndistinguished by much of his old brilliancy and power, was his last\r\nspeech in the House. On the morning after this speech it was publicly\r\nannounced that Mr. Disraeli would immediately be elevated to the peerage\r\nunder the title of the Earl of Beaconsfield.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1876, deeming it high time that the indignant voice of\r\nEngland should be heard in demonstration of the infamous deeds practiced\r\nby the Turk, Mr. Gladstone issued his pamphlet, entitled \"Bulgarian\r\nHorrors and the Question of the East.\" It had an enormous circulation.\r\nHe called for a stop to be put to the anarchy, the misrule and the\r\nbloodshed in Bulgaria, and demanded that the Ottoman rule should be\r\nexcluded, not only from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also from Bulgaria.\r\nThe Turks must clear out, \"bag and baggage,\" from the provinces they\r\nhave desolated and profaned. The pamphlet, and the latter expression\r\nespecially, produced a great sensation.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet \"brought home to the English people the idea that for these\r\nhorrors which were going on, they too, as non-interfering allies of\r\nTurkey, were in part responsible.\" Soon after this Mr. Gladstone\r\naddressed a large concourse of his constituents at Blackheath, in which\r\nhe severely arraigned the Government. This address was one of the most\r\nimpassioned and eloquent of Mr. Gladstone's political orations, and at\r\nsome points the people were literally carried away with their feelings.\r\n\r\nNovember 1st, Turkey was forced by Russia to agree to an armistice of\r\neight weeks. On the 2d the Russian Emperor pledged his word to the\r\nEnglish Ambassador that he had no intention of acquiring Constantinople;\r\nthat if compelled to occupy Bulgaria, it would be only until the safety\r\nof the Christian inhabitants be secured; and urged the Ambassador to\r\nremove the distrust of Russia prevailing in England. Yet, in the face of\r\nall these assurances, Lord Beaconsfield delivered a war-like speech, at\r\nthe banquet at Guildhall, November 9th. Informed of this speech the Czar\r\ndeclared that if the Porte did not accede to his demands, Russia would\r\nthen act independently.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of December there was a great conference at St. James' Hall,\r\nLondon, to discuss the Eastern question. The Duke of Westminster\r\npresided at the afternoon meeting. At the evening gathering Lord\r\nShaftesbury occupied the chair. Mr. E. Freeman said: \"Perish the\r\ninterests of England, perish our dominion in India, sooner than we\r\nshould strike one blow or speak one word on behalf of the wrong against\r\nthe right.\" The chief interest of the occasion centered in the speech of\r\nMr. Gladstone who was received with unbounded applause. He declared that\r\nthere had been no change in public sentiment in England on the question;\r\nthat the promoters of that meeting had no desire to embarrass the\r\nGovernment; that the power and influence of England had been employed to\r\neffect results at variance with the convictions of the country; that\r\nLord Beaconsfield had only recently appeared anxious; and that England\r\nhad duties towards the Christian subjects of Turkey. Mr. Gladstone\r\ncontinued that he hoped that the instructions given to Lord Salisbury,\r\nwho had been sent for conference to Constantinople, were not in\r\naccordance with the speech at Guildhall, but that he would be left to\r\nhis own clear insight and generous impulses; that the conference would\r\ninsist upon the independence of the provinces, or at least would insure\r\nthem against arbitrary injustice and oppression, and that the work\r\nindicated was not merely a worthy deed but an absolute duty.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, during the recess of Parliament, delivered speeches upon\r\nthe burning question of the day all over England. At Hawarden he\r\npleaded that it was the wretched Turkish system that was at fault, and\r\nnot the Turks themselves, and hoped for a remedy. To the electors of\r\nFrome he spoke of the tremendous responsibility of the Ministers. In a\r\nspeech at the Taunton Railway Station, he said, in reference to the\r\ninjunction for himself and friends to mind their own business, that the\r\nEastern question was their own business. And when the Constantinople\r\nConference failed he spoke of this \"great transaction and woeful\r\nfailure,\" and laid all the blame of failure on the Ministry. As to the\r\ntreaties of 1856 being in force, his opinion was, that Turkey had\r\nentirely broken those treaties and trampled them under foot.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20, 1877, the conference closed. Parliament met February 8, 1877,\r\nand the conflict was transferred from the country to that narrower\r\narena. In the House of Lords the Duke of Argyle delivered a powerful\r\nspeech, to which the Premier, Disraeli, replied, that he believed that\r\nany interference directed to the alleviation of the sufferings of the\r\nTurkish Christians would only make their sufferings worse. He asked for\r\ncalm, sagacious and statesmanlike consideration of the whole subject,\r\nnever forgetting the great interests of England, if it was to have any\r\nsolution at all.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, upon his appearance in the House, was greeted as a Daniel\r\ncome to judgment. He was taken to task by Mr. Chaplin, who complained\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone and others of the Liberal party \"had endeavored to\r\nregulate the foreign policy of the country by pamphlets, by speeches at\r\npublic meetings, and by a so-called National Conference, instead of\r\nleaving it in the hands of the Executive Government,\" and intimated that\r\nMr. Gladstone was afraid to meet the House in debate upon the question.\r\nMr. Gladstone, rebuking Mr. Chaplain, said that it was the first time in\r\na public career extending over nearly half a century, he had been\r\naccused of a disinclination to meet his opponents in a fair fight, and\r\npromised him that neither he nor his friends would have reason to\r\ncomplain of his reticence. Tories and Liberals knew he had not shrunk\r\nfrom meeting the public on this question. He was glad that there was a\r\ntremendous feeling abroad upon this Eastern question. He had been told\r\nthat by the pamphlet he wrote and the speech he delivered, he had done\r\nall this mischief, and agitated Europe and the world; but if that were\r\nthe case why did not the honorable gentleman, by writing another\r\npamphlet, and delivering another speech, put the whole thing right? If\r\nhe (the speaker) had done anything, it was only in the same way that a\r\nman applies a match to an enormous mass of fuel already prepared. Mr.\r\nGladstone closed with the following words: \"We have, I think, the most\r\nsolemn and the greatest question to determine that has come before\r\nParliament in my time.... In the original entrance of the Turks into\r\nEurope, it may be said to have been a turning point in human history. To\r\na great extent it continues to be the cardinal question, the question\r\nwhich casts into the shade every other question.\"\r\n\r\nApril 24, 1877, war was declared by Russia against Turkey. The Czar\r\nissued a manifesto, assigning as reasons for this war the refusal of\r\nguarantee by the Porte for the proposed reforms, the failure of the\r\nConference and the rejection of the Proteol signed on the previous 31st\r\nof March. England, France and Italy proclaimed their neutrality. Mr.\r\nGladstone initiated a great debate in the House of Commons, May 7th,\r\nwhich lasted five days. He presented a series of resolutions expressing\r\ngrave dissatisfaction with the policy of Turkey, and declared that she\r\nhad forfeited all claim to support, moral and material. Mr. Gladstone\r\nasked whether, with regard to the great battle of freedom against\r\noppression then going on, \"we in England could lay our hands upon our\r\nhearts, and in the face of God and man, say, 'We have well and\r\nsufficiently performed our part?'\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were of course hostile to the Government, and many\r\nLiberals refused to vote for them, because they pledged England to a\r\npolicy of force in connection with Russia. Besides the Government gave\r\nassurances to avail themselves of any opportunity of interposing their\r\ngood offices. The resolutions consequently were lost. Mr. Gladstone was\r\nnot quite the leader of his party again.\r\n\r\nShortly after this debate, and before the close of the session, Mr.\r\nGladstone addressed a large meeting at Birmingham on the Eastern\r\nquestion and the present condition of the Liberal party. Later on he\r\nvisited Ireland. On his return he addressed, by their request, the\r\npeople gathered to receive him. He expressed his belief that Turkey\r\nwould have yielded to the concerted action of Europe; noticed the change\r\nin the tone of the ministry from the omission in the Premier's speech of\r\nthe phrase, \"the independence of Turkey;\" protested strongly against\r\nEngland being dragged into war, and warmly eulogized the non-conformists\r\nfor the consistency and unanimity with which they had insisted on\r\njustice to the Eastern Christians. Political feeling entered into\r\neverything at this time, but as an evidence of the hold Mr. Gladstone\r\nretained in the Scottish heart, he was in November elected Lord Rector\r\nof Glasgow University by a large majority. Lord Beaconsfield was the\r\nretiring Lord Rector, and the Conservatives nominated Sir S. Northcote,\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, as Mr. Gladstone's opponent.\r\n\r\nThe war in the East went disastrously for the Ottoman arms. January 23,\r\n1878, the Porte agreed to accept the terms of peace submitted by the\r\nGrand Duke Nicholas.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was invited January 30, 1878, to attend a meeting of\r\nundergraduates at Oxford, held to celebrate the formation of a Liberal\r\nPalmerston Club. He strongly condemned the sending of the British fleet\r\ninto the Dardanelles as a breach of European law; and confessed that he\r\nhad been an agitator for the past eighteen months, day and night, to\r\ncounteract what he believed to be the evil purposes of Lord\r\nBeaconsfield.\r\n\r\nIn February the House of Commons passed a vote of credit, but on the 3d\r\nof March a treaty of peace was signed between Turkey and Russia, at\r\nSanstefano, the terms of which in part were: Turkey to pay a large war\r\nindemnity; Servia and Montenegro to be independent and to receive\r\naccessions of territory; Bulgaria to be formed into a principality with\r\ngreatly extended boundaries, and to be governed by a prince elected by\r\nthe inhabitants; the navigation of the Straits was declared free for\r\nmerchant vessels, both in times of peace and war; Russian troops to\r\noccupy Bulgaria for two years; Batoum, Ardahan, Kars and Bayazid, with\r\ntheir territories, to be ceded to Russia, and Turkey to pay an indemnity\r\nto Roumania. The terms of the treaty were regarded oppressive to Turkey\r\nby the Beaconsfield Ministry, who proposed that the whole treaty be\r\nsubmitted to a congress at Berlin, to meet in June, 1878. The treaty was\r\napproved after some modifications. The English Plenipotentiaries were\r\nthe Earl of Beaconsfield and Marquis of Salisbury, who, for their share\r\nin the treaty, received a popular ovation and rewards from the Queen.\r\nThus was Turkey humiliated and Russia benefited, having obtained her\r\ndemands. To the people assembled Lord Beaconsfield said from the window\r\nof the Foreign Office: \"Lord Salisbury and myself have brought you back\r\npeace, but a peace, I hope with honor, which may satisfy our Sovereign\r\nand tend to the welfare of the country.\" But at this very time the envoy\r\nof Russia, whom the ministry thought to be circumvented, was entering\r\nthe Afghan capital; so that, although there was peace on the Bosphorus,\r\nas a direct result of the Eastern policy, there was war in Afghanistan.\r\nThe Conservatives were very ready for awhile to use as a watchword the\r\nphrase, \"Peace and Honor,\" but before long it became the occasion\r\nof ridicule.\r\n\r\nParliament was called upon to appropriate £8,000,000 to defray the cost\r\nof the Afghan and Zulu wars. When Mr. Gladstone's government retired\r\nfrom office, there was a surplus of over £3,000,000, but the budgets of\r\n1878 and 1879 both showed large deficits. The people had applauded the\r\n\"imperial policy,\" \"the jingoism\" of Lord Beaconsfield's administration\r\nduring the past two or three years, but they were not so appreciative\r\nwhen they found it so costly a policy to themselves. The depression in\r\nbusiness also had its effect upon the country. The unpopularity of the\r\nLiberal government, which culminated in its defeat in 1873, was now, in\r\n1879, being shifted to their Conservative opponents, whose term of\r\noffice was fast drawing to a close.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone's resolute and splendid hostility to Lord Beaconsfield's\r\nwhole system of foreign policy restored him to his paramount place among\r\nEnglish politicians. For four years--from 1876 to 1880--he sustained the\r\nhigh and holy strife with an enthusiasm, a versatility, a courage and a\r\nresourcefulness which raised the enthusiasm of his followers to the\r\nhighest pitch, and filled his guilty and baffled antagonists with a rage\r\nwhich went near to frenzy. By frustrating Lord Beaconsfield's design of\r\ngoing to war on behalf of Turkey, he saved England from the indelible\r\ndisgrace of a second and more gratuitous Crimea. But it was not only in\r\nEastern Europe that his saving influence was felt. In Africa and India,\r\nand wherever British honor was involved, he was the resolute and\r\nunsparing enemy of that odious system of bluster and swagger and might\r\nagainst right, on which Lord Beaconsfield and his colleagues bestowed\r\nthe tawdry nickname of Imperialism.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. GLADSTONE ON HIS WAY HOME]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDLOTHIAN AND THE SECOND PREMIERSHIP\r\n\r\nThe leadership of the Liberal party had, upon the retirement of Mr.\r\nGladstone, been turned over to Lord Hartington. His sympathies were upon\r\nthe right side on the Eastern question, but he was a calm, slow-moving\r\nman. At the proper time he would have taken the right measures in\r\nParliament, but the temper of the Liberal party and of the people\r\ndemanded present action and emphatic speech, then Mr. Gladstone came to\r\nthe rescue, and Lord Hartington found himself pushed aside. Mr.\r\nGladstone was again in fact the leader of the Liberal party, whose\r\nstandard he had carried aloft during those stirring times when the\r\nEastern question was the all-absorbing topic of debate in Parliament and\r\namong the people of the land. The foreign policy of Lord Beaconsfield in\r\n1878 and 1879 found a sleepless critic in Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nThe day after the Parliament of 1878 had adjourned for the Easter\r\nrecess, it was announced that the Ministry had ordered the Indian\r\nGovernment to dispatch 7000 native troops to the Island of Malta. The\r\norder occasioned much discussion--political, legal, and constitutional.\r\nIt was warmly debated. It was thought that Lord Beaconsfield had\r\ntranscended his powers and done what could be done only by a vote of\r\nParliament. In the House of Commons Mr. Gladstone condemned the\r\nproceedings as unconstitutional, and pointed out the dangers of the\r\nMinisterial policy. Lord Beaconsfield received what he calculated\r\nupon--the support of the House. For a member to differ from his policy\r\nwas almost to incur the imputation of disloyalty to Crown and country.\r\nIndeed, Mr. Gladstone was seriously accused of treason by a member of\r\nthe House for an article in the _Nineteenth Century_.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone undauntedly continued the contest. He addressed a meeting\r\nof Liberals in the Drill Hall, Bermondsey, July 20th, in which he said\r\nthat the Dissolution of Parliament could not long be postponed, and\r\nurged the union and organization of all Liberals, and prompt measures to\r\nsecure such representation as the Liberals deserved in the coming\r\nParliament. Speaking of the Anglo-Turkish treaty, he pointed out the\r\nserious obligations which devolved upon England under it. He added,\r\nregarding the Turkish Convention, that, possibly it was necessary to\r\nsustain the credit of the country, but whether that credit should be\r\nsustained at such a price remained for the people to determine at the\r\npolls. He rejoiced that these most unwise, extravagant, unwarrantable,\r\nunconstitutional and dangerous proceedings had not been the work of the\r\nLiberal party, but he was grieved to think that any party should be\r\nfound in England to perform such transactions.\r\n\r\nA great debate arose in the House of Commons, extending over the whole\r\nrange of the Eastern question: The Treaty of Berlin, the Anglo-Turkish\r\nConvention, the acquisition of Cyprus, the claims of Greece, etc. It was\r\nbegun by the Marquis of Hartington, who offered a resolution regretting\r\nthe grave responsibilities the Ministry had assumed for England with no\r\nmeans of securing their fulfillment, and without the previous knowledge\r\nof Parliament. Mr. Gladstone's speech during this debate is described as\r\n\"a long and eloquent address, unsurpassable for its comprehensive grasp\r\nof the subject, its lucidity, point, and the high tone which animated it\r\nthroughout.\" Mr. Gladstone denied that his strictures upon the\r\nGovernment in a speech made out of Parliament could be construed as Lord\r\nBeaconsfield had taken them as a personal attack and provocation. If\r\ncriticism of this kind is prohibited the doors of the House might as\r\nwell be shut. He observed that, \"Liberty of speech is the liberty which\r\nsecures all other liberties, and the abridgment of which would render\r\nall other liberties vain and useless possessions.\" In discussing the\r\nCongress at Berlin, Mr. Gladstone said, that he could not shut his eyes\r\nto the fact that the Sclavs, looking to Russia had been freed, while the\r\nGreeks, looking to England, remained with all their aspirations\r\nunsatisfied; that Russia had secured much territory and large indemnity,\r\nwith the sanction of Europe; that the English Plenipotentiaries at the\r\nCongress, Lord Salisbury and Lord Beaconsfield, as a general rule, took\r\nthe side of servitude, and that opposed to freedom.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the English responsibilities in Asiatic Turkey put upon\r\nEngland at the Convention, he called them an \"unheard of,\" and\r\n\"mad-undertaking,\" accomplished \"in the dark,\" by the present Ministry.\r\nDealing with the treaty-making power of the country, he claimed that it\r\nrested with Parliament in conjunction with the Executive. The strength\r\nand the eloquence were on the side of the opposition, but the votes were\r\nfor the Government. The resolutions of Lord Hartington were defeated,\r\nand the \"imperial policy\" of the Ministry was sustained. The _Spectator_\r\nsaid, that, \"Reason, prudence, and patriotism have hardly ever in our\r\ntimes been voted down with so little show of argument, and even of\r\nplausible suggestion.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step taken by the Ministry was to undertake war with\r\nAfghanistan, in hopes of checking the advances of Russia in that\r\ndirection and of redressing grievances. England accomplished her purpose\r\nin part, but greatly suffered for her exploit. Mr. Gladstone could not\r\nremain quiet under the \"adventurous policy\" of the Premier. He condemned\r\nthe ministerial policy which had made the Queen an Empress, then\r\nmanipulated the prerogative in a manner wholly unexampled in this age,\r\nand employed it in inaugurating policies about which neither the nation\r\nnor the Parliament had ever been consulted. But arguments were of no\r\navail. The Conservative majority in Parliament had imbibed the idea that\r\nthe honor of England had to be protected. Some thought it had never been\r\nassailed, but Lord Beaconsfield declared it was in peril, and men and\r\nmoney were voted to defend it. \"So the order was given for distant\r\npeoples to be attacked, English blood to be spilled, the burdens of the\r\npeople, already too heavy, to be swollen, and the future liabilities of\r\nthis country to be enormously increased.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Lord Beaconsfield, speaking of\r\nEastern affairs, said that the Government was not afraid of any invasion\r\nof India by its northwestern frontier; but the frontier was \"haphazard\r\nand not a scientific one,\" and the Government wanted a satisfactory\r\nfrontier. Mr. Gladstone, in a letter to the Bedford Liberal Association,\r\nasked: \"What right have we to annex by war, or to menace the territory\r\nof our neighbors, in order to make 'scientific' a frontier which is\r\nalready safe?\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1879 Mr. Gladstone, having resolved to retire from the\r\nrepresentation of Greenwich at the next election, paid a farewell visit\r\nto his constituents. At a luncheon given by the Liberal Association he\r\ndwelt upon the necessity of a Liberal union. The Liberals had, owing to\r\ntheir dissensions, given twenty-six votes to their opponents in 1874,\r\nwhile the Government had been carried on for years by a Conservative\r\nmajority of less than twenty-six, showing the importance of\r\norganization. At night Mr. Gladstone attended a great public meeting in\r\nthe Plumstead Skating Rink. On his entrance the whole audience rose and\r\ncheered for several minutes. An address was presented, expressing regret\r\nat his retirement, and the pride they would ever feel at having been\r\nassociated with his name and fame. Mr. Gladstone alluded to Lord\r\nBeaconsfield's phrase respecting \"harassed interests,\" and said he knew\r\nof only one harassed interest, and that was the British nation. He\r\nprotested against the words \"personal government\" being taken to imply\r\nthat the Sovereign desired to depart from the traditions of the\r\nconstitution, yet he charged the advisers of the Crown with having\r\ninvidiously begun a system intended to narrow the liberties of the\r\npeople of England and to reduce Parliament to the condition of the\r\nFrench Parliaments before the great Revolution.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone threw the whole responsibility of the Afghan war on the\r\nMinistry, and maintaining that England had departed from the customs of\r\nthe forefathers, concluded as follows: \"It is written in the eternal\r\nlaws of the universe of God that sin shall be followed by suffering. An\r\nunjust war is a tremendous sin. The question which you have to consider\r\nis whether this war is just or unjust. So far as I am able to collect\r\nthe evidence, it is unjust.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1878, the following resolution was offered in the House of\r\nCommons: \"That this House disapproves the conduct of her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, which has resulted in the war with Afghanistan.\" Mr.\r\nGladstone strongly condemned the war with Afghanistan and the irritating\r\npolicy towards the Ameer, and concluded his address with the following\r\neloquent responses to the historical and moral aspects of the Afghan\r\ndifficulty: \"You have made this war in concealment from Parliament, in\r\nreversal of the policy of every Indian and Home Government that has\r\nexisted for the last twenty-five years, in contempt of the supplication\r\nof the Ameer and in defiance of the advice of your own agent, and all\r\nfor the sake of obtaining a scientific frontier.\" This powerful speech\r\ngreatly impressed, for the moment, both parties in the House, but the\r\nvote of censure was defeated, and the policy of the administration was\r\nendorsed. During the debate Mr. Latham made a witty comparison. He said\r\nthat the Cabinet reminded him of the gentleman, who seeing his horses\r\nrun away, and being assured by the coachman that they must drive into\r\nsomething, replied, \"Then smash into something cheap!\"\r\n\r\nThe Ministry presented a motion that the revenues of India should be\r\napplied for the purposes of the war. Mr. Gladstone observed that it was\r\nthe people of England who had had all the glory and all the advantage\r\nwhich resulted from the destruction of the late administration, and the\r\naccession of the present Cabinet; and hence it was the people who must\r\nmeasure the _pros_ and the _cons_, and who must be content, after having\r\nreaped such innumerable benefits, to encounter the disadvantage of\r\nmeeting charges which undoubtedly the existing government would leave\r\nbehind it as a legacy to posterity. England gained her end in the\r\nhumiliation of Russia, but there were those who felt that the result of\r\nthe English policy would further the advance of Russia in Europe, and\r\nthat force would never make friends of the Afghans.\r\n\r\nIn the sessions of 1879 the Greek question came up in the House of\r\nCommons on a motion, \"That, in the opinion of this House, tranquillity\r\nin the East demands that satisfaction be given to the just claims of\r\nGreece, and no satisfaction can be considered adequate that does not\r\nensure execution of the recommendations embodied in Protocol 13 of the\r\nBerlin Congress.\" Mr. Gladstone hoped that even in the present House\r\nthere would be found those who would encourage the first legitimate\r\naspirations of the Hellenic races after freedom. The government had\r\ngiven pledges to advance the claims of Greece that had not been redeemed\r\nat Berlin. Not one of the European powers was now averse to the claims\r\nof the Greek kingdom, whose successful pleadings depended wholly upon\r\nEngland for favorable answer. But the government objected, and the\r\nmotion was rejected. In July, Sir Charles Dilke called the attention of\r\nthe House to the obligations of Turkey under the Treaty of Berlin, when\r\nMr. Gladstone again earnestly enforced the claims of \"Greece, weak as\r\nshe may be, is yet strong in the principles in which she rests.\"\r\n\r\nDecember 29, 1879, Mr. Gladstone attained the seventieth year of his\r\nage. His friends in Liverpool, and the Greenwich Liberal Association\r\npresented him with congratulatory addresses. The journals paid him warm\r\ntributes for his long and eminent public services. But few thought that\r\nthe veteran that had so successfully gone through one electoral campaign\r\nwas destined in a few months to pass through another, still more\r\nremarkable, and yet be fresh for new triumphs. In the autumn of 1879 Mr.\r\nGladstone resolved upon a very important, and as his enemies thought, a\r\nhopeless step. He had retired from the representation of Greenwich, and\r\nhe now boldly decided to contest the election for Midlothian, the county\r\nof Edinburgh. He consequently proceeded to Scotland, in November, where\r\nsuch an ovation was given him as has never been accorded to any man in\r\nmodern times. During the period of three weeks he addressed meetings\r\nnumbering seventy-five thousand people, while a quarter of a million of\r\npeople, with every exhibition of good-will and admiration, took part in\r\nsome way in the demonstration in his honor. In this canvass of\r\ndelivering political speeches he performed an oratorical and\r\nintellectual feat unparalleled in the history of any statesman who had\r\nattained his seventieth year. Mr. Gladstone addressed large concourses\r\nof people. When he reached Edinburgh, \"his progress was as the progress\r\nof a nation's guest, or a king returning to his own again.\"\r\n\r\nMidlothian, the scene of Mr. Gladstone's astonishing exertions, was one\r\nof the Conservative strongholds, under the dominent influence of the\r\nDuke of Buccleuch, whose son, Lord Dalkeith, Mr. Gladstone opposed in\r\ncontesting for the representation in Parliament. Mr. Gladstone said:\r\n\"Being a man of Scotch blood, I am very much attached to Scotland, and\r\nlike even the Scottish accent,\" and he afterwards said, \"and Scotland\r\nshowed herself equally proud of her son.\" He spoke at Edinburgh,\r\nNovember 26th, and on the following day at Dalkeith, in the very heart\r\nof the Duke of Buccleuch's own property to an audience of three thousand\r\npeople, mostly agriculturists. At Edinburgh he met nearly five thousand\r\npersons at the Corn Exchange, representing more than one hundred\r\nScottish Liberal Associations. In the Waverley Market Mr. Gladstone\r\naddressed more than twenty thousand people, one of the largest\r\ncongregations ever assembled in-doors in Scotland, and met with a\r\nreception which for enthusiasm was in keeping with the vastness of the\r\naudience. December 5th, at Glasgow, he delivered his address as Lord\r\nRector to the students of the University, and in the evening addressed\r\nan immense audience of nearly six thousand in St. Andrew's Hall. He was\r\nmost enthusiastically received, and he dwelt chiefly on Cyprus, the Suez\r\nCanal, India, and Afghanistan. \"We had Afghanistan ruined,\" he urged,\r\n\"India not advanced, but thrown back in government, subjected to heavy\r\nand unjust charges, subjected to what might well be termed, in\r\ncomparison with the mild government of former years, a system of\r\noppression; and with all this we had at home the law broken and the\r\nrights of Parliament invaded.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of March, 1880, the immediate dissolution of Parliament was\r\nannounced in both Houses of Parliament, and the news created intense\r\npolitical excitement and activity throughout the land. In his manifesto,\r\nin the shape of a letter to the Duke of Marlborough, the Prime Minister\r\nreferred to the attempt made to sever the constitutional tie between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, and said: \"It is to be hoped that all men of\r\nlight and leading will resist this destructive doctrine. There are some\r\nwho challenge the expediency of the Imperial character of this realm.\r\nHaving attempted and failed to enfeeble our colonies by their policy of\r\ndecomposition, they may now perhaps recognize in the disintegration of\r\nthe United Kingdom a mode which will not only accomplish, but\r\nprecipitate, that purpose. Peace rests on the presence, not to say the\r\nascendency, of England in the councils of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone and Lord Hartington issued their counter-manifestoes. Mr.\r\nGladstone repudiated Lord Beaconsfield's dark allusion to the repeal of\r\nthe union and the abandonment of the colonies, characterizing them as\r\nbase insinuations, the real purpose of which was to hide from view the\r\npolicy pursued by the Ministry, and its effect upon the condition of\r\nthe country; and said that public distress had been aggravated by\r\ncontinual shocks from neglected legislation at home, \"while abroad they\r\nhad strained the prerogative by gross misuse, had weakened the Empire by\r\nneedless wars, and dishonored it in the eyes of Europe by their\r\nclandestine acquisition of the Island of Cyprus.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone began the electoral campaign with a speech at Marylebone\r\non the 10th of March, in which he announced Lord Derby's secession from\r\nthe Conservative to the Liberal party; and then he left London to enter\r\nupon his second Midlothian campaign. At various points on the journey\r\nMr. Gladstone stopped and addressed the people from the cars, and it is\r\na remarkable fact that wherever he delivered an address the Liberals\r\ngained a seat.\r\n\r\nThe first address made by Mr. Gladstone on his own account, was\r\ndelivered on the 17th of March, in the Music Hall, Edinburgh. After\r\ndwelling at great length upon various questions of foreign policy, he\r\nconcluded with the following references personal to his opponents and\r\nhimself: \"I give them credit for patriotic motives; I give them credit\r\nfor those patriotic motives which are incessantly and gratuitously\r\ndenied to us. I believe that we are all united, gentlemen--indeed it\r\nwould be most unnatural if we were not--in a fond attachment, perhaps in\r\nsomething of a proud attachment, to the great country to which\r\nwe belong.\"\r\n\r\nIn his final speech at West Calder Mr. Gladstone drew a powerful\r\nindictment against the administration, and placed the issue before the\r\ncountry in a strong light. Throughout all the campaign, as the time for\r\nthe general election was approaching, only one question was submitted to\r\nthe electors, \"Do you approve or condemn Lord Beaconsfield's system of\r\nforeign policy?\" And the answer was given at Easter, 1880, when the\r\nPrime Minister and his colleagues received the most empathic\r\ncondemnation which had ever been bestowed upon an English Government,\r\nand the Liberals were returned in an overwhelming majority of fifty over\r\nTories and Home Rulers combined. Mr. Gladstone succeeded in ousting Lord\r\nDalkeith from the representation of Midlothian by a respectable\r\nmajority. He was also elected at Leeds, but this seat was afterwards\r\ngiven to his son, Herbert Gladstone. At the conclusion of the election\r\nall the journals joined in admiring the indomitable energy and vigor of\r\nthe orator, who could carry out this great enterprise when he had\r\nalready passed the age of three-score years and ten. Edinburgh was\r\nilluminated in the evening, and everywhere were to be witnessed signs of\r\nrejoicing at Mr. Gladstone's victory. The result of the elections\r\nthroughout the country exceeded the most sanguine expectations of the\r\nLiberals. So large a proportion of Liberal members had not been returned\r\nto the House of Commons since the days of the first Reform Bill.\r\n\r\nLord Beaconsfield, as soon as the result of the election was known, and\r\nwithout waiting for the meeting of Parliament, resigned. The Queen, in\r\nconformity with the constitutional custom, summoned Lord Hartington, the\r\ntitular leader of the Liberal party in the House of Commons, to form a\r\ncabinet. But he could do nothing. Then the Queen sent for Lord\r\nGranville, who with Lord Hartington, went to Windsor April 23d. They\r\nboth assured the Queen that the victory was Mr. Gladstone's; that the\r\npeople had designated him for office, and that the Liberal party would\r\nbe satisfied with no other, and that he was the inevitable Prime\r\nMinister. They returned to London in the afternoon, sought Mr. Gladstone\r\nat Harley Street, where he was awaiting the message they brought from\r\nthe Queen--to repair to Windsor. That evening, without an hour's delay,\r\nhe went to Windsor, kissed hands, and returned to London Prime Minister\r\nfor the second time.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone again filled the double office of Premier and Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer in the new cabinet, which for general ability and\r\ndebating power was one of the strongest of the century. While some of\r\nthe cabinet officers were like Mr. Gladstone himself, without title,\r\nothers were representatives of the oldest nobility of the land. At the\r\nvery beginning the new administration were confronted by perplexing\r\nquestions. The Eastern question, chiefly by Mr. Gladstone's influence,\r\nhad been settled in accordance with the dictates of humanity and\r\nreligion. But there were other difficulties to be overcome. \"At home,\r\nhis administration did good and useful work, including the extension of\r\nthe suffrage to the agricultural laborers; but it was seriously, and at\r\nlength fatally, embarrassed by two controversies which sprang up with\r\nlittle warning, and found the Liberal party and its leaders totally\r\nunprepared to deal with them.\"\r\n\r\nThe first embarrassing question which arose when the new Parliament met\r\nwas the great deficit of nine million pounds instead of an expected\r\nsurplus in the Indian Budget, owing to the Afghan war.\r\n\r\nForemost among the difficulties encountered was the case of Mr. Charles\r\nBradlaugh, elected a member of Parliament for Northampton. He demanded\r\nto be permitted to make a solemn affirmation or declaration of\r\nallegiance, instead of taking the usual oath. The question created much\r\ndiscussion and great feeling, and Mr. Bradlaugh's persistence was met by\r\nviolence. Mr. Bright contended for liberty of conscience. Mr. Gladstone\r\nfavored permitting Mr. Bradlaugh to affirm on his own responsibility\r\nwhich was finally done, but Mr. Bradlaugh was prosecuted in the courts.\r\nThe great difficulty arose from Mr. Bradlaugh's atheism.\r\n\r\nA considerable share of the session of 1880 was occupied in the\r\nconsideration of the Irish Compensation for Disturbance Bill and other\r\nIrish measures. In consequence of the rapid increase of evictions by\r\nlandlords, this protective measure had become absolutely necessary in\r\nthe interests of the Irish tenants. After prolonged debate--very\r\nprolonged for so short a bill--thirty-five lines only--the bill was\r\npassed by the Commons, but defeated by the Lords. The result was \"seen\r\nin a ghastly record of outrage and murder which stained the\r\nfollowing winter.\"\r\n\r\nHome Rule for Ireland, which movement was started in the \"seventies,\"\r\nwas gaining ground, and every election returned to the House more\r\nmembers pledged to its support. Those who were bent upon obtaining Home\r\nRule at any cost used obstructive means against other legislation to\r\ngain their object, but as yet the movement was confined to the members\r\nwho had been elected by Irish constituents.\r\n\r\nAbout the close of the session of 1880 the heavy burdens and\r\nresponsibilities of public service borne by Mr. Gladstone began to tell\r\nupon him. At the end of July, while returning from home for the House\r\nof Commons, Mr. Gladstone was taken ill. He was prostrated by fever and\r\ngreat fears for his recovery were entertained by his family, his party\r\nand a host of admirers throughout the country. A great outburst of\r\npopular sympathy was manifested and frequent messages were received from\r\nthe Queen and many foreign potentates and celebrities. Distinguished\r\ncallers and telegrams continued to arrive at Downing Street for ten days\r\nwhile the patient was confined to his bed at home. The President of the\r\nUnited States and the King and Queen of the Belgians were among those\r\nwho sent messages of sympathy. \"Rarely indeed, if ever, has there been\r\nwitnessed such a general and spontaneous expression of the national\r\nsympathy towards a distinguished statesman whose life had been\r\nimperilled by illness.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's large store of vital energy brought him safely through\r\nhis dangerous illness and on approaching convalescence he took a sea\r\nvoyage round the entire coast of England in Sir Donald Currie's steamer,\r\n\"Grantully Castle.\"\r\n\r\nThree years after this voyage around England the Premier visited the\r\nOrkneys on a similar trip, in the \"Pembroke Castle,\" the poet laureate\r\nbeing of the party on this occasion. From the Orkneys he sailed across\r\nto Denmark and suddenly appeared at Copenhagen, where Mr. Gladstone\r\nentertained the Czar and Czarina, the King of Greece, and the King and\r\nQueen of Denmark, and many others of their relatives who happened to be\r\nvisiting them at that time.\r\n\r\nA great meeting was held June 21, 1880, in Her Majesty's opera house,\r\nfor the purpose of presenting an address from the Liberals of Middlesex\r\nto Mr. Herbert Gladstone, who had made a gallant contest in that country\r\nat the general election. The entrance of the Premier some time after the\r\nmeeting began was the signal for an outburst of enthusiasm. Before Mr.\r\nGladstone appeared, the chairman, Mr. Foster, had paid a high tribute to\r\nthe Premier for his great abilities and his self-denial in the public\r\nservice. After his son had received the address, the Premier arose to\r\nspeak, when the whole audience arose to their feet and welcomed him with\r\nimmense cheering.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone referred at length to the Midlothian campaign, and paid a\r\ntribute to the spirit and energy of the Liberals of the whole country.\r\nThe sound which went forth from Midlothian reverberated through the land\r\nand was felt to be among the powerful operative causes which led to the\r\ngreat triumph of the Liberal party.\r\n\r\nAt the Lord Mayor's banquet, November 9, 1880, Mr. Gladstone's speech\r\nwas looked forward to with much anxiety, owing to the singularly\r\ndisturbed condition of Ireland. Referring to the \"party of disorder\" in\r\nIreland, he said that as anxious as the government was to pass laws for\r\nthe improvement of the land laws, their prior duty was to so enforce the\r\nlaws as to secure order. If an increase of power was needed to secure\r\nthis, they would not fail to ask it.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, at the Lord Mayor's banquet, Mr. Gladstone said that he was\r\nglad to discern signs of improvement in Ireland during the last twelve\r\nmonths; but the struggle between the representatives of law and the\r\nrepresentatives of lawlessness had rendered necessary an augmentation of\r\nthe executive power.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1881, at Greenwich, the Liberals of the borough presented Mr.\r\nGladstone with an illustrated address and a carved oak chair as a token\r\nof their esteem and a souvenir of his former representation of their\r\nborough. On the cushion back of the chair were embossed in gold the arms\r\nof Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, with a motto \"Fide et Virtute,\" and above, in\r\nthe midst of some wood-carving representing the rose, the thistle, the\r\nshamrock, and the leek, was a silver plate, bearing a suitable\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary session of 1881 was almost exclusively devoted to\r\nIrish affairs. Instead of the contemplated Land Act, the ministry were\r\ncompelled, on account of the disturbed condition of Ireland, to bring\r\nin first a Coercion Act, although the measure was naturally distasteful\r\nto such friends of Ireland in the Cabinet as Mr. Gladstone and Mr.\r\nBright. Property and life had become very insecure, and there was a\r\nstartling increase of agrarian crime that such a measure was deemed\r\nnecessary. But while passing the Coercion Act, Mr. Gladstone accompanied\r\nit by a great and beneficial measure--a second Irish Land Bill, which\r\ninstituted a court for the purpose of dealing with the differences\r\nbetween landlord and tenant.\r\n\r\nThis bill--one of Mr. Gladstone's greatest measures--became a law August\r\n23, 1881. Mr. Gladstone in his speech remarked that the complaint was\r\nmade that the bill was an infringement of liberty in Ireland and was\r\naimed at the Land League, but no person or body could be touched by the\r\nbill unless they violated the law, and then could only be arrested upon\r\nreasonable suspicion of crime committed or of inciting to crime or of\r\ninterfering with law or order. There would be the fullest freedom of\r\ndiscussion allowed. Dealing with the Land League he said it had been\r\nattempted to compare it with the Corn Laws, but Mr. Bright had\r\ncompletely demolished that miserable argument. It was compared also to\r\nthe trade unions, but they made an onward step in the intelligence and\r\nin the love of law and order among the working classes. They had never\r\ntainted themselves by word or deed which would bring them into suspicion\r\nin connection with the maintenance of law. The leaders of the Land\r\nLeague were now put forward as martyrs on the same platform as\r\nO'Connell; but on every occasion of his life-long agitation O'Connell\r\nset himself to avoid whatever might tend to a breach of law and order.\r\nThen Mr. Gladstone showed the necessity of the Coercion Act from the\r\ncondition of Ireland, where during the past year there had been a great\r\nincrease of crime, and the outrages were agrarian, and not connected\r\nwith the distress. It was a significant fact that the agrarian outrages\r\nhad risen and fallen with the meetings of the Land League. Nothing could\r\nbe more idle than to confound the agrarian crime of Ireland with the\r\nordinary crime of England, or even of Ireland. In regard to general\r\ncrime, Ireland held a high and honorable place, but how different was\r\nthe case with agrarian crime! He referred to the miscarriage of justice\r\nin Ireland, and said that the bill, if passed, would restore to Ireland\r\nthe first conditions of Christian and civilized existence. But it \"only\r\nirritated while it failed to terrify.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's was a great speech and showed his mastery of details,\r\nand his power of expounding and illustrating broad and general\r\nprinciples. He began his exposition by confessing that it was the most\r\ndifficult question with which he had ever been called upon to deal. He\r\nconcluded with an eloquent invocation to justice.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April, 1881, Lord Beaconsfield died. For many years he\r\nand Mr. Gladstone had been at the head of their respective parties.\r\n\"Their opposition, as one critic has well and tersely put it, like that\r\nof Pitt and Fox, was one of temperament and character as well as of\r\ngenius, position and political opinions.\" The Premier paid an eloquent\r\ntribute to him and proposed a public funeral, which was declined. Mr.\r\nGladstone then moved for a monument in Westminster Abbey to the memory\r\nof the deceased Earl.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1881, Mr. Gladstone made a visit to Leeds, for which borough\r\nhe was returned in 1880, but for which his son Herbert sat. He delivered\r\nseveral important addresses on subjects which then absorbed the public\r\nattention, especially dealing with the land question local government,\r\nand Free Trade _versus_ Fair Trade. Mr. Gladstone said:\r\n\r\n\"My boyhood was spent at the mouth of the Mersey, and in those days I\r\nused to see those beautiful American liners, the packets between New\r\nYork and Liverpool, which then conducted the bulk and the pick of the\r\ntrade between the two countries. The Americans were then deemed to be\r\nso entirely superior to us in shipbuilding and navigation that they had\r\nfour-fifths of the whole trade between the two countries in their hands,\r\nand that four-fifths was the best of the trade. What is the case now,\r\nwhen free trade has operated and has applied its stimulus to the\r\nintelligence of England, and when, on the other hand, the action of the\r\nAmericans has been restrained by the enactment, the enhancement and the\r\ntightening of the protective system? The scales are exactly reversed,\r\nand instead of America doing four-fifths and that the best, we do\r\nfour-fifths of the business, and the Americans pick up the leavings of\r\nthe British and transact the residue of the trade. Not because they are\r\ninferior to us in anything; it would be a fatal error to suppose it; not\r\nbecause they have less intelligence or less perseverance. They are your\r\ndescendants; they are your kinsmen; and they are fully equal to you in\r\nall that goes to make human energy and power; but they are laboring\r\nunder the delusion from which you yourselves have but recently escaped,\r\nand in which some misguided fellow-citizens seek again to entangle you.\r\n\r\n\"I am reminded that I was guilty on a certain occasion of stating in an\r\narticle--not a political article--that, in my opinion, it was far from\r\nimprobable that as the volume of the future was unrolled, America, with\r\nits vast population and its wonderful resources, and not less with that\r\nsevere education which, from the high price of labor, America is\r\nreceiving in the strong necessity of resorting to every description of\r\nlabor-saving contrivances, and consequent development, not only on a\r\nlarge scale, but down to the smallest scale of mechanical genius of the\r\ncountry--on that account the day may come when that country may claim to\r\npossess the commercial primacy of the world, I gave sad offence to many.\r\nI at present will say this, that as long as America adheres to the\r\nprotective system your commercial primacy is secure. Nothing in the\r\nworld can wrest it from you while America continues to fetter her own\r\nstrong hands and arms, and with these fettered arms is content to\r\ncompete with you, who are free, in neutral markets. And as long as\r\nAmerica follows the doctrine of protection, or the doctrines now known\r\nas those of 'fair trade,' you are perfectly safe, and you need not\r\nallow, any of you, even your slightest slumbers to be disturbed by the\r\nfear that America will take from you your commercial primacy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter his return to London Mr. Gladstone received an address from the\r\nCorporation, setting forth the long services he had rendered to the\r\ncountry. Mr. Gladstone, in his reply, touched upon Irish obstruction,\r\nand announced, incidentally, the arrest of Mr. Parnell. Mr. Parnell, the\r\nleader of the Irish party, having openly defied the law, had been\r\narrested and imprisoned without trial, under the Coercion Act, passed at\r\nthe last session.\r\n\r\nOn the opening night of the Parliament, of 1882, Mr. Gladstone laid\r\nbefore the House the proposed new rules of Parliamentary procedure. The\r\n_clôture_, by a bare majority, was to be established, in order to secure\r\nthe power of closing debate by a vote of the House.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords decided upon the appointment of a Select Committee to\r\ninquire into the working of the Land Act, including the alleged total\r\ncollapse of the clauses relating to purchase, emigration, and arrears.\r\nThe Prime Minister in the House of Commons introduced a resolution\r\ncondemning the proposed inquiry as tending to defeat the operation of\r\nthe Land Act and as injurious to the good government of Ireland.\r\n\r\nEarly in May, 1882, the whole country was startled and terrified by the\r\nnews of the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the new chief\r\nsecretary for Ireland, and Mr. Burke under-secretary, in the Phoenix\r\nPark, Dublin. A social revolution was raging in Ireland. Outrages and\r\nmurders had been fearfully frequent, and such brutal murders as those of\r\nMrs. Smythe and Mr. Herbert had filled England with terror. In the\r\nfirst week of May announcement was made that Earl Cowper had resigned\r\nthe Viceroyalty. Rather than share the responsibility of releasing Mr.\r\nParnell, Mr. Dillon and Mr. O'Kelly, Mr. Forster left the Cabinet. Lord\r\nSpencer was appointed to the Viceroyalty, and Lord Frederick Cavendish\r\nsucceeded Mr. Forster, and two days thereafter all England was thrilled\r\nwith sorrow and indignation by the terrible news of the assassination in\r\nPhoenix Park. The news shattered the hopes of many concerning Ireland,\r\nand fell with special severity upon Mr. Gladstone, because he and Lord\r\nCavendish enjoyed the closest friendship. The government presented a\r\nPrevention of Crimes Bill of a very stringent character. In the course\r\nof debate warm discussions arose over an \"understanding\" called, \"The\r\nKilmainham Compact,\" but Mr. Gladstone successfully defended the\r\ngovernment in regard to its supposed negotiations with Mr. Parnell. This\r\nbill was directed against secret societies and illegal combinations, and\r\nit was hoped that as the Land League party had expressed its horror at\r\nthe Phoenix Park crime, and charged that it was the work of American\r\nconspirators, they would allow the measure speedily to become law. Mr.\r\nBright declared that the bill would harm no innocent person, and\r\nexplained his own doctrine, that \"Force is no remedy,\" was intended to\r\napply not to outrages, but to grievances. For three weeks Mr. Parnell\r\nand his followers obstructed legislation in every conceivable way, and\r\nwere finally suspended for systematic obstruction. The obstructionists\r\nremoved, the bill was then passed, after a sitting of twenty-eight\r\nhours. The measure was passed by the Lords July 7th, and the Queen\r\nsigned the bill July 12th. A crisis nearly arose between the Lords and\r\nthe Commons over the Irish Arrears Bill, but the Lords finally yielded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALLERY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ADMINISTRATION AND HOME RULE\r\n\r\nIt is our purpose next to trace the events that led to the overthrow of\r\nthe Second Administration of Mr. Gladstone, and to the formation of his\r\nThird Cabinet. The question that seemed to begin the work of weakening\r\nthe foundations of his existing government was their policy in regard to\r\nEgypt, which began with the occupation of Egypt in 1882.\r\n\r\nThe budget of the session of 1882 was presented by Mr. Gladstone April\r\n24th. It was not expected that anything novel in the way of legislation\r\nwould be attempted in it. But its main interest was in this, that it\r\nproposed a vote of credit for the Egyptian Expedition, which was to be\r\nprovided for by addition to the income-tax, making it sixpence\r\nhalf-penny in the pound for the year. The financial proposals were\r\nagreed to. In the course of the session Mr. Bright resigned his place in\r\nthe Cabinet on the ground that the intervention in Egypt was a manifest\r\nviolation of the moral law, that the Government had interfered by force\r\nof arms in Egypt, and directed the bombardment of Alexandria. Mr.\r\nGladstone denied that the Ministry were at war with Egypt, and stated\r\nthat the measures taken at Alexandria were strictly measures of\r\nself-defence. In justifying his resignation Mr. Bright said there had\r\nbeen a manifest violation of the moral law; but the Premier, while\r\nagreeing with his late colleague generally on the question of the moral\r\nlaw differed from him as to this particular application of it.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister attended the Lord Mayor's Banquet at the Mansion\r\nHouse, August 9, 1882. In replying to the toast to Her Majesty's\r\nMinisters, after some preliminary remarks, Mr. Gladstone alluded to the\r\ncampaign in Egypt, which had been so much discussed, and said: \"Let it\r\nbe well understood for what we go and for what we do not go to Egypt. We\r\ndo not go to make war on its people, but to rescue them from the\r\noppression of a military tyranny which at present extinguishes every\r\nfree voice and chains every man of the people of that country. We do not\r\ngo to make war on the Mohammedan religion, for it is amongst the\r\nproudest distinctions of Christianity to establish tolerance, and we\r\nknow that wherever the British rule exists, the same respect which we\r\nclaim for the exercise of our own conscientious convictions is yielded\r\nto the professors of every other faith on the surface of the globe. We\r\ndo not, my Lord Mayor, go to repress the growth of Egyptian liberties.\r\nWe wish them well; for we have no other interest in Egypt, which cannot\r\nin any other way so well and so effectually attain her own prosperity as\r\nby the enjoyment of a well regulated, and an expanding freedom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's confidence respecting the early termination of the war\r\nin Egypt was somewhat justified by Sir Garnet Wolseley's victory at\r\nTel-el-Kebir, but the future relations of England with Egypt were still\r\nleft an open subject of discussion and speculation. Again, November 9th,\r\nat the banquet at the Guildhall, to the Cabinet Ministers, Mr. Gladstone\r\nspoke. He called attention to the settlement of the troubles in the East\r\nof Europe, congratulating his hearers on the removal by the naval and\r\nmilitary forces of the Egyptian difficulty, and calling attention to\r\nIreland, compared its condition with that of the previous March and\r\nOctober, 1881, showing a diminution of agrarian crime to the extent of\r\nfour-fifths. This happy result had been brought about, not by coercive\r\nmeans alone, but by the exercise of remedial measures. \"If the people of\r\nIreland were willing to walk in the ways of legality, England was\r\nstrong, and generous, and free enough to entertain in a friendly and\r\nkindly spirit any demand which they might make.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of December, 1882, Mr. Gladstone's political jubilee was\r\ncelebrated. Fifty years before, on that day, he had been returned to\r\nParliament as member for Newark. A large number of congratulatory\r\naddresses, letters, and telegrams complimenting him on the completion of\r\nhis fifty years of parliamentary service were received by him. He had\r\nentered the first Reformed Parliament as a conservative, had gone ever\r\nforward in the path of reform, and was yet to lead in greater measures\r\nof reform.\r\n\r\nThe excellent prospects regarding domestic measures with which the\r\nsession of 1883 was opened were dispelled by prolonged and fruitless\r\ndebates on measures proposed and on the address from the Queen. But Mr.\r\nGladstone was absent, the state of his health requiring him to pass\r\nseveral weeks at Cannes. He returned home in March greatly invigorated,\r\nand at once threw himself with wonted ardour into the parliamentary\r\nconflict. Mr. Parnell offered a bill to amend the Irish Land Act of\r\n1887, which was opposed by the Premier and lost.\r\n\r\nAn affirmation bill was introduced at this session by the Government,\r\nwhich provided that members who objected to taking the oath might have\r\nthe privilege of affirming. The opposition spoke of the measure as a\r\n\"Bradlaugh Relief Bill.\" Its rejection was moved, and in its defense\r\nMr. Gladstone made one of his best speeches, which was warmly applauded.\r\nHe said: \"I must painfully record my opinion, that grave injury has been\r\ndone to religion in many minds--not in instructed minds, but in those\r\nwhich are ill-instructed or partially instructed--in consequence of\r\nthings which ought never to have occurred. Great mischief has been done\r\nin many minds by a resistance offered to the man elected by the\r\nconstituency of Northampton, which a portion of the people believe to be\r\nunjust. When they see the profession of religion and the interests of\r\nreligion, ostensibly associated with what they are deeply convinced is\r\ninjustice, it leads to questions about religion itself, which commonly\r\nend in impairing those convictions, and that belief, the loss of which I\r\nbelieve to be the most inexpressible calamity which can fall either upon\r\na man or upon a nation.\" But the measure was lost.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1883 the Bankruptcy Bill and the Patents Bill were\r\nboth passed, and effected reforms which had long been felt to be\r\nnecessary. The Corrupt Practices Act was designed to remove from British\r\nparliamentary and borough elections the stigma which attached to them in\r\nso many parts of the country. The Government was checked, however, in\r\nits policy in the Transvaal, and Mr. Childers' action in regard to the\r\nSuez Canal.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone attended, in March, the celebration of the inauguration\r\nof the National Liberal party, predicting for it a useful and brilliant\r\nfuture, if it remained faithful to its time-honored principles and\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\nSir Stafford Northcote, in the session of 1884, moved a vote of censure,\r\nand vigorously attacked the Egyptian policy of the administration. Mr.\r\nGladstone defended the ministerial action with spirit and effect. He\r\ndeclared that the Government had found, and not made, the situation in\r\nEgypt and the Soudan. The Prime Minister \"traced all the mischief to\r\nLord Salisbury's dual control. Though the motive and object had been to\r\nsecure a better government for Egypt, a great error had been committed.\r\nThe British Government had fulfilled all the obligations imposed upon\r\nthem, and they were acting for the benefit of the civilized world.\r\nReforms had been effected in the judicature, legislature, police, and\r\nmilitary organizations of Egypt; and they were resolved to see all the\r\nvital points recommended carried out by the Khedive's Government. As to\r\nthe war in the Soudan, it was hateful to the people of Egypt; and\r\nEngland declined to have anything to do with the reconquest of the\r\nSoudan.... General Gordon, whom Mr. Gladstone characterized as a hero\r\nand a genius, had been despatched to Khartoum for the purpose of\r\nwithdrawing, if possible, in safety the 29,000 soldiers of the Khedive\r\nscattered over the Soudan. The General's mission was not the reconquest\r\nof the Soudan, but its peaceful evacuation, and the reconstruction of\r\nthe country, by giving back to the Sultan the ancestral power which had\r\nbeen suspended during the Egyptian occupation. The Government had to\r\nconsider in any steps which they took the danger of thwarting Gordon's\r\npeaceful mission and endangering his life.\" Mr. Gladstone said that the\r\npolicy of the Government was to \"rescue and retire.\" Sir S. Northcote's\r\nresolution was rejected by 311 to 292 votes, showing the growing\r\nstrength of the Opposition.\r\n\r\nThe pacific mission of General Gordon to Khartoum having failed, there\r\nwas great solicitude felt for that gallant soldier's welfare and safety.\r\nSir M. Hicks-Beach offered another vote of censure, complaining of the\r\ndilatory conduct of the Government for not taking steps to secure the\r\nsafety of General Gordon. Mr. Gladstone, in reply, admitted the\r\nobligations of the Government to General Gordon, and stated that on\r\nreasonable proof of danger he would be assisted. \"The nation would never\r\ngrudge adequate efforts for the protection of its agents, but it was the\r\nduty of the Government to consider the treasure, the blood, and the\r\nhonor of the country, together with the circumstances of the time, the\r\nseason, the climate, and the military difficulties. Conscious of what\r\ntheir obligations were, they would continue to use their best endeavours\r\nto fulfil them, unmoved by the threats and the captious criticisms of\r\nthe Opposition.\" The proposed censure was defeated.\r\n\r\nA conference of European powers was held on Egyptian affairs, but was\r\nabortive; and Mr. Gladstone while announcing that he wished to get out\r\nof Egypt as soon as circumstances would allow, admitted that\r\ninstitutions, however good, were not likely to survive the withdrawal of\r\nour troops. Lord Northbrook was next despatched by the government on a\r\nmission to Egypt, with the object of rescuing her from her financial\r\nembarrassments, and averting the impending dangers of a national\r\nbankruptcy.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1884, Mr. Gladstone introduced the Government Franchise\r\nBill in the House of Commons. It was a great measure and proposed to\r\ncomplete the work of parliamentary reform by conferring the suffrage\r\nupon every person in the United Kingdom who was the head of a household.\r\nMr. Gladstone said that the results of the bill would be to add to the\r\nEnglish constituency upwards of 1,300,000 voters; to the Scotch\r\nconstituency over 200,000 voters; and to the Irish constituency over\r\n400,000 voters; which would add to the aggregate constituency of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, which was then 3,000,000 voters, 2,000,000 more, or\r\nnearly twice as many as were added in 1832. The Premier appealed for\r\nunion on this great reform, and observed: \"Let us hold firmly together,\r\nand success will crown our efforts. You will, as much as any former\r\nParliament that has conferred great legislative benefits on the nation,\r\nhave your reward, and read your history in a nation's eyes; for you will\r\nhave deserved all the benefits you will have conferred. You will have\r\nmade a strong nation stronger still--stronger in union without, and\r\nstronger against its foes (if and when it has any foes) within; stronger\r\nin union between class and class, and in rallying all classes and\r\nportions of the community in one solid compact mass round the ancient\r\nThrone which it has loved so well, and round the Constitution, now to be\r\nmore than ever free and more than ever powerful.\"\r\n\r\nThe measure was warmly debated. Besides this opposition there were,\r\noutside of the House, ominous utterances threatening the rejection of\r\nthe scheme. Mr. Gladstone, referring to these hostile murmurings, said\r\nthat hitherto the attitude of the government had been, in Shakespeare's\r\nwords, \"Beware of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, bear it, that\r\nthe opposer may beware of thee.\" He deprecated a quarrel and declared\r\nthat the government had done everything to prevent a collision between\r\nthe two Houses of Parliament on this question, which would open up a\r\nprospect more serious than any he remembered since the first\r\nReform Bill.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords passed a resolution to the effect that the Lords\r\nwould not concur in any measure of reform without having the complete\r\nbill before them, including the redistribution and registration, as well\r\nas an extension of the suffrage. The Premier promised to introduce a\r\nRedistribution Bill in the following session, but Lord Salisbury, since\r\nthe death of Lord Beaconsfield, the leader of the Conservative party,\r\ndeclined to discuss the Redistribution Bill, \"with a rope around his\r\nneck,\" by which he meant a franchise act under which his party must\r\nappeal to the country. Negotiations followed between the Liberal and\r\nConservative leaders with fruitless results, and the House of Lords\r\nfinally passed a resolution that it would be desirable for Parliament to\r\nhave an autumn session, to consider the Representation of the People\r\nBill, in connection with the Redistribution Bill, which the government\r\nhad brought before Parliament.\r\n\r\nPublic meetings were held at various places throughout the country, and\r\nthe question of the enlargement of the franchise discussed. The policy\r\nof the Tories was strongly condemned at many large and influential\r\npublic gatherings. In August Mr. Gladstone visited Midlothian and\r\ndelivered a powerful address in the Edinburgh Corn Exchange. He\r\nexplained that the special purpose for which he appeared before his\r\nconstituents was to promote, by every legitimate means in his power, the\r\nspeedy passage of the Franchise Bill. \"The unfortunate rejection of the\r\nmeasure,\" he observed, \"had already drawn in its train other questions\r\nof the gravest kind, and the vast proportion of the people would soon be\r\nasking whether an organic change was not required in the House of Lords.\r\nHe, however, did not believe that the House of Lords had as yet placed\r\nitself in a position of irretrievable error. He believed that it was\r\npossible for it to go back, and to go back with dignity and honor.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the foreign policy of the Government, which had been\r\nattacked and compared unfavorably with the Midlothian programme of 1879,\r\nMr. Gladstone defended it with spirit. He expressed his satisfaction\r\nwith the expansion of Germany abroad, and reviewed the policy of the\r\nGovernment in Eastern Europe, Afghanistan, India and South Africa. As to\r\nthe Transvaal, he contended that \"they were strong and could afford to\r\nbe merciful,\" and that it was not possible without the grossest and most\r\nshameful breach of faith to persist in holding the Boers to annexation,\r\n\"when we had pledged ourselves beforehand that they should not be\r\nannexed except with their own good will.\" In reply to the oft-repeated\r\nquestion, \"What took you to Egypt?\" the Premier said: \"Honor and\r\nplighted faith.\" The covenants they were keeping were those entered into\r\nby their Tory predecessors, and most unfortunate and most unwise he\r\nconsidered them to be. The Government had respected the sovereignty of\r\nthe Porte and the title of the European Powers to be concerned in all\r\nmatters territorially affecting the Turkish Empire; they had discouraged\r\nthe spirit of aggression as well as they could, and had contracted no\r\nembarrassing engagements. Great improvements had been introduced in the\r\nadministration of Egypt, but he regretted the total failure of the late\r\nConference of the Powers to solve the problem of Egyptian finance. With\r\nregard to General Gordon the Government were considering the best means\r\nto be adopted for fulfilling their obligations.\r\n\r\nParliament met in October, 1884. The Franchise Bill was introduced and\r\nsent to the House of Lords, and the Redistribution Bill, upon which a\r\ncompromise with the Conservatives had been reached, was presented in the\r\nHouse of Commons. The measure, as altered, proposed to disfranchise all\r\nboroughs with a population under 15,000, to give only one member to\r\ntowns with a population between 15,000 and 50,000, and to take one\r\nmember each from the counties of Rutland and Hereford. By this\r\narrangement one hundred and sixty seats would be \"extinguished,\" which,\r\nwith the six seats extinguished before, would be revived and distributed\r\nas follows: \"Eight new boroughs would be created, the representation of\r\nLondon, Liverpool, and other large cities and towns would be greatly\r\nincreased, while in dealing with the remainder of the seats\r\nunappropriated, the Government would apply equal electoral areas\r\nthroughout the country.\" The Franchise Bill--a truly democratic\r\nbill---was carried through both Houses, and became a law. The\r\nRedistribution Bill was carried, January, 1885, after animated debate.\r\nRegistration measures were also passed for England, Scotland and\r\nIreland, which received the royal assent May 21st.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1885, Mr. Gladstone wrote a kindly, serious, yet courtly letter\r\nof congratulation to Prince Albert Victor, eldest son of the Prince of\r\nWales and heir presumptive to the Crown, on the attainment of\r\nhis majority.\r\n\r\nIn the hour of triumph the government was doomed to receive a stunning\r\nblow. The news of the fall of Khartoum and the untimely death of General\r\nGordon sent a thrill of horror and indignation throughout England. The\r\ngovernment was seriously condemned for its procrastination in not\r\nsending timely relief, for the rescue of the imperiled English. But when\r\nthe facts became fully known it was found that no blame could be\r\nattached to Mr. Gladstone, who was himself strongly moved by the death\r\nof General Gordon, whose work and character he highly esteemed. The\r\nPrime Minister was, however, equal to the emergency, and announced that\r\nit was necessary to overthrow the Mahdi at Khartoum, to renew operations\r\nagainst Osman Digna, and to construct a railway from Suakin to Berber\r\nwith a view to a campaign in the fall. The reserves were called out by\r\nroyal proclamation.\r\n\r\nHowever, these measures met with opposition. Sir Stafford Northcote\r\nbrought forward a motion affirming that the risks and sacrifices which\r\nthe government appeared to be ready to encounter could only be justified\r\nby a distinct recognition of England's responsibility for Egypt, and\r\nthose portions of the Soudan which were necessary to its security. An\r\namendment was proposed by Mr. John Morley, but regretting its decision\r\nto continue the conflict with the Mahdi. Mr. Gladstone replied forcibly\r\nto both motion and amendment, and appealed to the Liberal party to\r\nsustain the administration and its policy by an unmistakable vote of\r\nconfidence. The government was sustained.\r\n\r\nThe Great Powers of Europe, in convention for the settlement of the\r\nfinances of Egypt, had concluded that it would require a loan of\r\n£9,000,000 to save Egypt from bankruptcy. This loan was to be issued on\r\nan international guarantee, with an international inquiry at the end of\r\ntwo years into the success of the scheme. This plan of adjustment was\r\nagreed to by the House. A short time after this settlement Mr. Gladstone\r\nannounced a vote of credit to provide against any danger from Russian\r\naction, stated that no farther operations would be undertaken either on\r\nthe Nile or near Suakin, and that General Graham's campaign would be\r\nabandoned, as well as the construction of the new railway.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement was created in England by the announcement of the\r\nadvance of the Russians on the Indian frontier. March 13th Mr. Gladstone\r\nstated in the House that as the protests formerly made against the\r\nadvance of Russia had been allowed to lapse, it had been agreed that\r\npending the delineation of the frontier there should be no further\r\nadvance on either side. In April, however, a conflict occurred between\r\nthe Russians and the Afghans, which seemed to indicate that General\r\nKomaroff had committed an act of unprovoked aggression on the Ameer. Mr.\r\nGladstone moved a vote of credit on the 27th in a speech, whose\r\neloquence and energy greatly stirred both sides of the House. Happily,\r\nthe difficulty with Russia was adjusted by conceding Pendjeh to Russia\r\nin consideration of the surrender of Zulfiker to the Ameer.\r\n\r\nThe administration of Mr. Gladstone, which had weathered through many\r\nstorms, was destined to fall in a wholly unexpected way. When the budget\r\nfor 1885 was produced there was a deficit of upwards of a million\r\npounds, besides the depressed revenue and an estimated expenditure for\r\nthe current year of not less than £100,000,000. Mr. Childers, the\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, proposed to make the taxation upon land\r\nproportionate to that on personal property, and to augment the duties on\r\nspirits and beer. But various interests were antagonized, and opposition\r\nwas aroused. The country members demanded that no new taxes be put on\r\nthe land until the promised relief of local taxation had been granted.\r\nThe agricultural and liquor interests were discontented, as well as the\r\nScotch and Irish members, with the whisky duty. Concessions were made,\r\nbut they failed to reconcile the opposition. A hostile motion was\r\noffered by Sir M. Hicks-Beach, and Mr. Gladstone declared that the\r\nCabinet would resign if defeated. Many Liberals were absent when the\r\nvote was taken, regarding a majority for the Ministry as certain, but\r\nthe amendment was carried June 9th by a vote of 264 to 252, and the\r\nPremier and his colleagues resigned. The Liberals were desirous of\r\npassing a vote of confidence in the administration, but Mr. Gladstone\r\ndeprecated this, as he felt the situation to be intolerable, and was\r\ndesirous of being relieved from the responsibility of office.\r\nMisfortunes, both in reference to affairs at home and abroad, had fallen\r\nheavily upon the Government, for many of which they were not\r\nresponsible, and the Cabinet had been held together chiefly by the\r\nmasterly personality of the Premier. Hence it was not without a feeling\r\nof personal satisfaction that Mr. Gladstone transferred the seats of\r\noffice to his successor, Lord Salisbury. On his retirement from office\r\nthe Queen offered an Earldom to Mr. Gladstone, which he declined. Its\r\nacceptance would have meant burial in the House of Lords, and an end to\r\nhis progressive action.\r\n\r\nThe events that led to the third administration of Mr. Gladstone will\r\nnext engage our attention.\r\n\r\nThe first general election under the New Reform Act was held in\r\nNovember, 1885. Mr. Gladstone again appealed to his constituents, and,\r\nalthough nearly seventy-six years of age, spoke with an energy and force\r\nfar beyond all his contemporaries. His attitude on the question of\r\nDis-establishment drew back many wavering Scotch votes. He discussed the\r\nScotch question at Edinburgh, and said there was no fear of change so\r\nlong as England dealt liberally, equitably, and prudently with Ireland,\r\nbut demands must be subject to the condition that the unity of the\r\nempire, and all the powers of the Imperial Parliament for maintaining\r\nthat authority, must be preserved.\r\n\r\nIn another address he stated his conviction, that the day had not come\r\nwhen the Dis-establishment of the Church in Scotland should be made a\r\ntest question. The question pressing for settlement by the next\r\nParliament was land reform, local government, parliamentary procedure,\r\nand the imperial relations between Ireland and England; and every\r\nsensible man would admit that it was right to direct attention to them\r\nrather than to a matter impossible of immediate solution.\r\n\r\nAt West Calder Mr. Gladstone made an address, in which he \"approved Lord\r\nSalisbury's action with regard to Servia, complained of the ministerial\r\ncondemnation of Lord Ripon's Indian administration, ridiculed the idea\r\nof benefit resulting from a Royal Commission on trade depression, warned\r\nthe electors against remedies which were really worse than the disease,\r\nand defended Free-Trade principles. He furthur advocated comprehensive\r\nland reforms, including free transfer, facility of registration, and the\r\nuprooting of mortmain.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLADSTONE'S STUDY AT EDWARDEN.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was returned again for Midlothian by an overwhelming\r\nmajority. The elections resulted in the return of 333 Liberals, 249\r\nConservatives, 86 Parnellites, and 2 Independents. The Liberals thus\r\nsecured a substantial triumph. The agricultural districts were faithful\r\nto the Liberals, but they lost in the boroughs. The clergy and the\r\npublicans, and the Parnellites were found \"arrayed\" in \"scandalous\r\nalliance\" against the Liberal cause. The Liberal party was just short of\r\nthe numbers required to defeat the combined forces of Tories and\r\nParnellites. Lord Salisbury was retained in office, but the\r\nConservatives were disunited, and the life of his administration hung by\r\na thread. The Liberals were strong, hopeful, and united. In Mr.\r\nChamberlain they had a popular champion of great ability and industry.\r\n\r\nDecember 17, 1885 England was astonished by the appearance of an\r\nanonymous paragraph in the _Times_, affirming that, if Mr. Gladstone\r\nreturned to power, he would deal with a liberal hand with the demands of\r\nHome Rule. The author of the paragraph has never been clearly\r\nascertained, but the atmosphere of mystery with which it was surrounded\r\nwas not regarded as becoming, either to such an important policy or to\r\nthe personal dignity of the illustrious statesman. A storm of questions,\r\ncontradictions, explanations, enthusiasms, and jeremiads followed its\r\nappearance. Mr. Gladstone would neither affirm nor deny, but held his\r\npeace. The question, he said, was one for a responsible Ministry alone\r\nto handle. There was great uncertainty. It was, however, plain that if\r\nMr. Gladstone should favor Home Rule, the Parnellites would support him,\r\nand the Tories must leave office. But only twelve months before Lord\r\nShaftesbury wrote: \"In a year or so we shall have Home Rule disposed of\r\n(at all hazards), to save us from daily and hourly bores.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of 1886 had scarcely opened before the Salisbury\r\ngovernment was defeated upon an amendment to the Queen's address,\r\naffirming the necessity for affording facilities to agricultural\r\nlaborers to obtain allotments and small holdings. Some of the leading\r\nLiberals opposed the amendment, but Mr. Gladstone earnestly favored it,\r\nas a recognition of the evils arising from the divorce of so large a\r\nproportion of the population from the land. The Irish and the Liberals\r\ncoalesced, and the Government was placed in a minority of seventy-nine,\r\nand Lord Salisbury immediately resigned.\r\n\r\nLate at night, January 29, 1886, Sir Henry Ponsonby arrived at Mr.\r\nGladstone's residence with a summons from the Queen for him to repair to\r\nher at Osborne. On the 1st of February Mr. Gladstone \"kissed hands,\" and\r\nbecame for the third time Prime Minister of England. The new Premier was\r\nforced to face unusual difficulties, but he finally came to the\r\nconclusion that it was impossible to deal with the Irish question upon\r\nthe old stereotyped lines. He was resolved to treat this subject upon\r\nlarge and generous principles. Accordingly, on the 8th of April, Mr.\r\nGladstone, in the presence of a crowded House, brought forward his Home\r\nRule Bill--his bill for the government of Ireland. With certain imperial\r\nreservations and safeguards the bill gave to Ireland what she had long\r\ndemanded--the right to make her own laws. The interest in the expected\r\nlegislation was so great that members began to arrive at half-past five\r\nin the morning, while sixty of them were so eager to secure seats that\r\nthey breakfasted at Westminster.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's new measure was not only opposed by the Conservatives,\r\nbut it alienated from the Premier some of the most influential of the\r\nLiberal party. Among the Liberals who opposed the measure were those who\r\nhad been the colleagues of Mr. Gladstone only the June before in the\r\nCabinet--Lord Hartington, Lord Shilborne, Lord Northbrook, Lord Derby\r\nand Lord Carlingford. Mr. Gladstone's forces, however, were reinforced\r\nby Mr. Morley, Lord Herschell and others. May 10th, Mr. Gladstone denied\r\nthat he had ever declared Home Rule for Ireland incompatible with\r\nImperial unity. It was a remedy for social disorder. The policy of the\r\nopposition was coercion, while that of the government was autonomy.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April the Premier presented the Irish Land Purchase Bill,\r\nfor the buying out of the Irish landlords, which was intended to come\r\ninto operation on the same day as the Home Rule Bill. The object of this\r\nmeasure was to give to all Irish landowners the option of being bought\r\nout on the terms of the Act, and opening towards the exercise of that\r\noption where their rent was from agricultural land. The State authority\r\nwas to be the purchaser, and the occupier was to be the proprietor. The\r\nnominal purchase price was fixed at twenty years' purchase of the net\r\nrental, ascertained by deducting law charges, bad debts, and cost of\r\nmanagement from judicial rent. Where there was no judicial rental the\r\nLand Court could, if it chose, make use of Griffiths' valuation for\r\ncoming to a fair decision. To meet the demand for the means of purchase\r\nthus established, Mr. Gladstone proposed to create £50,000,000 three per\r\ncents. The repayment of advances would be secured by a Receiver General,\r\nappointed by and acting upon British authority.\r\n\r\nThe Land Purchase Bill was also opposed. It was the final cause which\r\nled to the retirement from the government of Mr. Chamberlain, \"the able\r\nand enterprising exponent of the new Radicalism.\" He was soon followed\r\nby Sir George Trevelyan, \"who combined the most dignified traditions,\r\nsocial and literary, of the Whig party with a fervent and stable\r\nLiberalism which the vicissitudes of twenty years had constantly tried\r\nand never found wanting.\" Mr. Bright also arrayed himself in opposition\r\nto the government, and accused Mr. Gladstone of successfully concealing\r\nhis thoughts upon the Irish question in November. Mr. Gladstone replied\r\nthat the position of Ireland had changed since 1881.\r\n\r\nThe debate extended over many nights, and the opposition to the Irish\r\nbills of so many Liberal leaders in every constituency, soon led to\r\ndisaffection among the people. What was lost in some districts, however,\r\nwas to some extent made up, says an English writer, by \"the support of\r\nthat very broken reed, the Irish vote, which was destined to pierce the\r\nhand of so many a confiding candidate who leaned upon it.\" While this\r\ndebate was in progress a bill directed against the carrying of arms in\r\nIreland was introduced and pushed forward rapidly through both Houses,\r\nand became a law.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone explained the position of the Cabinet on the Home Rule and\r\nLand Bills at a meeting of Liberals held at the Foreign Office, May\r\n27th. He stated that the Government at present only asked for an\r\nendorsement of the leading principles of the two measures; and in\r\nclosing the debate afterwards on the second reading of the Home Rule\r\nBill, in the House of Commons, he made an eloquent appeal for Ireland.\r\nBut all parties were preparing for the conflict, and members of opposite\r\nparties were consolidating themselves for opposition. \"The Whigs, under\r\nLord Hartington, coalesced with the Radicals, under Mr. Chamberlain, and\r\nboth together made a working alliance with the Tories. This alliance was\r\nadmirably organized in London and in the constituencies.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Premier was deceived by his official counsellors of\r\nthe Liberal party as to the real condition of affairs respecting Home\r\nRule and the prospects for the passage of his bills. He did not dream of\r\ndefeat, but if by some mischance they would suffer defeat, then he could\r\nappeal to the country with the certainty of being sustained by the\r\npopular vote. This was what Mr. Gladstone hoped, and what he thought he\r\nhad the assurance of. But hopes of success began to give way to fears of\r\ndefeat as the time drew near to take the vote. However, some still\r\nhopeful prophesied a small majority against the bill--only ten votes at\r\nthe most. The Cabinet desperately resolved not to resign if beaten by so\r\nsmall a majority, but would have some adherent move a vote of\r\nconfidence. This they argued would be favored by some opposed to Home\r\nRule, and the question be deferred to another session, leaving the\r\nLiberals still in office. But these hopes were doomed to be blasted.\r\nEarly in the morning of June 8th the momentous division took place, and\r\nit was found that the Government, instead of getting a majority, was\r\ndefeated by thirty votes. It was found that ninety-three Liberals had\r\nvoted with the majority.\r\n\r\nThe Premier at once advised the Queen to dissolve Parliament, and though\r\nHer Majesty at first demurred at the trouble of another election within\r\nseven months of the last, and begged Mr. Gladstone to reconsider his\r\ncounsel, yet he argued that a general election would cause less trouble\r\nthan a year of embittered and fanatical agitation against Home Rule.\r\nBesides, as he said to a colleague, \"If we did not dissolve we would be\r\nshowing the white feather.\" Mr. Gladstone finally had his way, the Queen\r\nyielded and Parliament was dissolved June 26, 1886. June 14th Mr.\r\nGladstone issued an address to the electors of Midlothian, and later\r\npaid a visit to Edinburgh and Glasgow, where he made powerful addresses.\r\nHe then spoke at Manchester, and, passing on to Liverpool, he advocated\r\nthe cause of Ireland, calling upon the people to \"ring out the old, ring\r\nin the new,\" and to make Ireland not an enemy but a friend.\r\n\r\nThe result of this appeal to the country was the return of a decided\r\nmajority of over a hundred against Home Rule, and thus, after a short\r\nterm of five months in office, the third administration of Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas brought to a close, and he became again the leader of the\r\nOpposition. The dissolution and appeal to the country was a practical\r\nblunder, but Mr. Gladstone's address to the people was skilfully worded.\r\nHe freely admitted that the Irish bills were dead, and asked the\r\nconstituencies simply to sanction a principle, and that, too, a very\r\nplain and reasonable one in itself. He invited the people to vote aye or\r\nno to this question: \"Whether you will or will not have regard to the\r\nprayer of Ireland for the management by herself of the affairs\r\nspecifically and exclusively her own?\" The separation of the bare\r\nprinciple of self-government from the practical difficulties presented\r\nby the bills enabled many Liberals who were opposed to the measures to\r\nsupport Mr. Gladstone, but the majority of voters failed to make this\r\ndistinction, and hence came defeat. The decision of the people was not\r\nregarded as final.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the Jubilee of the Queen was celebrated. Fifty years before\r\nQueen Victoria had ascended the throne of England. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGladstone celebrated the Queen's Jubilee by giving a treat to all the\r\ninhabitants of the estates of Hawarden, who were of the Queen's age,\r\nwhich was sixty-eight and upwards. The treat took the shape of a dinner\r\nand tea, served in a large tent erected in front of the castle, and the\r\nguests numbered upwards of two hundred and fifty. The principal toast,\r\nproposed by Mr. Gladstone, was the Queen. He contrasted the jubilee then\r\nbeing celebrated all over the English-speaking world, with that of\r\nGeorge the Third, which was \"a jubilee of the great folks, a jubilee of\r\ncorporations and of authorities, a jubilee of the upper classes.\" On the\r\nother hand, he continued, the Victorian Jubilee was one when \"the\r\npopulation are better fed, better clothed, and better housed--and by a\r\ngreat deal--than they were fifty years ago, and the great mass of these\r\nhappy and blessed changes is associated with the name and action of\r\nthe Queen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year of the Queen's Jubilee, 1887, Mr. Gladstone addressed many\r\ngatherings, and at Swansea, where he was the guest of Sir Hussey Vivian,\r\nhe spoke to a vast concourse of people, estimated at one\r\nhundred thousand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIME MINISTER THE FOURTH TIME\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met in 1887 Mr. Gladstone entered upon \"a course of\r\nextraordinary physical and intellectual efforts, with voice and pen, in\r\nParliament and on the platform, on behalf of the cause, defeated but not\r\nabandoned, of self-government for Ireland.\" The Tory administration\r\npassed a Crimes Prevention Bill for Ireland of great severity. Irish\r\nmembers of Parliament were thrown into prison, but the Act failed of its\r\nobject--the suppression of the Land League.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1887, Mr. Gladstone visited Italy and made Naples his\r\nheadquarters. He was received with joy for the service he had rendered\r\nto the Italian people. The University of Bologna, in celebrating the\r\neighth century of its existence, conferred upon him the degree of\r\nDoctor of Arts.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the House of Commons appointed a Commission to try the \"Times\"\r\ncharges against Mr. Parnell. The charges were found to be false.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone visited Birmingham in November, 1888. After paying a\r\nglowing tribute to John Bright, and expressing an earnest desire for his\r\nrecovery to health, he condemned the Coercion Act. Mr. Gladstone\r\nreceived many handsome presents from the workingmen, and Mrs. Gladstone\r\nreceived from the ladies a medallion cameo portrait of her husband. A\r\ngreat demonstration was made at Bingley Hall, in which were gathered\r\nover 20,000 persons.\r\n\r\nA number of Liberals, who had deserted Mr. Gladstone, returned upon the\r\npromise of certain imperial guarantees which were granted, among them\r\nSir George Trevelyan. Mr. Chamberlain, who had asked for these\r\nsafeguards, did not accept them.\r\n\r\nJuly 25, 1889, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone celebrated their \"Golden Wedding.\"\r\nAmong the many to offer congratulations were the Queen by telegram, and\r\nthe Prince of Wales by letter. A pleasant surprise met them at home. A\r\nportrait of Mr. Gladstone, by Sir John Millais, was found hanging in the\r\nbreakfast-room, \"A gift from English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish Women.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1890 trouble came to the Liberal party through the scandal connecting\r\nthe names of Mr. Parnell and Mrs. O'Shea. Mr. Gladstone announced that\r\nthe Irish party must choose between himself and Mr. Parnell. In\r\nNovember, 1890, Mr. Parnell was deposed from the chairmanship of the\r\nUnited Irish National Party. This led to a division. Mr. Justin McCarthy\r\nwas elected leader by the Anti-Parnellites, and the Parnellites\r\nselected Mr. John Redmond.\r\n\r\nParliament would soon terminate by limitation, so Mr. Gladstone devoted\r\nhimself to preparing the people for the coming general election.\r\nBesides, in February, 1891, he made an address, at the opening of St.\r\nMartin's Free Public Library, and in March to the boys at Eton College\r\non Homeric Studies. June 28, 1892, Parliament came to an end. Mr.\r\nGladstone's journey to Edinburgh, in July, was all along the route \"a\r\ntriumphal progress.\" He was re-elected. The question of the day was Home\r\nRule, and wherever the people had the opportunity of declaring\r\nthemselves, they pronounced condemnation upon the policy of Lord\r\nSalisbury's administration, and in favor of Home Rule for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament met, and, August 12, 1892, a motion was made of \"No\r\nConfidence\" in the Salisbury government. The division was the largest\r\never taken in the House of Commons, the vote being 350 for the motion\r\nand 310 against it--a majority of 40 for Mr. Gladstone. The scene in\r\nthe House which attended the overthrow of the Salisbury government was\r\nless dramatic than that which accompanied the defeat of the Gladstone\r\nministry in 1885, but it was full of exciting episodes. The House was\r\npacked to the doors. The excitement was intense, and the confusion\r\ngreat. When the figures were announced, another wild scene of disorder\r\nprevailed and there was prolonged cheering. \"Ten minutes later the great\r\nforum was empty and the excited assembly had found its way to the quiet\r\noutside under the stars.\"\r\n\r\nMonday, August 15, 1892, Mr. Gladstone repaired to Osborne on the Royal\r\nYacht, and became for the fourth time Prime Minister. Since 1868 he had\r\nbeen the undisputed leader of his party. His main supporters in all his\r\nreform measures were the Nonconformists, whose claim for \"the absolute\r\nreligious equality of all denominations before the law of the land,\"\r\nmust, in time, it was thought, bring about the disestablishment of the\r\nEpiscopal Church.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1892, Mr. Gladstone went to Sir E. Watkin's _Chalet_ on\r\nMount Snowdon, Wales, where he made his Boulder Stone speech. To\r\ncommemorate his visit a slab of gray Aberdeen granite was \"let into the\r\nactual brown rock,\" on which is the following inscription in Welsh and\r\nin English: \"September 13, 1892. Upon this rock the Right Honorable\r\nW.E. Gladstone, M.P., when Prime Minister for the fourth time, and\r\neighty-three years old, addressed the people of Eryi upon justice to\r\nWales. The multitude sang Cymric hymns and 'The Land of My Fathers.'\"\r\n\r\nDecember 29, 1892, Mr. Gladstone celebrated his eighty-third birthday.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Gladstone were at Biarritz. Congratulatory telegrams and\r\nmessages were received in great numbers, besides many handsome presents.\r\nThe event was celebrated all over England. The Midlothian Liberals sent\r\ncongratulations upon the return of the Liberal Party to power under his\r\nleadership, and the completion of his sixty years' service in the House.\r\nResolutions were passed deploring the wickedness of the dynamite outrage\r\nat Dublin, December 24, and yet avowing the justice of granting to\r\nIreland the right to manage her own affairs.\r\n\r\nJanuary 31, 1893, Parliament was opened. In the House of Commons there\r\nwas a brilliant gathering, and nearly all the members were present, many\r\nof them standing. Just before noon the Hon. Arthur Wellesley Peel,\r\nSpeaker, took his seat, and Archdeacon Farrar, Chaplain, offered prayer.\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone entered from behind the Speaker's chair, every\r\nLiberal and Irish Nationalist stood up and greeted him with prolonged\r\nand enthusiastic cheers; and when he took the oath as Prime Minister,\r\nhe received another ovation. The members were then summoned to the House\r\nof Lords to hear the Queen's speech, which was read by the Lord High\r\nChancellor, Baron Herschall. The Prince of Wales and his son, the Duke\r\nof York, occupied seats on the \"cross bench.\"\r\n\r\nFebruary 13, the excitement in and about the Parliament Houses was as\r\ngreat as that which prevailed two weeks before. Enthusiastic crowds\r\ngreeted Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone. When the doors of the House of Commons\r\nwere opened, there was a \"disorderly rush\" of the members into the House\r\nto obtain seats, \"the members shouting and struggling, several being\r\nthrown to the floor in the excitement.\" Peers, Commons, and visitors\r\nfilled the floor and galleries. The Prince of Wales and other members of\r\nthe royal family were present. When Mr. Gladstone arose he was greeted\r\nwith applause. He reminded the House that for seven years the voices\r\nwhich used to plead the cause of Irish government in Irish affairs had\r\nbeen mute within the walls of the House. He then asked permission to\r\nintroduce a \"Bill to Amend the Provision for the Government of Ireland,\"\r\nwhich was the title of the Home Rule Bill. Mr. Balfour led the\r\nopposition to the bill. Mr. Chamberlain declared that the bill would not\r\naccomplish its purpose, whereupon Mr. Justin McCarthy, for the\r\nanti-Parnellities, replied that the Irish would accept it as a message\r\nof everlasting peace, and Mr. John Redmond, for the Parnellites,\r\nanswered that if disturbances followed in Ireland it would be due to the\r\nConservatives.\r\n\r\nThe Ulster Unionists opposed the bill. The Scotch-Irish Protestants of\r\nthe north of Ireland declared that they preferred to stand where they\r\ndid in 1690, when they defeated James II and his Catholic followers, in\r\nthe battle of the Boyne, and fought for William of Orange for the\r\nEnglish throne and liberty and Protestantism. Their opposition to Home\r\nRule for Ireland grew out of their hostility to Roman Catholicism and\r\nthe fear of its supremacy.\r\n\r\nAfter six months of earnest debate in the House of Commons, the Home\r\nRule Bill for Ireland was passed, with slight amendments, September 1,\r\n1893, by a vote of 301 to 267, a majority of thirty-four, The struggle\r\nwas perhaps the most heated in the history of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe bill was sent to the House of Lords, where it was defeated,\r\nmidnight, September 8, by the surprising majority of 419 to 41, after\r\nonly one week's discussion. Members that never attended were drummed up\r\nto vote against the bill. The usual working force of the House of Lords\r\nis from thirty to forty members. The vote was the largest ever taken in\r\nthe Lords.\r\n\r\nAt once the cry, \"Down with, the House of Lords!\" was heard. The\r\nNational Liberal Federation issued a circular, in which were the words:\r\n\"The question of mending or ending the House of Lords ... displaces for\r\nawhile all other subjects of reform.\" Mr. Gladstone was probably aware\r\nof the contents of this manifesto before it was issued, and the\r\nsentiments were in accord with those uttered by him two years before at\r\nNew Castle.\r\n\r\nSeptember 27th, Mr. Gladstone addressed his constituents at Edinburgh.\r\nHe was received with an outburst of enthusiasm. He said that the\r\nPeople's Chamber had passed the bill. If the nation was determined it\r\nwould not be baffled by the Peers. If the Commons should go before the\r\ncountry, then the Lords should go too, and if defeated, should do what\r\nthe Commons would do--clear out.\r\n\r\nThe Queen wanted Mr. Gladstone to appeal to the country, and there was\r\nan opinion among some that Mr. Gladstone would be defeated at the polls\r\nupon the question; but the Premier intimated to the Queen his intention\r\nnot to appeal, and announced the readiness of the Cabinet to be\r\ndismissed by the Queen. However, the Queen would hardly expose the\r\nthrone to the danger threatening the Peers.\r\n\r\nDecember 29, 1893, Mr. Gladstone attained the eighty-fourth year of his\r\nage. When he entered the House of Commons that day his political\r\nassociates of the Liberal party all rose anta greeted him with cheers.\r\nWhen the applause had subsided, the Conservatives raised their hats and\r\ntheir leader, Mr. Balfour, rose and tendered his congratulations. Mr.\r\nGladstone was much pleased with the demonstrations of his friends, as\r\nwell as with the graceful compliments of his political opponents.\r\nBesides about two hundred congratulatory messages, letters and telegrams\r\nwere received, those from Queen Victoria, and the Prince and Princess of\r\nWales, being among the first.\r\n\r\nJuly 6, 1893, Prince George of Wales, Duke of York, and Princess Mary of\r\nTeck were married. The Prince was by inheritance heir, after the Prince\r\nof Wales, to the throne of England. Mr. Gladstone attended the wedding,\r\narrayed in the blue and gold uniform of a brother of the Trinity House,\r\nwith naval epaulettes, and was conducted to the royal pew reserved\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nAmong the great measures proposed at this time by Mr. Gladstone were the\r\nEmployers' Liability, and the Parish Councils Bills. The latter was as\r\nevolutionary and as revolutionary as the Home Rule Bill. Its object was\r\nto take the control of 10,000 rural English parishes out of the hands of\r\nthe squire and the parson and put it into the hands of the people. With\r\nits amendments regarding woman suffrage, to which Mr. Gladstone was\r\nopposed, it gave to every man and woman in England one vote--and only\r\none--in local affairs. February 21, 1894, when Mr. Gladstone had\r\nreturned from Biarritz, where he had gone for his health, there was\r\nagain a notable assemblage in the House of Commons to hear him speak. It\r\nwas expected that he would make a bitter attack upon the House of Lords,\r\nwhich had attempted to defeat both these bills by amendments. But he\r\ncalmly spoke of the lamentable divergence between the two branches of\r\nthe legislature upon the Employers' Liability Bill, and asked that the\r\namendment be rejected, which was done by a majority of 225 to 6. The\r\nbill was therefore withdrawn, and the responsibility of its defeat\r\nthrown upon the Lords. The House also rejected all the important\r\namendments of the Parish Councils Bill, but concurred in the unimportant\r\nchanges made by the Lords. It was sent back then to the lords, and\r\nfinally passed by them. But Mr. Gladstone greatly disappointed many of\r\nhis political friends by his mild manner of dealing with the House of\r\nLords. The extreme Radicals were angered and condemned severely the\r\nPremier for what they called his \"backing down\" and his \"feeble speech.\"\r\n\r\nRumors in reference to Mr. Gladstone's resignation, which had been\r\nstarted by the _Pall Mall Gazette_, while he was yet at Biarritz, were\r\nnow renewed. February 28, 1894, Mr. Gladstone informed the Queen of his\r\ncontemplated retirement, giving as reasons his failing eyesight,\r\ndeafness and age. March 1st, he made an important speech in the House of\r\nCommons. He displayed so much vigor and earnestness in his speech that\r\nit was thought that he had given up the idea of retiring. But this was\r\nhis last speech as Premier. March 2d, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone were\r\nsummoned to Windsor, where they dined with the Queen, and remained over\r\nnight. Saturday, March 3, 1894, Mr. Gladstone tendered his resignation\r\nas Premier to the Queen, who accepted it with many expressions of favor\r\nand regret, and offered him again a peerage, which was declined. On the\r\nway to Windsor and return to London, Mr. Gladstone was greeted by a\r\nlarge and enthusiastic crowd. Hundreds of letters and telegrams\r\nexpressing regret, because of his retirement, were received by the\r\nex-Premier, On Sunday he attended church as usual and was looking well,\r\nMr. Balfour in the Commons, and Lord Salisbury in the Lords, vied with\r\nMr. Gladstone's political friends in speaking his praise, and referring\r\nin the highest terms to his character and labors. The press in all parts\r\nof the world spoke in glowing terms of his natural endowments, great\r\nattainments, invaluable services, pure character and wonderfully\r\nvigorous old age. It was quite evident that Mr. Gladstone's retirement\r\nwas not enforced by mental or physical infirmities, or by his unfitness\r\nfor the leadership of the House and the Premiership, but that as a wise\r\nprecaution, and upon the solicitation of his family, he had laid down\r\nhis power while he was yet able to wield it with astonishing vigor. Thus\r\nclosed the fourth administration of this remarkable man, the greatest\r\nEnglish statesman of his time. In all history there is no parallel case,\r\nand no official record such as his.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery was appointed Premier in the place of Mr. Gladstone, and\r\nSir William V. Harcourt became the leader of the Liberal party in the\r\nHouse of Commons. Mr. Gladstone wrote congratulating Lord Rosebery, and\r\npromised to aid him whenever his assistance was required. In assuming\r\noffice Lord Rosebery eulogized Mr. Gladstone, and announced that there\r\nwould be no change in the policy of reform of the Liberal party under\r\nthe new administration, and declared for Home Rule for Ireland, the\r\ndisestablishment of the church in Wales and Scotland, and the reform of\r\nthe House of Lords.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nIN PRIVATE LIFE\r\n\r\nJustin McCarthy, in the closing pages of his Story of Gladstone's Life,\r\nsays: \"The long political struggle was over and done. The heat of the\r\nopposition this way and that had gone out forever, and Mr. Gladstone had\r\nnone left but friends on both sides of the political field. Probably\r\nthat ceremonial, that installation of the Prince of Wales as Chancellor\r\nof the Welsh University, was the last occasion on which Mr. Gladstone\r\nwould consent to make an appearance on a public platform. It was a\r\ngraceful close to such a great career.\"\r\n\r\nThe occasion referred to was the ceremonial at Aberystwith, Wales, June\r\n26, 1896, when the Prince of Wales was installed as Chancellor of the\r\nWelsh University, and when the Prince presented to the Princess of Wales\r\nand to Mr. Gladstone honorary degrees conferred upon them by the\r\nUniversity. The appearance of Mr. Gladstone was the signal for great\r\napplause. The Prince in his remarks was very complimentary to Mr.\r\nGladstone, and spoke of the honor paid the University by the presence of\r\nthe aged scholar and statesman, and also said it was truly one of the\r\nproudest moments of his life, when he found himself in the flattering\r\nposition of being able to confer an academic honor upon one furnishing\r\nthe rare instance of occupying the highest position as a statesman and\r\nwho at the same time had attained such distinction in scholarship.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. McCarthy was mistaken about this being the closing public\r\nservice in the life of Mr. Gladstone. It was very far from his last\r\npublic appearance. After that event Mr. Gladstone appeared repeatedly.\r\nThough his official life had closed, yet he was to emerge from\r\nretirement many times, and especially when it became necessary for him\r\nto raise his strong voice for humanity. His advocacy of the great causes\r\nof Armenian rescue, of Grecian independence, of Arbitration instead of\r\nWar, and the unity and harmony of the two great English-speaking people,\r\nwas given with all the old time fire of youth. What Mr. Gladstone did\r\nand said with pen and voice since the occasion mentioned, was enough not\r\nonly for another chapter, but a whole volume, and sufficient alone to\r\nimmortalize any man.\r\n\r\nAfter the great struggle for Home Rule and during the sultry summer of\r\n1893, Mr. Gladstone repaired to his favorite winter resort, Biarritz, in\r\nthe south of France, It was while he was there that rumors of his\r\nresignation were heard, based on the ground of his failing health. Dr.\r\nGranger, of Chester, who was also an oculist, was summoned to examine\r\nMr. Gladstone's eyes. He told Mr. Gladstone that a cataract had\r\nobliterated the sight of one eye, and that another cataract had begun to\r\nform on the other. In other words Mr. Gladstone was threatened with\r\ntotal blindness. The Prime Minister reflected a moment, and then\r\nrequested--almost ordered--the physician to operate immediately upon his\r\neye. He said: \"I wish you to remove the cataract at once.\" The physician\r\nreplied that it was not far enough advanced for an operation. \"You do\r\nnot understand me,\" answered the patient, \"it is the old cataract I wish\r\nremoved. If that is out of the way, I shall still have one good eye,\r\nwhen the new cataract impairs the sight of the other.\" As the physician\r\nstill hesitated, Mr. Gladstone continued: \"You still seem not to\r\nunderstand me. I want you to perform the operation here and now while I\r\nam sitting in this chair.\" \"But it might not be successful,\" said Dr.\r\nGranger. \"That is a risk I accept,\" was the instant reply. However, the\r\nphysician dared not then undertake it, and afterwards said that Mr.\r\nGladstone's eyes were as good as they were a year before, and that his\r\ngeneral health was also good.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1894, Mr. Gladstone's eye was successfully operated upon for\r\ncataract. He took no anaesthetic, and was conscious during the time.\r\nEvery precaution was taken to insure success, and the patient was put to\r\nbed for rest and quiet and kept on low diet. Mr. Gladstone's eyes were\r\nso improved by judicious treatment that before long he could read ten or\r\ntwelve hours a day. This could be regarded as complete restoration of\r\nsight, and enabled him, upon his retirement from public life, to devote\r\nhimself to the work he so well loved when at home in his study\r\nat Hawarden.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's retirement from public life, from the Premiership, the\r\nCabinet, the leadership of the Liberal Party, and from Parliament did\r\nnot mean his entrance upon a period of inactivity. In the shades of\r\nHawarden and in the quiet of his study he kept up the industry that had\r\ncharacterized his whole life heretofore.\r\n\r\nIt had been the custom for centuries for English statesmen, upon\r\nretiring from official life, to devote themselves to the classics. Mr.\r\nGladstone, who was pre-eminently a statesman-scholar, found it very\r\ncongenial to his mind and habits to follow this old English custom. He\r\nfirst translated and published \"The Odes of Horace.\" Then he took\r\nButler's \"Analogy\" as a text book, and prepared and published \"Studies\r\nSubsidiary to the Works of Bishop Butler.\" The discussion necessarily\r\ntakes a wide range, treating, among other matters, of Butler's method,\r\nits application to the Scriptures, the future life, miracles and the\r\nmediation of Christ. Says W.T. Stead: \"No one who reads the strenuous\r\narguments with which Mr. Gladstone summarizes the reasoning of Bishop\r\nButler on the future life is conscious of any weakening in the vigorous\r\ndialectic which was so often employed with brilliant success in the\r\nHouse of Commons.\"\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Gladstone's latest productions was his \"Personal\r\nRecollections of Arthur H. Hallam,\" which was written for the \"Youth's\r\nCompanion.\" It is a tribute to the memory and worth of one of his early\r\nfriends at Eton.\r\n\r\nThese and other literary works occupied most of his time. But Mr.\r\nGladstone would not content himself with quiet literary work. He had too\r\nlong and too intensely been active in the world's great movements and on\r\nhumanity's behalf to stand aloof. Hence it was not long before he was\r\nagain in the arena, doing valiant service for the Armenian and\r\nagainst the Turk.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the Sultan, in the execution of a plan devised in 1890, issued\r\nan edict against religious freedom. In 1894, he threw off the mask and\r\nbegan to execute his deliberate and preconcerted plan to force all\r\nChristian Armenians to become Mohammedans or to die. Robbery, outrage\r\nand murder were the means used by the hands of brutal soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to an indignation meeting held in London, December 17th,\r\n1894, Mr. Gladstone wrote denouncing these outrages of the Turks. The\r\nreading of the letter was greeted with prolonged applause.\r\n\r\nA deputation of Armenian gentlemen, residing in London and in Paris,\r\ntook occasion on Mr. Gladstone's 85th birthday, December 29th, 1894, to\r\npresent a silver chalice to Hawarden Church as \"a memorial of Mr.\r\nGladstone's sympathy with and assistance to the Armenian people.\" Mr.\r\nGladstone's address to the deputation was regarded as one of the most\r\npeculiar and characteristic acts of his life. He gave himself wholly to\r\nthe cause of these oppressed people, and was stirred by the outrages and\r\nmurders perpetrated upon them as he was 18 years before. He said that\r\nthe Turks should go out as they did go out of Bulgaria \"bag and\r\nbaggage,\" and he denounced the government of the Sultan as \"a disgrace\r\nto Mahomet, the prophet whom it professed to follow, a disgrace to\r\ncivilization at large, and a curse to mankind.\" He contended that every\r\nnation had ever the right and the authority to act \"on behalf of\r\nhumanity and of justice.\"\r\n\r\nThere were those who condemned Mr. Gladstone's speech, declaring that it\r\nmight disrupt the peace of Europe, but there were many others who\r\nthought that the sooner peace secured at such a cost was disturbed the\r\nbetter. It was but natural for those who wrongfully claimed the\r\nsovereign right to oppress their own subjects, to denounce all\r\ninterference in the affairs of the Sultan.\r\n\r\nIt was reported, March 19, 1895, that Francis Seymour Stevenson, M.P.,\r\nChairman of the Anglo-Armenian Association, on behalf of the Tiflis\r\nArmenians, would present to Mr. Gladstone, on his return to London, the\r\nancient copy of the Armenian Gospels, inscribed upon vellum, which was\r\nto accompany the address to the ex-Premier, then being signed by the\r\nArmenians there. In a letter Mr. Gladstone had but recently declared\r\nthat he had abandoned all hope that the condition of affairs in Armenia\r\nwould change for the better. The Sultan, he declared, was no longer\r\nworthy of the courtesies of diplomatic usage, or of Christian tolerance.\r\nMr. Gladstone promised that when these Gospels were formally presented\r\nto him he would deliver a \"rattling\" address on behalf of the Armenians.\r\nWhen a delegation waited on him, he said, after assuring them of his\r\nsympathy, that the danger in the Armenian situation now was that useful\r\naction might be abandoned, in view of the promises of the Turkish\r\nGovernment to institute reforms.\r\n\r\nIn June 1895, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone attended the opening of the Kaiser\r\nWilhelm Canal as guests of Sir Donald Currie, on his steamship\r\nTantallon Castle, returning home on the twenty-fifth. During this trip\r\nan effort was made to arrange for an interview between the Ex-Premier\r\nand the Prince Bismarck, but the Prince seemed disinclined and the\r\nproject failed.\r\n\r\nIt was while Mr. Gladstone was at Kiel, that the Rosebery Ministry fell\r\nby an accidental defeat of the Liberal Party in Parliament, and which\r\nagain brought Mr. Gladstone to the front in the public mind. Lord\r\nRosebery telegraphed Mr. Gladstone full particulars of the situation,\r\nand Mr. Gladstone strongly advised against the resignation of the\r\nGovernment and urged that a vote of confidence be taken. Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrote that the Liberal Party could well afford to stand on its record.\r\nThe Ministry with but two exceptions, was the same, as that formed by\r\nMr. Gladstone in August 1892, and had his confidence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the cabinet of Lord Rosebery resigned, and the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury again became Prime Minister,--on the very day of Mr.\r\nGladstone's arrival home. However Lord Rosebery retained the leadership\r\nof the Liberal Party.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that if the wishes of the Liberal Party had been\r\ngratified, Mr. Gladstone would have taken the leadership and again\r\nbecome Prime Minister. Subsequent events proved that he would have been\r\nequal, at least for a while, to the task of succeeding Lord Rosebery.\r\nBut Mr. Gladstone was not willing. He refused to re-enter Parliament,\r\nand wrote a letter to his old constituents at Midlothian, declining\r\ntheir kind offer to send him to the House and bade them a kind farewell.\r\nIn his letter he said that the Liberal Party is a party of progress and\r\nreform, and urged his constituents to stand by it. He regarded the\r\nchanges of the century exceedingly beneficial.\r\n\r\nAugust 6, 1895, Mr. Gladstone made a great speech at Chester. A meeting\r\nwas held in the Town Hall to arouse public sentiment against the\r\nslaughter of Armenian Christians within the Empire of the Sultan by\r\nTurkish soldiers, and to devise some means of putting an end to such\r\ncrimes, and of punishing the oppressor. The audience was very large,\r\nincluding many Armenians resident in England, and rose with vociferous\r\ncheering when Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, the Duke of Westminster, the\r\nBishop of Chester, and the Mayor of Chester entered the hall. The Bishop\r\nof Ripon was already there. The Duke of Westminster presided, and read a\r\nletter from the Marquis of Salisbury, the Premier.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone arose amid an outburst of enthusiastic applause, and\r\naddressing the vast audience said:\r\n\r\nThat the massacres in Armenia resulted from intolerable\r\ngovernment--perhaps the worst in the world. He offered a resolution\r\npledging the support of the entire nation to the British Government in\r\nits efforts to secure for the Armenians such reforms as would guarantee\r\nthe safety of life, honor, religion and property. Mr. Gladstone said\r\nthat language failed to describe the horrors of the massacre of Sussoun,\r\nwhich made the blood run cold. The Sultan was responsible, for these\r\nbarbarities were not the act of the criminal class, such as afflicts\r\nevery country, the malefactors who usually perpetrate horrible crime,\r\nbut were perpetrated by the agents of the Sultan--the soldiers and the\r\nKurds, tax-gatherers and police of the Turkish Government. And what had\r\nbeen done, and was daily being done, could be summed up in four awful\r\nwords--plunder, murder, rape and torture. Plunder and murder were bad\r\nenough, but these were almost venial by the side of the work of the\r\nravisher and the torturer. And the victims were defenceless men, women\r\nand children--Armenians, one of the oldest Christian civilized races,\r\nand one of the most pacific, industrious and intelligent races of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThere was no exaggeration in the language used to describe the horrible\r\noutrages visited upon whole communities of innocent and helpless people.\r\nThe truth of these terrible charges in their most hideous form, was\r\nestablished by unbiased American testimony, by Dr, Dillon, an eye\r\nwitness, and by the representatives of England, France and Russia.\r\n\r\nNothing but a sense of duty, said Mr. Gladstone, had brought him at his\r\nage to resign the repose, which was the last of many great earthly\r\nblessings remaining to him, to address them.\r\n\r\nIf the Powers of Europe were to recede before the irrational resistance\r\nof the Sultan, they would be disgraced in the eyes of the world, and the\r\nChristian population of the Turkish Empire would be doomed to\r\nextermination, according to the plan of the Porte. Terrible word, but\r\ntrue in its application.\r\n\r\nAs to the remedy the cleanest was to make the Turk march out of Armenia,\r\nas he did out of Bulgaria, \"bag and baggage.\" He cautioned against\r\ntrusting the promises of the government at Constantinople, which he knew\r\nfrom long experience, were worthless; and declared that the Sultan was\r\nbound by no treaty obligation. The word \"ought\" was not heeded at\r\nConstantinople, but the word \"must\" was understood fully there. Coercion\r\nwas a word perfectly comprehended there--a drastic dose which never\r\nfailed. If we have the smallest regard for humanity, he concluded, we\r\nshall, with the help of God, demand that which is just and necessary.\r\nMr. Gladstone was frequently and loudly applauded during his speech, at\r\nthe conclusion of which the resolution was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful voice in all Britain had been raised with stirring\r\nand thrilling power for justice and humanity. The testimony of an eye\r\nwitness is to the effect, that never did the grand old man seem in finer\r\nform. His undimmed eye flashed as he spoke with withering scorn against\r\nhypocrisy and with hottest hate against wrong. His natural force was not\r\nabated, his health robust, and his conviction unsubdued. His deeply\r\nlined and pale face was transfigured with the glow of righteous\r\nindignation. The aged statesman was in his old House of Commons vigor.\r\n\"There was the same facile movement of his body, and the same\r\npenetrating look as though he would pierce the very soul of his\r\nauditors; the same triumphant march of sentence after sentence to their\r\nchosen goal, and yet the same subtle method of introducing qualifying\r\nclauses all along the march without loosing the grip of his theme; the\r\nsame ascent to lofty principles and commanding generalizations, blended\r\nwith the complete mastery of details; and, above all, the same sublimity\r\nof outlook and ringing emphasis of sincerity in every tone.\" It was an\r\noccasion never to be forgotten. A distinguished hearer said: \"To read\r\nhis speech, as thousands will, is much; but to have heard it, to have\r\nfelt it-oh! that is simply indescribable, and will mark for many, one of\r\nthe most memorable days of this last decade of this closing century.\r\nThe sweet cadence of his voice, the fascination of his personality, and,\r\nabove all, the consecration of his splendid gifts to the cause of\r\nplundered men and ravished women, raise the occasion into prominence in\r\nthe annals of a great people. Chiefly, I feel the triumphs of soul. His\r\nutterance of the words 'wives,' 'women,' lifted them into an atmosphere\r\nof awe and solemnity, and his tone in speaking of 'rape' and 'torture'\r\ngave them an ineffable loathsomeness. It seemed as if so much soul had\r\nnever been put into a Saxon speech. Keen satire, rasping rebuke, an\r\navalanche of indignation, rapier-like thrusts to the vital fibre of the\r\nsituation, and withal the invincible cogency of argument against the\r\nTurkish Government, gave the oration a primary place amongst the\r\nmaster-pieces of human eloquence.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of this famous speech Mr. Gladstone referred to America;\r\nonce when welcoming the sympathy of the American people with the\r\nsuffering Armenians, and again as he described the testimony of the\r\nUnited States as a witness that gained enormously in value because it\r\nwas entirely free from suspicion.\r\n\r\nA large meeting was held in St. James Hall, London, October 19, 1896, in\r\nmemory of Christian Martyrs in Turkey. The Bishop of Rochester presided.\r\nThe hall was packed with an audience of 2,600, while nearly 7,000\r\napplied for admission. Many prominent persons were present. The large\r\naudience was in sombre funeral attire. About thirty front seats were\r\noccupied by Armenians. It was stated that 60,000 Armenians so far had\r\nbeen murdered with tortures and indignities indescribable. To this\r\nmeeting Mr. Gladstone addressed a letter which was greeted with the\r\nwildest enthusiasm. He said that he hoped the meeting would worthily\r\ncrown the Armenian meetings of the past two months, which were without a\r\nparallel during his political life. The great object, he said, was to\r\nstrengthen Lord Salisbury's hands and to stop the series of massacres,\r\nwhich were probably still unfinished, and to provide against their\r\nrenewal. As he believed that Lord Salisbury would use his powerful\r\nposition for the best, personally he objected in the strongest manner to\r\nabridging Lord Salisbury's discretion by laying down this or that as\r\nthings which he ought not to do. It was a wild paradox, without the\r\nsupport of reason or history, to say that the enforcement of treaty\r\nrights to stop systematic massacre, together with effective security\r\nagainst Great Britain's abusing them for selfish ends, would provoke the\r\nhostilities of one or more of the powers.\r\n\r\nTo advertise beforehand in the ears of the Great Assassin that Great\r\nBritain's action would cut down--what the most backward of the six\r\nPowers think to be sufficient--would be the; abandonment of duty and\r\nprudence and would be to doom the national movement to disappointment.\r\nThe concert of Europe was valuable and important, but such an\r\nannouncement would be certain to be followed by its failure.\r\n\r\nOne of the immediate effects of Mr. Gladstone's denunciation of the\r\nSultan for the Armenian massacres was the resignation by Lord Rosebery\r\nof the leadership of the Liberal Party. Mr. Gladstone's return to\r\npolitics, the agitation of the Turkish question and the differences\r\nbetween these two leaders of the Liberal movement as to the best way of\r\ndealing with the Sultan, were assigned as reasons by Lord Rosebery for\r\nhis resignation.\r\n\r\nIt was then again suggested that Mr. Gladstone assume the leadership of\r\nthe Liberal Party and accept a peerage and a seat in the House of Lords,\r\nso often tendered him by the Queen. Then Sir William Vernon-Harcourt\r\ncould lead in the House of Commons and bear the burden, while Mr.\r\nGladstone could be at the head of affairs without the worry of the House\r\nof Commons. Besides, Mr. Morgan offered to resign his seat in the House\r\nof Commons in his favor. But Mr. Gladstone would not agree to any of\r\nthese plans as far as they pertained to himself.\r\n\r\nJuly 22, 1896, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone returned to London to attend a\r\ngreat social function, the marriage of one of the daughters of the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales to Prince Charles of Denmark. Mr. Gladstone\r\nevinced much interest in everything connected with the important event,\r\nand was himself the object of much attention.\r\n\r\nSeptember 23, 1896, Mr. Gladstone wrote a long letter to the Paris\r\nFigaro in response to an appeal from its editor, M. Leudet, to Mr.\r\nGladstone to arouse the French press in behalf of the Armenians. After\r\nexpressing his diffidence in complying with the request, Mr. Gladstone\r\ndeclared his belief that the population of Great Britain were more\r\nunited in sentiment and more thoroughly aroused by the present outrages\r\nin Turkey than they were by the atrocities in Bulgaria in 1876.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"The question whether effect can be given to the national\r\nindignation is now in the balance, and will probably soon be decided. I\r\nhave read in some Austrian newspapers an affected scruple against sole\r\naction by any one State in a European crisis, but there are two\r\nfirst-class Powers who will not make that scruple their own. One of\r\nthese is Russia, who in 1878, earned lasting honors by liberating\r\nBulgaria and, helping onward the freedom and security of other Balkan\r\nStates. The other Power is France, who, in 1840, took up the cause of\r\nEgypt and pushed it single handed to the verge of a European war. She\r\nwisely forbore to bring about that horrible, transcendent calamity, but\r\nI gravely doubt whether she was not right and the combined Powers wrong\r\nin their policy of that period.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone denounced the Sultan as the \"Great Assassin,\" and\r\ncontinued: \"For more than a year he has triumphed over the diplomacy of\r\nthe six Powers, they have been laid prostrate at his feet. There is no\r\nparallel in history to the humiliation they have patiently borne. He has\r\ntherefore had every encouragement to continue a course that has been\r\ncrowned with such success. The impending question seems to be, not\r\nwhether, but when and where he will proceed to his next murderous\r\nexploits. The question for Europe and each Power is whether he shall be\r\npermitted to swell by more myriads the tremendous total of his victims.\r\n\r\n\"In other years when I possessed power I did my best to promote the\r\nconcert of Europe, but I sorrowfully admit that all the good done in\r\nTurkey during the last twenty years was done, not by it, but more nearly\r\ndespite it.\" The letter concludes by expressing the hope that the French\r\npeople would pursue a policy worthy of their greatness, their fame and\r\nthe high place they have held in European Christian history.\r\n\r\nSeptember 24, 1896, a meeting was called by the Reform Club, of\r\nLiverpool, to protest against the recent massacres of 2000 Armenians at\r\nConstantinople at the affair of the Ottoman Bank, and many more\r\nthroughout the Turkish Empire. Mr. Gladstone was asked to address the\r\nmeeting. When requested by the agent of the Associated Press for an\r\nadvanced proof of his speech he declined, but wrote that he would\r\n\"recommend giving the warmest support to the Queen's government, and\r\nwould contend that England should act alone if necessary for the\r\nfulfillment of the covenants which have been so disgracefully broken.\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Gladstone, with their son Herbert, arrived at noon at\r\nLiverpool, and were met at the railroad station by 2,000 enthusiastic\r\npeople. The meeting was held in the vast auditorium of the Circus\r\nBuilding, which was filled. Thousands failed to obtain entrance.\r\n\r\nBefore the arrival of Mr. Gladstone there was a spontaneous outburst of\r\napplause, everybody present standing and singing \"God save the Queen.\"\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone entered, the prolonged roar of applause could be\r\nheard for miles, arising from thousands inside and outside the hall.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Derby, Conservative, presided. He was accompanied by the\r\nCountess of Derby, who with many distinguished persons occupied\r\nthe platform.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone stepped briskly to the front of the platform at 12.30 p.m.\r\nbowing repeatedly in response to the applause. He looked strong and\r\nwell for a man of his age and labors, and was easily heard. After a few\r\npreliminary remarks, he moved the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"That this meeting trusts that Her Majesty's ministers, realizing to the\r\nfullest extent the terrible condition in which their fellow Christians\r\nare placed, will do everything possible to obtain for them full security\r\nand protection; and this meeting assures Her Majesty's ministers that\r\nthey may rely upon the cordial support of the citizens of Liverpool in\r\nwhatever steps they may feel it necessary to take for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe resolution was received with great cheering.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone resumed: \"We have a just title to threaten Turkey with\r\ncoercion, but that does not in itself mean war; and I think that the\r\nfirst step should be the recall of our Ambassador, and it should be\r\nfollowed by the dismissal of the Turkish Ambassador from London. Such a\r\ncourse is frequent and would not give the right of complaint to anybody.\r\nWhen diplomatic relations are suspended, England should inform the\r\nSultan that she should consider the means of enforcing her just and\r\nhumane demands. I do not believe that Europe will make war to insure the\r\ncontinuance of massacres more terrible than ever recorded in the dismal,\r\ndeplorable history of crime.\r\n\r\n\"Now, as in 1876, to the guilt of massacre is added the impudence of\r\ndenial, which will continue just as long as Europe is content to listen.\r\nI doubt if it is an exaggeration to say that it was in the Sultan's\r\npalace, and there only, that the inspiration has been supplied, and the\r\npolicy devised of the whole series of massacres. When the Sultan carries\r\nmassacre into his own capital under the eyes of the Ambassadors, he\r\nappears to have gained the very acme of what it is possible for him to\r\ndo. But the weakness of diplomacy, I trust, is about to be strengthened\r\nby the echo of this nation's voice.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone then referred to the supineness of the Ambassadors of the\r\nPowers at Constantinople, and continued: \"The concert of Europe is an\r\naugust and useful instrument, but it has not usually succeeded in\r\ndealing with the Eastern question, which has arrived at a period when it\r\nis necessary to strengthen the hands of the Government by an expression\r\nof national opinion. I believe that the continued presence of the\r\nAmbassadors at Constantinople has operated as a distinct countenance to\r\nthe Sultan, who is thus their recognized ally.\r\n\r\n\"But, while urging the Government to act, it does not follow that, even\r\nfor the sake of the great object in view, Great Britain should\r\ntransplant Europe into a state of war. On the other hand, however, I\r\ndeny that England must abandon her own right to independent judgment\r\nand allow herself to be domineered over by the other powers.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone expressed the opinion that the purpose of the meeting was\r\ndefensive and prospective, saying that no one can hold out the hope that\r\nthe massacres are ended, although he ventured to anticipate that the\r\nwords spoken at the meeting would find their way to the palace at\r\nConstantinople. \"The present movement,\" he said, \"is based on broad\r\ngrounds of humanity, and is not directed against the Mohammedans, but\r\nagainst the Turkish officials, evidence of whose barbarities rests in\r\ncredible official reports.\" Mr. Gladstone declared his adhesion to the\r\nprinciples contained in the resolution, and said he came to the meeting\r\nnot claiming any authority for sentiments expressed except that of a\r\ncitizen of Liverpool.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" he remarked, \"the national platform upon which the meeting is\r\nbased gives greater authority for sentiments universally entertained\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the land, and I urge that in this\r\nmatter party sympathy be renounced. I entertain the lively hope and\r\nstrong belief that the present deplorable situation is not due to the\r\nact or default of the Government of this great country.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone spoke about twenty minutes and was repeatedly interrupted\r\nby applause. He was in good voice, and did not seem fatigued when he\r\nhad finished.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Turkish Embassy at London telegraphed Mr. Gladstone's\r\nspeech at Liverpool verbatim to the Sultan.\r\n\r\nThe London Times in an editorial said: \"The spectacle of the veteran\r\nstatesman quitting his retirement to plead the cause of the oppressed is\r\nwell calculated to move the sympathy and admiration of the nation. The\r\nardor of Mr. Gladstone's feelings on this subject is notorious. All the\r\nmore striking and significant is the comparative restraint and\r\nmoderation of the speech.\"\r\n\r\nOther questions besides those mentioned were claiming the attention of\r\nEnglish statesmen. In the Spring, prior to the great Liverpool meeting,\r\nthe Venezuela boundary question was agitating the two great English\r\nspeaking nations to the very verge of war. A large Peace Meeting was\r\nheld in London, March 3, 1896, to favor arbitration. Mr. Gladstone\r\nwrote: \"I am glad that the discussion of arbitration is to be separated\r\nfrom the Venezuela question, upon which I do not feel myself in final\r\nand full possession of the facts that I should wish. My views on\r\narbitration in place of war were gathered from the part I took in the\r\nmatter of the Alabama claims. I will only add that my conviction and\r\nsentiment on the subject grow in strength from year to year in\r\nproportion to the growth of that monstrous and barbarous militarism, in\r\nregard to which I consider England has to bear no small responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting favored permanent international arbitration, and an\r\nAnglo-American treaty was finally signed by the representatives of the\r\ntwo nations, providing for the settlement of all questions between the\r\ntwo nations by arbitration instead of by war, but the Senate of the\r\nUnited States refused to ratify the treaty.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone deplored intensely the extraordinary misunderstanding\r\nwhich had prevailed on the subject of the Venezuela frontier. He seemed\r\nto think that nothing but a little common sense was needed to secure the\r\npacific settlement of the question at any moment. A hundred square miles\r\nmore or less on either side of the boundary of British Guiana was to him\r\na matter of supreme indifference. He was extremely anxious to see\r\njustice done, and one of his last speeches in the House of Commons was\r\nin favor of permanent arbitration between England and the United States.\r\n\r\nAnother one of the absorbing questions that came before the civilized\r\nworld for consideration, and almost to the exclusion of the Armenian\r\nquestion, was the Cretan Question. Greece heroically sustained the\r\ninsurrection of the Cretans against the Turkish rule. The scene of\r\nTurkish cruelty was now transferred to the isle of Crete. For the time\r\nthe Armenian massacres were forgotten. The Greeks rushed to the rescue,\r\nwhile all Europe held aloof. Mr. Gladstone sent the following dispatch\r\nto the Chronicle: \"I do not dare to stimulate Greece when I cannot help\r\nher, but I shall profoundly rejoice at her success. I hope the Powers\r\nwill recollect that they have their own character to redeem.\" This was\r\nin February, 1897, Later he wrote that to expel the Greek troops from\r\nCrete and keep as police the butchers of Armenia, would further deepen\r\nthe disgrace of the Powers of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1897, Mr. Gladstone addressed a letter, now justly celebrated,\r\non the same subject to the Duke of Westminster in which he expressed his\r\nopinion more fully, and which was evidently the sentiment of the English\r\nspeaking people of the world. The letter was in the form of a pamphlet\r\nof 16 pages, published, and entitled The Eastern Crisis.\r\n\r\nIn less than a week after this eloquent manifesto in behalf of the\r\nCretans and of Greece was put forth, it was currently reported that the\r\nprecise solution of the problem recommended by Mr. Gladstone was likely\r\nto be adopted. The Sultan himself, fearful of the effect of the appeal\r\non public opinion in Europe, sought the settlement of the question in\r\nthe manner suggested. The Greeks still clamored for war. In the war\r\nthat followed between Greece and Turkey, Greece was defeated and crushed\r\nby the Turk. Only by the intervention of the Powers was Greece saved\r\nfrom becoming a part of the Sultan's Empire.\r\n\r\nAfter peace had been concluded between Turkey and Greece, Mr. Gladstone\r\nundertook to arouse public opinion by a trenchant review of the\r\nsituation. Looking back over the past two years of England's Eastern\r\npolicy, he inquires as to what have been the results, and then answers\r\nhis own question. He thus enumerates:\r\n\r\n1. The slaughter of 100,000 Armenian Christians, men, women and\r\nchildren, with no guarantee against a repetition of the crime.\r\n\r\n2. The Turkish Umpire stronger than at any time since the Crimean war.\r\n\r\n3. Christian Greece weaker than at any time since she became a kingdom.\r\n\r\nThese are facts, Mr. Gladstone claimed, for which the leading Christian\r\nnations and statesmen of Europe are responsible.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Gladstone thus expresses himself, yet his vigorous protests\r\nhad not been without effect. His voice penetrated into the very palace\r\nof the Sultan, and into every Cabinet of Europe, and was heard by every\r\nstatesman and ruler throughout the world, and aroused the people\r\neverywhere. It was a mighty voice lifted for right and against\r\noppression. The Sultan was afraid and was compelled to desist; not that\r\nhe feared the protests and the warnings of the Christian Nations of\r\nEurope, but because that one voice was the expression of the popular\r\nfeeling of all Christians throughout the world, and to defy such\r\nsentiment would be to court the overthrow of his throne, if not of the\r\ndominion of the Turk in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1894, an invitation was extended to Mr. Gladstone to visit the\r\nUnited States, signed by many representative men in public life. But Mr.\r\nGladstone, while acknowledging the compliment, declined because of his\r\nage. It would, he thought, be a tremendous undertaking for him. The\r\nfatigue of the voyage and the strain of the receptions while in America,\r\nwould prove greater than his physical condition could bear.\r\n\r\nLater Mr. Gladstone was waited on at Hawarden by one hundred members of\r\nthe Philadelphia Manufacturer's Club. He personally escorted them over\r\nthe Castle grounds and narrated the history of the Castle to them.\r\nGreatly pleased with the warmth of their reception, they thanked Mr.\r\nGladstone for his courtesy. They then gave him three cheers. This token\r\nof appreciation was very gratifying to Mr. Gladstone, who said that it\r\nwas the first time he had ever heard American cheers.\r\n\r\nSaturday afternoon, August 15, 1896, Li Hung Chang, the great Chinese\r\nStatesman and Embassador, visited Mr. Gladstone at Hawarden. Probably\r\nthe three greatest living statesmen of the time were Gladstone, Bismarck\r\nand Li Hung Chang. The Embassador and his suite went to Chester in a\r\nspecial train, and were driven in three open carriages to Hawarden.\r\nAlong the route as, well as at the station, the party was cheered by a\r\nlarge crowd. The Viceroy was sleeping when the train reached Chester and\r\nhe was allowed to sleep until he awoke. Yet the party was ahead of time\r\nin reaching the Castle, but Mr. Gladstone hastened to receive them. The\r\nChinese visitors were received at the door by Mr. Henry Gladstone. Li\r\nHung Chang was escorted into the Library where he was introduced to Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nThe intention of Mr. Gladstone was to have as escort a guard of honor to\r\nthe Viceroy, the Hawarden corps of the Welsh Fusiliers, which reached\r\nthe Castle, owing to the visitors being ahead of time, ten minutes after\r\nthe arrival of the party.\r\n\r\nThe two aged statesmen sat near the window overlooking the terrace, and\r\nat once, with the aid of Lo Feug Luh, engaged in conversation, Li asked\r\nvarious questions concerning Mr. Gladstone's career, and was informed by\r\nMr. Gladstone that he had been Prime Minister nearly thirteen years,\r\nand in the Cabinet nearly twenty-four years. When complimented upon the\r\nservice he had rendered to his country, Mr. Gladstone replied that he\r\nhad done what he could, but he should have done a great deal more. Li\r\nobserved that British interests and British trade in China were greater\r\nthan those of all other countries put together. The Viceroy also talked\r\nwith Mr. Gladstone of free trade, of restrictions upon commerce, of the\r\npower of the British Navy, of the greatness of the British Revenues, of\r\nthe vastness of the Colonial Empire, of the necessity of a railway\r\nsystem to commerce and upon a number of similar subjects. Refreshments\r\nwere served which Li enjoyed, and then by request he wrote his autograph\r\nin three books, using Dorothy Drew's colors for the purpose. Mr.\r\nGladstone and Li were photographed together sitting on chairs outside\r\nthe porch. Mr. Gladstone presented Li with three books from his library,\r\nand then the Chinese visitors departed.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening October 10, 1896, the Right Hon. and Most Rev.\r\nEdward White Benson, D.D., Archbishop of Canterbury and Primate of all\r\nEngland, arrived at Hawarden with Mrs. Benson on a visit to his old\r\nfriend Mr. Gladstone. Sunday morning Dr. Benson went with the Gladstone\r\nfamily to Hawarden Church and occupied the Gladstone pew. After the\r\nservice had commenced a commotion was observed. It was caused by the\r\nfall of Dr. Benson In the pew while kneeling in prayer. Attendants\r\nremoved Dr. Benson to the Rectory, and medical aid was summoned, but\r\ndeath came soon after from apoplexy. The Rev. Stephen Gladstone, rector,\r\nproceeded with the service until notified of the death of the\r\nArchbishop, when he dismissed the congregation. Mr. Gladstone, who had\r\nnot attended church from indisposition, was deeply affected by the death\r\nof his guest and friend.\r\n\r\nThe morning papers of London, June 1, 1896, printed a long letter from\r\nMr. Gladstone to Cardinal Rampolla for submission to the Pope Leo XIII,\r\nin favor of the unity of Christendom by means of a papal declaration in\r\nfavor of the validity of Anglican orders. It created a great sensation.\r\nShortly after this the Pope issued an Encyclical letter addressed to\r\n\"all bishops in communion with the Holy See.\" The theme was the same as\r\nthat of Mr. Gladstone's letter, to which it was regarded as an answer.\r\nThe Pope invited all the English people \"to return to the religion of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church.\" \"This,\" remarks Mr. Justin McCarthy, \"was\r\nexactly what any thoughtful person might have expected.\" While this\r\nletter and its answer did not satisfy the clergy of the established\r\nChurch of England, who were favorably disposed towards Rome, on the\r\nother hand it aroused the dissenting Christians of England to reply\r\nthat they were opposed to all state or established churches, whether\r\nRoman Catholic or English Episcopal.\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 1896, the eighty-seventh anniversary of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nbirth was celebrated at Hawarden, surrounded by his family and friends.\r\nThere were the usual demonstrations by the villagers, consisting in the\r\nringing of bells and the appointments of deputations to wait upon the\r\naged statesman at the Castle with congratulations. An enormous flow of\r\ntelegrams and messages continued throughout the day from all parts of\r\nthe kingdom, the United States and the Continent. Among those sending\r\ncongratulations were the Prince and Princess of Wales, and Baroness de\r\nRothschild. Mr. Gladstone was in good health, and in the afternoon went\r\nout for a walk.\r\n\r\nMay 10, 1897, the Prince and Princess of Wales, accompanied by the\r\nPrincess Victoria, visited Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone at Hawarden. They were\r\nreceived by Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone in the porch erected in 1889 to\r\ncommemorate their golden wedding. The mutual greetings were of the\r\nheartiest nature. The royal party inspected the ruins of the old castle,\r\nMr. Gladstone acting as escort to the Princess of Wales. An interesting\r\nincident occurred on the lawn. The Princess took great interest in\r\ninspecting the favorite dogs of the Gladstone family. These were the\r\nblack Pomeranians. Two puppies were carried in a basket, one of which\r\nthe Princess accepted as a gift.\r\n\r\nJune 22, 1897, was celebrated with great pomp and rejoicing the Diamond\r\nJubilee of Victoria, the Queen of England and Empress of India, when the\r\nQueen reached the 60th anniversary of her reign, which is the longest in\r\nEnglish history. Victoria became queen at the age of 19 years, in 1837,\r\nand then the British Isles possessed a population of 26,000,000 and they\r\nhad became 40,000,000. Her Empire has been extended until in India,\r\nSouth, Central and Western Africa, Australia, New Zealand and North\r\nAmerica, and including the British Isles, there were 360,000,000 people\r\nwho owned her sway. And to this greatness and glory Mr. Gladstone had\r\nbeen one to contribute largely, while his influence has been felt more\r\nstill by far in promoting the moral greatness of the people. Throughout\r\nall the Empire the event was celebrated, and the jubilee procession in\r\nLondon was swollen by representatives of all parts of the Queen's domain\r\nand all nations on earth which rendered it the greatest pageant ever\r\nbeheld. Even the Turk was there, but Mr. Gladstone was not there, nor\r\nwas his name even mentioned for a place in the march on jubilee day. Yet\r\nthe period of Victoria's reign will often be spoken of in history as the\r\nGladstonian Era.\r\n\r\n\"The public life of a leading statesman,\" says an eminent writer,\r\n\"offers the boldest and stateliest outline to the public view. It may be\r\nthat the most striking and memorable chapters in a future biography of\r\nMr. Gladstone will contain the story of his private affairs and domestic\r\nlife.\" His daily life at home was a model of simplicity and regularity,\r\nand the great secret of the vast amount of work he accomplished was\r\nowing to the fact that every odd five minutes were occupied. He had a\r\ndeep sense of the preciousness of time and the responsibility which\r\neveryone incurs who uses or misuses it. \"To such a length did he carry\r\nthis that at a picnic to a favorite Welsh mountain he has been seen to\r\nfling himself on the heather and bury himself in some pamphlet upon a\r\nquestion of the day, until called to lighter things by those who were\r\nresponsible for the provision basket.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was ever a most severe economist of time, a habit acquired\r\nas long ago as 1839, when he awed his young wife by filling up all odd\r\nbits and scraps of time with study or work. Out of his pocket would come\r\nthe little classic at every chance opportunity of leisure. This accounts\r\nfor his ability to get through in one day more than most people do in a\r\nweek. Then besides, he had the faculty of concentrating the whole power\r\nof his mind upon the one thing before him, whether small or great. He\r\nwas unable to divide the machinery of his mind. Interruption was almost\r\nfatal to his train of thought, but he was generally oblivious to\r\nconversation buzzing around him. Hence it was some time before a\r\nquestioner could get an answer--he did not seem to hear, but patience\r\nfinally secured attention, after the train of absorbing thought\r\nwas finished.\r\n\r\nIt was this power of concentrating all his faculties upon what he was\r\ndoing, whether it was work or play, that made Mr. Gladstone one of the\r\nablest as well as happiest of the century. He took the keenest delight\r\nin the scholarly and beautiful, and this accounts for his disregard of\r\nminor ills and evils. He was too absorbed to be fretful or impatient.\r\nBut to be absorbed in great things did not mean, in his case, to be\r\nneglectful of little things. At one time his mind and time were so\r\ncompletely taken up with the Eastern question, that he could not be\r\ninduced to spare a thought for Ireland, and afterward it was quite as\r\ndifficult to get him to think of any political question except that\r\nof Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the daily routine of private life none in the household were more\r\npunctual and regular than Mr. Gladstone. At 8 o'clock he was up and in\r\nhis study. From 1842 he always found time, with all his manifold duties,\r\nto go to church regularly, rain or shine, every morning except when ill,\r\nat half-past 8 o'clock, He walked along the public road from the castle\r\nto Hawarden church. Writes an observer: \"The old statesman, with his\r\nfine, hale, gentle face, is an interesting figure as he walks lightly\r\nand briskly along the country road, silently acknowledging the fervent\r\nsalutations of his friends--the Hawarden villagers. He wears a long\r\ncoat, well buttoned up, a long shawl wrapped closely around his neck,\r\nand a soft felt hat--a very different figure from that of the Prime\r\nMinister as he is known in London.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Castle prayers were read to the family and household soon after 9\r\no'clock daily. His customary breakfast was comprised of a hard-boiled\r\negg, a slice of tongue, dry toast and tea. The whole morning whether at\r\nhome or on a visit was devoted to business. Luncheon at Hawarden was\r\nwithout formality. \"Lunch was on the hob,\" for several hours, to be\r\npartaken of when it suited the convenience of the various members of the\r\nfamily. Tea, of which Mr. Gladstone was particularly fond, and of which\r\nhe could partake at any hour of the day, or night, was served in the\r\nafternoon at 5 o'clock,--after which he finished his correspondence.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, Mr. Gladstone was accustomed to a walk in the grounds,\r\naccompanied by his faithful little black Pomeranian dog, Petz, who was\r\nobtained on a trip abroad, and became and remained for many years, an\r\nimportant member of the household, and one of Mr. Gladstone's most\r\ndevoted followers. Increasing years of over fourscore, prevented finally\r\nwalks of fifty miles a day once indulged in, and the axes stood unused\r\nin their stands in the vestibule and library, but still Mr. Gladstone\r\nkept up his walks with his silent companion Petz. After walking for half\r\nan hour longer in his library after his return to the Castle, Mr.\r\nGladstone would dress for dinner, which operation usually took him from\r\nthree to five minutes. At 8 o'clock he joined the family, at dinner,\r\nwhich was a cheerful meal. Like Goethe he ate heartily and enjoyed his\r\nmeals, but his diet was extremely simple, Mr. Gladstone eating only what\r\nwas prescribed by his physician. At dinner he talked freely and\r\nbrilliantly even when none but his family were present. When visitors\r\nwere present he would enter upon whatever was the subject of\r\nconversation, taking his share with others, and pouring a flood of light\r\nupon any theme suggested, giving all the benefit of the fund of wisdom\r\nand anecdote collected through two generations of unparalleled political\r\nand social activity.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, when there were no visitors at Hawarden, Mr. Gladstone\r\nwould quietly sit reading in his library, or conversing with his family.\r\nHe never used tobacco. Shortly after 10 o'clock he retired to bed and to\r\nsleep. He never allowed himself to think and be sleepless. Mr. Bright\r\nhad a habit of making his speeches after he had retired to bed, which\r\nMr. Gladstone thought was detrimental to his health. Bight hours was the\r\ntime Mr. Gladstone permitted himself to sleep. His bed-room was on the\r\nsecond floor and reached by a fine staircase. Everything in the room was\r\nplain and homely.\r\n\r\nOn the walls of his bed-room and over the mantlepiece was a text\r\nemblazoned, on which at evening and morning he could look, which read:\r\n\"Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee.\"\r\nThis not only expresses Mr. Gladstone's trust in God, but doubtless\r\naccounts in a large degree for that tranquility of mind so notably his,\r\neven in those trying times that prostrated many and carried many more\r\naway from their bearings.\r\n\r\nFrom the worry or weariness of business, Mr. Gladstone was ever ready to\r\nturn for rest to reading, which has thus proved of inestimable value to\r\nhim. \"His family cannot speak without emotion of that look of perfect\r\nhappiness and peace that beamed from his eye on such occasions.\" When\r\nduring the general elections of 1882, this was denied him, he turned\r\nwith equal readiness to writing and thinking on other subjects. During\r\nthe Midlothian Campaign and General Election, and through the Cabinet\r\nmaking that followed, he relieved the pressure on his over-burdened\r\nbrain by writing an article on Home Rule, \"written with all the force\r\nand freshness of a first shock of discovery;\" he was also writing daily\r\non the Psalms; he was preparing a paper for the Oriental Congress which\r\nwas to startle the educated world by \"its originality and ingenuity;\"\r\nand he was composing with great and careful investigation his Oxford\r\nlecture on \"The rise and progress of learning in the University\r\nof Oxford.\"\r\n\r\nAll during the morning hours he would sit in the silence of that\r\ncorner-room on the ground floor reading. There were three writing-desks\r\nin the library, and one was chiefly reserved for correspondence of a\r\npolitical nature, and another for his literary work, while the third was\r\nused by Mrs. Gladstone. He spent his evenings when at Hawarden in a cosy\r\ncorner of the library reading. He had a wonderfully constructed lamp so\r\narranged for him for night reading, as to throw the utmost possible\r\nlight on the pages of the book. It was generally a novel that employed\r\nhis mind at night. Occasionally he gives Mrs. Drew about two hundred\r\nnovels to divide the sheep from the goats among them. She divides them\r\ninto three classes--novels worth keeping, novels to be given away, and\r\nnovels to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone generally had three books in course of reading at the same\r\ntime, changing from one to the other. These books were carefully\r\nselected with reference to their character and contents, and he was\r\nparticular as to their order and variation. For instance at one time he\r\nwas reading Dr. Laugen's Roman History, in German, in the morning,\r\nVirgil in the afternoon, and a novel at night. Scott was his preference\r\namong novelists. He read with pencil in hand, and he had an elaborate\r\nsystem of marking a book. Aristotle, St. Augustine, Dante and Bishop\r\nButler were the authors who had the deepest influence upon him, so he\r\nhimself said. His copy of the Odyssey of Homer he had rebound several\r\ntimes, as he preferred always to use the same copy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Drew says of her father: \"There could not be a better illustration\r\nof his mind than his Temple of Peace--his study, with its\r\nextraordinarily methodical arrangement. Away from home he will write an\r\nexact description of the key or paper he requires, as: 'Open the left\r\nhand drawer of the writing table nearest the fireplace, and at the back\r\nof the drawer, in the right hand corner, you will find some keys. You\r\nwill see three on one string; send me the one with such and such teeth.'\r\nHis mind is arranged in the same way; he has only to open a particular\r\ncompartment, labelled so and so, to find the information he requires.\r\nHis memory in consequence is almost unfailing. It is commonly found that\r\nin old age the memory may be perfect as regards times long gone by, but\r\ninaccurate and defective as to more recent events. But with Mr.\r\nGladstone the things of the present are as deeply stamped on his brain\r\nas the things of the past.\" Some one has said of Mr. Gladstone that his\r\nmemory was \"terrible.\" It is evident that he always kept abreast of the\r\ntimes--informing himself of everything new in literature, science and\r\nart, and when over eighty years of age was as ready to imbibe fresh\r\nideas as when he was only eighteen, and far more discriminating.\r\n\r\nThose who entered Mr. Gladstone's official room on a Sunday, during the\r\nbusiest parliamentary session, could not fail to be struck by the\r\natmosphere of repose, the signs and symbols of the day, the books lying\r\nopen near the armchair, the deserted writing-table, the absence of\r\npapers and newspapers. On Sunday Mr. Gladstone put away all business of\r\na secular nature, occupied his time in reading special books, suitable\r\nto the day, and generally attended church twice, never dined out, except\r\nhe went on a mission of mercy, or to cheer some sorrowful friend. When\r\nthe Queen invited him to Windsor Castle on Sunday for one night, as she\r\ndid sometimes, he always arranged to stay in Windsor Saturday. In his\r\ndressing room he kept a large open bible in which he daily read.\r\nPhysically, intellectually and spiritually Mr. Gladstone's Sundays were\r\nregarded by his family as a priceless blessing to him, and to have made\r\nhim the man he was. Mr. Gladstone had strict notions of his duty to his\r\nchurch. Whenever he established himself in London, he always attended\r\nthe nearest church, and became regular in his attendance, not only on\r\nthe Sabbath, but daily. With an empire on his shoulders he found time\r\nfor daily public devotion, and in church-going he was no \"gadabout.\"\r\nWhen he resided at Carlton House Terrace he attended the church of St.\r\nMartin-in-the-Fields.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's daily correspondence, when Prime Minister, was simply\r\nenormous. At first he felt it to be a conscientious duty to deal with\r\nthe most of it himself, but finally came to trust the bulk of it to\r\nsecretaries as other ministers did. Some letters came to him daily that\r\nhe had to answer with his own hand; for example, from ministers or on\r\nconfidental business, from the court, At the end of every Cabinet\r\nCouncil the Premier has to write a letter with his own hand to his\r\nsovereign, giving full information of the business transacted. The same\r\nkind of report is required daily from Parliament. Of course Mr.\r\nGladstone, whenever he was Prime Minister, faithfully attended to this\r\nduty and dispatched the required letters written with his own hand to\r\nthe Queen.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was remarkable for the strength and endurance of his body\r\nas well as for the vigor of his intellect. \"Don't talk to me of Mr.\r\nGladstone's mind,\" said a contemporary; \"it is his body which astonishes\r\nme.\" He never had any serious illness in his life, and up to quite\r\nrecent years were vigorous exercise, sometimes walking when in Scotland\r\n20 miles at a stretch over rough and mountainous country. The physical\r\neffort of speaking to twenty thousand people, and being heard in every\r\npart of the vast building by the audience, as was the case at\r\nBirmingham, in 1889, was remarkable. His power of endurance was\r\nwonderful. In 1882, he once sat up through an all-night sitting of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and going back to 10 Downing Street, at 8 o'clock in\r\nthe morning, for half an hour's rest, again returned to the House and\r\nremained until the conclusion of the setting. Tree-cutting, which was\r\nwith him a frequent recreation until he became a very old man, was\r\nchosen \"as giving him the maximum of healthy exercise in the minimum of\r\ntime.\" This favorite pastime of the great statesman was so closely\r\nassociated with him that it was deemed the proper thing to do to place\r\non exhibition in the Great Columbian Exposition at Chicago one of the\r\naxes of Mr. Gladstone.\r\n\r\nThe Psalmist says, \"A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes\r\nupon the thick trees.\" These singular words were written long before\r\nMr. Gladstone's day, but famous as he was for felling the great trees of\r\nthe forest, the words have a deeper meaning and in more than one sense\r\nmet their fulfilment in him. His swift and keen axe of reform brought\r\ndown many hoary headed evils. Mr. Gladstone himself explained why he\r\ncultivated this habit of cutting down trees. He said: \"I chop wood\r\nbecause I find that it is the only occupation in the world that drives\r\nall thought from my mind. When I walk or ride or play cricket, I am\r\nstill debating important business problems, but when I chop wood I can\r\nthink of nothing but making the chips fly.\"\r\n\r\nThe following story illustrates Mr. Gladstone's remarkable powers and\r\nthe surprise he would spring upon those who met him. Two gentlemen who\r\nwere invited guests at a table where Mr. Gladstone was expected, made a\r\nwager that they would start a conversation on a subject about which even\r\nMr. Gladstone would know nothing. To accomplish this end they \"read up\"\r\nan \"ancient\" magazine article on some unfamiliar subject connected with\r\nChinese manufactures. When the favorable opportunity came the topic was\r\nstarted, and the two conspirators watched with amusement the growing\r\ninterest in the subject which Mr. Gladstone's face betrayed. Finally he\r\njoined in the conversation, and their amusement was turned into\r\nconfusion, when Mr. Gladstone said, \"Ah, gentlemen, I perceive you have\r\nbeen reading an article I wrote in the ---- Magazine some thirty or\r\nforty years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOSING SCENES OF A LONG AND EVENTFUL LIFE\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone died at Hawarden Castle, at 5 o'clock, Thursday Morning,\r\nMay 19, 1898.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation of the rapidly approaching end of Mr. Gladstone was\r\nconveyed in a bulletin issued at 9 o'clock Tuesday morning, May 17. It\r\nread \"Mr. Gladstone had a poor and broken sleep last night; he is\r\nsomewhat exhausted, but suffers no discomfort.\" The report of the\r\nevening before was assuring as to any sudden change, so that the anxiety\r\nwas increased. For hours no additional information was given, but there\r\nwere indications outside the Castle of a crisis. Throughout the day\r\ncould be heard expressions of deep regret among the working people,\r\nasking, \"How is the old gentleman?\" Despite the heavy rain the people\r\ncollected in groups, and the hush and quiet that prevailed indicated the\r\npresence of death.\r\n\r\nA bulletin at 5 p.m. said: \"Mr. Gladstone has taken a serious turn for\r\nthe worse. His death may be expected in twenty-four hours.\" All day the\r\ncondition of the patient had been critical. The doctor doubted that his\r\npatient was fully conscious at any time, he answered, \"Yes,\" and \"No.\"\r\nHe refused all medicine, exclaiming No! No! It was remarked that when\r\naddressed in English, Mr. Gladstone would answer in French, and\r\nsometimes was praying in French.\r\n\r\nLater in the evening the servants of the household were admitted to the\r\nsick room for a final farewell. They found Mr. Gladstone lying in a deep\r\nsleep; each in turn knelt down, kissed his hand and tearfully withdrew.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 o'clock the patient rallied a little and fell into a peaceful\r\nsleep, which was thought to be his last.\r\n\r\nThe rain had continued to fall during the night, but the villagers had\r\nbeen coming singly and in groups to glance silently at the rain-beaten\r\nscrap of paper which was the latest bulletin, and then silently\r\nreturning to the gate, and disappearing in the darkness only to\r\nreturn later.\r\n\r\nAbout 4 o'clock in the morning Mr. Gladstone seemed to be sinking. The\r\nscene in the sick-room was painful. The Rev. Stephen Gladstone read\r\nprayers and hymns, including Mr. Gladstone's favorite, \"Rock of Ages.\"\r\nWhen this was concluded, Mr. Gladstone murmured, \"Our Father.\" As Mrs.\r\nGladstone leaned over her husband, he turned his head and his lips moved\r\nslightly. Though extremely distressed, Mrs. Gladstone bore up with\r\nremarkable fortitude. But Mr. Gladstone rallied again, and Wednesday\r\nmorning he was still living. By his almost superhuman vitality he had\r\nfought death away.\r\n\r\nThe morning was beautiful and clear and the sunshine came in at the open\r\nwindow of Mr. Gladstone's room. The aged sufferer was hovering between\r\nlife and death, and only by the feeble beating of his pulse could it be\r\ntold he was alive. He was sleeping himself away into eternal day. Mrs.\r\nGladstone sat by the side of his bed, holding his hand, and never\r\nleaving except for needed rest. At times he seemed to recognize for a\r\nmoment some of those with him. He surely knew his wife as she tenderly\r\nkissed his hand.\r\n\r\nIt soon became known abroad that Mr. Gladstone was dying. In the House\r\nof Commons it caused profound sorrow. Everything else was stopped while\r\nmembers discussed how best to honor him, even by taking steps without,\r\nprecedent as that of adjourning, because the circumstances were\r\nunprecedented. His former colleagues silently watched his last struggle\r\nwith the relentless foe, to whom, true to himself, he was yielding\r\nslowly, inch by inch.\r\n\r\nTelegrams of inquiry and sympathy came from all parts of the world to\r\nthe Castle. The Queen wrote making inquiries and tendering assurances of\r\nprofound sympathy. A long telegram from the Princess of Wales concluded:\r\n\"I am praying for you.\" The Prince of Wales wrote: \"My thoughts are with\r\nyou at this trying time., God grant that your father does not suffer.\"\r\nThe Duke of Devonshire before the British Empire League referred\r\ntouchingly to the mournful scenes at Hawarden, when \"the greatest of\r\nEnglishmen was slowly passing away.\" And all over the land people of all\r\nconditions and at all kinds of gatherings, politicians, divines,\r\nreformers, and women joined in expressions of grief and sympathy. Many\r\nwere the messages of regard and condolence that came from other lands.\r\n\r\nDr. Dobie furnishes the following picture of the dying man. \"His grand\r\nface bears a most peaceful and beautiful look. A few days ago the deeply\r\nbitten wrinkles that so long marked it were almost gone; but now,\r\nstrangely enough, they seem strong and deep as ever. He looks too in\r\nwonderfully good color.\"\r\n\r\nAt 2 o'clock in the morning, it was evident that the time had come, and\r\nthe family gathered about the bed of the aged man, from that time none\r\nof them left the room until all was over. The only absentee was little\r\nDorothy Drew, who tearfully complained that her grandfather did not know\r\nher. Behind the family circle stood the physicians and the nurses, and\r\nthe old coachman, who had been unable to be present when the other\r\nservants took their farewell, and who was now sent for to witness the\r\nclosing scene.\r\n\r\nThe end was most peaceful. There were no signs of bodily pain or of\r\nmental distress. The Rev. Stephen Gladstone read prayers and repeated\r\nhymns. The nurse continued to bathe with spirits the brow of the\r\npatient, who showed gratitude by murmuring, \"How nice!\" While the son\r\nwas engaged in praying, came the gentle, almost perceptible cessation of\r\nlife, and the great man was no more. So quietly had he breathed his\r\nlast, that the family did not know it until it was announced by the\r\nmedical attendants. The weeping family then filed slowly from the room,\r\nMrs. Gladstone was led into another room and induced to lie down. The\r\nonly spoken evidence that Mr. Gladstone realized his surroundings in his\r\nlast moments was when his son recited the litany. Then the dying man\r\nmurmured, \"Amen.\" This was the last word spoken by Mr. Gladstone and was\r\nuttered just before he died.\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr. Gladstone was announced to the people of Hawarden by\r\nthe tolling of the church bell. The following bulletin was posted at 6\r\na.m.: \"In the natural course of things the funeral will be at Hawarden.\r\nMr. Gladstone expressed a strong wish to have no flowers at his funeral;\r\nand the family will be grateful if this desire is strictly respected.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something indescribably pathetic in the daily bulletins about\r\nMr. Gladstone. All the world knew that he was afflicted with a fatal but\r\nslow disease, and all the world was struck with wondering admiration at\r\nhis sustained fortitude, patience, and resignation. The tragedy of a\r\nlife, devoted simply and purely to the public service, drawing to an end\r\nin so long an agony, was a spectacle that struck home to the heart of\r\nthe most callous. These bulletins were posted on the front door of the\r\nJubilee Porch, at Hawarden Castle, at 9 a.m., 5 p.m. and 10 o'clock at\r\nnight daily, and published throughout the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the sad event was announced that Mr. Gladstone had passed away, the\r\naction of the House of Commons was prompt, decided and sympathetic. The\r\nHouse was crowded Thursday, May 19, when Speaker Gully called upon the\r\ngovernment leader, Mr. A. J. Balfour, the First Lord of the Treasury,\r\nand all the members uncovering their heads, Mr. Balfour said:\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be felt in all parts of the House that we should do\r\nfitting honor to the great man whose long and splendid career closed\r\nto-day, by adjourning.\r\n\r\n\"This is not the occasion for uttering the thoughts which naturally\r\nsuggest themselves. That occasion will present itself to-morrow, when it\r\nwill be my duty to submit to the House an address to the Queen, praying\r\nher to grant the honor of a public funeral, if such honor is not\r\ninconsistent with the expressed wishes of himself or of those who have\r\nthe right to speak in his behalf, and also praying the Queen to direct\r\nthat a public monument be erected at Westminster with an inscription\r\nexpressive of the public admiration, attachment and high estimate\r\nentertained by the House of Mr. Gladstone's rare and splendid gifts and\r\ndevoted labors in Parliament and in high offices of State.\r\n\r\n\"Before actually moving the adjournment, I have to propose a formal\r\nresolution that the House to-morrow resolve itself into committee to\r\ndraw up an address, the contents of which I have just indicated.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a word of assent from Sir William Vernon-Harcourt, the Liberal\r\nleader, the resolution was adopted and the House adjourned.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons was crowded again on Friday, and went into\r\ncommittee of the whole to consider the address to the Queen in regard\r\nto the interment of the remains of Mr. Gladstone in Westminster Abbey.\r\nNot since the introduction of the Home Rule Bill by Mr. Gladstone had\r\nthere been such an assemblage in the House, members filled every seat,\r\nclustered on the steps of the speaker's dais, and occupied every space.\r\nThe galleries were all filled. In the Peer's gallery were the foremost\r\nmembers of the House of Lords. United States Ambassador Hay and all his\r\nstaff were present with other Ambassadors. The members of the House were\r\nin deep mourning, and all removed their hats, as if in the presence of\r\nthe dead. An unusual hush overspread all. After the prayer by the\r\nchaplain, there was an impressive silence for a quarter of an hour,\r\nbefore Mr. Balfour rose to speak. The whole scene was profoundly\r\naffecting. The eulogies of Mr. Gladstone formed an historic episode.\r\nAll, without respect to party, united in honoring their late illustrious\r\ncountryman.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour delivered a brilliant panegyric of the dead statesman, and\r\nhis speech was eloquent and displayed great taste. He was so ill,\r\nhowever, from weakness of heart that he was barely able to totter to his\r\nplace and to ask the indulgence of the speaker while he rested, before\r\noffering his oration. He was too sick for the sad duty imposed upon him,\r\nbut he preferred to pay this last tribute to his friend. The\r\ncircumstances were painful, but added a dramatic touch to the scene.\r\nHis oration was lengthy and his eulogy spoken with evident emotion. He\r\nconcluded by formally moving the presentation of the address to the\r\nQueen. The Liberal Leader, Sir William Vernon-Harcourt, the political as\r\nwell as the personal friend of Mr. Gladstone, seconded the motion. He\r\npaid a heartfelt tribute to the memory of his eminent colleague, and\r\nspoke in a vein of lofty and glowing eloquence until overcome with\r\nemotion, so that he had to stop thrice to wipe his eyes; finally he\r\ncompletely broke down and was unable to proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. Dillon, the Irish leader, in a speech of five minutes duration, and\r\nin his most oratorical style, dwelt on Mr. Gladstone's fervid sympathy\r\nfor the oppressed people of all races, and touched a chord which stirred\r\nthe House. As Mr. Dillon had spoken for Ireland, so Mr. Abel Thomas\r\nfollowed as the representative of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe address to the Queen was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the House of Lords there was also a full attendance of members. The\r\nMarquis of Salisbury, Prime Minister, spoke feelingly of Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwho, he said, \"was ever guided in all his efforts by a lofty moral\r\nidea\". The deceased will be remembered, not so much for his political\r\nwork as for the great example, hardly paralleled in history, of the\r\ngreat Christian Statesman.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Kimberly, the liberal leader in the House of Lords, followed\r\nin a touching tribute, and the Duke of Devonshire expressed generous\r\nappreciation of Mr. Gladstone's services in behalf of the Liberal\r\nUnionists, saying their severance from Mr. Gladstone was a most painful\r\nincident. But, he added, he could \"recall no word from Mr. Gladstone\r\nwhich added unnecessarily to the bitterness of the situation.\" The Earl\r\nof Rosebery delivered an eloquent panegyric. The honors of the occasion\r\nwere unanimously accorded to him, whose eulogy of his predecessor in the\r\nleadership of the liberal party was a masterpiece of its kind. He spoke\r\nof the triumphs of life rather than the sorrows of death. Death was not\r\nall sadness. His life was full---his memory remains. To all time he is\r\nan example for our race and mankind. He instanced as an illustration of\r\nthe fine courtesy always observed by Mr. Gladstone towards his political\r\nopponents, that the last letter he had written with his own hand was a\r\nprivate note to Lady Salisbury, several weeks since, congratulating her\r\nand her husband on their providential escape from a carriage accident at\r\nHatfield. Lord Salisbury was visibly touched by Lord Rosebery's\r\nreference to this circumstance.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords then adopted the Resolution to the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe body of Mr. Gladstone, un-coffined, was laid on a couch in the\r\nLibrary of the Castle--the room called the Temple of Peace. He was\r\ndressed in a suit of black cloth, over which were the scarlet robes of\r\nthe university, and by his side the cap was placed. His hands were\r\nfolded on his breast. He rested on a most beautiful white satin cloth,\r\nwith a rich border in Eastern embroidery. Above his head in letters of\r\ngold were the words sewn into the satin: \"Requiescat in pace.\" There was\r\nthe beauty of death--the terror was all gone. During Tuesday the body\r\nwas viewed by the tenants on the estate, the neighbors and friends.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, May 25th, at 6 o'clock, the remains, having been\r\nenclosed in a plain panelled elm coffin, were removed to the village\r\nchurch, where they were lying in state during the day. The body was\r\ncarried by half-a-dozen old retainers of the family to a bier on wheels,\r\non which it was taken to the church, over the lawn, following the\r\nprivate path Mr. Gladstone used to tread on his way to church, and past\r\nthe favorite nooks of the deceased in the park. The family--excepting\r\nMrs. Gladstone, who came later, tenants, servants, friends, local\r\nofficials and neighbors followed in procession, Thousands of people were\r\narriving by public and private conveyances at Hawarden. At eleven\r\no'clock the doors of the church were opened, when men, women and\r\nchildren, from all the surrounding country, and even tourists from\r\nabroad, entered to view the remains. All day long a constant stream of\r\npeople poured into the church, while the streets were filled with people\r\nunable to gain admittance. Several ladies fainted from excess of emotion\r\nwhen passing the bier, and many men and women dropped on their knees and\r\nsilently prayed.\r\n\r\nAt 6 o'clock in the evening the body was removed from Hawarden Church\r\nand carried to the station for the journey to London. The procession to\r\nbear the remains was composed of the family, representatives of\r\norganizations, friends and neighbors. Vast crowds lined the route, afoot\r\nand in every kind of vehicle. The cortege stopped at the entrance to the\r\nPark--Hawarden Lodge, and sang one of Mr. Gladstone's favorite hymns.\r\nAgain, when the procession reached the Castle, it paused at the entrance\r\nand sang another hymn loved by the late resident of the house, and went\r\non its way to Broughton Hall Station. Every step of the way, after\r\nleaving the park, was again lined with sympathetic spectators. While at\r\nthe station the spectacle was remarkable for the surrounding crush of\r\nhuman beings. A special train was provided for the body and the family.\r\nAs the body of Mr. Gladstone was placed upon the funeral car the sorrow\r\nof the people was manifest. The representatives of the Earl Marshall, of\r\nEngland, took possession of the funeral at this point. Henry and Herbert\r\nGladstone accompanied the body to London and Mrs. Gladstone and family\r\nreturned to the castle to follow later.\r\n\r\nAll along the route to London grief-stricken people were standing to\r\nview the funeral train as it passed at Chester, Crewe, Rugby, Stafford\r\nand Farnworth until the darkness and lateness of the night shut out\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the train reached London and passed to Westminster, it was early in\r\nthe morning. A group of some thirty gentlemen, connected with the\r\nceremonies, was at the station; among them the Duke of Norfolk, About\r\ntwo hundred people looked silently on while the body was removed from\r\nthe train to the hearse, and the funeral cortege moved on to Westminster\r\nHall at once and entered the Palace Yard just as \"Big Ben\" tolled the\r\nhour of one like a funeral knell.\r\n\r\nThe coffin was placed in position for lying in state in Westminster\r\nHall, and at about 3 o'clock Canon Wilberforce conducted a special\r\nservice in the presence of Henry and Herbert Gladstone and several\r\nmembers of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe scenes that followed were remarkably impressive and unparalleled.\r\nThe people began to arrive at Westminster at 2 o'clock in the morning.\r\nThe line formed was continually augmented by all classes of\r\npeople,--peers, peeresses, cabinet members, members of the House of\r\nCommons, military and naval officers, clergymen, costermongers, old and\r\nyoung, until 6 o'clock, when the doors were opened and the procession\r\ncommenced to stream into the Hall, and passed the catafalque.\r\n\r\nThis long procession of mourners continued all day Thursday and Friday.\r\nTwo hundred thousand people, at least, paid homage to the dead\r\nstatesman. On Friday evening, after the crowd had departed, large\r\ndelegations, representing Liberal organizations from all parts of the\r\nkingdom, visited the Hall, by special arrangement, and fifteen hundred\r\nof them paid respect to the memory of their late leader.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, May 28, thousands of people assembled in the square\r\noutside to witness the passage of the funeral cortege from Westminster\r\nHall, where it was formed, to the Abbey, to find sepulchre in the tomb\r\nof kings. The procession passed through two lines of policemen. It was\r\nnot a military parade, with all its pomp, but a ceremony made glorious\r\nby the homage of the people, among them the greatest of the nation. The\r\nfuneral was in every respect impressive, dignified and lofty, in every\r\nway worthy the great civilian, and the nation that accorded him a\r\npublic burial with its greatest dead. And the people were there. Every\r\nspot on which the eye rested swarmed with human beings. They looked from\r\nthe windows of the hospital, and from the roofs of houses. Everybody was\r\ndressed in black.\r\n\r\nThe principal officials had assembled in Westminster Hall at 10 o'clock.\r\nThe Bishop of London, the Right Rev. Mandell Creighton, D.D., read a\r\nbrief prayer and at 10.30 o'clock the procession had formed and slowly\r\npassed through the crowds who with uncovered heads stood on either side\r\nof short pathway, a distance 300 yards, to the western entrance of the\r\nAbbey, between two ranks of the Eton Volunteers, the boys of the school\r\nwhere Mr. Gladstone received his early education, in their\r\nbuff uniforms.\r\n\r\nThe pall-bearers who walked on each side of the coffin were perhaps the\r\npersonages who attracted the most attention during the day. They were\r\nthe Prince of Wales, the Duke of York, the Marquis of Salisbury, the\r\nEarl of Kimberly, A. J. Balfour, Sir William Vernon-Harcourt, the Duke\r\nof Rutland, Lord Rosebery, Baron Rendel and George Armitstead, the two\r\nlatter being life-long friends of the deceased statesman.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Gladstone entered the Abbey the whole assembly rose and\r\nremained standing until she was seated. This honor was accorded only\r\nonce beside--when the Princess of Wales, the Princess Mary and the\r\nDuchess of York appeared.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey was filled with people. Every gallery, balcony and niche high\r\nup among the rafters held a cluster of deeply interested spectators.\r\nTemporary galleries had been erected in long tiers around the open\r\ngrave, which was in the floor of the Abbey. There were 2,500 persons\r\nassembled in the Abbey, all--both men and women--clothed in black,\r\nexcept a few officials whose regalia relieved this sombre background by\r\nits brilliancy. The two Houses of Parliament sat facing each other,\r\nseated on temporary seats on opposite sides of the grave. About them\r\nwere the mayors of the principal cities, delegates from Liberal\r\norganizations, representatives of other civic and political societies,\r\nrepresentatives of the Non-Conformists, while the long nave was crowded\r\nwith thousands of men and women, among them being most of the\r\ncelebrities in all branches of English life. In each gallery was a\r\npresiding officer with his official mace beside him, whose place was in\r\nthe centre, and who was its most prominent figure. It was a\r\ndistinguished assembly in a famous place. Beneath were the illustrious\r\ndead; around were the illustrious living.\r\n\r\nThe members of the bereaved family sat in the stall nearest the\r\nbier--Mrs. Gladstone, her sons Henry, Herbert and Stephen; with other\r\nmembers of the family, children and grand-children, including little\r\nDorothy Drew, Mr. Gladstone's favorite grand-child, in her new mourning.\r\n\r\nThe Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York occupied the Dean's pew\r\nopposite. Other royalties were present in person or by their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nWithin the chancel stood the Dean of Westminster, and behind him were\r\ngathered the cathedral clergy, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the\r\nscarlet and white surpliced choir, filling the chapel.\r\n\r\nIt was the wish of the deceased for simplicity, but he was buried with a\r\nnation's homage in the tomb of kings. In the northern transept, known as\r\nthe \"Statesmen's Corner\", of Westminster Abbey, where England's greatest\r\ndead rests, the body of Mr. Gladstone was entombed. His grave is near\r\nthe graves of Pitt, Palmerston, Canning and Peel, beside that of his\r\nlife-long political adversary, Lord Beaconsfield (Benjamin Disraeli),\r\nwhose marble effigy looks down upon it, decked with the regalia Mr.\r\nGladstone had so often refused. Two possible future kings of Great\r\nBritain walked besides the great commoner's coffin and stood beside his\r\ngrave, and all the nobility and learning of the nation surrounded his\r\nbier. This state funeral, the first since that of Lord Palmerston, was\r\nrendered more imposing by the magnificence of the edifice in which it\r\nwas solemnized. The coffin rested on an elevated bier before the altar,\r\nits plainness hidden beneath a pall of white-and gold embroidered cloth.\r\n\r\nA choir of one hundred male singers, which had awaited the coffin at the\r\nentrance to the Abbey, preceded it along the nave, chanting, \"I am the\r\nResurrection and the Life.\" When the coffin was laid on the bier,\r\nPurcell's funeral chant, \"Lord, Thou Hast Been Our Refuge,\" was sung,\r\nand Dean Bradley and the whole assemblage sang, \"Rock of Ages,\" and then\r\nwhile the coffin was being borne along the aisle to the grave, sang Mr.\r\nGladstone's favorite hymn, \"Praise to the Holiest in the Height.\"\r\n\r\nThe choir of Westminster Abbey is said to be fine at any time, but for\r\nthis great occasion special arrangements had been made, and there was a\r\nrecruiting of the best voices from several of the choirs of London, and\r\nmany musical instruments beside. The result was to win general praise\r\nfor the beauty, harmony and perfection of the music. The weird, dismal\r\nstrains of a quartette of trombones, in a recess far above the heads of\r\nthe congregation, playing the three splendid \"Equali,\" Beethoven's\r\nfuneral hymn, swept through the vaulted roof of the Abbey, in pure tones\r\nnever to be forgotten. When these ceased and finally died away, the\r\ngreat organ and a band of brass instruments took up Schubert's funeral\r\nmarch, booming sonorously; and changed to Beethoven's funeral march with\r\na clash of cymbals in the orchestral accompaniment. A third march being\r\nrequired, owing to the time needed by the procession to reach the Abbey,\r\n\"Marche Solennelle\" was played.\r\n\r\nThe choir, and a large number of bishops and other clergy, joined the\r\nprocession at the west door and together they all proceeded to\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\nThere was no sermon. The service was simple and solemn. The final paean\r\nof victory over death and the grave from Paul's great epistle was read,\r\nand the last hymn sung was, \"Oh God! Our Help in Ages Past.\" The dean\r\nread the appointed appropriate service, committing the body to the\r\nearth, and then the Archbishop of Canterbury, in a loud voice,\r\npronounced the benediction. The family and others near the grave kneeled\r\nduring the concluding ceremonies, and then Mrs. Gladstone was helped\r\nfrom her knees to her unoccupied chair at the head of the grave.\r\n\r\nAfter the benediction came one of the saddest moments of the day. Mrs.\r\nGladstone stood, with great courage and composure, throughout the\r\nservice, supported on the arms of her two sons, Herbert and Stephen, and\r\nwith other members of her family near the grave. Her face was lifted\r\nupward, and her lips were moving as though repeating the lines of the\r\nservice. She also kept standing during the one official feature of the\r\nservice; \"The Proclamation by Garter, by Norroy, King of Arms, of the\r\nStyle of the Deceased,\" as the official programme had it, and in which\r\nthe various offices which Mr. Gladstone had held in his lifetime, were\r\nenumerated. Then, when the final word was spoken, the widow, still\r\nsupported by her sons, approached the edge of the grave and there took a\r\nlast, long look and was conducted away. Other relatives followed, and\r\nthen most of the members of Parliament. Finally the Prince of Wales, the\r\nDuke of York and other pall-bearers defiled past the grave, took a last\r\nview of the coffin in the deep grave, and when they had been escorted\r\ndown the nave to entrance, the people slowly departed.\r\n\r\nThe \"Dead March\" from \"Saul\" and the \"Marche Solennelle\" of Schubert\r\nwas played as the congregation slowly wended its way out of the\r\nsacred edifice.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most solemn function of all, witnessed by none but the\r\nGladstone family and the officials, was when the casket was opened\r\nshortly after midnight on Thursday to allow the Earl Marshal to verify\r\nwith his own eyes that it really contained the remains of the dead\r\nstatesman. It was said that the old man's face, seen for the last time\r\nby the Duke of Norfolk, who is responsible to England for his sacred\r\ncharge, was more peaceful and younger looking than it had seemed for\r\nyears. At the very last moment a small gold Armenian cross, a memento of\r\nthat nation for which the great statesman worked so zealously, was\r\nplaced by his side. Then all was sealed.\r\n\r\nAs the deceased statesman was undoubtedly the greatest parliamentarian\r\nof our time, the following concise expressions with regard to his\r\ncharacter and influence have been collected from a number of\r\nrepresentative members of different political parties in both Houses of\r\nParliament:\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Londonderry said: \"What impressed me about Mr. Gladstone\r\nwas his extraordinary moral influence.\"\r\n\r\nLord George Hamilton: \"I doubt whether we ever had a parliamentarian who\r\nequalled Mr. Gladstone.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Lorne: \"I share the universal regret at Mr. Gladstone's\r\ndeath as a personal loss.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Gorst: \"One feature, which greatly distinguished Mr. Gladstone,\r\nwas his remarkable candour in debate. He never affected to misunderstand\r\nhis opponents' arguments, and spared no pains in trying to make his own\r\nmeaning understood.\"\r\n\r\nSir Charles Dilke: \"I think Mr. Gladstone's leading personal\r\ncharacteristic was his old-fashioned courtesy. Whilst a statesman, his\r\nabsolute mastery of finance, both in its principles and details, was\r\nincomparably superior to that of any of his contemporaries.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Ellis, the chief Liberal Whip, confessed that the greatest\r\ninterest of his life in Parliament was to watch Mr. Gladstone's face.\r\n\"It was like the sea in the fascination of its infinite variety, and of\r\nits incalculable reserve and strength. Every motion in his great soul\r\nwas reflected in his face and form. To have had opportunities of\r\nwatching that face, and of witnessing one triumph after another, is a\r\nprecious privilege, for some of the charms of his face, as of his\r\noratory and character, were incommunicable. He more than any man helped\r\nto build up and shape the present commercial and political fabric of\r\nBritain, but to struggling nations his words and deeds were as the\r\nbreath of life.\"\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Pease: \"His memory will be kept green by a grateful country.\r\nDeath soon buries the battle-axe of party, and he who devoted a long\r\nlife and immense intellectual power, coupled with strong convictions on\r\nmoral and Christian ethics, to the well being of his country and the\r\nworld, will never be forgotten by the English people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. James Bryce, author of \"The American Commonwealth\": \"This sad event\r\nis the most noble and pathetic closing of a great life which we have\r\nseen in England in historical memory. I cannot recall any other case in\r\nwhich the whole nation has followed the setting of the sun of life with\r\nsuch sympathy, such regret, and such admiration.\"\r\n\r\nLord Kinnaird: \"Few men in public life have been able to draw out such\r\npersonal love and devotion from his followers and friends. In the midst\r\nof an ever-busy life he was always ready to take his part in the\r\nconflict of right against wrong, of truth against error, and he earned\r\nthe gratitude of all patriots, for he was never ashamed of contending\r\nthat no true progress could be made which left out of sight the moral\r\nwell-being of the people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Labouchere: \"What impressed me most in Mr. Gladstone was his power\r\nof concentrated effort. Once he had decided on a course, action at once\r\nfollowed. Every thought was bent to attain the end, no labour was deemed\r\nto arduous. He alone knew how to deal with supporters and opponents. The\r\nformer he inspired with his own fierce energy.\"\r\n\r\nMr. John Redmond, leader of the Parnellite group of the Irish\r\nNationalists: \"The loss to England is absolutely incalculable. I regard\r\nMr. Gladstone as having been the greatest parliamentarian of the age,\r\nand the greatest parliamentary orator. Englishmen of all parties ought\r\nto be grateful to him for his services in promoting the greatness and\r\nprosperity of their empire.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Dillon: \"The greatest and most patriotic of Englishmen. If I were\r\nasked to say what I think most characteristic of Gladstone, I should say\r\nhis abiding love for the common people and his faith in the government\r\nfounded upon them, so that, while he remained the most patriotic of\r\nEnglishmen, he is to-day mourned with equal intensity throughout the\r\ncivilized world.\"\r\n\r\nJustin McCarthy, M. P.: \"The death of Mr. Gladstone closes a career\r\nwhich may be described as absolutely unique in English political\r\nhistory. It was the career of a great statesman, whose statesmanship was\r\nfirst and last inspired, informed and guided by conscience, by\r\nprinciple, and by love of justice. There were great English statesmen\r\nbefore Mr. Gladstone's time and during Mr. Gladstone's time, but we\r\nshall look in vain for an example of any statesman in office, who made\r\ngenius and eloquence, as Mr. Gladstone did, the mere servants of\r\nrighteousness and conscientious purpose. Into the mind of Gladstone no\r\nthought of personal ambition or personal advancement ever entered. He\r\nwas as conscientious as Burke. In the brilliancy of his gifts he was at\r\nleast the equal of Bolingbroke. He was as great an orator as either\r\nPitt, and he has left the imprint of his intellect on beneficent\r\npolitical and social legislation. In eloquence he far surpassed Cobden\r\nand was the peer of Bright, while his position as Parliamentary leader\r\nenabled him to initiate and carry out measures of reform which Bright\r\nand Cobden could only support. He was, in short, the greatest and the\r\nbest Prime Minister known to English history.\"\r\n\r\nMichael Davitt: \"One can only join with the whole world in admiration of\r\nthe almost boundless talents of Mr. Gladstone, which were devoted with\r\nunparalleled power of charm to the service of his fellow-men. He was\r\nprobably the greatest British statesman and leaves behind a record of a\r\ncareer unequalled in the annals of English politics. For the magnitude\r\nof his national labors and integrity of his personal character, Irishmen\r\nwill remember him gratefully.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Chronicle_ heads its editorial with a quotation from\r\nWordsworth:\r\n\r\n     \"This is the happy warrior: this is he:\r\n     That every man in arms should wish to be.\"\r\n\r\nThe editorial says: \"A glorious light has been extinguished in the land;\r\nall his life lies in the past, a memory to us and our children; an\r\ninspiration and possession forever. The end has come as to a soldier at\r\nhis post. It found him calm, expectant, faithful, unshaken. Death has\r\ncome robed in the terrors of mortal pain; but what better can be said\r\nthan that as he taught his fellows how to live, so he has taught them\r\nhow to die?\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible at this hour to survey the mighty range of this\r\nsplendid life. We would assign to him the title. 'The Great Nationalist\r\nof the Nineteenth Century;' the greatest of the master-builders of\r\nmodern England. Timidity had no place in Mr. Gladstone's soul. Ho was a\r\nlion among men, endowed with a granite strength of will and purpose,\r\nrare indeed in our age of feeble convictions.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ says: \"One of his most characteristics qualities was\r\nhis personal humility. This cannot be explained without the key, for Mr.\r\nGladstone did not in the ordinary meaning of the word, underrate\r\nhimself. He was not easy to persuade. He paid little attention to other\r\npeople's opinions when his mind was made up. He was quite aware of his\r\nown ascendency in counsel and his supremacy in debate. The secret of his\r\nhumility was an abiding sense that these things were of no importance\r\ncompared with the relations between God's creatures and their Creator,\r\nMr. Gladstone once said with characteristic candour that he had a\r\nvulnerable temper. He was quickly moved to indignation by whatever he\r\nthought injurious either to himself or to others, and was incapable of\r\nconcealing his emotions, for, if he said nothing, his countenance showed\r\nwhat he felt. More expressive features were never given to man.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gladstone's exquisite courtesy, which in and out of Parliament was\r\nthe model for all, proceeded from the same source. It was essentially\r\nChristian. Moreover, nobody laughed more heartily over an anecdote that\r\nwas really good. He was many men in one; but he impressed all alike with\r\nthe essential greatness of his character.\r\n\r\n\"He was built mentally and morally on a large scale. Of course it cannot\r\nbe denied that such a face, such a voice, such natural dignity, and such\r\nperfect gesture produced in themselves an immense effect. There was\r\nnothing common-place about him. Mr. Gladstone was absolutely simple; and\r\nhis simplicity was not the least attractive element of his fascinating\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\n\"His life presented aspects of charm to all minds. His learning\r\ncaptivated the scholar, his eloquence and statesmanship the politician,\r\nhis financial genius the business man; while his domestic relations and\r\nsimple human graciousness appealed to all hearts.\r\n\r\n\"'There is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel.'\"\r\n\r\n_Public Ledger_, Philadelphia: \"To write Gladstone's career is to write\r\nthe history of the Victorian era and that of the closing years of the\r\nreign of William IV, for Gladstone took his seat in Parliament for the\r\nfirst time in 1832, two years after he was out of college, and\r\nVictoria's accession took place in 1837. Since that remote day Gladstone\r\nhas been four times Premier; has delivered numberless speeches of the\r\nhighest order of excellence; has published a multitude of pamphlets and\r\nvolumes which attest consummate intellectual gifts, and has been a great\r\nforce in English statesmanship and scholarship through an exceptionally\r\nlong life and almost to the very close of it. It has been given to\r\nexceedingly few men to play so great, so transcendent a role in any\r\ncountry or at any time.\"",
