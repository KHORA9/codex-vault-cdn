THE PURPOSE OF THE BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Nation is crowned when it exists in the world not only by virtue of a\r\ncontinuing national life, sustained by history and limited by natural\r\nfrontiers, but also by reason of a State in which its intuitions and\r\ndesires are expressed in a form as flexible as its containing life. The\r\nstubbornest national sense--and nowhere in the world has that sense\r\nproved more stubborn than in Ireland--can only be said to exist as\r\na protest, rather than as a power, until it can take to itself that\r\neventful crown. No other nation, or combination of nations, or empires\r\nor dominions, can give it that crown. It must beat it out of its own\r\nsense of wisdom and equity and beauty. It can only be responsible to\r\nits own soul and intellectual life for the manner of that crown, not\r\nonly because in no other sense can the word responsibility be said to\r\napply, but also because of a certain inevitable result. For when a\r\nNation does so crown itself the whole body of the Nation takes on a new\r\ndignity and grace. It is inevitable; the wearing of the crown compels\r\na new comportment. But if a crown wrought in some other workshop and\r\nmade according to some other nation’s desires be pressed upon its brow\r\nthe whole result must necessarily be ungainly and disfiguring. If there\r\nis no responsibility in the making there can be no responsibility in\r\nthe wearing, and there is no morality at the beginning or in the end.\r\nYet if a Nation can clothe itself in its own responsibility, and wear a\r\ncrown of its own devising, that Nation is no more only a Nation; it is\r\na Sovereign State.\r\n\r\nIreland is not a Sovereign State, but only a nation. Once she was\r\na Sovereign State, and the result was so comely and so full of\r\nresponsibility that when her sister states were ravaged by barbarian\r\ninroads from the north and east she went out among them and rebuilt\r\ntheir faith and culture. Nearly all modern European culture and\r\nlearning rest on what Ireland wrought during the sixth seventh and\r\neighth centuries, not on the earlier Roman and Greek cultures, for\r\nthe link with these things was only maintained through Ireland. It\r\nwas so maintained because Ireland was a Sovereign State, secure in\r\nits sovereignty. That sovereignty was suppressed, that statehood was\r\nbroken, because of the lust of imperial conquest fashioned out of\r\nmilitary strength and resting always on that strength. Piece by piece\r\nthat state was taken and hammered into dust, with a malignancy and\r\nhatred very hard to understand, until the people, driven forth into\r\nthe mountains and waste places of their own land, had no longer any\r\npart of their own State in which to house themselves, had to rely\r\non a continuing national sense, fed partly by faith, enriched by old\r\nmemories, burnt by a suffering hardly to be paralleled in history, but\r\nin itself something quite peculiar and indefinable.\r\n\r\nThe result was inevitable. Housed, on their own historic land, in\r\na State which was no State at all because it was not of their own\r\ndevising, the Irish people have repudiated all responsibility for it,\r\nhave misused and abused it, and have arisen in a continual series of\r\nrevolts against it. They were morally bound to do so, or become no\r\nmore a nation but a slave race. Continuing a Nation they were bound to\r\nassert their protest; and they have habitually done so very remarkably\r\nby the assertion of the laws, meanings and implications of their old\r\nState, destroyed centuries ago, as against the forms, meanings and\r\nimplications of a system of government utterly alien to them. There are\r\nfew things in history more remarkable or arresting than this challenge\r\nof an alien government with the laws and procedures of a State that\r\ncenturies before had been hewn asunder, had been trampled under foot,\r\nbut had continued in the instincts and intuitions of the Nation--the\r\ninstincts and intuitions that in the first instance, at the dawn of\r\nhistory, had built that State.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of affairs, continued long enough, was bound to claim\r\nthe attention of the world. It has succeeded in doing so; and the\r\nimmediate result has been that all has become bustle and hurry to\r\nmend the calamitous condition of Ireland. Men with anxious brows and\r\ncareworn faces have begun to emit constitutions for Ireland at the pace\r\nof about one a week--with a facility hardly to be rivalled by the Abbé\r\nSiéyès of old in his most fecund hour. Dusty tomes are turned down\r\nfrom the top shelf, and every form of constitution and government is\r\nstudied in order that it may contribute some new beauty to the destined\r\nscheme. Canada, Australia and South Africa have been laid under special\r\ncontribution, because these are held to be adornments of the English\r\nEmpire. The words Home Rule, Colonial Home Rule and Dominion Rule buzz\r\nabout the air like flies of a summer’s day, and nobody seems to be very\r\nclear as to what they exactly mean, except that there is a deep-seated\r\nsuspicion that they are not being used very honestly. The air is racked\r\nwith precedents from China to Peru; and amid it all, with a patience\r\nborn of centuries, stands the Nation for whom all this pother is\r\nsupposed to be raised.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing about it is that all this bustle and stir should so\r\npersistently neglect what is just the cause of the whole trouble. That\r\ncause is not economic; it is not, in the modern abuse of the word,\r\npolitical; it is historic. The economic and political troubles are\r\nincidental to the historical. The constitutions of English colonies\r\nsuch as Canada, Australia and South Africa may be good, bad or\r\nindifferent, wise or unwise, discreet or indiscreet; but they are as\r\nlittle applicable to the case of Ireland, and would eventually cause\r\nas much irritation, as Dublin Castle. They were created (generally\r\nas the result of menace) by Englishmen who went abroad as colonists,\r\nsinging sweet hymns about the White Man’s Burden and the Lord’s\r\nAnointed. Earlier colonists in those lands, however, such as the French\r\nin Canada and the Dutch in South Africa, give these constitutions no\r\nfealty because they do not answer their instincts. For the same reason\r\nIrishmen in these places, though less solid and unified from the nature\r\nof their case, generally become subversive and revolutionary units,\r\nintroducing and desiring changes such as the constitutions never\r\ncontemplated. When these changes are examined they are generally found\r\nto hark back to the laws and meanings of the old State of Ireland. But\r\nin Ireland itself the Nation, reduced though it be in population, and\r\nby oppression made unsure of itself, is entire and compact; racially\r\nmore compact than any nation in Europe, with little of the colonial\r\nelement remaining in it; and it draws almost wholly on its historic\r\npast. And from that past the answer must be found for its future, for\r\nthe past has stored up instincts and intuitions, old memories of the\r\nblood and desires of the national mind, that are waiting to burst into\r\nthe future. The answer therefore is not to be found in a study of the\r\nconstitutions of other peoples, but in a wise study of Irish history.\r\n\r\nThere is, outside of books, no such thing as Utopia. There is no such\r\nthing as a State abstractly good or bad in itself. A State is only\r\ngood or bad in the degree in which it answers, or fails to answer, the\r\nneeds of the Nation for which it is devised. All the rest is words.\r\nSimilarly there is no such thing as ancient history--except in the case\r\nof nations, such as Assyria, that have ceased to exist. All history\r\nis new and living, because in it are to be discovered the urge and\r\nimpulse of national minds. Particularly is this so with Ireland, where\r\nthe right national development was suppressed by an alien military\r\nconquest. The nineteenth century, for instance, was full of unrest,\r\nof demands, of swift instinctive actions, that can only be understood\r\nby turning back three hundred years of history. It is true that these\r\nnational intuitions have been frustrated so long that they are no\r\nlonger sure of themselves. It is true that, the development having been\r\nhindered for so long, it is difficult to gauge what these intuitions\r\nwould mean in the light of wholly changed conditions. Yet, in spite of\r\nall this, the principle remains sound, that it is only by searching\r\ninto a nation’s mind that its desires and impulses can be discovered,\r\nand it is only by watching those desires and impulses when they were\r\nfree to exercise themselves creatively that a State can be guessed-at\r\nthat shall be that Nation’s crown.\r\n\r\nIt is this search that I purpose in this little Essay. I am aware\r\nof the adventurous nature of the task--an adventure rendered doubly\r\ndifficult by the confined space of the Essay and by the fact that it\r\nbreaks new ground--but it is necessary that someone should undertake\r\nit, however ill-equipped he be for the task. It has necessarily to be\r\ncompounded of research, criticism and speculation, each being based\r\nupon the other in the order stated. It is always desirable that history\r\n(especially Irish history, where the lying and depreciative tongue is\r\nnot unknown) should be fully documented; but the slender limits of this\r\nEssay prohibit this. I make no statement, however, for which I have\r\nnot chapter and verse before me. I have tried to make the criticism\r\nas direct and obvious as possible; but it is of course unavoidable,\r\neven if it be desirable, that a man’s predilections should influence\r\nthe nature of his criticism. And as the speculation is based upon the\r\ncriticism it is equally unavoidable that the speculation should also\r\nexpress the personal desire--though it does so happen that this is not\r\nalways the case. All constitution-building is speculation; but if that\r\nspeculation is based on history, and a just and critical search into\r\nthat history with a view to discovering what are its permanent and\r\nwhat its impermanent, what its fundamental and what its incidental,\r\nelements, then it will be a national uplifting and not an irritation, a\r\nnational hope and not an embarrassment and frustration. It is the hope\r\nof this book to promote thought along these lines; and if it achieve\r\nthis it will have succeeded, even if it be finally cast aside by both\r\nwriter and reader. For certainly time so spent will be more profitably\r\nspent than in the study of constitutions of alien peoples across the\r\nseas, or by any sort of constitution-mongering that gives no heed to\r\nthe impulses of an old and historic Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE MAKINGS OF A POLITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe myth of Invasions, elaborated from the seventh century onwards,\r\nshrouds the earliest Irish history from our view. Something authentic,\r\naged and significant passes behind that screen, but we cannot clearly\r\nsee what it is. Irish history only begins to emerge from that screen,\r\nand to pass into the clearer light of knowledge, with the opening\r\ncenturies of our era. We then begin to get parts of information that\r\ncan more and more be checked with one another and with other known\r\nfacts, so building up a history that can be submitted to criticism; and\r\nit is interesting to notice that the emergence into greater certitude\r\noccurs at the very moment when the national life begins to be framed\r\ninto a distinct and recognisable polity, ever tending towards a central\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThe process begins with or about Tuathal Teachtmhair, Tuathal the\r\nArriver, about the middle of the second century. With him there\r\nis still much twilight, but with him the daylight quickens. The\r\nmain outlines of his life and work, even of his personality, can\r\nbe checked with one another and take their place in a logical and\r\nreliable whole. With him the makings of the new State begin; and\r\nthey continue, in spite of periods of disrepair, until at the end of\r\nthe first millenium the State was knit together by a fiscal system\r\nthat was put to writing. The work has much of the simplicity due to\r\nthe simpler conditions of the time, although in fact the result was\r\nhighly complex and elaborate; but, almost alone among the nations or\r\npeoples of Europe, in Ireland the work of constructive State-building\r\nwent forward. Strife abounded (and modern times have lost what little\r\nright they ever had to point an accusing finger at it); it abounded\r\nthroughout Europe, and Ireland had its share; but in Ireland the State\r\nalways held the national sense together, and it was always being\r\nrevised to meet new needs. It is interesting briefly to survey the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nTuathal came at a strategic moment. The Ulster Cycle shows quite\r\nclearly a struggle between Connacht and Uladh for the hegemony of the\r\nfive provinces of Ireland. The earlier parts of that cycle (though\r\nwritten to exploit Uladh) show that hegemony claimed and won by\r\nConnacht; the later parts show it passing to Uladh. Then there is a\r\ndark period, in which we have no literature to guide us and for which\r\nthe records in the Annals of Tigernach give little help. During this\r\ntime occurs the mysterious episode known as the Revolt of the Vassals.\r\nWhatever that episode meant, it appears that Tuathal’s mother had to\r\nfly the country. He himself returned later to his province of Connacht\r\nto resume the dynastic struggle with the kings of Uladh for the rule of\r\nIreland. Probably Tuathal was the Irish prince to whom Tacitus refers\r\nas being for a time with the Roman legions in Britain. The dates are\r\napproximate; and Tuathal’s first act on his return to Ireland suggests\r\nthat he had not misspent his time. Fighting in Ireland prior to this\r\ntime had mainly been that of contests between famous warriors, or from\r\nchariots. Henceforward it becomes that of trained legions existing as\r\na standing militia. For Tuathal established the Fianna Eireann; and by\r\nmeans of this new weapon he restored the hegemony to Connacht.\r\n\r\nIt is right briefly to trace this dynastic struggle between Connacht\r\nand Uladh, because out of it, and out of the needs it created and the\r\nproblems it raised, grew the national State. Tuathal, king of Connacht,\r\nwith his palace at Cruachan Ai, came east to Uisneach, and from there\r\nexercised the hegemony of Ireland. It is said that he took the “necks”\r\nof the four provinces where they touched one another, and in each\r\n“neck” held a national festival for each quarter of the year. At Tara a\r\nspecial festival was held, at which the Brehons discussed and collated\r\nthe laws, and at which the local rulers discussed and compared the\r\nlocal administration of the country. In other words, a general tendency\r\ntowards uniformity was set up because of a direct central authority;\r\nand it was undoubtedly because of this tendency that Tuathal’s son,\r\nFedhlimidh, who succeeded him, received the title of Reachtmhar, the\r\nLaw-giver.\r\n\r\nTuathal, however, did not come east to Tara, except to the festival.\r\nTara was the seat of the kings of Leinster, with an elder glory and\r\nsignificance attaching to it that it is not easy to explain in any\r\ncritical use of the materials available. It was not for a century\r\nafter Tuathal that the Connacian dynasty, in the person of Cormac,\r\nestablished itself at Tara and compelled the kings of Leinster to make\r\ntheir headquarters elsewhere at Naas. Then the central authority took\r\na fresh accession of strength, and a definite and distinctive polity\r\nbegan to emerge, with the looser system that till then had prevailed\r\ntightened up and made uniform in all its parts.\r\n\r\nThe hegemony, for instance, passed, and Cormac became Ard-Ri, or\r\nMonarch, of Ireland. The new province of Meath was created for\r\nthe maintenance of the new monarchy. The festivals at Tara became\r\nmore splendid and authoritative, deriving as they now did from the\r\nadministrative authority of the monarch. This was especially the case\r\nas Cormac shines out quite clearly as a man of considerable force of\r\ncharacter and a statesman of a very high order. Under his supervision\r\nthe laws were reduced to writing. They might previously have existed\r\nin writing, for there are indications to show that writing existed\r\nfrom a very early time in Ireland; but they were now gathered in a\r\nsingle authoritative book. The immediate result of this would be that\r\na stricter uniformity in their administration was created. To ensure\r\nthis, and to make more easy the general administration of the country,\r\nhe regrouped the administrative units of the nation. Until then the\r\nnation had consisted of a number of separate stateships. Some were\r\nquite small, some were of considerable size. Some had been bound under\r\nheavy service, some had been comparatively free of service, to their\r\nrespective provincial kings. We do not often hear after this time of\r\nthese different obligations of service, nor do we find these great\r\ndifferences of size; and it is significant that this disappearance\r\nshould occur at a time when we are told that Cormac created a new order\r\nover Ireland. He made a number of new units, uniform in size, grouped\r\nin the provinces, and leading up in ranks of authority through the\r\nprovincial kingships to the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe old stateships were known as Tuatha; the new were called Triocha\r\nCed. The title Triocha Ced does not survive, while the older title of\r\nTuatha does. Therefore it seems likely that the new Triocha Ced became\r\nknown by the older and more familiar title of Tuatha; and, where an\r\nold Tuath of considerable size had a number of Triocha Ced created\r\nwithin it, that the new units became known as Tuatha, while the older\r\nstateship maintained its authority over the new units and became known\r\nby a new title that now comes into use, that of Mor-Thuath. That is\r\nconjecture; but it is a conjecture that conforms to the facts as we\r\nknow them in the subsequent development of the system.\r\n\r\nSuch is the polity as it left Cormac’s hands. He also established\r\nthe Fianna Eireann as a standing militia in the provinces--except in\r\nUlster, where the dynastic war had not ceased, and was not to cease\r\ntill the burning of Emain Macha. The political system he created, with\r\nits central code of laws, was one that could continue itself without\r\na central power; and it did so continue; for with his passing the\r\ncentral power weakened, falling into less able hands.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of Christianity two centuries later the system received\r\na new strength and unity. Loeghaire, the Monarch at the time, was\r\nhimself a man of considerable strength and ability, and Patrick was an\r\nadministrator of power and insight. The fact that the laws were revised\r\nin the general assembly at Tara, in order to bring them into conformity\r\nwith the teaching of Christianity, was in itself an impetus sufficient\r\nto brace the system anew; and a further strength was given when Patrick\r\nbased his church system on the political system, making the units of\r\none identical with the units of the other.\r\n\r\nOnly two things remain to be mentioned in the making or unmaking of\r\nthe polity. After the battle of Ocha, in the year 482, the dynastic\r\nfamily broke, the older line continuing as kings of Connacht, while\r\nthe younger line held the monarchy at Tara. While it continued at\r\nTara, with its central situation, it could hold its authority, though,\r\nas with all monarchies, its authority depended upon the personality\r\nof the monarch. But with the abandonment of Tara, after 1560, this\r\nauthority was at once weakened, having to be exerted sometimes from the\r\nfar north. The system, however, continued, because its device was such\r\nthat it could continue itself. The State existed, complete in all its\r\nparts, at once simple and complex, sufficient for its own maintenance;\r\nbut the strong central directive was lacking; for the tendency\r\ntowards centralisation was suspended with the abeyance of the dynastic\r\nstruggle. It was supplied, however, when Brian Borumha sprang into the\r\nfield, and snatched the monarchy from a weakened line.\r\n\r\nBrian rallied the nation, and knit and perfected the system that\r\nCormac had created. A simple, and indeed very modern, method existed\r\nto his hand that was partly turned to his purpose. It is customary to\r\nspeak of the Leabhar na gCeart as the Book of Rights, or Tributes. The\r\nmodern word, however, is Taxes; for taxes remain taxes whether they\r\nbe paid in coin or in kind. Each of the seven great territories, into\r\nwhich the provincial authorities had devolved, had some time prior to\r\nBrian laid down a regular revenue to be contributed to them by the\r\nstateships under their authority. This had been done as a national\r\nsystem, and had been committed to writing in one book. Brian, having\r\ntransferred the Kingship of Thomond to his own line, revised the\r\ncontributions accordingly within his own particular territory. He also\r\ntook contributions from each of the other six Kingships as Monarch of\r\nthe Nation. It only therefore required the centralisation of what was\r\nreally a fiscal system to complete the unity and central function of\r\nthe State. For so statecraft has always been compelled to meet the same\r\ndifficulty that confronted Brian in A.D. 1002.\r\n\r\nHad Brian lived, or had he been able to establish his dynasty, the\r\nresult would, without doubt, have been achieved. Unfortunately he fell\r\nin the hour of his triumph, at the battle of Clontarf. He had broken\r\nthe O’Neill succession; and the elder branch of that dynasty were the\r\nO’Conors of Connacht. Therefore for a century a triangular dynastic\r\ndispute arose between the O’Briens, the O’Neills, and the O’Conors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE POLITY AND THE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe polity that thus emerged consisted of a number of stateships\r\nthroughout the country, each of which was a smaller reproduction of the\r\nState in which it was comprised, and each of which was a unit in the\r\norganisation of that State. Because it was a system that was competent\r\nto continue itself independently of a central authority its natural\r\ntendency was to dispense with that central authority; yet the device\r\nwas such that authority, once established, was distributed from the\r\ncentre down to all the branches, and was gathered from the branches up\r\ntowards the centre, in a well-concerted scheme. And this proved to be\r\nthe case even when the monarch was weak, independently of his personal\r\npower.\r\n\r\nA good deal of confusion has been introduced into the understanding\r\nof old history by the way in which its records were written. Europe\r\nat that time was full of wars; and Ireland was no exception. To\r\nchroniclers in a day when personal prowess counted for much it was more\r\nimportant to record a battle in which some famous man fell than to\r\nrecord the continuous social life of a community. The result is that in\r\nthe records the battles seem to obliterate the social life, and plunge\r\nit into chaos. To the modern mind particularly it seems so, for the\r\nmodern man knows nothing of wars save as great continental cataclysms,\r\nin which whole nations are hurled against whole nations, and all life\r\nis brought to a standstill, while death claims its daily thousands, and\r\nchivalry is displaced by venom and hatred. The modern mind must not\r\njudge of ancient days by the world’s decay. The “battles,” that the\r\nbelittlers of Ireland are so eager to emphasise, as little suspended\r\nthe general life of the country, seldom employed a larger hosting of\r\nmen on each side, and even used few weapons more destructive, than the\r\nfaction fights of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We know,\r\nfor instance, that the eleventh century, when Ireland was involved in\r\na triangular dynastic dispute and more full of wars than at any other\r\ntime, is famous for its literary activity. Historians were busy, old\r\ntales were re-written, and great books were compiled. All this, we are\r\ntold, came from a soil across which wars were surging; but the result\r\nclearly shows that these wars did not suspend, or even greatly impede,\r\nthe artistic, social and economic life of the Nation. It is necessary\r\nto see this, and to get a right perspective, in perceiving the life of\r\nthe nation in the polity it achieved.\r\n\r\nEach separate stateship was at once two things. It was a political unit\r\nin the State and a social and economic unit in itself. The people were\r\nthe stateship, and the stateship was the people, for with them the\r\npower finally lay. They ruled their own affairs within the limits of\r\ntheir stateship, but were held within the single purpose of the State\r\nby the unified code of laws outside of which it was not within their\r\npower to transgress. However weak the monarch might be, these laws,\r\nand the trained and hereditary brehons who administered them, held the\r\nstateships in a uniformity of practice that was remarkable long after\r\nthe invader’s foot had brought disruption. But within that uniformity\r\neach stateship worked out its own destiny according to its own local\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nOriginally, it would seem, the land held within the limits of the\r\nstateship was divided out among all its people. But strangers entered,\r\noutlaws from other stateships and men upon the world, who became\r\nservitors to the original freemen. These held no land, and therefore\r\nheld no political rights in the stateship, inasmuch as they did not\r\nbelong to its staple life. These were, broadly, the two main divisions\r\nof the social life: _saor_ and _daor_, words only approximately\r\nrendered by free and unfree. There were sub-divisions within each of\r\nthese. The unfree could, with time and by steady conduct, enter the\r\nranks of the landowners. A number of them could as tradesmen form a\r\nguild, and as a corporate body claim political rights. But the staple\r\nlife of the stateship being the life on the land, in the main only\r\nthose who held land could have a voice in the guidance of its political\r\ndestiny. These were the overwhelming majority; for the unfree classes\r\nbeing accidental to the life of the stateship they, for the most part,\r\neither passed on, or, remaining, in the course of time joined its\r\npolitical life in some capacity.\r\n\r\nThis was inevitable. For no man held the land he occupied in his own\r\nright. All the land occupied by the stateship was vested in it, and\r\neach occupier only held its usage by his right as a freeman of the\r\nstateship. The stateship had the power to take any man’s holding from\r\nhim, from the king down, if he defied the will of the whole or was\r\noutlawed. The Noble classes held somewhat more securely, though it\r\nis not easy to define in what their greater security consisted; and\r\nin later times, owing to the unsettlement introduced by an invader’s\r\npresence, they claimed a prerogative right. But the plain meaning of\r\nthe laws is that no man held any land from which the stateship could\r\nnot dispossess him. That is quite clear and explicit. Therefore the\r\nland belonged not to its individual users, but to the stateship, though\r\neach freeman of the stateship could, as a freeman, claim, and was bound\r\nto receive, land for his use.\r\n\r\nNor could any man sell the usage of any land to anyone not in his own\r\nstateship without permission. Within his own stateship he could do so\r\nby obtaining permission from his own family. If he died his land was\r\nresumed by the family--a process that was known as _gabhal-cine_, “the\r\nseizure of the family,” in English corrupted to gavelkind--whereupon a\r\nredistribution would occur. From which it would seem that the grants\r\nwere not made to individuals, but to the heads of families, the kindred\r\nbeing a unit within the stateship as the stateship was a unit within\r\nthe State. But the right of the individual to the use of land none\r\ncould withhold; it was his title as a freeman, and was implanted in the\r\nheritage of his thoughts and instincts.\r\n\r\nLand, and its free possession by the people, were thus the foundation\r\non which the whole structure of the State was built. Power always\r\nderived thence and always returned thither again, as surely as water\r\nmust find its own level.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of rank among the freemen were mainly ranks of\r\nresponsibility, with corresponding privileges attached to each rank.\r\nThe Nobles, for instance, were clearly executive officers of the\r\nstateship. They held land from which they could not be dispossessed in\r\nany re-distribution that might be necessary. That is to say, they could\r\nnot be dispossessed of land until they were first dispossessed of their\r\nrank, and that would first involve a legal action; but on the other\r\nhand they were responsible for the use of that land to the stateship,\r\nand could not sell or hire that use to any member of another stateship\r\nwithout permission.\r\n\r\nThe two chief executive officers were the King of the stateship and\r\n(to employ a word that is not so modern as it appears) the mayors\r\nof townships. The King was elected by all the freemen in assembly,\r\nbut their choice was limited to selection from a kingly household,\r\nthe _righ-damhna_. He had, sitting in court, the power of capital\r\npunishment, with the approval of his brehons and the assent of the\r\npeople. This, it seems, was a power seldom exercised, for the ordinary\r\noperation of the law went otherwise; but the Annals record instances of\r\nits use. He led the stateship in war when a hosting was demanded; and\r\nas, in the festivals at Tara, he met in assembly with the Kings of all\r\nthe other stateships, it would seem that some code existed among them\r\nin order to bring the practice of their office into general uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe other executive officer held the alternative titles of\r\n_Bruighin-Fer_ and _Baile Biatach_. He was primarily the Public\r\nHospitaller. The _Bruighin_, or Hostel, had mensal lands attached to\r\nit by the stateship, and it was built with four doors to the four\r\nquarters in order to welcome all travellers, to whom hospitality was\r\ndispensed as a public dignity. Over this hospitality the _Bruighin-Fer_\r\nwas placed in charge as host for the stateship; but another function\r\nattached to his office, and appeared in the second title he came to\r\nwear. For the houses of the craftsmen and tradesmen collected about the\r\nHostel, and the whole became a township over which he ruled as mayor.\r\nIndeed, the modern Scottish word for mayor, baily, displays this origin\r\nquite clearly. The first intention of the Hostel was for the exercise\r\nof public hospitality; but inasmuch as the stateship, when it met in\r\nassembly to discuss and decide its internal affairs, or for that matter\r\nto debate national affairs, met in the same building, the office of\r\nthe Hospitaller obviously became one of considerable importance in the\r\ngeneral conduct of the life of the stateship. He became, not only\r\nHospitaller, but mayor of the central township; and therefore the first\r\nof his titles begins steadily to be displaced by the second.\r\n\r\nSuch men were strictly executive, and not legislative, officers, for\r\nthe legislation and general conduct of the stateship lay with its two\r\nassemblies. The first was an assembly of its nobles, and the second the\r\nassembly of all the freemen. They met to decide all internal affairs,\r\nsuch as redistribution of land if a family died out, the admission\r\nto political rank of an unfree man, or a guild of craftsmen, and the\r\noutlawing of any man who defied the finding of the brehons. But they\r\nhad other decisions in their hands which linked them in with the whole\r\nfabric of the National State. They decided who should be selected for\r\nhostings that were demanded of them; and when at a later date Hebridean\r\nmercenaries were scattered through the country as a kind of militia,\r\nand were quartered upon the stateships, the quarterings would naturally\r\nbe decided in assembly. Yet the important decision that lay in their\r\nhands dealt with the matter of taxes, or tributes. As we have seen,\r\nsuch taxes were levied upon each stateship as a whole, not upon the\r\nindividuals of the nation; and each stateship was thus left free to\r\ndistribute such taxes upon its own individuals according to its local\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, to its executive officers the stateship also\r\nprovided for its professional men. It had its own poets, historians,\r\nmusicians and lawyers, all of whom were maintained out of the public\r\nlands, and church lands were also apportioned for its bishop and\r\nclergy. All of these, or at least the highest ranks of these, met\r\ntogether in the national festivals, and debated their own affairs\r\nin separate national assemblies with the purpose of bringing about\r\na uniform practice throughout the nation, and fixing rules and\r\nregulations to that end. And even at a very late date, when the\r\npresence of an invader frustrated the possibility of a central\r\nauthority, the closest uniformity can be seen throughout the country,\r\nwhether in poetry, music or law, so well did the system maintain itself\r\nwhen the pivot on which it had swung was gone.\r\n\r\nNaturally the brehons were the most important of these professional\r\nclasses, for in the body of law which they administered the whole\r\npractice of the State was to be discovered. They were less judges\r\nthan civil arbitrators. They had no power of life and death, for that\r\nbelonged only to the King sitting in assembly. They could only affix\r\nthe compensations that were due for every offence that neighbour\r\ncommitted against neighbour; and these were determined with the most\r\nminute details with regard to every kind of offence in the general\r\nbody of the law. Some of the compensations can be seen to be such as\r\nwould ruin the offender; and they were apportioned to every man’s\r\nwealth according to the rank of society in which he was found, the same\r\noffence bringing a heavier penalty on a rich man than on a poor; but\r\nthe brehon had no means of compelling obedience to his judgment. He\r\ncould only give his judgment; the rest lay with the stateship.\r\n\r\nAn old text reads: “The feast of Tara ... the body of law which all\r\nIreland enacted then, during the interval between that and their next\r\nconvention at a year’s end, none dared to transgress; and he that\r\nperchance did so was outlawed from the men of Ireland.” If any man,\r\ntherefore, resisted a judgment made against him, the stateship outlawed\r\nhim, and withdrew all association with him. Thrust out from all rights,\r\nhe could only become a wanderer on the earth. Little wonder that the\r\nChief Baron, Lord Finglas, could say, even so late as 1520, when the\r\ncentral authority was gone, “Irishmen doth keep and observe such laws\r\nwhich they make upon hills in their country firm and stable, without\r\nbreaking them for any favour or reward.” And even Attorney-General\r\nDavies, of ill-fame, declared in 1607: “There is no nation of people\r\nunder the sun that doth equal and indifferent justice better than\r\nthe Irish, or will rest better satisfied with the execution thereof,\r\nalthough it be against themselves, as they may have the protection\r\nand benefit of the law when upon just cause they do desire it.” The\r\nreason is not far to seek. Law in the old Irish State was not a mere\r\ntechnical contrivance to be argued from black-letter, as now happens,\r\nby a few men whom the people universally distrust; it was founded\r\non a whole nation’s sense of justice. Nor was it lawyers who put it\r\ninto execution; but a stateship of freemen, acting in community, who\r\nenforced its obedience or expelled the offender by withdrawing all\r\ndealings with him.\r\n\r\nSuch was the internal economy of the stateship. Within itself it was\r\na social and economic unit. But in the State it was a political unit,\r\nfor it was fitted in as part of an elaborate national economy. If\r\nthe stateship in question were part of a Mor-Thuath, then its ruler\r\nwould only have the title of underking, _ur-ri_. In that case the\r\nstateship (_tuath_) would only come under the provincial king through\r\nthe territory (_mor-thuath_). Otherwise it would come under the\r\nimmediate jurisdiction of the province. And the provinces came under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Monarch. In the later stages, the territories\r\ndisplaced the provinces and came immediately under the Monarch. But\r\nalways the result was the same. The purpose of the State was to spread\r\nout the administration in a number of diminishing authorities, resting\r\nfinally on a free people in possession of the land on which the whole\r\nsystem was based; and to gather up that authority in tier after tier of\r\nexactly similar organisations to the headpiece of the monarchy. Each\r\nauthority was exactly the same as the one beneath it, with its elected\r\nking, bishop, brehons, poets, historians and full court, and with its\r\n_Bruighin_ and _Baile Biatach_ in capital townships of increasing\r\nimportance. The Monarch’s court was comprised exactly the same as the\r\ncourt of the king of a stateship, except that naturally his officers\r\nhad necessarily to win higher degrees in the schools. It would seem\r\nthat the schools themselves, of which the country was full and which\r\nwon such fame throughout Europe that scholars from far afield came\r\nto them, were based upon the same organisation even as the Church\r\norganisation had been.\r\n\r\nHow closely the system was interwoven appears from slight hints\r\ncast through the body of the laws. There is, for instance, a law\r\ntract dealing with the question of blood-guiltiness which throws an\r\ninteresting light on this point. It was a simple matter when a man had\r\nan action against another of his own stateship: a brehon of their own\r\nstateship could deal with the suit. But what happened when a man of\r\none stateship had an action against a man of a different stateship? By\r\nwhat arrangement was the case heard, and in what court was it held?\r\nFrom this tract it appears that an appeal was made up the line to a\r\nking, whether of territory, province or the monarch, who had equal\r\njurisdiction over both stateships; and he either judged the case\r\nhimself, if it called for a death penalty, or appointed a brehon from\r\nhis own court to adjudicate in the matter. Clearly, then, the elaborate\r\npattern of the State was not merely an abstract perfection, but one\r\nthat was submitted to frequent service. And further, a hint such as\r\nthis also shows that, whatever wars may have troubled the State, its\r\nordinary administration was maintained, while the life it contained\r\nraised problems that required to be answered.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Sovereign State of Ireland. Seen in the Europe of its\r\ntime the elaborate statesmanship with which it was created seems twice\r\nremarkable. Yet the fact that Ireland was able to send the light of\r\nlearning over a blighted Europe, and the fact that the schools of\r\nIreland became so famous that scholars and students came from overseas\r\nto learn in them, would require a national excellence in statecraft\r\ncommensurate with the national care of scholarship. Rare roses do not\r\nusually grow on waste heaps: a truth that it is sometimes useful to\r\nremember. Not the least excellence of the State was the equal dignity\r\nit gave to women. Whether women exercised political rights or not it\r\nis impossible to say; but in the social and economic spheres they took\r\ntheir place as the equal of men. In marriage, for instance, whatever\r\na woman brought to the union remained hers. If the pair were divorced\r\neach took his and her own share; whereas if either could prove that\r\nby his or her labour the common estate had prospered more than by the\r\nlabour of the other, that proportion, as fixed by the brehon, was added\r\nto the share. The same was true if either of them brought nothing to\r\nthe union. Never once do we find the law of the Irish State recognising\r\nany inequality between the sexes; and that again was remarkable in the\r\nEurope of the time. The whole conception of the Irish State--in the\r\nideals which it upheld, in the care with which it was wrought, in the\r\nbalance of its parts and its simple scheme yet intricate texture--both\r\nin what it sought and in what it achieved, may well challenge\r\ncomparison with the labours of statecraft in any place and at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE WORKING OF THE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere never yet was a State, however perfectly devised, whose\r\nperformance did not fall many leagues away from its intention. The\r\ndusty tomes on the top shelf only record the perfect, or imperfect,\r\nintention, for it is only by virtue of that intention that States exist\r\nat all. They do not record the follies and fatuities, the intrigues\r\nand trickeries, by which the best intentioned States are brought to\r\ngrief. In all vocabularies the word Polity signifies something noble,\r\nand in all vocabularies the word Politics means something ignoble. It\r\nis perhaps necessary to remember this, for a certain type of historian\r\n(primed to depreciate everything Irish) has been very eager to\r\ndiscover the motes in the eye of the early Irish State while carefully\r\nneglecting the beams in the eye of its own modern wisdom.\r\n\r\nYet the intention of a State remains worthy for its own sake; and that\r\nthe Irish performance during the first millenium did not fall very\r\nfar away from the intention is clear, not only by what it achieved in\r\nIreland, but also by what it achieved in Europe. As we have said, roses\r\nare not produced from waste heaps. The Irish State was actually in the\r\nprocess of solving its gravest fault when the invasion of a militarist\r\nsystem made that solution impossible. When Brian died in 1014 without\r\nestablishing his dynasty--when his son died in battle with him without\r\nbeing able to claim the reversion of his father’s work--Ireland was\r\nthrown into a dynastic war. Had Ireland remained without invasion\r\nthe Nation must have solved that difficulty by eventually winning\r\nsome system in which the executive stability would have been secured.\r\nUnhappily the country was invaded by a militarist system, which, being\r\na militarist system, lived on no economic labour of its own but preyed\r\non the economic labour of the country and played off one part of the\r\ndynastic dispute against another in order to secure the fruits of its\r\nrobbery. It so happened that the Nation had no means of resistance.\r\nThe Fianna Eireann had been disbanded because it had threatened the\r\nState. The stateships could not be called upon for more than six weeks’\r\nmilitary service at a time, and then not during Spring or Harvest, for\r\nthe Nation had to continue its economic life or endure famine; while\r\nthe feudal Normans preying on the economic labour of others could make\r\nwar at all times and without cessation. And every year saw them making\r\ngood their hold, while the stateships weakened, until finally when\r\nHebridean mercenaries were introduced and quartered on the stateships\r\nit was too late to eject the invader.[1]\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been suggested that these dynastic wars arose because\r\nthe kingships, from the monarchy downwards, were elective. This is not\r\nso. The trouble was that they were neither one thing nor the other.\r\nHad they been frankly hereditary a certain kind of security would have\r\nbeen won for the executive. On the other hand, had they been frankly\r\nelective, basing the election on the necessary qualifications for\r\nkingship demanded in the laws, a different kind of stability would\r\nhave been secured. The straightforward dependence on the people’s\r\nchoice would have compelled some protection for their choice when\r\nmade, especially as the defeated candidates would still have preserved\r\nintact their chances for a subsequent election; and the monarchy\r\nwould have been drawn into closer relation with the stateships.\r\nThe system that actually prevailed, however, gave neither sort of\r\nadvantage, and was plainly a compromise from some earlier dispute. The\r\nmonarch was elected, it is true, but he could only be elected from\r\nthe _righ-damhna_. That _righ-damhna_ consisted of all within three\r\ngenerations from a king. That is to say, if a king’s sons were not\r\nchosen in the succession after him, and the grandsons were missed, and\r\nthe great-grandsons after them, then the whole line passed out from\r\nthe _righ-damhna_. Now, if Irish history be closely examined it will\r\nbe found that most of the disputes arose at this critical point. Men\r\nwere usually not willing to carry their failure to secure election to\r\nthe point of war unless they happened to be at the critical fourth\r\ngeneration when that failure meant the extinction of their whole\r\nline from royal rights. And when it so fell out that three separate\r\ndynasties claimed those rights, it is fairly clear that the critical\r\nmoment would always be arising, or always be threatened.\r\n\r\nIt is speculation to suggest how this would have been remedied had the\r\nState been left free to work out its own destiny. Clearly the executive\r\nwould either have become frankly hereditary or frankly elective.\r\nProbably at that time it would have become hereditary, especially as\r\nthe son generally claimed to succeed from his father unless there\r\nwere special reasons why he should not or could not. But then, what\r\nof the kings of stateships and territories? Had these also become\r\nhereditary the State from top to bottom would have become impossibly\r\nrigid; but there are reasons to suggest why this would not have been\r\nso. For one thing, the kings of stateships were elected by the voice\r\nof the freemen, whereas the kings of the higher executives were\r\nelected by their own courts. Moreover, the stateships served immediate\r\nand local needs that required the consent of the freemen for their\r\ncontinual adjustment. The two operating together would undoubtedly\r\nhave compelled, without any of the complications of a _righ-damhna_,\r\nthe perfectly free election of the executive head and leader of a\r\nstateship. Therefore had the monarchy become hereditary there would\r\nhave been two contradictory principles in the State; there would always\r\nbe a tendency to bring one into line with the other; and it is not very\r\ndifficult to see which principle would finally have prevailed.\r\n\r\nAny arrogation of power by the monarch (and it is the first principle\r\nof monarchs to arrogate power) would have struck athwart the rule of\r\nthe people in their most familiar and immediate life. A moment always\r\narises in history (always has arisen and always will arise) when a\r\nmonarch and a people front one another with the claim to real power. In\r\nsuch issues the people always win in the end, even when their rights\r\nin the State are most degraded. How much simpler would the issue be\r\nwhen the people, as in the Irish State, held the land, the final source\r\nof all wealth, in their own possession in corporate stateships? In\r\nthe crisis that later befell all States no nation could have faced\r\nthe future with greater assurance than Ireland, had Fate not thrown a\r\nsterner destiny before it.\r\n\r\nIn the same dispute another fault of the State was involved--in fact,\r\nwas one of the causes that led to the invasion of the foreigner. For\r\nthe dynastic war was really the struggle of the provinces for the\r\nhegemony. The O’Neills of Meath and Ulster, the O’Conors of Connacht\r\nand the O’Briens of Munster contended together in the names of their\r\nprovinces; and the Mac Murchadhas of Leinster, having no part in the\r\nwar, were driven into a false isolation. This was only possible because\r\nthe provinces had interposed an authority between the executive of\r\nthe State and the stateships that had no real function. They could\r\nmaterially hinder, and could not materially help, the smooth working\r\nof the State. Had the provincial or territorial courts not existed\r\nthe result would have been as deft a balance between a centralised\r\nand decentralised State as can well be imagined. The interposition\r\nof the provincial courts reduced the central authority almost to a\r\nfutility except when a masterful personality held the monarchy. They\r\nbroke the balance between the centre and parts of the whole, and in\r\nthe result snapped the connection that existed between them. The only\r\nreal link they needed they possessed in the Councils that met under the\r\npresidency of the Monarch in national assembly to adjust and continue\r\nthe government of the country: the Council of Brehons, the Council of\r\nRulers, the Council of Historians, and so forth. Each Council decided\r\nits own affairs, and the Monarch and his higher officials held the\r\nwhole in co-ordination. That was a real and a vital connection. No\r\nother was needed. The provincial courts could only--possessing as they\r\ndid, for the most part, powers almost equal to the monarchy--break that\r\nconnection, and so disturb the balance of the whole. They did so in\r\nthe outcome of things, occupying the place that they did; and they did\r\nso deliberately, creating local loyalties in order to increase their\r\npower. They were, and could not help but be, a disruptive element in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the dynastic war of the eleventh century, pressed to its\r\nlogical consummation, would have ended this false value. The dynastic\r\nwar of the first centuries between Connacht and Ulster had ended in the\r\nelimination of Ulster as a rival; and, however the later war would have\r\nended, a strong central authority must eventually have emerged and the\r\nprovincial kingships have been reduced to a merely nominal position in\r\nthe economy of the State, without possessing the power to dispute the\r\nmonarchy or its executive hold on the Nation. This in its turn would\r\nhave required a national army; and would have answered another defect.\r\nFor when in the fifth century Ireland disbanded her national militia,\r\nthe Fianna Eireann, she lay a prey to any invader at a time when armies\r\nhad become national necessities.\r\n\r\nSuch criticisms are, it is true, speculative. Even as such, however,\r\nan attempt has been made to keep them close to the development that\r\nthe events themselves suggest--to the development that, as history\r\nproves, all nations must finally obey. In the eleventh century, it\r\nmust be remembered, Ireland was almost the only country in Europe with\r\na national State. Other nations were not to achieve their States for\r\ncenturies; and even then many of them now famous did not create States\r\nso careful in its parts and so concerted as a whole. It is not at\r\nall likely that Ireland, had she been left alone to work out her own\r\ndestiny, would have continued with a broken State without correcting\r\nthe causes of its disruption. She would have proved a startling\r\nexception to the course of history had she done so. Yet the main value\r\nof such criticisms is that they permit an examination of the Irish\r\nState at a moment when its inherent weaknesses had worked themselves\r\nout to the surface. At the height of Brian’s power those weaknesses\r\nexisted, but they were held in submission by his personal strength.\r\nAfter his death they at once rose to the surface, just because of the\r\nstrength with which he had held them in submission and the manner by\r\nwhich he had risen to power. They then demanded a remedy contained in\r\nthe State itself, and not dependent on the strength of a master mind.\r\nAnd in looking to the old Irish State for instruction it is important\r\nto note its weaknesses once they revealed themselves, and to perceive\r\nthe development by which they would have been corrected.\r\n\r\nYet, while criticism is good, it is proper to look on the other side of\r\nthe coin. In the light of its own day the Irish State was a remarkable\r\nachievement, but in the light of any other day it would be hard to find\r\na statecraft so complete, so wise and so soundly based on a people’s\r\nwill while compact in itself. It was at once both aristocratic and\r\ndemocratic: in fact, it makes these modern expressions to seem, what\r\nthey are, false entities, for it shows them to be parts of one whole,\r\nobverse and reverse of the same thing. The Normans when they came\r\ncommented on the familiarity that existed between the members of a\r\nstateship and its king. The king, in fact, was generally required to\r\nfoster his children with some freeman’s family. Yet to be a king a man\r\nhad to be pure of birth, perfect of body, without physical blemish,\r\nand of considerable training in the laws and arts; while the oath he\r\ntook, even though it were not always kept, is sufficient to show the\r\nmoral qualities expected of his office. The arts did not exist at the\r\nwhim of a lordly patron, but were maintained at the people’s charges.\r\nEach stateship conceived it an honour that Poetry, Music and History\r\nshould be accorded the highest rank in its economy. Their professors\r\nwere furnished land for their maintenance, and sat as equals at the\r\nking’s table. The same was true of the Doctors of Medicine. These\r\nwere all public servants, serving the public and maintained at the\r\npublic charge. Those that came overseas to learn in the schools were,\r\napparently, not charged for their tuition, but had only to conform to\r\nthe legal responsibility laid on such schools, for they came in such\r\nnumbers that the Council of Brehons had to make special regulations for\r\nthem. And the _Baile Biatach_, as we have seen, had land apportioned\r\nhim for the maintenance of public hospitality. These things were not\r\nthen, any more than they are now, precisely familiar virtues among the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nSo for the State itself, as an organisation. Its faults we have seen;\r\nbut, even so, it found as wise a balance as any nation has yet found\r\nbetween a centralised and a decentralised system. Authority, to be\r\nsure, depended a good deal from the personality of whoever exercised\r\nit; but then history has shewn that this was not an attribute\r\nexclusively monopolised by the Irish State. In the last resort, not\r\nonly in the theory but in the practice and working of the State, that\r\nauthority was based on a free people. The State’s only property,\r\nand the final source of all its wealth, the land, was owned by the\r\npeople in corporate stateships; and those corporate stateships had its\r\nassemblies of freemen which discussed and adjudicated its affairs. The\r\nnational life was one of high ideals--of Art; of physical and mental\r\naristocracy; it held in high esteem its intellectual leaders; it prized\r\nits scholarship--but these ideals were rooted in the possession and\r\nhusbandry of the soil. The student will need to search well before he\r\nbetters the Irish State; and the more truly he search the more deeply\r\nhe will wonder at the strange tragedy that it should have been hindered\r\nat a critical hour of its development.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] A parallel instance may serve to show how the working of the State,\r\ntaken at a moment of indecision, was turned against itself. In the\r\nfifteenth century England was plunged into a dynastic war. Those who\r\nhave read the documents of the time will know with what perfidy that\r\nwar was marked. The English barons openly sold their swords to the\r\nhighest bidder as a natural thing. Treachery and insecurity were rife\r\non every hand. Now, if an enemy had invaded England at that moment,\r\nand had been willing to pay the extra prices that would have been\r\ndemanded of a foreigner, and, where this was not possible, had turned\r\npassion and party strength against passion and party strength, taking\r\ncare to balance the contending forces evenly, such an enemy could have\r\nentrenched himself in the country, and in the course of time have\r\ndefied ejectment. England was spared this misfortune; Ireland was not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE BROKEN STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry of Anjou and England when he came to Ireland, with a somewhat\r\nmunificent gesture made grants of large tracts of territory to his\r\nunderlings. It was nobly done; to make gifts of other people’s property\r\nto one’s own friends requires a noble mind. Therefore the lordly\r\nunderlings settled along the waterways of the territory allotted to\r\nthem, built castles, and from these castles raided the economic life\r\nof the country around them. At first the stateships received the\r\nnewcomers as strangers coming into the country, who would in time\r\nbecome part of its life. They did not conceive of such a thing as an\r\nattempted national conquest. Then when they rose to resist, they were\r\nhandicapped. They had no national army; and, though the freemen could\r\nbe called upon for military service, they could not be called for\r\nmore than six weeks at a time, and then not during Spring or Harvest,\r\nwhereas the Normans lived only by the sword in the close militarist\r\norganisation known as feudalism. The eleventh century in Ireland had\r\nseen a long dynastic war, but it had also seen a full scholarly and\r\nartistic activity. With the coming of the Normans all this activity was\r\nstilled and hushed for two centuries. And that was the sign-manual of\r\nthe new era that had dawned.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, preoccupied as they necessarily were with their economic\r\nlife, the people invited their Hebridean cousins to come over as a\r\npaid militia. They came, at first into the north, and were quartered\r\non the stateships; and from the time of their coming the Normans began\r\nto be pressed back toward Dublin, and the annals record the taking\r\none by one of the Norman castles. That was the first attempt to throw\r\noff the national danger that was now appreciated. The second was to\r\nrestore the executive authority. O’Neill, O’Brien and O’Conor had\r\ncontended in rivalry, but the Ui Niall dynasty held the more ancient\r\nclaim; therefore in 1258 Aodh O’Conor and Tadhg O’Brien made a hosting\r\ntogether to Brian O’Neill to offer their submission to him if he would\r\nlead them against the foreigner. He did so, but was overthrown and\r\nslain. Therefore an offer of the monarchy was sent to Hakon of Norway\r\nfive years later. He was on his way over when he died at sea. Finally\r\nan invitation was sent to Edward Bruce by Domhnaill O’Neill in the\r\nname of Ireland. Bruce came in 1315, was crowned Monarch of Ireland,\r\nand carried a war throughout the country that wasted the land. When he\r\nfell three years later at the battle of Faughert, the country was in a\r\ndesperate condition; but the invader was thrown back to a small tract\r\nof country around Dublin that became known as the Pale.\r\n\r\nSuch were the attempts, made too late, to restore the State and eject\r\nthe invader. One was dependent on the other. It was clearly impossible\r\nto restore the State until the invader had first been cast out. His\r\npresence in the country necessarily acted like an obstruction in the\r\nblood, and made it impossible for the body of the State to resume its\r\nhealth and perfect its functions until the poison had been expelled.\r\nThis was so in the natural law of things; but, in addition to this\r\nnatural and inevitable result, the invaders, in order to maintain\r\ntheir position in the country, set to work to create division between\r\nthe scattered portions of the broken State. That was easy to do.\r\nThe leaders in the different parts of the country have been blamed\r\n(by none more than by their nation) for serving their own sectional\r\ninterests instead of the national unity. But how were they to discover\r\nthe national unity, and how were they to distinguish, as we now can\r\ndistinguish, between sectional and national interests? The history of\r\nmankind proves that in a broken State it is a simple task to create\r\ndiscord, and a giant’s task to create unity. The invaders acted at\r\nfirst from a common centre; and the nature of the case robbed the Irish\r\nNation of any common centre from which to act. That was the first\r\ndifficulty. Secondly, there are always men in every Nation who are\r\nwilling to sell their honour. So long as Nations can repel invasion\r\nthat fact does not become an active danger within the security of its\r\nState; but directly an invader enters a country, with gold and honours\r\nin his gift, it becomes almost impossible to overtake the poison that\r\nruns in every direction. Men grow suspicious of the most honest purpose\r\nif that purpose is not at once apparent; and if it is at once apparent\r\nit is thereby at once revealed to the enemy. Finally, most men are\r\nnear-sighted; they judge of large issues by their immediate effects,\r\nand so mistake those immediate effects for the large issues, making it\r\neasy for an enemy to drive divisions in between sectional interests.\r\nThese things are so, not necessarily because men are corrupt, but by\r\nthe nature of things; and their combined result was the broken State of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nA further difficulty was the fact that the Nation had new elements cast\r\ninto it that it had to digest; and in some places it had those new\r\nelements cast into it in large numbers. The Normans were mostly driven\r\nout of the north; but others had settled and made their positions\r\nsecure in other parts, the De Burgos in the west, for instance, and\r\nthe FitzGeralds and Butlers in the south. The old State was broken\r\nby their forcible seizure of land; but then we find it automatically\r\nsetting to work to mend the broken fabric, to restore the stateships,\r\nand to include the stranger within its ancient constitution. In that it\r\nwas successful. The De Burgos and FitzGeralds became, as the English\r\ndeclared, more Irish than the Irish themselves. The former publicly\r\nrepudiated their very names, and took Irish names, as Mac William\r\nUachtar and Mac William Iachtar. They simply displaced, or depressed,\r\nthe kingly households of earlier territories. The same was true of\r\nthe FitzGeralds, though with them, as far as we can judge, there were\r\ncertain changes introduced, not into the stateships, but into the\r\nlarger territories in which these were comprised. The chief of these\r\nchanges seems to have been that the FitzGeralds held their kingships by\r\nright of primogeniture and not by election. Yet in the main the changes\r\nwere not many or fundamental. Irish was spoken as the native language;\r\nIrish courts were kept, of brehons, poets and historians, exactly as\r\nthe older Irish kingships had maintained them; and by force of marriage\r\nin a few generations the intermixture of the new blood was hardly to be\r\ndiscovered beside the permanence of the old. Only the Butlers in the\r\nsouth-east kept their connection with England. The others broke away\r\nfrom the common centre of the invader, and became included in the elder\r\nnational continuity.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the State was scattered. The stateships continued their\r\nlife; the parts, that is to say, were complete, except for a portion\r\nof country around Dublin and another about Waterford; but they were\r\nonly parts, for the whole was in disrepair. And now a definite war\r\nbetween State and State was declared, the end of which has not yet\r\nbeen seen. By the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367 every sign of national\r\nlife in Ireland was penalised by English law. It was forbidden to hear\r\nan Irish poet, to take judgment from a brehon, to foster children in\r\nthe Irish way, to speak the Irish language, and even to wear a beard\r\nas the Irish did, or ride a horse barebacked. It is true these things\r\nwere only forbidden within the Pale, because only within the Pale\r\nhad the invader any authority; but they were in fact, and afterwards\r\nbecame, a declaration in Ireland of a war between an English State and\r\nan Irish State. They were an intimation that the old Irish culture and\r\nState were marked for extinction. It is interesting to remember that\r\nat the moment this declaration was made England had little culture,\r\nno literature, only the beginnings of law, and a very rudimentary\r\nState. The Statutes of Kilkenny were very like a young vulgarian raging\r\nagainst an elder’s manners that made his own lack of courtesy apparent.\r\n\r\nFortunately at this time England herself was plunged into a bitter\r\ndynastic war. The immediate result on Ireland was that, relieved from\r\nthe pressure of her neighbour, a great period of prosperity began.\r\nThe beginnings were slow, for the land was wasted after the Bruce\r\ncampaign; but the progress quickened with each decade. It began with\r\nthe integration of the Normans in the middle of the fourteenth century;\r\nand it continued till the end of the English Wars of the Roses. The\r\npoet took up his song again; the historian his pen; and the scholar\r\nhis books. Great convocations of learned men were held; and new law\r\ntracts were written, drafted for changed conditions. The stateships\r\nbecame the centres of new activity. Corn was exported in considerable\r\nquantities. The guilds of artisans became busy again, to judge from\r\nthe exports of woollen, linen, leather and metal wares. The literary\r\nactivity--or at least such of it as escaped the soldiers’ burning--has\r\nremained to us. The other activity can only be discovered by the trade\r\nbooks of other countries; for Ireland, having no organised State of her\r\nown, could keep no record of her commerce. But these books reveal the\r\nconsiderable trade Ireland conducted with the continent of Europe. The\r\nIrish ports, chiefly on the western and southern coasts, with their own\r\ncorporate stateships, became the avenue through which the industry of\r\nthe internal stateships supplied the demand of Europe. And since there\r\nwas no Irish State to create a medium of exchange, at least one of the\r\nterritories, that of the O’Reillys, had to mint its own coinage for the\r\nconduct of its trade.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though once again the Irish State was about to complete\r\nitself. But once again an invading soldiery brought ruin. This time\r\nit was the final ruin. England had settled her dynastic war, and\r\nturned her attention to Ireland. The old methods were renewed with a\r\nnew perfection of craft. The Statutes of Kilkenny became an active\r\nweapon of offence; and with each new monarch of the Tudor dynasty the\r\nwar between State and State was carried to a closer issue. The Irish\r\nlanguage was interdicted; the Irish manner of dress was forbidden;\r\nand finally every attempt was made to blot out every memory of the\r\nIrish stateships and to create English counties in their stead. Kings\r\nof territories were offered pompous English titles if they pledged\r\nto abstain from the use of their simple Irish titles. To help them\r\nto a decision they were offered the land over which they ruled, to\r\nbe held by feudal knight’s service and to descend by feudal right\r\nof primogeniture. Those who accepted this offer at once found the\r\nstateships in rebellion against them, for that land did not lie in\r\nthe gift of any man but belonged only to the freemen. They rose in\r\nprotection of their rights since time immemorial; and they rose to\r\nrepudiate their elected officer; with the result that a soldiery was\r\nsent against them that burned their crops and left their land a waste.\r\n\r\nSuch was the last phase of the war by which the State was to be broken,\r\nnot only as a whole, but in its several parts. The country far and wide\r\nbecame acquainted with a soldiery whose business it was to tear out\r\nall memory of the National State. At the end of that war there arose\r\na figure who saw clearly all that was involved. That was Hugh, the\r\ndescendant by Irish election of the O’Neill monarchy. He had worked\r\nlong to link all parts of the country together under his leadership;\r\nand, knowing the power against which he was opposed, he had entered\r\ninto treaty with the Spanish Crown to assist him. Feeling that these\r\nSpanish promises were not sincerely given, so often had they been made\r\nand as often broken, he thought to save what he could from the wreckage.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1598 the Earl of Essex was sent against him he met him in\r\nparley and made him an offer to bear to Elizabeth. Whether that offer\r\nwas sincerely made, or only put out to save time, does not matter here;\r\nbut it contained one article that is very significant. It runs thus:\r\n“That all nations in Ireland shall enjoy their living as they did two\r\nhundred years ago.” Now it is clear that he uses the word “nations”\r\nin some special sense--that he is, in fact, rendering some word from\r\nIrish. Nor is it difficult to discover what that word is. He can only\r\nbe referring to the _tuatha_, or stateships, on which the State was\r\nbased that was now threatened with extinction; and his demand was that\r\nthey should remain intact and unmolested as they had been “two hundred\r\nyears ago,” when England was busy with civil war. The demand was\r\nrejected. He could hardly have expected anything else. And when he was\r\nfinally defeated five years afterwards, those “nations,” or stateships,\r\nwere doomed to a final and terrible ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE RESURRECTION FROM THE DEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horror of the Plantations and Confiscations was not due simply to\r\nthe land-avarice of a conqueror. In some measure they sprang from that\r\nsimple and immediate lust, but really they arose from a much remoter\r\nnecessity. They were logically inevitable from the invader’s point of\r\nview. The war of State against State, from that point of view, was\r\nalways finally helpless because the Irish State, dismembered though\r\nit was, took strangers coming into the country and enveloped them in\r\nits own polity. And it was indestructible so long as it was based on\r\nthe free ownership of land. Therefore to destroy the State it was\r\nnecessary to root it out of the land; and as the State was composed of\r\nthe people, and could not be composed otherwise, it was necessary to\r\nroot them out of the land. What happened to them afterwards was but\r\nan incident in the campaign. They were to be replaced by a new set\r\nof proprietors who would come with the intuitions and desires of the\r\nforeign State, and who would be provided with very good reasons to see\r\nthat the new shire-land with themselves as lords thereof did not revert\r\nto stateships in the possession of the people.\r\n\r\nCromwell’s gentle watchword “To Hell or to Connacht,” therefore,\r\nwas the logical consummation of that policy. It was the full peal\r\nof bells of which the Statutes of Kilkenny were the first brazen\r\nintimation. And when he had finished his righteous labours for the\r\nLord God of Hosts the wildest dreamer in the world in his wildest of\r\ndreams would not have thought that his work could be undone. But a\r\nstrange thing happened. Official documents indicate that his work was\r\ncompletely done. The Nation was first decimated--“nits will be lice”\r\nwas the playful phrase of his soldiers as they caught babes on their\r\npike-heads. Then it was swept west of the Shannon; and thoroughly\r\nswept, to judge by the procedure adopted. But within thirty years it\r\nis found back upon the land--O’Neills where O’Neill stateships had\r\nbeen, Maguires where Maguire stateships had been, and so forth. The\r\nRoll of the Parliament of 1689 as clearly indicates the countries from\r\nwhich the members came from the names they wore as those names would\r\nhave indicated two centuries before. Historians have therefore thought\r\nthat, in spite of the effectiveness of Cromwell’s procedure, his work\r\nhad not been very completely done. But what is more likely is that,\r\nwith hopes raised by the Restoration, the people began steadily to\r\nstream back across the country to the places they knew, where their\r\nfathers had lived in free stateships, in order to be ready for any\r\nchange that might come. There is no record of their journey. There is\r\nno place where such a journey could have been recorded. All that is\r\nsure is that, whereas Cromwell intended to sweep the Nation west of\r\nthe Shannon, and adopted a procedure well-drafted to achieve his end,\r\nat the end of the century the Nation is found back upon its lands\r\nin the very groupings in which it had held them in old times in free\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThe change was that the freemen were a rent-paying tenantry. In other\r\nwords, there were, as it were, two layers through the country, and\r\neach layer represented its own State-idea. The topmost layer was the\r\nlandlordry, which, being in power, had enforced its own State-idea.\r\nWhen it became, as it finally did, an absentee landlordry, that\r\nState-idea did not voice any of the desires, expectations or intuitions\r\nof the resident population. In fact, it outraged them at every point.\r\nThe more truly was this the case when, under the Penal code, the\r\nsubmerged layer of the rent-paying tenantry was denied every right\r\nin the existent State. In the words of the Lord Chancellor of that\r\nState, “The law” (that is to say, the law of the imported State)\r\n“did not suppose any such person to exist as an Irish Catholic.” The\r\ntwo State-ideas were not only mutually contradictory, but they were\r\ndeliberately kept apart; and there is no indication to show that those\r\nwho carried in their instincts or memories the old State-idea took any\r\ninterest in the foreign State except the interest of sufferers.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position during the eighteenth century. The Nation seemed\r\ndead and buried, with a stone rolled across its sepulchre. Any thought\r\nof its resurrection would have been treated by its jailers as a proper\r\nsubject for comedy. Certainly its Polity seemed to have passed into\r\nhistory--indeed, to have passed beyond history, for those jailers did\r\nnot intend to let intellectual curiosity, their’s or others’, stray\r\ninto that neglected field. But at this moment, when the Nation lived on\r\nsorrel boiled up with blood let from cattle while the tillage of their\r\nland went to rents, a strange parenthesis in the history of Ireland\r\noccurred. The jailers themselves arose and demanded the liberty for\r\nwhich the ancient Nation had fought over whom they had been placed in\r\nguard. They demanded it with cannon, musket and pike; and with these\r\npersuasive arguments they won a great measure of that liberty. They\r\nestablished a Sovereign Parliament under a Dual Monarchy, but with\r\nan utterly unworkable constitution. It was unworkable because they\r\nremembered the source from which they sprang; and would not, and indeed\r\ncould not, carry victory to its logical conclusion. If they severed\r\nthemselves from the source of their power, they were thrown into the\r\narms of the Nation over whom they were in guard, and who formed the\r\noverwhelming majority of the population of the country. It was also\r\nunworkable in itself. In the Regency debate they asserted their right\r\nto appoint their own Regent; and that logically meant the right to\r\nappoint their own king; but, as FitzGibbon pointed out, the Seal was\r\nin the care of the English Chancellor, and that gave England the final\r\nword in all matters. It was an independence that needed force at every\r\nmoment to make it of any avail; but it was independence, nevertheless,\r\nand therefore by the Act of Union England struck down her own jailers\r\nand abolished their little hour of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe parenthesis was concluded, and history was able to take its\r\ncourse again. The liberty that Grattan had won had been the liberty\r\nof the English State in Ireland; the liberty, that is to say, of\r\nthe State-idea of the uppermost layer. The overwhelming mass of the\r\npopulation was comprised of the old Nation with its own and separate\r\nState-idea. It had no part in, and no interest in, the liberty their\r\njailers had won for themselves; and the State in which that liberty\r\nhad been held (if State it may be called that represented nothing of\r\nthe population) voiced none of its instincts or desires. But when the\r\nwatcher at the gate had been struck down the Nation arose, feebly at\r\nfirst, and marched into the nineteenth century to claim satisfaction\r\nfor those desires and instincts.\r\n\r\nThe course of the nineteenth century in Ireland is like a resurrection\r\nfrom the dead. It is full of memories--memories prior to 1603 and the\r\ndestruction of the Irish State. The very order is significant. The\r\nNation had lost certain things in a certain order; in its resurrection\r\nit set about to regain them in the inverse order. It had lost, first,\r\nits State; then its language and culture, the flowers of that State,\r\nhad been penalised; then its land, on which the State had been based,\r\nwas taken; and finally its liberty of faith. It won back, first, its\r\nliberty to faith; then its land; then its separate culture; and now it\r\nseeks its State.\r\n\r\nLiterally and precisely the nineteenth century in Ireland is one of\r\nthe most remarkable movements in history. It is like a great hall\r\nfull of ghostly memories, but ghosts that bewilderingly become flesh\r\nand blood before our very eyes. It is a haunted hall where memories\r\nbecome realities again, instead of realities passing into memories.\r\nThe struggle for Catholic Emancipation, it is true, was not of this\r\norder. It was part of a larger world movement into which the Nation\r\nwas compelled by the leadership of one man. It may or may not have\r\nbeen the best beginning to have made; its fruits were unreal; and the\r\nvictory was soon lost sight of by the Nation. But the land-war arose\r\nspontaneously from the people in a form that suggested an ancient\r\nmemory. Before it found expression the compiler of the Devon Commission\r\nDigest remarked “that the tenant claims what he calls a tenant-right\r\nin the land, irrespective of any legal claim vested in him, or of any\r\nimprovement effected by him.” He mentions it as a curious thing; and to\r\nhim, with his foreign State-idea, it was indeed a curious thing; yet it\r\nwas only the first re-assertion of a very old memory. For the Nation\r\nwas not asserting a tenant’s right, but re-asserting a freeman’s right.\r\nAnd inasmuch as the landlordry was now mainly absentee it was making\r\nthat re-assertion in a solid national formation.\r\n\r\nIt was for this moment it had clung to the land with such fidelity.\r\nDuring the first forty years of the century rents were increased by\r\nthirty, forty, and in some cases fifty per cent. On an average it took\r\na man 250 days of the year to clear his rent; and this meant that the\r\npeople could only live on the dregs of the land and on sorrel and\r\ncattle-blood. Yet still they clung. When Pestilence and Starvation\r\nstalked through the land, and the young men and girls had to fly\r\nover-seas, the families still clung to their holdings. Those young\r\nmen and girls lived in penury in America in order that their earnings\r\nshould be sent home to maintain the grip on the land. The Nation was\r\nholding its old property, and meant to win it back. They arose in war\r\nand shot the usurpers on their ancient property. And then at the height\r\nof that war they suddenly, in a new awakening of memory, put their old\r\nlaw into operation--the very law by which the land had been ensured\r\nto them as a freeman’s possession. “The body of the law which all\r\nIreland enacted none dared to transgress; and he that perchance did so\r\nwas outlawed from the men of Ireland.” The landlord transgressed that\r\nlaw, so the people outlawed him. Boycotting according to the foreign\r\nState-idea was lawlessness, yet it was truly the assertion of the law\r\nof one State against the usurpation of another State. Not being the\r\nenactment of its own central authority it was naturally subject to\r\nlocal abuse; yet it was not lawlessness but the revival of a legal\r\nprocedure. And finally the land was won back, though the people were\r\ncompelled to pay for the property that had been robbed from them. So\r\npotent a thing was the old expectation.\r\n\r\nSo deep a national stirring was not without its effects far and wide,\r\nespecially as it was less an event in itself than part of a greater\r\nwhole. The century was continually shaken by a series of revolutions,\r\nthe pulsations of its re-awakening life, each of which struck its\r\nroots down deeper into the past, and brought forth memories like\r\nblossoms that became completer and more perfect with the years. After\r\nthe broken attempt for freedom in 1848 a new impetus was given to the\r\ncultural movement that had begun with the Young Irelanders, but this\r\nnow took the form of a search into the forgotten manuscripts in the\r\nIrish language, in which the elder culture was stored. After 1867 the\r\nactive publication of these records began by a number of societies, and\r\nthe Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language was started.\r\nIrishmen’s minds turned to the annals of their own elder history, and\r\nviewed with alarm the perishing, under tense economic strain, of their\r\nnational speech, the only adequate vehicle of their distinctive thought\r\nand intuitions. After the Land War the Gaelic League was started as an\r\norganised attempt, not only to save the national language and to compel\r\nits study and use, but to revive all that was distinctively national\r\nby means of that language. It became a shame among Irishmen not to\r\nspeak their own language, not to delight in their own music, not to\r\ndance their own dances, and not to make their national past, especially\r\nthe past of the days of glory, their intellectual possession. For, as\r\nwas inevitable, the awakening had passed out of spontaneity into an\r\norganised intellectual effort, as the spontaneous hours of youth pass\r\ninto the discipline of intellectual manhood. Yet neither is artificial,\r\nfor both partake of the growth that is part of life.\r\n\r\nBoth instinct and intellect were present, and each was part of the\r\nother. When an Irishman threw the co-operative idea among farmers as\r\na means by which they could combat the great organised farming of the\r\nAmericas, the people took slowly to the idea as a foreign economic\r\ntheory. Then they seized it, and turned their co-operative societies\r\ninto rural communities that were a re-birth in modern conditions of\r\ntheir old stateships. Most of them, as the fruit of the Land War, were\r\nnow beginning to own their farms, and that gave them the foundation\r\nof which the stateships had been built. In the central hall of the\r\nco-operative society the economic business of the community was\r\ndiscussed, and around it its artisans and artificers collected. That\r\nwas done naturally, as the result of instinct, but then intellect\r\nsaw the natural drift, and (not too bravely perhaps, through fear\r\nof “political” consequences) sought to guide it definitely in the\r\ndirection indicated by history.\r\n\r\nIf there were greater courage and clearer thought, together with the\r\nfreedom within which thought and courage could act, such communities,\r\ninstead of being, as they now are, only economic and social units of\r\nthe national life, could also become the recognised political units of\r\nthat life. In other words, they could become stateships awaiting their\r\nfinal integration into a State that would equally be a translation\r\ninto modern conditions of the old Irish State. Though they are social\r\nunits their social life is stagnant, because (again for what are called\r\n“political” reasons) those who control their guidance are afraid to\r\nguide it into the only cultural life any nation can know and within\r\nwhich can find liberty: its own. Were the enthusiasm of the Gaelic\r\nLeague--that is to say, the national enthusiasm--linked to the economic\r\nlife of such communities, were Irish music, Irish dance, Irish history\r\nand Irish tale-telling provided in its halls of a winter’s evening,\r\nthe flowing together of both streams would make these communities,\r\nnot only stateships, but centres of national life as they were in\r\nthe days of old. They would maintain their own musicians and their\r\nown historians and professors, would vie with one another in their\r\nexcellence and exchange them with one another. They would maintain\r\ntheir own physicians as the older stateships did. They would elect\r\ntheir own administrative heads, and, under their presidency, would meet\r\nin their own assemblies to order and control, not only their business\r\ntransactions, but all the life contained within them. In their own\r\narbitration courts they could control all their internal litigation,\r\nand compel recognition of the findings of such courts by the force of\r\nthe whole community as the old stateships did.\r\n\r\nTo such a point has the national resurrection come in the awakening of\r\nits distinctive State, that these things could be brought to pass by\r\nthe smallest manipulation and arrangement. Yet in the early centuries\r\ntheir completion and organisation required the function of a State with\r\nits central authority. Not only did the parts make the State but the\r\nState also made the parts. Each acted together, and flowed together.\r\nSo it will be again; and the Nation has come to a point when it only\r\nawaits its State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. AT THE GATES OF THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is one thing sure for the future of an Ireland free to\r\ndevelop its own State it is this, that one by one the moulds shaped\r\nby England for its governance will be thrown back into the cauldron\r\nand new moulds made to accord with the Nation’s own sense of wisdom\r\nand economy. Urban Councils, District Councils, Poor Law Guardians,\r\nand County Councils, all that they are and all that they represent are\r\ndestined for the cauldron in the forms in which they at present are\r\nknown. The whole English political configuration of Ireland is destined\r\nto rejection (it never really existed otherwise than in a partial\r\nstate of rejection) simply because it expresses little that is real in\r\nthe life of the people. No organisation is good or bad in itself as a\r\nscheme; it is only good or bad in the degree in which it does, or does\r\nnot, effectively and economically organise a flexible life for some\r\ndefinite end which it has to serve. In fact, the better it is the less\r\nwill it be in evidence as a thing in itself, apart from the elements\r\ncomprising it. The old Irish State was a good organisation, because\r\nit is almost impossible to think of it apart from the life which it\r\ncontained and conveyed, so nearly identical were the two things. The\r\nstateships were the people and the people were the stateships; and\r\nthat is why the conqueror found plantations necessary; for it was\r\nimpossible to break one without removing the other. The modern state\r\nof Ireland is not, in that sense, an organisation at all; it is simply\r\na configuration imposed upon its life, not fitting that life at all,\r\nneither expressing, containing nor conveying that life, and therefore\r\nused or abused by it according as occasion offers.\r\n\r\nEven the very counties, those results of the breaking up of the\r\nstateships and the making of English shire-lands, are unreal things\r\nthat express little of the life of the people. Their long continuance\r\nhas made them familiar, and so has given them a fictitious reality;\r\nbut they again are a configuration and not an organisation. They may\r\npersist for awhile with that fictitious life, chiefly because they have\r\nbecome themes of local partisanship; but in the degree in which the\r\nNation sets about to displace its configuration by a real organisation,\r\nthey must inevitably pass into a historical memory, and not a very\r\npleasing historical memory at that.\r\n\r\nEverything that has been introduced by England into Ireland is destined\r\nto rejection, and not as a matter of prejudice, but as an inevitable\r\nfact in statesmanship. Suits cut for other people, or demanded by other\r\npeople’s necessities, are the proper wear for clowns. At best these\r\nthings were wrung as concessions given with poor grace after long and\r\nbitter war; at worst they were anticipations of further war and the\r\nspontaneous creation of an alien thought. The first was better than the\r\nsecond because it did spring from the initiative of the people, and\r\npartially and ineffectually answered that demand, while the second\r\nsprang from the same alien intention that has created three centuries\r\nof almost unremitting warfare. And whether that intention stalk as an\r\nundisguised foe, or prank about with the antics of a philanthropist,\r\nthe result in statesmanship is the same. Instead of effecting an\r\norganisation it creates a configuration; instead of producing human\r\ncontentment, comfort and ease it produces irritation, exasperation\r\nand enmity; instead of being as flexible as the life it contains it\r\nis as rigid as the thought that made it; instead of being capable of\r\ndevelopment it is only capable of being broken or abused; instead of\r\nbeing a National State it is a national despair and futility. Therefore\r\nstatesmanship must neglect its achievements (though continuity of\r\ngovernment may compel their continuance for awhile) and must make a\r\ndirect approach to the national life, and its needs and necessities,\r\nhuman and economic, in order to build again, however slowly to build,\r\nfrom the foundations the structure that those foundations decree and\r\nsuggest.\r\n\r\nIt is in the discovery of those foundations that history becomes a\r\nmatter of first importance. Not a portion of that history; not the\r\nhistory of the eighteenth century, which did not express the life of\r\nthe people but the life of a small colony the proportion of which to\r\nthe whole is even smaller now than it was then, besides being under the\r\ninfluence of the awakening of the nineteenth century; but the whole of\r\nthat history, from the beginnings to the present, for in Irish history\r\nprobably more than in any other the end is in the beginning and the\r\nbeginning in the end. That we have already seen. We have seen, first,\r\nthe National State as it existed, and we saw that it was indeed a\r\nNational State although it was not finally centralised before it was\r\nassaulted. We have seen the assault that suspended its completion, and\r\nwe saw that that assault meant for some centuries the war of a State\r\nagainst a State, a Polity against a Polity, a foreign and alien polity\r\nseeking to break and displace the polity of the Nation. We have seen\r\nthat polity broken and displaced, and we saw the ideas that went to\r\nthe building of that polity lying resident in the people and creating\r\na continual warfare with the alien polity that had been imposed upon\r\nthe country from without. We have seen that those ideas maintained the\r\nwarfare unceasingly, it being the first principle of life to find an\r\noutlet for the ideas of the mind and the impulses of the blood, and to\r\nwar for them when they are thwarted; and we saw that warfare successful\r\nin winning back much of what had been lost, and especially winning\r\nback the land on which the old polity had been based. We have seen\r\nthose ideas breaking out in some remarkable acts reminiscent of the old\r\nprocess of law; and we saw that when some scheme was advocated to the\r\npeople that could be worked independently of the alien polity it was\r\ntaken and bent into the form of the stateships in which the old polity\r\nhad been expressed. In a word, we have seen the end in the beginning,\r\nand the beginning in the end, with a persistent continuity throughout.\r\nThe question is, how may that continuity be carried forward, and some\r\nState be devised that shall express the National intuition and desire,\r\nand be the old State re-born into modern conditions while perfectly\r\nfitting and conveying the requirements of a new and intricate life?\r\n\r\nManifestly in the first place the incompleted work of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, where the nation clearly asserted its desire, must be brought\r\nas speedily as possible to an end. That is to say, Land Purchase\r\nmust be completed. This is necessary for several reasons, all of\r\nwhich vitally affect each part of the country, since nations are not\r\ntissues of separate interests, nor even an entanglement of separate\r\ninterests, but co-ordinated wholes. It is economically necessary.\r\nIndustrial centres, such as Belfast, depend for their enterprise on\r\ncapital accumulated, not primarily from their own reserves, but from\r\nother sources. In Ireland those other sources are mainly derived from\r\nfarmers’ deposits. The sooner, therefore, farmers can be relieved from\r\nthe uneconomical drain on their industry known as rent the sooner\r\nwill they be able to accumulate balances that will be available for\r\nindustrial enterprise. Sound economy suggests that the main source of\r\na nation’s wealth, its land, should be freed from the burden of rents,\r\nespecially as these rents are usually spent to the advantage of other\r\ncountries. It is also politically necessary. It is not at all likely\r\nthat an agitation that convulsed the nineteenth century will die away\r\nwith its work incompleted; and no nation can afford to let its path\r\nbe encumbered by a continual agitation the justice of which has been\r\nadmitted. The necessity in statesmanship follows closely upon this.\r\nThe nation has clearly indicated that, just as the old State was built\r\non the free possession of the land, so must the new State be built.\r\nIt being the task of statesmanship to give expression to the desires\r\nof a nation while preserving the unity and balance of the whole, this\r\nparticular desire must be satisfied, and built into the Polity, if the\r\nwork of statesmanship is not to fall into ruin in its hands.\r\n\r\nYet in order that Land Purchase should be completed the Nation must be\r\nfinancially free, without burdens placed upon it by any considerations\r\noutside its shores. Needless to say, Land Purchase under an Irish State\r\nwill be a different matter from the same purchase as devised by foreign\r\ngovernments. The Nation will pay a single-minded attention to its own\r\ninterests. Its good faith will be an essential part of those interests;\r\nbut it will not be easily embarrassed by fictitious prices and delaying\r\nmethods to inflate values. Nevertheless, much of the world’s wealth\r\nhaving somehow escaped in gas and shell-splinters, and Ireland being\r\nas the result of long oppression a poor nation, the completion of Land\r\nPurchase will require a nation absolutely unencumbered by any other\r\ndemands on its wealth than the demand of its own problems.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, before any building can proceed its foundation must\r\nbe assured, the foundation being the same as preceded the building in\r\nthe old State. That building, it will be remembered, was not possible,\r\nand the State could not be said to have begun, till there was a\r\ncentral authority strong enough to make the parts out of earlier, more\r\nindependent units, and frame them into a national whole. That central\r\nauthority will again be necessary; and in asking the question, of what\r\nsort shall it be, it will be well to suppose nothing but to begin from\r\nthe beginnings.\r\n\r\nNever in the history of the Irish Nation (if we except the Parliament\r\nof 1689, which was framed on earlier models drawn from other than Irish\r\nsources) has any body ever sat at all similar to a modern Parliament.\r\nIn the old Irish State the elected monarch convened great councils\r\ncharged with special functions and duties. There was a council of\r\nbrehons, a council of administrative rulers, a council of historians,\r\nor public recorders, and a council of poets--all of them public\r\nofficials, with their parts to play in their various stateships. Each\r\ncouncil decided in its own affairs, and where necessary, for instance\r\nas between rulers and brehons, or brehons and recorders, the monarch\r\nwrought harmony between their decisions for the smooth working of the\r\nState. But that is not to say that, if the Nation had been left free\r\nto develop and augment its own polity, something in the nature of an\r\nassembly drawn from popular sources would not have been found necessary\r\nto assist or displace the monarch and his personal council. Had it\r\nbeen possible to create such an assembly early a central stability\r\nwould have existed, drawn from all the parts of the State and therefore\r\nholding all the parts together, that would have provided the State\r\nwith just that central authority that it needed. However that be,\r\nparliaments, or assemblies of popular representatives, have become an\r\nessential part of the modern mind, as providers and correctives of a\r\ncentral government. They have proved to be corrupt servers of special\r\ninterests; but that is because they have been too much trusted without\r\nsupplementing them with councils each representing its own interest,\r\nas the monarch in the Irish State supplemented his executive authority\r\nwith councils each having power, subject to the national unity of\r\nadministration, over its special concerns.\r\n\r\nNo student of the recent action of parliaments is at all likely to\r\nbe weighed to the earth by his overpowering admiration for them as\r\neffective instruments for the will of peoples. They are, it is true,\r\nthe displacement of one kind of arbitrary power by another kind of\r\narbitrary power. They are, in the form in which we best know them, the\r\nsubstitution of a king and his chosen advisers by a government and\r\nan assembly of popular representatives to which it is responsible.\r\nAccepting that substitution as the central authority by which a State\r\nmay be created, is it possible to carry into the change the spirit\r\nof the old State? The answer to that question is that the spirit\r\nof the old State not only may be so conveyed, but that it actually\r\ncorrects, in great measure, the modern weakness of parliaments, by\r\nbringing them into closer relation with the differing and special\r\ninterests of the Nation. The translation of the old State, that now\r\nlives in the intuitions and expectations of the Nation, into the\r\nmodern conditions that are now part of the Nation’s surface-thinking,\r\ncorrects the weakness of modern ideas while providing just the kind of\r\ncentralisation that the old State lacked.\r\n\r\nThe essential part of the working of the old State was clearly the\r\nconvocation of its great councils. While these met at regular periods\r\nthe State continued its central function, and existed as a whole. When\r\nthey were discontinued, as they sometimes were, the State fell into\r\ndisarray, and existed only in its parts. Now in modern times, as it so\r\nhappens, Irishmen meeting in their own concerns and acting at their own\r\ninitiative created just such another council. The work of the Recess\r\nCommittee resulted in the formation of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nthe working of which was intended to lie at the instance and in the\r\npower of a Council of Farmers elected through the country to manage\r\ntheir own concerns. Perhaps no better instance could be given of the\r\ntragic futility of trying to work the conceptions of one Polity through\r\nthe conditions of its alien rival. For the President of the Council\r\nbecame Minister of an alien bureaucratic government. He took his orders\r\nfrom that government, even though every farmer in Ireland was outraged\r\nby the effect of those orders. He took his salary from that government,\r\nand existed at the will of that government, with the result that the\r\nCouncil that was supposed to express and control the interest of\r\nfarming in Ireland was itself controlled by the interests of farmers in\r\nsomebody else’s country, and so was brought to a nullity. Moreover,\r\nwhile the farmers met in council to study their exclusive interests\r\ntheir President openly expressed his intention to study the interests\r\nof traders, even when the two interests were opposed to one another;\r\nand as the Council of Farmers had no means of enforcing its will, and\r\nno court to which to appeal, it fell into decay, and by neglect came in\r\nthe end to be largely an echo of its President’s will.\r\n\r\nYet, though the Department of Agriculture is an eloquent example of how\r\nthings ought not to be done, it does in fact contain a striking idea,\r\nevolved by consultation of Irishmen on Irish soil, that carries the\r\nconception of the old Irish State. If an Irish Assembly, or Parliament,\r\nwere surrounded by a number of such councils, representing each of the\r\nspecial interests or concerns of the Nation, the elder State would be\r\ntranslated into modern conditions and transfigure those conditions by\r\ndrawing the arbitrary and purely theoretical business of parliaments\r\ninto a definite relation to the life of a nation. Instead of the\r\nmonarch and his court would appear a government and the representative\r\nassembly from which it is drawn and to which it is responsible. Instead\r\nof three or four special councils representing the comparatively simple\r\ntexture of the life in the first millenium would appear a number\r\nof such special councils representing the proportionately greater\r\ncomplexity of the life of to-day. And just as in the old State each\r\ncouncil held authority in its own concerns leaving to the monarch the\r\nco-ordination of the whole, so the modern councils would each rule\r\ntheir own affairs subject to the control of the assembly of the Nation.\r\n\r\nThere would thus be two different kinds of representation gathered\r\ntogether. There would be the direct representation of the Nation, and\r\nthere would be the representation of the special interests the union\r\nand pattern of which create the national life. Both would meet in the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe councils would include every sort of interest, but they would not\r\nbe of equal size or of the same formation. Both size and formation\r\nwould correspond to the internal requirements of each interest, or\r\nconcern. Those representing Farming and Labour, for instance, would\r\nnecessarily be large, not only because of the size of the interests\r\nthey would represent, but also because the nature of those interests\r\nwould demand a wide expression of opinion. Those representing Law,\r\nCapital and Education would be smaller, because of the narrower and\r\nmore special nature of their interests. Those representing the Army and\r\nNaval Defence would not only be smaller yet, but would necessarily be\r\nformed in other ways. Each council would be formed by the direct vote\r\nof all those in the country engaged in that branch of work. The Council\r\nof Local Administration would naturally consist of the elected heads\r\nof stateships, and would thus exactly correspond to the Council of\r\nRulers in the old State. But the Council of the Army, Naval Defence and\r\nthe Police would either consist of heads of departments, by promotion\r\nor appointment, or partly of such heads and partly of men chosen by\r\nthe direct vote of officers and rank and file. The details, for the\r\nmoment, are immaterial. They would require closer attention at the\r\nmoment of creation. The main matter is that each council would control\r\nits own affairs by the direct representation of all the people in the\r\ncountry engaged in its practical conduct. And these special interests\r\nwould meet the direct representation of the Nation by Assembly in the\r\nGovernment of the day.\r\n\r\nThe Government would, by necessity, depending as it would on the will\r\nof the Assembly, be found from and always be responsible to that\r\nAssembly. That is to say, the largest party, or combination of parties,\r\njust as in the present clumsy theory of government, would create\r\nthe Government of the day. But the Ministers of Government would be\r\npresidents of various councils, and would reflect their desire. Instead\r\nof evolving theories from consultation with the permanent officials\r\nof departments, as happens in England and most other countries, they\r\nwould be directly in touch with the interests over whose destinies\r\nthey preside, and their attention would be occupied with the immediate\r\npractical questions raised from time to time. If some scheme suggested\r\nitself to them as desirable they would first have to win the consent\r\nand approval of their respective councils before coming to the Assembly\r\nwith them; and when they came, they would come not only as Ministers of\r\nthe Government but as spokesmen of their councils. Thus the clumsiness\r\nand constant injustice of majority government would continually be\r\nrefined by contact with living issues. Within the body of the existing\r\nlaw each special interest would be the arbiter of its own affairs.\r\nWhen fresh legislation became necessary by changed conditions, or\r\nthrough other causes, its council would discuss it, formulate it, and\r\nbe responsible through its president for the initiative of bringing it\r\nbefore the Assembly of the Nation.\r\n\r\nA system such as this, as has been said, would bring into joint\r\noperation two kinds of representation: the representation of special\r\ninterests and the representation of the whole people. Clearly they\r\nwould require a solvent and a corrective. New legislation might be\r\ninitiated by a council and be considerably altered by the Assembly.\r\nThis would naturally only be the case in extreme cases, for the will\r\nof such councils would naturally have a far higher authority than the\r\nsole will of one man in consultation with permanent officials. Yet\r\nthe contingency would have to be provided for. For the council might\r\nreject the amended form of its wish, as it would have the right to do.\r\nOr the Assembly might reject the suggestion altogether, or compel its\r\nwithdrawal, with the result that the initiative might be repeated.\r\nVery properly the final decision would rest with the Assembly, for it\r\nwould be responsible not to special interests, but to the whole Nation.\r\nYet the councils would equally require some further court to which to\r\nappeal on the argument that no Assembly at all times and in all cases\r\nrepresents a nation’s will, however frequently it be elected. They\r\nwould therefore demand some court in which they themselves had a direct\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThis could be created by a Senate half as large as the Assembly. A\r\nthird of the Senate could be created by large electoral areas, say the\r\nprovinces, voting by proportional representation. By that method men\r\nwould be chosen who commanded general respect but did not wear a party\r\ncolour or control a local following pronounced enough to win favour\r\nat the hustings, and who, on the other hand, could not be said to\r\nrepresent any special interest. But two-thirds of the Senate would be\r\nchosen in equal proportions by the various councils acting as electoral\r\ncolleges. Electoral colleges, that act simply and only as electoral\r\ncolleges, as in America, have generally proved to be failures. They\r\ndilute the popular will to no particular purpose, and lend themselves\r\nto intrigue. But the councils would not be primarily elected as\r\nelectoral colleges. They would be elected to control and direct their\r\nown special interests. Only in a secondary capacity would they act as\r\nelectoral colleges. Nor would their appointments to the Senate have\r\nthe right to sit both in the Councils and in the Senate. Men or women\r\nchosen for the Senate by the various councils would sit and act only in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nLegislation initiated in the Assembly would proceed automatically to\r\nthe Senate, before which body, if a council felt aggrieved, its case\r\nwould be argued by its representatives. If Assembly and Senate agreed\r\nno further could be said in the matter. If they disagreed, after a\r\ngiven length of time (during which time the subject of dispute would\r\nbe laid aside) both Assembly and Senate would sit, debate and vote on\r\nthe matter as one body, and the decision so taken would be final during\r\nthe life of that Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that a system such as this reflects the spirit of the\r\nold Irish State as translated into modern conditions, answering at\r\none time the instincts that have persisted in the Nation and the\r\nsurface-thinking it has since acquired. It gives no undue obeisance to\r\nthe modern invention of parliaments, but draws the Government created\r\nby an Assembly of Representatives into definite relation with the\r\ninterests it is supposed to study while making those interests the\r\ndeciders of their own affairs within the limits of national agreement.\r\nIt could not help but reflect the instincts and thoughts of the\r\nNation. Being brought so closely into touch with its life it would at\r\nonce react to the changes of that life. Yet the stability and central\r\nfunction of government would be assured. The utmost liberty would be\r\ngiven to the parts while ensuring the central action of the whole, as\r\nthe limbs of the body have an independent liberty while obeying the\r\nrhythm created and disciplined by the mind.\r\n\r\nCertain parts of government belong so essentially to the business of\r\nthe whole that they would not come under the review of any special\r\ncouncil. The Minister, or Ministers, in charge of these would be\r\nresponsible to none but the Nation, for they would directly concern the\r\nNation as a whole and not in any one of its parts. The chief of these\r\nof course is finance. The only council which the Minister of Finance\r\ncould consult or advise would be the Assembly of Representatives, as\r\ndrawn directly, well or ill, from the people’s choice. All direct\r\nmoney arrangements, such as taxes, the creation of debt or credit,\r\nthe purchase of properties or monopolies, and so forth, would lie in\r\nhis care, would arise at his initiative and would be solved by the\r\nAssembly. The Senate could claim the right to debate any such measure,\r\nand to suggest alterations, but whether the Assembly accepted or\r\nrejected these alterations would lie at its own discretion.\r\n\r\nThere would be other matters of the same nature. The creation of\r\nnew forms or units of government, for example, or changes in the\r\nconstitution, where rendered necessary by changing conditions, or\r\nany matter outside the range of the councils, or transcending their\r\ncapacity, or any new legislation at the initiative of one council that\r\nwould demand some independent measure to bring it into co-ordination\r\nwith the working of some other council, would all be of this kind, and\r\nwould lie at the initiative of the Chief Minister of State, who would\r\nbe responsible for the State to its elected President and would be\r\nchosen by him to create the Ministry.\r\n\r\nSuch business would naturally be more frequent at the beginning of\r\nthe working of the State than when it was in complete movement.\r\nFor example, the first work of the State would inevitably be the\r\nre-creation of its local government in order to bring it into\r\nconformity with practical necessities on the lines of the stateships\r\nof the old State. Nothing more unwieldy and uneconomical than the\r\npresent system, or lack of system, could very well have been devised.\r\nIt is a patchwork quilt of foreign ideas, that express no realities in\r\nIreland, that are alternately the theme of the mirth and the tears,\r\nbut always the derision, of Irishmen, and that even in the country of\r\ntheir invention have not proved to be a conspicuous success. Urban\r\nCouncils, District Councils, Poor Law Guardians, Town Commissioners\r\nand County Councils all have their independent lives without being\r\nfitted in as parts of a co-related whole. Seen in contrast with the\r\ncompactness and completeness of the old stateships nothing could seem\r\nmore haphazard and accidental. So long as they exist, as they now do,\r\nit will be impossible to speak of an Irish State, for a State does not\r\nexist only by reason of the larger, more central forms of government,\r\nbut in the degree in which those larger forms are drawn into relation\r\nwith smaller and local units of government. They neither correspond\r\nto any efficiency in the State nor to any efficiency in relation to\r\ntheir own needs. They divide up a given area into a number of separate\r\nand even opposed units, whereas the life of that area is generally\r\nitself a unit, however variously its activities may be expressed. A\r\nsmall township and the country lying about it, for example, can only\r\nartificially be broken up into two units, one the town and the other\r\nthe country, for their life is woven of one piece. Even the industries\r\nof the towns depend on the country lying round about. Any weakening of\r\nthe whole weakens each one of its parts, and the whole is weakened by\r\nbeing broken into irresponsible parts. For the life of the whole exists\r\nas a community not as a patchwork.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the present councils are neither large enough nor small\r\nenough for efficiency. A very small council would create great rivalry\r\nin its election and would cause a fierce light to beat on all its\r\nactions. Under such circumstances corruption would be difficult.\r\nBut a council of this sort would not be representative of the life\r\nit governed. A large council, on the other hand, would have its own\r\nkind of efficiency, and would be representative of all the life\r\nit expressed. It would naturally have to create its officers of\r\ngovernment, from whom it could withdraw the power it gave when they\r\nceased to express its will. Expressing itself by way of debate it\r\nwould create an interest in local government, and a feeling of general\r\nresponsibility, that cannot now be said to exist. The subjects debated\r\nin the local Assembly would be discussed by the hearthside; the life\r\nof the people would be quickened; and they would not reserve all their\r\nthought for the larger national questions, but would expend it also\r\non their immediate local interests. Thus again corruption would be\r\nmade difficult. A field would be offered for the discussion of new\r\nideas of local government, local improvement or trade economy and\r\nefficiency, whereas at the present moment local councils are sealed\r\nchambers that by their construction can never admit fresh air and are\r\nthe natural breeding places for corruption. It is easy, and just, to\r\ncensure corruption in these local bodies, but it is yet more necessary\r\nto see that their constitution simply invites corruption, just as it\r\ninvites their capture by one or two interests that rule them to the\r\nexclusion of all other interests. Not only because they purport to\r\nrepresent unreal and arbitrarily distinguished parts of a life that is\r\na fellowship (without even doing that much well), but also because of\r\ntheir very form and constitution, such bodies have reduced the local\r\nlife of Ireland to a tangle of conflicting and corrupt interests.\r\n\r\nThese two criticisms suggest an obvious remedy. The first need is\r\nto restore the life of the community, in a fellowship of town and\r\ncountry, urban and rural, within a given area. The second need is\r\nto let that community express its life, and assume control of all\r\nits local affairs, in a legislative assembly of not less than fifty\r\nand not more than a hundred. The satisfaction of these two needs\r\nsuggests difficulties that are incidental to each of them in turn as\r\nnew enterprises in statesmanship. Fortunately, as we are following a\r\nhistorical continuity in the life of a Nation, answers are suggested\r\nto both of these difficulties out of the old State, and only require\r\nadaptation and re-framing to make them suit modern conditions.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty is to find the natural area within which the\r\nlife of a community would be comprised. Here, manifestly, the past\r\nwould supply a very helpful answer, if it could be found. The area\r\ncomprised by the old stateships would naturally finally be decreed\r\nby their internal needs and their external play and interplay upon\r\none another--that is to say, partly by certain obvious geographical\r\nnecessities and partly by economic conditions. Rivers, lakes, mountain\r\nranges and the sea would impose natural boundaries; and equal\r\naccessibility to both mountain pasture and tillage, or alternatively\r\ndifferent stateships taking up different kinds of life, would suggest\r\nother boundaries. These things can in many cases be traced in the\r\nboundaries of the old stateships where they are discoverable--as in\r\nmany cases they are. Clearly since then the life of the people has\r\nchanged in many ways, and the statesman thinking of modern conditions\r\nwould find other boundaries naturally suggested to him. The transition\r\nfrom the modern artificial limits of local life to the proper\r\ncommunities, or fellowships, of the future would not be easy. Yet if\r\ncertain boundaries, drawn from a comparison of the old stateships with\r\nthe new requirements, were decreed, subsequent experience would soon\r\nsuggest a revision of working areas where these were found necessary.\r\nAt the present time these areas in many cases have already been found\r\nin great measure by the co-operative societies that have created\r\npetty stateships of their own. Such societies have been grouped round\r\nan economic idea that, embodying as it does the sense of unity and\r\nfellowship about which the new communities would be grouped, would\r\nprobably be adopted in some form by the stateships of the future;\r\nbut that would be for themselves to decide by debate in assembly.\r\nAnd when it is remembered that some of these societies have already\r\nundertaken from the power used for their factories to supply light to\r\nneighbouring townships it is obvious that a larger relation for the\r\nlife of a stateship is at once indicated.\r\n\r\nClearly the past is equally full of suggestion in answering the second\r\ndifficulty. To ask, what officers would the assemblies of the new\r\nstateships create for the conduct of its government, is at once to\r\nthink of the past. In the degree in which the life of these stateships\r\nbecame more various its officers, or ministers, would become more\r\nnumerous, while if it remained simple they would be few. The first\r\nwould be the President of the Assembly, who would take his place in the\r\nCouncil of Local Administration. The stateship would take control of\r\nits own internal litigation under its own law officer, and the lawyers\r\nbeneath him would not merely be advocates in criminal actions, but\r\nwould serve as arbitrators in actions for tort. It would have its own\r\nFinance Minister, its own Minister of Public Health, and if necessary\r\nits own ministers of trade and agriculture, for local life in these\r\nquestions will not remain as stagnant as it is now, especially in the\r\nwider areas that the stateships would include. Such ministers would\r\nhold their power from the Assembly, and could work with committees\r\nappointed by the Assembly. Offices, such as that of the recorder,\r\nthe surveyor, the doctors and the nurses would be filled by public\r\nexamination, but the actions of those who filled them would come\r\nunder the departments of government under the constant review of the\r\nAssembly, which could terminate appointments at its will.\r\n\r\nStateships such as these would be the recognised units of the State.\r\nThat is to say, they would be political units, and would thus be the\r\nconstituencies for the return of one or more members, according to\r\npopulation, to the Assembly of the Nation. From them that Assembly\r\nwould be constituted, just as the Councils would each be constituted\r\nby the vote of all those in the Nation engaged in its own branch of\r\nthe national life. They would also be economic units, both for raising\r\nand expending its own local taxation and for meeting the levies of the\r\nState. Some of those levies would be for moneys now chargeable at the\r\ndiscretion of local bodies. Any wise State will at once take within its\r\nown control all the main arteries of communication through the country,\r\nsuch as railways, canals and roads. It could re-imburse itself for the\r\nmaintenance of some or all of these by levies on the stateships through\r\nwhich they pass; and the amount of these levies could come under the\r\nreview of the Council of Local Administration before being passed to\r\nthe decision of the Assembly of the Nation.\r\n\r\nCity Corporations are already such stateships, though with a more\r\ncompact life. As such they would remain; and the different nature of\r\ntheir life would require corresponding changes in their constitution.\r\nThey would necessarily have to keep the same control that they now\r\npossess. For instance, they now bear the responsibility for their own\r\nstreets and roadways; and so it would remain; for their roads are\r\nnot arteries of the country, intersecting many stateships, but only\r\narteries of themselves intersecting themselves. So, in most matters\r\ncorporations, having already become stateships, would remain as they\r\nnow are. The only change they would require to bring them into line\r\nwith their fellow stateships would be that their councils would need\r\nto be enlarged. In most cases this enlargement would not need to be\r\nconsiderable, for it is extremely probable that in the course of time\r\nthe country stateships would outrival the city stateships in wealth,\r\nresponsibility and the size of their respective corporate undertakings.\r\nThus alone can the life of the country maintain its own against the\r\nlife of the cities.\r\n\r\nThis corporate wealth and responsibility of the country stateships\r\nwould be the greater, and they would better preserve their social and\r\neconomic unity, if they decided to use the wealth of the whole for the\r\nequal advantage of each of their members, regarding themselves, as\r\nthe old stateships apparently did in the fifteenth century, as great\r\ntrading units for export. That is to say, their members would not, if\r\nthey constituted themselves in this form, trade upon one another in an\r\nuneconomical and wasteful warfare; they would create great communal\r\nstores under the control of their assemblies, they would purchase\r\nall their materials, domestic, farming and industrial, at the lowest\r\npossible cost by the purchasing power of the whole stateship, and\r\nthey would bend all their efforts, together with the other stateships\r\nunder the Council of Trade, to capturing the markets of the world for\r\ntheir produce. Competition, instead of being a destructive element\r\nwithin the State, would become a fighting quality of the State itself\r\nin its rivalry with other States, every man’s effort within the Nation\r\nbeing bent to this end. The technical education of the schools, in\r\nthe application of the highest science to the Nation’s business,\r\nwould be drafted to this end under the control of the State and the\r\nadministration of the stateships.\r\n\r\nNor would the life of culture be neglected. The stateship so\r\nconstituted would employ, for example, its own chemist, not only for\r\nits technical work, but for lectures. So would it also employ its own\r\nhistorian and its own body of musicians. For when men are relieved\r\nfrom the necessity of competition among themselves, and realise the\r\ndignity of a life fellowship, they realise also the other dignities and\r\nbeauties of life. The finer flowers of life cannot bloom over a soil\r\nchoked by mutual rapacity, but when the soil is cleared by a cleaner\r\nand more economical order those flowers, being a purer output of the\r\nspirit of man, would find their natural life possible again. The old\r\nstateships are the best indication of this. Men were neither more nor\r\nless naturally corrupt then than they are now. Yet they were proud of\r\ntheir poets; they esteemed the possession of a poet whose fame was wide\r\nto be a high honour; poets coming from other stateships were received\r\nwith distinction and hospitality; and when in the Contention of the\r\nBards in the seventeenth century poets all over the country conducted\r\na controversy, it was not only they who rivalled one another, but the\r\nstateships whom they represented who were pitted against one another.\r\nThat was when the stranger was warring through the land, and if such a\r\ncondition did not still the Nation’s culture, how much purer would be\r\nthe opportunity if a State order created a condition of life in which\r\nthe human desire for rivalry became the asset of a community instead of\r\nthe destruction of a community? It is the first function of a State to\r\ncreate such an order; but in the case of Ireland that order lies ready\r\nto her hand in her past Statehood that only requires to be adapted to\r\nthe needs and necessities of her new life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. APPROACHING PROBLEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this little book has been to examine the working of the\r\nold Irish State, to show how that State was affected by the attempt\r\nat military conquest, to see how, when that conquest succeeded in\r\noverthrowing the form of the State and uprooting it out of the soil,\r\nits memory persisted in the instincts and expectations of the Nation,\r\nand made all the uprisings of the Nation malleable to its ancient will,\r\nand finally to see how far those instincts could be translated into the\r\nnew conditions and experiences of the national life in a re-birth of\r\nthe old State. It is no part of its business to examine the problems\r\nthat will beset the future State of Ireland. It has a sufficiently\r\nhardy task to carry out, however inefficiently, its declared purpose\r\nwithout undertaking expeditions not proper to that purpose. Yet certain\r\nproblems lie within the automatic function of such a State, and some of\r\nthese may be briefly indicated.\r\n\r\nThere is, for example, the question of taxation. In most countries of\r\nlate movements have arisen demanding that taxation should be charged\r\nupon wealth and not upon the heads of the population. This has,\r\nnecessarily perhaps, taken the form of a class-war in these other\r\ncountries; but it is at bottom not a class question at all, but a\r\nquestion of a sound and a fairly obvious economic principle. A State\r\ncan only levy taxation in proportion to its wealth, and therefore\r\ncan only levy taxation upon that wealth, wherever that wealth be\r\nheld. To attempt to discover that wealth by a mere counting of heads\r\nis a procedure the falsity of which could be exposed by a class of\r\nschool-children. That means that any taxation by heads of population,\r\ndirect or indirect, however it be scaled, graded or disguised, is bad\r\nnational economy, and therefore bad national finance. How otherwise,\r\nthen, can taxation be levied? Here again the old State comes with a\r\nsuggestion. We have seen that, though there is no direct proof that\r\nthe system was completed, its taxation was levied on the stateships,\r\npresumably with some regard to their capacities. That taxation was\r\nredistributed by them in their own assemblies according to their local\r\ncircumstances. If that method were adopted again the State would derive\r\nits revenues from its stateships, and would levy it in proportion\r\nto their abilities. That proportion would at least be more easy to\r\nestimate in their case than in the case of individuals; whereas if the\r\nstateships became not merely economic units but trading units their\r\nbalance-sheets would at once reveal the proportion of their capacities,\r\nand the State would thus be enabled to charge its taxation directly\r\nupon its wealth in an equitable ratio.\r\n\r\nAt first the incidence of this system would be light, but it would\r\ngather importance with time. It is agreed that Ireland will need to\r\nprotect, and in some cases heavily protect, her young industries. But\r\nin the degree in which such protection succeeded in its intention it\r\nwould cease to be profitable from the point of view of taxation. Then\r\nthe Nation would need to claim a levy on the wealth it had created for\r\nitself, for the purposes of government and security.\r\n\r\nSuch a system would in great measure answer the question of the unused\r\nmineral resources of the country. These are, as is well-known, very\r\nconsiderable, and one of the first tasks of an Irish State would be\r\nto see that they were used--though it would be an equally important\r\ntask to see that they were not mined so that they rendered whole\r\ntracts of countryside foul and filthy as in other countries. Such\r\nmineral deposits in the soil of a country are part of the national\r\nwealth. Its State cannot grant monopolies of them to individuals or\r\ncompanies, especially in a country where the soil of old was held and\r\nof late was won back by its people. They would naturally, in such a\r\nState as has been outlined, be held and worked by the stateships in\r\nwhose territories they lay, under the direction of the State. But then\r\nthe question arises, what royalties would the State charge for the\r\nworking of what truly is the wealth of the whole Nation and not the\r\nsole possession of any of its stateships? And the answer is that if\r\ntaxation were levied on stateships according to their capacities this\r\nwould automatically adjust itself without the necessity of adopting any\r\ndirect device.\r\n\r\nThen there is the question of the promotion of industry. No State\r\ncan leave this to hazard. It must be made part of a disciplined\r\neffort. Nations must be made as far as is possible self-subsistent.\r\nNo government can stand idly by and say that its people are either\r\nnaturally industrial or agricultural, or declare piously that the whims\r\nand hazards of private enterprise are the workings of wisdom. Attitudes\r\nof this kind are the abrogation of all government. Governments, in the\r\ndegree in which they are governments, must set out to create what,\r\nafter careful thought, they conceive to be a living and liveable\r\nbalance of the activities of the national life, and to create it by\r\nand in an order that ensures dignity, decency and subsistence to all\r\nits people. The task may not be easy, but any neglect of it is treason\r\nto the State. In an Ireland organised by responsible stateships the\r\ntask would be simplified. Ireland possesses, possibly in as great a\r\nmeasure as any nation, what is known as White-Power. By harnessing the\r\nmanifold rivers that intersect her soil electricity can be directed to\r\neach of these stateships for their use in order that they might as\r\ncommunities create industries within their territories. It would be to\r\ntheir interest to do so, if only to keep their population within their\r\nfellowships, and to the general wealth of the fellowships, instead of\r\nletting them drift to the stateships of the cities. But the general\r\ndirection of such efforts would lie with the State, which would seek\r\nso to order things that there be in the national life a balance of all\r\nthe parts that are necessary to a self-subsistent and thriving nation.\r\nIreland would remain mainly agricultural, because of the richness of\r\nthe soil and because the neglect of agriculture is national suicide;\r\nbut she will cease to repeat the words of her enemies that her destiny\r\nis agricultural only. Her destiny is what she will make it by an\r\norganised and disciplined endeavour.\r\n\r\nFinally there is the question of the language. This does not truly lie\r\nwithin the scope of the book, but only because without it the book\r\nwould not be possible. Firstly, because it was in the language of the\r\nIrish Nation that the Irish State was created; secondly, because it\r\nwas only when the language was recovered as an intellectual possession\r\nand passion that the outlines of that State could be seen clearly, the\r\nmemories of which at that time were struggling in the acts and deeds\r\nof a resurgent people. We have been tracing a historical continuity,\r\nbut the key of that continuity is the language. The State of the\r\nfuture might be built on the foundations of the past, but the Nation\r\ninhabiting it would not be the same Nation if it spoke by the tongue\r\nof a foreigner; and then it is probable that the State would not\r\nfully answer its expectations, because the change of a nation’s speech\r\nimplies a weakening of its surety of intuition. The recovery of the\r\nlanguage in daily use is not a sentimentalism but a national necessity\r\nif the Nation is to act with the full certainty of its hereditary mind.\r\nIt is also necessary to its dignity among the nations--which also is\r\nnot merely an honourable emotion but actually an estimable quality in\r\ncommerce. Ireland will utter her State aright when she utters her own\r\nspeech aright, and when she does both other nations will look at her,\r\nthink separately of her and deal directly with her. Her dignity will\r\nbe a national beauty, and will aid her prosperity. For it is not when\r\na Nation is crowned that its dignity is completed, but when it speaks;\r\nand not when it lisps with a stranger’s tongue but when it speaks with\r\nits own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPADRAIC PEARSE\r\n\r\nCOLLECTED WORKS\r\n\r\n=Vol. I--PLAYS, POEMS AND STORIES.= Demy 8vo. 7s. 6d. net.\r\n\r\nHe was an out-and-out rebel ... a rebel who was a poet, a visionary who\r\nworked not for prosperity, or even for political freedom, but for an\r\nidea.--_Times Literary Supplement._\r\n\r\nProbably no more selfless spirit ever broke itself against the might\r\nof the Iron Age than this man’s spirit, which was lit up by love of\r\nchildren and country, a dreamer with his heart in the Golden Age.--_The\r\nIrish Homestead._\r\n\r\nThe publication ... of the literary works of the leaders of\r\nthe Irish Insurrection has helped us more than might have been\r\nexpected to understand the motives and hopes which lay behind their\r\naction.--_Westminister Gazette._\r\n\r\n=Vol. II--SONGS OF THE IRISH REBELS=, and Specimens from an Irish\r\nAnthology.
