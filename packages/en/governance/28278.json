To\r\nunderstand the new, which is our main purpose, we must first cast a\r\nglance at the old. We must understand what the social structure was,\r\nwhich--mainly, as I shall show, under the inspiration of Liberal\r\nideas--is slowly but surely giving place to the new fabric of the civic\r\nState. The older structure itself was by no means primitive. What is\r\ntruly primitive is very hard to say. But one thing is pretty clear. At\r\nall times men have lived in societies, and ties of kinship and of simple\r\nneighbourhood underlie every form of social organization. In the\r\nsimplest societies it seems probable that these ties--reinforced and\r\nextended, perhaps, by religious or other beliefs--are the only ones that\r\nseriously count. It is certain that of the warp of descent and the woof\r\nof intermarriage there is woven a tissue out of which small and rude but\r\nclose and compact communities are formed. But the ties of kinship and\r\nneighbourhood are effective only within narrow limits. While the local\r\ngroup, the clan, or the village community are often the centres of\r\nvigorous life, the larger aggregate of the Tribe seldom attains true\r\nsocial and political unity unless it rests upon a military organization.\r\nBut military organization may serve not only to hold one tribe together\r\nbut also to hold other tribes in subjection, and thereby, at the cost of\r\nmuch that is most valuable in primitive life, to establish a larger and\r\nat the same time a more orderly society. Such an order once established\r\ndoes not, indeed, rest on naked force. The rulers become invested with a\r\nsacrosanct authority. It may be that they are gods or descendants of\r\ngods. It may be that they are blessed and upheld by an independent\r\npriesthood. In either case the powers that be extend their sway not\r\nmerely over the bodies but over the minds of men. They are ordained of\r\nGod because they arrange the ordination. Such a government is not\r\nnecessarily abhorrent to the people nor indifferent to them. But it is\r\nessentially government from above. So far as it affects the life of the\r\npeople at all, it does so by imposing on them duties, as of military\r\nservice, tribute, ordinances, and even new laws, in such wise and on\r\nsuch principles as seem good to itself. It is not true, as a certain\r\nschool of jurisprudence held, that law is, as such, a command imposed by\r\na superior upon an inferior, and backed by the sanctions of punishment.\r\nBut though this is not true of law in general it is a roughly true\r\ndescription of law in that particular stage of society which we may\r\nconveniently describe as the Authoritarian.\r\n\r\nNow, in the greater part of the world and throughout the greater part of\r\nhistory the two forms of social organization that have been\r\ndistinguished are the only forms to be found. Of course, they themselves\r\nadmit of every possible variation of detail, but looking below these\r\nvariations we find the two recurrent types. On the one hand, there are\r\nthe small kinship groups, often vigorous enough in themselves, but\r\nfeeble for purposes of united action. On the other hand, there are\r\nlarger societies varying in extent and in degree of civilization from a\r\npetty negro kingdom to the Chinese Empire, resting on a certain union of\r\nmilitary force and religious or quasi-religious belief which, to select\r\na neutral name, we have called the principle of Authority. In the lower\r\nstages of civilization there appears, as a rule, to be only one method\r\nof suppressing the strife of hostile clans, maintaining the frontier\r\nagainst a common enemy, or establishing the elements of outward order.\r\nThe alternative to authoritarian rule is relapse into the comparative\r\nanarchy of savage life.\r\n\r\nBut another method made its appearance in classical antiquity. The city\r\nstate of ancient Greece and Italy was a new type of social organization.\r\nIt differed from the clan and the commune in several ways. In the first\r\nplace it contained many clans and villages, and perhaps owed its origin\r\nto the coming together of separate clans on the basis not of conquest\r\nbut of comparatively equal alliance. Though very small as compared with\r\nan ancient empire or a modern state it was much larger than a primitive\r\nkindred. Its life was more varied and complex. It allowed more free play\r\nto the individual, and, indeed, as it developed, it suppressed the old\r\nclan organization and substituted new divisions, geographical or other.\r\nIt was based, in fact, not on kinship as such, but on civic right, and\r\nthis it was which distinguished it not only from the commune, but from\r\nthe Oriental monarchy. The law which it recognized and by which it lived\r\nwas not a command imposed by a superior government on a subject mass. On\r\nthe contrary, government was itself subject to law, and law was the life\r\nof the state, willingly supported by the entire body of free citizens.\r\nIn this sense the city state was a community of free men. Considered\r\ncollectively its citizens owned no master. They governed themselves,\r\nsubject only to principles and rules of life descending from antiquity\r\nand owing their force to the spontaneous allegiance of successive\r\ngenerations. In such a community some of the problems that vex us most\r\npresented themselves in a very simple form. In particular the relation\r\nof the individual to the community was close, direct, and natural.\r\nTheir interests were obviously bound up together. Unless each man did\r\nhis duty the State might easily be destroyed and the population\r\nenslaved. Unless the State took thought for its citizens it might easily\r\ndecay. What was still more important, there was no opposition of church\r\nand state, no fissure between political and religious life, between the\r\nclaims of the secular and the spiritual, to distract the allegiance of\r\nthe citizens, and to set the authority of conscience against the duties\r\nof patriotism. It was no feat of the philosophical imagination, but a\r\nquite simple and natural expression of the facts to describe such a\r\ncommunity as an association of men for the purpose of living well.\r\nIdeals to which we win our way back with difficulty and doubt arose\r\nnaturally out of the conditions of life in ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this simple harmony had very serious limitations,\r\nwhich in the end involved the downfall of the city system. The\r\nresponsibilities and privileges of the associated life were based not on\r\nthe rights of human personality but on the rights of citizenship, and\r\ncitizenship was never co-extensive with the community. The population\r\nincluded slaves or serfs, and in many cities there were large classes\r\ndescended from the original conquered population, personally free but\r\nexcluded from the governing circle. Notwithstanding the relative\r\nsimplicity of social conditions the city was constantly torn by the\r\ndisputes of faction--in part probably a legacy from the old clan\r\norganization, in part a consequence of the growth of wealth and the\r\nnewer distinction of classes. The evil of faction was aggravated by the\r\nill-success of the city organization in dealing with the problem of\r\ninter-state relations. The Greek city clung to its autonomy, and though\r\nthe principle of federalism which might have solved the problem was\r\nultimately brought into play, it came too late in Greek history to save\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nThe constructive genius of Rome devised a different method of dealing\r\nwith the political problems involved in expanding relations. Roman\r\ncitizenship was extended till it included all Italy and, later on, till\r\nit comprised the whole free population of the Mediterranean basin. But\r\nthis extension was even more fatal to the free self-government of a city\r\nstate. The population of Italy could not meet in the Forum of Rome or\r\nthe Plain of Mars to elect consuls and pass laws, and the more wisely\r\nit was extended the less valuable for any political purpose did\r\ncitizenship become. The history of Rome, in fact, might be taken as a\r\nvast illustration of the difficulty of building up an extended empire on\r\nany basis but that of personal despotism resting on military force and\r\nmaintaining peace and order through the efficiency of the bureaucratic\r\nmachine. In this vast mechanism it was the army that was the seat of\r\npower, or rather it was each army at its post on some distant frontier\r\nthat was a potential seat of power. The \"secret of the empire\" that was\r\nearly divulged was that an emperor could be made elsewhere than at Rome,\r\nand though a certain sanctity remained to the person of the emperor, and\r\nlegists cherished a dim remembrance of the theory that he embodied the\r\npopular will, the fact was that he was the choice of a powerful army,\r\nratified by the God of Battles, and maintaining his power as long as he\r\ncould suppress any rival pretender. The break-up of the Empire through\r\nthe continual repetition of military strife was accelerated, not caused,\r\nby the presence of barbarism both within and without the frontiers. To\r\nrestore the elements of order a compromise between central and local\r\njurisdictions was necessary, and the vassal became a local prince owning\r\nan allegiance, more or less real as the case might be, to a distant\r\nsovereign. Meanwhile, with the prevailing disorder the mass of the\r\npopulation in Western Europe lost its freedom, partly through conquest,\r\npartly through the necessity of finding a protector in troublous times.\r\nThe social structure of the Middle Ages accordingly assumed the\r\nhierarchical form which we speak of as the Feudal system. In this\r\nthorough-going application of the principle of authority every man, in\r\ntheory, had his master. The serf held of his lord, who held of a great\r\nseigneur, who held of the king. The king in the completer theory held of\r\nthe emperor who was crowned by the Pope, who held of St. Peter. The\r\nchain of descent was complete from the Ruler of the universe to the\r\nhumblest of the serfs.[1] But within this order the growth of industry\r\nand commerce raised up new centres of freedom. The towns in which men\r\nwere learning anew the lessons of association for united defence and the\r\nregulation of common interests, obtained charters of rights from\r\nseigneur or king, and on the Continent even succeeded in establishing\r\ncomplete independence. Even in England, where from the Conquest the\r\ncentral power was at its strongest, the corporate towns became for many\r\npurposes self-governing communities. The city state was born again, and\r\nwith it came an outburst of activity, the revival of literature and the\r\narts, the rediscovery of ancient learning, the rebirth of philosophy and\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe mediæval city state was superior to the ancient in that slavery was\r\nno essential element in its existence. On the contrary, by welcoming the\r\nfugitive serf and vindicating his freedom it contributed powerfully to\r\nthe decline of the milder form of servitude. But like the ancient state\r\nit was seriously and permanently weakened by internal faction, and like\r\nthe ancient state it rested the privileges of its members not on the\r\nrights of human personality, but on the responsibilities of citizenship.\r\nIt knew not so much liberty as \"liberties,\" rights of corporations\r\nsecured by charter, its own rights as a whole secured against king or\r\nfeudatory and the rest of the world, rights of gilds and crafts within\r\nit, and to men or women only as they were members of such bodies. But\r\nthe real weakness of the city state was once more its isolation. It was\r\nbut an islet of relative freedom on, or actually within, the borders of\r\na feudal society which grew more powerful with the generations. With the\r\nimprovement of communications and of the arts of life, the central\r\npower, particularly in France and England, began to gain upon its\r\nvassals. Feudal disobedience and disorder were suppressed, and by the\r\nend of the fifteenth century great unified states, the foundation of\r\nmodern nations, were already in being. Their emergence involved the\r\nwidening and in some respects the improvement of the social order; and\r\nin its earlier stages it favoured civic autonomy by suppressing local\r\nanarchy and feudal privilege. But the growth of centralization was in\r\nthe end incompatible with the genius of civic independence, and perilous\r\nto such elements of political right as had been gained for the\r\npopulation in general as the result of earlier conflicts between the\r\ncrown and its vassals.\r\n\r\nWe enter on the modern period, accordingly, with society constituted on\r\na thoroughly authoritarian basis, the kingly power supreme and tending\r\ntowards arbitrary despotism, and below the king the social hierarchy\r\nextending from the great territorial lord to the day-labourer. There is\r\none point gained as compared to earlier forms of society. The base of\r\nthe pyramid is a class which at least enjoys personal freedom. Serfdom\r\nhas virtually disappeared in England, and in the greater part of France\r\nhas either vanished or become attenuated to certain obnoxious incidents\r\nof the tenure of land. On the other hand, the divorce of the English\r\npeasant from the soil has begun, and has laid the foundation of the\r\nfuture social problem as it is to appear in this country.\r\n\r\nThe modern State accordingly starts from the basis of an authoritarian\r\norder, and the protest against that order, a protest religious,\r\npolitical, economic, social, and ethical, is the historic beginning of\r\nLiberalism. Thus Liberalism appears at first as a criticism, sometimes\r\neven as a destructive and revolutionary criticism. Its negative aspect\r\nis for centuries foremost. Its business seems to be not so much to build\r\nup as to pull down, to remove obstacles which block human progress,\r\nrather than to point the positive goal of endeavour or fashion the\r\nfabric of civilization. It finds humanity oppressed, and would set it\r\nfree. It finds a people groaning under arbitrary rule, a nation in\r\nbondage to a conquering race, industrial enterprise obstructed by social\r\nprivileges or crippled by taxation, and it offers relief. Everywhere it\r\nis removing superincumbent weights, knocking off fetters, clearing away\r\nobstructions. Is it doing as much for the reconstruction that will be\r\nnecessary when the demolition is complete? Is Liberalism at bottom a\r\nconstructive or only a destructive principle? Is it of permanent\r\nsignificance? Does it express some vital truth of social life as such,\r\nor is it a temporary phenomenon called forth by the special\r\ncircumstances of Western Europe, and is its work already so far\r\ncomplete that it can be content to hand on the torch to a newer and more\r\nconstructive principle, retiring for its own part from the race, or\r\nperchance seeking more backward lands for missionary work? These are\r\namong the questions that we shall have to answer. We note, for the\r\nmoment, that the circumstances of its origin suffice to explain the\r\npredominance of critical and destructive work without therefrom\r\ninferring the lack of ultimate reconstructive power. In point of fact,\r\nwhether by the aid of Liberalism or through the conservative instincts\r\nof the race, the work of reconstruction has gone on side by side with\r\nthat of demolition, and becomes more important generation by generation.\r\nThe modern State, as I shall show, goes far towards incorporating the\r\nelements of Liberal principle, and when we have seen what these are, and\r\nto what extent they are actually realized, we shall be in a better\r\nposition to understand the essentials of Liberalism, and to determine\r\nthe question of its permanent value.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] This is, of course, only one side of mediæval theory, but it is the\r\nside which lay nearest to the facts. The reverse view, which derives the\r\nauthority of government from the governed, made its appearance in the\r\nMiddle Ages partly under the influence of classical tradition. But its\r\nmain interest and importance is that it served as a starting-point for\r\nthe thought of a later time. On the whole subject the reader may consult\r\nGierke, _Political Theories of the Middle Age_, translated by Maitland\r\n(Cambridge University Press).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ELEMENTS OF LIBERALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot here attempt so much as a sketch of the historical progress of\r\nthe Liberalizing movement. I would call attention only to the main\r\npoints at which it assailed the old order, and to the fundamental ideas\r\ndirecting its advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Civil Liberty._\r\n\r\nBoth logically and historically the first point of attack is arbitrary\r\ngovernment, and the first liberty to be secured is the right to be dealt\r\nwith in accordance with law. A man who has no legal rights against\r\nanother, but stands entirely at his disposal, to be treated according to\r\nhis caprice, is a slave to that other. He is \"rightless,\" devoid of\r\nrights. Now, in some barbaric monarchies the system of rightlessness has\r\nat times been consistently carried through in the relations of subjects\r\nto the king. Here men and women, though enjoying customary rights of\r\nperson and property as against one another, have no rights at all as\r\nagainst the king's pleasure. No European monarch or seignior has ever\r\nadmittedly enjoyed power of this kind, but European governments have at\r\nvarious times and in various directions exercised or claimed powers no\r\nless arbitrary in principle. Thus, by the side of the regular courts of\r\nlaw which prescribe specific penalties for defined offences proved\r\nagainst a man by a regular form of trial, arbitrary governments resort\r\nto various extrajudicial forms of arrest, detention, and punishment,\r\ndepending on their own will and pleasure. Of such a character is\r\npunishment by \"administrative\" process in Russia at the present day;\r\nimprisonment by _lettre de cachet_ in France under the _ancien régime_;\r\nall executions by so-called martial law in times of rebellion, and the\r\nsuspension of various ordinary guarantees of immediate and fair trial in\r\nIreland. Arbitrary government in this form was one of the first objects\r\nof attack by the English Parliament in the seventeenth century, and this\r\nfirst liberty of the subject was vindicated by the Petition of Right,\r\nand again by the Habeas Corpus Act. It is significant of much that this\r\nfirst step in liberty should be in reality nothing more nor less than a\r\ndemand for law. \"Freedom of men under government,\" says Locke, summing\r\nup one whole chapter of seventeenth-century controversy, \"is to have a\r\nstanding rule to live by, common to every one of that society and made\r\nby the legislative power erected in it.\"\r\n\r\nThe first condition of universal freedom, that is to say, is a measure\r\nof universal restraint. Without such restraint some men may be free but\r\nothers will be unfree. One man may be able to do all his will, but the\r\nrest will have no will except that which he sees fit to allow them. To\r\nput the same point from another side, the first condition of free\r\ngovernment is government not by the arbitrary determination of the\r\nruler, but by fixed rules of law, to which the ruler himself is subject.\r\nWe draw the important inference that there is no essential antithesis\r\nbetween liberty and law. On the contrary, law is essential to liberty.\r\nLaw, of course, restrains the individual; it is therefore opposed to his\r\nliberty at a given moment and in a given direction. But, equally, law\r\nrestrains others from doing with him as they will. It liberates him\r\nfrom the fear of arbitrary aggression or coercion, and this is the only\r\nway, indeed, the only sense, in which liberty _for an entire community_\r\nis attainable.\r\n\r\nThere is one point tacitly postulated in this argument which should not\r\nbe overlooked. In assuming that the reign of law guarantees liberty to\r\nthe whole community, we are assuming that it is impartial. If there is\r\none law for the Government and another for its subjects, one for noble\r\nand another for commoner, one for rich and another for poor, the law\r\ndoes not guarantee liberty for all. Liberty in this respect implies\r\nequality. Hence the demand of Liberalism for such a procedure as will\r\nensure the impartial application of law. Hence the demand for the\r\nindependence of the judiciary to secure equality as between the\r\nGovernment and its subjects. Hence the demand for cheap procedure and\r\naccessible courts. Hence the abolition of privileges of class.[2] Hence\r\nwill come in time the demand for the abolition of the power of money to\r\npurchase skilled advocacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Fiscal Liberty._\r\n\r\nClosely connected with juristic liberty, and more widely felt in\r\neveryday life, is the question of fiscal liberty. The Stuarts brought\r\nthings to a head in this country by arbitrary taxation. George III\r\nbrought things to a head in America by the same infallible method. The\r\nimmediate cause of the French Revolution was the refusal of the nobles\r\nand the clergy to bear their share of the financial burden. But fiscal\r\nliberty raises more searching questions than juristic liberty. It is not\r\nenough that taxes should be fixed by a law applying universally and\r\nimpartially, for taxes vary from year to year in accordance with public\r\nneeds, and while other laws may remain stable and unchanged for an\r\nindefinite period, taxation must, in the nature of the case, be\r\nadjustable. It is a matter, properly considered, for the Executive\r\nrather than the Legislature. Hence the liberty of the subject in fiscal\r\nmatters means the restraint of the Executive, not merely by established\r\nand written laws, but by a more direct and constant supervision. It\r\nmeans, in a word, responsible government, and that is why we have more\r\noften heard the cry, \"No taxation without representation,\" than the cry,\r\n\"No legislation without representation.\" Hence, from the seventeenth\r\ncentury onwards, fiscal liberty was seen to involve what is called\r\npolitical liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Personal Liberty._\r\n\r\nOf political liberty it will be more convenient to speak later. But let\r\nus here observe that there is another avenue by which it can be, and, in\r\nfact, was, approached. We have seen that the reign of law is the first\r\nstep to liberty. A man is not free when he is controlled by other men,\r\nbut only when he is controlled by principles and rules which all society\r\nmust obey, for the community is the true master of the free man. But\r\nhere we are only at the beginning of the matter. There may be law, and\r\nthere may be no attempt, such as the Stuarts made, to set law aside, yet\r\n(1) the making and maintenance of law may depend on the will of the\r\nsovereign or of an oligarchy, and (2) the content of the law may be\r\nunjust and oppressive to some, to many, or to all except those who make\r\nit. The first point brings us back to the problem of political liberty,\r\nwhich we defer. The second opens questions which have occupied a great\r\npart of the history of Liberalism, and to deal with them we have to ask\r\nwhat types of law have been felt as peculiarly oppressive, and in what\r\nrespects it has been necessary to claim liberty not merely through law,\r\nbut by the abolition of bad law and tyrannical administration.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is the sphere of what is called personal\r\nliberty--a sphere most difficult to define, but the arena of the\r\nfiercest strife of passion and the deepest feelings of mankind. At the\r\nbasis lies liberty of thought--freedom from inquisition into opinions\r\nthat a man forms in his own mind[3]--the inner citadel where, if\r\nanywhere, the individual must rule. But liberty of thought is of very\r\nlittle avail without liberty to exchange thoughts--since thought is\r\nmainly a social product; and so with liberty of thought goes liberty of\r\nspeech and liberty of writing, printing, and peaceable discussion. These\r\nrights are not free from difficulty and dubiety. There is a point at\r\nwhich speech becomes indistinguishable from action, and free speech may\r\nmean the right to create disorder. The limits of just liberty here are\r\neasy to draw neither in theory nor in practice. They lead us immediately\r\nto one of the points at which liberty and order may be in conflict, and\r\nit is with conflicts of this kind that we shall have to deal. The\r\npossibilities of conflict are not less in relation to the connected\r\nright of liberty in religion. That this liberty is absolute cannot be\r\ncontended. No modern state would tolerate a form of religious worship\r\nwhich should include cannibalism, human sacrifice, or the burning of\r\nwitches. In point of fact, practices of this kind--which follow quite\r\nnaturally from various forms of primitive belief that are most sincerely\r\nheld--are habitually put down by civilized peoples that are responsible\r\nfor the government of less developed races. The British law recognizes\r\npolygamy in India, but I imagine it would not be open either to a\r\nMahommedan or a Hindu to contract two marriages in England. Nor is it\r\nfor liberty of this kind that the battle has been fought.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the primary meaning of religious liberty? Externally, I\r\ntake it to include the liberties of thought and expression, and to add\r\nto these the right of worship in any form which does not inflict injury\r\non others or involve a breach of public order. This limitation appears\r\nto carry with it a certain decency and restraint in expression which\r\navoids unnecessary insult to the feelings of others; and I think this\r\nimplication must be allowed, though it makes some room for strained and\r\nunfair applications. Externally, again, we must note that the demand for\r\nreligious liberty soon goes beyond mere toleration. Religious liberty is\r\nincomplete as long as any belief is penalized, as, for example, by\r\ncarrying with it exclusion from office or from educational advantages.\r\nOn this side, again, full liberty implies full equality. Turning to the\r\ninternal side, the spirit of religious liberty rests on the conception\r\nthat a man's religion ranks with his own innermost thought and feelings.\r\nIt is the most concrete expression of his personal attitude to life, to\r\nhis kind, to the world, to his own origin and destiny. There is no real\r\nreligion that is not thus drenched in personality; and the more religion\r\nis recognized for spiritual the starker the contradiction is felt to be\r\nthat any one should seek to impose a religion on another. Properly\r\nregarded, the attempt is not wicked, but impossible. Yet those sin most\r\nagainst true religion who try to convert men from the outside by\r\nmechanical means. They have the lie in the soul, being most ignorant of\r\nthe nature of that for which they feel most deeply.\r\n\r\nYet here again we stumble on difficulties. Religion is personal. Yet is\r\nnot religion also eminently social? What is more vital to the social\r\norder than its beliefs? If we send a man to gaol for stealing trash,\r\nwhat shall we do to him whom, in our conscience and on our honour, we\r\nbelieve to be corrupting the hearts of mankind, and perhaps leading them\r\nto eternal perdition? Again, what in the name of liberty are we to do to\r\nmen whose preaching, if followed out in act, would bring back the rack\r\nand the stake? Once more there is a difficulty of delimitation which\r\nwill have to be fully sifted. I will only remark here that our practice\r\nhas arrived at a solution which, upon the whole, appears to have worked\r\nwell hitherto, and which has its roots in principle. It is open to a man\r\nto preach the principles of Torquemada or the religion of Mahomet. It is\r\nnot open to men to practise such of their precepts as would violate the\r\nrights of others or cause a breach of the peace. Expression is free, and\r\nworship is free as far as it is the expression of personal devotion. So\r\nfar as they infringe the freedom, or, more generally, the rights of\r\nothers, the practices inculcated by a religion cannot enjoy unqualified\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Social Liberty._\r\n\r\nFrom the spiritual we turn to the practical side of life. On this side\r\nwe may observe, first, that Liberalism has had to deal with those\r\nrestraints on the individual which flow from the hierarchic organization\r\nof society, and reserve certain offices, certain forms of occupation,\r\nand perhaps the right or at least the opportunity of education\r\ngenerally, to people of a certain rank or class. In its more extreme\r\nform this is a caste system, and its restrictions are religious or legal\r\nas well as social. In Europe it has taken more than one form. There is\r\nthe monopoly of certain occupations by corporations, prominent in the\r\nminds of eighteenth-century French reformers. There is the reservation\r\nof public appointments and ecclesiastical patronage for those who are\r\n\"born,\" and there is a more subtly pervading spirit of class which\r\nproduces a hostile attitude to those who could and would rise; and this\r\nspirit finds a more material ally in the educational difficulties that\r\nbeset brains unendowed with wealth. I need not labour points which will\r\nbe apparent to all, but have again to remark two things. (1) Once more\r\nthe struggle for liberty is also, when pushed through, a struggle for\r\nequality. Freedom to choose and follow an occupation, if it is to become\r\nfully effective, means equality with others in the opportunities for\r\nfollowing such occupation. This is, in fact, one among the various\r\nconsiderations which lead Liberalism to support a national system of\r\nfree education, and will lead it further yet on the same lines. (2) Once\r\nagain, though we may insist on the rights of the individual, the social\r\nvalue of the corporation or quasi-corporation, like the Trade Union,\r\ncannot be ignored. Experience shows the necessity of some measure of\r\ncollective regulation in industrial matters, and in the adjustment of\r\nsuch regulation to individual liberty serious difficulties of principle\r\nemerge. We shall have to refer to these in the next section. But one\r\npoint is relevant at this stage. It is clearly a matter of Liberal\r\nprinciple that membership of a corporation should not depend on any\r\nhereditary qualification, nor be set about with any artificial\r\ndifficulty of entry, where by the term artificial is meant any\r\ndifficulty not involved in the nature of the occupation concerned, but\r\ndesigned for purposes of exclusiveness. As against all such methods of\r\nrestriction, the Liberal case is clear.\r\n\r\nIt has only to be added here that restrictions of sex are in every\r\nrespect parallel to restrictions of class. There are, doubtless,\r\noccupations for which women are unfit. But, if so, the test of fitness\r\nis sufficient to exclude them. The \"open road for women\" is one\r\napplication, and a very big one, of the \"open road for talent,\" and to\r\nsecure them both is of the essence of Liberalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Economic Liberty_\r\n\r\nApart from monopolies, industry was shackled in the earlier part of the\r\nmodern period by restrictive legislation in various forms, by navigation\r\nlaws, and by tariffs. In particular, the tariff was not merely an\r\nobstruction to free enterprise, but a source of inequality as between\r\ntrade and trade. Its fundamental effect is to transfer capital and\r\nlabour from the objects on which they can be most profitably employed in\r\na given locality, to objects on which they are less profitably employed,\r\nby endowing certain industries to the disadvantage of the general\r\nconsumer. Here, again, the Liberal movement is at once an attack on an\r\nobstruction and on an inequality. In most countries the attack has\r\nsucceeded in breaking down local tariffs and establishing relatively\r\nlarge Free Trade units. It is only in England, and only owing to our\r\nearly manufacturing supremacy, that it has fully succeeded in overcoming\r\nthe Protective principle, and even in England the Protectionist reaction\r\nwould undoubtedly have gained at least a temporary victory but for our\r\ndependence on foreign countries for food and the materials of industry.\r\nThe most striking victory of Liberal ideas is one of the most\r\nprecarious. At the same time, the battle is one which Liberalism is\r\nalways prepared to fight over again. It has led to no back stroke, no\r\ncounter-movement within the Liberal ranks themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with organized restrictions upon industry. The old\r\nregulations, which were quite unsuited to the conditions of the time,\r\neither fell into desuetude during the eighteenth century, or were\r\nformally abolished during the earlier years of the industrial\r\nrevolution. For a while it seemed as though wholly unrestricted\r\nindustrial enterprise was to be the progressive watchword, and the\r\nechoes of that time still linger. But the old restrictions had not been\r\nformally withdrawn before a new process of regulation began. The\r\nconditions produced by the new factory system shocked the public\r\nconscience; and as early as 1802 we find the first of a long series of\r\nlaws, out of which has grown an industrial code that year by year\r\nfollows the life of the operative, in his relations with his employer,\r\ninto more minute detail. The first stages of this movement were\r\ncontemplated with doubt and distrust by many men of Liberal sympathies.\r\nThe intention was, doubtless, to protect the weaker party, but the\r\nmethod was that of interference with freedom of contract. Now the\r\nfreedom of the sane adult individual--even such strong individualists as\r\nCobden recognized that the case of children stood apart--carried with it\r\nthe right of concluding such agreements as seemed best to suit his own\r\ninterests, and involved both the right and the duty of determining the\r\nlines of his life for himself. Free contract and personal responsibility\r\nlay close to the heart of the whole Liberal movement. Hence the doubts\r\nfelt by so many Liberals as to the regulation of industry by law. None\r\nthe less, as time has gone on, men of the keenest Liberal sympathies\r\nhave come not merely to accept but eagerly to advance the extension of\r\npublic control in the industrial sphere, and of collective\r\nresponsibility in the matter of the education and even the feeding of\r\nchildren, the housing of the industrial population, the care of the sick\r\nand aged, the provision of the means of regular employment. On this side\r\nLiberalism seems definitely to have retraced its steps, and we shall\r\nhave to inquire closely into the question whether the reversal is a\r\nchange of principle or of application.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with freedom of contract is freedom of association. If\r\nmen may make any agreement with one another in their mutual interest so\r\nlong as they do not injure a third party, they may apparently agree to\r\nact together permanently for any purposes of common interest on the same\r\nconditions. That is, they may form associations. Yet at bottom the\r\npowers of an association are something very different from the powers of\r\nthe individuals composing it; and it is only by legal pedantry that the\r\nattempt can be made to regulate the behaviour of an association on\r\nprinciples derived from and suitable to the relations of individuals. An\r\nassociation might become so powerful as to form a state within the\r\nstate, and to contend with government on no unequal terms. The history\r\nof some revolutionary societies, of some ecclesiastical organizations,\r\neven of some American trusts might be quoted to show that the danger is\r\nnot imaginary. Short of this, an association may act oppressively\r\ntowards others and even towards its own members, and the function of\r\nLiberalism may be rather to protect the individual against the power of\r\nthe association than to protect the right of association against the\r\nrestriction of the law. In fact, in this regard, the principle of\r\nliberty cuts both ways, and this double application is reflected in\r\nhistory. The emancipation of trade unions, however, extending over the\r\nperiod from 1824 to 1906, and perhaps not yet complete, was in the main\r\na liberating movement, because combination was necessary to place the\r\nworkman on something approaching terms of equality with the employer,\r\nand because tacit combinations of employers could never, in fact, be\r\nprevented by law. It was, again, a movement to liberty through equality.\r\nOn the other hand, the oppressive capacities of a trade union could\r\nnever be left out of account, while combinations of capital, which might\r\nbe infinitely more powerful, have justly been regarded with distrust. In\r\nthis there is no inconsistency of principle, but a just appreciation of\r\na real difference of circumstance. Upon the whole it may be said that\r\nthe function of Liberalism is not so much to maintain a general right of\r\nfree association as to define the right in each case in such terms as\r\nmake for the maximum of real liberty and equality.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Domestic Liberty._\r\n\r\nOf all associations within the State, the miniature community of the\r\nFamily is the most universal and of the strongest independent vitality.\r\nThe authoritarian state was reflected in the authoritarian family, in\r\nwhich the husband was within wide limits absolute lord of the person and\r\nproperty of wife and children. The movement of liberation consists (1)\r\nin rendering the wife a fully responsible individual, capable of holding\r\nproperty, suing and being sued, conducting business on her own account,\r\nand enjoying full personal protection against her husband; (2) in\r\nestablishing marriage as far as the law is concerned on a purely\r\ncontractual basis, and leaving the sacramental aspect of marriage to the\r\nordinances of the religion professed by the parties; (3) in securing the\r\nphysical, mental, and moral care of the children, partly by imposing\r\ndefinite responsibilities on the parents and punishing them for neglect,\r\npartly by elaborating a public system of education and of hygiene. The\r\nfirst two movements are sufficiently typical cases of the\r\ninterdependence of liberty and equality. The third is more often\r\nconceived as a Socialistic than a Liberal tendency, and, in point of\r\nfact, the State control of education gives rise to some searching\r\nquestions of principle, which have not yet been fully solved. If, in\r\ngeneral, education is a duty which the State has a right to enforce,\r\nthere is a countervailing right of choice as to the lines of education\r\nwhich it would be ill to ignore, and the mode of adjustment has not yet\r\nbeen adequately determined either in theory or in practice. I would,\r\nhowever, strongly maintain that the general conception of the State as\r\nOver-parent is quite as truly Liberal as Socialistic. It is the basis of\r\nthe rights of the child, of his protection against parental neglect, of\r\nthe equality of opportunity which he may claim as a future citizen, of\r\nhis training to fill his place as a grown-up person in the social\r\nsystem. Liberty once more involves control and restraint.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Local, Racial, and National Liberty._\r\n\r\nFrom the smallest social unit we pass to the largest. A great part of\r\nthe liberating movement is occupied with the struggle of entire nations\r\nagainst alien rule, with the revolt of Europe against Napoleon, with the\r\nstruggle of Italy for freedom, with the fate of the Christian subjects\r\nof Turkey, with the emancipation of the negro, with the national\r\nmovement in Ireland and in India. Many of these struggles present the\r\nproblem of liberty in its simplest form. It has been and is too often a\r\nquestion of securing the most elementary rights for the weaker party;\r\nand those who are not touched by the appeal are deficient rather in\r\nimagination than in logic or ethics. But at the back of national\r\nmovements very difficult questions do arise. What is a nation as\r\ndistinct from a state? What sort of unity does it constitute, and what\r\nare its rights? If Ireland is a nation, is Ulster one? and if Ulster is\r\na British and Protestant nation, what of the Catholic half of Ulster?\r\nHistory has in some cases given us a practical answer. Thus, it has\r\nshown that, enjoying the gift of responsible government, French and\r\nBritish, despite all historical quarrels and all differences of\r\nreligious belief, language, and social structure, have fused into the\r\nnation of Canada. History has justified the conviction that Germany was\r\na nation, and thrown ridicule on the contemptuous saying of Metternich\r\nthat Italy was a geographical expression. But how to anticipate history,\r\nwhat rights to concede to a people that claims to be a self-determining\r\nunit, is less easy to decide. There is no doubt that the general\r\ntendency of Liberalism is to favour autonomy, but, faced as it is with\r\nthe problems of subdivision and the complexity of group with group, it\r\nhas to rely on the concrete teaching of history and the practical\r\ninsight of statesmanship to determine how the lines of autonomy are to\r\nbe drawn. There is, however, one empirical test which seems generally\r\napplicable. Where a weaker nation incorporated with a larger or stronger\r\none can be governed by ordinary law applicable to both parties to the\r\nunion, and fulfilling all the ordinary principles of liberty, the\r\narrangement may be the best for both parties. But where this system\r\nfails, where the government is constantly forced to resort to\r\nexceptional legislation or perhaps to de-liberalize its own\r\ninstitutions, the case becomes urgent. Under such conditions the most\r\nliberally-minded democracy is maintaining a system which must undermine\r\nits own principles. The Assyrian conqueror, Mr. Herbert Spencer\r\nremarks, who is depicted in the bas-reliefs leading his captive by a\r\ncord, is bound with that cord himself. He forfeits his liberty as long\r\nas he retains his power.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar questions arise about race, which many people wrongly\r\nconfuse with nationality. So far as elementary rights are concerned\r\nthere can be no question as to the attitude of Liberalism. When the\r\npolitical power which should guarantee such rights is brought into view,\r\nquestions of fact arise. Is the Negro or the Kaffir mentally and morally\r\ncapable of self-government or of taking part in a self-governing State?\r\nThe experience of Cape Colony tends to the affirmative view. American\r\nexperience of the negro gives, I take it, a more doubtful answer. A\r\nspecious extension of the white man's rights to the black may be the\r\nbest way of ruining the black. To destroy tribal custom by introducing\r\nconceptions of individual property, the free disposal of land, and the\r\nfree purchase of gin may be the handiest method for the expropriator. In\r\nall relations with weaker peoples we move in an atmosphere vitiated by\r\nthe insincere use of high-sounding words. If men say equality, they mean\r\noppression by forms of justice. If they say tutelage, they appear to\r\nmean the kind of tutelage extended to the fattened goose. In such an\r\natmosphere, perhaps, our safest course, so far as principles and\r\ndeductions avail at all, is to fix our eyes on the elements of the\r\nmatter, and in any part of the world to support whatever method succeeds\r\nin securing the \"coloured\" man from personal violence, from the lash,\r\nfrom expropriation, and from gin; above all, so far as it may yet be,\r\nfrom the white man himself. Until the white man has fully learnt to rule\r\nhis own life, the best of all things that he can do with the dark man is\r\nto do nothing with him. In this relation, the day of a more constructive\r\nLiberalism is yet to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _International Liberty._\r\n\r\nIf non-interference is the best thing for the barbarian many Liberals\r\nhave thought it to be the supreme wisdom in international affairs\r\ngenerally. I shall examine this view later. Here I merely remark: (1) It\r\nis of the essence of Liberalism to oppose the use of force, the basis of\r\nall tyranny. (2) It is one of its practical necessities to withstand the\r\ntyranny of armaments. Not only may the military force be directly\r\nturned against liberty, as in Russia, but there are more subtle ways, as\r\nin Western Europe, in which the military spirit eats into free\r\ninstitutions and absorbs the public resources which might go to the\r\nadvancement of civilization. (3) In proportion as the world becomes\r\nfree, the use of force becomes meaningless. There is no purpose in\r\naggression if it is not to issue in one form or another of national\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Political Liberty and Popular Sovereignty._\r\n\r\nUnderlying all these questions of right is the question how they are to\r\nbe secured and maintained. By enforcing the responsibility of the\r\nexecutive and legislature to the community as a whole? Such is the\r\ngeneral answer, and it indicates one of the lines of connection between\r\nthe general theory of liberty and the doctrine of universal suffrage and\r\nthe sovereignty of the people. The answer, however, does not meet all\r\nthe possibilities of the case. The people as a whole might be careless\r\nof their rights and incapable of managing them. They might be set on the\r\nconquest of others, the expropriation of the rich, or on any form of\r\ncollective tyranny or folly. It is perfectly possible that from the\r\npoint of view of general liberty and social progress a limited franchise\r\nmight give better results than one that is more extended. Even in this\r\ncountry it is a tenable view that the extension of the suffrage in 1884\r\ntended for some years to arrest the development of liberty in various\r\ndirections. On what theory does the principle of popular sovereignty\r\nrest, and within what limits does it hold good? Is it a part of the\r\ngeneral principles of liberty and equality, or are other ideas involved?\r\nThese are among the questions which we shall have to examine.\r\n\r\nWe have now passed the main phases of the Liberal movement in very\r\nsummary review, and we have noted, first, that it is co-extensive with\r\nlife. It is concerned with the individual, the family, the State. It\r\ntouches industry, law, religion, ethics. It would not be difficult, if\r\nspace allowed, to illustrate its influence in literature and art, to\r\ndescribe the war with convention, insincerity, and patronage, and the\r\nstruggle for free self-expression, for reality, for the artist's soul.\r\nLiberalism is an all-penetrating element of the life-structure of the\r\nmodern world. Secondly, it is an effective historical force. If its work\r\nis nowhere complete, it is almost everywhere in progress. The modern\r\nState as we see it in Europe outside Russia, in the British colonies, in\r\nNorth and South America, as we begin to see it in the Russian empire and\r\nthroughout the vast continent of Asia, is the old authoritarian society\r\nmodified in greater or less degree by the absorption of Liberal\r\nprinciples. Turning, thirdly, to those principles themselves, we have\r\nrecognized Liberalism in every department as a movement fairly denoted\r\nby the name--a movement of liberation, a clearance of obstructions, an\r\nopening of channels for the flow of free spontaneous vital activity.\r\nFourthly, we have seen that in a large number of cases what is under one\r\naspect a movement for liberty is on another side a movement towards\r\nequality, and the habitual association of these principles is so far\r\nconfirmed. On the other hand, lastly, we have seen numerous cases in\r\nwhich the exacter definition of liberty and the precise meaning of\r\nequality remain obscure, and to discuss these will be our task. We have,\r\nmoreover, admittedly regarded Liberalism mainly in its earlier and more\r\nnegative aspect. We have seen it as a force working within an old\r\nsociety and modifying it by the loosening of the bonds which its\r\nstructure imposed on human activity. We have yet to ask what\r\nconstructive social scheme, if any, could be formed on Liberal\r\nprinciples; and it is here, if at all, that the fuller meaning of the\r\nprinciples of Liberty and Equality should appear, and the methods of\r\napplying them be made out. The problem of popular sovereignty pointed to\r\nthe same need. Thus the lines of the remainder of our task are clearly\r\nlaid down. We have to get at the fundamentals of Liberalism, and to\r\nconsider what kind of structure can be raised upon the basis which they\r\noffer. We will approach the question by tracing the historic movement of\r\nLiberal thought through certain well-marked phases. We shall see how the\r\nproblems which have been indicated were attacked by successive thinkers,\r\nand how partial solutions gave occasion for deeper probings. Following\r\nthe guidance of the actual movement of ideas, we shall reach the centre\r\nand heart of Liberalism, and we shall try to form a conception of the\r\nessentials of the Liberal creed as a constructive theory of society.\r\nThis conception we shall then apply to the greater questions, political\r\nand economic, of our own day; and this will enable us finally to\r\nestimate the present position of Liberalism as a living force in the\r\nmodern world and the prospect of transforming its ideals into\r\nactualities.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] In England \"benefit of clergy\" was still a good plea for remission\r\nof sentence for a number of crimes in the seventeenth century. At that\r\ntime all who could read could claim benefit, which was therefore of the\r\nnature of a privilege for the educated class. The requirement of\r\nreading, which had become a form, was abolished in 1705, but peers and\r\nclerks in holy orders could still plead their clergy in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and the last relics of the privilege were not finally abolished\r\ntill the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[3] See an interesting chapter in Faguet's _Liberalisme_, which points\r\nout that the common saying that thought is free is negated by any\r\ninquisition which compels a man to disclose opinions, and penalizes him\r\nif they are not such as to suit the inquisitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE MOVEMENT OF THEORY\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat changes are not caused by ideas alone; but they are not effected\r\nwithout ideas. The passions of men must be aroused if the frost of\r\ncustom is to be broken or the chains of authority burst; but passion of\r\nitself is blind and its world is chaotic. To be effective men must act\r\ntogether, and to act together they must have a common understanding and\r\na common object. When it comes to be a question of any far-reaching\r\nchange, they must not merely conceive their own immediate end with\r\nclearness. They must convert others, they must communicate sympathy and\r\nwin over the unconvinced. Upon the whole, they must show that their\r\nobject is possible, that it is compatible with existing institutions, or\r\nat any rate with some workable form of social life. They are, in fact,\r\ndriven on by the requirements of their position to the elaboration of\r\nideas, and in the end to some sort of social philosophy; and the\r\nphilosophies that have driving force behind them are those which arise\r\nafter this fashion out of the practical demands of human feeling. The\r\nphilosophies that remain ineffectual and academic are those that are\r\nformed by abstract reflection without relation to the thirsty souls of\r\nhuman kind.\r\n\r\nIn England, it is true, where men are apt to be shy and unhandy in the\r\nregion of theory, the Liberal movement has often sought to dispense with\r\ngeneral principles. In its early days and in its more moderate forms, it\r\nsought its ends under the guise of constitutionalism. As against the\r\nclaims of the Stuart monarchy, there was a historic case as well as a\r\nphilosophic argument, and the earlier leaders of the Parliament relied\r\nmore on precedent than on principle. This method was embodied in the\r\nWhig tradition, and runs on to our own time, as one of the elements that\r\ngo to make up the working constitution of the Liberal mind. It is, so to\r\nsay, the Conservative element in Liberalism, valuable in resistance to\r\nencroachments, valuable in securing continuity of development, for\r\npurposes of re-construction insufficient. To maintain the old order\r\nunder changed circumstances may be, in fact, to initiate a revolution.\r\nIt was so in the seventeenth century. Pym and his followers could find\r\njustification for their contentions in our constitutional history, but\r\nto do so they had to go behind both the Stuarts and the Tudors; and to\r\napply the principles of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in 1640\r\nwas, in effect, to institute a revolution. In our own time, to maintain\r\nthe right of the Commons against the Lords is, on the face of it, to\r\nadhere to old constitutional right, but to do so under the new\r\ncircumstances which have made the Commons representative of the nation\r\nas a whole is, in reality, to establish democracy for the first time on\r\na firm footing, and this, again, is to accomplish a revolution.\r\n\r\nNow, those who effect a revolution ought to know whither they are\r\nleading the world. They have need of a social theory--and in point of\r\nfact the more thorough-going apostles of movement always have such a\r\ntheory; and though, as we have remarked, the theory emerges from the\r\npractical needs which they feel, and is therefore apt to invest ideas\r\nof merely temporary value with the character of eternal truths, it is\r\nnot on this account to be dismissed as of secondary importance. Once\r\nformed, it reacts upon the minds of its adherents, and gives direction\r\nand unity to their efforts. It becomes, in its turn, a real historic\r\nforce, and the degree of its coherence and adequacy is matter, not\r\nmerely of academic interest, but of practical moment. Moreover, the\r\nonward course of a movement is more clearly understood by appreciating\r\nthe successive points of view which its thinkers and statesmen have\r\noccupied than by following the devious turnings of political events and\r\nthe tangle of party controversy. The point of view naturally affects the\r\nwhole method of handling problems, whether speculative or practical, and\r\nto the historian it serves as a centre around which ideas and policies\r\nthat perhaps differ, and even conflict with one another, may be so\r\ngrouped as to show their underlying affinities. Let us then seek to\r\ndetermine the principal points of view which the Liberal movement has\r\noccupied, and distinguish the main types of theory in which the passion\r\nfor freedom has sought to express itself.\r\n\r\nThe first of these types I will call the theory of the Natural Order.\r\n\r\nThe earlier Liberalism had to deal with authoritarian government in\r\nchurch and state. It had to vindicate the elements of personal, civil,\r\nand economic freedom; and in so doing it took its stand on the rights of\r\nman, and, in proportion as it was forced to be constructive, on the\r\nsupposed harmony of the natural order. Government claimed supernatural\r\nsanction and divine ordinance. Liberal theory replied in effect that the\r\nrights of man rested on the law of Nature, and those of government on\r\nhuman institution. The oldest \"institution\" in this view was the\r\nindividual, and the primordial society the natural grouping of human\r\nbeings under the influence of family affection, and for the sake of\r\nmutual aid. Political society was a more artificial arrangement, a\r\nconvention arrived at for the specific purpose of securing a better\r\norder and maintaining the common safety. It was, perhaps, as Locke held,\r\nfounded on a contract between king and people, a contract which was\r\nbrought to an end if either party violated its terms. Or, as in\r\nRousseau's view, it was essentially a contract of the people with one\r\nanother, an arrangement by means of which, out of many conflicting\r\nindividual wills, a common or general will could be formed. A government\r\nmight be instituted as the organ of this will, but it would, from the\r\nnature of the case, be subordinate to the people from whom it derived\r\nauthority. The people were sovereign. The government was their delegate.\r\n\r\nWhatever the differences of outlook that divide these theories, those\r\nwho from Locke to Rousseau and Paine worked with this order of ideas\r\nagreed in conceiving political society as a restraint to which men\r\nvoluntarily submitted themselves for specific purposes. Political\r\ninstitutions were the source of subjection and inequality. Before and\r\nbehind them stood the assemblage of free and equal individuals. But the\r\nisolated individual was powerless. He had rights which were limited only\r\nby the corresponding rights of others, but he could not, unless chance\r\ngave him the upper hand, enforce them. Accordingly, he found it best to\r\nenter into an arrangement with others for the mutual respect of rights;\r\nand for this purpose he instituted a government to maintain his rights\r\nwithin the community and to guard the community from assault from\r\nwithout. It followed that the function of government was limited and\r\ndefinable. It was to maintain the natural rights of man as accurately as\r\nthe conditions of society allowed, and to do naught beside. Any further\r\naction employing the compulsory power of the State was of the nature of\r\nan infringement of the understanding on which government rested. In\r\nentering into the compact, the individual gave up so much of his rights\r\nas was necessitated by the condition of submitting to a common rule--so\r\nmuch, and no more. He gave up his natural rights and received in return\r\ncivil rights, something less complete, perhaps, but more effective as\r\nresting on the guarantee of the collective power. If you would discover,\r\nthen, what the civil rights of man in society should be, you must\r\ninquire what are the natural rights of man,[4] and how far they are\r\nunavoidably modified in accommodating the conflicting claims of men\r\nwith one another. Any interference that goes beyond this necessary\r\naccommodation is oppression. Civil rights should agree as nearly as\r\npossible with natural rights, or, as Paine says, a civil right is a\r\nnatural right exchanged.\r\n\r\nThis conception of the relations of the State and the individual long\r\noutlived the theory on which it rested. It underlies the entire teaching\r\nof the Manchester school. Its spirit was absorbed, as we shall see, by\r\nmany of the Utilitarians. It operated, though in diminishing force,\r\nthroughout the nineteenth century; and it is strongly held by\r\ncontemporary Liberals like M. Faguet, who frankly abrogate its\r\nspeculative foundations and rest their case on social utility. Its\r\nstrength is, in effect, not in its logical principles, but in the\r\ncompactness and consistency which it gives to a view of the functions of\r\nthe State which responds to certain needs of modern society. As long as\r\nthose needs were uppermost, the theory was of living value. In\r\nproportion as they have been satisfied and other needs have emerged, the\r\nrequirement has arisen for a fuller and sounder principle.\r\n\r\nBut there was another side to the theory of nature which we must not\r\nignore. If in this theory government is the marplot and authority the\r\nsource of oppression and stagnation, where are the springs of progress\r\nand civilization? Clearly, in the action of individuals. The more the\r\nindividual receives free scope for the play of his faculties, the more\r\nrapidly will society as a whole advance. There are here the elements of\r\nan important truth, but what is the implication? If the individual is\r\nfree, any two individuals, each pursuing his own ends, may find\r\nthemselves in conflict. It was, in fact, the possibility of such\r\nconflict which was recognized by our theory as the origin and foundation\r\nof society. Men had to agree to some measure of mutual restraint in\r\norder that their liberty might be effective. But in the course of the\r\neighteenth century, and particularly in the economic sphere, there arose\r\na view that the conflict of wills is based on misunderstanding and\r\nignorance, and that its mischiefs are accentuated by governmental\r\nrepression. At bottom there is a natural harmony of interests. Maintain\r\nexternal order, suppress violence, assure men in the possession of their\r\nproperty, and enforce the fulfilment of contracts, and the rest will go\r\nof itself. Each man will be guided by self-interest, but interest will\r\nlead him along the lines of greatest productivity. If all artificial\r\nbarriers are removed, he will find the occupation which best suits his\r\ncapacities, and this will be the occupation in which he will be most\r\nproductive, and therefore, socially, most valuable. He will have to sell\r\nhis goods to a willing purchaser, therefore he must devote himself to\r\nthe production of things which others need, things, therefore, of social\r\nvalue. He will, by preference, make that for which he can obtain the\r\nhighest price, and this will be that for which, at the particular time\r\nand place and in relation to his particular capacities, there is the\r\ngreatest need. He will, again, find the employer who will pay him best,\r\nand that will be the employer to whom he can do the best service.\r\nSelf-interest, if enlightened and unfettered, will, in short, lead him\r\nto conduct coincident with public interest. There is, in this sense, a\r\nnatural harmony between the individual and society. True, this harmony\r\nmight require a certain amount of education and enlightenment to make it\r\neffective. What it did not require was governmental \"interference,\"\r\nwhich would always hamper the causes making for its smooth and\r\neffectual operation. Government must keep the ring, and leave it for\r\nindividuals to play out the game. The theory of the natural rights of\r\nthe individual is thus supplemented by a theory of the mutual harmony of\r\nindividual and social needs, and, so completed, forms a conception of\r\nhuman society which is _primâ facie_ workable, which, in fact, contains\r\nimportant elements of truth, and which was responsive to the needs of a\r\ngreat class, and to many of the requirements of society as a whole,\r\nduring a considerable period.\r\n\r\nOn both sides, however, the theory exhibits, under criticism,\r\nfundamental weaknesses which have both a historical and a speculative\r\nsignificance. Let us first consider the conception of natural rights.\r\nWhat were these rights, and on what did they rest? On the first point\r\nmen sought to be explicit. By way of illustration we cannot do better\r\nthan quote the leading clauses of the Declaration of 1789.[5]\r\n\r\n_Article I._--Men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social\r\ndistinctions can only be founded on common utility.\r\n\r\n_Article II._--The end of every political association is the\r\nconservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man.[6] These\r\nrights are liberty, property, security (_la sûreté_), and resistance to\r\noppression.\r\n\r\n_Article III._--The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in\r\nthe nation....\r\n\r\n_Article IV._--Liberty consists in the power to do anything that does\r\nnot injure others; thus, the exercise of the natural rights of every man\r\nhas only such limits as assure to other members of society the enjoyment\r\nof the same rights. These limits can only be determined by law.\r\n\r\n_Article VI._--The law is the expression of the general will. All\r\ncitizens have a right to take part (_concourir_), personally or by their\r\nrepresentatives, in its formation.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this article insists on the impartiality of law and the\r\nequal admission of all citizens to office. The Declaration of 1793 is\r\nmore emphatic about equality, and more rhetorical. Article III reads,\r\n\"All men are equal by nature and before the law.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to subject these articles to a niggling form of criticism in\r\nwhich their spirit is altogether missed. I would ask attention only to\r\none or two points of principle.\r\n\r\n(_a_) What are the rights actually claimed? \"Security\" and \"resistance\r\nto oppression\" are not in principle distinct, and, moreover, may be\r\ntaken as covered by the definition of liberty. The meaning at bottom is\r\n\"Security for liberty in respect of his person and property is the right\r\nof every man.\" So expressed, it will be seen that this right postulates\r\nthe existence of an ordered society, and lays down that it is the duty\r\nof such a society to secure the liberty of its members. The right of the\r\nindividual, then, is not something independent of society, but one of\r\nthe principles which a good social order must recognize.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Observe that equality is limited by the \"common utility,\" and that\r\nthe sphere of liberty is ultimately to be defined by \"law.\" In both\r\ncases we are referred back from the individual either to the needs or to\r\nthe decision of society as a whole. There are, moreover, two\r\ndefinitions of liberty. (1) It is the power to do what does not injure\r\nothers. (2) It is a right limited by the consideration that others must\r\nenjoy the same rights. It is important to bear in mind that these two\r\ndefinitions are highly discrepant. If my right to knock a man down is\r\nonly limited by his equal right to knock me down, the law has no\r\nbusiness to interfere when we take to our fists. If, on the other hand,\r\nI have no right to injure another, the law should interfere. Very little\r\nreflection suffices to show that this is the sounder principle, and that\r\nrespect for the equal liberty of another is not an adequate definition\r\nof liberty. My right to keep my neighbour awake by playing the piano all\r\nnight is not satisfactorily counterbalanced by his right to keep a dog\r\nwhich howls all the time the piano is being played. The right of a\r\n\"sweater\" to pay starvation wages is not satisfactorily limited by the\r\ncorresponding right which his employee would enjoy if he were in a\r\nposition to impose the same terms on some one else. Generally, the right\r\nto injure or take advantage of another is not sufficiently limited by\r\nthe right of that other if he should have the power to retaliate in\r\nkind. There is no right to injure another; and if we ask what is injury\r\nwe are again thrown back on some general principle which will override\r\nthe individual claim to do what one will.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The doctrine of popular sovereignty rests on two principles. (1)\r\nIt is said to reside in the nation. Law is the expression of the general\r\nwill. Here the \"nation\" is conceived as a collective whole, as a unit.\r\n(2) Every citizen has the right to take part in making the law. Here the\r\nquestion is one of individual right. Which is the real ground of\r\ndemocratic representation--the unity of the national life, or the\r\ninherent right of the individual to be consulted about that which\r\nconcerns himself?\r\n\r\nFurther, and this is a very serious question, which is the ultimate\r\nauthority--the will of the nation, or the rights of the individual?\r\nSuppose the nation deliberately decides on laws which deny the rights of\r\nthe individual, ought such laws to be obeyed in the name of popular\r\nsovereignty, or to be disobeyed in the name of natural rights? It is a\r\nreal issue, and on these lines it is unfortunately quite insoluble.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties were among the considerations which led to the\r\nformation of the second type of Liberal theory, and what has to be said\r\nabout the harmony of the natural order may be taken in conjunction with\r\nthis second theory to which we may now pass, and which is famous as The\r\nGreatest Happiness Principle.\r\n\r\nBentham, who spent the greater part of his life in elaborating the\r\ngreatest happiness principle as a basis of social reconstruction, was\r\nfully alive to the difficulties which we have found in the theory of\r\nnatural rights. The alleged rights of man were for him so many\r\nanarchical fallacies. They were founded on no clearly assignable\r\nprinciple, and admitted of no demonstration. \"I say I have a right.\" \"I\r\nsay you have no such right.\" Between the disputants who or what is to\r\ndecide? What was the supposed law of nature? When was it written, and by\r\nwhose authority? On what ground do we maintain that men are free or\r\nequal? On what principle and within what limits do we or can we maintain\r\nthe right of property? There were points on which, by universal\r\nadmission, all these rights have to give way. What is the right of\r\nproperty worth in times of war or of any overwhelming general need? The\r\nDeclaration itself recognized the need of appeal to common utility or to\r\nthe law to define the limits of individual right. Bentham would frankly\r\nmake all rights dependent on common utility, and therewith he would make\r\nit possible to examine all conflicting claims in the light of a general\r\nprinciple. He would measure them all by a common standard. Has a man the\r\nright to express his opinion freely? To determine the question on\r\nBentham's lines we must ask whether it is, on the whole, useful to\r\nsociety that the free expression of opinion should be allowed, and this,\r\nhe would say, is a question which may be decided by general reasoning\r\nand by experience of results. Of course, we must take the rough with the\r\nsmooth. If the free expression of opinion is allowed, false opinion will\r\nfind utterance and will mislead many. The question would be, does the\r\nloss involved in the promulgation of error counterbalance the gain to be\r\nderived from unfettered discussion? and Bentham would hold himself free\r\nto judge by results. Should the State maintain the rights of private\r\nproperty? Yes, if the admission of those rights is useful to the\r\ncommunity as a whole. No, if it is not useful. Some rights of property,\r\nagain, may be advantageous, others disadvantageous. The community is\r\nfree to make a selection. If it finds that certain forms of property are\r\nworking to the exclusive benefit of individuals and the prejudice of the\r\ncommon weal, it has good ground for the suppression of those forms of\r\nproperty, while it may, with equal justice, maintain other forms of\r\nproperty which it holds sound as judged by the effect on the common\r\nwelfare. It is limited by no \"imprescriptible\" right of the individual.\r\nIt may do with the individual what it pleases provided that it has the\r\ngood of the whole in view. So far as the question of right is concerned\r\nthe Benthamite principle might be regarded as decidedly socialistic or\r\neven authoritarian. It contemplates, at least as a possibility, the\r\ncomplete subordination of individual to social claims.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another side to the Benthamite principle, to\r\nunderstand which we must state the heads of the theory itself as a\r\npositive doctrine. What is this social utility of which we have spoken?\r\nIn what does it consist? What is useful to society, and what harmful?\r\nThe answer has the merit of great clearness and simplicity. An action\r\nis good which tends to promote the greatest possible happiness of the\r\ngreatest possible number of those affected by it. As with an action, so,\r\nof course, with an institution or a social system. That is useful which\r\nconforms to this principle. That is harmful which conflicts with it.\r\nThat is right which conforms to it, that is wrong which conflicts with\r\nit. The greatest happiness principle is the one and supreme principle of\r\nconduct. Observe that it imposes on us two considerations. One is the\r\n_greatest_ happiness. Now happiness is defined as consisting positively\r\nin the presence of pleasure, negatively in the absence of pain. A\r\ngreater pleasure is then preferable to a lesser, a pleasure\r\nunaccompanied by pain to one involving pain. Conceiving pain as a minus\r\nquantity of pleasure, we may say that the principle requires us always\r\nto take quantity and pleasure into account, and nothing else. But,\r\nsecondly, the _number_ of individuals affected is material. An act might\r\ncause pleasure to one and pain to two. Then it is wrong, unless, indeed,\r\nthe pleasure were very great and the pain in each case small. We must\r\nbalance the consequences, taking all individuals affected into account,\r\nand \"everybody must count for one and nobody for more than one.\" This\r\ncomment is an integral part of the original formula. As between the\r\nhappiness of his father, his child, or himself, and the happiness of a\r\nstranger, a man must be impartial. He must only consider the quantity of\r\npleasure secured or pain inflicted.\r\n\r\nNow, in this conception of measurable quantities of pleasure and pain\r\nthere is, as many critics have insisted, something unreal and academic.\r\nWe shall have to return to the point, but let us first endeavour to\r\nunderstand the bearing of Bentham's teaching on the problems of his own\r\ntime and on the subsequent development of Liberal thought. For this\r\npurpose we will keep to what is real in his doctrine, even if it is not\r\nalways defined with academic precision. The salient points that we note,\r\nthen, are (1) the subordination of all considerations of right to the\r\nconsiderations of happiness, (2) the importance of number, and (3) as\r\nthe other side of the same doctrine, the insistence on equality or\r\nimpartiality between man and man. The common utility which Bentham\r\nconsiders is the happiness experienced by a number of individuals, all\r\nof whom are reckoned for this purpose as of equal value. This is the\r\nradical individualism of the Benthamite creed, to be set against that\r\nsocialistic tendency which struck us in our preliminary account.\r\n\r\nIn this individualism, equality is fundamental. Everybody is to count\r\nfor one, nobody for more than one, for every one can feel pain and\r\npleasure. Liberty, on the other hand, is not fundamental, it is a means\r\nto an end. Popular sovereignty is not fundamental, for all government is\r\na means to an end. Nevertheless, the school of Bentham, upon the whole,\r\nstood by both liberty and democracy. Let us consider their attitude.\r\n\r\nAs to popular government, Bentham and James Mill reasoned after this\r\nfashion. Men, if left to themselves, that is to say, if neither trained\r\nby an educational discipline nor checked by responsibility, do not\r\nconsider the good of the greatest number. They consider their own good.\r\nA king, if his power is unchecked, will rule in his own interest. A\r\nclass, if its power is unchecked, will rule in its own interest. The\r\nonly way to secure fair consideration for the happiness of all is to\r\nallow to all an equal share of power. True, if there is a conflict the\r\nmajority will prevail, but they will be moved each by consideration of\r\nhis own happiness, and the majority as a whole, therefore, by the\r\nhappiness of the greater number. There is no inherent right in the\r\nindividual to take a part in government. There is a claim to be\r\nconsidered in the distribution of the means of happiness, and to share\r\nin the work of government as a means to this end. It would follow, among\r\nother things, that if one man or one class could be shown to be so much\r\nwiser and better than others that his or their rule would, in fact,\r\nconduce more to the happiness of the greater number than a popular\r\nsystem, then the business of government ought to be entrusted to that\r\nman or that class and no one else ought to interfere with it.\r\n\r\nThe whole argument, however, implies a crude view of the problem of\r\ngovernment. It is, of course, theoretically possible that a question\r\nshould present itself, detached from other questions, in which a\r\ndefinite measurable interest of each of the seven millions or more of\r\nvoters is at stake. For example, the great majority of English people\r\ndrink tea. Comparatively few drink wine. Should a particular sum be\r\nraised by a duty on tea or on wine? Here the majority of tea-drinkers\r\nhave a measurable interest, the same in kind and roughly the same in\r\ndegree for each; and the vote of the majority, if it could be taken on\r\nthis question alone and based on self-interest alone, might be conceived\r\nwithout absurdity as representing a sum of individual interests. Even\r\nhere, however, observe that, though the greatest number is considered,\r\nthe greatest happiness does not fare so well. For to raise the same sum\r\nthe tax on wine will, as less is drunk, have to be much larger than the\r\ntax on tea, so that a little gain to many tea-drinkers might inflict a\r\nheavy loss on the few wine-drinkers, and on the Benthamite principle it\r\nis not clear that this would be just. In point of fact it is possible\r\nfor a majority to act tyrannically, by insisting on a slight convenience\r\nto itself at the expense, perhaps, of real suffering to a minority. Now\r\nthe Utilitarian principle by no means justifies such tyranny, but it\r\ndoes seem to contemplate the weighing of one man's loss against\r\nanother's gain, and such a method of balancing does not at bottom\r\ncommend itself to our sense of justice. We may lay down that if there is\r\na rational social order at all it must be one which never rests the\r\nessential indispensable condition of the happiness of one man on the\r\nunavoidable misery of another, nor the happiness of forty millions of\r\nmen on the misery of one. It may be temporarily expedient, but it is\r\neternally unjust, that one man should die for the people.\r\n\r\nWe may go further. The case of the contemplated tax is, as applied to\r\nthe politics of a modern State, an unreal one. Political questions\r\ncannot be thus isolated. Even if we could vote by referendum on a\r\nspecial tax, the question which voters would have to consider would\r\nnever be the revenue from and the incidence of that tax alone. All the\r\nindirect social and economic bearings of the tax would come up for\r\nconsideration, and in the illustration chosen people would be swayed,\r\nand rightly swayed, by their opinion, for example, of the comparative\r\neffects of tea-drinking and wine-drinking. No one element of the social\r\nlife stands separate from the rest, any more than any one element of the\r\nanimal body stands separate from the rest. In this sense the life of\r\nsociety is rightly held to be organic, and all considered public policy\r\nmust be conceived in its bearing on the life of society as a whole. But\r\nthe moment that we apply this view to politics, the Benthamite mode of\r\nstating the case for democracy is seen to be insufficient. The interests\r\nof every man are no doubt in the end bound up with the welfare of the\r\nwhole community, but the relation is infinitely subtle and indirect.\r\nMoreover, it takes time to work itself out, and the evil that is done in\r\nthe present day may only bear fruit when the generation that has done it\r\nhas passed away. Thus, the direct and calculable benefit of the majority\r\nmay by no means coincide with the ultimate good of society as a whole;\r\nand to suppose that the majority must, on grounds of self-interest,\r\ngovern in the interests of the community as a whole is in reality to\r\nattribute to the mass of men full insight into problems which tax the\r\nhighest efforts of science and of statesmanship. Lastly, to suppose that\r\nmen are governed entirely by a sense of their interests is a many-sided\r\nfallacy. Men are neither so intelligent nor so selfish. They are swayed\r\nby emotion and by impulse, and both for good and for evil they will lend\r\nenthusiastic support to courses of public policy from which, as\r\nindividuals, they have nothing to gain. To understand the real value of\r\ndemocratic government, we shall have to probe far deeper into the\r\nrelations of the individual and society.\r\n\r\nI turn lastly to the question of liberty. On Benthamite principles there\r\ncould be no question here of indefeasible individual right. There were\r\neven, as we saw, possibilities of a thorough-going Socialism or of an\r\nauthoritarian paternalism in the Benthamite principle. But two great\r\nconsiderations told in the opposite direction. One arose from the\r\ncircumstances of the day. Bentham, originally a man of somewhat\r\nconservative temper, was driven into Radicalism comparatively late in\r\nlife by the indifference or hostility of the governing classes to his\r\nschemes of reform. Government, as he saw it, was of the nature of a\r\nclose corporation with a vested interest hostile to the public weal, and\r\nhis work is penetrated by distrust of power as such. There was much in\r\nthe history of the time to justify his attitude. It was difficult at\r\nthat time to believe in an honest officialdom putting the commonwealth\r\nabove every personal or corporate interest, and reformers naturally\r\nlooked to individual initiative as the source of progress. Secondly,\r\nand this was a more philosophic argument, the individual was supposed to\r\nunderstand his own interest best, and as the common good was the sum of\r\nindividual interests, it followed that so far as every man was free to\r\nseek his own good, the good of the greatest number would be most\r\neffectually realized by general freedom of choice. That there were\r\ndifficulties in reconciling self-interest with the general good was not\r\ndenied. But men like James Mill, who especially worked at this side of\r\nthe problem, held that they could be overcome by moral education.\r\nTrained from childhood to associate the good of others with his own, a\r\nman would come, he thought, to care for the happiness of others as for\r\nthe happiness of self. For, in the long run, the two things were\r\ncoincident. Particularly in a free economic system, as remarked above,\r\neach individual, moving along the line of greatest personal profit,\r\nwould be found to fulfil the function of greatest profit to society. Let\r\nthis be understood, and we should have true social harmony based on the\r\nspontaneous operation of personal interest enlightened by intelligence\r\nand chastened by the discipline of unruly instinct.\r\n\r\nThus, though their starting-point was different, the Benthamites arrived\r\nat practical results not notably divergent from those of the doctrine of\r\nnatural liberty; and, on the whole, the two influences worked together\r\nin the formation of that school who in the reform period exercised so\r\nnotable an influence on English Liberalism, and to whose work we must\r\nnow turn.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _Cf._ the preamble to the Declaration of the Rights of Man by the\r\nFrench National Assembly in 1789. The Assembly lays down \"the natural,\r\ninalienable, and sacred rights of man,\" in order, among other things,\r\n\"that the acts of the legislative power and those of the executive\r\npower, being capable of being at every instant compared with the end of\r\nevery political institution, may be more respected accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n[5] The comparison of the Declaration of the Assembly in 1789 with that\r\nof the Convention in 1793 is full of interest, both for the points of\r\nagreement and difference, but would require a lengthy examination. I\r\nnote one or two points in passing.\r\n\r\n[6] Contrast 1793, Art. I: \"The end of society is the common happiness.\r\nGovernment is instituted to guarantee to man the enjoyment of his\r\nnatural and imprescriptible rights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n'LAISSEZ-FAIRE'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe school of Cobden is affiliated in general outlook both to the\r\ndoctrine of natural liberty and to the discipline of Bentham. It shared\r\nwith the Benthamites the thoroughly practical attitude dear to the\r\nEnglish mind. It has much less to say of natural rights than the French\r\ntheorists. On the other hand, it is saturated with the conviction that\r\nthe unfettered action of the individual is the mainspring of all\r\nprogress.[7] Its starting-point is economic. Trade is still in fetters.\r\nThe worst of the archaic internal restrictions have, indeed, been\r\nthrown off. But even here Cobden is active in the work of finally\r\nemancipating Manchester from manorial rights that have no place in the\r\nnineteenth century. The main work, however, is the liberation of foreign\r\ntrade. The Corn Laws, as even the tariff reformers of our own day admit,\r\nwere conceived in the interest of the governing classes. They frankly\r\nimposed a tax on the food of the masses for the benefit of the\r\nlandlords, and as the result of the agricultural and industrial\r\nrevolutions which had been in progress since 1760, the masses had been\r\nbrought to the lowest point of economic misery. Give to every man the\r\nright to buy in the cheapest and sell in the dearest market, urged the\r\nCobdenite, and trade would automatically expand. The business career\r\nwould be open to the talents. The good workman would command the full\r\nmoney's worth of his work, and his money would buy him food and clothing\r\nat the lowest rate in the world's market. Only so would he get the full\r\nvalue of his work, paying toll to none. Taxes there must be to carry on\r\ngovernment, but if we looked into the cost of government we found that\r\nit depended mostly on armaments. Why did we need armaments? First,\r\nbecause of the national antagonisms aroused and maintained by a\r\nprotective system. Free commercial intercourse between nations would\r\nengender mutual knowledge, and knit the severed peoples by countless\r\nties of business interests. Free Trade meant peace, and once taught by\r\nthe example of Great Britain's prosperity, other nations would follow\r\nsuit, and Free Trade would be universal. The other root of national\r\ndanger was the principle of intervention. We took it on ourselves to set\r\nother nations right. How could we judge for other nations? Force was no\r\nremedy. Let every people be free to work out its own salvation. Things\r\nwere not so perfect with us that we need go about setting the houses of\r\nother people in order. To complete personal freedom, there must be\r\nnational freedom. There must also be colonial freedom. The colonies\r\ncould no longer be governed in the interests of the mother country, nor\r\nought they to require standing garrisons maintained by the mother\r\ncountry. They were distant lands, each, if we gave it freedom, with a\r\ngreat future of its own, capable of protecting itself, and developing\r\nwith freedom into true nationhood. Personal freedom, colonial freedom,\r\ninternational freedom, were parts of one whole. Non-intervention, peace,\r\nrestriction of armaments, retrenchment of expenditure, reduction of\r\ntaxation, were the connected series of practical consequences. The money\r\nretrenched from wasteful military expenditure need not all be remitted\r\nto the taxpayer. A fraction of it devoted to education--free, secular,\r\nand universal--would do as much good as when spent on guns and ships it\r\ndid harm. For education was necessary to raise the standard of\r\nintelligence, and provide the substantial equality of opportunity at the\r\nstart without which the mass of men could not make use of the freedom\r\ngiven by the removal of legislative restrictions. There were here\r\nelements of a more constructive view for which Cobden and his friends\r\nhave not always received sufficient credit.\r\n\r\nIn the main, however, the teaching of the Manchester school tended both\r\nin external and in internal affairs to a restricted view of the function\r\nof government. Government had to maintain order, to restrain men from\r\nviolence and fraud, to hold them secure in person and property against\r\nforeign and domestic enemies, to give them redress against injury, that\r\nso they may rely on reaping where they have sown, may enjoy the fruits\r\nof their industry, may enter unimpeded into what arrangements they will\r\nwith one another for their mutual benefit. Let us see what criticism was\r\npassed on this view by the contemporaries of Cobden and by the loud\r\nvoice of the facts themselves. The old economic régime had been in decay\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century. The divorce of the labourer from the\r\nland was complete at the time when the Anti-Corn Law League was formed.\r\nThe mass of the English peasantry were landless labourers working for a\r\nweekly wage of about ten or twelve shillings, and often for a good deal\r\nless. The rise of machine industry since 1760 had destroyed the old\r\ndomestic system and reduced the operative in the towns to the position\r\nof a factory hand under an employer, who found the road to wealth easy\r\nin the monopoly of manufacture enjoyed by this country for two\r\ngenerations after the Napoleonic war. The factory system early brought\r\nmatters to a head at one point by the systematic employment of women and\r\nyoung children under conditions which outraged the public conscience\r\nwhen they became known. In the case of children it was admitted from an\r\nearly date, it was urged by Cobden himself, that the principle of free\r\ncontract could not apply. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that the\r\nadult could make a better bargain for himself or herself than any one\r\ncould do for him or her, no one could contend that the pauper child\r\napprenticed by Poor Law guardians to a manufacturer had any say or could\r\nhave any judgment as to the work which it was set to do. It had to be\r\nprotected, and experience showed that it had to be protected by law.\r\nFree contract did not solve the question of the helpless child. It left\r\nit to be \"exploited\" by the employer in his own interest, and whatever\r\nregard might be shown for its health and well-being by individuals was a\r\nmatter of individual benevolence, not a right secured by the necessary\r\noperation of the system of liberty.\r\n\r\nBut these arguments admitted of great extension. If the child was\r\nhelpless, was the grown-up person, man or woman, in a much better\r\nposition? Here was the owner of a mill employing five hundred hands.\r\nHere was an operative possessed of no alternative means of subsistence\r\nseeking employment. Suppose them to bargain as to terms. If the bargain\r\nfailed, the employer lost one man and had four hundred and ninety-nine\r\nto keep his mill going. At worst he might for a day or two, until\r\nanother operative appeared, have a little difficulty in working a single\r\nmachine. During the same days the operative might have nothing to eat,\r\nand might see his children going hungry. Where was the effective liberty\r\nin such an arrangement? The operatives themselves speedily found that\r\nthere was none, and had from an early period in the rise of the machine\r\nindustry sought to redress the balance by combination. Now, combination\r\nwas naturally disliked by employers, and it was strongly suspect to\r\nbelievers in liberty because it put constraint upon individuals. Yet\r\ntrade unions gained the first step in emancipation through the action of\r\nPlace and the Radicals in 1824, more perhaps because these men conceived\r\ntrade unions as the response of labour to oppressive laws which true\r\nfreedom of competition would render superfluous than because they\r\nfounded any serious hopes of permanent social progress upon Trade\r\nUnionism itself. In point of fact, the critical attitude was not without\r\nits justification. Trade Unionism can be protective in spirit and\r\noppressive in action. Nevertheless, it was essential to the maintenance\r\nof their industrial standard by the artisan classes, because it alone,\r\nin the absence of drastic legislative protection, could do something to\r\nredress the inequality between employer and employed. It gave, upon the\r\nwhole, far more freedom to the workman than it took away, and in this we\r\nlearn an important lesson which has far wider application. In the matter\r\nof contract true freedom postulates substantial equality between the\r\nparties. In proportion as one party is in a position of vantage, he is\r\nable to dictate his terms. In proportion as the other party is in a weak\r\nposition, he must accept unfavourable terms. Hence the truth of Walker's\r\ndictum that economic injuries tend to perpetuate themselves. The more a\r\nclass is brought low, the greater its difficulty in rising again without\r\nassistance. For purposes of legislation the State has been exceedingly\r\nslow to accept this view. It began, as we saw, with the child, where\r\nthe case was overwhelming. It went on to include the \"young person\" and\r\nthe woman--not without criticism from those who held by woman's rights,\r\nand saw in this extension of tutelage an enlargement of male domination.\r\nBe that as it may, public opinion was brought to this point by the\r\nbelief that it was intervening in an exceptional manner to protect a\r\ndefinite class not strong enough to bargain for itself. It drew the line\r\nat the adult male; and it is only within our own time, and as the result\r\nof a controversy waged for many years within the trade union world\r\nitself, that legislation has avowedly undertaken the task of controlling\r\nthe conditions of industry, the hours, and at length, through the\r\ninstitution of Wages Boards in \"sweated industries,\" the actual\r\nremuneration of working people without limitation of age or sex. To this\r\nit has been driven by the manifest teaching of experience that liberty\r\nwithout equality is a name of noble sound and squalid result.\r\n\r\nIn place of the system of unfettered agreements between individual and\r\nindividual which the school of Cobden contemplated, the industrial\r\nsystem which has actually grown up and is in process of further\r\ndevelopment rests on conditions prescribed by the State, and within the\r\nlimits of those conditions is very largely governed by collective\r\narrangements between associations of employers and employed. The law\r\nprovides for the safety of the worker and the sanitary conditions of\r\nemployment. It prescribes the length of the working day for women and\r\nchildren in factories and workshops, and for men in mines and on\r\nrailways.[8] In the future it will probably deal freely with the hours\r\nof men. It enables wages boards to establish a legal minimum wage in\r\nscheduled industries which will undoubtedly grow in number. It makes\r\nemployers liable for all injuries suffered by operatives in the course\r\nof their employment, and forbids any one to \"contract out\" of this\r\nobligation. Within these limits, it allows freedom of contract. But at\r\nthis point, in the more highly developed trades, the work is taken up by\r\nvoluntary associations. Combinations of men have been met by\r\ncombinations of employers, and wages, hours, and all the details of the\r\nindustrial bargain are settled by collective agreement through the\r\nagency of a joint board with an impartial chairman or referee in case of\r\nnecessity for an entire locality and even an entire trade. So far have\r\nwe gone from the free competition of isolated individuals.\r\n\r\nThis development is sometimes held to have involved the decay and death\r\nof the older Liberalism. It is true that in the beginning factory\r\nlegislation enjoyed a large measure of Conservative support. It was at\r\nthat stage in accordance with the best traditions of paternal rule, and\r\nit commended itself to the religious convictions of men of whom Lord\r\nShaftesbury was the typical example. It is true, also, that it was\r\nbitterly opposed by Cobden and Bright. On the other hand, Radicals like\r\nJ. Cam Hobhouse took a leading part in the earlier legislation, and Whig\r\nGovernments passed the very important Acts of 1833 and 1847. The\r\ncleavage of opinion, in fact, cut across the ordinary divisions of\r\nparty. What is more to the purpose is that, as experience ripened, the\r\nimplications of the new legislation became clearer, and men came to see\r\nthat by industrial control they were not destroying liberty but\r\nconfirming it. A new and more concrete conception of liberty arose and\r\nmany old presuppositions were challenged.\r\n\r\nLet us look for a moment at these presuppositions. We have seen that the\r\ntheory of _laissez-faire_ assumed that the State would hold the ring.\r\nThat is to say, it would suppress force and fraud, keep property safe,\r\nand aid men in enforcing contracts. On these conditions, it was\r\nmaintained, men should be absolutely free to compete with one another,\r\nso that their best energies should be called forth, so that each should\r\nfeel himself responsible for the guidance of his own life, and exert his\r\nmanhood to the utmost. But why, it might be asked, on these conditions,\r\njust these and no others? Why should the State ensure protection of\r\nperson and property? The time was when the strong man armed kept his\r\ngoods, and incidentally his neighbour's goods too if he could get hold\r\nof them. Why should the State intervene to do for a man that which his\r\nancestor did for himself? Why should a man who has been soundly beaten\r\nin physical fight go to a public authority for redress? How much more\r\nmanly to fight his own battle! Was it not a kind of pauperization to\r\nmake men secure in person and property through no efforts of their own,\r\nby the agency of a state machinery operating over their heads? Would not\r\na really consistent individualism abolish this machinery? \"But,\" the\r\nadvocate of _laissez-faire_ may reply, \"the use of force is criminal,\r\nand the State must suppress crime.\" So men held in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. But there was an earlier time when they did not take this view,\r\nbut left it to individuals and their kinsfolk to revenge their own\r\ninjuries by their own might. Was not this a time of more unrestricted\r\nindividual liberty? Yet the nineteenth century regarded it, and justly,\r\nas an age of barbarism. What, we may ask in our turn, is the essence of\r\ncrime? May we not say that any intentional injury to another may be\r\nlegitimately punished by a public authority, and may we not say that to\r\nimpose twelve hours' daily labour on a child was to inflict a greater\r\ninjury than the theft of a purse for which a century ago a man might be\r\nhanged? On what principle, then, is the line drawn, so as to specify\r\ncertain injuries which the State may prohibit and to mark off others\r\nwhich it must leave untouched? Well, it may be said, _volenti non fit\r\ninjuria_. No wrong is done to a man by a bargain to which he is a\r\nwilling party. That may be, though there are doubtful cases. But in the\r\nfield that has been in question the contention is that one party is not\r\nwilling. The bargain is a forced bargain. The weaker man consents as one\r\nslipping over a precipice might consent to give all his fortune to one\r\nwho will throw him a rope on no other terms. This is not true consent.\r\nTrue consent is free consent, and full freedom of consent implies\r\nequality on the part of both parties to the bargain. Just as government\r\nfirst secured the elements of freedom for all when it prevented the\r\nphysically stronger man from slaying, beating, despoiling his\r\nneighbours, so it secures a larger measure of freedom for all by every\r\nrestriction which it imposes with a view to preventing one man from\r\nmaking use of any of his advantages to the disadvantage of others.\r\n\r\nThere emerges a distinction between unsocial and social freedom.\r\nUnsocial freedom is the right of a man to use his powers without regard\r\nto the wishes or interests of any one but himself. Such freedom is\r\ntheoretically possible for an individual. It is antithetic to all public\r\ncontrol. It is theoretically impossible for a plurality of individuals\r\nliving in mutual contact. Socially it is a contradiction, unless the\r\ndesires of all men were automatically attuned to social ends. Social\r\nfreedom, then, for any epoch short of the millennium rests on restraint.\r\nIt is a freedom that can be enjoyed by all the members of a community,\r\nand it is the freedom to choose among those lines of activity which do\r\nnot involve injury to others. As experience of the social effects of\r\naction ripens, and as the social conscience is awakened, the conception\r\nof injury is widened and insight into its causes is deepened. The area\r\nof restraint is therefore increased. But, inasmuch as injury inflicted\r\nis itself crippling to the sufferer, as it lowers his health, confines\r\nhis life, cramps his powers, so the prevention of such injury sets him\r\nfree. The restraint of the aggressor is the freedom of the sufferer, and\r\nonly by restraint on the actions by which men injure one another do they\r\nas a whole community gain freedom in all courses of conduct that can be\r\npursued without ultimate social disharmony.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, a very shallow wit that taunts contemporary Liberalism\r\nwith inconsistency in opposing economic protection while it supports\r\nprotective legislation for the manual labourer. The two things have\r\nnothing in common but that they are restraints intended to operate in\r\nthe interests of somebody. The one is a restraint which, in the Liberal\r\nview, would operate in favour of certain industries and interests to the\r\nprejudice of others, and, on the whole, in favour of those who are\r\nalready more fortunately placed and against the poorer classes. The\r\nother is a restraint conceived in the interest primarily of the poorer\r\nclasses with the object of securing to them a more effective freedom and\r\na nearer approach to equality of conditions in industrial relations.\r\nThere is point in the argument only for those who conceive liberty as\r\nopposed to restraint as such. For those who understand that all social\r\nliberty rests upon restraint, that restraint of one man in one respect\r\nis the condition of the freedom of other men in that respect, the taunt\r\nhas no meaning whatever. The liberty which is good is not the liberty of\r\none gained at the expense of others, but the liberty which can be\r\nenjoyed by all who dwell together, and this liberty depends on and is\r\nmeasured by the completeness with which by law, custom, or their own\r\nfeelings they are restrained from mutual injury.\r\n\r\nIndividualism, as ordinarily understood, not only takes the policeman\r\nand the law court for granted. It also takes the rights of property for\r\ngranted. But what is meant by the rights of property? In ordinary use\r\nthe phrase means just that system to which long usage has accustomed us.\r\nThis is a system under which a man is free to acquire by any method of\r\nproduction or exchange within the limits of the law whatever he can of\r\nland, consumable goods, or capital; to dispose of it at his own will and\r\npleasure for his own purposes, to destroy it if he likes, to give it\r\naway or sell it as it suits him, and at death to bequeath it to\r\nwhomsoever he will. The State, it is admitted, can take a part of a\r\nman's property by taxation. For the State is a necessity, and men must\r\npay a price for security; but in all taxation the State on this view is\r\ntaking something from a man which is \"his,\" and in so doing is justified\r\nonly by necessity. It has no \"right\" to deprive the individual of\r\nanything that is his in order to promote objects of its own which are\r\nnot necessary to the common order. To do so is to infringe individual\r\nrights and make a man contribute by force to objects which he may view\r\nwith indifference or even with dislike. \"Socialistic\" taxation is an\r\ninfringement of individual freedom, the freedom to hold one's own and do\r\nas one will with one's own. Such seems to be the ordinary view.\r\n\r\nBut a consistent theory of liberty could not rest wholly satisfied with\r\nthe actual system under which property is held. The first point of\r\nattack, already pressed by the disciples of Cobden, was the barrier to\r\nfree exchange in the matter of land. It was not and still is not easy\r\nfor the landless to acquire land, and in the name of free contract\r\nCobden and his disciples pressed for cheap and unimpeded transfer. But a\r\nmore searching criticism was possible. Land is limited in amount,\r\ncertain kinds of land very narrowly limited. Where there is limitation\r\nof supply monopoly is always possible, and against monopoly the\r\nprinciples of free competition declared war. To Cobden himself, free\r\ntrade in land was the pendant to free trade in goods. But the attack on\r\nthe land monopoly could be carried much further, and might lead the\r\nindividualist who was in earnest about his principles to march a\r\ncertain distance on parallel lines with the Socialist enemy. This has,\r\nin fact, occurred in the school of Henry George. This school holds by\r\ncompetition, but by competition only on the basis of a genuine freedom\r\nand equality for all individuals. To secure this basis, it would purge\r\nthe social system of all elements of monopoly, of which the private\r\nownership of land is in its view the most important. This object, it\r\nmaintains, can be secured only through the absorption by the State of\r\nall elements of monopoly value. Now, monopoly value accrues whenever\r\nanything of worth to men of which the supply is limited falls into\r\nprivate hands. In this case competition fails. There is no check upon\r\nthe owner except the limitations of demand. He can exact a price which\r\nbears no necessary relation to the cost of any effort of his own. In\r\naddition to normal wages and profits, he can extract from the\r\nnecessities of others a surplus, to which the name of economic rent is\r\ngiven. He can also hold up his property and refuse to allow others to\r\nmake use of it until the time when its full value has accrued, thereby\r\nincreasing the rent which he will ultimately receive at the cost of\r\nmuch loss in the interim to society.\r\n\r\nMonopolies in our country fall into three classes. There is, first, the\r\nmonopoly of land. Urban rents, for example, represent not merely the\r\ncost of building, nor the cost of building plus the site, as it would be\r\nif sites of the kind required were unlimited in amount. They represent\r\nthe cost of a site where the supply falls short of the demand, that is\r\nto say, where there is an element of monopoly. And site value--the\r\nelement in the actual cost of a house or factory that depends on its\r\nposition--varies directly with the degree of this monopoly. This value\r\nthe land nationalizer contends is not created by the owner. It is\r\ncreated by society. In part it is due to the general growth of the\r\ncountry to which the increase of population and the rise of town life is\r\nto be attributed. In part it depends on the growth of the particular\r\nlocality, and in part on the direct expenditure of the ratepayers' money\r\nin sanitation and other improvements which make the place one where\r\npeople can live and industry can thrive. Directly and indirectly, the\r\ncommunity creates the site value. The landlord receives it, and,\r\nreceiving it, can charge any one who wants to live or carry on industry\r\nupon the site with rent to the full amount. The land-nationalizer,\r\nlooking at rights of property purely from the point of view of the\r\nindividual, denies the justice of this arrangement, and he sees no\r\nsolution except this--that the monopoly value should pass back to the\r\ncommunity which creates it. Accordingly, he favours the taxation of site\r\nvalue to its full amount. Another element of monopoly arises from\r\nindustries in which competition is inapplicable--the supply of gas and\r\nwater, for example, a tramway service, and in some conditions a railway\r\nservice. Here competition may be wasteful if not altogether impossible;\r\nand here again, on the lines of a strictly consistent individualism, if\r\nthe industry is allowed to fall into private hands the owners will be\r\nable to secure something more than the normal profits of competitive\r\nindustry. They will profit by monopoly at the expense of the general\r\nconsumer, and the remedy is public control or public ownership. The\r\nlatter is the more complete and efficacious remedy, and it is also the\r\nremedy of municipal socialism. Lastly, there may be forms of monopoly\r\ncreated by the State, such as the sale of liquor as restricted by the\r\nlicensing system. In accordance with competitive ideas the value so\r\ncreated ought not to pass into private hands, and if on social grounds\r\nthe monopoly is maintained, the taxation of licensed premises ought to\r\nbe so arranged that the monopoly value returns to the community.\r\n\r\nUp to this point a thoroughly consistent individualism can work in\r\nharmony with socialism, and it is this partial alliance which has, in\r\nfact, laid down the lines of later Liberal finance. The great Budget of\r\n1909 had behind it the united forces of Socialist and individualist\r\nopinion. It may be added that there is a fourth form of monopoly which\r\nwould be open to the same double attack, but it is one of which less has\r\nbeen heard in Great Britain than in the United States. It is possible\r\nunder a competitive system for rivals to come to an agreement. The more\r\npowerful may coerce the weaker, or a number of equals may agree to work\r\ntogether. Thus competition may defeat itself, and industry may be\r\nmarshalled into trusts or other combinations for the private advantage\r\nagainst the public interest. Such combinations, predicted by Karl Marx\r\nas the appointed means of dissolving the competitive system, have been\r\nkept at bay in this country by Free Trade. Under Protection they\r\nconstitute the most urgent problem of the day. Even here the railways,\r\nto take one example, are rapidly moving to a system of combination, the\r\neconomies of which are obvious, while its immediate result is monopoly,\r\nand its assured end is nationalization.\r\n\r\nThus individualism, when it grapples with the facts, is driven no small\r\ndistance along Socialist lines. Once again we have found that to\r\nmaintain individual freedom and equality we have to extend the sphere of\r\nsocial control. But to carry through the real principles of Liberalism,\r\nto achieve social liberty and living equality of rights, we shall have\r\nto probe still deeper. We must not assume any of the rights of property\r\nas axiomatic. We must look at their actual working and consider how they\r\naffect the life of society. We shall have to ask whether, if we could\r\nabolish all monopoly on articles of limited supply, we should yet have\r\ndealt with all the causes that contribute to social injustice and\r\nindustrial disorder, whether we should have rescued the sweated worker,\r\nafforded to every man adequate security for a fair return for an honest\r\nday's toil, and prevented the use of economic advantage to procure gain\r\nfor one man at the expense of another. We should have to ask whether we\r\nhad the basis of a just delimitation between the rights of the community\r\nand those of the individual, and therewith a due appreciation of the\r\nappropriate ends of the State and the equitable basis of taxation. These\r\ninquiries take us to first principles, and to approach that part of our\r\ndiscussion it is desirable to carry further our sketch of the historic\r\ndevelopment of Liberalism in thought and action.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] \"If I were asked to sum up in a sentence the difference and the\r\nconnection (between the two schools) I would say that the Manchester men\r\nwere the disciples of Adam Smith and Bentham, while the Philosophical\r\nRadicals followed Bentham and Adam Smith\" (F. W. Hirst, _The Manchester\r\nSchool_, Introd., p. xi). Lord Morley, in the concluding chapter of his\r\n_Life of Cobden_, points out that it was the view of \"policy as a whole\"\r\nin connection with the economic movement of society which distinguished\r\nthe school of Cobden from that of the Benthamites.\r\n\r\n[8] Indirectly it has for long limited the hours of men in factories\r\nowing to the interdependence of the adult male with the female and child\r\noperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGLADSTONE AND MILL\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the nineteenth century two great names stand out in\r\nthe history of British Liberalism--that of Gladstone in the world of\r\naction, that of Mill in the world of thought. Differing in much, they\r\nagreed in one respect. They had the supreme virtue of keeping their\r\nminds fresh and open to new ideas, and both of them in consequence\r\nadvanced to a deeper interpretation of social life as they grew older.\r\nIn 1846 Gladstone ranked as a Conservative, but he parted from his old\r\ntraditions under the leadership of Peel on the question of Free Trade,\r\nand for many years to come the most notable of his public services lay\r\nin the completion of the Cobdenite policy of financial emancipation. In\r\nthe pursuit of this policy he was brought into collision with the House\r\nof Lords, and it was his active intervention in 1859-60 which saved the\r\nCommons from a humiliating surrender, and secured its financial\r\nsupremacy unimpaired until 1909. In the following decade he stood for\r\nthe extension of the suffrage, and it was his Government which, in 1884,\r\ncarried the extension of the representative principle to the point at\r\nwhich it rested twenty-seven years later. In economics Gladstone kept\r\nupon the whole to the Cobdenite principles which he acquired in middle\r\nlife. He was not sympathetically disposed to the \"New Unionism\" and the\r\nsemi-socialistic ideas that came at the end of the 'eighties, which, in\r\nfact, constituted a powerful cross current to the political work that he\r\nhad immediately in hand. Yet in relation to Irish land he entered upon a\r\nnew departure which threw over freedom of contract in a leading case\r\nwhere the two parties were on glaringly unequal terms. No abstract\r\nthinker, he had a passion for justice in the concrete which was capable\r\nof carrying him far. He knew tyranny when he saw it, and upon it he\r\nwaged unremitting and many-sided war.\r\n\r\nBut his most original work was done in the sphere of imperial relations.\r\nThe maligned Majuba settlement was an act of justice which came too\r\nlate to effect a permanent undoing of mischief. All the greater was the\r\ncourage of the statesman who could throw himself at that time upon the\r\ninherent force of national liberty and international fair dealing. In\r\nthe case of Ireland Gladstone again relied on the same principles, but\r\nanother force was necessary to carry the day, a force which no man can\r\ncommand, the force of time. In international dealings generally\r\nGladstone was a pioneer. His principle was not precisely that of Cobden.\r\nHe was not a non-interventionist. He took action on behalf of Greece,\r\nand would have done so on behalf of the Armenians, to save the national\r\nhonour and prevent a monstrous wrong. The Gladstonian principle may be\r\ndefined by antithesis to that of Machiavelli, and to that of Bismarck,\r\nand to the practice of every Foreign Office. As that practice proceeds\r\non the principle that reasons of State justify everything, so Gladstone\r\nproceeded on the principle that reasons of State justify nothing that is\r\nnot justified already by the human conscience. The statesman is for him\r\na man charged with maintaining not only the material interests but the\r\nhonour of his country. He is a citizen of the world in that he\r\nrepresents his nation, which is a member of the community of the world.\r\nHe has to recognize rights and duties, as every representative of every\r\nother human organization has to recognize rights and duties. There is no\r\nline drawn beyond which human obligations cease. There is no gulf across\r\nwhich the voice of human suffering cannot be heard, beyond which\r\nmassacre and torture cease to be execrable. Simply as a patriot, again,\r\na man should recognize that a nation may become great not merely by\r\npainting the map red, or extending her commerce beyond all precedent,\r\nbut also as the champion of justice, the succourer of the oppressed, the\r\nestablished home of freedom. From the denunciation of the Opium War,\r\nfrom the exposure of the Neapolitan prisons, to his last appearance on\r\nthe morrow of the Constantinople massacre this was the message which\r\nGladstone sought to convey. He was before his time. He was not always\r\nable to maintain his principle in his own Cabinet, and on his retirement\r\nthe world appeared to relapse definitely into the older ways. His own\r\nparty gave itself up in large measure to opposite views. On the other\r\nhand, careful and unprejudiced criticism will recognize that the chief\r\nopponent of his old age, Lord Salisbury, had imbibed something of his\r\nspirit, and under its influence did much to save the country from the\r\nexcesses of Imperialism, while his follower, Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, used the brief term of his power to reverse the\r\npolicy of racial domination in South Africa and to prove the value of\r\nthe old Gladstonian trust in the recuperative force of political\r\nfreedom. It may be added that, if cynicism has since appeared to hold\r\nthe field in international politics, it is the cynicism of terror rather\r\nthan the cynicism of ambition. The Scare has superseded the Vision as\r\nthe moving force in our external relations, and there are now signs that\r\nthe Scare in turn has spent its force and is making room at last for\r\nSense.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, Gladstone was a moral rather than an intellectual\r\nforce. He raised the whole level of public life. By habitually calling\r\nupon what was best in men, he deepened the sense of public\r\nresponsibility and paved the way, half unconsciously, for the fuller\r\nexercise of the social conscience. Mill was also a moral force, and the\r\nmost persistent influence of his books is more an effect of character\r\nthan of intellect. But, in place of Gladstone's driving power and\r\npractical capacity, Mill had the qualities of a life-long learner, and\r\nin his single person he spans the interval between the old and the new\r\nLiberalism. Brought up on the pure milk of the Benthamite word, he never\r\ndefinitely abandoned the first principles of his father. But he was\r\nperpetually bringing them into contact with fresh experience and new\r\ntrains of thought, considering how they worked, and how they ought to be\r\nmodified in order to maintain what was really sound and valuable in\r\ntheir content. Hence, Mill is the easiest person in the world to convict\r\nof inconsistency, incompleteness, and lack of rounded system. Hence,\r\nalso, his work will survive the death of many consistent, complete, and\r\nperfectly rounded systems.\r\n\r\nAs a utilitarian, Mill cannot appeal to any rights of the individual\r\nthat can be set in opposition to the public welfare. His method is to\r\nshow that the permanent welfare of the public is bound up with the\r\nrights of the individual. Of course, there are occasions on which the\r\nimmediate expediency of the public would be met by ignoring personal\r\nrights. But if the rule of expediency were followed there would be\r\nneither right nor law at all. There would be no fixed rules in social\r\nlife, and nothing to which men could trust in guiding their conduct. For\r\nthe utilitarian, then, the question of right resolves itself into the\r\nquestion: What claim is it, in general and as a matter of principle,\r\nadvisable for society to recognize? What in any given relation are the\r\npermanent conditions of social health? In regard to liberty Mill's reply\r\nturns on the moral or spiritual forces which determine the life of\r\nsociety. First, particularly as regards freedom of thought and\r\ndiscussion, society needs light. Truth has a social value, and we are\r\nnever to suppose that we are in the possession of complete and final\r\ntruth. But truth is only to be sought by experience in the world of\r\nthought, and of action as well. In the process of experimentation there\r\nare endless opportunities of error, and the free search for truth\r\ntherefore involves friction and waste. The promulgation of error will do\r\nharm, a harm that might be averted if error were suppressed. But\r\nsuppression by any other means than those of rational suasion is one of\r\nthose remedies which cure the disease by killing the patient. It\r\nparalyzes the free search for truth. Not only so, but there is an\r\nelement of positive value in honest error which places it above\r\nmechanically accepted truth. So far as it is honest it springs from the\r\nspontaneous operation of the mind on the basis of some partial and\r\nincomplete experience. It is, so far as it goes, an interpretation of\r\nexperience, though a faulty one, whereas the belief imposed by authority\r\nis no interpretation of experience at all. It involves no personal\r\neffort. Its blind acceptance seals the resignation of the will and the\r\nintellect to effacement and stultification.\r\n\r\nThe argument on this side does not rest on human fallibility. It appeals\r\nin its full strength to those who are most confident that they possess\r\ntruth final and complete. They are asked to recognize that the way in\r\nwhich this truth must be communicated to others is not by material but\r\nby spiritual means, and that if they hold out physical threats as a\r\ndeterrent, or worldly advantage as a means of persuasion, they are\r\ndestroying not merely the fruits but the very root of truth as it grows\r\nwithin the human mind. Yet the argument receives additional force when\r\nwe consider the actual history of human belief. The candid man who knows\r\nanything of the movements of thought will recognize that even the faith\r\nwhich is most vital to him is something that has grown through the\r\ngenerations, and he may infer, if he is reasonable, that as it has grown\r\nin the past so, if it has the vital seed within it, it will grow in the\r\nfuture. It may be permanent in outline, but in content it will change.\r\nBut, if truth itself is an expanding circle of ideas that grows through\r\ncriticism and by modification, we need say no more as to the rough and\r\nimperfect apprehension of truth which constitutes the dominant opinion\r\nof society at any given moment. It needs little effort of detachment to\r\nappreciate the danger of any limitation of inquiry by the collective\r\nwill whether its organ be law or the repressive force of public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of liberty on this side, then, is the conception of\r\nthought as a growth dependent on spiritual laws, flourishing in the\r\nmovement of ideas as guided by experience, reflection and feeling,\r\ncorrupted by the intrusion of material considerations, slain by the\r\nguillotine of finality. The same conception is broadened out to cover\r\nthe whole idea of personality. Social well-being cannot be incompatible\r\nwith individual well-being. But individual well-being has as its\r\nfoundation the responsible life of the rational creature. Manhood, and\r\nMill would emphatically add womanhood too, rests on the spontaneous\r\ndevelopment of faculty. To find vent for the capacities of feeling, of\r\nemotion, of thought, of action, is to find oneself. The result is no\r\nanarchy. The self so found has as the pivot of its life the power of\r\ncontrol. To introduce some unity into life, some harmony into thought,\r\naction and feeling, is its central achievement, and to realize its\r\nrelation to others and guide its own life thereby, its noblest rule. But\r\nthe essential of control is that it should be self-control. Compulsion\r\nmay be necessary for the purposes of external order, but it adds nothing\r\nto the inward life that is the true being of man. It even threatens it\r\nwith loss of authority and infringes the sphere of its responsibility.\r\nIt is a means and not an end, and a means that readily becomes a danger\r\nto ends that are very vital. Under self-guidance individuals will\r\ndiverge widely, and some of their eccentricities will be futile, others\r\nwasteful, others even painful and abhorrent to witness. But, upon the\r\nwhole, it is good that they should differ. Individuality is an element\r\nof well-being, and that not only because it is the necessary consequence\r\nof self-government, but because, after all allowances for waste, the\r\ncommon life is fuller and richer for the multiplicity of types that it\r\nincludes, and that go to enlarge the area of collective experience. The\r\nlarger wrong done by the repression of women is not the loss to women\r\nthemselves who constitute one half of the community, but the\r\nimpoverishment of the community as a whole, the loss of all the elements\r\nin the common stock which the free play of the woman's mind would\r\ncontribute.\r\n\r\nSimilar principles underlie Mill's treatment of representative\r\ngovernment. If the adult citizen, male or female, has a right to vote,\r\nit is not so much as a means to the enforcement of his claims upon\r\nsociety, but rather as a means of enforcing his personal responsibility\r\nfor the actions of the community. The problem of character is the\r\ndetermining issue in the question of government. If men could be\r\nspoon-fed with happiness, a benevolent despotism would be the ideal\r\nsystem. If they are to take a part in working out their own salvation,\r\nthey must be summoned to their share in the task of directing the common\r\nlife. Carrying this principle further, Mill turned the edge of the\r\ncommon objection to the extension of the suffrage based on the ignorance\r\nand the irresponsibility of the voters. To learn anything men must\r\npractise. They must be trusted with more responsibility if they are to\r\nacquire the sense of responsibility. There were dangers in the process,\r\nbut there were greater dangers and there were fewer elements of hope as\r\nlong as the mass of the population was left outside the circle of civic\r\nrights and duties. The greatest danger that Mill saw in democracy was\r\nthat of the tyranny of the majority. He emphasized, perhaps more than\r\nany Liberal teacher before him, the difference between the desire of the\r\nmajority and the good of the community. He recognized that the different\r\nrights for which the Liberal was wont to plead might turn out in\r\npractice hard to reconcile with one another, that if personal liberty\r\nwere fundamental it might only be imperilled by a so-called political\r\nliberty which would give to the majority unlimited powers of coercion.\r\nHe was, therefore, for many years anxiously concerned with the means of\r\nsecuring a fair hearing and fair representation to minorities, and as a\r\npioneer of the movement for Proportional Representation he sought to\r\nmake Parliament the reflection not of a portion of the people, however\r\npreponderant numerically, but of the whole.\r\n\r\nOn the economic side of social life Mill recognized in principle the\r\nnecessity of controlling contract where the parties were not on equal\r\nterms, but his insistence on personal responsibility made him chary in\r\nextending the principle to grown-up persons, and his especial attachment\r\nto the cause of feminine emancipation led him to resist the tide of\r\nfeeling which was, in fact, securing the first elements of emancipation\r\nfor the woman worker. He trusted at the outset of his career to the\r\nelevation of the standard of comfort as the best means of improving the\r\nposition of the wage-earner, and in this elevation he regarded the\r\nlimitation of the family as an essential condition. As he advanced in\r\nlife, however, he became more and more dissatisfied with the whole\r\nstructure of a system which left the mass of the population in the\r\nposition of wage-earners, while the minority lived on rents, profits,\r\nand the interest on invested capital. He came to look forward to a\r\nco-operative organization of society in which a man would learn to \"dig\r\nand weave for his country,\" as he now is prepared to fight for it, and\r\nin which the surplus products of industry would be distributed among the\r\nproducers. In middle life voluntary co-operation appeared to him the\r\nbest means to this end, but towards the close he recognized that his\r\nchange of views was such as, on the whole, to rank him with the\r\nSocialists, and the brief exposition of the Socialist ideal given in his\r\nAutobiography remains perhaps the best summary statement of Liberal\r\nSocialism that we possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE HEART OF LIBERALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Mill brings us close to the heart of Liberalism. We\r\nlearn from him, in the first place, that liberty is no mere formula of\r\nlaw, or of the restriction of law. There may be a tyranny of custom, a\r\ntyranny of opinion, even a tyranny of circumstance, as real as any\r\ntyranny of government and more pervasive. Nor does liberty rest on the\r\nself-assertion of the individual. There is scope abundant for Liberalism\r\nand illiberalism in personal conduct. Nor is liberty opposed to\r\ndiscipline, to organization, to strenuous conviction as to what is true\r\nand just. Nor is it to be identified with tolerance of opposed opinions.\r\nThe Liberal does not meet opinions which he conceives to be false with\r\ntoleration, as though they did not matter. He meets them with justice,\r\nand exacts for them a fair hearing as though they mattered just as much\r\nas his own. He is always ready to put his own convictions to the proof,\r\nnot because he doubts them, but because he believes in them. For, both\r\nas to that which he holds for true and as to that which he holds for\r\nfalse, he believes that one final test applies. Let error have free\r\nplay, and one of two things will happen. Either as it develops, as its\r\nimplications and consequences become clear, some elements of truth will\r\nappear within it. They will separate themselves out; they will go to\r\nenrich the stock of human ideas; they will add something to the truth\r\nwhich he himself mistakenly took as final; they will serve to explain\r\nthe root of the error; for error itself is generally a truth\r\nmisconceived, and it is only when it is explained that it is finally and\r\nsatisfactorily confuted. Or, in the alternative, no element of truth\r\nwill appear. In that case the more fully the error is understood, the\r\nmore patiently it is followed up in all the windings of its implications\r\nand consequences, the more thoroughly will it refute itself. The\r\ncancerous growth cannot be extirpated by the knife. The root is always\r\nleft, and it is only the evolution of the self-protecting anti-toxin\r\nthat works the final cure. Exactly parallel is the logic of truth. The\r\nmore the truth is developed in all its implications, the greater is the\r\nopportunity of detecting any element of error that it may contain; and,\r\nconversely, if no error appears, the more completely does it establish\r\nitself as the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Liberalism applies\r\nthe wisdom of Gamaliel in no spirit of indifference, but in the full\r\nconviction of the potency of truth. If this thing be of man, _i. e._ if\r\nit is not rooted in actual verity, it will come to nought. If it be of\r\nGod, let us take care that we be not found fighting against God.\r\n\r\nDivergences of opinion, of character, of conduct are not unimportant\r\nmatters. They may be most serious matters, and no one is called on in\r\nthe name of Liberalism to overlook their seriousness. There are, for\r\nexample, certain disqualifications inherent in the profession of certain\r\nopinions. It is not illiberal to recognize such disqualifications. It is\r\nnot illiberal for a Protestant in choosing a tutor for his son to reject\r\na conscientious Roman Catholic who avows that all his teaching is\r\ncentred on the doctrine of his Church. It would be illiberal to reject\r\nthe same man for the specific purpose of teaching arithmetic, if he\r\navowed that he had no intention of using his position for the purpose\r\nof religious propagandism. For the former purpose the divergence of\r\nreligious opinion is an inherent disqualification. It negates the object\r\npropounded, which is the general education of the boy on lines in which\r\nthe father believes. For the latter purpose the opinion is no\r\ndisqualification. The devout Catholic accepts the multiplication table,\r\nand can impart his knowledge without reference to the infallibility of\r\nthe Pope. To refuse to employ him is to impose an extraneous penalty on\r\nhis convictions. It is not illiberal for an editor to decline the\r\nservices of a member of the opposite party as a leader writer, or even\r\nas a political reviewer or in any capacity in which his opinions would\r\naffect his work. It is illiberal to reject him as a compositor or as a\r\nclerk, or in any capacity in which his opinions would not affect his\r\nwork for the paper. It is not illiberal to refuse a position of trust to\r\nthe man whose record shows that he is likely to abuse such a trust. It\r\nis illiberal--and this the \"moralist\" has yet to learn--to punish a man\r\nwho has done a wrong in one relation by excluding him from the\r\nperformance of useful social functions for which he is perfectly\r\nfitted, by which he could at once serve society and re-establish his own\r\nself-respect. There may, however, yet come a time when Liberalism,\r\nalready recognized as a duty in religion and in politics, will take its\r\ntrue place at the centre of our ethical conceptions, and will be seen to\r\nhave its application not only to him whom we conceive to be the teacher\r\nof false opinions, but to the man whom we hold a sinner.\r\n\r\nThe ground of Liberalism so understood is certainly not the view that a\r\nman's personal opinions are socially indifferent, nor that his personal\r\nmorality matters nothing to others. So far as Mill rested his case on\r\nthe distinction between self-regarding actions and actions that affect\r\nothers, he was still dominated by the older individualism. We should\r\nfrankly recognize that there is no side of a man's life which is\r\nunimportant to society, for whatever he is, does, or thinks may affect\r\nhis own well-being, which is and ought to be matter of common concern,\r\nand may also directly or indirectly affect the thought, action, and\r\ncharacter of those with whom he comes in contact. The underlying\r\nprinciple may be put in two ways. In the first place, the man is much\r\nmore than his opinions and his actions. Carlyle and Sterling did not\r\ndiffer \"except in opinion.\" To most of us that is just what difference\r\nmeans. Carlyle was aware that there was something much deeper, something\r\nthat opinion just crassly formulates, and for the most part formulates\r\ninadequately, that is the real man. The real man is something more than\r\nis ever adequately expressed in terms which his fellows can understand;\r\nand just as his essential humanity lies deeper than all distinctions of\r\nrank, and class, and colour, and even, though in a different sense, of\r\nsex, so also it goes far below those comparatively external events which\r\nmake one man figure as a saint and another as a criminal. This sense of\r\nultimate oneness is the real meaning of equality, as it is the\r\nfoundation of social solidarity and the bond which, if genuinely\r\nexperienced, resists the disruptive force of all conflict, intellectual,\r\nreligious, and ethical.\r\n\r\nBut, further, while personal opinions and social institutions are like\r\ncrystallized results, achievements that have been won by certain\r\ndefinite processes of individual or collective effort, human personality\r\nis that within which lives and grows, which can be destroyed but cannot\r\nbe made, which cannot be taken to pieces and repaired, but can be placed\r\nunder conditions in which it will flourish and expand, or, if it is\r\ndiseased, under conditions in which it will heal itself by its own\r\nrecuperative powers. The foundation of liberty is the idea of growth.\r\nLife is learning, but whether in theory or practice what a man genuinely\r\nlearns is what he absorbs, and what he absorbs depends on the energy\r\nwhich he himself puts forth in response to his surroundings. Thus, to\r\ncome at once to the real crux, the question of moral discipline, it is\r\nof course possible to reduce a man to order and prevent him from being a\r\nnuisance to his neighbours by arbitrary control and harsh punishment.\r\nThis may be to the comfort of the neighbours, as is admitted, but\r\nregarded as a moral discipline it is a contradiction in terms. It is\r\ndoing less than nothing for the character of the man himself. It is\r\nmerely crushing him, and unless his will is killed the effect will be\r\nseen if ever the superincumbent pressure is by chance removed. It is\r\nalso possible, though it takes a much higher skill, to teach the same\r\nman to discipline himself, and this is to foster the development of\r\nwill, of personality, of self control, or whatever we please to call\r\nthat central harmonizing power which makes us capable of directing our\r\nown lives. Liberalism is the belief that society can safely be founded\r\non this self-directing power of personality, that it is only on this\r\nfoundation that a true community can be built, and that so established\r\nits foundations are so deep and so wide that there is no limit that we\r\ncan place to the extent of the building. Liberty then becomes not so\r\nmuch a right of the individual as a necessity of society. It rests not\r\non the claim of A to be let alone by B, but on the duty of B to treat A\r\nas a rational being. It is not right to let crime alone or to let error\r\nalone, but it is imperative to treat the criminal or the mistaken or the\r\nignorant as beings capable of right and truth, and to lead them on\r\ninstead of merely beating them down. The rule of liberty is just the\r\napplication of rational method. It is the opening of the door to the\r\nappeal of reason, of imagination, of social feeling; and except through\r\nthe response to this appeal there is no assured progress of society.\r\n\r\nNow, I am not contending that these principles are free from difficulty\r\nin application. At many points they suggest difficulties both in theory\r\nand in practice, with some of which I shall try to deal later on. Nor,\r\nagain, am I contending that freedom is the universal solvent, or the\r\nidea of liberty the sole foundation on which a true social philosophy\r\ncan be based. On the contrary, freedom is only one side of social life.\r\nMutual aid is not less important than mutual forbearance, the theory of\r\ncollective action no less fundamental than the theory of personal\r\nfreedom. But, in an inquiry where all the elements are so closely\r\ninterwoven as they are in the field of social life, the point of\r\ndeparture becomes almost indifferent. Wherever we start we shall, if we\r\nare quite frank and consistent, be led on to look at the whole from some\r\ncentral point, and this, I think, has happened to us in working with the\r\nconception of 'liberty.' For, beginning with the right of the\r\nindividual, and the antithesis between personal freedom and social\r\ncontrol, we have been led on to a point at which we regard liberty as\r\nprimarily a matter of social interest, as something flowing from the\r\nnecessities of continuous advance in those regions of truth and of\r\nethics which constitute the matters of highest social concern. At the\r\nsame time, we have come to look for the effect of liberty in the firmer\r\nestablishment of social solidarity, as the only foundation on which such\r\nsolidarity can securely rest. We have, in fact, arrived by a path of our\r\nown at that which is ordinarily described as the organic conception of\r\nthe relation between the individual and society--a conception towards\r\nwhich Mill worked through his career, and which forms the starting-point\r\nof T. H. Green's philosophy alike in ethics and in politics.\r\n\r\nThe term organic is so much used and abused that it is best to state\r\nsimply what it means. A thing is called organic when it is made up of\r\nparts which are quite distinct from one another, but which are destroyed\r\nor vitally altered when they are removed from the whole. Thus, the human\r\nbody is organic because its life depends on the functions performed by\r\nmany organs, while each of these organs depends in turn on the life of\r\nthe body, perishing and decomposing if removed therefrom. Now, the\r\norganic view of society is equally simple. It means that, while the life\r\nof society is nothing but the life of individuals as they act one upon\r\nanother, the life of the individual in turn would be something utterly\r\ndifferent if he could be separated from society. A great deal of him\r\nwould not exist at all. Even if he himself could maintain physical\r\nexistence by the luck and skill of a Robinson Crusoe, his mental and\r\nmoral being would, if it existed at all, be something quite different\r\nfrom anything that we know. By language, by training, by simply living\r\nwith others, each of us absorbs into his system the social atmosphere\r\nthat surrounds us. In particular, in the matter of rights and duties\r\nwhich is cardinal for Liberal theory, the relation of the individual to\r\nthe community is everything. His rights and his duties are alike defined\r\nby the common good. What, for example, is my right? On the face of it,\r\nit is something that I claim. But a mere claim is nothing. I might claim\r\nanything and everything. If my claim is of right it is because it is\r\nsound, well grounded, in the judgment of an impartial observer. But an\r\nimpartial observer will not consider me alone. He will equally weigh the\r\nopposed claims of others. He will take us in relation to one another,\r\nthat is to say, as individuals involved in a social relationship.\r\nFurther, if his decision is in any sense a rational one, it must rest on\r\na principle of some kind; and again, as a rational man, any principle\r\nwhich he asserts he must found on some good result which it serves or\r\nembodies, and as an impartial man he must take the good of every one\r\naffected into account. That is to say, he must found his judgment on the\r\ncommon good. An individual right, then, cannot conflict with the common\r\ngood, nor could any right exist apart from the common good.\r\n\r\nThe argument might seem to make the individual too subservient to\r\nsociety. But this is to forget the other side of the original\r\nsupposition. Society consists wholly of persons. It has no distinct\r\npersonality separate from and superior to those of its members. It has,\r\nindeed, a certain collective life and character. The British nation is a\r\nunity with a life of its own. But the unity is constituted by certain\r\nties that bind together all British subjects, which ties are in the last\r\nresort feelings and ideas, sentiments of patriotism, of kinship, a\r\ncommon pride, and a thousand more subtle sentiments that bind together\r\nmen who speak a common language, have behind them a common history, and\r\nunderstand one another as they can understand no one else. The British\r\nnation is not a mysterious entity over and above the forty odd millions\r\nof living souls who dwell together under a common law. Its life is their\r\nlife, its well-being or ill-fortune their well-being or ill-fortune.\r\nThus, the common good to which each man's rights are subordinate is a\r\ngood in which each man has a share. This share consists in realizing his\r\ncapacities of feeling, of loving, of mental and physical energy, and in\r\nrealizing these he plays his part in the social life, or, in Green's\r\nphrase, he finds his own good in the common good.\r\n\r\nNow, this phrase, it must be admitted, involves a certain assumption,\r\nwhich may be regarded as the fundamental postulate of the organic view\r\nof society. It implies that such a fulfilment or full development of\r\npersonality is practically possible not for one man only but for all\r\nmembers of a community. There must be a line of development open along\r\nwhich each can move in harmony with others. Harmony in the full sense\r\nwould involve not merely absence of conflict but actual support. There\r\nmust be for each, then, possibilities of development such as not merely\r\nto permit but actively to further the development of others. Now, the\r\nolder economists conceived a natural harmony, such that the interests of\r\neach would, if properly understood and unchecked by outside\r\ninterference, inevitably lead him in courses profitable to others and to\r\nsociety at large. We saw that this assumption was too optimistic. The\r\nconception which we have now reached does not assume so much. It\r\npostulates, not that there is an actually existing harmony requiring\r\nnothing but prudence and coolness of judgment for its effective\r\noperation, but only that there is a possible ethical harmony, to which,\r\npartly by discipline, partly by the improvement of the conditions of\r\nlife, men might attain, and that in such attainment lies the social\r\nideal. To attempt the systematic proof of this postulate would take us\r\ninto the field of philosophical first principles. It is the point at\r\nwhich the philosophy of politics comes into contact with that of ethics.\r\nIt must suffice to say here that, just as the endeavour to establish\r\ncoherent system in the world of thought is the characteristic of the\r\nrational impulse which lies at the root of science and philosophy, so\r\nthe impulse to establish harmony in the world of feeling and action--a\r\nharmony which must include all those who think and feel--is of the\r\nessence of the rational impulse in the world of practice. To move\r\ntowards harmony is the persistent impulse of the rational being, even if\r\nthe goal lies always beyond the reach of accomplished effort.\r\n\r\nThese principles may appear very abstract, remote from practical life,\r\nand valueless for concrete teaching. But this remoteness is of the\r\nnature of first principles when taken without the connecting links that\r\nbind them to the details of experience. To find some of these links let\r\nus take up again our old Liberal principles, and see how they look in\r\nthe light of the organic, or, as we may now call it, the harmonic\r\nconception. We shall readily see, to begin with, that the old idea of\r\nequality has its place. For the common good includes every individual.\r\nIt is founded on personality, and postulates free scope for the\r\ndevelopment of personality in each member of the community. This is the\r\nfoundation not only of equal rights before the law, but also of what is\r\ncalled equality of opportunity. It does not necessarily imply actual\r\nequality of treatment for all persons any more than it implies original\r\nequality of powers.[9] It does, I think, imply that whatever inequality\r\nof actual treatment, of income, rank, office, consideration, there be in\r\na good social system, it would rest, not on the interest of the favoured\r\nindividual as such, but on the common good. If the existence of\r\nmillionaires on the one hand and of paupers on the other is just, it\r\nmust be because such contrasts are the result of an economic system\r\nwhich upon the whole works out for the common good, the good of the\r\npauper being included therein as well as the good of the millionaire;\r\nthat is to say, that when we have well weighed the good and the evil of\r\nall parties concerned we can find no alternative open to us which could\r\ndo better for the good of all. I am not for the moment either attacking\r\nor defending any economic system. I point out only that this is the\r\nposition which according to the organic or harmonic view of society must\r\nbe made good by any rational defence of grave inequality in the\r\ndistribution of wealth. In relation to equality, indeed, it appears,\r\noddly enough, that the harmonic principle can adopt wholesale, and even\r\nexpand, one of the \"Rights of Man\" as formulated in 1789--\"Social\r\ndistinctions can only be founded upon common utility.\" If it is really\r\njust that A should be superior to B in wealth or power or position, it\r\nis only because when the good of all concerned is considered, among whom\r\nB is one, it turns out that there is a net gain in the arrangement as\r\ncompared with any alternative that we can devise.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from equality to liberty, the general lines of argument have\r\nalready been indicated, and the discussion of difficulties in detail\r\nmust be left for the next chapter. It need only be repeated here that on\r\nthe harmonic principle the fundamental importance of liberty rests on\r\nthe nature of the \"good\" itself, and that whether we are thinking of the\r\ngood of society or the good of the individual. The good is something\r\nattained by the development of the basal factors of personality; a\r\ndevelopment proceeding by the widening of ideas, the awakening of the\r\nimagination, the play of affection and passion, the strengthening and\r\nextension of rational control. As it is the development of these\r\nfactors in each human being that makes his life worth having, so it is\r\ntheir harmonious interaction, the response of each to each, that makes\r\nof society a living whole. Liberty so interpreted cannot, as we have\r\nseen, dispense with restraint; restraint, however, is not an end but a\r\nmeans to an end, and one of the principal elements in that end is the\r\nenlargement of liberty.\r\n\r\nBut the collective activity of the community does not necessarily\r\nproceed by coercion or restraint. The more securely it is founded on\r\nfreedom and general willing assent, the more it is free to work out all\r\nthe achievements in which the individual is feeble or powerless while\r\ncombined action is strong. Human progress, on whatever side we consider\r\nit, is found to be in the main social progress, the work of conscious or\r\nunconscious co-operation. In this work voluntary association plays a\r\nlarge and increasing part. But the State is one form of association\r\namong others, distinguished by its use of coercive power, by its\r\nsupremacy, and by its claim to control all who dwell within its\r\ngeographical limits. What the functions of such a form of association\r\nare to be we shall have to consider a little further in connection with\r\nthe other questions which we have already raised. But that, in general,\r\nwe are justified in regarding the State as one among many forms of human\r\nassociation for the maintenance and improvement of life is the general\r\nprinciple that we have to point out here, and this is the point at which\r\nwe stand furthest from the older Liberalism. We have, however, already\r\nseen some reason for thinking that the older doctrines led, when\r\ncarefully examined, to a more enlarged conception of State action than\r\nappeared on the surface; and we shall see more fully before we have done\r\nthat the \"positive\" conception of the State which we have now reached\r\nnot only involves no conflict with the true principle of personal\r\nliberty, but is necessary to its effective realization.\r\n\r\nThere is, in addition, one principle of historic Liberalism with which\r\nour present conception of the State is in full sympathy. The conception\r\nof the common good as it has been explained can be realized in its\r\nfullness only through the common will. There are, of course, elements of\r\nvalue in the good government of a benevolent despot or of a fatherly\r\naristocracy. Within any peaceful order there is room for many good\r\nthings to flourish. But the full fruit of social progress is only to be\r\nreaped by a society in which the generality of men and women are not\r\nonly passive recipients but practical contributors. To make the rights\r\nand responsibilities of citizens real and living, and to extend them as\r\nwidely as the conditions of society allow, is thus an integral part of\r\nthe organic conception of society, and the justification of the\r\ndemocratic principle. It is, at the same time, the justification of\r\nnationalism so far as nationalism is founded on a true interpretation of\r\nhistory. For, inasmuch as the true social harmony rests on feeling and\r\nmakes use of all the natural ties of kinship, of neighbourliness, of\r\ncongruity of character and belief, and of language and mode of life, the\r\nbest, healthiest, and most vigorous political unit is that to which men\r\nare by their own feelings strongly drawn. Any breach of such unity,\r\nwhether by forcible disruption or by compulsory inclusion in a larger\r\nsociety of alien sentiments and laws, tends to mutilate--or, at lowest,\r\nto cramp--the spontaneous development of social life. National and\r\npersonal freedom are growths of the same root, and their historic\r\nconnection rests on no accident, but on ultimate identity of idea.\r\n\r\nThus in the organic conception of society each of the leading ideas of\r\nhistoric Liberalism has its part to play. The ideal society is conceived\r\nas a whole which lives and flourishes by the harmonious growth of its\r\nparts, each of which in developing on its own lines and in accordance\r\nwith its own nature tends on the whole to further the development of\r\nothers. There is some elementary trace of such harmony in every form of\r\nsocial life that can maintain itself, for if the conflicting impulses\r\npredominated society would break up, and when they do predominate\r\nsociety does break up. At the other extreme, true harmony is an ideal\r\nwhich it is perhaps beyond the power of man to realize, but which serves\r\nto indicate the line of advance. But to admit this is to admit that the\r\nlines of possible development for each individual or, to use a more\r\ngeneral phrase, for each constituent of the social order are not limited\r\nand fixed. There are many possibilities, and the course that will in the\r\nend make for social harmony is only one among them, while the\r\npossibilities of disharmony and conflict are many. The progress of\r\nsociety like that of the individual depends, then, ultimately on choice.\r\nIt is not \"natural,\" in the sense in which a physical law is natural,\r\nthat is, in the sense of going forward automatically from stage to stage\r\nwithout backward turnings, deflections to the left, or fallings away on\r\nthe right. It is natural only in this sense, that it is the expression\r\nof deep-seated forces of human nature which come to their own only by an\r\ninfinitely slow and cumbersome process of mutual adjustment. Every\r\nconstructive social doctrine rests on the conception of human progress.\r\nThe heart of Liberalism is the understanding that progress is not a\r\nmatter of mechanical contrivance, but of the liberation of living\r\nspiritual energy. Good mechanism is that which provides the channels\r\nwherein such energy can flow unimpeded, unobstructed by its own\r\nexuberance of output, vivifying the social structure, expanding and\r\nennobling the life of mind.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[9] An absurd misconception fostered principally by opponents of\r\nequality for controversial purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AND THE INDIVIDUAL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen something of the principle underlying the Liberal idea and\r\nof its various applications. We have now to put the test question. Are\r\nthese different applications compatible? Will they work together to make\r\nthat harmonious whole of which it is easy enough to talk in abstract\r\nterms? Are they themselves really harmonious in theory and in practice?\r\nDoes scope for individual development, for example, consort with the\r\nidea of equality? Is popular sovereignty a practicable basis of personal\r\nfreedom, or does it open an avenue to the tyranny of the mob? Will the\r\nsentiment of nationality dwell in unison with the ideal of peace? Is the\r\nlove of liberty compatible with the full realization of the common will?\r\nIf reconcilable in theory, may not these ideals collide in practice? Are\r\nthere not clearly occasions demonstrable in history when development in\r\none direction involves retrogression in another? If so, how are we to\r\nstrike the balance of gain and loss? Does political progress offer us\r\nnothing but a choice of evils, or may we have some confidence that, in\r\nsolving the most pressing problem of the moment, we shall in the end be\r\nin a better position for grappling with the obstacles that come next in\r\nturn?\r\n\r\nI shall deal with these questions as far as limits of space allow, and I\r\nwill take first the question of liberty and the common will upon which\r\neverything turns. Enough has already been said on this topic to enable\r\nus to shorten the discussion. We have seen that social liberty rests on\r\nrestraint. A man can be free to direct his own life only in so far as\r\nothers are prevented from molesting and interfering with him. So far\r\nthere is no real departure from the strictest tenets of individualism.\r\nWe have, indeed, had occasion to examine the application of the doctrine\r\nto freedom of contract on the one hand, and to the action of\r\ncombinations on the other, and have seen reason to think that in either\r\ncase nominal freedom, that is to say, the absence of legal restraint,\r\nmight have the effect of impairing real freedom, that is to say, would\r\nallow the stronger party to coerce the weaker. We have also seen that\r\nthe effect of combination may be double edged, that it may restrict\r\nfreedom on one side and enlarge it on the other. In all these cases our\r\ncontention has been simply that we should be guided by real and not by\r\nverbal considerations,--that we should ask in every case what policy\r\nwill yield effective freedom--and we have found a close connection in\r\neach instance between freedom and equality. In these cases, however, we\r\nwere dealing with the relations of one man with another, or of one body\r\nof men with another, and we could regard the community as an arbiter\r\nbetween them whose business it was to see justice done and prevent the\r\nabuse of coercive power. Hence we could treat a very large part of the\r\nmodern development of social control as motived by the desire for a more\r\neffective liberty. The case is not so clear when we find the will of the\r\nindividual in conflict with the will of the community as a whole. When\r\nsuch conflict occurs, it would seem that we must be prepared for one of\r\ntwo things. Either we must admit the legitimacy of coercion, avowedly\r\nnot in the interests of freedom but in furtherance, without regard to\r\nfreedom, of other ends which the community deems good. Or we must admit\r\nlimitations which may cramp the development of the general will, and\r\nperchance prove a serious obstacle to collective progress. Is there any\r\nmeans of avoiding this conflict? Must we leave the question to be fought\r\nout in each case by a balance of advantages and disadvantages, or are\r\nthere any general considerations which help us to determine the true\r\nsphere of collective and of private action?\r\n\r\nLet us first observe that, as Mill pointed out long ago, there are many\r\nforms of collective action which do not involve coercion. The State may\r\nprovide for certain objects which it deems good without compelling any\r\none to make use of them. Thus it may maintain hospitals, though any one\r\nwho can pay for them remains free to employ his own doctors and nurses.\r\nIt may and does maintain a great educational system, while leaving every\r\none free to maintain or to attend a private school. It maintains parks\r\nand picture galleries without driving any one into them. There is a\r\nmunicipal tramway service, which does not prevent private people from\r\nrunning motor 'buses along the same streets, and so on. It is true that\r\nfor the support of these objects rates and taxes are compulsorily\r\nlevied, but this form of compulsion raises a set of questions of which\r\nwe shall have to speak in another connection, and does not concern us\r\nhere. For the moment we have to deal only with those actions of State\r\nwhich compel all citizens, or all whom they concern, to fall in with\r\nthem and allow of no divergence. This kind of coercion tends to\r\nincrease. Is its extension necessarily an encroachment upon liberty, or\r\nare the elements of value secured by collective control distinct from\r\nthe elements of value secured by individual choice, so that within due\r\nlimits each may develop side by side?\r\n\r\nWe have already declined to solve the problem by applying Mill's\r\ndistinction between self-regarding and other-regarding actions, first\r\nbecause there are no actions which may not directly or indirectly affect\r\nothers, secondly because even if there were they would not cease to be\r\nmatter of concern to others. The common good includes the good of every\r\nmember of the community, and the injury which a man inflicts upon\r\nhimself is matter of common concern, even apart from any ulterior\r\neffect upon others. If we refrain from coercing a man for his own good,\r\nit is not because his good is indifferent to us, but because it cannot\r\nbe furthered by coercion. The difficulty is founded on the nature of the\r\ngood itself, which on its personal side depends on the spontaneous flow\r\nof feeling checked and guided not by external restraint but by rational\r\nself-control. To try to form character by coercion is to destroy it in\r\nthe making. Personality is not built up from without but grows from\r\nwithin, and the function of the outer order is not to create it, but to\r\nprovide for it the most suitable conditions of growth. Thus, to the\r\ncommon question whether it is possible to make men good by Act of\r\nParliament, the reply is that it is not possible to compel morality\r\nbecause morality is the act or character of a free agent, but that it is\r\npossible to create the conditions under which morality can develop, and\r\namong these not the least important is freedom from compulsion by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe argument suggests that compulsion is limited not by\r\nindifference--how could the character of its members be matter of\r\nindifference to the community?--but by its own incapacity to achieve\r\nits ends. The spirit cannot be forced. Nor, conversely, can it prevail\r\nby force. It may require social expression. It may build up an\r\nassociation, a church for example, to carry out the common objects and\r\nmaintain the common life of all who are like-minded. But the association\r\nmust be free, because spiritually everything depends not on what is done\r\nbut on the will with which it is done. The limit to the value of\r\ncoercion thus lies not in the restriction of social purpose, but in the\r\nconditions of personal life. No force can compel growth. Whatever\r\nelements of social value depend on the accord of feeling, on\r\ncomprehension of meaning, on the assent of will, must come through\r\nliberty. Here is the sphere and function of liberty in the social\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\nWhere, then, is the sphere of compulsion, and what is its value? The\r\nreply is that compulsion is of value where outward conformity is of\r\nvalue, and this may be in any case where the non-conformity of one\r\nwrecks the purpose of others. We have already remarked that liberty\r\nitself only rests upon restraint. Thus a religious body is not, properly\r\nspeaking, free to march in procession through the streets unless people\r\nof a different religion are restrained from pelting the procession with\r\nstones and pursuing it with insolence. We restrain them from disorder\r\nnot to teach them the genuine spirit of religion, which they will not\r\nlearn in the police court, but to secure to the other party the right of\r\nworship unmolested. The enforced restraint has its value in the action\r\nthat it sets free. But we may not only restrain one man from obstructing\r\nanother--and the extent to which we do this is the measure of the\r\nfreedom that we maintain--but we may also restrain him from obstructing\r\nthe general will; and this we have to do whenever uniformity is\r\nnecessary to the end which the general will has in view. The majority of\r\nemployers in a trade we may suppose would be willing to adopt certain\r\nprecautions for the health or safety of their workers, to lower hours or\r\nto raise the rate of wages. They are unable to do so, however, as long\r\nas a minority, perhaps as long as a single employer, stands out. He\r\nwould beat them in competition if they were voluntarily to undertake\r\nexpenses from which he is free. In this case, the will of a minority,\r\npossibly the will of one man, thwarts that of the remainder. It coerces\r\nthem, indirectly, but quite as effectively as if he were their master.\r\nIf they, by combination, can coerce him no principle of liberty is\r\nviolated. It is coercion against coercion, differing possibly in form\r\nand method, but not in principle or in spirit. Further, if the community\r\nas a whole sympathizes with the one side rather than the other, it can\r\nreasonably bring the law into play. Its object is not the moral\r\neducation of the recusant individuals. Its object is to secure certain\r\nconditions which it believes necessary for the welfare of its members,\r\nand which can only be secured by an enforced uniformity.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the true distinction is not between\r\nself-regarding and other-regarding actions, but between coercive and\r\nnon-coercive actions. The function of State coercion is to override\r\nindividual coercion, and, of course, coercion exercised by any\r\nassociation of individuals within the State. It is by this means that it\r\nmaintains liberty of expression, security of person and property,\r\ngenuine freedom of contract, the rights of public meeting and\r\nassociation, and finally its own power to carry out common objects\r\nundefeated by the recalcitrance of individual members. Undoubtedly it\r\nendows both individuals and associations with powers as well as with\r\nrights. But over these powers it must exercise supervision in the\r\ninterests of equal justice. Just as compulsion failed in the sphere of\r\nliberty, the sphere of spiritual growth, so liberty fails in the\r\nexternal order wherever, by the mere absence of supervisory restriction,\r\nmen are able directly or indirectly to put constraint on one another.\r\nThis is why there is no intrinsic and inevitable conflict between\r\nliberty and compulsion, but at bottom a mutual need. The object of\r\ncompulsion is to secure the most favourable external conditions of\r\ninward growth and happiness so far as these conditions depend on\r\ncombined action and uniform observance. The sphere of liberty is the\r\nsphere of growth itself. There is no true opposition between liberty as\r\nsuch and control as such, for every liberty rests on a corresponding act\r\nof control. The true opposition is between the control that cramps the\r\npersonal life and the spiritual order, and the control that is aimed at\r\nsecuring the external and material conditions of their free and\r\nunimpeded development.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend that this delimitation solves all problems. The\r\n\"inward\" life will seek to express itself in outward acts. A religious\r\nordinance may bid the devout refuse military service, or withhold the\r\npayment of a tax, or decline to submit a building to inspection. Here\r\nare external matters where conscience and the State come into direct\r\nconflict, and where is the court of appeal that is to decide between\r\nthem? In any given case the right, as judged by the ultimate effect on\r\nhuman welfare, may, of course, be on the one side, or on the other, or\r\nbetween the two. But is there anything to guide the two parties as long\r\nas each believes itself to be in the right and sees no ground for\r\nwaiving its opinion? To begin with, clearly the State does well to avoid\r\nsuch conflicts by substituting alternatives. Other duties than that of\r\nmilitary service may be found for a follower of Tolstoy, and as long as\r\nhe is willing to take his full share of burdens the difficulty is fairly\r\nmet. Again, the mere convenience of the majority cannot be fairly\r\nweighed against the religious convictions of the few. It might be\r\nconvenient that certain public work should be done on Saturday, but mere\r\nconvenience would be an insufficient ground for compelling Jews to\r\nparticipate in it. Religious and ethical conviction must be weighed\r\nagainst religious and ethical conviction. It is not number that counts\r\nmorally, but the belief that is reasoned out according to the best of\r\none's lights as to the necessities of the common good. But the\r\nconscience of the community has its rights just as much as the\r\nconscience of the individual. If we are convinced that the inspection of\r\na convent laundry is required in the interest, not of mere official\r\nroutine, but of justice and humanity, we can do nothing but insist upon\r\nit, and when all has been done that can be done to save the individual\r\nconscience the common conviction of the common good must have its way.\r\nIn the end the external order belongs to the community, and the right of\r\nprotest to the individual.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the individual owes more to the community than is\r\nalways recognized. Under modern conditions he is too much inclined to\r\ntake for granted what the State does for him and to use the personal\r\nsecurity and liberty of speech which it affords him as a vantage ground\r\nfrom which he can in safety denounce its works and repudiate its\r\nauthority. He assumes the right to be in or out of the social system as\r\nhe chooses. He relies on the general law which protects him, and\r\nemancipates himself from some particular law which he finds oppressive\r\nto his conscience. He forgets or does not take the trouble to reflect\r\nthat, if every one were to act as he does, the social machine would come\r\nto a stop. He certainly fails to make it clear how a society would\r\nsubsist in which every man should claim the right of unrestricted\r\ndisobedience to a law which he happens to think wrong. In fact, it is\r\npossible for an over-tender conscience to consort with an insufficient\r\nsense of social responsibility. The combination is unfortunate; and we\r\nmay fairly say that, if the State owes the utmost consideration to the\r\nconscience, its owner owes a corresponding debt to the State. With such\r\nmutual consideration, and with the development of the civic sense,\r\nconflicts between law and conscience are capable of being brought within\r\nvery narrow limits, though their complete reconciliation will always\r\nremain a problem until men are generally agreed as to the fundamental\r\nconditions of the social harmony.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, on the other hand, whether in insisting on the free\r\ndevelopment of personality we have not understated the duty of society\r\nto its members. We all admit a collective responsibility for children.\r\nAre there not grown-up people who stand just as much in need of care?\r\nWhat of the idiot, the imbecile, the feeble-minded or the drunkard? What\r\ndoes rational self-determination mean for these classes? They may injure\r\nno one but themselves except by the contagion of bad example. But have\r\nwe no duty towards them, having in view their own good alone and leaving\r\nevery other consideration aside? Have we not the right to take the\r\nfeeble-minded under our care and to keep the drunkard from drink, purely\r\nfor their own good and apart from every ulterior consideration? And, if\r\nso, must we not extend the whole sphere of permissible coercion, and\r\nadmit that a man may for his own sake and with no ulterior object, be\r\ncompelled to do what we think right and avoid what we think wrong?\r\n\r\nThe reply is that the argument is weak just where it seeks to\r\ngeneralize. We are compelled to put the insane under restraint for\r\nsocial reasons apart from their own benefit. But their own benefit\r\nwould be a fully sufficient reason if no other existed. To them, by\r\ntheir misfortune, liberty, as we understand the term, has no\r\napplication, because they are incapable of rational choice and therefore\r\nof the kind of growth for the sake of which freedom is valuable. The\r\nsame thing is true of the feeble-minded, and if they are not yet treated\r\non the same principle it is merely because the recognition of their type\r\nas a type is relatively modern. But the same thing is also in its degree\r\ntrue of the drunkard, so far as he is the victim of an impulse which he\r\nhas allowed to grow beyond his own control; and the question whether he\r\nshould be regarded as a fit object for tutelage or not is to be decided\r\nin each case by asking whether such capacity of self-control as he\r\nretains would be impaired or repaired by a period of tutelar restraint.\r\nThere is nothing in all this to touch the essential of liberty which is\r\nthe value of the power of self-governance where it exists. All that is\r\nproved is that where it does not exist it is right to save men from\r\nsuffering, and if the case admits to put them under conditions in which\r\nthe normal balance of impulse is most likely to be restored. It may be\r\nadded that, in the case of the drunkard--and I think the argument\r\napplies to all cases where overwhelming impulse is apt to master the\r\nwill--it is a still more obvious and elementary duty to remove the\r\nsources of temptation, and to treat as anti-social in the highest degree\r\nevery attempt to make profit out of human weakness, misery, and\r\nwrong-doing. The case is not unlike that of a very unequal contract. The\r\ntempter is coolly seeking his profit, and the sufferer is beset with a\r\nfiend within. There is a form of coercion here which the genuine spirit\r\nof liberty will not fail to recognize as its enemy, and a form of injury\r\nto another which is not the less real because its weapon is an impulse\r\nwhich forces that other to the consent which he yields.\r\n\r\nI conclude that there is nothing in the doctrine of liberty to hinder\r\nthe movement of general will in the sphere in which it is really\r\nefficient, and nothing in a just conception of the objects and methods\r\nof the general will to curtail liberty in the performance of the\r\nfunctions, social and personal, in which its value lies. Liberty and\r\ncompulsion have complementary functions, and the self-governing State\r\nis at once the product and the condition of the self-governing\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThus there is no difficulty in understanding why the extension of State\r\ncontrol on one side goes along with determined resistance to\r\nencroachments on another. It is a question not of increasing or\r\ndiminishing, but of reorganizing, restraints. The period which has\r\nwitnessed a rapid extension of industrial legislation has seen as\r\ndetermined a resistance to anything like the establishment of doctrinal\r\nreligious teaching by a State authority,[10] and the distinction is\r\nperfectly just. At bottom it is the same conception of liberty and the\r\nsame conception of the common will that prompts the regulation of\r\nindustry and the severance of religious worship and doctrinal teaching\r\nfrom the mechanism of State control.\r\n\r\nSo far we have been considering what the State compels the individual to\r\ndo. If we pass to the question what the State is to do for the\r\nindividual, a different but parallel question arises, and we have to\r\nnote a corresponding movement of opinion. If the State does for the\r\nindividual what he ought to do for himself what will be the effect on\r\ncharacter, initiative, enterprise? It is a question now not of freedom,\r\nbut of responsibility, and it is one that has caused many searchings of\r\nheart, and in respect of which opinion has undergone a remarkable\r\nchange. Thus, in relation to poverty the older view was that the first\r\nthing needful was self-help. It was the business of every man to provide\r\nfor himself and his family. If, indeed, he utterly failed, neither he\r\nnor they could be left to starve, and there was the Poor Law machinery\r\nto deal with his case. But the aim of every sincere friend of the poor\r\nmust be to keep them away from the Poor Law machine. Experience of the\r\nforty years before 1834 had taught us what came of free resort to public\r\nfunds by way of subvention to inadequate wages. It meant simply that the\r\nstandard of remuneration was lowered in proportion as men could rely on\r\npublic aid to make good the deficiency, while at the same time the\r\nincentives to independent labour were weakened when the pauper stood on\r\nan equal footing with the hard-working man. In general, if the attempt\r\nwas made to substitute for personal effort the help of others, the\r\nresult would only sap individual initiative and in the end bring down\r\nthe rate of industrial remuneration. It was thought, for example--and\r\nthis very point was urged against proposals for Old Age Pensions--that\r\nif any of the objects for which a man will, if possible, provide were\r\nremoved from the scope of his own activity, he would in consequence be\r\ncontent with proportionally lower wages; if the employer was to\r\ncompensate him for accident, he would fail to make provision for\r\naccidents on his own account; if his children were fed by the\r\nratepayers, he would not earn the money wherewith to feed them. Hence,\r\non the one hand, it was urged that the rate of wages would tend to adapt\r\nitself to the necessities of the wage earner, that in proportion as his\r\nnecessities were met from other sources his wages would fall, that\r\naccordingly the apparent relief would be in large measure illusory,\r\nwhile finally, in view of the diminished stimulus to individual\r\nexertion, the productivity of labour would fall off, the incentives to\r\nindustry would be diminished, and the community as a whole would be\r\npoorer. Upon the other hand, it was conceived that, however deplorable\r\nthe condition of the working classes might be, the right way of raising\r\nthem was to trust to individual enterprise and possibly, according to\r\nsome thinkers, to voluntary combination. By these means the efficiency\r\nof labour might be enhanced and its regular remuneration raised. By\r\nsternly withholding all external supports we should teach the working\r\nclasses to stand alone, and if there were pain in the disciplinary\r\nprocess there was yet hope in the future. They would come by degrees to\r\na position of economic independence in which they would be able to face\r\nthe risks of life, not in reliance upon the State, but by the force of\r\ntheir own brains and the strength of their own right arms.\r\n\r\nThese views no longer command the same measure of assent. On all sides\r\nwe find the State making active provision for the poorer classes and not\r\nby any means for the destitute alone. We find it educating the children,\r\nproviding medical inspection, authorizing the feeding of the necessitous\r\nat the expense of the ratepayers, helping them to obtain employment\r\nthrough free Labour Exchanges, seeking to organize the labour market\r\nwith a view to the mitigation of unemployment, and providing old age\r\npensions for all whose incomes fall below thirteen shillings a week,\r\nwithout exacting any contribution. Now, in all this, we may well ask, is\r\nthe State going forward blindly on the paths of broad and generous but\r\nunconsidered charity? Is it and can it remain indifferent to the effect\r\non individual initiative and personal or parental responsibility? Or may\r\nwe suppose that the wiser heads are well aware of what they are about,\r\nhave looked at the matter on all sides, and are guided by a reasonable\r\nconception of the duty of the State and the responsibilities of the\r\nindividual? Are we, in fact--for this is really the question--seeking\r\ncharity or justice?\r\n\r\nWe said above that it was the function of the State to secure the\r\nconditions upon which mind and character may develop themselves.\r\nSimilarly we may say now that the function of the State is to secure\r\nconditions upon which its citizens are able to win by their own efforts\r\nall that is necessary to a full civic efficiency. It is not for the\r\nState to feed, house, or clothe them. It is for the State to take care\r\nthat the economic conditions are such that the normal man who is not\r\ndefective in mind or body or will can by useful labour feed, house, and\r\nclothe himself and his family. The \"right to work\" and the right to a\r\n\"living wage\" are just as valid as the rights of person or property.\r\nThat is to say, they are integral conditions of a good social order. A\r\nsociety in which a single honest man of normal capacity is definitely\r\nunable to find the means of maintaining himself by useful work is to\r\nthat extent suffering from malorganization. There is somewhere a defect\r\nin the social system, a hitch in the economic machine. Now, the\r\nindividual workman cannot put the machine straight. He is the last\r\nperson to have any say in the control of the market. It is not his fault\r\nif there is over-production in his industry, or if a new and cheaper\r\nprocess has been introduced which makes his particular skill, perhaps\r\nthe product of years of application, a drug in the market. He does not\r\ndirect or regulate industry. He is not responsible for its ups and\r\ndowns, but he has to pay for them. That is why it is not charity but\r\njustice for which he is asking. Now, it may be infinitely difficult to\r\nmeet his demand. To do so may involve a far-reaching economic\r\nreconstruction. The industrial questions involved may be so little\r\nunderstood that we may easily make matters worse in the attempt to make\r\nthem better. All this shows the difficulty in finding means of meeting\r\nthis particular claim of justice, but it does not shake its position as\r\na claim of justice. A right is a right none the less though the means of\r\nsecuring it be imperfectly known; and the workman who is unemployed or\r\nunderpaid through economic malorganization will remain a reproach not to\r\nthe charity but to the justice of society as long as he is to be seen in\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the duty of the State and the right of the workman is\r\ncoming to prevail, it is owing partly to an enhanced sense of common\r\nresponsibility, and partly to the teaching of experience. In the earlier\r\ndays of the Free Trade era, it was permissible to hope that self-help\r\nwould be an adequate solvent, and that with cheap food and expanding\r\ncommerce the average workman would be able by the exercise of prudence\r\nand thrift not only to maintain himself in good times, but to lay by for\r\nsickness, unemployment, and old age. The actual course of events has in\r\nlarge measure disappointed these hopes. It is true that the standard of\r\nliving in England has progressively advanced throughout the nineteenth\r\ncentury. It is true, in particular, that, since the disastrous period\r\nthat preceded the Repeal of the Corn Laws and the passing of the Ten\r\nHours' Act, social improvement has been real and marked. Trade Unionism\r\nand co-operation have grown, wages upon the whole have increased, the\r\ncost of living has diminished, housing and sanitation have improved, the\r\ndeath rate has fallen from about twenty-two to less than fifteen per\r\nthousand. But with all this improvement the prospect of a complete and\r\nlifelong economic independence for the average workman upon the lines of\r\nindividual competition, even when supplemented and guarded by the\r\ncollective bargaining of the Trade Union, appears exceedingly remote.\r\nThe increase of wages does not appear to be by any means proportionate\r\nto the general growth of wealth. The whole standard of living has risen;\r\nthe very provision of education has brought with it new needs and has\r\nalmost compelled a higher standard of life in order to satisfy them. As\r\na whole, the working classes of England, though less thrifty than those\r\nof some Continental countries, cannot be accused of undue negligence\r\nwith regard to the future. The accumulation of savings in Friendly\r\nSocieties, Trade Unions, Co-operative Societies, and Savings Banks shows\r\nan increase which has more than kept pace with the rise in the level of\r\nwages; yet there appears no likelihood that the average manual worker\r\nwill attain the goal of that full independence, covering all the risks\r\nof life for self and family, which can alone render the competitive\r\nsystem really adequate to the demands of a civilized conscience. The\r\ncareful researches of Mr. Booth in London and Mr. Rowntree in York, and\r\nof others in country districts, have revealed that a considerable\r\npercentage of the working classes are actually unable to earn a sum of\r\nmoney representing the full cost of the barest physical necessities for\r\nan average family; and, though the bulk of the working classes are\r\nundoubtedly in a better position than this, these researches go to show\r\nthat even the relatively well-to-do gravitate towards this line of\r\nprimary poverty in seasons of stress, at the time when the children are\r\nstill at school, for example, or from the moment when the principal\r\nwage-earner begins to fail, in the decline of middle life. If only some\r\nten per cent. of the population are actually living upon the poverty\r\nline at any given time,[11] twice or three times that number, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose, must approach the line in one period or other of\r\ntheir lives. But when we ascend from the conception of a bare physical\r\nmaintenance for an average family to such a wage as would provide the\r\nreal minimum requirements of a civilized life and meet all its\r\ncontingencies without having to lean on any external prop, we should\r\nhave to make additions to Mr. Rowntree's figure which have not yet been\r\ncomputed, but as to which it is probably well within the mark to say\r\nthat none but the most highly skilled artisans are able to earn a\r\nremuneration meeting the requirements of the case. But, if that is so,\r\nit is clear that the system of industrial competition fails to meet the\r\nethical demand embodied in the conception of the \"living wage.\" That\r\nsystem holds out no hope of an improvement which shall bring the means\r\nof such a healthy and independent existence as should be the birthright\r\nof every citizen of a free state within the grasp of the mass of the\r\npeople of the United Kingdom. It is this belief slowly penetrating the\r\npublic mind which has turned it to new thoughts of social regeneration.\r\nThe sum and substance of the changes that I have mentioned may be\r\nexpressed in the principle that the individual cannot stand alone, but\r\nthat between him and the State there is a reciprocal obligation. He owes\r\nthe State the duty of industriously working for himself and his family.\r\nHe is not to exploit the labour of his young children, but to submit to\r\nthe public requirements for their education, health, cleanliness and\r\ngeneral well-being. On the other side society owes to him the means of\r\nmaintaining a civilized standard of life, and this debt is not\r\nadequately discharged by leaving him to secure such wages as he can in\r\nthe higgling of the market.\r\n\r\nThis view of social obligation lays increased stress on public but by no\r\nmeans ignores private responsibility. It is a simple principle of\r\napplied ethics that responsibility should be commensurate with power.\r\nNow, given the opportunity of adequately remunerated work, a man has the\r\npower to earn his living. It is his right and his duty to make the best\r\nuse of his opportunity, and if he fails he may fairly suffer the penalty\r\nof being treated as a pauper or even, in an extreme case, as a criminal.\r\nBut the opportunity itself he cannot command with the same freedom. It\r\nis only within narrow limits that it comes within the sphere of his\r\ncontrol. The opportunities of work and the remuneration for work are\r\ndetermined by a complex mass of social forces which no individual,\r\ncertainly no individual workman, can shape. They can be controlled, if\r\nat all, by the organized action of the community, and therefore, by a\r\njust apportionment of responsibility, it is for the community to deal\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nBut this, it will be said, is not Liberalism but Socialism. Pursuing the\r\neconomic rights of the individual we have been led to contemplate a\r\nSocialistic organization of industry. But a word like Socialism has many\r\nmeanings, and it is possible that there should be a Liberal Socialism,\r\nas well as a Socialism that is illiberal. Let us, then, without sticking\r\nat a word, seek to follow out the Liberal view of the State in the\r\nsphere of economics. Let us try to determine in very general terms what\r\nis involved in realizing those primary conditions of industrial\r\nwell-being which have been laid down, and how they consort with the\r\nrights of property and the claims of free industrial enterprise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The objection most often taken to \"undenominationalism\" itself is\r\nthat it is in reality a form of doctrinal teaching seeking State\r\nendowment.\r\n\r\n[11] I do not include those living in \"secondary poverty,\" as defined by\r\nMr. Rowntree, as the responsibility in this case is partly personal. It\r\nmust, however, be remembered that great poverty increases the difficulty\r\nof efficient management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nECONOMIC LIBERALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of Socialism with which Liberalism has nothing to\r\ndo. These I will call the mechanical and the official. Mechanical\r\nSocialism is founded on a false interpretation of history. It attributes\r\nthe phenomena of social life and development to the sole operation of\r\nthe economic factor, whereas the beginning of sound sociology is to\r\nconceive society as a whole in which all the parts interact. The\r\neconomic factor, to take a single point, is at least as much the effect\r\nas it is the cause of scientific invention. There would be no world-wide\r\nsystem of telegraphy if there was no need of world-wide\r\nintercommunication. But there would be no electric telegraph at all but\r\nfor the scientific interest which determined the experiments of Gauss\r\nand Weber. Mechanical Socialism, further, is founded on a false economic\r\nanalysis which attributes all value to labour, denying, confounding or\r\ndistorting the distinct functions of the direction of enterprise, the\r\nunavoidable payment for the use of capital, the productivity of nature,\r\nand the very complex social forces which, by determining the movements\r\nof demand and supply actually fix the rates at which goods exchange with\r\none another. Politically, mechanical Socialism supposes a class war,\r\nresting on a clear-cut distinction of classes which does not exist. Far\r\nfrom tending to clear and simple lines of cleavage, modern society\r\nexhibits a more and more complex interweaving of interests, and it is\r\nimpossible for a modern revolutionist to assail \"property\" in the\r\ninterest of \"labour\" without finding that half the \"labour\" to which he\r\nappeals has a direct or indirect interest in \"property.\" As to the\r\nfuture, mechanical Socialism conceives a logically developed system of\r\nthe control of industry by government. Of this all that need be said is\r\nthat the construction of Utopias is not a sound method of social\r\nscience; that this particular Utopia makes insufficient provision for\r\nliberty, movement, and growth; and that in order to bring his ideals\r\ninto the region of practical discussion, what the Socialist needs is to\r\nformulate not a system to be substituted as a whole for our present\r\narrangements but a principle to guide statesmanship in the practical\r\nwork of reforming what is amiss and developing what is good in the\r\nactual fabric of industry. A principle so applied grows if it has seeds\r\nof good in it, and so in particular the collective control of industry\r\nwill be extended in proportion as it is found in practice to yield good\r\nresults. The fancied clearness of Utopian vision is illusory, because\r\nits objects are artificial ideas and not living facts. The \"system\" of\r\nthe world of books must be reconstructed as a principle that can be\r\napplied to the railway, the mine, the workshop, and the office that we\r\nknow, before it can even be sensibly discussed. The evolution of\r\nSocialism as a practical force in politics has, in point of fact,\r\nproceeded by such a reconstruction, and this change carries with it the\r\nend of the materialistic Utopia.\r\n\r\nOfficial Socialism is a creed of different brand. Beginning with a\r\ncontempt for ideals of liberty based on a confusion between liberty and\r\ncompetition, it proceeds to a measure of contempt for average humanity\r\nin general. It conceives mankind as in the mass a helpless and feeble\r\nrace, which it is its duty to treat kindly. True kindness, of course,\r\nmust be combined with firmness, and the life of the average man must be\r\norganized for his own good. He need not know that he is being organized.\r\nThe socialistic organization will work in the background, and there will\r\nbe wheels within wheels, or rather wires pulling wires. Ostensibly there\r\nwill be a class of the elect, an aristocracy of character and intellect\r\nwhich will fill the civil services and do the practical work of\r\nadministration. Behind these will be committees of union and progress\r\nwho will direct operations, and behind the committees again one or more\r\nmaster minds from whom will emanate the ideas that are to direct the\r\nworld. The play of democratic government will go on for a time, but the\r\nidea of a common will that should actually undertake the organization of\r\nsocial life is held the most childish of illusions. The master minds can\r\nfor the moment work more easily through democratic forms, because they\r\nare here, and to destroy them would cause an upheaval. But the essence\r\nof government lies in the method of capture. The ostensible leaders of\r\ndemocracy are ignorant creatures who can with a little management be set\r\nto walk in the way in which they should go, and whom the crowd will\r\nfollow like sheep. The art of governing consists in making men do what\r\nyou wish without knowing what they are doing, to lead them on without\r\nshowing them whither until it is too late for them to retrace their\r\nsteps. Socialism so conceived has in essentials nothing to do with\r\ndemocracy or with liberty. It is a scheme of the organization of life by\r\nthe superior person, who will decide for each man how he should work,\r\nhow he should live, and indeed, with the aid of the Eugenist, whether he\r\nshould live at all or whether he has any business to be born. At any\r\nrate, if he ought not to have been born--if, that is, he comes of a\r\nstock whose qualities are not approved--the Samurai will take care that\r\nhe does not perpetuate his race.\r\n\r\nNow the average Liberal might have more sympathy with this view of life\r\nif he did not feel that for his part he is just a very ordinary man. He\r\nis quite sure that he cannot manage the lives of other people for them.\r\nHe finds it enough to manage his own. But with the leave of the\r\nSuperior he would rather do this in his own way than in the way of\r\nanother, whose way may be much wiser but is not his. He would rather\r\nmarry the woman of his own choice, than the one who would be sure to\r\nbring forth children of the standard type. He does not want to be\r\nstandardized. He does not conceive himself as essentially an item in a\r\ncensus return. He does not want the standard clothes or the standard\r\nfood, he wants the clothes which he finds comfortable and the food which\r\nhe likes. With this unregenerate Adam in him, I fear that the Liberalism\r\nthat is also within him is quite ready to make terms. Indeed, it incites\r\nhim to go still further. It bids him consider that other men are, on the\r\nwhole, very like himself and look on life in much the same way, and when\r\nit speaks within him of social duty it encourages him to aim not at a\r\nposition of superiority which will enable him to govern his fellow\r\ncreatures for their own good, but at a spirit of comradeship in which he\r\nwill stand shoulder to shoulder with them on behalf of common aims.\r\n\r\nIf, then, there be such a thing as a Liberal Socialism--and whether\r\nthere be is still a subject for inquiry--it must clearly fulfil two\r\nconditions. In the first place, it must be democratic. It must come from\r\nbelow, not from above. Or rather, it must emerge from the efforts of\r\nsociety as a whole to secure a fuller measure of justice, and a better\r\norganization of mutual aid. It must engage the efforts and respond to\r\nthe genuine desires not of a handful of superior beings, but of great\r\nmasses of men. And, secondly, and for that very reason, it must make its\r\naccount with the human individual. It must give the average man free\r\nplay in the personal life for which he really cares. It must be founded\r\non liberty, and must make not for the suppression but for the\r\ndevelopment of personality. How far, it may be asked, are these objects\r\ncompatible? How far is it possible to organize industry in the interest\r\nof the common welfare without either overriding the freedom of\r\nindividual choice or drying up the springs of initiative and energy? How\r\nfar is it possible to abolish poverty, or to institute economic equality\r\nwithout arresting industrial progress? We cannot put the question\r\nwithout raising more fundamental issues. What is the real meaning of\r\n\"equality\" in economics? Would it mean, for example, that all should\r\nenjoy equal rewards, or that equal efforts should enjoy equal rewards,\r\nor that equal attainments should enjoy equal rewards? What is the\r\nprovince of justice in economics? Where does justice end and charity\r\nbegin? And what, behind all this, is the basis of property? What is its\r\nsocial function and value? What is the measure of consideration due to\r\nvested interest and prescriptive right? It is impossible, within the\r\nlimits of a volume, to deal exhaustively with such fundamental\r\nquestions. The best course will be to follow out the lines of\r\ndevelopment which appear to proceed from those principles of Liberalism\r\nwhich have been already indicated and to see how far they lead to a\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nWe saw that it was the duty of the State to secure the conditions of\r\nself-maintenance for the normal healthy citizen. There are two lines\r\nalong which the fulfilment of this duty may be sought. One would consist\r\nin providing access to the means of production, the other in\r\nguaranteeing to the individual a certain share in the common stock. In\r\npoint of fact, both lines have been followed by Liberal legislation. On\r\nthe one side this legislation has set itself, however timidly and\r\nineffectively as yet, to reversing the process which divorced the\r\nEnglish peasantry from the soil. Contemporary research is making it\r\nclear that this divorce was not the inevitable result of slowly\r\noperating economic forces. It was brought about by the deliberate policy\r\nof the enclosure of the common fields begun in the fifteenth century,\r\npartially arrested from the middle of the sixteenth to the eighteenth,\r\nand completed between the reigns of George II and Queen Victoria. As\r\nthis process was furthered by an aristocracy, so there is every reason\r\nto hope that it can be successfully reversed by a democracy, and that it\r\nwill be possible to reconstitute a class of independent peasantry as the\r\nbackbone of the working population. The experiment, however, involves\r\none form or another of communal ownership. The labourer can only obtain\r\nthe land with the financial help of the State, and it is certainly not\r\nthe view of Liberals that the State, having once regained the fee\r\nsimple, should part with it again. On the contrary, in an equitable\r\ndivision of the fruits of agriculture all advantages that are derived\r\nfrom the qualities or position of the soil itself, or from the\r\nenhancement of prices by tariffs would, since they are the product of no\r\nman's labour, fall to no man's share, or, what is the same thing, they\r\nshould fall to every man, that is, to the community. This is why Liberal\r\nlegislation seeks to create a class not of small landlords but of small\r\ntenants. It would give to this class access to the land and would reward\r\nthem with the fruits of their own work--and no more. The surplus it\r\nwould take to itself in the form of rent, and while it is desirable to\r\ngive the State tenant full security against disturbance, rents must at\r\nstated periods be adjustable to prices and to cost. So, while\r\nConservative policy is to establish a peasant proprietary which would\r\nreinforce the voting strength of property, the Liberal policy is to\r\nestablish a State tenantry from whose prosperity the whole community\r\nwould profit. The one solution is individualist. The other, as far as it\r\ngoes, is nearer to the Socialist ideal.\r\n\r\nBut, though British agriculture may have a great future before it, it\r\nwill never regain its dominant position in our economic life, nor are\r\nsmall holdings ever likely to be the prevalent form of agriculture. The\r\nbulk of industry is, and probably will be, more and more in the hands\r\nof large undertakings with which the individual workman could not\r\ncompete whatever instruments of production were placed in his hands. For\r\nthe mass of the people, therefore, to be assured of the means of a\r\ndecent livelihood must mean to be assured of continuous employment at a\r\nliving wage, or, as an alternative, of public assistance. Now, as has\r\nbeen remarked, experience goes to show that the wage of the average\r\nworker, as fixed by competition, is not and is not likely to become\r\nsufficient to cover all the fortunes and misfortunes of life, to provide\r\nfor sickness, accident, unemployment and old age, in addition to the\r\nregular needs of an average family. In the case of accident the State\r\nhas put the burden of making provision on the employer. In the case of\r\nold age it has, acting, as I think, upon a sounder principle, taken the\r\nburden upon itself. It is very important to realize precisely what the\r\nnew departure involved in the Old Age Pensions Act amounted to in point\r\nof principle. The Poor Law already guaranteed the aged person and the\r\npoor in general against actual starvation. But the Poor Law came into\r\noperation only at the point of sheer destitution. It failed to help\r\nthose who had helped themselves. Indeed, to many it held out little\r\ninducement to help themselves if they could not hope to lay by so much\r\nas would enable them to live more comfortably on their means than they\r\nwould live in the workhouse. The pension system throws over the test of\r\ndestitution. It provides a certain minimum, a basis to go upon, a\r\nfoundation upon which independent thrift may hope to build up a\r\nsufficiency. It is not a narcotic but a stimulus to self help and to\r\nfriendly aid or filial support, and it is, up to a limit, available for\r\nall alike. It is precisely one of the conditions of independence of\r\nwhich voluntary effort can make use, but requiring voluntary effort to\r\nmake it fully available.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion underlying the movement for the break up of the Poor Law\r\nis just the general application of this principle. It is that, instead\r\nof redeeming the destitute, we should seek to render generally available\r\nthe means of avoiding destitution, though in doing so we should\r\nuniformly call on the individual for a corresponding effort on his part.\r\nOne method of meeting these conditions is to supply a basis for private\r\neffort to work upon, as is done in the case of the aged. Another method\r\nis that of State-aided insurance, and on these lines Liberal legislators\r\nhave been experimenting in the hope of dealing with sickness,\r\ninvalidity, and one portion of the problem of unemployment. A third may\r\nbe illustrated by the method by which the Minority of the Poor Law\r\nCommissioners would deal with the case, at present so often full of\r\ntragic import, of the widowed or deserted mother of young children.\r\nHitherto she has been regarded as an object of charity. It has been a\r\nmatter for the benevolent to help her to retain her home, while it has\r\nbeen regarded as her duty to keep \"off the rates\" at the cost of no\r\nmatter what expenditure of labour away from home. The newer conception\r\nof rights and duties comes out clearly in the argument of the\r\ncommissioners, that if we take in earnest all that we say of the duties\r\nand responsibilities of motherhood, we shall recognize that the mother\r\nof young children is doing better service to the community and one more\r\nworthy of pecuniary remuneration when she stays at home and minds her\r\nchildren than when she goes out charing and leaves them to the chances\r\nof the street or to the perfunctory care of a neighbour. In proportion\r\nas we realize the force of this argument, we reverse our view as to the\r\nnature of public assistance in such a case. We no longer consider it\r\ndesirable to drive the mother out to her charing work if we possibly\r\ncan, nor do we consider her degraded by receiving public money. We\r\ncease, in fact, to regard the public money as a dole, we treat it as a\r\npayment for a civic service, and the condition that we are inclined to\r\nexact is precisely that she should not endeavour to add to it by earning\r\nwages, but rather that she should keep her home respectable and bring up\r\nher children in health and happiness.\r\n\r\nIn defence of the competitive system two arguments have been familiar\r\nfrom old days. One is based on the habits of the working classes. It is\r\nsaid that they spend their surplus incomes on drink, and that if they\r\nhave no margin for saving, it is because they have sunk it in the\r\npublic-house. That argument is rapidly being met by the actual change of\r\nhabits. The wave of temperance which two generations ago reformed the\r\nhabits of the well-to-do in England is rapidly spreading through all\r\nclasses in our own time. The drink bill is still excessive, the\r\nproportion of his weekly wages spent on drink by the average workman is\r\nstill too great, but it is a diminishing quantity, and the fear which\r\nmight have been legitimately expressed in old days that to add to wages\r\nwas to add to the drink bill could no longer be felt as a valid\r\nobjection to any improvement in the material condition of the working\r\npopulation in our own time. We no longer find the drink bill heavily\r\nincreasing in years of commercial prosperity as of old. The second\r\nargument has experienced an even more decisive fate. Down to my own time\r\nit was forcibly contended that any improvement in the material condition\r\nof the mass of the people would result in an increase of the birth rate\r\nwhich, by extending the supply of labour, would bring down wages by an\r\nautomatic process to the old level. There would be more people and they\r\nwould all be as miserable as before. The actual decline of the birth\r\nrate, whatever its other consequences may be, has driven this argument\r\nfrom the field. The birth rate does not increase with prosperity, but\r\ndiminishes. There is no fear of over-population; if there is any\r\npresent danger, it is upon the other side. The fate of these two\r\narguments must be reckoned as a very important factor in the changes of\r\nopinion which we have noted.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it may be thought that the system that I have outlined is\r\nno better than a vast organization of State charity, and that as such it\r\nmust carry the consequences associated with charity on a large scale. It\r\nmust dry up the sources of energy and undermine the independence of the\r\nindividual. On the first point, I have already referred to certain\r\ncogent arguments for a contrary view. What the State is doing, what it\r\nwould be doing if the whole series of contemplated changes were carried\r\nthrough to the end, would by no means suffice to meet the needs of the\r\nnormal man. He would still have to labour to earn his own living. But he\r\nwould have a basis to go upon, a sub-structure on which it would be\r\npossible for him to rear the fabric of a real sufficiency. He would have\r\ngreater security, a brighter outlook, a more confident hope of being\r\nable to keep his head above water. The experience of life suggests that\r\nhope is a better stimulus than fear, confidence a better mental\r\nenvironment than insecurity. If desperation will sometimes spur men to\r\nexceptional exertion the effect is fleeting, and, for a permanence, a\r\nmore stable condition is better suited to foster that blend of restraint\r\nand energy which makes up the tissue of a life of normal health. There\r\nwould be those who would abuse their advantages as there are those who\r\nabuse every form of social institution. But upon the whole it is thought\r\nthat individual responsibility can be more clearly fixed and more\r\nrigorously insisted on when its legitimate sphere is properly defined,\r\nthat is to say, when the burden on the shoulders of the individual is\r\nnot too great for average human nature to bear.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be urged, any reliance on external assistance is destructive\r\nof independence. It is true that to look for support to private\r\nphilanthropy has this effect, because it makes one man dependent on the\r\ngood graces of another. But it is submitted that a form of support on\r\nwhich a man can count as a matter of legal right has not necessarily the\r\nsame effect. Charity, again, tends to diminish the value of independent\r\neffort because it flows in the direction of the failures. It is a\r\ncompensation for misfortune which easily slides into an encouragement to\r\ncarelessness. What is matter of right, on the other hand, is enjoyed\r\nequally by the successful and the unsuccessful. It is not a handicap in\r\nfavour of the one, but an equal distance deducted from the race to be\r\nrun against fate by both. This brings us to the real question. Are\r\nmeasures of the kind under discussion to be regarded as measures of\r\nphilanthropy or measures of justice, as the expression of collective\r\nbenevolence or as the recognition of a general right? The full\r\ndiscussion of the question involves complex and in some respects novel\r\nconceptions of economics and of social ethics to which I can hardly do\r\njustice within the limits of this chapter. But I will endeavour to\r\nindicate in outline the conception of social and economic justice which\r\nunderlies the movement of modern Liberal opinion.\r\n\r\nWe may approach the subject by observing that, whatever the legal\r\ntheory, in practice the existing English Poor Law recognizes the right\r\nof every person to the bare necessaries of life. The destitute man or\r\nwoman can come to a public authority, and the public authority is bound\r\nto give him food and shelter. He has to that extent a lien on the public\r\nresources in virtue of his needs as a human being and on no other\r\nground. This lien, however, only operates when he is destitute; and he\r\ncan only exercise it by submitting to such conditions as the authorities\r\nimpose, which when the workhouse test is enforced means loss of liberty.\r\nIt was the leading \"principle of 1834\" that the lot of the pauper should\r\nbe made \"less eligible\" than that of the independent labourer. Perhaps\r\nwe may express the change of opinion which has come about in our day by\r\nsaying that according to the newer principle the duty of society is\r\nrather to ensure that the lot of the independent labourer be more\r\neligible than that of the pauper. With this object the lien on the\r\ncommon wealth is enlarged and reconstituted. Its exercise does not\r\nentail the penal consequence of the loss of freedom unless there is\r\nproved misfeasance or neglect on the part of the individual. The\r\nunderlying contention is that, in a State so wealthy as the United\r\nKingdom, every citizen should have full means of earning by socially\r\nuseful labour so much material support as experience proves to be the\r\nnecessary basis of a healthy, civilized existence. And if in the actual\r\nworking of the industrial system the means are not in actual fact\r\nsufficiently available he is held to have a claim not as of charity but\r\nas of right on the national resources to make good the deficiency.\r\n\r\nThat there are rights of property we all admit. Is there not perhaps a\r\ngeneral right _to_ property? Is there not something radically wrong with\r\nan economic system under which through the laws of inheritance and\r\nbequest vast inequalities are perpetuated? Ought we to acquiesce in a\r\ncondition in which the great majority are born to nothing except what\r\nthey can earn, while some are born to more than the social value of any\r\nindividual of whatever merit? May it not be that in a reasoned scheme of\r\neconomic ethics we should have to allow a true right of property in the\r\nmember of the community as such which would take the form of a certain\r\nminimum claim on the public resources? A pretty idea, it may be said,\r\nbut ethics apart, what are the resources on which the less fortunate is\r\nto draw? The British State has little or no collective property\r\navailable for any such purpose. Its revenues are based on taxation, and\r\nin the end what all this means is that the rich are to be taxed for the\r\nbenefit of the poor, which we may be told is neither justice nor charity\r\nbut sheer spoliation. To this I would reply that the depletion of public\r\nresources is a symptom of profound economic disorganization. Wealth, I\r\nwould contend, has a social as well as a personal basis. Some forms of\r\nwealth, such as ground rents in and about cities, are substantially the\r\ncreation of society, and it is only through the misfeasance of\r\ngovernment in times past that such wealth has been allowed to fall into\r\nprivate hands. Other great sources of wealth are found in financial and\r\nspeculative operations, often of distinctly anti-social tendency and\r\npossible only through the defective organization of our economy. Other\r\ncauses rest in the partial monopolies which our liquor laws, on the one\r\nside, and the old practice of allowing the supply of municipal services\r\nto fall into private hands have built up. Through the principle of\r\ninheritance, property so accumulated is handed on; and the result is\r\nthat while there is a small class born to the inheritance of a share in\r\nthe material benefits of civilization, there is a far larger class which\r\ncan say \"naked we enter, naked we leave.\" This system, as a whole, it\r\nis maintained, requires revision. Property in this condition of things\r\nceases, it is urged, to be essentially an institution by which each man\r\ncan secure to himself the fruits of his own labour, and becomes an\r\ninstrument whereby the owner can command the labour of others on terms\r\nwhich he is in general able to dictate. This tendency is held to be\r\nundesirable, and to be capable of a remedy through a concerted series of\r\nfiscal, industrial, and social measures which would have the effect of\r\naugmenting the common stock at the disposal of society, and so applying\r\nit as to secure the economic independence of all who do not forfeit\r\ntheir advantages by idleness, incapacity, or crime. There are early\r\nforms of communal society in which each person is born to his\r\nappropriate status, carrying its appropriate share of the common land.\r\nIn destroying the last relics of this system economic individualism has\r\nlaid the basis of great material advances, but at great cost to the\r\nhappiness of the masses. The ground problem in economics is not to\r\ndestroy property, but to restore the social conception of property to\r\nits right place under conditions suitable to modern needs. This is not\r\nto be done by crude measures of redistribution, such as those of which\r\nwe hear in ancient history. It is to be done by distinguishing the\r\nsocial from the individual factors in wealth, by bringing the elements\r\nof social wealth into the public coffers, and by holding it at the\r\ndisposal of society to administer to the prime needs of its members.\r\n\r\nThe basis of property is social, and that in two senses. On the one\r\nhand, it is the organized force of society that maintains the rights of\r\nowners by protecting them against thieves and depredators. In spite of\r\nall criticism many people still seem to speak of the rights of property\r\nas though they were conferred by Nature or by Providence upon certain\r\nfortunate individuals, and as though these individuals had an unlimited\r\nright to command the State, as their servant, to secure them by the free\r\nuse of the machinery of law in the undisturbed enjoyment of their\r\npossessions. They forget that without the organized force of society\r\ntheir rights are not worth a week's purchase. They do not ask themselves\r\nwhere they would be without the judge and the policeman and the settled\r\norder which society maintains. The prosperous business man who thinks\r\nthat he has made his fortune entirely by self help does not pause to\r\nconsider what single step he could have taken on the road to his success\r\nbut for the ordered tranquillity which has made commercial development\r\npossible, the security by road, and rail, and sea, the masses of skilled\r\nlabour, and the sum of intelligence which civilization has placed at his\r\ndisposal, the very demand for the goods which he produces which the\r\ngeneral progress of the world has created, the inventions which he uses\r\nas a matter of course and which have been built up by the collective\r\neffort of generations of men of science and organizers of industry. If\r\nhe dug to the foundations of his fortune he would recognize that, as it\r\nis society that maintains and guarantees his possessions, so also it is\r\nsociety which is an indispensable partner in its original creation.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the second sense in which property is social. There is\r\na social element in value and a social element in production. In modern\r\nindustry there is very little that the individual can do by his unaided\r\nefforts. Labour is minutely divided; and in proportion as it is divided\r\nit is forced to be co-operative. Men produce goods to sell, and the\r\nrate of exchange, that is, price, is fixed by relations of demand and\r\nsupply the rates of which are determined by complex social forces. In\r\nthe methods of production every man makes use, to the best of his\r\nability, of the whole available means of civilization, of the machinery\r\nwhich the brains of other men have devised, of the human apparatus which\r\nis the gift of acquired civilization. Society thus provides conditions\r\nor opportunities of which one man will make much better use than\r\nanother, and the use to which they are put is the individual or personal\r\nelement in production which is the basis of the personal claim to\r\nreward. To maintain and stimulate this personal effort is a necessity of\r\ngood economic organization, and without asking here whether any\r\nparticular conception of Socialism would or would not meet this need we\r\nmay lay down with confidence that no form of Socialism which should\r\nignore it could possibly enjoy enduring success. On the other hand, an\r\nindividualism which ignores the social factor in wealth will deplete the\r\nnational resources, deprive the community of its just share in the\r\nfruits of industry and so result in a one-sided and inequitable\r\ndistribution of wealth. Economic justice is to render what is due not\r\nonly to each individual but to each function, social or personal, that\r\nis engaged in the performance of useful service, and this due is\r\nmeasured by the amount necessary to stimulate and maintain the efficient\r\nexercise of that useful function. This equation between function and\r\nsustenance is the true meaning of economic equality.\r\n\r\nNow to apply this principle to the adjustment of the claims of the\r\ncommunity on the one hand and the producers or inheritors of wealth on\r\nthe other would involve a discrimination of the factors of production\r\nwhich is not easy to make in all instances. If we take the case of urban\r\nland, referred to above, the distinction is tolerably clear. The value\r\nof a site in London is something due essentially to London, not to the\r\nlandlord. More accurately a part of it is due to London, a part to the\r\nBritish empire, a part, perhaps we should say, to Western civilization.\r\nBut while it would be impossible to disentangle these subsidiary\r\nfactors, the main point that the entire increment of value is due to one\r\nsocial factor or another is sufficiently clear, and this explains why\r\nLiberal opinion has fastened on the conception of site value as being\r\nby right communal and not personal property. The monopoly value of\r\nlicensed premises, which is the direct creation of laws passed for the\r\ncontrol of the liquor traffic, is another case in point. The difficulty\r\nwhich society finds in dealing with these cases is that it has allowed\r\nthese sources of wealth to pass out of its hands, and that property of\r\nthese kinds has freely passed from one man to another in the market, in\r\nthe belief that it stood and would stand on the same basis in law as any\r\nother. Hence, it is not possible for society to insist on the whole of\r\nits claim. It could only resume its full rights at the cost of great\r\nhardship to individuals and a shock to the industrial system. What it\r\ncan do is to shift taxation step by step from the wealth due to\r\nindividual enterprise to the wealth that depends on its own collective\r\nprogress, thus by degrees regaining the ownership of the fruits of its\r\nown collective work.\r\n\r\nMuch more difficult in principle is the question of the more general\r\nelements of social value which run through production as a whole. We are\r\ndealing here with factors so intricately interwoven in their operation\r\nthat they can only be separated by an indirect process. What this\r\nprocess would be we may best understand by imagining for a moment a\r\nthoroughgoing centralized organization of the industrial system\r\nendeavouring to carry out the principles of remuneration outlined above.\r\nThe central authority which we imagine as endowed with such wisdom and\r\njustice as to find for every man his right place and to assign to every\r\nman his due reward would, if our argument is sound, find it necessary to\r\nassign to each producer, whether working with hand or brain, whether\r\ndirecting a department of industry or serving under direction, such\r\nremuneration as would stimulate him to put forth his best efforts and\r\nwould maintain him in the condition necessary for the life-long exercise\r\nof his function. If we are right in considering that a great part of the\r\nwealth produced from year to year is of social origin, it would follow\r\nthat, after the assignment of this remuneration, there would remain a\r\nsurplus, and this would fall to the coffers of the community and be\r\navailable for public purposes, for national defence, public works,\r\neducation, charity, and the furtherance of civilized life.\r\n\r\nNow, this is merely an imaginary picture, and I need not ask whether\r\nsuch a measure of wisdom on the part of a Government is practically\r\nattainable, or whether such a measure of centralization might not carry\r\nconsequences which would hamper progress in other directions. The\r\npicture serves merely to illustrate the principles of equitable\r\ndistribution by which the State should be guided in dealing with\r\nproperty. It serves to define our conception of economic justice, and\r\ntherewith the lines on which we should be guided in the adjustment of\r\ntaxation and the reorganization of industry. I may illustrate its\r\nbearing by taking a couple of cases.\r\n\r\nOne important source of private wealth under modern conditions is\r\nspeculation. Is this also a source of social wealth? Does it produce\r\nanything for society? Does it perform a function for which our ideal\r\nadministration would think it necessary to pay? I buy some railway stock\r\nat 110. A year or two later I seize a favourable opportunity and sell it\r\nat 125. Is the increment earned or unearned? The answer in the single\r\ncase is clear, but it may be said that my good fortune in this case may\r\nbe balanced by ill luck in another. No doubt. But, to go no further, if\r\non balance I make a fortune or an income by this method it would seem to\r\nbe a fortune or an income not earned by productive service. To this it\r\nmay be replied that the buyers and sellers of stocks are indirectly\r\nperforming the function of adjusting demand and supply, and so\r\nregulating industry. So far as they are expert business men trained in\r\nthe knowledge of a particular market this may be so. So far as they\r\ndabble in the market in the hope of profiting from a favourable turn,\r\nthey appear rather as gamblers. I will not pretend to determine which of\r\nthe two is the larger class. I would point out only that, on the face of\r\nthe facts, the profits derived from this particular source appear to be\r\nrather of the nature of a tax which astute or fortunate individuals are\r\nable to levy on the producer than as the reward which they obtain for a\r\ndefinite contribution on their own part to production. There are two\r\npossible empirical tests of this view. One is that a form of collective\r\norganization should be devised which should diminish the importance of\r\nthe speculative market. Our principle would suggest the propriety of an\r\nattempt in that direction whenever opportunity offers. Another would be\r\nthe imposition of a special tax on incomes derived from this source, and\r\nexperience would rapidly show whether any such tax would actually hamper\r\nthe process of production and distribution at any stage. If not, it\r\nwould justify itself. It would prove that the total profit now absorbed\r\nby individuals exceeds, at least by the amount of the tax, the\r\nremuneration necessary to maintain that particular economic function.\r\n\r\nThe other case I will take is that of inherited wealth. This is the main\r\ndetermining factor in the social and economic structure of our time. It\r\nis clear on our principle that it stands in quite a different position\r\nfrom that of wealth which is being created from day to day. It can be\r\ndefended only on two grounds. One is prescriptive right, and the\r\ndifficulty of disturbing the basis of the economic order. This provides\r\nan unanswerable argument against violent and hasty methods, but no\r\nargument at all against a gentle and slow-moving policy of economic\r\nreorganization. The other argument is that inherited wealth serves\r\nseveral indirect functions. The desire to provide for children and to\r\nfound a family is a stimulus to effort. The existence of a leisured\r\nclass affords possibilities for the free development of originality, and\r\na supply of disinterested men and women for the service of the State. I\r\nwould suggest once again that the only real test to which the value of\r\nthese arguments can be submitted is the empirical test. On the face of\r\nthe facts inherited wealth stands on a different footing from acquired\r\nwealth, and Liberal policy is on the right lines in beginning the\r\ndiscrimination of earned from unearned income. The distinction is\r\nmisconceived only so far as income derived from capital or land may\r\nrepresent the savings of the individual and not his inheritance. The\r\ntrue distinction is between the inherited and the acquired, and while\r\nthe taxation of acquired wealth may operate, so far as it goes, to\r\ndiminish the profits, and so far to weaken the motive springs, of\r\nindustry, it is by no means self-evident that any increase of taxation\r\non inherited wealth would necessarily have that effect, or that it would\r\nvitally derange any other social function. It is, again, a matter on\r\nwhich only experience can decide, but if experience goes to show that\r\nwe can impose a given tax on inherited wealth without diminishing the\r\navailable supply of capital and without losing any service of value, the\r\nresult would be net gain. The State could never be the sole producer,\r\nfor in production the personal factor is vital, but there is no limit\r\nset by the necessities of things to the extension of its control of\r\nnatural resources, on the one hand, and the accumulated heritage of the\r\npast, on the other.\r\n\r\nIf Liberal policy has committed itself not only to the discrimination of\r\nearned and unearned incomes but also to a super-tax on large incomes\r\nfrom whatever source, the ground principle, again, I take to be a\r\nrespectful doubt whether any single individual is worth to society by\r\nany means as much as some individuals obtain. We might, indeed, have to\r\nqualify this doubt if the great fortunes of the world fell to the great\r\ngeniuses. It would be impossible to determine what we ought to pay for a\r\nShakespere, a Browning, a Newton, or a Cobden. Impossible, but\r\nfortunately unnecessary. For the man of genius is forced by his own\r\ncravings to give, and the only reward that he asks from society is to\r\nbe let alone and have some quiet and fresh air. Nor is he in reality\r\nentitled, notwithstanding his services, to ask more than the modest\r\nsufficiency which enables him to obtain those primary needs of the life\r\nof thought and creation, since his creative energy is the response to an\r\ninward stimulus which goads him on without regard to the wishes of any\r\none else. The case of the great organizers of industry is rather\r\ndifferent, but they, again, so far as their work is socially sound, are\r\ndriven on more by internal necessity than by the genuine love of gain.\r\nThey make great profits because their works reach a scale at which, if\r\nthe balance is on the right side at all, it is certain to be a big\r\nbalance, and they no doubt tend to be interested in money as the sign of\r\ntheir success, and also as the basis of increased social power. But I\r\nbelieve the direct influence of the lust of gain on this type of mind to\r\nhave been immensely exaggerated; and as proof I would refer, first, to\r\nthe readiness of many men of this class to accept and in individual\r\ncases actively to promote measures tending to diminish their material\r\ngain, and, secondly, to the mass of high business capacity which is at\r\nthe command of the public administration for salaries which, as their\r\nrecipient must be perfectly conscious, bear no relation to the income\r\nwhich it would be open to him to earn in commercial competition.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we may take it that the principle of the super-tax\r\nis based on the conception that when we come to an income of some £5,000\r\na year we approach the limit of the industrial value of the\r\nindividual.[12] We are not likely to discourage any service of genuine\r\nsocial value by a rapidly increasing surtax on incomes above that\r\namount. It is more likely that we shall quench the anti-social ardour\r\nfor unmeasured wealth, for social power, and the vanity of display.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations may suffice to give some concreteness to the\r\nconception of economic justice as the maintenance of social function.\r\nThey serve also to show that the true resources of the State are larger\r\nand more varied than is generally supposed. The true function of\r\ntaxation is to secure to society the element in wealth that is of social\r\norigin, or, more broadly, all that does not owe its origin to the\r\nefforts of living individuals. When taxation, based on these principles,\r\nis utilized to secure healthy conditions of existence to the mass of the\r\npeople it is clear that this is no case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.\r\nPeter is not robbed. Apart from the tax it is he who would be robbing\r\nthe State. A tax which enables the State to secure a certain share of\r\nsocial value is not something deducted from that which the taxpayer has\r\nan unlimited right to call his own, but rather a repayment of something\r\nwhich was all along due to society.\r\n\r\nBut why should the proceeds of the tax go to the poor in particular?\r\nGranting that Peter is not robbed, why should Paul be paid? Why should\r\nnot the proceeds be expended on something of common concern to Peter and\r\nPaul alike, for Peter is equally a member of the community? Undoubtedly\r\nthe only just method of dealing with the common funds is to expend them\r\nin objects which subserve the common good, and there are many directions\r\nin which public expenditure does in fact benefit all classes alike.\r\nThis, it is worth noting, is true even of some important branches of\r\nexpenditure which in their direct aim concern the poorer classes.\r\nConsider, for example, the value of public sanitation, not merely to the\r\npoorer regions which would suffer first if it were withheld, but to the\r\nricher as well who, seclude themselves as they may, cannot escape\r\ninfection. In the old days judge and jury, as well as prisoners, would\r\ndie of gaol fever. Consider, again, the economic value of education, not\r\nonly to the worker, but to the employer whom he will serve. But when all\r\nthis is allowed for it must be admitted that we have throughout\r\ncontemplated a considerable measure of public expenditure in the\r\nelimination of poverty. The prime justification of this expenditure is\r\nthat the prevention of suffering from the actual lack of adequate\r\nphysical comforts is an essential element in the common good, an object\r\nin which all are bound to concern themselves, which all have the right\r\nto demand and the duty to fulfil. Any common life based on the\r\navoidable suffering even of one of those who partake in it is a life not\r\nof harmony, but of discord.\r\n\r\nBut we can go further. We said at the outset that the function of\r\nsociety was to secure to all normal adult members the means of earning\r\nby useful work the material necessaries of a healthy and efficient life.\r\nWe can see now that this is one case and, properly understood, the\r\nlargest and most far reaching case falling under the general principle\r\nof economic justice. This principle lays down that every social function\r\nmust receive the reward that is sufficient to stimulate and maintain it\r\nthrough the life of the individual. Now, how much this reward may be in\r\nany case it is probably impossible to determine otherwise than by\r\nspecific experiment. But if we grant, in accordance with the idea with\r\nwhich we have been working all along, that it is demanded of all sane\r\nadult men and women that they should live as civilized beings, as\r\nindustrious workers, as good parents, as orderly and efficient citizens,\r\nit is, on the other side, the function of the economic organization of\r\nsociety to secure them the material means of living such a life, and\r\nthe immediate duty of society is to mark the points at which such means\r\nfail and to make good the deficiency. Thus the conditions of social\r\nefficiency mark the minimum of industrial remuneration, and if they are\r\nnot secured without the deliberate action of the State they must be\r\nsecured by means of the deliberate action of the State. If it is the\r\nbusiness of good economic organization to secure the equation between\r\nfunction and maintenance, the first and greatest application of this\r\nprinciple is to the primary needs. These fix the minimum standard of\r\nremuneration beyond which we require detailed experiment to tell us at\r\nwhat rate increased value of service rendered necessitates corresponding\r\nincrease of reward.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that such a standard is unattainable. There are\r\nthose, it may be contended, who are not, and never will be, worth a full\r\nefficiency wage. Whatever is done to secure them such a remuneration\r\nwill only involve net loss. Hence it violates our standard of economic\r\njustice. It involves payment for a function of more than it is actually\r\nworth, and the discrepancy might be so great as to cripple society. It\r\nmust, of course, be admitted that the population contains a certain\r\npercentage of the physically incapable, the mentally defective, and the\r\nmorally uncontrolled. The treatment of these classes, all must agree, is\r\nand must be based on other principles than those of economics. One class\r\nrequires punitive discipline, another needs life-long care, a third--the\r\nmentally and morally sound but physically defective--must depend, to its\r\nmisfortune, on private and public charity. There is no question here of\r\npayment for a function, but of ministering to human suffering. It is, of\r\ncourse, desirable on economic as well as on broader grounds that the\r\nministration should be so conceived as to render its object as nearly as\r\npossible independent and self-supporting. But in the main all that is\r\ndone for these classes of the population is, and must be, a charge on\r\nthe surplus. The real question that may be raised by a critic is whether\r\nthe considerable proportion of the working class whose earnings actually\r\nfall short, as we should contend, of the minimum, could in point of fact\r\nearn that minimum. Their actual value, he may urge, is measured by the\r\nwage which they do in fact command in the competitive market, and if\r\ntheir wage falls short of the standard society may make good the\r\ndeficiency if it will and can, but must not shut its eyes to the fact\r\nthat in doing so it is performing, not an act of economic justice, but\r\nof charity. To this the reply is that the price which naked labour\r\nwithout property can command in bargaining with employers who possess\r\nproperty is no measure at all of the addition which such labour can\r\nactually make to wealth. The bargain is unequal, and low remuneration is\r\nitself a cause of low efficiency which in turn tends to react\r\nunfavourably on remuneration. Conversely, a general improvement in the\r\nconditions of life reacts favourably on the productivity of labour. Real\r\nwages have risen considerably in the last half century, but the\r\nincome-tax returns indicate that the wealth of the business and\r\nprofessional man has increased even more rapidly. Up to the efficiency\r\nminimum there is, then, every reason to think that a general increase of\r\nwages would positively increase the available surplus whether that\r\nsurplus goes to individuals as profits or to the State as national\r\nrevenue. The material improvement of working-class conditions will more\r\nthan pay its way regarded purely as an economic investment on behalf of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is strengthened if we consider narrowly what elements of\r\ncost the \"living wage\" ought in principle to cover. We are apt to assume\r\nuncritically that the wages earned by the labour of an adult man ought\r\nto suffice for the maintenance of an average family, providing for all\r\nrisks. It ought, we think, to cover not only the food and clothing of\r\nwife and children, but the risks of sickness, accident, and\r\nunemployment. It ought to provide for education and lay by for old age.\r\nIf it fails we are apt to think that the wage earner is not self\r\nsupporting. Now, it is certainly open to doubt whether the actual\r\naddition to wealth made by an unskilled labourer denuded of all\r\ninherited property would equal the cost represented by the sum of these\r\nitems. But here our further principle comes into play. He ought not to\r\nbe denuded of all inherited property. As a citizen he should have a\r\ncertain share in the social inheritance. This share should be his\r\nsupport in the times of misfortune, of sickness, and of worklessness,\r\nwhether due to economic disorganization or to invalidity and old age.\r\nHis children's share, again, is the State-provided education. These\r\nshares are charges on the social surplus. It does not, if fiscal\r\narrangements are what they should be, infringe upon the income of other\r\nindividuals, and the man who without further aid than the universally\r\navailable share in the social inheritance which is to fall to him as a\r\ncitizen pays his way through life is to be justly regarded as\r\nself-supporting.\r\n\r\nThe central point of Liberal economics, then, is the equation of social\r\nservice and reward. This is the principle that every function of social\r\nvalue requires such remuneration as serves to stimulate and maintain its\r\neffective performance; that every one who performs such a function has\r\nthe right, in the strict ethical sense of that term, to such\r\nremuneration and to no more; that the residue of existing wealth should\r\nbe at the disposal of the community for social purposes. Further, it is\r\nthe right, in the same sense, of every person capable of performing some\r\nuseful social function that he should have the opportunity of so doing,\r\nand it is his right that the remuneration that he receives for it should\r\nbe his property, _i. e._ that it should stand at his free disposal\r\nenabling him to direct his personal concerns according to his own\r\npreferences. These are rights in the sense that they are conditions of\r\nthe welfare of its members which a well-ordered State will seek by every\r\nmeans to fulfil. But it is not suggested that the way of such fulfilment\r\nis plain, or that it could be achieved at a stroke by a revolutionary\r\nchange in the tenure of property or the system of industry. It is,\r\nindeed, implied that the State is vested with a certain overlordship\r\nover property in general and a supervisory power over industry in\r\ngeneral, and this principle of economic sovereignty may be set side by\r\nside with that of economic justice as a no less fundamental conception\r\nof economic Liberalism. For here, as elsewhere, liberty implies control.\r\nBut the manner in which the State is to exercise its controlling power\r\nis to be learnt by experience and even in large measure by cautious\r\nexperiment. We have sought to determine the principle which should\r\nguide its action, the ends at which it is to aim. The systematic study\r\nof the means lies rather within the province of economics; and the\r\nteaching of history seems to be that progress is more continuous and\r\nsecure when men are content to deal with problems piecemeal than when\r\nthey seek to destroy root and branch in order to erect a complete system\r\nwhich has captured the imagination.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that these conceptions embody many of the ideas that go to\r\nmake up the framework of Socialist teaching, though they also emphasize\r\nelements of individual right and personal independence, of which\r\nSocialism at times appears oblivious. The distinction that I would claim\r\nfor economic Liberalism is that it seeks to do justice to the social and\r\nindividual factors in industry alike, as opposed to an abstract\r\nSocialism which emphasizes the one side and an abstract Individualism\r\nwhich leans its whole weight on the other. By keeping to the conception\r\nof harmony as our clue we constantly define the rights of the individual\r\nin terms of the common good, and think of the common good in terms of\r\nthe welfare of all the individuals who constitute a society. Thus in\r\neconomics we avoid the confusion of liberty with competition, and see no\r\nvirtue in the right of a man to get the better of others. At the same\r\ntime we are not led to minimize the share of personal initiative,\r\ntalent, or energy in production, but are free to contend for their claim\r\nto adequate recognition. A Socialist who is convinced of the logical\r\ncoherence and practical applicability of his system may dismiss such\r\nendeavours to harmonize divergent claims as a half-hearted and illogical\r\nseries of compromises. It is equally possible that a Socialist who\r\nconceives Socialism as consisting in essence in the co-operative\r\norganization of industry by consumers, and is convinced that the full\r\nsolution of industrial problems lies in that direction, should in\r\nproportion as he considers the psychological factors in production and\r\ninvestigates the means of realizing his ideal, find himself working back\r\nalong the path to a point where he will meet the men who are grappling\r\nwith the problems of the day on the principles here suggested, and will\r\nfind himself able to move forward in practice in the front ranks of\r\neconomic Liberalism. If this is so, the growing co-operation of\r\npolitical Liberalism and Labour, which in the last few years has\r\nreplaced the antagonism of the 'nineties, is no mere accident of\r\ntemporary political convenience, but has its roots deep in the\r\nnecessities of Democracy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[12] It is true that so long as it remains possible for a certain order\r\nof ability to earn £50,000 a year, the community will not obtain its\r\nservices for £5,000. But if things should be so altered by taxation and\r\neconomic reorganization that £5,000 became in practice the highest limit\r\nattainable, and remained attainable even for the ablest only by effort,\r\nthere is no reason to doubt that that effort would be forthcoming. It is\r\nnot the absolute amount of remuneration, but the increment of\r\nremuneration in proportion to the output of industrial or commercial\r\ncapacity, which serves as the needed stimulus to energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF LIBERALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century might be called the age of Liberalism, yet its\r\nclose saw the fortunes of that great movement brought to their lowest\r\nebb. Whether at home or abroad those who represented Liberal ideas had\r\nsuffered crushing defeats. But this was the least considerable of the\r\ncauses for anxiety. If Liberals had been defeated, something much worse\r\nseemed about to befall Liberalism. Its faith in itself was waxing cold.\r\nIt seemed to have done its work. It had the air of a creed that is\r\nbecoming fossilized as an extinct form, a fossil that occupied,\r\nmoreover, an awkward position between two very active and energetically\r\nmoving grindstones--the upper grindstone of plutocratic imperialism, and\r\nthe nether grindstone of social democracy. \"We know all about you,\"\r\nthese parties seemed to say to Liberalism; \"we have been right through\r\nyou and come out on the other side. Respectable platitudes, you go\r\nmaundering on about Cobden and Gladstone, and the liberty of the\r\nindividual, and the rights of nationality, and government by the people.\r\nWhat you say is not precisely untrue, but it is unreal and\r\nuninteresting.\" So far in chorus. \"It is not up to date,\" finished the\r\nImperialist, and the Socialist bureaucrat. \"It is not bread and butter,\"\r\nfinished the Social democrat. Opposed in everything else, these two\r\nparties agreed in one thing. They were to divide the future between\r\nthem. Unfortunately, however, for their agreement, the division was soon\r\nseen to be no equal one. Whatever might be the ultimate recuperative\r\npower of Social Democracy, for the time being, in the paralysis of\r\nLiberalism, the Imperial reaction had things all to itself. The\r\ngoverning classes of England were to assert themselves. They were to\r\nconsolidate the Empire, incidentally passing the steam roller over two\r\nobstructive republics. They were to \"teach the law\" to the \"sullen\r\nnew-caught peoples\" abroad. They were to re-establish the Church at home\r\nby the endowment of doctrinal education. At the same time they were to\r\nestablish the liquor interest--which is, after all, the really potent\r\ninstrument of government from above. They were to bind the colonies to\r\nus by ties of fiscal preference, and to establish the great commercial\r\ninterests on the basis of protection. Their government, as conceived by\r\nthe best exponents of the new doctrine, was by no means to be\r\nindifferent to the humanitarian claims of the social conscience. They\r\nwere to deal out factory acts, and establish wages boards. They were to\r\nmake an efficient and a disciplined people. In the idea of discipline\r\nthe military element rapidly assumed a greater prominence. But on this\r\nside the evolution of opinion passed through two well-marked phases. The\r\nfirst was the period of optimism and expansion. The Englishman was the\r\nborn ruler of the world. He might hold out a hand of friendship to the\r\nGerman and the American, whom he recognized as his kindred and who lived\r\nwithin the law. The rest of the world was peopled by dying nations whose\r\nmanifest destiny was to be \"administered\" by the coming races, and\r\nexploited by their commercial syndicates. This mood of optimism did not\r\nsurvive the South African War. It received its death-blow at Colenso\r\nand Magersfontein, and within a few years fear had definitely taken the\r\nplace of ambition as the mainspring of the movement to national and\r\nimperial consolidation. The Tariff Reform movement was largely inspired\r\nby a sense of insecurity in our commercial position. The\r\nhalf-patronizing friendship for Germany rapidly gave way, first to\r\ncommercial jealousy, and then to unconcealed alarm for our national\r\nsafety. All the powers of society were bent on lavish naval expenditure,\r\nand of imposing the idea of compulsory service on a reluctant people.\r\nThe disciplined nation was needed no longer to dominate the world, but\r\nto maintain its own territory.\r\n\r\nNow, we are not concerned here to follow up the devious windings of\r\nmodern Conservatism. We have to note only that what modern democracy has\r\nto face is no mere inertia of tradition. It is a distinct reactionary\r\npolicy with a definite and not incoherent creed of its own, an ideal\r\nwhich in its best expression--for example, in the daily comments of the\r\n_Morning Post_--is certain to exercise a powerful attraction on many\r\ngenerous minds--the ideal of the efficient, disciplined nation, centre\r\nand dominating force of a powerful, self-contained, militant empire.\r\nWhat concerns us more particularly is the reaction of Conservative\r\ndevelopment upon the fortunes of democracy. But to understand this\r\nreaction, and, indeed, to make any sound estimate of the present\r\nposition and prospects of Liberalism, we must cast a rapid glance over\r\nthe movement of progressive thought during the last generation. When\r\nGladstone formed his second Government in 1880 the old party system\r\nstood secure in Great Britain. It was only a band of politicians from\r\nthe other side of St. George's Channel who disowned both the great\r\nallegiances. For the British political mind the plain distinction of\r\nLiberal and Conservative held the field, and the division was not yet a\r\nclass distinction. The great Whig families held their place, and they of\r\nthe aristocratic houses divided the spoil. But a new leaven was at work.\r\nThe prosperity which had culminated in 1872 was passing away. Industrial\r\nprogress slowed down; and, though the advance from the \"Hungry 'Forties\"\r\nhad been immense, men began to see the limit of what they could\r\nreasonably expect from retrenchment and Free Trade. The work of Mr.\r\nHenry George awakened new interest in problems of poverty, and the\r\nidealism of William Morris gave new inspiration to Socialist propaganda.\r\nMeanwhile, the teaching of Green and the enthusiasm of Toynbee were\r\nsetting Liberalism free from the shackles of an individualist conception\r\nof liberty and paving the way for the legislation of our own time.\r\nLastly, the Fabian Society brought Socialism down from heaven and\r\nestablished a contact with practical politics and municipal government.\r\nHad Great Britain been an island in the mid-Pacific the onward movement\r\nwould have been rapid and undeviating in its course. As it was, the new\r\nideas were reflected in the parliament and the cabinet of 1880-1885, and\r\nthe Radicalism of Birmingham barely kept on terms with the Whiggery of\r\nthe clubs. A redistribution of social forces which would amalgamate the\r\ninterests of \"property\" on the one side and those of democracy on the\r\nother was imminent, and on social questions democracy reinforced by the\r\nenfranchisement of the rural labourers in 1884 stood to win. At this\r\nstage the Irish question came to a head. Mr. Gladstone declared for Home\r\nRule, and the party fissure took place on false lines. The upper and\r\nmiddle classes in the main went over to Unionism, but they took with\r\nthem a section of the Radicals, while Mr. Gladstone's personal force\r\nretained on the Liberal side a number of men whose insight into the\r\nneeds of democracy was by no means profound. The political fight was for\r\nthe moment shifted from the social question to the single absorbing\r\nissue of Home Rule, and the new Unionist party enjoyed twenty years of\r\nalmost unbroken supremacy. Again, had the Home Rule issue stood alone it\r\nmight have been settled in 1892, but meanwhile in the later 'eighties\r\nthe social question had become insistent. Socialism, ceasing to be a\r\nmerely academic force, had begun to influence organized labour, and had\r\ninspired the more generous minds among the artisans with the\r\ndetermination to grapple with the problem of the unskilled workmen. From\r\nthe Dockers' strike of 1889 the New Unionism became a fighting force in\r\npublic affairs, and the idea of a Labour party began to take shape. On\r\nthe new problems Liberalism, weakened as it already had been, was\r\nfurther divided, and its failure in 1892 is to be ascribed far more to\r\nthis larger cause than to the dramatic personal incident of the Parnell\r\ndivorce. In office without legislative power from 1892 to 1895, the\r\nLiberal party only experienced further loss of credit, and the rise of\r\nImperialism swept the whole current of public interest in a new\r\ndirection. The Labour movement itself was paralyzed, and the defeat of\r\nthe Engineers in 1897 put an end to the hope of achieving a great social\r\ntransformation by the method of the strike. But, in the meanwhile,\r\nopinion was being silently transformed. The labours of Mr. Charles Booth\r\nand his associates had at length stated the problem of poverty in\r\nscientific terms. Social and economic history was gradually taking shape\r\nas a virtually new branch of knowledge. The work of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney\r\nWebb helped to clear up the relations between the organized efforts of\r\nworkmen and the functions of the State. The discerning observer could\r\ntrace the \"organic filaments\" of a fuller and more concrete social\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the Liberal ranks many of the most influential men\r\nhad passed, without consciousness of the transition, under the sway of\r\nquite opposite influences. They were becoming Imperialists in their\r\nsleep, and it was only as the implications of Imperialism became\r\nevident that they were awakened. It was with the outbreak of the South\r\nAfrican War that the new development of Conservative policy first\r\ncompelled the average Liberal to consider his position. It needed the\r\nshock of an outspoken violation of right to stir him; and we may date\r\nthe revival of the idea of justice in the party as an organized force\r\nfrom the speech in the summer of 1901 in which Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman set himself against the stream of militant sentiment\r\nand challenged in a classic phrase the methods of the war. From the day\r\nof this speech, which was supposed at the time to have irretrievably\r\nruined his political career, the name of the party-leader, hitherto\r\ngreeted with indifference, became a recognized signal for the cheers of\r\na political meeting, and a man with no marked genius but that of\r\ncharacter and the insight which character gave into the minds of his\r\nfollowers acquired in his party the position of a Gladstone. This was\r\nthe first and fundamental victory, the reinstatement of the idea of\r\nRight in the mind of Liberalism. Then, as the Conservative attack\r\ndeveloped and its implications became apparent, one interest after\r\nanother of the older Liberalism was rudely shaken into life. The\r\nEducation Act of 1902 brought the Nonconformists into action. The Tariff\r\nReform movement put Free Trade on its defence, and taught men to realize\r\nwhat the older economics of Liberalism had done for them. The Socialists\r\nof practical politics, the Labour Party, found that they could by no\r\nmeans dispense with the discipline of Cobden. Free Trade finance was to\r\nbe the basis of social reform. Liberalism and Labour learned to\r\nco-operate in resisting delusive promises of remedies for unemployment\r\nand in maintaining the right of free international exchange. Meanwhile,\r\nLabour itself had experienced the full brunt of the attack. It had come\r\nnot from the politicians but from the judges, but in this country we\r\nhave to realize that within wide limits the judges are in effect\r\nlegislators, and legislators with a certain persistent bent which can be\r\nheld in check only by the constant vigilance and repeated efforts of the\r\nrecognized organ for the making and repeal of law. In destroying the old\r\nposition of the Trade Unions, the judges created the modern Labour party\r\nand cemented its alliance with Liberalism. Meanwhile, the aftermath of\r\nImperialism in South Africa was reaped, and Conservative disillusionment\r\nunlocked the floodgates for the advancing tide of the Liberal revival.\r\n\r\nThe tide has by no means spent itself. If it no longer rushes in an\r\nelectoral torrent as in 1906 it flows in a steady stream towards social\r\namelioration and democratic government. In this movement it is now\r\nsufficiently clear to all parties that the distinctive ideas of\r\nLiberalism have a permanent function. The Socialist recognizes with\r\nperfect clearness, for example, that popular government is not a\r\nmeaningless shibboleth, but a reality that has to be maintained and\r\nextended by fighting. He is well aware that he must deal with the House\r\nof Lords and the Plural vote if he is to gain his own ends. He can no\r\nlonger regard these questions as difficulties interposed by half-hearted\r\nLiberals to distract attention from the Social problem. He is aware that\r\nthe problem of Home Rule and of devolution generally is an integral part\r\nof the organization of democracy. And, as a rule, he not merely\r\nacquiesces in the demand of women for a purely political right, but only\r\nquarrels with the Liberal party for its tardiness in meeting the\r\ndemand. The old Liberal idea of peace and retrenchment again is\r\nrecognized by the Socialistic, and indeed by the whole body of social\r\nreformers, as equally essential for the successful prosecution of their\r\naims. Popular budgets will bring no relief to human suffering if the\r\nrevenues that they secure are all to go upon the most expensive ship\r\nthat is the fashion of the moment, nor can the popular mind devote\r\nitself to the improvement of domestic conditions while it is distracted\r\neither by ambitions or by scares. On the other side, the Liberal who\r\nstarts from the Gladstonian tradition has in large measure realized that\r\nif he is to maintain the essence of his old ideas it must be through a\r\nprocess of adaptation and growth. He has learnt that while Free Trade\r\nlaid the foundations of prosperity it did not erect the building. He has\r\nto acknowledge that it has not solved the problems of unemployment, of\r\nunderpayment, of overcrowding. He has to look deeper into the meaning of\r\nliberty and to take account of the bearing of actual conditions on the\r\nmeaning of equality. As an apostle of peace and an opponent of swollen\r\narmaments, he has come to recognize that the expenditure of the social\r\nsurplus upon the instruments of progress is the real alternative to its\r\nexpenditure on the instruments of war. As a Temperance man he is coming\r\nto rely more on the indirect effect of social improvement on the one\r\nhand and the elimination of monopolist profit on the other, than on the\r\nuncertain chances of absolute prohibition.\r\n\r\nThere are, then, among the composite forces which maintained the Liberal\r\nGovernment in power through the crisis of 1910, the elements of such an\r\norganic view as may inspire and direct a genuine social progress.\r\nLiberalism has passed through its Slough of Despond, and in the give and\r\ntake of ideas with Socialism has learnt, and taught, more than one\r\nlesson. The result is a broader and deeper movement in which the cooler\r\nand clearer minds recognize below the differences of party names and in\r\nspite of certain real cross-currents a genuine unity of purpose. What\r\nare the prospects of this movement? Will it be maintained? Is it the\r\nsteady stream to which we have compared it, or a wave which must\r\ngradually sink into the trough?\r\n\r\nTo put this question is to ask in effect whether democracy is in\r\nsubstance as well as in form a possible mode of government. To answer\r\nthis question we must ask what democracy really means, and why it is the\r\nnecessary basis of the Liberal idea. The question has already been\r\nraised incidentally, and we have seen reason to dismiss both the\r\nindividualist and the Benthamite argument for popular government as\r\nunsatisfactory. We even admitted a doubt whether some of the concrete\r\nessentials of liberty and social justice might not, under certain\r\nconditions, be less fully realized under a widely-extended suffrage than\r\nunder the rule of a superior class or a well-ordered despotism. On what,\r\nthen, it may be asked, do we found our conception of democracy? Is it on\r\ngeneral principles of social philosophy, or on the special conditions of\r\nour own country or of contemporary civilization? And how does our\r\nconception relate itself to our other ideas of the social order? Do we\r\nassume that the democracy will in the main accept these ideas, or if it\r\nrejects them are we willing to acquiesce in its decision as final? And\r\nin the end what do we expect? Will democracy assert itself, will it find\r\na common purpose and give it concrete shape? Or will it blunder on, the\r\npassive subject of scares and ambitions, frenzies of enthusiasm and\r\ndejection, clay in the hands of those whose profession it is to model it\r\nto their will.\r\n\r\nFirst as to the general principle. Democracy is not founded merely on\r\nthe right or the private interest of the individual. This is only one\r\nside of the shield. It is founded equally on the function of the\r\nindividual as a member of the community. It founds the common good upon\r\nthe common will, in forming which it bids every grown-up, intelligent\r\nperson to take a part. No doubt many good things may be achieved for a\r\npeople without responsive effort on its own part. It may be endowed with\r\na good police, with an equitable system of private law, with education,\r\nwith personal freedom, with a well-organized industry. It may receive\r\nthese blessings at the hands of a foreign ruler, or from an enlightened\r\nbureaucracy or a benevolent monarch. However obtained, they are all very\r\ngood things. But the democratic theory is that, so obtained, they lack a\r\nvitalizing element. A people so governed resembles an individual who has\r\nreceived all the external gifts of fortune, good teachers, healthy\r\nsurroundings, a fair breeze to fill his sails, but owes his prosperous\r\nvoyage to little or no effort of his own. We do not rate such a man so\r\nhigh as one who struggles through adversity to a much less eminent\r\nposition. What we possess has its intrinsic value, but how we came to\r\npossess it is also an important question. It is so with a society. Good\r\ngovernment is much, but the good will is more, and even the imperfect,\r\nhalting, confused utterance of the common will may have in it the\r\npotency of higher things than a perfection of machinery can ever attain.\r\n\r\nBut this principle makes one very large assumption. It postulates the\r\nexistence of a common will. It assumes that the individuals whom it\r\nwould enfranchise can enter into the common life and contribute to the\r\nformation of a common decision by a genuine interest in public\r\ntransactions. Where and in so far as this assumption definitely fails,\r\nthere is no case for democracy. Progress, in such a case, is not wholly\r\nimpossible, but it must depend on the number of those who do care for\r\nthe things that are of social value, who advance knowledge or \"civilize\r\nlife through the discoveries of art,\" or form a narrow but effective\r\npublic opinion in support of liberty and order. We may go further.\r\nWhatever the form of government progress always does in fact depend on\r\nthose who so think and live, and on the degree in which these common\r\ninterests envelop their life and thought. Now, complete and wholehearted\r\nabsorption in public interests is rare. It is the property not of the\r\nmass but of the few, and the democrat is well aware that it is the\r\nremnant which saves the people. He subjoins only that if their effort is\r\nreally to succeed the people must be willing to be saved. The masses who\r\nspend their toilsome days in mine or factory struggling for bread have\r\nnot their heads for ever filled with the complex details of\r\ninternational policy or industrial law. To expect this would be absurd.\r\nWhat is not exaggerated is to expect them to respond and assent to the\r\nthings that make for the moral and material welfare of the country, and\r\nthe position of the democrat is that the \"remnant\" is better occupied in\r\nconvincing the people and carrying their minds and wills with it than in\r\nimposing on them laws which they are concerned only to obey and enjoy.\r\nAt the same time, the remnant, be it never so select, has always much to\r\nlearn. Some men are much better and wiser than others, but experience\r\nseems to show that hardly any man is so much better or wiser than others\r\nthat he can permanently stand the test of irresponsible power over them.\r\nOn the contrary, the best and wisest is he who is ready to go to the\r\nhumblest in a spirit of inquiry, to find out what he wants and why he\r\nwants it before seeking to legislate for him. Admitting the utmost that\r\ncan be said for the necessity of leadership, we must at the same time\r\ngrant that the perfection of leadership itself lies in securing the\r\nwilling, convinced, open-eyed support of the mass.\r\n\r\nThus individuals will contribute to the social will in very varying\r\ndegrees, but the democratic thesis is that the formation of such a will,\r\nthat is, in effect, the extension of intelligent interest in all manner\r\nof public things, is in itself a good, and more than that, it is a\r\ncondition qualifying other good things. Now the extension of interest is\r\nnot to be created by democratic forms of government, and if it neither\r\nexists nor can be brought into existence, democracy remains an empty\r\nform and may even be worse than useless. On the other hand, where the\r\ncapacity exists the establishment of responsible government is the\r\nfirst condition of its development. Even so it is not the sole\r\ncondition. The modern State is a vast and complex organism. The\r\nindividual voter feels himself lost among the millions. He is\r\nimperfectly acquainted with the devious issues and large problems of the\r\nday, and is sensible how little his solitary vote can affect their\r\ndecision. What he needs to give him support and direction is\r\norganization with his neighbours and fellow workers. He can understand,\r\nfor example, the affairs of his trade union, or, again, of his chapel.\r\nThey are near to him. They affect him, and he feels that he can affect\r\nthem. Through these interests, again, he comes into touch with wider\r\nquestions--with a Factory Bill or an Education Bill--and in dealing with\r\nthese questions he will now act as one of an organized body, whose\r\ncombined voting strength will be no negligible quantity. Responsibility\r\ncomes home to him, and to bring home responsibility is the problem of\r\nall government. The development of social interest--and that is\r\ndemocracy--depends not only on adult suffrage and the supremacy of the\r\nelected legislature, but on all the intermediate organizations which\r\nlink the individual to the whole. This is one among the reasons why\r\ndevolution and the revival of local government, at present crushed in\r\nthis country by a centralized bureaucracy, are of the essence of\r\ndemocratic progress.\r\n\r\nThe success of democracy depends on the response of the voters to the\r\nopportunities given them. But, conversely, the opportunities must be\r\ngiven in order to call forth the response. The exercise of popular\r\ngovernment is itself an education. In considering whether any class or\r\nsex or race should be brought into the circle of enfranchisement, the\r\ndetermining consideration is the response which that class or sex or\r\nrace would be likely to make to the trust. Would it enter effectively\r\ninto the questions of public life, or would it be so much passive voting\r\nmaterial, wax in the hands of the less scrupulous politicians? The\r\nquestion is a fair one, but people are too ready to answer it in the\r\nless favourable sense on the ground of the actual indifference or\r\nignorance which they find or think they find among the unenfranchised.\r\nThey forget that in that regard enfranchisement itself may be precisely\r\nthe stimulus needed to awaken interest, and while they are impressed\r\nwith the danger of admitting ignorant and irresponsible, and perhaps\r\ncorruptible voters to a voice in the government, they are apt to\r\noverlook the counterbalancing danger of leaving a section of the\r\ncommunity outside the circle of civic responsibility. The actual work of\r\ngovernment must affect, and also it must be affected by, its relation to\r\nall who live within the realm. To secure good adaptation it ought, I\r\nwill not say to reflect, but at least to take account of, the\r\ndispositions and circumstances of every class in the population. If any\r\none class is dumb, the result is that Government is to that extent\r\nuninformed. It is not merely that the interests of that class may\r\nsuffer, but that, even with the best will, mistakes may be made in\r\nhandling it, because it cannot speak for itself. Officious spokesmen\r\nwill pretend to represent its views, and will obtain, perhaps, undue\r\nauthority merely because there is no way of bringing them to book. So\r\namong ourselves does the press constantly represent public opinion to be\r\none thing while the cold arithmetic of the polls conclusively declares\r\nit to be another. The ballot alone effectively liberates the quiet\r\ncitizen from the tyranny of the shouter and the wire-puller.\r\n\r\nI conclude that an impression of existing inertness or ignorance is not\r\na sufficient reason for withholding responsible government or\r\nrestricting the area of the suffrage. There must be a well-grounded view\r\nthat political incapacity is so deep-rooted that the extension of\r\npolitical rights would tend only to facilitate undue influence by the\r\nless scrupulous sections of the more capable part of the people. Thus\r\nwhere we have an oligarchy of white planters in the midst of a coloured\r\npopulation, it is always open to doubt whether a general\r\ncolour-franchise will be a sound method of securing even-handed justice.\r\nThe economic and social conditions may be such that the \"coloured\" man\r\nwould just have to vote as his master told him, and if the elementary\r\nrights are to be secured for all it may be that a semi-despotic system\r\nlike that of some of our Crown colonies is the best that can be devised.\r\nOn the other side, that which is most apt to frighten a governing class\r\nor race, a clamour on the part of an unenfranchised people for political\r\nrights, is to the democrat precisely the strongest reason that he can\r\nhave in the absence of direct experience for believing them fit for the\r\nexercise of civic responsibility. He welcomes signs of dissatisfaction\r\namong the disfranchised as the best proof of awakening interest in\r\npublic affairs, and he has none of those fears of ultimate social\r\ndisruption which are a nightmare to bureaucracies because experience has\r\nsufficiently proved to him the healing power of freedom, of\r\nresponsibility, and of the sense of justice. Moreover, a democrat cannot\r\nbe a democrat for his own country alone. He cannot but recognize the\r\ncomplex and subtle interactions of nation upon nation which make every\r\nlocal success or failure of democracy tell upon other countries. Nothing\r\nhas been more encouraging to the Liberalism of Western Europe in recent\r\nyears than the signs of political awakening in the East. Until yesterday\r\nit seemed as though it would in the end be impossible to resist the\r\nultimate \"destiny\" of the white races to be masters of the rest of the\r\nworld. The result would have been that, however far democracy might\r\ndevelop within any Western State, it would always be confronted with a\r\ncontrary principle in the relation of that State to dependencies, and\r\nthis contradiction, as may easily be seen by the attentive student of\r\nour own political constitutions, is a standing menace to domestic\r\nfreedom. The awakening of the Orient, from Constantinople to Pekin, is\r\nthe greatest and most hopeful political fact of our time, and it is with\r\nthe deepest shame that English Liberals have been compelled to look on\r\nwhile our Foreign Office has made itself the accomplice in the attempt\r\nto nip Persian freedom in the bud, and that in the interest of the most\r\nruthless tyranny that has ever crushed the liberties of a white people.\r\n\r\nThe cause of democracy is bound up with that of internationalism. The\r\nrelation is many-sided. It is national pride, resentment, or ambition\r\none day that sweeps the public mind and diverts it from all interest in\r\ndomestic progress. The next day the same function is performed no less\r\nadequately by a scare. The practice of playing on popular emotions has\r\nbeen reduced to a fine art which neither of the great parties is ashamed\r\nto employ. Military ideals possess the mind, and military expenditure\r\neats up the public resources. On the other side, the political economic\r\nand social progress of other nations reacts on our own. The backwardness\r\nof our commercial rivals in industrial legislation was long made an\r\nargument against further advances among ourselves. Conversely, when they\r\ngo beyond us, as now they often do, we can learn from them. Physically\r\nthe world is rapidly becoming one, and its unity must ultimately be\r\nreflected in political institutions. The old doctrine of absolute\r\nsovereignty is dead. The greater States of the day exhibit a complex\r\nsystem of government within government, authority limited by authority,\r\nand the world-state of the not impossible future must be based on a free\r\nnational self-direction as full and satisfying as that enjoyed by Canada\r\nor Australia within the British Empire at this moment. National\r\nemulation will express itself less in the desire to extend territory or\r\nto count up ships and guns, and more in the endeavour to magnify the\r\ncontribution of our own country to civilized life. Just as in the\r\nrebirth of our municipal life we find a civic patriotism which takes\r\ninterest in the local university, which feels pride in the magnitude of\r\nthe local industry, which parades the lowest death rate in the country,\r\nwhich is honestly ashamed of a bad record for crime or pauperism, so as\r\nEnglishmen we shall concern ourselves less with the question whether two\r\nof our Dreadnoughts might not be pitted against one German, and more\r\nwith the question whether we cannot equal Germany in the development of\r\nscience, of education, and of industrial technique. Perhaps even,\r\nrecovering from our present artificially induced and radically insincere\r\nmood of national self-abasement, we shall learn to take some pride in\r\nour own characteristic contributions as a nation to the arts of\r\ngovernment, to the thought, the literature, the art, the mechanical\r\ninventions which have made and are re-making modern civilization.\r\n\r\nStanding by national autonomy and international equality, Liberalism is\r\nnecessarily in conflict with the Imperial idea as it is ordinarily\r\npresented. But this is not to say that it is indifferent to the\r\ninterests of the Empire as a whole, to the sentiment of unity pervading\r\nits white population, to all the possibilities involved in the bare fact\r\nthat a fourth part of the human race recognizes one flag and one supreme\r\nauthority. In relation to the self-governing colonies the Liberal of\r\ntoday has to face a change in the situation since Cobden's time not\r\nunlike that which we have traced in other departments. The Colonial\r\nEmpire as it stands is in substance the creation of the older\r\nLiberalism. It is founded on self-government, and self-government is the\r\nroot from which the existing sentiment of unity has sprung. The problem\r\nof our time is to devise means for the more concrete and living\r\nexpression of this sentiment without impairing the rights of\r\nself-government on which it depends. Hitherto the \"Imperialist\" has had\r\nmatters all his own way and has cleverly exploited Colonial opinion, or\r\nan appearance of Colonial opinion, in favour of class ascendancy and\r\nreactionary legislation in the mother country. But the colonies include\r\nthe most democratic communities in the world. Their natural sympathies\r\nare not with the Conservatives, but with the most Progressive parties in\r\nthe United Kingdom. They favour Home Rule, they set the pace in social\r\nlegislation. There exist accordingly the political conditions of a\r\ndemocratic alliance which it is the business of the British Liberal to\r\nturn to account. He may hope to make his country the centre of a group\r\nof self-governing, democratic communities, one of which, moreover,\r\nserves as a natural link with the other great commonwealth of\r\nEnglish-speaking people. The constitutional mechanism of the new unity\r\nbegins to take shape in the Imperial Council, and its work begins to\r\ndefine itself as the adjustment of interests as between different\r\nportions of the Empire and the organization of common defence. Such a\r\nunion is no menace to the world's peace or to the cause of freedom. On\r\nthe contrary, as a natural outgrowth of a common sentiment, it is one of\r\nthe steps towards a wider unity which involves no backstroke against the\r\nideal of self-government. It is a model, and that on no mean scale, of\r\nthe International State.\r\n\r\nInternationalism on the one side, national self-government on the other,\r\nare the radical conditions of the growth of a social mind which is the\r\nessence, as opposed to the form, of democracy. But as to form itself a\r\nword must, in conclusion, be said. If the forms are unsuitable the will\r\ncannot express itself, and if it fails of adequate expression it is in\r\nthe end thwarted, repressed and paralyzed. In the matter of form the\r\ninherent difficulty of democratic government, whether direct or\r\nrepresentative, is that it is government by majority, not government by\r\nuniversal consent. Its decisions are those of the larger part of the\r\npeople, not of the whole. This defect is an unavoidable consequence of\r\nthe necessities of decision and the impossibility of securing universal\r\nagreement. Statesmen have sought to remedy it by applying something of\r\nthe nature of a brake upon the process of change. They have felt that to\r\njustify a new departure of any magnitude there must be something more\r\nthan a bare majority. There must either be a large majority, two-thirds\r\nor three-fourths of the electorate, or there must be some friction to be\r\novercome which will serve to test the depth and force as well as the\r\nnumerical extent of the feeling behind the new proposal. In the United\r\nKingdom we have one official brake, the House of Lords, and several\r\nunofficial ones, the civil service, the permanent determined opposition\r\nof the Bench to democratic measures, the Press, and all that we call\r\nSociety. All these brakes act in one way only. There is no brake upon\r\nreaction--a lack which becomes more serious in proportion as the\r\nConservative party acquires a definite and constructive policy of its\r\nown. In this situation the Liberal party set itself to deal with the\r\nofficial brake by the simple method of reducing its effective strength,\r\nbut, to be honest, without having made up its mind as to the nature of\r\nthe brake which it would like to substitute. On this question a few\r\ngeneral remarks would seem to be in place. The function of a check on\r\nthe House of Commons is to secure reconsideration. Conservative leaders\r\nare in the right when they point to the accidental elements that go to\r\nthe constitution of parliamentary majorities. The programme of any\r\ngeneral election is always composite, and a man finds himself compelled,\r\nfor example, to choose between a Tariff Reformer whose views on\r\neducation he approves, and a Free Trader whose educational policy he\r\ndetests. In part this defect might be remedied by the Proportional\r\nsystem to which, whether against the grain or not, Liberals will find\r\nthemselves driven the more they insist on the genuinely representative\r\ncharacter of the House of Commons. But even a Proportional system would\r\nnot wholly clear the issues before the electorate. The average man\r\ngives his vote on the question which he takes to be most important in\r\nitself, and which he supposes to be most likely to come up for immediate\r\nsettlement. But he is always liable to find his expectations defeated,\r\nand a Parliament which is in reality elected on one issue may proceed to\r\ndeal with quite another. The remedy proposed by the Parliament Bill was\r\na two years' delay, which, it was held, would secure full discussion and\r\nconsiderable opportunity for the manifestation of opinion should it be\r\nadverse. This proposal had been put to the constituencies twice over,\r\nand had been ratified by them if any legislative proposal ever was\r\nratified. It should enable the House of Commons, as the representatives\r\nof the people, to decide freely on the permanent constitution of the\r\ncountry. The Bill itself, however, does not lay down the lines of a\r\npermanent settlement. For, to begin with, in leaving the constitution of\r\nthe House of Lords unaltered it provides a one-sided check, operating\r\nonly on democratic measures which in any case have to run the gauntlet\r\nof the permanent officials, the judges, the Press, and Society. For\r\npermanent use the brake must be two-sided. Secondly, it is to be feared\r\nthat the principle of delay would be an insufficient check upon a large\r\nand headstrong majority. What is really needed is that the people should\r\nhave the opportunity of considering a proposal afresh. This could be\r\nsecured in either of two ways: (1) by allowing the suspensory veto of\r\nthe Second Chamber to hold a measure over to a new Parliament; (2) by\r\nallowing the House of Commons to submit a bill in the form in which it\r\nfinally leaves the House to a direct popular vote. It is to my mind\r\nregrettable that so many Liberals should have closed the door on the\r\nReferendum. It is true that there are many measures to which it would be\r\nill suited. For example, measures affecting a particular class or a\r\nparticular locality would be apt to go by the board. They might command\r\na large and enthusiastic majority among those primarily affected by\r\nthem, but only receive a languid assent elsewhere, and they might be\r\ndefeated by a majority beaten up for extraneous purposes among those\r\nwithout first-hand knowledge of the problems with which they are\r\nintended to deal. Again, if a referendum were to work at all it would\r\nonly be in relation to measures of the first class, and only, if the\r\npublic convenience is to be consulted, on very rare occasions. In all\r\nordinary cases of insuperable difference between the Houses, the\r\ngovernment of the day would accept the postponement of the measure till\r\nthe new Parliament. But there are measures of urgency, measures of\r\nfundamental import, above all, measures which cut across the ordinary\r\nlines of party, and with which, in consequence, our system is impotent\r\nto deal, and on these the direct consultation of the people would be the\r\nmost suitable method of solution.[13]\r\n\r\nWhat we need, then, is an impartial second chamber distinctly\r\nsubordinate to the House of Commons, incapable of touching finance and\r\ntherefore of overthrowing a ministry, but able to secure the submission\r\nof a measure either to the direct vote of the people or to the verdict\r\nof a second election--the government of the day having the choice\r\nbetween the alternatives. Such a chamber might be instituted by direct\r\npopular election. But the multiplication of elections is not good for\r\nthe working of democracy, and it would be difficult to reconcile a\r\ndirectly elected house to a subordinate position. It might, therefore,\r\nas an alternative, be elected on a proportional system by the House of\r\nCommons itself, its members retaining their seat for two Parliaments. To\r\nbridge over the change half of the chamber for the present Parliament\r\nmight be elected by the existing House of Lords, and their\r\nrepresentatives retiring at the end of this Parliament would leave the\r\nnext House of Commons and every future House of Commons with one-half of\r\nthe chamber to elect. This Second Chamber would then reflect in equal\r\nproportions the existing and the last House of Commons, and the balance\r\nbetween parties should be fairly held.[14] This chamber would have\r\nample power of securing reasonable amendments and would also have good\r\nground for exercising moderation in pressing its views. If the public\r\nwere behind the measure it would know that in the end the House of\r\nCommons could carry it in its teeth, whether by referendum or by a\r\nrenewed vote of confidence at a general election. The Commons, on their\r\nside, would have reasons for exhibiting a conciliatory temper. They\r\nwould not wish to be forced either to postpone or to appeal. As to which\r\nmethod they would choose they would have absolute discretion, and if\r\nthey went to the country with a series of popular measures hung up and\r\nawaiting their return for ratification, they would justly feel\r\nthemselves in a strong position.\r\n\r\nSo far as to forms. The actual future of democracy, however, rests upon\r\ndeeper issues. It is bound up with the general advance of civilization.\r\nThe organic character of society is, we have seen, in one sense, an\r\nideal. In another sense it is an actuality. That is to say, nothing of\r\nany import affects the social life on one side without setting up\r\nreactions all through the tissue. Hence, for example, we cannot\r\nmaintain great political progress without some corresponding advance on\r\nother sides. People are not fully free in their political capacity when\r\nthey are subject industrially to conditions which take the life and\r\nheart out of them. A nation as a whole cannot be in the full sense free\r\nwhile it fears another or gives cause of fear to another. The social\r\nproblem must be viewed as a whole. We touch here the greatest weakness\r\nin modern reform movements. The spirit of specialism has invaded\r\npolitical and social activity, and in greater and greater degree men\r\nconsecrate their whole energy to a particular cause to the almost\r\ncynical disregard of all other considerations. \"Not such the help, nor\r\nthese the defenders\" which this moment of the world's progress needs.\r\nRather we want to learn our supreme lesson from the school of Cobden.\r\nFor them the political problem was one, manifold in its ramifications\r\nbut undivided in its essence. It was a problem of realizing liberty. We\r\nhave seen reason to think that their conception of liberty was too thin,\r\nand that to appreciate its concrete content we must understand it as\r\nresting upon mutual restraint and value it as a basis of mutual aid.\r\nFor us, therefore, harmony serves better as a unifying conception. It\r\nremains for us to carry it through with the same logical cogency, the\r\nsame practical resourcefulness, the same driving force that inspired the\r\nearlier Radicals, that gave fire to Cobden's statistics, and lent\r\ncompelling power to the eloquence of Bright. We need less of the\r\nfanatics of sectarianism and more of the unifying mind. Our reformers\r\nmust learn to rely less on the advertising value of immediate success\r\nand more on the deeper but less striking changes of practice or of\r\nfeeling, to think less of catching votes and more of convincing opinion.\r\nWe need a fuller co-operation among those of genuine democratic feeling\r\nand more agreement as to the order of reform. At present progress is\r\nblocked by the very competition of many causes for the first place in\r\nthe advance. Here, again, devolution will help us, but what would help\r\nstill more would be a clearer sense of the necessity of co-operation\r\nbetween all who profess and call themselves democrats, based on a fuller\r\nappreciation of the breadth and the depth of their own meaning. The\r\nadvice seems cold to the fiery spirits, but they may come to learn that\r\nthe vision of justice in the wholeness of her beauty kindles a passion\r\nthat may not flare up into moments of dramatic scintillation, but burns\r\nwith the enduring glow of the central heat.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] I need hardly add that financial measures are entirely unsuited to\r\na referendum. Financial and executive control go together, and to take\r\neither of them out of the hands of the majority in the House of Commons\r\nis not to reform our system but to destroy it root and branch. The same\r\nis not true of legislative control. There are cases in which a\r\ngovernment might fairly submit a legislative measure to the people\r\nwithout electing to stand or fall by it.\r\n\r\n[14] Probably the best alternative to these proposals is that of a small\r\ndirectly elected Second Chamber, with a provision for a joint session in\r\ncase of insuperable disagreement, but with no provision for delay. This\r\nproposal has the advantage, apparently, of commanding a measure of\r\nConservative support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKE.--Second Treatise on Civil Government (1689).\r\n\r\nPAINE.--The Rights of Man (1792).\r\n\r\nBENTHAM.--Principles of Morals and Legislation (1789!).\r\n\r\nJ.
