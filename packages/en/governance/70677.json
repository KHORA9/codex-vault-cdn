They are designed to\r\nsuggest new lines of historical research rather than to treat the\r\nsubject in an exhaustive fashion. This apology is not intended as an\r\nanticipation of the criticism of reviewers, but as a confession of fact.\r\nNo one can appreciate more fully than I do how much of the work here\r\noutlined remains to be done. The records of the Treasury Department at\r\nWashington, now used for the first time in connection with a study of\r\nthe formation of the Constitution, furnish a field for many years’\r\nresearch, to say nothing of the other records, printed and unprinted,\r\nwhich throw light upon the economic conditions of the United States\r\nbetween 1783–1787.\r\n\r\nIf it be asked why such a fragmentary study is printed now, rather than\r\nheld for the final word, my explanation is brief. I am unable to give\r\nmore than an occasional period to uninterrupted studies, and I cannot\r\nexpect, therefore, to complete within a reasonable time the survey which\r\nI have made here. Accordingly, I print it in the hope that a few of this\r\ngeneration of historical scholars may be encouraged to turn away from\r\nbarren “political” history to a study of the real economic forces which\r\ncondition great movements in politics.\r\n\r\nStudents already familiar with the field here surveyed will discover\r\nthat I have made full use of the suggestive work already done by\r\nProfessor Turner, Drs. Libby, Ambler, and Schaper.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. Merwin of the Treasury Department for his great\r\ncourtesy in making available the old records under his jurisdiction; to\r\nMr. Bishop, of the Library of Congress, for facilitating the examination\r\nof thousands of pamphlets as well as for other favors; and to Mr.\r\nFitzpatrick, of the Manuscript Division, for keeping his good humor\r\nwhile bringing out hundreds of manuscripts which seemed to yield results\r\nwholly out of proportion to the labor entailed.\r\n\r\nI am under deep obligation to two friends, nameless here, without whose\r\ngenerous sympathy and encouragement, this volume could not have been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n                                                       CHARLES A.

The first of these,\r\nwhich may be justly associated with the name of Bancroft, explains the\r\nlarger achievements in our national life by reference to the peculiar\r\nmoral endowments of a people acting under divine guidance; or perhaps it\r\nwould be more correct to say, it sees in the course of our development\r\nthe working out of a higher will than that of man. There is to be\r\nobserved in the history of the struggle for the Constitution, to use\r\nBancroft’s words, “the movement of the divine power which gives unity to\r\nthe universe, and order and connection to events.”[1]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such statements, scattered through Bancroft’s pages, it\r\nis impossible to describe in a single phrase the ideal that controlled\r\nhis principles of historical construction, because he was so often\r\nswayed by his deference to the susceptibilities of the social class from\r\nwhich he sprang and by the exigencies of the public life in which he\r\nplayed a by no means inconspicuous part. Even telling the whole truth\r\ndid not lie upon his conscience, for, speaking on the question of the\r\nnumber of Americans who were descendants from transported felons and\r\nindented servants, he said that “Having a hand full, he opened his\r\nlittle finger.”[2]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Bancroft constantly recurs in his writings to that “higher\r\npower” which is operating in human affairs, although he avoids citing\r\nspecific events which may be attributed to it. It appears to him to be\r\nthe whole course of history, rather than any event or set of events,\r\nwhich justifies his theory. “However great,” he says, “may be the number\r\nof those who persuade themselves that there is in man nothing superior\r\nto himself, history interposes with evidence that tyranny and wrong lead\r\ninevitably to decay; that freedom and right, however hard may be the\r\nstruggle, always prove resistless. Through this assurance ancient\r\nnations learn to renew their youth; the rising generation is incited to\r\ntake a generous part in the grand drama of time; and old age, staying\r\nitself upon sweet Hope as its companion and cherisher, not bating a jot\r\nof courage, nor seeing cause to argue against the hand or the will of a\r\nhigher power, stands waiting in the tranquil conviction that the path of\r\nhumanity is still fresh with the dews of morning, that the Redeemer of\r\nthe nations liveth.”[3]\r\n\r\nThe second school of historical interpretation, which in the order of\r\ntime followed that of Bancroft, may be called the Teutonic, because it\r\nascribes the wonderful achievements of the English-speaking peoples to\r\nthe peculiar political genius of the Germanic race. Without distinctly\r\nrepudiating the doctrine of the “higher power” in history, it finds the\r\nsecret to the “free” institutional development of the Anglo-Saxon world\r\nin innate racial qualities.\r\n\r\nThe thesis of this school is, in brief, as follows. The Teutonic peoples\r\nwere originally endowed with singular political talents and aptitudes;\r\nTeutonic tribes invaded England and destroyed the last vestiges of the\r\nolder Roman and British culture; they then set an example to the world\r\nin the development of “free” government. Descendants of this specially\r\ngifted race settled America and fashioned their institutions after old\r\nEnglish models. The full fruition of their political genius was reached\r\nin the creation of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nFor more than a generation the Teutonic theory of our institutions\r\ndeeply influenced historical research in the United States; but it was\r\nexhausted in the study of local government rather than of great epochs;\r\nand it produced no monument of erudition comparable to Stubbs’\r\n_Constitutional History of England_. Whatever may be said of this\r\nschool, which has its historical explanation and justification,[4] it\r\nserved one exceedingly useful purpose: it was scrupulously careful in\r\nthe documentation of its preconceptions and thus cultivated a more\r\ncritical spirit than that which characterized the older historians.[5]\r\n\r\nThe third school of historical research is not to be characterized by\r\nany phrase. It is marked rather by an absence of hypotheses. Its\r\nrepresentatives, seeing the many pitfalls which beset the way of earlier\r\nwriters, have resolutely turned aside from “interpretation” in the\r\nlarger sense, and concerned themselves with critical editions of the\r\ndocuments and with the “impartial” presentation of related facts. This\r\ntendency in American scholarship has been fruitful in its results, for\r\nit has produced more care in the use of historical sources and has given\r\nus many excellent and accurate surveys of outward events which are\r\nindispensable to the student who would inquire more deeply into\r\nunderlying causes.[6]\r\n\r\nSuch historical writing, however, bears somewhat the same relation to\r\nscientific history which systematic botany bears to ecology; that is, it\r\nclassifies and orders phenomena, but does not explain their proximate or\r\nremote causes and relations. The predominance of such a historical ideal\r\nin the United States and elsewhere is not altogether inexplicable; for\r\ninterpretative schools seem always to originate in social\r\nantagonisms.[7] The monarchy, in its rise and development, was never\r\ncorrectly understood as long as it was regarded by all as a mystery\r\nwhich must not be waded into, as James I put it, by ordinary mortals.\r\nWithout the old régime there would have been no Turgot and Voltaire;\r\nMetternich and Joseph de Maistre came after the Revolution.\r\n\r\nBut the origin of different schools of interpretation in controversies\r\nand the prevalence of many mere preconceptions bolstered with a show of\r\nlearning should not lead us to reject without examination any new\r\nhypothesis, such as the theory of economic determinism, on the general\r\nassumption of Pascal “that the will, the imagination, the disorders of\r\nthe body, the thousand concealed infirmities of the intelligence\r\nconspire to reduce our discovery of justice and truth to a process of\r\nhaphazard, in which we more often miss than hit the mark.” Such a\r\ndoctrine of pessimism would make of equal value for the student who\r\nwould understand, for instance, such an important matter as the origin\r\nof the state, Mr. Edward Jenk’s severely scientific _History of\r\nPolitics_ and Dr. Nathaniel Johnston’s _The Excellency of Monarchical\r\nGovernment, especially the English Monarchy, wherein is largely treated\r\nof the Several Benefits of Kingly Government and the Inconvenience of\r\nCommonwealths.... Likewise the Duty of Subjects and the Mischief of\r\nFaction, Sedition, and Rebellion_, published in 1686.\r\n\r\nIt is not without significance, however, that almost the only work in\r\neconomic interpretation which has been done in the United States seems\r\nto have been inspired at the University of Wisconsin by Professor\r\nTurner, now of Harvard. Under the direction of this original scholar and\r\nthinker, the influence of the material circumstances of the frontier on\r\nAmerican politics was first clearly pointed out. Under his direction\r\nalso the most important single contribution to the interpretation of the\r\nmovement for the federal Constitution was made: O. G. Libby’s\r\n_Geographical Distribution of the Vote of the Thirteen States on the\r\nFederal Constitution_.\r\n\r\nIn a preface to this work, Professor Turner remarks that the study was\r\ndesigned to contribute “to an understanding of the relations between the\r\npolitical history of the United States, and the physiographic, social,\r\nand economic conditions underlying this history.... It is believed that\r\nmany phases of our political history have been obscured by the attention\r\npaid to state boundaries and to the sectional lines of North and South.\r\nAt the same time the economic interpretation of our history has been\r\nneglected. In the study of the persistence of the struggle for state\r\nparticularism in American constitutional history, it was inevitable that\r\nwriters should make prominent the state as a political factor. But, from\r\nthe point of view of the rise and growth of sectionalism and\r\nnationalism, it is much more important to note the existence of great\r\nsocial and economic areas, independent of state lines, which have acted\r\nas units in political history, and which have changed their political\r\nattitude as they changed their economic organization and divided into\r\nnew groups.”[8]\r\n\r\nAlthough the hypothesis that economic elements are the chief factors in\r\nthe development of political institutions has thus been used in one or\r\ntwo serious works, and has been more or less discussed as a philosophic\r\ntheory,[9] it has not been applied to the study of American history at\r\nlarge—certainly not with that infinite detailed analysis which it\r\nrequires. Nor has it received at the hands of professed historians that\r\nattention which its significance warrants. On the contrary, there has\r\nbeen a tendency to treat it with scant courtesy and to dismiss it with a\r\nsharpness bordering on contempt.[10] Such summary judgment is, of\r\ncourse, wholly unwarranted and premature; for as Dr. William Cunningham\r\nremarks, the validity of no hypothesis can be determined until it has\r\nbeen worked to its utmost limits. It is easier to write a bulky volume\r\nfrom statutes, congressional debates,[11] memoirs, and diplomatic notes\r\nthan it is to ascertain the geographical distribution and political\r\nsignificance of any important group of economic factors. The theory of\r\neconomic determinism has not been tried out in American history, and\r\nuntil it is tried out, it cannot be found wanting.\r\n\r\nSadly as the economic factors have been ignored in historical studies,\r\nthe neglect has been all the more pronounced in the field of private and\r\npublic law. The reason for this is apparent. The aim of instruction in\r\nthese subjects is intensely practical; there are few research\r\nprofessorships in law; and the “case” system of teaching discourages\r\nattempts at generalization and surveys.[12] Not even the elementary work\r\nhas been done. There has been no generous effort to describe the merely\r\nsuperficial aspects of the development of private law in the United\r\nStates. There has been no concerted attempt to bring together and make\r\navailable to students the raw materials of such a history. Most of the\r\ncurrent views on the history of our law are derived from occasional\r\ndisquisitions of judges which are all too frequently shot through with\r\ncurious errors of fact and conception.\r\n\r\nNor has England advanced far beyond us in the critical interpretation of\r\nlegal evolution—its explanation in terms of, or in relation to, the\r\nshifting economic processes and methods in which the law is tangled. It\r\nis true that English scholars have produced admirable histories of the\r\nlaw in its outward aspects, such as the monumental work of Pollock and\r\nMaitland; and they have made marvellous collections of raw materials,\r\nlike the publications of the Selden Society. But apart from scattered\r\nand brilliant suggestions thrown off occasionally by Maitland[13] in\r\npassing, no interpretation has been ventured, and no effort has been\r\nmade to connect legal phases with economic changes.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of a critical analysis of legal evolution, all sorts of\r\nvague abstractions dominate most of the thinking that is done in the\r\nfield of law. The characteristic view of the subject taken by American\r\ncommentators and lawyers immersed in practical affairs is perhaps summed\r\nup as finely by Carter as by any writer. “In free, popular states,” he\r\nsays, “the law springs from and is made by the people; and as the\r\nprocess of building it up consists in applying, from time to time, to\r\nhuman actions the popular ideal or standard of justice, justice is only\r\ninterest consulted in the work.... The law of England and America has\r\nbeen a pure development proceeding from a constant endeavor to apply to\r\nthe civil conduct of men the ever advancing standard of justice.”[14] In\r\nother words, law is made out of some abstract stuff known as “justice.”\r\nWhat set the standard in the beginning and why does it advance?\r\n\r\nThe devotion to deductions from “principles” exemplified in particular\r\ncases, which is such a distinguishing sign of American legal thinking,\r\nhas the same effect upon correct analysis which the adherence to\r\nabstract terms had upon the advancement of learning—as pointed out by\r\nBacon. The absence of any consideration of the social and economic\r\nelements determining the thought of the thinkers themselves is all the\r\nmore marked when contrasted with the penetration shown by European\r\nsavants like Jhering, Menger, and Stammler. Indeed, almost the only\r\nindication of a possible economic interpretation to be found in current\r\nAmerican jurisprudence is implicit in the writings of a few scholars,\r\nlike Professor Roscoe Pound and Professor Goodnow,[15] and in occasional\r\nopinions rendered by Mr. Justice Holmes of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States.[16]\r\n\r\nWhat has here been said about our private law may be more than repeated\r\nabout our constitutional history and law. This subject, though it has\r\nlong held an honorable position in the American scheme of learning, has\r\nnot yet received the analytical study which its intrinsic importance\r\nmerits. In the past, it has often been taught in the law schools by\r\nretired judges who treated it as a branch of natural and moral\r\nphilosophy or by practical lawyers who took care for the instant need of\r\nthings. Our great commentaries, Kent, Story, Miller, are never\r\npenetrating; they are generally confined to statements of fact; and\r\ndesigned to inculcate the spirit of reverence rather than of\r\nunderstanding. And of constitutional histories, strictly speaking, we\r\nhave none, except the surveys of superficial aspects by Curtis and\r\nBancroft.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the juristic theory of the origin and nature of the\r\nConstitution is marked by the same lack of analysis of determining\r\nforces which characterized older historical writing in general. It may\r\nbe stated in the following manner: The Constitution proceeds from the\r\nwhole people; the people are the original source of all political\r\nauthority exercised under it; it is founded on broad general principles\r\nof liberty and government entertained, for some reason, by the whole\r\npeople and having no reference to the interest or advantage of any\r\nparticular group or class. “By calm meditation and friendly councils,”\r\nsays Bancroft, “they [the people] had prepared a Constitution which, in\r\nthe union of freedom with strength and order, excelled every one known\r\nbefore.... In the happy morning of their existence as one of the powers\r\nof the world, they had chosen justice for their guide; and while they\r\nproceeded on their way with a well-founded confidence and joy, all the\r\nfriends of mankind invoked success on their endeavor as the only hope\r\nfor renovating the life of the civilized world.”[17]\r\n\r\nWith less exaltation, Chief Justice Marshall states the theory, in his\r\nopinion in the case of McCulloch _v._ Maryland: “The government proceeds\r\ndirectly from the people; is ‘ordained and established’ in the name of\r\nthe people; and is declared to be ordained ‘in order to form a more\r\nperfect union, to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and\r\nsecure the blessings of liberty’ to themselves and to their posterity.\r\nThe assent of the states, in their sovereign capacity, is implied in\r\ncalling a convention, and thus submitting that instrument to the people.\r\nBut the people were at perfect liberty to accept or reject it; and their\r\nact was final.... The government of the Union, then (whatever may be the\r\ninfluence of this fact on the case) is emphatically and truly a\r\ngovernment of the people. In form and in substance it emanates from\r\nthem. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be exercised directly\r\non them, and for their benefit.... It is the government of all; its\r\npowers are delegated by all; it represents all, and acts for all.”[18]\r\n\r\nIn the juristic view, the Constitution is not only the work of the whole\r\npeople, but it also bears in it no traces of the party conflict from\r\nwhich it emerged. Take, for example, any of the traditional legal\r\ndefinitions of the Constitution; Miller’s will suffice: “A constitution,\r\nin the American sense of the word, is any instrument by which the\r\nfundamental powers of the government are established, limited, and\r\ndefined, and by which these powers are distributed among the several\r\ndepartments for their more safe and useful exercise, for the benefit of\r\nthe body politic.... It is not, however, the origin of private rights,\r\nnor the foundation of laws. It is not the cause, but the consequence of\r\npersonal and political freedom. It declares those natural and\r\nfundamental rights of individuals, for the security and common enjoyment\r\nof which governments are established.”[19]\r\n\r\nNowhere in the commentaries is there any evidence of the fact that the\r\nrules of our fundamental law are designed to protect any class in its\r\nrights, or secure the property of one group against the assaults of\r\nanother. “The Constitution,” declares Bancroft, “establishes nothing\r\nthat interferes with equality and individuality. It knows nothing of\r\ndifferences by descent, or opinions, of favored classes, or legalized\r\nreligion, or the political power of property. It leaves the individual\r\nalong-side of the individual.... As the sea is made up of drops,\r\nAmerican society is composed of separate, free, and constantly moving\r\natoms, ever in reciprocal action ... so that the institutions and laws\r\nof the country rise out of the masses of individual thought, which, like\r\nthe waters of the ocean, are rolling evermore.”[20]\r\n\r\nIn turning from the vague phraseology of Bancroft to an economic\r\ninterpretation of constitutional history, it is necessary to realize at\r\nthe outset that law is not an abstract thing, a printed page, a volume\r\nof statutes, a statement by a judge. So far as it becomes of any\r\nconsequence to the observer it must take on a real form; it must govern\r\nactions; it must determine positive relations between men; it must\r\nprescribe processes and juxtapositions.[21] A statute may be on the\r\nbooks for an age, but unless, under its provisions, a determinate\r\narrangement of human relations is brought about or maintained, it exists\r\nonly in the imagination. Separated from the social and economic fabric\r\nby which it is, in part, conditioned and which, in turn, it helps to\r\ncondition, it has no reality.\r\n\r\nNow, most of the law (except the elemental law of community defence) is\r\nconcerned with the property relations of men, which reduced to their\r\nsimple terms mean the processes by which the ownership of concrete forms\r\nof property is determined or passes from one person to another. As\r\nsociety becomes more settled and industrial in character, mere defence\r\nagainst violence (a very considerable portion of which originates in\r\nforcible attempts to change the ownership of property) becomes of\r\nrelatively less importance; and property relations increase in\r\ncomplexity and subtlety.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that constitutional law is a peculiar branch of the\r\nlaw; that it is not concerned primarily with property or with property\r\nrelations, but with organs of government, the suffrage, administration.\r\nThe superficiality of this view becomes apparent at a second glance.\r\nInasmuch as the primary object of a government, beyond the mere\r\nrepression of physical violence, is the making of the rules which\r\ndetermine the property relations of members of society, the dominant\r\nclasses whose rights are thus to be determined must perforce obtain from\r\nthe government such rules as are consonant with the larger interests\r\nnecessary to the continuance of their economic processes, or they must\r\nthemselves control the organs of government. In a stable despotism the\r\nformer takes place; under any other system of government, where\r\npolitical power is shared by any portion of the population, the methods\r\nand nature of this control become the problem of prime importance—in\r\nfact, the fundamental problem in constitutional law. The social\r\nstructure by which one type of legislation is secured and another\r\nprevented—that is, the constitution—is a secondary or derivative feature\r\narising from the nature of the economic groups seeking positive action\r\nand negative restraint.\r\n\r\nIn what has just been said there is nothing new to scholars who have\r\ngiven any attention to European writings on jurisprudence. It is based\r\nin the first instance on the doctrine advanced by Jhering that law does\r\nnot “grow,” but is, in fact, “made”—adapted to precise interests which\r\nmay be objectively determined.[22] It was not original with Jhering.\r\nLong before he worked out the concept in his epoch-making book, _Der\r\nZweck im Recht_, Lassalle had set it forth in his elaborate _Das System\r\nder erworbenen Rechte_,[23] and long before Lassalle had thought it\r\nthrough, our own Madison had formulated it, after the most wide-reaching\r\nresearches in history and politics.[24]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the inquiry which follows is based upon the political science\r\nof James Madison, the father of the Constitution and later President of\r\nthe Union he had done so much to create. This political science runs\r\nthrough all of his really serious writings and is formulated in its most\r\nprecise fashion in _The Federalist_[25] as follows: “The diversity in\r\nthe faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is\r\nnot less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The\r\nprotection of these faculties is the first object of government. From\r\nthe protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property,\r\nthe possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately\r\nresults; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of\r\nthe respective proprietors, ensues a division of society into different\r\ninterests and parties.... The most common and durable source of factions\r\nhas been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who\r\nhold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct\r\ninterests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are\r\ndebtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a\r\nmanufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with\r\nmany lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations and\r\ndivide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and\r\nviews. The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms\r\nthe principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of\r\nparty and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the\r\ngovernment.”\r\n\r\nHere we have a masterly statement of the theory of economic determinism\r\nin politics.[26] Different degrees and kinds of property inevitably\r\nexist in modern society; party doctrines and “principles” originate in\r\nthe sentiments and views which the possession of various kinds of\r\nproperty creates in the minds of the possessors; class and group\r\ndivisions based on property lie at the basis of modern government; and\r\npolitics and constitutional law are inevitably a reflex of these\r\ncontending interests. Those who are inclined to repudiate the hypothesis\r\nof economic determinism as a European importation must, therefore,\r\nrevise their views, on learning that one of the earliest, and certainly\r\none of the clearest, statements of it came from a profound student of\r\npolitics who sat in the Convention that framed our fundamental law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe requirements for an economic interpretation of the formation and\r\nadoption of the Constitution may be stated in a hypothetical proposition\r\nwhich, although it cannot be verified absolutely from ascertainable\r\ndata, will at once illustrate the problem and furnish a guide to\r\nresearch and generalization.\r\n\r\nIt will be admitted without controversy that the Constitution was the\r\ncreation of a certain number of men, and it was opposed by a certain\r\nnumber of men. Now, if it were possible to have an economic biography of\r\nall those connected with its framing and adoption,—perhaps about 160,000\r\nmen altogether,—the materials for scientific analysis and classification\r\nwould be available. Such an economic biography would include a list of\r\nthe real and personal property owned by all of these men and their\r\nfamilies: lands and houses, with incumbrances, money at interest,\r\nslaves, capital invested in shipping and manufacturing, and in state and\r\ncontinental securities.\r\n\r\nSuppose it could be shown from the classification of the men who\r\nsupported and opposed the Constitution that there was no line of\r\nproperty division at all; that is, that men owning substantially the\r\nsame amounts of the same kinds of property were equally divided on the\r\nmatter of adoption or rejection—it would then become apparent that the\r\nConstitution had no ascertainable relation to economic groups or\r\nclasses, but was the product of some abstract causes remote from the\r\nchief business of life—gaining a livelihood.\r\n\r\nSuppose, on the other hand, that substantially all of the merchants,\r\nmoney lenders, security holders, manufacturers, shippers, capitalists,\r\nand financiers and their professional associates are to be found on one\r\nside in support of the Constitution and that substantially all or the\r\nmajor portion of the opposition came from the non-slaveholding farmers\r\nand the debtors—would it not be pretty conclusively demonstrated that\r\nour fundamental law was not the product of an abstraction known as “the\r\nwhole people,” but of a group of economic interests which must have\r\nexpected beneficial results from its adoption? Obviously all the facts\r\nhere desired cannot be discovered, but the data presented in the\r\nfollowing chapters bear out the latter hypothesis, and thus a reasonable\r\npresumption in favor of the theory is created.\r\n\r\nOf course, it may be shown (and perhaps can be shown) that the farmers\r\nand debtors who opposed the Constitution were, in fact, benefited by the\r\ngeneral improvement which resulted from its adoption. It may likewise be\r\nshown, to take an extreme case, that the English nation derived immense\r\nadvantages from the Norman Conquest and the orderly administrative\r\nprocesses which were introduced, as it undoubtedly did; nevertheless, it\r\ndoes not follow that the vague thing known as “the advancement of\r\ngeneral welfare” or some abstraction known as “justice” was the\r\nimmediate, guiding purpose of the leaders in either of these great\r\nhistoric changes. The point is, that the direct, impelling motive in\r\nboth cases was the economic advantages which the beneficiaries expected\r\nwould accrue to themselves first, from their action. Further than this,\r\neconomic interpretation cannot go. It may be that some larger\r\nworld-process is working through each series of historical events; but\r\nultimate causes lie beyond our horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                 A SURVEY OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN 1787\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole theory of the economic interpretation of history rests upon\r\nthe concept that social progress in general is the result of contending\r\ninterests in society—some favorable, others opposed, to change. On this\r\nhypothesis, we are required to discover at the very outset of the\r\npresent study what classes and social groups existed in the United\r\nStates just previous to the adoption of the Constitution and which of\r\nthem, from the nature of their property, might have expected to benefit\r\nimmediately and definitely by the overthrow of the old system and the\r\nestablishment of the new. On the other hand, it must be discovered which\r\nof them might have expected more beneficial immediate results, on the\r\nwhole, from the maintenance of the existing legal arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a survey of the distribution of property in 1787 for\r\neconomic as well as political history is so evident that it is strange\r\nthat no attempt has been made to undertake it on a large scale. Not even\r\na beginning has been made. It is, therefore, necessary for us to rely\r\nfor the present upon the general statements of historians who have\r\nwritten more or less at length about the period under consideration; but\r\nin the meanwhile it can do no harm to suggest, by way of a preface, the\r\noutlines of such a survey and some of the chief sources of information.\r\n\r\nI. In the first place, there were the broad interests of real property\r\nwhich constituted, in 1787, a far larger proportion of all wealth than\r\nit does at the present time. The size, value, and ownership of holdings\r\nand their geographical distribution ought to be ascertained. In the\r\nabsence of a general census, the preparation of such an economic survey\r\nwould entail an enormous labor, and it could never be more than\r\napproximately complete. Neither the census of 1790 nor the assessment\r\nfor direct taxes under the law of 1798 covers this topic. The assessment\r\nrolls of the several states for taxation, wherever available, would\r\nyield the data desired, at least in part; but a multitude of local\r\nrecords would have to be consulted with great scrutiny and critical\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nII. In order to ascertain the precise force of personalty in the\r\nformation and adoption of the Constitution, it would be necessary to\r\ndiscover not only the amount and geographical distribution[27] of money\r\nand public securities; but also the exact fields of operation in which\r\npersonalty looked for immediate and prospective gains. A complete\r\nanalysis of the economic forces in the Constitution-making process would\r\nrequire the following data:—\r\n\r\n1. The geographic distribution of money on hand and loaned and the names\r\nof the holders. It is apparent that much of the material from which\r\nevidence on these points may be obtained has disappeared; but an\r\nintensive study of the tax returns of the states, the records of the\r\nlocal assessors, wills probated, mortgages recorded, and suits in courts\r\nover loans and mortgages, would no doubt produce an immense amount of\r\nilluminating information.\r\n\r\n2. The geographic distribution and ownership of the public securities.\r\nFortunately the unpublished and unworked records of the Treasury\r\nDepartment at Washington throw great light on this fundamental problem.\r\nShortly after the federal government was established the old debt was\r\nconverted into a new consolidated, or funded, debt; and holders of\r\npublic securities, state and continental, brought their papers to their\r\nlocal loan office (one for each state) or to the Treasury to have them\r\nrecorded and transformed into the stocks of the new government.\r\n\r\nThe records of this huge transaction (which was the first really great\r\nachievement of nascent capitalism in the United States), if they had\r\nbeen kept intact, would constitute, perhaps, the most wonderful single\r\ncollection on economic history ever possessed by any country. Were they\r\ncomplete, they would form a veritable Domesday Book of the politics\r\nduring the first years of the new government. But unfortunately they are\r\nnot complete. The records of Hamilton’s administration at the Treasury\r\nitself seem to have largely disappeared, and the records of the loan\r\noffices in the several states are generally fragmentary, although in one\r\nor two instances they are indeed monumental.\r\n\r\nA complete set of these financial documents should show: (1) the owners\r\nof certificates of the old government as issued, during the Revolution\r\nand afterward, to original holders; (2) the transfers of certificates\r\nfrom original holders to other parties; (3) the names of those who held\r\ncertificates in 1787, when the Convention was called to frame the\r\nConstitution; (4) the records of transactions in stocks between the\r\nannouncement of the Convention’s work and the adoption of Hamilton’s\r\nfunding system; (5) the names of those who brought in securities for\r\nfunding into the new debt; (6) the names of those for whom the brokers,\r\nwhose names appear on the loan office books, were, in fact, operating.\r\n\r\nNone of the records preserved at the Treasury Department presents all of\r\nthe evidence required for the scientific study of a single state. Nearly\r\none-third of the operations were at the Treasury and of these only a\r\nmeagre fragment seems to have escaped the ravages of time. In the\r\ndocuments of some of the commonwealths, however, it is possible to\r\nascertain the names of hundreds of patriots who risked their money in\r\noriginal certificates or received certificates for services rendered.\r\nThe books of a few loan offices are so kept that it can be easily\r\ndiscovered who brought in securities to be funded into the new debt and\r\nalso to whom these securities were originally issued.\r\n\r\nIn some states the ledgers were carefully preserved and it is possible\r\nto find out the names and addresses of the holders of securities funded\r\nat the local loan office and the amount held by each person. The ledgers\r\nof Connecticut, for example, offer a rich field for the study of the\r\nnames and geographical distribution of public creditors, and the tracing\r\nof these interests through their myriad local ramifications would afford\r\nan interesting and profitable undertaking. But unfortunately multitudes\r\nof the most significant operations are forever lost; it is to be\r\nparticularly deplored that the “powers of attorney” for the period are\r\nnot forthcoming. Unless the Government at Washington follows the example\r\nof enlightened administrations in Europe and establishes a Hall of\r\nRecords, the precious volumes which have come down to us will be worked\r\nonly with great difficulty, if they do not disintegrate and disappear\r\naltogether.[28]\r\n\r\n3. The geographic distribution of small mortgaged farms and their\r\nconnection with various schemes for depreciation of the currency and\r\nimpairment of the obligation of contract. No doubt work in local records\r\nwould yield valuable results in this field.\r\n\r\n4. Owners and operators in western lands. Speculation in western lands\r\nwas one of the leading activities of capitalists in those days. As is\r\nwell known, the soldiers were paid in part in land scrip and this scrip\r\nwas bought up at low prices by dealers, often with political\r\nconnections. Furthermore, large areas had been bought outright for a few\r\ncents an acre and were being held for a rise in value. The chief\r\nobstacle in the way of the rapid appreciation of these lands was the\r\nweakness of the national government which prevented the complete\r\nsubjugation of the Indians, the destruction of old Indian claims, and\r\nthe orderly settlement of the frontier. Every leading capitalist of the\r\ntime thoroughly understood the relation of a new constitution to the\r\nrise in land values beyond the Alleghanies. This idea was expressed, for\r\nexample, by Hugh Williamson, a member of the Convention from North\r\nCarolina and a land speculator in a letter to Madison.[29] The materials\r\nfor the study of land operations exist in enormous quantities, largely\r\nin manuscript form in Washington; and a critical scrutiny of the\r\nthousands of names that appear on these records, in their political\r\nrelations, would afford results beyond all measure. Here, too, is the\r\nwork for a lifetime.\r\n\r\n5. The geographic distribution of manufacturing establishments and the\r\nnames of owners and investors. On this important topic a mass of printed\r\nand manuscript materials exists, but no attempt has yet been made to\r\ncatalogue the thousands of names of persons with a view to establishing\r\npolitical connections. To produce the materials for this study, searches\r\nmust be made in the local records from New Hampshire to Georgia. Wills\r\nprobated, transfers of property, law suits, private papers,\r\nadvertisements in newspapers, shipping records, Hamilton’s\r\ncorrespondence in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress,\r\nunclassified Treasury Records and correspondence, and innumerable other\r\nsources must be searched and lists of names and operations made.\r\n\r\nPending the enormous and laborious researches here enumerated, the\r\nfollowing pages are offered merely as an indication of the way in which\r\nthe superficial aspects of the subject may be treated.[30] In fact, they\r\nsketch the broad outlines of the study which must be filled in and\r\ncorrected by detailed investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE DISFRANCHISED\r\n\r\nIn an examination of the structure of American society in 1787, we first\r\nencounter four groups whose economic status had a definite legal\r\nexpression: the slaves, the indented servants, the mass of men who could\r\nnot qualify for voting under the property tests imposed by the state\r\nconstitutions and laws, and women, disfranchised and subjected to the\r\ndiscriminations of the common law. These groups were, therefore, not\r\nrepresented in the Convention which drafted the Constitution, except\r\nunder the theory that representation has no relation to voting.\r\n\r\nHow extensive the disfranchisement really was cannot be determined.[31]\r\nIn some states, for instance, Pennsylvania and Georgia, propertyless\r\nmechanics in the towns could vote; but in other states the freehold\r\nqualifications certainly excluded a great number of the adult males.\r\n\r\nIn no state, apparently, had the working-class developed a consciousness\r\nof a separate interest or an organization that commanded the attention\r\nof the politicians of the time. In turning over the hundreds of pages of\r\nwritings left by eighteenth-century thinkers one cannot help being\r\nimpressed with the fact that the existence and special problems of a\r\nworking-class, then already sufficiently numerous to form a considerable\r\nportion of society, were outside the realm of politics, except in so far\r\nas the future power of the proletariat was foreseen and feared.[32]\r\n\r\nWhen the question of the suffrage was before the Convention, Madison\r\nwarned his colleagues against the coming industrial masses: “Viewing the\r\nsubject in its merits alone, the freeholders of the Country would be the\r\nsafest depositories of Republican liberty. In future times a great\r\nmajority of the people will not only be without landed, but any other\r\nsort of property. These will either combine under the influence of their\r\ncommon situation; in which case,[33] the rights of property and the\r\npublic liberty will not be secure in their hands, or, which is more\r\nprobable, they will become the tools of opulence and ambition; in which\r\ncase there will be equal danger on another side.”[34]\r\n\r\nSo far as social policy is concerned, however, the working-class problem\r\nhad not made any impression on the statesmen of the time. Hamilton in\r\nhis report on manufactures,[35] dismisses the subject with scant notice.\r\nHe observes that one of the advantages of the extensive introduction of\r\nmachinery will be “the employment of persons who would otherwise be\r\nidle, and in many cases, a burthen on the community, either from bias of\r\ntemper, habit, infirmity of body, or some other cause, indisposing or\r\ndisqualifying them for the toils of the country. It is worthy of remark,\r\nthat, in general, women and children are rendered more useful, and the\r\nlatter more early useful, by manufacturing establishments, than they\r\nwould otherwise be. Of the number of persons employed in the cotton\r\nmanufactories of Great Britain, it is computed that four-sevenths,\r\nnearly, are women and children; of whom the greatest proportion are\r\nchildren, many of them of a tender age.” Apparently this advantage was,\r\nin Hamilton’s view, to accrue principally to the fathers of families,\r\nfor he remarks: “The husbandman himself experiences a new source of\r\nprofit and support, from the increased industry of his wife and\r\ndaughters, invited and stimulated by the demands of the neighboring\r\nmanufactories.”\r\n\r\nPassing beyond these groups which were politically nonexistent, except\r\nin so far as those who possessed the ballot and economic power were\r\ncompelled to safeguard their rights against assaults from such quarters,\r\nwe come to the social groupings within the politically enfranchised\r\nmass. Here we find no legal class distinctions. Social distinctions were\r\nvery sharp, it is true, as every student of manners and customs well\r\nknows; but there were no outward legal signs of special class\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GROUPS OF REAL PROPERTY HOLDERS\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the possessors of property were susceptible of\r\nclassification into several rather marked groups, though of course they\r\nshade off into one another by imperceptible gradations. Broadly\r\nspeaking, there were the interests of real and personal property. Here,\r\nhowever, qualifications must be made. There was no such identity of\r\ninterest between the large planters and the small inland farmers of the\r\nsouth as existed in England between the knights and yeomen. The real\r\nproperty holders may be classified into three general groups: the small\r\nfarmers, particularly back from the sea-coast, scattered from New\r\nHampshire to Georgia, the manorial lords, such as we find along the\r\nbanks of the Hudson,[36] and the slaveholding planters of the south.\r\n\r\n1. The first of these groups, the small farmers, constituted a\r\nremarkably homogeneous class. The inland section was founded and\r\nrecruited by mechanics, the poorer whites, and European (particularly\r\nScotch-Irish) immigrants. It had peculiar social and political views\r\narising from the crude nature of its environment, but its active\r\npolitical doctrines were derived from an antagonism to the seaboard\r\ngroups. One source of conflict was connected with the possession of the\r\nland itself. Much of the western country had been taken up by\r\nspeculators and the settlers were either squatters or purchasers from\r\nlarge holders. This is illustrated by the situation in Virginia, where,\r\nas Ambler points out, “liberality in granting her unoccupied lands did\r\nnot prove to be good policy. True, large numbers of settlers were early\r\nattracted to the state, where they made permanent homes, but much of the\r\nland fell into the hands of speculators. Companies were formed in Europe\r\nand America to deal in Virginia lands, which were bought up in large\r\ntracts at the trifling cost of two cents per acre. This wholesale\r\nengrossment soon consumed practically all the most desirable lands and\r\nforced the home seeker to purchase from speculators or to settle as a\r\nsquatter.”[37] As the settler sought to escape from the speculator by\r\nmoving westward, the frontier line of speculation advanced.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being frequently in debt for their lands, the small\r\nfarmers were dependent upon the towns for most of the capital to develop\r\ntheir resources. They were, in other words, a large debtor class, to\r\nwhich must be added, of course, the urban dwellers who were in a like\r\nunfortunate condition.\r\n\r\nThat this debtor class had developed a strong consciousness of identical\r\ninterests in the several states is clearly evident in local politics and\r\nlegislation.[38] Shays’ Rebellion in Massachusetts, the disturbances in\r\nRhode Island, New Hampshire, and other northern states, the activities\r\nof the paper-money advocates in state legislatures, the innumerable\r\nschemes for the relief of debtors, such as the abolition of\r\nimprisonment, paper money, laws delaying the collection of debts,\r\npropositions requiring debtors to accept land in lieu of specie at a\r\nvaluation fixed by a board of arbitration,—these and many other schemes\r\ntestify eloquently to the fact that the debtors were conscious of their\r\nstatus and actively engaged in establishing their interest in the form\r\nof legal provisions. Their philosophy was reflected in the writings of\r\nLuther Martin, delegate to the Convention from Maryland, who disapproved\r\nof the Constitution, partly on the ground that it would put a stop to\r\nagrarian legislation.[39]\r\n\r\n2. The second group of landed proprietors, the manorial lords of the\r\nHudson valley region, constituted a peculiar aristocracy in itself and\r\nwas the dominant class in the politics of New York during the period\r\nbetween the Revolution and the adoption of the Constitution, as it had\r\nbeen before the War. It was unable or unwilling to block the emission of\r\npaper money, because the burden of that operation fell on the\r\ncapitalists rather than itself. It also took advantage of its\r\npredominance to shift the burden of taxation from the land to\r\nimports,[40] and this fact contributed powerfully to its opposition to\r\nthe Constitution, because it implied a transference of the weight of\r\ntaxation for state purposes to the soil. Its spokesmen indulged in much\r\nhigh talk of state’s rights, in which Federalist leaders refused to see\r\nmore than a hollow sham made to cover the rural gentry’s economic\r\nsupremacy.\r\n\r\n3. The third group of landed proprietors were the slave-holders of the\r\nsouth. It seems curious at the first glance that the representatives of\r\nthe southern states which sold raw materials and wanted competition in\r\nshipping were willing to join in a union that subjected them to\r\ncommercial regulations devised immediately in behalf of northern\r\ninterests. An examination of the records shows that they were aware of\r\nthis apparent incongruity, but that there were overbalancing\r\ncompensations to be secured in a strong federal government.[41]\r\n\r\nMoney-lending and the holding of public securities were not confined to\r\nthe north by any means; although, perhaps, as Calhoun long afterward\r\nremarked,[42] the south was devoid of some of the artifices of commerce\r\nwhich characterized New England. Neither were attempts at relieving\r\ndebtors by legislative enactment restricted to Massachusetts and Rhode\r\nIsland. The south had many men who were rich in personalty, other than\r\nslaves, and it was this type, rather than the slaveholding planter as\r\nsuch, which was represented in the Convention that framed the\r\nConstitution. The majority of the southern delegates at Philadelphia in\r\n1787 were from the towns or combined a wide range of personalty\r\noperations with their planting. On this account there was more identity\r\nof interest among Langdon of Portsmouth, Gerry of Boston, Hamilton of\r\nNew York, Dayton of New Jersey, Robert Morris of Philadelphia, McHenry\r\nof Baltimore, Washington on the Potomac, Williamson of North Carolina,\r\nthe Pinckneys of Charleston, and Pierce of Savannah than between these\r\nseveral men and their debt-burdened neighbors at the back door. Thus\r\nnationalism was created by a welding of economic interests that cut\r\nthrough state boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe southern planter was also as much concerned in maintaining order\r\nagainst slave revolts as the creditor in Massachusetts was concerned in\r\nputting down Shays’ “desperate debtors.” And the possibilities of such\r\nservile insurrections were by no means remote. Every slave-owner must\r\nhave felt more secure in 1789 when he knew that the governor of his\r\nstate could call in the strong arm of the federal administration in case\r\na domestic disturbance got beyond the local police and militia. The\r\nnorth might make discriminatory commercial regulations, but they could\r\nbe regarded as a sort of insurance against conflagrations that might\r\nbring ruin in their train. It was obviously better to ship products\r\nunder adverse legislation than to have no products to ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 GROUPS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY INTERESTS\r\n\r\nA second broad group of interests was that of personal property as\r\ncontrasted with real property. This embraced, particularly, money\r\nloaned, state and continental securities, stocks of goods, manufacturing\r\nplants, soldiers’ scrip, and shipping. The relative proportion of\r\npersonalty to realty in 1787 has not been determined and it is\r\nquestionable whether adequate data are available for settling such an\r\nimportant matter.[43]\r\n\r\nPERSONALTY IN MONEY.—Although personalty in the form of money at\r\ninterest or capital seeking investment did not constitute in 1787\r\nanything like the same amount, relative to the value of real estate,\r\nwhich it does to-day, it must not be thought that it was by any means\r\ninconsiderable in any state. The tax returns of New Hampshire for 1793\r\nreport the value of all buildings and real estate as £893,327:16:10 and\r\nthe amount of money on hand or at interest as £35,985:5:6. The\r\nMassachusetts tax returns of 1792 show £196,698:4:6 at interest and\r\n£95,474:4:5 on hand. The Connecticut returns for 1795 show £63,348: 10:1\r\nat interest.[44]\r\n\r\nMoney capital was suffering in two ways under the Articles of\r\nConfederation. It was handicapped in seeking profitable outlets by the\r\nabsence of protection for manufactures, the lack of security in\r\ninvestments in western lands, and discriminations against American\r\nshipping by foreign countries. It was also being positively attacked by\r\nthe makers of paper money, stay laws, pine barren acts, and other\r\ndevices for depreciating the currency or delaying the collection of\r\ndebts. In addition there was a widespread derangement of the monetary\r\nsystem and the coinage due to the absence of uniformity and stability in\r\nthe standards.[45]\r\n\r\nCreditors, naturally enough, resisted all of these schemes in the state\r\nlegislatures, and failing to find relief there at length turned to the\r\nidea of a national government so constructed as to prevent laws\r\nimpairing the obligation of contract, emitting paper money, and\r\notherwise benefiting debtors. It is idle to inquire whether the rapacity\r\nof the creditors or the total depravity of the debtors (a matter much\r\ndiscussed at the time) was responsible for this deep and bitter\r\nantagonism. It is sufficient for our purposes to discover its existence\r\nand to find its institutional reflex in the Constitution. It was to the\r\ninterest of the creditors to see the currency appreciate, to facilitate\r\nthe process for securing possession of forfeited mortgaged property, and\r\nto hold the rigor of the law before the debtor who was untrue to his\r\nobligations. Whether the creditors were driven into class consciousness\r\nby the assaults of their debtors or attained it by the exercise of their\r\nwits is, for scientific purposes, immaterial.\r\n\r\nPERSONALTY IN PUBLIC SECURITIES.—Even more immediately concerned in the\r\nestablishment of a stable national government were the holders of state\r\nand continental securities. The government under the Articles of\r\nConfederation was not paying the interest on its debt and its paper had\r\ndepreciated until it was selling at from one-sixth to one-twentieth of\r\nits par value.[46] Grave uncertainties as to the actions of legislatures\r\nkept state paper at a low price, also, even where earnest attempts were\r\nbeing made to meet the obligations.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of a strong national government that could discharge this\r\ndebt at its face value is obvious; and it was fully understood at the\r\ntime. The importance of this element of personalty in forcing on the\r\nrevolution that overthrew the Articles of Confederation is all the more\r\napparent when it is remembered that securities constituted a very large\r\nproportion of the intangible wealth. In Massachusetts, for example, it\r\nis set down in 1792 at a sum greater than all the money at interest and\r\non hand in the state.[47]\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public securities of the United States and of the\r\nseveral states at the establishment of the new government was estimated\r\nby Hamilton, in his first report on credit, as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury.[48] The foreign debt, that is, money borrowed abroad, was\r\nfixed at $10,070,307 and arrears of interest up to December, 1789, were\r\nestimated at $1,640,071.62, making a total of $11,710,378.62. The\r\ndomestic continental debt, including the registered debt, army\r\ncertificates, etc., amounted to $27,383,917.74, to which was added\r\narrears of interest to the amount of $13,030,168.20, making a total of\r\n$40,414,085.94. The amount of the state debts was unknown in 1790, but\r\nHamilton placed it at about $25,000,000, which appears to have been\r\nrather high. The issue, later authorized to cover them, was $21,500,000\r\nand the amount actually paid out was $18,271,786.47.[49]\r\n\r\nThe enormous total of the national debt after state and national\r\nsecurities were funded is shown by Hamilton’s report of January 16,\r\n1795:—\r\n\r\n                  Foreign Debt          $13,745,379.35\r\n                  Funded domestic debt   60,789,914.18\r\n                  Unsubscribed debt       1,561,175.14\r\n                  ────────────────────────────────────\r\n                  Total unredeemed debt $76,096,468.67\r\n\r\nIn addition to this sum, there was an amount of $1,400,000 due to the\r\nBank of the United States on account of the loan from that institution,\r\nbut this was more than counterbalanced by the value of the stock.[50]\r\n\r\nIt is evident from this statement that a vast mass of state and\r\ncontinental securities was scattered throughout the country in 1787. The\r\ndegree of its concentration or distribution cannot be determined until\r\nthe Domesday Books of the Treasury Department have been carefully\r\nstudied, and their incompleteness makes an absolute statement\r\nimpossible. The value of this paper in the hands of the holders in the\r\nspring when the Convention met cannot be ascertained with mathematical\r\nprecision, for prices varied from state to state. Furthermore, the\r\nprices obtained by the holders of public paper after Hamilton’s funding\r\nsystem had gone into effect can only be roughly estimated, for it\r\ndepends upon the market in which they were sold. For example, 6 per\r\ncents were bringing 17 shillings in the pound on March 5, 1791, and 22\r\nshillings in the pound on October 3, 1792. On these dates, deferred\r\nsixes were 9/1 and 13/7, respectively, and 3 per cents were 9/1 and\r\n13/1, respectively.[51]\r\n\r\nIf we leave out of account the foreign debt, it appears that some\r\n$60,000,000 worth of potential paper lay in the hands of American\r\ncitizens in the spring of 1787. This paper was changing hands all of the\r\ntime at varying prices. The common selling price in good markets before\r\nthe movement for the Constitution got under way ranged from one-sixth to\r\none-tenth its face value; and some of it sold as low as twenty to one.\r\nIn fact, many holders regarded continental paper as worthless, as it\r\nmight have been had the formation of the Constitution been indefinitely\r\ndelayed. It seems safe to hazard a guess, therefore, that at least\r\n$40,000,000 gain came to the holders of securities through the adoption\r\nof the Constitution and the sound financial system which it made\r\npossible. This leaves out of account the large fortunes won by the\r\nmanipulation of stocks after the government was established and\r\nparticularly after the founding of the New York Stock Exchange in\r\n1792.[52]\r\n\r\nIt should be pointed out, however, that this was not all gain for the\r\noriginal holders of public paper, that is, for those who had loaned the\r\nRevolutionary government money or had rendered it services during the\r\nWar. Nevertheless, they would have lost all their continental securities\r\nunder the prevailing methods of the Congress. As Pitkin points out, “The\r\ninterest of the debt was unpaid, public credit was gone, the debt itself\r\nwas considered of little value, and was sold at last by many of the\r\noriginal holders for about one-tenth of its nominal value.”[53] From\r\nthis point of view, the appreciation due to the adoption of the new\r\ngovernment was so much clear gain, even to original holders; and in some\r\nstates more than one-half of the paper had passed into the hands of\r\nspeculators at low figures.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this huge national debt and of the enormous gain\r\nmade in the appreciation of securities can be understood only in\r\ncomparison with other forms of wealth at that time. Unfortunately, our\r\nstatistics for the period of the formation of the Constitution are\r\nmeagre, but under an act of Congress passed in 1798 a valuation of lands\r\nwas made for the purposes of direct taxation. The surveys were made\r\nbetween the years 1798 and 1804. The following table[54] exhibits the\r\nvalue of lands (not including houses, which amounted to more than\r\n$140,000,000 in addition) in each of the states at the close of the\r\neighteenth century, and also the amount of money paid out by the loan\r\noffices of the respective states for the year 1795 in discharging the\r\ninterest on the public debt and the payment of 2 per cent towards the\r\nreimbursement of the 6 per cent stocks held in the several\r\ncommonwealths:—\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════\r\n                        │                       │    INTEREST, ETC.,\r\n                        │    VALUE OF LANDS     │     DISBURSED[55]\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n New Hampshire          │         $19,028,108.03│             $20,000.00\r\n Massachusetts          │          59,445,642.64│             309,500.00\r\n Rhode Island           │           8,082,355.21│              31,700.00\r\n Connecticut            │          40,163,955.34│              79,600.00\r\n Vermont                │          15,165,484.02│\r\n New York               │          74,885,075.69│             367,600.00\r\n New Jersey             │          27,287,981.89│              27,350.00\r\n Pennsylvania           │          72,824,852.60│              86,379.19\r\n Delaware               │           4,053,248.42│               2,980.00\r\n Maryland               │          21,634,004.57│              74,000.00\r\n Virginia               │          59,976,860.04│              62,300.00\r\n North Carolina         │          27,909,479.70│               3,200.00\r\n South Carolina         │          12,456,720.94│             109,500.00\r\n Georgia                │          10,263,506.95│               6,800.00\r\n Kentucky               │          20,268,325.07│\r\n Tennessee              │           5,847,562.00│\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n          Total         │        $479,293,263.13│          $1,180,909.19\r\n ═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  No table showing the capital amount of the loan office books of the\r\n  states after the funding was complete was discovered, so that interest\r\n  payment is given here.\r\n\r\nTo the total amount of payments made through the loan offices must be\r\nadded the payments made at the Treasury on the securities registered\r\nthere, bringing the total annual interest and capital disbursements to\r\n$2,727,959.07.\r\n\r\nIt seems safe to assume from the table that $400,000,000 would cover the\r\ntotal taxable value of all the lands in the thirteen states in 1787.[56]\r\nVery probably the estimate should be much lower, but letting the figures\r\nstand at this amount, it will be seen that an advance of $40,000,000 in\r\nsecurities would have represented one-tenth of the total taxable value\r\nof all the land in the thirteen United States at the time of the\r\nformation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nTo put the matter in another way: The amount gained by public security\r\nholders through the adoption of the new system was roughly equivalent to\r\nthe value of all the lands as listed for taxation in Connecticut. It was\r\nbut little less than the value of the lands in New Hampshire, Vermont,\r\nand Rhode Island. It was about equivalent to one-half the value of the\r\nlands in New York and to two-thirds the value of the lands in\r\nMassachusetts. It amounted to at least ten dollars for every man, woman,\r\nand child in the whole United States from New Hampshire to Georgia.[57]\r\n\r\nThe significance of the figures showing the annual interest disbursement\r\nalso when the debt had been funded becomes evident only by comparison.\r\nTench Coxe, as commissioner of the revenue, estimated the amount of\r\ngoods, wares, and merchandise exported from the United States between\r\nOctober 1, 1791, and September 30, 1792, at $21,005,568. In other words,\r\nthe annual interest on the domestic debt was more than one-tenth the\r\ntotal value of the goods exported annually. The average imports for each\r\nof the three years ending March 4, 1792, was $19,150,000, so that the\r\ninterest on the domestic debt was more than one-tenth of the value of\r\nthe goods imported into the United States.[58]\r\n\r\nOne of the most potent effective forces of these public securities was\r\nthe Society of the Cincinnati which was composed of the officers of the\r\nRevolutionary Army organized into local branches in the several states.\r\nLike other soldiers, the members of this order had been paid for their\r\npatriotic services partly in land warrants and depreciated paper; but\r\nunlike the privates, they were usually men of some means and were not\r\ncompelled to sacrifice their holdings to speculators at outrageously low\r\nprices. The members of this Society appear in large numbers on the loan\r\noffice records of the several states preserved in the Treasury\r\nDepartment; and many, if not all, of the state branches had funds\r\nderived from this source.\r\n\r\nThe political influence of the Society was recognized in the Convention.\r\nWhen the popular election of President was under consideration, Gerry\r\nobjected to it. “The ignorance of the people,” he said, “would put it in\r\nthe power of some one set of men dispersed through the Union and acting\r\nin concert to delude them into any appointment. He observed that such a\r\nSociety of men existed in the Order of the Cincinnati. They were\r\nrespectable, United, and influential. They will in fact elect the chief\r\nMagistrate in every instance, if the election be referred to the\r\npeople—His respect for the characters composing this Society could not\r\nblind him to the danger and impropriety of throwing such a power into\r\ntheir hands.”[59] In this view Colonel Mason concurred.[60]\r\n\r\nAn observant French chargé d’affaires, writing to his home secretary of\r\nstate for foreign affairs in June, 1787, calls attention to the weight\r\nof the Order of the Cincinnati in the movement for a new government, but\r\nremarks that their power has been greatly exaggerated. “Les Cincinnati,”\r\nhe says, “c’est à dire les officiers de l’ancienne armée américaine,\r\nsont intéressés à l’éstablissement d’un Gouvernement solide, puisqu’ils\r\nsont tous créanciers du public, mais, considérant la foiblesse du\r\nConseil national et l’impossibilité d’être payés par la présente\r\nadministration, ils proposent de jeter tous les États dans une seule\r\nmasse et de mettre à leur tête le gai. Washington avec toutes les\r\nprérogatives et les pouvoirs d’une tête couronné.” He also says that\r\nthey threaten a revolution by arms in case the Convention fails, but\r\nadds that this project is too extravagant to merit the least\r\nconsideration.[61]\r\n\r\nThis society was, however, compactly organized. Correspondence among the\r\nmembers was frequent, extensive, and frank. Almost uniformly, they were\r\nin favor of a reconstruction of the national government on a stronger\r\nbasis.[62] They were bitter in their denunciation of the popular\r\nmovements in the states; particularly Shays’ revolt in Massachusetts.\r\nWar had given them a taste for strong measures, and the wretched\r\nprovisions which had been made for paying them for their military\r\nservices gave them an economic interest in the movement to secure a\r\ngovernment with an adequate taxing power. Moreover, they were\r\nconsolidated by the popular hostility to them on account of their\r\n“secret” and “aristocratic” character.\r\n\r\nPERSONALTY IN MANUFACTURING AND SHIPPING.—The third group of personalty\r\ninterests embraced the manufacturing population, which was not\r\ninconsiderable even at that time. A large amount of capital had been\r\ninvested in the several branches of industry and a superficial study of\r\nthe extensive natural resources at hand revealed the immense\r\npossibilities of capitalistic enterprise. The industrial revolution was\r\nthen getting under way in England and the fame of Arkwright was being\r\nspread abroad in the land. In the survey of the economic interests of\r\nthe members of the federal Convention, given below, it is shown that a\r\nfew leading men were directly connected with industrial concerns,\r\nalthough it is not apparent that the protection of industries was their\r\nchief consideration, in spite of the fact that they did undoubtedly\r\ncontemplate such a system. But outside of the Convention vehement\r\nappeals were made by pamphleteers for protection, on the score that the\r\ndiscriminatory measures of Great Britain were disastrous to American\r\neconomic independence.\r\n\r\nAs early as April, 1785, a memorial from prominent merchants and\r\nbusiness men of Philadelphia was laid before the legislature of the\r\nstate lamenting that Congress did not have “a full and entire power over\r\nthe commerce of the United States,” and praying that the legislature\r\nrequest Congress to lay a proposal conferring such a power before the\r\nstates for their ratification. The memorialists assured the legislature\r\nthat there was a “disposition in the mercantile interest of Pennsylvania\r\nfavorable thereto.”[63] Among the signers were T. Fitzsimons and George\r\nClymer, who were destined to sit in the constitutional Convention as\r\nrepresentatives of the state of Pennsylvania and of the mercantile\r\ninterest which they had so much at heart.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the Constitution were so earnest and so persistent in\r\ntheir assertion that commerce was languishing and manufactures perishing\r\nfor the lack of protection that there must have been some justification\r\nfor their claims, although it is impossible to say how widespread the\r\nhavoc really was. The exaggeration of danger threatened by a tariff\r\nreduction is not peculiar to our times; it was sharply marked in older\r\ndays. That the consumer suffered from the lack of the protection sought\r\nin 1787 by merchants and manufacturers is not apparent. Indeed the\r\n“mechanics and manufacturers of New York” in their humble petition to\r\nCongress for relief in 1789 complain that “their countrymen have been\r\ndeluded by an appearance of plenty; by the profusion of foreign articles\r\nwhich has deluged the country; and thus have mistaken excessive\r\nimportation for a flourishing trade. To this deception they [the\r\npetitioners] impute the continuance of that immoderate prepossession in\r\nfavor of foreign commodities which has been the principal cause of their\r\ndistresses, and the subject of their complaint.”[64]\r\n\r\nThat innumerable manufacturing, shipping, trading, and commercial\r\ninterests did, however, look upon the adoption of the Constitution as\r\nthe sure guarantee that protection could be procured against foreign\r\ncompetition, is fully evidenced in the memorials laid before Congress in\r\nApril, May, and June, 1789, asking for the immediate enactment of\r\ndiscriminatory tariff laws.[65]\r\n\r\nThe first of these petitions was from Baltimore in particular and\r\nMaryland generally, and was communicated to the House of Representatives\r\non April 11, 1789, a few days after that body had settled down to\r\nbusiness. The second was laid before the House a week later by a\r\ncommittee representing the mechanics and manufacturers of New York. On\r\nMay 25, 1789, the shipwrights of Philadelphia laid their pleas before\r\nCongress; and on June 5, the tradesmen and manufacturers of Boston put\r\nin their appearance. These petitions for protection from the four great\r\ntrading and shipping centres of the country, Baltimore, Philadelphia,\r\nNew York, and Boston, which had been most zealous in securing the\r\nestablishment of the new government, are in themselves eloquent\r\ndocuments for the economic interpretation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, from Baltimore, bears the names of two members of\r\nthe federal Convention from that state, Daniel Carroll and James\r\nMcHenry, and the names of two or three hundred other citizens of that\r\ncommunity, the analysis of whose politico-economic connections would\r\ndoubtless repay the detailed scrutiny which the painful labor would\r\nentail. The petition cites the sad state of decline in which\r\nmanufacturing and trading interests have been since the close of the\r\nRevolution and the ineffectual attempts of the states acting alone to\r\nremedy the evils. “The happy period having now arrived,” the\r\nmemorialists exultingly exclaim, “when the United States are placed in a\r\nnew situation; when the adoption of the General Government gives one\r\nsovereign Legislature the sole and exclusive power of laying duties upon\r\nimports; your petitioners rejoice at the prospect this affords them,\r\nthat America, freed from the commercial shackles which have so long\r\nbound her, will see and pursue her true interest, becoming independent\r\nin fact as well as in name; and they confidently hope that the\r\nencouragement and protection of American manufactures will claim the\r\nearliest attention of the supreme Legislature of the nation.”\r\n\r\nThe Maryland petitioners are conscious of no narrow motives in asking\r\nfor relief at the hands of the government: “the number of her poor\r\nincreasing for want of employment; foreign debts accumulating; houses\r\nand lands depreciating in value; trade and manufactures languishing and\r\nexpiring”—these are the evidences of need for the expected legislation.\r\nThey, therefore, ask for duties on all foreign articles that can be made\r\nin America, which will give “a just and decided preference to their\r\nlabors.” And lest Congress might not understand the precise character of\r\nthe relief for which they ask, they append a long list of articles,\r\nwhich are, or can be, manufactured in Maryland, and on which protection\r\nis needed—including ships, hardware, clocks, boots, shoes, saddles,\r\nbrushes, food-stuffs, and raw iron, to mention only a few.\r\n\r\nThe second petition, from the mechanics and manufacturers of New York,\r\nrecites how the memorialists had expected great prosperity on the\r\nsuccessful issue of the Revolution and had seen their hopes blasted “by\r\na system of commercial usurpation, originating in prejudices, and\r\nfostered by a feeble government.” They had struggled in vain against\r\ndire adversity and “wearied by their fruitless exertions, your\r\npetitioners have long looked forward with anxiety to the establishment\r\nof a government which would have the power to check the growing evil,\r\nand extend a protecting hand to the interests of commerce and the arts.\r\nSuch a government is now established. On the promulgation of the\r\nConstitution just now commencing its operations, your petitioners\r\ndiscovered in its principles the remedy which they had so long and so\r\nearnestly desired. They embraced it with ardor, and have supported it\r\nwith persevering attachment.” Lest Congress might not have the\r\ninformation necessary for the formulation of a protective tariff on\r\ncorrect principles, the petitioners subjoined a list of articles\r\nmanufactured in the state and susceptible of protection.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners from Philadelphia, humbly seeking protection for\r\nshipping, lament that the tonnage built at that harbor has fallen to\r\nabout one-third the amount constructed before the Revolution, and call\r\nattention to the fact that the British navigation act totally prevents\r\nthem from building for English customers. They add that they “have\r\nwaited, with anxious expectation, for the sitting of the honourable\r\nCongress under the new Constitution of the United States, firmly relying\r\nthat every exertion would be used to reinstate so necessary and useful a\r\nbranch of business.” Like the representatives from Baltimore and New\r\nYork, they append for the information of Congress a list of suggestions\r\nas to the best method of protecting American shipping interests.\r\n\r\nFinally come the manufacturers and ship builders of Boston.\r\nShip-building with them has also declined since the Revolution, and the\r\nrevival of manufacturing in the north depends upon adequate protection\r\nfrom the federal government. Accordingly they request that “heavy duties\r\nmay be laid on such articles as are manufactured by our own citizens,\r\nhumbly conceiving that the impost is not solely considered by Congress\r\nas an object of _revenue_, but, in its operation, intended to _exclude_\r\nsuch importations, and, ultimately, establish these several branches of\r\nmanufacture among ourselves.” Rope-makers, hatters, pewterers,\r\nsoapboilers, and tallow-chandlers, wool card-makers, ship-carvers,\r\nsailmakers, cabinet-makers, coachmakers, tailors, cordwainers, glue and\r\nstarch makers, brass-founders, and coppersmiths are among the\r\nmemorialists.\r\n\r\nIn the processions which celebrated the adoption of the Constitution in\r\nBoston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and New York, the several\r\nlocal manufacturing concerns were extensively represented by floats and\r\nbanner-men, which shows that they were not unaware of the gain that had\r\nbeen made in their favor by the establishment of the new system. But it\r\nmust not be supposed that the consolidation of interests in support of\r\nthe Constitution was purely local in character. On the contrary it was\r\nnationwide.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Revolution the local groups were being welded into\r\na national interest by correspondence committees. Before the formation\r\nof the Constitution, Boston merchants were sending out appeals to other\r\nmerchants in the several states to join in a national movement for\r\nprotection; and before the new government went into effect, they were\r\nactive in stirring up united action among the merchants and\r\nmanufacturers of the whole country. In 1788, a committee of the\r\nassociation of Boston merchants and manufacturers sent out a circular to\r\n“their brethren in the several seaports of the union,” asking for\r\ncooperation in this grave juncture.[66] To this Boston appeal are\r\nappended the names of John Gray, Gibbins Sharp, Benjamin Austin, Jr.,\r\nLarson Belcher, William Hawes, and Joshua Witherle—all of whom signed\r\nthe petition addressed to Congress the following year asking for\r\nprotection.[67]\r\n\r\nDuring the struggle over the reconstruction, the advocates of a\r\nconstitution made use of the argument that the consumption of foreign\r\nluxuries, manufactured stuffs, was one of the chief causes of the\r\neconomic distress which was said to prevail; and declared that national\r\nlegislation was the only source of relief from this heavy importation. A\r\nwriter in the _American Museum_ for February, 1787, complains that “the\r\narticles of rum and tea alone, which are drank in this country, would\r\npay all its taxes. But when we add sugar, coffee, gauzes, silks,\r\nfeathers, and the whole list of baubles and trinkets, what an enormous\r\nexpense! No wonder you want paper currency. My countrymen are all grown\r\nvery tasty. Feathers and jordans must all be imported. Certainly,\r\ngentlemen, the _devil_ is among you. A Hampshireman, who drinks forty\r\nshillings worth of rum in a year and never thinks of the expense, will\r\nraise a mob to reduce the governor’s salary.”[68]\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut Courant, of November 12, 1787, in an argument for\r\nratification declares: “In the harbour of New York there are now 60\r\nships of which 55 are British. The produce of South Carolina was shipped\r\nin 170 ships, of which 150 were British.... Surely there is not any\r\nAmerican who regards the interest of his country but must see the\r\nimmediate necessity of an efficient federal government; without it the\r\nNorthern states will soon be depopulated and dwindle into poverty, while\r\nthe Southern ones will become silk worms to toil and labour for Europe.”\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, however, that the gloomy view of economic\r\nconditions persistently propagated by the advocates of a new national\r\nsystem was not entertained by all writers of eminence and authority. One\r\nof the members of the Convention, Franklin, early in 1787, before the\r\ncalling of that assembly, declared that the country was, on the whole,\r\nso prosperous that there was every reason for profound thanksgiving.[69]\r\nHe mentioned, it is true, that there were some who complained of hard\r\ntimes, slack trade, and scarcity of money, but he was quick to add that\r\nthere never was an age nor a country in which there were not some people\r\nso circumstanced as to find it hard to make a living and that “it is\r\nalways in the power of a small number to make a great clamour.” But\r\ntaking the several classes in the community as a whole, prosperity,\r\ncontended Franklin, was widespread and obvious. Never was the farmer\r\npaid better prices for his products, “as the published prices current\r\nabundantly testify. The lands he possesses are continually rising in\r\nvalue.” In no part of Europe are the laboring poor so well paid, fed, or\r\nclothed. The fishing trade, he thinks, is in a rather bad way, and\r\nmercantile branches are overcrowded; but he is not distressed by the\r\nextensive importation of English goods, because this is nothing new, and\r\nAmerica has prospered in spite of it.\r\n\r\nIt may very well be that Franklin’s view of the general social\r\nconditions just previous to the formation of the Constitution is\r\nessentially correct and that the defects in the Articles of\r\nConfederation were not the serious menace to the social fabric which the\r\nloud complaints of advocates of change implied. It may be that “the\r\ncritical period” was not such a critical period after all; but a phantom\r\nof the imagination produced by some undoubted evils which could have\r\nbeen remedied without a political revolution. It does not seem to have\r\noccurred to those historians, who have repeated without examination\r\nFiske’s picturesque phrase that it is a serious matter to indict a whole\r\nsystem, an entire epoch, and a whole people. It does not appear that any\r\none has really inquired just what precise facts must be established to\r\nprove that “the bonds of the social order were dissolving.” Certainly,\r\nthe inflamed declarations of the Shaysites are not to be taken as\r\nrepresenting accurately the state of the people, and just as certainly\r\nthe alarmist letters and pamphlets of interested persons on the other\r\nside are not to be accepted without discount. When it is remembered that\r\nmost of our history has been written by Federalists, it will become\r\napparent that great care should be taken in accepting, without reserve,\r\nthe gloomy pictures of the social conditions prevailing under the\r\nArticles of Confederation. In fact, a very learned, though\r\ncontroversial, historian, Henry B. Dawson, in an article published more\r\nthan forty years ago makes out quite a plausible case (documented by\r\nminute research) for the statement that the “chaos” of which historians\r\nare wont to speak when dealing with the history of the years 1783–87,\r\nwas a creation of their fancies.[70]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, and whether or not Franklin’s view is correct,[71]\r\nit cannot be denied that the interests seeking protection were extensive\r\nand diversified. This is conclusively shown by the petitions addressed\r\nto public bodies, by the number of influential men connected with the\r\nmovement, and by the rapidity with which the new government under the\r\nConstitution responded to their demands.\r\n\r\nCAPITAL INVESTED IN WESTERN LANDS.—Although companies had been formed to\r\ndeal in western lands on a large scale before the Revolution, it was not\r\nuntil the close of the War that effective steps were taken toward\r\nsettlement. At that time, says Professor Haskins, “the number of\r\nemigrants, the cheapness of the lands, and the lack of an established\r\nsystem of sale in small quantities offered many inducements for the\r\nformation of great land companies whose opportunities for speculation\r\nwere increased by the depreciated currency and general ignorance\r\nconcerning the West.... ‘All I am now worth was gained by speculations\r\nin land,’ wrote Timothy Pickering [a member of the Pennsylvania\r\nratifying convention] in the same year [1796]; and many eminent men\r\ncould have said the same, often with a later experience quite similar.\r\nLand speculation involved Washington, Franklin, Gallatin, Patrick Henry,\r\nRobert Morris, and James Wilson, as well as many less widely known.”[72]\r\n\r\nThe situation was this: Congress under the Articles of Confederation\r\nadopted a policy of accepting certificates in part payment for lands;\r\nand it was hoped by some that the entire national debt might be\r\nextinguished in this way. However, the weakness of the Confederation,\r\nthe lack of proper military forces, the uncertainty as to the frontiers\r\nkept the values of the large sections held for appreciation at an\r\nabnormally low price. Those who had invested their funds in these lands\r\nor taken stocks in the companies felt the adverse effects of the\r\nprevailing public policy, and foresaw the benefits which might be\r\nexpected from a new and stable government. Their view was tersely put by\r\nWilliamson, a member of the Convention from North Carolina, in a letter\r\nto Madison on June 2, 1788: “For myself, I conceive that my opinions are\r\nnot biassed by private Interests, but having claims to a considerable\r\nQuantity of Land in the Western Country, I am fully persuaded that the\r\nValue of those Lands must be increased by an efficient federal\r\nGovernment.”[73]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weight of the several species of property in politics is not\r\ndetermined by the amount, but rather by the opportunities offered to\r\neach variety for gain and by the degree of necessity for defence against\r\nhostile legislation designed to depreciate values or close opportunities\r\nfor increments. When viewed in this light the reason for the special\r\npressure of personalty in politics in 1787 is apparent. It was receiving\r\nattacks on all hands from the depreciators and it found the way to\r\nprofitable operations closed by governmental action or neglect. If we\r\nmay judge from the politics of the Congress under the Articles of\r\nConfederation, two related groups were most active: those working for\r\nthe establishment of a revenue sufficient to discharge the interest and\r\nprincipal of the public debt, and those working for commercial\r\nregulations advantageous to personalty operations in shipping and\r\nmanufacturing and in western land speculations.[74]\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered also that personalty is usually more active than\r\nreal property. It is centralized in the towns and can draw together for\r\ndefence or aggression with greater facility. The expectation of profits\r\nfrom its manipulation was much larger in 1787 than from real property.\r\nIt had a considerable portion of the professional classes attached to\r\nit; its influence over the press was tremendous, not only through\r\nownership, but also through advertising and other patronage.[75] It was,\r\nin short, the dynamic element in the movement for the new Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                   THE MOVEMENT FOR THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the system of government prevailing in the United States in 1787\r\naffect adversely any of the economic interests enumerated in the\r\npreceding chapter? Furthermore, were the leaders in the movement which\r\nled to the adoption of the Constitution representatives of the interests\r\nso affected?\r\n\r\nFortunately, it is not necessary to devote any considerable attention to\r\nthe first of these questions. It is answered in part above, and all of\r\nthe standard treatises show conclusively that the legal system\r\nprevailing at the opening of 1787 was unfavorable to the property rights\r\nof four powerful groups above enumerated.[76] That system was, in brief,\r\nas follows. There was a loose union of thirteen sovereign states under\r\nthe Articles of Confederation. The national government consisted of a\r\nlegislature of one house in which the states had an equal voting power.\r\nThere was no executive department and no general judiciary. The central\r\ngovernment had no power to regulate commerce or to tax directly; and in\r\nthe absence of these powers all branches of the government were rendered\r\nhelpless. Particularly, money could not be secured to pay the holders of\r\npublic securities, either their interest or principal. Under this\r\nsystem, the state legislatures were substantially without restrictions\r\nor judicial control; private rights in property were continually\r\nattacked by stay laws, legal tender laws, and a whole range of measures\r\nframed in behalf of debtors; and in New England open rebellion had\r\nbroken out.\r\n\r\nThat the economic groups in question looked to a new national government\r\nas the one source of relief and advantage, is shown in a hundred\r\ncontemporary pamphlets and newspaper articles. It was in fact the topic\r\nof the times.\r\n\r\nFor example, a letter from Philadelphia, under date of August 29, 1787,\r\nsums up concisely the interests which were turning to the new\r\nConstitution: “The states neglect their roads and canals, till they see\r\nwhether those necessary improvements will not become the objects of a\r\nnational government. Trading and manufacturing companies suspend their\r\nvoyages and manufactures till they see how far their commerce will be\r\nprotected and promoted by a national system of commercial regulations.\r\nThe lawful usurer locks up or buries his specie till he sees whether the\r\nnew frame of government will deliver him from the curse or fear of paper\r\nmoney and the tender laws.... The public creditor, who, from the\r\nderanged state of finances in every state and their total inability to\r\nsupport their partial funding systems, has reason to fear that his\r\ncertificates will perish in his hands, now places all his hopes of\r\njustice in an enlightened and stable national government. The\r\nembarrassed farmer and the oppressed tenant, who wishes to become\r\nfree ... by emigrating to a frontier country, wait to see whether they\r\nshall be protected by a national force from the Indians.”[77]\r\n\r\nA final answer to the second question propounded above would require an\r\nexhaustive analysis of the “movement for the Constitution,” in the\r\nfollowing form:—\r\n\r\n1. A study of the economic forces in the Revolution and particularly in\r\nthe Continental Congress that drafted the Articles of Confederation.\r\n\r\n2. An inquiry into the first signs of discontent with the prevailing\r\nsystem, their geographic distribution, and their economic sources.\r\n\r\n3. An examination of the several attempts in the Congress under the\r\nArticles of Confederation to secure the power to regulate commerce and\r\nestablish a revenue for discharging the debt.\r\n\r\n4. A description of the economic interests of all the members who were\r\nmost active in these attempts.\r\n\r\n5. A description of the economic forces in the communities whose\r\nrepresentatives in Congress were zealous in securing a revision of the\r\nArticles.\r\n\r\n6. A study of the nature and distribution of the several legislative\r\nattacks on private rights in property between 1783 and 1787.\r\n\r\n7. A minute study of the personnel of the movement for revision and the\r\neconomic interests of the leading spirits in Congress and the state\r\nlegislatures and outside of legislative chambers.\r\n\r\nAny one superficially acquainted with the sources of American history\r\nwill see at once the nature of the work which must be done to secure the\r\nraw materials for such a study. The enormous mass of unprinted papers of\r\nthe Continental Congress in the Library at Washington would have to be\r\nthoroughly searched; proceedings in state legislatures during the years\r\nunder consideration would have to be scrutinized; local archives and\r\nnewspapers would have to be examined.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our historical materials, therefore, all that\r\ncan be attempted here is a superficial commentary on some of the outward\r\naspects of the movement for the Constitution which are described in the\r\nconventional works on the subject. Many of the eminent men prominently\r\nidentified with the events which led up to the Convention of 1787 were\r\nthemselves members of that Assembly, and their economic interests are\r\nconsidered below in Chapter V. But it is not without significance to\r\ndiscover that some of the leading men outside of the Convention who\r\nlabored for an overthrow of the old system were also directly interested\r\nin the results of their labors.\r\n\r\nAs early as January, 1781, General Philip Schuyler moved in the senate\r\nof New York “to request the eastern states to join in an early\r\nconvention, which should form a perpetual league of incorporation,\r\nsubservient, however, to the common interest of all the states; invite\r\nothers to accede to it; erect Vermont into a state; devise a fund for\r\nthe redemption of the common debts; substitute a permanent and uniform\r\nsystem for temporary expedients; and invest the confederacy with powers\r\nof coercion.”[78] General Schuyler was a large holder of depreciated\r\nsecurities.[79]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1781, Congress recommended to the states that they vest in\r\nthe national legislature a power to levy a duty to pay the principal and\r\ninterest of the debt. In April, 1783, Congress again appealed to the\r\nstates for authority to lay duties for the purpose of supplying a\r\nrevenue with which to discharge the debt. Among the leaders in Congress\r\nwho favored this increase in power were Gorham, Higginson, Ellsworth,\r\nDyer, Boudinot, Fitzsimons, Williamson, Izard, Johnson, and King, all of\r\nwhom held securities which were daily depreciating under the failure of\r\nthe government to meet its just obligations.[80]\r\n\r\nIn 1785, Governor Bowdoin, of Massachusetts, in his inaugural address\r\nurged the necessity of a stronger union with larger powers, and\r\nrecommended a convention to deliberate upon the whole matter.[81]\r\nGovernor Bowdoin was a large holder of public securities.[82] The\r\nlegislature of the commonwealth, thereupon, resolved that the Articles\r\nof Confederation were inadequate, and directed the representatives in\r\nCongress to take steps looking toward a strengthening of the union; but\r\nthey failed to act.\r\n\r\nMen less eminent than Bowdoin and Schuyler were being educated in\r\nFederalism by the march of events. In Boston merchants were petitioning\r\nCongress for relief from British discriminations[83]; in the Virginia\r\nlegislature the representatives of the commercial interests were\r\nlearning their lessons[84]; the demands for positive action were\r\nincreasing daily in number. Every failure to find a remedy under the\r\nArticles of Confederation only served to augment the ranks of those who\r\nwere ready for a complete reconstruction of the prevailing system.\r\n\r\nA few illustrations will serve to show how the demand for reform was\r\nbeing fostered and also the connection between the leaders in the\r\nagitation and the personnel of the public bodies which later achieved\r\nthe great work of framing and ratifying the Constitution. Even before\r\nthe war was over and the Articles of Confederation tested in a time of\r\npeace, the inability of the government under it to afford defence to\r\ncommerce on the high seas was deplored by merchants whose vessels were\r\nfalling prey to the British. In April, 1782, a number of prominent\r\nmerchants presented a petition to Congress in which they lamented the\r\nBritish depredations on American trade and the want of adequate naval\r\nprotection at sea.[85] Among the signers of this petition were several\r\nmen who were later known as warm supporters of a strong federal\r\ngovernment. One of them, Thomas Fitzsimons, was a member of the\r\nConvention which drafted the Constitution; another, John Barclay, was a\r\nmember of the Pennsylvania convention and voted in favor of the\r\nratification of the new system of government.\r\n\r\nSix years before the Convention met in Philadelphia, the disordered\r\nfinancial system under the Confederation was the subject of protest by\r\ninterested parties. In 1781, “divers inhabitants of the state of\r\nPennsylvania,” were petitioning Congress to take some action designed to\r\nput the credit of the country on a sound basis.[86] Thus runs the\r\npetition: “Humbly sheweth that whereas you thought fit heretofore in the\r\ncourse of your wisdom to emit bills of credit for good and great\r\npurposes, but the same depreciating to such an amazing degree beyond the\r\nexpectation of all living did therefore lay open wide door for the most\r\nmonstrous and absurd injustices by fraudulent payments which we conclude\r\nis directly contrary to your good and great purposes in emitting the\r\nsame, we therefore, not only firmly relying on the extraordinary\r\nclearness of the circumstances of our agrievances, but likewise on the\r\nuprightness of your understandings, Do therefore presume to pray your\r\nhonors would be pleased to recommend to the several states to adopt such\r\nmeasures as they may think most likely to afford a safe and effectual\r\nredress to all such agrievances....”[86] Among the signers to this\r\npetition are Thomas Bull, John Hannum, and Thomas Cheyney, who six years\r\nlater as members of the Pennsylvania convention had the pleasure of\r\nvoting for the ratification of an instrument of government that put an\r\nend to the evils against which they had so earnestly protested.\r\n\r\nThe failure of repeated attempts in Congress to secure an amendment\r\nauthorizing the laying of impost duties, the refusal of the states to\r\npay the requisitions made by Congress, and the obvious impossibility of\r\ngaining their ends through the ordinary channels of ratification by\r\nstate legislatures, drove the advocates of these measures to\r\ndesperation. Republican government, as it had been tried out, had failed\r\nto secure for personalty that protection and opportunity for advancement\r\nwhich it enjoyed under monarchy. The despair of the representatives of\r\nthe property interests thus jeopardized and their readiness for some\r\nheroic measures were fully manifest in the correspondence of the time.\r\n\r\nWashington, who was not given to undue alarms, wrote to John Jay from\r\nMount Vernon, on August 1, 1786, to the effect that men of leadership\r\nwere ready for drastic action: “What astonishing changes,” he said, “a\r\nfew years are capable of producing. I am told that even respectable\r\ncharacters speak of a monarchical form of Government without horror.\r\nFrom thinking proceeds speaking, thence to acting is often but a single\r\nstep. But how irrevocable and tremendous! What a triumph for our enemies\r\nto verify their predictions—what a triumph for the advocates of\r\ndespotism to find that we are incapable of governing ourselves, & that\r\nsystems founded on the basis of equal liberty are merely ideal &\r\nfallacious! Would to God that wise measures may be taken in time to\r\navert the consequences we have but too much reason to apprehend.”[87]\r\n\r\nLater in that year, General Knox, who was a holder of public securities,\r\nwrote to Washington in the following strain: “The people who are the\r\ninsurgents [Shaysites] have never paid any, or but very little taxes—But\r\nthey see the weakness of government; They feel at once their own\r\npoverty, compared with the opulent, and their own force, and they are\r\ndetermined to make use of the latter, in order to remedy the former.\r\nTheir creed is ‘That the property of the United States has been\r\nprotected from the confiscations of Britain by the joint exertions of\r\nall, and therefore ought to be the common property of all. And he that\r\nattempts opposition to this creed is an enemy to equity and justice, and\r\nought to be swept from off the face of the earth.’ In a word they are\r\ndetermined to annihilate all debts public and private and have agrarian\r\nLaws, which are easily effected by means of unfunded paper money which\r\nshall be a tender in all cases whatever—\r\n\r\n“The numbers of these people may amount in Massachusetts to about one\r\nfifth part of several populous counties, and to them may be collected,\r\npeople of similar sentiments, from the states of Rhode Island,\r\nConnecticut, and New Hampshire so as to constitute a body of 12 or 15000\r\ndesperate & unprincipled men—They are chiefly of the young and active\r\npart of the community, more easily collected than perhaps kept together\r\nafterwards—But they will probably commit overt acts of treason which\r\nwill compel them to embody for their own safety—once embodied they will\r\nbe constrained to submit to discipline for the same reason. Having\r\nproceeded to this length for which they are now ripe, we shall have a\r\nformidable rebellion against reason, the principle of all government,\r\nand the very name of liberty. This dreadful situation has alarmed every\r\nman of principle and property in New England. They start as from a\r\ndream, and ask what has been the cause of our delusion? what is to\r\nafford us security against the violence of lawless men? Our government\r\nmust be braced, changed, or altered to secure our lives and property. We\r\nimagined that the mildness of our government and _the virtue_ of the\r\npeople were so correspondent, that we were not as other nations\r\nrequiring brutal force to support the laws—But we find that we are men,\r\nactual men, possessing all the turbulent passions belonging to that\r\nanim[al] and that we must have a government proper and adequate for him.\r\nThe people of Massachuse[tts] for instance, are far advanced in this\r\ndoctrine, and the men of reflection, & principle, are determined to\r\nendev[or] to establish a government which shall have the power to\r\nprotect them in their lawful pursuits, and which will be efficient in\r\nall cases of internal commotions or foreign invasions—They mean that\r\nliberty shall be the basis, a liberty resulting from the equal and firm\r\nadministration of the laws. They wish for a general government of unity\r\nas they see the local legislatures must naturally and necessarily tend\r\nto retard and frustrate all general government.”[88]\r\n\r\nA few months later, Madison, writing to Edmund Pendleton from New York,\r\nthe seat of the government, corroborated the views expressed by\r\nWashington and Knox and set forth what he conceived to be the desperate\r\nstate of republican government. His letter, dated February 24, 1787,\r\nthree days after Congress had issued the call for a national Convention,\r\nran as follows: “In general I find men of reflection much less sanguine\r\nas to a new than despondent as to the present System. Indeed the Present\r\nSystem neither has nor deserves advocates; and if some very strong props\r\nare not applied will quickly tumble to the ground.... If the approaching\r\nConvention should not agree on some remedy, I am persuaded that some\r\nvery different arrangement will ensue. The late turbulent scenes in\r\nMassachusetts & infamous ones in Rhode Island, have done inexpressible\r\ninjury to the republican character in that part of the U. States; and a\r\npropensity towards Monarchy is said to have been produced by it in some\r\nleading minds. The bulk of the people will probably prefer the lesser\r\nevil of a partition of the Union into three more practicable and\r\nenergetic Governments. The latter idea I find after long confinement to\r\nindividual speculations & private circles, is beginning to show itself\r\nin the Newspapers.”[89]\r\n\r\nA few days after this letter was written by Madison, John Armstrong\r\nwrote to Washington from Carlisle that the suppression of the\r\ninsurrection in Massachusetts had not allayed the fears of leading men\r\nin his state. “The alarming flame in Massachusetts,” he says, “seems\r\nnearly extinguished, but if the subsequent measures of that State\r\nrespecting the insurgents should be severe, amounting to _death_,\r\nConfiscation, or disfranchisement, the consequence may be bad, as\r\ntending to reinkindle the flame. Shall I tell you in _confidence_, I\r\nhave now twice heard, nor from low authority (some principal men of that\r\nState) begin to talk of wishing one general _Head_ to the Union, in the\r\nroom of Congress!”[90]\r\n\r\nBy correspondence such as this just cited, by an increasing recognition\r\nof the desperate straights in which they were placed, a remarkable\r\nfusion of interested forces was effected. The wealth, the influence, and\r\na major portion of the educated men of the country were drawn together\r\nin a compact group, “informed by a conscious solidarity of interests,”\r\nas President Wilson has so tersely put it.[91]\r\n\r\nHaving failed to obtain relief through the regular channels of amendment\r\nby Congress ratified by the state legislatures, the leaders struck out\r\non a new path. Operating through the Virginia legislature, they secured\r\na resolution inviting the sister commonwealths to send delegates to a\r\nconvention at Annapolis to take into consideration the trade and\r\ncommercial system of the United States.[92] The convention duly met, but\r\nthe attendance was so slim that, as Professor Burgess has put it, “a\r\ncoup d’état attempted by so small a body could not but fail.”[93]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Annapolis convention was ostensibly concerned with\r\ncommercial regulation primarily, there is no doubt that it was the\r\ncreation of the men who had been working in Congress and out for a\r\ngeneral revision of the whole system. There is no doubt also that it was\r\nnot regarded as of much significance in itself, but rather as a\r\npreliminary to a national convention which would afford an opportunity\r\nfor reconstructing the government. For this view we have a witness of\r\nhigh authority, James Madison, who in a letter of August 12, 1786, to\r\nJefferson, written a month before the Annapolis conference, said: “Many\r\ngentlemen, both within and without Congress, wish to make this meeting\r\nsubservient to a plenipotentiary Convention for amending the\r\nConfederation. Tho’ my wishes are in favor of such an event, yet I\r\ndespair so much of its accomplishment at the present crisis that I do\r\nnot extend my views beyond a commercial Reform.”[94]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Hamilton, the conference at Annapolis contented\r\nitself with merely recommending that another convention be called “to\r\ndevise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to\r\nrender the constitution of the federal government adequate to the\r\nexigencies of the Union.” Acting on this modest suggestion, Congress, in\r\nFebruary, 1787, invited the states to send delegates to a Convention at\r\nPhiladelphia for “the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles\r\nof Confederation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain tentative conclusions emerge at this point.\r\n\r\nLarge and important groups of economic interests were adversely affected\r\nby the system of government under the Articles of Confederation, namely,\r\nthose of public securities, shipping and manufacturing, money at\r\ninterest; in short, capital as opposed to land.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of these important interests attempted through the\r\nregular legal channels to secure amendments to the Articles of\r\nConfederation which would safeguard their rights in the future,\r\nparticularly those of the public creditors.\r\n\r\nHaving failed to realize their great purposes through the regular means,\r\nthe leaders in the movement set to work to secure by a circuitous route\r\nthe assembling of a Convention to “revise” the Articles of Confederation\r\nwith the hope of obtaining, outside of the existing legal framework, the\r\nadoption of a revolutionary programme.\r\n\r\nOstensibly, however, the formal plan of approval by Congress and the\r\nstate legislatures was to be preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n            PROPERTY SAFEGUARDS IN THE ELECTION OF DELEGATES\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the protection afforded by these outward signs of regularity, the\r\nleaders in the movement for the new Constitution set to work in their\r\nrespective legislatures to secure the choice of delegates prepared to\r\ntake the heroic measures which the circumstances demanded. The zealous\r\nand dynamic element, of course, was favored by the inertness, ignorance,\r\nand indifference of the masses, and the confidence of the legislatures\r\nin their ability to exercise the ultimate control through the ratifying\r\npower. No special popular elections were called to complicate the\r\nproblem of securing the right kind of a Convention and the leaders were\r\nconfronted with the comparatively simple task of convincing the\r\nlegislatures of the advisability of sending delegates. Naturally the\r\nmost strenuous and interested advocates of change came forward as\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the Congress under the Articles of Confederation\r\ncalling for the Convention provided that the delegates should be\r\n“appointed by the states.” The actual selection was made in each case by\r\nthe legislature, both houses participating, except in Georgia and\r\nPennsylvania, which had unicameral assemblies. That is, the delegates to\r\nthe federal Convention were selected in the same fashion as were United\r\nStates Senators under the present Constitution, in all states, previous\r\nto the adoption of the principle of direct election. This fact in itself\r\nremoved the choice of delegates one degree from the electorate.\r\n\r\nA further safeguard against the injection of too much popular feeling\r\ninto the choice of delegates to the Convention was afforded by the\r\nproperty qualifications generally placed on voters and members of the\r\nlegislatures by the state constitutions and laws in force in 1787.[95]\r\nIn order to ascertain the precise character of the defence afforded to\r\nproperty by this barrier to universal manhood suffrage, it is necessary\r\nto inquire in detail into the qualifications then imposed.[96]\r\n\r\nThe New Hampshire constitution of 1784 was in force when the call for\r\nthe election of delegates came. It provided that “no person shall be\r\ncapable of being elected a senator who is not of the Protestant\r\nreligion, and seized of a freehold estate in his own right of the value\r\nof two hundred pounds.”[97] Members of the lower house were required to\r\npossess an estate “of the value of one hundred pounds, one-half of which\r\nto be a freehold.” The suffrage was widely extended, for freeholders,\r\ntax payers, and even those who paid a poll tax could vote.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts conferred the suffrage upon all males possessing a\r\nfreehold estate of the annual income of three pounds, or any estate of\r\nthe value of sixty pounds. A senator was required to be “seized in his\r\nown right of a freehold within this commonwealth, of the value of three\r\nhundred pounds at least, or possessed of a personal estate of the value\r\nof six hundred pounds at least, or of both to the amount of the same\r\nsum.” Every member of the house of representatives was required to be\r\n“seized in his own right of a free hold of the value of one hundred\r\npounds, within the town he shall be chosen to represent, or any ratable\r\nestate to the value of two hundred pounds; and he shall cease to\r\nrepresent the said town immediately on his ceasing to be qualified as\r\naforesaid.”\r\n\r\nLike the neighboring state of Rhode Island, which sent no delegates to\r\nPhiladelphia, Connecticut had continued after the Revolution under the\r\nold royal charter form of government without taking the trouble to draft\r\na constitution. Under this old system, the suffrage was restricted to\r\nholders of real or personal property of a certain value. According to\r\nMcKinley, “The forty-shilling freehold, translated later into seven\r\ndollars income from land, was retained as one of the alternative\r\nqualifications of the suffrage until the amendment in 1845 of the\r\nconstitution of 1818.”[98] The alternative qualification here spoken of\r\nwas the ownership of forty pounds’ worth of personal property, which was\r\nestablished in 1702 and remained until after the Revolution. The\r\nConnecticut Register of the time thus quaintly describes the franchise:\r\n“The qualifications for freemen are that they be at least twenty-one\r\nyears of age, possessed of freehold estate to the value of 40s. per ann.\r\nor £40 personal estate in the general list of estates in that year\r\nwherein they desire to be admitted Freemen; or are possessed of estate\r\nas aforesaid and by law excused from putting it into the list; and being\r\nof quiet and peaceable behaviour.”[99]\r\n\r\nNew York gave a special position to the rights of property in the\r\nsenate. Senators were required to be freeholders, and were chosen by\r\nfreeholders “possessed of freeholds of the value of one hundred pounds.”\r\nWith regard to the voter for members of the lower house, it was\r\nstipulated that “he shall have been a freeholder, possessing a freehold\r\nof the value of twenty pounds within said county, or have rented a\r\ntenement therein of the yearly value of forty shillings, and been rated\r\nand actually paid taxes to this state.” An exception to this rule\r\nconferred the suffrage on all who were freemen in Albany, and in New\r\nYork City, on or before October 14, 1775.\r\n\r\nThese qualifications worked an extensive disfranchisement in New York.\r\n“The census of 1790 shows that out of a population of thirty thousand\r\n[in New York City], there were but 1,209 freeholders of £100 valuation\r\nor over; 1,221 of £20, and 2,661 ‘forty-shilling’ freeholders. Property\r\ninterests—something like a landed aristocracy—controlled municipal\r\nelections.”[100] Some notion of the extent to which the adult males\r\nwould have voted if permitted, is afforded by the elections of 1788, at\r\nwhich members of the state ratifying convention were chosen under the\r\nuniversal manhood suffrage rule,[101] and members of the assembly were\r\nchosen under the regular property qualifications. For example, Richard\r\nHarrison received 2677 votes as member of the convention, and 1500 votes\r\nas member of the state assembly.[102] In Albany county the vote for\r\nmembers of the assembly ran about 1600 under that for members of the\r\nconvention.[103] It looks as if one could safely guess that about\r\none-third more voters would have been active participants in elections\r\nif they had not been shut out by the prevailing property qualifications\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey had a legislature of two houses, a council and a general\r\nassembly. Every member of the former had to be a freeholder and “worth\r\nat least one thousand pound proclamation money, or real and personal\r\nestate within the same county;” and every member of the latter body was\r\nrequired to possess at least half as much in real and personal property.\r\nAs for the suffrage, the constitution provided “that all inhabitants of\r\nthis colony, of full age, who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money\r\nclear estate in the same ... shall be entitled to vote for\r\nRepresentatives in Council and Assembly.”\r\n\r\nThe Delaware constitution of 1776 provided that members of both branches\r\nof the legislature should be chosen from among the freeholders of the\r\ncounty, and that “the right of suffrage in the election of members for\r\nboth houses shall remain as exercised by law at present.” The election\r\nlaw which then governed the suffrage in Delaware was the act of 1734\r\nwhich enfranchised freeholders owning “fifty acres of land, with twelve\r\nacres cleared and improved, or otherwise worth £40 lawful money.”[104]\r\n\r\nThe first constitution of Pennsylvania established in 1776 was the work\r\nof a radical party, and it provided for a single chambered legislature\r\nbased on a widely extended suffrage. “Every freeman of the full age of\r\ntwenty-one years,” runs the instrument, “having resided in this state\r\nfor the space of one whole year ... and paid public taxes during that\r\ntime, shall enjoy the right of an elector: _Provided_ always that sons\r\nof freeholders of the age of twenty-one years shall be entitled to vote\r\nalthough they have not paid taxes.”[105]\r\n\r\nIn Maryland a distinction was made between town and county in the choice\r\nof delegates to the lower house of the state legislature. Generally\r\nevery freeman “having a freehold of fifty acres of land,” or “having\r\nproperty in this state above the value of thirty pounds current money”\r\ncould vote in the county in which he resided for members of the house of\r\ndelegates. All persons qualified by the charter of Annapolis to vote for\r\nburgesses could vote for delegates from that city; and in Baltimore\r\npersons “having the same qualifications as electors in the county” could\r\nvote for delegates. County delegates in the state legislature were\r\nrequired to possess “real or personal property above the value of five\r\nhundred pounds current money.” The senators were chosen indirectly by\r\nelectors selected by the qualified voters for delegates. These\r\nsenatorial electors were to possess the qualifications of delegates, and\r\nsenators themselves had to possess “real and personal property above the\r\nvalue of one thousand pounds current money.”\r\n\r\nThe Virginia constitution of 1776 stipulated that members of both houses\r\nof the legislature must be “freeholders or duly qualified according to\r\nlaw;” and added that “the right of suffrage in the election of members\r\nof both houses shall remain as exercised at present.” Under this\r\nprovision, persons owning twenty-five acres of improved land or fifty\r\nacres of unimproved land were admitted to the suffrage, “together with\r\ncertain artisans residing in Norfolk and Williamsburg.”[106]\r\n\r\nAt the time of choosing delegates to the Convention, North Carolina was\r\nunder the constitution of 1776 which prescribed property qualifications\r\nfor members of the legislature and for voters as well. Each member of\r\nthe senate was required to possess “not less than three hundred acres of\r\nland in fee,” and each member of the lower house “not less than one\r\nhundred acres of land in fee or for the term of his own life.” A\r\nfreehold qualification of fifty acres of land was required of voters for\r\nsenators, and the suffrage for voters for members of the lower house was\r\nextended to all freemen who paid “public taxes.” In the towns entitled\r\nto representation the possession of a freehold or the payment of a\r\npublic tax qualified for voting in the election of members of the lower\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of South Carolina, that chose the representatives of\r\nthat state to the Philadelphia Convention, was elected under the\r\nconstitution of 1778 which prescribed high property qualifications.[107]\r\n“No person who resides in the parish for which he is elected shall take\r\nhis seat in the senate, unless he possess a settled estate and freehold\r\nin his own right in the said parish or district of the value of two\r\nthousand pounds currency at least, clear of debt.” Non-resident senators\r\nwere required to be the holders of such an estate worth at least seven\r\nthousand pounds, clear of debt. The member of the lower house was\r\nrequired to possess an estate and slaves or realty worth one thousand\r\npounds,[108] while each non-resident member of that house had to own a\r\nfreehold estate worth at least three thousand five hundred pounds, clear\r\nof debt. The suffrage was restricted to persons owning fifty acres, or a\r\ntown lot, or paying taxes equivalent to the taxes on fifty acres of\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, the Georgia legislature consisted of one chamber, under the\r\nconstitution of 1777, which stipulated that members of the house of\r\nrepresentatives “Shall be of the Protestant religion, and of the age of\r\ntwenty-one years, and shall be possessed in their own rights of two\r\nhundred and fifty acres of land or some property to the amount of two\r\nhundred and fifty pounds.” The suffrage was widely extended to every\r\nwhite male having in his own right property “of ten pounds value and\r\nliable to pay tax” or “being of any mechanic trade.”\r\n\r\nFrom this review it is apparent that a majority of the states placed\r\ndirect property qualifications on the voters, and the other states\r\neliminated practically all who were not taxpayers. Special safeguards\r\nfor property were secured in the qualifications imposed on members of\r\nthe legislatures in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey,\r\nMaryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Further\r\nsafeguards were added by the qualifications imposed in the case of\r\nsenators in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York,\r\nMaryland, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\r\n\r\nWhile these qualifications operated to exclude a large portion of the\r\nadult males from participating in elections, the wide distribution of\r\nreal property created an extensive electorate and in most rural regions\r\ngave the legislatures a broad popular basis.[109] Far from rendering to\r\npersonal property that defence which was necessary to the full\r\nrealization of its rights, these qualifications for electors admitted to\r\nthe suffrage its most dangerous antagonists: the small farmers and many\r\nof the debtors who were the most active in all attempts to depreciate\r\npersonalty by legislation. Madison with his usual acumen saw the\r\ninadequacy of such defence and pointed out in the Convention that the\r\nreally serious assaults on property (having in mind of course,\r\npersonalty) had come from the “freeholders.”[110]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the election of delegates to the Convention, the\r\nrepresentatives of personalty in the legislatures were able by the sheer\r\nweight of their combined intelligence and economic power to secure\r\ndelegates from the urban centres or allied with their interests. Happily\r\nfor them, all the legislatures which they had to convince had not been\r\nelected on the issue of choosing delegates to a national Convention, and\r\ndid not come from a populace stirred up on that question.[111] The call\r\nfor the Convention went forth on February 21, 1787, from Congress, and\r\nwithin a few months all the legislatures, except that of Rhode Island,\r\nhad responded. Thus the heated popular discussion usually incident to\r\nsuch a momentous political undertaking was largely avoided, and an\r\norderly and temperate procedure in the selection of delegates was\r\nrendered possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n        THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CONVENTION\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving shown that four groups of property rights were adversely affected\r\nby the government under the Articles of Confederation, and that economic\r\nmotives were behind the movement for a reconstruction of the system, it\r\nis now necessary to inquire whether the members of the Convention which\r\ndrafted the Constitution represented in their own property affiliations\r\nany or all of these groups. In other words, did the men who formulated\r\nthe fundamental law of the land possess the kinds of property which were\r\nimmediately and directly increased in value or made more secure by the\r\nresults of their labors at Philadelphia? Did they have money at\r\ninterest? Did they own public securities? Did they hold western lands\r\nfor appreciation? Were they interested in shipping and manufactures?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of such an inquiry is not, of course, to show that the\r\nConstitution was made for the personal benefit of the members of the\r\nConvention. Far from it. Neither is it of any moment to discover how\r\nmany hundred thousand dollars accrued to them as a result of the\r\nfoundation of the new government. The only point here considered is: Did\r\nthey represent distinct groups whose economic interests they understood\r\nand felt in concrete, definite form through their own personal\r\nexperience with identical property rights, or were they working merely\r\nunder the guidance of abstract principles of political science?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the materials for such a study are very scanty, because\r\nthe average biographer usually considers as negligible the processes by\r\nwhich his hero gained his livelihood. The pages which follow are,\r\ntherefore, more an evidence of what ought to be done than a record of\r\nresults actually accomplished. They would be meagre, indeed, were it not\r\nfor the rich unpublished records of the Treasury Department which are\r\nhere used for the first time in this connection; and they would\r\ndoubtless have been fuller were it not for the fact that most of the\r\nbooks showing the central operations of the Treasury Department under\r\nHamilton have disappeared. The names of the attending members of the\r\nConvention are given in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nOf _Abraham Baldwin’s_ private fortune there is little known. His father\r\nwas evidently well-to-do, for he enjoyed the advantage of a classical\r\neducation at Yale before he established himself in the practice of law\r\nat Savannah, Georgia. He soon rose to eminence in his profession, and\r\nwas reckoned among the ablest and shrewdest lawyers of his adopted\r\ncommonwealth. A short sketch of him states that by “his constant habits\r\nof economy and temperance,” he accumulated enough to enable him to\r\nassist many young men in their education and establishment in business.\r\nWhen his father died, in 1787, he was able to pay the debts of the\r\ninsolvent estate, and he educated his six half brothers and sisters “in\r\na great measure at his own expense.”[112]\r\n\r\nSome portion of Baldwin’s fortune was invested in public securities. He\r\npossessed a few thousand dollars worth of the stocks of the new\r\ngovernment at its very inception, which doubtless represented old paper\r\nof the Confederation acquired by original subscription or by purchase.\r\nThe ledgers and other principal records of Georgia are apparently\r\nunavailable—at all events a search at the Treasury Department failed to\r\nreveal them; but Baldwin held some paper which is entered on the books\r\nof his native state, Connecticut, in April, 1792: deferred 6 per cents,\r\nfunded 6 per cents, and 3 per cents to the amount of about $2500.[113]\r\n\r\nAt later dates, 1797 and 1804, he appears on the Treasury Records for\r\nseveral thousand dollars worth of 6 per cents and 3 per cents, but the\r\nsources of these sums are not apparent.[114] It is probable, however,\r\nthat these stocks were paper which Baldwin funded at the Treasury\r\ninstead of a loan office. He was a member of Congress, and naturally\r\nwould have transacted business with the agency nearest at hand. They\r\nmay, of course, represent purchases for investment, made after the great\r\nappreciation had taken place.[115]\r\n\r\nThere is no exhaustive biography of _Richard Bassett_, of Delaware. A\r\nbrief sketch of him relates that he “was born in 1745. He was the\r\nadopted son of Mr. Lawson, a lawyer, who married a Miss Inzer. The Inzer\r\nfamily was Herman’s heir to Bohemia Manor.... Mr. Bassett was educated\r\nand trained for the profession of law by Mr. Lawson, whose heir he\r\nbecame. By this inheritance he came into possession of six thousand\r\nacres of Bohemia manor, which we are informed, embraced the fairest and\r\nbest portion of the Manor.”[116] Through his inheritance and his\r\naccumulations in the practice of law, he became one of the wealthy men\r\nof his state. Another biographer notes that “His fortune was large and\r\nhe entertained lavishly at his three homes in Wilmington, Dover, and at\r\nBohemia Manor.”[117] He was on intimate terms with the leading financial\r\nmen of the community; he was very active in securing a charter in\r\nDelaware for the Bank of North America when it was attacked by the\r\nPennsylvania legislature, and was warmly thanked for his success by\r\nPresident Willing, in a letter dated February 6, 1786.[118]\r\n\r\nWhether any considerable amount of Mr. Bassett’s large fortune was\r\ninvested in public securities at the inception of the new government it\r\nis impossible to ascertain, on account of the meagre records of the\r\nstate of Delaware preserved in the Treasury Department. In the later\r\ndocuments of the central office of the Treasury there appears the\r\nremnant of “an old account” to the amount of a few hundred dollars worth\r\nof 3 per cents and 6 per cents under dates of 1796 and 1797.[119] A\r\nreasonable inference from the entry would be that Bassett, like other\r\nmembers of Congress, carried on his transactions directly with the\r\nTreasury (whose early records are missing), and that these holdings were\r\nbased on paper originally funded.\r\n\r\n_Gunning Bedford_, of Delaware, was the son of a “substantial land\r\nowner”[120] and a Bedford of that name appears on the tax lists of\r\nNewcastle county for the year 1776 for the amount of sixteen pounds, a\r\nmoderate sum for those days.[121] He was a lawyer, but the extent of his\r\npractice is not known. He was of high standing in the community, and was\r\nelected governor of his state a few years after the Convention met. He\r\ntook an interest in the financial affairs of the state, and under his\r\nadministration as governor the Bank of Delaware was organized. How far\r\nBedford had an interest in public securities cannot be determined on\r\naccount of the fact that only a few scraps of the loan office papers for\r\nDelaware seem to be preserved in the Treasury Department. An old loan\r\noffice volume shows a Gunning Bedford down for one $400 certificate of\r\nMay, 1779[122] and traces of the financial connections of the member of\r\nthe Convention with the government are to be found in the Pennsylvania\r\nloan office records.[123]\r\n\r\n_John Blair_, of Virginia, was born in that state about 1731. He\r\nreceived a collegiate education, prepared for the law, and “in a very\r\nfew years rose to the head of his profession.”[124] Pierce, in his notes\r\non the men of the Convention, says: “Mr. Blair is one of the most\r\nrespectable men in Virginia, both on account of his Family as well as\r\nfortune. He is one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and\r\nacknowledged to have a very extensive knowledge of the Laws. Mr. Blair\r\nis however no orator, but his good sense and most excellent principles\r\ncompensate for other deficiencies.”[125]\r\n\r\nBlair took advantage of the excellent opportunity afforded by the\r\nformation of the new Constitution to profit by the rise of securities.\r\nHe appears frequently in the fiscal transactions between the federal\r\ngovernment and the Virginia loan office, of which a few illustrations\r\nneed be given here. In March, 1791, he presented £577:16:7 in Virginia\r\ncertificates toward the United States loan; and of these securities £249\r\nhad been invested by Blair himself in 1782. The remaining amount he had\r\npurchased on his own account.[126] In the same year an agent of Blair\r\npresented two small certificates which had evidently been purchased by\r\nthe principal because they were issued to other parties in 1778.[127] In\r\nSeptember of that year, Blair himself turned in nearly $10,000 worth of\r\npaper on the United States loan, of which a part was purchased and a\r\npart original issues to the holder.[128]\r\n\r\n_William Blount_, of North Carolina, was the son of Jacob Blount who\r\ndied in 1789, “leaving a large estate.”[129] Of the younger Blount’s\r\nproperty interests in 1787 it is impossible to speak in detail. Very\r\nearly after the establishment of the new government he was connected\r\nwith land speculations on a large scale.[130] In 1790 he was appointed\r\nby Washington to the post of governor of the Territory South of the Ohio\r\nand it seems that he did not consider the employment of public office\r\nfor personal gain as incompatible with the discharge of his\r\nadministrative duties. In July, 1797, President Adams sent a message to\r\nCongress asserting that there was a conspiracy in the southwest to wrest\r\nNew Orleans and the Floridas from the King of Spain and transfer them to\r\nthe English crown, and adding that Blount, who was then a Senator from\r\nTennessee, was implicated in the plot. The United States Senate\r\nimmediately took action, and after inquiry expelled him by a vote of\r\ntwenty-five to one on the charge of “high misdemeanor inconsistent with\r\npublic trust and duty.” When the sergeant-at-arms went to arrest him and\r\ntake him to Philadelphia for trial he refused to go; and in his refusal\r\nhe was warmly supported by his friends, of whom he had a legion, for, as\r\nhis biographer remarks, “He was a man of commanding presence, courtly\r\nyet simple manners, and having a large salary and large private means,\r\nhe entertained lavishly at his house.”[131]\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Blount combined dealings in securities with\r\nspeculations in land, for the loan office of North Carolina credits him\r\nwith only a small holding, and the origin of that is not apparent.[132]\r\nIt is true that the records of that state are incomplete, but Blount’s\r\nappointment to the western post at the beginning of Washington’s\r\nadministration must have precluded extensive operations in securities.\r\n\r\n_David Brearley_, of New Jersey, was the grandson of John Brearley, who\r\n“owned 1600 acres of land near Newton, N. J. ... a hundred acre\r\nplantation on the Delaware ... besides several thousand acres of land\r\nnear Lawrenceville.”[133] A brief sketch of him states that he “received\r\nthe honors of Princeton at the age of eighteen. On leaving that\r\ncelebrated seminary, he commenced the study of law, and in a few years\r\nstood foremost at the bar of his native state.”[134] In 1779 he was\r\nappointed chief justice of New Jersey, a post which he held until 1789\r\nwhen he resigned to accept a position as judge of the United States\r\ndistrict court of that state.[135]\r\n\r\nBrearley died in the summer of 1790 and consequently could not have\r\nestablished any fiscal relations with the new government. The\r\nincompleteness of the early loan office records for New Jersey,\r\npreserved in the Treasury Department, renders impossible a positive\r\nstatement concerning Brearley’s holdings of securities at the time of\r\nthe Convention. Only one small entry appears in his name for a few\r\nhundred dollars in a certificate purchased in 1779;[136] his relatives,\r\nhowever, appear frequently on the loan office books of his state; but\r\ntheir aggregate holdings were small. Joseph Brearley’s name occurs\r\nseveral times, for example in July, 1791, for $505.80 worth of 3 per\r\ncents;[137] David Brearley had a son and a brother bearing that\r\nname.[138] Elizabeth Brearley is also among the small holders, and the\r\nChief Justice’s first and second wife and a daughter bore that\r\nname.[139] The name of Zerujah Brearley—a sister of the member of the\r\nConvention[140]—also appears.\r\n\r\n_Jacob Broom_, of Delaware, was born at Wilmington, in 1752. His father\r\n“originally a blacksmith was regarded as one of ‘the gentry’ of the day,\r\nand was ‘a man of considerable substance, in real estate, silver, and\r\ngold,’ although not one of the very wealthiest of his class. ‘Class’\r\ndistinctions, arising from birth, education, and worldly possessions\r\nwere not wholly ignored at that time by those who came to this land, to\r\nfind a home, a sanctuary, and liberty. And so in the transactions of the\r\nperiod we find James Broom, Jacob’s father, referred to as James Broom,\r\nGentleman; and Jacob Broom as Surveyor. And both of these men had lands\r\nand houses to rent and sell and gold and silver to loan on good\r\nsecurity. And both of them sold and rented and loaned.”[141]\r\n\r\nBroom was a man of diversified financial resources. He was interested in\r\ncotton mills and other enterprises. He was one of the original\r\nstockholders of the Insurance Company of North America organized at\r\nPhiladelphia in 1792.[142] He was also one of the organizers and\r\noriginal stockholders of the Delaware Bank established under Bedford’s\r\nadministration.[143] As mentioned above, the fragmentary records of\r\nDelaware in the Treasury Department throw little light on the public\r\nsecurity holders of that state at the time of the formation of the\r\nConstitution; but the ledgers of the central Treasury show that Broom\r\nwas a holder of a small amount of 3 per cents in 1797 and that this was\r\na remnant of an older account.[144] Broom was also willing to serve the\r\nnew government in an official capacity, for he applied to Madison in\r\nApril, 1789, for an appointment as collector at Wilmington.[145]\r\n\r\n_Pierce Butler_, of South Carolina, was a descendant of the Duke of\r\nOrmond and was very vain of his noble birth.[146] William Pierce in his\r\nnotes on the members of the Convention records that Butler “is a\r\ngentleman of fortune and takes rank among the first in South\r\nCarolina.”[147] He was a large slave-holder, having thirty-one in his\r\npossession at the time of the first census. He also possessed some\r\npublic securities, for he was a stockholder and director of the first\r\nUnited States Bank, and must have purchased his shares on the same basis\r\nas other stockholders, that is, by the exchange of securities. He does\r\nnot appear on the records of South Carolina, however, but his daughter,\r\nSarah, had in 1792 a small amount of the assumed debt.[148]\r\n\r\n_Daniel Carroll_, of Maryland, is recorded by his contemporary, Pierce,\r\nas “a man of large fortune and influence in his state.”[149] His\r\ninterests were wide and varied. He was a stockholder in the Potomac\r\nCompany;[150] and he favored the adoption of a protective tariff, for he\r\nwas among the signers of the petition for such a measure laid before the\r\nfirst Congress under the new Constitution.[151] He was a holder of\r\npublic securities, for his name occurs frequently in the Treasury\r\nrecords of the period.[152] His chief source of profit out of the new\r\nsystem was however in the location of the capitol at Washington, on land\r\nwhich he owned.[153] Incidentally, he was able to facilitate this last\r\ntransaction, for he was a member of the Congress of 1789–1791 and was\r\none of the commissioners appointed to lay out the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n_George Clymer_, of Pennsylvania, was the son of “a wellto-do merchant\r\nand ship builder of Philadelphia” who had augmented his fortunes by\r\nmarrying the daughter of a fellow merchant of the same city.[154] On the\r\nearly death of his parents he was placed under the guardianship of\r\nWilliam Coleman, one of the first business men of his native city, whose\r\ncounting house he entered to learn all the arts of mercantile pursuits\r\nand “the principal part of whose fortune he inherited.”[155] Clymer’s\r\npersonal fortune was further enhanced by a happy marriage to Elizabeth\r\nMeredith, the daughter of Reese Meredith, “one of the principal\r\nmerchants of Philadelphia.”[156] He was thus a brother-in-law of Mr.\r\nMeredith the first treasurer of the Union, also a man of “large\r\nfortune.”[157] For some time Clymer was associated in business with his\r\nfather- and brother-in-law.[158]\r\n\r\nMr. Clymer’s intimate associations were therefore merchantile and\r\nfinancial, and his large fortune and quick understanding of the needs of\r\ntrade and commerce made him one of the first men of his city in the\r\nRevolution and gave him a wide influence during the critical period, the\r\nformation of the Constitution, and the establishment of the new\r\ngovernment, which he served as a member of Congress and later in several\r\nofficial capacities.\r\n\r\nIn all financial matters he took a deep interest. He helped to create\r\nthe temporary Bank of Pennsylvania in 1780, and subscribed £5000 to its\r\ncapital stock. When the Bank of North America was organized he became\r\none of the directors and later was president of the Philadelphia\r\nBank.[159]\r\n\r\nClymer turned his extensive financial experience to some account in\r\nhandling the securities of the new government which he had been\r\ninstrumental in framing, for he is recorded in the Pennsylvania books as\r\nholding, in August, 1791, over $3000 worth of 3 per cent\r\nsecurities.[160] If he held sixes deferred and funded, as may be\r\nassumed, although the incomplete records apparently do not permit of a\r\nverification or denial of this, he had in all over $10,000 worth of the\r\ngovernment paper.\r\n\r\n_Wm. R. Davie_, of North Carolina, was born in England in 1756 and was\r\nbrought to America in 1763 by his father, who left him in care of his\r\nmaternal uncle, William Richardson, a Presbyterian clergyman, who took\r\ncharge of his education and on his death bequeathed to him his\r\nestate.[161] Davie chose the profession of law, and by a lucrative\r\npractice “he quickly accumulated a large estate.”[162] He was of counsel\r\nin the famous case of Bayard _v._ Singleton, and he had the satisfaction\r\nof securing from the court an opinion declaring an act of the state\r\nlegislature unconstitutional.[163] He held a fine plantation at Tivoli\r\nand at his death left a considerable estate which was the subject of\r\nlitigation as late as 1892 in the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nHis personal property certainly was not small for he was able to pay\r\n$5000 for a thorough-bred colt.[164] His connections with the landed\r\nproprietors of his region were intimate and extensive and he is reported\r\nto have drawn all the wills made during his time in that part of the\r\nstate.[165]\r\n\r\n_Jonathan Dayton_, of New Jersey, was associated with, and agent for,\r\nJohn Cleves Symmes, in the purchase of an enormous tract of land in Ohio\r\nin July and October, 1787, the year of the Convention (formally\r\nconsummated in 1788), and before the ensealing of the contract Symmes\r\nand his associates had paid into the Treasury $82,198 “one seventh in\r\nmilitary rights and the residue in the public securities of the United\r\nStates.” The remainder was to be paid in gold or silver or the\r\nsecurities of the United States, and part (one seventh) in military\r\nrights. In 1792 Symmes and Dayton complained that on account of the\r\n“advanced price of certificates,” they must have easier terms. It is\r\napparent from this record,[166] that they were engaged in buying up\r\nmilitary certificates and government securities about the time of the\r\nmeeting of the Convention.\r\n\r\nAfterward, by collusion with Ludlow, the official surveyor, and the\r\ninadvertence of Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury, Symmes, Dayton, and\r\nassociates secured “the advantage of paying almost two-sevenths of their\r\ncontract and above one-half of their actual payments in military\r\nwarrants of one acre for an acre and a half of the supposed million,\r\ninstead of one-seventh part of the actual payments” at a loss to the\r\nUnited States of more than $30,000.[167] In March and April, 1800,\r\nDayton purchased about 15,000 acres of public lands with military\r\ncertificates.[168]\r\n\r\nIf further evidence were needed that Dayton was speculating vigorously\r\nin government securities and military certificates, it is to be found in\r\na suit brought by him and his partner, Lawrence, against Childs, a\r\nmember of their concern in 1800, which was carried before Chancellor\r\nLivingston and later withdrawn. In this case Childs exhibited sixteen\r\nletters from Dayton, showing that while the latter was Speaker of the\r\nHouse of Representatives he had been engaged in speculations in public\r\nland warrants. Dayton was not unaware of the improper character of such\r\ntransactions, for in a letter of April 17, 1796, he wrote to Childs:\r\n“The contents of this letter are of such a nature as to render it\r\nimproper to be seen by any except yourself; burn it therefore, when you\r\nhave perused it.”[169]\r\n\r\nThe conclusive evidence of Dayton’s extensive operations in public\r\nsecurities during the period of the establishment of the new government\r\nand his term of service as Speaker is afforded by the records of the\r\nTreasury Department. Here he appears so frequently on the books of the\r\nloan offices of several states that some pages of this volume would be\r\nrequired to present the bare data of his transactions. However, a few\r\nexamples of his dealings may be given by way of illustration. He appears\r\non the loan office books of New York in February and March, 1791, for\r\nthe following amounts: $17,060.82, $8530.40, $11,332.93, $7401.31,\r\n$3700.73, and $5100.61, totalling more than $50,000.[170] At another\r\npoint he is recorded for more than $15,000;[171] and at another point\r\nfor $6000.[172] Although Woods is not celebrated for the painstaking\r\nimpartiality of his famous _History of Adams’ Administration_, he is\r\nsingularly accurate in one of his characterizations: “Jonathan Dayton,\r\nof New Jersey, the late speaker of Congress, is notorious from Boston to\r\nGeorgia. The deeds of other members of Congress were scarcely known\r\nbeyond the circle of their respective states, but the speculations of\r\nthis man have rung throughout the western world.”[173]\r\n\r\n_John Dickinson_, of Delaware, was a member of one of the established\r\nlanded families of the south. He was born in 1732, on a plantation in\r\nTalbot County, on the eastern shores of Maryland; and eight years after\r\nhis birth, his father, Samuel Dickinson moved from Maryland to Delaware\r\n“where he purchased a large estate in Kent County, near Dover.”[174]\r\nDickinson was a student of law in the Middle Temple and took up the\r\npractice of his profession in Philadelphia in 1757.[175] Within five\r\nyears he had acquired an extensive practice and won a respectable\r\nstanding at the bar.\r\n\r\nIf his personal fortunes, however, had not been sufficient to assure him\r\na satisfactory position in the business and professional world at\r\nPhiladelphia, his marriage into one of the first and wealthiest\r\ncommercial families would have more than made up for his deficiencies.\r\n\r\nIn 1770 he married Mary Norris, and for a time lived at the family\r\nestate, Fairhill, one of the show places of the day: “This house,” says\r\nSimpson,[176] “was in its day a very grand mansion and a place of great\r\ncelebrity, with a large front of sixty feet. It was surrounded by forest\r\nand evergreen trees of majestic growth and well-arranged shrubbery. It\r\ncommanded a beautiful prospect of the city, with a distant view of the\r\nDelaware.... The mansion was two stories high and most substantially\r\nbuilt, with a very wide hall running through its centre. The library was\r\npapered, but the parlors and hall were wainscotted with oak and red\r\ncedar unpainted, but polished with wax and kept in bright and handsome\r\norder by constant rubbing. The carriage way was finely graduated and\r\nwound through an extensive lawn, from its approach on the Germantown\r\nroad which was bordered with shrubbery. The pleasure grounds, lawn,\r\ngreen house, and gardens, fish-ponds, and walks, embraced a large area\r\nof several acres in extent.” It is true the vast estates bequeathed to\r\nMiss Norris by her father were transferred to collateral male heirs in\r\norder to preserve the family holding and name, but she retained the\r\n“considerable personal property” which her father left to her.[177]\r\nDickinson was able to make a large gift to Dickinson College, named in\r\nhis honor; and he and his wife were widely celebrated for their\r\nextensive benefactions.[178]\r\n\r\nThe meagreness of the Treasury records for Delaware make it impossible\r\nto determine whether Dickinson was engaged in fiscal operations along\r\nwith his intimate friends, Robert Morris, Thomas Willing, George Clymer,\r\nand other prominent Philadelphia men of affairs. It is possible that he\r\nwas not largely engaged in the public security transactions,[179] for he\r\nwas an extremely cautious man in finances, and had got into serious\r\ndiscredit with the patriot party during the Revolution, because it was\r\nrumored that he had advised his brother against accepting the payment of\r\ndebts in paper which was sure to depreciate. He was also unhappily\r\ninvolved with Robert Morris to the amount of £7000 at the time of the\r\nlatter’s embarrassment, and may not have wished to incur further\r\nrisks.[180]\r\n\r\n_Oliver Ellsworth_, of Connecticut, was the son of a clever Connecticut\r\nfarmer who inherited a hundred pounds and “had the industry and the\r\nshrewdness to accumulate a considerable estate and to win the reputation\r\nof an excellent farmer.”[181] Oliver was educated at Yale and Princeton\r\nand became a lawyer in spite of his father’s determination to force him\r\ninto the ministry. Though he was almost briefless during the early days\r\nof his practice, he had the good fortune to wed the daughter of William\r\nWolcott, of East Windsor, “a gentleman of substance and\r\ndistinction.”[182] He is described by his biographer as a man of great\r\npurpose, persistency, and of little imagination, and he rose rapidly to\r\nwealth and power at the bar of his native state. “It is doubtful,” says\r\nBrown, “if in the entire history of the Connecticut bar any other lawyer\r\nhas ever in so short a time accumulated so great a practice.... Measured\r\neither by the amount of his business or by his earnings, it was\r\nunrivalled in his own day and unexampled in the history of the colony.\r\nNaturally shrewd, and with nothing of the spendthrift in his nature, he\r\nquickly earned a competence, and by good management he increased it to a\r\nfortune which for the times and the country was quite uncommonly large.\r\nFrom a few documents still in existence it is clear that he became\r\nsomething of a capitalist and investor. He bought lands and houses and\r\nloaned out money at interest. He was a stockholder in the Hartford Bank\r\nand one of the original subscribers to the stock of the old Hartford\r\nBroadcloth Mill (1788).”\r\n\r\nWith that natural shrewdness and economy which his latest biographer\r\nascribed to him, Ellsworth accumulated a by no means negligible amount\r\nin public securities from which he profited by the rise of credit that\r\naccompanied the establishment of the new government. He was among the\r\nfirst citizens of Connecticut to have his paper funded into the new\r\ngovernment securities, for he appears in December, 1791, with $1330.50\r\nin deferred sixes, $2660.98 in funded sixes, and $1995.75 in 3 per\r\ncents.[183] His wife, Abigail, and other members of her family, the\r\nWolcotts, had also invested in securities.[184]\r\n\r\n_William Few_, of Georgia, was almost unique among the members of the\r\nConvention in being a representative, in origin and education, of the\r\nsmall farming class. His father was a Maryland farmer who was led by a\r\nsuccessive failure of crops to try his fortune in North Carolina, where\r\nyoung Few labored with the ax and plow. Even here the elder Few did not\r\nprosper, and he became so deeply involved in debt that his son had to\r\ntake over the management of his property. William, afterward, in 1776,\r\nsettled in Georgia, and soon became engaged in politics and the\r\nRevolutionary War.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the War, he relates, “I possessed not much property nor\r\nhad I any expectation that I did not acquire by my own industry. I\r\ntherefore determined to commence the practice of law, although I had\r\nnever spent one hour in the office of an attorney to prepare for\r\nbusiness, nor did I know anything of the practice.” He adds, however,\r\nthat his practice grew in spite of his deficiencies and that his\r\n“pecuniary prospects were very flattering,” by the time he was elected a\r\nmember of the Convention. At all events he acquired a plantation in\r\nColumbia County, and after the expiration of his term as Senator in\r\n1793, he retired there and engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1799 he\r\nleft Georgia for New York, where he managed his small fortune in real\r\nand personal property, according to his own estimate, about\r\n$100,000.[185]\r\n\r\nFew’s personal interest in the new government was probably rather small,\r\nbut the absence of the full records of Georgia from the books of the\r\nTreasury Department renders impossible a categorical statement. He was\r\nconnected with the Georgia Union Company, which was involved in the\r\nYazoo land deals;[186] and he presented for funding a certificate of the\r\nissue of 1779 to the amount of $2170 nominal value, which he had secured\r\nfrom one Spears.[187] His name appears occasionally on other records for\r\nsmall amounts, and the index in the office of the Register of the\r\nTreasury cites him as being among the security holders recorded in a\r\nvolume not found.[188]\r\n\r\n_Thomas Fitzsimons_, of Pennsylvania, was intimately identified with the\r\nmercantile interests of his city. He is described as “an extensive\r\nmerchant,” and his family connections were with people engaged in his\r\nown line. He married the daughter of Robert Meade, and established\r\nbusiness relations with his brother-in-law “who was one of the prominent\r\nmerchants and shipowners of Philadelphia.”[189] It is recorded of him\r\nthat “His influence in the country and especially among merchants was\r\nsecond to none.... Mr. Fitzsimons was one of those efficient and able\r\nmen who laid the foundations of the commercial and financial systems of\r\nthe United States.”[190] It is not surprising to find that he was also a\r\n“conspicuous advocate of a protective tariff.”[191]\r\n\r\nLike his prominent associates in Philadelphia, Mr. Fitzsimons combined\r\nmercantile and financial operations. He was “for a long time a director\r\nin the Bank of North America and President of the Insurance Company of\r\nNorth America, in which latter office he continued until his\r\ndeath.”[192] Indeed he was so extensively involved in the speculations\r\nof Robert Morris that his resources were seriously crippled by the\r\nfailure of that gentleman.[193]\r\n\r\nHis intimate knowledge of finance and his immediate business connections\r\ndoubtless invited him to deal in public securities; and Maclay sets him\r\ndown among the speculators as follows: “The Speaker gives me this day\r\nhis opinion that Mr. Fitzsimons was concerned in this business [of\r\nspeculating] as well as Mr. Morris, and that they stayed away (from\r\nCongress) for the double purpose of pursuing their speculation and\r\nremaining unsuspected.”[194] It is probable that Maclay’s version is\r\ncorrect, for in 1791 Fitzsimon’s agent, Michael Conner, presented for\r\nhim certificates of 1778 to the amount of nearly $12,000 nominal value\r\nwhich he had evidently bought up.[195] He appears also on the records of\r\nthe 6 per cents and the threes for small amounts, and his operations\r\nextended beyond his native state.[196]\r\n\r\nFitzsimons was also involved extensively in land speculations with\r\nRobert Morris, for the latter in a letter of October 9, 1795, writes to\r\nJames Marshall, their European agent, to the effect that Fitzsimons and\r\nhe had put on sale in London “about 360,000 acres of land situated in\r\nGeorgia.”[197] But as pointed out above Fitzsimons’ relations with\r\nMorris cost him dearly and snatched away from him all that he had made\r\nin public securities and more besides.\r\n\r\n_Benjamin Franklin_, of Pennsylvania, in the midst of his varied\r\nactivities as printer, diplomat, statesman, and philosopher, managed\r\nwithal by thrift and investments to accumulate a considerable fortune\r\nfor his day, about $150,000.[198] At his great age on the assembling of\r\nthe Convention, it would hardly have been practicable for him to have\r\nengaged in investments in public securities had he been so inclined; and\r\nhe died in 1790, before the funding system went into effect. A short\r\ntime before his death, however, he was interested in land\r\nspeculations;[199] and in his will he bequeaths “lands near the Ohio”\r\nand three thousand acres granted by the State of Georgia to him.[200] He\r\ndoes not appear to have held any public paper.\r\n\r\n_Nicholas Gilman_, of New Hampshire, was in public life from his youth\r\nuntil his death. He entered the army at the age of twenty-one, and after\r\nthe War he served in Congress and in other public positions. He does not\r\nseem to have been a man of much weight either in private life or the\r\nConvention. A French observer remarks of his election as a member of the\r\nFederal Convention: “Cette circonstance prouve qu’il n’y a pas un grand\r\nchoix à faire dans cet Etat, ou que du moins les hommes des plus sensés\r\net les plus habiles ne sont pas assés riches pour accepter une place\r\npublique.”[201]\r\n\r\nIn financial matters, there was no doubt of Gilman’s ability. He managed\r\nto accumulate a considerable amount of public securities before the\r\nmeeting of the Convention, and apparently added to his holdings later.\r\nIn the Nicholas Gilman papers preserved in the Library of Congress there\r\nis a list of certificates of the liquidated debt to the amount of\r\n$5400.67, declared to be the property of Nicholas Gilman, on December 9,\r\n1786. This paper was bought up by Gilman, for the list of original\r\nholders is given. A receipt bearing the date of June 29, 1787, preserved\r\nin the above papers, shows Nicholas Gilman to have received interest on\r\n$6654.79 of the public debt. He and the various members of the Gilman\r\nfamily of New Hampshire were extensively engaged in transactions in\r\npublic securities.[202] One entry in the Treasury books of the new\r\ngovernment shows Nicholas Gilman to have $11,021.95 worth of 6 per cent\r\nDeferred Stock;[203] and he supplemented his purely fiscal operations by\r\ndealing in military certificates (that is, soldier’s paper which could\r\nbe bought from necessitous holders at a fraction of its value), and in\r\npublic lands.[204]\r\n\r\nWhile Gilman was quick to look after his own interests, his devotion to\r\nhis native state made him anxious for her towns to participate in the\r\ngeneral prosperity enjoyed by holders of public securities after the\r\nformation of the Constitution. On September 3, 1787, he had already\r\ndiscovered the probable effect of the proposed Constitution, not yet\r\nready to lay before the people, upon the securities of the government.\r\nOn that day he wrote to the President of New Hampshire advising the\r\ntowns to buy up public securities at the prevailing low price in order\r\nto have paper to transfer to the federal government in lieu of taxes and\r\nother charges. He says: “I find many of the states are making provision\r\nto buy in their quota’s of the final settlements, and I must ardently\r\nwish that the towns in New Hampshire may be so far awake to a sense of\r\ntheir interest as to part with their property freely in order to\r\npurchase their several quota’s of the public securities now in\r\ncirculation, while they are to be had at the present low rate; which is\r\nin this place, at two shillings and six pence on the pound. If they\r\nsuffer the present opportunity to pass and we should be so fortunate as\r\nto have an efficient Government, they will be obliged to buy them of\r\nbrokers, hawkers, speculators, and jockeys at six or perhaps eight times\r\ntheir present value.”[205]\r\n\r\n_Elbridge Gerry_, of Massachusetts, was born in Marblehead in 1744. His\r\nfather was a merchant of good standing and comfortable estate. His\r\nbiographer states that after his graduation from Harvard, Elbridge\r\n“turned his attention to that line of life in which his father’s\r\nprosperity seemed to hold out the greatest inducements to a young and\r\nenterprising mind; and he plunged at once into the most active pursuits\r\nof commerce. His fairness, correctness, and assiduity, and the extensive\r\nknowledge of commercial concerns which he acquired from his father’s\r\nexperience and his own exertions were crowned with good fortune, and\r\nwhile yet young in business and in years he acquired a considerable\r\nestate and a very high standing at Marblehead.”[206]\r\n\r\nAs a merchant, Gerry was closely in touch with the needs of commerce,\r\nand was deeply impressed with the necessity for national resistance to\r\nthe discriminations of Great Britain. In April, 1784, he presented a\r\nreport to Congress in which he called attention to the fact that Great\r\nBritain had adopted regulations destructive to American commerce in the\r\nWest India Islands, and that these measures of discrimination were\r\ngrowing into a system. “Unless the United States in Congress assembled,”\r\nhe urged, “shall be vested with powers competent to the protection of\r\ncommerce, they can never command reciprocal advantages in trade; and\r\nwithout these, our foreign commerce must decline and eventually be\r\nannihilated.” The West Indian trade affected New England particularly,\r\nand Gerry is thus reflecting a local interest in demanding a national\r\nsystem of commercial protection.[207]\r\n\r\nIn addition to his mercantile interests, Gerry was concerned in\r\nfinancial affairs. In the Convention he strongly urged inserting in the\r\nConstitution a clause conferring on the new government not only the\r\npower but also the obligation to provide fully for the holders of public\r\nsecurities. According to Madison’s notes, “Mr. Gerry considered giving\r\nthe power only, without adopting the obligation, as destroying the\r\nsecurity now enjoyed by the public creditors of the United States. He\r\nenlarged on the merit of this class of citizens, and the solemn faith\r\nwhich had been pledged under the existing Confederation.”[208] Later in\r\nthe Convention, when Colonel Mason objected to making the full discharge\r\nof the debt obligatory, Gerry again took exceptions. He said, “that for\r\nhimself he had no interest in the question, being not possessed of more\r\nof the securities than would by the interest pay his taxes. He would\r\nobserve, however, that as the public had received the value of the\r\nliteral amount, they ought to pay that value to somebody. The frauds on\r\nthe soldiers ought to have been foreseen. These poor and ignorant people\r\ncould not but part with their securities. There are other creditors who\r\nwill part with anything rather than be cheated out of the capital of\r\ntheir advances.... If the public faith would admit, of which he was not\r\nclear, he would not object to a revision of the debt so far as to compel\r\nrestitution to the ignorant and distressed who had been defrauded. As to\r\nthe Stock-jobbers he saw no reason for the censures thrown on them. They\r\nkept up the value of the paper. Without them there would be no\r\nmarket.”[209]\r\n\r\nGerry here explains to his colleagues that he is a holder of securities;\r\nbut he modestly underestimates the amount, or his taxes were rather\r\nhigh, for the loan office records of Massachusetts show that the\r\ninterest on his securities, issued pursuant to the act of Congress of\r\nApril 28, 1784, was about $3500 a year, an amount which, even at the\r\nprevailing rate of depreciation, would have covered the taxes on a\r\nconsiderable estate.[210] The incompleteness of the records in the\r\nTreasury Department does not permit of an exact estimate of Gerry’s\r\nholdings; but they must have been large, for the following items appear\r\nto his credit: $14,266.89 on the Liquidated Debt Book of the\r\nMassachusetts loan office,[211] $2648.50 worth of sixes and threes in\r\n1790 on the Pennsylvania loan office books,[212] $409.50 in threes on\r\nthe Pennsylvania ledger under the date of December 13, 1790,[213] and\r\n£3504:8:10 worth of old paper funded into federal securities in the\r\nMassachusetts loan office, August 24, 1791.[214] There may be of course\r\nsome duplication of amounts but there can be no doubt that Gerry’s\r\ninterest income from confederate securities in one year shortly before\r\nthe meeting of the Convention was about $3500, and also there can be no\r\ndoubt that Gerry had bought largely with a view to speculation, for a\r\nvery few of his certificates were issued to him originally. He had\r\ntherefore more than an academic sympathy with the stockbrokers.\r\nNevertheless, it should be noted that notwithstanding his large\r\ninterests at stake, Gerry for several reasons strongly opposed the\r\nratification of the Constitution.[215]\r\n\r\nHowever, Gerry during his entire public career seems to have intermixed\r\nhis official relations with his private economic affairs. While he was a\r\nmember of Congress, before the adoption of the Constitution, he became\r\ninterested in the public lands. On March 1, 1785, Timothy\r\nPickering,[216] one of the leading land operators of the period, wrote\r\nto Gerry: “As you have expressed your wishes to be concerned in the\r\npurchase of lands on the other side of the Alleghany mountains thro’ our\r\nagency, we think it very material to your interest as well as our own\r\nthat we be informed, if possible, what plan Congress will probably adopt\r\nin disposing of those lands which lie west of the Ohio. If they mean to\r\npermit adventurers to make a scramble ... it will behove us to engage\r\nseasonably with some enterprising, but confidential character, to\r\nexplore the country and make locations.... If there must be a scramble,\r\nwe have an equal right with others, and, therefore, the information\r\ndesired in the beginning of this letter may be of essential importance.\r\nYour answer to this letter will much oblige your sincere friends who\r\nwish to advance your interest with their own.”[217]\r\n\r\nGerry was then a member of Congress, which had under consideration the\r\ndisposal of the western lands. If this land company, of course, could\r\nsecure inside information, it would be advantageous to Mr. Gerry who\r\ncontemplated speculating in those lands, as well as to Mr. Pickering’s\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nGerry undoubtedly took advantage of the opportunity to invest in western\r\nenterprises, for he was a share-holder in the Ohio Company, proprietors\r\nof lands on the Muskingum River[218]—a concern in which he apparently\r\nbecame interested while a member of the Congress under the Articles of\r\nConfederation, during the organization of the Company and the procuring\r\nof the public grant.\r\n\r\n_Nathaniel Gorham_, of Massachusetts, was a successful merchant at\r\nCharlestown, the place of his birth. He was prominent in the political\r\nlife of his community, having served as a member of the legislature and\r\nthe constitutional convention of his state.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his mercantile and political pursuits, Gorham engaged in\r\nland speculation on a large scale. In 1786, Massachusetts, by a\r\ncompromise with New York, secured a large area of western country, and\r\nin April, 1788, “sold all this land to Nathaniel Gorham, of Charlestown,\r\nand Oliver Phelps, of Granville, for a million dollars, to be paid in\r\nthree annual instalments in the scrip of Massachusetts, known as\r\nconsolidated securities, which were then much below par.... Behind\r\nPhelps and Gorham there was a syndicate of persons who desired to\r\nspeculate in the lands, but who, in order not to compete with each\r\nother, had united and allowed these two to act for all.”[219]\r\n\r\nRobert Morris was one of Gorham’s associates in this venture, and other\r\nprominent men were behind the project; but the projectors were unable to\r\nrealize fully on their scheme, because the rise of Massachusetts scrip,\r\nafter the adoption of the Constitution, made it impossible for them to\r\nfulfil the original terms of their contract. Consequently, they received\r\nonly a portion of the original purchase.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy outcome of this venture apparently left Gorham without a\r\nvery large fortune at his death in 1796. He does not seem to have\r\ncombined any considerable transactions in continental securities with\r\nthose in state scrip; although he was doubtless a holder in some amount\r\nbecause his will shows him to have been possessed of twenty shares in\r\nUnited States Bank stock.[220] Inasmuch as holders of this paper secured\r\nit in exchange for old securities and some specie, it may be surmised\r\nthat Gorham must have had some of the continental paper at the time of\r\nthe establishment of the Bank, although it may be that he purchased the\r\nstock as an investment. The tangled state of his affairs at his death\r\nmakes this latter conclusion improbable at least.\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the colossal genius of the new system, _Alexander\r\nHamilton_. It is true, that he had little part in the formation of the\r\nConstitution, but it was his organizing ability that made it a real\r\ninstrument bottomed on all the substantial interests of the time. It was\r\nhe who saw most keenly the precise character of the social groups which\r\nwould have to be rallied to the new government in order to draw support\r\naway from the states and give the federal system a firm foundation. He\r\nperceived that governments were not made out of thin air and abstract\r\nprinciples. He knew that the Constitution was designed to accomplish\r\ncertain definite objects, affecting in its operation certain definite\r\ngroups of property rights in society. He saw that these interests were\r\nat first inchoate, in process of organization, and he achieved the task\r\nof completing their consolidation and attaching them to the federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHe saw, in the first place, that the most easily consolidated and\r\ntimorous group was composed of the creditors, the financiers, bankers,\r\nand money lenders. He perceived that they were concentrated in the towns\r\nand thus were easily drawn together. He saw that by identifying their\r\ninterests with those of the new government, the latter would be secure;\r\nthey would not desert the ship in which they were all afloat. It has\r\nbeen charged that he leaned always on the side of the financial interest\r\nagainst the public as represented in the government; but it must be\r\nremembered that at the time the new system went into effect, the public\r\nhad no credit, and financiers were not willing to forego their gains and\r\nprofits for an abstraction. It is charged against him that he did not\r\nbuy up government paper in behalf of the public at the most favorable\r\nterms; but to have done so would have diminished the profits of the very\r\nfinanciers whose good will was necessary to the continuance of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe second group of interests which Hamilton saw ready for organization\r\nwere the merchants and manufacturers who wished protective tariffs. He\r\nwould have been blind, indeed, if he had not discovered and interpreted\r\nthe widespread movement for protection which was swiftly gathering\r\nheadway during the years preceding the formation of the Constitution. He\r\nwas not blind. His first report on manufactures show how keenly alive he\r\nwas to the extent and diversity of the groups whose financial advantage\r\nlay in a system of protection. Whether this was for the good of the\r\nwhole people need not be argued here. Hamilton’s relations were with the\r\nimmediate beneficiaries. They were the men who were to throw their\r\nweight on the side of the new government. How persistently Hamilton\r\nsought to inform himself of the precise nature of the interests needing\r\nprotection in the separate localities, from New Hampshire to Georgia, is\r\nevidenced by his unpublished correspondence with business men in all the\r\ncommercial centres.[221]\r\n\r\nThe third interest which Hamilton consolidated was composed of the land\r\nspeculators and promoters and embraced all the leading men of the\r\ntime—Washington, Franklin, Robert Morris, James Wilson, William Blount,\r\nand other men of eminence.[222] This dealing in land was intimately\r\nconnected with public securities, for a large portion of the lands were\r\nbought with land warrants purchased from the soldiers, and with other\r\nstocks bought on the open market at low prices. Hamilton saw clearly the\r\nconnection of this interest with the new government, and his public land\r\npolicies were directed especially to obtaining the support of this type\r\nof operators.[223]\r\n\r\nWithout the conciliation and positive support of these powerful elements\r\nin American society, the new government could not have been founded or\r\ncontinued. With keen insight, Hamilton saw this. He made no attempt to\r\nconceal it; for whatever may have been his faults he did not add the\r\ncrime of demogogy. It is true that in private he often expressed a\r\ncontempt for popular rule which is absent from his public papers; but\r\nhis public papers contain a plain statement of his policies, and show\r\nwhy he considered them necessary to the strength and stability of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThousands of small farmers and debtors and laboring mechanics were\r\nopposed to his policies, but they did not have the organization or\r\nconsciousness of identity of interests which was necessary to give them\r\nweight in the councils of the new government. They were partly\r\ndisfranchised under the existing laws, and they had no leaders worthy of\r\nmention. The road to power and glory did not yet lie in championing\r\ntheir cause. It required the astute leadership of Jefferson, and the\r\ncreation of a federal machine under his direction, to consolidate the\r\nheterogeneous petty interests against the Federalist group.\r\n\r\nBut during Hamilton’s administration, representatives of these smaller\r\ninterests began to attack his policies as inimical to public interest,\r\n_i.e._, their own interests; and out of this attack grew the charge that\r\nHamilton himself was privately engaged in augmenting his personal\r\nfortune by the methods which he had created for the advantage of public\r\ncreditors and financiers generally. Although this charge, even if true,\r\nshould not be allowed to obscure the real greatness of Hamilton’s\r\nmasterly mind, and has little bearing upon a scientific application of\r\nthe economic interpretation to the period, it deserves examination at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nRumors that Hamilton was personally interested in securities were\r\npersistent from the beginning of his career as Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and in his famous Reynolds pamphlet, published in 1797, he\r\nprecisely states the charge against himself: “Merely because I retained\r\nan opinion once common to me and the most influential of those who\r\nopposed me, that the public debt ought to be provided for on the basis\r\nof the contract upon which it was created, I have been wickedly accused\r\nwith wantonly increasing the public burthen many millions in order to\r\npromote a stock-jobbing interest of myself and friends.”[224] That this\r\nheavy burden was necessary to secure the support of the financial\r\ninterests concerned, and that their support was absolutely indispensable\r\nto the establishment of the new national system on a substantial basis,\r\nwas admitted by many of Hamilton’s worst enemies; but this did not\r\nprevent their attacking the Secretary on mere rumors of private\r\npeculations.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to examine the evidence against Hamilton, and state the\r\ncase fairly so far as our existing records will allow. In 1793, Hamilton\r\nwas accused of a criminal violation of the laws, and laid under the\r\nsuspicion of being a defaulter. The House of Representatives was so\r\nimpressed with the charges that it appointed a committee to investigate\r\nthe conduct of the Treasury Department, particularly with regard to the\r\ncharge that Hamilton had made the public moneys “subservient to loans,\r\ndiscounts, and accommodations” to himself and friends.\r\n\r\nThe result of this investigation was a vindication of the Secretary by\r\nthe committee on the basis of affidavits from the officers and employees\r\nof the various banks involved, public and private. Hamilton cites the\r\nreport of this committee of the House as containing the “materials of a\r\ncomplete exculpation.”[225] But this investigation does not cover the\r\ndealings which Hamilton might have had with stock brokers and other\r\npersons handling public securities. Evidences of such relations would\r\nnot have been contained in the public and private papers available to\r\nthe committee. Indeed, on account of his intimate business relations\r\nwith all the leaders who were buying and selling public securities, and,\r\non account of the fact that he could have seen them personally at New\r\nYork and Philadelphia, it would not have been necessary for him to make\r\nany written record of such transactions. But of the larger charges\r\nbrought against him in Congress we may regard this report as a complete\r\nvindication.\r\n\r\nThe direct charge, however, that Hamilton had violated the solemn\r\nobligations of his own office by buying up public securities, as\r\ndistinct from the charge that he had employed his high authority in the\r\ninterests of his friends and his class, first took on a serious form in\r\n1797, when the notorious pamphleteer J. T. Callender, in his _History of\r\nthe United States for the Year 1796_ published a series of papers\r\npurporting to show that in 1791 and 1792 Hamilton had been engaged in\r\nspeculative ventures with one James Reynolds and Mr. Duer.[226] It\r\nappears that in 1792 a Mr. Clingman, then in jail for a crooked\r\ntransaction with the government, got into communication with Speaker\r\nMuhlenburg and hinted that a fellow-prisoner, Reynolds, had been\r\nassociated with Hamilton in security operations, and had in his\r\npossession papers that would establish the facts in the case. Muhlenburg\r\ncommunicated with Monroe and Venable, and the three heard from Reynolds\r\nand his wife grave charges against the Secretary.\r\n\r\nOn learning of these serious charges, Muhlenburg, Venable, and Monroe\r\nconfronted Hamilton with them and the Secretary explained that the whole\r\ncharge of speculation was false and that his relations with the Reynolds\r\ngrew out of an unhappy amour with Mrs. Reynolds. The three investigators\r\naccepted this explanation, although Monroe prosecuted further inquiries\r\nwhich resulted in his accumulating additional charges. The papers in the\r\ncase, it was agreed by Hamilton and his three investigators,[227] were\r\nto be kept secret and out of the reach of publication. It turned out,\r\nhowever, that Monroe, angered by the abuse heaped upon him later by the\r\nFederalists, gave the documents out for publication, much to the scandal\r\nof the country. Hamilton promptly replied in a pamphlet in which he\r\ndenied any improper financial relations with Reynolds, and explained in\r\npainful detail his affair with Reynolds’ wife.[228]\r\n\r\nWhen all the external and internal evidence is taken in this case, and\r\nthe documents connected with it are carefully analyzed, it will be\r\napparent that a decision will rest upon the answer to this question:\r\n“Shall Hamilton’s testimony as to speculations outweigh that of an\r\nundoubted rascal and his wife?” Mr. F. T. Fox, in a recent study of the\r\nmatter, attempts to convict Hamilton on the internal evidence of his\r\nvindication; and apparently does so. But on an examination of Mr. Fox’s\r\nbrief against the Secretary, it soon comes out that he has made a\r\nmistake in the crucial dates on which turns his whole case.[229]\r\nConsequently, this particular matter rests just where it did more than a\r\nhundred years ago. Fair-minded men will be inclined to exonerate\r\nHamilton of the charge brought in the Reynolds indictment.\r\n\r\nThat Hamilton himself made any money in stocks which he held personally\r\nhas never been proved by reference to any authentic evidence. He did\r\nhold a small amount of public securities, for in a letter of June 26,\r\n1792, to William Seton, he says, “All my property in the funds is about\r\n$800, 3 per cents. These at a certain period I should have sold, had I\r\nnot been unwilling to give occasion to cavil.”[230] The origin of this\r\nholding is not explained. Even if it was derived from the funding under\r\nthe acts of August, 1790, and the 6 per cents, funded and deferred were\r\nadded, it would not have made more than a trifling amount.\r\n\r\nThat Hamilton ever held any considerable sum in securities seems highly\r\nimprobable, for he was at no time a rich man, and at his death left a\r\nsmall estate. Though he lived well, and had a large income apart from\r\nhis paltry salary as Secretary, his earnings as an eminent lawyer may\r\nvery well account for such sources of revenue as he may have enjoyed.\r\nCertainly, had he seen fit to employ his remarkable talents in private\r\nenterprise, he might have died one of the rich men of his day. However\r\nthis may be, the question may be legitimately asked whether Hamilton had\r\nany personal connections with any of the security operations which were\r\ncarried on during his administration of the Treasury?\r\n\r\nHamilton’s defenders, in response to such an inquiry, will cite his\r\nfamous reply to Henry Lee in 1789, when the latter asked him for his\r\nopinion about the probable rise of public securities: “I am sure you are\r\nsincere when you say that you would not subject me to an impropriety,\r\nnor do I know that there would be any in answering your queries; but you\r\nremember the saying with regard to Cæsar’s wife. I think the spirit of\r\nit applicable to every man concerned in the administration of the\r\nfinances of the country. With respect to the conduct of such men,\r\nsuspicion is ever eagle-eyed, and the most innocent things may be\r\nmisinterpreted.”[231]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Maclay, who, as United States Senator during the\r\nfunding operations, had opportunities for first-hand information,\r\nanswers the above question in the affirmative. He says, in his record of\r\nthe Senate on February 1, 1790: “If I needed proof of the baseness of\r\nHamilton, I have it in the fullest manner. His price was communicated in\r\nmanuscript as far as Philadelphia. Thomas Willing, in a letter to the\r\nspeaker of the Representatives, after passing many eulogiums on\r\nHamilton’s plan, concludes, ‘For I have seen in manuscript his whole\r\nprice,’ and it has been used as the basis of the most abandoned system\r\nof speculation ever broached in our country.”[232] What Maclay doubtless\r\nmeans here is that Hamilton had communicated to one of the leading\r\nfinanciers of Philadelphia, a partner of Robert Morris and dealer in\r\nsecurities,[233] his proposed plans for redemption of the public debt in\r\nfull, previous to their publication in the first report to the House on\r\npublic credit, January 9, 1790. On the question as to how much credence\r\nshould be given to the assertions of the querulous Maclay, students of\r\nhistory will differ, and impartial scholars will seek further evidence.\r\n\r\nFar from admitting any truth in Maclay’s allegations, Hamilton’s friends\r\nwould indignantly deny that he had any private connections with security\r\noperations in any form. Hamilton’s son, in his _Reminiscences_, states\r\nthat “Hamilton requested his father-in-law, General Schuyler, not to\r\npermit his son to speculate in the public securities lest it should be\r\ninferred that their speculations were made upon information furnished by\r\nHamilton; or were made in part on Hamilton’s account. Schuyler inhibited\r\nany speculations; as Van Rensellaer Schuyler, my uncle, told me,\r\ncomplaining at the same time that, but for this inhibition, he would\r\nhave made a large sum of money.”[234]\r\n\r\nThe General, however, evidently did not regard this inhibition as\r\nbinding upon himself, for he appears upon the records as one of the\r\nlarge dealers in public paper in New York. Examples of his extensive\r\nfinancial transactions can be readily found by reference to the old loan\r\nbooks in the Treasury Department; there appear in March, October, and\r\nNovember, 1791, the following amounts to his credit: $23,189.21;\r\n$15,594.61, $8036.50, $20,689.21.[235]\r\n\r\nNeither did Hamilton deem it necessary to inhibit his brother-in-law,\r\nJ.B. Church, from dealing in securities. During Hamilton’s\r\nadministration of the Treasury, Church was a large holder of public\r\nsecurities.[236] One entry credits him with $28,187.91 worth. Moreover,\r\nwhile Secretary of the Treasury, through his agents, Thomas Willing in\r\nPhiladelphia, and Wm. Seton in New York, Hamilton bought and sold for\r\nhis brother-in-law. In the Hamilton Mss. in the Library of Congress is\r\npreserved a letter from Thomas Willing bearing the date of February 24,\r\n1790, and addressed to Hamilton, which shows that the former was then\r\nselling stocks under the latter’s orders for Church.[237]\r\n\r\nAt a later date, Hamilton was engaged in an extended correspondence with\r\nWilliam Seton of the New York Bank, which shows that the latter was\r\nbuying United States Bank stocks for Church, under Hamilton’s orders. On\r\nNovember 21, 1793, Seton writes that he has not been able to make an\r\ninvestment for Mr. Church on account of the high price of bank\r\nstock.[238] Five days later Seton writes to Hamilton that he thinks it\r\nwill be possible in a day or two to purchase stock for Mr. Church “under\r\nyour limits;” and adds, after further remarks, “I therefore feel loth to\r\nenter into the market without further orders from you.”[239] Here\r\nfollows voluminous correspondence showing Seton’s successful purchases.\r\n\r\nHamilton’s operations for his brother-in-law, Church, also extended to\r\nspeculations in public lands; for in the Hamilton Manuscripts there is a\r\nletter bearing the date of August 24, 1792, from William Henderson to\r\nhim relative to the purchase of large quantities of land (45,000\r\nacres).[240] It appears that Hamilton, Church, and General Schuyler were\r\ninvolved in this negotiation, and that Church was the principal.\r\n\r\nHamilton was also personally interested in western land schemes, for he\r\nheld five shares of the Ohio Company, proprietors of land on the\r\nMuskingum River.[241] Although this concern was organized before the\r\nformation of the Constitution, Hamilton as Secretary of the Treasury was\r\ncalled upon to pass upon the validity of claims involving thousands of\r\nacres. He felt the delicacy of this situation, for on May 9, 1792, he\r\nwrote to Washington that he regretted that he was required by law to\r\ndecide a case in which he was an interested party, and stated that he\r\nhad left the matter to be adjusted by the accounting officers of the\r\nTreasury acting under an opinion of the Attorney General.[242]\r\n\r\nAlthough Hamilton showed great hesitancy in passing upon his own land\r\nclaims while Secretary, he did not deem it incompatible with his\r\nofficial duties to communicate occasionally with friends as to the\r\nprobable prices of public securities and bank stock.\r\n\r\nFor the communication to Willing, mentioned above,[243] we have, of\r\ncourse, only Maclay’s testimony; and if his statement is true Hamilton\r\ntransmitted official secrets of the most significant character to a\r\nfinancier who, however great his integrity, was in a position to take\r\nadvantage of them, and was engaged in dealing in securities on his own\r\naccount and for Hamilton’s brother-in-law, Church, under Hamilton’s\r\norders. When we remember that Maclay’s journal was private in its\r\nnature, not intended for publication, and not given to the world until\r\nlong after all the men mentioned in it were dead, we are constrained to\r\ngive some credence to his straightforward statements like the one in\r\nquestion, even though he was a bitter enemy of the Federalist leaders.\r\nBut we are not constrained to attribute to Hamilton any improper\r\nmotives. Those who assume that the Secretary of the Treasury could have\r\ncarried out his enormous reorganization of the finances without\r\nconferring with the leading financiers of the time have only an\r\nelementary knowledge of Treasury administration.\r\n\r\nAs Secretary, he often found it necessary to set rumors at rest. An\r\ninstance is afforded in a letter written by Hamilton, on August 17,\r\n1791, to Rufus King, in which he mentioned having given out his opinion\r\non prices to counteract an undue rise in script on the stock market, and\r\nconcluded by giving King his standard of prices on that day, saying “I\r\ngive you my standard that you may be able if necessary to contradict\r\ninsinuations of an estimation on my part short of that standard for the\r\npurpose of depressing the funds.”[244]\r\n\r\nThis letter from Hamilton was evidently drawn by one from King bearing\r\nthe date of August 15, 1791, in which the latter cautions the former\r\nagainst giving out any statements which might affect prices, and informs\r\nhim that his opinions had been quoted in efforts to depress stocks.[245]\r\nKing also adds that Duer had been injured in attempts to raise prices,\r\nbut is of the opinion that “his conduct has been as correct as any\r\nbuyer’s and seller’s could be.” King had little liking for popular\r\nvagaries in finance, for he tells Hamilton that “the fall of Bank\r\ncertificates may have some good effects; it will operate to deter our\r\nindustrious citizens from meddling in future with the funds, and teach\r\nthem contentment in their proper avocations.”\r\n\r\nOn the same day that Hamilton replied to King’s letter which had\r\ninformed him of Duer’s danger, he wrote to Duer cautioning him against\r\npushing prices too high and repeating earlier warnings. He says: “I will\r\nhonestly own I had serious fears for you—for your purse and for your\r\nreputation; and with an anxiety for both, I wrote you in earnest terms.\r\nYou are sanguine, my friend. You ought to be aware of it yourself and to\r\nbe on your guard against the propensity.... I do not widely differ from\r\nyou about the real value of bank script. I should rather call it about\r\n190, to be within bounds, with hopes of better things, and I sincerely\r\nwish you may be able to support it at what you mention.”[246] There is\r\nof course, little beyond friendly advice in this, although Hamilton’s\r\nenemies may see impropriety in his communicating his own price to a man\r\ndeeply engaged in speculation.\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence, however, which may reasonably be interpreted to\r\nimply that Hamilton might have used his official power in behalf of\r\nDuer. In reply to a letter from Duer (after his disastrous failure)\r\nmaking some request which is not explained by Mr. Lodge, the Secretary\r\nsays: “Your letter of the 11th got to hand this day. I am affected\r\nbeyond measure at its contents, especially as it is too late to have any\r\ninfluence upon the event you were apprehensive of, Mr. Wolcott’s\r\ninstructions having gone off yesterday.”[247] Wolcott was Hamilton’s\r\nsubordinate in the Treasury Department, and evidently he had issued some\r\ninstructions which affected Duer’s fortunes. Wolcott was the auditor of\r\nthe Treasury whose duty it was under the act of September 2, 1789, “to\r\nreceive all public accounts and after examination to certify the\r\nbalance, and transmit the accounts with the vouchers and certificates to\r\nthe Comptroller for his decision thereon.” This connection with Duer is\r\nthe sole piece of evidence of what might be termed the possible use of\r\nthe Secretary’s office in a private matter. The nature of this is not\r\nclear, and the plan was not carried out.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to be reached from this evidence is that Hamilton did not\r\nhave in 1787 any more than a petty amount of public securities which\r\nmight appreciate under a new system; that he did have some western land;\r\nbut that an extensive augmentation of his personal fortune was no\r\nconsideration with him. The fact that he died a poor man is conclusive\r\nevidence of this fact. That he was swayed throughout the period of the\r\nformation of the Constitution by large policies of government—not by any\r\nof the personal interests so often ascribed to him—must therefore be\r\nadmitted. Nevertheless, it is apparent from the additional evidence\r\ngiven here that it was no mere abstract political science which\r\ndominated his principles of government. He knew at first hand the stuff\r\nof which government is made.\r\n\r\n_William C. Houston_, of New Jersey, was of no consequence in the\r\nConvention, and little is known of his economic interests. He was a\r\nPrinceton graduate, and was for a time professor of mathematics and\r\nnatural philosophy. He entered the practice of law at Trenton, and from\r\n1784 until his death in 1788 he was clerk of the Supreme Court of his\r\nstate. On account of ill health he was unable to remain through the\r\nsessions of the Convention. A search among the New Jersey loan office\r\nrecords in the Treasury Department failed to reveal Houston as a holder\r\nof securities; but the records for that state are incomplete and\r\nHouston’s death in 1788 would have prevented his appearing on the\r\nTreasury Records of the new government. A William Houston is recorded in\r\nthe New York books for small amounts of deferred sixes,[248] but,\r\nalthough William Churchill Houston had a son by that name, the identity\r\nof the son and the public creditor cannot be established.\r\n\r\nHouston was, however, interested in the possibilities of western land\r\nspeculations, for his biographer relates that he “joined with others in\r\nprocuring for John Fitch, the steamboat inventor, the office of Deputy\r\nSurveyor. After the treaty of peace with England, the question of how\r\nthe lands northwest of the Ohio should be disposed of was mooted in\r\nCongress. It was thought that they would be sold to pay the debts of the\r\nconfederacy. Fitch was a land jobber and supposed that a good operation\r\nmight be made by a presurvey of the country, so that when the Land\r\nOffices were opened, warrants might be taken out immediately for choice\r\ntracts. He found no difficulty in forming a company to forward such an\r\nenterprise. It was composed of Dr. John Ewing, Rev. Nathaniel Irwin, Wm.\r\nC. Houston.... These gentlemen put £20 each in a fund to pay\r\nexpenses.”[249] How far this venture was carried and whether Houston\r\nacquired lands through it is not related. As a member of the Congress\r\nunder the Articles of Confederation, he doubtless learned of the\r\nadvantages to be gained in the West.\r\n\r\n_William Houstoun_, of Georgia, took some part in the proceedings of the\r\nConvention, but he was of little weight. He was the son of a royal\r\nofficer in the government of Georgia; and he received his education in\r\nEngland and studied law at the Inner Temple. His colleague Pierce\r\nrecords that “Mr. Houstoun is an Attorney at Law, and has been a member\r\nof Congress for the state of Georgia. He is a gentleman of family, and\r\nwas educated in England. As to his legal or political knowledge, he has\r\nlittle to boast of.”[250] The meagre biographical details available do\r\nnot permit a statement of his economic interests; and the paucity of the\r\nrecords of the Georgia loan office in the Treasury Department makes it\r\nimpossible to say whether he was among the beneficiaries through the\r\nappreciation of public securities. An index to a volume of Treasury\r\nRecords not found (Vol. XXVI, folio 44) contains the name of William\r\nHoustown, but whether this holder of public debt and the member of the\r\nConvention were identical cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n_Jared Ingersoll_, of Pennsylvania, was the son of Jared Ingersoll of\r\nConnecticut, sometime agent of that colony as commissioner in England\r\nand later admiralty judge in Pennsylvania. He graduated at Yale and\r\nstudied in the Middle Temple. At the bar in Philadelphia he “soon rose\r\nto first rank. His practice was larger than any others. His opinions\r\nwere taken on all important controversies, his services engaged in every\r\ngreat litigation.”[251] Ingersoll was a man of considerable wealth, but\r\nhe does not seem to be involved in the large transactions in public\r\nsecurities which engaged the attention of his intimate friends in the\r\nConvention.[252] He does not appear on the Pennsylvania books as a\r\nholder of securities. If he held any, his transactions must have been\r\nwith the Treasury direct, and this would have been very convenient as it\r\nwas located in Philadelphia during the funding process. Ingersoll was a\r\nson-in-law of Charles Pettit, one of the security operators in\r\nPhiladelphia.[253]\r\n\r\n_Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer_, of Maryland, is reported by Pierce to\r\nhave been “a gentleman of fortune” in his state.[254] He was a planter\r\nand a slave-holder; the census of 1790 records his holding twenty slaves\r\non one plantation under an overseer, but the number on his own\r\nplantation is illegible.[255] It is probable also that he held a small\r\namount of public securities at the establishment of the new government.\r\nHe died in the latter part of the year 1790, but his son,[256] Daniel\r\nJenifer, Jr., appears on the loan office records as the holder of nearly\r\nsix thousand dollars’ worth of paper in December, 1790,[257] which he\r\ndisposed of the following year.[258]\r\n\r\n_William Samuel Johnson_, of Connecticut, was a son of Samuel Johnson, a\r\nclergyman of Stratford, Connecticut, and a gentleman of some means. He\r\nwas a graduate of Yale, and entered the practice of law. He refused to\r\naid in the Revolutionary cause, because he could not “conscientiously”\r\ntake up arms against England, and he lived in retirement until the War\r\nwas over. After the establishment of independence he resumed the\r\nprominent position in public life which he had enjoyed before the\r\nstruggle; and according to his biographer he took “the highest rank in\r\nhis profession and became the renowned and high-minded advocate who was\r\nalways crowded with cases and had his clients in New York as well as in\r\nevery part of Connecticut.”[259] He added to his own patrimony by\r\nmarrying the daughter of a “wealthy gentleman” of Stratford.\r\n\r\nJohnson was a member of the first Senate under the new Constitution, and\r\nhe was included by Jefferson in the list of men “operating in\r\nsecurities.”[260] It is highly probable that he did not aid the\r\nRevolutionary cause by investing his money in the original paper; and he\r\ndoes not appear on the Treasury Books for large amounts of stock,[261]\r\nbut there is every reason for believing that he carried on extensive\r\noperations through his son Robert Charles Johnson. The latter was\r\nspeculating extensively in New York and Connecticut immediately after\r\nthe establishment of the new government, and two entries show a credit\r\nto the father through the son.[262] The loan office books under the date\r\nof December 13, 1791, credit Robert Charles Johnson, of Stratford,\r\nGentleman, with nearly fifty thousand dollars’ worth of sixes and\r\nthrees.[263] Connecticut loan office receipts confirm this evidence of\r\nhis extensive holdings. The New York loan office also shows large\r\ntransactions in the name of Robert Charles Johnson.[264]\r\n\r\n_Rufus King_, of Massachusetts, was born in Scarborough, Maine, then in\r\nthe province of Massachusetts, March 24, 1755. His father, in 1740, was\r\n“in prosperous business as a trader and factor for Ebenezer Thornton,\r\none of the principal merchants in Boston for whom he purchased and\r\nprepared large quantities of timber.” On settling at Scarborough, his\r\nfather became “both a farmer and a merchant, and in each capacity was so\r\nsuccessful as to become the owner of three thousand acres of land\r\ndivided into several valuable farms and to be the largest exporter of\r\nlumber from Maine.” Rufus was educated at Harvard. When his father died\r\nin 1775 he left a good estate which was divided among several children.\r\nRufus King was also fortunate in his marriage; his wife was Mary Alsop.\r\nHer father at first sympathized with the movement against Great Britain,\r\nbut, “taking umbrage at the manner in which the New York convention had\r\nconveyed their adhesion to the Declaration of Independence to the\r\nCongress, and besides unwilling to close the door of reconciliation with\r\nGreat Britain,”—he retired to Middletown, Connecticut, and stayed until\r\nafter the War was over, when he returned to New York, resumed business,\r\nand became president of the Chamber of Commerce. According to King\r\nhimself, his wife “was the only child of Mr. John Alsop, a very\r\nrespectable and eminent merchant in this city [New York]. Mr. Alsop\r\ndeclined business in 1775 with a very handsome fortune.”[265] King thus\r\nhad extensive mercantile and other business interests which were largely\r\nmanaged for him by others, so that he was able to devote most of his\r\ntime to politics.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he did not neglect matters of private economy. Robert and\r\nGouverneur Morris were engaged in 1788 in a plan to associate a number\r\nof Americans in a project to purchase up the debt (or portions thereof)\r\nof the United States due to France. Wadsworth, General Knox, Osgood, and\r\nColonel Duer were involved in it. It was first proposed to send\r\nGouverneur Morris as minister to Holland to further the scheme. The\r\noriginators of the plan finally hit upon the appointment of Rufus King.\r\nKing replied to the overture: “I told Col. Duer that I was not\r\nindisposed to a foreign appointment—that the honor and duties of such an\r\noffice wd. be my sovereign rule of Cond. and that if in perfect\r\nconsistence with the duties and dignity of the office, I cd. promote the\r\ninterest of my friends, it wd. be a great satisfaction to me. But that I\r\ndesired not to be considered as giving an answer any way at present,\r\nthat ... the opinions of Mr. Jay and Col. Hamilton were of consequence\r\nin my mind. That previous to any decision on my part I must be\r\nascertained of their opinions.”[266]\r\n\r\nWhether King engaged in this ambitious project or not, there is evidence\r\nto show that he was a considerable holder of government paper shortly\r\nafter its establishment. It may be that a part of his fortune had been\r\ninvested originally in public securities, although this is not apparent\r\nfrom the early loan office books in the Treasury Department. Jefferson\r\nputs King down among the holders of bank stock and public\r\nsecurities;[267] and he is correct in his statement. King was director\r\nin the first United States bank.[268] He was also a large holder of\r\ngovernment securities—one entry records more than $10,000 worth to his\r\ncredit.[269] King thought that speculations should be reserved to the\r\nexperienced, and rejoiced in the hope that one of the crashes would\r\nteach the ordinary industrious citizens “contentment in their proper\r\navocations.”[270]\r\n\r\n_John Langdon_, of New Hampshire, was born on the family farm near\r\nPortsmouth in 1740, and “after a mercantile education in the counting\r\nroom of Daniel Rindge, he entered upon a sea-faring life, but was driven\r\nfrom it by the revolutionary troubles.” He must have prospered, however,\r\nbefore the War blighted his trade, for when the news of the fall of\r\nTiconderoga reached Exeter, he rose in the legislature of which he was\r\nthe speaker and said: “I have a thousand dollars in hard money; I will\r\npledge my plate for three thousand more. I have seventy hogsheads of\r\nTobago rum which will be sold for the most they will bring. They are at\r\nthe service of the state. If we succeed ... I will be remunerated; if we\r\ndo not then the property will be of no value to me.”[271]\r\n\r\nAfter the war, Langdon’s various mercantile and commercial enterprises\r\ntook on new life, and there is every evidence that in his worldly\r\naffairs he was uniformly prosperous. A French report to the Ministry of\r\nForeign Affairs on the Congress of 1788 speaks of John Langdon as a man\r\nof great wealth and pressing commercial interests: “M. L. a fait une\r\ngrande fortune dans le commerce, c’est le Rob. Morris de son Etat,\r\nfaisant une grande dépense et s’attachant beaucoup de citoyens par ses\r\nlibéralités.”[272]\r\n\r\nJohn Langdon-Elwyn, grandson of John Langdon, in whose family were\r\npreserved the valuable private papers of the elder Langdon, wrote,\r\nsometime in the early part of the nineteenth century, a pamphlet on his\r\ncelebrated grandfather. The author of this useful brochure “was nineteen\r\nyears of age at the time of his grandfather’s death. A critical observer\r\nof men and affairs, his opportunities as a member of the family of\r\nGovernor Langdon give the production of his pamphlet a special\r\nsignificance.”[273] This writer characterizes John Langdon as “a man\r\nthat loved money, at an age when it gets the upper hand, that was prone\r\nto banking and funding, to whom such atmospheres were familiar and\r\ncongenial, that knew how to make it and keep it, and felt no envy of\r\nothers that did so too.”[274]\r\n\r\nThat Langdon was deeply concerned in the financial operations connected\r\nwith the new government is evidenced in many sources. According to his\r\ngrandson, quoted above, “He voted for this bank [the first United States\r\nBank]; and was we suppose an original subscriber of some account.... We\r\nbelieve he had been concerned in the Bank of North America: the first\r\nreal National Bank: He was an intimate friend of Robert Morris.”[275]\r\n\r\nMaclay also adds his testimony to that of Langdon’s grandson. When he\r\nwas a Senator, Langdon lodged in New York with a Mr. Hazard who followed\r\nthe business of buying up government certificates of public debt which\r\nhad been “issued in place of the paper money of the old Congress and\r\nbore interest for their face value,” and had depreciated to even as low\r\nas seven cents on the dollar. Maclay writes, “Mr. Hazard told me he had\r\nmade a business of it; it is easy to guess for whom. I told him, ‘You\r\nare then among the happy few who have been let into the secret.’ He\r\nseemed abashed and I checked by my forwardness much more information\r\nwhich he seemed disposed to give.”[276]\r\n\r\nThe loan office books of New Hampshire show that Langdon was a large\r\ncreditor of the new government, and indeed he was one of the heavy\r\noriginal contributors who risked their fortunes on the outcome of the\r\nWar.[277] One entry in the New Hampshire ledger credits him with more\r\nthan $25,000 worth of sixes and threes;[278] and there are other entries\r\nas well. His brother, Woodbury Langdon, was also among the holders of\r\npublic paper.\r\n\r\nWith that patriotism to his state and thrift in her interest that\r\ncharacterized his colleague, Gilman, Langdon sought to give the\r\ncommonwealth some advantage in the various speculations in securities.\r\nOn January 7, 1791, he wrote to the President of New Hampshire advising\r\nhim of the approaching passage of the National Bank bill and advising\r\nthat the state use its continental securities and some cash to buy stock\r\nin the new Bank. He says that the stock “would undoubtedly sell for\r\nspecie at par at any time ...; and in all probability it would soon sell\r\nabove par, the state would therefore run no risque of looseing.”[279]\r\n\r\n_John Lansing_, of New York, was a lawyer at Albany and the mayor of\r\nthat city. William Pierce, in his notes on the Convention, speaks of him\r\nin the following language: “His legal knowledge, I am told, is not\r\nextensive nor his education a good one. He is however a man of good\r\nsense, plain in his manners, and sincere in his friendships.”[280]\r\nLansing was one of the stout opponents of the Constitution and left the\r\nConvention early. He was there long enough however to learn (what was\r\nnot a very deep secret) the certain effect of an efficient government on\r\ncontinental securities; for in January, 1791, immediately after the\r\nestablishment of the new financial system, he appeared at the New York\r\nloan office with paper to fund to the amount of over seven thousand\r\ndollars.[281] All the members of the Lansing family in Albany seem to\r\nhave taken advantage of the opportunity to augment their fortunes.[282]\r\n\r\n_William Livingston_, of New Jersey, was a member of the distinguished\r\nLivingston family which was among the largest proprietors in New York.\r\nHe graduated at Yale, and in 1745 married Miss French “whose father had\r\nbeen a large proprietor of land in New Jersey.” He entered the practice\r\nof law in 1748 “and soon became a prominent member of the bar and\r\nemployed in most of the important legal controversies of that day in New\r\nYork and New Jersey.” He apparently accumulated a comfortable fortune,\r\nbut had lost a portion of it in 1773 by the failure of his debtors, and\r\nthe necessity of accepting depreciated continental currency.[283]\r\n\r\nWhether Livingston held any of the securities of the confederacy, it is\r\nimpossible apparently to determine, for his death in the summer of 1790,\r\nbefore the funding system went into effect, would have precluded his\r\nappearing on the Ledger records. It is probable, however, that he did\r\nnot entertain views in regard to the relation of public and private\r\naffairs different from those of his eminent colleagues. This theory will\r\nseem justified when it is understood that his son and heir, Brockholst\r\nLivingston, a New York lawyer, was among the heaviest security holders\r\nin that city; and in view of the wide-reaching ramifications of his\r\noperations and his connections with Le Roy and Bayard was reckoned among\r\nthe princely speculators of his day. One entry in 1791 credits him with\r\nabout $70,000 worth; another in the same year, in conjunction with Le\r\nRoy and Bayard, with nearly $30,000.[284] At a slightly later date, 1792\r\nand 1793, his 6 per cents alone amount to more than $100,000,[285] and\r\nhe appears frequently in the records of other states. How much of this\r\nwas his own paper and how much was for friends who did not wish to\r\nappear among the records cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n_James Madison_, of Virginia, was a descendant of one of the old landed\r\nfamilies of Virginia whose wealth consisted principally of plantations\r\nand slaves, and whose personal property was relatively small in amount.\r\nMadison’s father “was a large landed proprietor occupied mainly with the\r\ncare and management of his extensive rural concerns.” Madison graduated\r\nat Princeton and studied law, but the practice of his profession did not\r\nappeal to him. His inclinations were all toward politics, for which he\r\nwas prepared by long and profound researches in history, law, and\r\npolitical economy. He was constantly in public life, and seems to have\r\nrelied upon the emoluments of office and his father’s generosity as a\r\nsource of income. The postponement of his marriage until 1794 enabled\r\nhim to devote himself to political pursuits rather than commercial or\r\neconomic interests of any kind. He does not appear to have been a holder\r\nof public securities; for the small amounts credited to James Madison on\r\nthe books of the Treasury Department[286] seem to have belonged to his\r\nfather, also named James Madison.[287]\r\n\r\nHaving none of the public securities, Madison was able later to take a\r\nmore disinterested view of the funding system proposed by Hamilton; and\r\nthe scramble of politicians and speculators which accompanied the\r\nestablishment of the new government did more than anything else to\r\ndisgust him with the administration party and drive him into opposition.\r\nWriting to Jefferson in July, 1791, he said: “The subscriptions [to the\r\nBank] are consequently a mere scramble for so much public plunder, which\r\nwill be engrossed by those already loaded with the spoils of\r\nindividuals.... It pretty clearly appears, also, in what proportions the\r\npublic debt lies in the Country, what sort of hands hold it, and by whom\r\nthe people of the United States are to be governed. Of all the shameful\r\ncircumstances of this business, it is among the greatest to see the\r\nmembers of the legislature who were most active in pushing this job\r\nopenly grasping its emoluments. Schuyler is to be put at the head of the\r\nDirectors, if the weight of the New York subscribers can effect it.\r\nNothing new is talked of here. In fact, stock-jobbing drowns every other\r\nsubject. The Coffee-House is in an eternal buzz with the gamblers.”[288]\r\n\r\n_Alexander Martin_, of North Carolina, was a graduate of Princeton, and\r\npractised law. He was for a time governor of his state. Later he served\r\nin the United States Senate, and supported Adams and the alien and\r\nsedition laws; but was defeated for election in 1799.[289] Martin was\r\namong the well-to-do planters and slave-owners of his state;[290] but\r\nhis tastes do not seem to have turned to dealings in public securities,\r\nfor the Index to the holders of the public debt preserved in the\r\nTreasury Department does not contain his name, and a search among the\r\npapers of North Carolina fails to reveal any record of his transactions.\r\n\r\n_Luther Martin_, of Maryland, was a descendant of English ancestors who\r\nhad obtained “large grants of land in New Jersey [and] removed their\r\ndomestic establishment there when a greater part of the colonial domain\r\nwas a dense wilderness.” He was a graduate of Princeton and took up the\r\npractice of law. Being the third of nine children, and having little or\r\nno assistance from his parents, who were in pinched circumstances, he\r\nwas thrown upon his own resources. He commenced his career in Virginia\r\n“where he soon acquired a full and lucrative practice, amounting, as he\r\ninforms us, to about one thousand pounds per annum; which, however, was\r\nafter a period diminished by the disturbance growing out of the American\r\nRevolution.”[291]\r\n\r\nLuther Martin’s fortune was never very large, although he had among his\r\nclients men of great wealth and influence, like Robert Morris.[292] The\r\ncensus of 1790 records his owning only six slaves,[293] and his holdings\r\nof public securities were apparently meagre—a few thousand dollars at\r\nmost. One entry of sixes and threes on June 15, 1791, credits him with\r\n$1992.67, and he occasionally appears in other records.[294] He was\r\nalways more or less in sympathy with poor debtors, and was unwilling to\r\npreclude altogether the issue of paper money or moderate impairments of\r\ncontract. He was accordingly a bitter opponent of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution in his state.[295]\r\n\r\n_George Mason_, of Virginia, was born in 1725. He was the son of a rich\r\nslave owning and planting family of Dogue’s Neck, and on account of the\r\nearly death of his father he came into his vast estate on attaining his\r\nmajority.[296] His family fortunes were augmented by speculations in\r\nwestern lands. He married the daughter of a Maryland merchant, from whom\r\na large estate came into his family.[297] He was a member of the Ohio\r\nCompany which was organized in 1749, and obtained a grant of “six\r\nhundred thousand acres of land, lying mostly west of the mountains and\r\nsouth of the Ohio.”[298] In 1754 he also secured a patent for about\r\nfifteen hundred acres of land in Northern Neck.[299] He was constantly\r\nincreasing his holdings,[300] and in 1769 “he seems to have come into\r\npossession of two thousand acres of land in the district of\r\nKentucky.”[301] As a member of the Virginia legislature he drew a bill\r\n“to encourage the making of hemp, woollen, linen, and other\r\nmanufactures.”[302]\r\n\r\nHis property at the time of the establishment of the Constitution was\r\nunquestionably large, for at his death in 1792 “he devised to his sons\r\nalone, some fifteen thousand acres, the greater part of his own\r\nacquisition, of the very best land in the Potomac region. Most of these\r\nestates were well improved, with large and comfortable mansions and all\r\nnecessary outbuildings. But he left to be divided among his children\r\nwhat was solely acquired by himself: sixty thousand of among the finest\r\nacres in Kentucky, some three hundred slaves, more than fifty thousand\r\ndollars’ worth of other personal property, and at least thirty thousand\r\ndollars of debts due on his books, while his own indebtedness was\r\nabsolutely nothing.”[303] Very little of this personal property seems to\r\nhave been in public securities, for a search in the records of the\r\nTreasury Department shows one small entry of a few hundred dollars’\r\nworth of threes and sixes to his credit.[304]\r\n\r\nMason frankly admitted his personal interest in certain landed property\r\nto be among his many objections to the Constitution—which he refused to\r\napprove and the adoption of which he bitterly opposed. Speaking on the\r\ndangers from the supremacy of the federal courts, in the Virginia\r\nratifying convention, he said: “I am personally endangered as an\r\ninhabitant of Northern Neck. The people of that part will be obliged, by\r\nthe operation of this power, to pay the quit rent of their lands....\r\nLord Fairfax’s title was clear and undisputed. After the revolution we\r\ntaxed his lands as private property. After his death, an act of Assembly\r\nwas made, in 1782, to sequester the quit rents due, at his death, in the\r\nhands of his debtors. Next year an act was made restoring them to the\r\nexecutor of the proprietor. Subsequent to this, the treaty of peace was\r\nmade, by which it was agreed that there should be no further\r\nconfiscations. But after this an act of Assembly was passed,\r\nconfiscating his whole property. As Lord Fairfax’s title was\r\nindisputably good, and as treaties are to be the supreme law of the\r\nland, will not his representatives be able to recover all in the federal\r\ncourt? How will gentlemen like to pay an additional tax on lands in the\r\nNorthern Neck?”[305]\r\n\r\nMason proposed to limit the judicial power in such a manner that it\r\nshould “extend to no case where the cause of action shall have\r\noriginated before the ratification of this Constitution, except in suits\r\nfor debts due the United States, disputes between states about their\r\nterritory, and disputes between persons claiming lands under grants of\r\ndifferent states.” He expressed a fear that under the Constitution as it\r\nstood the titles to all the country between the Blue Ridge and Alleghany\r\nMountains would be upset in the federal courts and that the vast Indiana\r\npurchase would be rendered a subject of dispute.[306]\r\n\r\n_James McClurg_, of Virginia, was an accomplished man of letters and\r\ndistinguished physician of his native state. He was born there in 1747,\r\nstudied at the college of William and Mary, and finished his training in\r\nmedicine at Edinburgh and Paris. He established himself in the practice\r\nfirst at Williamsburg, and about 1783 he settled in Richmond, where he\r\ntook first rank as a physician, scholar, and man of the world.[307]\r\n\r\nMcClurg’s knowledge of government was not academic. He knew the subject\r\npractically, as well as theoretically; for as early as November 23,\r\n1790, he was engaged in operations in federal securities.[308] And on\r\nFebruary 17, 1791, he presented to the local loan office Virginia\r\ncertificates to the amount of $26,819, all of which, except a few\r\nhundred pounds originally subscribed by himself, he had evidently bought\r\nfor speculation.[309] McClurg was also an investor in stock in the first\r\nUnited States Bank and one of the directors.[310]\r\n\r\n_James McHenry_, of Maryland, received a classical education in Ireland,\r\nthe country of his birth, and came to Baltimore in 1771. He studied\r\nmedicine with Dr. Benjamin Rush at Philadelphia and became an army\r\nsurgeon during the War. He was for a time secretary to Washington and\r\nlater to Lafayette, and from 1783 to 1786 he was a member of Congress\r\nfrom Maryland.[311]\r\n\r\nMcHenry was the son of Daniel McHenry, a Baltimore merchant, who\r\nachieved “considerable financial success”[312] and was in business with\r\nhis son, John, a brother of James, until his death in 1782. John and\r\nJames began buying town property, and when the former died in 1790, the\r\nlatter inherited the entire estate, as John had never married. The death\r\nof James’ father, says Steiner, left him financially independent.\r\n\r\nMcHenry’s personal property must have been considerable. A casual letter\r\nof August 4, 1792, shows that one Dickinson owed him an amount secured\r\nby a bond for £5000.[313] He was one of the original stockholders of the\r\nInsurance Company of North America organized in 1792.[314] It is not\r\napparent that he was among the original holders of federal securities,\r\nbut an entry in 1797 records an old account to the amount of $6970.90,\r\nbrought forward.[315]\r\n\r\nMcHenry’s early mercantile interests left a deep impression on him, and\r\nhe sympathized with the efforts made in his state to secure an adequate\r\nprotective tariff. Indeed, he was among the signers of the memorial from\r\nBaltimore laid before Congress on April 11, 1789, praying for the\r\nprotection and encouragement of American manufactures.[316]\r\n\r\n_John Francis Mercer_, of Maryland, was born in Virginia and graduated\r\nat William and Mary College in 1775. He served in the army and after the\r\nwar studied law with Jefferson. He moved to Maryland in 1786. He seems\r\nto have been a man of some fortune, for he held six slaves,[317] and a\r\nmoderate amount of public securities.[318] His sympathies, however, were\r\nwith the popular party in Maryland. He joined with Luther Martin in\r\nviolent opposition to the adoption of the Constitution. In 1801 he was\r\nelected governor of the state, and as governor he attacked the property\r\nqualifications on voters under the constitution of the commonwealth, at\r\nlength securing the repeal of the provisions.\r\n\r\n_Thomas Mifflin_, of Pennsylvania, was born in Philadelphia in 1744 and\r\ngraduated at the College of Philadelphia, where he distinguished himself\r\nas a student of the classics. His father introduced him to a mercantile\r\nlife by placing him in the counting house of William Coleman, one of the\r\nmost eminent merchants of his native city. “When he was twenty-one years\r\nof age he visited Europe to improve his knowledge of commercial affairs,\r\nand after his return home he entered into business with his brother, the\r\nconnection continuing until after the Revolution.”[319]\r\n\r\nMifflin was deeply interested in the protection of American\r\nmanufactures. He was prominently identified with the Philadelphia\r\nSociety for the Encouragement of Manufactures and Useful Arts, organized\r\nin the summer of 1787. In fact, he presided at the meeting at which it\r\nwas established in August of that year, during the sessions of the\r\nConvention.[320]\r\n\r\nGeneral Mifflin was a holder of public securities, but it does not\r\nappear that his paper aggregated more than a petty sum. He and Jonathan\r\nMifflin are down for a few hundred dollars’ worth of continental paper\r\nin 1788;[321] and he held in his own name another small account in\r\n1791.[322] It is, therefore, apparent that General Mifflin appreciated\r\nthe position of the powerful class of security holders who looked to the\r\nConvention for relief, and had a more than abstract interest in the\r\nestablishment of public credit.\r\n\r\n_Gouverneur Morris_, of Pennsylvania, was born in 1752 at the family\r\nmanor house at Morrisania. He “belonged by birth to that powerful landed\r\naristocracy whose rule was known by New York alone among all the\r\nnorthern colonies.” He graduated at King’s College, entered the practice\r\nof law, and very soon began to take a hand in colonial politics,\r\nattacking with great vehemence the propositions of the paper money\r\nparty. “He criticised unsparingly the attitude of a majority of his\r\nfellow-citizens in wishing such a measure of relief, not only for their\r\nshort-sighted folly, but also for their criminal and selfish dishonesty\r\nin trying to procure a temporary benefit for themselves at the lasting\r\nexpense of the community.”[323]\r\n\r\nHe was a member of the Continental Congress and was regarded as a\r\nconsiderable expert in financial affairs. He assisted Robert Morris in\r\nthe establishment of the Bank of North America, and seems to have been\r\nable, in the midst of his public engagements, to augment his private\r\nfortunes and to engage in divers economic enterprises. At the time of\r\nthe formation of the Constitution, he had accumulated enough to purchase\r\nthe family estate from his elder brother, and “he had for some time been\r\nengaged in various successful commercial ventures with his friend Robert\r\nMorris, including an East India voyage on a large scale, shipments of\r\ntobacco to France, and a share in iron works on the Delaware river, and\r\nhad become quite a rich man.”[324] He declared in the Convention that he\r\ndid not hold any public securities, and the records seem to bear out his\r\nassertion, although his name does appear on an index to a volume of\r\nTreasury Records not found.\r\n\r\nOf all the members of the Convention, _Robert Morris_ of Pennsylvania,\r\nhad the most widely diversified economic interests. He was born of\r\nhumble parents in Liverpool in 1734, and came to America at an early\r\nage. The death of his father, about 1750, left him a small estate of a\r\nfew thousand dollars, which stood him in good stead in his relations\r\nwith the Willings, whose counting house he had entered to learn\r\nmercantile arts, in which he showed an early proficiency.[325]\r\n\r\nIn the course of his long career he owned and directed ships trading\r\nwith the East and West Indies, engaged in iron and several other\r\nbranches of manufacturing, bought and sold thousands of acres of land in\r\nall parts of the country, particularly in the west and south, and\r\nspeculated in lots in Washington as soon as he learned of the\r\nestablishment of the capital there. He was instrumental in organizing\r\nthe Bank of North America in Philadelphia, with Thomas Willing, his\r\npartner, as first President, and Thomas Fitzsimons, an associate in his\r\nland and speculative enterprises, as one of the directors,[326] and was\r\nin short a merchant prince, a captain of industry, a land speculator, a\r\nfinancier, and a broker combined.[327] Had he been less ambitious he\r\nwould have died worth millions instead of in poverty and debt, after\r\nhaving served a term in a debtor’s cell.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to gauge correctly the extent of his land speculations,\r\nfor they ran into the millions of acres. Before and after the adoption\r\nof the Constitution, he was busy interesting his colleagues in every\r\nkind of enterprise that promised to be profitable. James Marshall, a\r\nbrother of John Marshall, was his chief agent, and carried on operations\r\nfor him in the United States and Europe. Marshall was given the power of\r\nattorney by Morris and his wife to sell enormous quantities of lands and\r\nother properties, and received from his principal letters of\r\nintroduction to European capitalists and persons of prominence,\r\nincluding Mr. Pinckney, the representative of the United States in\r\nFrance.[328]\r\n\r\nThe exact extent of Morris’ speculations in the securities of the new\r\ngovernment is a matter beyond the scope of the present inquiry, but it\r\nis sufficient for our purposes to know that he held practically every\r\nkind of continental security, that his deals in stocks mounted upward\r\ninto the tens of thousands of dollars,[329] and that in the Convention\r\nand in the first Senate under the Constitution, of which he was a\r\nmember, he was uniformly strenuous in his support of public credit. No\r\nman of his time had such wide-reaching interests or involved in his\r\npersonal affairs so many eminent men, like Hamilton, John Marshall,\r\nThomas Fitzsimons, Thomas Willing, Gouverneur Morris, John Langdon, and\r\nRobert Clymer, all closely identified with the new system of government.\r\n\r\nIt may be truly said therefore that Morris was an effective\r\nrepresentative of the speculative land operators, the holders of\r\nsecurities, the dealers in public paper, and the mercantile groups\r\nseeking protection for manufactures—in short every movable property\r\ninterest in the country. It was fortunate for the new government to have\r\nin its support a man whose economic power and personal acquaintanceship\r\nextended from New Hampshire to Georgia. It seems fair to say that no man\r\ncontributed more to the establishment of our Constitution and the\r\nstability of our national institutions than Robert Morris, “the Patriot\r\nFinancier.”\r\n\r\nWashington, therefore, showed his acumen when, as first President of the\r\nUnited States, he selected Morris for the office of Secretary of the\r\nTreasury; but the latter, on account of the pressing nature of his\r\nprivate business, was unable to accept the post thus tendered. Indeed,\r\nhe wisely concluded that he could be more serviceable to the new\r\ngovernment in his capacity as senator from Pennsylvania; and in this\r\nposition he lent his powerful support to the funding system, the new\r\nBank, and the establishment of a protective tariff. “Morris and Hamilton\r\ntogether worked out a tariff bill,” says Oberholtzer.[330] “But for the\r\ninfluence of the Senator from Pennsylvania the measure, important\r\nbecause it would provide the national government with ample revenues,\r\nand because it had protective features of utility in the development of\r\nthe country industries, could not have passed Congress in the form which\r\nwould have commended it to the Secretary of the Treasury.... All\r\nwitnesses agree that Robert Morris was a stupendous political force in\r\nWashington’s administration, and his influence did not decrease when, in\r\nDecember, 1790, the capital was removed to Philadelphia, where he\r\nresumed his princely entertainment of public men, surrendering his home\r\non Market Street to Washington, and becoming the President’s most\r\nintimate friend and closest companion.”\r\n\r\n_William Paterson_ was born in the north of Ireland, came to this\r\ncountry in 1747, graduated at Princeton in 1763, and received his\r\nlicense to practise law in 1769. His father was a merchant, and he was\r\nhimself for a time engaged in the mercantile business.[331] A by no\r\nmeans extensive search has failed to bring out any of Paterson’s later\r\neconomic interests.\r\n\r\n_William Pierce_, of Georgia, does not seem to have made any\r\nconsiderable impression on his age, for the biographical material\r\nrelating to him is meagre indeed. His economic interests do not appear\r\nto have been looked into, although it is known that he was “in business\r\nin Savannah as the head of the house of William Pierce and\r\nCompany.”[332] His private fortune was probably not large, for he\r\napplied to Madison in 1788 for a position as collector in his\r\ndistrict.[333]\r\n\r\n_Charles Cotesworth Pinckney_ was the son of “Chief Justice Pinckney, a\r\nman of great integrity and of considerable eminence under the Provincial\r\nGovernment.” He received a fine classical and legal education in\r\nEngland. He began the practice of law in the provincial courts in 1770,\r\nand very soon “began to acquire business and reputation.” After the\r\nRevolutionary war “his business was large and its profits\r\ncommensurate—reaching in one year the amount of four thousand guineas, a\r\nconsiderable sum for that day.” He became “a considerable landholder in\r\nthe city of Charleston. He had numerous tenants living on his\r\nproperty.... His benevolence was of the most enlarged character, and was\r\nexperienced not only by the poor and such as were dependent on him, but\r\nin his liberal support of churches, seminaries of learning, and every\r\nobject of public utility.”[334] He also held a country estate at\r\nPinckney Island, and is recorded in the first census as the owner of\r\nforty-five slaves.[335]\r\n\r\nPinckney had a large practice for the merchants of Charleston, and his\r\nknowledge of maritime law must have been extensive.[336] Through this\r\ndirect experience, he must have learned the importance of a national\r\ncommercial system, not only to merchants and manufacturers, but also to\r\nthose having occasion to appear in the courts. In the midst of the local\r\nconflict between the creditors and debtors, he took a firm stand against\r\nany weakening of public and private credit.\r\n\r\nThe significance and importance of the public credit he understood from\r\nfirst-hand knowledge, for his holdings of public securities were large\r\nwhen compared with the average holdings in the South. Shortly after the\r\nestablishment of Hamilton’s funding system, Pinckney is credited with\r\nover ten thousand dollars’ worth of sixes and threes on the loan office\r\nbooks of his state.[337]\r\n\r\n_Charles Pinckney_, like his distinguished cousin, was also an eminent\r\nlawyer in Charleston and enjoyed a large practice with the merchants. He\r\nwas likewise a land-owner on a considerable scale, for the census of\r\n1790 records the number of his slaves as fifty-two.[338]\r\n\r\nCharles Pinckney was also identified with the conservative forces of the\r\nstate in their fight against the debtor or paper money party, and he\r\nthoroughly understood the meaning of the sacredness of private and\r\npublic obligations. He was a holder of government securities on a large\r\nscale, his transactions early in the history of the new system amounting\r\nto more than fourteen thousand dollars.[339] In common with the men of\r\nhis party he naturally feared the effect of popular lawmaking upon the\r\nvalue of personalty.[340]\r\n\r\n_Edmund Randolph_ was a grandson of Sir John Randolph, an English\r\ngentleman of ancient and honorable lineage. Through an uncle he\r\ninherited “three farms ... negroes, and other property;” but this estate\r\nwas burdened with debt.[341] As a lawyer, however, he enjoyed a\r\nmagnificent practice which furnished him a considerable revenue. When\r\ncharged with having defrauded the Treasury of the United States during\r\nhis official service as Secretary of State, he advanced as a counter\r\nclaim the fact that the condition of his fortune was evidence that he\r\ncould not have engrossed any large government funds. He reported on that\r\noccasion (1801) that in money claims he had £14,200 Virginia currency\r\nwhich he traced “to the best of all resources, the independent labors of\r\nmy own hands.”[342] About that time, his other property which had come\r\nto him by way of inheritance amounted to “some seven thousand acres of\r\nland, several houses, and near two hundred negroes. The slaves had long\r\nbeen an incumbrance on account of his refusal to sell their increase and\r\nhis inability while at Philadelphia to hire them properly.”[343]\r\n\r\nIndeed, Randolph was apparently never very prosperous. He held ten or\r\nfifteen thousand dollars’ worth of public securities about the time of\r\nthe establishment of the new government;[344] but he seems to have been\r\nin debt to Hamilton for a considerable sum that gave him some\r\nembarrassment. On April 23, 1793, he wrote to Hamilton asking an\r\nextension of time on the paper, saying: “I am extremely thankful to you\r\nfor your readiness to accommodate me on the subject of the bills.... The\r\nsum which I want to sell is much less than £2600 stg. It is only £1300;\r\nas I prefer waiting for a rise....”[345]\r\n\r\n_George Read_, of Delaware, was the grandson of a “wealthy citizen of\r\nDublin.” His father had migrated to America and established himself as\r\n“a respectable planter” in Delaware. George studied law under John\r\nMoland, a distinguished attorney in Philadelphia, and began business for\r\nhimself in Newcastle in 1754 where he soon acquired a lucrative\r\npractice.[346] Although he surrendered all claim to his father’s estate\r\non the ground that he had received his portion in his education,[347]\r\nRead managed to accumulate a modest competence.\r\n\r\nOf his economic position, so far as it was reflected in his style of\r\nliving, a descendant writes: “The mansion of Mr. Read commanded an\r\nextensive view of the river Delaware.... It was an old-fashioned brick\r\nstructure, looking very comfortable but with no pretensions to\r\nelegance.... Here Mr. Read resided for many years in the style of the\r\ncolonial gentry who, when having no more than the moderate income of Mr.\r\nRead, maintained a state and etiquette which have long disappeared....\r\nHow could this be, Mr. Read not being affluent? His income would buy\r\nmore then than now, and he had a small farm ... and besides he generally\r\nowned his servants.” In addition to his income from official positions\r\nand his practice, Read possessed some capital for investment, because he\r\nappears among the subscribers to the stock of the Bank of North America\r\nissued in 1784.[348]\r\n\r\nA small part of his worldly goods he had invested in the securities of\r\nthe Continental Congress in 1779, during the dark days of the Revolution\r\nwhen the chances of ever recovering it were slight indeed. He was among\r\nthose who risked their lives and fortunes in the Revolutionary cause,\r\nand has the honor of being one of the signers of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. The loan office of Delaware records that in March and\r\nApril, 1779, Read subscribed for $2000 worth of certificates, and that\r\nMary Read subscribed for $11,500 worth of the same paper.[349] The\r\nincompleteness of the records of Delaware in the Treasury department\r\nprevents the tracing of these securities, but an entry of 1797 shows\r\nRead as holding a small account (old) of threes.[350] At all events,\r\nRead had felt personally the inconveniences of depreciated paper, and\r\nknew the value of a stable government to every owner of personal\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n_John Rutledge_, of South Carolina, was the son of Dr. John Rutledge, a\r\nnative of Ireland who settled in Carolina about 1735. He was educated\r\nunder a classical tutor and pursued the study of law in the Temple. He\r\nopened his practice in Charleston in 1761, and a biographer relates that\r\n“instead of rising by degrees to the head of his profession, he burst\r\nforth at once the able lawyer and accomplished scholar. Business flowed\r\nin upon him. He was employed in the most difficult causes and retained\r\nwith the largest fees that were usually given.”[351]\r\n\r\nRutledge was elected president of South Carolina, under the first\r\nconstitution, and when a new frame of government was made by the\r\nlegislature, in some respects more democratic, he vetoed it, preferring\r\n“a compound or mixed government to a simple democracy, or one verging\r\ntowards it.”[352] “However unexceptionable democratic power may appear\r\nat first view,” said Rutledge, “its defects have been found arbitrary,\r\nsevere, and destructive.”\r\n\r\nHe resigned because he was unable to prevent the adoption of the new\r\nconstitution; but he was soon elected governor under it; and inasmuch as\r\nit provided that no person could be governor unless he held in his own\r\nright, on his election, “a settled plantation or freehold ... of the\r\nvalue of at least ten thousand pounds currency, clear of debt,” it must\r\nbe assumed that Rutledge was the owner of a considerable plantation and\r\na number of slaves. Indeed, the census of 1790 records the number at\r\ntwenty-six, which, though small, was considerable for a man whose\r\ninterests were not primarily in planting.[353] Unlike his other\r\ncolleagues from South Carolina, John Rutledge does not seem to have\r\ninvested in securities, though several members of the Rutledge family\r\nappear on the records.\r\n\r\n_Roger Sherman_, the shoemaker of New Milford,[354] Connecticut, was one\r\nof the very few men of the Convention who had risen from poverty to\r\naffluence largely through his own efforts, and had none of the\r\nadvantages of education and support which a family patrimony can give.\r\nBut as his biographer remarks of him: “In regard to worldly\r\ncircumstances, Mr. Sherman was very happily situated. Beginning life\r\nwithout the aid of patrimonial wealth or powerful connections, with\r\nnothing but his good sense and good principles, he, by his industry and\r\nskilful management, always lived in a comfortable manner, and his\r\nproperty was gradually increasing.”[355]\r\n\r\nIn common with other far-seeing business men of his day, Sherman seems\r\nto have invested a portion of his accumulations in public securities,\r\nfor shortly after Hamilton’s fiscal system went into effect he funded\r\nnearly eight thousand dollars’ worth of paper at the loan office of his\r\nnative state.[356]\r\n\r\n_Richard Dobbs Spaight_, of North Carolina, was of respectable origin.\r\nHis father had been secretary of the colony under the crown, and his\r\nmother was a sister of Dobbs, a royal governor of the colony. He came\r\ninto his father’s estate early; he studied in Ireland, and finished his\r\neducation at the University of Glasgow. At the time of the Convention,\r\nhe was, according to Pierce, a “worthy man, of some abilities, and\r\nfortune.”[357] He was among the large planters of his state, and is\r\nrecorded to have held seventy-one slaves.[358] He seems to have taken no\r\nshare in the public security transactions. At least a search in the\r\nincomplete records does not reveal him as an original holder—but an old\r\naccount of 3 per cents for the sum of a few dollars, shows that he was\r\nnot unaware of the relations of public credit to stable\r\ninstitutions.[359] It was largely through his influence that Washington\r\nwent to North Carolina to aid in the fight for the adoption of the\r\nConstitution by that state.\r\n\r\n_Caleb Strong_, of Massachusetts, was the descendant of an old and\r\nhonorable family of Northampton, the place of his birth. He was educated\r\nat Harvard and entered the practice of law.[360] He early began a public\r\ncareer for which he showed remarkable aptitudes, and was rewarded by\r\nelection to the convention which drafted the constitution of his state,\r\nto the federal Convention, to the first United States Senate, and later\r\nto the office of governor of the commonwealth. Whether he inherited a\r\nfortune or accumulated considerable wealth in the practice of law is not\r\nrecorded by his biographer, Senator Lodge,[361] but he took advantage of\r\nhis superior knowledge of public affairs, and bought up £3271:0:6 worth\r\nof certificates of issues up to May, 1787, which he funded into federal\r\nsecurities in September, 1791.[362]\r\n\r\n_Washington_, of Virginia, was probably the richest man in the United\r\nStates in his time, and his financial ability was not surpassed among\r\nhis countrymen anywhere. He possessed, in addition to his great estate\r\non the Potomac, a large amount of fluid capital which he judiciously\r\ninvested in western lands, from which he could reasonably expect a large\r\nappreciation with the establishment of stable government and the advance\r\nof the frontier.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best way to illustrate his economic interests is to give the\r\ndata from the schedule of his property attached to his will, drawn up in\r\n1799. He possessed in Virginia, counting the enormous holdings on the\r\nOhio, and the Great Kenhawa, more than 35,000 acres, valued at $200,000;\r\nin Maryland, 1119 acres, at $9828; in Pennsylvania, 234 acres, at $1404;\r\nin New York, about 1000 acres, at $6000; in the Northwest Territory,\r\n3051 acres, at $15,255; in Kentucky, 5000 acres, at $10,000; property in\r\nWashington, at $19,132; in Alexandria, at $4000; in Winchester, at $400;\r\nat Bath, $800. He held $6246 worth of United States securities; and of\r\nthis holding he said: “These are the sums which are actually funded; and\r\nthough no more in the aggregate than 7566 dollars, stand me in at least\r\nten thousand pounds, Virginia money; being the amount of bonded and\r\nother debts due me and discharged during the war when money had\r\ndepreciated in that rate—and was so settled by the public authority.” He\r\nheld $10,666 worth of shares in the Potomac Company presented to him by\r\nthe state of Virginia (which he left to establish a national\r\nuniversity); $500 worth of James River Company shares; $6800 worth of\r\nstock in the Bank of Columbia, and $1000 worth of stock in the Bank of\r\nAlexandria. His own slaves were to be emancipated on the death of his\r\nwife. His live-stock he estimated at $15,653—making a grand total at a\r\nconservative estimate of $530,000.[363]\r\n\r\nWashington was also a considerable money lender and suffered from the\r\npaper money operations of the Virginia legislature. He “had bonds and\r\nmortgages to ‘nigh £10,000’ paid off in depreciated paper currency worth\r\nat times as little as 2/6 in the pound, and when he attended the federal\r\nConvention he was in arrears for two years’ taxes through having been\r\nunable to sell the products of his farms.”[364]\r\n\r\nIf any one in the country had a just reason for being disgusted with the\r\nimbecilities of the Confederation it was Washington. He had given the\r\nbest years of life to the Revolutionary cause, and had refused all\r\nremuneration for his great services. He was paid his personal expenses\r\nto the amount of $64,355.30 in paper that steadily depreciated. M. Otto\r\nwriting to Vergennes on February 10, 1787, says of Washington’s losses:\r\n“I have before me a letter of this honored man in which he complains of\r\nbeing obliged to sell at a rate of twenty for one the certificates which\r\nCongress sent to him in payment for the arrearages due him.”[365]\r\n\r\n_Hugh Williamson_, of North Carolina, was the son of “an industrious\r\ntradesman” of Dublin, who settled in America about 1730—five years\r\nbefore Hugh was born. The latter received a fine education and graduated\r\nat the College of Philadelphia in 1757. About this time his father died,\r\nleaving him sole executor of the estate, the settlement of which\r\nrequired the greater part of two years.[366] He studied divinity, but\r\nlater turned to medicine and went to Edinburgh to pursue his studies in\r\nthat subject. He practised for a time in Philadelphia, but afterward\r\nwent South to reside.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War he engaged in mercantile speculations in\r\nCharleston and later at Edenton, “from which he afterward traded to the\r\nneutral islands in the West Indies.” While continuing his mercantile\r\nconnections with his brother, “then also engaged in the West India\r\ntrade, he determined to resume the practice of medicine; this he did\r\nwith the same success as he had done formerly at Philadelphia.” He was\r\nan opponent of the emission of paper money in North Carolina and\r\npublished an essay against fiat currency.\r\n\r\nHe happily combined a theoretical and practical knowledge of finance,\r\nfor he seems to have accumulated a large amount of public securities. He\r\nappears frequently on the records of the Treasury Department; for\r\nexample in December, 1791, for $2444.84 worth of sixes and threes.[367]\r\nFurthermore, his correspondence with Hamilton and others shows that he\r\nhad “the smallest of two large trunks” full of 6 per cents, threes, and\r\ndeferred stock which he had delivered to Hamilton for transfer to the\r\nNew York loan office, in 1793.[368]\r\n\r\nWilliamson also engaged in western land speculations, and was not\r\nunaware of the advantage to that class of property which the new\r\nConstitution afforded. On June 2, 1788, he wrote to Madison from New\r\nYork, “For myself, I conceive that my opinions are not biassed by\r\nprivate interests, but having claims to a considerable quantity of land\r\nin the Western Country, I am fully persuaded that the value of those\r\nlands must be increased by an efficient federal government.”[369] After\r\nhis long and assiduous public services, Williamson settled in New York,\r\nwhere he engaged in historical writing and the management of the\r\nconsiderable fortune which he had accumulated in the midst of his\r\npressing public duties.[370]\r\n\r\n_James Wilson_, of Pennsylvania, was born in Scotland in 1742 and\r\nreceived a fine classical education there. He came to America in 1766,\r\nbegan the study of law with John Dickinson, and was admitted to the bar\r\nin 1767. He developed a lucrative practice at Carlisle, where he first\r\nsettled; but in 1778 he removed to Philadelphia where he established a\r\nclose connection with the leading merchants and men of affairs including\r\nRobert Morris, George Clymer, and General Mifflin.[371] He was one of\r\nthe directors of the Bank of North America on its incorporation in\r\n1781;[372] and he also appears among the original stockholders of the\r\nInsurance Company of North America, organized in 1792.[373]\r\n\r\nWilson’s largest interest seems to have been in public lands, for he was\r\namong the members of the Georgia Land Company, a highly speculative\r\nconcern tainted with fraud, to put it mildly, for ten shares, £25,000\r\ncash and 750,000 acres.[374] Haskins says, “James Wilson, of the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, held shares to the amount of at least one\r\nmillion acres and it is asserted was influential in securing the\r\ngrants.”[375]\r\n\r\nWilson does not appear to have been a large holder of public securities;\r\nfor a search in the records of the Pennsylvania loan office preserved in\r\nthe Department of the Treasury reveals only a trivial amount of 3 per\r\ncents to his credit, on June 2, 1791.[376] It may be that the extent of\r\nhis other operations prevented his taking advantage of the opportunities\r\noffered in this line.\r\n\r\n_George Wythe_, of Virginia, was born in 1726 on the shores of the\r\nChesapeake in the colony of Virginia. “He was descended from a\r\nrespectable family and inherited from his father, who was a farmer, an\r\nestate amply sufficient for all the purposes of ease and independence,\r\nalthough it was seriously impaired by the Revolution.” He studied law,\r\nand “by reason of his extensive learning, correctness of elocution, and\r\nhis logical style of argument, he quickly arrived at the head of the\r\nbar.”[377] His second wife “was a lady of a wealthy and respectable\r\nfamily of Taliafero, residing near Williamsburg.” He was a slave-owner,\r\nbut he emancipated his slaves and made provisions to keep them from\r\nwant. His public security holding was not large. On March 12, 1791, he\r\npresented Virginia certificates to the amount of £513:2:8 which he had\r\nacquired from their original owners.[378]\r\n\r\n_Robert Yates_, of New York, was born in Schenectady, and received a\r\nclassical education at New York City. He read law and began the practice\r\nat Albany where he soon built up an extensive business. He was made a\r\njudge of the Supreme Court under the state constitution of 1777, but his\r\nsalary was small. “Indeed before the scale of depreciation of\r\ncontinental money had been settled, he received one year’s salary in\r\nthat money at its _nominal_ value, the whole of which was just\r\nsufficient (as he humorously observed) ‘to purchase a pound of green tea\r\nfor his wife.’” He refused to enrich himself by speculating in\r\nconfiscated estates, a favorite occupation of some of his friends, and\r\n“he died poor.”[379] He opposed the adoption of the Constitution, and\r\napparently took no part in the transactions in public securities; but\r\nseveral members of the Yates family, Richard, Adolphus, and Christopher\r\nwere large operators.[380]\r\n\r\n\r\nA survey of the economic interests of the members of the Convention\r\npresents certain conclusions:\r\n\r\nA majority of the members were lawyers by profession.\r\n\r\nMost of the members came from towns, on or near the coast, that is, from\r\nthe regions in which personalty was largely concentrated.\r\n\r\nNot one member represented in his immediate personal economic interests\r\nthe small farming or mechanic classes.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of members, at least five-sixths, were\r\nimmediately, directly, and personally interested in the outcome of their\r\nlabors at Philadelphia, and were to a greater or less extent economic\r\nbeneficiaries from the adoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n1. Public security interests were extensively represented in the\r\nConvention.[381] Of the fifty-five members who attended no less than\r\nforty appear on the Records of the Treasury Department for sums varying\r\nfrom a few dollars up to more than one hundred thousand dollars. Among\r\nthe minor holders were Bassett, Blount, Brearley, Broom, Butler,\r\nCarroll, Few, Hamilton, L. Martin, Mason, Mercer, Mifflin, Read,\r\nSpaight, Wilson, and Wythe. Among the larger holders (taking the sum of\r\nabout $5000 as the criterion) were Baldwin, Blair, Clymer, Dayton,\r\nEllsworth, Fitzsimons, Gilman, Gerry, Gorham, Jenifer, Johnson, King,\r\nLangdon, Lansing, Livingston,[382] McClurg, R. Morris, C. C. Pinckney,\r\nC. Pinckney, Randolph, Sherman, Strong, Washington, and Williamson.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that, with the exception of New York, and\r\npossibly Delaware, each state had one or more prominent representatives\r\nin the Convention who held more than a negligible amount of securities,\r\nand who could therefore speak with feeling and authority on the question\r\nof providing in the new Constitution for the full discharge of the\r\npublic debt:\r\n\r\n    Langdon and Gilman, of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n    Gerry, Strong, and King, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n    Ellsworth, Sherman, and Johnson, of Connecticut.\r\n\r\n    Hamilton, of New York. Although he held no large amount personally,\r\nhe was the special pleader for the holders of public securities and the\r\nmaintenance of public faith.\r\n\r\n    Dayton, of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n    Robert Morris, Clymer, and Fitzsimons, of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n    Mercer and Carroll, of Maryland.\r\n\r\n    Blair, McClurg, and Randolph, of Virginia.\r\n\r\n    Williamson, of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n    The two Pinckneys, of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n    Few and Baldwin, of Georgia.\r\n\r\n2. Personalty invested in lands for speculation was represented by at\r\nleast fourteen members: Blount, Dayton, Few, Fitzsimons, Franklin,\r\nGilman, Gerry, Gorham, Hamilton, Mason, R. Morris, Washington,\r\nWilliamson, and Wilson.\r\n\r\n3. Personalty in the form of money loaned at interest was represented by\r\nat least twenty-four members: Bassett, Broom, Butler, Carroll, Clymer,\r\nDavie, Dickinson, Ellsworth, Few, Fitzsimons, Franklin, Gilman,\r\nIngersoll, Johnson, King, Langdon, Mason, McHenry, C. C. Pinckney, C.\r\nPinckney, Randolph, Read, Washington, and Williamson.\r\n\r\n4. Personalty in mercantile, manufacturing, and shipping lines was\r\nrepresented by at least eleven members: Broom, Clymer, Ellsworth,\r\nFitzsimons, Gerry, King, Langdon, McHenry, Mifflin, G. Morris, and R.\r\nMorris.\r\n\r\n5. Personalty in slaves was represented by at least fifteen members:\r\nButler, Davie, Jenifer, A. Martin, L. Martin, Mason, Mercer, C. C.\r\nPinckney, C. Pinckney, Randolph, Read, Rutledge, Spaight, Washington,\r\nand Wythe.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said, therefore, that the members of the Convention were\r\n“disinterested.” On the contrary, we are forced to accept the profoundly\r\nsignificant conclusion that they knew through their personal experiences\r\nin economic affairs the precise results which the new government that\r\nthey were setting up was designed to attain. As a group of doctrinaires,\r\nlike the Frankfort assembly of 1848, they would have failed miserably;\r\nbut as practical men they were able to build the new government upon the\r\nonly foundations which could be stable: fundamental economic\r\ninterests.[383]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                THE CONSTITUTION AS AN ECONOMIC DOCUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for the superficial student of the Constitution, who has\r\nread only the commentaries of the legists, to conceive of that\r\ninstrument as an economic document. It places no property qualifications\r\non voters or officers; it gives no outward recognition of any economic\r\ngroups in society; it mentions no special privileges to be conferred\r\nupon any class. It betrays no feeling, such as vibrates through the\r\nFrench constitution of 1791; its language is cold, formal, and severe.\r\n\r\nThe true inwardness of the Constitution is not revealed by an\r\nexamination of its provisions as simple propositions of law; but by a\r\nlong and careful study of the voluminous correspondence of the\r\nperiod,[384] contemporary newspapers and pamphlets, the records of the\r\ndebates in the Convention at Philadelphia and in the several state\r\nconventions, and particularly, _The Federalist_, which was widely\r\ncirculated during the struggle over ratification. The correspondence\r\nshows the exact character of the evils which the Constitution was\r\nintended to remedy; the records of the proceedings in the Philadelphia\r\nConvention reveal the successive steps in the building of the framework\r\nof the government under the pressure of economic interests; the\r\npamphlets and newspapers disclose the ideas of the contestants over the\r\nratification; and _The Federalist_ presents the political science of the\r\nnew system as conceived by three of the profoundest thinkers of the\r\nperiod, Hamilton, Madison, and Jay.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, the most illuminating of these sources on the economic\r\ncharacter of the Constitution are the records of the debates in the\r\nConvention, which have come down to us in fragmentary form; and a\r\nthorough treatment of material forces reflected in the several clauses\r\nof the instrument of government created by the grave assembly at\r\nPhiladelphia would require a rewriting of the history of the proceedings\r\nin the light of the great interests represented there.[385] But an\r\nentire volume would scarcely suffice to present the results of such a\r\nsurvey, and an undertaking of this character is accordingly impossible\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n_The Federalist_, on the other hand, presents in a relatively brief and\r\nsystematic form an economic interpretation of the Constitution by the\r\nmen best fitted, through an intimate knowledge of the ideals of the\r\nframers, to expound the political science of the new government. This\r\nwonderful piece of argumentation by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay is in\r\nfact the finest study in the economic interpretation of politics which\r\nexists in any language; and whoever would understand the Constitution as\r\nan economic document need hardly go beyond it. It is true that the tone\r\nof the writers is somewhat modified on account of the fact that they are\r\nappealing to the voters to ratify the Constitution, but at the same time\r\nthey are, by the force of circumstances, compelled to convince large\r\neconomic groups that safety and strength lie in the adoption of the new\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIndeed, every fundamental appeal in it is to some material and\r\nsubstantial interest. Sometimes it is to the people at large in the name\r\nof protection against invading armies and European coalitions. Sometimes\r\nit is to the commercial classes whose business is represented as\r\nprostrate before the follies of the Confederation. Now it is to\r\ncreditors seeking relief against paper money and the assaults of the\r\nagrarians in general; now it is to the holders of federal securities\r\nwhich are depreciating toward the vanishing point. But above all, it is\r\nto the owners of personalty anxious to find a foil against the attacks\r\nof levelling democracy, that the authors of _The Federalist_ address\r\ntheir most cogent arguments in favor of ratification. It is true there\r\nis much discussion of the details of the new framework of government, to\r\nwhich even some friends of reform took exceptions; but Madison and\r\nHamilton both knew that these were incidental matters when compared with\r\nthe sound basis upon which the superstructure rested.\r\n\r\nIn reading the pages of this remarkable work as a study in political\r\neconomy, it is important to bear in mind that the system, which the\r\nauthors are describing, consisted of two fundamental parts—one positive,\r\nthe other negative:\r\n\r\nI. A government endowed with certain positive powers, but so constructed\r\nas to break the force of majority rule and prevent invasions of the\r\nproperty rights of minorities.\r\n\r\nII. Restrictions on the state legislatures which had been so vigorous in\r\ntheir attacks on capital.\r\n\r\nUnder some circumstances, action is the immediate interest of the\r\ndominant party; and whenever it desires to make an economic gain through\r\ngovernmental functioning, it must have, of course, a system endowed with\r\nthe requisite powers.\r\n\r\nExamples of this are to be found in protective tariffs, in ship\r\nsubsidies, in railway land grants, in river and harbor improvements, and\r\nso on through the catalogue of so-called “paternalistic” legislation. Of\r\ncourse it may be shown that the “general good” is the ostensible object\r\nof any particular act; but the general good is a passive force, and\r\nunless we know who are the several individuals that benefit in its name,\r\nit has no meaning. When it is so analyzed, immediate and remote\r\nbeneficiaries are discovered; and the former are usually found to have\r\nbeen the dynamic element in securing the legislation. Take for example,\r\nthe economic interests of the advocates who appear in tariff hearings at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nOn the obverse side, dominant interests quite as often benefit from the\r\nprevention of governmental action as from positive assistance. They are\r\nable to take care of themselves if let alone within the circle of\r\nprotection created by the law. Indeed, most owners of property have as\r\nmuch to fear from positive governmental action as from their inability\r\nto secure advantageous legislation. Particularly is this true where the\r\nfield of private property is already extended to cover practically every\r\nform of tangible and intangible wealth. This was clearly set forth by\r\nHamilton: “It may perhaps be said that the power of preventing bad laws\r\nincludes that of preventing good ones.... But this objection will have\r\nlittle weight with those who can properly estimate the mischiefs of that\r\ninconstancy and mutability in the laws which form the greatest blemish\r\nin the character and genius of our governments. They will consider every\r\ninstitution calculated to restrain the excess of lawmaking, and to keep\r\nthings in the same state in which they happen to be at any given period,\r\nas more likely to do good than harm.... The injury which may possibly be\r\ndone by defeating a few good laws will be amply compensated by the\r\nadvantage of preventing a number of bad ones.”[386]\r\n\r\n\r\n       THE UNDERLYING POLITICAL SCIENCE OF THE CONSTITUTION[387]\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the economic implications of the structure of the\r\nfederal government, it is important to ascertain what, in the opinion of\r\n_The Federalist_, is the basis of all government. The most philosophical\r\nexamination of the foundations of political science is made by Madison\r\nin the tenth number. Here he lays down, in no uncertain language, the\r\nprinciple that the first and elemental concern of every government is\r\neconomic.\r\n\r\n1. “The first object of government,” he declares, is the protection of\r\n“the diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of\r\nproperty originate.” The chief business of government, from which,\r\nperforce, its essential nature must be derived, consists in the control\r\nand adjustment of conflicting economic interests. After enumerating the\r\nvarious forms of propertied interests which spring up inevitably in\r\nmodern society, he adds: “The regulation of these various and\r\ninterfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation,\r\nand involves the spirit of party and faction in the ordinary operations\r\nof the government.”[388]\r\n\r\n2. What are the chief causes of these conflicting political forces with\r\nwhich the government must concern itself? Madison answers. Of course\r\nfanciful and frivolous distinctions have sometimes been the cause of\r\nviolent conflicts; “but the most common and durable source of factions\r\nhas been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who\r\nhold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct\r\ninterests in society. Those who are creditors, and those who are\r\ndebtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a\r\nmanufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with\r\nmany lesser interests grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and\r\ndivide them into different classes actuated by different sentiments and\r\nviews.”\r\n\r\n3. The theories of government which men entertain are emotional\r\nreactions to their property interests. “From the protection of different\r\nand unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different\r\ndegrees and kinds of property immediately results; _and from the\r\ninfluence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective\r\nproprietors, ensues a division of society into different interests and\r\nparties_.” Legislatures reflect these interests. “What,” he asks, “are\r\nthe different classes of legislators but advocates and parties to the\r\ncauses which they determine.” There is no help for it. “The causes of\r\nfaction cannot be removed,” and “we well know that neither moral nor\r\nreligious motives can be relied on as an adequate control.”\r\n\r\n4. Unequal distribution of property is inevitable, and from it\r\ncontending factions will rise in the state. The government will reflect\r\nthem, for they will have their separate principles and “sentiments”; but\r\nthe supreme danger will arise from the fusion of certain interests into\r\nan overbearing majority, which Madison, in another place, prophesied\r\nwould be the landless proletariat,[389]—an overbearing majority which\r\nwill make its “rights” paramount, and sacrifice the “rights” of the\r\nminority. “To secure the public good,” he declares, “and private rights\r\nagainst the danger of such a faction and at the same time preserve the\r\nspirit and the form of popular government is then the great object to\r\nwhich our inquiries are directed.”\r\n\r\n5. How is this to be done? Since the contending classes cannot be\r\neliminated and their interests are bound to be reflected in politics,\r\nthe only way out lies in making it difficult for enough contending\r\ninterests to fuse into a majority, and in balancing one over against\r\nanother. The machinery for doing this is created by the new Constitution\r\nand by the Union. (_a_) Public views are to be refined and enlarged “by\r\npassing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens.” (_b_) The\r\nvery size of the Union will enable the inclusion of more interests so\r\nthat the danger of an overbearing majority is not so great. “The smaller\r\nthe society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and\r\ninterests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests,\r\nthe more frequently will a majority be found of the same party....\r\nExtend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and\r\ninterests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will\r\nhave a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such\r\na common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to\r\ndiscover their strength and to act in unison with each other.”\r\n\r\nQ. E. D., “in the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore,\r\nwe behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to\r\nrepublican government.”[390]\r\n\r\n\r\n        I. THE STRUCTURE OF GOVERNMENT OR THE BALANCE OF POWERS\r\n\r\nThe fundamental theory of political economy thus stated by Madison was\r\nthe basis of the original American conception of the balance of powers\r\nwhich is formulated at length in four numbers of _The Federalist_ and\r\nconsists of the following elements:\r\n\r\n1. No mere parchment separation of departments of government will be\r\neffective. “The legislative department is everywhere extending the\r\nsphere of its activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.\r\nThe founders of our republic ... seem never for a moment to have turned\r\ntheir eyes from the danger to liberty from the overgrown and\r\nall-grasping prerogative of an hereditary magistrate, supported and\r\nfortified by an hereditary branch of the legislative authority. They\r\nseem never to have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations,\r\nwhich, by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same\r\ntyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations.”[391]\r\n\r\n2. Some sure mode of checking usurpations in the government must be\r\nprovided, other than frequent appeals to the people. “There appear to be\r\ninsuperable objections against the proposed recurrence to the people as\r\na provision in all cases for keeping the several departments of power\r\nwithin their constitutional limits.”[392] In a contest between the\r\nlegislature and the other branches of the government, the former would\r\ndoubtless be victorious on account of the ability of the legislators to\r\nplead their cause with the people.\r\n\r\n3. What then can be depended upon to keep the government in close rein?\r\n“The only answer that can be given is, that as all these exterior\r\nprovisions are found to be inadequate, the defect must be supplied by so\r\ncontriving the interior structure of the government as that its several\r\nconstituent parts may, by their mutual relations, be the means of\r\nkeeping each other in their proper places.... It is of great importance\r\nin a republic not only to guard the society against the oppression of\r\nits rulers, but to guard one part of the society against the injustice\r\nof the other part. Different interests necessarily exist in different\r\nclasses of citizens. If a majority be united by a common interest, the\r\nrights of the minority will be insecure.”[393] There are two ways of\r\nobviating this danger: one is by establishing a monarch independent of\r\npopular will, and the other is by reflecting these contending interests\r\n(so far as their representatives may be enfranchised) in the very\r\nstructure of the government itself so that a majority cannot dominate\r\nthe minority—which minority is of course composed of those who possess\r\nproperty that may be attacked. “Society itself will be broken into so\r\nmany parts, interests, and classes of citizens, that the rights of\r\nindividuals, or of the minority, will be in little danger from\r\ninterested combinations of the majority.”[394]\r\n\r\n4. The structure of the government as devised at Philadelphia reflects\r\nthese several interests and makes improbable any danger to the minority\r\nfrom the majority. “The House of Representatives being to be elected\r\nimmediately by the people, the Senate by the State legislatures, the\r\nPresident by electors chosen for that purpose by the people, there would\r\nbe little probability of a common interest to cement these different\r\nbranches in a predilection for any particular class of electors.”[395]\r\n\r\n5. All of these diverse interests appear in the amending process but\r\nthey are further reinforced against majorities. An amendment must\r\nreceive a two-thirds vote in each of the two houses so constituted and\r\nthe approval of three-fourths of the states.\r\n\r\n6. The economic corollary of this system is as follows: Property\r\ninterests may, through their superior weight in power and intelligence,\r\nsecure advantageous legislation whenever necessary, and they may at the\r\nsame time obtain immunity from control by parliamentary majorities.\r\n\r\nIf we examine carefully the delicate instrument by which the framers\r\nsought to check certain kinds of positive action that might be advocated\r\nto the detriment of established and acquired rights, we cannot help\r\nmarvelling at their skill. Their leading idea was to break up the\r\nattacking forces at the starting point: the source of political\r\nauthority for the several branches of the government. This\r\ndisintegration of positive action at the source was further facilitated\r\nby the differentiation in the terms given to the respective departments\r\nof the government. And the crowning counterweight to “an interested and\r\noverbearing majority,” as Madison phrased it, was secured in the\r\npeculiar position assigned to the judiciary, and the use of the sanctity\r\nand mystery of the law as a foil to democratic attacks.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen on examination that no two of the leading branches of\r\nthe government are derived from the same source. The House of\r\nRepresentatives springs from the mass of the people whom the states may\r\nsee fit to enfranchise. The Senate is elected by the legislatures of the\r\nstates, which were, in 1787, almost uniformly based on property\r\nqualifications, sometimes with a differentiation between the sources of\r\nthe upper and lower houses. The President is to be chosen by electors\r\nselected as the legislatures of the states may determine—at all events\r\nby an authority one degree removed from the voters at large. The\r\njudiciary is to be chosen by the President and the Senate, both removed\r\nfrom direct popular control and holding for longer terms than the House.\r\n\r\nA sharp differentiation is made in the terms of the several authorities,\r\nso that a complete renewal of the government at one stroke is\r\nimpossible. The House of Representatives is chosen for two years; the\r\nSenators for six, but not at one election, for one-third go out every\r\ntwo years. The President is chosen for four years. The judges of the\r\nSupreme Court hold for life. Thus “popular distempers,” as eighteenth\r\ncentury publicists called them, are not only restrained from working\r\ntheir havoc through direct elections, but they are further checked by\r\nthe requirement that they must last six years in order to make their\r\neffects felt in the political department of the government, providing\r\nthey can break through the barriers imposed by the indirect election of\r\nthe Senate and the President. Finally, there is the check of judicial\r\ncontrol that can be overcome only through the manipulation of the\r\nappointing power which requires time, or through the operation of a\r\ncumbersome amending system.\r\n\r\nThe keystone of the whole structure is, in fact, the system provided for\r\njudicial control—the most unique contribution to the science of\r\ngovernment which has been made by American political genius. It is\r\nclaimed by some recent writers that it was not the intention of the\r\nframers of the Constitution to confer upon the Supreme Court the power\r\nof passing upon the constitutionality of statutes enacted by Congress;\r\nbut in view of the evidence on the other side, it is incumbent upon\r\nthose who make this assertion to bring forward positive evidence to the\r\neffect that judicial control was not a part of the Philadelphia\r\nprogramme.[396] Certainly, the authors of _The Federalist_ entertained\r\nno doubts on the point, and they conceived it to be such an excellent\r\nprinciple that they were careful to explain it to the electors to whom\r\nthey addressed their arguments.\r\n\r\nAfter elaborating fully the principle of judicial control over\r\nlegislation under the Constitution, Hamilton enumerates the advantages\r\nto be derived from it. Speaking on the point of tenure during good\r\nbehavior, he says: “In a monarchy it is an excellent barrier to the\r\ndespotism of the prince; in a republic it is no less an excellent\r\nbarrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative\r\nbody.... If, then, the courts of justice are to be considered as the\r\nbulwarks of a limited Constitution against legislative encroachments,\r\nthis consideration will afford a strong argument for the permanent\r\ntenure of judicial offices, since nothing will contribute so much as\r\nthis to that independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to\r\nthe faithful performance of so arduous a duty.... But it is not with a\r\nview to infractions of the Constitution only that the independence of\r\nthe judges may be an essential safeguard against the effects of\r\noccasional ill humors in the society. These sometimes extend no farther\r\nthan to the injury of private rights of particular classes of citizens,\r\nby unjust and partial laws. Here also the firmness of the judicial\r\nmagistracy is of vast importance in mitigating the severity and\r\nconfining the operation of such laws. It not only serves to moderate the\r\nimmediate mischiefs of those which may have been passed, but it operates\r\nas a check upon the legislative body in passing them; who, perceiving\r\nthat obstacles to the success of iniquitous intention are to be expected\r\nfrom the scruples of the courts, are in a manner compelled, by the very\r\nmotives of injustice they meditate, to qualify their attempts. This is a\r\ncircumstance calculated to have more influence upon the character of our\r\ngovernments than but few may be aware of.”[397]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it may be asked why, if the protection of property rights\r\nlay at the basis of the new system, there is in the Constitution no\r\nprovision for property qualifications for voters or for elected\r\nofficials and representatives. This is, indeed, peculiar when it is\r\nrecalled that the constitutional history of England is in a large part a\r\nrecord of conflict over the weight in the government to be enjoyed by\r\ndefinite economic groups, and over the removal of the property\r\nqualifications early imposed on members of the House of Commons and on\r\nthe voters at large. But the explanation of the absence of property\r\nqualifications from the Constitution is not difficult.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Convention were, in general, not opposed to property\r\nqualifications as such, either for officers or voters. “Several\r\npropositions,” says Mr. S. H. Miller, “were made in the federal\r\nConvention in regard to property qualifications. A motion was carried\r\ninstructing the committee to fix upon such qualifications for members of\r\nCongress. The committee could not agree upon the amount and reported in\r\nfavor of leaving the matter to the legislature. Charles Pinckney\r\nobjected to this plan as giving too much power to the first\r\nlegislature.... Ellsworth objected to a property qualification on\r\naccount of the difficulty of fixing the amount. If it was made high\r\nenough for the South, it would not be applicable to the Eastern States.\r\nFranklin was the only speaker who opposed the proposition to require\r\nproperty on principle, saying that ‘some of the greatest rogues he was\r\never acquainted with were the richest rogues.’ A resolution was also\r\ncarried to require a property qualification for the Presidency. Hence it\r\nwas evident that the lack of all property requirements for office in the\r\nUnited States Constitution was not owing to any opposition of the\r\nconvention to such qualifications per se.”[398]\r\n\r\nPropositions to establish property restrictions were defeated, not\r\nbecause they were believed to be inherently opposed to the genius of\r\nAmerican government, but for economic reasons—strange as it may seem.\r\nThese economic reasons were clearly set forth by Madison in the debate\r\nover landed qualifications for legislators in July, when he showed,\r\nfirst, that slight property qualifications would not keep out the small\r\nfarmers whose paper money schemes had been so disastrous to personalty;\r\nand, secondly, that landed property qualifications would exclude from\r\nCongress the representatives of “those classes of citizens who were not\r\nlandholders,” _i.e._ the personalty interests. This was true, he\r\nthought, because the mercantile and manufacturing classes would hardly\r\nbe willing to turn their personalty into sufficient quantities of landed\r\nproperty to make them eligible for a seat in Congress.[399]\r\n\r\nThe other members also knew that they had most to fear from the very\r\nelectors who would be enfranchised under a slight freehold\r\nrestriction,[400] for the paper money party was everywhere bottomed on\r\nthe small farming class. As Gorham remarked, the elections at\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, and Boston, “where the merchants and mechanics\r\nvote, are at least as good as those made by freeholders only.”[401] The\r\nfact emerges, therefore, that the personalty interests reflected in the\r\nConvention could, in truth, see no safeguard at all in a freehold\r\nqualification against the assaults on vested personalty rights which had\r\nbeen made by the agrarians in every state. And it was obviously\r\nimpossible to establish a personalty test, had they so desired, for\r\nthere would have been no chance of securing a ratification of the\r\nConstitution at the hands of legislatures chosen by freeholders, or at\r\nthe hands of conventions selected by them.\r\n\r\nA very neat example of this antagonism between realty and personalty in\r\nthe Convention came out on July 26, when Mason made, and Charles\r\nPinckney supported, a motion imposing landed qualifications on members\r\nof Congress and excluding from that body “persons having unsettled\r\naccounts with or being indebted to the United States.” In bringing up\r\nthis motion Mason “observed that persons of the latter descriptions had\r\nfrequently got into the state legislatures in order to promote laws that\r\nmight shelter their delinquencies; and that this evil had crept into\r\nCongress if report was to be regarded.”[402]\r\n\r\nGouverneur Morris was on his feet in an instant. If qualifications were\r\nto be imposed, they should be laid on electors, not elected persons. The\r\ndisqualification would fall upon creditors of the United States, for\r\nthere were but few who owed the government anything. He knew that under\r\nthis rule very few members of the Convention could get into the new\r\ngovernment which they were establishing. “As to persons having unsettled\r\naccounts, he believed them to be pretty many. He thought, however, that\r\nsuch a discrimination would be both odious and useless and in many\r\ninstances unjust and cruel. The delay of settlement had been more the\r\nfault of the public than of individuals. What will be done with those\r\npatriotic Citizens who have lent money or services or property to their\r\ncountry, without having been yet able to obtain a liquidation of their\r\nclaims? Are they to be excluded?” On thinking it over, Morris added to\r\nhis remarks on the subject, saying, “It was a precept of great antiquity\r\nas well as of high authority that we should not be righteous overmuch.\r\nHe thought we ought to be equally on our guard against being wise\r\novermuch.... The parliamentary qualifications quoted by Colonel Mason\r\nhad been disregarded in practice; and was but a scheme of the landed\r\nagainst the monied interest.”[403]\r\n\r\nGerry thought that the inconvenience of excluding some worthy creditors\r\nand debtors was of less importance than the advantages offered by the\r\nresolution, but, after some reflection, he added that “if property be\r\none object of government, provisions for securing it cannot be\r\nimproper.” King sagely remarked that there might be a great danger in\r\nimposing a landed qualification, because “it would exclude the monied\r\ninterest, whose aids may be essential in particular emergencies to the\r\npublic safety.”\r\n\r\nMadison had no confidence in the effectiveness of the landed\r\nqualification and moved to strike it out, adding, “Landed possessions\r\nwere no certain evidence of real wealth. Many enjoyed them to a great\r\nextent who were more in debt than they were worth. The unjust laws of\r\nthe states had proceeded more from this class of men than any others. It\r\nhad often happened that men who had acquired landed property on credit\r\ngot into the Legislatures with a view of promoting an unjust protection\r\nagainst their Creditors. In the next place, if a small quantity of land\r\nshould be made the standard, it would be no security; if a large one, it\r\nwould exclude the proper representatives of those classes of Citizens\r\nwho were not landholders.” For these and other reasons he opposed the\r\nlanded qualifications and suggested that property qualifications on the\r\nvoters would be better.[404]\r\n\r\nThe motion to strike out the “landed” qualification for legislators was\r\ncarried by a vote of ten to one; the proposition to strike out the\r\ndisqualification of persons having unsettled accounts with the United\r\nStates was carried by a vote of nine to two. Finally the proposition to\r\nexclude persons who were indebted to the United States was likewise\r\ndefeated by a vote of nine to two, after Pinckney had called attention\r\nto the fact that “it would exclude persons who had purchased confiscated\r\nproperty or should purchase Western territory of the public and might be\r\nsome obstacle to the sale of the latter.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was little risk to personalty in thus allowing the\r\nConstitution to go to the states for approval without any property\r\nqualifications on voters other than those which the state might see fit\r\nto impose. Only one branch of new government, the House of\r\nRepresentatives, was required to be elected by popular vote; and, in\r\ncase popular choice of presidential electors might be established, a\r\nsafeguard was secured by the indirect process. Two controlling bodies,\r\nthe Senate and Supreme Court, were removed altogether from the\r\npossibility of popular election except by constitutional amendment.\r\nFinally, the conservative members of the Convention were doubly\r\nfortified in the fact that nearly all of the state constitutions then in\r\nforce provided real or personal property qualifications for voters\r\nanyway, and radical democratic changes did not seem perilously\r\nnear.[405]\r\n\r\n\r\n          II. THE POWERS CONFERRED UPON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n1. The powers for positive action conferred upon the new government were\r\nfew, but they were adequate to the purposes of the framers. They\r\nincluded, first, the power to lay and collect taxes; but here the rural\r\ninterests were conciliated by the provision that direct taxes must be\r\napportioned among the states according to population, counting\r\nthree-fifths of the slaves. This, in the opinion of contemporaries\r\neminently qualified to speak, was designed to prevent the populations of\r\nthe manufacturing states from shifting the burdens of taxation to the\r\nsparsely settled agricultural regions.[406]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the governor of their state, three delegates from North\r\nCarolina, Blount, Spaight, and Williamson, explained the advantage of\r\nthis safeguard on taxation to the southern planters and farmers: “We had\r\nmany things to hope from a National Government and the chief thing we\r\nhad to fear from such a Government was the risque of unequal or heavy\r\nTaxation, but we hope you will believe as we do that the Southern states\r\nin general and North Carolina in particular are well secured on that\r\nhead by the proposed system. It is provided in the 9th section of\r\narticle the first that no Capitation or direct Tax shall be laid except\r\nin proportion to the number of inhabitants, in which number five blacks\r\nare only counted as three. If a land tax is laid, we are to pay the same\r\nrate; for example, fifty citizens of North Carolina can be taxed no more\r\nfor all their Lands than fifty Citizens in one of the Eastern States.\r\nThis must be greatly in our favour, for as most of their farms are small\r\nand many of them live in Towns we certainly have, one with another, land\r\nof twice the value that they possess. When it is also considered that\r\nfive Negroes are only to be charged the same Poll Tax as three whites,\r\nthe advantage must be considerably increased under the proposed Form of\r\nGovernment. The Southern states have also a better security for the\r\nreturn of slaves who might endeavour to escape than they had under the\r\noriginal Confederation.”[407]\r\n\r\nThe taxing power was the basis of all other positive powers, and it\r\nafforded the revenues that were to discharge the public debt in full.\r\nProvision was made for this discharge in Article VI to the effect that\r\n“All debts contracted and engagements entered into before the adoption\r\nof this Constitution shall be valid against the United States under this\r\nConstitution as under the Confederation.”\r\n\r\nBut the cautious student of public economy, remembering the difficulties\r\nwhich Congress encountered under the Articles of Confederation in its\r\nattempts to raise the money to meet the interest on the debt, may ask\r\nhow the framers of the Constitution could expect to overcome the hostile\r\neconomic forces which had hitherto blocked the payment of the\r\nrequisitions. The answer is short. Under the Articles, Congress had no\r\npower to lay and collect taxes immediately; it could only make\r\nrequisitions on the state legislatures. Inasmuch as most of the states\r\nrelied largely on direct taxes for their revenues, the demands of\r\nCongress were keenly felt and stoutly resisted. Under the new system,\r\nhowever, Congress is authorized to lay taxes on its own account, but it\r\nis evident that the framers contemplated placing practically all of the\r\nnational burden on the consumer. The provision requiring the\r\napportionment of direct taxes on a basis of population obviously implied\r\nthat such taxes were to be viewed as a last resort when indirect taxes\r\nfailed to provide the required revenue.\r\n\r\nWith his usual acumen, Hamilton conciliates the freeholders and property\r\nowners in general by pointing out that they will not be called upon to\r\nsupport the national government by payments proportioned to their\r\nwealth.[408] Experience has demonstrated that it is impracticable to\r\nraise any considerable sums by direct taxation. Even where the\r\ngovernment is strong, as in Great Britain, resort must be had chiefly to\r\nindirect taxation. The pockets of the farmers “will reluctantly yield\r\nbut scanty supplies, in the unwelcome shape of impositions on their\r\nhouses and lands; and personal property is too precarious and invisible\r\na fund to be laid hold of in any other way than by the imperceptible\r\nagency of taxes on consumption.” Real and personal property are thus\r\nassured a generous immunity from such burdens as Congress had attempted\r\nto impose under the Articles; taxes under the new system will,\r\ntherefore, be less troublesome than under the old.\r\n\r\n2. Congress was given, in the second place, plenary power to raise and\r\nsupport military and naval forces, for the defence of the country\r\nagainst foreign and domestic foes. These forces were to be at the\r\ndisposal of the President in the execution of national laws; and to\r\nguard the states against renewed attempts of “desperate debtors” like\r\nShays, the United States guaranteed to every commonwealth a republican\r\nform of government and promised to aid in quelling internal disorder on\r\ncall of the proper authorities.\r\n\r\nThe army and navy are considered by the authors of _The Federalist_ as\r\ngenuine economic instrumentalities. As will be pointed out below, they\r\nregarded trade and commerce as the fundamental cause of wars between\r\nnations; and the source of domestic insurrection they traced to class\r\nconflicts within society. “Nations in general,” says Jay, “will make war\r\nwhenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it”;[409] and it is\r\nobvious that the United States dissevered and discordant will be the\r\neasy prey to the commercial ambitions of their neighbors and rivals.\r\n\r\nThe material gains to be made by other nations at the expense of the\r\nUnited States are so apparent that the former cannot restrain themselves\r\nfrom aggression. France and Great Britain feel the pressure of our\r\nrivalry in the fisheries; they and other European nations are our\r\ncompetitors in navigation and the carrying trade; our independent\r\nvoyages to China interfere with the monopolies enjoyed by other\r\ncountries there; Spain would like to shut the Mississippi against us on\r\none side and Great Britain fain would close the St. Lawrence on the\r\nother. The cheapness and excellence of our productions will excite their\r\njealousy, and the enterprise and address of our merchants will not be\r\nconsistent with the wishes or policy of the sovereigns of Europe. But,\r\nadds the commentator, by way of clinching the argument, “if they see\r\nthat our national government is efficient and well administered, our\r\ntrade prudently regulated, our militia properly organized and\r\ndisciplined, our resources and finances discreetly managed, our credit\r\nre-established, our people free, contented, and united, they will be\r\nmuch more disposed to cultivate our friendship than provoke our\r\nresentment.”[410]\r\n\r\nAll the powers of Europe could not prevail against us. “Under a vigorous\r\nnational government the natural strength and resources of the country,\r\ndirected to a common interest, would baffle all the combinations of\r\nEuropean jealousy to restrain our growth.... An active commerce, an\r\nextensive navigation, and a flourishing marine would then be the\r\noffspring of moral and physical necessity. We might defy the little arts\r\nof the little politicians to control or vary the irresistible and\r\nunchangeable course of nature.”[411] In the present state of disunion\r\nthe profits of trade are snatched from us; our commerce languishes; and\r\npoverty threatens to overspread a country which might outrival the world\r\nin riches.\r\n\r\nThe army and navy are to be not only instruments of defence in\r\nprotecting the United States against the commercial and territorial\r\nambitions of other countries; but they may be used also in forcing open\r\nforeign markets. What discriminatory tariffs and navigation laws may not\r\naccomplish the sword may achieve. The authors of _The Federalist_ do not\r\ncontemplate that policy of mild and innocuous isolation which was later\r\nmade famous by Washington’s farewell address.[412] On the contrary—they\r\ndo not expect the United States to change human nature and make our\r\ncommercial classes less ambitious than those of other countries to\r\nextend their spheres of trade. A strong navy will command the respect of\r\nEuropean states. “There can be no doubt that the continuance of the\r\nUnion under an efficient government would put it within our power, at a\r\nperiod not very distant, to create a navy which, if it could not vie\r\nwith those of the great maritime powers, would at least be of\r\nrespectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending\r\nparties.... A few ships of the line sent opportunely to the\r\nreinforcement of either side, would often be sufficient to decide the\r\nfate of a campaign, on the event of which interests of the greatest\r\nmagnitude were suspended. Our position is, in this respect, a most\r\ncommanding one. And if to this consideration we add that of the\r\nusefulness of supplies from this country, in the prosecution of military\r\noperations in the West Indies, it will be readily perceived that a\r\nsituation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage\r\nfor commercial privileges. A price would be set not only upon our\r\nfriendship, but upon our neutrality. By a steady adherence to the Union,\r\nwe may hope, ere long, to become the arbiter of Europe in America, and\r\nto be able to incline the balance of European competitions in this part\r\nof the world as our interest may dictate.”[413]\r\n\r\nAs to dangers from class wars within particular states, the authors of\r\n_The Federalist_ did not deem it necessary to make extended remarks: the\r\nrecent events in New England were only too vividly impressed upon the\r\npublic mind. “The tempestuous situation from which Massachusetts has\r\nscarcely emerged,” says Hamilton, “evinces that dangers of this kind are\r\nnot merely speculative. Who can determine what might have been the issue\r\nof her late convulsions, if the malcontents had been headed by a Cæsar\r\nor by a Cromwell.”[414] The strong arm of the Union must be available in\r\nsuch crises.\r\n\r\nIn considering the importance of defence against domestic insurrection,\r\nthe authors of _The Federalist_ do not overlook an appeal to the\r\nslave-holders’ instinctive fear of a servile revolt. Naturally, it is\r\nMadison whose interest catches this point and drives it home, by\r\nappearing to discount it. In dealing with the dangers of insurrection,\r\nhe says: “I take no notice of an unhappy species of population abounding\r\nin some of the states who, during the calm of regular government are\r\nsunk below the level of men; but who, in the tempestuous scenes of civil\r\nviolence, may emerge into human character and give a superiority of\r\nstrength to any party with which they may associate themselves.”[415]\r\n\r\n3. In addition to the power to lay and collect taxes and raise and\r\nmaintain armed forces on land and sea, the Constitution vests in\r\nCongress plenary control over foreign and interstate commerce, and thus\r\nauthorizes it to institute protective and discriminatory laws in favor\r\nof American interests,[416] and to create a wide sweep for free trade\r\nthroughout the whole American empire. A single clause thus reflects the\r\nstrong impulse of economic forces in the towns and young manufacturing\r\ncentres. In a few simple words the mercantile and manufacturing\r\ninterests wrote their _Zweck im Recht_; and they paid for their victory\r\nby large concessions to the slave-owning planters of the south.[417]\r\n\r\nWhile dealing with commerce in _The Federalist_[418] Hamilton does not\r\nneglect the subject of interstate traffic and intercourse. He shows how\r\nfree trade over a wide range will be to reciprocal advantage, will give\r\ngreat diversity to commercial enterprise, and will render stagnation\r\nless liable by offering more distant markets when local demands fall\r\noff. “The speculative trader,” he concludes, “will at once perceive the\r\nforce of these observations and will acknowledge that the aggregate\r\nbalance of the commerce of the United States would bid fair to be much\r\nmore favorable than that of the thirteen states without union or with\r\npartial unions.”\r\n\r\n4. Another great economic antagonism found its expression in the clause\r\nconferring upon Congress the power to dispose of the territories and\r\nmake rules and regulations for their government and admission to the\r\nUnion. In this contest, the interests of the states which held\r\nterritories came prominently to the front; and the ambiguity of the\r\nlanguage used in the Constitution on this point may be attributed to the\r\ninability of the contestants to reach precise conclusions.[419] The\r\nleaders were willing to risk the proper management of the land problem\r\nafter the new government was safely launched; and they were correct in\r\ntheir estimate of their future political prowess.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the great powers conferred on the new government: taxation,\r\nwar, commercial control, and disposition of western lands. Through them\r\npublic creditors may be paid in full, domestic peace maintained,\r\nadvantages obtained in dealing with foreign nations, manufactures\r\nprotected, and the development of the territories go forward with full\r\nswing. The remaining powers are minor and need not be examined here.\r\nWhat implied powers lay in the minds of the framers likewise need not be\r\ninquired into; they have long been the subject of juridical speculation.\r\n\r\nNone of the powers conferred by the Constitution on Congress permits a\r\ndirect attack on property. The federal government is given no general\r\nauthority to define property. It may tax, but indirect taxes must be\r\nuniform, and these are to fall upon consumers. Direct taxes may be laid,\r\nbut resort to this form of taxation is rendered practically impossible,\r\nsave on extraordinary occasions, by the provision that they must be\r\napportioned according to population—so that numbers cannot transfer the\r\nburden to accumulated wealth. The slave trade may be destroyed, it is\r\ntrue, after the lapse of a few years; but slavery as a domestic\r\ninstitution is better safeguarded than before.\r\n\r\nEven the destruction of the slave trade had an economic basis, although\r\nmuch was said at the time about the ethics of the clause. In the North\r\nwhere slavery, though widespread, was of little economic consequence,\r\nsympathy with the unfortunate negroes could readily prevail. Maryland\r\nand Virginia, already overstocked with slaves beyond the limits of land\r\nand capital, had prohibited the foreign trade in negroes, because the\r\nslave-holders, who predominated in the legislatures, were not willing to\r\nsee the value of their chattels reduced to a vanishing point by\r\nexcessive importations. South Carolina and Georgia, where the death rate\r\nin the rice swamps and the opening of adjoining territories made a\r\nstrong demand for the increase of slave property, on the other hand,\r\ndemanded an open door for slave-dealers.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was particularly determined,[420] and gave northern\r\nrepresentatives to understand that if they wished to secure their\r\ncommercial privileges, they must make concessions to the slave trade.\r\nAnd they were met half way. Ellsworth said: “As slaves multiply so fast\r\nin Virginia and Maryland that it is cheaper to raise than import them,\r\nwhilst in the sickly rice swamps foreign supplies are necessary, if we\r\ngo no farther than is urged, we shall be unjust towards South Carolina\r\nand Georgia. Let us not intermeddle. As population increases; poor\r\nlaborers will be so plenty as to render slaves useless.”[421]\r\n\r\nGeneral Pinckney taunted the Virginia representatives in the Convention,\r\nsome of whom were against slavery as well as importation, with\r\ndisingenuous interestedness. “South Carolina and Georgia cannot do\r\nwithout slaves. As to Virginia she will gain by stopping the\r\nimportations. Her slaves will rise in value and she has more than she\r\nwants. It would be unequal to require South Carolina and Georgia to\r\nconfederate on such unequal terms.”\r\n\r\n\r\n             III. RESTRICTIONS LAID UPON STATE LEGISLATURES\r\n\r\nEqually important to personalty as the positive powers conferred upon\r\nCongress to tax, support armies, and regulate commerce were the\r\nrestrictions imposed on the states.[422] Indeed, we have the high\r\nauthority of Madison for the statement that of the forces which created\r\nthe Constitution, those property interests seeking protection against\r\nomnipotent legislatures were the most active.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Jefferson, written in October, 1787, Madison elaborates\r\nthe principle of federal judicial control over state legislation, and\r\nexplains the importance of this new institution in connection with the\r\nrestrictions laid down in the Constitution on laws affecting private\r\nrights. “The mutability of the laws of the States,” he says, “is found\r\nto be a serious evil. The injustice of them has been so frequent and so\r\nflagrant as to alarm the most steadfast friends of Republicanism. I am\r\npersuaded I do not err in saying that the evils issuing from these\r\nsources contributed more to that uneasiness which produced the\r\nConvention, and prepared the public mind for a general reform, than\r\nthose which accrued to our national character and interest from the\r\ninadequacy of the Confederation to its immediate objects. A reform,\r\ntherefore, which does not make provision for private rights must be\r\nmaterially defective.”[423]\r\n\r\nTwo small clauses embody the chief demands of personalty against\r\nagrarianism: the emission of paper money is prohibited and the states\r\nare forbidden to impair the obligation of contract. The first of these\r\nmeans a return to a specie basis—when coupled with the requirement that\r\nthe gold and silver coin of the United States shall be the legal tender.\r\nThe Shays and their paper money legions, who assaulted the vested rights\r\nof personalty by the process of legislative depreciation, are now\r\nsubdued forever, and money lenders and security holders may be sure of\r\ntheir operations. Contracts are to be safe, and whoever engages in a\r\nfinancial operation, public or private, may know that state legislatures\r\ncannot destroy overnight the rules by which the game is played.\r\n\r\nA principle of deep significance is written in these two brief\r\nsentences. The economic history of the states between the Revolution and\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution is compressed in them. They appealed to\r\nevery money lender, to every holder of public paper, to every man who\r\nhad any personalty at stake. The intensity of the economic interests\r\nreflected in these two prohibitions can only be felt by one who has\r\nspent months in the study of American agrarianism after the Revolution.\r\nIn them personalty won a significant battle in the conflict of\r\n1787–1788.\r\n\r\nThe authors of _The Federalist_ advance in support of these two clauses\r\nvery substantial arguments which bear out the view here expressed. “The\r\nloss which America has sustained since the peace, from the pestilential\r\neffects of paper money on the necessary confidence between man and man,\r\non the necessary confidence in the public councils, on the industry and\r\nmorals of the people, and on the character of republican government,\r\nconstitutes an enormous debt against the States chargeable with this\r\nunadvised measure, which must long remain unsatisfied; or rather an\r\naccumulation of guilt which can be expiated no otherwise than by a\r\nvoluntary sacrifice on the altar of justice of the power which has been\r\nthe instrument of it.” Speaking on the contract clause—that “additional\r\nbulwark in favor of personal security and private rights”—Madison is\r\nsure that the “sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating\r\npolicy which has directed the public councils,” and will welcome a\r\nreform that will “inspire a general prudence and industry and give a\r\nregular course to the business of society.”[424]\r\n\r\nHamilton on several occasions laid great stress on the contract clause\r\nas one of the features of the Constitution which had warmly commended it\r\nto its supporters. In a communication to Washington, dated May 29, 1790,\r\nhe wrote: “This, to the more enlightened part of the community, was not\r\none of the least recommendations of that Constitution. The too frequent\r\nintermeddlings of the state legislatures in relation to private\r\ncontracts were extensively felt and seriously lamented; and a\r\nConstitution which promised a preventative was, by those who felt and\r\nthought in that manner, eagerly embraced.”[425]\r\n\r\nThere was not a little discussion of the obligation of contract clause\r\nin the contemporary press during the period of ratification, and there\r\ncan be no doubt that it was favorably viewed by the supporters of the\r\nConstitution as an added safeguard against paper money and stay laws. A\r\nwriter in the New Hampshire Spy, on November 3, 1787, in commending the\r\nnew frame of government to his fellow citizens, calls particular\r\nattention to this provision: “It also expressly prohibits those\r\ndestructive laws in the several states which alter or impair the\r\nobligation of contracts; so that in future anyone may be certain of an\r\nexact fulfilment of any contract that may be entered into or the penalty\r\nthat may be stipulated for in case of failure.”\r\n\r\nAnother writer of the period approves the same principle with more\r\nvigor. “My countrymen, the devil is among you. Make paper as much as you\r\nplease. Make it a tender in all _future_ contracts, or let it rest on\r\nits own credit—but remember that _past_ contracts are sacred things—and\r\nthat legislatures have no right to interfere with them—they have no\r\nright to say, a debt shall be paid at a discount, or in any manner which\r\nthe parties never intended.... To pay _bona fide_ contracts for cash, in\r\npaper of little value, or in old horses, would be a dishonest attempt in\r\nan individual: but for legislatures to frame laws to support and\r\nencourage such detestable villainy, is like a judge who should inscribe\r\nthe arms of a rogue over the seat of justice.”[426]\r\n\r\nThe full import of the obligation of contract clause was doubtless\r\nbetter understood by Chief Justice Marshall than by any man of that\r\ngeneration. He had taken an active part in the adoption of the\r\nConstitution in his state, and he had studied long and arduously the\r\nhistory of the period for his classic defence of Federalism, _The Life\r\nof Washington_. In more than one decision he applied the clause with\r\ngreat effect, and voiced the views of his Federalist contemporaries on\r\nthis point, explaining the deep-seated social antagonism which is\r\nreflected in it.[427] And when at length, in his declining years, he saw\r\nit attacked in the legislatures by Jacksonian democracy, and beheld the\r\nSupreme Court itself surrendering the position which he had earlier\r\ntaken, he spread on record in a dissenting opinion a warning and a\r\nprotest which for cogency and vigor equals any of his great\r\ndissertations delivered in the name of the Court.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Ogden _v._ Saunders, decided in the January term of 1827,\r\nthe Supreme Court was compelled to pass upon the issue: “Does a bankrupt\r\nlaw which applies to contracts made _after_ its passage impair the\r\nobligation of those contracts?” The newer school on the bench,\r\nWashington, Johnson, Trimble, and Thompson were of opinion that such a\r\nlaw did not impair the obligation of contract and was valid. Marshall,\r\nDuvall, and Story dissented. The Chief Justice took the high ground that\r\nthe obligation of a contract inhered in the contract itself, and could\r\nnot be changed by any external legislation whatever. Therefore,\r\nobviously, legislation affecting adversely the obligation of future\r\ncontracts was just as unconstitutional as legislation attacking\r\ncontracts already made. In other words, Marshall, who ought to have\r\nknown what the framers of the Constitution intended better than any man\r\non the supreme bench, believed that it was designed to bring under the\r\nban substantially all legislation which affected personalty adversely—in\r\nother words that it was similar in character to the due process clause\r\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the contract clause he said with great solemnity: “We cannot\r\nlook back to the history of the times when the august spectacle was\r\nexhibited of the assemblage of the whole people by their representatives\r\nin convention, in order to unite thirteen independent sovereignties\r\nunder one government, so far as might be necessary for the purposes of\r\nunion, without being sensible of the great importance attached to the\r\ntenth section of the first article. The power of changing the relative\r\nsituation of debtor and creditor, of interfering with contracts, a power\r\nwhich comes home to every man, touches the interest of all, and controls\r\nthe conduct of every individual in those things which he supposes to be\r\nproper for his own exclusive management, had been used to such an excess\r\nby the state legislatures as to break in upon the ordinary intercourse\r\nof society, and destroy all confidence between man and man. The mischief\r\nhad become so great, so alarming as not only to impair commercial\r\nintercourse, and threaten the existence of credit, but to sap the morals\r\nof the people, and destroy the sanctity of private faith. To guard\r\nagainst the continuance of the evil was an object of deep interest with\r\nall the truly wise, as well as virtuous, of this great community, and\r\nwas one of the important benefits expected from a reform of the\r\ngovernment.”[428]\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE ECONOMICS OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\nThe authors of _The Federalist_ carry over into the field of\r\ninternational politics the concept of economic antagonisms which lie at\r\nthe basis of their system of domestic politics. Modern wars spring\r\nprimarily out of commercial rivalry, although the ambitions of princes\r\nhave often been a source of international conflict. “Has commerce\r\nhitherto done anything more than change the objects of war?” asks\r\nHamilton. “Is not the love of wealth as domineering and enterprising a\r\npassion as that of power or glory? Have there not been as many wars\r\nfounded upon commercial motives, since that has become the prevailing\r\nsystem of nations, as were before occasioned by the cupidity of\r\nterritory or dominion? Has not the spirit of commerce, in many\r\ninstances, administered new incentives to the appetite, both for the one\r\nand for the other?”[429] Let history answer. Carthage, a commercial\r\nrepublic, was an aggressor in a war that ended in her destruction. The\r\nfurious contests of Holland and England were over the dominion of the\r\nsea. Commerce has been for ages the predominant pursuit of England, and\r\nshe has been constantly engaged in wars. Even the Hapsburg-Bourbon wars\r\nhave in a large measure grown out of commercial considerations.\r\n\r\nIn this world-wide and age-long conflict of nations for commercial\r\nadvantages, the United States cannot expect to become a non-resistant,\r\nan idle spectator. Even were pacific ideals to dominate American policy,\r\nshe could not overcome the scruples of her ambitious rivals. In union,\r\ntherefore, is strength against aggression and in support of offensive\r\noperations. Moreover, the Union will be better able to settle disputes\r\namicably because of the greater show of power which it can make.\r\n“Acknowledgements, explanations, and compensations are often accepted as\r\nsatisfactory from a strong united nation, which would be rejected as\r\nunsatisfactory if offered by a state or a confederacy of little\r\nconsideration or power.”[430]\r\n\r\nTurning from the material causes of foreign wars the authors of _The\r\nFederalist_ examine the possible sources of danger from domestic discord\r\namong the states, regarded as independent sovereignties. And how may\r\nsuch domestic discord arise? The North will probably grow strong and\r\nformidable and be tempted to despoil the South: nor “does it appear to\r\nbe a rash conjecture,” says Jay, “that its young swarms might often be\r\ntempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and milder air of\r\ntheir luxurious and more delicate neighbors.”[431]\r\n\r\nThen the apple of discord may be thrown among the states by foreign\r\ncountries if several confederacies take the place of union. And what is\r\nthis apple of discord? Each of the proposed confederacies, says Jay,\r\n“would have its commerce with foreigners to regulate by distinct\r\ntreaties; and as their productions and commodities are different and\r\nproper for different markets, so would those treaties be essentially\r\ndifferent.” Treaties are subject to the law of greatest economic\r\npressure. “Different commercial concerns,” he continues, “must create\r\ndifferent interests, and of course different degrees of political\r\nattachment to and connection with different foreign nations.”[432] The\r\ndegrees of political attachment also follow the law of greatest economic\r\npressure; and if foreign nations come to blows among themselves, their\r\nallies in America are likely to be drawn into the conflict. Thus\r\ndomestic discord may arise among the states indirectly through their\r\nmaterial connections with other countries.\r\n\r\nBut internecine warfare will more probably arise from causes operating\r\nwithin the states; and what may be the real sources of such conflict?\r\nasks Hamilton.[433] They are numerous: lust for power and dominion, the\r\ndesire for equality and safety, the ambitions of leaders. Has it not\r\ninvariably been found, he adds, “that momentary passions, and immediate\r\ninterests have a more active and imperious control over human conduct\r\nthan general and remote considerations of policy, utility, or\r\njustice?... Has commerce hitherto done anything more than change the\r\nobjects of war? Is not the love of wealth as domineering and\r\nenterprising a passion as that of power or glory? Have there not been as\r\nmany wars founded upon commercial motives since that has become the\r\nprevailing system of nations, as were before occasioned by the cupidity\r\nof territory or dominion?”\r\n\r\nOf course such acute observers as the authors of _The Federalist_ do not\r\nomit to remark that the personal ambitions of monarchs have been a cause\r\nof wars, and the passions of men for leadership have been a source of\r\ndomestic insurrections. But they are quick to add that the\r\naggrandizement and support of their particular families are among the\r\nmotives that have led monarchs to undertake wars of conquest;[434] and\r\nas to personal element in domestic insurrections, Hamilton expresses a\r\ndoubt whether Massachusetts would recently have been plunged into civil\r\nwar “if Shays had not been a _desperate debtor_.”[435]\r\n\r\nTurning from the question as to the extent of the economic motive in the\r\npersonal element, Hamilton makes an inquiry into the more probable\r\nsources of wars among the states in case a firmer union, endowed with\r\nadequate powers, is not established. These he enumerates:[436]\r\n\r\n1. “Territorial disputes have at all times been found one of the most\r\nfertile sources of hostility among nations.” The several states have an\r\ninterest in the Western Territories, and “to reason from the past to the\r\nfuture, we shall have good ground to apprehend that the sword would\r\nsometimes be appealed to as the arbiter of their differences.”\r\n\r\n2. “The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of\r\ncontention.” Each state will pursue a policy conducive to its own\r\nadvantage, and “the spirit of enterprise, which characterizes the\r\ncommercial part of America, has left no occasion of displaying itself\r\nunimproved. It is not at all probable that this unbridled spirit would\r\npay much respect to those regulations of trade by which particular\r\nstates might endeavor to secure exclusive benefits to their own\r\ncitizens.” The economic motive will thus probably override all\r\nconsiderations of interstate comity and all considerations of\r\ninternational law. But that is not all; says Hamilton, in italics, “_We\r\nshould be ready to denominate injuries those things which were in\r\nreality the justifiable acts of independent sovereignties consulting a\r\ndistinct interest._” Commerce will have little respect for the right of\r\nother peoples to protect their interests, and it will stigmatize as an\r\n“injury” anything which blocks its enterprise.\r\n\r\n3. “The public debt of the Union would be a further cause of collision\r\nbetween the separate states or confederacies.” Some states would oppose\r\npaying the debt. Why? Because they are “less impressed with the\r\nimportance of national credit, or because their citizens have little, if\r\nany, immediate interest in the question.” But other states, “a numerous\r\nbody of whose citizens are creditors to the public beyond the proportion\r\nof the state in the total amount of the national debt, would be\r\nstrenuous for some equitable and effective provision.” In other words,\r\ncitizens who had nothing at stake would be indifferent, and those who\r\nhad something to lose would clamor. Foreign powers also might intervene,\r\nand the “double contingency of external invasion and internal\r\ncontention” would be hazarded.\r\n\r\n4. “Laws in violation of private contracts, as they amount to\r\naggressions on the rights of those states whose citizens are injured by\r\nthem, may be considered as another probable source of hostility.” Had\r\nthere not been plenty of evidence to show that state legislatures, if\r\nunrestrained by some higher authority, would attack private rights in\r\nproperty? And had there not been a spirit of retaliation also? “We\r\nreasonably infer that in similar cases, under other circumstances, a\r\nwar, not of _parchment_, but of the sword, would chastise such atrocious\r\nbreaches of moral obligation and social justice.”\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the four leading sources of probable conflict among the\r\nstates if not united into a firm union: territory, commerce, the\r\nnational debt, and violations of contractual rights in property—all as\r\nseverely economic as could well be imagined.\r\n\r\nTo carry the theory of the economic interpretation of the Constitution\r\nout into its ultimate details would require a monumental commentary,\r\nsuch as lies completely beyond the scope of this volume. But enough has\r\nbeen said to show that the concept of the Constitution as a piece of\r\nabstract legislation reflecting no group interests and recognizing no\r\neconomic antagonisms is entirely false. It was an economic document\r\ndrawn with superb skill by men whose property interests were immediately\r\nat stake; and as such it appealed directly and unerringly to identical\r\ninterests in the country at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n        THE POLITICAL DOCTRINES OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CONVENTION\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving examined the economic implications of the Constitution in the\r\nlight of the greatest of all commentaries, _The Federalist_, it is now\r\ninteresting to inquire whether the members of the Convention at large\r\nentertained substantially identical views as to the political science of\r\nthe system. There are several difficulties in the way of such an\r\ninvestigation. Not all of the delegates, indeed not all of the most\r\ninfluential, were speech makers or writers or philosophers. As intensely\r\npractical men they were concerned with tangible results, not with the\r\nmanner in which political scientists might view the details of their\r\noperations. There is, accordingly, a considerable danger of attempting\r\ntoo much in making generalizations, and to obviate this as far as\r\npossible, the method of taking the members in alphabetical order is\r\nadopted, and the evidence of the views entertained by each is fully\r\ndocumented.[437]\r\n\r\nThe leaders in politics and political philosophy in the eighteenth\r\ncentury were not far removed from that frank recognition of class rights\r\nwhich characterized English society, and they were not under the\r\nnecessity of obscuring—at least to the same extent as modern partisan\r\nwriters—the essential economic antagonisms featuring in law and\r\nconstitution making. Their clarity of thought was greatly facilitated by\r\nthe disfranchisement of the propertyless, which made it unnecessary for\r\npolitical writers to address themselves to the proletariat and to\r\nexplain dominant group interests in such a manner as to make them appear\r\nin the garb of “public policy.”\r\n\r\nThere does not appear, of course, in the writings of American political\r\nscientists in the eighteenth century, that sharp recognition of class\r\nrights which characterizes the feudal legists, because within the\r\npropertied interests politically represented in the government, there\r\nwere divisions which had to be glossed over; and there were also\r\nmutterings of unrest on the part of the disfranchised which later broke\r\nout in the storm that swept away the property qualifications on voters\r\nand introduced political equalitarianism. Under these circumstances the\r\nsupporters of the Constitution had to be somewhat circumspect in the\r\nexpression of their views; but, happily for science, the proceedings at\r\nPhiladelphia during the drafting of the Constitution were secret, and\r\nthey were able to discuss with utmost frankness the actual\r\npolitico-economic results which they desired to reach. Fortunately,\r\nalso, fragmentary reports of these proceedings have come down to us, and\r\nhave been put in a definitive form by Professor Farrand.\r\n\r\n_Abraham Baldwin_, of Georgia, did not indulge in any lengthy\r\ndisquisitions on government in the Convention, and his literary remains\r\nare apparently very meagre. However, his view that the Senate of the\r\nUnited States ought to represent property came out in the debate on June\r\n29, over a motion by Ellsworth to the effect that the “rule of suffrage\r\nin the second branch be the same as that established by the Articles of\r\nConfederation.” Baldwin immediately opposed the proposition, saying, “He\r\nthought the second branch ought to be the representation of property,\r\nand that in forming it therefore some reference ought to be had to the\r\nrelative wealth of their constituents, and to the principles on which\r\nthe senate of Massachusetts was constituted.”[438] At the time the\r\nsenate of that commonwealth rested upon special freehold and personalty\r\nqualifications,[439] and the members were apportioned among the several\r\ndistricts on the basis of the amount of taxes paid by each. It is thus\r\napparent that Baldwin wished the Senate of the new government to be\r\nbased frankly upon property.\r\n\r\n_Gunning Bedford_, of Delaware, did not participate extensively in the\r\ndebates of the Convention, but it seems from the character of the few\r\nremarks that he made that he favored a more democratic form than was\r\nfinally adopted, although he signed the Constitution. This inference is\r\ndrawn from a brief notice of his objection to the establishment of a\r\ncouncil of revision composed of the executive and a certain number of\r\nthe judiciary to exercise a sort of censorship over the acts of\r\nCongress. Madison records as follows: “Mr. Bedford was opposed to every\r\ncheck on the Legislative, even the Council of Revision first proposed.\r\nHe thought it would be sufficient to mark out in the Constitution the\r\nboundaries to the Legislative Authority, which would give all the\r\nrequisite security to the rights of the other departments. The\r\nRepresentatives of the People were the best judges of what was for their\r\ninterest, and ought to be under no external controul whatever. The two\r\nbranches would produce a sufficient controul within the Legislature\r\nitself.”[440]\r\n\r\n_Jacob Broom_ was among those who wished to “lessen the dependence of\r\nthe general government on the people,” to use Jefferson’s phrase, by\r\nlengthening the terms of public officers. He seconded Read’s motion to\r\nincrease the term of Senators to nine years;[441] he opposed the\r\nelection of the executive by popular vote, and supported Luther Martin’s\r\nresolution in favor of election by electors appointed by the\r\nlegislatures of the several states;[442] he wished to give life tenure\r\nto the executive, that is, during good behavior,[443] and he favored the\r\nsuggestion that Congress should be given a negative over state\r\nlegislatures.[444] Broom seldom spoke in the Convention, but there is no\r\ndoubt that he believed in a restricted and well “balanced” democracy.\r\n\r\n_Pierce Butler_, of South Carolina, on more than one occasion urged\r\nthe desirability of making property at least one of the elements in\r\nthe distribution of representation. On June 6, when Charles Pinckney\r\nmoved that the lower house of the national legislature should be\r\nchosen by the state legislatures and not by the people, Butler said:\r\n“I am against determining the mode of election until the ratio of\r\nrepresentation is fixed—if that proceeds on a principle favorable to\r\nwealth as well as numbers of free inhabitants, I am content to unite\r\nwith Delaware (Mr. Read) in abolishing the state legislatures and\r\nbecoming one nation instead of a confederation of republics.”[445] In\r\nconnection with a discussion of the Senate, “he urged that the second\r\nbranch ought to represent the states according to their\r\nproperty.”[446] Later in the sessions of the Convention he again\r\n“warmly urged the justice and necessity of regarding wealth in the\r\napportionment of representation.”[447] He was also particularly\r\nsolicitous about slave property, and he declared that “the security\r\nwhich the southern states want is that their negroes may not be taken\r\nfrom them.”[448]\r\n\r\n_Daniel Carroll_ favored the popular election of the executive, but he\r\nadvocated a three-fourths vote in Congress to overcome the executive\r\nveto. Speaking on this point, “He remarked that as a majority was now to\r\nbe the quorum, seventeen in the larger and eight in the smaller house\r\nmight carry points. The advantage that might be taken of this seemed to\r\ncall for greater impediments to improper laws.”[449] Carroll did not\r\nindulge in any philosophic reflections in the Convention so that his\r\n“political science,” if he had worked out any definite system, is not\r\napparent in the records.\r\n\r\n_George Clymer_ entertained the notions of government which were\r\ncommon to the Federalists of his time. He held that “a representative\r\nof the people is appointed to think _for_ and not _with_ his\r\nconstituents”;[450] and invariably, during the course of his career,\r\nhe “showed a total disregard to the opinions of his constituents when\r\nopposed to the matured decisions of his own mind.” It was on these\r\nprinciples that he “warmly opposed the proposition introducing a\r\nclause in the Constitution which conferred upon the people the\r\nunalienable right of instructing their representatives.”[451]\r\n\r\n_W. R. Davie_, although he is reputed to have been an accomplished\r\norator and profound student, does not figure extensively in Madison’s\r\nmeagre records. At no point does he expound any philosophy of\r\ngovernment. His views were always practical. On the proposition to count\r\nslaves in apportioning representation, he threw down the gauntlet to the\r\nConvention, and declared that if the rate was not at least three-fifths,\r\nNorth Carolina would not federate.[452] As to the basis of government\r\nDavie “seemed to think that wealth or property ought to be represented\r\nin the second branch; and numbers in the first branch.”[453]\r\n\r\nDavie fully understood the significance of the obligation of contract\r\nclause which was designed as a check on the propensities of popular\r\nlegislatures to assault private rights in property, particularly\r\npersonalty. Speaking in the convention of North Carolina on this clause,\r\nhe said: “That section is the best in the Constitution. It is founded on\r\nthe strongest principles of justice. It is a section, in short, which I\r\nthought would have endeared the Constitution to this country.”[454]\r\nDavie undoubtedly understood and approved the doctrines of balanced\r\nclasses in the government, as expounded in Adams’ _Defence of American\r\nConstitutions_.[455]\r\n\r\nAt no time does Davie appear to have courted popular favor in his native\r\nstate, for a writer speaking of his candidacy for the legislature in\r\n1798 says: “The ‘true Whigs,’ as they styled themselves, dined together\r\nunder the oaks and toasted Mr. Jefferson. The other party, who were\r\ncalled ‘aristocrats,’ ate and drank in the house on entirely different\r\nprinciples. General Davie dined in the house with the ‘aristocrats.’ The\r\n‘true Whigs’ took offence at this and resolved to oppose his selection,\r\nand it was only with much address that they were kept quiet.... If any\r\nperson had had the impudence to dispute the election, General Davie\r\nwould certainly not have been returned. The rabble, which in all places\r\nis the majority, would have voted against him.”[456]\r\n\r\n_John Dickinson_, of Delaware, frankly joined that minority which was\r\noutspoken in its belief in a monarchy—an action that comported with his\r\nrefusal to sign the Declaration of Independence and his reluctance to\r\nembark upon the stormy sea of Revolution. At the very opening of the\r\nConvention, on June 2, he expressed his preference for a regal\r\ngovernment, although he admitted that the existing state of affairs\r\nwould not permit its establishment in America. Madison records him as\r\nsaying: “A limited Monarchy he considered as one of the best Governments\r\nin the world. It was not certain that the same blessings were derivable\r\nfrom any other form. It was certain that equal blessings had never yet\r\nbeen derived from any of the republican form. A limited monarchy,\r\nhowever, was out of the question.”[457]\r\n\r\nDickinson was also among the members of the Convention who wished to\r\nestablish a property qualification for voters because he thought no\r\nother foundation for government would be secure. In the debate on this\r\nsubject on August 7, according to Madison’s notes: “Mr. Dickinson had a\r\nvery different idea of the tendency of vesting the right of suffrage in\r\nthe freeholders of the Country. He considered them as the best guardians\r\nof liberty; And the restriction of the right to them as a necessary\r\ndefence agst. the dangerous influence of those multitudes without\r\nproperty & without principle, with which our Country like all others,\r\nwill in time abound. As to the unpopularity of the innovation it was in\r\nhis opinion chimerical. The great mass of our Citizens is composed at\r\nthis time of freeholders, and will be pleased with it.”[458]\r\n\r\nAccording to King’s notes: “Dickinson—It is said yr. restraining by ye\r\nConstitution the rights of Election to Freeholders, is a step towards\r\naristocracy—is this true, No.—we are safe by trusting the owners of the\r\nsoil—the Owners of the Country—it will not be unpopular—because the\r\nFreeholders are the most numerous at this Time—The Danger to Free\r\nGovernments has not been from Freeholders, but those who are not\r\nFreeholders—there is no Danger—because our Laws favor the Division of\r\nproperty—The Freehold will be parcelled among all the worthy men in the\r\nState—The Merchants & Mechanicks are safe—They may become Freeholders\r\nbesides they are represented in ye State Legislatures, which elect the\r\nSenate of the U.S.”[459]\r\n\r\nNo member of the Convention distrusted anything savoring of “levelling\r\ndemocracy” more than _Oliver Ellsworth_. Later as Chief Justice he\r\ndenounced from the bench Jefferson and the French party as “the apostles\r\nof anarchy, bloodshed, and atheism.”[460] In the Convention, he opposed\r\nthe popular election of the President[461] and favored associating the\r\njudges with the executive in the exercise of a veto power over acts of\r\nCongress.[462] He believed in the restriction of the suffrage to those\r\nwho paid taxes.[463] He was a warm advocate of judicial control, in\r\ngeneral, and thoroughly understood the political significance of the\r\nsystem.[464]\r\n\r\n_Thomas Fitzsimons_, the wealthy merchant and stockbroker from\r\nPennsylvania, was, after his kind, not a loquacious man, but rather a\r\nman of action—a practical man; and the records of the Convention contain\r\nno lengthy speech by him. When Gouverneur Morris, on August 7, proposed\r\nto restrain the right to vote to freeholders, Fitzsimons seconded the\r\nmotion, apparently without saying anything on the point.[465] While he\r\nthus sympathized with the movement to set the Constitution frankly on a\r\nproperty basis, Fitzsimons was naturally more interested in such matters\r\nas protection to manufactures and harbor improvements.[466]\r\n\r\n_Benjamin Franklin_, who at the time of the Convention was so advanced\r\nin years as to be of little real weight in the formation of the\r\nConstitution, seems to have entertained a more hopeful view of democracy\r\nthan any other member of that famous group. He favored a single\r\nchambered legislature,[467] opposed an absolute veto in the\r\nexecutive,[468] and resisted the attempt to place property\r\nqualifications on the suffrage.[469] He signed the Constitution when it\r\nwas finished, but he was accounted by his contemporaries among the\r\ndoubters, and was put forward by the opponents of ratification in\r\nPennsylvania as a candidate for the state convention, but was\r\ndefeated.[470]\r\n\r\n_Elbridge Gerry_, of Massachusetts, participated extensively in the\r\ndebates of the Convention, but his general view of government was\r\ndoubtless stated in his speech on May 31, when he expressed himself as\r\nnot liking the election of members of the lower house by popular vote.\r\nHe said on this point: “The evils we experience flow from the excess of\r\ndemocracy. The people do not want virtue; but are the dupes of pretended\r\npatriots. In Massts. it has been fully confirmed by experience that they\r\nare daily misled into the most baneful measures and opinions by the\r\nfalse reports circulated by designing men, and which no one on the spot\r\ncan refute. One principal evil arises from the want of due provision for\r\nthose employed in the administration of Governnt. It would seem to be a\r\nmaxim of democracy to starve the public servants. He mentioned the\r\npopular clamour in Massts. for the reduction of salaries and the attack\r\nmade on that of the Govr. though secured by the spirit of the\r\nConstitution itself. He had, he said, been too republican heretofore: he\r\nwas still, however, republican, but had been taught by experience the\r\ndanger of the levelling spirit.”[471]\r\n\r\nWhen the proposition that Senators should be elected by the state\r\nlegislatures was up for consideration, “Mr. Gerry insisted that the\r\ncommercial and monied interest wd. be more secure in hands of the State\r\nLegislatures, than of the people at large. The former have more sense of\r\ncharacter, and will be restrained by that from injustice. The people are\r\nfor paper money when the Legislatures are agst. it. In Massts. the\r\nCounty Conventions had declared a wish for a depreciating paper that wd.\r\nsink itself. Besides, in some States there are two Branches in the\r\nLegislature, one of which is somewhat aristocratic. There wd. therefore\r\nbe so far a better chance of refinement in the choice.”[472]\r\n\r\n_Nicholas Gilman_ was by temper and interest a man of affairs, more\r\nconcerned with the stability of public securities and the development of\r\nwestern land schemes than with political theorizing. From Madison’s\r\nrecord he does not appear to have said anything in the Convention.\r\n\r\n_Nathaniel Gorham_ was opposed to property qualifications on the\r\nsuffrage in the federal Constitution and the association of the\r\njudiciary with the executive in the exercise of the veto power.[473]\r\nSpeaking on the latter point, however, he said, “All agree that a check\r\non the legislature is necessary. But there are two objections against\r\nadmitting the judges to share in it which no observations on the other\r\nside seem to obviate. The 1st is that the judges ought to carry into the\r\nexposition of the laws no prepossessions with regard to them; 2d that as\r\nthe judges will outnumber the executive, the revisionary check would be\r\nthrown entirely out of the executive hands, and instead of enabling him\r\nto defend himself would enable the judges to sacrifice him.”\r\n\r\n_Alexander Hamilton_ had a profound admiration for the British\r\nconstitution. “The House of Lords,” he said in the Convention, “is a\r\nnoble institution. Having nothing to hope for by a change and a\r\nsufficient interest by means of their property, in being faithful to the\r\nnational interest, they form a permanent barrier against every\r\npernicious innovation whether attempted on the part of the Crown or of\r\nthe Commons.”[474] Doubtless his maturely considered system of\r\ngovernment was summed up in the following words: “All communities divide\r\nthemselves into the few and the many. The first are the rich and well\r\nborn, the other the mass of the people. The voice of the people has been\r\nsaid to be the voice of God; and however generally this maxim has been\r\nquoted and believed, it is not true in fact. The people are turbulent\r\nand changing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give therefore to\r\nthe first class a distinct, permanent share in the government. They will\r\ncheck the unsteadiness of the second, and as they cannot receive any\r\nadvantage by a change, they therefore will ever maintain good\r\ngovernment. Can a democratic assembly who annually revolve in the mass\r\nof the people, be supposed steadily to pursue the public good? Nothing\r\nbut a permanent body can check the imprudence of democracy.... It is\r\nadmitted that you cannot have a good executive upon a democratic\r\nplan.”[475] In consonance with these principles Hamilton outlined his\r\nscheme of government which included an assembly to consist of persons\r\nelected for three years by popular vote, a senate chosen for life or\r\nduring good behavior by electors chosen by the voters, and a president\r\nalso elected for life or during good behavior by electors chosen by the\r\nvoters. The Convention failed to adopt his programme, and he entertained\r\na rather uncertain view of the Constitution as it was finally drafted,\r\ndoubting its stability and permanency.\r\n\r\n_William Houstoun_, of Georgia, seems to have spoken only once or twice;\r\nbut he gave an indication of his political science in a remark which he\r\nmade to the effect that the Georgia constitution “was a very bad one,\r\nand he hoped it would be revised and amended.”[476] The constitution to\r\nwhich he alludes was the radical instrument made in 1777, which provided\r\nfor a legislature with a single chamber and an unusually wide extension\r\nof the suffrage.[477]\r\n\r\n_Jared Ingersoll_, in spite of his great abilities as a student and\r\nlawyer, seems to have taken no part at all in the debates of the\r\nConvention. Such at least is the view to which Madison’s records lead.\r\nSomething is known, however, of the political principles which he\r\nentertained. Though he became intimately associated with President Reed\r\non his migration to Philadelphia in 1778, he never accepted the extreme\r\ndemocratic principles embodied in the constitution of that state in\r\n1776.[478] His biographer, after making an exception of Ingersoll’s\r\nservices in the Convention, says: “I am not aware that he held or sought\r\na position in any popular or representative body whatever. He was what\r\nis called conservative in politics; that is to say, he was not by\r\nconstitutional temper a rebuilder or reconstructor of anything that had\r\nbeen once reasonably well built; nor was his favorite order of political\r\narchitecture, the democratic. After the great subversion in 1801 he was\r\nfound as rarely as anybody in Pennsylvania on the side of the majority.\r\nHe was known to be inclined to the contrary, so far that with or without\r\nhis consent he was selected in that state, in the year 1812, as the\r\nopposition or anti-Madisonian candidate for the office of Vice-President\r\nof the United States.”[479]\r\n\r\n_Rufus King_ correctly understood the idea of a balanced government\r\nindependent of “popular whims” and endowed with plenty of strength. He\r\nfavored a long term for the President, and speaking on the executive\r\ndepartment in the Convention he “expressed his apprehensions that an\r\nextreme caution in favor of liberty might enervate the government we\r\nwere forming. He wished the house to recur to the primitive axiom that\r\nthe three great departments of governments should be separate and\r\nindependent: that the executive and the judiciary should be so, as well\r\nas the legislative: that the executive should be equally so with the\r\njudiciary.... He [the executive] ought not to be impeachable unless he\r\nhold his office during good behavior, a tenure which would be most\r\nagreeable to him; provided an independent and effectual forum could be\r\ndevised. But under no circumstances ought he to be impeachable by the\r\nlegislature. This would be destructive of his independence and of the\r\nprinciples of the constitution. He relied on the vigor of the executive\r\nas a great security for the public liberties.”[480] King also believed\r\nin the principle of judicial control—that most effective check on the\r\npopular attacks on property through legislatures.[481]\r\n\r\nIt was largely on King’s initiative that the prohibition against\r\ninterference with contracts was placed in the Constitution.[482]\r\n\r\n_William Livingston_ took a middle ground between the “high-toned”\r\nsystem of John Adams and the simple democracy of such writers as\r\n“Centinel” of Pennsylvania.[483] _The Defence of the Constitutions_ he\r\nimpatiently characterized as “rubbage”; and a “Humiliating and\r\nmortifying acknowledgement that man is incapable of governing himself.”\r\nBut for the opposite party that would set up a simple democratic\r\ngovernment through legislative majorities, Livingston had just as little\r\npatience. “The security of the liberties of a people or state depends\r\nwholly on a proper delegation of power. The several component powers of\r\ngovernment should be so distributed that no one man, or body of men,\r\nshould possess a larger share thereof than what is absolutely necessary\r\nfor the administration of government.... The people ever have been and\r\never will be unfit to retain the exercise of power in their own hands;\r\nthey must of necessity delegate it somewhere.... But it has been found\r\nfrom experience that a government by representation, consisting of a\r\nsingle house of representatives, is in some degree liable to the same\r\ninconveniences which attend a pure democracy; a few leading men\r\ninfluence the majority to pass laws calculated not for the public good,\r\nbut to promote some sinister views of their own. To prevent this,\r\nanother representative branch is added: these two separate houses form\r\nmutual checks upon each other; but this expedient has not been found to\r\nbe altogether effectual. If the legislative power, even tho’ vested in\r\ntwo distinct houses is left without any controul, they will inevitably\r\nencroach upon the executive and judicial.... But further, as prejudices\r\nalways prevail, more or less, in all popular governments, it is\r\nnecessary that a check be placed somewhere in the hands of a power not\r\nimmediately dependent upon the breath of the people, in order to stem\r\nthe torrent, and prevent the mischiefs which blind passions and\r\nrancorous prejudices might otherwise occasion. The executive and\r\njudicial powers should of course then be vested with this check or\r\ncontroul on the legislature; and that they may be enabled fully to\r\neffect this beneficial purpose, they should be rendered as independent\r\nas possible.... Tho’ it is so short a time since our governments have\r\nbeen put in motion, yet examples have not been wanting of the prevalence\r\nof this dangerous thirst after more power in some of our legislatures; a\r\nnegative therefore lodged in the hands of the executive and judicial\r\npowers, is absolutely necessary in order that they may be able to defend\r\nthemselves from the encroachments of the legislature.”[484] Livingston\r\nthought that there were some grave defects in the Constitution as\r\ndrafted at Philadelphia and proposed some emendations. He believed that\r\nthe President should enjoy the appointing power without any control by\r\nthe Senate; he thought the Chief Justice should hold office during good\r\nbehavior and be empowered to appoint his colleagues; and he further held\r\nthat the President, the Chief Justice, and a Superintendent of Finance\r\nshould be organized into a council of revision to pass upon the acts of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n_James McClurg_, of Virginia, left the Convention during the early part\r\nof August, and was silent on most of the questions before that body. On\r\nJuly 17th, he proposed that the term of the executive should be changed\r\nfrom seven years to “good behavior”;[485] and he was particularly\r\nanxious to have the executive independent of the legislature. He said\r\nthat he “was not so much afraid of the shadow of monarchy as to be\r\nunwilling to approach it; nor so wedded to republican government as not\r\nto be sensible of the tyrannies that had been and may be exercised under\r\nthat form. It was an essential object with him to make the executive\r\nindependent of the legislature; and the only mode left for effecting it,\r\nafter the vote destroying his ineligibility the second time, was to\r\nappoint him during good behavior.”[486] That McClurg had small respect\r\nfor legislatures in general is shown by a letter which he wrote to\r\nMadison from Virginia on August 7, 1787, in which he said: “The\r\nnecessity of some independent power to controul the Assembly by a\r\nnegative, seems now to be admitted by the most zealous Republicans—they\r\nonly differ about the mode of constituting such a power. B. Randolph\r\nseems to think that a magistrate annually elected by the people might\r\nexercise such a controul as independently as the King of G. B. I hope\r\nthat our representative, Marshall, will be a powerful aid to Mason in\r\nthe next Assembly. He has observ’d the continual depravation of Mens\r\nmanners, under the corrupting influence of our Legislature; & is\r\nconvinc’d that nothing but the adoption of some efficient plan from the\r\nConvention can prevent Anarchy first, & civil convulsions\r\nafterwards.”[487]\r\n\r\n_James McHenry_ belonged to the conservative party of his state and\r\nopposed “radical alterations” in the constitution of that commonwealth\r\nas it stood in November, 1791.[488]\r\n\r\nWriting in February, 1787, on the property qualifications placed on\r\nvoters and representatives in Maryland, McHenry explained that\r\n“These disabilities, exclusions, and qualifications have for their\r\nobject an upright legislature, endowed with faculties to judge of\r\nthe things most proper to promote the public good.” He was warmly\r\nopposed to the doctrine that the people had a right to instruct\r\ntheir representatives.[489] Democracy was, in his opinion,\r\nsynonymous with “confusion and licentiousness.”[490]\r\n\r\n_James Madison_ was the systematic philosopher of the Convention and set\r\nforth his views with such cogency and consistency on so many different\r\ntopics that no short quotations will suffice to state his doctrines. His\r\ngeneral scheme of political science was, however, embodied in the tenth\r\nnumber of _The Federalist_ which has been discussed above and need not\r\nbe reconsidered here.[491]\r\n\r\n_Alexander Martin_ was among the silent members of the Convention, for\r\nMadison records only an occasional and incidental participation by him\r\nin the proceedings.\r\n\r\n_Luther Martin_ was the champion of the extreme states’ rights’ view,\r\nand entertained rather democratic notions for his time, although, in\r\narguing against the clause prohibiting Congress to issue paper money, he\r\nheld that, “considering the administration of the government would be\r\nprincipally in the hands of the wealthy,” there could be little danger\r\nfrom an abuse of this power. Martin was in fact a champion of paper\r\nmoney in his state, and he opposed that part of the Constitution which\r\nprohibited the emission of bills of credit. As a representative of the\r\nmore radical section of his community, he was against the clauses\r\nrestricting the states to the use of the gold and silver coin of the\r\nUnited States, and was opposed to the clause forbidding the impairment\r\nof the obligation of contract. Speaking on the latter point he said:\r\n“There might be times of such great public calamities and distress, and\r\nof such extreme scarcity of specie, as should render it the duty of a\r\ngovernment for the preservation of even the most valuable part of its\r\ncitizens in some measure to interfere in their favor, by passing laws\r\ntotally or partially stopping the courts of justice, or authorizing the\r\ndebtor to pay by installments, or by delivering up his property to his\r\ncreditors at a reasonable and honest valuation. The times have been such\r\nas to render regulations of this kind necessary in most or all of the\r\nstates, to prevent the wealthy creditor and the moneyed man from totally\r\ndestroying the poor, though even industrious debtor. Such times may\r\nagain arrive.... I apprehend, Sir, the principal cause of complaint\r\namong the people at large, is the public and private debt with which\r\nthey are oppressed, and which in the present scarcity of cash threatens\r\nthem with destruction, unless they can obtain so much indulgence in\r\npoint of time that by industry and frugality they may extricate\r\nthemselves.”[492]\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, a man entertaining such radical notions\r\nabout the power and duty of a government to interfere with the rights of\r\npersonalty in behalf of the debtor could not have accepted the\r\ninstrument framed at Philadelphia. In fact, Martin refused to sign the\r\nConstitution; he wrote a vehement protest against it to the legislature\r\nof his state; he worked assiduously against its ratification; and as a\r\nmember of the state convention, he voted against its approval by his\r\ncommonwealth—but in vain.\r\n\r\n_George Mason_ thoroughly understood the doctrine of a balanced\r\ngovernment. Speaking in the Convention on the function of the upper\r\nhouse, he said: “One important object in constituting the senate was to\r\nsecure the rights of property. To give them weight and firmness for this\r\npurpose a considerable duration in office was thought necessary. But a\r\nlonger term than six years would be of no avail in this respect, if\r\nneedy persons should be appointed. He suggested therefore the propriety\r\nof annexing to the office a qualification of property. He thought this\r\nwould be very practicable; as the rules of taxation would supply a scale\r\nfor measuring the degree of wealth possessed by every man.”[493] On\r\nanother occasion, he presented a motion requiring “certain\r\nqualifications of landed property, in members of the legislature.”[494]\r\nAlthough Mason refused to sign the Constitution, his reasons were based\r\non personal economic interests, not on any objections to its checks on\r\ndemocratic legislatures.[495]\r\n\r\n_J. F. Mercer_, of Maryland, who opposed the Constitution in its final\r\nform and became the belligerent anti-federalist leader in that state,\r\ndoes not appear to have been so warmly devoted to the “people’s cause,”\r\nbehind the closed doors of the Convention, for he took exceptions to the\r\nproposition that the determination of the qualifications of voters\r\nshould be left to the several states. But his particular objection was\r\n“to the mode of election by the people. The people cannot know and judge\r\nof the characters of candidates. The worst possible choice will be\r\nmade.”[496]\r\n\r\n_Thomas Mifflin_ took no part worthy of mention in the proceedings of\r\nthe Convention, and expounded no views of government during the debates.\r\n\r\n_Gouverneur Morris_, of Pennsylvania, was the leader of those who wanted\r\nto base the new system upon a freehold suffrage qualification; and, on\r\nAugust 7, he made a motion to this effect. In the course of the\r\ndiscussion which followed, Morris said: “He had long learned not to be\r\nthe dupe of words. The sound of Aristocracy, therefore, had no effect on\r\nhim. It was the thing, not the name, to which he was opposed, and one of\r\nhis principal objections to the Constitution as it is now before us, is\r\nthat it threatens this Country with an Aristocracy. The Aristocracy will\r\ngrow out of the House of Representatives. Give the votes to people who\r\nhave no property, and they will sell them to the rich who will be able\r\nto buy them. We should not confine our attention to the present moment.\r\nThe time is not distant when this Country will abound with mechanics &\r\nmanufacturers who will receive their bread from their employers. Will\r\nsuch men be the secure & faithful Guardians of liberty? Will they be the\r\nimpregnable barrier agst. aristocracy?—He was as little duped by the\r\nassociation of the words, ‘taxation & Representation’—The man who does\r\nnot give his vote freely is not represented. It is the man who dictates\r\nthe vote. Children do not vote. Why? because they want prudence, because\r\nthey have no will of their own. The ignorant & the dependent can be as\r\nlittle trusted with the public interest. He did not conceive the\r\ndifficulty of defining ‘freeholders’ to be insuperable. Still less that\r\nthe restriction could be unpopular. 9/10 of the people are at present\r\nfreeholders and these will certainly be pleased with it. As to Merchts.\r\n&c. if they have wealth & value the right they can acquire it. If not\r\nthey don’t deserve it.”[497]\r\n\r\nIn all the proceedings of the Convention, Morris took a deep interest\r\nand expressed his views freely, always showing his thorough distrust of\r\ndemocratic institutions. As his biographer, Mr. Roosevelt puts it, “He\r\nthroughout appears as the _advocatus diaboli_; he puts the lowest\r\ninterpretation upon every act, and frankly avows his disbelief in all\r\ngenerous and unselfish motives. His continual allusions to the\r\noverpowering influence of the baser passions, and to their mastery of\r\nthe human race at all times, drew from Madison, although the two men\r\ngenerally acted together, a protest against his ‘forever inculcating the\r\nutter political depravity of men, and the necessity of opposing one vice\r\nand interest as the only possible check to another vice and\r\ninterest.’”[498] This protest from Madison, however, betrays\r\ninconsistency, for on more than one occasion in the Convention he\r\nexpounded principles substantially identical with those which he\r\nreprobated in Morris.[499] Indeed, what appeared to be cynical\r\neccentricity on the part of the latter was nothing more than unusual\r\nbluntness in setting forth Federalist doctrines.\r\n\r\n_Robert Morris_, the merchant prince and speculator of Pennsylvania,\r\nseems to have broken his rule of absolute silence only two or three\r\ntimes in the Convention, and he apparently made no speech at all. He\r\nnominated Washington as president of the assembly, and seconded Read’s\r\nmotion that Senators should hold office during good behavior.[500] There\r\nis no doubt that Morris appreciated the relative weight of speeches and\r\nprivate negotiations.[501]\r\n\r\nIn the proceedings of the Convention, _William Paterson_ was chiefly\r\nconcerned with protecting the rights of small states; but he signed the\r\nConstitution, and after its adoption became an ardent Federalist,\r\nserving as an associate justice of the Supreme Court. On the bench he\r\nwas one of the most scholarly and eminent supporters of the doctrine of\r\njudicial control over legislation.[502]\r\n\r\n_William Pierce_ took little part in the proceedings of the Convention.\r\nOn the question of states’ rights he held a broad view, saying, “state\r\ndistinctions must be sacrificed so far as the general government shall\r\nrender it necessary—without, however, destroying them altogether.\r\nAlthough I am here as a representative from a small state, I consider\r\nmyself as a citizen of the United States, whose general interest I will\r\nalways support.”[503] On no occasion, apparently, did Pierce indulge in\r\nany general reflections on the basis of all government. He did not sign\r\nthe Constitution, but he explained this fact by saying, “I was absent in\r\nNew York on a piece of business so necessary that it became unavoidable.\r\nI approve of its principles and would have signed it with all my heart\r\nhad I been present. To say, however, that I consider it as perfect would\r\nbe to make an acknowledgement immediately opposed to my judgment.”[504]\r\n\r\n_Charles Pinckney_ was among the members of the Convention who thought\r\nthat it was desirable to fix the property qualifications of members of\r\nthe national legislature firmly in the Constitution. Speaking on the\r\nsubject of property and government he said: “The Committee as he had\r\nconceived were instructed to report the proper qualifications of\r\nproperty for the members of the Natl. Legislature; instead of which they\r\nhave referred the task to the Natl. Legislature itself. Should it be\r\nleft on this footing, the first Legislature will meet without any\r\nparticular qualifications of property; and if it should happen to\r\nconsist of rich men they might fix such qualifications as may be too\r\nfavorable to the rich; if of poor men, an opposite extreme might be run\r\ninto. He was opposed to the establishment of an undue aristocratic\r\ninfluence in the Constitution, but he thought it essential that the\r\nmembers of the Legislature, the Executive, and the Judges—should be\r\npossessed of competent property to make them independent & respectable.\r\nIt was prudent when such great powers were to be trusted to connect the\r\ntie of property with that of reputation in securing a faithful\r\nadministration. The Legislature would have the fate of the Nation put\r\ninto their hands. The President would also have a very great influence\r\non it. The Judges would have not only important causes between Citizen &\r\nCitizen but also where foreigners were concerned. They will even be the\r\nUmpires between the U. States and individual States as well as between\r\none State & another. Were he to fix the quantum of property which should\r\nbe required, he should not think of less than one hundred thousand\r\ndollars for the President, half of that sum for each of the Judges, and\r\nin like proportion for the members of the Natl. Legislature. He would\r\nhowever leave the sum blank. His motion was that the President of the U.\r\nS., the Judges, and members of the Legislature should be required to\r\nswear that they were respectively possessed of a clear unincumbered\r\nEstate to the amount of —— in the case of the President, &c &c—”[505]\r\n\r\nPinckney, in fact, had no confidence in popular government, for on March\r\n28, 1788, he wrote to Madison: “Are you not ... abundantly impressed\r\nthat the theoretical nonsense of an election of Congress by the people\r\nin the first instance is clearly and practically wrong, that it will in\r\nthe end be the means of bringing our councils into contempt.”[506]\r\n\r\n_General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney_ entertained views with regard to\r\nthe special position that should be enjoyed by property, which were\r\nsubstantially identical with those held by his cousin. He proposed that\r\nno salary should be paid to members of the Senate. As this branch, he\r\nsaid, “was meant to represent the wealth of the country, it ought to be\r\ncomposed of persons of wealth; and if no allowance was to be made the\r\nwealthy alone would undertake the service.”[507] General Pinckney also\r\nwished to extend property qualifications not only to members of the\r\nlegislature, but also to the executive and judicial departments.[508]\r\n\r\n_Edmund Randolph_ was not only fully aware of the distress to which\r\nproperty had been put under the Articles of Confederation, but he also\r\nunderstood the elements of a “balanced” government. Speaking on the\r\nsubject of the structure of the Senate, he said: “If he was to give an\r\nopinion as to the number of the second branch, he should say that it\r\nought to be much smaller than that of the first, so small as to be\r\nexempt from the passionate proceedings to which numerous assemblies are\r\nliable. He observed that the general object was to provide a cure for\r\nthe evils under which the U. S. Laboured; that in tracing these evils to\r\ntheir origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of\r\ndemocracy: that some check therefore was to be sought for agst. this\r\ntendency of our governments: and that a good Senate seemed most likely\r\nto answer the purpose.... Mr. Randolph was for the term of 7 years. The\r\nDemocratic licentiousness of the State Legislatures proved the necessity\r\nof a firm Senate. The object of this 2d. branch is to controul the\r\ndemocratic branch of the Natl. Legislature. If it be not a firm body,\r\nthe other branch being more numerous, and coming immediately from the\r\npeople, will overwhelm it. The Senate of Maryland constituted on like\r\nprinciples had been scarcely able to stem the popular torrent. No\r\nmischief can be apprehended, as the concurrence of the other branch, and\r\nin some measure, of the Executive, will in all cases be necessary. A\r\nfirmness & independence may be the more necessary also in this branch,\r\nas it ought to guard the Constitution agst. encroachments of the\r\nExecutive who will be apt to form combinations with the demagogues of\r\nthe popular branch.”[509]\r\n\r\n_George Read_ was most outspoken in his desire to see the Articles of\r\nConfederation completely discarded. He said that “he was against\r\npatching up the old federal system: he hoped the idea would be\r\ndismissed. It would be like putting new cloth on an old garment. The\r\nConfederation was founded on temporary principles. It cannot last; it\r\ncannot be amended.”[510] He favored vesting an absolute veto power in\r\nthe executive;[511] and he proposed that Senators should hold office\r\nduring good behavior.[512]\r\n\r\n_John Rutledge_ held that the apportionment of representatives should be\r\non a basis of wealth and population.[513] He favored a property\r\nqualification for the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\ndepartments;[514] and he thought that Senators should not be paid.[515]\r\nIn fact, he was one of the most ardent champions of the rights of\r\nproperty in government in the Convention. He was strictly opposed to the\r\nintroduction of sentimental considerations in politics, for, speaking on\r\nan aspect of slavery and the Constitution, he said: “Religion & humanity\r\nhad nothing to do with this question—Interest alone is the governing\r\nprinciple with Nations—The true question at present is whether the\r\nSouthn. States shall or shall not be parties to the Union. If the\r\nNorthern States consult their interests they will not oppose the\r\nincrease of Slaves which will increase the commodities of which they\r\nwill become the carriers.”[516]\r\n\r\n_Roger Sherman_ believed in reducing the popular influence in the new\r\ngovernment to the minimum. When it was proposed that the members of the\r\nfirst branch of the national legislature should be elected, Sherman said\r\nthat he was “opposed to the election by the people, insisting that it\r\nought to be by the state legislatures. The people, he said, immediately\r\nshould have as little to do as may be about the government. They want\r\ninformation and are constantly liable to be misled.”[517]\r\n\r\n_Richard Dobbs Spaight_ does not seem to have made any very lengthy\r\nspeeches in the Convention, but his occasional motions show that he was\r\nnot among those who believed in “frequent recurrence to the people.” On\r\nSeptember 6, he moved that the length of the President’s term be\r\nincreased to seven years, and finding this lost he attempted to\r\nsubstitute six years for four.[518] Spaight was the one member of the\r\nConvention, however, who came out clearly and denounced judicial\r\ncontrol;[519] but he nevertheless proved a stout champion of the\r\nConstitution in North Carolina—defending it warmly against charges to\r\nthe effect that it was aristocratic in character.[520]\r\n\r\n_Caleb Strong_ carried into the Convention the old Massachusetts\r\ntradition in favor of frequent elections. He favored a one year term for\r\nrepresentatives,[521] voted against a seven year term for\r\nPresident,[522] and also opposed a seven year term for Senators.[523] He\r\nsupported the Constitution, however, in his native state, and was a\r\nmember of the convention that ratified it.\r\n\r\n_George Washington’s_ part in the proceedings of the Convention was\r\nalmost negligible, and it does not appear that in public document or\r\nprivate letter he ever set forth any coherent theory of government. When\r\nhe had occasion to dwell upon the nature of the new system he indulged\r\nin the general language of the bench rather than that of the penetrating\r\nobserver. For example, in his Farewell Address, which was written\r\nlargely by Hamilton, he spoke of the government’s being “the offspring\r\nof our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full\r\ninvestigation, and mature deliberation, completely free in its\r\nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with\r\nenergy.”[524] He feared, however, the type of politics represented by\r\nthe Democratic Societies which sprang up during his administration, and\r\nlooked upon criticism of the government as akin to sedition.[525] Like\r\nJefferson, he also viewed with apprehension the growth of an urban\r\npopulation, for in a letter to La Fayette at the time of the French\r\nRevolution, he said, “The tumultuous populace of large cities are ever\r\nto be dreaded. Their indiscriminate violence prostrates for the time all\r\npublic authority.”[526]\r\n\r\n_Hugh Williamson_ was against placing property qualifications on voters\r\nfor members of Congress;[527] and he was opposed to the association of\r\nthe judges with the executive in the exercise of the veto power.[528] He\r\npreferred to insert a provision requiring a two-thirds vote for every\r\n“effective act of the legislature.”[529] He was, however, an opponent of\r\nthe paper money party in North Carolina[530] and in the Convention he\r\nsupported a proposition forbidding the states to pass ex post facto\r\nlaws, on the ground that “the judges can take hold of it.”[531]\r\n\r\n_James Wilson_ was among the philosophers of the period who had\r\nseriously pondered on politics in its historical and practical aspects.\r\nIn the Convention he took a democratic view on several matters. He\r\nfavored the annual election of representatives by the people,[532] he\r\nadvocated the popular election of United States Senators,[533] and he\r\nbelieved also in the popular election of the President.[534] He\r\nfurthermore opposed the proposition to place property qualifications on\r\nvoters.[535] His check on popular legislation was to be found in\r\njudicial control, at first in the association of the judges with the\r\nexecutive in its exercise, and later in its simple, direct form.[536] In\r\nfact, Wilson shared the apprehensions of his colleagues as to the\r\ndangers of democratic legislatures, though he did not frankly advocate\r\ndirect property checks.[537] He doubtless believed that judicial control\r\nwould be sufficient.\r\n\r\n_George Wythe_ was a representative of the old school of lawyers in\r\nVirginia, and he was a profound student of historical jurisprudence,\r\nalthough he apparently made no attempt to apply his learning to any of\r\nthe general political questions before the Convention. He was a warm\r\nadvocate of the doctrine of judicial control and gave practical effect\r\nto principles while on the bench in Virginia.[538]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion seems warranted that the authors of _The Federalist_\r\ngeneralized the political doctrines of the members of the Convention\r\nwith a high degree of precision, in spite of the great diversity of\r\nopinion which prevailed on many matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n                      THE PROCESS OF RATIFICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 17th day of September, 1787, the Convention at Philadelphia\r\nfinished its work and transmitted the new Constitution to Congress, with\r\nthe suggestion that “it should afterwards be submitted to a convention\r\nof delegates chosen in each state by the people thereof, under the\r\nrecommendation of its legislature for their assent and ratification; and\r\nthat each convention assenting to and ratifying the same should give\r\nnotice thereof to the United States in Congress assembled.” The\r\nPhiladelphia Convention further proposed that when nine states had\r\nratified the new instrument, it should go into effect as between the\r\nstates ratifying the same. Eleven days later, on September 28, the\r\nCongress, then sitting in New York, resolved to accept the advice of the\r\nConvention, and sent the Constitution to the state legislatures to be\r\ntransmitted by them to conventions chosen by the voters of the\r\nrespective commonwealths.\r\n\r\nThis whole process was a departure from the provisions of the then\r\nfundamental law of the land—the Articles of Confederation—which provided\r\nthat all alterations and amendments should be made by Congress and\r\nreceive the approval of the legislature of every state. If to-day the\r\nCongress of the United States should call a national convention to\r\n“revise” the Constitution, and such a convention should throw away the\r\nexisting instrument of government entirely and submit a new frame of\r\ngovernment to a popular referendum, disregarding altogether the process\r\nof amendment now provided, we should have something analogous to the\r\ngreat political transformation of 1787–89. The revolutionary nature of\r\nthe work of the Philadelphia Convention is correctly characterized by\r\nProfessor John W. Burgess when he states that had such acts been\r\nperformed by Julius or Napoleon, they would have been pronounced _coups\r\nd’état_.[539]\r\n\r\nThis revolutionary plan of procedure was foreshadowed in the Virginia\r\nproposals at the opening of the Convention, and was, therefore,\r\ncontemplated by some of the leaders from the beginning. When it was\r\nunder consideration on June 5, Sherman, of Connecticut, opposed it on\r\nthe ground that it was unnecessary and that regular provisions were\r\nalready made in the Articles for amendments. Madison wanted to establish\r\nthe Constitution on some foundation other than mere legislative\r\napproval. Gerry “observed that in the Eastern states the Confederation\r\nhad been sanctioned by the people themselves. He seemed afraid of\r\nreferring the new system to them. The people in that quarter have, at\r\nthis time, the wildest ideas of government in the world. They were for\r\nabolishing the senate in Massachusetts.” King thought that “a convention\r\nbeing a single house, the adoption may be more easily carried through it\r\nthan through the legislatures where there are several branches. The\r\nlegislatures also being to lose power will be most likely to raise\r\nobjections.”[540]\r\n\r\nOn July 23 the resolution regarding ratification came before the\r\nConvention again for discussion,[541] when it was moved that the\r\nConstitution be referred to the state legislatures. One of the principal\r\nobjections urged against this plan was the possibility of a later\r\nlegislature’s repealing the ratification by a preceding body of the same\r\nauthority; but the chief problem was whether there was more likelihood\r\nof securing a confirmation by legislatures or by conventions. “Whose\r\nopposition will be most likely to be excited against the system?” asked\r\nRandolph. “That of the local demagogues who will be degraded by it from\r\nthe importance they now hold. These will spare no efforts to impede that\r\nprogress in the popular mind which will be necessary to the adoption of\r\nthe plan.... It is of great importance, therefore, that the\r\nconsideration of this subject should be transferred from the\r\nlegislatures where this class of men have their full influence to a\r\nfield in which their efforts can be less mischievous. It is, moreover,\r\nworthy of consideration that some of the states are averse to any change\r\nin their constitution, and will not take the requisite steps unless\r\nexpressly called upon to refer the question to the people.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gorham, of Massachusetts, was of the same opinion. He “was against\r\nreferring the plan to the legislatures. 1. Men chosen by the people for\r\nthe particular purpose will discuss the subject more candidly than\r\nmembers of the legislature who are to lose the power which is to be\r\ngiven up to the general government. 2. Some of the legislatures are\r\ncomposed of several branches. It will consequently be more difficult in\r\nthese cases to get the plan through the legislatures than through a\r\nconvention. 3. In the states many of the ablest men are excluded from\r\nthe legislatures, but may be elected into a convention. Among these may\r\nbe ranked many of the clergy who are generally friends to good\r\ngovernment.... 4. The legislatures will be interrupted with a variety of\r\nlittle business; by artfully pressing which, designing men will find\r\nmeans to delay from year to year, if not to frustrate altogether, the\r\nnational system. 5. If the last article of the Confederation is to be\r\npursued the unanimous concurrence of the states will be necessary.”\r\n\r\nIn the Convention, Ellsworth preferred to trust the legislatures rather\r\nthan popularly elected conventions. “He thought more was to be expected\r\nfrom the legislatures than from the people. The prevailing wish of the\r\npeople in the eastern states is to get rid of the public debt; and the\r\nidea of strengthening the national government carries with it that of\r\nstrengthening the public debt.” After the plan of ratification by\r\nconventions was carried in spite of Ellsworth’s objections, he defended\r\nit in his appeal to the populace by saying: “It proves the honesty and\r\npatriotism of the gentlemen who composed the general Convention, that\r\nthey chose to submit their system to the people rather than to the\r\nlegislatures, whose decisions are often influenced by men in the higher\r\ndepartments of government, who have provided well for themselves and\r\ndread any change least they should be injured by its operation. I would\r\nnot wish to exclude from a state convention those gentlemen who compose\r\nthe higher branches of the assemblies in the several states, but choose\r\nto see them stand on an even floor with their brethren, where the\r\nartifice of a small number cannot negative a vast majority of the\r\npeople. This danger was foreseen by the federal convention and they have\r\nwisely avoided it by appealing directly to the people.”[542]\r\n\r\nA study of the opinions of the members of the Convention shows that four\r\nleading reasons led to the agreement on ratification by state\r\nconventions. It permitted the disregard of the principle of unanimous\r\napproval by the states. A firmer foundation would be laid for the\r\nConstitution if it had the sanction of special conventions rather than\r\ntemporary legislatures. One of the first objects of the Constitution was\r\nto restrict the authority of state legislatures, and it could hardly be\r\nexpected that they would voluntarily commit suicide. Another leading\r\npurpose of the Convention was to pay the public debt at par, and the\r\nmembers had learned from the repeated appeals to the state legislatures\r\nfor funds to meet this national obligation that no relief was to be\r\nexpected from this source. There was a better chance of getting the\r\nright kind of citizens elected to a convention than to a legislature. By\r\nseparating the election of delegates to state conventions from the\r\nelection of members to the state legislatures, the supporters of the\r\nConstitution were better able to concentrate their campaign of\r\neducation. As for the provision of the Articles of Confederation\r\nrequiring the approval of every state for any amendment in the Articles,\r\nthe urgent necessities of the advocates of the new system could not\r\npermit such a mere technicality to stand in their way.\r\n\r\nThe question of their legal right to cast aside their instructions and\r\ndraft a totally new instrument was more or less troublesome for those\r\nwho entertained a strict regard for the observance of the outward signs\r\nof propriety. No doubt the instructions of the delegations from the\r\nseveral states limited them to the “revision” of the Articles of\r\nConfederation, and it is highly improbable that in the state of public\r\ntemper then prevailing a Convention would have assembled at all if its\r\nrevolutionary purposes had been understood. During the debates behind\r\nclosed doors Mr. Paterson declared that the delegates were bound by\r\ntheir instructions, but Randolph replied that “he was not scrupulous on\r\nthe point of power”; and Hamilton agreed with this view saying, “We owed\r\nit to our country to do on this emergency whatever we should deem\r\nessential to its happiness. The states sent us here to provide for the\r\nexigencies of the union. To rely on and propose any plan not adequate to\r\nthese exigencies merely because it was not clearly within our powers\r\nwould be to sacrifice the means to the end.”[543]\r\n\r\nOutside the halls of the Convention it also became necessary to defend\r\nthis revolutionary departure from their instructions. Madison took up\r\nthe cause in _The Federalist_[544] and made out an unanswerable case for\r\nhis side, frankly pleading the justification of revolution if the legal\r\narguments which he advanced were deemed insufficient.\r\n\r\nAt the outset he is unwilling to admit that the Convention had broken\r\nwith its instructions and performed a revolutionary act. He,\r\naccordingly, puts forward a legal and moral justification first, based\r\nupon an analysis of the instructions of the delegates. They were bound,\r\nhe shows, to make such revisions in the Articles as would render them\r\nadequate to the exigencies of the union; but an adequate government, he\r\npleads, could not be made by revising the Articles, and the Convention\r\nwas either compelled to sacrifice the greater for the less by strictly\r\nobeying its instructions or to do its whole duty by sacrificing the\r\nletter of the law. Then he clinches the argument: “Let them declare\r\nwhether it was of most importance to the happiness of the people of\r\nAmerica that the Articles of Confederation should be disregarded and an\r\nadequate government be provided and the Union preserved; or that an\r\nadequate government should be omitted and the Articles of Confederation\r\npreserved.”\r\n\r\nBut Madison, after having paid his respects to Legality, hastens to add\r\nthat in all great changes in government “forms ought to give way to\r\nsubstance.” A rigid adherence to mere technicalities “would render\r\nnominal and nugatory the transcendent and precious right of the people\r\n‘to abolish or alter their governments as to them shall seem most likely\r\nto effect their safety and happiness.’” That is, the right of revolution\r\nis, at bottom, the justification for all great political changes. If it\r\nis argued that this right of revolution should not be exercised by a\r\nsmall group of men, such as the Convention of fifty-odd delegates at\r\nPhiladelphia, Madison replies that it is impossible for the whole people\r\nto move forward in concert, and “it is therefore essential that such\r\nchanges be instituted by some informal and unauthorized propositions\r\nmade by some patriotic and respectable citizen or number of citizens.”\r\nThis was the manner in which the recent revolt against England was\r\ncarried out; and in the present case the people had the right to pass\r\nupon the work of the Philadelphia assembly.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the Constitution were able to see the significance of\r\nthat clause of the Constitution which cast aside the legal system under\r\nwhich they were living and provided that the new instrument should go\r\ninto effect when ratified by nine states—as between those states.\r\n“Cornelius,” in Massachusetts, exhibited great anxiety on this point,\r\nand in his letters of December 11 and 18, 1787, he asked concerning this\r\ndeparture: “Will not the adoption of this constitution in the manner\r\nhere prescribed be justly considered as a perfidious violation of that\r\nfundamental and solemn compact by which the United States hold an\r\nexistence and claim to be a people? If a nation may so easily discharge\r\nitself from obligations to abide by its most solemn and fundamental\r\ncompacts, may it not with still greater ease do the same in matters of\r\nless importance? And if nations may set the example, may not particular\r\nstates, citizens, and subjects follow? What then will become of public\r\nand private faith? Where is the ground of allegiance that is due to\r\ngovernment? Are not the bonds of civil society dissolved? Or is\r\nallegiance founded only in power? Has moral obligation no place in civil\r\ngovernment? In mutual compacts can one party be bound while the other is\r\nfree? Or, can one party disannul such compact, without the consent of\r\nthe other? If so, constitutions and national compacts are, I conceive,\r\nof no avail; and oaths of allegiance must be preposterous things.”[545]\r\n\r\nOn all hands the “unconstitutional” procedure of the Convention was\r\nattacked by the Anti-Federalists. “A system of consolidation,” says\r\nanother writer, “has been formed with the most profound secrecy and\r\nwithout the least authority: And has been suddenly and without any\r\nprevious notice transmitted by the federal convention for\r\nratification—Congress not disposed to give any opinion on the plan, have\r\ntransmitted it to the legislatures—The legislatures have followed the\r\nexample and sent it to the people. The people of this state, unassisted\r\nby Congress or their legislature, have not had time to investigate the\r\nsubject, have referred to the newspapers for information, have been\r\ndivided by contending writers, and under such circumstances have elected\r\nmembers for the state convention—and these members are to consider\r\nwhether they will accept the plan of the federal convention, with all\r\nits imperfections, and bind the people by a system of government, of the\r\nnature and principles of which they have not at present a clearer idea\r\nthan they have of the Copernican system.”[546]\r\n\r\nWhatever was thought of the merits of the controversy over the proposed\r\nplan of ratification, it was accepted by the state legislatures which\r\nwere invited by Congress to transmit the Constitution to special\r\nconventions. It remains to inquire, therefore, what methods were\r\nemployed in calling these conventions and setting the seal of approval\r\non the new and revolutionary proposals of the Philadelphia assembly.\r\n\r\nThe resolution calling the convention in New Hampshire to pass upon the\r\nfederal Constitution was adopted by the legislature on December 14,\r\n1787. The time for holding the elections was left to the selectmen of\r\nthe several towns, who were instructed to warn the duly qualified voters\r\nof the event. The date for the meeting of the convention was fixed on\r\nthe second Wednesday of February, 1788.[547] Four hundred copies of the\r\nConstitution were ordered to be printed for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe elections seem to have been held about mid-January, for the New\r\nHampshire Spy, for January 25, 1788, contains a long list of delegates\r\nalready chosen, and adds that “several of the towns not mentioned in the\r\nabove list were to have had their meetings this week.”\r\n\r\nA majority of the members of the state convention so chosen, writes a\r\nstudent, who has inquired into the personnel of that body, “were\r\nundoubtedly opposed to the Constitution.... The talent of the convention\r\nwas decidedly on the side of the Federalists and a majority of the\r\nablest members were in favor of ratification.... For a time the friends\r\nof the Constitution had hopes of securing its ratification without a\r\nrecess of the convention. Although the greater number of the members\r\nfrom the upper part of the state came down rather opposed to its\r\nadoption, yet on the final question it was hoped that a majority would\r\nbe found to favor it. But these hopes proved delusive. While some of the\r\nmembers who came to the convention instructed to vote against the\r\nConstitution had been led by the discussions to a change of opinion and\r\nnow favored it, they still felt bound by their instructions, and frankly\r\nsaid that if a final vote was to be taken before they had an opportunity\r\nto consult their constituents their vote would be adverse to\r\nratification.”[548] Under these circumstances the Federalists adjourned\r\nthe convention and set to work to convert the enemy. When the convention\r\nreassembled a few months later, they were able to carry the day by the\r\nuncomfortably small margin of 57 to 47.[549]\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts the Federalists lost no time in moving for a\r\nconvention. As early as October 20, 1787, they carried a favorable\r\nresolution in the senate of the state, and secured the concurrence of\r\nthe house four days later. This resolve provided that the delegates\r\nshould be chosen by those inhabitants “qualified by law to vote in the\r\nelection of representatives,” and the elections should take place “as\r\nsoon as may be” in the several towns and districts. The date for the\r\nmeeting of the delegates was fixed as the second Wednesday in January\r\nnext. On January 9, 1788, the Convention met at Boston; and a real\r\nbattle of wits ensued.\r\n\r\nAs in New Hampshire, the delegates, when they came together fresh from\r\ntheir constituents, appeared to be opposed to adopting the new\r\ninstrument of government. A careful scholar, who has studied the period\r\nintensively, takes this view: “Had a vote been taken on the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution as soon as the convention assembled, there can be no\r\nquestion but that it would have been overwhelmingly against the proposed\r\nplan.”[550]\r\n\r\nEven after powerful influences had been brought to bear, the margin for\r\nthe Federalists was uncomfortably close—187 to 168. Harding remarks:\r\n“The majority in favor of ratification, it will be seen was only\r\nnineteen. The nine delegates whose names were returned to the\r\nconvention, but who were not present when the vote was taken, might\r\nalmost have turned the scale in the other direction. Bearing in mind\r\nthat it was mainly the Antifederalist towns that were unrepresented, it\r\nmay be safely asserted that out of the forty-six delinquent corporations\r\nthere were enough which were Antifederalist to have procured the\r\nrejection of the constitution. This calculation, however, is based on\r\nthe assumption that a corresponding increase did not take place in the\r\nFederalist representation. Had all the towns entitled to send\r\nrepresentatives done so, and had all the delegates been present to cast\r\ntheir votes, it is probable that the final result would not have been\r\nchanged, though the Federalist majority would have been cut down to\r\nscarcely more than a bare half-dozen.”[551]\r\n\r\nAfter turning over the debates in the Massachusetts convention, one can\r\nscarcely escape the conclusion that the victory in eloquence, logic, and\r\npure argumentation lay on the side of the Federalists; and it would not\r\nbe worth while to consider at all the charges that improper influence\r\nwas brought to bear on the delegates, were it not for the fact that they\r\nwere made at the time and have lasted in the literature on the\r\nratification in Massachusetts. We have “the sober assertion of a\r\nreputable historical writer within the last thirty years” to the effect\r\n“that enough members of the Massachusetts convention were bought with\r\nmoney from New York to secure the ratification of the new system by\r\nMassachusetts.”[552] Harding, after making an examination of the\r\ncharges, dismissed them as “baseless”; and quite properly, for whoever\r\nwould convict men of such high standing in the community as King,\r\nGorham, and Strong of being associated with such a reprehensible\r\ntransaction should produce more than mere unsubstantiated evidence.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Connecticut, determined not to be behindhand in\r\nsetting the approval of the state on the new instrument, called a\r\nconvention on October 11, 1787.[553] A month was given to the electors\r\nto deliberate over the choice of delegates who were to decide the\r\nmomentous issue. The election was held on November 12; the convention\r\nassembled on January 3, 1788; and after a few days’ discussion gave its\r\nassent on January 9, 1788, by a vote of 128 to 40.[554]\r\n\r\nIn New York the voters were given more time than in Connecticut to\r\nconsider the new Constitution before they were called upon to settle the\r\nquestion of ratification at the polls by choosing delegates to the state\r\nconvention. It was not until February 1, 1788, that the legislature of\r\nthat commonwealth issued the call for the special election to be held on\r\nthe last Tuesday of the following April.[555]\r\n\r\nThe contest in New York was hot from the start. Governor Clinton, in his\r\nmessage to the legislature in January, 1788, did not mention the\r\nConstitution—an omission which gave the Federalists some hope as they\r\nhad feared an executive attack. The resolution calling the state\r\nconvention passed the lower house by a narrow margin; and in the senate\r\na motion to postpone the matter was almost carried, receiving nine out\r\nof nineteen votes.[556]\r\n\r\nWhen, at length, the convention assembled, at least two-thirds of the\r\nsixty-four members were found to be against ratification. Such is the\r\nview of Bancroft, and the contemporary press bears out his\r\nconclusion.[557] Nevertheless, by much eloquence and no little\r\nmanœuvring, the Federalist champions were able to obtain a majority of\r\n30 to 27. The assent of the requisite number of opponents was secured\r\nonly after an agreement that a circular should be issued recommending\r\nthe call of another national convention at once to revise the\r\nConstitution as adopted.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this agreement, the legislature at its next session, on\r\nFebruary 5, 1789, called upon Congress to summon another convention to\r\nrevise the new instrument of government at once. The address of the\r\nlegislature stated that the Constitution had been ratified “in the\r\nfullest confidence of obtaining a revision of the said Constitution by a\r\ngeneral convention, and in confidence that certain powers in and by the\r\nsaid Constitution granted would not be exercised until a convention\r\nshould have been called and convened for proposing amendments to the\r\nsaid Constitution.” The legislature went on to say that it complied with\r\nthe unanimous sense of the state convention, “who all united in opinion\r\nthat such a revision was necessary to recommend the said Constitution to\r\nthe approbation and support of a numerous body of their constituents,\r\nand a majority of the members of which conceived several articles of the\r\nConstitution so exceptionable, that nothing but such confidence and an\r\ninvincible reluctance to separate from our sister states could have\r\nprevailed upon a sufficient number to assent to it without stipulating\r\nfor previous amendments.”[558]\r\n\r\nThe commonwealth of New Jersey made haste to ratify the new Constitution\r\nas soon as possible after its transmission by Congress. On November 1,\r\n1787, the legislature issued the call for the convention, ordering the\r\ninhabitants who were “entitled to vote for representatives in General\r\nAssembly,” to elect delegates on the fourth Tuesday in the following\r\nNovember, i.e., November 27. The date for the meeting of the convention\r\nwas fixed as the second Tuesday in December, the 11th, and on the 18th\r\nday of that month, the members, “Having maturely deliberated on and\r\nconsidered the aforesaid proposed Constitution,” unanimously agreed to\r\nits adoption.[559]\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Delaware, influenced by “the sense and desire of\r\ngreat numbers of the people of the state, signified in petitions to\r\ntheir general assembly,” adopted a resolution on November 10, 1787,\r\ncalling for the election of delegates within a few days—that is on\r\nNovember 26—for the state convention to pass upon the Constitution. The\r\nconvention met at Dover on December 3; and after four days’ deliberation\r\non the matter adopted the Constitution by unanimous vote on December 6,\r\n1787.[560]\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania the proceedings connected with the ratification were\r\nprecipitous and narrowly escaped being irregular. Before it was known\r\nthat Congress would even transmit the Constitution to the states for\r\ntheir consideration, George Clymer,[561] who had been a member of the\r\nnational Convention and was then serving in the Pennsylvania\r\nlegislature, “rose in his place and moved that a state convention of\r\ndeputies be called, that they meet at Philadelphia, and that they be\r\nchosen in the same manner and on the same day as the members of the next\r\ngeneral assembly.”[562] In vain did the opponents urge that this was\r\nirregular, that it was not known whether Congress would act favorably,\r\nand that deliberation rather than haste should characterize such a\r\nweighty procedure. The legislature, nevertheless, resolved to call the\r\nconvention, and adjourned until the afternoon, leaving the date of the\r\nconvention and manner of selecting delegates to be settled later. The\r\nopposition thereupon decided to secure delay by staying away and\r\npreventing the transaction of business for want of a quorum.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the news reached Philadelphia that Congress had sent the\r\nConstitution to the states for their consideration. The Federalists in\r\nthe legislature, now having secured the sanction of regularity,\r\ndetermined not to brook further delay, so they sent officers after some\r\nof the recalcitrants, who thought “filibustering” justifiable in view of\r\nthe importance of securing more deliberation before acting. These\r\nofficers, ably assisted by a Federalist mob “broke into their lodgings,\r\nseized them, dragged them through the streets to the State house, and\r\nthrust them into the assembly room, with clothes torn and faces white\r\nwith rage. The quorum was now complete.”[563] The legislature (September\r\n29) fixed the election of delegates to the state convention at a date\r\nfive weeks distant, November 6, 1787. Thus the people of the state were\r\ngiven a little over a month to deliberate on this momentous issue before\r\nselecting their agents to voice their will. Some Federalists, like Tench\r\nCoxe, expressed regret at the necessity of adopting these high-handed\r\nmethods; but the stress was so great that it did not admit of delay.\r\n\r\nAfter the convention assembled, the Federalists continued their\r\nirregular practices, although from the vote on the Constitution in the\r\nconvention this latter manipulation seems to have been a work of\r\nsupererogation. Everything was done that could be done to keep the\r\npublic out of the affair. “Thomas Lloyd applied to the convention for\r\nthe place of assistant clerk. Lloyd was a shorthand writer of\r\nconsiderable note, and when the convention refused his request,\r\ndetermined to report the debates and print them on his own account. His\r\nadvertisement promised that the debates should be accurately taken in\r\nshorthand and published in one volume octavo at the rate of one dollar\r\nthe hundred pages. These fine promises, however, were never fulfilled.\r\nOnly one thin volume ever came out, and that contains merely the\r\nspeeches of Wilson and a few of those of Thomas M’Kean. The reason is\r\nnot far to seek. He was bought up by the Federalists, and in order to\r\nsatisfy the public was suffered to publish one volume containing nothing\r\nbut speeches made by the two federal leaders.”[564] The Federalists\r\nappear to have suppressed other attempts at issuing the debates, and\r\nthey “withdrew their subscriptions from every publication that warmly\r\nsupported the Antifederal cause.”[565] The Constitution was ratified by\r\na vote of 46 to 23.\r\n\r\nAgainst these precipitous actions on the part of the Federalists in\r\ncarrying the ratification of the Constitution, a minority of the state\r\nconvention, twenty-one members, protested in an address to the people\r\nafter the day had been lost. The protestants told how the federal\r\nConvention had been called by Congress, and then recited the facts as\r\nthey viewed them: “So hastily and eagerly did the states comply [with\r\nthe call of Congress for the Convention] that their legislatures,\r\nwithout the slightest authority, without ever stopping to consult the\r\npeople, appointed delegates, and the conclave met at Philadelphia. To it\r\ncame a few men of character, some more noted for cunning than\r\npatriotism, and some who had always been enemies to the independence of\r\nAmerica. The doors were shut, secrecy was enjoined, and what then took\r\nplace no man could tell. But it was well known that the sittings were\r\nfar from harmonious. Some left the dark conclave before the instrument\r\nwas framed. Some had the firmness to withhold their hands when it was\r\nframed. But it came forth in spite of them, and was not many hours old\r\nwhen the meaner tools of despotism were carrying petitions about for the\r\npeople to sign praying the legislature to call a convention to consider\r\nit. The convention was called by a legislature made up in part of\r\nmembers who had been dragged to their seats and kept there against their\r\nwills, and so early a day was set for the election of delegates that\r\nmany a voter did not know of it until it was passed. Others kept away\r\nfrom the polls because they were ignorant of the new plan; some because\r\nthey disliked it, and some because they did not think the convention\r\nlegally called. Of the seventy thousand freemen entitled to vote but\r\nthirteen thousand voted.”[566] For a long time the war of the dissenters\r\nagainst the Constitution went on in Pennsylvania, breaking out in\r\noccasional riots, and finally in the Whiskey Rebellion in Washington’s\r\nadministration; but they were at length beaten, outgeneralled, and\r\noutclassed in all the arts of political management.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1787, the Maryland legislature, after hearing Luther\r\nMartin’s masterly indictment of the Constitution and McHenry’s effective\r\nreply, “unanimously ordered a convention of the people of the state; it\r\ncopied the example set by Virginia of leaving the door open for\r\namendments; and by a majority of one the day for the choice and the day\r\nfor the meeting of its convention were postponed till the next\r\nApril.”[567] Several months were thus given for deliberation, in marked\r\ncontrast to the speedy despatch of the business in Delaware, New Jersey,\r\nConnecticut, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The elections were duly\r\nheld on the first Monday in April, 1788; and the convention assembled on\r\nApril 21. The opponents of the Constitution, Chase, Mercer, and Martin,\r\nhurled themselves against it with all their might; but, it is related,\r\n“the friends to the federal government ‘remained inflexibly\r\nsilent.’”[568] After a week’s sessions, “the malcontents having tired\r\nthemselves out,” the convention ratified the Constitution by a vote of\r\nsixty-three against eleven on the afternoon of Saturday, April 26. The\r\ninstrument was formally sealed on the 28th.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Virginia, by a resolution passed on October 25, 1787,\r\nand a law enacted on December 12th, called a convention to be elected in\r\nMarch, 1788, and to assemble on June 2, 1788.[569] In no state were the\r\nforces for and against the Constitution more ably marshalled and led. In\r\nno state was there higher order of debate in the convention than took\r\nplace in Virginia, the birthplace of the Constitution. It was a\r\nmagnificent battle of talents that was waged during those June days,\r\nfrom the 2nd until the 25th. Then “the roll was called; and from the\r\ncities of Richmond and Williamsburg, from the counties near the ocean,\r\nfrom the northern neck, and from the counties between the Blue Ridge and\r\nthe Alleghanies, eighty-nine delegates voted for the Constitution. From\r\nthe other central and southern border counties of Kentucky, seventy-nine\r\ncried No.” The margin of victory was small, but it was safe.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina was recalcitrant. The call for the convention was issued\r\nby the legislature on December 6, 1787;[570] the election was held on\r\nthe last Friday and Saturday of March, 1788; and the convention\r\nassembled on July 21, 1788. In this body “the Antifederalists obtained a\r\nlarge majority. They permitted the whole subject to be debated until the\r\n2d of August; still it had been manifested from the first that they\r\nwould not allow of an unconditional ratification.” On that day the\r\nconvention deferred the ratification of the Constitution by a vote of\r\n184 to 84,[571] and adjourned _sine die_. The new federal government was\r\ninaugurated without North Carolina; but the economic pressure which it\r\nbrought to bear on that state, combined with the influence of eminent\r\nFederalists (including Washington), and the introduction of\r\nconstitutional amendments in Congress, brought her into the union on\r\nNovember 21, 1789.[572]\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was one of the most deliberative of all the states, for\r\nit was not until January 18, 1788, that the legislature by unanimous\r\nresolution called a convention which was elected in April, and organized\r\nin Charleston, on May 13 of that year. The discussion there was\r\nevidently of a high order. Those who participated in it took first rank\r\nin the commonwealth, and the defenders of the new system put forth\r\nefforts worthy of the distinguished forensic leaders of the Charleston\r\nbar. The opponents exhausted the armory of their arguments, and seeing\r\nthe tide running against them, they sought an adjournment of five months\r\nfor further deliberation; but a motion to this effect was lost by a vote\r\nof 89 to 135. Finally at five o’clock on the tenth day of the sessions,\r\nMay 23, the Constitution was carried by a large majority—149 to 73.[573]\r\n\r\nThe legislature of Georgia, on October 26, 1787, called for a state\r\nconvention to be chosen “in the same manner as representatives are\r\nelected,” at the next General Election, held on the first Tuesday in\r\nDecember, _i.e._, December 4, 1787. The convention was duly chosen, and\r\nmet at Augusta on December 25; and after “having taken into serious\r\nconsideration the said constitution” for four or five days, solemnly\r\nratified the instrument on January 2, 1788.[574]\r\n\r\nRhode Island was the last of the thirteen states to accept the\r\nConstitution. She had refused to send delegates to the federal\r\nConvention; and the triumphant paper money party there would have none\r\nof the efficiency promised by the new system. It was not until May 29,\r\n1790, that Rhode Island ratified the Constitution, and this action was\r\nbrought about by the immediate prospect of coercion on the part of the\r\ngovernment of the United States,[575] combined with the threat of the\r\ncity of Providence to join with the other towns which were Federalist in\r\nopinion, in a movement to secede from the state and seek the protection\r\nof the federal government.[576] Without these material considerations\r\npressing upon them, the agrarians of that commonwealth would have\r\ndelayed ratification indefinitely; but they could not contend against a\r\ngreat nation and a domestic insurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\nA survey of the facts here presented yields several important\r\ngeneralizations:\r\n\r\nTwo states, Rhode Island and North Carolina refused to ratify the\r\nConstitution until after the establishment of the new government which\r\nset in train powerful economic forces against them in their isolation.\r\n\r\nIn three states, New Hampshire, New York, and Massachusetts, the popular\r\nvote as measured by the election of delegates to the conventions was\r\nadverse to the Constitution; and ratification was secured by the\r\nconversion of opponents and often the repudiation of their tacit (and in\r\nsome cases express) instructions.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the popular vote was doubtful.\r\n\r\nIn the four states which ratified the constitution with facility,\r\nConnecticut, New Jersey, Georgia, and Delaware, only four or five weeks\r\nwere allowed to elapse before the legislatures acted, and four or five\r\nweeks more before the elections to the conventions were called; and\r\nabout an equal period between the elections and the meeting of the\r\nconventions. This facility of action may have been due to the general\r\nsentiment in favor of the Constitution; or the rapidity of action may\r\naccount for the slight development of the opposition.\r\n\r\nIn two commonwealths, Maryland and South Carolina, deliberation and\r\ndelays in the election and the assembling of the conventions resulted in\r\nan undoubted majority in favor of the new instrument; but for the latter\r\nstate the popular vote has never been figured out.[577]\r\n\r\nIn one of the states, Pennsylvania, the proceedings connected with the\r\nratification of the Constitution were conducted with unseemly haste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                  THE POPULAR VOTE ON THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the adoption of the Constitution, says James Wilson, we have the\r\ngratifying spectacle of “a whole people exercising its first and\r\ngreatest power—performing an act of sovereignty original and\r\nunlimited.”[578] Without questioning the statement that for juristic\r\npurposes the Constitution may be viewed as an expression of the will of\r\nthe whole people, a historical view of the matter requires an analysis\r\nof “the people” into its constituent elements. In other words, how many\r\nof “the people” favored the adoption of the Constitution, and how many\r\nopposed it?\r\n\r\nAt the very outset, it is necessary to recall that the question whether\r\na constitutional Convention should be held was not submitted to popular\r\nvote, and that it was not specially passed upon by the electors in\r\nchoosing the members of the legislatures which selected the\r\ndelegates.[579]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the Constitution was not submitted to popular\r\nratification. The referendum was not unknown at that time, but it was\r\nnot a fixed principle of American politics.[580] At all events, such a\r\nprocedure does not seem to have crossed the minds of the members of the\r\nConvention, and long afterward, Marshall stated that ratification by\r\nstate conventions was the only mode conceivable.[581] In view of the\r\nfact that there was no direct popular vote taken on the Constitution, it\r\nis therefore impossible to ascertain the exact number of “the people”\r\nwho favored its adoption.\r\n\r\nThe voters, who took part in the selection of delegates to the ratifying\r\nconventions in the states, may be considered as having been divided into\r\nfour elements: those who were consciously in favor of the Constitution,\r\nthose who were just as consciously against it, those who were willing to\r\nleave the matter to the discretion of their elected representatives, and\r\nthose who voted blindly.\r\n\r\nThe proportions which these four groups bear to one another cannot be\r\ndetermined, but certain facts may be brought out which will throw light\r\non the great question: How many of the people favored the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution?\r\n\r\nThe first fact to be noted in this examination is that a considerable\r\nproportion of the adult white male population was debarred from\r\nparticipating in the elections of delegates to the ratifying state\r\nconventions by the prevailing property qualifications on the suffrage.\r\nThe determination of these suffrage qualifications was left to the state\r\nlegislatures; and in general they adopted the property restrictions\r\nalready imposed on voters for members of the lower branch of the state\r\nlegislatures.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire the duly qualified voters for members of the lower\r\nhouse were authorized to vote for members of the convention, and those\r\nTories and sympathizers with Great Britain who were excluded by law were\r\nalso admitted for this special election.[582] In Massachusetts the\r\nvoters were those “qualified by law to vote in the election of\r\nrepresentatives.”[583] In Connecticut, those “qualified by law to vote\r\nin town meetings” were enfranchised.[584] In New Jersey, those who were\r\n“entitled to vote for representatives in general assembly;”[585] and in\r\nDelaware, those “qualified by law to vote for Representatives to the\r\nGeneral Assembly”[586] were empowered to vote for delegates to their\r\nrespective conventions. In Pennsylvania, voters for members of the\r\nassembly selected the delegates to the convention.[587] In Maryland,\r\nvoters for members of the lower house;[588] in Virginia, those\r\npossessing the “qualifications now established by law;”[589] in North\r\nCarolina, those entitled to vote for members of the House of\r\nCommons;[590] in South Carolina, those voting for members of the lower\r\nhouse; and in Georgia, those voting for members of the legislature (one\r\nbranch) were admitted to participation in the election of delegates to\r\ntheir respective state conventions.[591]\r\n\r\nIn New York alone was the straight principle of manhood suffrage adopted\r\nin the election of delegates to the ratifying convention. Libby seems\r\ninclined to hold that this exception was made by the landed aristocracy\r\nin the state legislature because it was opposed to the Constitution and\r\nwished to use its semi-servile tenants in the elections; but this\r\nproblem has not yet been worked out, and any final conclusion as to the\r\n“politics” of this move is at present mere guesswork.[592]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say just what proportion of the adult males\r\ntwenty-one years of age was disfranchised by these qualifications. When\r\nit is remembered that only about 3 per cent of the population dwelt in\r\ntowns of over 8000 inhabitants in 1790, and that freeholds were widely\r\ndistributed, especially in New England, it will become apparent that\r\nnothing like the same proportion was disfranchised as would be to-day\r\nunder similar qualifications. Dr. Jameson estimates that probably\r\none-fifth of the adult males were shut out in Massachusetts,[593] and it\r\nwould probably be safe to say that nowhere were more than one-third of\r\nthe adult males disfranchised by the property qualifications.\r\n\r\nFar more were disfranchised through apathy and lack of understanding of\r\nthe significance of politics. It is a noteworthy fact that only a small\r\nproportion of the population entitled to vote took the trouble to go to\r\nthe polls until the hot political contests of the Jeffersonian era.\r\nWhere voting was _viva voce_ at the town hall or the county seat, the\r\njourney to the polls and the delays at elections were very troublesome.\r\nAt an election in Connecticut in 1775, only 3477 voters took part, out\r\nof a population of nearly 200,000, of whom 40,797 were males over twenty\r\nyears of age. How many were disfranchised by the property qualifications\r\nand how many stayed away through indifference cannot be shown.[594]\r\n\r\nDr. Jameson, by most ingenious calculations, reaches the conclusion that\r\nin Massachusetts about 55,000 men in round numbers or about 16 or 17 per\r\ncent of the population were entitled to vote under the law. Assuming\r\nthat 16 per cent were entitled to vote, he inquires into the number who\r\nactually exercised the franchise in the years from 1780 to 1790 in\r\nelections for governor; and his inquiry yields some remarkable results.\r\nTo give his conclusions in his own words: “Something like three per cent\r\n[of the population, or about one-fifth or one-sixth of those entitled to\r\nvote] took part in the first election in the autumn of 1780. During the\r\nnext six years the figures remain at about two per cent only. In 1784,\r\nonly 7631 votes were cast in the whole state; in the spring of 1786 only\r\na little over eight thousand. Then came Shays’ Rebellion and the\r\npolitical excitement of that winter brings up the votes in the spring\r\nelection of ‘87 to a figure nearly three times as high as in ’86, and\r\namounting to something between five and six per cent of the population.\r\nThe political discussions of the next two winters respecting the new\r\nfederal government keep the figure up to five per cent. Then it drops to\r\nsomething between three and four and there it remains until 1794.”[595]\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of a fine analysis of the economic forces in the\r\nratifying process, it would be of the highest value to have the vote on\r\ndelegates to the state conventions in each town and county throughout\r\nthe whole country; but unfortunately no such figures are compiled and\r\nmuch of the original materials upon which the statistical tables could\r\nbe based have doubtless disappeared.[596] Even such tables would be\r\nunsatisfactory because in several instances there were no contests and\r\nthe issue of adoption or rejection of the Constitution was not squarely\r\nput before the voters.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances, however, the number of voters participating in the\r\nelection of delegates to the state conventions has come down to us. In\r\nBoston, for example, where the fight was rather warm, and some 2700 men\r\nwere entitled to vote, only 760 electors turned out to pass upon the\r\nmomentous issue of the national Constitution—about half as many as voted\r\nin the next gubernatorial election.[597]\r\n\r\nThe treatises on the Constitution do not give any figures on the popular\r\nvote for delegates to the state convention in New York, but the\r\nfollowing partial list taken from contemporary papers shows that in some\r\nof the counties the vote ran to almost 10 per cent of the population,\r\nwhile in others the percentage of the electorate participating (even\r\nunder the universal manhood suffrage provision) was about that in\r\nMassachusetts, namely, 5 per cent. It will be noted also that the\r\ndistribution of representation in the convention was grossly unequal and\r\ndecidedly unfavorable to the Anti-Federalists. The classification into\r\nFederalist and Anti-Federalist is based upon the election returns as\r\nreported in the contemporary press, not on the vote in the state\r\nratifying convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FEDERALIST\r\n\r\n ═══════════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════\r\n                │          │          │          │          │ RATIO OF\r\n                │          │ HIGHEST  │ HIGHEST  │DELEGATES │DELEGATES\r\n                │POPULATION│FEDERALIST│ANTI-FEDERALIST│    IN    │    TO\r\n                │   1790   │   VOTE   │   VOTE   │CONVENTION[598]│POPULATION\r\n ───────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┬────┴─────\r\n New York County│    33,131│ 2735[599]│       134│         9│     3,681\r\n Westchester    │    23,941│  694[600]│       399│         6│     3,990\r\n Queens[601]    │    16,014│          │          │         4│     4,003\r\n Kings          │     4,495│          │          │         2│     2,247\r\n Richmond       │     3,835│          │          │         2│     1,917\r\n ───────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n                │          │          │          │        23│\r\n ═══════════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════\r\n\r\nFootnote 598:\r\n\r\n  Elliot, _Debates_, Vol. II, p. 206.\r\n\r\nFootnote 599:\r\n\r\n  Daily Advertiser, May 30, 1788.\r\n\r\nFootnote 600:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, June 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 601:\r\n\r\n  Queens vote was divided in the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANTI-FEDERALIST\r\n\r\n ═══════════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════╤══════════\r\n                │          │          │          │          │ RATIO OF\r\n                │          │ HIGHEST  │ HIGHEST  │DELEGATES │DELEGATES\r\n                │POPULATION│FEDERALIST│ANTI-FEDERALIST│    IN    │    TO\r\n                │   1790   │   VOTE   │   VOTE   │CONVENTION│POPULATION\r\n ───────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n Albany         │    75,921│ 2627[602]│      4681│         7│    10,845\r\n Ulster         │    29,397│   68[603]│      1372│         6│     4,899\r\n Dutchess       │    45,266│  892[604]│      1765│         7│     6,466\r\n Orange         │    18,478│          │  340[605]│         4│     4,619\r\n Columbia       │    27,732│ 1498[606]│      1863│         3│     9,244\r\n Montgomery     │    28,839│  811[607]│      1209│         6│     4,806\r\n Suffolk        │    16,440│          │          │         5│     3,288\r\n Washington[608]│    15,647│          │          │         4│     3,911\r\n ───────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n                │          │          │          │        41│\r\n ═══════════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════╧══════════\r\n\r\nFootnote 602:\r\n\r\n  Daily Advertiser, June 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 603:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, June 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 604:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, June 6.\r\n\r\nFootnote 605:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, June 14.\r\n\r\nFootnote 606:\r\n\r\n  New York Journal, June 5, 1788.\r\n\r\nFootnote 607:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, June 5.\r\n\r\nSeveral conclusions are obvious from this table. Measured by the popular\r\nvote, New York was overwhelmingly against the ratification of the\r\nConstitution. With the apportionment of representation against them, the\r\nAnti-Federalists elected nearly twice as many delegates as the\r\nFederalists. The popular vote in favor of ratification was largely\r\nconfined to the urban centres of New York City and Albany City, thus\r\ncorrecting assumptions based on the convention vote alone.\r\n\r\nBut with this decided popular vote against them the Federalists were\r\nable to carry through their program by a narrow margin of thirty to\r\ntwenty-seven. Why did so many Anti-Federalists whose popular mandate was\r\nclear and unmistakable, for there was a definite fight at the polls on\r\nthe issue, go over to their enemies? Three Anti-Federalist members, who\r\ndid go over and carry the day for the Federalists, John DeWitt, John\r\nSmith, and Melancton Smith, later appeared as holders of public\r\nsecurities;[609] but this does not explain the event.[610]\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania, the vote on the election of delegates to ratify the\r\nConstitution was apparently very slight. The dissenting minority in\r\ntheir famous manifesto declared: “The election for members of the\r\nconvention was held at so early a period and the want of information was\r\nso great that some of us did not know of it until after it was over....\r\nWe apprehend that no change can take place that will affect the internal\r\ngovernment or constitution of this commonwealth unless a majority of the\r\npeople should evidence a wish for such a change; but on examining the\r\nnumber of votes given for members of the present State convention, we\r\nfind that of upwards of seventy thousand freemen who are entitled to\r\nvote in Pennsylvania, the whole convention has been elected by about\r\nthirteen thousand voters, and though two-thirds of the members of the\r\nconvention have thought proper to ratify the proposed Constitution, yet\r\nthose two-thirds were elected by the votes of only six thousand and\r\neight hundred freemen.”[611] Though the partisan source of these figures\r\nmight lead one to question their accuracy, nevertheless it is hardly\r\nprobable that they would have greatly exaggerated figures that were open\r\nto all.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was the scene of perhaps the hottest contest over the\r\nelection of delegates that occurred anywhere. The city had at that time\r\na population of about 28,000 inhabitants. At the election, the candidate\r\nwho stood the highest at the polls, George Latimer, received 1215 votes\r\nwhile his leading opponent received only 235 votes.[612] Thus a total of\r\n1450 votes was cast in the election—about 5 per cent of the population.\r\n\r\nThe total population of the state in 1790 was 434,373, and allowing for\r\nthe difficulty of journeying to the polls in the rural districts, it\r\nseems that the estimate of the dissenters was probably not far from\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in Baltimore 1347 voters participated in the election of\r\nrepresentatives from that city. McHenry at the head of the poll received\r\n962 votes and it was known that he favored unconditional ratification of\r\nthe Constitution. His leading opponent received 385 votes.[613] This\r\nvote was taken after a considerable demonstration, for a newspaper\r\nreport says that “On the same day, the ship builders, the tradesmen\r\nconcerned in navigation, the merchants, the manufacturers and several\r\nthousand inhabitants walked in procession through the different streets\r\nof the town.” Baltimore had at that time a population of 13,000 so that\r\na very large proportion of the adult males took part in the election.\r\n\r\nFurther light is thrown on the vote in Maryland by an opponent of\r\nratification in a long paper printed in the Maryland Journal of May 16,\r\n1788, signed “Republican.” The author, says Steiner, “asserts that the\r\n‘common class’ of people knew little of the Constitution. The two\r\nthousand copies of that document printed by order of the Assembly were\r\ntoo few to go far. The Annapolis paper is of small circulation, and the\r\ntwo Baltimore ones are never seen on the Eastern Shore, while the severe\r\nweather during the past winter prevented any newspapers from being sent\r\nover thither. Of the 25,000 voters in the state, only 6000 voted at the\r\nelection and 4,000 of these votes were cast in Baltimore town and seven\r\nof the counties. The rich and wealthy worked for the Constitution to\r\nprevent the loss of their debts, and in some counties the opposition had\r\nnamed no candidates.”[614]\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the distribution of representation in the convention\r\nwas such as to give a decided preponderance to the personalty districts\r\nalong the seaboard. The convention of 1788 was composed of approximately\r\ntwice the number of the house of representatives in 1794 and the\r\napportionment was similar in character. In the latter year, R. G.\r\nHarper, under the pen-name of “Appius” pointed out the great disparity\r\nin the weight of the upper and lower districts in the legislature: “The\r\nlower country, including the three districts of Charleston, Beaufort,\r\nand Georgetown [which were strongly in favor of ratification of the\r\nConstitution], contains 28,694 white inhabitants, and it elects seventy\r\nrepresentatives and twenty senators. Divide 149,596, the whole number in\r\nthe state, by 28,694, those of the lower country, and the result will be\r\nmore than five, from whence it appears, that a large majority of both\r\nbranches of the legislature is elected by less than one-fifth of the\r\npeople.”[615] The upper district [largely Anti-Federal], on the other\r\nhand, contained 120,902 white inhabitants, and sent only fifty-four\r\nmembers to the house of representatives. On this basis, the\r\nseventy-three votes cast in the convention against ratification may in\r\nfact have represented a majority of the white inhabitants and voters in\r\nthe state.[616]\r\n\r\nWhile one hesitates to generalize about the vote cast in favor of the\r\nConstitution on the basis of the fragmentary evidence available, it\r\nseems worth while, nevertheless, to put together several related facts\r\nbearing on the matter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the conclusion, brought out by Dr. Jameson, that about 5\r\nper cent of the population voted in Massachusetts in the period under\r\nconsideration, we have other valuable data. Dr. Paullin has shown that\r\nthe electoral vote in the presidential election of 1788 in New Hampshire\r\nwas 2.8 per cent of the free population; that the vote in Madison’s\r\nelectoral district in Virginia in the same election was 2.7 per cent of\r\nthe white population; that the vote in the first congressional election\r\nin Maryland was 3.6 per cent of the white population and that the vote\r\nin the same congressional election in Massachusetts was 3 per cent.[617]\r\nSpeaking of the exercise of the franchise as a whole in the period, Dr.\r\nPaullin says, “The voting was done chiefly by a small minority of\r\ninterested property holders, a disproportionate share of whom in the\r\nnorthern states resided in the towns, and the wealthier and more\r\ntalented of whom like a closed corporation controlled politics.”\r\n\r\nIn view of these figures, in view of the data given above on the\r\nelection of delegates (to the ratifying conventions) in the cities of\r\nBoston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, in view of the fact that the\r\npercentage participating in the country was smaller than in the towns,\r\nand in view of the fact that only 3 per cent of the population resided\r\nin cities of over 8000, it seems a safe guess to say that not more than\r\n5 per cent of the population in general, or in round numbers, 160,000\r\nvoters, expressed an opinion one way or another on the Constitution. In\r\nother words, it is highly probable that not more than one-fourth or\r\none-fifth of the adult white males took part in the election of\r\ndelegates to the state conventions. If anything, this estimate is high.\r\n\r\nNow in four of the states, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, and\r\nVirginia, the conventions at the time of their election were either\r\nopposed to the ratification of the Constitution or so closely divided\r\nthat it was hard to tell which way the final vote would go. These four\r\nstates, with Rhode Island and North Carolina,[618] which were at first\r\nagainst ratification, possessed about three-fifths of the population—in\r\nround numbers 1,900,000 out of 3,200,000 free persons. Of the 1,900,000\r\npopulation in these states we may, with justice it seems, set off at\r\nleast 900,000, that is, 45,000 voters as representing the opposition.\r\nAdd to these the voters in Pennsylvania who opposed the ratification of\r\nthe Constitution, approximately 6000, and we have 51,000 dissenting\r\nvoters, against ratification. Adding the dissenters in Maryland, South\r\nCarolina,[619] and Connecticut, and taking the other states as\r\nunanimous, we may reasonably conjecture that of the estimated 160,000\r\nwho voted in the election of delegates, not more than 100,000 men\r\nfavored the adoption of the Constitution at the time it was put into\r\neffect—about one in six of the adult males.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that these figures are rough guesses, it appears,\r\nnevertheless, that the Constitution was not “an expression of the clear\r\nand deliberate will of the whole people,” nor of a majority of the adult\r\nmales, nor at the outside of one-fifth of them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it may very well be that a majority of those who voted were\r\nagainst the adoption of the Constitution as it then stood. Such a\r\nconjecture can be based on the frank statement of no less an authority\r\nthan the great Chief Justice Marshall who took a prominent part in the\r\nmovement which led to the formation and ratification of the new\r\ninstrument of government.[620]\r\n\r\nAt all events, the disfranchisement of the masses through property\r\nqualifications and ignorance and apathy contributed largely to the\r\nfacility with which the personalty-interest representatives carried the\r\nday. The latter were alert everywhere, for they knew, not as a matter of\r\ntheory, but as a practical matter of dollars and cents, the value of the\r\nnew Constitution. They were well informed. They were conscious of the\r\nidentity of their interests. They were well organized. They knew for\r\nweeks in advance, even before the Constitution was sent to the states\r\nfor ratification, what the real nature of the contest was. They resided\r\nfor the most part in the towns, or the more thickly populated areas, and\r\nthey could marshall their forces quickly and effectively. They had also\r\nthe advantage of appealing to all discontented persons who exist in\r\nlarge numbers in every society and are ever anxious for betterment\r\nthrough some change in political machinery.\r\n\r\nTalent, wealth, and professional abilities were, generally speaking, on\r\nthe side of the Constitutionalists. The money to be spent in the\r\ncampaign of education was on their side also; and it was spent in\r\nconsiderable sums for pamphleteering, organizing parades and\r\ndemonstrations, and engaging the interest of the press. A small\r\npercentage of the enormous gain to come through the appreciation of\r\nsecurities alone would have financed no mean campaign for those days.\r\n\r\nThe opposition on the other hand suffered from the difficulties\r\nconnected with getting a backwoods vote out to the town and county\r\nelections. This involved sometimes long journeys in bad weather, for it\r\nwill be remembered that the elections were held in the late fall and\r\nwinter. There were no such immediate personal gains to be made through\r\nthe defeat of the Constitution, as were to be made by the security\r\nholders on the other side. It was true the debtors knew that they would\r\nprobably have to settle their accounts in full and the small farmers\r\nwere aware that taxes would have to be paid to discharge the national\r\ndebt if the Constitution was adopted; and the debtors everywhere waged\r\nwar against the Constitution—of this there is plenty of evidence.[621]\r\nBut they had no money to carry on their campaign; they were poor and\r\nuninfluential—the strongest battalions were not on their side. The\r\nwonder is that they came so near defeating the Constitution at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n             THE ECONOMICS OF THE VOTE ON THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in natural science no organism is pretended to be understood as long\r\nas its merely superficial aspects are described, so in history no\r\nmovement by a mass of people can be correctly comprehended until that\r\nmass is resolved into its component parts. To apply this concept to the\r\nproblem before us: no mathematically exact conclusion can be reached\r\nconcerning the material interests reflected in the Constitution until\r\n“the people” who favored its adoption and “the people” who opposed it\r\nare individualized and studied as economic beings dependent upon\r\ndefinite modes and processes of gaining a livelihood. A really fine\r\nanalytical treatment of this problem would, therefore, require a study\r\nof the natural history of the (approximately) 160,000 men involved in\r\nthe formation and adoption of the Constitution; but for the present we\r\nmust rely on rougher generalizations, drawn from incomplete sources.\r\n\r\nIt would be fortunate if we had a description of each of the state\r\nconventions similar to that made of the Philadelphia Convention;[622]\r\nbut such a description would require a study of the private economy of\r\nseveral hundred men, with considerable scrutiny. And the results of such\r\na search would be on the whole less fruitful than those secured by the\r\nstudy of the Philadelphia Convention, because so many members of the\r\nstate ratifying bodies were obscure persons of whom biography records\r\nnothing and whose property holdings do not appear in any of the\r\ndocuments that have come down to us. In a few instances, as in the case\r\nof Pennsylvania, a portion of this work has been done in a fragmentary\r\nway—as regards economic matters; and it may be hoped that a penetrating\r\nanalysis of the public security holdings and other property interests of\r\nthe members of all state conventions may sometime be made—as far as the\r\nsources will allow. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this study,\r\ncertain general truths concerning the conflict over the ratification of\r\nthe Constitution in the several states have already been established by\r\nscholars like Libby, Harding, Ambler.\r\n\r\nThe first of these authors, Dr. Libby, has made a painstaking study of\r\nthe _Geographical Distribution of the Vote on the Constitution_, in\r\nwhich he sets forth the economic characteristics of the areas for and\r\nagainst the adoption of the Constitution. These conclusions are all\r\nutilized in this chapter; but they are supplemented by reference to the\r\nlater researches of Harding[623] and Ambler,[624] and by a large amount\r\nof new illustrative materials here presented for the first time. The\r\nmethod followed is to exhibit, in general, the conflict of economic\r\ninterests in each of the several states over the adoption of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n_New Hampshire._—There were three rather sharply marked economic\r\ndistricts in New Hampshire which found political expression in the\r\nconvention that ratified the Constitution. Two of the three were the\r\nsea-coast area and the interior or middle region. “The former,” says\r\nLibby, “the coast area, represented the commercial and urban interests;\r\nhere were to be found most of the professional men, leaders of thought,\r\nmen of wealth and influence. The second section, the interior, was\r\ncomposed of those representing the small farmers; a population cut off\r\nfrom the outside world by lack of good roads, and which raised little\r\nfor market except to exchange for the few things that could not be\r\nproduced at home. The former class, progressive and liberal and familiar\r\nwith the practical details of government, as a rule voted for the\r\nConstitution. The latter, conservative by environment and having little\r\nknowledge of what went on outside the narrow bounds of the home village\r\nor township, quite as generally voted against the Constitution.”[625]\r\n\r\nThe third region in New Hampshire (whose representatives favored\r\nratification) was “the Connecticut valley or border district” whose\r\ninterests were akin to those of the sea towns because it had commercial\r\nconnection with the outside world through the Connecticut River. It was\r\nto this region particularly that Oliver Ellsworth must have appealed in\r\nhis open letter to the citizens of New Hampshire in which he said: “New\r\nYork, the trading towns on the Connecticut River, and Boston are the\r\nsources from which a great part of your foreign supplies will be\r\nobtained, and where your produce will be exposed for market. In all\r\nthese places an import is collected, of which, as consumers, you pay a\r\nshare without deriving any public benefit. You cannot expect any\r\nalteration in the private systems of these states unless effected by the\r\nproposed government.”[626]\r\n\r\nSeveral economic facts of prime significance in the ratification of the\r\nConstitution in New Hampshire are afforded by the tax returns of 1793.\r\nThese show that of the £61,711:9:5 “total value of stock in trade” in\r\nthe state in that year (Vermont being then cut off) no less than\r\n£42,512:0:5 or over two-thirds was in Rockingham county, the seat of the\r\ncommercial town of Portsmouth, whose citizens were the leading agitators\r\nfor the new system, and whose delegates in the state convention were\r\noverwhelmingly in favor of ratification. Moreover, of the total amount\r\nof the “money on hand or at interest” in the state, £35,985:5:6, about\r\ntwo-thirds, £22,770:9:4 was in Rockingham county. It is of further\r\nsignificance that of the £893,327:16:10 worth of real estate and\r\nbuildings in the state, less than one-half, £317,970:7:2, was in that\r\ncounty.[627] Thus the stronghold of Federalism possessed about\r\ntwo-thirds of all the personalty and only about one-half of the realty\r\nvalues in the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAll personalty was not equally interested in ratifying the Constitution,\r\nas pointed out above; holders of public paper multiplied their values\r\nfrom six to twenty times in securing the establishment of the new\r\nsystem. Further interesting data would be revealed, therefore, if we\r\ncould discover the proportion of public securities to other personalty\r\nand their geographic distribution.[628] The weight of the securities in\r\nNew Hampshire is shown by the fact that the tax list for 1793 gives only\r\n£35,985 as the total amount of money on hand or at interest (including\r\npublic securities)[629] in the state, while the accounts of the Treasury\r\ndepartment show that $20,000 in interest on the public debt went to the\r\nloan office of that state to discharge that annual federal\r\nobligation.[630] It is highly probable that the tax list is very low,\r\nbut even at that the public securities constituted a considerable mass\r\nof the capital of the commonwealth. The leading supporters of the\r\nConstitution in New Hampshire were large holders of public paper,[631]\r\nand there is no doubt that as personalty was the dynamic element in the\r\nmovement for the Constitution, so securities were the dynamic element in\r\nthe personalty.\r\n\r\n_Massachusetts._—The vote in Massachusetts on the Constitution was\r\nclearly along class or group lines: those sections in which were to be\r\nfound the commerce, money, securities—in a word, personalty—were in\r\nfavor of the ratification of the new instrument of government; and those\r\nsections which were predominantly rural and possessed little personalty\r\nwere against it. Libby classifies the sections on the basis of the vote\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n Eastern section            Yeas, 73 per cent       Nays, 27 per cent\r\n Middle section             Yeas, 14 per cent       Nays, 86 per cent\r\n Western section            Yeas, 42 per cent       Nays, 58 per cent\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this table he says: “Such striking differences as these\r\nindicate clearly that there is something fundamental lying back of the\r\nvote. Each of these sections is an economic and social unit, the first\r\nrepresenting the coast region, the second the interior, and the third\r\nthe Connecticut valley and border districts of the state. In the eastern\r\nsection the interests were commercial; there was the wealth, the\r\ninfluence, the urban population of the state.... The middle section of\r\nMassachusetts represented the interior agricultural interests of the\r\nstate—the small farmers. From this section came a large part of the\r\nShays faction in 1786. The Connecticut valley or western district may be\r\nsubdivided into the northern, most interior, and predominantly\r\nAntifederal section, and the southern section, nearest the coast and\r\npredominantly Federal, with the trading towns of the Connecticut River\r\nin its southeastern part.”[632]\r\n\r\nHarding, after an independent study of the opposition to the\r\nConstitution in Massachusetts, comes to substantially the same\r\nconclusion. Among the weighty elements in the struggle he places “the\r\nconflict of interest, partly real and partly fancied, between the\r\nagricultural and the commercial sections of the state.” Underlying the\r\nwhole opposition, he continues, “was the pronounced antagonism between\r\nthe aristocratic and the democratic elements of society in\r\nMassachusetts.... Massachusetts was not alone in this experience; in\r\nmost, if not all, of the states a similar contest had arisen since the\r\nwar. The men who at Philadelphia had put their names to the new\r\nConstitution were, it seems quite safe to affirm, at that time\r\nidentified with the aristocratic interest.... There can be no question\r\nthat this feeling [of antagonism between democracy and aristocracy]\r\nunderlay most of the opposition in the Massachusetts convention.”[633]\r\n\r\nOf course this second element of opposition—aristocracy _versus_\r\ndemocracy—introduced by Harding is really nothing but the first under\r\nanother guise; for the aristocratic party was the party of wealth with\r\nits professional dependents; and the democratic party was the agrarian\r\nelement which, by the nature of economic circumstances, could have no\r\nlarge body of professional adherents. This economic foundation of the\r\nclass division was fully understood by Adams and set forth with\r\nunmistakable clearness in his _Defence of the American Constitutions_.\r\nHamilton, Madison, and all thinkers among the Federalists understood it\r\nalso. To speak of a democratic interest apart from its economic sources\r\nis therefore a work of supererogation; and it does not add, in fact, to\r\nan exposition of the real forces at work. Harding himself recognizes\r\nthis and explains it in a luminous fashion in his introductory chapter.\r\n\r\nAnd what were the economic and social antecedents of the opponents of\r\nthe Constitution in the Massachusetts convention? Harding, with his\r\ncustomary directness, meets the inquiry: “A half-dozen obscure men, it\r\nmust be answered, whose names are utterly unknown, even to most students\r\nof this period.” He continues: “William Widgery (or Wedgery) of New\r\nGloucester, Maine, was one of these.[634] A poor, friendless, uneducated\r\nboy, he had emigrated from England before the Revolution, had served as\r\na lieutenant on board a privateer in that contest, had then settled in\r\nMaine, had acquired some property, and by 1788 had served one term in\r\nthe Massachusetts legislature.... Samuel Thompson, of Topsham, Maine,\r\nwas another of the anti-federalist leaders. A self-made man, he had the\r\nobstinacy of opinion which such men often show.... He was wealthy for\r\nthe times, but inclined to be niggardly.... Another determined opponent\r\nof the proposed Constitution was Samuel Nasson (or Nason) of Sanford,\r\nMaine. Born in New Hampshire and a saddler by trade, he became a store\r\nkeeper in Maine, served awhile in the War ... and finally settled down\r\nas a trader at Sanford.... In 1787 he served a term in the General\r\nCourt, but declined a reelection because he felt ‘the want of a proper\r\neducation.’... From Massachusetts proper, Dr. John Taylor, of Douglas,\r\nWorcester County, was the most prominent opponent of the new\r\nConstitution.... But the slightest information, it seems, can now be\r\ngathered as to his history and personality. He had been one of the\r\npopular majority in the legislature of 1787 where he had taken an active\r\npart in procuring the extension of the Tender Law.... Another delegate\r\nfrom this part of the state who was prominent in the opposition was\r\nCaptain Phanuel Bishop, of Rehoboth, Bristol County. In him the Rhode\r\nIsland virus may be seen at work.... He was a native of Massachusetts\r\nand had received a public school education. When or why he had been\r\ndubbed Captain is not now apparent. Belknap styles him ‘a noted\r\ninsurgent’; and he had evidently ridden into office on the crest of the\r\nShaysite wave. His first legislative experience had been in the Senate\r\nof 1787 where he had championed the debtor’s cause.”[635]\r\n\r\nThis completes the list of leaders who fought bitterly against the\r\nConstitution to the end in Massachusetts, according to a careful student\r\nof the ratification in that state: three self-made men from the Maine\r\nregions and two representatives of the debtor’s cause. Nothing could be\r\nmore eloquent than this description of the alignment.\r\n\r\nNeither Harding nor Libby has, however, made analysis of the facts\r\ndisclosed by the tax lists of Massachusetts or the records in the\r\nTreasury Department at Washington, which show unquestionably that the\r\nlive and persistent economic force which organized and carried through\r\nthe ratification was the personalty interests and particularly the\r\npublic security interests. As has been pointed out, these had the most\r\nto gain immediately from the Constitution. Continental paper bought at\r\ntwo and three shillings in the pound was bound to rise rapidly with the\r\nestablishment of the federal government. No one knew this better than\r\nthe members of the federal Convention from Massachusetts and their\r\nimmediate friends and adherents in Boston.\r\n\r\nOf the total amount of funded 6 per cents in the state, £113,821, more\r\nthan one-half, £65,730, was concentrated in the two counties, Essex and\r\nSuffolk, of which Boston was the urban centre—the two counties whose\r\ndelegates in the state convention were almost unanimous in supporting\r\nthe Constitution. Of the total amount of 3 per cents, £73,100, more than\r\none-half, £43,857, was in these two counties. Of the deferred stock,\r\namounting to £59,872, more than one-half, £32,973, was in these two\r\ncounties. Of the total amount of all other securities of the state or\r\nthe United States in the commonwealth, £94,893, less than one-third or\r\n£30,329, was in these counties. Of the total amount of money at interest\r\nin the state, £196,698, only about one-third, £63,056, was in these two\r\ncounties, which supports the above conjecture that public securities\r\nwere the active element.[636]\r\n\r\nFurther confirmation for this conjecture seems to be afforded by the\r\nfollowing tables, showing the distribution of the vote and of public\r\nsecurities.[637] The first group shows the votes of the delegates from\r\nEssex and Suffolk counties—the Federalist strongholds—on the\r\nratification, and also the amount of public securities in each as\r\nrevealed by the tax lists of 1792:\r\n\r\n                                 ESSEX\r\n    For the Constitution   38 votes Against                 6 votes\r\n\r\n                                SUFFOLK\r\n    For the Constitution   34 votes Against                 5 votes\r\n\r\nTable of public securities listed for taxation in each of these\r\ncounties:\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════\r\n                        │        SUFFOLK        │         ESSEX\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n Funded, sixes          │                £29,228│                £36,502\r\n Funded, threes         │                 17,096│                 26,761\r\n Funded, not on interest│                 14,854│                 18,119\r\n Other securities       │                 14,056│                 16,273\r\n Money at Interest      │                 29,941│                 33,115\r\n ═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════\r\n\r\nNow let us take the vote in the convention, and the property in two\r\ncounties which were heavily against the Constitution.[638] The vote is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                               WORCESTER\r\n    For the Constitution    7 votes Against                43 votes\r\n\r\n                               BERKSHIRE\r\n    For the Constitution    7 votes Against                15 votes\r\n\r\nThe tables of public securities and money in these counties follow:\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════\r\n                        │       WORCESTER       │       BERKSHIRE\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n Funded, sixes          │                £12,924│                   £981\r\n Funded, threes         │                  8,184│                    665\r\n Funded, not on interest│                  5,736│                    384\r\n Other securities       │                 10,903│                    602\r\n Money at interest      │                 25,594│                   6298\r\n ═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════\r\n\r\nNow if we take the securities in these two counties which went heavily\r\nagainst the Constitution several economic facts are worthy of notice. Of\r\nthe total amount of 6 per cents in the state, only £13,905, or about\r\none-eighth is to be found in them. Of the 3 per cents, we find £8,849,\r\nor about one-eighth of the total amount in the commonwealth. But if we\r\ntake money at interest, we find £31,892, or about one-sixth of the total\r\namount in the state. This is not surprising, for Worcester was the\r\ncentre of the Shays rebellion in behalf of debtors, and a large portion\r\nof their creditors were presumably in the neighborhood.[639]\r\n\r\n“The courts were burdened with suits for ordinary debts by means of\r\nwhich creditors sought to put in more lasting form the obligations which\r\ntheir debtors could not at that time meet. In Worcester county alone,\r\nwith a population of less than 50,000, more than 2000 actions were\r\nentered in 1784, and during the next year 1700 more were put on the\r\nlist.”[640]\r\n\r\nThese figures, like all other statistics, should be used with care, and\r\nit would require a far closer analysis than can be made here to work out\r\nall of their political implications. We should have a thorough\r\nexamination of such details as the distribution of the public securities\r\namong towns and individual holders; and such a work is altogether worthy\r\nof a Quetelet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it may be said with safety that the communities in which\r\npersonalty was relatively more powerful favored the ratification of the\r\nConstitution, and that in these communities large quantities of public\r\nsecurities were held. Moreover, there was undoubtedly a vital connection\r\nbetween the movement in support of the Constitution and public security\r\nholding, or to speak concretely, among the leading men in Massachusetts\r\nwho labored to bring about the ratification was a large number of public\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nFor example, Boston had twelve representatives in the state ratifying\r\nconvention, all of whom voted in favor of the Constitution. Of these\r\ntwelve men the following were holders of public securities:[641]\r\n\r\n                           Samuel Adams\r\n                           James Bowdoin, Sr.\r\n                           Thomas Dawes, Jr.\r\n                           Christopher Gore\r\n                           John Coffin Jones\r\n                           William Phillips\r\n                           Thomas Russell\r\n                           John Winthrop\r\n\r\nIn other words, at least eight out of the twelve men representing the\r\nchief financial centre of the state were personally interested in the\r\nfate of the new Constitution. How deeply, it is impossible to say, for\r\nthe Ledgers seem to have disappeared from the Treasury Department and\r\nonly the Index to the funded debt remains. Supplementary records,\r\nhowever, show some of them to have been extensively engaged in dealing\r\nin paper. The four men who, apparently, were not security holders were\r\nJohn Hancock, Caleb Davis, Charles Jarvis, and Rev. Samuel\r\nStillman.[642]\r\n\r\nThe towns surrounding Boston in Suffolk county also returned a number of\r\nmen who were holders of securities:[643]\r\n\r\n                     Fisher Ames, Dedham\r\n                     John Baxter, Medfield\r\n                     James Bowdoin, Jr., Dorchester\r\n                     Richard Cranch, Braintree\r\n                     J. Fisher, Franklin\r\n                     William Heath, Roxbury\r\n                     Thomas Jones, Hull\r\n                     Benj. Lincoln, Hingham\r\n                     Rev. Daniel Shute, Hingham\r\n                     Increase Sumner, Roxbury\r\n                     Cotton Tufts, Weymouth\r\n                     Ebenezer Wales, Dorchester\r\n                     Ebenezer Warren, Foxboro\r\n                     Rev. Anthony Wibird, Braintree\r\n\r\nIn other words, twenty-two of the thirty-four men from Boston and\r\nSuffolk county who voted in favor of the ratification of the\r\nConstitution in the Massachusetts convention were holders of public\r\nsecurities, and all of the twenty-two except two (Wales and Warren)\r\nprobably benefited from the appreciation of the funds which resulted\r\nfrom the ratification.[644]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Massachusetts]\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate. There were thirty-nine members of the Massachusetts\r\nconvention from Suffolk county, which includes Boston. Of these,\r\nthirty-four voted for the ratification of the Constitution, and of the\r\nthirty-four who so voted, two-thirds, or twenty-two to be exact, were\r\nholders of public paper.\r\n\r\nThat other supporters of the Constitution from other Massachusetts\r\ncounties held paper so extensively is not to be expected, and a casual\r\nglance through the records shows that this surmise is probably true.\r\nBoston was the centre of the Federalist agitation, and it supplied the\r\nsinews of war for the campaign which finally secured the adoption of the\r\nnew system of government.\r\n\r\n_Connecticut._—The vote on the Constitution in Connecticut was so\r\nlargely in favor of ratification that no very clear lines of cleavage\r\nare apparent on the surface.[645] The opposition, as measured by the\r\nvote of the delegates in the Convention, was “scattered and unimportant.\r\nIts two chief centres were in New Haven county on the coast, and in five\r\nor six towns on the Connecticut river at the northern boundary,\r\nconnecting with a group of opposition towns in Massachusetts.”[646] It\r\nis worthy of note that the considerable towns for the time, Windsor,\r\nNorwalk, Stamford, Litchfield, Hartford, and New Haven were for the\r\nConstitution, while much of the opposition came from small inland towns\r\nlike Cornwall, Norfolk, and Sharon.[647]\r\n\r\nThe map facing this page shows that the Federalist towns were the\r\nfinancial centres of the time in Connecticut. The representatives of the\r\n“shaded” towns in the state convention voted against the Constitution;\r\nthose from the partially “shaded” towns were divided; and those from the\r\nplain white towns voted for the Constitution.[648] Each black dot\r\nrepresents a holder of one 6 per cent assumed debt bond.[649] It is\r\napparent at a glance that there must have been some relation between\r\nsecurity holding and the “sentiments,” to use Madison’s term,[650] of\r\nthe respective proprietors. Hartford alone had almost as many security\r\nholders as all of the Anti-Federalist towns combined. It would be\r\ninteresting to have a map showing the distribution of all other forms of\r\nwealth as well as the assumed debt.\r\n\r\nWhat a more searching study would produce were we able to carry the\r\ncontest back into the town meetings that chose the delegates cannot be\r\nconjectured. But the local evidence—even that which was recorded—has\r\nlargely disappeared or would require years of search to unearth.\r\nMoreover, the tax system in Connecticut at the time was not such as to\r\nyield the data most needed for such an inquiry, for “loans to the state\r\nand the United States were exempt from assessment.”[651] Whether this\r\ngrew out of a public policy or the fact that the chief politicians of\r\nthe day were large holders of securities—evidenced by the records in the\r\nTreasury Department at Washington—is also a matter for conjecture. No\r\ndocuments, no history.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as in Massachusetts, the public securities formed a\r\ndynamic element in the movement for ratification. One hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight members of the Connecticut convention voted in favor of the\r\nnew system. Of these men at least sixty-five held public paper in some\r\namount (ranging from a few dollars to tens of thousands) previous to or\r\nabout the time of the adoption of the Constitution.

For example, John Chester, of Wethersfield, is apparently\r\nnot on the books, but he was a colonel in the war and doubtless received\r\nthe soldiers’ certificates or other paper at some period. Thomas Chester\r\nand Sarah Chester of Wethersfield appear on the records. Whether there\r\nwere family connections might be ascertained by a study of local\r\nhistory. It is evident what infinite pains would be required to trace\r\nout all of these genealogical data.\r\n\r\n_New York._—There can be no question about the predominance of\r\npersonalty in the contest over the ratification in New York. That state,\r\nsays Libby, “presents the problem in its simplest form. The entire mass\r\nof interior counties ... were solidly Antifederal, comprising the\r\nagricultural portion of the state, the last settled and the most thinly\r\npopulated. There were however in this region two Federal cities (not\r\nrepresented in the convention [as such]), Albany in Albany county and\r\nHudson in Columbia county.... The Federal area centred about New York\r\ncity and county: to the southwest lay Richmond county (Staten Island);\r\nto the southeast Kings county, and to the northeast Westchester county;\r\nwhile still further extending this area, at the northeast lay the\r\ndivided county of Dutchess, with a vote in the convention of 4 to 2 in\r\nfavor of the Constitution, and at the southeast were the divided\r\ncounties of Queens and Suffolk.... These radiating strips of territory\r\nwith New York city as a centre form a unit, in general favorable to the\r\nnew Constitution; and it is significant of this unity that Dutchess,\r\nQueens, and Suffolk counties broke away from the anti-Federal phalanx\r\nand joined the Federalists, securing thereby the adoption of the\r\nConstitution.”[654]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the exact distribution of personalty in New York and\r\nparticularly in the wavering districts which went over to the Federalist\r\nparty cannot be ascertained, for the system of taxation in vogue in New\r\nYork at the period of the adoption of the Constitution did not require a\r\nstate record of property.[655] The data which proved so fruitful in\r\nMassachusetts are not forthcoming, therefore, in the case of New York;\r\nbut it seems hardly necessary to demonstrate the fact that New York City\r\nwas the centre of personalty for the state and stood next to\r\nPhiladelphia as the great centre of operations in public stock.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat obvious conclusion is reinforced by the evidence relative\r\nto the vote on the legal tender bill which the paper money party pushed\r\nthrough in 1786. Libby’s analysis of this vote shows that “No vote was\r\ncast against the bill by members of counties north of the county of New\r\nYork. In the city and county of New York and in Long Island and Staten\r\nIsland, the combined vote was 9 to 5 against the measure. Comparing this\r\nvote with the vote on the ratification in 1788, it will be seen that of\r\nthe Federal counties 3 voted against paper money and 1 for it; of the\r\ndivided counties 1 (Suffolk) voted against paper money and 2 (Queens and\r\nDutchess) voted for it. Of the anti-Federal counties none had members\r\nvoting against paper money. The merchants as a body were opposed to the\r\nissue of paper money and the Chamber of Commerce adopted a memorial\r\nagainst the issue.”[656]\r\n\r\nPublic security interests were identified with the sound money party.\r\nThere were thirty members of the New York constitutional convention who\r\nvoted in favor of the ratification of the Constitution and of these no\r\nless than sixteen were holders of public securities:[657]\r\n\r\n   James Duane, New York (C 6)\r\n   John DeWitt, Dutchess (N.Y. 3)\r\n   Alexander Hamilton,[658] New York\r\n   Richard Harrison, New York (C 6)\r\n   Jonathan Havens, Suffolk (C 6 as Trustee for a religious society).\r\n   John Jay, New York (C 6)\r\n   Samuel Jones, Queens (C 6)\r\n   Philip Livingston, Westchester (C 6)\r\n   Robert R. Livingston, New York (N.Y. 3)\r\n   Nicholas Low, New York (C 6)\r\n   Richard Morris.[659] New York (C 6)\r\n   Isaac Roosevelt, New York (R)\r\n   Gozen Ryerss, Richmond (N.Y. 3)\r\n   John Smith, Suffolk (C 6)\r\n   Melancton Smith, Dutchess (Conn.)\r\n   Philip Van Cortland, Westchester (C 6)\r\n   Jesse Woodhull, Orange (C 6)\r\n\r\n_New Jersey._—New Jersey was among the states which pushed through the\r\nratification of the Constitution without giving the agrarian party time\r\nto organize its forces; and, from the records, the vote in the state\r\nconvention was unanimous. This unanimity is rather startling in view of\r\nthe fact that the year before a paper money party had been able to force\r\nthrough an emission bill by a narrow margin. Either there was a violent\r\nreaction against inflation, or the Federalist campaign had been highly\r\norganized. What little opposition appears to have been raised in that\r\nstate seems to have been by the debtor and paper money class.[660]\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, however, that no detailed study of the ratification\r\nin New Jersey has ever been made. Libby passes it over briefly; and the\r\nolder writers like Bancroft and Curtis dismiss it with their usual\r\nlightness of touch. Unfortunately for such a study, the records of the\r\nconvention in that state are no more than bare minutes; and the\r\nmaterials in the Treasury Department from the New Jersey loan office are\r\nextremely fragmentary. Until extended search in local and state history\r\nis made on the points here raised, New Jersey must be dismissed\r\ncursorily.\r\n\r\nThere were thirteen counties in the state represented in the Convention,\r\nand each of nine counties had one or more representatives who had\r\nlearned the elementary lessons in public finance through holding at\r\nleast some small amounts of public securities—often certificates of only\r\ntrivial value. The meagre character of the records of that state do not\r\npermit of a satisfactory statement. There were three delegates from\r\nBergen county; of these John Fell appears on the Register of Land Office\r\nCertificates; there is no record of Peter Zabriskie either as a\r\nsubscriber to original funds or as owner of securities; but a Jacob\r\nZabriskie appears on a later Ledger. From Essex county, John Chetwood\r\nand David Crane appear among the holders; from Middlesex, John Beatty,\r\nJohn Neilson, and Benjamin Manning—the entire delegation; from Somerset,\r\nFred. Frelinghuysen; from Gloucester, Andw. Hunter; from Salem, Edmund\r\nWetherby; from Hunterdon, David Brearley and Joshua Corshon; from\r\nMorris, John Jacob Faesch; and from Sussex, Robert Ogden and Thomas\r\nAnderson, and even the Secretary, Saml. W. Stockton, was a considerable\r\nholder. Thus every county except Cumberland, Cape-of-May, Burlington,\r\nand Monmouth had its spokesmen for public creditors.[661]\r\n\r\n_Delaware._—Although there had been a strong paper money party in\r\nDelaware it does not seem to have manifested any considerable influence\r\nin the ratification of the Constitution, for that commonwealth was the\r\nfirst to set its seal on the new instrument, and it did so with apparent\r\nunanimity. No detailed scrutiny of the local contests over the election\r\nof delegates has ever been made; and the records of the loan office of\r\nthat state preserved in the Treasury Department are defective. The\r\nrecords for taxation are also of little help. The absence of any contest\r\nof course contributes to obscuring the economic forces which may have\r\nbeen at work.[662]\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania._—In strong contrast to the uniformity in Delaware is the\r\nsharp division which existed in Pennsylvania. There, says Libby, “the\r\nopposition to the Constitution came from those counties belonging to the\r\ngreat interior highland of the state, extending from the head waters of\r\nthe Schuylkill to the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, with only\r\nHuntingdon county (one vote—Federal) interrupting the continuity from\r\neast to west.... The Federal area contained ... York, Lancaster,\r\nChester, Montgomery, Philadelphia, Bucks, Luzerne, and Northampton, and\r\nthe largest population, most of the men of wealth and influence and the\r\ncommercial classes of the state. Pittsburg with 400 inhabitants was\r\nFederal in an Anti-Federal county.”[663]\r\n\r\nEach of the eastern counties of Pennsylvania was represented in the\r\nstate convention by one or more members who held public securities.[664]\r\nFrom Philadelphia city and county, five of the ten members, all of whom\r\nfavored ratification, were interested in stocks, George Latimer, James\r\nWilson, Thomas M’Kean, Samuel Ashmead, and Enoch Edwards. From Bucks\r\ncame John Barclay, a large dealer, to whose credit $17,056.56 is set\r\ndown in one entry. Two of the six members from Chester, John Hannum and\r\nThomas Bull, were security holders. James Morris, of Montgomery county,\r\nJohn Black and David Grier, from York, Timothy Pickering, from Luzerne,\r\nStephen Balliet, David Deshler, and Joseph Horsfield of Northampton\r\n(three of the four from that county) were interested. From Lancaster\r\ncame Jasper Yeates, a large holder (one entry $11,986.65), Robert\r\nColeman, Sebastian Graff, and John Hubley (four of the six delegates),\r\nwho had a first-hand knowledge of the relation of a new and stable\r\ngovernment to public paper.\r\n\r\nIn other words at least nineteen out of the forty-six men who voted for\r\nthe Constitution in the Pennsylvania convention were interested in\r\npublic paper at or about the time of the adoption of the Constitution.\r\nTheir names follow with the references to each,[665] but it is not to be\r\nsupposed that this list is complete, for the records of Pennsylvania are\r\nnot full, and a great many of the transactions in that state were not\r\nwith the local loan office, but directly with the Treasury, a part of\r\nwhose early records were probably burned in one of the fires at the\r\nTreasury Building:\r\n\r\n                         Samuel Ashmead (I)\r\n                         Stephen Balliet (LT)\r\n                         John Barclay (JA)\r\n                         John Black (M)\r\n                         Thomas Bull (I)\r\n                         Robert Coleman (R)\r\n                         David Deshler (M)\r\n                         Enoch Edwards (JA)\r\n                         Sebastian Graff (I)\r\n                         David Grier (I)\r\n                         John Hannum (3 C)\r\n                         Joseph Horsfield (M)\r\n                         John Hubley (77)\r\n                         George Latimer (JB)\r\n                         Thomas M’Kean (M)\r\n                         James Morris (I)\r\n                         Timothy Pickering (I)\r\n                         James Wilson (I)\r\n                         Jasper Yeates (JA)\r\n\r\nFortunately, also other data are easily available for the study of the\r\neconomic interests of the members of the Pennsylvania convention.\r\nMcMaster and Stone[666] have appended to their work on the ratification\r\nof the Constitution in that state brief biographical sketches of the\r\nmembers of the convention, in which many clues are given to their\r\nrespective economic interests. The following table is prepared from\r\nthese biographies, and every effort is made to state in the language of\r\nthe authors the exact occupation and interests of the delegates. These\r\ndetails are given so that the student may draw his conclusions\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\n\r\n               MEMBERS WHO VOTED IN FAVOR OF RATIFICATION\r\n\r\n  John Allison “received a thorough English and classical education;”\r\n  laid out the town of Greencastle in 1781; in the War, rank of Colonel.\r\n\r\n  John Arndt.

Local\r\n  office-holder.\r\n\r\n  Nicholas Lotz was a millwright by occupation and established a mill\r\n  near Reading. Was in the War.\r\n\r\n  James Marshel “moved to the western country some three years prior to\r\n  the Revolution, and settled in what is now Cross Creek Township.”\r\n  Frontiersman and local officer.\r\n\r\n  James Martin was born in the Cumberland valley and resided in what was\r\n  then (1772) Colerain township. Was in the War.\r\n\r\n  Adam Orth was “brought up amid the dangers and struggles of\r\n  Pennsylvania pioneer life. He received the limited education of the\r\n  ‘back settlements.’... He was one of the pioneers in the manufacture\r\n  of iron in Lebanon county.”\r\n\r\n  John Reynolds.\r\n\r\n  Joseph Powell.\r\n\r\n  John Smilie. His father settled in Lancaster county and evidently was\r\n  a farmer. In 1781 John Smilie “removed with his family to then\r\n  Westmoreland county,” which meant that he went to the frontier.\r\n  Office-holder.\r\n\r\n  William Todd went to Western Pennsylvania about 1765 and later\r\n  “removed to Westmoreland county where he settled upon land\r\n  subsequently warranted to him.”\r\n\r\n  John Whitehill, “son of an Irish immigrant who settled on Pequea Creek\r\n  in 1723.” Received a good education. Local office-holder. At his death\r\n  he left “a large landed estate”.\r\n\r\n  Robert Whitehill, brother of the above Whitehill. “In the spring of\r\n  1771 he removed to Cumberland county, locating on a farm two miles\r\n  west of Harrisburg.” Extensive public career. “Died at his residence\r\n  in Cumberland county two miles west of the Susquehanna.” Evidently\r\n  dependent largely upon agriculture, but farmer of some means.\r\n\r\nObviously such a table is more or less superficial so far as economic\r\naspects are concerned, for the forms of wealth possessed by each member\r\nand the numerical proportions of the several forms at the time of the\r\nPennsylvania state convention are not apparent. More than the ordinary\r\nmargin must therefore be allowed for error on both sides. Evidently also\r\nit is difficult to classify these men from the meagre data given; but\r\nthe following table may be taken to be roughly correct as to the men\r\nabout whom we have some economic facts.\r\n\r\n ═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════╤═══════════════════════\r\n                        │ FOR THE CONSTITUTION  │        AGAINST\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n Merchants              │                      4│                      1\r\n Lawyers                │                      8│                      1\r\n Doctors                │                      2│\r\n Clergymen              │                      2│\r\n Farmers                │                     10│                     13\r\n Capitalists            │                     12│                      3\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────────────────\r\n   Total classifiable   │                     38│                     18\r\n ═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════╧═══════════════════════\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-eight in favor of the Constitution, who may be reasonably\r\nclassified, ten, or one-fourth, represented agricultural interests\r\nprimarily. Of the eighteen, opposed to the Constitution, who may be\r\nsatisfactorily classified, thirteen or more than two-thirds were\r\nprimarily identified with agricultural interests. Of the forty-six\r\nfavorable, twenty were capitalists and lawyers; of the twenty-three\r\nopposed, four were in these categories. When all allowance for error is\r\nmade, the result is highly significant and bears out the general\r\nconclusion that the Constitution was a reflex of personalty rather than\r\nrealty interests.\r\n\r\n_Maryland._—In Maryland the mercantile interests of the towns were all\r\non the side of the Constitution; and as the urban centres were the seats\r\nof operations in public securities these too must be thrown into the\r\nbalance. The opposition came from the rural districts and particularly\r\nfrom the paper money constituencies. Libby discovered there, “a\r\ncorrespondence between the friends of paper money and debt laws and the\r\nAnti-Federal party of 1788, both as to leaders and to the rank and file\r\nof the respective parties.”[667]\r\n\r\nBut it should be noted that we are now leaving the regions of small\r\nfarms and of estates tilled by free labor and are coming into the\r\ndistricts where slavery and the plantation system dominate rural\r\neconomy. Indeed, the slaveholding plantations were so extensive and the\r\nsmall farming class so restricted that the paper money party would have\r\nbeen seriously weakened had it not been for the fact that their ranks\r\nwere recruited from other sources. A contemporary, speaking of the\r\nelection of delegates to the convention, says: “Baltimore and Hartford\r\ncounties alone are clearly anti-Federal, in which are many powerful and\r\npopular men who have speculated deeply in British confiscated property\r\nand for that reason are alarmed at shutting the door against state paper\r\nmoney. The same men, their relations and particular friends are more\r\nviolently anti-Federal because they paid considerable sums into the\r\ntreasury in depreciated continental currency and are scared at the\r\nsweeping clause ... which may bring about a due execution of the treaty\r\nbetween Great Britain and America to their loss.[668]\r\n\r\n_Virginia._—Fortunately, for Virginia we have a somewhat detailed study\r\nof the economic forces in the politics of that commonwealth by Dr.\r\nCharles H. Ambler. By way of preparation he examines the geographical\r\ndistribution of economic characteristics, and takes up first the\r\nTidewater region. Of this portion of the state, he says, “The\r\nindustrial, social and political life of the Tidewater centered in the\r\nlarge estate.... The society which developed in the Tidewater ...\r\nresembled that of the mother country. It consisted of several strata\r\nseparated by no clearly marked lines. Along the large rivers there were\r\nthe great landowners who lived in a style of luxury and extravagance\r\nbeyond the means of other inhabitants. Immediately below them were the\r\nhalf-breeds, persons descended from the younger sons and daughters of\r\nthe landed proprietors. They had all the pride and social tastes of the\r\nupper class but not its wealth. Then came the ‘pretenders,’ men of\r\nindustry and enterprise but not of established families.... Below these\r\nclasses were the ‘yeomen,’ most of whom were very poor. The system of\r\nentail and primogeniture operated to preserve these strata intact.”[669]\r\nThe Tidewater region was almost solid in favor of ratifying the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe second geographical division of Virginia, according to Dr. Ambler,\r\nwas the Piedmont region, which resembled in many respects the Tidewater\r\nbut had some decided characteristics of its own. “Although one and\r\ntwo-thirds times as large as the Tidewater, the Piedmont, in 1790\r\ncontained a much smaller negro slave population. Immigrants from the\r\nnorthern colonies, who, as will be shown, had pushed into the Valley,\r\ncame into the Piedmont from the rear. For the most part they were\r\nconscientiously opposed to slaveholding and consequently did not become\r\ntobacco-growers. On the other hand the poorer whites of the Tidewater\r\nhad been pushed by the gradual advance of the plantation into the less\r\ndesirable lands of the Piedmont. Lack of ability and the presence of\r\nconscientious scruples prevented them from becoming large planters.\r\nThese elements constituted a large and influential democratic and\r\nnon-slaveholding population in the Piedmont.”[670] This region was\r\nlargely against ratifying the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Piedmont lay the Valley which was largely settled by\r\nScotch-Irish and Germans, and the economic basis was the small farm with\r\nall that it implies. Here the political theories, says Ambler “differed\r\nwidely from those entertained in the east. The Germans and the\r\nScotch-Irish brought to the Valley the sacred traditions of the years of\r\nreligious wars which taught hatred to an established church, antipathy\r\nto a government by the privileged, and a love for civic and personal\r\nliberty. To the Scotch-Irish, the political leaders, civil liberty meant\r\nfreedom of person, the right of fee-simple possession, and an open door\r\nto civic honors.”[671] The markets for this region were at Baltimore and\r\nPhiladelphia. This fact, coupled with several peculiar social\r\ncharacteristics may partially account for the heavy vote for the\r\nConstitution; but the sentiment in favor of the new government in this\r\nregion has not yet been traced to economic reasons.\r\n\r\nTo the far West lay the Kentucky region whose frontier economic\r\ncharacteristics need no description. There the sentiment was almost\r\nsolid against the ratification of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the movement for the adoption of a new national\r\nConstitution, the self-sufficient western regions of Virginia were\r\npractically indifferent; and the eastern section was the part of the\r\nstate in which there was a conscious determination to bring about a\r\nchange. At this time, says Ambler, “The towns of the Tidewater chafed\r\nunder the British restrictions upon trade and desired better commercial\r\nrelations between the states. Of the numerous petitions to the assembly\r\non these subjects, that from Norfolk was, perhaps, the most significant.\r\nIt claimed that the restrictions on the West India trade and the foreign\r\ncommercial monopolies were producing injury to Virginia, and asked for\r\nrestriction on British trade and better commercial relations between the\r\nstates.... Petitions of a similar tone came from Fredericksburg,\r\nFalmouth, Alexandria, and Port Royal.”[672]\r\n\r\nAgainst the indifference and opposition of the western districts, the\r\neast prevailed in the contest over the proposition to send delegates to\r\nthe federal Convention; and Washington, Madison, Mason, Henry, Randolph,\r\nWythe, and Blair were named—“all residents of the Tidewater, except\r\nHenry and Madison.”[673] This result was partly due to the fact that the\r\nTidewater region was over-represented in the state legislature according\r\nto population, and partly to the superior cohesion of the interests\r\naffected.[674]\r\n\r\nThe same economic antagonism that was manifested in the selection of\r\ndelegates to the federal Convention was again manifested in the state\r\nconvention called to ratify the Constitution. “The democratic leaders of\r\nthe interior,” says Ambler, “declared that it [the Constitution]\r\nsacrificed the state’s sovereignty. Accordingly they made a desperate\r\nfight to secure the election of delegates pledged to vote against\r\nratification. When the canvass was ended it was not known which side\r\nwould be successful, so evenly were the friends and enemies of the new\r\nplan of federal government matched. From the Tidewater came a strong\r\ndelegation favorable to ratification. It numbered among its members the\r\nmost prominent characters of the Virginia bar, former sympathizers with\r\nGreat Britain, and representatives of interests essentially commercial.\r\nThe other delegates favorable to ratification came from the Valley and\r\nthe northwestern part of the state. Most of them had seen service in the\r\nRevolutionary armies and were largely under the influence of Washington.\r\nThe Kentucky country and the Piedmont sent delegates opposed to\r\nratification.... The vote on the ratification was: ayes 89, nays 79 ...\r\npractically all the lower Tidewater [being] in favor of ratification.\r\nOnly two delegates from Shenandoah valley and that part of the\r\nTrans-Alleghany north of the Great Kanawha voted nay. The democratic\r\nPiedmont and the Kentucky country was almost unanimous in opposition to\r\nthe Constitution.”[675]\r\n\r\nThese conclusions reached by Ambler closely support Libby’s survey. In\r\nspeaking of the distribution of the vote on the Constitution in\r\nVirginia, he says: “Four well-marked sections are to be noted.... The\r\nfirst, the eastern, comprised all the counties in tidewater Virginia.\r\nIts vote on the Constitution stood 80 per cent for and 20 per cent\r\nagainst ratification. This was the region of the large towns, and where\r\ncommercial interests were predominant. The middle district, lying\r\nfarther west to the Blue Ridge mountains, represented the interior\r\nfarming interests of the state; the class of small farmers made up the\r\nprincipal part of its population. Its vote on the Constitution stood 26\r\nper cent for and 74 per cent against adoption. The third, the West\r\nVirginia district is really double, composed of the Shenandoah Valley,\r\nin which lay the bulk of the population and the sparsely settled\r\nTrans-Alleghany region. This, also, was an agricultural section with a\r\npopulation chiefly Scotch-Irish and Germans from Pennsylvania. Its vote\r\nstood 97 per cent for and 3 per cent against the Constitution....[676]\r\nThe fourth, or Kentucky district comprised all that territory west of\r\nthe great Kanawha to the Cumberland River. Its vote stood 10 per cent\r\nfor and 90 per cent against.... The question of the opening of the\r\nMississippi river was the decisive one in determining the vote of this\r\nsection.”[677]\r\n\r\nThat public securities also carried some weight in the Virginia counties\r\nwhich were strongly favorable to the Constitution is shown by the\r\nfollowing table of the delegates (all, except Thomas Read, favorable to\r\nthe Constitution) to the state convention from the towns and the\r\nseaboard or tidewater regions. Those italicised were holders of paper to\r\nsome amount and appear on the _Index to Virginia Funds_ in the Mss. of\r\nthe Treasury Department. Those not italicised were not discovered on the\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n Fairfax County—_David Stuart_ and _Charles Simms_.\r\n King George—Burdet Ashton and William Thornton.\r\n Westmoreland—_Henry Lee_ and _Bushrod Washington_.\r\n Northumberland—Walter Jones and Thomas Gaskins.\r\n Richmond County—_Walker Tomlin_ (as Executor) and _William Peachy_ (as\r\n    Executor).\r\n Lancaster—James Gordon and Henry Towles.\r\n Gloucester—_Warner Lewis_ and Thomas Smith.\r\n\r\n York—_John Blair_ and _George Wyeth_.\r\n Princess Anne—Anthony Walke and Thomas Walke.\r\n Norfolk—James Webb and _James Taylor_. (Portsmouth.)\r\n Henrico—(Richmond City)—_Edmund Randolph_ and _John Marshall_.\r\n James City—_Nathl. Burwell_ and _Robert Andrews_.\r\n Elizabeth City—Miles King and Worlich Westwood.\r\n Charlotte—_Paul Carrington_ and Thomas Read.[678]\r\n\r\n_North Carolina._—North Carolina was at first overwhelmingly\r\nAnti-Federal. It had peculiar economic characteristics. Though in the\r\nsouth, it had a large body of small farmers; and the great slave-tilled\r\nplantation was not such a marked feature of its economy as it was of\r\nSouth Carolina. It had small mercantile interests as compared with\r\nMassachusetts, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina,\r\nwith their considerable seaport towns. And perhaps most significant of\r\nall was the fact that a very large proportion of the public securities\r\nin that state were bought up by speculators from northern cities[679]\r\nand therefore not held by native inhabitants in the centres of\r\ninfluence. This must have had a very deadening effect on the spirit of\r\nthe movement for ratification.\r\n\r\nOwing to these peculiarities, it is impossible to lay out North Carolina\r\ninto such sharply differentiated economic regions as some of the other\r\ncommonwealths. Nevertheless, certain lines are marked out by Libby in\r\nhis survey of the vote in 1789 when the Constitution was finally\r\nratified. “The counties around Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds constituted\r\nthe bulk of the federal area.... This region was the earliest settled,\r\nthe most densely populated, and represented most of the mercantile and\r\ncommercial interests of the state.” With this region went some\r\nadditional inland districts when the swing to the Federalists carried\r\nthe state for ratification. The second region was in the centre of the\r\nstate where the “interests were wholly agricultural;” this region was\r\nstrongly Anti-Federal. To it was added the Tennessee region, also\r\nAnti-Federal, for the same reasons that carried western Virginia against\r\nthe Constitution.[680]\r\n\r\n_South Carolina._—South Carolina presents the economic elements in the\r\nratification with the utmost simplicity. There we find two rather\r\nsharply marked districts in antagonism over the Constitution. “The rival\r\nsections,” says Libby, “were the coast or lower district and the upper,\r\nor more properly, the middle and upper country. The coast region was the\r\nfirst settled and contained a larger portion of the wealth of the state;\r\nits mercantile and commercial interests were important; its church was\r\nthe Episcopal, supported by the state.” This region, it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to remark, was overwhelmingly in favor of the Constitution.\r\nThe upper area, against the Constitution, “was a frontier section, the\r\nlast to receive settlement; its lands were fertile and its mixed\r\npopulation were largely small farmers.... There was no established\r\nchurch, each community supported its own church and there was a great\r\nvariety in the district.”[681]\r\n\r\nA contemporary writer, R. G. Harper, calls attention to the fact that\r\nthe lower country, Charleston, Beaufort, and Georgetown, which had\r\n28,694 white inhabitants, and about seven-twelfths of the representation\r\nin the state convention, paid £28,081:5:10 taxes in 1794, while the\r\nupper country, with 120,902 inhabitants, and five-twelfths of the\r\nrepresentation in the convention, paid only £8390:13:3 taxes.[682] The\r\nlower districts in favor of the Constitution therefore possessed the\r\nwealth of the state and a disproportionate share in the convention—on\r\nthe basis of the popular distribution of representation.[683]\r\n\r\nThese divisions of economic interest are indicated by the abstracts of\r\nthe tax returns for the state in 1794 which show that of £127,337 worth\r\nof stock in trade, faculties, etc. listed for taxation in the state,\r\n£109,800 worth was in Charleston, city and county—the stronghold of\r\nFederalism. Of the valuation of lots in towns and villages to the amount\r\nof £656,272 in the state, £549,909 was located in that city and\r\ncounty.[684]\r\n\r\nThe records of the South Carolina loan office preserved in the Treasury\r\nDepartment at Washington show that the public securities of that state\r\nwere more largely in the hands of inhabitants than was the case in North\r\nCarolina. They also show a heavy concentration in the Charleston\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nAt least fourteen of the thirty-one members of the state ratifying\r\nconvention from the parishes of St. Philip and Saint Michael, Charleston\r\n(all of whom favored ratification) held over $75,000 worth of public\r\nsecurities, which amount was distributed unevenly among the following\r\nmen:\r\n\r\n                         John Blake\r\n                         Danl. Cannon\r\n                         Edw. Darrell\r\n                         John F. Grimke\r\n                         Wm. Johnson\r\n                         Thomas Jones\r\n                         Lewis Morris\r\n                         Isaac Motte\r\n                         C. C. Pinckney\r\n                         John Pringle\r\n                         David Ramsay\r\n                         Nathaniel Russel\r\n                         Josiah Smith\r\n                         Danl. de Soussure[685]\r\n\r\n_Georgia._—Georgia was one of the states that gave a speedy and\r\nunanimous consent to the adoption of the Constitution. If there was any\r\nconsiderable contest there, no record of it appears on the surface; and\r\nno thorough research has ever been made into the local unprinted\r\nrecords.[686] Libby dismisses the state with the suggestion that the\r\npressing dangers from the Indians on the frontiers, which were\r\nformidable and threatening in the summer and autumn of 1787, were\r\nlargely responsible for the swift and favorable action of the state in\r\nratifying the new instrument of government that promised protection\r\nunder national arms.[687]\r\n\r\nThree conclusions seem warranted by the data presented in this chapter:\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the movement for the ratification of the Constitution\r\ncentred particularly in the regions in which mercantile, manufacturing,\r\nsecurity, and personalty interests generally had their greatest\r\nstrength, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that holders of\r\npersonalty saw in the new government a strength and defence to their\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as so many leaders in the movement for ratification were large\r\nsecurity holders, and inasmuch as securities constituted such a large\r\nproportion of personalty, this economic interest must have formed a very\r\nconsiderable dynamic element, if not the preponderating element, in\r\nbringing about the adoption of the new system.\r\n\r\nThe state conventions do not seem to have been more “disinterested” than\r\nthe Philadelphia convention; but in fact the leading champions of the\r\nnew government appear to have been, for the most part, men of the same\r\npractical type, with actual economic advantages at stake.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the Constitution almost uniformly came from the\r\nagricultural regions, and from the areas in which debtors had been\r\nformulating paper money and other depreciatory schemes.[688]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n  THE ECONOMIC CONFLICT OVER RATIFICATION AS VIEWED BY CONTEMPORARIES\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving discovered the nature of the social conflict connected with the\r\nformation and adoption of the Constitution, and having shown the\r\nprobable proportion of the people who participated in the conflict and\r\nthe several group interests into which they fell, it is interesting,\r\nthough not fundamentally important, to inquire whether the leading\r\nthinkers of the time observed the nature of the antagonisms present in\r\nthe process. A full statement of the results of such an inquiry would\r\nrequire far more space than is at command in this volume; and\r\nconsequently only a few illustrative and representative opinions can be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nNo one can pore for weeks over the letters, newspapers, and pamphlets of\r\nthe years 1787–1789 without coming to the conclusion that there was a\r\ndeep-seated conflict between a popular party based on paper money and\r\nagrarian interests, and a conservative party centred in the towns and\r\nresting on financial, mercantile, and personal property interests\r\ngenerally. It is true that much of the fulmination in pamphlets was\r\nconcerned with controversies over various features of the Constitution;\r\nbut those writers who went to the bottom of matters, such as the authors\r\nof _The Federalist_, and the more serious Anti-Federalists, gave careful\r\nattention to the basic elements in the struggle as well as to the\r\nincidental controversial details.\r\n\r\nThe superficiality of many of the ostensible reasons put forth by the\r\nopponents of the Constitution was penetrated by Madison. Writing to\r\nJefferson, in October, 1788, he says: “The little pamphlet herewith\r\ninclosed will give you a collective view of the alterations which have\r\nbeen proposed by the State Conventions for the new Constitution. Various\r\nand numerous as they appear, they certainly omit many of the true\r\ngrounds of opposition. The articles relating to Treaties, to paper\r\nmoney, and to contracts, created more enemies than all the errors in the\r\nsystem, positive and negative, put together.”[689]\r\n\r\nNaturally the more circumspect of the pamphleteers who lent their\r\nsupport to the new system were careful about a too precise alignment of\r\nforces, for their strength often lay in the conciliation of opponents\r\nrather than in exciting a more deep-seated antagonism. But even in such\r\nconciliatory publications the material advantages to be expected from\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution are constantly put forward.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, this extract from a mollifying “Address to the\r\nFreemen of America” issued while the Convention was in the midst of its\r\ndeliberations: “Let the public creditor, who lent his money to his\r\ncountry, and the soldier and citizen who yielded their services, come\r\nforward next and contribute their aid to establish an effective federal\r\ngovernment. It is from the united power and resources of America only\r\nthat they can expect permanent and substantial justice.... Let the\r\ncitizens of America who inhabit the western counties of our states fly\r\nto a federal power for protection [against the Indians].... Let the\r\nfarmer who groans beneath the weight of direct taxation seek relief from\r\na government whose extensive jurisdiction will enable it to extract the\r\nresources of our country by means of imposts and customs. Let the\r\nmerchant, who complains of the restrictions and exclusions imposed upon\r\nhis vessels by foreign nations, unite his influence in establishing a\r\npower that shall retaliate those injuries and insure him success in his\r\nhonest pursuits by a general system of commercial regulations. Let the\r\nmanufacturer and mechanic, who are everywhere languishing for want of\r\nemployment, direct their eyes to an assembly of the states. It will be\r\nin their power only to encourage such arts and manufactures as are\r\nessential to the prosperity of our country.”[690]\r\n\r\nIt is in the literature of the contest in the states where the battle\r\nover ratification was hottest that we find the most frank recognition of\r\nthe fact that one class of property interests was in conflict with\r\nanother. This recognition appears not so much in attacks on opponents as\r\nin appeals to the groups which have the most at stake in the outcome of\r\nthe struggle, although virulent abuse of debtors and paper money\r\nadvocates is quite common. Merchants, money lenders, public creditors\r\nare constantly urged to support the Constitution on the ground that\r\ntheir economic security depends upon the establishment of the new\r\nnational government.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the spirit of the battle over ratification is best reflected in\r\nthe creed ironically attributed to each of the contending parties by its\r\nopponents. The recipe for an Anti-Federalist essay which indicates in a\r\nvery concise way the class-bias that actuated the opponents of the\r\nConstitution, ran in this manner: “Wellborn, nine times—Aristocracy,\r\neighteen times—Liberty of the Press, thirteen times repeated—Liberty of\r\nConscience, once—Negro slavery, once mentioned—Trial by jury, seven\r\ntimes—Great Men, six times repeated—Mr. Wilson, forty times....—put them\r\naltogether and dish them up at pleasure.”[691]\r\n\r\nTo this sarcastic statement of their doctrines, the Anti-Federalists\r\nreplied by formulating the “Political Creed of Every Federalist” as\r\nfollows: “I believe in the infallibility, all-sufficient wisdom, and\r\ninfinite goodness of the late convention; or in other words, I believe\r\nthat some men are of so perfect a nature that it is absolutely\r\nimpossible for them to commit errors or design villainy. I believe that\r\nthe great body of the people are incapable of judging in their nearest\r\nconcerns, and that, therefore, they ought to be guided by the opinions\r\nof their superiors.... I believe that aristocracy is the best form of\r\ngovernment.... I believe that trial by jury and the freedom of the press\r\nought to be exploded from every wise government.... I believe that the\r\nnew constitution will prove the bulwark of liberty—the balm of\r\nmisery—the essence of justice—and the astonishment of all mankind. In\r\nshort, I believe that it is the best form of government which has ever\r\nbeen offered to the world. I believe that to speak, write, read, think,\r\nor hear any thing against the proposed government is damnable heresy,\r\nexecrable rebellion, and high treason against the sovereign majesty of\r\nthe convention—And lastly I believe that every person who differs from\r\nme in belief is an infernal villain. AMEN.”[692]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  MARSHALL’S ANALYSIS OF THE CONFLICT\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that this antagonism of economic interests which,\r\nin the language of controversy, frequently took on the form of a war\r\nbetween “aristocracy” and “democracy” was observed only by partisans\r\nwhose views were distorted by the heat of battle. On the contrary, it\r\nwas understood by the keenest thinkers—in fact, one may say that the\r\nmore profound the wisdom of the observer, the clearer was his\r\ncomprehension of the issues at stake. Next to Madison, whose concept of\r\nthe Constitution-making process has already been fully discussed,[693]\r\nJohn Marshall probably understood best the nature of the new instrument,\r\nthe social forces which produced it, and the great objects it was\r\ndesigned to accomplish. In speaking from the bench, as Chief Justice, he\r\nused, of course, the language of jurisprudence and spoke of the\r\nConstitution as a creation of the whole people.[694] But as a historian\r\nof great acumen, in which capacity he was not hampered by the\r\ntraditional language of the bench and bar, Marshall sketched with\r\nunerring hand the economic conflict which led to the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, and impressed itself upon the nature of that instrument.\r\nIn his masterly _Life of Washington_, he sets forth this conflict in\r\nunmistakable terms:\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, the mercantile interest was sorely tried under\r\nthe Articles of Confederation. There “was a general discontent with the\r\ncourse of trade. It had commenced with the native merchants of the north\r\nwho found themselves incapable of contending in their own ports with\r\nforeigners; and was soon communicated to others. The gazettes of Boston\r\ncontained some very animated and angry addresses which produced\r\nresolutions for the government of the citizens of that town,\r\napplications to their state legislature, a petition to congress, and a\r\ncircular letter to the merchants of the several sea ports throughout the\r\nUnited States.... The merchants of the city of Philadelphia presented a\r\nmemorial to the legislature of that state, in which, after lamenting it\r\nas a fundamental defect in the constitution that full and entire power\r\nover the commerce of the United States had not been originally vested in\r\nCongress ... they prayed that the legislature would endeavour to procure\r\nfrom Congress a recommendation to the several states to vest in that\r\nbody the necessary powers over the commerce of the United States.”[695]\r\n\r\n2. The public creditors had lost faith in the old government. “That the\r\ndebt of the United States should have greatly depreciated will excite no\r\nsurprise when it is recollected that the government of the Union\r\npossessed no funds, and without the assent of jealous and independent\r\nsovereigns could acquire none to pay the accruing interest; but the\r\ndepreciation of the debt due from those states, which made an annual and\r\nadequate provision for the interest, can be ascribed only to a want of\r\nconfidence in the governments which were controlled by no fixed\r\nprinciples; and it is therefore not entirely unworthy of attention. In\r\nmany of those states which had repelled every attempt to introduce into\r\ncirculation a depreciated medium of commerce or to defeat the annual\r\nprovision of funds for the payment of the interest, the debt sunk in\r\nvalue to ten, five, and even less than four shillings in the pound.\r\nHowever unexceptionable might be the conduct of the existing\r\nlegislature, the hazard from those which were to follow was too great to\r\nbe encountered without an immense premium.”\r\n\r\n3. A profound division ensued throughout the United States based on\r\ndifferent views of the rights of property. “At length,” continues\r\nMarshall, “two great parties were formed in every state which were\r\ndistinctly marked and which pursued distinct objects with systematic\r\narrangement. The one struggled with unabated zeal for the exact\r\nobservance of public and private engagements. By those belonging to it,\r\nthe faith of a nation or of a private man was deemed a sacred pledge,\r\nthe violation of which was equally forbidden by the principles of moral\r\njustice and of sound policy. The distresses of individuals were, they\r\nthought, to be alleviated only by industry and frugality, not by a\r\nrelaxation of the laws or by a sacrifice of the rights of others. They\r\nwere consequently the uniform friends of a regular administration of\r\njustice, and of a vigorous course of taxation which would enable the\r\nstate to comply with its engagements. By a natural association of ideas,\r\nthey were also, with very few exceptions, in favor of enlarging the\r\npowers of the federal government....\r\n\r\n“The other party marked out for themselves a more indulgent course.\r\nViewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their efforts\r\nwere unceasingly directed to his relief. To exact a faithful compliance\r\nwith contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which the people\r\nwould not bear. They were uniformly in favor of relaxing the\r\nadministration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of\r\ndebts, or of suspending their collection, and of remitting taxes. The\r\nsame course of opinion led them to resist every attempt to transfer from\r\ntheir own hands into those of congress powers which by others were\r\ndeemed essential to the preservation of the union. In many of these\r\nstates, the party last mentioned constituted a decided majority of the\r\npeople, and in all of them it was very powerful. The emission of paper\r\nmoney, the delay of legal proceedings, and the suspension of the\r\ncollection of taxes were the fruits of their rule wherever they were\r\ncompletely predominant.... Throughout the union, a contest between these\r\nparties was periodically revived; and the public mind was perpetually\r\nagitated with hopes and fears on subjects which essentially affected the\r\nfortunes of a considerable proportion of society.”\r\n\r\n4. Finally, so sharp was this division into two parties on the lines of\r\ndivergent views of property rights, that the Constitution, far from\r\nproceeding from “the whole people,” barely escaped defeat altogether. So\r\npositive is this statement by the great Chief Justice and so decidedly\r\ndoes it contradict his juristic theory of the nature of the supreme law\r\nthat the two should be studied together. For this reason, the two views\r\nenunciated by Marshall are printed in parallel columns:\r\n\r\n “So balanced were the parties in      “The government [of the United\r\n some of them [the states] that        States] proceeds directly from\r\n even after the subject had been       the people; it is ‘ordained and\r\n discussed for a considerable time,    established’ in the name of the\r\n the fate of the constitution          people; and it is declared to be\r\n could scarcely be conjectured;        ordained ‘in order to form a more\r\n and so small in many instances,       perfect union, establish justice,\r\n was the majority in its favor,        insure domestic tranquillity, and\r\n as to afford strong ground            secure the blessings of liberty’\r\n for the opinion that, had the         to themselves and to their\r\n influence of character been           posterity.... The government of\r\n removed, the intrinsic merits of      the Union then (whatever may be\r\n the instrument would not have         the influence of this fact on the\r\n secured its adoption. Indeed it       case) is, emphatically and truly,\r\n is scarcely to be doubted that        a government of the people. In\r\n in some of the adopting states a      form and substance it emanates\r\n majority of the people were in        from them. Its powers are granted\r\n the opposition. In all of them,       by them and are to be exercised\r\n the numerous amendments which         directly on them and for their\r\n were proposed demonstrate the         benefit.... It is the government\r\n reluctance with which the new         of all; its powers are delegated\r\n government was accepted; and that     by all; it represents all, and\r\n a dread of dismemberment, not an      acts for all.” Marshall, in\r\n approbation of the particular         McCulloch _vs._ Maryland (4\r\n system under consideration, had       Wheaton, 316), in 1819.\r\n induced an acquiescence in it....\r\n North Carolina and Rhode Island\r\n did not at first accept the\r\n constitution, and New York was\r\n apparently dragged into it by a\r\n repugnance to being excluded from\r\n the confederacy.” Marshall, in his\r\n _Life of Washington_, written\r\n in 1804–07.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE CONFLICT IN THE STATES\r\n\r\nTurning aside from these more general observations on the nature of the\r\nconflict over the ratification of the Constitution, let us now take up\r\nthe struggle in the several states and examine the views entertained by\r\nsome of the representative participants in it.\r\n\r\n_New Hampshire._—That New Hampshire was rather sharply divided into an\r\n“aristocratic” and a “country” party at the period of the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution was remarked by an observing Frenchman;[696] and the\r\nNew Hampshire Spy, published at Portsmouth, in the issue of October 27,\r\n1787; aligns the mercantile and mechanical interest on the side of the\r\nnew Constitution; adding that the “honest farmer” can have no\r\nobjections, either. “The _honest man_,” runs the plea, “can have no\r\nobjection to a federal government, for while it obliges him to pay a\r\nsacred regard to past contracts, it will eventually secure him in his\r\nperson and his property. The _mercantile interest_ have suffered enough\r\n_to induce_ them to wish for, and espouse a federal reform.... The\r\n_mechanical interest_ can have no aversion to it, when they are informed\r\nthat an efficient government will protect and encourage commerce, which\r\nis the very soul of mechanism.... Nor can the _honest farmer_ have any\r\nobjection; the increase of commerce will naturally increase the demand\r\nfor such articles as he may have for sale; he will be enabled to pay his\r\ntaxes and, if economy shakes hands with industry, increase his farm and\r\nlive independent of troublesome creditors. Since then no one respectable\r\norder of citizens can have any just reason to reject the new\r\nConstitution, we may venture to conclude that none but _fools_,\r\n_blockheads_, and _mad men_ will dare oppose it.”\r\n\r\n_Massachusetts._—The contest over the Constitution in Massachusetts was\r\na sharp conflict between the personalty interests on the one hand and\r\nthe small farmers and debtors on the other, and this fact seems to have\r\nbeen recognized by every thoughtful leader on both sides. This view of\r\nthe social struggle was set forth on so many occasions and by so many\r\neminent observers that it is difficult to select from the mass of\r\nmaterial the most typical statement of the situation. Perhaps that by\r\nGeneral Knox is not excelled for its clarity and conciseness. Writing to\r\nWashington, January 14, 1788, a few days after the state convention had\r\nbegun its labors, he describes the alignment over ratification as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“There are three parties existing in that state [Massachusetts] at\r\npresent, differing in their numbers and greatly differing in their\r\nwealth and talents.\r\n\r\n“The 1st. is the commercial part of the state to which are added all the\r\nmen of considerable property, the clergy, the lawyers—including all the\r\njudges of all the courts, and all the officers of the late army, and\r\nalso the neighborhood of all the great towns—its numbers may include\r\n3/7ths of the state. This party are for vigorous government, perhaps\r\nmany of them would have been still more pleased with the new\r\nConstitution had it been more analogous to the British Constitution.\r\n\r\n“The 2d party are the eastern part of the state lying beyond New\r\nHampshire formerly the province of Main—This party are chiefly looking\r\ntowards the erection of a new state and the majority of them will adopt\r\nor reject the new Constitution as it may facilitate or retard their\r\ndesigns—this party 2/7ths.\r\n\r\n“The 3d party are the Insurgents or their favorers, the great majority\r\nof whom are for an annihilation of debts, public and private, and\r\ntherefore they will not approve the new Constitution—this party\r\n2/7ths.”[697]\r\n\r\nSeveral months before Knox had formulated this view of the conflict,\r\nindeed, early in the struggle over ratification, the Federalist\r\nagitators were busy with appeals to practical economic interests. The\r\nMassachusetts Gazette of October 26, 1787, for example, contains a\r\nletter signed by “Marcus” in which the groups likely to be affected\r\nadvantageously by the new Constitution are enumerated and an argument\r\ndirected to each of them: “It is the interest of the merchants to\r\nencourage the new constitution, because commerce may then be a national\r\nobject, and nations will form treaties with us. It is the interest of\r\nthe mechanicks to join the mercantile interest, because it is not their\r\ninterest to quarrel with their bread and butter. It is the interest of\r\nthe farmer because the prosperity of commerce gives vent to his produce,\r\nraises the value of his lands, and commercial duties will alleviate the\r\nburden of his taxes. It is the interest of the landholder, because\r\nthousands in Europe, with moderate fortunes will migrate to this country\r\nif an efficient government gives them a prospect of tranquillity. It is\r\nthe interest of all gentlemen and men of property, because they will see\r\nmany low demagogues reduced to their tools, whose upstart dominion\r\ninsults their feelings, and whose passions for popularity will dictate\r\nlaws, which ruin the minority of creditors and please the majority of\r\ndebtors. It is the interest of the American soldier as the military\r\nprofession will then be respectable and Florida may be conquered in a\r\ncampaign. The spoils of the West Indies and South America may enrich the\r\nnext generation of Cincinnati. It is the interest of the lawyers who\r\nhave ability and genius, because the dignities in the Supreme Court will\r\ninterest professional ambition and create emulation which is not now\r\nfelt.... It is the interest of the clergy, as civil tumults excite every\r\npassion—the soul is neglected and the clergy starve. It is the interest\r\nof all men whose education has been liberal and extensive because there\r\nwill be a theatre for the display of talents.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, from the very beginning of the movement, the most eminent\r\nadvocates of a new system were aware of the real nature of the struggle\r\nwhich lay before them. They knew that there was a deep-seated antagonism\r\nbetween the “natural aristocracy” and the “turbulent democracy” which\r\nwas giving the government of Massachusetts trouble. Such an analysis of\r\nthe difficulty is set forth by Stephen Higginson, a leading Federalist\r\nof Boston, in March, 1787: “The people of the interior parts of these\r\nstates [New England] have by far too much political knowledge and too\r\nstrong a relish for unrestrained freedom, to be governed by our feeble\r\nsystem, and too little acquaintance with real sound policy or rational\r\nfreedom and too little virtue to govern themselves. They have become too\r\nwell acquainted with their own weight in the political scale under such\r\ngovernments as ours and have too high a taste for luxury and dissipation\r\nto sit down contented in their proper line, when they see others\r\npossessed of much more property than themselves. With these feelings and\r\nsentiments they will not be quiet while such distinctions exist as to\r\nrank and property; and sensible of their own force, they will not rest\r\neasy till they possess the reins of Government and have divided property\r\nwith their betters, or they shall be compelled by force to submit to\r\ntheir proper stations and mode of living.”[698]\r\n\r\nDiscerning opponents of the Constitution, as well as its advocates, were\r\naware of the alignment of forces in the battle. Rufus King explained to\r\nMadison in January, 1788, that the opposition was grounded on antagonism\r\nto property rather than to the outward aspects of the new system.\r\n“Apprehension that the liberties of the people are in danger,” he said,\r\n“and a distrust of men of property or education have a more powerful\r\neffect upon the minds of our opponents than any specific objections\r\nagainst the Constitution.... The opposition complains that the lawyers,\r\njudges, clergymen, merchants, and men of education are all in favor of\r\nthe Constitution—and for that reason they appear to be able to make the\r\nworse appear the better cause.”[699]\r\n\r\nThe correctness of King’s observation is sustained by a vigorous writer\r\nin the Boston Gazette and Country Journal of November 26, 1787, who\r\ncharges the supporters of the Constitution with attempting to obscure\r\nthe real nature of the instrument, and enumerates the interests\r\nadvocating its adoption. “At length,” says the writer, “the luminary of\r\nintelligence begins to beam its effulgent rays upon this important\r\nproduction; the deceptive mists cast before the eyes of the people by\r\nthe delusive machinations of its INTERESTED advocates begins to\r\ndissipate, as darkness flies before the burning taper.... Those furious\r\nzealots who are for cramming it down the throats of the people without\r\nallowing them either time or opportunity to scan or weigh it in the\r\nbalance of their intelligences, bear the same marks in their features as\r\nthose who have been long wishing to erect an aristocracy in THIS\r\nCOMMONWEALTH—their menacing cry is for a RIGID government, it matters\r\nlittle to them of what kind, provided it answers THAT description....\r\nThey incessantly declare that none can discover any defect in the system\r\nbut bankrupts who wish no government and officers of the present\r\ngovernment who fear to lose a part of their power.... It may not be\r\nimproper to scan the characters of its most strenuous advocates: it will\r\nfirst be allowed that many undesigning citizens may wish its adoption\r\nfrom the best motives, but these are modest and silent, when compared to\r\nthe greater number, who endeavor to suppress all attempts for\r\ninvestigations; these violent partisans are for having the people gulp\r\ndown the gilded pill blindfolded, whole, and without any qualification\r\nwhatever, these consist generally, of the NOBLE order of C—s, holders of\r\npublic securities, men of great wealth and expectations of public\r\noffice, B—k—s and L—y—s: these with their train of dependents from\r\n[form] the aristocratick combination.”\r\n\r\nProbably the most reasoned statement of the antagonism of realty and\r\npersonalty in its relation to the adoption of the Constitution in\r\nMassachusetts was made in the letters of “Cornelius” on December 11 and\r\n18, 1787: “I wish,” he said, “there never might be any competition\r\nbetween the landed and the mercantile interests, nor between any\r\ndifferent classes of men whatever. Such competition will, however,\r\nexist, so long as occasion and opportunity for it is given, and while\r\nhuman nature remains the same that it has ever been. The citizens in the\r\nseaport towns are numerous; they live compact; their interests are one;\r\nthere is a constant connection and intercourse between them; they can,\r\non any occasion, centre their votes where they please. This is not the\r\ncase with those who are in the landed interest; they are scattered far\r\nand wide; they have but little intercourse and connection with each\r\nother.... I conceive a foundation is laid for throwing the whole power\r\nof the federal government into the hands of those who are in the\r\nmercantile interest; and for the landed, which is the great interest of\r\nthis country, to lie unrepresented, forlorn, and without hope. It\r\ngrieves me to suggest an idea of this kind: But I believe it to be\r\nimportant and not the mere phantom of imagination, or the result of an\r\nuneasy and restless disposition.”[700]\r\n\r\n_Connecticut._—There was no such spirited battle of wits over\r\nratification in Connecticut as occurred in Massachusetts. Nevertheless,\r\nEllsworth, in that state, produced a remarkable series of essays in\r\nsupport of the new Constitution which were widely circulated and read.\r\nIn these papers there is revealed a positive antagonism between\r\nagrarianism and personalty, but an attempt is made at conciliation by\r\nsubtly blending the two interests. Ellsworth opens: “The writer of the\r\nfollowing passed the first part of his life in mercantile employments,\r\nand by industry and economy acquired a sufficient sum on retiring from\r\ntrade to purchase and stock a decent plantation, on which he now lives\r\nin the state of a farmer. By his present employment he is interested in\r\nthe prosperity of agriculture and those who derive a support from\r\ncultivating the earth. An acquaintance with business has freed him from\r\nmany prejudices and jealousies which he sees in his neighbors who have\r\nnot intermingled with mankind nor learned by experience the method of\r\nmanaging an extensive circulating property. Conscious of an honest\r\nintention he wishes to address his brethren on some political subjects\r\nwhich now engage the public attention and will in the sequel greatly\r\ninfluence the value of landed property.”[701]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the essential implications of this statement about his\r\nprimary economic interests being those of a farmer are untrue does not\r\naffect the point here raised: Ellsworth recognised that the opposition\r\nwas agrarian in character, and he simulated the guise of a farmer to\r\nconciliate it. Later on Ellsworth classifies the opposition. In the\r\nfirst rank he puts the Tories as leading in resisting the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution because it would embarrass Great Britain. In the second\r\nclass, Ellsworth puts those who owe money. “Debtors in desperate\r\ncircumstances,” he says, “who have not resolution to be either honest or\r\nindustrious will be the next men to take alarm. They have long been\r\nupheld by the property of their creditors and the mercy of the public,\r\nand daily destroy a thousand honest men who are unsuspicious. Paper\r\nmoney and tender acts is the only atmosphere in which they can breathe\r\nand live. This is now so generally known that by being a friend to such\r\nmeasures, a man effectually advertises himself as a bankrupt.... There\r\nis another kind of people who will be found in the opposition: Men of\r\nmuch self-importance and supposed skill in politics who are not of\r\nsufficient consequence to obtain public employment, but can spread\r\njealousies in the little districts of country where they are placed.\r\nThese are always jealous of men in place and of public measures, and aim\r\nat making themselves consequential by distrusting everyone in the higher\r\noffices of society.... But in the present case men who have lucrative\r\nand influential state offices, if they act from principles of self\r\ninterest will be tempted to oppose an alteration which would doubtless\r\nbe beneficial to the people. To sink from a controulment of finance or\r\nany other great departments of the state, thro’ want of ability or\r\nopportunity to act a part in the federal system must be a terrifying\r\nconsideration.”[702]\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the Tories and office-holders, it is apparent that the\r\nelement which Ellsworth considers the most weighty in the opposition is\r\nthe agrarian party. The correctness of his analysis is supported by\r\ncollateral pieces of evidence. Sharon, one of the leading paper money\r\ntowns which opposed the ratification of the Constitution in Connecticut\r\nhad voted to assist Shays and had repeatedly attempted to secure paper\r\nemission legislation.[703] In a few letters and speeches against the\r\nConstitution the plaintive note of the agrarian is discernible.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the Constitution in Connecticut found no skilled\r\nchampions such as led the fight in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts; and\r\nno such spirited discussion took place. The debates in the state\r\nratifying convention were not recorded (save for a few fragments); but\r\nthe contest in the legislature over the proposition to send delegates to\r\nthe Philadelphia Convention showed that the resistance came from the\r\nsmaller agrarian interests similar to those in Rhode Island and\r\nMassachusetts which had stood against the whole movement.\r\n\r\nMr. Granger from Suffield was opposed to the proposition to send\r\ndelegates to Philadelphia because “he conceived it would be disagreeable\r\nto his constituents; he thought the liberties of the people would be\r\nendangered by it; ... and concluded by saying that he imagined these\r\nthings would have a tendency to produce a regal government in this\r\ncountry.” Mr. Humphrey from the inland town of Norfolk sided with Mr.\r\nGranger and “concluded by saying that he approved the wisdom and policy\r\nof Rhode Island in refusing to send delegates to the convention and that\r\nthe conduct of that state in this particular, was worthy of imitation.”\r\nMr. Perkins of Enfield “was opposed to the measure and said that the\r\nstate would send men that had been delicately bred and who were in\r\naffluent circumstances, that could not feel for the people in this day\r\nof distress.”[704]\r\n\r\n_New York._—When it is remembered that the greatest piece of\r\nargumentation produced by the contest over ratification, _The\r\nFederalist_, was directed particularly to the electorate in New York,\r\nalthough widely circulated elsewhere, it will appear a work of\r\nsupererogation to inquire whether the leaders in that commonwealth\r\nunderstood the precise nature of the social conflict which was being\r\nwaged.[705] Nevertheless, it may be worth while to present Hamilton’s\r\nanalysis of it. On the side of the Constitution, he placed the “very\r\ngreat weight of influence of the persons who framed it, particularly in\r\nthe universal popularity of General Washington—the good will of the\r\ncommercial interest throughout the states which will give all its\r\nefforts to the establishment of a government capable of regulating,\r\nprotecting, and extending the commerce of the Union—the good will of\r\nmost men of property in the several states who wish a government of the\r\nUnion able to protect them against domestic violence and the\r\ndepredations which the democratic spirit is apt to make on\r\nproperty ...—a strong belief in the people at large of the insufficiency\r\nof the present confederation to preserve the existence of the Union.”\r\n\r\nOver against these forces in favor of the Constitution, Hamilton places\r\nthe antagonism of some inconsiderable men in office under state\r\ngovernments, the influence of some considerable men playing the part of\r\nthe demagogue for their own aggrandizement;—“and add to these causes the\r\ndemocratical jealousy of the people which may be alarmed at the\r\nappearance of institutions that may seem calculated to place the power\r\nof the community in a few hands and raise a few individuals to stations\r\nof great preeminence.”[706]\r\n\r\n_New Jersey_ and _Delaware_.—The speedy ratification of the Constitution\r\nin these states gave no time for the development of a sharp antagonism,\r\neven had there been an economic basis for it. In the absence of this\r\nactual conflict over the Constitution we can hardly expect to find any\r\nconsideration of the subject by contemporary writers of note.[707]\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania._—The opposition between town and country, between\r\npersonalty and realty in other words, was so marked in this commonwealth\r\nduring the struggle over the ratification of the Constitution that it\r\nwas patent to all observers and was the subject of frequent and\r\nextensive comment by leaders on both sides. On September 28, 1787, Tench\r\nCoxe wrote to Madison describing the disturbance over the resolution in\r\nthe state legislature calling the ratifying convention, and after\r\nreciting the events of the day he added, “It appears from these facts\r\nthat the Western people [i.e. the agrarians] have a good deal of\r\njealousy about the new Constitution and it is very clear that the men\r\nwho have been used to lead the Constitutional [or radical party][708]\r\nare against it decidedly.”[709] A month later Coxe again writes to\r\nMadison: “The opposition here has become more open. It is by those\r\nleaders of the constitutional [local radical] interest who have acted in\r\nconcert with the Western interest. The people of the party in the city\r\nare chiefly federal, tho’ not so I fear in the Counties.”[710]\r\n\r\nWriting about the same time from Philadelphia to Washington, Gouverneur\r\nMorris said: “With respect to this state, I am far from being decided in\r\nmy opinion that they will consent. It is true that the City and its\r\nNeighborhood was enthusiastic in the cause; but I dread the cold and\r\nsower temper of the back counties and still more the wicked industry of\r\nthose who have long habituated themselves to live on the public, and\r\ncannot bear the idea of being removed from power and profit of state\r\ngovernment which has been and still is the means of supporting\r\nthemselves, their families, and their dependents.”[711] Such comments on\r\nthe nature of the alignment of forces might be multiplied from the\r\nwritings of other Federalist leaders in Pennsylvania, but it appears to\r\nbe unnecessary to say more.\r\n\r\nThe leaders on the other side were constantly discanting upon the\r\nopposition between town and country. The recalcitrant members of the\r\nlegislature in their protest to the people against the hasty calling of\r\nthe state convention declared, “We lamented at the time [of the\r\nselection of delegates to the national Convention] that a majority of\r\nour legislature appointed men to represent this state who were all\r\ncitizens of Philadelphia, none of them calculated to represent the\r\nlanded interests of Pennsylvania, and almost all of them of one\r\npolitical party, men who have been uniformly opposed to that [state]\r\nconstitution for which you have on every occasion manifested your\r\nattachment.”[712]\r\n\r\nThe author of the famous “Centinel” letters saw in the movement\r\nfavorable to the new Constitution a design of “the wealthy and ambitious\r\nwho in every community think they have a right to lord it over their\r\nfellow creatures.”[713] In fact the most philosophic argument against\r\nthe adoption of the new system on account of its intrinsic nature was\r\nmade by the author of these letters.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of his series, Centinel inveighs against the precipitancy\r\nwhich characterized the movements of the Federalists, and then attacks\r\nthe Constitution as the work of an active minority. “The late\r\nrevolution,” he says, “having effaced in a great measure all former\r\nhabits and the present institutions are so recent that there exists not\r\nthat great reluctance to innovation, so remarkable in old communities\r\nand which accords with reason, for the most comprehensive mind cannot\r\nforesee the full operation of material changes on civil polity.... The\r\nwealthy and ambitious, who in every community think they have a right to\r\nlord it over their fellow creatures have availed themselves very\r\nsuccessfully of this favorable disposition; for the people thus\r\nunsettled in their sentiments have been prepared to accede to any\r\nextreme of government. All the distresses and difficulties they\r\nexperience, proceeding from various causes, have been ascribed to the\r\nimpotency of the present confederation, and thence they have been led to\r\nexpect full relief from the adoption of the proposed system of\r\ngovernment; and in the other event immediately ruin and annihilation as\r\na nation.”[714]\r\n\r\nAfter warning his countrymen against being lulled into false security by\r\nthe use of the great names of Washington and Franklin in support of the\r\nConstitution, Centinel takes up the fundamental element in the new\r\nsystem: the balance of powers as expounded in Adams’ _Defence of the\r\nConstitutions_; and shows the inherent antagonism between “democracy”\r\nand the Federalist concept of government in a manner that would do honor\r\nto the warmest advocate of the initiative and referendum in our time.\r\n“Mr. Adams’ _sine qua non_ of good government is three balancing powers;\r\nwhose repelling qualities are to produce an equilibrium of interests and\r\nthereby promote the happiness of the whole community. He asserts that\r\nthe administrators of every government will ever be actuated by views of\r\nprivate interest and ambition to the prejudice of the public good; that\r\ntherefore the only effectual method to secure the rights of the people\r\nand promote their welfare is to create an opposition of interests\r\nbetween the members of two distinct bodies in the exercise of the powers\r\nof government, and balanced by those of a third. This hypothesis\r\nsupposes human wisdom competent to the task of instituting three\r\nco-equal orders in government and a corresponding weight in the\r\ncommunity to enable them respectively to exercise their several parts\r\nand whose views and interests should be so distinct as to prevent a\r\ncoalition of any two of them for the destruction of the third. Mr.\r\nAdams, although he has traced the constitution of every form of\r\ngovernment that ever existed, as far as history affords materials, has\r\nnot been able to adduce a single instance of such a government; he\r\nindeed says the British constitution is such in theory, but this is\r\nrather a confirmation that his principles are chimerical and not to be\r\nreduced to practice. If such an organization of power were practicable\r\nhow long would it continue? Not a day—for there is so great a disparity\r\nin the talents, wisdom, and industry of mankind, that the scale would\r\npresently preponderate to one or the other body, and with every\r\naccession of power the means of further increase would be greatly\r\nextended. The state of society in England is much more favorable to such\r\na scheme of government than that of America. There they have a powerful\r\nhereditary nobility, and real distinctions of rank and interests; but\r\neven there, for want of that perfect equality of power and distinction\r\nof interests in the three orders of government, they exist but in name;\r\nthe only operative and efficient check upon the conduct of\r\nadministration is the sense of the people at large.... If the\r\nadministrators of every government are actuated by views of private\r\ninterest and ambition, how is the welfare and happiness of the community\r\nto be the result of such jarring adverse interests?”[715]\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the Adams-Madison theory of balanced economic interests\r\nand innocuous legislatures, which was the essence of the Federalist\r\ndoctrine, Centinel expounded his reasons for believing that distinct\r\nproperty groups should not be set against one another in the government,\r\nand that trust in the political capacity of the broad undifferentiated\r\nmass of the community should be the basis of the Constitution; but it\r\nshould be noted that his undifferentiated mass was composed largely of\r\nproperty holders. “I believe,” he says “that it will be found that the\r\nform of government which holds those entrusted with power in the\r\ngreatest responsibility to their constituents, the best calculated for\r\nfreemen. A republican or free government can only exist where the body\r\nof the people are virtuous and _where property is pretty equally\r\ndivided_. In such a government the people are sovereign and their sense\r\nor opinion is the criterion of every public measure; for when this\r\nceases to be the case, the nature of the government is changed and an\r\naristocracy, monarchy, or despotism will rise on its ruins. The highest\r\nresponsibility is to be attained in a simple structure of government,\r\nfor the great body of the people never steadily attend to the operations\r\nof government, and for the want of due information are liable to be\r\nimposed upon. If you complicate the plan by various orders, the people\r\nwill be perplexed and divided in their sentiment about the sources of\r\nabuses or misconduct; some will impute it to the senate, others to the\r\nhouse of representatives, and so on, that the interposition of the\r\npeople may be rendered imperfect or perhaps wholly abortive. But if\r\nimitating the constitution of Pennsylvania, you vest all the legislative\r\npower in one body of men (separating the executive and the judicial),\r\nelected for a short period, and necessarily excluded by rotation from\r\npermanency and guarded from precipitancy and surprise by delays imposed\r\non its proceedings, you will create the most perfect responsibility; for\r\nthen, whenever the people feel a grievance, they cannot mistake the\r\nauthors and will apply the remedy with certainty and effect, discarding\r\nthem at the next election.”[716]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that a considerable number of the voters in Pennsylvania\r\nclearly understood the significance of the division of powers created by\r\nthe Constitution. In a petition circulated and extensively signed by\r\nPhiladelphia citizens immediately after the completion of the labors of\r\nthe Convention and directed to the state ratifying convention, the\r\nmemorialists expressed their approval of the Constitution, and added:\r\n“The division of the power of the United States into three branches\r\ngives the sincerest satisfaction to a great majority of our citizens,\r\nwho have long suffered many inconveniences from being governed by a\r\nsingle legislature. All single governments are tyrannies—whether they be\r\nlodged in one man—a few men—or a large body of the people.”[717]\r\n\r\n_Maryland._—The contest in Maryland over the ratification was keen and\r\nspirited and every side of the question was threshed out in newspaper\r\narticles and pamphlets.[718] Through all the controversy ran the\r\nrecognition of the fact that it was a struggle between debtors and\r\ncreditors, between people of substance and the agrarians. Alexander\r\nHanson in his considerable tract in favor of the ratification, dedicated\r\nto Washington, treats the charge that the Constitution was an instrument\r\nof property as worthy of a dignified answer. “You have been told,” he\r\nsays, “that the proposed plan was calculated peculiarly for the rich. In\r\nall governments, not merely despotic, the wealthy must, in most things,\r\nfind an advantage from the possession of that which is too much the end\r\nand aim of mankind. In the proposed plan there is nothing like a\r\ndiscrimination in their favor.... Is it a just cause of reproach that\r\nthe Constitution effectually secures property? Or would the objectors\r\nintroduce a general scramble?”[719]\r\n\r\nRecognizing the importance of the interests at stake, another Federalist\r\nwriter, “Civis,” in the Maryland Journal of February 1, 1788, appeals to\r\nthe voters for delegates to the coming state convention to be\r\ncircumspect in order to procure the ratification of the Constitution. He\r\nlaments that “men of property, character, and abilities have too much\r\nretired from public employment since the conclusion of the war,” but\r\nexpresses the hope “that, in this all important crisis, they will again\r\nstep forth, with a true patriotic ardour, and snatch their dear country\r\nfrom the dreadful and devouring jaws of anarchy and ruin.” He cautions\r\nthe citizens against voting for undesirable persons: “The characters\r\nwhom I would especially point out as your particular aversion, in the\r\npresent critical conjuncture, are all those in desperate or embarrassed\r\ncircumstances, who may have been advocates for paper money, the\r\ntruck-bill, or insolvent act; and who may expect to escape in the\r\ngeneral ruin of the country.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand many opponents of the Constitution in Maryland\r\ndefinitely declared the contest to be one between property and the\r\npeople of little substance. Such was practically the view of Luther\r\nMartin[720] in basing his resistance on the ground that the new system\r\nprevented the states from interfering with property rights. The spirit\r\nof this opposition was also well reflected in a reply to the letter of\r\n“Civis,” mentioned above, which took the form of an ironical appeal to\r\nthe voters to support only men of property and standing for the coming\r\nstate convention. “Choose no man in debt,” it runs, “because being in\r\ndebt proves that he wanted understanding to take care of his own\r\naffairs.... A man in debt can scarcely be honest.... Vote for no man who\r\nwas in favor of paper money, for no _honest_ man was for that measure.\r\nNone but _debtors_ and desperate wretches advocated the diabolical\r\nscheme.... Elect no man who supported the law allowing insolvent debtors\r\nto discharge their persons from perpetual imprisonment, by _honestly_\r\ndelivering up _all_ their property to the use of their creditors. The\r\nlegislature _have_ no right to interfere with _private_ contracts, and\r\ndebtors might safely trust to the humanity and clemency of their\r\ncreditors who will not keep them in gaol all their lives, unless they\r\ndeserve it.... Men of great property are deeply interested in the\r\nwelfare of the state; and they are the most competent judges of the form\r\nof government, best calculated to preserve their property, and such\r\nliberties as it is proper for the common and inferior class of people to\r\nenjoy. Men of wealth possess natural and acquired understanding, as they\r\nmanifest by amassing riches, or by keeping and increasing those they\r\nderive from their ancestors, and they are best acquainted with the\r\nwants, the wishes, and desires of the people, and they are always ready\r\nto relieve them in their private and public stations.”[721]\r\n\r\n_Virginia._—Madison remarked that he found in his state “men of\r\nintelligence, patriotism, property, and independent circumstances”[722]\r\ndivided over the ratification of the Constitution although in some other\r\ncommonwealths men of this stamp were “zealously attached” to the new\r\ngovernment. This general reflection is not borne out however by some of\r\nhis contemporaries. Marshall, as we have noted above,[723] regarded the\r\nconflict as being between two rather sharply divided parties, those who\r\nfavored maintaining public and private rights in their full integrity\r\nand those who proposed to attack them through legislation.[724] In fact,\r\nMadison himself at a later date declared that “the superiority of\r\nabilities” was on the side of the Constitution.[725] Charles Lee claimed\r\nthat “except a few characters, the members [of the Virginia convention]\r\nwith the most knowledge and abilities and personal influence are also in\r\nfavor of the Constitution.”[726]\r\n\r\nIn the opposition Patrick Henry put the whole mass of small farmers. “I\r\nbelieve it to be a fact,” he declared in the Virginia convention, “that\r\nthe great body of yeomanry are in decided opposition to it. I may say\r\nwith confidence that, for nineteen counties adjacent to each other,\r\nnine-tenths of the people are conscientiously opposed to it. I may be\r\nmistaken but I give you it as my opinion; and my opinion is founded on\r\npersonal knowledge in some measure, and other good authority.... You\r\nhave not solid reality—the hearts and hands of the men who are to be\r\ngoverned.”[727]\r\n\r\n_North Carolina._—It would have been strange if the leaders for and\r\nagainst the Constitution in this commonwealth had not taken cognizance\r\nof the nature of the conflict they were waging. The popular paper money\r\nand debtor party had been powerful and active and had aroused the\r\nsolicitude of all men of substance; and the representatives of the\r\nlatter, as practical men, knew what they were doing in supporting an\r\noverthrow of the old system. “It is essential to the interests of\r\nagriculture and commerce,” exclaimed Davie, in the state ratifying\r\nconvention, “that the hands of the states should be bound from making\r\npaper money, instalment laws, and pine barren acts. By such iniquitous\r\nlaws the merchant or farmer may be defrauded of a considerable part of\r\nhis just claims. But in the federal court, real money will be recovered\r\nwith that speed which is necessary to accommodate the circumstances of\r\nindividuals.”[728] Speaking on the same theme, paper money, Governor\r\nJohnston said: “Every man of property—every man of considerable\r\ntransactions, whether a merchant, planter, mechanic, or of any other\r\ncondition—must have felt the baneful influence of that currency.”[729]\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the nature of the clash of interests is manifest in\r\nscattered correspondence, as well as in speeches. For example, in a\r\nletter to Iredell, January 15, 1788, Maclaine says: “In New Hanover\r\ncounty the people if left to themselves are in favor of the change. Some\r\ndemagogues, a few persons who are in debt, and every public officer,\r\nexcept the clerk of the county court, are decidedly against any change;\r\nat least against any that will answer the purpose. Our friend Huske is\r\nthe loudest man in Wilmington against the new constitution. Whether\r\nambition, or avarice, or a compound of both actuates him I leave you to\r\njudge.... I expect in a few weeks _The Federalist_ in a volume. He is\r\ncertainly a judicious and ingenious writer, though not well calculated\r\nfor the common people.... Your old friend Huske and Col. Read have\r\njoined all the low scoundrels in the County [_i.e._ the country party]\r\nand by every underhand means are prejudicing the common people against\r\nthe new constitution. The former is a candidate for the county.”[730]\r\n\r\nThis conflict between the town and country is explained by Iredell’s\r\nbiographer: “Soon after the [Revolutionary] War commenced a feud between\r\nthe town of Wilmington and the county of New Hanover. The leading men\r\n‘upon ’Change’ were either Tories or those whose lukewarmness had\r\nprovoked suspicion: the agrestic population could but illy brook their\r\nprosperity. From that day to the present [1857] the politics of the\r\nburgess have been antagonistical to those of the former. The merchants\r\nhave ever been the predominant class in the borough: daily intercourse\r\nhas enabled them with facility to form combinations that have given them\r\nthe control of the moneyed institutions while their patronage has added\r\na potent influence with the press.”[731]\r\n\r\n_South Carolina._—The materials bearing on the ratification of the\r\nConstitution in South Carolina which are available to the northern\r\nstudent are relatively scanty.[732] Nevertheless, in view of the marked\r\nconflict between the agrarian back-country and the commercial seaboard,\r\nit may easily be imagined that it was not unobserved by the leaders in\r\nthe contest over ratification who championed the respective regions.\r\nThis antagonism came out in a pamphlet war over the amendment of the\r\nstate constitution which was being waged about the time of the adoption\r\nof the new federal system. In this war, “Appius,” the spokesman for the\r\nreform party is reported to have declared that “wealth ought not to be\r\nrepresented; that a rich citizen ought to have fewer votes than his poor\r\nneighbor; that wealth should be stripped of as many advantages as\r\npossible and it will then have more than enough; and finally, that in\r\ngiving property the power of protecting itself, government becomes an\r\naristocracy.”[733]\r\n\r\n“Appius,” after this general statement of his theory, then explains\r\nwherein the distribution of economic interests engendered antagonism in\r\npolitics in that state. “The upper and lower countries, have opposite\r\nhabits and views in almost every particular. One is accustomed to\r\nexpense, the other to frugality. One will be inclined to numerous\r\noffices, large salaries, and an expensive government; the other, from\r\nthe moderate fortunes of the inhabitants, and their simple way of life\r\nwill prefer low taxes, small salaries, and a very frugal civil\r\nestablishment. One imports almost every article of consumption and pays\r\nfor it in produce; the other is far removed from navigation, has very\r\nlittle to export, and must therefore supply its own wants. Consequently\r\none will favor commerce, the other manufactures; one wishes slaves, the\r\nother will be better without them.”[734] In view of this opposition of\r\ninterests, “Appius” holds that there should be a redistribution of\r\nrepresentatives which will give the back-country its proper proportion\r\nand enable the majority to rule.\r\n\r\nTo this argument Ford replies in the language of Federalism. The rights\r\nof property are anterior to constitutions; the state constitution\r\nrecognizes and guarantees these rights; the substantial interests of the\r\nminority must be forever immune from attacks by majorities. Otherwise\r\n“the weaker party in society,” he declares, “would literally have no\r\nright whatever: neither life, liberty, or property would be guaranteed\r\nto them by the social compact, seeing the majority are not bound by it,\r\nbut might destroy the whole and by the same rule any part of it at\r\npleasure.... Virtue and vice would lose their distinction; the most\r\nvicious views would be sanctified if pursued by the greater number, and\r\nthe most virtuous resistance punishable in the less. If the principles\r\nof justice are derived from a higher source than human institutions (and\r\nwho will deny it?) I contend that the majority have no right to infringe\r\nthem.”[735] Hence, any change in the system which deprives the seaboard\r\nminority of their preponderance in the state government cannot be too\r\nseverely reprobated.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that an economic antagonism in the state that\r\nwas so clearly recognized by publicists in 1794, and that manifested\r\nitself in the vote on the ratification of the Federal Constitution six\r\nyears before, was overlooked in the earlier contest.\r\n\r\nIndeed, evidence that it was not appears in a pamphlet written in\r\ndefence of the Constitution by Dr. David Ramsay, who was afterward a\r\nmember of the ratifying convention in South Carolina. He particularly\r\nwarns his fellow-citizens against the debtor element. “Be on your\r\nguard,” he says, “against the misrepresentations of men who are involved\r\nin debt; such may wish to see the Constitution rejected because of the\r\nfollowing clause, ‘no state shall emit bills of credit, make anything\r\nbut gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, pass any ex post\r\nfacto law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts.’ This will\r\ndoubtless bear hard on debtors who wish to defraud their creditors, but\r\nit will be real service to the honest part of the community. Examine\r\nwell the characters and circumstances of men who are averse to the new\r\nconstitution. Perhaps you will find that the above clause is the real\r\nground of the opposition of some of them, though they may artfully cover\r\nit with a splendid profession of zeal for state privileges and general\r\nliberty.”[736]\r\n\r\n_Georgia._—The speedy and unanimous ratification of the Constitution in\r\nGeorgia seems to have prevented any very vigorous pamphleteering on the\r\nquestion. Indeed, the energies of the state were being strained to the\r\nlimit in preparing for defence against the Indians, and there was little\r\ntime for theorizing. Foreign invasion generally silences domestic\r\ndiscord.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\nAt the close of this long and arid survey—partaking of the nature of\r\ncatalogue—it seems worth while to bring together the important\r\nconclusions for political science which the data presented appear to\r\nwarrant.\r\n\r\nThe movement for the Constitution of the United States was originated\r\nand carried through principally by four groups of personalty interests\r\nwhich had been adversely affected under the Articles of Confederation:\r\nmoney, public securities, manufactures, and trade and shipping.\r\n\r\nThe first firm steps toward the formation of the Constitution were taken\r\nby a small and active group of men immediately interested through their\r\npersonal possessions in the outcome of their labors.\r\n\r\nNo popular vote was taken directly or indirectly on the proposition to\r\ncall the Convention which drafted the Constitution.\r\n\r\nA large propertyless mass was, under the prevailing suffrage\r\nqualifications, excluded at the outset from participation (through\r\nrepresentatives) in the work of framing the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Philadelphia Convention which drafted the\r\nConstitution were, with a few exceptions, immediately, directly, and\r\npersonally interested in, and derived economic advantages from, the\r\nestablishment of the new system.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was essentially an economic document based upon the\r\nconcept that the fundamental private rights of property are anterior to\r\ngovernment and morally beyond the reach of popular majorities.\r\n\r\nThe major portion of the members of the Convention are on record as\r\nrecognizing the claim of property to a special and defensive position in\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn the ratification of the Constitution, about three-fourths of the\r\nadult males failed to vote on the question, having abstained from the\r\nelections at which delegates to the state conventions were chosen,\r\neither on account of their indifference or their disfranchisement by\r\nproperty qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was ratified by a vote of probably not more than\r\none-sixth of the adult males.\r\n\r\nIt is questionable whether a majority of the voters participating in the\r\nelections for the state conventions in New York, Massachusetts, New\r\nHampshire, Virginia, and South Carolina, actually approved the\r\nratification of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe leaders who supported the Constitution in the ratifying conventions\r\nrepresented the same economic groups as the members of the Philadelphia\r\nConvention; and in a large number of instances they were also directly\r\nand personally interested in the outcome of their efforts.\r\n\r\nIn the ratification, it became manifest that the line of cleavage for\r\nand against the Constitution was between substantial personalty\r\ninterests on the one hand and the small farming and debtor interests on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was not created by “the whole people” as the jurists\r\nhave said;

See the introduction to Vinogradoff,\r\n  _Villainage in England_. W. J. Ashley, in his preface to the\r\n  translation of Fustel de Coulanges, _Origin of Property in Land_,\r\n  throws some light on the problem, but does not attempt a systematic\r\n  study.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Note the painstaking documentation for the first chapters in Stubbs’\r\n  great work.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  What Morley has said of Macaulay is true of many eminent American\r\n  historical writers: “A popular author must, in a thoroughgoing way,\r\n  take the accepted maxims for granted. He must suppress any whimsical\r\n  fancy for applying the Socratic elenchus; or any other engine of\r\n  criticism, scepticism, or verification to those sentiments or current\r\n  precepts or morals which may in truth be very equivocal and may be\r\n  much neglected in practice, but which the public opinion of his time\r\n  requires to be treated in theory and in literature as if they had been\r\n  cherished and held _semper, ubique, et ab omnibus_.” _Miscellanies_,\r\n  Vol. I, p. 272.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  For instance, intimate connections can be shown between the vogue of\r\n  Darwinism and the competitive ideals of the mid-Victorian middle-class\r\n  in England. Darwin got one of his leading ideas, the struggle for\r\n  existence, from Malthus, who originated it as a club to destroy the\r\n  social reformers, Godwin, Condorcet, and others, and then gave it a\r\n  serious scientific guise as an afterthought.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  See also the valuable and suggestive writings on American history by\r\n  Professor W. E. Dodd, of Chicago University; W. A. Schaper,\r\n  “Sectionalism in South Carolina,” _American Historical Association\r\n  Report_ (1900), Vol. I; A. Bentley, _The Process of Government_; C. H.\r\n  Ambler, _Sectionalism in Virginia_. There are three works by socialist\r\n  writers that deserve study: Simons, _Social Forces in American\r\n  History_; Gustavus Myers, _History of Great American Fortunes and\r\n  History of the Supreme Court_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  See Seligman, _The Economic Interpretation of History_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Vincent, in his treatise on _Historical Research_ (1911), dismisses\r\n  the economic theory without critical examination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  The _Congressional Record_ requires more care in use than any other\r\n  great source of information on American politics.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Attention should be drawn, however, to the good work which is being\r\n  done in the translation of several European legal studies, the “Modern\r\n  Legal Philosophy Series,” under the editorial direction of the\r\n  Association of American Law Schools. Perhaps the most hopeful sign of\r\n  the times is the growth of interest in comparative jurisprudence. See\r\n  Borchard, “Jurisprudence in Germany,” Columbia Law Review, April,\r\n  1912.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  For examples of Maitland’s suggestiveness, see the English Historical\r\n  Review, Vol. IX, p. 439, for a side light on the effect of money\r\n  economy on the manor and consequently on feudal law. See also the\r\n  closing pages of his _Constitutional History of England_, where he\r\n  makes constitutional law in large part the history of the law of real\r\n  property. “If we are to learn anything about the constitution, it is\r\n  necessary first and foremost that we should learn a good deal about\r\n  the land law. We can make no progress whatever in the history of\r\n  parliament without speaking of tenure; indeed our whole constitutional\r\n  law seems at times to be but an appendix to the law of real property”\r\n  (p. 538). Maitland’s entire marvellous chapter on “The Definition of\r\n  Constitutional Law” deserves the most careful study and reflection.

Der\r\n  letzte Band desselben ... schloss ab mit einer Grundlegung der Theorie\r\n  der Rechte im subjektiven Sinn, in der ich eine von der herrschenden\r\n  abweichende Begriffsbestimmung des Rechts im subjektiven Sinn gab,\r\n  indem ich an Stelle des Willens, auf den jene den Begriff desselben\r\n  gründete, das Interesse setze. Dem folgenden Bande war die weitere\r\n  Rechtfertigung und Verwertung dieses Gesichtspunktes Vorbehalten....\r\n  Der Begriff des Interesses nötigte mich, den Zweck ins Auge zu fassen,\r\n  und das Recht im subjektiven Sinn drängte mich zu dem im objektiven\r\n  Sinn, und so gestaltete sich das ursprüngliche Untersuchungsobjekt zu\r\n  einem ungleich erweiterten, zu dem des gegenwärtigen Buches: der Zweck\r\n  im Recht.... Der Grundgedanke des gegenwärtigen Werkes besteht darin,\r\n  dass der Zweck der Schöpfer des gesamten Rechts ist, dass es keinen\r\n  Rechtssatz gibt, der nicht einem Zweck, d.i. einem praktischen Motiv\r\n  seinen Ursprung verdankt.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Was ist es, das den innersten Grund unserer politischen und socialen\r\n  Kämpfe bildet? Der Begriff des erworbenen Rechts ist wieder einmal\r\n  streitig geworden—und dieser Streit ist es, der das Herz der heutigen\r\n  Welt durchzittert und die tief inwendigste Grundlage der\r\n  politisch-socialen Kämpfe des Jahrhunderts bildet. Im Juristischen,\r\n  Politischen, Oekonomischen ist der Begriff des erworbenen Rechts der\r\n  treibende Springquell aller weitern Gestaltung, und wo sich das\r\n  Juristische als das Privatrechtliche völlig von dem Politischen\r\n  abzulösen scheint, da ist es noch viel politischer als das Politische\r\n  selbst, dann da ist es das sociale Element.

Since human life, however, is the life of man\r\n  in society, individual existence moves within the framework of the\r\n  social structure and is modified by it. What the conditions of\r\n  maintenance are to the individual, the similar relations of production\r\n  and consumption are to the community. To economic causes, therefore,\r\n  must be traced in the last instance those transformations in the\r\n  structure of society which themselves condition the relations of\r\n  social classes and the various manifestations of social life.” _The\r\n  Economic Interpretation of History_, p. 3.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  The question of geographic distribution will be considered below,\r\n  Chap.

There is plenty of evidence for the\r\n  statement that many of the members did possess public paper _before_\r\n  the meeting of the Convention, but the incompleteness of the old\r\n  records prevents the fixing of the exact number.

Toward\r\n  the close of the Convention, “Gerry,” says Ellsworth, “introduced a\r\n  motion respecting the redemption of the old continental money—that it\r\n  should be placed on a footing with other liquidated securities of the\r\n  United States. As Mr. Gerry was supposed to be possessed of large\r\n  quantities of this species of paper, his motion appeared to be founded\r\n  in such bare-faced selfishness and injustice, that it at once\r\n  accounted for all his former plausibility and concession, while the\r\n  rejection of it by the convention inspired its author with the utmost\r\n  rage and intemperate opposition to the whole system he had formerly\r\n  praised.” Ford, _Essays on the Constitution_, p. 174. Gerry\r\n  indignantly denied that he ever made such a motion in the Convention,\r\n  or that he held much continental money. _Ibid._, p. 127. It does not\r\n  appear in Farrand, _Records_, that any such motion was made in the\r\n  Convention; and under the circumstances it seems not unjust to remark\r\n  that Ellsworth’s charges were made with very bad grace, particularly\r\n  in view of the fact that he and members of his family and intimate\r\n  friends held considerable amounts of public securities. “Bare-faced\r\n  selfishness” was not monopolized by Gerry in the Convention.\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  See above, p. 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  King, _Life and Correspondence_, Vol. I, p. 72.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  A.

The extensive commercial\r\n  business of Charleston at that time opened a wide field of litigation.\r\n  Our courts were constantly employed in heavy insurance cases—in\r\n  questions of charter party, foreign and inland bills of exchange, and\r\n  in adjusting foreign claims.

In our Governments the real power lies in the majority of\r\n  the Community, and the invasion of private rights is _chiefly_ to be\r\n  apprehended, not from acts of Government contrary to the sense of its\r\n  constituents, but from acts in which the Government is the mere\r\n  instrument of the major number of the constituents. This is a truth of\r\n  great importance, but not yet sufficiently attended to, and is\r\n  probably more strongly impressed upon my mind by facts, and\r\n  reflections suggested by them, than on yours which has contemplated\r\n  abuses of power issuing from a very different quarter. Wherever there\r\n  is an interest and power to do wrong, wrong will generally be done,\r\n  and not less readily by a powerful and interested party than by a\r\n  powerful and interested prince.” _Documentary History of the\r\n  Constitution_, Vol. V, p. 88.\r\n\r\nFootnote 391:\r\n\r\n  _The Federalist_, No. 48.\r\n\r\nFootnote 392:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, No. 49.\r\n\r\nFootnote 393:\r\n\r\n  _The Federalist_, No. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, No. 51.\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._, No. 60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 396:\r\n\r\n  Beard, _The Supreme Court and the Constitution_.

Radical action\r\n  on the part of the national legislature was anticipated in the\r\n  structure of the government itself, but specific provision had to be\r\n  made against the assaults of popular majorities in state legislatures\r\n  on property rights.\r\n\r\nFootnote 423:\r\n\r\n  _Writings of James Madison_ (1865), Vol. I, p. 350.

Continental loan office certificates\r\n  and all such securities have risen twenty-five per cent. Even the old\r\n  emission which has long lain dormant begins to show its head. Last\r\n  week many thousand pounds’ worth of it were bought up. Moneyed men\r\n  have their agents employed to buy up all the continental securities\r\n  they can—foreseeing the rapid rise of our funds. Such men as have the\r\n  cash to spare will certainly make large fortunes.... We send our\r\n  factors to the distant towns who know nothing of the rise and buy them\r\n  cheap; for there is no buying them on reasonable terms in\r\n  Philadelphia, as the wealthy men are purchasing them to lay up.
