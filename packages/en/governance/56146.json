Every effort has been\r\nmade to deal with the headings selected as comprehensively and as\r\nsimply as possible, and it is hoped that, in this convenient form,\r\nthe handbook will be welcomed by those who wish to follow the\r\ncampaign with understanding. The various articles reprinted were\r\nwritten during the winter of the present year (1914-15), and many of\r\nthe conclusions reached apply, therefore, to that period of the war\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Page_ 38, _line_ 17,  400 _should read_ 500.\r\n          „          „  5000    „     „   4000.\r\n  _Page_ 42, Description of Map, _line_ 3, 400 _should read_ 500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO MAPS OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wherein the map of Europe, as it will be if Germany wins, is clearly\r\ndefined and compared with the map of Europe re-arranged in accordance\r\nwith the ideals of the Allies._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO MAPS OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is everywhere admitted that the result of the great war must be\r\neither, upon the whole, to produce a new map of Europe upon the\r\nGerman model, or a new map of Europe upon the model suitable to the\r\nideas of the Allies.\r\n\r\nBy this it is not meant that either ideal will be completely\r\nreached, but that in the settlement one or the other will certainly\r\npreponderate. Indeed, it is in the struggle between these two new\r\nmaps of Europe as ideals that the motive of the war consists.\r\n\r\nNow, before attempting to determine in a graphic fashion what those\r\ntwo ideals are--before, that is, trying to draw two maps which shall\r\nrepresent respectively the German goal and the goal of the Allies, we\r\nmust lay down certain postulates which are not always recognized but\r\nwhich are certainly true.\r\n\r\nUnless we recognize their truth we shall come to accept wild\r\nstatements, and to be frightened of those ridiculous prophecies which\r\npropose the extermination of Germany on the one hand, or the rule of\r\nthe German government over England or France on the other.\r\n\r\nI. The first of these postulates is that a modern European nation no\r\nlonger desires to _annex_ white men in Europe, and the territory they\r\ninhabit.\r\n\r\nThe example of Alsace-Lorraine alone has proved a sufficient\r\nlesson; the continued vitality of Poland after a hundred years has\r\nproved another, and even the difficulties of the Austro-Hungarian\r\ngovernments, with their subject races, a third. This does not\r\nmean that a modern European government would not annex in any\r\ncircumstance. The possession of some all-important military or\r\ncommercial point might occasionally make the perilous experiment\r\nworth while. But it means that the idea of annexation as an obvious\r\ncorollary to military success has disappeared.\r\n\r\nII. The second postulate is as follows: It is universally\r\nrecognized--by the Germans quite as much as by ourselves--that the\r\npolitical boundaries so long established in Europe hardly ever\r\ncorrespond to exact national groupings, and very often violently\r\nconflict with the realities of national life.\r\n\r\nNo one is so foolish, for instance, as to pretend that the Finnish\r\nprovinces of Russia are not quite separate from the rest of the\r\nCzar’s dominions in tradition, and consciousness, and habit, and\r\nall the rest that makes a nation. No one in England now denies the\r\nexistence of an Irish nationality.\r\n\r\nNo one, to take an Eastern case, would pretend that the Serbian\r\nfeeling of nationality was not very real, and was very far from being\r\ncontained by the present boundaries of Serbia.\r\n\r\nThe excuse for the old point of view--the point of view that\r\npolitical boundaries were sufficient and that the true nationalities\r\nwhich they cut through or suppressed might be neglected--was that\r\nin time, with the modern rapidity of communication and the power of\r\nthe modern State, these divergent elements would be _absorbed_, or\r\n_digested into_, the greater nationality which governed them. But\r\nexperience has falsified this very reasonable conception. It has\r\nbeen found not only that this transformation did not take place, but\r\neven that the old real nationalities were actually getting stronger.\r\nPoland, for instance, artificially cut through by the German,\r\nAustrian, and Russian frontiers, did seem for a time as though it\r\nwere going to spring into a Russian, a German, and an Austrian\r\ntype of Polish men; and in the latter case, that of Austria, some\r\nconsiderable advance was made towards such a result. But generations\r\npassed, and the process did not continue; on the contrary, the tide\r\nbegan to set backwards, and the conception of a united Poland is far\r\nstronger to-day even in the small and successful Austrian portion of\r\nPoland than it was thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these two postulates, the true national groupings\r\nhave discovered their power and have already begun to appear in real\r\nform, as it were, through the artificial political boundaries which\r\ndivided or suppressed them. Any one, the Germans as much as the rest,\r\nproposing to reconstruct Europe must most certainly take account of\r\nsuch realities, and must deal with the many national groups of Europe\r\nas the stones out of which the new building is to be erected.\r\n\r\nBut the particular way in which those stones may be used, the\r\ncombinations into which they may be grouped, the main influences\r\nwhich are to impose themselves upon particular great agglomerations\r\nof new nationalities are the whole issue of the debate, and form the\r\nwhole subject of this war.\r\n\r\nThe German Empire and its Ally, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy--that\r\nis, the reigning house of Hapsburg-Lorraine--wants the re-arrangement\r\nto take a certain form which would leave the German speech and\r\nculture and tradition the predominating thing in Europe, and probably\r\nin the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe Allies, upon the other hand, are fighting for a less simple idea.\r\nThey are fighting for the double conception of:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Retaining the existing independence of certain\r\n  national groups.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Erecting other independent or partly independent\r\n  groups, the existence of which and the general influence\r\n  of which shall restrict German and in particular Prussian\r\n  power.\r\n\r\nThis dual conception the Allies rightly term the preservation and the\r\nextension of national liberties in Europe.\r\n\r\nNow before we can comprehend either what the Germans are striving\r\nfor or what the Allies are striving for, we must make a catalogue\r\nof those national groups which are at the foundation of the whole\r\nbusiness. In making that catalogue we must remember what it is that\r\ncreates a national group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP I. THE MAIN TRUE NATIONAL FRONTIERS OF CONTINENTAL\r\nEUROPE\r\n\r\n(excluding the South, which is exterior to this war)\r\n\r\n  The Slavs Roman in Religion.      True National Frontiers.\r\n\r\n1, 2, 3, 4.--Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nNational groupings have discovered their power and have already begun\r\nto appear in real form through the artificial political boundaries\r\nwhich divided or suppressed them. Anyone proposing to reconstruct\r\nEurope must most certainly take account of such realities, and must\r\ndeal with the many national groups of Europe as the stones out of\r\nwhich the new building is to be erected.]\r\n\r\nWhat makes a nation is _corporate tradition_. The strongest element\r\nin this is an historic memory. A nation which can point to having\r\nenjoyed a national existence in the past is much more firmly seated\r\nin its ambition to retain or to recover its independence than one\r\nwhich has never had such historic existence.\r\n\r\nAnother element in this constitution of a nationality is language.\r\nA common language is a much weaker element of nationality than\r\ntradition, as we see in the case of Belgium, which is almost equally\r\ndivided between Latin-speaking and Teutonic-speaking people; and\r\nin the case of Switzerland. But it is none the less a strong thing;\r\nnowhere is it stronger than in the case of Poland. While, upon the\r\nother hand, you have exactly the opposite in the case of Irish\r\nnational feeling; in the case of German-speaking Lorraine and Alsace;\r\nand you might very well have had a similar case in Bohemia where\r\nthere is now a strong national feeling backed by a national Slav\r\nlanguage, though that language was artificially revived comparatively\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\nYet another factor is religion, and it is a most powerful one. It\r\ncreates, for instance, a gulf between the Catholic and the Orthodox\r\nSlav, and it creates an awkward complexity in the problem of those\r\nSlavs whose religious ritual is Greek, but who are yet in communion\r\nwith Rome.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to attribute numerical value to each of these\r\nvarious factors, or to say that language everywhere counts for so\r\nmuch, religion for so much, etc. We have to take each particular\r\ncase and judge it as it stands. And if we do that with an impartial\r\njudgment upon the real national feeling, we get some such list as the\r\nfollowing, for the Continent alone.\r\n\r\n(1) The French, who within their own boundaries are perfectly united;\r\nalthough certain districts (a little group in the Pyrenees and\r\nanother little group in Western Brittany and another in the extreme\r\nnorth-east) speak a language of their own. To this French group\r\nshould be added the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine which were\r\nannexed by the Germans in 1871. Alsace and Lorraine have enjoyed\r\ngreat material prosperity under German rule; the metal industry of\r\nthe North has been immensely developed, and in a dozen other ways\r\nthe German administration has increased their wealth, and has added\r\nto their population serious elements of German sympathy. But take the\r\nprovinces as a whole and there is no doubt that their re-union with\r\nFrance is still the passionate desire of the great majority among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n(2) Belgium is again undoubtedly the example of a separate--though\r\nless united--national group in whose individual feeling religion\r\nplays a great part, but still more historic existence through nearly\r\na century as an independent State (during which century Belgium has\r\nvastly increased its population and its wealth), and for much more\r\nthan a century the separate existence of the district as the Southern\r\nNetherlands as distinct from Holland.\r\n\r\n(3) Holland, in its turn, both on account of its long independent\r\nexistence, its strong national feeling and its peculiar experience\r\nas a commercial seafaring power, makes a third individual group. The\r\npopulations immediately to the east of Holland in German territory\r\nspeak a language of the same sort as the Dutch, and have the same\r\nsocial conditions and habits, but they have no desire to be Dutch,\r\nnor the Dutch to be incorporated with them.\r\n\r\n(4) The Scandinavian countries, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, form\r\nan equally distinct unit, and are quite clearly divided into three\r\nseparate national groups. And here we have two anomalies: A quite\r\nsmall belt of Denmark, much smaller than the total original extent\r\nof Schleswig-Holstein, annexed by Prussia fifty years ago, is really\r\nDanish, and maintains to this day its protest against the annexation.\r\nOne may go so far as to say that this really Danish belt is no more\r\nthan a tenth of the whole, but its protest is a proof of the vigour\r\nwhich national feeling has maintained against artificial political\r\nboundaries. On the other hand, the Finnish provinces of Russia are,\r\nin their articulate spirit, their governing class, their religion,\r\nand almost in their entire social life Swedish in tone. Norway is\r\nintact, neither suffering a portion of her population under alien\r\nrule nor pretending to govern populations alien to herself.\r\n\r\n(5) The fifth great group is the German, and here there is so much\r\ncomplexity that what we have to say must only be taken very generally\r\nand roughly. But, roughly and generally, the German group is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nAll German-speaking men and women with the exception of:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) The bulk of the annexed provinces of Alsace-Lorraine\r\n  (a matter of sentiment), and\r\n\r\n  (_b_) The German-speaking cantons of Switzerland (a matter\r\n  of political boundaries).\r\n\r\nNow the boundaries of this “German feeling” group in Europe are\r\ncuriously involved and tortuous. Beginning at the Baltic, roughly at\r\nthe mouth of the River Niemen (which the Germans call the Memel),\r\nthe true frontier of the German type runs southward for a short\r\ndistance until it reaches what is called the Region of the Lakes,\r\nwhere the Russian frontier begins to turn west. There the boundary\r\nturns west also, and begins to run north again, nearly reaching the\r\nBaltic Sea in the neighbourhood of Dantzig. It then turns south by\r\nwest, goes far west of Thorn and even of Posen, which are Polish\r\ntowns, and comes round not far east of Frankfort-on-Oder. Then it\r\ngoes south and east again, coming right through the middle of German\r\nSilesia, but, on reaching the mountains that here bound Bohemia, it\r\ncurls round northwestward again, leaving the mountainous part of\r\nthe barrier of Bohemia all German, but excluding the Slavonic true\r\nBohemian people in the centre of that isolated region. The Upper\r\nValley of the Elbe is not German. Having thus gone all the way round\r\nBohemia proper, the boundaries of the German type run eastward\r\nagain, very nearly following the watershed of the Danube until they\r\nstrike the March River about thirty miles from Vienna. Vienna is\r\nthus not a centre, but, like Berlin, an outpost of German speech and\r\ncivilization. From Vienna the true frontier of the German folk runs\r\nsouth, more or less corresponding to the existing boundary between\r\nAustria and Hungary, until it passes the point of Gratz--which counts\r\nas German. Thence the boundary turns due west again, taking in the\r\ngreater part of the Tyrol, and so to the Swiss frontier and on to the\r\nRhine opposite Belfort. Thence it follows the Rhine to a point south\r\nof Spiers, and after that follows the existing boundaries (excepting\r\nLuxembourg), and is confined by the Dutch and Belgian frontier and\r\nthe North and Baltic Seas with the exception of the Danish belt north\r\nof the Kiel Canal, which is mainly Danish.\r\n\r\nWithin that curiously twisted line nearly all speech and all\r\nfeeling is German. There are many States within that line, there\r\nis much confusion of historic tradition, a sharp division in\r\nreligion--roughly Catholic in the south and west, Protestant in the\r\nnorth and east. But the national group is, especially as against\r\nthe Slav and even as against western and southern Europe, one body;\r\nand within that body Prussia, with its capital of Berlin, is the\r\norganizing and directing centre.\r\n\r\nAre there anomalies to be discovered with regard to this curiously\r\nshaped body? There are; but they are of less importance than is\r\noften imagined. Thus there are beyond Eastern Prussia and within the\r\nRussian boundary the so-called “German” Baltic provinces of Russia.\r\nBut the term is a misnomer. The leaders of industry are largely\r\nGerman, most of the towns, and the greater landed aristocracy for the\r\nmost part. But the mass of the population is not German-speaking, and\r\neven of the German-speaking minority only a minority again are in any\r\nsympathy with the united German feeling to the west.\r\n\r\nThere are colonies of German speech far eastward of Vienna under\r\nthe political dominion of Hungary; a particularly large one being\r\ndiscoverable right up in the south-eastern Carpathians next to the\r\nRoumanian border. But these colonies could never be included in any\r\nunited Germany. Nor could the considerable number of similar isolated\r\ncolonies of Germans in southern and western Russia. Finally, you\r\nhave on the extreme west the little province of Luxembourg, which is\r\nGerman-speaking, which has its railways and most of its industries\r\ncontrolled by Germans, but which would in any perfectly free system\r\ncertainly refuse incorporation with any new German unity, for it has\r\nan historic tradition of independence which has proved very valuable\r\nto it, and may be compared with that of the Swiss German-speaking\r\ncantons.\r\n\r\n(6) We next have to consider the Slavs, and these fall into two\r\ngroups, northern and southern, which two groups are thus separated\r\nby the great Mongolian invasion of Eastern Europe in the Dark Ages.\r\nThere is further among the Slavs a cross-section of great importance,\r\nthat of religion. It separates the Slavs not into northern and\r\nsouthern, but, roughly, into eastern or Greek church, and western or\r\nCatholic. With the northern Slavs we count the Bohemians or Czechs,\r\nthe Poles, and the Russians--using the latter term, of course, for\r\nmany distinct but connected groups, for it is certain that Russia\r\nproper must remain a unity.\r\n\r\nThere are also just north of the Carpathians two minor northern\r\nSlavonic groups, the Slovacs and the Ruthenians. These northern Slavs\r\nare divided into Catholic Slavs and Slavs of the Greek Church, or\r\nOrthodox, by a vague belt of territory running, roughly, from the\r\ntown of Vilna down to the borders of the Bukovina; the Poles and\r\nCzechs, etc., being in communion with Rome, while the Russians are of\r\nthe Greek Church.\r\n\r\nThe southern Slavs are again divided into Catholic and Orthodox by a\r\nvery sharp and bitter division. The Slovenes and the Croats stand for\r\nthe Catholic group, the Serbian nation, as a whole, for the Orthodox\r\ngroup; a part of the Serbians and all the Slovenes and Croats are in\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian dominions, and it is the Serbian element which\r\nis in rebellion. The rest of the Serbians are now independent. And so\r\ncomplicated are population and religion in this region that nearly a\r\nthird of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Slav in race, are Mohammedan\r\nin religion.\r\n\r\n(7) Between these two great Slav groups, northern and southern,\r\nstruck in, during the Dark Ages, a wedge of invading Mongols whose\r\nposition has been of the greatest importance to the history of\r\nEastern Europe. They were converted to Christianity nearly a thousand\r\nyears ago, and the Mongol type has entirely disappeared, but the\r\nMongol language remains under the title of _Magyar_, and it is the\r\n_Magyar_-speaking _Hungarians_ that are the ruling race over all the\r\neastern part of Austria-Hungary, though they are only half of the\r\ntotal population in their dominion. In any new national grouping this\r\nfiercely independent Magyar population must be taken for granted,\r\nthough its claim to rule alien subjects is another matter.\r\n\r\n(8) Finally, there is a curious group of the greatest importance,\r\nboth because so much of its population is forbidden independence and\r\nbecause the remainder has attained independence. That group is the\r\nRoumanian group.\r\n\r\nRacially, the Roumanians are probably Slavs for the most part, but\r\ntheir tongue is a Latin tongue; they are proud of Latin descent,\r\nand they are just as much a wedge between the Slavs of the north\r\nand south as the Magyars themselves. They everywhere overlap their\r\nnominal political boundaries; three million and a half of them extend\r\nfar into Hungary, and a portion over the boundaries of Russia. For\r\nthe most part they are Orthodox, or Greek, in religion. But it must\r\nalways be remembered, because it is essential to understanding the\r\nnew Europe, that the Roumanian-speaking people under Hungarian rule\r\nare, quite half of them and perhaps the majority, cut off from the\r\nOrthodox Church and in union with Rome.\r\n\r\nWith this summary, which has been expressed in Map I, you have a\r\nfair, though of course rough, division of Europe into its real\r\nnational components.\r\n\r\nNow let us ask what Germany and Austria would propose, in case of\r\ntheir victory, to make out of such materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP II.

Turkey\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the “German feeling” group in Europe are very\r\nroughly suggested by the thick black line. Within that curiously\r\ntwisted line nearly all speech and all feeling is German.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place Germany would keep all that she has, indifferent\r\nto national anomalies or the unquiet of subject and oppressed\r\npeoples. She would keep Alsace-Lorraine; she would keep in subjection\r\nthe Poles who are already in subjection to her; she would leave the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Monarchy under the Hapsburgs with all its present\r\npossessions, whether those possessions grossly interfered with\r\nnational realities or no. Would she annex territory, in spite of the\r\nfirst of the two postulates which I have already mentioned?\r\n\r\nThe German constitutional system is of its nature federal. There is\r\nroom in it for many kinds of states, each possessed of a very great\r\nmeasure of independence, and if the inclusion within one commercial\r\nsystem and one military system also, however loose that inclusion, be\r\ncalled annexation, then we may say that Germany would annex in some\r\ndegree. She would wish to control directly the Mouth of the Scheldt\r\nand probably the Teutonic-speaking part of Belgium, that is, the\r\nnorth of that country. She would certainly desire to administrate the\r\nArdennes, which would be her frontier against France, and she would\r\nquite certainly take over Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nAs to Holland, her plan would probably be different there from that\r\npursued in any other case. She would leave it as independent in its\r\nown eyes as it was before; she might insist upon an alliance with\r\nthe Dutch army, she would certainly insist upon commercial terms,\r\nand probably rights of using certain ports in certain cases for war.\r\nBut nothing but inexcusable folly would tempt her to go further. The\r\nposition of Holland after a German settlement might not uncertainly\r\nbe compared to the position of Hamburg in the old days, on a larger\r\nscale, a free State just as Hamburg was a free city.\r\n\r\nThis easy and, as it were, mutually arranged compromise with Holland,\r\ncoupled with dominion over the Scheldt and Antwerp, would give the\r\nGerman peoples what they most desire, the whole littoral of the North\r\nSea. Further, possessing Antwerp, as they would certainly possess\r\nit, they would have a commercial lever for keeping Holland in order.\r\nThey could direct all their trade at will towards Antwerp to the\r\nstarvation of Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nThe Scandinavian countries they would regard as naturally German\r\nin feeling, and as falling in a vague and general way into their\r\norbit. Possessing the Kiel Canal, they would not strictly need the\r\nSound. But they would so dominate Denmark that they could make what\r\ncommercial or military terms they chose with regard to the passages\r\nof the Baltic; and you would have German firms, German methods,\r\nand to some extent the German language holding “civil garrisons”\r\nthroughout the useful part of Sweden and Norway.\r\n\r\nOn the East some have imagined they would erect as against Russia\r\na mutilated and dependent Polish State. It is more probable that\r\nthey would confine themselves to procuring some liberty for Russian\r\nPoland, and obtaining some convention as to fortification and\r\ncommerce. Russia will always be formidable, and to maintain the\r\nmutual bond of a subject Poland between Russia and herself would\r\nserve in the future, as it has served in the past, the ends of\r\nPrussia. It is essential to Prussia that no really independent Poland\r\nshould re-arise, even mutilated. It is even essential that there\r\nshould be no one area that the Poles could regard as the nucleus of a\r\nreally free Polish State.\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans the Germanic Powers would certainly demand the control\r\nover what is now Serbia, and, at the risk of further war, the outlet\r\nat Salonika. The remnant of the Turkish Empire in Europe they already\r\nregard as being under their protectorate.\r\n\r\nAs to the West, they would, rightly, treat it merely as a defeated\r\nfoe. France (they would say) might continue to decline--for the\r\nGermans, getting things out of Berlin, always talk of “the decay of\r\nthe Latin peoples”--her decline accelerated by stringent commercial\r\ntreaties and a heavy indemnity; England would be envisaged in the\r\nsame terms. Germany would demand from England certain coaling\r\nstations; she would impose on England also certain commercial\r\nconditions. But there would be no need to restrict the building of a\r\nFleet, for there a victorious Germany would feel easily able to look\r\nafter herself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP III.

Poland: Quasi-independent, but a holding of Russia.\r\n\r\n5. Czechs: Quasi-independent, but probably still a holding of Vienna.\r\n\r\n6. Ruthenians (a minor Slavonic group): either annexed to Russia, or\r\nclosely dependent on her.\r\n\r\n7. An independent Magyar State.\r\n\r\n8. An independent Catholic Southern Slav or Croat State, probably a\r\nholding of Vienna.\r\n\r\n9. An orthodox Southern Slav State, Serbia, with access to Adriatic,\r\nbut not holding Bulgarian territory.\r\n\r\n10. Roumania, enlarged by her Transylvanian population.\r\n\r\n11. Bulgaria.]\r\n\r\nIf this is the German programme, what is that of the Allies?\r\n\r\nPrimarily, it is the maintenance of not only liberties, but powers\r\nalready acquired. In the economic sphere it is, of course, the\r\nmaintenance of those international contracts upon which the wealth of\r\nEngland and of France depends. It is the maintenance of English power\r\nat sea, the re-establishment of a united France by land, the recovery\r\nof Belgium, and the guaranteeing of Holland in her neutrality,\r\nwhether she wills it or no.\r\n\r\nBut over and beyond this there is the problem of reconstruction, and\r\nhere you have two clear principles:\r\n\r\n(1) It is to the advantage of the Allies to recognize everywhere, as\r\nmuch as possible, the realities of nationality.\r\n\r\n(2) It is a matter of life and death to the Allies to prevent the\r\nre-establishment of Prussian power, with its ideal of domination over\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nTo some extent these two policies agree, but not entirely. To erect\r\na larger Serbia, to free the Croats and the Slovenes, or perhaps\r\nto take from their territory the ports necessary to Serbia on the\r\nAdriatic, giving Serbia also the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\r\nmeanwhile, to let Bulgaria occupy the purely Bulgarian districts\r\nwhich Serbia now has, to re-erect a united Poland, to give Roumania\r\nher nationals beyond the Carpathians at the expense of Hungary;\r\nto make Hungary as far as possible independent of Vienna in\r\nadministration, and in particular in military affairs--all that is\r\npart of universal policy which everyone expects.\r\n\r\nBut what of Germany from within?\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the control of the Baltic, which the Kiel Canal\r\ninvolves, means that the Kiel Canal should be neutralized. It is\r\nequally evident that, while the Bohemians may not be wholly separated\r\nfrom the Germanic body which nearly encloses them, the largest\r\nmeasure of autonomy for these isolated Slavs fits the case of the\r\nAllies. But as for the policy to be pursued for Germany herself in\r\ncase of a victory on the part of the Allies, that is a much more\r\ncomplex matter.\r\n\r\nRoughly, it would seem to depend upon two main principles: First,\r\nthat the more ancient and the more civilized pole of Germany, the\r\nsouthern pole which is at Vienna, should be in every way favoured\r\nat the expense of the northern pole, Berlin, to which we have owed\r\nthis catastrophe. Secondly, that an economic policy should be\r\nimposed which shall leave industrial Germany free to produce and yet\r\ncompelled to pay.\r\n\r\nA policy of that kind means, of course, a carefully framed tariff, so\r\ndesigned that the tribute necessary to paying the cost of this great\r\nadventure shall fall upon its authors.\r\n\r\nGermany showed the way in 1871 upon what now looks like a modest\r\nscale, but was then designed to be ruthless. It is our business to\r\ncopy that example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBERS IN WAR\r\n\r\n_In which it is explained why, other things being equal, numbers\r\nare always the deciding element in warfare, and how the enemy had a\r\nsuperiority throughout the autumn and winter (written late in the\r\nwinter of 1914-1915)._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBERS IN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general reader hears continually in these times that _numbers_\r\nare the decisive element in war. That every authority, every student\r\nand every soldier is convinced of it, he cannot fail to see from\r\nthe nature of the orders given and of the appeals made. Numbers in\r\nmaterial, and in men, are the one thing urged. The public critique of\r\nthe war is filled with estimates of enemy and allied numbers, numbers\r\nof reserve, numbers of killed, numbers of prisoners. The whole of the\r\nrecruiting movement in this country is based on this same conception\r\nof numbers.\r\n\r\nNow the general reader may appreciate the general character of this\r\nconception, but he must often be puzzled by the detailed application\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIf I am told that ten men are going to fight eight, the mere sound of\r\nthe figures suggests superiority on the part of the ten, but unless I\r\nknow how they are going to fight, I should be puzzled to say exactly\r\nhow the extra two would tell. I certainly could not say whether the\r\ntwo would be enough to make a serious difference or not, and I might\r\ncome to a very wrong conclusion about the chances of the eight or\r\nthe ten. So it is worth while if one is attempting to form a sound\r\nopinion upon the present campaign to see exactly how and why numbers\r\nare the deciding factor in war.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is evident that numbers only begin to tell\r\nwhen other things are fairly equal. Quite a few men armed with\r\nrifles will be a match for multitudes deprived of firearms, and the\r\nhistory of war is full of smaller forces defeating larger forces\r\nfrom Marathon to Ligny. But when war follows upon a long period of\r\npeace and takes place between nations of one civilization all closely\r\ncommunicating one with another, and when war has been the principal\r\nstudy of those nations during the period of peace, then all elements\r\nexcept those of numbers do become fairly equal. And that is exactly\r\nthe condition of the present campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe enemy have certain advantages in material, or had at the\r\nbeginning of the struggle, notably in the matter of heavy artillery,\r\nbut much more in the accurate forecast they had made of the way\r\nin which modern fighting would turn. All sorts of their tactical\r\ntheories turned out to be just.\r\n\r\nThe Allied forces had advantages--the English in personal equipment,\r\nmedical and commissariat service; the French, Russians, and Serbians,\r\nin the type of field gun. The French in particular in their theory of\r\nstrategy, which has proved sound.\r\n\r\nBut there was no conspicuous difference such as would make a smaller\r\nnumber able to defeat a much larger one, and the historical observer\r\nat a distance of time that will make him impartial, will certainly\r\nregard the war as one fought between forces of nearly the same\r\nweaponing and training. The one great differentiating point will be\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nNow how is it that these numbers tell?\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of the thing which I will call (1) The Effect\r\nof _Absolute_ Numbers and (2) The Effect of _Proportionate_ Numbers.\r\n\r\n(1) _Absolute Numbers_. I mean by the effect of absolute numbers the\r\nfact that a certain minimum is required for any particular operation.\r\nFor instance, if you were holding a wall a mile long which an enemy\r\nupon the other side desired to surmount, it is evident that you could\r\nnot hold such a wall with one man even though the enemy on the other\r\nside consisted only in one man. The opportunities for the success\r\nof the enemy would be too great. You could not hold it with ten men\r\nagainst ten. You could hardly hold it with 100 men against 100. But\r\nsupposing that you have 3000 men to hold it with, and they are using\r\nno weapons save their hands, then 3000 men could hold the wall not\r\nonly against 3000 others, but against any number of thousands of\r\nothers; for every man would have as his task the pushing of a ladder\r\noff no more than a very small section of the wall with which his own\r\nhands could deal.\r\n\r\nThere we see what is meant by the necessity of absolute numbers or a\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\nNow that is exactly what you have in the case of a great line of\r\ntrenches. Your defending force does not get weaker and weaker as\r\nit diminishes in number until it reaches zero; it is able to hold\r\ntrenches of a certain length with a certain minimum of men, and when\r\nit falls below that minimum _it cannot hold the line at all_. It has\r\nto fall back upon a shorter line. Supposing you have, for instance,\r\nunder such conditions as those of Diagram I, a line of trenches A-B\r\nholding the issue between two obstacles X and Y against an enemy\r\nwho attacks from the direction E. The number of men holding these\r\ntrenches, A-B, is nine units, and this number is just enough, and\r\nonly just enough, to prevent an enemy attacking from E getting\r\nthrough. Nine units just prevent any part of the line of trenches,\r\nA-B, from being left defenceless.\r\n\r\nWhat does one mean by saying: “Just enough to prevent an enemy\r\ngetting through?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM I. Suppose you have a line of trenches A-B\r\nholding the issue between two obstacles X and Y against an enemy\r\nwho attacks from the direction E. The number of men holding those\r\ntrenches is nine units, and this number is only just enough to\r\nprevent the attacking force getting through.]\r\n\r\nOne means that if you consider trenches in detail, a certain length\r\nof trench needs a certain number of men to hold it, and if that\r\nnumber of men is not present, it must be altogether abandoned. It\r\nis evident that a mile of trench, for instance, could not be held\r\nby half-a-dozen men, even if the forces opposed to them were only a\r\nhalf-dozen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM II. Every man in a trench may be regarded as\r\naccounting for a certain angle of space in front of him, as A-B-C. If\r\nthe extreme point at which you can stop a rush is the line L-L then\r\nyou must have at least enough men--a-a-a--to cover that line with\r\ntheir fire.]\r\n\r\nYou must, first, have enough men to cover the field of fire in front\r\nof the trench with the missiles from the weapons of each, and so stop\r\nthe assault of the enemy. Every man with his rifle may be regarded\r\nas accounting for a certain angle of space in front of him as in\r\nthe angles A B C and the other similar angles in Diagram II. These\r\nangles must meet and cover the whole ground, in theory at least, not\r\nfurther from the trench than the most advanced point to which it has\r\nbeen discovered that an enemy’s rush will reach before combined fire\r\nstops it. In practice, of course, you need very many more men, but\r\nthe theory of the thing is that if the extreme point at which you can\r\nexpect to stop a rush is the line L-L, and if the angle over which\r\na rifle is usefully used is the angle B-A-C, then you cannot hold\r\nthe trench at all unless you have at least enough men a-a-a just to\r\ncover that line L-L with their fire. If you try to do it with less\r\nmen, as in Diagram III, you would only cover a portion of the front;\r\nyou would leave a gap in it between X and Y through which the trench\r\nwould be carried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM III. If you try to hold your trench with less\r\nmen, as in this diagram, you would only cover a portion of the front;\r\nyou would leave a gap in it, between X and Y, through which the\r\ntrench would be carried.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, I repeat, that in practice there are needed to hold\r\ntrenches a great many more men than this. You must allow for your\r\nwastage, for the difference in ability and coolness of different men,\r\nfor the relieving of the men at regular and fairly short intervals,\r\nand in general, it will be found that a line of trenches is not\r\nsuccessfully held with less than 3000 men to a mile.\r\n\r\nThe Germans are now holding in the West a line of trenches 500 miles\r\nlong with something like 4000 men to a mile; so the best work in\r\nthe war would seem to have been done by a portion of the British\r\ncontingent in front of Ypres when, apparently, a body only 1500 men\r\nto the mile, and those I understand, dismounted cavalry, successfully\r\nheld some three miles of trenches for several days.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, then, that when you are considering a line of\r\ntrenches you must consider them as a series of sections, to defend\r\neach of which sections a certain minimum is required. Thus we may\r\nconsider the line A-B in Diagram IV as consisting of nine sections,\r\nas numbered, and each section as requiring a certain minimum unit of\r\nmen, say a thousand. If any section has less than its proper minimum\r\nthe whole line fails, for that section will be carried and the cord\r\nwill be broken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM IV. The line of trenches A-B may consist of\r\nnine sections, to defend each of which 1000 men are required. If any\r\nsection has less than its proper minimum the whole line fails.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAMS V and VI. Suppose by killed, wounded and\r\nprisoners the nine sections dwindle to six, the line A-B can no\r\nlonger be held. The six remaining sections would have to group\r\nthemselves as above, and in either case there would be a bad gap.\r\nWhat then can the general in command of this dwindled force do?--\r\n\r\n  (_See Diagram VII overleaf._)]\r\n\r\nNow look back at the first diagram; there you have the line A-B, and\r\nthere are nine units just able to hold it.\r\n\r\nSuppose by killed and prisoners and wounded and disease the nine\r\ndwindle to six, then the line A-B can no longer be held. It means\r\nin practice that the six remaining would have to be grouped as in\r\nDiagram V or as in Diagram VI, and in any case there would be a bad\r\ngap, double or single, through which the enemy pressing from E would\r\npierce. What can the general in command of the defence do when his\r\nforce has thus dwindled?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: --DIAGRAM VII. The defender has no choice but to fall\r\nback on shorter lines, such as F-G, which his remaining six units can\r\njust hold. If the six dwindle to four he must again fall back to a\r\nyet shorter line, C-D.]\r\n\r\nHe has no choice but to _fall back upon shorter lines_. That is,\r\nhaving only six units left he must retire to some such point as the\r\nline F-G, Diagram VII, where his remaining six units will be just\r\nsufficient to hold the line, and if the six dwindle to four he must\r\nagain fall back to a yet shorter line, such as C-D.\r\n\r\nNote carefully that this does not concern proportionate numbers. We\r\nare not here considering the relative strength of the defence and of\r\nthe offence; we are dealing with absolute numbers, with a minimum\r\nbelow which the defensive _cannot_ hold a certain line at all, but\r\n_must_ seek a shorter one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM VIII. The Germans are now holding, roughly,\r\nthe line A-B, from the North Sea to the Swiss Mountains--500 miles\r\nlong in all its twists and turns. If dwindling numbers force them\r\nto take up a shorter line they could either abandon Alsace-Lorraine\r\nand substitute C-G for C-B, or abandon most of Belgium and Northern\r\nFrance and substitute E-C for A-C. With still failing numbers they\r\nwould have to take up the still shorter line F-B. It would be no\r\nshortening of the German line to fall back upon the Rhine, D-D-D.]\r\n\r\nNow that is precisely the state of affairs upon the French and\r\nBelgian frontiers at this moment. The Germans are holding a line,\r\nwhich is roughly that shown in Diagram VIII, between the Swiss\r\nmountains and the sea near Nieuport, the line A-B about 400 miles\r\nlong in all its twists and turns. If their numbers fall below a\r\ncertain level they cannot hold that line at all, and they must take\r\nup a shorter line. How could they do this? Either by abandoning\r\nAlsace-Lorraine and substituting C-G for the present C-B, or by\r\nabandoning most of Belgium and all northern France, and falling back\r\nupon the line Antwerp-Namur-The Ardennes and the Vosges, substituting\r\nE-C for A-C. With failing numbers they would have to take up a still\r\nshorter line from Liege southwards, just protecting German territory,\r\nthe line F-B.\r\n\r\nAs for the line of the Rhine lying immediately behind F-B, the line\r\nD-D-D, it is a great deal longer than the shortest line they could\r\ntake up. F-B, and though heavily fortified at five important points\r\nand with slighter fortifications elsewhere, it would need quite as\r\nmany men to defend it as a corresponding line of trenches. Thus it\r\nwould be no shortening of the German line to fall back upon the Rhine.\r\n\r\nSo much for an illustration of what is meant by absolute numbers\r\nand of their importance in the present phase of the campaign.\r\n\r\n(2) Now what of _Proportionate_ numbers? That is a point upon which\r\neven closer attention must be fixed, because upon it will depend the\r\nissue of the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we have to see clearly is that Austria and Germany\r\nbegan the war with a very great preponderance in numbers of trained\r\nand equipped men ready to take the field within the first six weeks.\r\nThey had here a great advantage over Russia and France combined, and\r\nto see what that advantage was look at Diagram IX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM IX. A represents the total number of men\r\nGermany and Austria together could put into the field by about the\r\nmiddle of September. B represents the French and the first British\r\ncontingent; C what the Russians could do. This shows that Germany and\r\nAustria began the war with a great advantage over Russia, France and\r\nBritain combined, in their numbers of trained and equipped men ready\r\nto take the field within the first six weeks.]\r\n\r\nFigure A represents the total number of men Germany and Austria\r\ntogether could put into the field by about the middle of September. B\r\nrepresents the French and the first British contingent in the West; C\r\nwhat the Russians could do in the East.\r\n\r\nThis original superiority of the enemy is a point very little\r\nappreciated because of two things. First, that men tend to think of\r\nthe thing in nations and not in numbers, and they think of Germany,\r\none unit, attacked by England, France, Russia, a lot of other units,\r\nand next because there is a grave misconception as to the numbers\r\nRussia could put into the field _early_ in the war.\r\n\r\nRussia had a certain force quite ready, that is fully equipped,\r\nofficered, trained, gunned, and the rest of it. But she had nothing\r\nlike the numbers in proportion to her population that the enemy had.\r\nThe proportions of population were between Russia and her enemy as\r\nseventeen to thirteen. But Germany and, to a less extent, Austria\r\nand Hungary, had organized the whole population ultimately for war.\r\nRussia could not do this. Her advantage, only to be obtained after\r\na considerable lapse of time, was the power of perpetually raising\r\nnew contingents, which, by the time they were trained and equipped\r\ncould successively enter the field. But at the opening of the war,\r\nsay by the middle of September, when she had perhaps at the most\r\ntwo-and-a-half million men in Poland, the total forces of the enemy,\r\nthat is the total number of men Austria and Germany had equipped,\r\ntrained, and ready for the field since the beginning of the war, was\r\nat least eight million.\r\n\r\nYou have the war, then, beginning with the enemy standing at quite\r\n8, the French nominally at 4, but really nearer 3; Russia at 2½.\r\n\r\nLet us see how time was to modify this grave disproportion and how\r\nnew contingents coupled with the effect of wastage were to affect it.\r\n\r\nThe armies which were in the field in the early part of the war bear\r\nvery various relations to the countries from which they come.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain had upon the Sambre in the first battle of the campaign\r\nrather more than one-tenth per cent. of her total population. The\r\nFrench had in the field at the outset of the war 5 per cent. of their\r\ntotal population, the Russians 1 per cent., the Germans perhaps 5 per\r\ncent., the Austrians between 3 and 4 per cent., the Serbians quite\r\n10 per cent.--and 10 per cent. is the largest total any nation can\r\npossibly put into the field.\r\n\r\nNow the chances of growth for each of these contingents were very\r\ndifferent in each case.\r\n\r\nThat of Great Britain was indefinitely large. Given sufficient time,\r\nsufficient money, and sufficient incentive, Great Britain might\r\nultimately put into the field two million or even three. She was\r\ncertain of putting into the field in the first year of the war more\r\nthan one million; she might hope to put in two. She had further\r\nbehind her as a recruiting field, the Colonies, and--a matter of\r\ndiscussion--the Indian Army.\r\n\r\nThe French had nothing to fall back on save the young men who were\r\ngrowing up. Therefore, they were certain not to be able to add to\r\ntheir numbers for at least six months, which is just about the time\r\nit takes to train effectively new formations.\r\n\r\nThe Germans had in reserve about as many men again as they had put\r\nunder arms at the beginning of the war. If the French could hope for\r\na grand total of four millions wherein somewhat over three might be\r\nreally effective and of useful age for active service in any shape,\r\nthen Germany might hope to produce a grand total of somewhat over\r\nseven millions and a similar useful body of over five, for the German\r\nadult males are to the French as more than five to three.\r\n\r\nAustria could in the same way call up a reserve somewhat larger in\r\nproportion than the Germans, but as her population was somewhat\r\nsmaller than Germany, we must write her down for something over four\r\nmillions instead of something over five, for a grand total of between\r\nfive and six millions instead of for a grand total of seven.\r\n\r\nSerbia, like France, could not increase her contingent save by\r\ncalling up her younger men; and her army was, like that of the\r\nFrench, a fixed quantity, at any rate for the first six months of\r\nthe war, and increased by one-tenth or less when the new class was\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\nRussia in her turn presented yet another type of growth. She had by\r\nfar larger reserves of adult males than any other Power, and was\r\npractically equal, in the material of which one can ultimately make\r\ntrained soldiers, to Germany and Austria combined; theoretically,\r\ncounting all her various races, she was the superior of Austria and\r\nGermany combined. But it was certain that she could not equip more\r\nthan a certain number in a given time, or train them, or officer\r\nthem, or govern them.\r\n\r\nI think it just to say that she certainly could not put into the\r\nEuropean field more than five millions during the better part of\r\nthe first year of the war. Though it must be remembered that if the\r\nwar lasted indefinitely she would have at her back at any period\r\nindefinitely large reserves to draw upon.\r\n\r\nLet us call Russia ultimately, for the purposes of the war during all\r\nits first months, a minimum of three and a maximum of five millions.\r\nLet us count Great Britain in those same months at two millions,\r\nincluding all who have gone out, all since recruited, and the many\r\nmore who will not be either recruited or fully trained for some\r\nmonths to come--but excluding foreign garrisons and naval forces.\r\nSuch an estimate is certainly a maximum for that period.\r\n\r\nThen putting all these figures together and considering for the\r\nmoment no wastage, the figures become as in Diagram X.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM X. How will time modify the grave\r\ndisproportion indicated in Diagram IX? Taking, roughly, the first\r\nfew months of the war, apart from wastage, our enemies remain month\r\nafter month far superior to either half of the Allies they are\r\nfighting--the French and English in the West, the Russians in the\r\nEast.]\r\n\r\n_Observe in this diagram and retain it for purposes of judgment\r\nthroughout the war--it is far the most important truth to\r\nretain--that, apart from wastage, our enemies remained throughout the\r\nwinter far superior to either half of the Allies they are fighting.\r\nRemember that we did not put as against Austro-Germany in the West\r\nmore than 6 to 9 for a long time, nor Russia in the East certainly\r\nmore than 5 to 9._\r\n\r\nThe Allies combined will at last be superior to their enemy\r\nnumerically, but only superior in a proportion of 11 to 9 (exclusive\r\nof wastage), and that maximum will not be reached till summer.\r\n\r\nI have italicized that paragraph because the misapprehension of so\r\nsimple a truth is at the bottom of three-quarters of the nonsense\r\none hears about the campaign. It was at the bottom of the conception\r\nthat victory would be easy and short; at the bottom of the conception\r\nthat it would be certain, and it is at the bottom of much foolish\r\nimpatience and criticism to-day.\r\n\r\nIt was a knowledge of this truth which made the German Government\r\nfeel secure of success when it forced on the war at its chosen day\r\nand hour (remember with what curious superstition the Germans passed\r\nthe frontier on the same day and at the same hour as in 1870), and\r\nan ignorance of it alone can account for the follies one still hears.\r\n\r\nEven as I write I rise from reading the account of a sermon by some\r\nclergyman, an Englishman--but not in England, I am glad to say--who\r\ntalked of Germany, with her back to the wall, fighting the world, and\r\nexpressing his admiration thereat. He had evidently never considered\r\nthe element of numbers.\r\n\r\nNow what about the wastage?\r\n\r\nLuckily for us, German necessities, as well as German doctrine, have\r\ninvolved very heavy wastage. And, luckily for us, that wastage has\r\nbeen particularly heavy in the matter of officers.\r\n\r\nA discussion on numbers does not allow one to stray into the\r\nequally important moral factors of the war, but the fact may be\r\njust alluded to that the whole general military organism of Germany\r\ndepends more than that of any other nation upon the gulf between the\r\nofficer and those next in command. Not only can you make a French\r\nnon-commissioned officer into an officer without fear of losing an\r\natom of the moral strength of the French military organism, but the\r\nthing is done continually during peace and during war on a large\r\nscale. In Germany you can do nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe attack in close formation, with all its obvious advantages of\r\nspeed and with all the very fine tradition of discipline which makes\r\nit possible, is another element of expense, but most expensive of all\r\nis the determination to win at once.\r\n\r\nWhy have the Germans been thus prodigal of men in their determination\r\nto win rapidly? A long war is dreaded by Germany for four separate\r\nand equal reasons:\r\n\r\n  (1) That in a really considerable length of time two of her\r\n  opponents are capable of indefinite expansion--Russia and\r\n  Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  (2) Because all historical experience is there to show that\r\n  the French are a nation that rally, and that unless you\r\n  pin them after their first defeats their tenacity will be\r\n  increasingly dangerous.\r\n\r\n  (3) Because the power of the British Fleet is capable of\r\n  establishing a blockade more or less complete, and hitherto\r\n  only less complete from political considerations.\r\n\r\n  (4) Because the strategical problem, the fighting upon two\r\n  fronts, involves, as a method of victory, final success\r\n  upon one front before you can be certain of success upon\r\n  the other.\r\n\r\nThis last point merits illustration. An army fighting inferior bodies\r\non two fronts is just like a very big man fighting two much smaller\r\nmen. They can harass him more than their mere fighting power or\r\nweight accounts for, and they can do so because they are attacking\r\nupon different sides.\r\n\r\nThe big man so situated will certainly attempt to put out of action\r\none of his two opponents before he puts his full force against the\r\nother. It would be a plan necessary to the situation, and it is\r\nexactly the same with a Power or a group of Powers fighting upon two\r\nfronts, although they find themselves in superior numbers on either\r\nfront, as the Austro-Germans do still.\r\n\r\nFor all these four reasons, then, Germany was bound to waste men,\r\nand she did waste men largely until about the end of last year. She\r\nthrew them away recklessly during the first advance on Paris, next\r\nduring the great attacks in Flanders, then--quite separately--in her\r\ndesperate Polish effort to reach Warsaw, which goal, at the moment of\r\nwriting, she has wholly failed to attain.\r\n\r\nBut though we know that Germany and Austro-Hungary have lost men in a\r\ngreater proportion than the Western Allies, and though we may guess\r\nthat they have lost men in a greater proportion than our Eastern\r\nAllies--in spite of the heavy losses in prisoners at Tannenberg--it\r\nis less easy to give an accurate estimate of the proportion.\r\n\r\nIn one case and up to one date we can arrive pretty accurately at the\r\nproportion. The German Empire alone had, up to a particular date in\r\nthe autumn, lost in hit, sick, and caught (I will speak in a moment\r\nof the question of “returns”) 40 per cent. of the individuals up to\r\nthat date put into the field. Both the French and the English had up\r\nto the same date lost just under 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nI know that that figure 40 per cent. looks absurdly exaggerated\r\nwhen it is put thus without support, but it is a perfectly sound\r\nconclusion. If you take the lists published by Prussia, note the\r\ndates to which they refer, the proportion of killed to the _admitted_\r\nwounded, and add the proportion for Bavaria, Wurtemburg, and Saxony,\r\nyou find that at this date in the late autumn two millions were\r\naffected, and Germany had not armed more than five millions at the\r\nmost at that time.\r\n\r\nNow, as in our own case, the proportion of officers hit, wounded,\r\nand caught was large compared to that of men; but what is more\r\nimportant, perhaps, the proportion of officers killed or badly\r\nwounded was very much larger in proportion to the slightly wounded\r\nthan was the case with the men; it is fairly certain that one-half\r\nof the trained professional officers of the German service were\r\npermanently out of action by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nSupposing the Russian losses to be no greater than the Western Allies\r\n(they probably are somewhat greater, from the conditions of the\r\nfighting), or call them 30 per cent. instead of 25 per cent., and\r\nsupposing the Austro-Hungarian losses to be comparable to the German\r\n(which, from the only available sources of statistics, they would\r\nseem to be), then we can strike a very rough estimate of the element\r\nof wastage, and we can say that if the central figure be taken as 9,\r\n3.6 have gone; while of the 4 and 3 on either side (the proportionate\r\nstrength of the Allies West and East in the first phase) 1 has gone\r\nin each case, leaving 3 and 2.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that, from this rough calculation, the wastage of\r\nthe enemy has been so much greater than our own that, if it were\r\nabsolute, his preponderance in numbers would have ceased, and the\r\nfigures would stand nearly equal.\r\n\r\nBut there is one last element in the calculation which must not be\r\nforgotten. The only people permanently out of action in the war are\r\nthe killed, the disabled, and the captured. Much the greater part of\r\nthe sick return to the centre, and _just over half the wounded_--at\r\nleast, in a modern war, and where there are good ambulance\r\narrangements and good roads for them to work on.\r\n\r\nNow, though these “returns” are probably smaller in the East than\r\nin the West (for in the Eastern field climate and absence of\r\ncommunication are fatal to many of the wounded, who would be saved\r\nin the Western field), we should do well to take a conservative\r\nestimate, and regard it as half the wounded in each case; or,\r\nexcluding prisoners, more than a third--say, 35 per cent. of all\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\nWe must add, therefore, in that proportion to all our figures, and\r\nthe result will slightly modify our conclusion, for as the central\r\nbody--the enemy--has had more casualties, so it has a larger number\r\nof returns in proportion to its size, and the general deduction is\r\nthat at the moment of writing (late winter) the Germanic body and the\r\nAllies opposed to them actually in the field or in training--just\r\nbehind the field and ready to approach it within a few weeks--are\r\nnearly equal in total numbers, but with an appreciable margin still\r\nin favour of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLY\r\n\r\n\r\n_After numbers, the second main factor in the strength of an army is\r\nits supply--its means of obtaining clothes, food, shelter, ammunition\r\nand all those objects without which it can neither exist nor fight.\r\nThe marvellously complicated and expensive organization entailed is\r\nhere fully explained._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLY\r\n\r\n\r\nAn army has two main factors of strength--that is, two main material\r\nfactors apart from the moral factors of courage, discipline, habit,\r\nand relationship. These two material factors are first its numbers,\r\nand secondly its supply.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is so much the more obvious in the public eye that\r\nit is often alone considered. It is, of course, the basis of all the\r\nrest. Unless you have a sufficient number of men for your task you\r\ncannot accomplish that task at all. But the second, which is less\r\noften considered by general opinion, is a necessity no less absolute\r\nthan the necessity for adequate numbers.\r\n\r\nThe general term “supply” covers all those objects without which\r\nan army cannot exist or fight--clothing, shelter, food, weapons,\r\nauxiliary instruments, ammunition.\r\n\r\nNow it is not the intention of these few lines to enter into details\r\nor to give precise information, such as may be obtained by reference\r\nto the text books, but rather to bring out a few main points about\r\nsupply which are not generally considered, especially in moments\r\nsuch as this, when the obtaining of numbers by voluntary recruitment\r\nis the chief matter in the public mind. And these chief points with\r\nregard to supply may be put briefly in three groups.\r\n\r\nFirst we ought to grasp the _scale_ of supply: that is, the\r\nmagnitude of the operation which is undertaken when an army is\r\nequipped, put into the field, and maintained there.\r\n\r\nNext we must grasp the _rate_ of supply--the pace at which the stream\r\nof supply has got to be kept moving (varying for various forms of\r\nsupply) in order that an army shall neither break down nor dwindle in\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nLastly we must consider the _delicacy_ or liability to\r\n_embarrassment_ of supply; that is, the difficulties peculiar\r\nto the maintenance of an army in the field, the ease with which\r\nthat maintenance may be fatally interrupted, and the consequent\r\nembarrassment which an enemy may be made to feel, or which the enemy\r\nmay make us feel, in this vital operation of war.\r\n\r\nAs to the scale of supply. Remark that there are in this factor a\r\nnumber of elements easily overlooked, and the first is the element\r\nof comparative expense. It is of no great value to put before men\r\nrows of figures showing that a large army costs so many millions of\r\npounds. It is the _comparative_ economic burden of armed service as\r\ncontrasted with civilian work which is really of importance, and\r\nwhich is much more easily grasped than the absolute amount of the\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of men in an army are, of course, drawn from the same\r\nrank of society as the great mass of labourers and artisans during\r\npeace, and the very first point we have to note about a state of war\r\nis that these men are provided for their trade with instruments and\r\nprovisions upon a higher scale than anything which they require in\r\ntheir civilian life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM I. The great mass of men in the army are drawn\r\nfrom the same rank of society as the great mass of labourers and\r\nartisans during peace; but they are provided for their trade with\r\ninstruments and provisions upon a higher scale than anything which\r\nthey required in their civilian life. The difference in the cost of\r\nupkeep--clothing, food, implements, etc.--of a navvy and a soldier\r\nfor one year is shown approximately in the above diagram.]\r\n\r\nTheir clothing is and must be better, for the wear of a campaign is\r\nsomething very different from the wear of ordinary living. It is\r\nto this factor that one owes not a little of the complaints that\r\nalways arise during a war upon the quality of the material used by\r\ncontractors.\r\n\r\nLet me give an example drawn from my personal experience. If I am\r\nnot mistaken, the heavy dark blue great-coat worn by the gunners in\r\nthe French service costs (when all expense was reduced to a minimum\r\nthrough the agency of Government factories, through the purchase of\r\nclothing wholesale, and through the absence of a whole series of\r\nthose profits attaching to ordinary trade) no less than 100 francs,\r\nor £4. That great-coat stood for material and workmanship which,\r\nsold in a West End shop in London, would have meant anything from\r\n£6 upwards. In other words, the private soldiers all through a vast\r\nbody of men were wearing a great-coat of a quality--in expense, at\r\nleast--which only very well-to-do men, only a tiny minority in the\r\nState, could afford in time of peace.\r\n\r\nNext observe that you feed the man (I am glad to say) far better than\r\nthe modern capitalist system of production feeds him. You must do\r\nthis, or you would not be able to maintain your army at its highest\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nMany a man who in civilian life would never get butcher’s meat more\r\nthan once or twice a week, receives a pound and a quarter of meat\r\na day in an army. He receives over a pound of bread. And it is\r\ncurious to note in a conscript service how small a proportion of the\r\nmen--only those, indeed, who are drawn from quite the wealthier\r\nclasses--find the provisioning of the army distasteful (none find it\r\ninadequate), and how, for the great majority, it is an advance over\r\nthat to which they were accustomed at home.\r\n\r\nBut there is much more than this high scale of expenditure in the\r\nthings necessary to the maintenance of the man himself. You are also\r\nequipping him with special furniture far more expensive than that\r\nwhich he uses in ordinary life.\r\n\r\nYou give to the minesman a rifle which is a carefully constructed\r\nand expensive machine, much more valuable than all the tools that\r\nwould ever be in the possession of any but a small minority of\r\nskilled artisans. He has belt, pouches, pack covering to match. He\r\nmust expend in the use of that weapon ammunition costing something\r\nquite out of proportion to any expenditure involved by the use of his\r\nimplements in his civilian trade.\r\n\r\nThe cavalryman you equip with a horse, which he could not think of\r\naffording as his own property, and which is superior in quality\r\nto the horse he may be working with for a master in most trades,\r\nlet alone the fact that the proportion of men thus equipped with\r\nhorses is much larger than the proportion of men who in civilian\r\nlife have to deal with those animals. To the driver of a gun you\r\nare apportioning two horses necessarily sound and strong; to the\r\nnon-commissioned officers throughout the field artillery, to a great\r\nnumber of officers throughout the service, you are furnishing horses\r\nwhich, in a civilian occupation, they could never afford, and you\r\nare, of course, also providing the keep of those horses.\r\n\r\nMany branches of the service you are equipping with instruments of\r\nvery high expense indeed. A field gun does not cost less, I believe,\r\nthan £600. And to every thousand men you actually put into the field\r\nyou may reckon at least four of these instruments. Every time one of\r\nthem fires a shot it fires away fifteen shillings. Apart from the\r\nwear and tear of the field piece itself, a modern quick-firing piece,\r\nfiring moderately, will get rid of a ten pound note in ammunition in\r\na minute, and each piece is allowed from the base onwards 1000 rounds.\r\n\r\nFurther, an army is equipped with heavy artillery, the pieces of\r\nwhich cost anything from many hundreds to many thousands of pounds,\r\naccording to their calibre (a 9.2, with its mounting, comes to\r\nnear £12,000); and it is also equipped with a mass of auxiliary\r\nmaterial--vehicles, mechanical and other, telephones, field kitchens,\r\naircraft, and the rest--none of which expense attaches to the same\r\nbody of men in their civilian life.\r\n\r\nThe scale of the business is further emphasised by the fact that\r\nonce war is engaged the nation as a whole is suddenly called upon to\r\nproduce material not only _more expensive_ upon the average, man for\r\nman, than the same men would have used and consumed in the same time\r\nin civilian life, but things _different from_ those things which the\r\nnation was organized to produce for use and consumption during peace.\r\nThat change in effect is costly. And yet another element of cost is\r\nthe novel use of existing instruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM II. Many branches of the service are equipped\r\nwith instruments of very high expense indeed. A field gun, for\r\ninstance, does not cost less than £600. Every time one of them fires\r\na shot it fires away fifteen shillings. A modern quick-firing piece,\r\nfiring moderately, will get rid of a ten pound note in ammunition in\r\na minute. Each piece is allowed from the base onwards 1000 rounds and\r\nthe extent of this quantity is illustrated in the diagram--40 rows of\r\nshells, 25 in a row.]\r\n\r\nIt is more expensive to use an instrument for some purpose for which\r\nit was never designed, than to use it for some purpose for which\r\nit was designed. That is a universal truth from the hammering in\r\nof a nail with a boot heel to the commandeering of a liner for the\r\ntransport of troops. And in time of war the whole nation begins at\r\nonce to use instruments right and left for military purposes, which\r\ninstruments had been originally designed for civilian purposes.\r\n\r\nAll up and down France and England, for instance, at this moment,\r\nevery workshop which can by hook or by crook turn out ammunition\r\nis turning it out, and very often is turning it out with\r\ninstruments--lathes, cutting tools, etc.--that were originally\r\ndesigned not for making ammunition at all, but for making the parts\r\nof bicycles, of pumps, of motors, of turbines, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother instance. Both Powers have found their motor-buses extremely\r\nhandy in this war. Paris has been almost bereft of them. London has\r\nbeen largely denuded of her normal supply. But a motor-bus carrying\r\nmeat or even troops is not doing what it was specially designed to\r\ndo--to wit, to run on the good roads of a great town, with a certain\r\nmaximum load. It needs adaptation, it is used far more roughly, has a\r\nshorter life, and is being therefore more expensively consumed.\r\n\r\nHere is one fairly graphic way of showing what this scale of supply\r\nmeans. Take an Army Corps of 40,000 men. That stands in meat\r\nalone for one year for about as many beasts. It means in clothing\r\nalone--initial expense--apart from waste of all kinds, and apart\r\nfrom weapons and auxiliary machinery, something between (counting\r\naccoutrement) a quarter and half a million pounds. It stands, in\r\n_daily_ rations of bread alone, for nearly 200 sacks of wheat; in\r\nmaterial equipment--initial, apart from ammunition--it stands in\r\nweapons and machines for at least another quarter of a million, in\r\n_ready_ ammunition of small arms for at least £80,000, in shell for\r\nas much again.\r\n\r\nTo all this conception of scale you must add two more points. The\r\nsoldier is moved in a way that the civilian is not. He is given at\r\nthe expense of the State and not for his pleasure, the equivalent of\r\na great quantity of lengthy excursions. He is taken across the sea,\r\nbrought back on leave or in convalescence, moved from place to place\r\nby train or by mechanical traction, and all that upon a scale quite\r\nout of proportion to the narrow limits of his travel during civilian\r\noccupation. Within six months hundreds of thousands of Englishmen\r\nhave been conveyed to the heart of France, moved again in that\r\ncountry over a space of more than a hundred miles, and a considerable\r\nproportion of them brought back and sent out again in the interval.\r\nLastly, there is the indeterminate but heavy medical expense.\r\n\r\nThe second and last point in this consideration of scale is the\r\nenormously expensive element of uncertainty. It would be expensive\r\nenough to have to arrange for so much movement and so much clothing\r\nand equipment upon a wholly novel and increased scale, if we knew\r\nexactly what that movement and that equipment was to be--if, so to\r\nspeak, you could take the problem _statically_ and work out its\r\ndetails in an office as you work out the costings of a great shop\r\nor factory. But it is in the essence of an army that it should\r\nbe mobile, moving suddenly and as quickly as possible where it\r\nis wanted, with no power of prediction as to how those moves may\r\ndevelop. You are “in” therefore, for an unknown factor of expense\r\nover and above the novelty and very high cost of the economic energy\r\nyou suddenly bring into play with war. And that unknown factor is the\r\nextent to which you will be wasting and moving.\r\n\r\nIf considerations such as these give us some idea of the _scale_ of\r\nsupply, a further series of considerations will help us to appreciate\r\nthe _rate_ or _pace_ at which the stream of supply must flow.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways in which this can be graphically presented\r\nthrough examples. Here are a few.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain controls half of the shipping of the world. She engages\r\nin the present war and part of her floating mercantile resources is\r\nsuddenly required for the campaign. Those ships have to be constantly\r\nsteaming, consuming coal, provisions for their crews, materials for\r\nrepairs, at a far higher rate than their civilian use demanded; and\r\nthe thing translates itself to the ordinary citizen in the shape of\r\nvastly increased freights and consequently increased prices for the\r\nimports received by this island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM III. Great Britain controls half the shipping\r\nof the world. She engages in war, and a part of her floating\r\nmercantile resources is suddenly required for the campaign. Those\r\nships have to be constantly steaming, consuming coals, provisions,\r\netc., at a far higher rate than their civilian use demanded; and\r\nthe thing translates itself to the ordinary citizen in the shape of\r\nincreased freights, and consequently increased prices for imports.\r\nThe groups A, B and C combined represent the shipping of the world--A\r\nbeing foreign shipping. B and C together represent the whole of the\r\nBritish shipping, while the group C by itself represents the portion\r\ndetached for the purposes of the war.]\r\n\r\nHere is another example. This country is as highly industrialized as\r\nany in the world. It is particularly fitted for the production of\r\nmechanical objects, and especially for mechanical objects in metal,\r\nyet suppose that even this country were asked suddenly (with no more\r\nthan the plant it had before the war) to equip such a force as that\r\nwith which the French defended their country last August--not to\r\nequip it with ammunition but with weapons and auxiliary machinery\r\nalone; the performance of such a task would have taken all the arms\r\nfactories of Great Britain more than two years.\r\n\r\nTake the rate of expenditure of ammunition. In considering this\r\nelement in the pace or rate of supply we must remember the moments\r\nin which waste at the front becomes abnormal. A rapid retirement\r\nlike the retreat from Mons means the loss of material wholesale.\r\nA favourable moment seized, as September 6 was seized, for the\r\ncounter-offensive, which is known as “The Battle of the Marne,” means\r\nsuch an expenditure of ammunition as was never provided for in any of\r\nthe text-books or considered possible until this campaign was engaged.\r\n\r\nHere is an example. The Germans had prepared war for two\r\nyears--prepared it specially for the particular moment in which\r\nthey forced it upon Europe. Their first operations in France up to\r\nSeptember 6 followed almost exactly the plan they had carefully\r\nelaborated. Nevertheless, we now know that whole groups of the enemy\r\nran through the enormous supplies which were pouring in to their\r\nfront, and that one element in the disarray of the first German army\r\nin those critical days was the shortage of shell, particularly for\r\nthe heavy pieces.\r\n\r\nIt is generally reported, and it is probably true, that the enemy\r\nexhausted before the end of his great effort in the West (which\r\nlasted less than one hundred days, and the intensity of which was\r\nrelaxed after the middle of November) _seven times_ the heavy\r\nammunition he had allowed for the whole campaign.\r\n\r\nHere is another example. The life of a horse in the South African War\r\nwas, I believe, not quite as many _weeks_ as the same animal had\r\nexpectation of _years_ in civilian occupation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM IV. A troop train is a very long train, and it\r\nis packed close with men. To move one Army Corps alone (without the\r\ncavalry) you must allow over 180 such trains. The diagram gives you\r\nan idea of what that means.]\r\n\r\nHere is yet another example, connected with the transport. A troop\r\ntrain is a very long train, and it is packed close with men. For the\r\ntransport of animals and of material objects every inch of space\r\navailable is calculated and used. Well, to move one Army Corps alone\r\n(without the cavalry) you must allow over 180 such trains. Now,\r\neven at the origin of the war, upon one front alone, before the\r\nnumbers had fully developed, the German invasion involved at least\r\ntwenty-five Army Corps.\r\n\r\nSuch an appreciation of the scale and the pace of supply is\r\nsufficient to illuminate one’s third point, the delicacy of the\r\nwhole business, and the peril of its embarrassment. You are feeding,\r\nmunitioning, clothing, evacuating the wounded from, sheltering, and\r\nequipping millions of men; those millions subject to sudden abnormal\r\nperiods of wastage, any one of which may come at any unexpected\r\nmoment, and further subject to sudden unforeseen movements upon any\r\nscale. You must so co-ordinate all your movements of supply that no\r\npart of the vast line is pinched even for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe whole process may be compared to the perpetual running of\r\nmillions of double threads, which reach from every soldier back\r\nultimately to the central depots of the army, and thence to the\r\nmanufactories, and these double threads perpetually working back\r\nand forth from the manufactories to the Front. These double\r\nthreads--always travelling back and forth, remember--are gathered\r\ninto a vast number of small, local centres, the sheaves or cords so\r\nformed are gathered back again to some hundreds of greater centres,\r\nand these ropes again concentrated upon some dozens of main bases\r\nof supply. And the ends of these threads--though all in continual\r\nmovement back and forth--must each be kept taut, must cross sometimes\r\none over the other in a complicated pattern perpetually requiring\r\nreadjustment, while all the time now one, now another group of\r\nthreads suddenly sets up a heavy strain, where the men to whom they\r\nrelate are engaged in particularly violent action.\r\n\r\nTo keep such a web untangled, duly stretched, and accurately working\r\nis an effort of organization such as will never be seen in civilian\r\nlife, and such as was never seen, even in military life, until modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM V. An important point in connexion with\r\nsupply is the delicacy of the whole business and the peril of its\r\nembarrassment. The diagram concerns only one tiny detail of the\r\nprocess--no more than the supply of ammunition to one part of a\r\ndivision out of the hundreds of divisions that build up an army.\r\nIt shows how the ammunition is sorted and distributed from an\r\nammunition park to the men in the front line; the complexity under\r\nactual conditions of service being apt to be far more tangled and\r\ndiversified, according to circumstances.]\r\n\r\nObserve the fifth diagram, which concerns only one tiny detail of\r\nthe process; no more than the supply of ammunition (out of all that\r\nhas to be supplied) and no more than the ammunition of one part of\r\na division (excluding cavalry) out of the hundreds of divisions\r\nand more that build up one of these great national armies. Even\r\nthat diagram, complex as it is, does not nearly represent the\r\nwhole complexity even of so small a fraction, but is sufficient to\r\nillustrate my case.\r\n\r\nSuch a machine or organization, by which an army lives, and in\r\nthe collapse of which an army rapidly ceases to be, is clearly at\r\nthe mercy of the least disorder. It is indeed protected by the\r\nmost careful dispositions, and everything is done to safeguard its\r\ngathering strands, as they unite towards the base, from interruption.\r\nBut conceive what the effect of such interruption would be, or\r\neven the menace of it! Deduce from this the importance where such a\r\nvast body of men is concerned, of _freedom from embarrassment_ in\r\nthe minds of those who have to direct the operation of the almost\r\ninfinite skein!\r\n\r\nIt is this point, the peril of embarrassment, which is--at the\r\nmoment in which I am writing these lines--of such capital importance\r\nin connection with the question of blockade. We may blockade an\r\nenemy’s resources and say: “With very careful economy he has food for\r\nnine-tenths of the year”; or, “Though already anxious for the future,\r\nhe has sufficient copper for his shell and cartridge cases for some\r\ntime to come”; or, “Though already the Government is forbidding the\r\nsale of petrol, the enemy can, for some time to come, supply his\r\nmechanical transport.” But the mere numerical calculation of his\r\ndecreasing resources is no guide to the moral disorder which the\r\nperil alone may cause. The elasticity of the whole machine is at once\r\naffected from the mere knowledge that abnormal economy is demanded.\r\nThe directing brain of it is disturbed in an increasing degree as\r\ncivilian necessities mix with the already severe strain upon the\r\nsupplies of the army.\r\n\r\nTo produce such a confusion, moral as well as material, is the\r\ndirecting motive of blockade, and the success of such a policy begins\r\nlong before the point of grave material embarrassment is reached.\r\n\r\nIt is on this account that nations fighting with their whole\r\nstrength, as modern nations in competition with the detestable\r\nPrussian model are compelled to fight, must ultimately, willy-nilly,\r\nturn to the policy of complete blockade, and that the success of\r\nthis policy attempted by both parties to a struggle--necessarily\r\nbetter achieved by one than by the other--will perhaps more largely\r\nthan anything else determine--seeing what the complexity of national\r\ncommerce now is--the issue of a great modern war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR TO-DAY AND YESTERDAY\r\n\r\n\r\n_This war, in many ways, is quite different from any war in the past.\r\nThe length of defensive lines, the development of field fortification\r\nand of big guns, and other important matters are dealt with in the\r\nfollowing pages._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR TO-DAY AND YESTERDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has appeared in the present campaign a number of situations so\r\ndifferent both from what was known of war in the past and from what\r\nwas expected of any great modern war in West Europe that opinion upon\r\nthe change is confused and bewildered. Sometimes it is thrown right\r\nout of its bearings by the novelties it witnesses. And, what is more\r\ngrave, opinion is sometimes led to misjudge altogether the nature of\r\nwar by these novelties.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you find people telling you that a war such as this\r\ncan end in a “draw” or stalemate. They say this foolish thing simply\r\nbecause they are impressed by the present unexpected and apparently\r\nunprecedented phase of the war.\r\n\r\nOr, again, people tell you vaguely that “the question of finance will\r\nend the war,” because they are bewildered by the magnitude of the\r\nfigures of expense, forgetting that the only five things a nation\r\nneeds in order to prosecute war are men, arms, clothing, shelter and\r\nfood, and, these things being provided, the whole hotch-potch of\r\nreality and imagination which is called finance is indifferent to it.\r\n\r\nNow, to prevent false judgments of that kind and the misleading of\r\npublic opinion, there is nothing more useful than to distinguish\r\nbetween the things in which modern war between great forces, fought\r\nwith modern weapons and by men trained to utilize their powers to the\r\nutmost, differs from and resembles the wars of the past.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with the differences.\r\n\r\nWhen you are dealing with many miles of men whose armament is not\r\nonly destructive at a great distance, but also over a wide belt\r\nof ground, you have, in the first place, a vast extension of any\r\npossible defensive lines. It is in this, perhaps, that the present\r\nwar is most sharply distinguished from the wars of the past; and I\r\nmean by the wars of the past the wars of no more than a generation\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThere have been plenty of long defensive lines in the past. Generals\r\ndesiring to remain entirely upon the defensive, for any reason, over\r\nan indefinite space of time (for no one can remain on the defensive\r\nfor ever), have constructed from time immemorial long lines behind\r\nwhich their men, though very thinly spread out, could hold against\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nThey have been particularly led to do this since the introduction of\r\nfirearms, because firearms give the individual man a wider area over\r\nwhich he can stop his enemy. But in every form of war, primitive or\r\nmodern, these great lines have existed.\r\n\r\nThe Wall of China is one great instance of them; the Roman Wall\r\nover the North of Britain, from sea to sea, is another; and the\r\nlong-fortified Roman frontier from the Rhine to the Danube was a\r\nthird.\r\n\r\nThe generals of Louis XIV, in a line called by the now famous name\r\nof La Bassée, established on a smaller scale the same sort of thing\r\nfor a particular campaign. There are hundreds of examples. But the\r\ncharacteristic novelty of the present war, and the point in which it\r\ndiffers from all these ancient examples, is the _rapidity_ with which\r\nsuch lines are established by the great numbers now facing each\r\nother, armed as they are by weapons of very long range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This gives you at a glance an idea of the numbers\r\nengaged and the time occupied in some famous battles of the past.\r\nEach little figure in the above drawings represents 5000 men. It will\r\nbe seen that even the Battle of Mukden is scarcely comparable in\r\nduration with the months-long contests of the present war.]\r\n\r\nForty-eight hours’ preparation, or even less, is enough for troops\r\nto “dig themselves in” over a stretch of country which, in the\r\nmaximum case of the French lines, is 300 miles in extent. Every\r\nslight advance is guaranteed by a new construction of trenches, every\r\nretirement hopes to check the enemy at another line of trenches\r\nestablished at the rear of the first.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, half a million of men could hold one hundred miles\r\nof such a line under modern conditions, and, therefore, when the vast\r\nnumbers which such a campaign as this produces are brought into the\r\nfield, you can establish a line stretching across a whole continent\r\nand incapable of being turned.\r\n\r\nThat is what has been done in France during the present war. You\r\nhave got trenches which, so long as they are sufficiently held in\r\nproportion to the numbers of the offensive, are impregnable, and\r\nwhich run from the Swiss Mountains to the North Sea.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that you may have to-morrow similar lines running from\r\nthe Carpathians to the Baltic. Though this I doubt, first, because in\r\nthe Eastern theatre of war Russia can produce perpetually increasing\r\nnumbers to assault those lines; secondly, because the heavy artillery\r\nessential for their support cannot be present in large numbers in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nOne may sum up, therefore, upon this particular novel feature of the\r\npresent campaign and say that it is mainly due to the very large\r\nnumbers engaged, coupled with the retaining power of the heavy\r\nartillery which the Germans have prepared in such high numerical\r\nsuperiority over their opponents. It is not a feature which you will\r\nnecessarily find reproduced by any means in all the wars, even of the\r\nnear future, or in the later stages of this war.\r\n\r\nYou must be able, as you retreat, to check your enemy appreciably\r\nbefore you can trace such a line; you must be able to hammer him\r\nbadly with heavy guns stronger than his own while you are making it,\r\nand unless you are present in very great numbers you will only be\r\nable to draw it over a comparatively short line which your enemy may\r\nbe able to turn by the left or the right.\r\n\r\nStill, it may be of interest to compare the length of lines thus\r\ndrawn apparently during the course of a campaign in the past with\r\nthose drawn in the course of the present campaign, and in the first\r\ndiagram I show the contrast. It is striking enough.\r\n\r\nAnother novel feature in which this war differs even from the Balkan\r\nWar is the new value which has been given to howitzer fire, and in\r\nparticular to its domination over permanent fortification. This is\r\nperhaps the most important of all the changes which this war has\r\nintroduced into military art and it is worth while understanding it\r\nclearly. Its main principles are simple enough.\r\n\r\nMankind at war has always used devices whereby he has been able with\r\na small number to detain the advance of a larger number. That, for\r\ninstance, was the object of a castle in the Middle Ages. You built a\r\nstronghold of stone which the engines of that time could not batter\r\ndown or undermine save at a very great expense of time, and you\r\nwere certain that for every man able to shoot an arrow from behind\r\nsuch defences ten men or more would be needed for the work of trying\r\nto batter them down. So when you knew that your enemy would have to\r\ngo through a narrow pass in the mountains, let us say, or across an\r\nimportant ford of a river, you built a castle which, as the military\r\nphrase goes, “commanded” that passage; that is, you devised a\r\nstronghold such that with, say, only 1000 of your men you would quite\r\ncertainly hold up 10,000 of your enemy.\r\n\r\nIf your enemy passed by without taking your castle the thousand men\r\ninside could sally out and cut off his supplies as they passed down\r\nthe mountain road or across the ford, and so imperil his main forces\r\nthat had gone forward.\r\n\r\nYour stronghold would never, of course, suffice to win a war--its\r\nfunction was purely negative. You could not attack with it; you could\r\nnot destroy your enemy with it. But you could _gain time_ with it.\r\nYou could check your enemy in his advance while you were gathering\r\nfurther men to meet him, and sometimes you could even wear him out in\r\nthe task of trying to reduce the stronghold.\r\n\r\nNow the whole history of the art of war is a history of the alternate\r\nstrength and weaknesses of these _permanent fortifications_; the\r\nword _permanent_ means fortifications not of a temporary character,\r\nhurriedly set up in the field, but solidly constructed over a long\r\nspace of time, and destined to permit a prolonged resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM I. A striking comparison of the length of\r\nlines in some past campaigns with the present. The characteristic\r\nnovelty of the present war is the rapidity with which such lines are\r\nestablished by the great numbers now facing each other, armed as they\r\nare by weapons of very long range.]\r\n\r\nWhen cannon came and gunpowder for exploding mines underground, the\r\nmediæval castle of stone could be quickly reduced. There was,\r\ntherefore, a phase in which permanent fortification or permanent\r\nworks were at a discount. The wars of Cromwell in this country, for\r\ninstance, were fought in the middle of such a phase. The castles\r\nwent down like nine-pins. But the ingenuity of man discovered a\r\nnew form of defence valuable even against cannon, in the shape of\r\nscientifically constructed _earthworks_. The cannon ball of the day\r\ncould not destroy these works, and though they could be _sapped_\r\nand _mined_, that is, though tunnels could be dug in beneath them\r\nand explosives there fired to their destruction, that was a long\r\nbusiness, and the formation of the works was carefully designed to\r\ngive the garrison a powerful advantage of fire over the besiegers.\r\n\r\nWorks of this kind made the defensive strong again for more than two\r\nhundred years. Just as there used to be a stone wall surrounding\r\na town, at intervals from which people could shoot sideways along\r\nthe “curtain” or sheer wall between the towers, so now there was\r\nearthwork, that is, banks of earth backed by brick walls to hold\r\nthem up, and having a ditch between the outer parapet and the inner.\r\nThese earthworks were star-shaped, sending out a number of projecting\r\nangles, so that an attack launched upon any point would receive\r\nconverging fire from two points of the star, and the entrances were\r\nfurther protected by outer works called horn works.\r\n\r\nWith the war of 1870, and even for somewhat before it, it was found\r\nthat the increased range of modern artillery had destroyed the value\r\nof these star-shaped earthworks, taking the place of the old walls\r\nround a town. One could batter the place to pieces with distant\r\nguns. Though the guns within the place were as strong as the guns\r\noutside, they were at this disadvantage: that they were confined\r\nwithin a comparatively small space which the besiegers could search\r\nby their fire, while the guns of the besiegers could not be equally\r\nwell located by the gunners of the besieged within the fortress.\r\n\r\nSo the next step was to produce what has been known as the _Ring\r\nFortress_. That is, a series of detached forts lying three or four\r\nmiles outside the inner place of stores, barracks, etc., which you\r\nwanted to defend. Each fort supporting the two others next to it on\r\neither side of this ring was thought to be impregnable, for each fort\r\nwas built within range of the two nearest, and on such a model were\r\nbuilt Toul, Verdun, Epinal, Belfort, Metz, Strassburg, Thorn, Cracow,\r\nand fifty other great modern strongholds.\r\n\r\nThe theory that these ring fortresses could hold out indefinitely\r\nwas based upon the idea that the fort so far out from the fortress\r\nwould keep the enemy’s guns too far away to damage the inner\r\nplace of stores and garrison, and that the supporting fire of the\r\nvarious forts would prevent anyone getting between them. The three\r\nsystems--first the stone wall, then the earthwork, then the ring\r\nfortress, are roughly expressed in the second diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM II. Mankind at war has always used devices\r\nwhereby he has been able with a small number to detain the advance\r\nof a larger number. Some of these systems are roughly expressed\r\nabove. 1. The old stone fortress or castle of the Middle Ages. 2.\r\nThe wall round a town. 3. The earthworks of a fortress of the period\r\n1620-1860. 4. The “Ring” Fortress (1860-1914)--a series of detached\r\nforts lying three or four miles outside the inner place of stores,\r\nbarracks, etc., which it was desired to defend.]\r\n\r\nWell, the chief lesson, perhaps, of the present war is that these\r\nring fortresses fall quickly to howitzer fire. Each of the individual\r\nforts can be easily reduced by howitzer fire. This is concentrated\r\nagainst certain of the forts, which quickly fall, and once their\r\nring is broken the result is equivalent to the breach in the wall\r\nof a fortress, and the whole stronghold falls. That is because in\r\nquite recent years two new factors have come in: (1) the mobile heavy\r\nhowitzer; (2) the highest kinds of explosives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM III. A howitzer is a gun with a shorter barrel\r\nthan the ordinary gun, and designed not to shoot its projectile more\r\nor less straight across the earth, as an ordinary gun does, but to\r\nlob it high up so that it falls almost perpendicularly upon its\r\ntarget.]\r\n\r\nA howitzer is a gun with a shorter barrel than the ordinary gun\r\n(and therefore lighter in proportion to the width of the shell, and\r\nso to the amount of the explosive it can fire) and designed not to\r\nshoot its projectile more or less straight across the earth, as an\r\nordinary gun does, but to lob it high up so that it falls more or\r\nless perpendicularly upon its target.\r\n\r\nThus the German 11.2-inch howitzer, of which we have heard so much in\r\nthis war, has a maximum range when it is elevated to 43 degrees, or\r\nvery nearly half-way between pointing flat and pointing straight\r\nup--and howitzers can be fired, of course, at a much higher angle\r\nthan that if necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM IV. You can hide a howitzer behind a hill. The\r\ngun, though it has a longer range than the howitzer, can only get at\r\nthe howitzer indirectly by firing over the point where it supposes\r\nthe howitzer to be, as at A. Secondly, the howitzer can drop its\r\nshell into a comparatively narrow trench which the projectile of the\r\ngun will probably miss.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM V. If you want to make your shell fall into a\r\ntrench of a fortification, A, or come down exactly on the top of the\r\nshelter in a fort, B, it is obvious that your howitzer, firing from\r\nH, and lobbing a projectile along the high-angle trajectory M, will\r\nhave a much better chance of hitting it than your gun G, sending a\r\nprojectile further indeed but along the flatter trajectory N.]\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the howitzer is two-fold.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, you can hide it behind a hill or any other form\r\nof obstacle or screen, as it shoots right up in the air. A gun which\r\nfires more or less flat along the earth cannot get at it.\r\n\r\nThe gun, though it has a longer range than the howitzer, can only get\r\nat the howitzer indirectly by firing over the point where it supposes\r\nthe howitzer to be, as at A in Diagram IV, and so timing the fuse\r\nthat the shell bursts exactly there.\r\n\r\nNow, that is a difficult operation, both because it is difficult to\r\nspot a machine which you cannot see, and though modern time fuses are\r\nvery accurate, they cannot, of course, be accurate to a yard.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the howitzer can drop its shell into a comparatively narrow\r\ntrench, which the projectile of a gun with its flat trajectory will\r\nprobably miss. If you want to make your shell fall into a trench of\r\na fortification or come down exactly on the top of the shelter in a\r\nfort, as at A, the trench in the fifth diagram, or at B, the shelter,\r\nit is obvious that your howitzer firing from H, and lobbing a\r\nprojectile along the high-angle trajectory M, will have a much better\r\nchance of hitting it than your gun G, sending a projectile further,\r\nindeed, but along the flatter trajectory N.\r\n\r\nOf course, another howitzer within the fortifications could, in\r\ntheory, lob a shell of its own over the hill and hit the besieging\r\nhowitzer, but in practice it is very easy for the besieging howitzer\r\nto find out exactly where the vulnerable points of the fortress\r\nare--its trenches and its shelter and magazine--and very difficult\r\nfor the people in the fortress to find out where the howitzer outside\r\nis. Its place is marked upon no map, and it can move about, whereas\r\nthe fortress is fixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM VI. The fort on an elevation at A, and\r\nconfined within a narrow space, is a target for howitzers placed\r\nanywhere behind hills at, say, four miles off--as at B-B, C-C, D-D.\r\nIt is difficult enough for the fort to find out where the howitzer\r\nfires from in any case; furthermore, the howitzer can shift its\r\nposition anywhere along the lines B-B, C-C, and D-D.]\r\n\r\nLook, for instance, at Diagram VI.\r\n\r\nThe fort on an elevation at A, and confined within a narrow space,\r\nis a target for howitzers placed anywhere behind hills at, say, four\r\nmiles off, as at B-B, C-C, D-D. It is difficult enough for the fort\r\nto find out where the howitzer fires from in any case, and even when\r\nit has spotted this the howitzer can move anywhere along the lines\r\nB-B, C-C, or D-D, and shift its position.\r\n\r\nFurther, be it remembered that under quite modern conditions the\r\naccuracy of the howitzer fire against the fort can be checked by\r\naeroplanes circulating above the fort, whereas the fort is a poor\r\nstarting-place for corresponding aeroplanes to discover the howitzer.\r\n\r\nBut while the howitzer has this advantage, it has the grave\r\ndisadvantage of not having anything like the same range as the gun,\r\nsize for size. For a great many years it has been known that the\r\nhowitzer has the advantage I have named. But, in spite of that,\r\npermanent fortification was built and could stand, for it was\r\nimpossible to move howitzers of more than a certain small size.\r\nThe explosives in those small shells did very great damage, but\r\nthe fortress could, with its very heavy guns, keep the enemy out\r\nof range. But when large, and at the same time mobile howitzers\r\nwere constructed which, though they fired shells of a quarter of a\r\nton and more, could go along almost over any ground and be fired\r\nfrom almost anywhere, and moved at comparatively short notice from\r\none place to another, it was another matter. The howitzer became\r\ndangerous to the fortress. When to this was added the new power of\r\nthe high explosives, it became fatal to the fortress.\r\n\r\nTo-day the 11-inch howitzer, with a range of about six miles,\r\ncapable of hiding behind any elevation and not to be discovered by\r\nany gun within the fortress, and, further, capable of being moved\r\nat a moment’s notice if it is discovered, has the fortress at its\r\nmercy. Air reconnaissance directs the fire, and great masses of high\r\nexplosives can be dropped, without serious danger to the besieger,\r\nupon the fortified permanent points, which are unable to elude great\r\nshells of high explosive once the range has been found.\r\n\r\nAnother development of the present war, and somewhat an unexpected\r\none, has been the effect of the machine-gun, and this has depended\r\nas much upon the new German way of handling it behind a screen of\r\ninfantry, which opened to give the machine-gun play, as to any other\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe fourth most obvious, and perhaps most striking change is, of\r\ncourse, the use of aircraft, and here one or two points should be\r\nnoticed which are not always sufficiently emphasized. In the first\r\nplace, the use of aircraft for scouting has given, upon the whole,\r\nmore than was expected of it. It prevents the great concentration of\r\ntroops unknown to the enemy at particular points on a line save in\r\none important exception, which is the movement of troops by night\r\nover railways, and, indeed, this large strategical use of railways,\r\nespecially in night movements, in the present war, is not the least\r\nof the novelties which it has discovered. But, on the other hand,\r\naircraft has reintroduced the importance of weather in a campaign,\r\nand to some extent the importance of the season. When you doubtfully\r\ndiscovered your enemy’s movements by “feeling” him with cavalry\r\nor gathering information from spies and prisoners, it made little\r\ndifference whether the wind was high or low or whether you were in\r\nsummer or in winter. But the airman can only work usefully by day,\r\nand in bad weather or very strong gales he cannot fly, which means\r\nthat unexpected attack is to be dreaded more than ever by night, and\r\nthat for the first time in many centuries the wind has again come to\r\nmake a difference, as it did against the missile of the bow and arrow.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many other novel developments which this war has\r\ndiscovered, but these are, I think, the chief. It is advisable not\r\nonly to discover such novelties, but also the permanent features,\r\nwhich even modern machinery and modern numbers have not changed. Of\r\nthese you have first the elementary feature of _moral_.\r\n\r\nUltimately, all Europeans have much the same potential _moral_.\r\nDifferent types of drill and different experiences in war, a\r\ndifferent choice of leaders and the rest of it produce, however,\r\ndifferent _kinds of moral_; different excellencies and weaknesses.\r\nNow in this department much the most remarkable general discovery\r\nin the war has been the endurance and steadiness under loss of\r\nconscript soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt had always been said during the long peace that modern conscript\r\nshort-service soldiers would never stand the losses their fathers\r\nhad stood in the days of professional armies, or longer service, or\r\nprolonged campaigns such as those of the Napoleonic wars. But to this\r\ntheory the Manchurian campaign gave a sufficient answer if men would\r\nonly have heeded it; the Balkan War a still stronger one, while the\r\npresent war leaves no doubt upon the matter.\r\n\r\nThe short-service conscript army has in this matter done better than\r\nanything that was known in the past. Of particular reasons perhaps\r\nthe most interesting and unexpected has been the double surprise in\r\nthe German use of close formation. It was always taken for granted,\r\nboth by the German school and by their opponents, that close\r\nformation, if it could be used in the field at all, would, by its\r\nrapidity and weight, carry everything before it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM VII. You have here 1000 men ready to attack.\r\nIf they attack in long open waves of men as at A-A, it takes them a\r\nlong time to spread out, and when they are spread out the effect of\r\ntheir shock is not overwhelming.]\r\n\r\nYou have in Diagram VII a thousand men ready to attack. If they\r\nattack in long open waves of men as at A-A, it takes them a long time\r\nto spread out, and when they are spread out the effect of their shock\r\nis not overwhelming. They can only succeed by wave following wave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM VIII. If your 1000 men attack in denser bodies\r\nas at B-B, they can be launched much more quickly, and the effect of\r\ntheir shock when they come on is much greater.]\r\n\r\nIf they attack in denser bodies (Diagram VIII), as at B-B, they can\r\nbe launched much more quickly, and the effect of their shock when\r\nthey come on is much greater; it is, to use the German’s own term,\r\nthe effect of a swarm.\r\n\r\nThis seemed obvious, but the critics of the second system of close\r\nor swarm formation always said that, though they admitted its\r\nenormous power if it could be used at all, it could not be used\r\nbecause its losses would be so enormous against modern firearms.\r\nYour spread-out line, as at A-A, offered but a small target, and the\r\nnumber of men hit during an assault would be far less than the number\r\nhit in the assault of such bodies as B-B, which presented a full\r\ntarget of dense masses.\r\n\r\nWell, in the event, that criticism proved wrong in _both_ its\r\nconceptions. The Germans, thanks to their great courage and excellent\r\ndiscipline, _have_ been able to use close formations. The immense\r\nlosses these occasion have not prevented their continuous presence\r\nin the field, but, contrary to all expectations, they have not, as a\r\nrule, got home. In other words, they have, in the main, failed in the\r\nvery object for which the heavy sacrifice they entail was permitted.\r\n\r\nAnother unexpected thing in which this war has warranted the old\r\nconception of arms is the exactitude of provision. Everybody thought\r\nthat there would be a great novelty in this respect, and that the\r\nprovisioning of so many men might break down, or, at any rate, hamper\r\ntheir mobility. So far from this being the case, the new great armies\r\nof this modern war have been better and more regularly provisioned\r\nthan were the armies of the past, and this is particularly true upon\r\nthe side of the Allies, even in the case of that astonishing march of\r\nthree million of Russians across Poland with the roads in front of\r\nthem destroyed and the railway useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TO BELIEVE IN WAR NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Showing how the reports in the Press should be selected and\r\ncompared, so as to arrive at a just estimate of the true position of\r\naffairs._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TO BELIEVE IN WAR NEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day there came a message to London from Italy, solemnly\r\ndelivered in printer’s ink and repeated in nearly every newspaper,\r\nthat the town of Cracow was invested, that the bombardment had begun,\r\nand that part of the city was in flames.\r\n\r\nCracow is the key of Silesia, and Silesia is the Lancashire of\r\nPrussia. The successful investment of Cracow would certainly bring\r\nthe war to its last phase, and that phase one bringing rapid victory\r\nto the Allies.\r\n\r\nBut Cracow was not invested; no one had bombarded it. The whole thing\r\nwas fantastic nonsense.\r\n\r\nSo much for one particular newspaper report, which had nothing to\r\ndistinguish it from other telegrams and news, and which millions of\r\npeople must have read and believed.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the readers of these lines will be able to recall other\r\ninstances of the same kind. I have before me as I write extract after\r\nextract of that sort. In one, Roulers has been retaken; in another,\r\nLille is reoccupied; in another (a much earlier one), the Germans are\r\nat Pont Oise.\r\n\r\nSometimes these accounts appear in long and detailed descriptions\r\nproceeding from the pens of men who are fairly well known in Fleet\r\nStreet, and who have the courage to sign their names.\r\n\r\nThere has, perhaps, never been a great public occasion in regard to\r\nwhich it was more necessary that men should form a sound judgment,\r\nand yet there has certainly not been one in our time upon which the\r\nmaterials for such a judgment have been more confused.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a sound public judgment upon the progress of the\r\nwar is not always clearly appreciated. It depends upon truths which\r\nmany men have forgotten, and upon certain political forces which,\r\nin the ordinary rush and tumble of professional politics, are quite\r\nforgotten. Let me recall those truths and those forces.\r\n\r\nThe truths are these: that no Government can effectively exercise\r\nits power save upon the basis of public opinion. A Government can\r\nexercise its power over a conquered province in spite of public\r\nopinion, but it cannot work, save for a short time and at an enormous\r\ncost in friction, counter to the opinion of those with whom it is\r\nconcerned as citizens and supporters. By which I do not mean that\r\nparty politicians cannot act thus in peace, and upon unimportant\r\nmatters. I mean that no kind of Government has ever been able to act\r\nthus in a crisis.\r\n\r\nIt is also wise to keep the mass of people in ignorance of disasters\r\nthat may be immediately repaired, or of follies or even vices in\r\ngovernment which may be redressed before they become dangerous.\r\n\r\nIt is always absolutely wise to prevent the enemy in time of war from\r\nlearning things which would be an aid to him. That is the reason\r\nwhy a strict censorship in time of war is not only useful, but\r\nessentially and drastically necessary. But though public opinion,\r\neven in time of peace, is only in part informed, and though in time\r\nof war it may be very insufficiently informed, yet upon it and with\r\nit you govern. Without it or against it in time of war you cannot\r\ngovern.\r\n\r\nNow if during the course of a great war men come quite to misjudge\r\nits very nature, the task of the Government would be strained\r\nsome time or other in the future to breaking point. False news,\r\ntoo readily credited, does not leave people merely insufficiently\r\ninformed, conscious of their ignorance, and merely grumbling because\r\nthey cannot learn more, it has the positive effect of putting them\r\ninto the wrong frame of mind, of making them support what they should\r\nnot support, and neglect what they should not neglect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, public authority, which possesses and rightfully\r\nexercises so much power in the way of censorship--that is, in the\r\nway of limiting information--has little power to correct false\r\ninformation. The Censor receives a message, saying that at the\r\nexpense of heavy loss General So-and-So’s brigade, composed of the\r\nDownshires and the Blankshires, repelled the enemy upon such-and-such\r\na front, but that three hundred men are missing from the brigade at\r\nthe end of the action. If he allows this piece of news to go through\r\nat all he must even so refuse to allow any mention of the names\r\nof the regiments, of their strength, of the place where they were\r\nfighting, and the numbers of those who are missing.\r\n\r\nWhy must the Censor act thus? Because this information would be of\r\nthe utmost value to the enemy. The enemy, remember, does not ever\r\nquite know what is in front of him. Indeed, the whole of military\r\nhistory consists in the story of men who are successful because they\r\ncan gauge better than other men the forces which they have to meet.\r\n\r\nNow if you let him know that on such-and-such an occasion the force\r\nthat he met upon such-and-such a front was a brigade of infantry, and\r\nif you let him know its composition, and if you do this kind of thing\r\nwith regard to the army in general, you end by letting him know two\r\nthings which he particularly wants to know, and which it is all your\r\nduty to prevent him knowing. You let him know the size of the force\r\nin front of him, and you let him know its composition.\r\n\r\nSimilar reasons make the Censor hide from the enemy the number of men\r\nmissing. The enemy knows if he has taken in prisoners wounded and\r\nunwounded two hundred and fifty men, and, for all he knows, that is,\r\nexcepting the dead, your total loss; but if you publish the fact that\r\nyou have lost a thousand men, he is accurately informed of a weakness\r\nin your present disposition, which he otherwise would not suspect.\r\n\r\nAll this action of the Censor is as wise as it is necessary, but in\r\nthe face of false news he is in another position. In the first place,\r\nit is difficult for him to judge it (unless, of course, it concerns\r\nour own particular forces). In the second place, it may not concern\r\nmatters which the enemy can possibly ignore. For instance, in this\r\nexample of the supposed investment of Cracow. The Russians were\r\ncertainly approaching the place. The news might conceivably be true.\r\nIf it were true, the enemy would already be amply acquainted with it,\r\nand it would be of a nature not to aid him, but to discourage him.\r\nBut the news was, in fact, untrue, and, being untrue, its publication\r\ndid not a little harm.\r\n\r\nNow, how are we to counter this danger? How is the plain man to\r\ndistinguish in his news of the war what is true from what is false,\r\nand so arrive at a sound opinion? After some months of study in\r\nconnexion with my work upon the three campaigns, I may be able to\r\nsuggest certain ways in which such a position should be approached.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the bases of all sound opinion are the official\r\ncommuniqués read with the aid of a map.\r\n\r\nWhen I say “the official communiqués” I do not mean those of the\r\nBritish Government alone, nor even of the Allies alone, but of _all_\r\nthe belligerents. You must read impartially the communiqués of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian and of the German Governments together with those\r\nof the British Government and its Allies, or you will certainly miss\r\nthe truth. By which statement I do not mean that each Government\r\nis equally accurate, still less equally full in its relation; but\r\nthat, unless you compare all the statements of this sort, you will\r\nhave most imperfect evidence; just as you would have very imperfect\r\nevidence in a court of law if you only listened to the prosecution\r\nand refused to listen to the defence. Now, these official communiqués\r\nhave certain things in common by whatever Government they are issued.\r\nThere are certain features in them which you will always find\r\nalthough they come from natures as different as those of a Prussian\r\nstaff officer and a Serbian patriot.\r\n\r\nThese common features we may tabulate thus:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Places named as occupied by the forces of the\r\n  Government in question are really occupied. To invent the\r\n  occupation of a town or point not in one’s own hands would\r\n  serve no purpose. It would not deceive the enemy and it\r\n  would not long support opinion at home. Thus, when Lodz was\r\n  reported occupied by the Germans in the middle of December,\r\n  all careful students of the war knew perfectly well that\r\n  the news was true.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Numbers, when they are quoted in connexion with a\r\n  really ascertainable fact, and with regard to a precise\r\n  and concrete circumstance, are nearly always reliable;\r\n  though their significance differs, as I shall show in\r\n  a moment, very greatly according to the way they are\r\n  treated. Thus, if a Government says, “in such-and-such a\r\n  place or on such-and-such a day we took three thousand\r\n  prisoners,” it is presumably telling the truth, for the\r\n  enemy who has lost those prisoners knows it as well as\r\n  they do. But estimates of what has happened in the way of\r\n  numbers, where the Government issuing the estimate can have\r\n  no direct knowledge, are quite another matter. These are\r\n  only gathered from prisoners or from spies, and are often\r\n  ridiculously wrong.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) All official communiqués of whatever Government\r\n  conceal reverses, save in minor points. They are wise to do\r\n  this because there is no need to tell the enemy more than\r\n  he may know of his own success. Reverses are not actually\r\n  denied. They are omitted. Witness all omission of Lemberg\r\n  from Austrian or German communiqués and, until somewhat\r\n  late, of Tannenberg in Russian, of Metz in French official\r\n  accounts.\r\n\r\nThose are the three points which all the official communiqués have\r\nin common, and by bearing them well in mind we can often frame\r\nan accurate picture, in spite of the apparent contradiction and\r\nconfusion which the reading of several communiqués one after the\r\nother produces.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the Germans are trying to cross the Bzura River\r\naccording to the Russian communiqué of Saturday. Next Wednesday\r\nthe Russian communiqué says, “Two attempts to cross the Bzura at\r\nsuch-and-such places were repelled”; while the German communication\r\nsays, “Our troops succeeded in crossing the Bzura River at\r\nsuch-and-such a village and established themselves upon the right\r\nbank.” In such a case the reader will be wise to believe the German\r\ncommuniqué and to take it for granted that while the Russians have\r\nrepelled certain other attempts of the enemy to cross, this attempt\r\nhas succeeded. But if the Germans go on to say, “The Russians retired\r\nafter suffering losses which cannot have been less than twenty\r\nthousand,” that is no news at all. It is obviously conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe various Governments issuing the communiqués have acquired certain\r\nhabits in them which are worth noting if one is attempting to get\r\nat an accurate view of the war, and these habits may be briefly\r\ndescribed as follows:\r\n\r\nThe British Government publishes short notes of advances made or of\r\npositions maintained, but very rarely refers to the losing of ground.\r\nIt publishes casualty lists, which are, of course, not complete till\r\nvery long after the events wherein the casualties were incurred.\r\nIt supplements the short communiqués, and this by a more or less\r\nexpanded narrative written by an official deputed for that purpose\r\nand giving accounts, often graphic, but necessarily of no military\r\nvalue; of no value, that is, for following the campaign. For if these\r\nnarratives were of that kind the object of the censorship would be\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Government at the beginning of the war allowed very full\r\naccounts to go through and permitted the presence of correspondents\r\nat the front itself. That phase is now over and does not immediately\r\nconcern us.\r\n\r\nThe French Government is by far the most reticent. It occasionally\r\nmentions the capture of a colour, but it publishes no casualty lists,\r\nno account of the field guns taken by French troops, and only now\r\nand then hints at the number of prisoners. It is, however, minutely\r\naccurate and even detailed in helping us to locate the fluctuations\r\nof the front, and by the aid of the French communiqués we can follow\r\nthe war upon the map better than by the aid of any other. In its\r\ncontrol of the Press the French General Staff is absolute. There has\r\nbeen nothing like it before, and it has been perfectly successful.\r\nYou will see whole columns cut out of the newspapers in France and\r\nleft blank, so certain are the military authorities of that country\r\nthat the most vigorous censorship is vital to modern war. There\r\nis lastly to be noted in connexion with the French communiqués,\r\nespecially after the first two months of the campaign, a remarkable\r\nfrankness with regard to the occasional giving of ground by their\r\nown troops. The theory is that the enemy will know this in any case,\r\nand that as the position is secure, details of the sort though\r\nadverse, lend strength to the general narrative. In all this it must\r\nbe remembered, of course, that the French Government, and, at this\r\nmoment, the French Army, is far more powerful than any newspaper\r\nproprietor or other capitalist, and it is well for any nation at war\r\nto be able to say that.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Government is accurate, and, if anything, a little too\r\nterse in what it communicates to the public, but its censorship is\r\nfar less strict than that of the French or even the English. Thus\r\nduring the fighting round Lodz in defence of Warsaw at the beginning\r\nof December, correspondents from Petrograd were allowed to telegraph\r\nthe most flamboyant descriptions of an immediately approaching German\r\nretreat which never took place. But, I repeat, the official Russian\r\nnews is sober and restrained and accurate to a fault.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the enemy’s communiqués, we note first that the\r\nAustro-Hungarians are rare, insufficient, and confused. They are of\r\nlittle service, and may almost be neglected. But the German ones are\r\nnumerous, extended and precise, and it is our particular business\r\nto judge them accurately if we are to understand the war, for when\r\nor if they tell the truth it is from them that we learn what would\r\notherwise be hidden.\r\n\r\nWell, in my judgment, these official German communiqués are in\r\nthe main remarkably exact, and I believe it is possible to say why\r\nthey are so exact. The German General Staff makes war in a purely\r\nmechanical fashion. It gravely exaggerates, as do all modern North\r\nGermans, the calculable element in human affairs. It is what used to\r\nbe called “scientific.” It is obvious that if you get a reputation\r\nfor exactitude your falsehood, where it pays you to tell the\r\nfalsehood, will be the more likely to work. The remarkable general\r\naccuracy of the official German communiqués cannot be due to any\r\nother object. It cannot be due to a mere love of truth, for the same\r\nGovernment deliberately circulates to its own provincial Press and\r\nto certain neutrals stories which cannot in the nature of things\r\nbe true. Nor is this inaccuracy the result either of haste or of\r\nstupidity, it is very intelligent and obviously deliberate.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, a German communiqué tells an untruth, that untruth\r\nis deliberate and upon an effective scale, and we have to consider\r\nwhat object it has, if we are to understand the news. We may take it\r\nthat the object is nearly always domestic and political. Remember\r\nthat these official German falsehoods, countersigned by the General\r\nStaff and the Government, are as rare as they are solid. They do not\r\nslip in. They are not vague or led up to by doubtful phrases.\r\n\r\nLet me take two of them. Scarborough was officially described as a\r\nfortified port, like Sheerness or Cherbourg. That takes one’s breath\r\naway. But monstrous as it is, it is not childish, because it was\r\nintended to give to the public that read it at home a certain effect\r\nwhich was, in fact, produced.\r\n\r\nSo successfully was that effect produced that a competent military\r\ncritic in the German Press, writing the day after, had already got\r\nthe idea that Scarborough was the most important naval base upon the\r\nEast Coast. We must remember when we read such things that very few\r\neducated men out of a thousand in our own country could give the\r\nnames of the fortified naval bases upon, say, the Adriatic, or even\r\nthe Atlantic coast of France.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the same thing in a rather different line is\r\nthe illumination of Berlin, the giving of a holiday to the school\r\nchildren and the official proclamation of a great and decisive\r\nvictory in Poland during the course of the second battle for Warsaw,\r\nan action which had already lasted a fortnight, which was destined\r\nto last for many more days, and which remained at that time utterly\r\nundecided.\r\n\r\nAccording to fairly reliable accounts of what was passing in Berlin\r\nat the moment, the Government was under some necessity of acting thus\r\nbecause the beginning of popular unrest had appeared. But whatever\r\nthe cause, my point is that these German inaccuracies when they\r\noccur, which is rarely, are easily distinguishable. They stand out\r\nfrom the rest of the sober narrative by their conspicuous nonsense.\r\nThey do not disturb the judgment of a careful reader. They should not\r\nprevent our continuing to collate most closely German statements in\r\ndetail with those of the Allies, if we wish to understand the war.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which I have already alluded to briefly, in\r\nwhich German communiqués may mislead, and that is in the way they\r\nhandle statistics. The actual wording of news is often chosen in\r\norder to deceive, although the figures may be accurate. For instance,\r\nunder the title “prisoners,” the Germans include all wounded men\r\npicked up, all civilians which in this singular war are carried away\r\ninto captivity, and, probably, when it is to their interest to swell\r\nthe number of captured, they include certain numbers of the dead.\r\nIn the same way they will talk of the capture of Verdun, and not\r\ninfrequently include such of their own pieces as a re-advance has\r\nrediscovered upon the field.\r\n\r\nIt may be added in conclusion that while German communiqués rarely\r\nwander into conjecture, when they do they are idiotic, and exactly\r\nthe same reason made German diplomats wholly misunderstand the\r\nmind of Europe immediately before the war. A German induction\r\nupon something other than material elements is worthless, and you\r\nsee it nowhere more than in the careful but often useless, though\r\nmonumental, work of German historians, who will accumulate a mass\r\nof facts greater in number than those of the scholars of any other\r\nnation, and then will draw a conclusion quite shamefully absurd;\r\nconclusions which, during the last forty years, have usually been\r\nfollowed by the dons of our own universities.\r\n\r\nThere is one last element for the formation of a sound opinion on\r\nthe war which must be mentioned at the end of this, and that is\r\nthe private evidence which occasionally but rarely comes through.\r\nHere there is no guide but that of one’s own experience in travel,\r\nor that of one’s own knowledge of the newspaper or the authority\r\nprinting it. The occasions upon which such evidence is available\r\nare very infrequent, but when they do come the evidence is far more\r\nvaluable than any official communiqué Let me quote as an example\r\nthe letters from Hungary which appeared in the _Morning Post_ upon\r\nvarious occasions during the autumn and early winter. They were quite\r\ninvaluable.\r\n\r\nLastly, one might add for those who have the leisure and the\r\nconfidence, the use of the foreign Press--especially the French and\r\nthe German. It is biased, as is our own, and often belated in news.\r\nThe German Press in particular suffers from the calculated policy of\r\nthe Government of the German Empire, which at this moment believes it\r\nto be of service to stimulate public confidence of victory in every\r\npossible manner. Nevertheless, unless you do follow fairly regularly\r\nthe Press of _all_ the belligerent nations, you will obtain but an\r\nimperfect view of the war as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE WAR HAS TAUGHT US\r\n\r\n\r\n_Many theories formulated in times of peace have crumbled in the face\r\nof recent actualities. Herein are set forth the main lessons to be\r\nlearnt from the present war._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE WAR HAS TAUGHT US\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POINTS AT ISSUE\r\n\r\nLong periods of peace, intervening between cycles of war, are\r\nnecessarily periods during which there must arise a mass of theory\r\nconcerning the way in which men will be affected by war when it\r\nbreaks out. They are necessarily periods in which are perfected\r\nweapons, the actual effect of which upon the human mind has not been\r\ntested. They are necessarily periods in which are perfected methods\r\nof defence, the efficiency of which against the corresponding weapons\r\nof offence remains a matter of doubt.\r\n\r\nMore than this, the whole business of naval and military strategy,\r\nthough its fundamental rules remain unaltered, is affected by the use\r\nof new materials upon the full character of which men cannot finally\r\ndecide until they come to action.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it is but a short while ago that a very eminent naval\r\nauthority in this country put forward a defence of the submarine.\r\nThis novel weapon had not been effectively used in war, though it\r\nhas existed for so many years. He suggested that in the next naval\r\nwar the battleship and cruiser would be rendered useless by the\r\nsubmarine, which would dominate all naval fighting.\r\n\r\nHis theory, which, of course, was only a theory, was very warmly\r\ncontested. But between the two “schools” at issue nothing could\r\ndecide but actual warfare at sea in which the submarine was used.\r\n\r\nThis necessary presence of rival “schools of thought” upon naval\r\nand military matters is particularly emphasized when the progress\r\nof invention is rapid, combined with the gradual perfecting of\r\nmechanical methods, and when the peace has been a long one.\r\n\r\nBoth these conditions have been present in Europe as a whole, and\r\nparticularly in Western Europe, during our generation, and that is\r\nwhy this war has already taught so many lessons to those who study\r\nmilitary and naval affairs, and why already it has settled so many\r\ndisputed points.\r\n\r\nManœuvres could tell one much, but there was always absent from them\r\nthe prime factor of fear, and that next factor almost as important,\r\nof actual destruction.\r\n\r\nThe list of questions, detailed and general, which have already\r\nbeen wholly or partly answered by the present campaigns might be\r\nindefinitely extended. There are hundreds of them. But if we consider\r\nonly the principal ones we shall find that they fall roughly into\r\ntwo main categories. You have the technical questions of armament,\r\nits use and its effect; formation, and so forth; and you have the\r\npolitical questions.\r\n\r\nThe first set are concerned with the action of human beings under\r\nparticular forms of danger, and the physical effect of the weapons\r\nthey will employ under the conditions of a high civilization.\r\n\r\nThe second set are concerned with the action of human beings as\r\ncitizens, not as soldiers. How they will face the advent of war,\r\nwhether national feeling will be stronger than class feeling, whether\r\nsecrecy can be preserved, and the rest.\r\n\r\nA list of the principal points in each of these sets will run\r\nsomewhat as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the first there were opposing schools as to--\r\n\r\n(1) The value of modern permanent fortification and its power of\r\nresistance to a modern siege train.\r\n\r\n(2) The best formation in which to organize troops for action, and\r\nparticularly the quarrel between close formation and open.\r\n\r\n(3) The doubts as to the degree of reliance which could be placed\r\nupon air-scouts, their capacity for engaging one another, the\r\nqualities that would give dominion of the air, and in particular the\r\nvalue of the great modern dirigible balloons.\r\n\r\n(4) The effect, method, and proportionate value of rifle fire and of\r\nthe bayonet.\r\n\r\n(5) The use of field artillery; and particularly whether, after a\r\ncertain degree of rapidity, still greater rapidity of fire was worth\r\nhaving.\r\n\r\n(6) The exact _rôle_ that would be played in modern war by the supply\r\nof certain materials hitherto unimportant and discoverable only\r\nin certain limited regions, most of them out of Europe. There are\r\na great number of these materials, but much the most important is\r\npetrol.\r\n\r\n(7) Lastly, and by far the most vital of purely technical questions\r\nto this country, was the solution of certain opposing theories upon\r\nwhat is rather rhetorically called “the command of the sea” and what\r\nmight more justly be called naval superiority.\r\n\r\nIn the second set, the political questions, the most important were:\r\n\r\n(1) The working of the conscript and of the voluntary systems.\r\n\r\n(2) The possibility of preserving secrecy.\r\n\r\n(3) Whether mobilization would work smoothly or not in the face of\r\nclass struggles supposedly formidable to national interests.\r\n\r\n(4) The action of our modern town populations under the moral strain\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS WE HAVE LEARNT\r\n\r\nNot all of the questions, military or political, have as yet been\r\nsolved by experience. Many of them are, however, already partially\r\nsolved, some wholly solved. And we may consider them usefully one by\r\none.\r\n\r\n(1) The value of permanent fortification.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking lesson of the war, and the one which\r\nis already conclusively taught by its progress, is the fact that\r\nmodern permanent works, as we have hitherto known them at least, are\r\ndominated by modern siege artillery, and in particular by the mobile\r\nlarge howitzer using the last form of high explosive. It is here\r\nimportant to give the plain facts upon a matter which has from its\r\nsuddenness and dramatic character given birth to a good many lessons.\r\n\r\nModern fortification has gone down after a very short resistance\r\nto howitzer fire, throughout the western field of the campaign. In\r\ngeneral, if you can get the big, modern, mobile howitzer up to\r\nstriking distance of modern permanent work, it batters that work to\r\npieces within a period which will hardly extend over a week, and may\r\nbe as short as forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nIt is not a question of tenacity or courage. The greatest tenacity\r\nand the greatest courage can do nothing with a work that has been\r\nreduced to ruins, and in which there is no emplacement for a gun. So\r\nmuch is quite certain. But we must not run away with the idea either\r\nthat this is the end of fortification for the future; temporary\r\nmobile batteries established _outside_ the old permanent works will\r\nshield a garrison for an indefinite time. Nor is it true that the\r\nGermans have in this field any particular advantage save over the\r\nRussians, who are weak in their heavy artillery and have limited\r\npowers of increasing it. It will be discovered as the war proceeds\r\nthat the Western armies are here in the same boat with the Germans.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Germans have a larger howitzer than the French\r\nand the English. They have a few 420 millimetre howitzers, that\r\nis, guns of a calibre between 16 and 17 inches. But this gun is\r\nalmost too large to use. What has done the work everywhere is the\r\n11-inch howitzer, and a gun of much the same size is in possession\r\nof the French. Only hitherto the siege work has fallen to the German\r\ninvaders. When and if the _rôles_ are reversed, German permanent work\r\nwill be just as vulnerable to French howitzer fire. And as for the\r\nabolition of fortification in future we need not look for that.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the system of large, permanent enclosed works\r\nwill give way to a system of narrow, prepared, parallel trenches\r\nconnected by covered ways, which, by offering too small a target for\r\naccurate fire from a distance, and by being doubled and redoubled one\r\nbehind the other, will be able to hold out far longer than the larger\r\nworks which bore the brunt of the present war. But that the defensive\r\nwill devise some means of meeting the new and unexpected powers of\r\nthe offensive we may be certain, upon the analogy of all past warfare.\r\n\r\n(2) In the matter of formation the surprise of the war has\r\nundoubtedly been the success of another German theory, to wit, the\r\npossibility of leading modern short-trained troops, against enormous\r\nlosses, in close formation. Everywhere outside Germany that was\r\ndoubted, and the Germans have proved that their initial contention\r\nwas right, at least in their own case. But there is another aspect\r\nof this question which has as yet by no means been proved one way or\r\nthe other, and that is, whether the very heavy losses this use of\r\nclose formation entails are worth while in a campaign not immediately\r\nsuccessful at the outset. We are not yet able to say how far troops\r\nonce submitted to such violence can be brought to suffer it again--or\r\nhow long after--nor are we able to say what effect this lavish\r\nexpenditure of men has towards the end of a campaign if its primary\r\nobject, immediate initial success, fails.\r\n\r\n(3) In the matter of aircraft, four things have come out already.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Men will engage each other in the air without fear and they\r\nwill do so continually, appalling as the prospect seemed in its\r\nnovelty before the outbreak of this war.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Aircraft can discover the movement of troops in large bodies\r\nmore accurately and successfully than had been imagined.\r\n\r\n(_c_) That body of aircraft which is used to a rougher climate, and\r\nto working in heavier winds, will have an immense advantage not only\r\nin bad weather but in all weather. It is this, coupled with a very\r\nfine and already established tradition of adventure, which has made\r\nthe English airmen easily the superior of their Allies and enemies.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The aeroplane is neither as invulnerable at a great height as\r\none school imagined it, nor as vulnerable as the opposite school\r\nmaintained. The casualties are not as high in proportion to the\r\nnumbers engaged as they would be in any other arm--at least so\r\nfar--but they exist. And it would seem that the impossibility of\r\ntelling whether an aeroplane belongs to friend or foe is a serious\r\naddition to the risk.\r\n\r\nMany questions connected with aircraft still remain to be solved; by\r\nfar the most important of which to this country are connected with\r\nthe efficiency of the dirigible balloon.\r\n\r\n(4) The amount of attention that should be given to good rifle firing\r\nand the importance that should be attached to the bayonet seem both\r\nto have been answered hitherto by the war.\r\n\r\nSuperior rifle fire, especially under the conditions of a difficult\r\ndefensive, was the saving of the British force during the retreat\r\nfrom Mons, and, during the whole battle of the Marne, French accounts\r\nagree that the bayonet was the deciding factor in action after\r\naction. But even if it be true, in the words of a French officer,\r\nthat “all actions end with the bayonet,” the actual number of troops\r\nthus engaged and the casualties connected with them, are not in a\r\nvery high proportion to the whole.\r\n\r\nIt almost seems as though the bayonet had replaced the old shock\r\naction of cavalry in some degree, and that it was to be used only\r\nwhen the opposing troops were shaken or were occupied in too\r\nprecipitate a retirement. Of successful bayonet work against other\r\nconditions we have at least had no examples recorded.\r\n\r\n(5) On the two chief points in connexion with field artillery,\r\nrecords hitherto received tell us little. We shall not know until\r\nmore detailed accounts are available whether the vastly superior\r\nrapidity of fire enjoyed by the French 75 millimetre gun has given it\r\na corresponding superiority over its opponent, the German 77. That it\r\nhas a superiority is fairly clear. The degree of that superiority we\r\nshall not learn until we have the story of the war from the German\r\nside.\r\n\r\nNeither are we established upon the question of weight. General\r\nLanglois’ theory, which convinced the French that the light gun\r\nwas essential, has not so far been proved absolutely certain, and\r\nthere have been occasions when the English heavier gun (notably at\r\nMeaux) was of vast importance to our Allies. But I suggest that this\r\nquestion will be better answered now the weather has changed. In\r\ndry weather, that is, over hard ground, the difference between the\r\nheavier and the lighter gun is not so noticeable; once the ground is\r\nheavy it becomes very noticeable indeed.\r\n\r\n(6) With the next question, that of the materials and their supply,\r\nwe enter a region of the utmost interest to this country in\r\nparticular, because it is the superiority of this country at sea, and\r\nthe almost complete blockade of the Germanic Powers, that is here\r\nconcerned. Roughly speaking, we find (_a_) That a blockade of enemy\r\nports from a great distance is easy; (_b_) of enemy supply _through\r\nneutrals_ very difficult indeed; (_c_) That certain special products\r\nwhich modern science has made necessary in war are most affected. For\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nOf the many things a modern army requires which are to be found only\r\nin a few special places, and those, most of them, out of Europe,\r\nthe most important of all is petrol. It is obviously of capital\r\nimportance for air work, and where you have a number of good roads,\r\nas in the Western field of operations, it is almost as important for\r\ntransport work.\r\n\r\nNow it so happens that petrol is not found in Western Europe at\r\nall. The European supply as a whole is limited, and is in the main\r\nconfined to Galicia, Roumania, and Russia. The Asiatic and American\r\nsupply is only available to Austria-Hungary and Germany by way of the\r\nocean, and the ocean is closed to them. Russian supply, of course,\r\nthey cannot obtain. Galician supply swings back and forth now in the\r\npossession of the Austrian and now in that of the Russian Army.\r\n\r\nThere remains only Roumania, and though Roumania is neutral it is\r\ndoubtful or rather nearly certain that no sufficient supplies are\r\ncoming into the Germanic Powers from that source. This is up to the\r\nmoment of writing the chief effect of the British naval superiority,\r\nto which I will next turn.\r\n\r\n(7) Most of the things that were said in time of peace about the\r\neffect of naval superiority or “command of the sea” have proved true.\r\nThe blockade of the inferior naval powers is nearly complete--though\r\nit must be remembered that they have an exceedingly limited\r\ncoastline, and that the problem will be very different against a\r\nlarge fleet possessed of many ports upon an extended coastline.\r\n\r\nFurther, the submarine has not proved itself as formidable against\r\nmen-of-war as some thought, and the superiority of large craft is\r\nstill admitted. On the other hand, it has been shown that a few\r\nhostile cruisers could continue to hold the seas for a much longer\r\nperiod than was imagined, and permanently to threaten commerce.\r\n\r\nThe conception that almost immediately after a declaration of war\r\nnaval superiority would prevent the inferior naval power from\r\ncommerce destroying, and that the trade routes of the superior power\r\nwould be as safe as in time of peace has broken down. So has the idea\r\nthat submarines could seek out the enemy’s fleet in its ports and\r\ndestroy them there.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL RESULTS\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the political questions which the war has solved we\r\nhave obtained immediate results of the very highest interest and\r\nimportance, particularly to England.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we have found that while the conscript system\r\nof war worked and mobilized with astonishing success, our own much\r\nmore doubtful dependence upon a voluntary system for prolonged\r\nwarfare has not betrayed this country. Everyone is agreed that the\r\nresponse to the call for volunteers, upon which there was at first\r\ngreat and legitimate anxiety, has been quite out of proportion to our\r\nexpectations, and particularly to those of our enemies.\r\n\r\nI think it true to say that there is nothing in which the German\r\nestimate of British psychology has been more hopelessly at sea than\r\nin this; and that the effects of this exceedingly rapid and large\r\nvoluntary enlistment, principally drawn from the best material in\r\nthe country, is the chief uncalculated factor in the scheme of what\r\nGermany expected to face. It is a factor that matures more slowly\r\nthan many of the others, more slowly, perhaps, even than the effect\r\nof the blockade (which is also due to British effort), but it will\r\nmature with sufficient rapidity to affect all the later, and what may\r\neasily be the decisive, phases of the great war.\r\n\r\nWe have an equally direct answer to that hitherto quite uncertain\r\nquestion, whether in a modern state the secrecy which is essential\r\nto the success of a military plan could be maintained or no. Here\r\nagain there has been a complete surprise. No one could have suggested\r\nsix months ago that so news-tight a system could possibly have been\r\nworked with populations living in the modern great towns. And here\r\nit must be admitted that our opponents have done even better than\r\nourselves. There is almost a comic element in the complete security\r\nwith which the German and Austrian Governments can give those whom\r\nthey govern exactly what news they choose and forbid the least scrap\r\ncorrecting or amplifying these meagre official statements, to pass\r\nthe frontiers.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this we should note that there is at the time of\r\nwriting no definite answer to that very important question of how a\r\ncomplex modern town population will stand a heavy moral strain. But\r\nin so far as the indirect strain already caused by the war is any\r\ngauge, the answer seems to be favourable to the modern town liver.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important point of all among the political questions\r\nwhich the war has propounded is that connected with class as against\r\nnational feeling.\r\n\r\nIn plain fact, the idea that class feeling would anywhere in Europe\r\nbe stronger than national feeling has proved utterly wanting.\r\n\r\nIn the industrial parts of Germany where the distinction of\r\ncapitalist and proletariat was so clearly marked, that distinction\r\nhad no effect whatsoever, not only upon mobilization, but upon the\r\nspirit of the troops; _a fortiori_ it had none in that French society\r\nwhich is leavened by its peasantry, or in Russia which is almost\r\nwholly a peasant state.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing on which the judgment of an educated man would have\r\nproved more at sea had it been taken before the war broke out, and\r\nnothing in which the war has more poignantly revealed the ancient\r\nfoundations upon which Europe reposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALLANTYNE PRESS: LONDON AND EDINBURGH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Two Maps of Europe, by Hilaire Belloc",
