TOWNER\r\n  _Massachusetts Institute of Technology_\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n  _Published by_\r\n  THE OLD SOUTH ASSOCIATION\r\n  Old South Meeting-house, Boston, Massachusetts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Copyright 1955 by the Old South Association.\r\n  Reproduction permitted to all who give credit\r\n  to the Association.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet, first printed in Boston shortly after Massachusetts\r\nratified the Federal Constitution on February 6, 1788, achieved its\r\nlargest circulation in New York where it was issued both in pamphlet\r\nform and in a newspaper series during the spring of that year.[1] At\r\nthe time of publication the Anti-Federalist cause still seemed hopeful,\r\nfor despite the fact that Massachusetts was the sixth state to ratify\r\n(in the two previous months, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,\r\nGeorgia, and Connecticut had voted affirmatively), the approval of\r\nthree more states was required before the Constitution would become\r\noperative. Even when Maryland, South Carolina, and New Hampshire would\r\nmake the total nine (between April 26 and June 21), no continental\r\ngovernment could be effective without Virginia and New York, where\r\nstrong opposition existed (they ratified June 25th and July 26th,\r\nrespectively).\r\n\r\nThe objections to the new Constitution expressed in the _Observations_\r\nare typical of Anti-Federalist thought from New England to Georgia.[2]\r\nMany of the details seem querulous today; many were met, as far as the\r\nauthor was concerned, by the Bill of Rights.[3] Still, the underlying\r\nquestions asked are as vital now as they were then. Essentially, the\r\nproblem facing that generation was how to organize political power so\r\nthat it could be placed safely in the hands of men. Government had to\r\nbe made strong enough to survive, yet it had to be kept properly tender\r\nabout individual life, liberty, and property. As might be expected, the\r\nproblem was seen in terms of rights _against_ government rather than\r\nin terms of the citizen’s responsibility _to_ government, but in the\r\ntwentieth century’s era of absolutism it is useful to be reminded, in\r\nMrs. Warren’s words, “that man is born free and possessed of certain\r\nunalienable rights....”\r\n\r\nFor many years this pamphlet was attributed to a leading\r\nAnti-Federalist, Elbridge Gerry. However, the publication of Mercy Otis\r\nWarren’s statement of authorship in a letter of May, 1788, and evidence\r\nwithin the work that she was its author and Gerry was not, would seem\r\nto indicate that she should be given the honors.[4]\r\n\r\nThe reproduction of the _Observations_ here made is from the original\r\nin the Massachusetts Historical Society with the kind permission of Mr.\r\nStephen T. Riley. The first four and one-third pages have been omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObservations on The New Constitution\r\n\r\n\r\nAll writers on government agree, and the feelings of the human mind\r\nwitness the truth of these political axioms, that man is born free and\r\npossessed of certain unalienable rights—that government is instituted\r\nfor the protection, safety and happiness of the people, and not for the\r\nprofit, honour, or private interest of any man, family, or class of\r\nmen—That the origin of all power is in the people, and that they have\r\nan incontestible right to check the creatures of their own creation,\r\nvested with certain powers to guard the life, liberty and property\r\nof the community: And if certain selected bodies of men, deputed on\r\nthese principles, determine contrary to the wishes and expectations\r\nof their constituents, the people have an undoubted right to reject\r\ntheir decisions, to call for a revision of their conduct, to depute\r\nothers in their room, or if they think proper, to demand further time\r\nfor deliberation on matters of the greatest moment: it therefore is\r\nan unwarrantable stretch of authority or influence, if any methods\r\nare taken to preclude this reasonable and peaceful mode of enquiry\r\nand decision. And it is with inexpressible anxiety, that many of the\r\nbest friends of the Union of the States—to the peaceable and equal\r\nparticipation of the rights of nature, and to the glory and dignity\r\nof this country, behold the insidious arts, and the strenuous efforts\r\nof the partisans of arbitrary power, by their vague definitions of\r\nthe best established truths, endeavoring to envelope the mind in\r\ndarkness the concomitant of slavery, and to lock the strong chains\r\nof domestic despotism on a country, which by the most glorious and\r\nsuccessful struggles is but newly emancipated from the spectre of\r\nforeign dominion.—But there are certain seasons in the course of human\r\naffairs, when Genius, Virtue, and Patriotism, seems [_sic_] to nod over\r\nthe vices of the times, and perhaps never more remarkably, than at the\r\npresent period; or we should not see such a passive disposition prevail\r\nin some, who we must candidly suppose, have liberal and enlarged\r\nsentiments; while a supple multitude are paying a blind and idolatrous\r\nhomage to the opinions of those who by the most precipitate steps are\r\ntreading down their dear bought privileges; and who are endeavouring\r\nby all the arts of insinuation, and influence, to betray the people\r\nof the United States, into an acceptance of a most complicated system\r\nof government; marked on the one side with the _dark_, _secret_ and\r\n_profound intrigues_, of the statesman, long practised in the purlieus\r\nof despotism; and on the other, with the ideal projects of _young\r\nambition_, with its wings just expanded to soar to a summit, which\r\nimagination has painted in such gawdy colours as to intoxicate the\r\n_inexperienced votary_, and to send _him_ rambling from State to State,\r\nto collect materials to construct the ladder of preferment.\r\n\r\nBut as a variety of objections to the _heterogeneous phantom_, have\r\nbeen repeatedly laid before the public, by men of the best abilities\r\nand intentions; I will not expatiate long on a Republican _form_ of\r\ngovernment, founded on the principles of monarchy—a democratick branch\r\nwith the features of aristocracy—and the extravagance of nobility\r\npervading the minds of many of the candidates for office, with the\r\npoverty of peasantry hanging heavily on them, and insurmountable, from\r\ntheir taste for expence, unless a general provision should be made\r\nin the arrangement of the civil list, which may enable them with the\r\nchampions of their cause to “_sail down the new pactolean channel_.”\r\nSome gentlemen, with laboured zeal, have spent much time in urging the\r\nnecessity of government, from the embarrassments of trade—the want\r\nof respectability abroad and confidence of the public engagements at\r\nhome:—These are obvious truths which no one denies; and there are few\r\nwho do not unite in the general wish for the restoration of public\r\nfaith, the revival of commerce, arts, agriculture, and industry,\r\nunder a lenient, peaceable and energetick government: But the most\r\nsagacious advocates for the party have not by fair discussion, and\r\nrational argumentation, evinced the necessity of adopting this many\r\nheaded monster; of such motley mixture, that its enemies cannot trace\r\na feature of Democratick or Republican extract; nor have its friends\r\nthe courage to denominate a Monarchy, an Aristocracy, or an Oligarchy,\r\nand the favoured bantling must have passed through the short period of\r\nits existence without a name, had not Mr. _Wilson_, in the fertility of\r\nhis genius, suggested the happy epithet of a _Federal Republic_.—But I\r\nleave the field of general censure on the secrecy of its birth, the\r\nrapidity of its growth, and the fatal consequences of suffering it to\r\nlive to the age of maturity, and will particularize some of the most\r\nweighty objections to its passing through this continent in a gigantic\r\nsize.—It will be allowed by every one that the fundamental principle of\r\na free government, is the equal representation of a free people.—And\r\nI will _first_ observe with a justly celebrated writer, “That the\r\nprincipal aim of society is to protect individuals in the absolute\r\nrights which were vested in them by the immediate laws of nature, but\r\nwhich could not be preserved in peace, without the mutual intercourse\r\nwhich is gained by the institution of friendly and social communities.”\r\nAnd when society has thus deputed a certain number of their equals\r\nto take care of their personal rights, and the interest of the whole\r\ncommunity, it must be considered that responsibility is the great\r\nsecurity of integrity and honour; and that annual election is the basis\r\nof responsibility,—Man is not immediately corrupted, but power without\r\nlimitation, or amenability, may endanger the brightest virtue—whereas\r\na frequent return to the bar of their Constituents is the strongest\r\ncheck against the corruptions to which men are liable, either from the\r\nintrigues of others of more subtle genius, or the propensities of their\r\nown hearts,—and the gentlemen who have so warmly advocated in the late\r\nConvention of the Massachusetts, the change from annual to biennial\r\nelections; may have been in the same predicament, and perhaps with the\r\nsame views that Mr. _Hutchinson_ once acknowledged himself, when in a\r\nletter to _Lord Hillsborough_, he observed, “that the grand difficulty\r\nof making a change in government against the general bent of the people\r\nhad caused him to turn his thoughts to a variety of plans, in order to\r\nfind one that might be executed in spite of opposition,” and the first\r\nhe proposed was that, “instead of annual, the elections should be only\r\nonce in three years:” but the Minister had not the hardiness to attempt\r\nsuch an innovation, even in the revision of colonial charters: nor has\r\nany one ever defended Biennial, Triennial, or Septennial, Elections,\r\neither in the British House of Commons, or in the debates of Provincial\r\nassemblies, on general and free principles: but it is unnecessary\r\nto dwell long on this article, as the best political writers have\r\nsupported the principles of annual elections with a precision, that\r\ncannot be confuted, though they may be darkened, by the sophistical\r\narguments that have been thrown out with design, to undermine all the\r\nbarriers of freedom.\r\n\r\n2. There is no security in the profered [_sic_] system, either for\r\nthe rights of conscience or the liberty of the Press: Despotism\r\nusually while it is gaining ground, will suffer men to think, say, or\r\nwrite what they please; but when once established, if it is thought\r\nnecessary to subserve the purposes, of arbitrary power, the most unjust\r\nrestrictions may take place in the first instance, and an _imprimatur_\r\non the Press in the next, may silence the complaints, and forbid the\r\nmost decent remonstrances of an injured and oppressed people.\r\n\r\n3. There are no well defined limits of the Judiciary Powers, they seem\r\nto be left as a boundless ocean, that has broken over the chart of\r\nthe Supreme Lawgiver, “_thus far shalt thou go and no further_,” and\r\nas they cannot be comprehended by the clearest capacity, or the most\r\nsagacious mind, it would be an Herculean labour to attempt to describe\r\nthe dangers with which they are replete.\r\n\r\n4. The Executive and the Legislative are so dangerously blended as to\r\ngive just cause of alarm, and every thing relative thereto, is couched\r\nin such ambiguous terms—in such vague and indefinite expression, as is\r\na sufficient ground without any objection, for the reprobation of a\r\nsystem, that the authors dare not hazard to a clear investigation.\r\n\r\n5. The abolition of trial by jury in civil causes.—This mode of trial\r\nthe learned Judge Blackstone observes, “has been coeval with the\r\nfirst rudiments of civil government, that property, liberty and life,\r\ndepend on maintaining in its legal force the constitutional trial by\r\njury.” He bids his readers pause, and with Sir Matthew Hale observes,\r\nhow admirably this mode is adapted to the investigation of truth\r\nbeyond any other the world can produce. Even the party who have been\r\ndisposed to swallow, without examination, the proposals of the _secret\r\nconclave_, have started on a discovery that this essential right was\r\ncurtailed; and shall a privilege, the origin of which may be traced to\r\nour Saxon ancestors—that has been a part of the law of nations, even\r\nin the feudatory systems of France, Germany and Italy—and from the\r\nearliest records has been held so sacred, both in ancient and modern\r\nBritain, that it could never be shaken by the introduction of Norman\r\ncustoms, or any other conquests or change of government—shall this\r\ninestimable privilege be relinquished in America—either thro’ the fear\r\nof inquisition for unaccounted thousands of public monies in the hands\r\nof some who have been officious in the fabrication of the _consolidated\r\nsystem_, or from the apprehension that some future delinquent possessed\r\nof more power than integrity, may be called to a trial by his peers in\r\nthe hour of investigation.\r\n\r\n6. Though it has been said by Mr. _Wilson_ and many others, that a\r\nStanding-Army is necessary for the dignity and safety of America, yet\r\nfreedom revolts at the idea, when the Divan, or the Despot, may draw\r\nout his dragoons to suppress the murmurs of a few, who may yet cherish\r\nthose sublime principles which call forth the exertions, and lead\r\nto the best improvement of the human mind. It is hoped this country\r\nmay yet be governed by milder methods than are usually displayed\r\nbeneath the bannerets of military law.—Standing armies have been the\r\nnursery of vice and the bane of liberty from the Roman legions to the\r\nestablishment of the artful Ximenes, and from the ruin of the Cortes\r\nof Spain, to the planting of the British cohorts in the capitals of\r\nAmerica:—By the edicts of an authority vested in the sovereign power\r\nby the proposed constitution, the militia of the country, the bulwark\r\nof defence, and the security of national liberty is no longer under\r\nthe controul of civil authority; but at the rescript of the Monarch,\r\nor the aristocracy, they may either be employed to extort the enormous\r\nsums that will be necessary to support the civil list—to maintain\r\nthe regalia of power—and the splendour of the most useless part of\r\nthe community, or they may be sent into foreign countries for the\r\nfulfilment of treaties, stipulated by the President and two thirds of\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\n7. Notwithstanding the delusory promise to guarantee a Republican\r\nform of government to every State in the Union—If the most discerning\r\neye could discover any meaning at all in the engagement, there are\r\nno resources left for the support of internal government, or the\r\nliquidation of the debts of the State. Every source of revenue is in\r\nthe monopoly of Congress, and if the several legislatures in their\r\nenfeebled state, should against their own feelings be necessitated to\r\nattempt a dry tax for the payment of their debts, and the support of\r\ninternal police, even this may be required for the purposes of the\r\ngeneral government.\r\n\r\n8. As the new Congress are empowered to determine their own salaries,\r\nthe requisitions for this purpose may not be very moderate, and the\r\ndrain for public moneys will probably rise past all calculation: and\r\nit is to be feared when America has consolidated its despotism, the\r\nworld will witness the truth of the assertion—“that the pomp of an\r\neastern monarch may impose on the vulgar who may estimate the force of\r\na nation by the magnificence of its palaces; but the wise man judges\r\ndifferently, it is by that very magnificence he estimates its weakness.\r\nHe sees nothing more in the midst of this imposing pomp, where the\r\ntyrant sets enthroned, than a sumptuous and mournful decoration of the\r\ndead; the apparatus of a fastuous funeral, in the centre of which is a\r\ncold and lifeless lump of unanimated earth, a phantom of power ready to\r\ndisappear before the enemy, by whom it is despised!”\r\n\r\n9. There is no provision for a rotation, nor anything to prevent the\r\nperpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little\r\nwell timed bribery, will probably be done, to the exclusion of men of\r\nthe best abilities from their share in the offices of government.—By\r\nthis neglect we lose the advantages of that check to the overbearing\r\ninsolence of office, which by rendering him ineligible at certain\r\nperiods, keeps the mind of man in equilibrio, and teaches him the\r\nfeelings of the governed, and better qualifies him to govern in his\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n10. The inhabitants of the United States, are liable to be draged\r\n[_sic_] from the vicinity of their own country, or state, to answer the\r\nlitigious or unjust suit of an adversary, on the most distant borders\r\nof the Continent: in short the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme\r\nFederal Court, includes an unwarrantable stretch of power over the\r\nliberty, life, and property of the subject, through the wide Continent\r\nof America.\r\n\r\n11. One Representative to thirty thousand inhabitants is a very\r\ninadequate representation; and every man who is not lost to all sense\r\nof freedom to his country, must reprobate the idea of Congress altering\r\nby law, or on any pretence whatever, interfering with any regulations\r\nfor time, places, and manner of choosing our own Representatives.\r\n\r\n12. If the sovereignty of America is designed to be elective, the\r\ncircumscribing the votes to only ten electors in this State, and\r\nthe same proportion in all the others, is nearly tantamount to the\r\nexclusion of the voice of the people in the choice of their first\r\nmagistrate. It is vesting the choice solely in an aristocratic junto,\r\nwho may easily combine in each State to place at the head of the Union\r\nthe most convenient instrument for despotic sway.\r\n\r\n13. A Senate chosen for six years will, in most instances, be an\r\nappointment for life, as the influence of such a body over the minds\r\nof the people will be coequal to the extensive powers with which they\r\nare vested, and they will not only forget, but be forgotten by their\r\nconstituents—a branch of the Supreme Legislature thus set beyond all\r\nresponsibility is totally repugnant to every principle of a free\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n14. There is no provision by a bill of rights to guard against the\r\ndangerous encroachments of power in too many instances to be named:\r\nbut I cannot pass over in silence the insecurity in which we are left\r\nwith regard to warrants unsupported by evidence—the daring experiment\r\nof granting _writs of assistance_ in a former arbitrary administration\r\nis not yet forgotten in the Massachusetts; nor can we be so ungrateful\r\nto the memory of the patriots who counteracted their operation, as so\r\nsoon after their manly exertions to save us from such a detestable\r\ninstrument of arbitrary power, to subject ourselves to the insolence\r\nof any petty revenue officer to enter our houses, search, insult, and\r\nseize at pleasure. We are told by a gentleman of too much virtue and\r\nreal probity to suspect he has a design to deceive—“that the whole\r\nconstitution is a declaration of rights,”—but mankind must think for\r\nthemselves, and to many very judicious and discerning characters, the\r\nwhole constitution with very few exceptions appears a perversion of the\r\nrights of particular states, and of private citizens.—But the gentleman\r\ngoes on to tell us, “that the primary object is the general government,\r\nand that the rights of individuals are only incidentally mentioned,\r\nand that there was a clear impropriety in being very particular\r\nabout them.” But, asking pardon for dissenting from such respectable\r\nauthority, who has been led into several mistakes, more from his\r\npredilection in favour of certain modes of government, than from a\r\nwant of understanding or veracity. The rights of individuals ought to\r\nbe the primary object of all government, and cannot be too securely\r\nguarded by the most explicit declarations in their favor. This has\r\nbeen the opinion of the Hampdens, the Pyms, and many other illustrious\r\nnames, that have stood forth in defence of English liberties; and even\r\nthe Italian master in politics, the subtle and renowned Machiavelli\r\nacknowledges, that no republic ever yet stood on a stable foundation\r\nwithout satisfying the common people.\r\n\r\n15. The difficulty, if not impracticability, of exercising the equal\r\nand equitable powers of government by a single legislature over an\r\nextent of territory that reaches from the Mississippi to the Western\r\nlakes, and from them to the Atlantic Ocean, is an insuperable objection\r\nto the adoption of the new system.—Mr. _Hutchinson_, the great champion\r\nfor arbitrary power, in the multitude of his machinations to subvert\r\nthe liberties of this country, was obliged to acknowledge in one of his\r\nletters, that, “from the extent of country from north to south, the\r\nscheme of one government was impracticable.” But if the authors of the\r\npresent visionary project, can by the arts of deception, precipitation\r\nand address, obtain a majority of suffrages in the conventions of the\r\nstates to try the hazardous experiment, they may then make the same\r\ninglorious boast with this insidious politician, who may perhaps be\r\ntheir model, that “the union of the colonies was pretty well broken,\r\nand that he hoped to never see it re[n]ewed.”\r\n\r\n16. It is an undisputed fact that not one legislature in the United\r\nStates had the most distant idea when they first appointed members for\r\na convention, entirely commercial, or when they afterwards authorized\r\nthem to consider on some amendments of the Federal union, that they\r\nwould without any warrant from their constituents, presume on so bold\r\nand daring a stride, as ultimately to destroy the state governments,\r\nand offer a _consolidated system_, irreversible but on conditions that\r\nthe smallest degree of penetration must discover to be impracticable.\r\n\r\n17. The first appearance of the article which declares the ratification\r\nof nine states sufficient for the establishment of the new system,\r\nwears the face of dissension, is a subversion of the union of\r\nConfederated States, and tends to the introduction of anarchy and civil\r\nconvulsions, and may be a means of involving the whole country in\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n18. The mode in which this constitution is recommended to the people\r\nto judge without either the advice of Congress, or the legislatures of\r\nthe several states is very reprehensible—it is an attempt to force it\r\nupon them before it could be thoroughly understood, and may leave us in\r\nthat situation, that in the first moments of slavery in the minds of\r\nthe people agitated by the remembrance of their lost liberties, will be\r\nlike the sea in a tempest, that sweeps down every mound of security.\r\n\r\nBut it is needless to enumerate other instances, in which the proposed\r\nconstitution appears contradictory to the first principles which\r\nought to govern mankind; and it is equally so to enquire into the\r\nmotives that induced to so bold a step as the annihilation of the\r\nindependence and sovereignty of the thirteen distinct states.—They are\r\nbut too obvious through the whole progress of the business, from the\r\nfirst shutting up the doors of the federal convention and resolving\r\nthat no member should correspond with gentlemen in the different\r\nstates on the subject under discussion; till the trivial proposition\r\nof _recommending_ a few amendments was artfully ushered into the\r\nconvention of the Massachusetts. The questions that were then before\r\nthat honorable assembly were profound and important, they were of such\r\nmagnitude and extent, that the consequences may run parallel with the\r\nexistence of the country; and to see them waved and hastily terminated\r\nby a measure too absurd to require a serious refutation, raises the\r\nhonest indignation of every true lover of his country. Nor are they\r\nless grieved that the ill policy and arbitrary disposition of some of\r\nthe sons of America has thus precipitated to the contemplation and\r\ndiscussion of questions that no one could rationally suppose would\r\nhave been agitated among us till time had blotted out the principles\r\non which the late revolution was grounded; or till the last traits of\r\nthe many political tracts, which defended the separation from Britain,\r\nand the rights of men were consigned to everlasting oblivion. After\r\nthe severe conflicts this country has suffered, it is presumed that\r\nthey are disposed to make every reasonable sacrifice before the altar\r\nof peace.—But when we contemplate the nature of men and consider\r\nthem originally on an equal footing, subject to the same feelings,\r\nstimulated by the same passions, and recollecting the struggles they\r\nhave recently made, for the security of their civil rights; it\r\ncannot be expected that the inhabitants of the Massachusetts, can be\r\neasily lulled into a fatal security, by the declamatory effusions of\r\ngentlemen, who, contrary to the experience of all ages would perswade\r\nthem there is no danger to be apprehended, from vesting discretionary\r\npowers in the hands of man, which he may, or may not abuse. The very\r\nsuggestion, that we ought to trust to the precarious hope of amendments\r\nand redress, after we have voluntarily fixed the shackles on our own\r\nnecks should have awakened to a double degree of caution.—This people\r\nhave not forgotten the artful insinuations of a former Governor, when\r\npleading the unlimited authority of parliament before the legislature\r\nof the Massachusetts; nor that his arguments were very similar to some\r\nlately urged by gentlemen who boast of opposing his measures, “_with\r\nhalters about their necks_.”\r\n\r\nWe were then told by him, in all the soft language of insinuation, that\r\nno form of government, of human construction can be perfect—that we\r\nhad nothing to fear—that we had no reason to complain—that we had only\r\nto acquiesce in their illegal claims, and to submit to the requisition\r\nof parliament, and doubtless the lenient hand of government would\r\nredress all grievances, and remove the oppressions of the people:—Yet\r\nwe soon saw armies of mercenaries encamped on our plains—our commerce\r\nruined—our harbours blockaded—and our cities burnt. It may be replied\r\nthat this was in consequence of an obstinate defence of our privileges;\r\nthis may be true; and when the “_ultima ratio_” is called to aid, the\r\nweakest must fall. But let the best informed historian produce an\r\ninstance when bodies of men were entrusted with power, and the proper\r\nchecks relinquished, if they were ever found destitute of ingenuity\r\nsufficient to furnish pretences to abuse it. And the people at large\r\nare already sensible, that the liberties which America has claimed,\r\nwhich reason has justified, and which have been so gloriously defended\r\nby the sword of the brave; are not about to fall before the tyranny\r\nof foreign conquest: it is native usurpation that is shaking the\r\nfoundations of peace, and spreading the sable curtain of despotism over\r\nthe United States. The banners of freedom were erected in the wilds\r\nof America by our ancestors, while the wolf prowled for his prey on\r\nthe one hand, and more savage man on the other; they have been since\r\nrescued from the invading hand of foreign power, by the valor and blood\r\nof their posterity; and there was reason to hope they would continue\r\nfor ages to illumine a quarter of the globe, by nature kindly separated\r\nfrom the proud monarchies of Europe, and the infernal darkness of\r\nAsiatic slavery.—And it is to be feared we shall soon see this country\r\nrushing into the extremes of confusion and violence, in consequence of\r\nthe proceedings of a set of gentlemen, who disregarding the purposes of\r\ntheir appointment, have assumed powers unauthorized by any commission,\r\nhave unnecessarily rejected the confederation of the United States,\r\nand annihilated the sovereignty and independence of the individual\r\ngovernments.—The causes which have inspired a few men to assemble for\r\nvery different purposes with such a degree of temerity [a]s to break\r\nwith a single stroke the union of America, and disseminate the seeds\r\nof discord through the land may be easily investigated, when we survey\r\nthe partizans of monarchy in the state conventions, urging the adoption\r\nof a mode of government that militates with the former professions and\r\nexertions of this country, and with all ideas of republicanism, and the\r\nequal rights of men.\r\n\r\nPassion, prejudice, and error, are characteristics of human nature;\r\nand as it cannot be accounted for on any principles of philosophy,\r\nreligion, or good policy; to these shades in the human character\r\nmust be attributed the mad zeal of some, to precipitate to a blind\r\nadoption of the measures of the late federal convention, without\r\ngiving opportunity for better information to those who are misled by\r\ninfluence or ignorance into erroneous opinions.—Litterary talents\r\nmay be prostituted, and the powers of genius debased to subserve the\r\npurposes of ambition, or avarice; but the feelings of the heart will\r\ndictate the language of truth, and the simplicity of her accents will\r\nproclaim the infamy of those, who betray the rights of the people,\r\nunder the specious, and popular pretence of _justice_, _consolidation_,\r\nand _dignity_.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed the great body of the people unite in sentiment with\r\nthe writer of these observations, who most devoutly prays that public\r\ncredit may rear her declining head, and remunerative justice pervade\r\nthe land; nor is there a doubt if a free government is continued,\r\nthat time and industry will enable both the public and private\r\ndebtor to liquidate their arrearages in the most equitable manner.\r\nThey wish to see the Confederated States bound together by the most\r\nindissoluble union, but without renouncing their separate sovereignties\r\nand independence, and becoming tributaries to a consolidated fabrick\r\nof aristocratick tyranny.—They wish to see government established,\r\nand peaceably holding the reins with honour, energy, and dignity;\r\nbut they wish for no _federal city_ whose “_cloud cap’t towers_” may\r\nscreen the state culprit from the hand of justice; while its exclusive\r\njurisdiction may protect the riot of armies encamped within its\r\nlimits.—They deprecate discord and civil convulsions, but they are not\r\nyet generally prepared with the ungrateful Israelites to ask a King,\r\nnor are their spirits sufficiently broken to yield the best of their\r\nolive grounds to his servants, and to see their sons appointed to run\r\nbefore his chariots—It has been observed by a zealous advocate for the\r\nnew system, that most governments are the result of fraud or violence,\r\nand this with design to recommend its acceptance—but has not almost\r\nevery step towards its fabrication been fraudulent in the extreme?\r\nDid not the prohibition strictly enjoined by the general Convention,\r\nthat no member should make any communication to his Constituents, or\r\nto gentlemen of consideration and abilities in the other States, bear\r\nevident marks of fraudulent designs?—This circumstance is regretted in\r\nstrong terms by Mr. Martin, a member from Maryland, who acknowledges\r\n“He had no idea that all the wisdom, integrity, and virtue of the\r\nStates was contained in that Convention, and that he wished to have\r\ncorresponded with gentlemen of eminent political characters abroad, and\r\nto give their sentiments due weight”—he adds, “so extremely solicitous\r\nwere they, that their proceedings should not transpire, that the\r\nmembers were prohibited from taking copies of their resolutions, or\r\nextracts from the Journals, without express permission, by vote.”—And\r\nthe hurry with which it has been urged to the acceptance of the people,\r\nwithout giving time, by adjournments, for better information, and\r\nmore unanimity has a deceptive appearance; and if finally driven to\r\nresistance, as the only alternative between that and servitude, till in\r\nthe confusion of discord, the reins should be seized by the violence\r\nof some enterprizing genius, that may sweep down the last barrier of\r\nliberty, it must be added to the score of criminality with which\r\nthe fraudulent usurpation at Philadelphia, may be chargeable.—Heaven\r\navert such a tremendous ... [scene] and let us still hope a more\r\nhappy termination of the present ferment:—may the people be calm and\r\nwait a legal redress; may the mad transport of some of our infatuated\r\ncapitals subside; and every influential character through the States,\r\nmake the most prudent exertions for a new general Convention, who may\r\nvest adequate powers in Congress, for all national purposes, without\r\nannihilating the individual governments, and drawing blood from every\r\npore by taxes, impositions and illegal restrictions.—This step might\r\nagain re-establish the Union, restore tranquility to the ruffled mind\r\nof the inhabitants, and save America from the distresses, dreadful\r\neven in contemplation.—“The great art of governing is to lay aside\r\nall prejudices and attachments to particular opinions, classes or\r\nindividual characters to consult the spirit of the people; to give\r\nway to it; and in so doing, to give it a turn capable of inspiring\r\nthose sentiments, which may induce them to relish a change, which\r\nan alteration of circumstances may hereafter make necessary.”—The\r\neducation of the advocates for monarchy should have taught them, and\r\ntheir memory should have suggested that “monarchy is a species of\r\ngovernment fit only for a people too much corrupted by luxury, avarice,\r\nand a passion for pleasure, to have any love for their country, and\r\nwhose vices the fear of punishment alone is able to restrain; but by\r\nno means calculated for a nation that is poor, and at the same time\r\ntenacious of their liberty—animated with a disgust to tyranny—and\r\ninspired with the generous feeling of patriotism and liberty, and\r\nat the same time, like the ancient Spartans have been hardened by\r\ntemperance and manly exertions, and equally despising the fatigues of\r\nthe field, and the fear of enemies,”—and while they change their ground\r\nthey should recollect, that Aristocracy is a still more formidable foe\r\nto public virtue, and the prosperity of a nation—that under such a\r\ngovernment her patriots become mercenaries—her soldiers, cowards, and\r\nthe people slaves.—Though several State Conventions have assented to,\r\nand ratified, yet the voice of the people appears at present strong\r\nagainst the adoption of the Constitution.—By the chicanery, intrigue,\r\nand false colouring of those who plume themselves, more on their\r\neducation and abilities, than their political, patriotic, or private\r\nvirtues—by the imbecility of some, and the duplicity of others, a\r\nmajority of the Convention of Massachusetts have been flattered with\r\nthe ideas of amendments, when it will be too late to complain—While\r\nseveral very worthy characters, too timid for their situation,\r\nmagnified the hopeless alternative, between the dissolution of the\r\nbands of all government, and receiving the proferred system _in toto_,\r\nafter long endeavouring to reconcile it to their consciences, swallowed\r\nthe indigestible panacea, and in a kind of sudden desperation lent\r\ntheir signature to the dereliction of the honourable station they held\r\nin the Union, and have broken over the solemn compact, by which they\r\nwere bound to support their own excellent constitution till the period\r\nof revision. Yet Virginia, equally large and respectable, and who\r\nhave done honour to themselves, by their vigorous exertions from the\r\nfirst dawn of independence, have not yet acted upon the question; they\r\nhave wisely taken time to consider before they introduce innovations\r\nof a most dangerous nature:—her inhabitants are brave, her burgesses\r\nare free, and they have a Governor who dares to think for himself,\r\nand to speak his opinion (without first pouring libations on the\r\naltar of popularity) though it should militate with some of the most\r\naccomplished and illustrious characters.\r\n\r\nMaryland, who has no local interest to lead her to adopt, will\r\ndoubtless reject the system—I hope the same characters still live,\r\nand that same spirit which dictated to them a wise and cautious care,\r\nagainst sudden revolutions in government, and made them the last State\r\nthat acceded to the independence of America, will lead them to support\r\nwhat they so deliberately claimed.—Georgia apprehensive of a war with\r\nthe Savages, has acceded in order to insure protection.—Pennsylvania\r\nhas struggled through much in the same manner, as the Massachusetts,\r\nagainst the manly feelings, and the masterly reasonings of a very\r\nrespectable part of the Convention: They have adopted the system, and\r\nseen some of its authors burnt in effigy—their towns thrown into riot\r\nand confusion, and the minds of the people agitated by apprehension and\r\ndiscord.\r\n\r\nNew Jersey and Delaware have united in the measure, from the locality\r\nof their situation, and the selfish motives which too generally govern\r\nmankind; the Federal City, and the seat of government, will naturally\r\nattract the intercourse of strangers—the youth of enterprize, and the\r\nwealth of the nation to the central States.\r\n\r\nConnecticut has pushed it through with the precipitation of her\r\nneighbour, with few dissentient voices;—but more from irritation and\r\nresentment to a sister State, perhaps partiality to herself in her\r\ncommercial regulations, than from a comprehensive view of the system,\r\nas a regard to the welfare of all.—But New York has motives, that will\r\nundoubtedly lead her to rejection, without being afraid to appeal to\r\nthe understanding of mankind, to justify the grounds of their refusal\r\nto adopt a Constitution, that even the framers dare not to risque\r\nto the hazard of revision, amendment, or reconsideration, least the\r\nwhole superstructure should be demolished by more skilful and discreet\r\narchitects.—I know not what part the Carolinas will take; but I hope\r\ntheir determinations will comport with the dignity and freedom of\r\nthis country—their decisions will have great weight in the scale.—But\r\nequally important are the small States of New Hampshire and Rhode\r\nIsland:—New York, the Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland, and these two\r\nlesser States may yet support the liberties of the Continent; if they\r\nrefuse a ratification or postpone their proceedings till the spirits\r\nof the community have time to cool, there is little doubt but the wise\r\nmeasure of another federal convention will be adopted, when the members\r\nwould have the advantage of viewing, at large, through the medium of\r\ntruth, the objections that have been made from various quarters; such a\r\nmeasure might be attended with the most salutary effects, and prevent\r\nthe dread consequences of civil feuds.—But even if some of those large\r\nstates should hastily accede, yet we have frequently seen in the story\r\nof revolution, relief spring from a quarter least expected.\r\n\r\nThough the virtues of a Cato could not save Rome, nor the abilities\r\nof a Padilla defend the citizens of Castile from falling under the\r\nyoke of Charles; yet a _Tell_ once suddenly rose from a little obscure\r\ncity, and boldly rescued the liberties of his country.—Every age\r\nhas its Bruti and its Decii, as well as its Caesars and Sejani:—The\r\nhappiness of mankind depends much on the modes of government, and the\r\nvirtues of the governors; and America may yet produce characters who\r\nhave genius and capacity sufficient to form the manners and correct\r\nthe morals of the people, and virtue enough to lead their country to\r\nfreedom. Since their dismemberment from the British empire, America\r\nhas, in many instances, resembled the conduct of a restless, vigorous,\r\nluxurious youth, prematurely emancipated from the authority of a\r\nparent, but without the experience necessary to direct him to act\r\nwith dignity or discretion. Thus we have seen her break the shackles\r\nof foreign dominion, and all the blessings of peace restored on the\r\nmost honourable terms: She acquired the liberty of framing her own\r\nlaws, choosing her own magistrates, and adopting manners and modes of\r\ngovernment the most favourable to the freedom and happiness of society.\r\nBut how little have we availed ourselves of these superior advantages:\r\nThe glorious fabric of liberty successfully reared with so much labor\r\nand assiduity totters to the foundation, and may be blown away as\r\nthe bubble of fancy by the rude breath of military combinations, and\r\npoliticians of yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt is true this country lately armed in opposition to regal\r\ndespotism—impoverished by the expences of a long war, and unable\r\nimmediately to fulfil their public or private engagements that appeared\r\nin some instances, with a boldness of spirit that seemed to set at\r\ndefiance all authority, government, or order, on the one hand; while on\r\nthe other, there has been, not only a secret wish, but an open avowal\r\nof the necessity of drawing the reins of government much too taut, not\r\nonly for a republicanism, but for a wise and limited monarchy.—But the\r\ncharacter of this people is not averse to a degree of subordination,\r\nthe truth of this appears from the easy restoration of tranquility,\r\nafter a dangerous insurrection in one of the states; this also evinces\r\na little necessity of a complete revolution of government throughout\r\nthe union. But it is a republican principle that the majority should\r\nrule; and if a spirit of moderation should be cultivated on both\r\nsides, till the voice of the people at large could be fairly heard\r\nit should be held sacred.—And if, on such a scrutiny, the proposed\r\nconstitution should appear repugnant to their character and wishes;\r\nif they, in the language of a late elegant pen, should acknowledge\r\nthat “no confusion in my mind, is more terrible to them than the stern\r\ndisciplined regularity and vaunted police of arbitrary governments,\r\nwhere every heart is depraved by fear, where mankind dare not assume\r\ntheir natural characters, where the free spirit must crouch to the\r\nslave in office, where genius must repress her effusions, or like the\r\nEgyptian worshippers, offer them in sacrifice to the calves in power,\r\nand where the human mind, always in shackles, shrinks from every\r\ngenerous effort.” Who would then have the effrontery to say, it ought\r\nnot to be thrown out with indignation, however some respectable names\r\nhave appeared to support it.—But if after all, on a dispassionate and\r\nfair discussion, the people generally give their voice for a voluntary\r\ndereliction of their privileges, let every individual who chooses\r\nthe active scenes of life, strive to support the peace and unanimity\r\nof his country, though every other blessing may expire—And while the\r\nstatesman is plodding for power, and the courtier practising the arts\r\nof dissimulation without check—while the rapacious are growing rich by\r\noppression, and fortune throwing her gifts into the lap of fools, let\r\nthe sublimer characters, the philosophic lovers of freedom who have\r\nwept over her exit, retire to the calm shades of contemplation, there\r\nthey may look down with pity on the inconsistency of human nature, the\r\nrevolutions of states, the rise of kingdoms, and the fall of empires.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Charles Warren, “Elbridge Gerry, James Warren, Mercy Warren and the\r\nRatification of the Federal Constitution in Massachusetts,” M.H.S.,\r\n_Proceedings, 1930-1932_, pp. 143-144.
