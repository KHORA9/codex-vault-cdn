The chapters are\r\nlittle more than presentations from different points of view of this\r\none idea. The chapters on Politics and Society seem to show that our\r\npolitical corruptions and social inferiorities can be traced to the\r\nsame source,--namely, temporary distortion of human character by the\r\nforces of commerce. The chapter on Education is a study on the law of\r\nintellectual growth, and shows that a normal and rounded development\r\ncan only come from a use of the faculties very different from that\r\npractised by the average American since the discovery of the cotton\r\ngin.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on Democracy is a review of that subject by the light of\r\nthe conclusions as to the Nature of Man, arrived at in the Essay on\r\nEducation; and it is seen that our frame of government is in accord\r\nwith sound philosophy, and is a constant influence tending to correct\r\nthe distortions described in the first two chapters. In the final\r\nchapter on Government, some illustrations are drawn together, showing\r\nthat the whole course of reasoning of the book contains nothing novel,\r\nbut accords with the ideals and with the wisdom of the world.\r\n\r\nThe book itself arose out of an attempt to explain an election.\r\n\r\n                                                            J.

It is part of the triumph of industrial progress. Its\r\ndetails are easier to understand if studied as a part of the commercial\r\ndevelopment of the country than if studied as a part of government,\r\nbecause many of the wheels and cranks in the complex machinery of\r\ngovernment are now performing functions so perverted as to be unmeaning\r\nfrom the point of view of political theory, but which become perfectly\r\nplain if looked at from the point of view of trade.\r\n\r\nThe growth and concentration of capital which the railroad and the\r\ntelegraph made possible is the salient fact in the history of the last\r\nquarter-century. That fact is at the bottom of our political troubles.\r\nIt was inevitable that the enormous masses of wealth, springing out of\r\nnew conditions and requiring new laws, should strive to control the\r\nlegislation and the administration which touched them at every point.\r\nAt the present time, we cannot say just what changes were or were not\r\nrequired by enlightened theory. It is enough to see that such changes\r\nas came were inevitable; and nothing can blind us to the fact that the\r\nmethods by which they were obtained were subversive of free government.\r\n\r\nWhatever form of government had been in force in America during\r\nthis era would have run the risk of being controlled by capital, of\r\nbeing bought and run for revenue. It happened that the beginning of\r\nthe period found the machinery of our government in a particularly\r\npurchasable state. The war had left the people divided into two\r\nparties which were fanatically hostile to each other. The people were\r\nparty mad. Party name and party symbols were of an almost religious\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when the enthusiasm of the nation had been exhausted\r\nin a heroic war which left the Republican party-managers in possession\r\nof the ark of the covenant, the best intellect of the country was\r\nwithdrawn from public affairs and devoted to trade. During the\r\nperiod of expansion which followed, the industrial forces called in\r\nthe ablest men of the nation to aid them in getting control of the\r\nmachinery of government. The name of king was never freighted with more\r\npower than the name of party in the United States; whatever was done\r\nin that name was right. It is the old story: there has never been a\r\ndespotism which did not rest upon superstition. The same spirit that\r\nmade the Republican name all powerful in the nation at large made the\r\nDemocratic name valuable in Democratic districts.\r\n\r\nThe situation as it existed was made to the hand of trade. Political\r\npower had by the war been condensed and packed for delivery; and in\r\nthe natural course of things the political trademarks began to find\r\ntheir way into the coffers of the capitalist. The change of motive\r\npower behind the party organizations--from principles, to money--was\r\nsilently effected during the thirty years which followed the war. Like\r\nall organic change, it was unconscious. It was understood by no one.\r\nIt is recorded only in a few names and phrases; as, for instance, that\r\npart of the organization which was purchased was called the “machine,”\r\nand the general manager of it became known as the “boss.” The external\r\npolitical history of the country continued as before. It is true that\r\na steady degradation was to be seen in public life, a steady failure\r\nof character, a steady decline of decency. But questions continued to\r\nbe discussed, and in form decided, on their merits, because it was in\r\nthe interest of commerce that they should in form be so decided. Only\r\nquite recently has the control of money become complete; and there are\r\nreasons for believing that the climax is past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us take a look at the change on a small scale. A railroad is to be\r\nrun through a country town or small city, in New York or Pennsylvania.\r\nThe railroad employs a local attorney, naturally the ablest attorney in\r\nthe place. As time goes on, various permits for street uses are needed;\r\nand instead of relying solely upon popular demand, the attorney finds\r\nit easier to bribe the proper officials. All goes well: the railroad\r\nthrives, the town grows. But in the course of a year new permits of\r\nvarious kinds are needed. The town ordinances interfere with the road\r\nand require amendment. There is to be a town election; and it occurs\r\nto the railroad’s attorney that he might be in alliance with the town\r\nofficers before they are elected. He goes to the managers of the\r\nparty which is likely to win; for instance, the Republican party.\r\nEverything that the railroad wants is really called for by the economic\r\nneeds of the town. The railroad wants only fair play and no factious\r\nobstruction. The attorney talks to the Republican leader, and has a\r\nchance to look over the list of candidates, and perhaps even to select\r\nsome of them. The railroad makes the largest campaign subscription ever\r\nmade in that part of the country. The Republican leader can now employ\r\nmore workers to man the polls, and, if necessary, he can buy votes.\r\nHe must also retain some fraction of the contribution for his own\r\nsupport, and distribute the rest in such manner as will best keep his\r\n“organization” together.\r\n\r\nThe party wins, and the rights of the railroad are secured for a year.\r\nIt is true that the brother of the Republican leader is employed on the\r\nroad as a brakeman; but he is a competent man.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, a very nice point of law arises as to the rights of\r\nthe railroad to certain valuable land claimed by the town. The city\r\nattorney is an able man, and reasonable. In spite of his ability, he\r\nmanages somehow to state the city’s case on an untenable ground. A\r\ndecision follows in favor of the railroad. At the following election,\r\nthe city attorney has become the Republican candidate for judge, and\r\nthe railroad’s campaign subscription is trebled. In the conduct of\r\nrailroads, even under the best management, accidents are common; and\r\nwhile it is true that important decisions are appealable, a trial judge\r\nhas enormous powers which are practically discretionary. Meanwhile,\r\nthere have arisen questions of local taxation of the railroad’s\r\nproperty, questions as to grade crossings, as to the lighting of cars,\r\nas to time schedules, and the like. The court calendars are becoming\r\ncrowded with railroad business; and that business is now more than\r\none attorney can attend to. In fact, the half dozen local lawyers of\r\nprominence are railroad men; the rest of the lawyers would like to\r\nbe. Every one of the railroad lawyers receives deferential treatment,\r\nand, when possible, legal advantage in all of the public offices. The\r\ncommunity is now in the control of a ring, held together by just one\r\nthing, the railroad company’s subscription to the campaign fund.\r\n\r\nBy this time a serious scandal has occurred in the town,--nothing less\r\nthan the rumor of a deficit in the town treasurer’s accounts, and\r\nthe citizens are concerned about it. One of the railroad’s lawyers,\r\na strong party man, happens to be occupying the post of district\r\nattorney; for the yearly campaign subscriptions continue. This district\r\nattorney is, in fact, one of the committee on nominations who put the\r\ntown treasurer into office; and the Republican party is responsible\r\nfor both. No prosecution follows. The district attorney stands for\r\nre-election.\r\n\r\nAn outsider comes to live in the town. He wants to reform things,\r\nand proceeds to talk politics. He is not so inexperienced as to\r\nseek aid from the rich and respectable classes. He knows that the\r\nmen who subscribed to the railroad’s stock are the same men who own\r\nthe local bank, and that the manufacturers and other business men\r\nof the place rely on the bank for carrying on their business. He\r\nknows that all trades which are specially touched by the law, such\r\nas the liquor-dealers’ and hotel-keepers’, must “stand in” with the\r\nadministration; so also must the small shopkeepers, and those who have\r\nto do with sidewalk privileges and town ordinances generally. The\r\nnewcomer talks to the leading hardware merchant, a man of stainless\r\nreputation, who admits that the district attorney has been remiss;\r\nbut the merchant is a Republican, and says that so long as he lives\r\nhe will vote for the party that saved the country. To vote for a\r\nDemocrat is a crime. The reformer next approaches the druggist (whose\r\nfather-in-law is in the employ of the railroad), and receives the\r\nsame reply. He goes to the florist. But the florist owns a piece of\r\nreal estate, and has a theory that it is assessed too high. The time\r\nfor revising the assessment rolls is coming near, and he has to see\r\nthe authorities about that. The florist agrees that the town is a den\r\nof thieves; but he must live; he has no time to go into theoretical\r\npolitics. The stranger next interviews a retired grocer. But the grocer\r\nhas lent money to his nephew, who is in the coal business, and is\r\ngetting special rates from the railroad, and is paying off the debt\r\nrapidly. The grocer would be willing to help, but his name must not be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to multiply instances of what every one knows. After\r\ncanvassing the whole community, the stranger finds five persons who are\r\nwilling to work to defeat the district attorney: a young doctor of good\r\neducation and small practice, a young lawyer who thinks he can make use\r\nof the movement by betraying it, a retired anti-slavery preacher, a\r\nmaiden lady, and a piano-tuner. The district attorney is re-elected by\r\nan overwhelming vote.\r\n\r\nAll this time the railroad desires only a quiet life. It takes no\r\ninterest in politics. It is making money, and does not want values\r\ndisturbed. It is conservative.\r\n\r\nIn the following year worse things happen. The town treasurer steals\r\nmore money, and the district attorney is openly accused of sharing\r\nthe profits. The Democrats are shouting for reform, and declare that\r\nthey will run the strongest man in town for district attorney. He is a\r\nDemocrat, but one who fought for the Union. He is no longer in active\r\npractice, and is, on the whole, the most distinguished citizen of the\r\nplace. This suggestion is popular. The hardware merchant declares\r\nthat he will vote the Democratic ticket, and there is a sensation.\r\nIt appears that during all these years there has been a Democratic\r\norganization in the town, and that the notorious corruption of the\r\nRepublicans makes a Democratic victory possible. The railroad company\r\ntherefore goes to the manager of the Democratic party, and explains\r\nthat it wants only to be let alone. It explains that it takes no\r\ninterest in politics, but that, if a change is to come, it desires only\r\nthat So-and-So shall be retained, and it leaves a subscription with\r\nthe Democratic manager. In short, it makes the best terms it can. The\r\nDemocratic leader, if he thinks that he can make a clean sweep, may\r\nnominate the distinguished citizen, together with a group of his own\r\norganization comrades. It obviously would be of no use to him to name a\r\nfull citizens’ ticket. That would be treason to his party. If he takes\r\nthis course and wins, we shall have ring rule of a slightly milder\r\ntype. The course begins anew, under a Democratic name; and it may be\r\nseveral years before another malfeasance occurs.\r\n\r\nBut the Republican leader and the railroad company do not want war;\r\nthey want peace. They may agree to make it worth while for the\r\nDemocrats not to run the distinguished citizen. A few Democrats are let\r\ninto the Republican ring. They are promised certain minor appointive\r\noffices, and some contracts and emoluments. Accordingly, the Democrats\r\ndo not nominate the distinguished citizen. The hardware man sees little\r\nchoice between the two nominees for district attorney; at any rate, he\r\nwill not vote for a machine Democrat, and he again votes for his party\r\nnominee. All the reform talk simmers down to silence. The Republicans\r\nare returned to power.\r\n\r\nThe town is now ruled by a Happy Family. Stable equilibrium has been\r\nreached at last. Commercialism is in control. Henceforth, the railroad\r\ncompany pays the bills for keeping up both party organizations, and it\r\nreceives care and protection from whichever side is nominally in power.\r\n\r\nThe party leaders have by this time become the general utility men of\r\nthe railroad; they are its agents and factotums. The boss is the handy\r\nman of the capitalist. So long as the people of the town are content\r\nto vote on party lines they cannot get away from the railroad. In\r\nfact, there are no national parties in the town. A man may talk about\r\nthem, but he cannot vote for one of them, because they do not exist.\r\nHe can vote only for or against the railroad; and to do the latter, an\r\nindependent ticket must be nominated.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that any part of the general public clearly\r\nunderstands this situation. The state of mind of the Better Element\r\nof the Republican side has been seen. The good Democrats are equally\r\ndistressed. The distinguished citizen ardently desires to oust the\r\nRepublican ring. He subscribes year after year to the campaign fund\r\nof his own party, and declares that the defalcation of the town\r\ntreasurer has given it the opportunity of a generation. The Democratic\r\norganization takes his money and accepts his moral support, and uses it\r\nto build up one end of the machine. It cries, “Reform! Reform! Give us\r\nback the principles of Jefferson and of Tilden!”\r\n\r\nThe Boss-out-of-Power must welcome all popular movements. He must\r\nsometimes accept a candidate from a citizens’ committee, sometimes\r\nrefuse to do so. He must spread his mainsail to the national party\r\nwind of the moment. His immense advantage is an intellectual one. He\r\nalone knows the principles of the game. He alone sees that the power\r\nof the bosses comes from party loyalty. Croker recently stated his\r\ncase frankly thus: “A man who would desert his party would desert his\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that New York city reached the Happy\r\nFamily stage many years ago. Tammany Hall is in power, being maintained\r\nthere by the great mercantile interests. The Republican party is out\r\nof power, and its organization is kept going by the same interests. It\r\nhas always been the ear-mark of an enterprise of the first financial\r\nmagnitude in New York that it subscribed to both campaign funds. The\r\nRepublican function has been to prevent any one from disturbing Tammany\r\nHall. This has not been difficult; the Republicans have always been\r\nin a hopeless minority, and the machine managers have understood this\r\nperfectly. Now if, by the simple plan of denouncing Tammany Hall,\r\nand appealing to the war record of the Republican party, they could\r\nminimize the independent vote and hold their own constituency, Tammany\r\nwould be safe. The matter is actually more complex than this, but the\r\nprinciple is obvious.\r\n\r\nTo return to our country town. It is easy to see that the railroad\r\nis pouring out its money in the systematic corruption of the entire\r\ncommunity. Even the offices with which it has no contact will be\r\naffected by this corruption. Men put in office because they are tools\r\nwill work as tools only. Voters once bribed will thereafter vote for\r\nmoney only. The subscribing and the voting classes, whose state of mind\r\nis outlined above, are not purely mercenary. The retired grocer, the\r\nflorist, the druggist, are all influenced by mixed motives, in which\r\npersonal interest bears a greater or a smaller share. Each of these men\r\nbelongs to a party, as a Brahmin is born into a caste. His spirit must\r\nsuffer an agony of conversion before he can get free, even if he is\r\npoor. If he has property, he must pay for that conversion by the loss\r\nof money, also.\r\n\r\nSince 1865 the towns throughout the United States have been passing\r\nthrough this stage. A ring was likely to spring up wherever there\r\nwas available capital. We hear a great talk about the failure of our\r\ninstitutions as applied to cities, as if it were our incapacity to\r\ndeal with masses of people and with the problems of city expansion\r\nthat wrecked us. It is nothing of the sort. There is intellect and\r\nbusiness capacity enough in the country to run the Chinese Empire like\r\nclockwork. Philosophers state broadly that our people “prefer to live\r\nin towns,” and cite the rush to the cities during the last thirty\r\nyears. The truth is that the exploitation of the continent could be\r\ndone most conveniently by the assembling of business men in towns; and\r\nhence it is that the worst rings are found in the larger cities. But\r\nthere are rings everywhere; and wherever you see one you will find a\r\nfactory behind it. If the population had remained scattered, commerce\r\nwould have pursued substantially the same course. We should have had\r\nthe rings just the same. It is perfectly true that the wonderful\r\nand scientific concentration of business that we have seen in the\r\npast thirty years gave the chance for the wonderful and scientific\r\nconcentration of its control over politics. The state machine could be\r\nconstructed easily, by consolidating local rings of the same party name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe boss _par excellence_ is a state boss. He is a comparatively\r\nrecent development. He could exist only in a society which had long\r\nbeen preparing for him. He could operate only in a society where\r\nalmost every class and almost every individual was in a certain\r\nsense corrupted. The exact moment of his omnipotence in the State\r\nof New York, for instance, was recorded by the actions of the State\r\nlegislature. Less than ten years ago, the bribing of the legislature\r\nwas done piecemeal and at Albany; and the great corporations of the\r\nState were accustomed to keep separate attorneys in the capitol, ready\r\nfor any emergency. But the economy of having the legislature corrupted\r\nbefore election soon became apparent. If the party organizations\r\ncould furnish a man with whom the corporation managers could contract\r\ndirectly, they and their directors could sleep at night. The state boss\r\nsprang into existence to meet this need. He is a commercial agent,\r\nlike his little local prototype; but the scope of his activities is so\r\ngreat and their directions are so various, the forces that he deals\r\nwith are so complex and his mastery over them is so complete, that a\r\nkind of mystery envelops him. He appears in the newspapers like a demon\r\nof unaccountable power. He is the man who gives his attention to aiding\r\nin the election of the candidates for state office, and to retaining\r\nhis hold upon them after election. His knowledge of local politics\r\nall over a State, and the handling of the very large sums of money\r\nsubscribed by sundry promoters and corporations, explain the miracle of\r\nhis control.\r\n\r\nThe government of a State is no more than a town government over a wide\r\narea. The methods of bribery which work certain general results in a\r\ntown will work similar results in a State. But the scale of operations\r\nis vastly greater. The State-controlled businesses, such as banking,\r\ninsurance, and the State public works, and the liquor traffic, involve\r\nthe expenditure of enormous sums of money.\r\n\r\nThe effect of commercialism on politics is best seen in the state\r\nSystem. The manner of nominating candidates shows how easily the major\r\nforce in a community makes use of its old customs.\r\n\r\nThe American plan of party government provides for primaries, caucuses,\r\nand town, county, and State conventions. It was devised on political\r\nprinciples, and was intended to be a means of working out the will of\r\nthe majority, by a gradual delegation of power from bottom to top. The\r\nexigencies of commerce required that this machinery should be made\r\nto work backwards,--namely, from top to bottom. It was absolutely\r\nnecessary for commerce to have a political dictator; and this was found\r\nto be perfectly easy. Every form and process of nomination is gravely\r\ngone through with, the dictator merely standing by and designating the\r\nofficers and committee-men at every step. There is something positively\r\nEgyptian in the formalism that has been kept up in practice, and in the\r\nstate of mind of men who are satisfied with the procedure.\r\n\r\nThe men who, in the course of a party convention, are doing this\r\nmarching and countermarching, this forming and dissolving into\r\ncommittees and delegations, and who appear like acolytes going through\r\nmystical rites and ceremonies, are only self-seeking men, without a\r\nreal political idea in their heads. Their evolutions are done to be\r\nseen by the masses of the people, who will give them party support if\r\nthese forms are complied with.\r\n\r\nWe all know well another interesting perversion of function. A\r\nlegislator is by political theory a wise, enlightened man, pledged to\r\nintellectual duties. He gives no bonds. He is responsible only under\r\nthe Constitution and to his own conscience. Therefore, if the place\r\nis to be filled by a dummy, almost anybody will do. A town clerk must\r\nbe a competent man, even under boss rule; but a legislator will serve\r\nthe need so long as he is able to say “ay” and “no.” The boss, then,\r\ngoverns the largest and the most complex business enterprise in the\r\nState; and he is always a man of capacity. He is obliged to conduct it\r\nin a cumbersome and antiquated manner, and to proceed at every step\r\naccording to precedent and by a series of fictions. When we consider\r\nthat the legislators and governors are, after all, not absolute\r\ndummies; that among them are ambitious and rapacious men, with here\r\nand there an enemy or a traitor to the boss and to his patrons, we see\r\nthat the boss must be well equipped with the intellect of intrigue. And\r\nremember this: he must keep both himself and his patrons out of jail,\r\nand so far as possible keep them clear of public reprobation.\r\n\r\nWe have not as yet had any national boss, because the necessity for\r\nowning Congress has not as yet become continuous; and the interests\r\nwhich have bought the national legislature at one time or another have\r\ndone it by bribing individuals, in the old-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nTurning now to New York city, we find the political situation very\r\nsimilar to that of the country town already described. The interests\r\nwhich actually control the businesses of the city are managed by very\r\nfew individuals. It is only that the sums involved are different. One\r\nof these men is president of an insurance company whose assets are\r\n$130,000,000; another is president of a system of street railways\r\nwith a capital stock of $30,000,000; another is president of an\r\nelevated road system with a capital of the same amount; a fourth is\r\nvice-president of a paving company worth $10,000,000; a fifth owns\r\n$50,000,000 worth of real estate; a sixth controls a great railroad\r\nsystem; a seventh is president of a savings-bank in which $5,000,000\r\nare deposited; and so on. The commercial ties which bind the community\r\ntogether are as close in the city as in the country town. The great\r\nmagnates live in palaces, and the lesser ones in palaces, also.\r\nThe hardware-dealer of the small town is in New York the owner of\r\niron-works, a man of stainless reputation. The florist is the owner of\r\na large tract of land within the city limits, through which a boulevard\r\nis about to be cut. The retired merchant has become a partner of his\r\nnephew, and is developing one of the suburbs by means of an extension\r\nof an electric road system. But the commercial hierarchy does not stop\r\nhere; it continues radiating, spreading downward. All businesses are\r\nunited by the instruments and usages which the genius of trade has\r\ndevised. All these interests together represent the railroad of the\r\ncountry town. They take no real interest in politics, and they desire\r\nonly to be let alone.\r\n\r\nFor the twenty years before the Strong administration the government\r\nof the city was almost continuously under the control of a ring, or,\r\naccurately speaking, of a Happy Family. Special circumstances made\r\nthis ring well nigh indestructible. The Boss-out-of-Power of the\r\nHappy Family happens to be also the boss of the State legislature.\r\nHe performs a double function. This is what has given Platt his\r\nextraordinary power. It will have been noticed that some of the masses\r\nof wealth above mentioned are peculiarly subject to State legislation:\r\nthey subscribe directly to the State boss’s fund. Some are subject to\r\ninterference from the city administration: they subscribe to the city\r\nboss’s fund.\r\n\r\nWe see that by the receipt of his fund the State boss is rendered\r\nindependent of the people of the city. He can use the State legislature\r\nto strengthen his hands in his dealings with the city boss. After\r\nall, he does not need many votes. He can buy enough votes to hold his\r\nminority together and keep Tammany safely in power, and by now and then\r\ntaking a candidate from the citizens he advertises himself as a friend\r\nof reform.\r\n\r\nAs to the Tammany branch of the concern, the big money interests need\r\nspecific and often illegal advantages, and pay heavily over the Tammany\r\ncounter. But as we saw before, public officers, if once corrupted, will\r\nwork only for money. Every business that has to do with one or another\r\nof the city offices must therefore now contribute for “protection.” A\r\nforeign business that is started in this city subscribes to Tammany\r\nHall as a visitor writes his name in a book at a watering-place. It\r\ngives him the run of the town. In the same way, the State-fearing\r\nbusiness man subscribes to Platt for “protection.” No secret is made of\r\nthese conditions. The business man regards the reformer as a monomaniac\r\nwho is not reasonable enough to see the necessity for his tribute. In\r\nthe conduct of any large business, this form of bribery is as regular\r\nan item as rent. The machinery for such bribery is perfected. It is\r\nonly when some blundering attempt is made by a corporation to do the\r\nbribing itself, when some unbusinesslike attempt is made to get rid of\r\nthe middleman, that the matter is discovered. A few boodle aldermen go\r\nto jail, and every one is scandalized. The city and county officers\r\nof the new city of New York will have to do with the disbursing\r\nof $70,000,000 annually,--fully one half of it in the conduct of\r\nadministration. The power of these officers to affect or even control\r\nvalues, by manipulation of one sort or another, is familiar to us all\r\nfrom experience in the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much for business. Let us look at the law. The most lucrative\r\npractice is that of an attorney who protects great corporate interests\r\namong these breakers. He needs but one client; he gets hundreds. The\r\nmind of the average lawyer makes the same unconscious allowance for\r\nbribery as that of the business man. Moreover, we cannot overlook the\r\ncases of simple old-fashioned bribery to which the masses of capital\r\ngive rise. In a political emergency any amount of money is forthcoming\r\nimmediately, and it is given from aggregations of capital so large that\r\nthe items are easily concealed in the accounts. Bribery, in one form or\r\nanother, is part of the unwritten law. It is atmospheric; it is felt by\r\nno one. The most able men in the community believe that society would\r\ndrop to pieces without bribery. They do not express it in this way,\r\nbut they act upon the principle in an emergency. A leader of the bar,\r\nat the behest of his Wall Street clients, begs the reform police board\r\nnot to remove Inspector Byrnes, who is the Jonathan Wild of the period.\r\nThe bench is fairly able. But many of the judges on the bench have paid\r\nlarge campaign assessments in return for their nominations; others have\r\ngiven notes to the bosses. This reveals the exact condition of things.\r\nIn a corrupt era the judges pay cash. Now they help their friends.\r\nThe son or the son-in-law of a judge is sure of a good practice, and\r\nreferees are appointed from lists which are largely dictated by the\r\nprofessional politicians of both parties.\r\n\r\nIt would require an encyclopædia to state the various simple devices\r\nby which the same principle runs through every department in the life\r\nof the community. Such an encyclopædia for New York city would be the\r\nbest picture of municipal misgovernment in the United States during\r\nthe commercial era. But one main fact must again be noted: this great\r\ncomplex ring is held together by the two campaign funds, the Tammany\r\nHall fund and the Republican fund. They are the two power houses which\r\nrun all this machinery.\r\n\r\nSo far as human suffering goes, the positive evils of the system\r\nfall largely on the poor. The rich buy immunity, but the poor are\r\npersecuted, and have no escape. This has always been the case\r\nunder a tyranny. What else could we expect in New York? The Lexow\r\ninvestigation showed us the condition of the police force. The lower\r\ncourts, both criminal and civil, and the police department were used\r\nfor vote-getting and for money-getting purposes. They were serving\r\nas instruments of extortion and of favoritism. But in the old police\r\ncourts the foreigner and the honest poor were actually attacked.\r\nProcess was issued against them, their business was destroyed, and they\r\nwere jailed unless they could buy off. This system still exists to some\r\nextent in the lower civil courts.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that all these things come to pass through the fault\r\nof no one in particular. We have to-day reached the point where the\r\npublic is beginning to understand that the iniquity is accomplished\r\nby means of the political boss. Every one is therefore abusing the\r\nboss. But Platt and Croker are not worse than the men who continue to\r\nemploy them after understanding their function. These men stand for the\r\nconservative morality of New York, and for standards but little lower\r\nthan the present standards.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how those standards came to exist. Imagine a community\r\nin which, for more than a generation, the government has been\r\ncompletely under boss rule, so that the system has become part of the\r\nhabits and of the thought of the people, and consider what views we\r\nmight expect to find in the hearts of the citizens of such a community.\r\nThe masses will have been controlled by what is really bribery and\r\nterrorism, but what appears in the form of a very plausible appeal to\r\nthe individual on the ground of self-interest. For forty years money\r\nand place have been corrupting them. Their whole conception of politics\r\nis that it is a matter of money and of place. The well-to-do will\r\nhave been apt to prosper in proportion as they have made themselves\r\nserviceable to the dominant powers, and have become part and parcel\r\nof the machinery of the system. It is not to be pretended that every\r\nman in such a community is a rascal, but it is true that in so far as\r\nhis business brings him into contact with the administrative officers\r\nevery man will be put to the choice between lucrative malpractice and\r\nthankless honesty. A conviction will spread throughout the community\r\nthat nothing can be done without a friend at court; that honesty does\r\nnot pay, and probably never has paid in the history of the world;\r\nthat a boss is part of the mechanism by which God governs mankind;\r\nthat property would not be safe without him; and, finally, that the\r\nrecognized bosses are not so bad as they are painted. The great masses\r\nof corporate property have owners who really believe that the system\r\nof government which enabled them to make money is the only safe\r\ngovernment. These people cling to abuses as to a life-preserver. They\r\nfear that an honest police board will not be able to bribe the thieves\r\nnot to steal from them, that an honest State insurance department will\r\nnot be able to prevent the legislature from pillaging them. It is\r\nabsolutely certain that in the first struggles for reform the weight\r\nof the mercantile classes will be thrown very largely on the side of\r\nconservatism.\r\n\r\nNow, in a great city like New York the mercantile _bourgeoisie_\r\nwill include almost every one who has an income of five thousand\r\ndollars a year, or more. These men can be touched by the bosses, and\r\ntherefore, after forty years of tyranny, it is not to be expected\r\nthat many of those who wear black coats will have much enthusiasm\r\nfor reform. It is “impracticable;” it is “discredited;” it is\r\n“expensive;” it is “advocated by unknown men;” it speaks ill of the\r\n“respectable;” it “does harm” by exciting the poor against the rich; it\r\nis “unbusinesslike” and “visionary;” it is “self-righteous.” We have\r\naccordingly had, in New York city, a low and perverted moral tone, an\r\nincapacity to think clearly or to tell the truth when we know it. This\r\nis both the cause and the consequence of bondage. A generation of men\r\nreally believe that honesty is bad policy, and continue to be governed\r\nby Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe world has wondered that New York could not get rid of its famous\r\nincubus. The gross evils as they existed at the time of Tweed are\r\nremembered. The great improvements are not generally known. Reform has\r\nbeen slow, because its leaders have not seen that their work was purely\r\neducational. They did not understand the political combination, and\r\nthey kept striking at Tammany Hall. Like a child with a toy, they did\r\nnot see that the same mechanism which caused Punch to strike caused\r\nJudy’s face to disappear from the window.\r\n\r\nIt is not selfishness and treason that are mainly responsible for the\r\ndiscredit which dogs “reform.” It is the inefficiency of upright and\r\npatriotic men. The practical difficulty with reform movements in New\r\nYork has been that the leaders of such movements have clung to old\r\npolitical methods. These men have thought that if they could hire or\r\nimitate the regular party machinery, they could make it work for good.\r\nThey would fight banditti with bravi. They would expel Tammany Hall,\r\nand lo, Tammany is within them.\r\n\r\nIs it a failure of intellect or of morality which prevents the\r\nreformers from seeing that idealism is the shortest road to their goal?\r\nIt is the failure of both. It is a legacy of the old tyranny. In one\r\nsense it is corruption; in another it is stupidity; in every sense it\r\nis incompetence. Political incompetence is only another name for moral\r\ndegradation, and both exist in New York for the same reason that they\r\nexist in Turkey. They are the offspring of blackmail.\r\n\r\nWell-meaning and public-spirited men, who have been engrossed in\r\nbusiness for the best part of their lives, are perhaps excusable\r\nfor not understanding the principles on which reform moves. Any one\r\ncan see that if what was wanted was merely a good school board, the\r\neasiest way to get it would be to go to Croker, give him a hundred\r\nthousand dollars, and offer to let him alone if he gave the good board.\r\nBut until very recently nobody could see that putting good school\r\ncommissioners on Platt’s ticket and giving Platt the hundred thousand\r\ndollars was precisely the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn an enterprise whose sole aim is to raise the moral standard,\r\nidealism always pays. A reverse following a fight for principle, like\r\nthe defeat of Low, is pure gain. It records the exact state of the\r\ncause. It educates the masses on a gigantic scale. The results of that\r\neducation are immediately visible.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, all compromise means delay. By compromise, the\r\nawakened faith of the people is sold to the politicians for a mess of\r\nreform. The failures and mistakes of Mayor Strong’s administration were\r\namong the causes for Mr. Low’s defeat. People said, “If this be reform,\r\ngive us Tammany Hall.” Our reformers have always been in hot haste\r\nto get results. They want a balance-sheet at the end of every year.\r\nThey think this will encourage the people. But the people recall only\r\ntheir mistakes. The long line of reform leaders in New York city are\r\nremembered with contempt. The evil that men do lives after them; the\r\ngood is oft interred with their bones.\r\n\r\nThat weakness of intellect which makes reformers love quick returns is\r\ntwin brother to a certain defect of character. Personal vanity is very\r\nnatural in men who figure as tribunes of the people. They say, “Look at\r\nAbraham Lincoln, and how he led the people out of the wilderness; let\r\nus go no faster than the people in pushing these reforms; let us accept\r\nhalf-measures; let us be Abraham Lincoln.” The example of Lincoln has\r\nwrecked many a promising young man; for really Lincoln has no more to\r\ndo with the case than Julius Cæsar. As soon as the reformers give up\r\ntrying to be statesmen, and perceive that their own function is purely\r\neducational, and that they are mere anti-slavery agitators and persons\r\nof no account whatever, they will succeed better.\r\n\r\nAs to the methods of work in reform,--whether it shall be by clubs or\r\nby pamphlets, by caucus or by constitution,--they will be developed.\r\nExecutive capacity is simply that capacity which is always found in\r\npeople who really want something done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn New York, the problem is not to oust Tammany Hall; another would\r\narise in a year. It is to make the great public understand the boss\r\nsystem, of which Tammany is only a part. As fast as the reformers\r\nsee that clearly themselves, they will find the right machinery to\r\ndo the work in hand. It may be that, like the Jews, we shall have to\r\nspend forty years more in the wilderness, until the entire generation\r\nthat lived under Pharaoh has perished. But education nowadays marches\r\nquickly. The progress that has been made during the last seven years in\r\nthe city of New York gives hope that within a decade a majority of the\r\nvoters will understand clearly that all the bosses are in league.\r\n\r\nIn 1890, this fact was so little understood by the managers of an\r\nanti-Tammany movement which sprang up in that year that, after raising\r\na certain stir and outcry, they put in the field a ticket made up\r\nexclusively of political hacks, whose election would have left matters\r\nexactly where they stood. The people at large, led by the soundest\r\npolitical instinct, re-elected Tammany Hall, and gave to sham reform\r\nthe rebuff it deserved. In 1894, after the Lexow investigation had\r\nkept the town at fever-heat of indignation all summer, Mayor Strong\r\nwas nominated by the Committee of Seventy, under an arrangement with\r\nPlatt. The excitement was so great that the people at large did not\r\nexamine Mr. Strong’s credentials. He was a Republican merchant, and in\r\nno way identified with the boss system. Mayor Strong’s administration\r\nhas been a distinct advance, in many ways encouraging. Its errors\r\nand weaknesses have been so clearly traceable to the system which\r\nhelped elect him that it has been in the highest degree valuable as an\r\nobject-lesson. In 1895, only one year after Mayor Strong’s election,\r\nthe fruits of his administration could not yet be seen. In that year a\r\nfew judges and minor local officers were to be chosen. By this time the\r\n“citizens’ movement” had become a regular part of a municipal election.\r\nA group of radicals, the legatees of the Strong campaign, had for a\r\nyear been enrolled in clubs called Good Government Clubs. These men\r\ntook the novel course of nominating a complete ticket of their own.\r\nThis was considered a dangerous move by the moderate reformers, who\r\nwere headed by the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce and its\r\nwell-meaning supporters then took a step which, from an educational\r\nstandpoint, turned out to be most important. In their terror lest\r\nTammany Hall should gain the prestige of a by-election, they made an\r\narrangement with Platt, and were allowed to name some candidates on his\r\nticket. This was the famous “fusion,” which the Good Government men\r\nattacked with as much energy as they might have expended on Tammany\r\nHall. A furious campaign of crimination between the two reform factions\r\nfollowed, and of course Tammany was elected.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the Good Government men (the Goo-Goos, as\r\nthey were called) and the Fusionists was entirely one of political\r\neducation. The Goo-Goo mind had advanced to the point of seeing\r\nthat Platt was a confederate of Tammany and represented one wing\r\nof the great machine. To give him money was useless; to lend him\r\nrespectability was infamous. These ideas were disseminated by the\r\npress; and it was immaterial that they were disseminated in the form of\r\ndenunciations of the Good Government Clubs. The people at large began\r\nto comprehend clearly what they had always instinctively believed.\r\nThere was now a nucleus of men in the town who preferred Tammany Hall\r\nto any victory that would discredit reform.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that the Good Government Clubs polled less than one\r\nper cent of the vote cast in that election; and that in the recent\r\nmayoralty campaign the Citizens’ Union ran Mr. Low on the Good\r\nGovernment platform, and polled 150,000 votes. In this same election,\r\nthe straight Republican ticket, headed by Tracy, polled 100,000 votes,\r\nand Tammany polled about as many as both its opponents together. A\r\ntotal of about 40,000 votes were cast for George and other candidates.\r\n\r\nMuch surprise has been expressed that there should be 100,000\r\nRepublicans in New York whose loyalty to the party made them vote a\r\nstraight ticket with the certainty of electing Tammany Hall; but in\r\ntruth, when we consider the history of the city, we ought rather to be\r\nsurprised at the great size of the vote for Mr. Low. He was the man who\r\narranged the fusion of 1895. It was entirely due to a lack of clear\r\nthinking and of political courage that such an arrangement was then\r\nmade. Two years ago the Chamber of Commerce did not clearly understand\r\nthe evils that it was fighting. Is it a wonder that 100,000 individual\r\nvoters are still backward in their education? If we discount the appeal\r\nof self-interest, which determined many of them, there are probably\r\nsome 75,000 Republicans whose misguided party loyalty obscured their\r\nview and deadened their feelings. They cannot be said to hate bad\r\ngovernment very much. They do not think Tammany Hall so very bad, after\r\nall. As the London papers said, the dog has returned to his vomit. It\r\nis unintelligent to abuse them. They are the children of the age. A few\r\nyears ago we were all such as they. Of Mr. Low’s 150,000 supporters,\r\non the other hand, there are probably at least 40,000 who would vote\r\nthrough thick and thin for the principles which his campaign stood for.\r\n\r\nAny one who is a little removed by time or by distance from New York\r\nknows that the city cannot have permanent good government until a\r\nclear majority of our 500,000 voters shall develop what the economists\r\ncall an “effective desire” for it. It is not enough merely to want\r\nreform. The majority must know how to get it. For educational purposes,\r\nthe intelligent discussion throughout the recent campaign is worth\r\nall the effort that it cost. The Low campaign was notable in another\r\nparticular. The banking and the mercantile classes subscribed liberally\r\nto the citizens’ campaign fund. They are the men who have had the most\r\naccurate knowledge of the boss system, because they support it. At last\r\nthey have dared to expose it. Indeed, there was a rent in Wall Street.\r\nThe great capitalists and the promoters backed Tammany and Platt, as a\r\nmatter of course; but many individuals of power and importance in the\r\nstreet came out strongly for Low. They acted at personal risk, with\r\ncourage, out of conscience. The great pendulum of wealth has swung\r\ntoward decency. It is very difficult to use this or any money in the\r\ncause of reform without doing more harm than good. But the money is\r\nnot the main point; the personal influence of the men who give it\r\noperates more powerfully than the money. Hereafter reform will be\r\nrespectable. The professional classes are pouring into it. The young\r\nmen are re-entering politics. Its victory is absolutely certain, and\r\nwill not be distant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe effect of public-spirited activity on the character is very rapid.\r\nHere again we cannot separate the cause from the consequence; but it is\r\ncertain that the moral tone of the community is changing very rapidly\r\nfor the better, and that the thousands of men who are at this moment\r\npreparing to take part in the next citizens’ campaign, and who count\r\npublic activity as one of the regular occupations of their lives, are\r\naffecting the social and commercial life of New York. The young men who\r\nare working to reform politics find in it not only the satisfaction of\r\na religious instinct, but an excitement which business cannot provide.\r\n\r\nOne effect of the commercial supremacy has been to make social life\r\nintolerably dull, by dividing people into cliques and trade unions. The\r\nmillionaire dines with the millionaire, the artist with the artist,\r\nthe hat-maker with the hat-maker, gentlefolk with gentlefolk. All of\r\nthese sets are equally uninspiring, equally frightened at a strange\r\nface. The hierarchy of commerce is dull. The intelligent people in\r\nAmerica are dull, because they have no contact, no social experience.\r\nTheir intelligence is a clique and wears a badge. They think they are\r\nnot affected by the commercialism of the times; but their attitude of\r\nmind is precisely that of a lettered class living under a tyranny. They\r\nflock by themselves. It is certain that the cure for class feeling\r\nis public activity. The young jeweller, the young printer, and the\r\ngolf-player, each, after a campaign in which they have been fighting\r\nfor a principle, finds that social enjoyment lies in working with\r\npeople unlike himself, for a common object. Reform movements bring men\r\ninto touch, into struggle with the powers that are really shaping our\r\ndestinies, and show them the sinews and bones of the social organism.\r\nThe absurd social prejudices which unman the rich and the poor alike\r\nvanish in a six weeks’ campaign. Indeed, the exhilaration of real life\r\nis too much for many of the reformers. Even bankers neglect their\r\nbusiness, and dare not meet their partners, and a dim thought crosses\r\ntheir minds that perhaps the most enlightened way to spend money is,\r\nnot to make it, but to invest their energies directly in life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reasons for believing that the boss system has reached its climax\r\nare manifold. Some of them have been stated, others may be noted. In\r\nthe first place, the railroads are built. Business is growing more\r\nsettled. The sacking of the country’s natural resources goes on at\r\na slower pace. It is a matter of history, that economic laws did so\r\noperate, that the New York Central Railroad controlled the State\r\nlegislature during the period of the building and consolidation of\r\nthe many small roads which make up the present great system. But\r\nthe conditions have changed. Bribery, like any other crime, may be\r\nexplained by an emergency; but everyone believes that bribery is not\r\na permanent necessity in the running of a railroad, and this general\r\nbelief will determine the practices of the future. Public opinion will\r\nnot stand the abuses; and without the abuse where is the profit? In\r\nmany places, the old system of bribery is still being continued out\r\nof habit, and at a loss. The corporations can get what they want\r\nmore cheaply by legal methods, and they are discovering this. In the\r\nsecond place, the boss system is now very generally understood. The\r\npeople are no longer deceived. The ratio between party feeling and\r\nself-interest is changing rapidly, in the mind of the average man.\r\nIt was the mania of party feeling that supported the boss system and\r\nrendered political progress impossible, and party feeling is dying out.\r\nWe have seen, for instance, that those men who, by the accident of the\r\nwar, were shaken in their party loyalty, have been the most politically\r\nintelligent class in the nation. The Northern Democrats, who sided with\r\ntheir opponents to save the Union, were the first men to be weaned of\r\nparty prejudice, and from their ranks, accordingly, came civil service\r\nreformers, tariff reformers, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy, also, that the Jewish mind is active in all reform\r\nmovements. The isolation of the race has saved it from party blindness,\r\nand has given scope to its extraordinary intelligence. The Hebrew\r\nprophet first put his finger on blackmail, as the curse of the world,\r\nand boldly laid the charge at the door of those who profited by the\r\nabuse. It was the Jew who perceived that, in the nature of things,\r\nthe rich and the powerful in a community will be trammelled up and\r\nidentified with the evils of the times. The wrath of the Hebrew\r\nprophets and the arraignments of the New Testament owe part of their\r\neternal power to their recognition of that fact. They record an\r\neconomic law.\r\n\r\nMoreover, time fights for reform. The old voters die off, and the young\r\nmen care little about party shibboleths. Hence these non-partisan\r\nmovements. Every election, local or national, which causes a body of\r\nmen to desert their party is a blow at the boss system. These movements\r\nmultiply annually. They are emancipating the small towns throughout the\r\nUnion, even as commerce was once disfranchising them. As party feeling\r\ndies out in a man’s mind, it leaves him with a clearer vision. His\r\nconscience begins to affect his conduct very seriously, when he sees\r\nthat a certain course is indefensible. It is from this source that the\r\nreform will come.\r\n\r\nThe voter will see that it is wrong to support the subsidized boss,\r\njust as the capitalist has already begun to recoil from the monster\r\nwhich he created. He sees that it is wrong at the very moment when he\r\nis beginning to find it unprofitable. The old trademark has lost its\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe citizens’ movement is, then, a purge to take the money out of\r\npolitics. The stronger the doses, the quicker the cure. If the citizens\r\nmaintain absolute standards, the old parties can regain their popular\r\nsupport only by adopting those standards. All citizens’ movements are\r\ndestined to be temporary; they will vanish, to leave our politics\r\npurified. But the work they do is as broad as the nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question of boss rule is of national importance. The future of the\r\ncountry is at stake. Until this question is settled, all others are in\r\nabeyance. The fight against money is a fight for permission to decide\r\nquestions on their merits. The last presidential election furnished an\r\nillustration of this. At a private meeting of capitalists held in New\r\nYork City, to raise money for the McKinley campaign, a very important\r\nman fervidly declared that he had already subscribed $5000 to “buy\r\nIndiana,” and that if called on to do so he would subscribe $5000\r\nmore! He was greeted with cheers for his patriotism. Many of our best\r\ncitizens believe not only that money bought that election, but that\r\nthe money was well spent, because it averted a panic. These men do not\r\nbelieve in republican institutions; they have found something better.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the situation in New York city. The men who\r\nsubscribed to the McKinley campaign fund are the same men who support\r\nTammany Hall. In 1896 they cried, “We cannot afford Bryan and his\r\npanic!” In 1897 the same men in New York cried, “We cannot afford Low\r\nand reform!” That is what was decided in each case. Yet it is quite\r\npossible that the quickest, wisest, and cheapest way of dealing with\r\nBryan would have been to allow him and his panic to come on,--fighting\r\nthem only with arguments, which immediate consequences would have\r\ndriven home very forcibly. That is the way to educate the masses and\r\nfit them for self-government; and it is the only way.\r\n\r\nIn this last election the people of New York have crippled Platt.\r\nIt is a service done to the nation. Its consequences are as yet not\r\nunderstood; for the public sees only the gross fact that Tammany is\r\nagain in power.\r\n\r\nBut the election is memorable. It is a sign of the times. The grip of\r\ncommerce is growing weaker, the voice of conscience louder. A phase\r\nin our history is passing away. That phase was predestined from the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe war did no more than intensify existing conditions, both commercial\r\nand political. It gave sharp outlines to certain economic phenomena,\r\nand made them dramatic. It is due to the war that we are now able to\r\ndisentangle the threads and do justice to the nation.\r\n\r\nThe corruption that we used to denounce so fiercely and understand\r\nso little was a phase of the morality of an era which is already\r\nvanishing. It was as natural as the virtue which is replacing it; it\r\nwill be a curiosity almost before we have done studying it. We see\r\nthat our institutions were particularly susceptible to this disease of\r\ncommercialism, and that the sickness was acute, but that it was not\r\nmortal. Our institutions survived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nOur institutions have survived, the perils of boss rule are past, and\r\nwe may look back upon the system with a kind of awe, and recognize how\r\neasily the system might have overthrown our institutions and ushered\r\nin a period which history would have recorded as the age of the State\r\nTyrants.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine that some State like Pennsylvania, on which the boss\r\nsystem had been so firmly fixed that a boss was able to bequeath\r\nhis seat in the United States Senate to his son, had shown forth an\r\nambitious man, a ruler who realized that his function was not one of\r\nbusiness, but one of government; let us imagine that a President of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Railroad, some man of great capacity, had undertaken\r\nto rule the State. He would, by his position as State boss, have been\r\nable gradually to do away with the petty bosses and petty abuses. He\r\nwould give the State a general cities law, good schools, clean streets,\r\nspeedy justice; every necessary municipal improvement. Gas, water,\r\nboulevards would be supplied with an economy positively startling to a\r\ngeneration accustomed to jobs. He would destroy the middlemen as Louis\r\nXI. destroyed the nobles, and give to his State, for the first time in\r\nthe history of the country, good government. A benign tyranny, with\r\nevery department in the hands of experts, makes the strongest form of\r\ngovernment in the world. Every class is satisfied. Pennsylvania would\r\nhave been famous the world over. Its inhabitants would have been proud\r\nof it; foreigners would have written books about it; other States would\r\nhave imitated it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the power of self-government would have been lost.\r\n\r\nBiennial sessions of the Legislature are already a favorite device\r\nfor minimizing the evils of Legislatures. But the dictator would have\r\ndesired to discourage popular assemblies. The whole business world\r\nwould have backed the boss, in his plan for quinquennial or decennial\r\nsessions. Once give way to the laziness, once cater to the inertia and\r\nselfishness of the citizen, and he sinks into slumber.\r\n\r\nOur feeble and floundering citizens’ movements in New York during\r\nthe last ten years show us how hard it is to recover the power of\r\nself-government when once lost; how gradual the gain, even under the\r\nmost stimulating conditions of misrule. Given thirty years of able\r\nadministration by a single man, and the boss system would have sunk\r\nso deep into the popular mind, the arctic crust of prejudice and\r\nincompetence would have frozen so deep, that it might easily take two\r\nhundred years for the community to come to life. Recovery could only\r\ncome through the creeping in of abuses, through the decentralization of\r\nthe great tyranny. And as each abuse arose, the population would clamor\r\nto the dictator and beg him to correct it. After a while a few thinkers\r\nwould arise who would see that the only way to revive our institutions\r\nwas by the painstaking education of the people. The stock in trade of\r\nthese teachers would be the practical abuses, and very often they would\r\nbe obliged to urge upon the people a course which would make the abuses\r\ntemporarily more acute.\r\n\r\nWe have escaped an age of tyrants, because the eyes of the bosses and\r\ntheir masters were fixed on money. They were not ambitious. Government\r\nwas an annex to trade. To certain people the boss appears as a ruler\r\nof men. If proof were needed that he is a hired man employed to do the\r\ndirty work of others, what better proof could we have than this: No one\r\nof all the hundreds of bosses thrown up during the last thirty years\r\nhas ever lifted himself out of his sphere, or even essayed to rule.\r\n\r\nThat devotion of the individual to his bank account which created\r\nthe boss and saved us from the dictator must now be traced back into\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the sake of analysis it is convenient now to separate and again not\r\nto separate the influences of business proper from the influences of\r\ndishonesty, but in real life they are one thing. Dishonesty is a mere\r\nresult of excessive devotion to money-making. The general and somewhat\r\nindefinite body of rules which are considered “honest” change from\r\ntime to time. I call a thing dishonest when it offends my instinct.\r\nThe next man may call it honest. The question is settled by society\r\nat large. “What can a man do and remain in his club?” That gives the\r\npractical standards of a community. The devotion of the individual to\r\nhis bank account gives the reason why the financier and his agent, the\r\nboss, could always find councilmen, legislators, judges, lawyers, to\r\nbe their jackals, or to put the equation with the other end first, it\r\nis the reason why the legislators could always combine to blackmail the\r\ncapitalist: this political corruption is a mere spur and offshoot of\r\nour business corruption. We know more about it, because politics cannot\r\nbe carried on wholly in the dark. Business can. The main facts are\r\nknown. Companies organize subsidiary companies to which they vote the\r\nmoney of the larger company--cheating their stockholders. The railroad\r\nmen get up small roads and sell them to the great roads which they\r\ncontrol--cheating their stockholders. The purchasing agents of many\r\ngreat enterprises cheat the companies as a matter of course, not by a\r\nrecognized system of commissions--like French cooks--but by stealth. So\r\nin trade, you cannot sell goods to the retailers, unless you corrupt\r\nthe proper person. It is all politics. All our politics is business and\r\nour business is politics.\r\n\r\nThere is something you want to do, and the “practical man” is the man\r\nwho knows the ropes, knows who is the proper person to be “seen.” The\r\nslang word gives a picture of the times--to “see” a man means to bribe\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut let no one think that dishonesty or anything else begins at the\r\ntop. These big business men were once little business men.\r\n\r\nTo cut rates, to have a different price for each customer, to\r\nsubstitute one article for another, are the prevailing policies of\r\nthe seller. To give uncollectible notes, to claim rebates, to make\r\nassignments and compromises, to use one shift or another in order to\r\nget possession of goods and pay less than the contract price, are the\r\nprevailing aims of the buyer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionably possible for an incorruptible man to succeed in\r\nbusiness. But his scruples are an embarrassment. Not everybody wants\r\nsuch a man. He insists on reducing every reckoning to pounds sterling,\r\nwhile the rest of the world is figuring in maravedis. He must make up\r\nin ability what he lacks in moral obliquity.\r\n\r\nHe will no doubt find his nook in time. Honesty is the greatest luxury\r\nin the world, and the American looks with awe on the man who can afford\r\nit, or insists upon having it. It is right that he should pay for it.\r\n\r\nThe long and short of the matter is that the sudden creation of\r\nwealth in the United States has been too much for our people. We are\r\npersonally dishonest. The people of the United States are notably and\r\npeculiarly dishonest in financial matters.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this on government is but one of the forms in which the\r\nruling passion is manifest. “What is there in it for me?” is the state\r\nof mind in which our people have been existing. Out of this come the\r\npopular philosophy, the social life, the architecture, the letters, the\r\ntemper of the age; all tinged with the passion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us look at the popular philosophy of the day. An almost ludicrous\r\ndisbelief that any one can be really disinterested is met at once.\r\nAny one who takes an intelligent interest in public affairs becomes\r\na “reformer.” He is liked, if it can be reasonably inferred that he\r\nis advancing his own interests. Otherwise he is incomprehensible. He\r\nis respected, because it is impossible not to respect him, but he is\r\nregarded as a mistaken fellow, a man who interferes with things that\r\nare not his business, a meddler.\r\n\r\nThe unspoken religion of all sensible men inculcates thrift as the\r\nfirst virtue. Business thunders at the young man, “Thou shalt have\r\nnone other gods but me.” Nor is it a weak threat, for business,\r\nwhen it speaks, means business. The young doctor in the small town\r\nwho advocates reform loses practice for two reasons: first, because\r\nit is imagined that he is not a serious man, not a good doctor, if\r\nhe gives time to things outside his profession; second, because the\r\ncarriage-maker does not agree with him and regards it as a moral\r\nduty to punish him. The newsdealer in the Arcade at Rector Street\r\nlost custom because it was discovered that he was a Bryan man. The\r\nbankers would not buy papers of him. Since the days of David, the\r\ngreat luxury of the powerful has been to be free from the annoyance of\r\nother persons’ opinions. The professional classes in any community are\r\nparasites on the moneyed classes; they attend the distribution. They\r\ncannot strike the hand that feeds them. In a country where economic\r\nlaws tend to throw the money into the hands of a certain type of men,\r\nthe morality of those men is bound to affect society very seriously.\r\n\r\nThe world-famous “timidity” of Americans in matters of opinion, is the\r\noutward and visible sign of a mental preoccupation. Tocqueville thought\r\nit was due to their democratic form of government. It is not due to\r\ndemocracy, but to commercial conditions. In Tocqueville’s day it arose\r\nout of the slavery question, solely because that question affected\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nIn describing the social life of Boston, Josiah Quincy says of George\r\nTicknor’s hospitality: “There seemed to be a cosmopolitan spaciousness\r\nabout his very vestibule. He received company with great ease, and a\r\nsimple supper was always served to his evening visitors. Prescott,\r\nEverett, Webster, Hillard, and other noted Bostonians well mixed with\r\nthe pick of such strangers as happened to be in the city, furnished a\r\nsocial entertainment of the first quality. Politics, at least American\r\npolitics, were never mentioned.”\r\n\r\nIt was at such “entertainments” as this that the foreign publicists\r\nreceived their impressions as to the extinction of free speech in\r\nAmerica. Politics could not be mentioned; but this was not due to our\r\ndemocratic form of government, but to the fact that Beacon Street was\r\ntrading with South Carolina. “Politics” meant slavery, and Beacon\r\nStreet could not afford to have values disturbed--not even at a dinner\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that our more recent misgovernment has not been due to\r\ndemocracy, and we now see that the most striking weakness of our social\r\nlife is not and never has been due to democracy.\r\n\r\nLet us take an example: A party of men meet in a club, and the subject\r\nof free trade is launched. Each of these men has been occupied all day\r\nin an avocation where silence is golden. Shall he be the one to speak\r\nfirst? Who knows but what some phase of the discussion may touch his\r\npocket? But the matter is deeper. Free speech is a habit. It cannot\r\nbe expected from such men, because a particular subject is free from\r\ndanger. Let the subject be dress reform, and the traders will be\r\nequally politic.\r\n\r\nThis pressure of self-interest which prevents a man from speaking his\r\nmind comes on top of that familiar moral terrorism of any majority,\r\neven a majority of two persons against one, which is one of the\r\nultimate phenomena of human intercourse.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to speak out a sentiment that your table companions\r\ndisapprove of. Even Don Quixote was afraid to confess that it was he\r\nwho had set the convicts at liberty, because he heard the barber and\r\ncurate denounce the thing as an outrage. Now the weight of this normal\r\nsocial pressure in any particular case will depend on how closely\r\nthe individuals composing the majority resemble each other. But men,\r\nlighted by the same passion, pursuing one object under the similar\r\nconditions, of necessity grow alike. By a process of natural selection,\r\nthe self-seekers of Europe have for sixty years been poured into the\r\nhopper of our great mill. The Suabian and the Pole each drops his\r\ncostume, his language, and his traditions as he goes in. They come out\r\nAmerican business men; and in the second generation they resemble each\r\nother more closely in ideals, in aims, and in modes of thought than two\r\nbrothers who had been bred to different trades in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe uniformity of occupation, the uniformity of law, the absence of\r\ninstitutions, like the church, the army, family pride, in fact, the\r\nuniformity of the present and the sudden evaporation of all the past,\r\nhave ground the men to a standard.\r\n\r\nAmerica turns out only one kind of man. Listen to the conversation\r\nof any two men in a street car. They are talking about the price of\r\nsomething--building material, advertising, bonds, cigars.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, two distinct kinds of pressure, each at its maximum,\r\nboth due to commerce: the pressure of fear that any unpopular sentiment\r\na man utters will show in his bank account; the pressure of a unified\r\nmajority who are alike in their opinions, have no private opinions, nor\r\npatience with the private opinions of others. Of these two pressures,\r\nthe latter is by far the more important.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the catchwords of democracy have been used to\r\nintensify this tyranny. If the individual must submit when outvoted in\r\npolitics, he ought to submit when outvoted in ethics, in opinion, or in\r\nsentiment. Private opinion is a thing to be stamped out, like private\r\nlaw. A prejudice is aroused by the very fact that a man thinks for\r\nhimself; he is dangerous; he is anarchistic.\r\n\r\nBut this misapplication of a dogma is not the cause but the cloak of\r\noppression. It is like the theory of the divine right of Kings--a\r\nthing invoked by conservatism to keep itself in control, a shibboleth\r\nmuttered by men whose cause will not bear argument.\r\n\r\nWe must never expect to find in a dogma the explanation of the system\r\nwhich it props up. That explanation must be sought for in history.\r\nThe dogma records but does not explain a supremacy. Therefore, when\r\nwe hear some one appeal to democratic principle for a justification\r\nin suppressing the individual, we have to reflect how firmly must\r\nthis custom be established, upon what a strong basis of interest must\r\nit rest, that it has power so to pervert the ideas of democracy. A\r\ndistrust of the individual running into something like hatred may\r\nbe seen reflected in the press of the United States. The main point\r\nis that Americans have by business training been growing more alike\r\nevery day, and have seized upon any and every authority to aid them in\r\ndisciplining a recusant.\r\n\r\nWe have then a social life in which caution and formalism prevail, and\r\ncan see why it is that the gathering at the club was a dull affair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must now add one dreadful fact: Many of these men at the club\r\nare dishonest. The banker has come from a Directors’ meeting of a\r\nlarge corporation, where he has voted to buy ten thousand shares of\r\nrailroad stock which he and his associates bought on foreclosure at\r\nseventeen three weeks before, but which now stands at thirty, because\r\nthe quotations have been rigged. The attorney for the corporation is\r\nhere talking to Professor Scuddamore about the new citizens’ movement,\r\nwhich the attorney has joined, for he is a great reformer, and lives\r\nin horror of the wickedness of the times. Beyond him sits an important\r\nman, whose corporation has just given a large sum to a political\r\norganization. Next to him is a Judge, who is a Republican, but fond of\r\na chat with political opponents. With them is the editor of a reform\r\npaper, whose financial articles are of much importance to the town.\r\nA very eminent lawyer is in conversation with him. This lawyer has\r\njust received a large fee from the city for work which would not have\r\nbrought him more than one-fifth of the amount if done for a private\r\nclient. He is, by the way, a law partner of the latest tribune of the\r\npeople, a man of stainless reputation. Here is also another type of\r\nhonor, the middle-aged practitioner of good family, who has one of the\r\nbest heads in town. He knows what all these other men are, and how\r\nthey make their money; yet he dines at their houses, and gets business\r\nfrom them. On his left is a man much talked of ten years ago, a rare\r\nman to be seen here. He was ambitious, and became the hope of reform.\r\nBut, unfortunately, he also had a talent for business. He became rich\r\nand cynical, and you see that he is looking about, as if in search of\r\nanother disappointed man to talk to. There also is a great doctor,\r\nvisiting physician of three hospitals, one of which is in receipt\r\nof city funds, and he knows the practice of packing the hospitals\r\nbefore inspection day in order to increase the appropriation. The man\r\nwho endowed the hospital sits beyond. All these wires end in this\r\nclub-room. Now start your topic--jest about free silver, make a merry\r\nsally on Mayor Jones. Start the question: “Why is not the last reform\r\ncommissioner of the gas works not in jail?” and see what a jovial crew\r\nyou are set down with.\r\n\r\nYou will find as to any new topic, that each one requires time to\r\nadjust his cravat to it. You are in a company of men who are so anxious\r\nto be reasonable, to be “just,” that it will require them till judgment\r\nday to make up their minds on any point. Nor is it easy to say how any\r\none of them ought to behave. Is it dishonest to draw dividends from\r\na corporation which you believe to be corruptly managed; to wink at\r\nbribery done in the interest of widows and of orphans? Must you cut a\r\nclient because he owns a judge? What proof have you of any of these\r\nthings? Do you demand of any one of these men that he shall offend or\r\ndenounce the rest, and, short of that, what course should he take?\r\n\r\nThe point here made is not an ethical one as to how any one of these\r\nmen ought to adjust himself to the corruption about him, but the\r\nsociological point--that a civilization based upon a commerce which is\r\nin all its parts corruptly managed will present a social life which is\r\nunintelligent and mediocre, made up of people afraid of each other,\r\nwhose ideas are shopworn, whose manners are self-conscious.\r\n\r\nThe ill-concealed dependence of these men on each other is not\r\nresentful. They are the most good-natured men in the world. But\r\nthey are unenlightened. Without free speech free thought can hardly\r\nexist. Without free speech you cannot gather the fruits of the mind’s\r\nspontaneous workings. When a man talks with absolute sincerity and\r\nfreedom he goes on a voyage of discovery. The whole company has shares\r\nin the enterprise. He may strike out some idea which explains the\r\nsphinx. The moral consequences of circumspect and affable reticence are\r\neven worse than the intellectual ones. “Live and let live,” says our\r\ngenial prudence. Well enough, but mark the event. No one ever lost his\r\nsocial standing merely because of his offences, but because of the talk\r\nabout them. As free speech goes out the rascals come in.\r\n\r\nSpeech is a great part of social life, but not the whole of it. Dress,\r\nbearing, expression, betray a man, customs show character, all these\r\nvarious utterances mingle and merge into the general tone which is the\r\nvoice of a national temperament; private motive is lost in it.\r\n\r\nThis tone penetrates and envelops everything in America. It is\r\nimpossible to condemn it altogether. This desire to please, which has\r\nso much of the shopman’s smile in it, graduates at one end of the scale\r\ninto a general kindliness, into public benefactions, hospitals, and\r\ncollege foundations; at the other end it is seen melting into a desire\r\nto efface one’s self rather than give offence, to hide rather than be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the men in the pit at the theatre stand up between the acts,\r\nface the house, and examine the audience at leisure. The American\r\ndares not do this. He cannot stand the isolation, nor the publicity.\r\nThe American in a horse car can give his seat to a lady, but dares\r\nnot raise his voice while the conductor tramps over his toes. It\r\nviolates every instinct of his commercial body to thrust his private\r\nconcerns into prominence. The American addresses his equal, whom he\r\nknows familiarly, as Mr. Jones, giving him the title with as much\r\nsubserviency as the Englishman pays to an unknown Earl.\r\n\r\nMere financial dishonesty is of very little importance in the history\r\nof civilization. Who cares whether Cæsar stole or Cæsar Borgia cheated?\r\nTheir intellects stayed clear. The real evil that follows in the wake\r\nof a commercial dishonesty so general as ours is the intellectual\r\ndishonesty it generates. One need not mind stealing, but one must cry\r\nout at people whose minds are so befuddled that they do not know theft\r\nwhen they see it. Robert Walpole bought votes. He deceived others, but\r\nhe did not deceive himself.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the retailer in the small town could not afford\r\nto think clearly upon the political situation. But this was a mere\r\ninstance, a sample of his mental attitude. He dare not face any\r\nquestion. He must shuffle, qualify, and defer. Here at last we\r\nhave the great characteristic which covers our continent like a\r\nclimate--intellectual dishonesty. This state of mind does not merely\r\nprevent a man having positive opinions. The American is incapable\r\nof taking a real interest in anything. The lack of passion in the\r\nAmerican--noticeable in his books and in himself--comes from the same\r\nhabitual mental distraction; for passion is concentration. Hence also\r\nthe flippancy, superficiality, and easy humor for which we are noted.\r\nNothing except the dollar is believed to be worthy the attention of a\r\nserious man. People are even ashamed of their tastes. Until recently,\r\nwe thought it effeminate for a man to play on the piano. When a man\r\ntakes a living interest in anything, we call him a “crank.” There is\r\nan element of self-sacrifice in any honest intellectual work which we\r\ndetect at once and score with contumely.\r\n\r\nIt was not solely commercial interest that made the biographers of\r\nLincoln so thrifty to extend and veneer their book. It was that they\r\nthemselves did not, could not, take an interest in the truth about\r\nhim. The second-rate quality of all our letters and verse is due to\r\nthe same cause. The intellectual integrity is undermined. The literary\r\nman is concerned for what “will go,” like the reformer who is half\r\npolitician. The attention of every one in the United States is on some\r\none else’s opinion, not on truth.\r\n\r\nThe matter resolves itself at last into Pilate’s question: What is\r\ntruth? We do not know, and shall never know. But it seems to involve a\r\ncertain focussing and concentration of the attention that brings all\r\nthe life within us into harmony. When this happens to us, we discover\r\nthat truth is the only thing we had ever really cared about in the\r\nworld. The thing seems to be the same thing, no matter which avenue we\r\nreach it by. At whatever point we are touched, we respond. A quartet, a\r\ncathedral, a sonnet, an exhibition of juggling, anything well done--we\r\nare at the mercy of it. But as the whole of us responds to it, so it\r\ntakes a whole man to do it. Whatever cracks men up and obliterates\r\nparts of them, makes them powerless to give out this vibration. This is\r\nabout all we know of individualism and the integrity of the individual.\r\nThe sum of all the philosophies in the history of the world can be\r\npacked back into it. All the tyrannies and abuses in the world are only\r\nbad because they injure this integrity. We desire truth. It is the only\r\nthing we desire. To have it, we must develop the individual. And there\r\nare practical ways and means of doing this. We see that all our abuses\r\nare only odious because they injure some individual man’s spirit. We\r\ncan trace the corruption of politics into business, and find private\r\nselfishness at the bottom of it. We can see this spread out into a\r\nnetwork of invisible influence, in the form of intellectual dishonesty\r\nblighting the minds of our people. We can look still closer and see\r\njust why and how the temperament of the private man is expressed.\r\n\r\nWe study this first in social life; for social life is the source and\r\nfountain of all things. The touchstone for any civilization is what one\r\nman says to another man in the street. Everything else that happens\r\nthere bears a traceable relation to the tone of his voice. The press\r\nreflects it, the pulpit echoes it, the literature reproduces it, the\r\narchitecture embodies it.\r\n\r\nThe rays of force which start in material prosperity pass through\r\nthe focus of social life, and extend out into literature, art,\r\narchitecture, religion, philosophy. All these things are but the\r\nsparks thrown off the gestures and gaits, the records of the social\r\nlife of some civilization. That is the reason why it has been useful\r\nto pause over a club-house and study its inmates. The ball-room, the\r\ndinner-table, would have been equally instructive. The deference\r\nto reigning convention is the same everywhere. The instinct of\r\nself-concealment, the policy of classing like with like, leads to\r\nthe herding of the young with the young only, the sporting with the\r\nsporting only, the rich with the rich only, which is the bane of our\r\nsociety. The suffocation is mitigated here and there by the influence\r\nof ambitious and educated women. They are doing their best to stem the\r\ntide which they can neither control nor understand. The stratification\r\nof our society, and its crystallization into social groups, is little\r\nshort of miraculous, considering the lightning changes of scene. The\r\n_nouveaux riches_ of one decade are the old _noblesse_ of the\r\nnext decade, and yet any particular set, at any particular time, has\r\nits exclusions, its code of hats and coats and small talk, which are\r\nmore rigid than those of London.\r\n\r\nThe only place in the country where society is not dull is Washington,\r\nbecause in Washington politics have always forced the social elements\r\nto mix; because in Washington, some embers of the old ante-bellum\r\nsociety survived; because the place has no commerce, and because the\r\nforeign diplomats have been a constant factor, educating the Americans\r\nin social matters. But Washington is not the centre of American\r\ncivilization. The controlling force in American life is not in its\r\npolitics, but in commerce. New York is the head and heart of the United\r\nStates. Chicago is America. And the elements of this life must be\r\nsought, as always, in the small towns. Find the social factors which\r\nare common to New York, to Poughkeepsie, and to Newport, and you have\r\nthe keynote to the country. We began with a city club. But it would\r\nhave made no difference what gathering we entered--a drawing-room at\r\nNewport, a labor union in Fifteenth Street--we should have found the\r\nsame phenomena,--formalism, suppression of the individual, intellectual\r\ndishonesty.\r\n\r\nThe dandy at Newport who conscientiously follows his leaders and\r\nobserves the cab rule, the glove ordinance, and the mystery of the\r\noyster fork, is governed by the same law, is fettered by the same\r\nforce, as the labor man who fears to tell his fellows that he approves\r\nof Waring’s clean streets. Each is a half-man, each is afraid of his\r\nfellows, and for the same reason. Each is commercial, keeps his place\r\nby conciliatory methods, and will be punished for contumacy by the\r\nloss of his job. Neither of them has an independent opinion upon any\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe charge brought against our millionaire society is that it is\r\nvulgar. The houses are palaces, the taste is for the most part\r\nexcellent, the people are in every sense but the commercial sense more\r\nvirtuous than the rich of any other nation. Wealth is poured out in\r\navalanches.\r\n\r\nWhy is all this display not magnificent? The millionaire society is not\r\nvulgar, but it is insignificant. The reason is, that you cannot have\r\nsplendor without personal and intellectual independence, and this does\r\nnot exist in America. The conversation on the Commodore’s steam yacht\r\nis tedious. The talk at the weekly meeting of the amalgamated glaziers\r\nis insipid, and impresses you with the selfishness of mankind.\r\n\r\nNow what is at the bottom of this identity? We are passing through the\r\ngreat age of distribution. It is not confined to America. It qualifies\r\nEuropean history. All the different kinds of Socialism are mere proofs\r\nof it. Every one either wants to get something himself, or, if he is\r\na philosopher, wants to show other people how to get it. Even Henry\r\nGeorge thought that man lives by bread alone; at least, he thought\r\nthat if you only give every one lots of bread, that is all you need\r\nprovide for; the rest will follow. In America we are leading the world\r\nin the intensity with which this phase of progress goes on, because in\r\nAmerica there is nothing else to occupy men’s minds. Let us return to\r\nour social focus and its relation to the arts.\r\n\r\nThe world has groped for three thousand years to find the connection\r\nbetween morality and the fine arts. It may be that we stand here on the\r\nborderland of discovery. We can at least see that they are not likely\r\nto arise in an era of subserviency and intellectual fog.\r\n\r\nThe fine arts are departments of science, and the attitude of mind of\r\nthe artist toward his work, or of the public toward his product, is\r\nthat of an interest in truth for its own sake. It is the attitude of\r\nthe scientific man toward his problems. The scientists do not waver or\r\ncringe. They are the great bullies of this era. They draw their power\r\nfrom their work. They seek, they proclaim, they monopolize truth. There\r\nis in them the note of greatness, not because of their discoveries, but\r\nbecause of their pursuit.\r\n\r\nCommercial or sexual crime or violence, that does not unman the\r\nartist, ought not to extinguish art, and it never has done so. Anything\r\nthat has made him time-serving or truthless ought to show in his work,\r\nand it always has done so.\r\n\r\nAny system of morality or conjunction of circumstances that tends to\r\nmake men tell the truth as they see it will tend to produce what the\r\nworld will call art. If the statement be accurate, the world will call\r\nit beautiful. Put it as you will, art is self-assertion and beauty is\r\naccuracy. Out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh.\r\n\r\nAnybody can see that fiction depends upon social conditions; for it is\r\nnothing but a description of them.\r\n\r\nTake his clubs and his routs away from Thackeray, his hunting away from\r\nWhite-Melville, his peasantry away from Scott, his street life away\r\nfrom Dickens, and where would their books be? Vigorous and picturesque\r\nindividuality must precede good fiction. The great American novel,\r\nexcept as the outcome of a vigorous social life, is the dream of an\r\nidiot. You must have an age of ebullition, where the spontaneous life\r\nabout the novelist forces itself into his books, before you can have\r\ngood fiction. Architecture depends so plainly upon social life, that\r\nwe have only to look at our country houses from Colonial times down,\r\nto read the hearts of the inmates. And so with the other fine arts and\r\ndecorations, they are mere languages.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that our modern life is more complex than that of the\r\neighteenth century, because the machinery by which it is carried on is\r\nexpanded. Transportation, newspapers, corporations, oceans of books\r\nand magazines, foreign cables, have changed the forms by which power\r\nis transmitted. But the manifestations of humanity in government, in\r\nsocial life, and in the arts proceed upon the same principles as ever.\r\nEverything depends as completely on personal intercourse as it did in\r\nAthens. The real struggle comes between two men across a table, my\r\nforce against your force. The devices which political philosophy has\r\nalways approved, are those which protect the spirit of the individual,\r\nand enable it to grow strong. The struggles for English liberty have\r\nbeen struggles over taxation. The rights of the sovereign to seize\r\na man’s property, or imprison his body without form of law, were\r\nabolished. This comparative financial independence of the English\r\nsubject has been valued as the basis of spiritual independence. It\r\nhas no other claim to be thought important. Yet while we have been\r\npraising our bills of rights and bulwarks of liberty, commerce in the\r\nUnited States has been bringing power after power, battalion after\r\nbattalion, to bear upon the integrity of spirit of the individual man.\r\nHere is a situation which no legislation can meet. Civil liberty has\r\nbeen submerged in the boss system. But this is a mere symptom. It is\r\nvaluable only because it brings strikingly into view the intellectual\r\nbondage it denotes. It is valuable only because it gives us a fighting\r\nground, an educational arena in which the fight for intellectual\r\nliberty may be begun.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to go over the steps of the argument backward, and to\r\nshow how our citizen movements are a mere sign that the individual is\r\nbecoming more unselfish. How, partly through the settling of commerce\r\ninto more stable conditions, partly through revulsion in the heart of\r\nman against so much wickedness, a reign of better things is coming.\r\nThe Christian Endeavorers, the University Settlements, the innumerable\r\nleagues and propaganda which bring no dogmas, but which stand for\r\nfaith--speak for multitudes, affect every one. Their influence can\r\nalready be traced into business, into social life, and out again into\r\nevery department of our existence. The revolution is going forward on a\r\ngreat scale, and the demonstration is about to be worked out throughout\r\nthe continent as if it were a blackboard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe man who has subscribed $1,000 to the reform campaign, the man\r\nwho has worked for the cause, and the man who has voted the ticket,\r\nhave met. This personal meeting, this social focus, exists and is\r\nindestructible. These people who have been kept apart by the old\r\npolitical conditions, by the boss system, and the capitalist; these\r\nmen whom every element of selfishness and corruption fought with the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation to keep separate, have come together.\r\nThe downfall of the old social system, and the redistribution of every\r\nforce in the community, is inevitable. In the first place, every\r\nindividual in the community has talked about the movement with an\r\nintensity proportionate to his power of good. Our form of government\r\nthrows the moral idea with terrible force, as a practical issue, into\r\nthe life of each man. “Thou art the man.” The extreme simplicity of\r\nour social fabric makes it impossible for any one to get behind his\r\ninstitution, his class, his prejudice. There is no one who cannot\r\nbe shown up. We are as defenceless before virtue as we were before\r\nselfishness. Our politics can be worked as effectively by one passion\r\nas by the other--but we are only just beginning to find this out.\r\n\r\nFree speech and the grouping, classing, and mingling of men according\r\nto intellect, and not according to income, have begun already. They\r\nare not more the outcome than they are the cause of these citizens’\r\nmovements. They are the same elemental thing. The love of truth is the\r\nsame passion as the veneration for the individual. It is impossible\r\nto really want reform and to remain socially exclusive or socially\r\ndeferential. And so, a social life is beginning to emerge in New York,\r\nbased on the noblest and the most natural passion that can stir in the\r\nheart of man The results in the field of practical politics, will be\r\nthat “society”--at least such of our drawing-rooms and dinner tables\r\nas any one, whether foreigner or native, knows or cares anything\r\nabout--will resume the political importance which such places have\r\nalways held in civilized times, and of which nothing but extraordinary\r\nand transient conditions have deprived them. Let any one who doubts\r\nthis, compare the club talk and dinner table talk of to-day, with the\r\ntalk of ten years ago. It would be childish to guess the positive\r\nresults on the arts, theatres, novels, verse which will follow; but you\r\ncan no more keep the spirit of freedom out of these things than you can\r\nkeep it out of personal manners. These are changing daily. The decorums\r\nand codes of behavior, the old self-consciousness and self-distrust\r\nare dropping off. Steadily the flood of life advances, inspiring all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: FROEBEL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: FROEBEL\r\n\r\n\r\nI have two boys, aged seven and four. They required a governess and I\r\ngot one. After a couple of months during which the usual experiences\r\nin the training of young children were gone through, I discovered that\r\nit was I who was being educated. My mind was being swayed and drawn\r\nto a point of view. I was in contact with a method so profound that\r\nit seemed as if I were dealing with, or rather being dealt with by\r\nthe forces of nature. I was in the presence of great genius. What was\r\nit? The text book on Froebel by Hughes in the International Series on\r\nEducation made the matter clear.\r\n\r\nFroebel was an experimental psychologist who used the terms of the\r\nGerman philosophy of his day. But the facts of life, the thing he was\r\nstudying, was never for a moment absent from his mind. He lived in an\r\nage when the ideas of evolution were in the air, and before they had\r\nreceived their conclusive proof by being applied to morphology.\r\n\r\nThis application has for a time killed philosophy, for it has\r\nidentified the new ideas with the physical sciences, and led men to\r\nstudy the human mind in psychology and from without. Whereas the mind\r\nand its laws can, in the nature of things, be studied only through\r\nintrospection. Froebel had a scientific intellect of the very first\r\ncalibre; he had the conception of flux, of change, of evolution to\r\nstart with; and he took up introspectively the study of the laws of the\r\nhuman mind, choosing that province of the universe where they are most\r\nvisibly and typically exposed,--the mind of the growing child.\r\n\r\nThe “laws” which he states are little more than a description of the\r\nphenomena that he observed. They are statements of the results of his\r\nexperiments, and the language he employs can be translated to suit\r\nthe education of almost any one. His attention was so concentrated\r\nupon fact that his terminology does not mislead. It can be translated\r\ninto the language of metaphysics, of Christian theology, or of modern\r\nscience, and it remains incorruptibly coherent.\r\n\r\nHis method of study was the only method which can obtain results in\r\nphilosophy, self-study unconsciously carried on. He observed the\r\nchild, and guessed at what was going on in its mind by a comparison\r\nwith what he knew of himself. He was anxious to train young children\r\nintelligently, and he found it necessary to describe and formulate\r\nhis knowledge of the operation of their minds. It turns out that he\r\nmade a statement of the universe more comprehensive, a philosophy more\r\nuniversal, than any other of which we have any record.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the most important thing he did. He devised a method\r\nbased upon his experiments and set agoing the kindergarten upon\r\nits course in conquest of the world. If it had not been for this,\r\nhe might never have been heard of, for the world has small use for\r\nsystems of philosophy, however profound, expressed in terms which have\r\nbeen superseded and are become inexpressive. But Froebel started a\r\npractice. He showed the way. He put in the hands of persons to whom his\r\nphilosophy must ever remain a mystery, the means of working out those\r\npractical ends for which that philosophy was designed.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Froebel lies in this, that he saw the essential. What\r\nsort of an animal is man, asks the morphologist, for he is beginning\r\nto reach this point in his studies, and before he has asked it, Froebel\r\nhas answered him.\r\n\r\n‘Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength.’\r\n\r\nIt may be said at once that the substance of everything Froebel says\r\nwas known before. Solomon and Orpheus, Marcus Aurelius, Emerson, and\r\nall of us have known it. Otherwise Froebel would be unimportant. It is\r\nhis correlation and his formulation of the main facts about human life\r\nthat make him important. It is as a summary of wisdom, as a focus of\r\nidea, as a lens through which the rest of the ideas in the world can be\r\nviewed, that he is great.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe laws he discovered may be stated in a paragraph. The child is a\r\ngrowing organism. It is a unity. It develops through creative activity.\r\nIt is benefited by contact with other children and is happy in\r\nproportion as it is unselfishly employed.\r\n\r\nLet us assume for a moment that these things are true, that they are\r\nthe most important truths about the child; and let us see how they\r\nmust affect our views of life, of politics, sociology, art, religion,\r\nconduct. There is of course no moment at which the child ceases to be\r\na child. The laws of its growth and being are not at any discoverable\r\ntime superseded by any new laws. Man as a creature, as an organism, has\r\nhere by Froebel, and for the first time in history, been ingenuously\r\nstudied, and the main laws of him noted. With the discovery that he is\r\na unity, there vanishes every classification of science made since the\r\ndays of Aristotle. They are convenient dogmas, thumb rule distinctions,\r\nuseful as aids in the further pushing of our studies into the workings\r\nof this unity. Take up now a book of political economy, a poem, a\r\nhistory: this thought of Froebel’s runs through it like quicksilver.\r\nThe scheme of thought of the writer is by it dissolved at once into\r\nhuman elements. You find you are studying the operation of the mind of\r\nsome one, whom you picture to yourself as a man, as a unit; you are\r\ninterpreting this by your own experience. It is all psychology, you are\r\npushing your analysis. The universe is receiving its interpretation\r\nthrough you yourself. We are thus brought to the point of view of the\r\nmystic, as the only conceivable point of view.\r\n\r\n“That the organism develops by creative activity.” This might have\r\ncome as a deduction from Darwin. It is an expression in metaphysical\r\nlanguage of the “struggle for life.” Froebel discovered it\r\nindependently. The consequences of a belief in it are so tremendous,\r\nthat no man who is not prepared to spend the rest of his life\r\ncompletely dominated by the idea, ought even to pause to consider it.\r\n\r\nYour capacities, your beliefs, your development, your spiritual\r\nexistence are the result of what you do. Active creation of some sort,\r\noccupation which takes your entire attention and calls upon you,\r\nmerely incidentally and as a matter of course, for thought, resource,\r\nindividual or original force; this will develop you and nothing else\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe connection between this thought and the previous one is apparent.\r\nIt is only by such creative activity that the organism as a unit gets\r\ninto play. If you set a man copying or memorizing, you have occupied\r\nonly a fraction of him. If you set him to making something, the minute\r\nhe begins, his attention is concentrated. Willy nilly he is trying to\r\nmake something significant, he is endeavoring to express himself, the\r\nforces and powers within him begin coming to his succor, offering aid\r\nand suggestion. Before he knows it, his whole being is in operation.\r\nThe result is a statement of some sort, and in the process of making\r\nit the creature has developed. But when you say “significant” you have\r\nalready implied the existence of other organisms. He is not expressing\r\nhimself only, he is expressing them all, and here comes Froebel with\r\nhis third great discovery, that it is by constant personal intercourse\r\nwith others that the power to express is gained. And on top of this\r\ncomes the last law, so closely related to the third as to be merely\r\na new view of it, but discovered by experiment, tested by practice,\r\nannounced empirically and as a fact, that the child is unselfish and\r\nonly really happy when at work creatively and for the use and behoof of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion throws back its rays over the course of the argument,\r\nand we are compelled to see, what we have already known, that\r\nunselfishness and intellectual development are one and the same thing,\r\nthat there is no failure of intellect which cannot be expressed in\r\nterms of selfishness, and no selfishness that cannot be expressed as\r\nintellectual shortcoming. Criminology has reached the same point by\r\nanother route.\r\n\r\nThe matter is really very simple, for anything self-regardant means\r\na return of the organism upon itself, a stepping on your own toes,\r\nand brings self-consciousness, discomfort, pain. Self-sacrifice\r\non the other hand brings fulfilment. The self-sacrifice is always\r\nillusory, and the development real. This becomes frightfully apparent\r\nin ingenuous and unhappy love affairs, for the organism robbed of\r\nfulfilment returns upon itself.\r\n\r\nIt makes little difference what province of thought we begin with in\r\napplying these views to the world. They give results like a table of\r\nlogarithms. They do more than this, they unravel the most complex\r\nsituations, they give the key to conduct and put a compass in the hands\r\nof progress. They explain history, they support religion, they justify\r\ninstinct, they interpret character. They give the formula for doing\r\nconsciously what mankind has been doing unconsciously in so far as it\r\nhas been doing what any one of us in his soul approves of or cares to\r\nimitate.\r\n\r\nLet us take up the most obvious deductions. If people develop according\r\nto their activities, their opinions will be a mere reflex of their\r\nconduct. What they see in the world comes out of what they do in the\r\nworld. Here in a mere niche of Froebel we find the whole of Emerson.\r\n\r\nThe power and permanence of Sainte Beuve are due to his having applied\r\nthis theory to the interpretation of literature. He is not content till\r\nhe has seen the relation between the conduct and the opinions, the\r\nconduct and the art of a character.\r\n\r\nOr take Emerson himself, why was it that being so much he was not\r\nmore? How came it that after his magnificent prologue in the Phi Beta\r\nKappa address, which is like the opening of a symphony, he relapsed\r\ninto iteration and brilliant but momentary visions of his own horizon?\r\nHe kept repeating his theme till he piped himself into fragmentary\r\ninconsequence. The reason is that he had learned all he knew before he\r\nretired to Concord and contemplation. Active life would have made him\r\nblossom annually and last like Gladstone.\r\n\r\nOr take Goethe: all that is questionable in him results from his\r\nviolation of two of Froebel’s laws of psychology. He fixed his\r\nattention upon self-development and thereby gradually ossified. Every\r\nmoment of egotism was an intellectual loss. His contact with people,\r\nmeanwhile, became more and more formal as he grew older, and his work\r\nmore and more inexpressive.\r\n\r\nGive me a man’s beliefs, and I will give you his occupation. What has\r\nhappened to that radical that he seems to have become so moderate and\r\nreasonable? You find that for six months he has been clerk to the Civil\r\nService Reform Club. Why is the mystical poetry of this intellectual\r\nman as vacant as the fashion print he edits for his daily bread? His\r\nemployment has tracked his mind to these unearthly regions. He is dead\r\nhere too.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as independent belief, based on evidence and\r\nreflection. The thing we call belief is a mere record left by conduct.\r\nIf you sincerely go through the regimen of Loyola’s manual, you will\r\ncome out a Jesuit. You can no more resist it than you can resist the\r\noperation of ether. This man is an optimist. It means that he has\r\nstruggled. That man is a pessimist. It means that he has shirked.\r\nHere is one who has been in touch with all movements for good during\r\na dismal era of corruption, and yet he has no faith. It means that\r\nthe whole of him has not been enlisted. His conscience has drawn him\r\nforward. It is not enough. There is compromise in him. He is not an\r\nabsolute fighter.\r\n\r\nHere is the most excellent gentleman in America, an old idealist\r\nuntouchably transcendental, an educated man. To your amazement he\r\nthinks that it is occasionally necessary to subsidize the powers of\r\nevil. He was bred a banker.\r\n\r\nHere is a village schoolma’am who from a rag of information in a county\r\npaper has divined the true inwardness of a complicated controversy at\r\nWashington which you happen to know all about. She has been reforming a\r\npoorhouse.\r\n\r\nA is a clergyman, good but ineffective. He relies on beneficence and\r\npersuasion. He does not know the world better than a club loafer knows\r\nit. The only entry to it is by attack, the only progress by action.\r\n\r\nB is a good fellow, yet betrays a momentary want of delicacy which\r\ngives you a shock, and which you forgive him, saying: “It is a\r\ncoarseness of natural fibre.” It is no such thing. There is in every\r\nman a natural fibre as fine as a poet’s. His coarseness is the residuum\r\nof an act.\r\n\r\nYou meet a man whom you have known as a court stenographer, and whom\r\nyou have supposed to be drowned in worldly cares. At a chop house he\r\ngives you a discourse on Plato’s Phædrus which he interprets in a novel\r\nway. The brains of the man surprise you. This man, though he looks\r\nsordid, positively must have been sending a younger brother to college\r\nduring many years. There is no other explanation of him.\r\n\r\nThe nemesis of conduct then stalks about in the form of a natural law,\r\nnot as the pseudo science of fancy, but as a mode of growth, modestly\r\nformulated by a great naturalist.\r\n\r\nTake the matter up on its other side. You can only discover in the\r\nuniverse, try how you will, strain your eyes how you please, you can\r\nonly see what you have lived. Out of our activity comes our character,\r\nand it is with this that we see beauty or ugliness, hope or despair. It\r\nis by this that we gauge the operation of economic law and of all other\r\nspiritual forces. It is with this that we interpret all things. What we\r\nsee is only our own lives.\r\n\r\nWe are all more or less in contact with human life. We live in a\r\npandemonium, a paradise of illustrations, and if we have only eyes to\r\nsee, there is enough in any tenement house to-day to lay bare the heart\r\nand progress of Greek art.\r\n\r\nBut the worst is to come--the horror that makes intellect a plaything.\r\nBy a double consequence the past fetters the future. Once take any\r\ncourse and our eyes begin to see it as right, our hearts to justify it.\r\nOnly fighting can save us, and we see nothing to fight for. Thraldom\r\nenters and night like death where no voice reaches. The eternal\r\nstruggle is for vision.\r\n\r\nHow idiotic are the compliments or the contempt of the inexperienced.\r\nNothing but life teaches. Hallam thinks Juliet immodest, and he had\r\nread all the literatures of Europe. If you want to understand the Greek\r\ncivilization you have got to be Sophocles. If you want to understand\r\nthe New Testament you have got to be Christ. If you want to understand\r\nthat most complex and difficult of all things, the present, you must be\r\nsome or all of it, some of it any way. You must have it ground into you\r\nby a contact so wrenchingly close, by a struggle so severe, that you\r\nlose consciousness, and afterwards--next year--you will understand.\r\n\r\nHere is the reaction familiar to all men since the dawn of history,\r\nwhich makes the man of action the hero of all times. It goes in\r\ncourage, it comes out power.\r\n\r\nThis reaction, this transformation goes forward in the very stuff that\r\nwe are made of, and if we come to look at it closely, we are obliged\r\nto speak of it in terms of consciousness. There are so many different\r\nkinds of consciousness, that the best we can do is to remind some one\r\nelse of the kind we mean. The hand of the violinist is unconscious\r\nto the extent that it is functioning properly, and as his command\r\nover music develops, this unconsciousness creeps up his arm and\r\npossesses his brain and being, until he, as he plays, is completely\r\nunself-conscious and his music is the mere projection of an organism\r\nwhich is functioning freely.\r\n\r\nBut this condition of complete concentration makes us in a\r\ndifferent sense of the word self-conscious in the highest degree,\r\nself-comprehending, self-controlled, self-expressing. And it is in\r\nthis philosophical sense that the word self-conscious is used by the\r\nGermans, and may sometimes be conveniently used by us, if we can do so\r\nwithout foregoing the right to use the words conscious and unconscious\r\nin their popular sense at other times.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Froebel was that this mastery over our own powers was\r\nto be obtained only through creative activity. The suggestion, it may\r\nbe noted, is destined to reorganize every school of violin playing in\r\nEurope. For we have here the major canon of a rational criticism. We\r\nfind that in the old vocabulary such words as genius, temperament,\r\nstyle, originality, etc., have always been fumblingly used to denote\r\ndifferent degrees in which some man’s brain was working freely and\r\nwith full self-consciousness. A deliverance of this kind has always\r\nbeen designated as ‘creative,’ no matter in what field it was found.\r\n\r\nApproaching the matter more closely, we see that the whole of the\r\nman must have responded in real life to every particle of experience\r\nwhich he uses in his work. An imitation means something which does not\r\nrepresent an original unitary vibration.\r\n\r\nGoethe puts in the mouth of the mad Gretchen a snatch of German song\r\nin imitation of Ophelia. The treatment does not fit the character. It\r\nhas only been through that part of Goethe’s mind with which he read\r\nShakespeare. As a sequel to this suggestion, the peasant of the early\r\nscenes has lavished upon her all the various reminiscences of the\r\npathetic that Goethe could muster. It is moving, but it is inorganic.\r\nIt is not true.\r\n\r\nFor note this, that while it takes the whole of a man to do anything\r\ntrue, no matter how small, anything that the whole of him does is\r\nright. Hence the inimitable grotesques of greatness, the puns in\r\ntragedy. These things belong to the very arcana of nature. By and by,\r\nwhen the reasons are understood, nature will be respected. No one will\r\nattempt to imitate genius, or to reproduce an artistic effect of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nIf we look at recent literature by the light of this canon, we find the\r\nreason for its inferiority. It is the work of half minds, of men upon\r\nwhose intelligence the weight of a dogma is pressing.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of philosophy was of course reflected in fiction. There is\r\nthe same trouble with Herbert Spencer as with Zola. Each of them thinks\r\nto wrest the secrets of sociology from external observation. Their\r\nbooks lack objectivity and are ephemeral. Kant and Balzac did better\r\nbecause their method was truer.\r\n\r\nEverything good that has been done in the last fifty years has been\r\ndone in the teeth of current science. The whole raft of English\r\nscientists are children playing with Raphael’s brushes the moment they\r\nleave some specialty. There never lived a set of men more blinded\r\nby dogma, blinded to the meaning of the past, to the trend of the\r\nfuture, by the belief that they had found new truth. Not one of them\r\ncan lift the stone and show what lies under Darwin’s demonstration.\r\nThey run about with little pamphlets and proclaim a New Universe like\r\nFrenchmen. They bundle up all beliefs into a great Dogma of Unbelief,\r\nand throw away the kernel of life with the shell. This was inevitable.\r\nA generation or two was well sacrificed, in this last fusillade of the\r\nDogma of Science--the old guard dogma that dies but never surrenders.\r\nHereafter it will be plain that the whole matter is a matter of symbols\r\non the one hand, knowledge of human nature on the other.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer has been a useful church-warden to science, but his\r\nknowledge of life was so trifling, his own personal development so\r\none-sided, that his sociology is a farce.\r\n\r\nThis canon of criticism explains in a very simple manner the art ages,\r\ntimes when apparently every one could paint, or speak, or compose. The\r\nart which is lost is really the art of courageous action. Neither war\r\nnor dogma nor revolution is necessary, for feeling can no more be lost\r\nthan force, and the power to express it depends upon an interest in\r\nlife. The past has enriched us with conventions, and whenever a man\r\nor a group of men arises who uses them and is not subdued to them, we\r\nhave art. The thing is easy. To the doers it is a mere knack of the\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWe had almost thought that art was finished, and we find we are\r\nstanding at the beginning of all things. Froebel has found a formula\r\nwhich fits every human activity.\r\n\r\nLet us take the supreme case, the apogee of human development, and what\r\nwill it be?\r\n\r\nThe sum of all possible human knowledge is, as we have seen, an\r\nexpansion of our understanding of human nature, and this is got by\r\nintercourse, by dealing with men, by getting them to do something. In\r\norder to make them do it, in order to govern, you must understand, and\r\nthe rulers of mankind are the wisest of the species. They summarize\r\nsociety. Solomon, Cæsar, Hildebrand, Lincoln, Bismarck, these men knew\r\ntheir world.\r\n\r\nBut if a virtuous ruler be the prototype of all possible human\r\nfulfilment, there is no other art or province of employment to which\r\nthe same views do not apply. When any man reaps some of the power\r\nwhich his toil has sown, and throws it out as a note or a book or a\r\nstatue, it has an organic relation to the human soul and is valuable\r\nforever. There is only one rule of art. Let a man work at a thing till\r\nit looks right _to him_. Let him adjust and refine it till, as he\r\nlooks at it, it passes straight into him, and he grows for a moment\r\nunconscious again, that the forces which produced it may be satisfied.\r\nAs it stands then, it is the best he can do. In so far as we completely\r\ndevelop this power we become completely happy and completely useful,\r\nfor our acts, our statements, our notes, our books, our statues become\r\nuniversally significant.\r\n\r\nOnce feel this truth, and you begin to lose the sense of your identity,\r\nto know that your destiny, your self, is an organic part of all men.\r\nIt is they that speak. It is themselves that have been found and\r\nexpressed. It was this toward which we tended, this that we cared\r\nfor--action, art, intellect, unselfishness, are they not one thing?\r\n\r\nThe complete development of every individual is necessary to our\r\ncomplete happiness. And there is no reason why any one who has ever\r\nbeen to a dull dinner party should doubt this. Nay, history gives proof\r\nthat solitude is dangerous. Man cannot sing, nor write, nor paint, nor\r\nreform, nor build, nor do anything except die, alone. The reasons for\r\nthis are showered upon us by the idea of Froebel, no matter which side\r\nof it is turned toward us.\r\n\r\nThis philosophy which seemed so dry till we began to see what it\r\nmeant, begins now to circumscribe God and include everything. For\r\nChrist himself was one whose thoughts were laws and whose deeds are\r\nuniversal truth. Shakespeare’s plays are universal truth. They are the\r\nprojection of a completely developed and completely unconscious human\r\nintellect. They educated Germany, and it is to the study of them that\r\nHegel’s view of life is due. The great educational forces in the world\r\nare proportioned in power to the development of the individual man in\r\nthe epochs they date from. Here and there, out of a hotbed, arises\r\na personal influence which directs thought for a thousand years and\r\nqualifies time forever.\r\n\r\nThe division of the old ethics into egoism and altruism receives the\r\nsanction of science. The turning of the attention upon selfish ends,\r\nno matter how remote nor how momentary, hurts the organism, contracts\r\nthe intellect, dries up the emotions, and is felt as unhappiness. The\r\nturning of the attention toward public aims benefits the organism,\r\nenlarges the intellect, and is felt as happiness. There is no\r\ncomplexity possible, for any mixed motive is a selfish motive.\r\n\r\nAll the virtues are different names for the injunction of self-mastery,\r\nby which the internal struggle is made more severe, and the force\r\ncooped in and controlled until it is released in the functioning of the\r\nwhole man.\r\n\r\nIn any sincere struggle for right, then, no matter how petty, we are\r\nfighting for mankind, and this is just what everybody has always known,\r\nalways believed.\r\n\r\nIt is thrown at us as a great paradox, that somebody must pay the\r\nbills; that if you live upon charity and can succeed in getting\r\nyourself crucified, you are still a mere product of thrift and\r\nselfishness somewhere. But the paradox is the same if put the other\r\nway, for selfishness would never support you.\r\n\r\nThe question is purely one of fact, what thing comes first, what thing\r\nsatisfies the heart of man. He may support himself merely as a means to\r\nhelp others. A man may start a pauper and die a millionaire, and yet\r\nnever think a thought or do an act which does not add to the welfare of\r\nman. It is a question of ultimate controlling intention.\r\n\r\nMan the microcosm is a kingdom where reigns continual war. Now he is\r\na furnace of love, the next moment he is a mean scamp. We know very\r\nlittle about the mechanism by which these microcosms communicate with\r\none another. It seems likely that every iota of feeling must be either\r\ntransmitted or transformed; that if a spasm of selfishness be conveyed,\r\nor some part of it, even by a glimpse of the eye, it must leave a\r\nrecord of injury and start on a career of injury, just so much loss to\r\nthe world. On the other hand it may be transformed into the other kind\r\nof force and expended later in good.\r\n\r\nThe thing is governed by some simple law, although man has not yet\r\nbeen able to reduce it to algebra. What is most curious is this, that\r\nthe tendency of any man to believe in the reaction as a law, is not\r\ndependent upon his scientific training, but upon his moral experience.\r\nThe best heads in physics will still betray a belief that a man must\r\nbe able to afford to be unselfish, that selfishness often does good,\r\nthat it is a muddled up affair, and a thing outside of science which\r\nthey will get round to later. Everybody sees a few degrees in the arc\r\nof this law. Read the index on the quadrant and you will have his\r\ncharacter. Now and then some saint swears he sees a circle.\r\n\r\nLet us press the inquest. It is not likely that life itself is duplex\r\nor consists of two kinds of force, one egoistic, one altruistic. The\r\nlikelihood is the other way. There is only one force which vibrates\r\nthrough these organisms. It is absolutely beneficent only when it\r\ncompletely controls one of them, so that the whole thing sings together.\r\n\r\nThis music is the highest, but the notes that go to make it up are\r\neverywhere. Altruism does not arise, is not imposed from without, at\r\nany period or by any crisis, by progress or by society. The spiral\r\nunwinds with the unwinding life upon the globe. It is the form of\r\nillusion under which all life proceeds. It is the law of mind. The\r\neye treats space and color as entities. It cannot see on any other\r\nterms. The stomach digests food, but not its own lining. We are obliged\r\nto think in terms of the objective universe. We are not wholesome\r\nunless we are self-forgetting. There is no cranny in all the million\r\nmanifestations of nature where you can interfere between the organism\r\nand its object without representing disease.\r\n\r\nAnd man is more than a mere altruistic animal. At least the religions\r\nof Humanity have never expressed him. At those times when he is\r\nentirely unselfish and therefore entirely himself, when he feels\r\nhimself to be one single well-spring, all unselfishness, all love,\r\nall reverence, all service to something not himself, yet something\r\npersonal, he has faith. The theologies are attempts to formulate this\r\nstate of mind in order that it may be preserved. It is clear enough\r\nthat every mind must speak in its own symbols, and that the symbols\r\nof one must always appear to another as illusions. Yet each man for\r\nhimself knows he faces a reality. This is a psychological necessity.\r\nDestroy the belief, and on the instant he changes. Show him that he is\r\nthe victim of an illusion, and he is divided, a half man. A man whose\r\nmind is divided, as, for instance, by the consciousness of a personal\r\nmotive, cannot believe. He stands like the wicked king in the play of\r\nHamlet; unable to pray. It is a psychological impossibility.\r\n\r\nThe concern of mankind for their forms of doctrine is gratuitous. Faith\r\nre-appears under new names. You cannot convince a lover that he is bent\r\non self-development, nor any decent man that he does not believe in, is\r\nnot controlled by something higher than himself. The question is not\r\none of words.\r\n\r\nWe may trace this reverent attitude of mind upward through the acts and\r\nactivities of the spirit, and it makes no difference whether we regard\r\nreligion as the source and origin of them all or as the summary of them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn Shakespeare’s plays we see a cycle of human beings, the most living\r\nthat we have ever met with, and the absence of mystical or emotional\r\nreligion from many of the plays is one of the wonders of nature.\r\nThere is no God anywhere, and God is everywhere; we are not offended.\r\nThe reason may be that the element has been employed in the act of\r\ncreation. Religion has been consumed in the development of character.\r\nIt is felt in the relation of Shakespeare to the characters. It is here\r\nseen as artistic perfection. The same is true of the Greek statues and\r\nof the Sistine Sibyls, and of other work left by those two periods, the\r\nonly other periods in which the individual attained completion.\r\n\r\nObserve that in all this philosophy there is no dogma anywhere, no term\r\nwhose definition you have to learn, no term which makes the lying claim\r\nthat it can be used twice with the same connotation. Froebel had the\r\ninstinct of a poet and knew his language was figurative. It was this\r\nthat freed him from the Middle Ages and gave him to the future. He took\r\ntheology as lightly as he took metaphysics. He did not impose them, he\r\nevoked them. He lived and thought in the spirit.\r\n\r\nIf you turn from Froebel’s analysis of human nature to Goethe’s, there\r\nseem to be a thousand years between them. The one is scientific, the\r\nother is mediæval. The one has freed himself from the influences of the\r\nrevival of learning, the other has not. The one is open, the other is\r\nclosed. The one is free, the other is self-conscious. But Froebel has\r\nnot yet set free the rest of the race, and of course the literature\r\nand practices of the kindergartners are full of dogmas. The terms of\r\nFroebel are a snare to those whose interest in childhood came later\r\nthan their interest in education and whose attention is fixed upon the\r\nterms rather than upon the child. He is easy reading to the other sort.\r\n\r\nBut more important than Froebel’s formulation of these great truths\r\nwas his formulation of subsidiary truths. I do not mean his labored\r\nsystems, but his practical suggestions born of experience as to how to\r\nhelp another person to develop. It was these methods, this attitude\r\nof the teacher towards the child, of the individual towards his\r\nfellow, that came at me in my own house unexpectedly, emanating from\r\nsome unknown mind, which seemed so great as practically to include\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n“Do not imagine,” he says at every moment, “that you can do anything\r\nfor this creature except by getting it to move spontaneously. You have\r\nnot begun till you have done this, and remember that anything else you\r\ndo is just so much harm.”\r\n\r\nHe was never tired of suggesting devices for doing this. The following\r\npassage gives in a few words the answer to the most important practical\r\nquestion in life: how we ought to approach another human being. The\r\nthing is said so simply, it seems almost commonplace, yet it comes from\r\none greater than Kant.\r\n\r\n“Between educator and pupil, between request and obedience, there\r\nshould invisibly rule a third something to which educator and pupil\r\nare equally subject. This third something is the _right_,\r\nthe _best_, necessarily conditioned and expressed without\r\narbitrariness in the circumstances. The calm recognition, the clear\r\nknowledge, and the serene, cheerful obedience to the rule of this third\r\nsomething, is the particular feature that should be constantly and\r\nclearly manifest in the bearing and the conduct of the educator and\r\nteacher, and often firmly and sternly emphasized by him.”\r\n\r\nBeneath this statement there lies a law of reaction. The human\r\norganism responds in kind. Strike a man and he strikes, sneer and he\r\nsneers, forget and he forgets. If you wish to convince him that you\r\nare right, concede that from his point of view he is right, then move\r\nthe point and he follows. If you keep your temper in teaching a child,\r\nyou teach him to keep his temper, and this is more important than his\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty we find is to resist the reaction in ourselves to\r\nsome one else’s initiative. The affair is outside the province of\r\nreason, and results from a transfer of force by means which we do not\r\nunderstand. The command to “turn the other cheek” is a picturesque\r\nfigure for the attitude which will enable you to prevail the quickest\r\nand by the highest means, and which Froebel enables us to see in its\r\nscientific aspect.\r\n\r\nBut it is unnecessary to illustrate further what any one who comes in\r\ncontact with a kindergarten will, through all the mists of dogma and\r\nignorance which overspread the place, discover for himself. We have a\r\nscience founded upon human nature, applied to education. Mr. Hughes in\r\nhis closing paragraph uses the language of theology, but he makes no\r\noverstatement:--\r\n\r\n“When Froebel’s ethical teaching has wrought its perfect work in the\r\nhomes, the schools, and the churches, then his complete ideal, which\r\nis the gospel ideal in practice, will be the greatest controlling and\r\nuplifting force in the world.”\r\n\r\nOne word more about the relation between Froebel’s thought and current\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe view of man as an active animal, a struggler, alive and happy\r\nonly in activity, falls in naturally with what we know of the animal\r\nkingdom. The philosophers are at war over science and religion,\r\nover the origin of the non-self-regarding instincts. By an external\r\nconsideration of the animal hierarchy they have come to certain\r\nconclusions which they strive to apply to the highest animal, man.\r\nThere is great boggling over him; because these non-self-regarding\r\ninstincts, which are not very apparent from the outside, seem to\r\nconflict with certain generalizations relative to the conservation\r\nof species. The scientists look into a drop of water and see animals\r\neating each other up. What they have not seen is that all this ferocity\r\ngoes forward, subject to customs as rigid as a military code, and\r\nthat it is this code which conserves the species. The “struggle for\r\nexistence” as it is commonly conceived would exterminate in short\r\norder any species that indulged in it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Froebel, beginning at the other end of the scale and studying\r\nlife from the inside, has established certain facts, certain laws,\r\nwhich have as great a weight, and deserve as much to be carried\r\ndownward in the scale, as the generalizations of the naturalists (very\r\nlikely imperfect) have to be carried upward.\r\n\r\nThe animal man is unselfish. It is impossible to make his organism\r\nvibrate as a unity except by some emotion which can be shown to be\r\nnon-self-regarding. At what point in the scale of nature does this\r\nquality begin to manifest itself? Is the dog happy when he is selfish;\r\ndo the laws of psychology outlined by Froebel apply, and to what\r\nextent do they apply, to the horse or the monkey? These things must be\r\npatiently studied, and the corrections must be made. In the mean time,\r\nin dealing with man himself, we are obliged to rely upon the latest\r\nscientific report of him, however imperfect, and until Froebel’s laws\r\nare destroyed, we need not attempt to adjust our ideas of man to the\r\ndogmas developed by the study of the lower animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system of choosing public officials by popular vote is properly\r\nenough called Democracy. The terms of tenure and nomenclature,\r\netc., are matters of detail. If we are to seek any test as to what\r\nconstitutes a Democracy, we may as well take as a test the formal\r\nsetting up at a particular time of some scheme of government by the\r\npopular will. England has been a democracy since the Act of Settlement,\r\nand if it be said that universal suffrage was not then known, the\r\nanswer is that it is not known now, and never can be known. The\r\nexclusions of women and non-naturalized residents or even of criminals\r\nand lunatics are matters of convenience. It is a question of degree.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is impossible that all the officials should be elected, and\r\nthe assignment to the elected officials of the power to appoint the\r\nothers is a matter of convenience. The very simple expedients adopted\r\nby the framers of the United States Constitution were the result of\r\nEnglish experience and French theory. The intellect of France had,\r\nduring the eighteenth century, put into portable form the ideas that\r\nhad been at work in England’s institutions. The theoretical part of\r\nit, the division of government into three departments, had been worked\r\nout from European experience going back to Greek times. The written\r\nconstitution was a mere expansion of the Bill of Rights. Our Framers\r\nwere men who had had personal experience in governing under the\r\nEnglish system in force in the colonies, where the power of practical\r\nself-government had been developed by isolation. They received from the\r\nFrench a scientific view of that system. They had learned by experience\r\nthat a confederacy was not a government, and they proceeded to bind the\r\ncountry together by the grant of that power which defines government,\r\nthe power to tax. The extension to a large territory of a system which\r\nwas in practical operation in all its parts, was in one sense a miracle\r\nof intelligence, in another sense it was the only conceivable solution\r\nof the problem of unity. Philosophers speak of Democracy as if it were\r\nthe outcome of choice. It has been the outcome of events. No other\r\nsystem would have endured, and every formula of government that did not\r\nembody an old usage would have been transformed in ten years by the\r\npopular will into something that did.\r\n\r\nThe reason the Constitution of the United States is the most remarkable\r\ndocument in existence is that it contained so little of novelty. The\r\nelection of some officers and the appointment of the rest, that was\r\nwhat the people were used to. That is democracy. There is of course no\r\nsuch thing as a pure democracy, or a pure monarchy. Every government is\r\nin practice the outcome of forces of which a very small fraction are\r\nexpressed in its constitution and laws.\r\n\r\nA constitution is a profession of faith, a summary written on a\r\nbulletin board, and so far good. The United States had this advantage\r\nin starting upon her career, that the bulletin was a very accurate\r\nsummary of existing customs, and was in itself an inspiring proof of\r\nthe virtue of the people. We are driven into admiring the Colonists\r\nas among the most enlightened of their kind. It is true that the\r\nrevolution was conducted, and the Constitution adopted by the activity\r\nof a small minority. But this is true of all revolutions. The point is\r\nthat the leaders represented sense and virtue. The people followed.\r\n\r\nThe moment the scheme was launched it became the sport of the elements.\r\nIn the North a trading bourgeoisie grew up under it. In the South\r\na slave-holding oligarchy, a society so fantastically out of touch\r\nwith the modern world that it seems like something left over from the\r\ntimes before Christ, found no difficulty in making use of the forms of\r\nDemocracy. During the half century that followed, these two societies\r\nbecame so hostile to each other that conflict was inevitable, and there\r\nensued a death-grapple in four years of war, a war to extinction. At\r\nthe end of the war no trace of the oligarchy remained upon the face\r\nof the earth. And yet these forms of government survived and began to\r\noperate immediately, under new auspices of course, deflected by new\r\npassions, showing new shapes of distortion, yet ideally the same. The\r\nonly common element between the north and the south was the reverence\r\nfor these forms of government.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile civilization had been creeping westward in a margin of\r\nfrontier life, conducted under these forms. Behind this moved a belt of\r\nfarming and village life, at war with the backwoods ideals, but using\r\nthe same forms of government. Then arose the railroad era and tore\r\nmillions of money from the continent, heaped it in cities, obliterated\r\nState lines, centralized everything, controlled everything, ruled\r\neverybody--still under these forms.\r\n\r\nLet us examine them.\r\n\r\nThe problem of government is to protect the individuals in a community\r\nagainst each other, and to protect them all against the rest of the\r\nworld. The power to interfere and the power to represent must be\r\nlodged somewhere, and the question is how to arrange it so that this\r\npower shall not be turned against the people. Democracy solves it by\r\nelection. Let the people choose their rulers. Instantly every man is\r\nturned into a custodian, a part of him is dedicated to the public.\r\nHe is prevented by fundamental theory of law from being absolutely\r\nselfish. Corrupt him how you will, deflect him, play upon him, degrade,\r\ndeceive him, you cannot shut him off from this influence. The framework\r\nof government makes continuous appeal to the highest within him. It\r\ndraws him as the moon draws the sea. This appeal is one to which\r\nthe organic nature of man responds, as we have seen. For man is an\r\nunselfish animal. The law of his nature is expressed in the framework\r\nof government. The arrangement shows a wisdom so profound that all\r\nhistorical philosophy grows cheap before it.\r\n\r\nIf you jump from the study of psychology straight into the theory of\r\ndemocracy, you see why it was that the allegiance to the ideas of\r\nthe United States Constitution endured through slavery, through the\r\ncarpetbag era, through the Tweed ring. It was not the letter, but the\r\nspirit which was inextinguishable.\r\n\r\nIt has taken a century of pamphlets to break down the distinctions\r\nbetween men based upon orders of nobility, property, creed, etc.\r\nFifteen minutes of psychology would have levelled men and set them upon\r\nthe same footing as that upon which they walk into a hospital.\r\n\r\nThe creature man is by this system dealt with so simply as he had not\r\nbeen dealt with since the birth of Christ. It must be conceded that the\r\nthing could not even have been tried, except with a people familiar\r\nwith the distinctions between legislative, executive, and judicial\r\npower, criminal and civil law, etc. Altruistic impulse would not have\r\nsufficed to execute itself. But the divisions and forms of thought\r\nexpressive of that altruism already existed, and were in operation, as\r\nwe have seen.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that the peculiar merit of Democracy lies in this: that\r\nit gives to every man a chance to pursue his own ends. The reverse is\r\ntrue. The merit lies in the assumption imposed upon every man that he\r\nshall serve his fellow men. This is by the law of his being his only\r\nchance for happiness. You cannot find a man who does not know this. If\r\nyou examine the consciousness of any typical minion of success, you\r\nwill find that his source of inward content lies in a belief that his\r\nsuccess has benefited somebody--his kindred, his townsfolk--mankind.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of every man on his own interests has been the danger\r\nand not the safety of Democracy; for Democracy contemplates that every\r\nman shall think first of the State and next of himself. This is its\r\nonly justification. In so far as it is operated by men who are thinking\r\nfirst of their own interests and then of the State, its operation is\r\ndistorted.\r\n\r\nDemocracy assumes perfection in human nature. In so far as an official\r\nor a voter is corrupt, you will have bad government. Or to put the\r\nsame thing in another way, all corruption is shown up as a loss of\r\nthe power of self-government. The framework of government lies there\r\nexposed in all its parts like a vast and complex dial, recording with\r\nthe nicety of a scientific instrument every departure from virtue of\r\nthe human beings whose lives, whose standards, whose very thoughts are\r\nregistered against it. When selfishness reaches a certain point, the\r\nmachine stops. Government by force comes in. We have had railroad riots\r\nand iron foundry riots. In Denver not many months ago thirty thousand\r\npeople, or about one-fifth of the population, engaged in a carnival of\r\ndestruction and raided a picnic given by the Cattle Association. These\r\nebullitions, which look like mania, are nothing but an acute form of\r\nblind selfishness, due to the education of a period in which everything\r\nhas been settled by an appeal to the self-interest of the individual.\r\nThe Bryanism, with which we must all sympathize, is nothing but a\r\nrevolt on the part of the poorer classes against the exploitation of\r\nthe country by the capitalist, due to pension laws, tariffs, trusts,\r\netc. “Something must now be done for me,” says the laboring man, and\r\nthe mine owner says “Silver.” The appeal is by a little manipulation\r\nworked up into a craze, with the result that property is unsafe.\r\nThe craze is a craze of mistaken selfishness. One of the weapons\r\nwith which the richer classes fought it was corruption. They fed the\r\nelement which was devouring them. There is talk of bayonets, and it is\r\ntrue that either bayonets or public spirit must in such cases be the\r\nissue. We cannot have property at the mercy of a mob, and if any single\r\nstate like Colorado were separated from the rest, and the spirit of\r\nunreason should possess it utterly, government by force would ensue.\r\nElections would be superseded, and property would improvise some mode\r\nof practical government which every intelligent man would back. The\r\ndanger of an episode of this sort is that it interrupts the course of\r\nthings. It is revolution. It is the breakdown of democracy, and tends\r\nto perpetuate the conditions of incompetence out of which the crisis\r\narises. Fortunately the country is so large that one State holds up the\r\nnext. No community would tolerate a state of siege for more than six\r\nmonths, and the State would return to educational methods, weaker but\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nA military imposition of order is then the extreme case. But the Boss\r\nsystem is the halfway house in the breakdown of free government.\r\nIn the Boss system we have seen a lack of virtue in the people show\r\nitself in the shape of a government, in fact autocratic, but in form\r\nrepublican. Here again the loss in the power of self-government is\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nBut there is no departure from civic virtue which can get by unnoticed.\r\nTake the case of a voter who submits to having his street kept\r\ndirty because he fears that a protest would make him disagreeably\r\nconspicuous. Here also the loss of power of self-government is\r\ntraceably recorded. So much selfishness--so much filth.\r\n\r\nIf we now recur for a moment to the state of things described in the\r\nessay on politics, we see that our government in all its branches\r\nhas reflected the occupation and spiritual state of the people very\r\nperfectly. But outside of the recurrent and regular political activity\r\nof the country, there has grown up during the past few years a sort of\r\nguerilla warfare of reform. This represents the conservative morality\r\nof the community, the instinct of right government which resents the\r\ntreason to our institutions seen in their operation for private gain.\r\nThe reformers’ methods of work are necessarily democratic, and it is\r\nhere that the most delicate tests of self-seeking are to be found.\r\nThese reformers desire to increase the unselfishness in the world,\r\nyet the moment they attempt a practical reform they are told that any\r\nappeal to an unselfish motive in politics means sure failure. They\r\naccordingly make every variety of endeavor to use the selfishness of\r\nsome one as a lever to increase the unselfishness of somebody else.\r\nThe thing is worked out in daylight time after time, year after year,\r\nand the results are recorded in millegrams. No obscurity is possible\r\nbecause every man stands on the same footing. Our minds are not\r\nobscured by thinking that A must be sincere because he is a bishop, or\r\nneed not be sincere because he is a lord.\r\n\r\nThere is no landlord class with prejudices, no socialist class with\r\ntheories. There are no interests except money interests, and against\r\nmoney the fight is made. If a man is a traitor it is because he has\r\nbeen bought. The results, stated in terms of ethical theory, are simply\r\nstartling.\r\n\r\nA reform movement employs a paid secretary. In so far as he gets\r\nthe place because of his reform principles he represents an appeal\r\nto selfishness. This is instantly reflected in his associates, it\r\ncolors the movement. He himself is attracted partly by the pay. By\r\nan operation as impossible to avoid as the law of gravity he enlists\r\nothers who are also partially self-seeking.\r\n\r\nA Good Government Club is formed by X, and every member is called upon\r\nfor dues and work. It thrives. Another is founded by Y and supported\r\nby him because of his belief that reform cannot support itself but\r\nmust be subsidized. Inside of three weeks the existence of X’s Club\r\nis threatened, because its members hear that Y’s Club is charitably\r\nsupported and they themselves wish relief. They are turned from workers\r\ninto strikers by the mere report that there is money somewhere.\r\nSpend $100 on the Club, and Tammany will be able to buy it when the\r\nneed arises. So frightfully accurate is the record of an appeal to\r\nself-interest made in the course of reform, that no one who watches\r\nsuch an attempt can ever thereafter hope to do evil that good may come.\r\n\r\nThe system lays bare the operation of forces hitherto merely suspected.\r\nDemocracy makes the bold cut across every man and divides him into a\r\npublic man and a private man. It is a man-ometer. You could by means of\r\nit stand up in line every man in New York, grading them according to\r\nthe ratio of principle and self-interest in each.\r\n\r\nIn England a man takes office as the pay for services to the\r\ngovernment. In America he does the same. It is part of their system,\r\npart of our corruption. This may seem a small point, but it will work\r\nout large. An absolute standard is imposed. That our most pronounced\r\nreformers are far from understanding their duties gives proof of the\r\ndegradation of the times, but it exalts the plan of government. These\r\nmen will lead a reform for four weeks, as a great favor, a great\r\nsacrifice, under protest, apologizing to business. They say public\r\nduties come first only in war time. They give, out of conscience and\r\nwith the left hand, what remains after a feast for themselves. And\r\nthese are the saints. Tell one of them that he has not set an honorable\r\nstandard of living for his contemporaries unless, having his wants\r\nsupplied, he makes public activity his first aim in life, and he will\r\nreply he wishes he could do so. He hopes later to devote himself to\r\nsuch things. He will give you a subscription. This man lives in a\r\nDemocracy but he denies its claims. He too is recorded.\r\n\r\nThe English, who gave us all we know of freedom, have been the first\r\nto understand its meaning. They too have suffered during the last\r\ncentury from the ravages of plutocracy, from the disease of commerce.\r\nBut they had behind them the intellectual heritage of the world. They\r\nhad bulwarks of education, philanthropy, thought, training, ambition,\r\nenthusiasm, the ideals of man. It was these things, this reservoir of\r\nspiritual power, that turned the tide of commercialism in England, and\r\nnot as we so cheaply imagine her “leisure class.” The men and women who\r\nin the last ten years have taken hold of the Municipality of London,\r\nand now work like beavers in its reform, are not rich. Some of them may\r\nbe rich, but the force that makes them toil comes neither out of riches\r\nnor out of poverty, but out of a discovery as to the use of life. These\r\nEnglishmen have outlived the illusions of business. As towards them we\r\nare like children. If it were a matter of mere riches we have wealth\r\nenough to make their “leisure class” ridiculous. If there must be some\r\nterm in the heaping of money before the energies of our better burghers\r\nare to be diverted toward public ends, we may wait till doomsday. But\r\nthe reaction is of another sort, and is very simple. Let us be just\r\nto the conscience-givers. They dare not give more. The American is\r\nashamed to lose a dollar. He does not want the dollar half the time,\r\nbut he will lose caste if he foregoes it. Our merchant princes go on\r\nspecial commissions for rapid transit, and receive $5000 apiece. They\r\nmust be paid. Out of custom they must receive pay because “their time\r\nis valuable,” and thus the virtue and meaning of their office receives\r\na soil: they do not work. All this is, even at the present moment,\r\nagainst the private instincts of many of them. It is apparent that they\r\nstand without, shame-faced. It needs only example to give them courage.\r\nA few more reform movements in which they see each other as citizens,\r\nwill knock the shackles from their imagination and make men of them.\r\nAnd then we shall have reform in earnest. For with this enfranchisement\r\nwill come their great awakening to the fact that not they only but all\r\nmen are really unselfish. It is the obscure disbelief in this salvation\r\nwhich has made reform so hard where it might be so easy. As soon as the\r\nreformers shall have reformed themselves, they will avoid making any\r\nappeal to self-interest as so much lost time, so much corruption, and\r\nwill walk boldly upon the waves of idealism which will hold them up.\r\n\r\nIf commerce has been our ruin, our form of government is our\r\nsalvation. Imagine a hereditary aristocracy, a State church, a\r\nlimited monarchy to have existed here during the last thirty years.\r\nBy this time it would have been owned hand and foot, tied up and\r\nanchored in every abuse, engaged day and night in devising new yokes\r\nfor the people. The interests now dominant know the ropes and do\r\ntheir best, but they cannot corrupt the sea. They cannot stop the\r\ncontinual ferment of popular election and reform candidate. The whole\r\napparatus of government is a great educational machine which no one\r\ncan stop. The power of light is enlisted on the side of order. A\r\nproperty qualification would have been an anchor to windward for the\r\nunrighteous. At the bottom of the peculiarly hopeless condition of\r\nPhiladelphia lie the small house and lot of the laboring man. They\r\ncan be taxed. They can be cajoled and conjured with. Corruption is\r\nentrenched.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe find then in democracy a frame of government by which private\r\nselfishness, the bane and terror of all government, is thrust brutally\r\nto the front and kept there, staring in hideous openness.\r\n\r\nNothing except such an era as that which we have just come through,\r\nduring which we have grown used to absolute self-seeking as the normal\r\nstate of man, could so have glazed the eyes of men that they could not\r\nsee thrift even in a public official as a crime, or self-sacrifice even\r\nin a public official except as a folly. And yet so sound is the heart\r\nof man that in spite of this corruption and debauchery, the American\r\npeople, the masses of them, are the most promising people extant. We\r\nhave a special disease. It is our minds which have been injured. We\r\nare cross-eyed with business selfishness and open to the heavens on\r\nall other sides. For this openness we must thank Democracy. Here are\r\nno warped beings, but sane and healthy creatures under a temporary\r\nspell. The American citizen, by escaping the superstitions studded over\r\nEurope since the days of the Roman empire, has a directer view of life\r\n(when he shall open his eyes) than any people since the Elizabethans.\r\nHe will have no prejudices. He will be empirical. But he must forswear\r\nthrift, and the calculating of interest in his sleep. No religious\r\nrevival will help us. We are religious enough already. It is our\r\nrelaxation. Only the painful unwinding of that intellectual knot into\r\nwhich our minds are tied,--that state of intense selfishness during\r\nwhich we see business advancement as our first duty, taught us at the\r\ncradle, enforced by example, inculcated like a religion,--can make us\r\nbegin to operate our institutions upon the lines on which they alone\r\ncan run freely, and we ourselves develop normally. This unwinding will\r\ncome through a simple inspection of our condition. Let no one worry\r\nabout the forms and particular measures of betterment. They will flow\r\nnaturally from the public acknowledgment by the individual of facts\r\nwhich he privately knows and has always known and always denied.\r\n\r\nThis goes on hourly. Those people who do not see it, look for it in\r\nthe wrong places. You cannot expect it to show itself in the public\r\noffices. They are the strongholds of the enemy. You cannot expect it to\r\nappear very often in the children of captivity, the upper bourgeoisie.\r\nThese men are easily put to sleep and will take the promise of a\r\npolitician any day as an excuse for non-activity. They give consent.\r\nWhat we want is assertion, and it is coming like a murmur from the\r\npoorer classes who desire the right and who need only leadership to\r\nmake them honest.\r\n\r\nIt is the recurrent tragedy in reform movements that the merchants put\r\nforward something that the laboring man instantly nails for a lie. It\r\nis not the loss of the election which does the harm, but this insult to\r\nthe souls of men.\r\n\r\nLet no one expect the millennium, but let us play fair. We can see that\r\nour standards, particularly among the well-to-do, are so low that mere\r\ninspection of them causes indignant protest. But we must also know that\r\nwhen we accepted democracy as our form of government we ranked the\r\npolitical education of the individual as more important than the expert\r\nadministration of government. This last can come only as a result, not\r\nas a precurser of the other.\r\n\r\nThe example of a whole people, mad with one passion, living under a\r\nsystem which implies the abnegation of that passion, has laid bare\r\nthe heart of a community, has shown the interrelations between the\r\norgans and functions of a society, in a way never before visible in\r\nthe history of the world. Everything is disturbed, but everything is\r\nvisible. We see Literature, a mere thread, yet betraying all things;\r\nArchitecture, still submerged in commerce but showing every year some\r\nvital change; Social Life, the mere creature of abuses, like a child\r\ncovered with scars, but growing healthy; the Drama, a drudge to thrift\r\nevery way and yet palpably alive. By the light of these things and\r\ntheir relation to each other we may view history.\r\n\r\nThe American is a typical being. He is a creature of a single passion.\r\nIn so far as Tyre was commercial she was American. You can reconstruct\r\nmuch of Venetian politics from a town caucus. In so far as London is\r\ncommercial it is American. You can trace the thing in the shape of a\r\nhandbill in Moscow. Or to take the matter up from the other side: you\r\ncan, by taking up these correlated ganglia of American society, which\r\ndo nevertheless simply represent the heart of man, and are always\r\npresent in every society--by imagining the enlargement of one function,\r\nand the disuse of the next, you can reconstruct the Greek period and\r\nre-imagine Athens.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the sociologists study America. It seems as if the key and\r\ncause of human progress might be clutched from her entrails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen two men are fighting and agree that they will stop at sundown,\r\nwe have government. Their consent is government. Their memory of that\r\nconsent is an institution. There never was a government of any kind or\r\nfor any purpose that did not rest upon the consent of the governed; but\r\nthe means by which the consent is obtained have varied. The consent\r\nrecords the extent to which the individuals are alike. It is only by\r\nvirtue of similarity in the governed that government exists. On a\r\nship, all men are alike in their danger of being drowned, and they\r\nconsent to dictation from the captain for the welfare of all. The aim\r\nof the despot is to keep the population alike in their need of him\r\nor their fear of him. After the French Revolution, the entire French\r\npeople were alike both in their desire for order and in their lack of\r\ntraining in self-government. A dictator was inevitable. Gouverneur\r\nMorris, whose experience in America qualified him to judge, saw the\r\nmatter clearly as early as 1791. Napoleon kept the people alike, by the\r\ntwo opposite means of giving them social order and foreign war. Henry\r\nV. kept himself on top in England by waging war in France. Seward in\r\n1861 thought to unite the people of the United States by declaring war\r\nagainst everybody in Europe. The German Emperor is sustained to-day\r\nby the popular fear of France and Russia. It makes no difference what\r\nfoolishness he commits; so long as that fear predominates he will be\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\nFor the converse proposition is also true, that in so far as people\r\nare like-minded, they must be ruled by a single mind. A hundred Malays\r\ncannot establish a representative government. They must have a boss.\r\nThe population of Russia can only be ruled by a Czar. So also whenever\r\nunder any form of government all the people want one thing, one man\r\ndoes it. The reasons for it are invented afterwards, and “war powers”\r\nare found to justify the proclamation setting the slaves free.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which people are similar to each other will be recorded\r\nin their institutions; in fact, those institutions are nothing but\r\ndials of similarity. For this reason any popular national institution\r\ngives you the nation. Moreover any ruler, any system, any consent has\r\na tendency to modify the future because he or it is advertised and\r\nestablished. It is a factor in the consciousness of every individual.\r\nIt is the conservative. It tends to affect the conduct and mind of\r\nevery one, for any one coming in contact with it must conform or\r\nresist. It is a challenge to the individual. It impinges upon him.\r\nThe thing changes daily in his mind, and occupies now more, now less,\r\nof his activities. In cases where his whole external conduct has\r\nbeen absorbed by one such power we have absolute rule, religious or\r\nmilitary, and a uniform population. If there be a single predominating\r\npower which has not yet completely conquered, we have in some form or\r\nanother a record of its growth by a tendency toward absolutism.\r\n\r\nThe American people have been growing strikingly uniform, owing to\r\ntheir one occupation,--business, their one passion,--a desire for\r\nmoney. They are divided by their system of politics into two great\r\ncategories, and hence we see the two opposing Bosses, little nodes of\r\npower representing this identity of consciousness in each of the two\r\ngreat categories of the population, Republicans and Democrats. If you\r\ncould cut open the consciousness of one thousand Americans and examine\r\nit with a microscope, you could set up our government with great ease.\r\n\r\nLet us concede for the sake of argument that the full development of\r\nindividual character and intellect is the aim of life.\r\n\r\nNow in so far as individuals are developed, they differ from each\r\nother. We ought then to be distressed by any identity whatever found in\r\nthe heads of individuals examined; and greatly distressed by the reign\r\nof the same passion manifested in the one thousand American organisms.\r\nYou would say, ‘If this thing goes on, a dictator is absolutely\r\ncertain,’ and then you would remember that you had heard a business man\r\nremark at the Club the evening before, that he would welcome a dictator\r\nas a cheap practical way out of it.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose you to examine one thousand English heads. The first\r\nthing you would notice would be that the number was not large enough\r\nto give reliable results. Certain types would be manifest, but the\r\nspecial variations would be so striking as to cloud your conclusions.\r\nIn all these heads there would be spots of a density nowhere found in\r\nAmerica, but the spontaneous variations outside and round about them\r\nwould be magnificent. You would say, “These spots represent different\r\nkinds of conservatism. This one is reverence for the church, that one\r\nfor the army, a third for the judiciary. They represent prejudice, but\r\nthey also represent stability, a stability that is the resultant of a\r\nthousand positive and various forces. These spots hold England together\r\nand give scope to free government. The world never has done and never\r\ncan do better than this. These individuals are developed. The line of\r\nforce of one man passes through one institution, that of the next man\r\nthrough the next. No force, no passion, can make them all alike at any\r\none time. They are anchored by the Middle Ages. They are fluid and free\r\nin the present. The only hope for freedom in the individual lies in the\r\nexistence of different sorts of institutions.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that English society is like a menagerie, or rather like one\r\nof those collections of different animals, all in one cage, seen at\r\nthe circus. Every one of these animals is trained to regard the rights\r\nof the rest. Diversity is in itself a good. A college of Jesuits is a\r\nprotection to liberty if it is set down in Denver. The Jesuits are not\r\nmoney-mad. It is an education for a Denver child to see a new kind of\r\nman. You will conclude, as some philosophers are now concluding, that\r\nto have free government you must encourage institutions--and you will\r\nbe wrong.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental reason why you are wrong is that these beneficent\r\ninstitutions are what is left of the activity of people who believed in\r\nthem for their own sake. You can no more imitate one of them, or catch\r\nthe power of one of them, than you can set up a king here to repel an\r\ninvasion. You yourself believe in individualism. Go straight for that,\r\nand leave it to erect its bulwarks in what form it may.\r\n\r\nA multiplication of institutions then serves two contradictory\r\npurposes. It limits the individual, creates black spots of prejudice\r\nand unreason in him; but on the other hand it encourages a free\r\ndevelopment of the individual outside of those spots. It creates types,\r\nand types are mutually protective. This is only another way of saying\r\nthat free government results from a segregation of the government into\r\nprovinces, which cannot all be captured, at one time, by one force.\r\n\r\nThe highly intelligent and artificial separation of our government\r\ninto the branches of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial was in a\r\nsense an attempt to get free government by the erection of independent\r\ninstitutions. But these were never strong enough to create types (we\r\nhave hardly the type of judge among us); and certainly no attachment to\r\nany part, but the sacredness of the entire system, has preserved it. It\r\nwas the sentiment attaching to the single idea of a central government.\r\n\r\nIt is to institutions that the consent to be governed is given. The\r\nconsent is always a highly complex affair. It implies a civilization.\r\nIt is qualified, limited, infinitely diversified, and is in every case\r\nregulated by historic fact. For instance, under a limited monarchy,\r\nit is a consent to be governed by a particular dynasty after special\r\nceremonies, tempered by some priesthood, subject to such and such\r\ncustoms,--each and all existing in the imagination of the subject.\r\nFor government is entirely a matter of the imagination, and it is\r\ninconceivable that it should ever be anything else. The English have\r\nspent two centuries in impressing the imagination of India with the\r\nvision of English power. A violation by the government, no matter\r\nhow strong, of the popular imagination, an assumption of power in a\r\nfield not yet subdued, always brings on riots. The Persians resented\r\nfuriously the creation of a tobacco monopoly. The Sultan had to rescind\r\nit. The Americans threw the tea into the harbor.\r\n\r\nThe forms and modes by which government is carried on are the record\r\nof things to which people have consented, and hence become important,\r\nbecome symbols so identified with power that almost all historical\r\nwriting deals with them as entities. The power of the symbols in any\r\ncase varies inversely to the power of the people for self-government,\r\nthat is, to the average differentiation between individuals; or to put\r\nthe thing the other way, the extent to which a man will permit another\r\nto rule him depends upon his incapacity to rule himself.\r\n\r\nThe great unifying forces have always been regarded as dangers to\r\nfree government. War makes a nation a unit. It cannot be conducted by\r\nindividualism. Religion condenses power. That is the reason why our\r\nancestors were so afraid of a State church. Commerce has generally\r\nbeen thought a blessing because commerce gives scope to individualism.\r\nIt enriches and educates. Yet commerce itself may bring in tyranny.\r\nWitness Venice. Commerce has centralized our government. Anything that\r\naffects everybody’s mind with the same appeal strengthens government\r\nand makes for unity. A nation only exists by virtue of such general\r\nappeals. It is inside of and subordinate to this general unity of\r\nfeeling that individualism must go on. The rulers of mankind are\r\nmen who have got control of the symbols, of the institutions, which\r\nstood in the imagination of the people as most important, and who by\r\nmanipulating them extended their range over the popular imagination.\r\nOr to put the thing a little differently, the passions of the people\r\nare reflected in ever-changing institutions. The people seize a man\r\nand force him to do their bidding and rule them in such manner as to\r\nassuage their passions. They make a saint out of Lincoln, and a devil\r\nout of Torquemada.\r\n\r\nIf a man seems to be a great man, and seems to be leading the people,\r\nit is because he knows the people better than they know themselves.\r\nThere was never a people yet that did not in this sense govern\r\nthemselves, being themselves governed by the resultant of their\r\ndominant passions. The Southern Pacific Railroad has for years owned\r\nthe State of California as completely as if it had bought it from\r\na tyrant who ruled over a population of slaves. It was done by the\r\npurchase of votes. In so far as virtue shall regain predominance in the\r\nbreast of the voter and set him free, virtue will replace money in the\r\nvoting, and set free the State.\r\n\r\nUniversal suffrage is a mode and a symbol. Under certain conditions\r\nof education people must have it. Under others they cannot have it.\r\nBut whether they have it or not, they will be ruled by their ruling\r\npassion, and if this renders them alike in character, their government\r\nwill be a tyranny. If the reign of the passion be tempered, the reign\r\nof the tyrant will be tempered. Express the thing in terms of human\r\nfeeling (and what else is there?) and universal suffrage is seen as a\r\n_quantité négligeable_.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that there is no institution that cannot easily be\r\nmade to operate to a contradictory end. The criminal courts here have\r\nbeen used to collect debt. There is no wickedness to which the enginery\r\nof the Christian Church has not at one time or another been lent. The\r\npassions of a period run its institutions as easily as a stream turns\r\nany sort of a mill. To-day the United States Senate is a millionaires’\r\nclub. To-morrow the Stock Exchange may become a church.\r\n\r\nNow what is an institution?\r\n\r\nIt is a custom which receives an assent because it is a custom. Man\r\nhas always been ruled by custom. The notion that there was a time when\r\ndisputes were settled by fighting, and that arbitration came in as a\r\nmatter of convenience, stands on the same sort of footing as Rousseau’s\r\nsocial contract. It is an academic _jeu d’esprit_. In looking back\r\nover history all we see is custom, and farther back, still custom. All\r\nthe fighting of savages is regulated by custom and always has been\r\nregulated by custom. Nay, the bees and the ants are ruled by custom.\r\nThe idea of custom is the one idea that the genius of Kipling led him\r\nto see in the jungle.\r\n\r\nNow what is at the bottom of all this regard for custom? At the\r\nbottom of custom is non-self-regarding impulse. Man is both selfish\r\nand unselfish, but it makes a great difference whether we regard him\r\n_primarily_ as one thing or the other. The scientists, owing\r\nto their study of the lower animals, have tried to explain man on\r\nthe selfish hypothesis and have made a mystery of him. They say “He\r\nmust eat or die; therefore, he must be primarily egoistic.” And they\r\nattempt to explain progress by the expanding of egoism to include,\r\nfirst the family, then the tribe, then the nation, and finally mankind.\r\nSociety according to them is a convention of egoism, a compromise,\r\na joint-stock company. Religion is a matter of ghosts and ancestor\r\nworship, not fully explained yet. Note that this whole view depends\r\nupon a dogma that man _must_ be primarily selfish because he must\r\neat. It is fair enough to retort with a paradox. Man absolutely selfish\r\ncould not survive. Man absolutely unselfish would thrive splendidly.\r\nThe individuals would support each other.\r\n\r\nBut let us start square and remember that it is a question of science.\r\nTake the other hypothesis. The horse runs in herds and propagates\r\nhis species because he is fond of the species. Incidentally he gets\r\nprotected. It is through the illusion that he loves his fellows that\r\nhis own welfare is secured. Non-self-regardant impulse is at the\r\nbottom, self-protection the result.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with every human institution. Non-self-regardant impulse\r\nis at the bottom of all regard for law. We have seen that Democracy\r\nis organized altruism, but there was never a government that did not\r\nprofess to be organized altruism. You cannot bring men together on any\r\nother plea, nor hold them together by any other tie. It is only in so\r\nfar as altruism in conduct exists that progress is possible. If the\r\nmen will not stop fighting at sundown, they have no institutions. They\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nThe regard that every custom receives from the individual who\r\nsupports it is a non-self-regarding emotion. From the ceremonials of\r\nsavages, through the custom of the Frenchman who lifts his hat as a\r\nfuneral passes, to the feeling of Kant as he contemplated the moral\r\nlaw, the element is the same. It is reverence. It is respect. It is\r\nself-surrender.\r\n\r\nBut reverence may become intensified into fear. The imagination of the\r\nworshipper curls over like a wave. It looks back at him and frightens\r\nhim, and when this happens we call it Superstition. The pain of it,\r\nlike all pain, like the distress of insanity, comes wholly from the\r\nfact that it is a self-regarding emotion, it is a disease. Man in\r\nevery stage of his culture is liable to this disease. Want of food or\r\ntyranny, bad water or bad government, brings on this trouble. Every\r\ncountry and every age shows forms of it: and very naturally, the savage\r\nwho is subject by reason of hardships to many diseases, shows terrible\r\nforms of this disease of superstition. This is the chief fact that the\r\nscientists have seen in the savage. These savants, holding the egoism\r\nof man as their major thought, have through their ignorance of human\r\nnature been led to base their explanation of the religion of mankind\r\nupon a disease of the savage.\r\n\r\nThe opposite explanation stares them in the face. We all know in a\r\ngeneral way that the New Testament civilized Europe. The book is a mere\r\ncryptogram of all possible altruism, and therefore fits the soul of\r\nman. Give two men the New Testament--and each man sees himself in it,\r\nand it affects each one differently. By developing and unfolding the\r\ncharacter and emotions of each according to the law of his individual\r\ngrowth, the book differentiates them at once. The more unhappy a man is\r\nthe more he needs it. Oppress a man or put him in jail, let him lead a\r\nlife of self-indulgence, or isolation, and he grows quasi-religious;\r\nthe altruistic emotion has not been expended in intercourse with his\r\nfellows, and it accumulates. This book then, by focussing the altruism\r\nin each individual of many generations of men, by being perpetually\r\nrediscovered, by existing as a constant force differentiating\r\nindividuals and so undoing the tyranny of institution after institution\r\nfounded upon itself, gradually got itself enacted into international\r\nlaw, into custom, into sentiment, and into municipal rule, and has been\r\non the whole the controlling force in Western Europe during the last\r\neighteen centuries. Its symbols express the constant factor in human\r\nnature. It is only in so far as a book does this that it is remembered\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nOf course, when a custom arises it is turned on the instant into\r\nsomething that can be used by egoism, and here comes the pivot of the\r\nmatter. Custom renders men similar to each other. The letter killeth.\r\nBut the letter does much more than kill. It educates, it trains, it\r\ntransmits. Hence the two contradictory functions of an institution\r\nwhich we found at work in England, the one to educate, the other to\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nIn studying the effect of institutions upon the individual, the whole\r\nhierarchy of nature must be reviewed at once. We have nothing to guide\r\nus in our study of the animals except our knowledge of man, but we have\r\nmuch to find in that study which will enlarge and illustrate that\r\nknowledge. Every naturalist and every sociologist should receive his\r\npreliminary training in the political arena, and every politician in\r\nthe greenhouse and the menagerie.\r\n\r\nLet us look at the social life of the ants.\r\n\r\nThe ant seems to show a stage of progress in which the individuals\r\nhave grown alike through a slavish observance of certain institutions.\r\nIt is certain that the ant is a ritualistic being, formal, narrow,\r\nintolerant, incapable of new ideas or private enterprise. He hates any\r\none differing from himself, whether more or less virtuous. He would\r\nregard any suggested improvement in the arrangement of his house as\r\na sacrilege. He works constantly for the public with a devotion that\r\nnothing but religious zeal can explain, and is in his own limited way\r\ncompletely happy. But the tyranny of public opinion, the subserviency\r\nto a State church goes far to make him contemptible.\r\n\r\nThis is the worst that an institution can do. The individual is\r\ncrushed. The primeval reverence for custom seen in the ants has\r\ncrystallized without getting developed and specialized into its higher\r\nform of reverence for the individual ant. He is a type of arrested\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe natural history of religion is then to be sought in a reverence\r\nfor custom that gradually specializes itself into a regard for\r\nthe individual. If these things are true, the advancement of any\r\ncivilization may be measured by the extent in which the rights of\r\nindividuals are held sacred. And this is what we have always been\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\nGovernment was in its origin indistinguishable from religion, and down\r\nto the latest day of time, the fluctuating institutions of man will\r\nrecord this kinship between ritual and law.\r\n\r\nThe scientists, in trying to explain religion and progress as the\r\nresult of an egoism gradually expanding itself to a regard for mankind,\r\nhave been pulling at the wrong end of the cocoon. The thread unwound a\r\nbit and then broke; unwound again and again broke. They were puzzling\r\nthemselves over a conception fundamentally unscientific and at war with\r\ntheir own first principles.\r\n\r\nThe genesis of the emotions proceeds like other developments from the\r\nsimple towards the complex. The notion that the egoism of man gradually\r\nexpanded so as to include the whole human race in a love which was in\r\nreality a love of himself, assumes that this large love is the sum of\r\nlesser loves. It fixes the attention on the objects of human feeling,\r\nand not upon the character of the feeling itself. This character is\r\nthe thing to be studied. When we contrast the religious and social\r\nfeelings of the civilized man with those of the savage we see the same\r\nspecialization and complexity in the emotions themselves which is\r\ntraceable in any higher development. The forms, arguments, theories,\r\ncustoms by which the feeling is expressed, show an ever-increasing\r\nrefinement of sympathy. We are not approaching a general and vague\r\nemotion built up out of lesser regards for particular people. We are\r\napproaching a stage of differentiation, of analysis, a stage of the\r\npersonal application of that same altruism which appears in its lower\r\nform as blind worship and self-abasement before some fetich. The\r\nutility of this emotion, in whatever stage of its development, is a\r\nconsideration that may justify it to the philosopher, but which is not\r\nthe _primum mobile_ in the breast of him that has it. The whole\r\nhistory of man shows that progress comes in the shape of an increasing\r\ntender-heartedness which can give no lucid account of itself, because\r\nit is an organic process.\r\n\r\nThe learned classes are apt to approach a problem in its most difficult\r\nform. Out of travellers’ tales about man in the South Sea Islands,\r\nthe sociologist evolves a theory of religion. Take up a book on the\r\nnatural history of religion and you will find enough learned citations\r\nabout the Hurons and the Esquimaux and the Thibet tribes to furnish\r\nthe library of Pantagruel. Now the regard of a savage for his idol is\r\na very obscure question of psychology. Ten years of youth spent among\r\na tribe would not be too long a period in which to lay the foundations\r\nfor an intelligent guess at the facts, let alone their significance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the actual genealogy of our own religious feelings is\r\nneglected as too familiar. Yet the spiritual history of that race which\r\ngave Europe many of its religions, is better known than any other\r\nhistory of a like antiquity. The point of view and feeling about life\r\nwhich has given us our own experience of religion was developed in the\r\nJew. The Old Testament is the place in which to study the growth and\r\nmeaning of the only religious feeling that we are sure we understand.\r\nThe history of the Jews is the history of a single overpowering emotion\r\nwhich appears in its two forms,--so identical in content that you\r\nmay often find them both in the same sentence, both in the same verse\r\nof Isaiah or Psalm of David,--prostration before the Lord of Hosts,\r\ncompassion for the poor and the oppressed. This passion of altruism\r\nwhich gave the prophets their terrible power is the legacy of the Jew\r\nto the world. The emotion of self-abasement and self-sacrifice and\r\nthe emotion of love towards others, are one thing. This, in its lower\r\nforms, leads to self-mutilation and incantations; in its higher forms,\r\nit becomes embodied by the prophetic fury of great poets into the idea\r\nof a Messiah who shall be both savior and sacrifice. There is only one\r\npassion at work in all these great protagonists of human nature, in\r\nNathan, Elijah, Jeremiah and in the innumerable prophets who confronted\r\nthe arbitrary power of the kings. These men stood for righteousness\r\nand showed an intensity of moral courage which nothing but compassion\r\nhas ever engendered, and nothing but faith has ever expressed. The\r\nrags and the self surrender, the purity and the power, the belief\r\nthat they spoke not of themselves but for the Lord, have been the\r\nsame in all ages. It is impossible to feel compassion in this degree\r\nand not express it in this manner. All just anger is compassion. The\r\nterrible wrath of these men is as comprehensible as their hymns or\r\ntheir triumph. There is no child that reads Isaiah whose nature does\r\nnot respond to him, because the course of feeling in him is true to\r\nlife. Between the Old Testament and the New we see a perfectly coherent\r\ndevelopment of the same passion of the same race into its higher kind.\r\nBoth forms of it have changed. In the New Testament the love has\r\nbecome specialized into that particular and especial regard for the\r\nsoul of each individual man for which we have no counterpart; and the\r\nprostration, the adoration for God the Father, the identification of\r\nthe individual with God the Father, has received expression in forms\r\nwhich one can refer to but not describe. The kingdom of heaven is\r\nwithin you.\r\n\r\nThat modern philanthropy which has been overcoming the world during\r\nthe last century and has put a spirit of religion into politics, is\r\nexpressed in ten thousand dogmas and formulas. These things are the\r\nhieroglyphics of the most complex period in history, but they all read\r\nLove.\r\n\r\nThe love of man for his fellows is the substantial content of every\r\nideal, of every reform. In so far as any political cry is valuable,\r\nit represents this and nothing more. Liberty, Equality and Fraternity,\r\nThe Declaration of Independence, Utilitarianism, Fourierism, Socialism,\r\nProhibition, Christian Science and the Salvation Army carry the same\r\nmessage; and it is only because of this truth, and in spite of the\r\nfact that it is always wrapped up in every kind of falsehood, that\r\nthey move the world forward. Take socialism. This thing is the logical\r\noutcome of the passion of pity at work in men who believe that the\r\ndesire for property is the controlling factor in human arrangements.\r\nThe selfishness of the individual has been assumed as a fundamental law\r\nin that school of thought, which has been dominating all our thought,\r\nand which we habitually accept as final. It receives support from a\r\nsuperficial view of human nature, and time out of mind has been the\r\nbelief of shallow people. But the great intellect and the great labor\r\nof the socialists have been unable to make any impression upon the mind\r\nof a man. We know that their reasoning is foolish. It is to the heart\r\nthat their appeal is made. Bellamy’s book sells by the hundred thousand\r\nto tender-hearted people. It is a plea for humanity. It is Uncle Tom’s\r\nCabin. The function of Socialism is clear. It is a religious reaction\r\ngoing on in an age which thinks in terms of money. We are very nearly\r\nat the end of it, because we are very nearly at the end of the age.\r\nSome people believe they hate the wealth of the millionaire. They\r\ndenounce corporations and trusts, as if these things had hurt them.\r\nThey strike at the symbol. What they really hate is the irresponsible\r\nrapacity which these things typify, and which nothing but moral forces\r\nwill correct. In so far as people seek the cure in property-laws they\r\nare victims of the plague. The cure will come entirely from the other\r\nside; for as soon as the millionaires begin to exert and enjoy the\r\nenormous power for good which they possess, everybody will be glad they\r\nhave the money.\r\n\r\nSocialism was useful, but as a theory it was fated from the beginning,\r\nbecause its prophets and saints are themselves spurred on by a\r\ndifferent motive from that which they evoke in others. They offer\r\nus a religion that assumes that human nature is other than it is, a\r\nreligion not based upon self-sacrifice, and so not based upon an appeal\r\nto primary passion, a religion beseeching us to make other people\r\ncomfortable. Now the only motive which will make men labor for the\r\ncomfort of others, is a belief that this is the quickest way of saving\r\ntheir souls. If souls are to be saved only through their own unselfish\r\nactivity, then it is a lie to hold up property as a goal. The laboring\r\nman can be made happy only by the same means as the merchant. They must\r\nbe saved together. The matter of the physical support of the individual\r\nfollows in the wake of a regard for his soul, but never precedes it.\r\nThe awakening of the spirit of individualism will bring support to the\r\nartisan by bringing in hand work. The machine work with which we have\r\nbeen content represents a loss of religion in the buyer proportionate\r\nto the selfishness of the times. No system based on thrift will\r\ndisplace it, but any movement based on self-sacrifice will tend to\r\ncorrect it. While socialism is worrying out the proof that a wise\r\ndistribution of property will bring in virtue and happiness, other and\r\ndirecter formulations of the truth will have seized the spirits of men\r\nand saved the people.\r\n\r\nThe balance of altruism in the people of a country, preserved in the\r\nform of practical self-control (no matter under what name), gives the\r\nwealth and power of the country.\r\n\r\nGood government then consists in customs which differentiate people.\r\nThey represent a permission to each man to be different from his\r\nneighbor. They are the record of what once was love, and now is law.\r\n\r\nBad government consists in institutions which render men similar\r\nthrough some self-interest, some superstition.\r\n\r\nLet us take a few examples at random from history, and see whether\r\neverything of permanent value to the race is not merely a different\r\nform of expression for the same ideal.\r\n\r\nNapoleon is a type of selfishness. The focus of his almost illimitable\r\nintelligence fell within himself. He was so self-centred that he did\r\nnot precipitate all the passion which supported him upon an idea.\r\nHe did much, but he could not transcend the laws of psychology or\r\nescape the insecurity they dealt him out. He was a great reactionary,\r\nliving in an age of progress, a great egoist in an age of altruism,\r\na great criminal. The whole of Europe had hardly strength enough to\r\nshut him up. He went down finally, and yet before he went down, he had\r\nstood for civilization in every country he touched by establishing\r\nlaw. He gave France his code and his bureaux, things greater than\r\nhis dynasty. He made use of the enlightenment, the expert intellect\r\nof France to establish order, and became a great educator through\r\nhis institutions, his genius for administration. His worshippers are\r\nso struck with this side of his character that they forgive him his\r\ncrimes. For our admiration is chained to the educator. Every great man\r\nis a great educator, and there is no greatness but this. The great man\r\nrepresents, draws out, projects, and establishes the non-self-regarding\r\npart, the intellectual apparatus of others, and those who do it by the\r\nestablishment of law and order receive their tribute as civilizers. The\r\nsaints serve the same end. They speak a language different from that of\r\nthe law-givers, yet their function is the same. The part a man plays in\r\nthe formal government of his times depends on circumstance. It seems to\r\nbe governed by the ratio of his altruism to that of his contemporaries.\r\nPeople will not tolerate a man who is too good or too bad. Had Napoleon\r\nlived in an age of retrogression, very likely he would have died upon\r\nthe throne. Had he been less self-seeking than he was, had he possessed\r\nfor instance the imagination of Washington, very likely the French\r\nwould have deposed him sooner, but in the end the memory of him would\r\nhave educated France.\r\n\r\nFor this is the work of heroes. Where a leader has ideas that are\r\nmore unselfish than those of his time, he is deposed, poisoned, or\r\nridiculed, and his value as an educational force may be increased by\r\nany of these things. Socrates deliberately kept out of politics for\r\nmany years, knowing that if he took part, his sense of justice would\r\nlead to his execution, and fearing to throw away his life; he finally\r\nexpended it with such ability as to make every atom count. The scholars\r\nhave not understood his Apology because they could not fathom the\r\ninstinct of the agitator. It is the same with the martyrs, with the\r\nQuakers in Puritan New England, with the Anti-Slavery people. Their\r\nconduct was governed by the truest understanding of how to draw out and\r\ndevelop the conscience of others. The man who dies for his country does\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nAnother gigantic educator was Bismarck. To have welded the squabbling\r\nprincipalities of Germany into an Empire within a lifetime is one of\r\nthe achievements of history. But Bismarck held the trump card. He\r\nhad a cause to serve. His early work must have been his strongest;\r\nfor since the war with France, patriotism has become the curse of\r\nGermany. It is caked into fanaticism, and is being used by autocracy\r\nto ruin intellect. This is the mystical yet relentless punishment for\r\nthe element which was not patriotism but thrift in their conduct. The\r\nGermans must be great and unified and recover Alsace for their honor.\r\nBut what did they want with the French milliards? They mulcted France\r\nto spare their pockets, and fastened upon themselves the personal\r\nhatred of the French peasant, which gives them William II. for a ruler.\r\nThey looked upon property as power. Had they seen clearly that power is\r\nnothing but sentiment, they would have sown peace.\r\n\r\nOne reason why Holland lost her supremacy was because she came to\r\nregard money as power. She grasped the symbol. For a decline sets in as\r\nsoon as selfishness has reached such a point that any of these symbols\r\nare worshipped. Witness Spain, where the gold of Peru ruined the\r\nSpaniards by making them individually selfish.\r\n\r\nIn the long run virtue and vice contend over national wealth, the first\r\ncollecting, the second dissipating. Witness Cuba. Witness Ireland.\r\nChina is wrecked by private greed. In the last analysis it is a matter\r\nof personal virtue.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent intellect and self-control epitomized in Roman\r\nGovernment, took centuries to perish. Is it a wonder these people\r\nconquered the world?\r\n\r\nThe United States has been held together by English virtue, and there\r\nwas so much of it in the race, that a few generations of money-changers\r\ncould not ruin us. We had, not only the creed, but the beliefs of\r\nEnglish liberty. The future of England depends upon her perception of\r\nthis truth that power is sentiment. The Venezuela trouble showed her\r\nthat her selfish conduct in 1861 made her empire in 1896 insecure. The\r\nspread of England’s empire has been due to a practice in dealing with\r\nthe imagination of others. Establish by force, develop by the organized\r\naltruism of good government, protect by display of force.\r\n\r\nThis system will not apply here. We are the youngest nation and the\r\nmost naif. We are at the mercy of wise or unwise treatment. But we can\r\nno more be fooled than a child. No display of force could touch our\r\nimagination or do more than irritate us. Our feelings must be directly\r\nengaged by means not known to diplomacy or to international law. Let\r\nEngland take a high tone. She must not only seem but be unselfish\r\ntowards us, and she will master the globe.\r\n\r\nThere is one result from the fact that government is a matter of\r\nimagination which is wholly satisfactory. Once set up a scheme of\r\nthings which people approve of and it remains. We shall not have good\r\ngovernment in the United States till the people get over their personal\r\ndishonesty; but when we do get it, it will last without effort. It will\r\nbe harder to destroy than the spoils system. Vigilance will be needed\r\nconstantly, but action rarely. The mere announcement of an abuse will\r\ncorrect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Note:\r\n\r\nSpelling, hyphenation and punctuation have been preserved as published\r\nin the original book.",
