Nor is that the object of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\nRather than to deal with generalities, its purpose is to describe\r\nseparate events of which I had intimate knowledge, and individuals\r\nwith whom I came into close contact and could, therefore, observe\r\nclosely; in fact, to furnish a series of snapshots of the great drama.\r\n\r\nBy this means the following pages may possibly present a conception of\r\nthe war as a whole, which may, nevertheless, differ in many respects\r\nfrom the hitherto recorded, and possibly faulty, history of the war.\r\n\r\nEveryone regards people and events from his own point of view; it is\r\ninevitable. In my book, I speak of men with whom I was in close touch;\r\nof others who crossed my path without leaving any personal impression\r\non me; and finally, of men with whom I was often in grave dispute. I\r\nendeavour to judge of them all in objective fashion, but I have to\r\ndescribe people and things as I saw them. Wherever the description\r\nappears to be at fault, the reason will not be due to a prematurely\r\nformed opinion, but rather, probably, to a prevailing lack of the\r\ncapacity for judging.\r\n\r\nNot everything could be revealed. Much was not explained, although it\r\ncould have been. Too short a period still separates us from those\r\nevents to justify the lifting of the veil from all that happened.\r\n\r\nBut what remains unspoken can in no way change the whole picture,\r\nwhich I describe exactly as imprinted on my mind.\r\n\r\nOTTOKAR CZERNIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n 1.

The electric currents separate, and the\r\nstorm is the result of atmospheric tension which can no longer be\r\nrepressed. Whether or no we become aware of these happenings through\r\noutward signs, whether the clouds appear to us more or less\r\nthreatening, nothing can alter the fact that the electric tension is\r\nbound to make itself felt before the storm bursts.\r\n\r\nFor years the political barometer of the European Ministries of\r\nForeign Affairs had stood at \"storm.\" It rose periodically, to fall\r\nagain; it varied--naturally; but for years everything had pointed to\r\nthe fact that the peace of the world was in danger.\r\n\r\nThe obvious beginnings of this European tension date back several\r\nyears: to the time of Edward VII. On the one hand England's dread of\r\nthe gigantic growth of Germany; on the other hand Berlin's politics,\r\nwhich had become a terror to the dwellers by the Thames; the belief\r\nthat the idea of acquiring the dominion of the world had taken root in\r\nBerlin. These fears, partly due merely to envy and jealousy, but\r\npartly due also to a positive anxiety concerning existence; these\r\nfears led to the encircling policy of Edward VII., and thus was\r\nstarted the great drive against Germany. It is well known that Edward\r\nVII. made an attempt to exercise a direct influence on the Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph to induce him to secede from the Alliance and join the\r\nPowers encircling Germany. It is likewise known that the Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph rejected the proposal, and that this decided the fate\r\nof Austria-Hungary. From that day we were no longer the independent\r\nmasters of our destiny. Our fate was linked to that of Germany;\r\nwithout being conscious of it, we were carried away by Germany through\r\nthe Alliance.\r\n\r\nI do not mean absolutely to deny that, during the years preceding war,\r\nit would still have been possible for Germany to avert it if she had\r\neradicated from European public opinion all suspicion respecting her\r\ndream of world dominion, for far be it from me to assert that the\r\nWestern Powers were eager for war. On the contrary, it is my firm\r\nconviction that the leading statesmen of the Western Powers viewed the\r\nsituation as such, that if they did not succeed in defeating Germany,\r\nthe unavoidable result would be a German world domination. I mention\r\nthe Western Powers, for I believe that a strong military party in\r\nRussia, which had as chief the Grand Duke Nicholas, thought otherwise,\r\nand began this war with satisfaction. The terrible tragedy of this,\r\nthe greatest misfortune of all time--and such is this war--lies in the\r\nfact that nobody responsible willed it; it arose out of a situation\r\ncreated first by a Serbian assassin and then by some Russian generals\r\nkeen on war, while the events that ensued took the monarchs and\r\nstatesmen completely by surprise. The Entente group of Powers is as\r\nmuch to blame as we are. As regards this, however, a very considerable\r\ndifference must be made between the enemy states. In 1914 neither\r\nFrance nor England desired war. France had always cherished the\r\nthought of revenge, but, judging from all indications, she had no\r\nintention of fighting in 1914; but, on the contrary--as she did fifty\r\nyears ago--left the decisive moment for entering into war to the\r\nfuture. The war came quite as a surprise to France. England, in spite\r\nof her anti-German policy, wished to remain neutral and only changed\r\nher mind owing to the invasion of Belgium. In Russia the Tsar did not\r\nknow what he wanted, and the military party urged unceasingly for\r\nwar. As a matter of fact, Russia began military operations without a\r\ndeclaration of war.\r\n\r\nThe states that followed after--Italy and Roumania--entered into the\r\nwar for purposes of conquest, Roumania in particular. Italy also, of\r\ncourse, but owing to her geographical position, and being exposed to\r\npressure from England, she was less able to remain neutral than\r\nRoumania.\r\n\r\nBut the war would never have broken out had it not been that the\r\ngrowing suspicion of the Entente as to Germany's plans had already\r\nbrought the situation to boiling point. The spirit and demeanour of\r\nGermany, the speeches of the Emperor William, the behaviour of the\r\nPrussians throughout the world--whether in the case of a general at\r\nPotsdam or a _commis voyageur_ out in East Africa--these Prussian\r\nmanners inflicting themselves upon the world, the ceaseless boasting\r\nof their own power and the clattering of swords, roused throughout the\r\nwhole world a feeling of antipathy and alarm and effected that moral\r\ncoalition against Germany which in this war has found such terribly\r\npractical expression. On the other hand, I am fairly convinced that\r\nGerman, or rather Prussian tendencies have been misunderstood by the\r\nworld, and that the leading German statesmen never had any intention\r\nof acquiring world dominion. They wished to retain Germany's place in\r\nthe sun, her rank among the first Powers of the world; it was\r\nundoubtedly her right, but the real and alleged continuous German\r\nprovocation and the ever-growing fears of the Entente in consequence\r\ncreated just that fatal competition in armaments and that coalition\r\npolicy which burst like a terrible thunderstorm into war.\r\n\r\nIt was only on the basis of these European fears that the French plans\r\nof revenge developed into action. England would never have drawn the\r\nsword merely for the conquest of Alsace-Lorraine; but the French plan\r\nof revenge was admirably adapted to suit the policy inaugurated by\r\nKing Edward, which was derived not from French but from English\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\nOut of this dread of attack and defence arose that mad fever for\r\narmaments which was characteristic of pre-war times. The race to\r\npossess more soldiers and more guns than one's neighbour was carried\r\nto an absurd extreme. The armaments which the nations had to bear had\r\nbecome so cumbersome as to be unbearable, and for long it had been\r\nobvious to everyone that the course entered upon could no longer be\r\npursued, and that two possibilities alone remained--either a voluntary\r\nand general disarmament, or war.\r\n\r\nA slight attempt at the first alternative was made in 1912 through\r\nnegotiations between Germany and England respecting naval disarmament,\r\nbut never got beyond the first stage. England was no readier for\r\npeace, and no more disposed to make advances than was Germany, but she\r\nwas cleverer and succeeded in conveying to the world that she was the\r\nPower endangered by Germany's plans for expansion.\r\n\r\nI recollect a very telling illustration of the German and British\r\npoints of view, given to me by a prominent politician from a neutral\r\nstate. This gentleman was crossing the Atlantic on an American\r\nsteamer, and among the other travellers were a well-known German\r\nindustrial magnate and an Englishman. The German was a great talker\r\nand preferred addressing as large an audience as possible, expatiating\r\non the \"uprising\" of Germany, on the irrepressible desire for\r\nexpansion to be found in the German people, on the necessity of\r\nimpregnating the world with German culture, and on the progress made\r\nin all these endeavours. He discoursed on the rising prosperity of\r\nGerman trade in different parts of the world; he enumerated the towns\r\nwhere the German flag was flying; he pointed out with emphasis how\r\n\"Made in Germany\" was the term that must and would conquer the world,\r\nand did not fail to assert that all these grand projects were built on\r\nsolid foundations upheld by military support. Such was the German.\r\nWhen my informant turned to the silent, quietly smiling Englishman and\r\nasked what he had to say to it, he simply answered: \"There is no need\r\nfor me to say anything, for I know that the world belongs to us.\" Such\r\nwas the Englishman. This merely illustrates a certain frame of mind.\r\nIt is a snapshot, showing how the German and the English mentality was\r\nreflected in the brain of a neutral statesman; but it is symptomatic,\r\nbecause thousands have felt the same, and because this impression of\r\nthe German spirit contributed so largely to the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe Aehrenthal policy, contrary to what we were accustomed to on the\r\nBallplatz, pursued ambitious plans for expansion with the greatest\r\nstrength and energy, thereby adding to the suspicions of the world\r\nregarding us. For the belief gained credence that the Vienna policy\r\nwas an offshoot of that of Berlin, and that the same line of action\r\nwould be adopted in Vienna as in Berlin, and the general feeling of\r\nanxiety rose higher. Blacker and blacker grew the clouds; closer and\r\ncloser the meshes of the net; misfortune was on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nI was in Constantinople shortly before the outbreak of war, and while\r\nthere had a lengthy discussion of the political situation with the\r\nMarkgraf Pallavicini, our most efficient and far-seeing ambassador\r\nthere. He looked upon the situation as being extremely grave. Aided by\r\nhis experience of a decade of political observations, he was able to\r\nput his finger on the pulse of Europe, and his diagnosis was as\r\nfollows: that if a rapid change in the entire course of events did not\r\nintervene, we were making straight for war. He explained to me that he\r\nconsidered the only possibility of evading a war with Russia lay in\r\nour definitely renouncing all claims to influence in the Balkans and\r\nleaving the field to Russia. Pallavicini was quite clear in his own\r\nmind that such a course would mean our resigning the status of a Great\r\nPower; but apparently to him even so bitter a proceeding as that was\r\npreferable to the war which he saw was impending. Shortly afterwards I\r\nrepeated this conversation to the Archduke and heir, Franz Ferdinand,\r\nand saw that he was deeply impressed by the pessimistic views of\r\nPallavicini, of whom, like everyone else, he had a very high opinion.\r\nThe Archduke promised to discuss the question as soon as possible with\r\nthe Emperor. I never saw him again. That was the last conversation I\r\nhad with him, and I do not know whether he ever carried out his\r\nintention of discussing the matter with the monarch.\r\n\r\nThe two Balkan wars were as summer lightning before the coming\r\nEuropean thunderstorm. It was obvious to anyone acquainted with Balkan\r\nconditions that the peace there had produced no definite result, and\r\nthe Peace of Bucharest in 1913, so enthusiastically acclaimed by\r\nRoumania, carried the germ of death at its birth. Bulgaria was\r\nhumiliated and reduced; Roumania and, above all, Serbia, enlarged out\r\nof all proportion, were arrogant to a degree that baffles description.\r\nAlbania, as the apple of discord between Austria-Hungary and Italy,\r\nwas a factor that gave no promise of relief, but only of fresh wars.\r\nIn order to understand the excessive hatred prevailing between the\r\nseparate nations, one must have lived in the Balkans. When this hatred\r\ncame to an outburst in the world war the most terrible scenes were\r\nenacted, and as an example it was notorious that the Roumanians tore\r\ntheir Bulgarian prisoners to pieces with their teeth, and that the\r\nBulgarians, on their part, tortured the Roumanian prisoners to death\r\nin the most shocking manner. The brutality of the Serbians in the war\r\ncan best be described by our own troops. The Emperor Francis Joseph\r\nclearly foresaw that the peace after the second Balkan war was merely\r\na respite to draw breath before a new war. Prior to my departure for\r\nBucharest in 1913 I was received in audience by the aged emperor, who\r\nsaid to me: \"The Peace of Bucharest is untenable, and we are faced by\r\na new war. God grant that it may be confined to the Balkans.\" Serbia,\r\nwhich had been enlarged to double its size, was far from being\r\nsatisfied; but, on the contrary, was more than ever ambitious of\r\nbecoming a Great Power.\r\n\r\nApparently the situation was still quiet. In fact, a few weeks before\r\nthe catastrophe at Sarajevo the prevailing state of affairs showed\r\nalmost an improvement in the relations between Vienna and Belgrade.\r\nBut it was the calm before the storm. On June 28 the veil was rent\r\nasunder, and from one moment to the next a catastrophe threatened the\r\nworld. The stone had started rolling.\r\n\r\nAt that time I was ambassador to Roumania. I was therefore only able\r\nfrom a distance to watch developments in Vienna and Berlin.\r\nSubsequently, however, I discussed events in those critical days with\r\nnumerous leading personalities, and from all that I heard have been\r\nable to form a definite and clear view of the proceedings. I have no\r\ndoubt whatever that Berchtold, even in his dreams, had never thought\r\nof a world war of such dimensions as it assumed; that he, above all,\r\nwas persuaded that England would remain neutral; and the German\r\nAmbassador, Tschirsky, confirmed him in the conviction that a war\r\nagainst France and Russia would inevitably end in victory. I believe\r\nthat the state of mind in which Count Berchtold addressed the\r\nultimatum to Serbia was such that he said to himself, either--and this\r\nis the most favourable view--Serbia will accept the ultimatum, which\r\nwould mean a great diplomatic success; or she will refuse it, and\r\nthen, thanks to Germany's help, the victorious war against Russia and\r\nFrance will effect the birth of a new and vastly stronger Monarchy. It\r\ncannot for a moment be denied that this argument contained a series of\r\nerrors; but it must be stated that, according to my convictions, Count\r\nBerchtold did not intend to incite war by the ultimatum, but hoped to\r\nthe very last to gain the victory by the pen, and that in the German\r\npromises he saw a guarantee against a war in which the participators\r\nand the chances of victory were equally erroneously estimated.\r\n\r\nBerchtold could not have entertained any doubt that a Serbian war\r\nwould bring a Russian one in its train. At any rate, the reports sent\r\nby my brother, who was a business man in Petersburg, left him in no\r\ndoubt on the matter.\r\n\r\nSerbia's acceptance of the ultimatum was only partial, and the Serbian\r\nwar broke out. Russia armed and joined in. But at this moment\r\nextremely important events took place.\r\n\r\nOn July 30, at midday, Tschirsky spoke in the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs, and communicated to Berchtold the contents of a telegram\r\nreceived from Lichnowsky. This important telegram contained the\r\nfollowing: He (Lichnowsky) had just returned from seeing Grey, who was\r\nvery grave, but perfectly collected, though pointing out that the\r\nsituation was becoming more and more complicated. Sassonoff had\r\nintimated that after the declaration of war he was no longer in a\r\nposition to negotiate direct with Austria-Hungary, and requested\r\nEngland to resume proceedings, the temporary cessation of hostilities\r\nto be taken for granted. Grey proposed a negotiation between four, as\r\nit appeared possible to him (Grey) that Austria-Hungary, after\r\noccupying Belgrade, would state her terms.\r\n\r\nTo this Grey added a private comment, calling Lichnowsky's attention\r\nto the fact that a war between Russia and Austria-Hungary would\r\nfacilitate England's neutrality, but that the conditions would\r\ninevitably change in the event of Germany and France being involved.\r\nPublic opinion in England, which after the assassination was very\r\nfavourable to Austria, was now beginning to fluctuate, as it was\r\ndifficult to understand Austria's obstinacy.\r\n\r\nLichnowsky also added that Grey had told the Italian Ambassador that\r\nhe thought Austria would receive every satisfaction on accepting\r\nnegotiation. In any case the Serbians would be punished. Even without\r\na war Austria would receive a guarantee for the future.\r\n\r\nSuch were the contents of the communication from London sent by\r\nTschirsky, to which Bethmann added that he urgently requested the\r\nVienna Cabinet to accept the negotiation. On receiving this\r\ninformation, Berchtold conveyed the news to the Emperor. His position\r\nwas this: that Russia was already at war with the Monarchy on the\r\nevening of the same day on which the order for general mobilisation\r\nwas to be submitted to the Emperor, and it appeared doubtful to him\r\nwhether a postponement of their own mobilisation would be possible in\r\nview of the Russian attack. He had also to take into consideration the\r\ndifferent parties prevailing in Russia, and no guarantee was\r\nobtainable that those who were in favour of negotiation would gain the\r\nday. Any postponement of mobilisation might in this case lead to\r\nincalculable military consequences. Obviously hostilities had begun\r\nwithout the knowledge and against the wishes of the Tsar; if they\r\nwere also to be carried on against his wish, then Austria-Hungary\r\nwould be too late.\r\n\r\nI have never discussed this phase with Berchtold, but the material\r\nplaced at my disposal leaves no doubt that he felt bound to inquire\r\ninto this side of the question and then leave the decision to the\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, July 31, therefore, Tschirsky, at the Ballplatz,\r\ncommunicated the contents of a telegram from King George to Prince\r\nHenry of Prussia. It ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thanks for telegram. So pleased to hear of William's efforts to\r\n  concert with Nicky to maintain peace. Indeed, I am earnestly\r\n  desirous that such an irreparable disaster as a European war\r\n  should be averted. My Government is doing its utmost, suggesting\r\n  to Russia and France to suspend further military preparations if\r\n  Austria will consent to be satisfied with occupation of Belgrade\r\n  and the neighbouring Serbian territory as a hostage for\r\n  satisfactory settlement of her demands, other countries meanwhile\r\n  suspending their war preparations. Trust William will use his\r\n  great influence to induce Austria to accept this proposal, thus\r\n  proving that Germany and England are working together to prevent\r\n  what would be an international catastrophe. Pray assure William I\r\n  am doing and shall continue to do all that lies in my power to\r\n  preserve peace of Europe.\r\n\r\n  GEORGE.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the telegrams cited were received in Vienna on July 31, subject\r\nto certain military precautions, a proceeding that did not satisfy\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIn London, as in Berlin, an effort was made to confine the conflict to\r\nSerbia. Berchtold did the same. In Russia there was a strong party\r\nworking hard to enforce war at any price. The Russian invasion was an\r\naccomplished fact, and in Vienna it was thought unwise to stop\r\nmobilisation at the last moment for fear of being too late with\r\ndefence. Some ambassadors did not keep to the instructions from their\r\nGovernments; they communicated messages correctly enough, but if their\r\npersonal opinion differed they made no secret of it, and it certainly\r\nweighed in the balance.\r\n\r\nThis added to the insecurity and confusion. Berchtold vacillated, torn\r\nhither and thither by different influences. It was a question of hours\r\nmerely; but they passed by and were not made use of, and disaster was\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nRussia had created strained conditions which brought on the world war.\r\n\r\nSome months after the outbreak of war I had a long conversation on all\r\nthese questions with the Hungarian Prime Minister, Count Stephen\r\nTisza. He was decidedly opposed to the severe ultimatum, as he foresaw\r\na war and did not wish for it. It is one of the most widely spread\r\nerrors to stigmatise Tisza to-day as one of the instigators of the\r\nwar. He was opposed to it, not from a general pacifist tendency, but\r\nbecause, in his opinion, an efficiently pursued policy of alliance\r\nwould in a few years considerably strengthen the powers of the\r\nMonarchy. He particularly returned to the subject of Bulgaria, which\r\nthen was still neutral and whose support he had hoped to gain before\r\nwe went to war. I also obtained from Tisza several details concerning\r\nthe activities of the German Government as displayed by the German\r\nAmbassador immediately preceding the war. I purposely made a\r\ndistinction between the German Government and the German diplomat, as\r\nI was under the impression that Herr von Tschirsky had taken various\r\nsteps without being instructed so to do, and when I previously have\r\nalluded to the fact that not all the ambassadors made use of the\r\nlanguage enjoined by their Governments, I had Herr von Tschirsky\r\nspecially in my mind; his whole temperament and feelings led him to\r\ninterfere in our affairs with a certain vehemence and not always in\r\nthe most tactful way, thus rousing the Monarchy out of its lethargy.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that all Herr von Tschirsky's private\r\nspeeches at this time were attuned to the tone of \"Now or Never,\" and\r\nit is certain that the German Ambassador declared his opinion to be\r\n\"that at the present moment Germany was prepared to support our point\r\nof view with all her moral and military power, but whether this would\r\nprove to be the case in future if we accepted the Serbian rebuff\r\nappears to me doubtful.\" I believe that Tschirsky in particular was\r\nfirmly persuaded that in the very near future Germany would have to go\r\nthrough a war against France and Russia, and he considered that the\r\nyear 1914 would be more favourable than a later date. For this reason,\r\nbecause first of all he did not believe in the fighting capacity of\r\neither Russia or France, and secondly because--and this is a very\r\nimportant point--he was convinced that he could bring the Monarchy\r\ninto this war, while it appeared doubtful to him that the aged and\r\npeace-loving Emperor Francis Joseph would draw the sword for Germany\r\non any other occasion where the action would centre less round him, he\r\nwished to make use of the Serbian episode so as to be sure of\r\nAustria-Hungary in the deciding struggle. That, however, was his\r\npolicy, and not Bethmann's.\r\n\r\nThis, I repeat, is the impression produced on me by lengthy\r\nconversations with Count Tisza--an impression which has been confirmed\r\nfrom other sources. I am persuaded, however, that Tschirsky, in\r\nbehaving as he did, widely overstretched his prescribed sphere of\r\nactivity. Iswolsky was not the only one of his kind. I conclude this\r\nto be so, since Tschirsky, as intimated in a former dispatch, was\r\nnever in a position to make an official declaration urging for war,\r\nbut appears only to have spoken after the manner of diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives when anxious to adapt the policy of their Government\r\nto their own point of view. Undoubtedly Tschirsky transmitted his\r\ninstructions correctly and loyally, nor did he keep back or secrete\r\nanything. An ambassador attains more or less according to the energy\r\nexpended by him in carrying out the instructions of his Government;\r\nand the private opinion of the ambassador is, under certain\r\ncircumstances, not easy to distinguish from his official one. At all\r\nevents, the latter will be influenced by the former, and Tschirsky's\r\nprivate opinion aimed at a more vigorous policy.\r\n\r\nIn complete ignorance of impending events, I had arrived at Steiermark\r\na few days before the ultimatum in order to establish my family there\r\nfor the summer. While there I received a message from Berchtold to\r\nreturn to my post as quickly as possible. I obeyed at once, but before\r\nleaving had one more audience with the Emperor Francis Joseph at\r\nIschl. I found the Emperor extremely depressed. He alluded quite\r\nbriefly to the coming events, and merely asked me if, in case of a\r\nwar, I could guarantee Roumania's neutrality. I answered in the\r\naffirmative, so long as King Carol was alive; beyond that any\r\nguarantee was impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nCertain extremely important details relating to the period immediately\r\npreceding the outbreak of war can only be attributed to the influence\r\nof the group represented by Tschirsky. It is incomprehensible why we\r\ngranted to our then allies, Italy and Roumania, facilities for playing\r\nthe part of seceders by presenting them with an ultimatum before\r\naction was completed, instead of winning them over and involving them\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nI am no accurate judge of the events in Rome, but King Carol in\r\nRoumania had certainly tried everything to induce Serbia to yield. In\r\nall probability he would not have succeeded, as Serbia had no idea of\r\nrenouncing her plans for a Greater Serbia; but presumably an anxious\r\nfeeling would have arisen between Bucharest and Belgrade, which would\r\nstrongly have influenced further Roumanian policy in our favour.\r\n\r\nBucharest has made enormous capital out of the diplomatic proceedings.\r\n\r\nBefore the first decisive Cabinet Council Baron Fasciotti, the Italian\r\nAmbassador, harangued all the members in this spirit, and declared\r\nthat the situation in Roumania and Italy was similar, and in each case\r\nthere was no reason for co-operation, as neither Rome nor Bucharest\r\nhad previously come to an understanding regarding the ultimatum. His\r\nefforts were crowned with success.\r\n\r\nOn August 1, 1914, I sent the following telegram to Berchtold:\r\n\r\n  \"The Prime Minister has just notified me the result of the Cabinet\r\n  Council. After a warm appeal from the King to bring the treaty\r\n  into force, the Cabinet Council, with one exception, declared that\r\n  no party could undertake the responsibility of such action.\r\n\r\n  \"The Cabinet Council has resolved that _as Roumania was neither\r\n  notified nor consulted concerning the Austro-Hungarian action in\r\n  Belgrade no casus foederis exists_. The Cabinet Council further\r\n  resolved that military preparations for the safety of the frontier\r\n  be undertaken, which would be an advantage for the\r\n  Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, as several hundred miles of its\r\n  frontiers would thereby be covered.\r\n\r\n  \"The Prime Minister added that he had already given orders to\r\n  strengthen all military posts, after which by degrees general\r\n  mobilisation would follow.\r\n\r\n  \"The Government intends only to publish a short communiqué\r\n  relating to the military measures taken for the safety of the\r\n  country.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, it appears incomprehensible why the ultimatum was drawn up\r\nas it was. It was not so much a manifestation of Berchtold's wish for\r\nwar, as of other influences, above all that of Tschirsky. In 1870\r\nBismarck also desired war, but the Ems telegram was of quite a\r\ndifferent character.\r\n\r\nIn the present case it appears incomprehensible why a Note should have\r\nbeen selected which by its wording gave umbrage to many who hitherto\r\nwere favourably disposed towards us.\r\n\r\nHad we, before the ultimatum and after the assassination, secretly and\r\nconfidentially furnished proofs to the Great Powers who were not\r\ninimical to us, and especially to England, that trouble was impending\r\nover a political murder staged at Belgrade, we should have evoked a\r\nvery different frame of mind in those Governments. Instead, we flung\r\nthe ultimatum at them and at the whole of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was feared probably at the Ballplatz that any communication to the\r\nPowers would result in their intervention in the form of a new\r\nconference of ambassadors, and that stagnation would ensue. But in the\r\nyear 1914 the case was very different from former days--before the\r\nultimatum right was so undoubtedly on our side.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the Tschirsky group dreaded such an insipid solution,\r\nand had insisted, therefore, on drastic action. In 1870 Bismarck was\r\nthe attacking party, and he succeeded in interchanging the parts. We\r\nalso succeeded, but in an opposite sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThen came our greatest disaster: the German entry into Belgium.\r\n\r\nHad England remained neutral we should not have lost the war. In his\r\nbook, \"Ursachen und Ausbruck des Krieges,\" page 172, Jagow tells how\r\non August 4, towards the close of the Reichstag session, the English\r\nAmbassador appeared there and again asked whether Germany would\r\nrespect Belgium's neutrality. At that time German troops were already\r\non Belgian soil. On hearing that, the Ambassador retired, but,\r\nreturning in a few hours, demanded a declaration, to be handed in\r\nbefore midnight, that the further advance of the German troops into\r\nBelgium would cease, otherwise he was instructed to ask for his\r\npassport and England would then protect Belgium. Germany refused, and\r\nthe consequence was a declaration of war by England.\r\n\r\nThat England on the same day sent word to Belgium that she would\r\nresist with her utmost strength any violation of her neutrality is\r\nfully in accordance with the steps taken at Berlin by the English\r\nAmbassador.\r\n\r\nTwo days before, on August 2, the English Cabinet certainly gave\r\nFrance the assurance that, in addition to the protection of Belgian\r\nneutrality, she had demanded that there should be no naval action\r\nagainst France. The contradiction between both points of view is\r\nclearly visible. It appears to me, however, that the only explanation\r\nis that on August 4 England no longer adhered to her standpoint of\r\nAugust 2, for the German acceptance of the English ultimatum on the\r\nevening of August 4 had wrested from England the moral possibility of\r\nmaking further claims. If England, on August 4, had sought a pretext\r\nfor war, she would have put forward, besides the Belgian demand, also\r\nthat referring to the abstention from naval action. But she did not do\r\nso, and confined her ultimatum to the Belgian question, thereby tying\r\nher own hands in the event of Germany accepting the ultimatum. _On\r\nthe night of August 4, between the hours of nine and midnight, the\r\ndecision as to whether England would remain neutral or no lay with\r\nGermany._\r\n\r\nGermany kept to her resolve to violate Belgian neutrality in spite of\r\nthe certainty of the English declaration of war resulting therefrom.\r\nThat was the first fateful victory of the militarists over the\r\ndiplomats in this war. The former were naturally the motive power.\r\n\r\nThe German military plan was to overrun France and then make a furious\r\nonslaught on Russia. This plan was shattered on the Marne.\r\n\r\nIn more respects than one, German policy foundered on the heritage\r\nleft by Bismarck. Not only was the conquest of Alsace-Lorraine a\r\nlasting obstacle to friendly relations with France, perpetually\r\nforcing the latter into the arms of every anti-German coalition, but\r\nBismarck's heritage became Germany's curse, because the Germans,\r\nthough desirous of following in his footsteps, had no one sufficiently\r\ncompetent to lead them therein.\r\n\r\nBismarck created the German Empire out of Düppel, Königgrätz and\r\nSedan. His policy was one of \"blood and iron\"--and for fifty years\r\nthat policy of violence and violent means had been engrained in the\r\nmind of every German schoolboy as the gospel of diplomatic art--but\r\nBismarck was not able to bequeath to the German people his genial\r\nefficiency, wisdom and prudence in the use of his violent means.\r\nBismarck carefully prepared the wars of 1866 and 1870, and struck when\r\nhe held good cards in his hand. The Germany of William II. had no\r\ndesire for war, but one day plunged headlong into it, and during the\r\nfirst week had already created political situations which were beyond\r\nher power to cope with. Belgium and Luxembourg were treated on the\r\nBismarckian principle of \"Might before Right,\" and the world rose\r\nagainst Germany. I say world, because England's power extended over\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war England stood at \"order arms.\" It would\r\nhave been entirely true to her traditional policy to allow Germany to\r\nfight against France and Russia and mutually weaken each other, then\r\nat a given moment to intervene and enjoin peace. England was forced to\r\njoin in by Germany threatening to establish herself in Belgium. How\r\nfar the German invasion of Belgium can morally be extenuated owing to\r\na French purpose to do likewise has still not been made clear--but\r\nthis argument does not apply to Luxembourg, and the breach of right\r\nremains the same whether the country where it occurs be large or\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Belgium and Luxembourg was a stroke of the Bismarckian\r\npolicy of violence, not carried out by politicians but by generals who\r\nwere devoid of Bismarck's power of calculating the devastating\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nLater on, during the course of the war, the German Supreme Command\r\nmade repeated use of violent means, which were more detrimental than\r\nuseful to us, though subsequently these means were morally justifiable\r\nand comprehensible; in fact, were directly forced on us, seeing that\r\nGermany was fighting for her existence, and her adversaries, who would\r\nnot come to an understanding, left her no choice of means. The use of\r\nnoxious gas, aerial attacks on open towns and the U-boat warfare were\r\nmeans used in desperation against a merciless enemy, who left women\r\nand children to die of starvation and declared day by day that Germany\r\nmust be annihilated.\r\n\r\nWhen war was declared, that murderous element was lacking, and it was\r\nonly the entry into neutral territory that fostered an atmosphere of\r\nsuch terrible hatred and vengeance and stamped the struggle as a war\r\nof annihilation.\r\n\r\nEngland's policy concerning Napoleon III. was more of a diplomatic\r\nthan a military nature, and everything tends to show that in the\r\npresent case England originally had no intention of joining in the\r\nconflagration, but was content to see Germany weakened by her own\r\nconfederates.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am in a position to review the situation no blame for the\r\nwrongly estimated English attitude can be attached to our ambassadors\r\nin London. Their predictions and warnings were correct, and the final\r\ndecision respecting the previously mentioned English ultimatum was\r\ntaken in Berlin and not in London. Moreover, the German Foreign\r\nOffice would never voluntarily have consented to the acts of violence,\r\nbut the military party, who cared neither for diplomatic reports nor\r\npolitical complications, carried everything before them.\r\n\r\nIt will always be particularly difficult in a war to define the limits\r\nof military and political spheres of action. The activities of both\r\nencroach to so great an extent on each other as to form one whole, and\r\nvery naturally in a war precedence is given to military needs.\r\nNevertheless, the complete displacement of politicians into\r\nsubordinate positions which was effected in Germany and thereby made\r\nmanifest the fact that the German Supreme Military Command had\r\npossessed itself of all State power of command, was a misfortune. Had\r\nthe politicians at Berlin obtained a hearing there would never have\r\nbeen any invasion of Belgium, nor yet the ruthless U-boat warfare, the\r\nabstention from which would in both cases have saved the life of the\r\nCentral Powers.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first day the Emperor William was as a prisoner in the\r\nhands of his generals.\r\n\r\nThe blind faith in the invincibility of the army was, like so much\r\nelse, an heirloom from Bismarck, and the \"Prussian lieutenant,\r\ninimitable save in Germany,\" became her doom. The entire German people\r\nbelieved in victory and in an Emperor who flung himself into the arms\r\nof his generals and took upon himself a responsibility far surpassing\r\nthe normal limit of what was bearable. Thus the Emperor William\r\nallowed his generals full liberty of action, and, to begin with, their\r\ntactics seemed to be successful. The first battle of the Marne was a\r\ngodsend for the Entente in their direst need. But, later, when the war\r\nlong since had assumed a totally different character, when the troops\r\nwere made stationary by the war of position and fresh enemies were\r\nconstantly rising up against us, when Italy, Roumania, and finally\r\nAmerica appeared on the scene, then did the German generals achieve\r\nmiracles of strategy. Hindenburg and Ludendorff became gods in the\r\neyes of the German people; the whole of Germany looked up to them and\r\nhoped for victory through them alone. They were more powerful than\r\nthe Emperor, and he, therefore, less than ever in a position to oppose\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBoth the generals drew the wellnigh unlimited measure of their power\r\ndirect from the Entente, for the latter left the Germans in no doubt\r\nthat they must either conquer or die. The terrified and suffering\r\npeople clung, therefore, to those who, as they believed, alone could\r\ngive them victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nAnglo-German competition, the increasing decadence of the Monarchy,\r\nand the consequent growing lust of conquest evinced by our neighbours\r\nhad prepared the soil for war. Serbia, by the assassination, brought\r\nabout an acute state of tension, and Russia profited thereby to fling\r\nherself on the Central Powers.\r\n\r\nThat appears to me to be briefly an objective history of the beginning\r\nof the war. Faults, errors and omissions from the most varied sources\r\nmay occur in it, but can neither alter nor affect the real nature of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nThe victorious Entente gives a different interpretation of it. They\r\nmaintain that Germany let loose the war, and the terrible peace of\r\nVersailles is the product of that conception, for it serves as\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nA neutral court of justice, as proposed by Germany, was refused. Their\r\nown witnesses and their own judges suffice for them. They are judge\r\nand prosecutor in one. In Dr. Bauer, the German-Austrian Secretary of\r\nState, they have certainly secured an important witness for their view\r\nof the case. In the winter of 1918 the latter openly declared that\r\n\"three Austro-Hungarian counts and one general had started the\r\nwar.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWere that true, then Germany would also have to bear a vast amount of\r\nblame. For the four \"guilty ones\" could not have incited to war\r\nwithout being sure of having Germany at their back, and were it true,\r\nthere could only have been a question of some plot laid by the\r\nAustro-Hungarian and the German Governments, in which case Germany,\r\nbeing the vastly superior military element, would undoubtedly have\r\nassumed the rôle of leader.\r\n\r\nBauer's statement shows that they who inflicted the punitive peace\r\nwere right.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nWhile the war was going on, a separate peace on our side that would\r\nhave delivered up Germany would have been treachery. But had attempts\r\nat peace failed owing to the claims put forward by Germany, we should\r\nhave been morally justified in breaking away from them, as we were\r\nunited together in a war of defence and not in a war of conquest.\r\nAlthough the German military party both dreamed and talked incessantly\r\nof conquest, which doubtless gave rise to a misunderstanding of the\r\nsituation, that was by no means the exclusive reason why peace could\r\nnot be attained. It simply was because on no consideration could the\r\nEntente be induced to pardon Germany. I have already mentioned this in\r\nmy speech of December 11, 1918,[2] in which I discoursed on politics\r\nin the world war: \"Ludendorff is exactly like the statesmen of France\r\nand England. None of them wishes to compromise, they only look for\r\nvictory: in that respect there is no difference between them.\" As long\r\nas I was in office the Entente would never come to an agreement with\r\nGermany _inter pares_, thereby directly forcing us to assume the part\r\nof a war of defence. Had we succeeded in what we so often attempted to\r\ndo, namely to make the Entente pronounce the saving word; and had we\r\never been able to make the Entente state that they were ready to\r\nconclude a _status quo_ peace with Germany, we would have been\r\nrelieved of our moral obligations. Against this may be quoted: \"_Salus\r\nrei publicas supreme lex_\"--in order to save the Monarchy Germany\r\nwould have to be given up, and therefore the other question must be\r\ninquired into as to whether the \"physical possibility\" of a separate\r\npeace really did exist. I also mentioned this matter in the aforesaid\r\nspeech, and expressly stated then, and withdraw nothing, that after\r\nthe entry of England, then of Italy, Roumania, and finally of America\r\ninto the war, I considered a victory peace on our side to be a Utopian\r\nidea. But up to the last moment of my official activities, I cherished\r\nthe hope of a _peace of understanding_ from month to month, from week\r\nto week, even from day to day, and believed that the possibility would\r\narise of obtaining such a peace of understanding, however great the\r\nsacrifices. Just as little as anyone else could I foresee the end\r\nwhich practically has arrived, nor yet the present state of affairs. A\r\ncatastrophe of such magnitude and such dimensions was never what I\r\nfeared. This is confirmed in the published report of my aforesaid\r\nspeech, where I say: \"A victory peace was out of the question; we are\r\ntherefore compelled to effect a peace with sacrifice.\" The Imperial\r\noffer to cede Galicia to Poland, and, indirectly, to Germany, arose\r\nout of this train of thought, as did all the peace proposals to the\r\nEntente, which always clearly intimated that we were ready for\r\n_endurable_ sacrifices.\r\n\r\nIt had always been obvious that the Entente would tear the Monarchy in\r\nshreds, both in the event of a peace of understanding and of a\r\nseparate peace. It was quite in keeping with the terms of the Pact of\r\nLondon of April 26, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions passed at that congress which prepared for Italy's\r\nentry into the war, determined the further course of the war, for they\r\nincluded the division of the Monarchy, and forced us, therefore, into\r\na desperate war of defence. I believe that London and Paris, at times\r\nwhen the fortune of war was on our side, both regretted the\r\nresolutions that had been adopted, as they prevented the dwellers on\r\nboth the Seine and the Thames from making any temporarily desired\r\nadvances to us.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1915 we received vague news of the contents of this\r\nstrictly secret London agreement; but only in February, 1917, did we\r\nobtain the authentic whole, when the Russian revolutionary Government\r\npublished a protocol referring to it, which subsequently was\r\nreproduced in our papers.\r\n\r\nI add this protocol to the appendix of the book,[3] as, in spite of\r\nits being so eminently important, it has not received adequate\r\nattention on the part of the public.\r\n\r\nAccording to the settlements, which were binding on the four\r\nStates--England, France, Russia, and Italy--the last-named was awarded\r\nthe Trentino, the whole of South Tyrol as far as the Brenner Pass,\r\nTrieste, Gorizia, Gradisca, the whole of Istria with a number of\r\nislands, also Dalmatia.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the war the Entente had further made binding promises\r\nto the Roumanians and Serbians, hence the need for the dissolution of\r\nthe Monarchy.\r\n\r\nHaving made these statements, I wish to explain why a separate peace\r\nwas a sheer impossibility for us. In other words, what were the\r\nreasons that prevented us from ending the war and becoming\r\nneutral--reasons which only left one possibility open to us: to change\r\nour adversary, and instead of fighting the Entente, together with\r\nGermany, to join the Entente and with her fight against Germany? It\r\nmust, above all, be kept in mind that up to the last days that I held\r\noffice the Eastern front was manned by Austro-Hungarian and German\r\ntroops all mixed together, and this entire army was under the Imperial\r\nGerman Command. We had no army of our own in the East--not in the true\r\nsense of the word, as it had been merged into the German army. That\r\nwas a consequence of our military inferiority. Again and again we\r\nresorted to German aid. We called repeatedly for help in Serbia,\r\nRoumania, Russia, and Italy, and were compelled to purchase it by\r\ngiving up certain things. Our notorious inferiority was only in very\r\nslight degree the fault of the individual soldier; rather did it\r\nemanate from the general state of Austro-Hungarian affairs. We entered\r\nthe war badly equipped and sadly lacking in artillery; the various\r\nMinisters of War and the Parliaments were to blame in that respect.\r\nThe Hungarian Parliament neglected the army for years because their\r\nnational claims were not attended to, and in Austria the Social\r\nDemocrats had always been opposed to any measures of defence, scenting\r\ntherein plans for attack and not defence.\r\n\r\nOur General Staff was in part very bad. There were, of course,\r\nexceptions, but they only prove the rule. What was chiefly wanting was\r\ncontact with the troops. These gentlemen sat with their backs turned\r\nand gave their orders. Hardly ever did they see the men at the front\r\nor where the bullets whistled. During the war the troops learned to\r\n_hate_ the General Staff. It was very different in the German army.\r\nThe German General Staffs exacted much, but they also achieved much;\r\nabove all, they exposed themselves freely and set an example.\r\nLudendorff, sword in hand, took Liége, accompanied by a couple of men!\r\nIn Austria archdukes were put into leading posts for which they were\r\nquite unsuited. Some of them were utterly incompetent; the Archdukes\r\nFriedrich, Eugen, and Joseph formed three exceptions. The first of\r\nthese in particular very rightly looked upon his post not as that of a\r\nleader of operations, but as a connecting link between us and Germany,\r\nand between the army and the Emperor Francis Joseph. He always acted\r\ncorrectly and with eminent tact, and overcame many difficulties. What\r\nwas left of our independence was lost after Luck.\r\n\r\nTo return, therefore, to the plan developed above: a separate peace\r\nthat would have contained an order for our troops on the Eastern front\r\nto lay down their arms or to march back would immediately have led to\r\nconflict at the front. Following on the violent opposition that such\r\nan order would naturally have aroused in the German leaders, orders\r\nfrom Vienna and counter-orders from Berlin would have led to a state\r\nof complete disorganisation, even to anarchy. Humanly speaking, it was\r\nout of the question to look for a peaceful and bloodless unravelment\r\nat the front. I state this in order to explain my firm conviction that\r\nthe idea that such a separating of the two armies could have been\r\ncarried out in mutual agreement is based on utterly erroneous\r\npremises, and also to prove that we have here the first factor\r\nshowing that we would not have ended the war by a separate peace, but\r\nwould, on the contrary, have been entangled in a new one.\r\n\r\nBut what would have been enacted at the front would also, and in\r\naggravated fashion, have been repeated throughout the entire country:\r\na civil war would have been inevitable.\r\n\r\nI must here explain a second misunderstanding, resulting also from my\r\nspeech of December 11, which is due to my statement that \"if we came\r\nout Germany could not carry on the war.\" I admit that this statement\r\nis not clearly expressed, and was interpreted as though I had intended\r\nto say that if we came out the immediate collapse of Germany was a\r\nforegone conclusion. I did not intend to say that, nor did I say or\r\nmean it. I meant to say that our secession from Germany would render\r\nimpossible a victorious ending of the war, or even a lasting\r\nsuccessful continuance of the war; that Germany through this would be\r\nfaced by the alternative of either submitting to the dictates of the\r\nEntente or of bringing up her supremest fighting powers and\r\nsuppressing the Monarchy, preparing for her the same fate as Roumania\r\nmet with. I meant to say that Austria-Hungary, if she allowed the\r\nEntente troops to enter, would prove such a terrible danger to Germany\r\nthat she would be compelled to use every means to forestall us and\r\nparalyse the move. Whoever imagines that the German military leaders\r\nwould not have seized the latter eventuality knows them but badly, and\r\nhas a poor opinion of their spirit. In order to be able to form an\r\nobjective judgment of this train of thought one should be able to\r\nenter into the spirit of the situation. In April, 1916, when I sent in\r\nmy resignation for other reasons, Germany's confidence in victory was\r\nstronger than ever. The Eastern front was free: Russia and Roumania\r\nwere out of action. The troops were bound westward, and no one who\r\nknew the situation as it was then can repudiate my assertion that the\r\nGerman military leaders believed themselves then to be nearer than\r\never to a victory peace; that they were persuaded they would take both\r\nParis and Calais and force the Entente to its knees. It is out of the\r\nquestion that at such a moment and under such conditions they could\r\nhave replied to the falling away of Austria-Hungary otherwise than by\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nAll who will not admit the argument, I would refer to a fact which it\r\nwould be difficult to evade. Six months afterwards, when there was\r\nalready clear evidence of the German collapse, when Andrassy declared\r\na separate peace, the _Germans, as a matter of fact, threw troops into\r\nthe Tyrol_. If they, when utterly exhausted, defeated, and ruined,\r\nwith revolution at their back, still held firmly to this decision and\r\nendeavoured to make a battlefield on Austrian territory, how much more\r\nwould they have done that six months earlier, when they still stood\r\nfull of proud defiance and their generals dreamed of victory and\r\ntriumph? What I, secondly, also would maintain is that the immediate\r\nconsequence of a separate peace would have been the conversion of\r\nAustria-Hungary into a theatre of war. The Tyrol, as well as Bohemia,\r\nwould have become fields of battle.\r\n\r\nIf it be maintained now that the great exhaustion from the war that\r\nprevailed throughout the Monarchy before April, 1917, had caused the\r\nentire population of the former Monarchy to rally round the Minister\r\nwho had concluded the separate peace, it is a conscious or unconscious\r\nuntruth. Certainly the Czechs were decidedly against Germany, and it\r\nwould not have been reasons of political alliance that would have\r\nprevented them from agreeing. But I would like to know what the Czech\r\npeople would have said if Bohemia had been turned into a theatre of\r\nwar and exposed to all the sufferings endured by this and all other\r\npeoples, and when to it had been added the devastation of the\r\nfatherland, for, let there be no doubt about it, the troops advancing\r\nwith flying colours from Saxony would have made their way to Prague\r\nand penetrated even farther. We had no military forces in Bohemia; we\r\nshould not have been able to check the advance, and quicker than\r\neither we or the Entente could have sent troops worth mentioning to\r\nBohemia, the Germans, drawing troops from their wellnigh\r\ninexhaustible reserves, would have marched either against us or\r\nagainst the Entente on our territory. The German-Austrian public would\r\nnot have been in agreement with such a Minister; the German\r\nNationalists and the German _bourgeoisie_ have no say in the matter.\r\n\r\nOn October 28 the German Nationalists published their own particular\r\npoint of view in the following manner:\r\n\r\n  \"The members of the German Nationalist parties were highly\r\n  indignant at the way in which Count Andrassy answered Wilson's\r\n  Note. Count Andrassy came from Hungary, and neither came to any\r\n  agreement with the Imperial German Government nor with the\r\n  representatives of the Executive Committee before drawing up the\r\n  Note. Although the peace negotiations were most warmly welcomed\r\n  and considered most necessary, still the one-sided action of Count\r\n  Andrassy in dispatching the Note to Wilson without previous\r\n  arrangement with the German Empire has roused the greatest\r\n  indignation in the German parties. A few days ago a delegation\r\n  from the German Executive Committee was in Berlin and was\r\n  favourably received by the German Imperial Government in the\r\n  matter of providing for German-Austria. Although German soldiers\r\n  fought by the side of ours in the Alps and the Carpathians, the\r\n  alliance has now been violated by this effort to approach Wilson\r\n  without the consent of the German Empire, as is expressly stated\r\n  in the Note. Besides which, no previous agreement with the\r\n  representatives of the German Executive Committee was sought for.\r\n  They were ignored and the answer was sent to Wilson. The German\r\n  Nationalist parties strongly protest against such an\r\n  _unqualifiable act_ and will insist in the German Executive\r\n  Committee that German-Austria's right of self-determination be\r\n  unconditionally upheld and peace be secured in concert with the\r\n  German Empire.\"\r\n\r\nNeither would the German-Austrian Social Democrats have been a party\r\nto such a movement.\r\n\r\nA conscious and intended misrepresentation of fact lies before us if\r\nit be maintained to-day that either the National Assembly or the\r\nAustrian Social Democrats would have approved of and supported such\r\npolicy. I again have in mind the Andrassy days.\r\n\r\nOn October 30 the National Assembly took up its position for action.\r\nDr. Sylvester drew up the report and pointed out the following:\r\n\r\n  \"It was, however, neither necessary nor desirable to make the\r\n  attempt in such a way as to create an incurable rupture between\r\n  German-Austria and the German Empire that would endanger the\r\n  future of our people. The German-Austrian National Assembly\r\n  asserts that the Note of October 27 from the Royal and Imperial\r\n  Minister for Foreign Affairs was drawn up and dispatched to\r\n  President Wilson without in any way coming to an agreement with\r\n  the representatives of the German-Austrian people. The National\r\n  Assembly protests all the more insistently against this proceeding\r\n  as the nation to which the present Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\n  belongs has expressly refused any joint dealings. The National\r\n  Assembly states that it and its organs alone have the right to\r\n  represent the German-Austrian people in all matters relating to\r\n  foreign affairs and particularly in all peace negotiations.\"\r\n\r\nThe protest met with no opposition in the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the chairman, Dr. Ellenbogen, the Social Democrat, spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  \"Instead of now telling the German Emperor that his remaining in\r\n  office is the greatest obstacle to peace\" (loud applause from the\r\n  Social Democrats), \"and if there ever were an object in Curtius's\r\n  famous leap, it would be comprehensible now were the German\r\n  Emperor to copy it to save his people, this coalition now seizes\r\n  the present moment to break away from Germany and in doing so\r\n  attacks German democracy in the rear. Those gentlemen arrived too\r\n  late to gain any profit from the peace. What now remains is the\r\n  _bare and shameful breach of faith_, the thanks of the House of\r\n  Austria, so styled by a celebrated German poet.\" (Applause from\r\n  the Social Democrats and the German Radicals.)\r\n\r\nIt was the attack on the separate peace that furnished the exceptional\r\nopportunity for Social Democrats and German Radicals to unite in\r\ncommon applause, probably the first instance of such a thing in all\r\nthese years of war.\r\n\r\nIf that could happen at a moment when it already was obvious that\r\nthere was no longer a possibility of making a peace of understanding\r\ntogether with Germany--what would have happened, I ask, at a time\r\nwhen this was by no means so clear to the great majority of the\r\npopulation; at a time when it was still far from certain, or, at\r\nleast, not to be proved mathematically, that we in time and together\r\nwith Germany might still be able to conclude a peace of understanding?\r\nDisbandment at the front, where all would be fighting against all,\r\ncivil war in the interior--such would have been the result of a\r\nseparate peace. And all that in order finally to impose on us the\r\nresolutions passed in London! For never--as I shall presently\r\nshow--had the Entente given up their decision, as they were bound to\r\nItaly, and Italy would allow of no change. Such a policy would have\r\nbeen as suicide from the sheer fear of death.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 I once discussed the whole question with the late Dr. Victor\r\nAdler, and pointed out to him the probabilities ensuing from a\r\nseparate peace.\r\n\r\nDr. Adler replied: \"For God's sake, do not plunge us into a war with\r\nGermany!\" After the entry of Bavarian troops into the Tyrol (Adler was\r\nthen a secretary in the Foreign Affairs department) he reminded me of\r\nour conversation, and added: \"The catastrophe we spoke of then has\r\narrived. The Tyrol will become a theatre of war.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone in Austria wished for peace. No one wanted a new war--and a\r\nseparate peace would have brought about not peace, but a new war with\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary, Stephen Tisza ruled with practically unlimited powers; he\r\nwas far more powerful than the entire Wekerle Ministry put together.\r\nAs applied to Hungary, a separate peace would also have meant the\r\ncarrying out of the Entente aims; that is, the loss of the largest and\r\nrichest territories in the north and south of Czecho-Slovakia,\r\nRoumania and Serbia. Is there anyone who can honestly maintain that\r\nthe Hungarians in 1917 would have agreed to these sacrifices without\r\nputting up the bitterest resistance? Everyone who knows the\r\ncircumstances must admit that in this case Tisza would have had the\r\nwhole of Hungary behind him in a fierce attack on Vienna. Soon after I\r\ntook office I had a long and very serious conversation with him on\r\nthe German and the peace questions. Tisza pointed out that the Germans\r\nwere difficult to deal with; they were arrogant and despotic; yet\r\nwithout them we could not bring the war to an end. The proposal to\r\ncede Hungarian territory (Transylvania) and also the plan to enforce\r\nan internal Hungarian reform in favour of the subject nationalities\r\nwere matters that were not capable of discussion. The congress in\r\nLondon in 1915 had adopted resolutions that were quite mad and never\r\ncould be realised, and the desire for destruction prevailing in the\r\nEntente could only be suppressed by force. In all circumstances, we\r\nmust keep our place by the side of Germany. In Hungary are many\r\ndifferent currents of feeling--but the moment that Vienna prepared to\r\nsacrifice any part of Hungary, the whole country would rise as one man\r\nagainst such action. In that respect there was no difference between\r\nhim--Tisza--and Karolyi. Tisza alluded to Karolyi's attitude before\r\nthe Roumanian declaration of war, referred to the attitude of\r\nParliament, and said that if peace were to be made behind Hungary's\r\nback she would separate from Austria and act independently.\r\n\r\nI replied that there was no question either of separating from Germany\r\nor of ceding any Hungarian territory, but that we must be quite clear\r\nas to what we had to guard should we be carried further through the\r\nGerman lust of conquest.\r\n\r\nThereupon Tisza pointed out that the situation was different. It was\r\nnot known for certain what had been determined at the conference in\r\nLondon (the protocol had not then been published), but that Hungarian\r\nterritory was promised to Roumania was just as certain as that the\r\nEntente was planning to intervene in Hungarian internal affairs, and\r\nboth contingencies were equally unacceptable. Were the Entente to give\r\nHungary a guarantee for the _status quo ante_ and to desist from any\r\ninternal interference it would alter the situation. Until then he must\r\ndeclare against any attempt at peace.\r\n\r\nThe conversation as it proceeded became more animated, owing\r\nparticularly to my accusing him of viewing all politics from a\r\nHungarian point of view, which he did not deny, though he maintained\r\nthat the dispute was a mere platonic one, as the Entente peace terms\r\nappeared to be such that Austria would be left with much less than\r\nHungary. I was also first to state the terms under which we could make\r\npeace; then only would it be seen whether extreme pressure brought to\r\nbear on Germany were advisable or not. There was no sense in Germany's\r\nadvocating peace if she intended to continue fighting. For Germany was\r\nfighting above all for the integrity of the Monarchy, which would be\r\nlost the moment Germany laid down her arms. Whatever German\r\npoliticians and generals said was of little consequence. As long as\r\nEngland remained bent on satisfying her Allies with our territory,\r\nGermany was the only protection against these plans.\r\n\r\nTisza had no desire for conquest beyond a frontier protection from\r\nRoumania, and he was decidedly opposed to the dismemberment of new\r\nstates (Poland); that would be to weaken not to strengthen Hungary.\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy discussion we agreed to bind ourselves to the\r\nfollowing policy:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) So long, as the determination made at the conference in\r\n        London, i.e. the destruction of the Monarchy, continues to\r\n        be the Entente's objective, we must fight on in the certain\r\n        hope of crushing that spirit of destruction.\r\n\r\n  (2) But as our war is purely a defensive war, it will on no\r\n        account be carried on for purposes of conquest.\r\n\r\n  (3) Any semblance of the weakening of our allied relations must be\r\n        avoided.\r\n\r\n  (4) No concession of Hungarian territory may take place without\r\n        the knowledge of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n  (5) Should the Austrian Ministry agree with the Foreign Minister\r\n        respecting a cession of Austrian territory, the Hungarian\r\n        Prime Minister will naturally acquiesce.\r\n\r\nWhen the conference in London and the destruction of the Monarchy came\r\ninto question, Tisza was entirely in the right, and that he otherwise\r\nto the end adhered to his standpoint is proved on the occasion of his\r\nlast visit to the Southern Slavs, which he undertook at the request of\r\nthe Emperor immediately before the collapse, and when in the most\r\nmarked manner he showed himself to be opposed to the aspirations of\r\nthe Southern Slavs.\r\n\r\nWhoever attempts to judge in objective fashion must not, when looking\r\nback from to-day, relegate all that has since happened to former\r\ndiscernible facts, but should consider that, in spite of all pessimism\r\nand all fears, the hopes of a reasonable peace of understanding, even\r\nthough involving sacrifices, still existed, and that it was impossible\r\nto plunge the Monarchy into a catastrophe at once for fear of its\r\ncoming later.\r\n\r\nIf the situation is described to-day as though the inhabitants of the\r\nMonarchy, and especially the Social Democrats, were favourably\r\ndisposed for any eventuality, even for a separate peace, I must again\r\nmost emphatically repudiate it. I bear in mind that Social Democracy\r\nwithout doubt was the party most strongly in favour of peace, and also\r\nthat Social Democracy in Germany, as with us, repeatedly stated that\r\nthere were certain limits to its desire for peace. The German Social\r\nDemocrats never agreed that Alsace-Lorraine ought to be given up, and\r\nnever have our Social Democrats voted for ceding Trieste, Bozen and\r\nMeran. This would in any case have been the price of peace--and also\r\nthe price of a separate peace--for, as I have already pointed out, at\r\nthe conference in London, which dates back to 1915, binding\r\nobligations had been entered into for the partition of the Monarchy,\r\nwhile all that had been promised to Italy.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Monarchy was quite inevitable, whether through the\r\nseparation from Germany or through the vacillation in the Entente\r\nranks--for the claims of the Italians, the Roumanians, the Serbians,\r\nand the Czechs had all been granted. In any case the Monarchy would\r\nhave fallen and German-Austria have arisen as she has done now; and I\r\ndoubt whether the part played by that country during the proceedings\r\nwould have recommended it to the special protection of the Entente.\r\nIt is a very great mistake, whether conscious or unconscious, to\r\nbelieve and to maintain that the population of German-Austria, and\r\nespecially the present leaders of Social Democracy, are devoid of any\r\nstrong national feeling. I refer to the part played by the Austrian\r\nSocial Democracy in the question of union. It was the motive power in\r\nthe union with Germany, and the papers repeated daily that no material\r\nadvantages which the Entente could offer to Austria could alter the\r\ndecision. How, therefore, can this same Social Democracy, whose entire\r\npolitical views and aims are subordinate to the desire for a union\r\nwith Germany--how can this Social Democracy demand a policy which,\r\nwithout doubt, must lead not only to a separation from Germany, but to\r\na fratricidal war with the German nation? And why condemn the\r\nupholding of allied relations when Andrassy was abused for doing the\r\nopposite?\r\n\r\nBut what was the situation in March, 1918, shortly before my\r\nresignation? Germany stood at the height of her success. I do not\r\npretend to say that her success was real. In this connection that is\r\nof no moment; but the Germans were persuaded that they were quite near\r\na victorious end, that after leaving the Eastern front they would\r\nthrow themselves on to the Western front, and that the war would end\r\nbefore America had time to come in. Their reckoning was at fault, as\r\nwe all know to-day. But for the German generals the will to victory\r\nwas the leading spirit, and all decisions arrived at by Germany\r\nagainst the defection of Austria-Hungary proceeded from that dominant\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, I stated in my speech of December 11, on foreign\r\npolicy, that neither the Entente nor Germany would conclude a peace of\r\nrenunciation. Since then I have had opportunity to speak with several\r\nmen of the Entente, and consequent on the views that I obtained, I\r\nfeel I must formulate my previous opinion in still stronger terms. I\r\ncame to the firm conclusion that the Entente--England above all--from\r\nthe summer of 1917 at any rate, had formed an unbending resolve to\r\nshatter Germany.\r\n\r\nFrom that time onwards England, with the obstinacy which is her chief\r\ncharacteristic, appears to have been determined not to treat further\r\nwith Germany, nor to sheathe her sword until Germany lay crushed to\r\nearth. It makes no difference in the matter that the German military\r\nparty--though for other reasons--from a total misconception of their\r\nchances of victory, steadily refused a peace involving sacrifice at a\r\ntime when it might have been possible. This is an historical fact, but\r\nas an upholder of truth I must distinctly state that I doubt whether\r\nconcessions would have changed the fate of Germany. _We_ could have\r\ngone over to the enemy--in 1917 and also in 1918; we could have fought\r\nagainst Germany with the Entente on Austro-Hungarian soil, and would\r\ndoubtless have hastened Germany's collapse; but the wounds which\r\nAustria-Hungary would have received in the fray would not have been\r\nless serious than those from which she is now suffering: she would\r\nhave perished in the fight against Germany, as she has as good as\r\nperished in her fight allied with Germany.\r\n\r\n_Austria-Hungary's watch had run down._ Among the few statesmen who in\r\n1914 wished for war--like Tschirsky, for instance--there can have been\r\nnone who after a few months had not altered and regretted his views.\r\nThey, too, had not thought of a world war. I believe to-day,\r\nnevertheless, that even without the war the fall of the Monarchy would\r\nhave happened, and that the assassination in Serbia was the first\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke Heir Apparent was the victim of Greater Serbia's\r\naspirations; but these aspirations, which led to the breaking away of\r\nour Southern Slav provinces, would not have been suppressed, but, on\r\nthe contrary, would have largely increased and asserted themselves,\r\nand would have strengthened the centrifugal tendencies of other\r\npeoples within the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nLightning at night reveals the country for a second, and the same\r\neffect was produced by the shots fired at Sarajevo. It became obvious\r\nthat the signal for the fall of the Monarchy had been given. The bells\r\nof Sarajevo, which began to toll half an hour after the murder,\r\nsounded the death knell of the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe feeling among the Austrian people, and especially at Vienna, was\r\nvery general that the outrage at Sarajevo was a matter of more\r\nimportance than the murder of an Imperial prince and his wife, and\r\nthat it was the alarm signal for the ruin of the Habsburg Empire.\r\n\r\nI have been told that during the period between the assassination and\r\nthe war, warlike demonstrations were daily occurrences in the Viennese\r\nrestaurants and people's parks; patriotic and anti-Serbian songs were\r\nsung, and Berchtold was scoffed at because he could not \"exert himself\r\nto take any energetic steps.\" This must not be taken as an excuse for\r\nany eventual mistakes on the part of the leaders of the nation, for a\r\nleading statesman ought not to allow himself to be influenced by the\r\nman in the street. It is only to prove that the spirit developed in\r\n1914 appears to have been very general. And it may perhaps be\r\npermitted to add this comment: how many of those who then clamoured\r\nfor war and revenge and demanded \"energy,\" would, now that the\r\nexperiment has totally failed, severely criticise and condemn\r\nBerchtold's \"criminal behaviour\"?\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible to say in what manner the fall of the\r\nMonarchy would have occurred had war been averted. Certainly in a less\r\nterrible fashion than was the case through the war. Probably much more\r\nslowly, and doubtless without dragging the whole world into the\r\nwhirlpool. We were bound to die. We were at liberty to choose the\r\nmanner of our death, and we chose the most terrible.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing it, we lost our independence at the outbreak of war.\r\nWe were transformed from a subject into an object.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate war once started, we were powerless to end it. At the\r\nconference in London the death sentence had been passed on the Empire\r\nof the Habsburgs and a separate peace would have been no easier a form\r\nof death than that involved in holding out at the side of our Allies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Supposed to be the Counts Berchtold, Tisza and Stürgkh and General\r\nConrad von Hohendorf.\r\n\r\n[2] See Appendix, p. 325.\r\n\r\n[3] See page 275.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nKONOPISCHT\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nKonopischt has become the cradle of manifold legends. The lord of the\r\ncastle was the first victim of the terrible world conflagration, and\r\nthe part that he played before the war has been the subject of much\r\nand partly erroneous commentary.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke and heir to the throne was a man of a very peculiar\r\nnature. The main feature of his character was a great lack of balance.\r\nHe knew no middle course and was just as eager to hate as to love. He\r\nwas unbalanced in everything; he did nothing like other people, and\r\nwhat he did was done in superhuman dimensions. His passion for buying\r\nand collecting antiquities was proverbial and fabulous. A first-rate\r\nshot, sport was for him a question of murdering _en masse_, and the\r\nnumber of game shot by him reached hundreds of thousands. A few years\r\nbefore his death he shot his 5,000th stag.\r\n\r\nHis ability as a good shot was phenomenal. When in India, during his\r\nvoyage round the world, and while staying with a certain Maharajah, an\r\nIndian marksman gave an exhibition of his skill. Coins were thrown\r\ninto the air which the man hit with bullets. The Archduke tried the\r\nsame and beat the Indian. Once when I was staying with him at\r\nEckartsau he made a _coup double_ at a stag and a hare as they ran; he\r\nhad knocked over a fleeing stag, and when, startled by the shot, a\r\nhare jumped up, he killed it with the second bullet. He scorned all\r\nmodern appliances for shooting, such as telescopic sights or automatic\r\nrifles; he invariably used a short double-barrelled rifle, and his\r\nexceptionally keen sight rendered glasses unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe artistic work of laying out parks and gardens became in latter\r\nyears his dominating passion. He knew every tree and every bush at\r\nKonopischt, and loved his flowers above everything. He was his own\r\ngardener. Every bed and every group was designed according to his\r\nexact orders. He knew the conditions essential to the life of each\r\nindividual plant, the quality of the soil required; and even the\r\nsmallest spot to be laid out or altered was done according to his\r\nminute instructions. But here, too, everything was carried out on the\r\nsame gigantic lines, and the sums spent on that park must have been\r\nenormous. Few people had the varied artistic knowledge possessed by\r\nthe Archduke; no dealer could palm off on him any modern article as an\r\nantique, and he had just as good taste as understanding. On the other\r\nhand, music to him was simply a disagreeable noise, and he had an\r\nunspeakable contempt for poets. He could not bear Wagner, and Goethe\r\nleft him quite cold. His lack of any talent for languages was\r\npeculiar. He spoke French tolerably, but otherwise no other language,\r\nthough he had a smattering of Italian and Czech. For years--indeed, to\r\nthe end of his life--he struggled with the greatest energy to learn\r\nHungarian. He had a priest living permanently in the house to give him\r\nHungarian lessons. This priest accompanied him on his travels, and at\r\nSt. Moritz, for instance, Franz Ferdinand had a Hungarian lesson every\r\nday; but, in spite of this, he continued to suffer from the feeling\r\nthat he would never be able to learn the language, and he vented his\r\nannoyance at this on the entire Hungarian people. \"Their very language\r\nmakes me feel antipathy for them,\" was a remark I constantly heard him\r\nmake. His judgment of people was not a well-balanced one; he could\r\neither love or hate, and unfortunately the number of those included in\r\nthe latter category was considerably the greater.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt about it that there was a very hard strain in Franz\r\nFerdinand's mentality, and those who only knew him slightly felt that\r\nthis hardness of character was the most notable feature in him and his\r\ngreat unpopularity can doubtless be attributed to this cause. The\r\npublic never knew the splendid qualities of the Archduke, and\r\nmisjudged him accordingly.\r\n\r\nApparently he was not always like that. He suffered in his youth from\r\nsevere lung trouble, and for long was given up by the doctors. He\r\noften spoke to me of that time and all that he had gone through, and\r\nreferred with intense bitterness to the people who were only waiting\r\nday by day to put him altogether on one side. As long as he was looked\r\nupon as the heir to the throne, and people reckoned on him for the\r\nfuture, he was the centre of all possible attention; but when he fell\r\nill and his case was considered hopeless, the world fluctuated from\r\nhour to hour and paid homage to his younger brother Otto. I do not for\r\na moment doubt that there was a great deal of truth in what the late\r\nArchduke told me; and no one knowing the ways of the world can deny\r\nthe wretched, servile egotism that is almost always at the bottom of\r\nthe homage paid to those in high places. More deeply than in the\r\nhearts of others was this resentment implanted in the heart of Franz\r\nFerdinand, and he never forgave the world what he suffered and went\r\nthrough in those distressful months. It was chiefly the ostensible\r\nvacillation of the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Count\r\nGoluchowski, that had so deeply hurt the Archduke, who had always\r\nimagined that Goluchowski was deeply attached to him. According to\r\nFranz Ferdinand's account, Goluchowski is supposed to have said to the\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph that the Archduke Otto ought now to be given\r\nthe retinue and household suitable for the heir to the throne as\r\nhe--Franz Ferdinand--\"was in any case lost.\" It was not so much the\r\nfact as the manner in which Goluchowski tried \"to bury him while still\r\nliving\" that vexed and hurt him whom a long illness had made\r\nirritable. But besides Goluchowski, there were numberless others whose\r\nbehaviour at that time he took greatly amiss, and his unparalleled\r\ncontempt of the world which, when I knew him, was one of his most\r\ncharacteristic features, appears--partly, at any rate--to date from\r\nhis experiences during that illness.\r\n\r\nIn connection with politics, too, this bitterness exercised a lasting\r\ninfluence on his entire mental outlook. I have been told by an\r\nauthentic witness that the Archduke, when suffering and combating his\r\nterrible disease, saw one day an article in a Hungarian paper which,\r\nin brutal and derisive tones, spoke of the Archduke's expectations of\r\nfuture government as laid aside, and gloated openly, with malicious\r\ndelight, over the probable event. The Archduke, who while reading the\r\narticle had turned ashen grey with rage and indignation, remained\r\nsilent for a moment and then made the following characteristic remark:\r\n\"Now I must get better. I shall live from now only for my health. I\r\nmust get better in order to show them that their joy is premature.\"\r\nAnd though this may not have been the only reason for his violent\r\nantipathy to everything Hungarian, there is no doubt that the episode\r\ninfluenced his mind considerably. The Archduke was a \"good hater\"; he\r\ndid not easily forget, and woe betide those upon whom he vented his\r\nhatred. On the other hand, though but few knew it, he had an\r\nuncommonly warm corner in his heart; he was an ideal husband, the best\r\nof fathers, and a faithful friend. But the number of those he despised\r\nwas incomparably greater than those who gained his affection, and he\r\nhimself was in no doubt whatever as to his being the most unpopular\r\nperson in the Monarchy. But there was a certain grandeur in this very\r\ncontempt of popularity. He never could bring himself to make any\r\nadvances to newspapers or other organs that are in the habit of\r\ninfluencing public opinion either favourably or unfavourably. He was\r\ntoo proud to sue for popularity, and too great a despiser of men to\r\nattach any importance to their judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke's antipathy to Hungary runs like a scarlet thread through\r\nthe political chain of his thoughts. I have been told that at the time\r\nwhen the Crown Prince Rudolf was frequently in Hungary shooting, the\r\nArchduke was often with him, and that the Hungarian gentlemen took a\r\npleasure in teasing and ridiculing the young Archduke in the presence\r\nand to the delight of the considerably older Crown Prince. Ready as I\r\nam to believe that the Crown Prince Rudolf enjoyed the jokes--and\r\nlittle do I doubt that there were men there who would act in such\r\nfashion so as to curry favour with the Crown Prince--I still think\r\nthat these unpleasant incidents in his youth weighed less in the\r\nbalance with Franz Ferdinand than the already-mentioned occurrences\r\nduring his illness.\r\n\r\nApart from his personal antipathies, which he transferred from a few\r\nHungarians to the entire nation, there were also various far-reaching\r\nand well-founded political reasons which strengthened the Archduke in\r\nhis antagonistic relations with Hungary. Franz Ferdinand possessed an\r\nexceptionally fine political _flair_, and this enabled him to see that\r\nHungarian policy was a vital danger to the existence of the whole\r\nHabsburg Empire. His desire to overthrow the predominance of the\r\nMagyars and to help the nationalities to obtain their rights was\r\nalways in his thoughts, and influenced his judgment on all political\r\nquestions. He was the steady representative of the Roumanians, the\r\nSlovaks, and other nationalities living in Hungary, and went so far in\r\nthat respect that he would have treated every question at once from an\r\nanti-Magyar point of view without inquiring into it in an objective\r\nand expert manner. These tendencies of his were no secret in Hungary,\r\nand the result was a strong reaction among the Magyar magnates, which\r\nhe again took as purely personal antagonism to himself, and as the\r\nyears went on existing differences increased automatically, until\r\nfinally, under the Tisza régime, they led to direct hostility.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke's antipathy to party leaders in Hungary was even stronger\r\nthan that he felt for Tisza, and he showed it particularly to one of\r\nthe most prominent figures of that time. I do not know for certain\r\nwhat took place between them; I only know that several years before\r\nthe catastrophe the gentleman in question was received in audience at\r\nthe Belvedere, and that the interview came to a very unsatisfactory\r\nend. The Archduke told me that his visitor arrived bringing a whole\r\nlibrary with him in order to put forward legal proofs that the\r\nMagyar's standpoint was the right one. He, the Archduke, snapped his\r\nfingers at their laws, and said so. It came to a violent scene, and\r\nthe gentleman, pale as death, tottered from the room.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that Ministers and other officials rarely waited on the\r\nArchduke without beating hearts. He was capable of flying out at\r\npeople and terrifying them to such a degree that they lost their heads\r\ncompletely. He often took their fright to be obstinacy and passive\r\nresistance, and it irritated him all the more.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was extremely easy to get on with him if one\r\nknew him well and did not stand in awe of him. I had many scenes with\r\nhim and often lost my temper, too; but there was never any lasting\r\nill-feeling. Once when at Konopischt we had a scene one evening after\r\ndinner because, he said, I always worked in opposition to him and\r\nrewarded his friendship by treachery. I broke off the conversation,\r\nremarking that, if he could say such things, any further serious\r\nconversation would be impossible, and I also stated my intention of\r\nleaving the next morning. We separated without saying good night to\r\neach other. Quite early next morning--I was still in bed--he appeared\r\nin my room and asked me to forget what he had said the previous\r\nevening, that he had not meant it seriously, and thus completely\r\ndisarmed my still prevailing vexation.\r\n\r\nA despiser of men, with his wits sharpened by his own experiences, he\r\nnever allowed himself to be fooled by servile cringing and flattery.\r\nHe listened to people, but how often have I heard him say: \"He is no\r\ngood; he is a toady.\" Such people never found favour with him, as he\r\nalways mistrusted them at the outset. He was protected more than\r\nothers in such high spheres from the poison of servility that attacks\r\nall monarchs.\r\n\r\nHis two best friends, and the men to whom--after his own nearest\r\nrelations--he was most attached, were his brother-in-law Albrecht von\r\nWürtemberg and the Prince Karl of Schwarzenberg.\r\n\r\nThe former, a man of charming personality, great intelligence, and\r\nequally efficient in political as in military matters, lived on a\r\nfooting of true brotherly unity with Franz Ferdinand, and also,\r\nnaturally, on terms of perfect equality.\r\n\r\nKarl of Schwarzenberg was the most sincere, honourable and\r\nstraightforward character I have ever encountered; a man who concealed\r\nthe truth from no one. Rich, independent, and devoid of personal\r\nambition, it was quite immaterial to him whether the Archduke was\r\npleased with what he asserted or no. He was his _friend_, and\r\nconsidered it his duty to be honest and open--and if necessary,\r\ndisagreeable. The Archduke understood, appreciated, and valued this\r\nattitude. I do not think there are many monarchs or heirs to the\r\nthrone who would have suffered, as the Archduke did, Schwarzenberg's\r\nsayings and doings.\r\n\r\nFranz Ferdinand was on very bad terms with Aehrenthal, who easily\r\nbecame abrupt and repellent. Still, there was another reason why two\r\nsuch hard millstones could not grind together. I do not believe that\r\nthe many reproaches launched against Aehrenthal by the Archduke were\r\nconsequent on political differences; it was more Aehrenthal's manner\r\nthat invariably irritated the Archduke. I had occasion to read some of\r\nAehrenthal's letters to Franz Ferdinand which, perhaps unintentionally,\r\nhad a slight ironical flavour which made the Archduke feel he was not\r\nbeing taken seriously. He was particularly sensitive in this respect.\r\n\r\nWhen Aehrenthal fell ill the Archduke made unkind remarks about the\r\ndying man, and there was great and general indignation at the want of\r\nfeeling shown by him. He represented the Emperor at the first part of\r\nthe funeral service, and afterwards received me at the Belvedere. We\r\nwere standing in the courtyard when the procession, with the hearse,\r\npassed on the way to the station. The Archduke disappeared quickly\r\ninto a cottage close by, the windows of which looked on to the road,\r\nand there, concealed behind the window curtain, he watched the\r\nprocession pass. He said not a word, but his eyes were full of tears.\r\nWhen he saw that I noticed his emotion he turned away angrily, vexed\r\nat having given proof of his weakness. It was just like him. He would\r\nrather be considered hard and heartless than soft and weak, and\r\nnothing was more repugnant to him than the idea that he had aroused\r\nsuspicion of striving to enact a touching scene. I have no doubt that\r\nat that moment he was suffering the torture of self-reproach, and\r\nprobably suffered the more through being so reserved and unable to\r\ngive free play to his feelings.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke could be extremely gay, and possessed an exceptionally\r\nstrong sense of humour. In his happiest years he could laugh like any\r\nyouth, and carried his audience with him by his unaffected merriment.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a German prince, who was unable to distinguish between\r\nthe numerous archdukes, came to Vienna. A dinner was given in his\r\nhonour at the Hofburg, where he was seated next to Franz Ferdinand.\r\nPart of the programme was that he was to have gone the next morning\r\nwith the Archduke to shoot in the neighbourhood. The German prince,\r\nwho mistook the Archduke Franz Ferdinand for someone else, said to him\r\nduring dinner: \"I am to go out shooting to-morrow, and I hear it is to\r\nbe with that tiresome Franz Ferdinand; I hope the plan will be\r\nchanged.\" As far as I know, the expedition did not take place; but I\r\nnever heard whether the prince discovered his mistake. The Archduke,\r\nhowever, laughed heartily for days at the episode.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke invariably spoke of his nephew, the present Emperor\r\nCharles, with great affection. The relations between the two were,\r\nhowever, always marked by the absolute subordination of the nephew to\r\nthe uncle. In all political discussions, too, the Archduke Charles was\r\nalways the listener, absorbing the precepts expounded by Franz\r\nFerdinand.\r\n\r\nCharles's marriage met with the full approval of his uncle. The\r\nDuchess of Hohenberg, too, entertained the warmest affection for the\r\nyoung couple.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke was a firm partisan of the Great-Austria programme. His\r\nidea was to convert the Monarchy into numerous more or less\r\nindependent National States, having in Vienna a common central\r\norganisation for all important and absolutely necessary affairs--in\r\nother words to substitute Federalisation for Dualism. Now that, after\r\nterrible military and revolutionary struggles, the development of the\r\nformer Monarchy has been accomplished in a national spirit, there\r\ncannot be many to contend that the plan is Utopian. At that time,\r\nhowever, it had many opponents who strongly advised against dissecting\r\nthe State in order to erect in its place something new and \"presumably\r\nbetter,\" and the Emperor Francis Joseph was far too conservative and\r\nfar too old to agree to his nephew's plans. This direct refusal of the\r\nidea cherished by the Archduke offended him greatly, and he complained\r\noften in bitter terms that the Emperor turned a deaf ear to him as\r\nthough he were the \"lowest serving man at Schönbrunn.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archduke lacked the knowledge of how to deal with people. He\r\nneither could nor would control himself, and, charming though he could\r\nbe when his natural heartiness was allowed free scope, just as little\r\ncould he conceal his anger and ill-humour. Thus it came about that the\r\nrelations between him and the aged Emperor grew more and more\r\nstrained. There were doubtless faults on both sides. The standpoint of\r\nthe old Emperor, that as long as he lived no one else should\r\ninterfere, was in direct opposition to that of the Archduke, who held\r\nthat he would one day have to suffer for the present faults in the\r\nadministration, and anyone acquainted with life at court will know\r\nthat such differences between the highest individuals are quickly\r\nraked together and exaggerated. At every court there are men who seek\r\nto gain their master's favour by pouring oil on the flames, and who,\r\nby gossip and stories of all kinds, add to the antipathy that\r\nprevails. Thus it was in this case, and, instead of being drawn closer\r\ntogether, the two became more and more estranged.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke had but few friends, and under the old monarch\r\npractically none at all. That was one of the reasons for the advances\r\nhe made to the Emperor William. In reality, they were men of such a\r\ndifferent type that there could be no question of friendship in the\r\ntrue sense of the word, or any real understanding between him and the\r\nEmperor William, and the question was never mooted practically. The\r\nonly point common to both their characters was a strongly defined\r\nautocratic trait. The Archduke had no sympathy with the speeches of\r\nthe Emperor William, nor yet with his obvious desire for popularity,\r\nwhich the Archduke could not understand. The Emperor William, on his\r\npart, undoubtedly grew more attached to the Archduke during his latter\r\nyears than he had been originally. Franz Ferdinand was not on such\r\ngood terms with the Crown Prince of Germany. They spent some weeks\r\ntogether at St. Moritz in Switzerland, without learning to know each\r\nother any better; but this can readily be explained by the difference\r\nin age and also by the much more serious views of life held by the\r\nArchduke.\r\n\r\nThe isolation and retirement in which the Archduke lived, and the\r\nregrettably restricted intercourse he had with other circles, gave\r\nrise to the circulation of some true, besides numerous false, rumours.\r\nOne of these rumours, which is still obstinately kept up, was to the\r\neffect that the Archduke was a fanatic for war and looked upon war as\r\na necessary aid to the realisation of his plans for the future.\r\nNothing could be more untrue, and, although the Archduke never openly\r\nadmitted it to me, I am convinced that he had an instinctive feeling\r\nthat the Monarchy would never be able to bear the terrible test of\r\nstrength of a war, and the fact is that, instead of working to\r\nencourage war, his activities lay all in the opposite direction. I\r\nrecollect an extremely symptomatic episode: I do not remember the\r\nexact date, but it was some time before the death of the Archduke. One\r\nof the well-known Balkan turmoils threw the Monarchy into a state of\r\nagitation, and the question whether to mobilise or not became the\r\norder of the day. I chanced to be in Vienna, where I had an interview\r\nwith Berchtold who spoke of the situation with much concern and\r\ncomplained that the Archduke was acting in a warlike spirit. I offered\r\nto draw the Archduke's attention to the danger of the proceeding, and\r\nput myself in telegraphic communication with him. I arranged to join\r\nhis train that same day when he passed through Wessely on his way to\r\nKonopischt. I only had the short time between the two stations for my\r\nconversation. I therefore at once took the bull by the horns and told\r\nhim of the rumours current about him in Vienna and of the danger of\r\npromoting a conflict with Russia by too strong action in the Balkans.\r\nI did not meet with the slightest opposition from the Archduke, and in\r\nhis usual expeditious way he wrote, while still in the train, a\r\ntelegram to Berchtold in which he expressed his perfect agreement in\r\nmaintaining a friendly attitude and repudiated all the reports of his\r\nhaving been opposed to it. It is a fact that certain of the military\r\nparty, who were anxious for war, made use of the Archduke, or rather\r\nmisused him, in order to carry on a military propaganda in his name\r\nand thus gave rise to so wrongful an estimate of him. Several of these\r\nmen died a hero's death in the war; others have disappeared and are\r\nforgotten. Conrad, Chief of the General Staff, was never among those\r\nwho misused the Archduke. He could never have done such a thing. He\r\ncarried out himself what he considered necessary and did it openly and\r\nin face of everybody.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these reports about the Archduke there is one\r\nremarkable detail that is worthy of note. He told me himself how a\r\nfortune-teller once predicted that \"he would one day let loose a world\r\nwar.\" Although to a certain extent this prophecy flattered him,\r\ncontaining as it did the unspoken recognition that the world would\r\nhave to reckon on him as a powerful factor, still he emphatically\r\npointed out how mad such a prophecy was. It was fulfilled, however,\r\nlater, though very differently from what was meant originally, and\r\nnever was prince more innocent of causing blood to flow than the\r\nunhappy victim of Sarajevo.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke suffered most terribly under the conditions resulting\r\nfrom his unequal marriage. The sincere and true love he felt for his\r\nwife kept alive in him the wish to raise her to his rank and\r\nprivileges, and the constant obstacles that he encountered at all\r\ncourt ceremonies embittered and angered him inexpressibly. The\r\nArchduke was firmly resolved that when he came to the throne he would\r\ngive to his wife, not the title of Empress, but a position which,\r\nthough without the title, would bestow upon her the highest rank. His\r\nargument was that wherever he was she would be the mistress of the\r\nhouse, and as such was entitled to the highest position, \"therefore\r\nshe will take precedence of all the archduchesses.\" Never did the\r\nArchduke show the slightest wish to alter the succession and put his\r\nson in place of the Archduke Charles. On the contrary, he was resolved\r\nthat his first official act on coming to the throne would be to\r\npublish a solemn declaration containing his intention, in order to\r\ncounteract the ever-recurring false and biassed statements. As regards\r\nhis children, for whom he did everything that a loving father's heart\r\ncould devise, his greatest wish was to see them become wealthy,\r\nindependent private individuals, and able to enjoy life without any\r\nmaterial cares. His plan was to secure the title of Duke of Hohenberg\r\nfor his eldest son. It was, therefore, in harmony with this intention\r\nthat the Emperor Charles conferred the title on the youth.\r\n\r\nOne fine quality in the Archduke was his fearlessness. He was quite\r\nclear that the danger of an attempt to take his life would always be\r\npresent, and he often spoke quite simply and openly of such a\r\npossibility. A year before the outbreak of war he informed me that the\r\nFreemasons had resolved to kill him. He even gave me the name of the\r\ntown where the resolution was passed--it has escaped my memory\r\nnow--and mentioned the names of several Austrian and Hungarian\r\npoliticians who must have been in the secret. He also told me that\r\nwhen he went to the coronation in Spain he was to have made the\r\njourney with a Russian Grand Duke, but shortly before the train\r\nstarted the news came that the Grand Duke had been murdered on the\r\nway. He did not deny that it was with mixed feelings that he stepped\r\ninto his compartment. When at St. Moritz news was sent him that two\r\nTurkish anarchists had arrived in Switzerland intending to murder him,\r\nthat every effort was being made to capture them, but that so far no\r\ntrace of them had been discovered, and he was advised to be on his\r\nguard. The Archduke showed me the telegram at the time. He laid it\r\naside without the slightest sign of fear, saying that such events,\r\nwhen announced beforehand, seldom were carried out. The Duchess\r\nsuffered all the more in her fears for his life, and I think that in\r\nimagination the poor lady often went through the catastrophe of which\r\nshe and her husband were the victims. Another praiseworthy feature in\r\nthe Archduke was that, out of consideration for his wife's anxiety, he\r\ntolerated the constant presence of a detective, which not only bored\r\nhim terribly but in his opinion was absurd. He was afraid that if the\r\nfact became known it would be imputed to timidity on his part, and he\r\nconceded the point solely with the view of calming his wife's fears.\r\n\r\nBut he anxiously concealed all his good qualities and took an\r\nobstinate pleasure in being hard and disagreeable. I will not\r\nendeavour here to excuse certain traits in his character. His strongly\r\npronounced egotism cannot be denied any more than the hardness of\r\ncharacter, which made him insensible to the sufferings of all who were\r\nnot closely connected with him. He also made himself hated by his\r\nsevere financial proceedings and his inexorable judgment on any\r\nsubordinate whom he suspected of the slightest dishonesty. In this\r\nconnection there are hundreds of anecdotes, some true, some false.\r\nThese petty traits in his character injured him in the eyes of the\r\ngreat public, while the really great and manly qualities he possessed\r\nwere unknown to them, and were not weighed in the balance in his\r\nfavour. For those who knew him well his great and good qualities\r\noutweighed the bad ones a hundredfold.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was always very perturbed concerning the Archduke's plans\r\nfor the future. There was a stern trait also in the old monarch's\r\ncharacter, and in the interests of the Monarchy he feared the\r\nimpetuosity and obstinacy of his nephew. Nevertheless, he often took a\r\nvery magnanimous view of the matter. For instance, Count Stürgkh, the\r\nmurdered Prime Minister, gave me details respecting my nomination to\r\nthe Herrenhaus which are very characteristic of the old monarch. It\r\nwas Franz Ferdinand's wish that I should be in the Herrenhaus, as he\r\nwas anxious for me to be one of a delegation and also to profit by my\r\nextensive training in the province of foreign policy. I must mention\r\nhere that it had been impressed on the Emperor on all sides that the\r\nArchduke's friends and trusted men were working against him; a version\r\nof affairs which to a certain degree he obviously believed, owing to\r\nhis numerous disputes with Franz Ferdinand. On Stürgkh mentioning my\r\nname as a candidate for the Herrenhaus, the Emperor hesitated a moment\r\nand then said: \"Ah, yes. That is the man who is to be Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs when I am dead. Let him go to the Herrenhaus that he\r\nmay learn a little more.\"\r\n\r\nPolitical discussions with the Emperor Francis Joseph were often very\r\ndifficult, as he kept strictly to the Government department in\r\nquestion and only discussed what referred thereto. While I was\r\nambassador the Emperor would discourse to me on Roumania and the\r\nBalkans, but on nothing else. Meanwhile, the different questions were\r\noften so closely interwoven that it was impossible to separate them. I\r\nremember at one audience where I submitted to the Emperor the\r\nRoumanian plans for a closer connection with the Monarchy--plans which\r\nI shall allude to in a later chapter--and in doing so I was naturally\r\nbound to state what the Roumanians proposed respecting the closer\r\nconnection with Hungary, and also what changes would be necessitated\r\nthereby in the Hungarian administration. The Emperor at once broke off\r\nthe conversation, saying that it was a matter of Hungarian internal\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe old Emperor was almost invariably kind and friendly, and to the\r\nvery last his knowledge of the smallest details was astonishing. He\r\nnever spoke of the different Roumanian Ministers as the Minister of\r\nAgriculture, of Trade, or whatever it might be, but mentioned them all\r\nby name and never made a mistake.\r\n\r\nI saw him for the last time in October, 1916, after my definite return\r\nfrom Roumania, and found him then quite clear and sound mentally,\r\nthough failing in bodily health.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Francis Joseph was a \"Grand Seigneur\" in the true sense of\r\nthe word. He was an Emperor and remained always unapproachable.\r\nEveryone left his presence feeling he had stood before an Emperor. His\r\ndignity in representing the monarchical idea was unsurpassed by any\r\nsovereign in Europe.\r\n\r\nHe was borne to his grave at a time of great military successes for\r\nthe Central Powers. He lies now in the Imperial vault, and a century\r\nseems to have elapsed since his death; the world is changed.\r\n\r\nDay by day streams of people pass by the little church, but no one\r\nprobably gives a thought to him who lies in peace and forgotten, and\r\nyet he, through many long years, embodied Austria, and his person was\r\na common centre for the State that so rapidly was falling asunder.\r\n\r\nHe is now at rest, free from all care and sorrow; he saw his wife, his\r\nson, his friends all die, but Fate spared him the sight of his\r\nexpiring Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND _Photo: Pietzner, Vienna._]\r\n\r\nFranz Ferdinand's character held many sharply defined corners and\r\nedges; judging him objectively, no one can deny his great faults.\r\nThough the circumstances of his death were so tragic, it may well be\r\nthat for him it was a blessing. It is hardly conceivable that, once on\r\nthe throne, the Archduke would have been able to carry out his plans.\r\nThe structure of the Monarchy which he was so anxious to strengthen\r\nand support was already so rotten that it could not have stood any\r\ngreat innovations, and if not the war, then probably the Revolution,\r\nwould have shattered it. On the other hand, there seems to be no doubt\r\nthat the Archduke, with all the vehemence and impulsiveness of his\r\ncharacter, would have made the attempt to rebuild the entire structure\r\nof the Monarchy. It is futile to comment on the chances of his\r\nsuccess, but according to human foresight the experiment would not\r\nhave succeeded, and he would have succumbed beneath the ruins of the\r\nfalling Monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is also futile to conjecture how the Archduke would have acted had\r\nhe lived to see the war and the upheaval. I think that in two respects\r\nhis attitude would have differed from that taken. In the first place,\r\nhe never would have agreed to our army being under German control. It\r\nwould not have been consistent with his strongly developed autocratic\r\ntendencies, and he was too clever politically not to see that we\r\nshould thereby lose all political freedom of action. In the second\r\nplace, he would not, like the Emperor Charles, have yielded to\r\nrevolution. He would have gathered his faithful followers round him\r\nand would have fallen fighting, sword in hand. He would have fallen as\r\ndid his greatest and most dangerous enemy, Stephen Tisza.\r\n\r\nBut he died the death of a hero on the field of honour, valiantly and\r\nin harness. The golden rays of the martyr's crown surrounded his dying\r\nhead. Many there were who breathed more freely on hearing the news of\r\nhis death. At the court in Vienna and in society at Budapest there was\r\nmore joy than sorrow, the former having rightly foreseen that he would\r\nhave dealt hardly with them. None of them could guess that the fall of\r\nthe strong man would carry them all with it and engulf them in a world\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nFranz Ferdinand will remain portrayed in history as a man who either\r\nloved or hated. But his tragic end at the side of his wife, who would\r\nnot allow death to separate them, throws a mild and conciliatory light\r\non the whole life of this extraordinary man, whose warm heart to the\r\nvery last was devoted to his Fatherland and duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThere was a widely-spread but entirely wrongful idea in the Monarchy\r\nthat the Archduke had drawn up a programme of his future activities.\r\nThis was not the case. He had very definite and pronounced ideas for\r\nthe reorganisation of the Monarchy, but the ideas never developed into\r\na concrete plan--they were more like the outline of a programme that\r\nnever was completed in detail. The Archduke was in touch with experts\r\nfrom the different departments; he expounded the fundamental views of\r\nhis future programme to prominent military and political officials,\r\nreceiving from them hints on how to materialise these views; but a\r\nreally finished and thought-out programme was never actually produced.\r\nThe ground lines of his programme were, as already mentioned, the\r\nabolition of the dualism and the reorganisation of the Monarchy to\r\nform a federative state. He was not clear himself into how many states\r\nthe Habsburg Monarchy should be converted, but the principle was the\r\nrebuilding of the Monarchy on a national basis. Having always in view\r\nthat prosperity depended on the weakening of the Magyar influence, the\r\nArchduke was in favour of a strong preference for the different\r\nnationalities living in Hungary, the Roumanians in particular. Not\r\nuntil my return to Bucharest and following on my reports did the\r\nArchduke conceive the plan of ceding Transylvania to Roumania and thus\r\nadding Greater Roumania to the Habsburg Empire.\r\n\r\nHis idea was to make of Austria separate German, Czech, Southern Slav\r\nand Polish states, which in some respects would be autonomous; in\r\nothers, would be dependent on Vienna as the centre. But, so far as I\r\nknow, his programme was never quite clearly defined, and was subject\r\nto various modifications.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke had a great dislike for the Germans, especially the\r\nnorthern Bohemians, who were partisans of the Pan-Germanic tendencies,\r\nand he never forgave the attitude of the Deputy Schönerer. He had a\r\ndecided preference for all Germans in the Alpine countries, and\r\ngenerally his views were very similar to those of the Christian\r\nSocialists. His political ideal was Lueger. When Lueger was lying ill\r\nthe Archduke said to me: \"If God will only spare this man, no better\r\nPrime Minister could be found.\" Franz Ferdinand had a keen desire for\r\na more centralised army. He was a violent opponent of the endeavours\r\nof the Magyars whose aim was an independent Hungarian army, and the\r\nquestion of rank, word of command, and other incidental matters could\r\nnever be settled as long as he lived, because he violently resisted\r\nall Hungarian advances.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke had a special fondness for the navy. His frequent visits\r\nto Brioni brought him into close touch with our navy. He was always\r\nanxious to transform the Austrian Navy into one worthy of a Great\r\nPower. In regard to foreign policy, the Archduke was always in favour\r\nof a Triple Alliance of the three Emperors. The chief motive of this\r\nidea must have been that, in the three then apparently so powerful\r\nmonarchs at Petersburg, Berlin and Vienna, he saw the strongest\r\nsupport against revolution, and wished thereby to build up a strong\r\nbarrier against disorganisation. He saw great danger to the friendly\r\nrelations between Russia and ourselves in the rivalry between Vienna\r\nand Petersburg in the Balkans, and contrary to the reports that have\r\nbeen spread about him, he was rather a partisan than an opposer of\r\nSerbia. He was in favour of the Serbians because he felt assured that\r\nthe petty agrarian policy of the Magyars was responsible for the\r\nconstant annoyance of the Serbians. He favoured meeting Serbia\r\nhalf-way, because he considered that the Serbian question was a source\r\nof discord between Vienna and Petersburg. Another reason was that he\r\nwas no friend of King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, who constantly pursued an\r\nanti-Serbian policy. I believe that if those who were responsible for\r\nthe organisation of the assassination of the Archduke had known what\r\nlittle justification there was for supposing him to be the man they\r\nthought him, they would have desisted.\r\n\r\nFranz Ferdinand had a very pronounced feeling that in spite of all\r\nalliances the Monarchy must remain independent. He was opposed to any\r\ncloser combine with Germany, not wishing to be bound to Germany more\r\nthan to Russia, and the plan that was formulated later as \"Central\r\nEurope\" was always far removed from his wishes and endeavours.\r\n\r\nHis plans for the future were not worked out, not complete, but they\r\nwere sound. This, however, is not sufficient to enable one to say that\r\nthey could have been successfully carried out. In certain\r\ncircumstances more harm than good will result from energy devoid of\r\nthe necessary calm prudence, wisdom and, above all, patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWILLIAM II\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe Emperor William has been for so long the centre of historic\r\nevents, so much has been written about him, that apparently he should\r\nbe known to all the world; and yet I believe he has often been\r\nmisrepresented.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the scarlet thread running through the whole\r\ncharacter of William II. was his firm conviction that he was the\r\n\"elect of God,\" and that the dynasty was inextricably bound to the\r\nGerman people. Bismarck also believed in the dynastic fidelity of the\r\nGermans. It seems to me that there is just as little dynastic as\r\nrepublican spirit in nations--just as little in the Germans as in\r\nothers. There is merely a feeling of content or discontent which\r\nmanifests itself either for or against the dynasty and the form of\r\ngovernment. Bismarck himself was a proof of the justice of this\r\nargument. As he himself always maintained, he was thoroughly\r\ndynastic--but only during the lifetime of the Emperor William I. He\r\nhad no love for William II., who had treated him badly, and made no\r\nsecret of his feelings. He hung the picture of the \"young man\" in the\r\nscullery and wrote a book about him which, owing to its contents,\r\ncould not be published.\r\n\r\nThe Monarchists who derive benefit from their attachment to the\r\nreigning monarch deceive themselves as to their true feelings. They\r\nare Monarchists because they consider that form of government the most\r\nsatisfactory one. The Republicans, who apparently glorify the majesty\r\nof the people, really mean themselves. But in the long run a people\r\nwill always recognise that form of government which soonest can give\r\nit order, work, prosperity and contentment. In ninety-nine per cent.\r\nof the population the patriotism and enthusiasm for one or other form\r\nof government is nothing but a matter of material considerations. They\r\nprefer a good king to a bad republic, and vice versa; the form of\r\ngovernment is the means to the end, but the end is the contentment of\r\nthe people governed. Nor has the liberty of those governed anything to\r\ndo with the form of government. Monarchical England is just as free as\r\nRepublican America, and the Bolshevists have demonstrated _ad oculus_\r\nto the whole world that the proletariat exercises the greatest\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nThe war that was lost swept away the monarchs, but the Republics will\r\nonly be maintained if they can convince the people that they are more\r\nsuccessful in satisfying the masses than the monarchs were, a proof\r\nwhich--it seems to me--the German-Austrian Republic, at any rate, has\r\nhitherto failed to give.\r\n\r\nThe conviction that these questionable statements not only are false\r\nbut also objectionable and criminal errors; that the Divine Will has\r\nplaced the monarch at his post and keeps him there--this conviction\r\nwas systematically imprinted in the German people, and formed an\r\nintegral part of the views attributed to the Emperor. All his\r\npretensions are based on this; they all breathe the same idea. Every\r\nindividual, however, is the product of his birth, his education and\r\nhis experience. In judging William II. it must be borne in mind that\r\nfrom his youth upwards he was deceived and shown a world which never\r\nexisted. All monarchs should be taught that their people do not love\r\nthem; that they are quite indifferent to them; that it is not love\r\nthat makes them follow them and look up to them, but merely curiosity;\r\nthat they do not acclaim them from enthusiasm, but for their own\r\namusement, and would as soon hiss at them as cheer them. The loyalty\r\nof subjects can never be depended on; it is not their intention to be\r\nloyal, but only contented; they only tolerate the monarchs as long as\r\nthey themselves are contented, or as long as they have not enough\r\nstrength to abolish them. That is the truth, a knowledge of which\r\nwould prevent monarchs from arriving at unavoidably false\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor William is an example of this. I do not think there is\r\nanother ruler who had better intentions than he had. He lived only for\r\nhis calling--as he viewed it. All his thoughts and longings were\r\ncentred round Germany. His relations, pleasures and amusements were\r\nall subservient to the one idea of making and keeping the German\r\npeople great and happy, and if good will were sufficient to achieve\r\ngreat things William II. would have achieved them. From the very\r\nbeginning he was misunderstood. He made statements and gestures\r\nintended not only to win his listeners but the whole world, which had\r\njust the contrary effect. But he never was conscious of the practical\r\neffect of his actions, because he was systematically misled, not only\r\nby those in his immediate presence, but by the entire German people.\r\nHow many millions, who to-day fling curses at him, could not bow low\r\nenough when he appeared on the horizon in all his splendour; how many\r\nfelt overjoyed if the Imperial glance fell on them!--and none of them\r\nrealise that they themselves are to blame for having shown the Emperor\r\na world which never existed, and driven him into a course which he\r\notherwise would never have taken. It certainly cannot be denied that\r\nthe whole nature of the Emperor was peculiarly susceptible to this\r\ncharacteristically German attitude, and that monarchs less talented,\r\nless keen, less ready, and above all, less impregnated with the idea\r\nof self-sufficiency, are not so exposed to the poison of popularity as\r\nhe was.\r\n\r\nI once had the opportunity of studying the Emperor William in a very\r\nimportant phase of his life. I met him at the house of a friend in the\r\ncelebrated days of November, 1908, when great demonstrations against\r\nthe Emperor occurred in the Reichstag, and when the then Imperial\r\nChancellor, Prince Bülow, exposed him. Although he did not allude to\r\nthe matter to us with whom he was not familiar, the powerful\r\nimpression made upon him by these events in Berlin was very obvious,\r\nand I felt that in William II. I saw a man who, for the first time in\r\nhis life, with horror-stricken eyes, looked upon the world as it\r\nreally was. He saw brutal reality in close proximity. For the first\r\ntime in his life, perhaps, he felt his position on his throne to be a\r\nlittle insecure. He forgot his lesson too quickly. Had the\r\noverwhelming impression which prevailed for several days been a\r\nlasting one it might perhaps have induced him to descend from the\r\nclouds to which his courtiers and his people had raised him, and once\r\nmore feel firm ground beneath his feet. On the other hand, had the\r\nGerman people often treated the German Emperor as they did then it\r\nmight have cured him.\r\n\r\nA remarkable incident which occurred on this occasion is\r\ncharacteristic of the way in which the Emperor was treated by many of\r\nthe gentlemen of his suite. I had opportunity, while waiting at a\r\nGerman station restaurant for the arrival of the next train, to watch\r\nand study the excitement of the population at the events in Berlin,\r\nwhich bore signs of a revolutionary character. The densely crowded\r\nrestaurant re-echoed with discussion and criticisms of the Emperor,\r\nwhen suddenly one of the men stood up on a table and delivered a fiery\r\nspeech against the head of the Government. With the impression of this\r\nscene fresh in my mind, I described it to the members of the Emperor's\r\nsuite, who were just as disagreeably affected by the episode, and it\r\nwas suggested that nothing should be said about it to the Emperor. One\r\nof them, however, protested most energetically and declared that, on\r\nthe contrary, every detail should be told to the Emperor, and, so far\r\nas I know, he himself probably undertook this disagreeable task. This\r\ncase is characteristic of the desire to keep all unpleasantness from\r\nthe Emperor and to spare him even the most well-founded criticisms; to\r\npraise and exalt him, but never to show that he was being blamed. This\r\nsystematic putting forward of the Emperor's divine attributes, which\r\nin reality was neither due to love of his personality nor any other\r\ndynastic cause, but to the purely egotistical wish not to get into\r\ndisfavour themselves or expose themselves to unpleasantness; this\r\nunwholesome state must in the long run act on mind and body as an\r\nenervating poison. I readily believe that the Emperor William,\r\nunaccustomed to so great an extent to all criticism, did not make it\r\neasy for those about him to be open and frank. It was, nevertheless,\r\ntrue that the enervating atmosphere by which he was surrounded was the\r\ncause of all the evil at his court. In his youth the Emperor William\r\ndid not always adhere strictly to the laws of the Constitution; he\r\nsubsequently cured himself of this failing and never acted\r\nindependently of his counsellors. At the time when I had official\r\ndealings with him he might have served as a model of constitutional\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nIn the case of so young and inexperienced a man as the Emperor Charles\r\nit was doubly necessary to uphold the principle of ministerial\r\nresponsibility to the fullest extent. As according to our Constitution\r\nthe Emperor is not responsible to the law, it was of the greatest\r\nimportance to carry out the principle that he could undertake no\r\nadministrative act without the cognisance and sanction of the\r\nresponsible Ministers, and the Emperor Francis Joseph adhered to this\r\nprinciple as though it were gospel.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Charles, though full of good intentions, was devoid of all\r\npolitical training and experience, and ought to have been brought up\r\nto understand the principles of the Constitution. This, however, had\r\nnever been taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nAfter my resignation in April, 1918, a deputation from the\r\nConstitutional and Central Party in the Herrenhaus waited on the Prime\r\nMinister, Dr. von Seidler, and pointed out the importance of a\r\nseverely constitutional régime, whereupon Dr. von Seidler declared\r\nthat he took upon himself the full responsibility of the \"letter\r\nincident.\"\r\n\r\nThis was quite preposterous. Dr. von Seidler could not be responsible\r\nfor events that had occurred a year before--at a time when he was not\r\nMinister--apart from its being an established fact that during his\r\ntenure of office he was not aware of what had happened, and not until\r\nafter my resignation did he learn the Imperial views on the situation.\r\nHe might just as well have accepted responsibility for the Seven Years\r\nWar or for the battle of Königgrätz.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 and '18, when I had certain official dealings with the Emperor\r\nWilliam, his horror of an unpleasant discussion was so great that it\r\nwas a matter of extreme difficulty to impart the necessary information\r\nto him. I recollect how once, at the cost of the consideration due to\r\nan Emperor, I was compelled to extract a direct statement from him. I\r\nwas with the Emperor Charles on the Eastern front, but left him at\r\nLemberg and, joining the Emperor William in his train, travelled with\r\nhim for a couple of hours. I had certain things to submit to him, none\r\nof which was of an unpleasant nature. I do not know why it was, but it\r\nwas obvious that the Emperor was expecting to hear some disagreeable\r\nstatements, and offered a passive resistance to the request for a\r\nprivate interview. He invited me to breakfast with him in his\r\ndining-car, where he sat in the company of ten other gentlemen, and\r\nthere was no possibility of beginning the desired conversation.\r\nBreakfast had been over some time, but the Emperor made no sign of\r\nmoving. I was several times obliged to request him to grant me a\r\nprivate interview before he rose from the table, and even then he took\r\nwith him an official from the Foreign Ministry to be present at our\r\nconversation as though to have some protection against anticipated\r\ntroubles. The Emperor William was never rude to strangers, though he\r\noften was so to his own people.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Emperor Charles, the situation was very different.\r\nHe was never anything but friendly; in fact I never saw him angry or\r\nvexed. There was no need for any special courage in making an\r\nunpleasant statement to him, as there was no danger of receiving a\r\nviolent answer or any other disagreeable consequences. And yet the\r\ndesire to believe only what was agreeable and to put from him anything\r\ndisagreeable was very strong in the Emperor Charles, and neither\r\ncriticism nor blame made any lasting impression on him. But in his\r\ncase, too, the atmosphere that surrounded him rendered it impossible\r\nto convince him of the brutal realities prevailing. On one occasion,\r\nwhen I returned from the front, I had a long conversation with him. I\r\nreproached him for some act of administration and asserted that not\r\nonly on me but on the whole Monarchy his action had made a most\r\nunfavourable impression. I told him in the course of the conversation\r\nthat he must remember how, when he came to the throne, the whole\r\nMonarchy had looked to him with great hopes, but that now he had\r\nalready lost 80 per cent. of his popularity. The interview ended\r\nwithout incident; the Emperor preserved, as usual, a friendly\r\ndemeanour, though my remarks must have affected him unpleasantly. Some\r\nhours later we passed through a town where not only the station but\r\nall buildings were black with people, standing even on the roofs,\r\nwaving handkerchiefs and loudly welcoming the Imperial train as it\r\npassed through. The same scenes were repeated again and again at other\r\nstations that we passed. The Emperor turned to me with a smile and a\r\nlook that showed me he was firmly convinced everything I had told him\r\nas to his dwindling popularity was false, the living picture before\r\nour eyes proving the contrary.\r\n\r\nWhen I was at Brest-Litovsk disturbances began in Vienna owing to the\r\nlack of food. In view of the whole situation, we did not know what\r\ndimensions they would assume, and it was considered that they were of\r\na threatening nature. When discussing the situation with the Emperor,\r\nhe remarked with a smile: \"The only person who has nothing to fear is\r\nmyself. If it happens again I will go out among the people and you\r\nwill see the welcome they will give me.\" Some few months later this\r\nsame Emperor disappeared silently and utterly out of the picture, and\r\namong all the thousands who had acclaimed him, and whose enthusiasm he\r\nhad thought genuine, not one would have lifted a little finger on his\r\nbehalf. I have witnessed scenes of enthusiasm which would have\r\ndeceived the boldest and most sceptical judge of the populace. I saw\r\nthe Emperor and the Empress surrounded by weeping women and men\r\nwellnigh smothered in a rain of flowers; I saw the people on their\r\nknees with uplifted hands, as though worshipping a Divinity; and I\r\ncannot wonder that the objects of such enthusiastic homage should have\r\ntaken dross for pure gold in the firm belief that they _personally_\r\nwere beloved of the people, even as children love their own parents.\r\nIt is easy to understand that after such scenes the Emperor and\r\nEmpress looked upon all the criticism of themselves and the discontent\r\namong the people as idle talk, and held firmly to the belief that\r\ngrave disturbances might occur elsewhere but not in their own country.\r\nAny simple citizen who has held for a time a higher position\r\nexperiences something of the kind, though in a lesser degree. I could\r\nmention names of many men who could not bow low enough as long as I\r\nwas in power, but after my resignation would cross the street to avoid\r\na bow, fearing that Imperial disfavour might react on them. But years\r\nbefore his rise the simple citizen has an opportunity of learning to\r\nknow the world, and, if he be a man of normal temperament, will feel\r\nthe same contempt for the servility shown during his time in office as\r\nfor the behaviour he meets with afterwards. Monarchs are without\r\ntraining in the school of life, and therefore usually make a false\r\nestimate of the psychology of humanity. But in this tragi-comedy it is\r\nthey who are led astray.\r\n\r\nIt is less easy, however, to understand that responsible advisers, who\r\nare bound to distinguish between reality and comedy, should also allow\r\nthemselves to be deceived and draw false political conclusions from\r\nsuch events. In 1918 the Emperor, accompanied by the Prime Minister,\r\nDr. von Seidler, went to the South Slav provinces to investigate\r\nmatters there. He found, of course, the same welcome there as\r\neverywhere, curiosity brought the people out to see him; pressure from\r\nthe authorities on the one hand, and hope of Imperial favours on the\r\nother, brought about ovations similar to those in the undoubtedly\r\ndynastic provinces. And not only the Emperor, but von Seidler returned\r\nin triumph, firmly convinced that everything stated in Parliament or\r\nwritten in the papers respecting the separatist tendencies of the\r\nSouth Slavs was pure invention and nonsense, and that they would never\r\nagree to a separation from the Habsburg Empire.\r\n\r\nThe objects of these demonstrations of enthusiasm and dynastic\r\nloyalty were deceived by them, but I repeat that those who were to\r\nblame were not the monarchs, but those who were the instigators and\r\norganisers of such scenes and who omitted to enlighten the monarchs on\r\nthe matter. But any such explanation could only be effectual if all\r\nthose in the immediate neighbourhood of the ruler concurred in a\r\nsimilar reckless disregard of truth. For if one out of ten people\r\ndeclares such scenes to be not genuine and the others contradict him\r\nand assert that the demonstrations of the \"love of the people\" are\r\noverwhelming, the monarch will always be more inclined to listen to\r\nthe many pleasant rather than to the few unpleasant counsels.\r\nWillingly or unwillingly, all monarchs try, very humanly, to resist\r\nawakening out of this hypnotic complacency. Naturally, there were men\r\nin the entourage of the German Emperor whose pride kept them from\r\nmaking too large an offering to the throne, but as a rule their\r\nsuffering in the Byzantine atmosphere of Germany was greater than\r\ntheir enjoyment. I always considered that the greatest sycophants were\r\nnot those living at court, but generals, admirals, professors,\r\nofficials, representatives of the people and men of learning--people\r\nwhom the Emperor met infrequently.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the war, however, the leading men around the\r\nKaiser were not Byzantine--Ludendorff certainly was not. His whole\r\nnature was devoid of Byzantine characteristics. Energetic, brave, sure\r\nof himself and his aims, he brooked no opposition and was not\r\nfastidious in his choice of language. To him it was a matter of\r\nindifference whether he was confronted by his Emperor or anyone\r\nelse--he spoke unrestrainedly to all who came in his way.\r\n\r\nThe numerous burgomasters, town councillors, professors of the\r\nuniversities, deputies--in short, men of the people and of\r\nscience--had for years prostrated themselves before the Emperor\r\nWilliam; a word from him intoxicated them--but how many of them are\r\nthere now amongst those who condemn the former régime with its abuses\r\nand, above all, the Emperor himself!\r\n\r\nHis political advisers experienced great difficulty in their business\r\ndealings with the Emperor William during the war, as he was generally\r\nat Headquarters and seldom in Berlin. The Emperor Charles's absence\r\nfrom Vienna was also at times most inconvenient.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1917, for instance, he was at Reichenau, which\r\nnecessitated a two hours' motor drive; I had to go there twice or\r\nthree times a week, thus losing five or six hours which had to be made\r\ngood by prolonged night work. On no account would he come to Vienna,\r\nin spite of the efforts made by his advisers to persuade him to do so.\r\nFrom certain remarks the Emperor let fall I gathered that the reason\r\nof this persistent refusal was anxiety concerning the health of the\r\nchildren. He himself was so entirely free from pretensions that it\r\ncannot have been a question of his own comfort that prevented his\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's desire to restore the Archduke Joseph Ferdinand to a\r\npost of command was for me a source of much unpleasantness. The\r\nArchduke is said to have been to blame for the Luck failure. I cannot\r\njudge whether wrongly--as the Emperor maintained--or rightly; but the\r\nfact remains that the public no longer had confidence in him. Quite\r\naccidentally I learnt that his reinstatement was imminent. As a matter\r\nof fact, this purely military proceeding in no way concerned me, but I\r\nhad to reckon with the feeling of the populace, who were in no mood\r\nfor further burdens, and also with the fact that, since Conrad had\r\ngone, none of those in the Emperor's entourage showed the slightest\r\ndisposition to acquaint him with the truth. The only general who, to\r\nmy personal knowledge, was in the habit of speaking frankly to the\r\nEmperor, was Alvis Schonburg, and he was at this time somewhere on the\r\nItalian front. I therefore told the Emperor that the reinstatement was\r\nan impossibility, giving as my reason the fact that the Archduke had\r\nforfeited the confidence of the country, and that no mother could be\r\nexpected to give up her son to serve under a general whom everyone\r\nheld to be guilty of the Luck catastrophe. The Emperor insisted that\r\nthis view was unjust, and that the Archduke was not culpable. I\r\nreplied that, even so, the Archduke would have to submit. Everyone had\r\nlost confidence in him, and the most strenuous exertions of the people\r\ncould neither be expected nor obtained if the command were handed to\r\ngenerals who were unanimously regarded as unworthy of the confidence\r\nplaced in them.\r\n\r\nMy efforts were vain.\r\n\r\nI then adopted another course. I sent an official from the Department\r\nof Foreign Affairs to the Archduke with the request that he would\r\nresign voluntarily.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Joseph Ferdinand took both a loyal and a\r\ndignified attitude, as he himself notified the Emperor that he would\r\nrelinquish his command at the front. A short correspondence followed\r\nbetween the Archduke and myself, which on his side was couched in an\r\nindignant and not over-polite tone; this, however, I did not take\r\namiss, as my interference had been successful in preventing his\r\nresuming the command.\r\n\r\nHis subsequent appointment as Chief of the Air Force was made without\r\nmy knowledge; but this was of no importance when compared to the\r\nprevious plans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Byzantine atmosphere of Berlin took a more\r\nobjectionable form than ever was the case in Vienna. The very idea of\r\nhigh dignitaries kissing the Emperor's hand, as they did in Berlin,\r\nwould have been impossible in Vienna. I never heard of anyone, even\r\namong the keenest sycophants, who demeaned themselves by such an act,\r\nwhich in Berlin, as I know from personal observation, was an everyday\r\noccurrence. For instance, after a trip on the _Meteor_, during the\r\n\"Kiel Week,\" the Emperor presented two German officials with\r\nscarf-pins as a souvenir. He handed the pins to them himself, and\r\ngreat was my surprise to see them kiss his hand as they thanked him.\r\n\r\nMany foreigners were in the habit of coming for the Kiel Week:\r\nAmericans, French, and English. The Emperor paid them much attention,\r\nand they nearly always succumbed to the charm of his personality.\r\nApparently William II. had a preference for America; on the subject\r\nof his feelings regarding England it is difficult to express an\r\nopinion. My impression always was that the Emperor resented the scant\r\nsympathy shown him in England; he strove to make himself beloved, and\r\nthe failure of his efforts caused him a certain annoyance. He was\r\nquite aware that the extent of his popularity in England would\r\nproportionately influence Anglo-German relations, and his desire to\r\nfind favour in England did not proceed from personal vanity, but from\r\npolitical interests.\r\n\r\nKing Edward was known to be one of the best judges of men in all\r\nEurope, and his interest in foreign policy was predominant. He would\r\nhave been an ideal ambassador. There was never a very good\r\nunderstanding between uncle and nephew. When the nephew was already\r\nEmperor, and his much older uncle still only a prince, the difference\r\nin their positions was characterised by the satirical Kiderlen-Waechter\r\nin the following terms: \"The Prince of Wales cannot forgive his nephew,\r\neighteen years younger than himself, for making a more brilliant career\r\nthan has fallen to his lot.\"\r\n\r\nPersonal sympathy and personal differences in leading circles are\r\ncapable of influencing the world's history. Politics are, and always\r\nwill be, made by men, and individual personal relations will always\r\nplay a certain part in their development. Who can to-day assert that\r\nthe course of the world might not have been different had the monarchs\r\nof Germany and England been more alike in temperament? The encircling\r\npolicy of King Edward was not brought into play until he was persuaded\r\nthat an understanding with the Emperor William was impossible.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty the Emperor experienced in adapting himself to the\r\nideas and views of others increased as the years went by, a state of\r\nthings largely the fault of his entourage.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere in which he lived would have killed the hardiest plant.\r\nWhatever the Emperor said or did, whether it was right or wrong, was\r\nreceived with enthusiastic praise and admiration. Dozens of people\r\nwere always at hand to laud him to the skies.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a book was published during the war entitled, \"Der\r\nKaiser im Felde,\" by Dr. Bogdan Kriegen. The Emperor presented me with\r\na copy when at Kreuznach in May, 1917, and wrote a suitable\r\ninscription inside. The book contained an accurate account of all the\r\nEmperor had done during the campaign--but it was entirely superficial\r\nmatter; where he had driven to, where breakfasted, with whom he had\r\nspoken, the jokes he had made, what clothes he wore, the shining light\r\nin his eyes, etc., etc. It also recorded his speeches to the troops;\r\ndull and uninteresting words that he addressed to individual soldiers,\r\nand much more in the same strain. The whole book is impregnated and\r\npermeated with boundless admiration and unqualified praise. The\r\nEmperor gave me the book when I was leaving, and I read it through\r\nwhen in the train.\r\n\r\nI was asked a few weeks later by a German officer what I thought of\r\nthe book. I replied that it was trash and could only harm the Emperor,\r\nand that it should be confiscated. The officer shared my opinion, but\r\nsaid that the Emperor had been assured on all sides that the book was\r\na splendid work and helped to fire the spirit of the army; he\r\ntherefore had it widely distributed. Once, at a dinner at Count\r\nHertling's, I called his attention to the book and advised him to\r\nsuppress it, as such a production could only be detrimental to the\r\nEmperor. The old gentleman was very angry, and declared: \"That was\r\nalways the way; people who wished to ingratiate themselves with the\r\nEmperor invariably presented him with such things.\" A professor from\r\nthe University had warmly praised the book to me, but he went on to\r\nsay: \"The Emperor had, of course, no time to read such stuff and\r\nrepudiate the flattery; neither had he himself found time to read it,\r\nbut would make a point of doing so now.\" I did not know much of that\r\nprofessor, but he certainly was not in frequent touch with the\r\nEmperor, nor was the author of the book.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, as in many others, I concluded that many of the\r\nmembers of the Emperor's suite were far from being in sympathy with\r\nsuch tendencies. The court was not the principal offender, but was\r\ncarried away by the current of sycophancy.\r\n\r\nDuring my period of office Prince Hohenlohe, the ambassador, had\r\nnumerous interviews with the Emperor William, and invariably spoke\r\nmost freely and openly to him, and yet always was on the best footing\r\nwith him. This was, of course, an easier matter for a foreign\r\nambassador than for a German of the Empire, but it proves that the\r\nEmperor accepted it when done in proper form.\r\n\r\nIn his own country the Emperor was either glorified and exalted to the\r\nskies or else scorned and scoffed at by a minority of the Press in a\r\nprejudicial manner. In the latter case it bore so evidently the stamp\r\nof personal enmity that it was discredited _a priori_. Had there\r\nexisted earnest papers and organs that would, in dignified fashion,\r\nhave discussed and criticised the Emperor's faults and failings, while\r\nrecognising all his great and good qualities, it would have been much\r\nmore satisfactory. Had there been more books written about him showing\r\nthat the real man is quite different from what he is made to appear to\r\nbe; that he is full of the best intentions and inspired with a\r\npassionate love of Germany; that in a true and profound religious\r\nsense he often wrestles with himself and his God, asking himself if he\r\nhas chosen the right way; that his love for his people is far more\r\ngenuine than that of many of the Germans for him; that he never has\r\ndeceived them, but was constantly deceived by them--such literature\r\nwould have been more efficacious and, above all, nearer the truth.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the German Emperor's gifts and talents were above the\r\naverage, and had he been an ordinary mortal would certainly have\r\nbecome a very competent officer, architect, engineer, or politician.\r\nBut for lack of criticism he lost his bearings, and it caused his\r\nundoing. According to all the records the Emperor William I. was of a\r\nvery different nature. Yet Bismarck often had a hard task in dealing\r\nwith him, though Bismarck's loyalty and subservience to the dynastic\r\nidea made him curb his characteristically ruthless frankness. But\r\nWilliam I. was a self-made man. When he came to the throne and began\r\nto govern his kingdom was tottering. Assisted by the very capable men\r\nhe was able to find and to retain, he upheld it, and by means of\r\nKöniggrätz and Sedan created the great German Empire. William II. came\r\nto the throne when Germany had reached the zenith of her power. He had\r\nnot acquired what he possessed by his own work, as his grandfather\r\nhad; it came to him without any effort on his part; a fact which had a\r\ngreat and far from favourable influence on his whole mental\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor William was an entertaining and interesting _causeur_. One\r\ncould listen to him for hours without wearying. Emperors usually enjoy\r\nthe privilege of finding a ready audience, but even had the Emperor\r\nWilliam been an ordinary citizen he would always have spoken to a\r\ncrowded house. He could discourse on art, science, politics, music,\r\nreligion, and astronomy in a most animated manner. What he said was\r\nnot always quite correct; indeed, he often lost himself in very\r\nquestionable conclusions; but the fault of boring others, the greatest\r\nof social faults, was not his.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Emperor was always very powerful in speech and gesture,\r\nstill, during the war he was much less independent in his actions than\r\nis usually assumed, and, in my opinion, this is one of the principal\r\nreasons that gave rise to a mistaken understanding of all the\r\nEmperor's administrative activities. Far more than the public imagine\r\nhe was a driven rather than a driving factor, and if the Entente\r\nto-day claims the right of being prosecutor and judge combined in\r\norder to bring the Emperor to his trial, it is unjust and an error,\r\nas, both preceding and during the war, the Emperor William never\r\nplayed the part attributed to him by the Entente.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate man has gone through much, and more is, perhaps, in\r\nstore for him. He has been carried too high and cannot escape a\r\nterrible fall. Fate seems to have chosen him to expiate a sin which,\r\nif it exists at all, is not so much his as that of his country and his\r\ntimes. The Byzantine atmosphere in Germany was the ruin of Emperor\r\nWilliam; it enveloped him and clung to him like a creeper to a tree; a\r\nvast crowd of flatterers and fortune-seekers who deserted him in the\r\nhour of trial. The Emperor William was merely a particularly\r\ndistinctive representative of his class. All modern monarchs suffer\r\nfrom the disease; but it was more highly developed in the Emperor\r\nWilliam and, therefore, more obvious than in others. Accustomed from\r\nhis youth to the subtle poison of flattery, at the head of one of the\r\ngreatest and mightiest states in the world, possessing almost\r\nunlimited power, he succumbed to the fatal lot that awaits men who\r\nfeel the earth recede from under their feet, and who begin to believe\r\nin their Divine semblance.\r\n\r\nHe is expiating a crime which was not of his making. He can take with\r\nhim in his solitude the consolation that his only desire was for the\r\nbest. And notwithstanding all that is said and written about William\r\nII. in these days, the beautiful words of the text may be applied to\r\nhim: \"Peace on earth to men of goodwill.\"[4]\r\n\r\nIn his retirement from the world his good conscience will be his most\r\nprecious possession.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the evening of his days William II. will acknowledge that\r\nthere is neither happiness nor unhappiness in mortal life, but only a\r\ndifference in the strength to endure one's fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWar was never in William II.'s programme. I am not able to say where,\r\nin his own mind, he had fixed the limits he proposed for Germany and\r\nwhether it was justifiable to reproach him with having gone too far in\r\nhis ambition for the Fatherland. He certainly never thought of a\r\n_unified_ German world dominion; he was not so simple as to think he\r\ncould achieve that without a war, but his plan undoubtedly was\r\npermanently to establish Germany among the first Powers of the world.\r\nI know for certain that the Emperor's ideal plan was to come to a\r\nworld agreement with England and, in a certain sense, to divide the\r\nworld with her. In this projected division of the world a certain\r\npart was to be played by Russia and Japan, but he paid little heed to\r\nthe other states, especially to France, convinced that they were all\r\nnations of declining power. To maintain that William intentionally\r\nprepared and started this war is in direct opposition to his long\r\nyears of peaceful government. Helfferich, in his work \"Die\r\nVorgeschichte des Weltkrieges,\" speaks of the Emperor's attitude\r\nduring the Balkan troubles, and says:\r\n\r\n  A telegram sent by William II. at that time to the Imperial\r\n  Chancellor explains the attitude of the German Emperor in this\r\n  critical position for German politics, being similar to the\r\n  situation in July, 1914. The contents of the telegram are as\r\n  follows: \"The Alliance with Austria-Hungary compels us to take\r\n  action should Austria-Hungary be attacked by Russia. In that case\r\n  France would also be involved, and in those circumstances England\r\n  would not long remain quiescent. The present prevailing questions\r\n  of dispute cannot be compared with that danger. It cannot be the\r\n  intention of the Alliance that we, the life interest of our ally\r\n  not being endangered, should enter upon a life-and-death conflict\r\n  for a caprice of that ally. Should it become evident that the\r\n  other side intend to attack, the danger must then be faced.\"\r\n\r\n  This calm and decided standpoint which alone could maintain peace\r\n  was also the German policy observed in further developments. It\r\n  was upheld when confronted by strong pressure from Russia, as also\r\n  against other tendencies and a certain transitory ill-feeling in\r\n  Vienna.\r\n\r\nWhether such feeling did exist in Vienna or not I cannot say, but I\r\nbelieve the account is correct.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that all the warlike speeches flung into\r\nthe world by the Emperor were due to a mistaken understanding of their\r\neffect. I allow that the Emperor wished to create a sensation, even to\r\nterrify people, but he also wished to act on the principle of _si vis\r\npacem para bellum_, and by emphasising the military power of Germany\r\nhe endeavoured to prevent the many envious enemies of his Empire from\r\ndeclaring war on him.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that this attitude was often both unfortunate and\r\nmistaken, and that it contributed to the outbreak of war; but it is\r\nasserted that the Emperor was devoid of the _dolus_ of making war;\r\nthat he said and did things by which he unintentionally stirred up\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nHad there been men in Germany ready to point out to the Emperor the\r\ninjurious effects of his behaviour and to make him feel the growing\r\nmistrust of him throughout the world, had there been not one or two\r\nbut dozens of such men, it would assuredly have made an impression on\r\nthe Emperor. It is quite true that of all the inhabitants of the\r\nearth, the German is the one the least capable of adapting himself to\r\nthe mentality of other people, and, as a matter of fact, there were\r\nperhaps but few in the immediate entourage of the Emperor who\r\nrecognised the growing anxiety of the world. Perhaps many of those who\r\nso continuously extolled the Emperor were really honestly of opinion\r\nthat his behaviour was quite correct. It is, nevertheless, impossible\r\nnot to believe that among the many clever German politicians of the\r\nlast decade there were some who had a clear grasp of the situation,\r\nand the fact remains that, in order to spare the Emperor and\r\nthemselves, they had not the courage to be harsh with him and tell him\r\nthe truth to his face. These are not reproaches, but reminiscences\r\nwhich should not be superfluous at a time when the Emperor is to be\r\nmade the scapegoat of the whole world. Certainly, the Emperor, being\r\nsuch as he is, the experiment would not have passed off without there\r\nbeing opposition to encounter and overcome. The first among his\r\nsubjects to attempt the task of enlightening the Emperor would have\r\nbeen looked upon with the greatest surprise; hence no one would\r\nundertake it. Had there, however, been men who, regardless of\r\nthemselves, would have undertaken to do it, it would certainly have\r\nsucceeded, as not only was the Emperor full of good intentions, but he\r\nwas also impressionable, and consistent purposefulness on a basis of\r\nfearless honesty would have impressed him. Besides, the Emperor was a\r\nthoroughly kind and good man. It was a genuine pleasure for him to be\r\nable to do good, neither did he hate his enemies. In the summer of\r\n1917 he spoke to me about the fate of the deposed Tsar and of his\r\ndesire to help him and subsequently bring him to Germany, a desire due\r\nnot to dynastic but to human motives. He stated repeatedly that he had\r\nno desire for revenge, but \"only to succour his fallen adversary.\"\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that the Emperor clearly saw the clouds grow blacker\r\nand blacker on the political horizon, but he was sincerely and\r\nhonestly persuaded that it was not through any fault of his that they\r\nhad accumulated, that they were caused by envy and jealousy, and that\r\nthere was no other way of keeping the threatening war danger at bay\r\nthan by an ostentatious attitude of strength and fearlessness.\r\n\"Germany's power and might must daily be proclaimed to the world, for\r\nas long as they fear us they will do us no harm\"--that was the\r\ndoctrine that obtained on the Spree. And the echo came back from the\r\nworld, \"This continued boasting of German power and the perpetual\r\nattempts at intimidation prove that Germany seeks to tyrannise the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nWhen war broke out the Emperor was firmly convinced that a war of\r\ndefence was being forced on him, which conviction was shared by the\r\ngreat majority of the German people. I draw these conclusions solely\r\nfrom my knowledge of the Emperor and his entourage and from other\r\ninformation obtained indirectly. As I have already mentioned, I had\r\nnot had the slightest connection with Berlin for some years previous\r\nto the war, and certainly not for two years after it broke out.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1917, when I met the Emperor again in my capacity as\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, I thought he had aged, but was still\r\nfull of his former vivacity. In spite of marked demonstrations of the\r\ncertainty of victory, I believe that William II. even then had begun\r\nto doubt the result of the war and that his earnest wish was to bring\r\nit to an honourable end. When in the course of one of our first\r\nconversations I urged him to spare no sacrifice to bring it to an end,\r\nhe interrupted me, exclaiming: \"What would you have me do? Nobody\r\nlongs for peace more intensely than I do. But every day we are told\r\nthat the others will not hear a word about peace until Germany has\r\nbeen crushed.\" It was a true answer, for all statements made by\r\nEngland culminated in the one sentence _Germanium esse delendam_. I\r\nendeavoured, nevertheless, to induce the Emperor to consent to the\r\nsacrifice of Alsace-Lorraine, persuaded that if France had obtained\r\nall that she looked upon in the light of a national idea she would not\r\nbe inclined to continue the war. I think that, had the Emperor been\r\npositively certain that it would have ended the war, and had he not\r\nbeen afraid that so distressing an offer would have been considered\r\nunbearable by Germany, he would personally have agreed to it. But he\r\nwas dominated by the fear that a peace involving such a loss, and\r\nafter the sacrifices already made, would have driven the German people\r\nto despair. Whether he was justified in this fear or not cannot now be\r\nconfirmed. In 1917, and 1918 as well, the belief in a victorious end\r\nwas still so strong in Germany that it is at least doubtful whether\r\nthe German people would have consented to give up Alsace-Lorraine. All\r\nthe parties in the Reichstag were opposed to it, including the Social\r\nDemocrats.\r\n\r\nA German official of high standing said to me in the spring of 1918:\r\n\"I had two sons; one of them fell on the field of battle, but I would\r\nrather part with the other one too than give up Alsace-Lorraine,\" and\r\nmany were of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the year and a half when I had frequent opportunities\r\nof meeting the Emperor, his frame of mind had naturally gone through\r\nmany different phases. Following on any great military success, and\r\nafter the collapse of Russia and Roumania, his generals were always\r\nable to enrol him on their programme of victory, and it is quite a\r\nmistake to imagine that William II. unceasingly clung to the idea of\r\n\"Peace above all.\" He wavered, was sometimes pessimistic, sometimes\r\noptimistic, and his peace aims changed in like manner. Humanly\r\nspeaking, it is very comprehensible that the varying situation in the\r\ntheatre of war must have influenced the individual mind, and everyone\r\nin Europe experienced such fluctuations.\r\n\r\nEarly in September, 1917, he wrote to the Emperor Charles on the\r\nsubject of an impending attack on the Italian front, and in this\r\nletter was the following passage: \"I trust that the possibility of a\r\ncommon offensive of our allied armies will raise the spirits of your\r\nForeign Minister. In my opinion, and in view of the general situation,\r\nthere is no reason to be anything but confident.\" Other letters and\r\nstatements prove the Emperor's fluctuating frame of mind. He, as well\r\nas the diplomats in the Wilhelmstrasse, made use, with regard to the\r\n\"war-weary Austria-Hungary,\" of such tactics as demonstrated a\r\npronounced certainty of victory in order to strengthen our powers of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Archduke Friedrich deserves the greatest praise for having kept up\r\nthe friendly relations between Vienna and Berlin. It was not always\r\neasy to settle the delicate questions relating to the conduct of the\r\nwar without giving offence. The honest and straightforward nature of\r\nthe Archduke and his ever friendly and modest behaviour saved many a\r\ndifficult situation.\r\n\r\nAfter our collapse and overthrow, and when the Imperial family could\r\nbe abused with impunity, certain newspapers took a delight in covering\r\nthe Archduke Friedrich with contumely. It left him quite indifferent.\r\nThe Prince is a distinguished character, of faultless integrity and\r\nalways ready to put down abuse. He prevented many disasters, and it\r\nwas not his fault if he did not succeed every time.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the Crown Prince Wilhelm again after several years, in the\r\nsummer of 1917, I found him very tired of war and most anxious for\r\npeace. I had gone to the French front on purpose to meet him and to\r\ntry if it were possible through him to exercise some conciliatory\r\npressure, above all, on the military leaders. A long conversation that\r\nI had with him showed me very clearly that he--if he had ever been of\r\nwarlike nature--was then a pronounced pacifist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from my Diary._\r\n\r\n\"On the Western front, 1917. We drove to the Camp des Romains, but in\r\ndetachments in order not to attract the attention of the enemy\r\nartillery to our cars, for in some places the road was visible to the\r\nenemy. I drove together with Bethmann. When discussing the military\r\nleaders, he remarked: 'The generals will probably throw hand grenades\r\nat me when they see me.'\r\n\r\n\"An enemy flier cruised high up in the clouds over our heads. He\r\ncircled around, paying little heed to the shrapnel bursting on all\r\nsides. The firing ceased, and the human bird soared into\r\nunapproachable heights. The artillery fire a long way off sounded like\r\ndistant thunder.\r\n\r\n\"The French lines are not more than a couple of hundred metres distant\r\nfrom the camp. A shot fell here and there and a shell was heard to\r\nwhistle; otherwise all was quiet. It was still early. The firing\r\nusually begins at ten and ceases at noon--interval for lunch--and\r\nbegins again in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"Poincaré's villa is visible on the horizon in the green landscape. A\r\ngun has been brought to bear on the house--they mean to destroy it\r\nbefore leaving--they call this the extreme unction.\r\n\r\n\"The daily artillery duel began on our return drive, and kept up an\r\nincessant roar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_St. Mihiel._\r\n\r\n\"We stopped at St. Mihiel, where many French people still remain. They\r\nwere detained as hostages to prevent the town from being fired at.\r\nPeople were standing about in the streets watching the cars go by.\r\n\r\n\"I spoke to an old woman, who sat by herself on her house-steps. She\r\nsaid: 'This disaster can never be made good, and it cannot well be\r\nworse than it is now. It is quite the same to me what happens. I do\r\nnot belong here; my only son has been killed and my house is burnt.\r\nNothing is left me but my hatred of the Germans, and I bequeath that\r\nto France.' And she gazed past me into vacancy. She spoke quite\r\nwithout passion, but was terribly sad.\r\n\r\n\"This terrible hatred! Generations will go to their graves before the\r\nflood of hatred is abated. Would a settlement, a peace of\r\nunderstanding, be possible with this spirit of the nations? Will it\r\nnot end by one of them being felled to earth and annihilated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_St. Privat._\r\n\r\n\"We passed through St. Privat on our way to Metz. Monuments that tell\r\nthe tale of 1870 stand along the road. Everywhere the soil is\r\nhistoric, soaked in blood. Every spot, every stone, is reminiscent of\r\npast great times. It was here that the seed was sown that brought\r\nforth the plan of revenge that is being fought for now.\r\n\r\n\"Bethmann seemed to divine my thoughts. 'Yes,' he said, 'that\r\nsacrifice would be easier for Germany to bear than to part with\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, which would close one of the most brilliant episodes\r\nin her history.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Sedan._\r\n\r\n\"On the way to the Crown Prince's quarters. There stands the little\r\nhouse where the historic meeting between Napoleon III. and Bismarck\r\ntook place. The woman who lived there at the time died only a few\r\nweeks ago. For the second time she saw the Germans arrive, bringing a\r\nMoltke but no Bismarck with them, a detail, however, that cannot\r\ndeeply have interested the old lady.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_With the Crown Prince._\r\n\r\n\"A pretty little house outside the town. I found a message from the\r\nCrown Prince asking me to proceed there immediately, where I had\r\nalmost an hour's private conversation with him before supper.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know if the Crown Prince ever was of a warlike disposition,\r\nas people say, but he is so no longer. He longs for peace, but does\r\nnot know how to secure it. He spoke very quietly and sensibly. He was\r\nalso in favour of territorial sacrifices, but seemed to think that\r\nGermany would not allow it. The great difficulty lay in the contrast\r\nbetween the actual military situation, the confident expectations of\r\nthe generals, and the fears entertained by the military laymen.\r\nBesides, it is not only Alsace-Lorraine. The suppression of German\r\nmilitarism spoken of in London means the one-sided disarmament of\r\nGermany. Can an army far advanced on enemy soil whose generals are\r\nconfident of final victory, can a people still undefeated tolerate\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n\"I advised the Crown Prince to speak to his father on the question of\r\nabdication, in which he fully agreed. I then invited him to come to\r\nVienna on behalf of the Emperor, which he promised to do as soon as he\r\ncould get leave.\"\r\n\r\nOn my return the Emperor wrote him a letter, drawn up by me, which\r\ncontained the following passage:\r\n\r\n  My Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me of the interesting\r\n  conversation he had the honour to have with you, and it has been a\r\n  great pleasure to me to hear all your statements, which so exactly\r\n  reflect my own views of the situation. Notwithstanding the\r\n  superhuman exertions of our troops, the situation throughout the\r\n  country demands that a stop be put to the war before winter, in\r\n  Germany as well as here. Turkey will not be with us much longer,\r\n  and with her we shall also lose Bulgaria; we two will then be\r\n  alone, and next spring will bring America and a still stronger\r\n  Entente. From other sources there are distinct signs that we could\r\n  win over France if Germany could make up her mind to certain\r\n  territorial sacrifices in Alsace-Lorraine. With France secured to\r\n  us we are the conquerors, and Germany will obtain elsewhere ample\r\n  compensation. But I cannot allow Germany to be the only one to\r\n  make a sacrifice. I too will take the lion's share of sacrifice,\r\n  and have informed His Majesty your father that under the above\r\n  conditions I am prepared not only to dispense with the whole of\r\n  Poland, but to cede Galicia to her and to assist in combining that\r\n  state with Germany, who would thus acquire a state in the East\r\n  while yielding up a portion of her soil in the West. In 1915, at\r\n  the request of Germany and in the interests of our Alliance, we\r\n  offered the Trentino to faithless Italy without asking for\r\n  compensation in order to avert war. Germany is now in a similar\r\n  situation, though with far better prospects. You, as heir to the\r\n  German Imperial crown, are privileged to have a say in the matter,\r\n  and I know that His Majesty your father entirely shares this view\r\n  respecting your co-operation. I beg of you, therefore, in this\r\n  decisive hour for Germany and Austria-Hungary, to consider the\r\n  whole situation and to unite your efforts with mine to bring the\r\n  war to a rapid and honourable end. If Germany persists in her\r\n  standpoint of refusal and thus wrecks the hope of a possible peace\r\n  the situation in Austria-Hungary will become extremely critical.\r\n\r\n  I should be very glad to have a talk with you as soon as possible,\r\n  and your promise conveyed through Count Czernin soon to pay us a\r\n  visit gives me the greatest pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince's answer was very friendly and full of anxiety to\r\nhelp, though it was also obvious that the German military leaders had\r\nsucceeded in nipping his efforts in the bud. When I met Ludendorff\r\nsome time afterwards in Berlin this was fully confirmed by the words\r\nhe flung at me: \"What have you been doing to our Crown Prince? He had\r\nturned very slack, but we have stiffened him up again.\"\r\n\r\nThe game remained the same. The last war period in Germany was\r\ncontrolled by one will only, and that was Ludendorff's. His thoughts\r\nwere centred on fighting, his soul on victory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] This is a literal rendering of the famous text from the German.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nROUMANIA\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nMy appointment as ambassador to Bucharest in the autumn of 1913 came\r\nas a complete surprise to me, and was much against my wishes. The\r\ninitiative in the matter came from the Archduke Franz Ferdinand. I had\r\nnever had any doubt that sooner or later the Archduke would take part\r\nin politics, but it took me by surprise that he should do so in the\r\nEmperor Francis Joseph's lifetime.\r\n\r\nA great difference of opinion prevailed then in Vienna on the\r\nRoumanian question, a pro-Roumanian spirit fighting against an\r\nanti-Roumanian one. The head of the former party was the Archduke\r\nFranz, and with him, though in less marked degree, was Berchtold.\r\nTisza was the leader on the other side, and carried with him almost\r\nthe entire Hungarian Parliament. The pro-Roumanians wished Roumania to\r\nbe more closely linked to the Monarchy; the others, to replace that\r\nalliance by one with Bulgaria; but both were unanimous in seeking for\r\na clear knowledge of how matters stood with the alliance, and whether\r\nwe had a friend or a foe on the other side of the Carpathians. My\r\npredecessor, Karl Fürstenberg, had sent in a very clear and correct\r\nreport on the subject, but he shared the fate of so many ambassadors:\r\nhis word was not believed.\r\n\r\nThe actual task assigned to me was, first of all to find out whether\r\nthis alliance was of any practical value, and if I thought not to\r\nsuggest ways and means of justifying its existence.\r\n\r\nI must mention in this connection that my appointment as ambassador to\r\nBucharest had raised a perfect storm in the Hungarian Parliament. The\r\nreason for this widely spread indignation in Hungary at my selection\r\nfor the post was owing to a pamphlet I had written some years\r\npreviously, in which I certainly had attacked the Magyar policy\r\nsomewhat vehemently. I maintained the standpoint that a policy of\r\nsuppression of the nations was not tenable in the long run, and that\r\nno future was in store for Hungary unless she definitely abolished\r\nthat policy and allowed the nations equal rights. This pamphlet gave\r\nserious displeasure in Budapest, and representatives in the Hungarian\r\nParliament were afraid I should introduce that policy in Roumania,\r\nwhich, following the spirit of the pamphlet, was directed against the\r\nofficial policy of Vienna and Budapest. It was at this period that I\r\nmade Tisza's acquaintance. I had a long and very frank conversation\r\nwith him on the whole subject, and explained to him that I must uphold\r\nthe standpoint I put forward in my pamphlet, as it tallied with my\r\nconvictions, but that I clearly saw that from the moment I accepted\r\nthe post of ambassador I was bound to consider myself as a part of the\r\ngreat state machinery, and loyally support the policy emanating from\r\nthe Ballplatz. I still maintain that my standpoint is perfectly\r\njustifiable. A unified policy would be utterly impossible if every\r\nsubordinate official were to publish his own views, whether right or\r\nwrong, and I for my part would never, as Minister, have tolerated an\r\nambassador who attempted to pursue an independent policy of his own.\r\nTisza begged me to give my word of honour that I would make no attempt\r\nto introduce a policy opposed to that of Vienna and Budapest, to which\r\nI readily agreed, provided that the Archduke was agreeable to such\r\ndecision. I then had a conversation with the latter, and found that he\r\nquite agreed with my action, his argument being that as long as he was\r\nthe heir to the throne he would never attempt to introduce a policy\r\nopposed to that of the Emperor; consequently he would not expect it\r\nfrom me either. But should he come to the throne he would certainly\r\nmake an effort to carry out his own views, in which case I should no\r\nlonger be at Bucharest, but probably in some post where I would be in\r\na position to support his efforts. The Archduke begged me for the sake\r\nof my friendship for him to accept the post, which I finally decided\r\nto do after I obtained a promise from Berchtold that, at the end of\r\ntwo years as the longest term, he would put no obstacle in the way of\r\nmy retirement.\r\n\r\nThe Archduke Franz drew his pro-Roumanian proclivities from a very\r\nunreliable source. He hardly knew Roumania at all. So far as I know,\r\nhe had only once been in the country, and paid a short visit to King\r\nCarol at Sinaia; but the friendly welcome accorded to himself and his\r\nwife by the old King and Queen entirely took his warm heart by storm,\r\nand he mistook King Carol for Roumania. This is again a proof how\r\ngreatly the individual relations of great personalities can influence\r\nthe policy of nations. The royal couple met the Archduke at the\r\nstation; the Queen embraced and kissed the duchess and, placing her at\r\nher right side, drove with her to the castle. In short, it was the\r\nfirst time that the Duchess of Hohenberg had been treated as enjoying\r\nequal privileges with her husband. During his short stay in Roumania\r\nthe Archduke had the pleasure of seeing his wife treated as his equal\r\nand not as a person of slight importance, always relegated to the\r\nbackground. At the court balls in Vienna the duchess was always\r\nobliged to walk behind all the archduchesses, and never had any\r\ngentleman allotted to her whose arm she could take. In Roumania she\r\nwas _his wife_, and etiquette was not concerned with her birth. The\r\nArchduke valued this proof of friendly tactfulness on the part of the\r\nKing very highly, and always afterwards Roumania, in his eyes, was\r\nendowed with a special charm. Besides which he very correctly\r\nestimated that a change in certain political relations would effect a\r\ncloser alliance between Roumania and ourselves. He felt, rather than\r\nknew, that the Transylvanian question lay like a huge obstacle between\r\nVienna and Bucharest, and that this obstacle once removed would alter\r\nthe entire situation.\r\n\r\nTo find out the real condition of the alliance was my first task, and\r\nit was not difficult, as the first lengthy conferences I had with King\r\nCarol left no doubt in my mind that the old King himself considered\r\nthe alliance very unsafe. King Carol was an exceptionally clever man,\r\nvery cautious and deliberate, and it was not easy to make him talk if\r\nhe intended to be silent. The question of the vitality of the alliance\r\nwas settled by my suggesting to the King that the alliance should\r\nreceive pragmatic sanction, i.e. be ratified by the Parliaments at\r\nVienna, Budapest, and Bucharest. The alarm evinced by the King at the\r\nsuggestion, the very idea that the carefully guarded secret of the\r\nexistence of an alliance should be divulged, proved to me how totally\r\nimpossible it would be, in the circumstances, to infuse fresh life\r\ninto such dead matter.\r\n\r\nMy reports sent to the Ballplatz leave no doubt that I answered this\r\nfirst question by declaring in categorical fashion that the alliance\r\nwith Roumania was, under the existing conditions, nothing but a scrap\r\nof paper.\r\n\r\nThe second question, as to whether there were ways and means of\r\nrestoring vitality to the alliance, and what they were, was\r\ntheoretically just as easy to answer as difficult to carry out in\r\npractice. As already mentioned, the real obstacle in the way of closer\r\nrelations between Bucharest and Vienna was the question of Great\r\nRoumania; in other words, the Roumanian desire for national union with\r\nher \"brothers in Transylvania.\" This was naturally quite opposed to\r\nthe Hungarian standpoint. It is interesting, as well as characteristic\r\nof the then situation, that shortly after my taking up office in\r\nRoumania, Nikolai Filippescu (known later as a war fanatic) proposed\r\nthat Roumania should join with Transylvania and the whole of united\r\nGreat Roumania enter into relations with the Monarchy similar to the\r\nrelation of Bavaria to the German Empire. I admit that I welcomed the\r\nidea warmly, for if it were launched by a party which justly was held\r\nto be antagonistic to the Monarchy there can be no doubt that the\r\nmoderate element in Roumania would have accepted it with still greater\r\nsatisfaction. I still believe that had this plan been carried out it\r\nwould have led to a real linking of Roumania to the Monarchy, that the\r\nnotification would have met with no opposition, and consequently the\r\noutbreak of war would have found us very differently situated.\r\nUnfortunately the plan failed at its very first stage owing to\r\nTisza's strong and obstinate resistance. The Emperor Francis Joseph\r\nheld the same standpoint as Tisza, and it was out of the question to\r\nachieve anything by arguing. On the other hand, nobody had any idea\r\nthen that the great war, and with it the testing of the alliance, was\r\nso imminent, and I consoled myself for my unsuccessful efforts in the\r\nfirm hope that this grand plan, as it seemed to me both then and now,\r\nwould be realised one day under the Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Roumania a change was proceeding in the Government.\r\nMajorescu's Conservative Ministry gave way to the Liberal Ministry of\r\nBratianu. King Carol's policy of government was very peculiar. From\r\nthe very first his principle was never to proceed with violence or\r\neven much energy against injurious tendencies in his own country; but,\r\non the contrary, always to yield to the numerous claims made by\r\nextortioners. He knew his people thoroughly, and knew that both\r\nparties, Conservatives and Liberals, must alternately have access to\r\nthe manger until thoroughly satisfied and ready to make room the one\r\nfor the other. Almost every change in the Government was accomplished\r\nin that manner: the Opposition, desirous of coming into power, began\r\nwith threats and hints at revolution. Some highly unreasonable claim\r\nwould be put forward and vehemently insisted upon and the people\r\nincited to follow it up; the Government would retire, unable to accede\r\nto the demands, and the Opposition, once in power, would show no\r\nfurther signs of keeping their promise. The old King was well versed\r\nin the game; he allowed the opposition tide to rise to the highest\r\npossible limit, when he effected the necessary change of individuals\r\nand looked on until the game began again. It is the custom in\r\nRoumania, when a new party comes into power, to change the whole\r\npersonnel, even down to the lowest officials. This arrangement,\r\nobviously, has its drawbacks, though on the other hand it cannot be\r\ndenied that it is a practical one.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the Bratianu Ministry came into office in 1913.\r\nMajorescu's Government gave entire satisfaction to the King and the\r\nmoderate elements in the country. In the eyes of the Roumanians he had\r\njust achieved a great diplomatic success by the Peace of Bucharest and\r\nthe acquisition of the Dobrudsha, when Bratianu came forward with a\r\ndemand for vast agrarian reforms. These reforms are one of the\r\nhobby-horses of Roumanian policy which is always mounted when it is a\r\nquestion of making use of the poor unfortunate peasants, and the\r\nmanoeuvre invariably succeeds, largely owing to the lack of\r\nintelligence prevailing among the peasant population of Roumania, who\r\nare constantly made the tools of one or other party, and simply pushed\r\non one side when the object has been obtained. Bratianu also, once he\r\nwas in office, gave no thought to the fulfilment of his promises, but\r\ncalmly proceeded on the lines Majorescu had laid down in his time.\r\n\r\nStill, it was more difficult to arrive at a satisfactory settlement in\r\nforeign affairs with Bratianu than it had been with Majorescu, as the\r\nformer was thoroughly conversant with all West European matters, and\r\nat the bottom of his heart was anti-German. One of the distinctions to\r\nbe made between Liberals and Conservatives was that the Liberals had\r\nenjoyed a Parisian education: they spoke no German, only French; while\r\nthe Conservatives, taking Carp and Majorescu as models, were offshoots\r\nof Berlin. As it was impossible to carry out the plan of firmly and\r\ndefinitely linking Roumania to us by a change of Hungarian internal\r\npolicy, the idea naturally, almost automatically, arose to substitute\r\nBulgaria for Roumania. This idea, which found special favour with\r\nCount Tisza, could be carried out, both because, since the Bucharest\r\npeace of 1913, it was out of the question to bring Roumania and\r\nBulgaria under one roof, and because an alliance with Sofia would have\r\ndriven Roumania straight into the enemy camp. But Berchtold, as well\r\nas the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was opposed to this latter\r\neventuality, nor would the Emperor Francis Joseph have approved of\r\nsuch proceedings. Hence no change was made; Roumania was not won, nor\r\nwas Bulgaria substituted for her, and they were content in Vienna to\r\nleave everything to the future.\r\n\r\nIn a social sense the year that I spent in Roumania before the war was\r\nnot an unpleasant one. The relations of an Austrian-Hungarian\r\nAmbassador with the court, as with the numerous _Bojars_, were\r\npleasant and friendly, and nobody could then have imagined what\r\ntorrents of hatred were so soon to be launched against the\r\nAustro-Hungarian frontiers.\r\n\r\nSocial life became less pleasant during the war, as will be seen from\r\nthe following instance. There lived at Bucharest a certain\r\nLieut.-Colonel Prince Sturdza, who was a noted braggart and brawler\r\nand an inveterate enemy of Austria-Hungary. I did not know him\r\npersonally, and there was no personal reason for him to begin one day\r\nto abuse me publicly in the papers as being an advocate of the\r\nMonarchy. I naturally took not the slightest notice of his article,\r\nwhereupon he addressed an open letter to me in the _Adeverul_, in\r\nwhich he informed me that he would box my ears at the first\r\nopportunity. I telegraphed to Berchtold and asked the Emperor's\r\npermission to challenge this individual, as, being an officer, he was,\r\naccording to our ideas, entitled to satisfaction. The Emperor sent\r\nword that it was out of the question for an ambassador to fight a duel\r\nin the country to which he was accredited, and that I was to complain\r\nto the Roumanian Government. I accordingly went to Bratianu, who\r\ndeclared that he was totally unable to move in the matter. According\r\nto the laws and regulations of the country it was impossible to\r\nprotect a foreign ambassador against such abuse. If Sturdza carried\r\nout his threats he would be arrested. Until then nothing could be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nUpon this I assured Bratianu that if such were the case I would in\r\nfuture arm myself with a revolver, and if he attacked me shoot the man;\r\nif one lived in a country where the habits of the Wild West obtained,\r\none must act accordingly. I sent word to the lieutenant-colonel that\r\neach day, at one o'clock, I could be found at the Hotel Boulevard,\r\nwhere he would find a bullet awaiting him.\r\n\r\nThe next time I saw the Emperor Francis Joseph he asked for further\r\ninformation concerning the episode, and I told him of my conversation\r\nwith Bratianu and of my firm intention to be my own helper. The\r\nEmperor rejoined: \"Naturally you cannot allow yourself to be beaten.\r\nYou are quite right; if he lays hands on you, shoot him.\"\r\n\r\nI afterwards met Sturdza several times in restaurants and\r\ndrawing-rooms without his attempting to carry out his threats. This\r\nman, whose nature was that of a daring adventurer, afterwards deserted\r\nto the Russian army, and fought against us at a time when Roumania\r\nstill was neutral. I then completely lost sight of him.\r\n\r\nThe absolute freedom of the Press in the Balkan States, combined with\r\nthe brutality of the prevailing customs, produced the most varied\r\nresults, even going so far as abuse of their own kings. In this\r\nconnection King Carol gave me many drastic instances. While King\r\nFerdinand was still neutral, one of the comic papers contained a\r\npicture of the King taking aim at a hare, while underneath were these\r\nwords, supposed to come from the hare: \"My friend, you have long ears,\r\nI have long ears; you are a coward, I am a coward. Wherefore would my\r\nbrother shoot me?\"\r\n\r\nOn the day when war broke out this freedom of the Press was diverted\r\ninto a different channel and replaced by the severest control and\r\ncensorship.\r\n\r\nRoumania is a land of contrasts, both as regards the landscape, the\r\nclimate, and social conditions. The mountainous north, with the\r\nwonderful Carpathians, is one of the most beautiful districts. Then\r\nthere are the endless, unspeakably monotonous, but fertile plains of\r\nWallachia, leading into the valley of the Danube, which is a very\r\nParadise. In spring particularly, when the Danube each year overflows\r\nits banks, the beauty of the landscape baffles description. It is\r\nreminiscent of the tropics, with virgin forests standing in the water,\r\nand islands covered with luxuriant growth scattered here and there. It\r\nis an ideal country for the sportsman. All kinds of birds, herons,\r\nducks, pelicans, and others, are to be met with, besides wolves and\r\nwild cats, and days may be spent in rowing and walking in this\r\nParadise without wearying of it.\r\n\r\nThe Roumanians usually care but little for sport, being averse to\r\nphysical exertion. Whenever they can they leave the country and spend\r\ntheir time in Paris or on the Riviera. This love of travel is so\r\nstrong in them that a law was passed compelling them to spend a\r\ncertain portion of the year in their own country or else pay the\r\npenalty of a higher tax. The country people, in their sad poverty,\r\nform a great contrast to the enormously wealthy _Bojars_. Although\r\nvery backward in everything relating to culture, the Roumanian peasant\r\nis a busy, quiet, and easily satisfied type, unpretentious to a\r\ntouching degree when compared with the upper classes.\r\n\r\nSocial conditions among the upper ten thousand have been greatly\r\ncomplicated owing to the abolition of nobility, whereby the question\r\nof titles plays a part unequalled anywhere else in the world. Almost\r\nevery Roumanian has a title derived from one or other source; he\r\nvalues it highly, and takes it much amiss when a foreigner betrays his\r\nignorance on the subject. As a rule, it is safer to adopt the plan of\r\naddressing everyone as \"_Mon prince_.\" Another matter difficult for a\r\nforeigner to grasp is the real status of Roumanian society, owing to\r\nthe incessant divorce and subsequent remarriages. Nearly every woman\r\nhas been divorced at least once and married again, the result being,\r\non the one hand, the most complicated questions of relationship, and,\r\non the other, so many breaches of personal relations as to make it the\r\nmost difficult task to invite twenty Roumanians, particularly ladies,\r\nto dinner without giving offence in some quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the old régime it was one of the duties of the younger\r\nmembers of the Embassy to develop their budding diplomatic talents by\r\na clever compilation of the list for such a dinner and a wise\r\navoidance of any dangerous rock ahead. But as the question of rank in\r\nRoumania is taken just as seriously as though it were authorised,\r\nevery lady claims to have first rank--the correct allotment of places\r\nat a dinner is really a question for the most efficient diplomatic\r\ncapacities. There were about a dozen ladies in Bucharest who would\r\nactually not accept an invitation unless they were quite sure the\r\nplace of honour would be given to them.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor cut the Gordian knot of these difficulties by arranging\r\nto have dinner served at small separate tables, thus securing several\r\nplaces of honour, but not even by these means could he satisfy the\r\nambition of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhile at Sinaia I received the news of the assassination of the\r\nArchduke from Bratianu. I was confined to bed, suffering from\r\ninfluenza, when Bratianu telephoned to ask if I had heard that there\r\nhad been an accident to the Archduke's train in Bosnia, and that both\r\nhe and the duchess were killed. Soon after this first alarm came\r\nfurther news, leaving no doubt as to the gravity of the catastrophe.\r\nThe first impression in Roumania was one of profound and sincere\r\nsympathy and genuine consternation. Roumania never expected by means\r\nof war to succeed in realising her national ambitions; she only\r\nindulged in the hope that a friendly agreement with the Monarchy would\r\nlead to the union of all Roumanians, and in that connection Bucharest\r\ncentred all its hopes in the Archduke and heir to the throne. His\r\ndeath seemed to end the dream of a Greater Roumania, and the genuine\r\ngrief displayed in all circles in Roumania was the outcome of that\r\nfeeling. Take Jonescu, on learning the news while in my wife's\r\ndrawing-room, wept bitterly; and the condolences that I received were\r\nnot of the usual nature of such messages, but were expressions of the\r\nmost genuine sorrow. Poklewski, the Russian Ambassador, is said to\r\nhave remarked very brutally that there was no reason to make so much\r\nout of the event, and the general indignation that his words aroused\r\nproved how strong was the sympathy felt in the country for the\r\nmurdered Archduke.\r\n\r\nWhen the ultimatum was made known the entire situation changed at\r\nonce. I never had any illusions respecting the Roumanian psychology,\r\nand was quite clear in my own mind that the sincere regret at the\r\nArchduke's death was due to egotistical motives and to the fear of\r\nbeing compelled now to abandon the national ambition. The ultimatum\r\nand the danger of war threatening on the horizon completely altered\r\nthe Roumanian attitude, and it was suddenly recognised that Roumania\r\ncould achieve its object by other means, not by peace, but by war--not\r\n_with_, but _against_ the Monarchy. I would never have believed it\r\npossible that such a rapid and total change could have occurred\r\npractically within a few hours. Genuine and simulated indignation at\r\nthe tone of the ultimatum was the order of the day, and the universal\r\nconclusion arrived at was: _L'Autriche est devenue folle._ Men and\r\nwomen with whom I had been on a perfectly friendly footing for the\r\nlast year suddenly became bitter enemies. Everywhere I noticed a\r\nmixture of indignation and growing eagerness to realise at last their\r\nheart's dearest wish. The feeling in certain circles fluctuated for\r\nsome days. Roumanians had a great respect for Germany's military\r\npower, and the year 1870 was still fresh in the memory of many of\r\nthem. When England, however, joined the ranks of our adversaries their\r\nfears vanished, and from that moment it became obvious to the large\r\nmajority of the Roumanians that the realisation of their aspirations\r\nwas merely a question of time and of diplomatic efficiency. The wave\r\nof hatred and lust of conquest that broke over us in the first stage\r\nof the war was much stronger than in later stages, because the\r\nRoumanians made the mistake we all have committed of reckoning on too\r\nshort a duration of the war, and therefore imagined the decision to be\r\nnearer at hand than it actually was. After the great German successes\r\nin the West, after Görlitz and the downfall of Serbia, certain\r\ntendencies pointing to a policy of delay became noticeable among the\r\nRoumanians. With the exception of Carp and his little group all were\r\nmore or less ready at the very first to fling themselves upon us.\r\n\r\nLike a rock standing in the angry sea of hatred, poor old King Carol\r\nwas alone with his German sympathies. I had been instructed to read\r\nthe ultimatum to him the moment it was sent to Belgrade, and never\r\nshall I forget the impression it made on the old King when he heard\r\nit. He, wise old politician that he was, recognised at once the\r\nimmeasurable possibilities of such a step, and before I had finished\r\nreading the document he interrupted me, exclaiming: \"It will be a\r\nworld war.\" It was long before he could collect himself and begin to\r\ndevise ways and means by which a peaceful solution might still be\r\nfound. I may mention here that a short time previously the Tsar, with\r\nSassonoff, had been in Constanza for a meeting with the Roumanian\r\nroyal family. The day after the Tsar left I went to Constanza myself\r\nto thank the King for having conferred the Grand Cross of one of the\r\nRoumanian orders on me, obviously as a proof that the Russian visit\r\nhad not made him forget our alliance, and he gave me some interesting\r\ndetails of the said visit. Most interesting of all was his account of\r\nthe conversations with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs. On\r\nasking whether Sassonoff considered the situation in Europe to be as\r\nsafe as he (the King) did, Sassonoff answered in the affirmative,\r\n\"_pourvu que l'Autriche ne touche pas à la Serbie_.\" I at once, of\r\ncourse, reported this momentous statement to Vienna; but neither by\r\nthe King nor by myself, nor yet in Vienna, was the train of thought\r\nthen fully understood. The relations between Serbia and the Monarchy\r\nwere at that time no worse than usual; indeed, they were rather\r\nbetter, and there was not the slightest intention on our part to\r\ninjure the Serbians. But the suspicion that Sassonoff already then was\r\naware that the Serbians were planning something against us cannot be\r\ngot rid of.\r\n\r\nWhen the King asked me whether I had reported Sassonoff's important\r\nremark to Vienna, I replied that I had done so, and added that this\r\nremark was another reason to make me believe that the assassination\r\nwas a crime long since prepared and carried out under Russian\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\nThe crime that was enacted at Debruzin, which made such a sensation at\r\nthe time, gave rise to suspicions of a Russo-Roumanian attempt at\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nOn February 24, 1914, the Hungarian Correspondence Bureau published\r\nthe following piece of news:\r\n\r\n  A terrible explosion took place this morning in the official\r\n  premises of the newly-instituted Greek-Catholic Hungarian\r\n  bishopric, which are on the second floor of the Ministry of Trade\r\n  and Commerce in the Franz Deak Street. It occurred in the office\r\n  of the bishop's representative, the Vicar Michael Jaczkovics,\r\n  whose secretary, Johann Slapowszky, was also present in the room.\r\n  Both of them were blown to pieces. The Greek-Catholic bishop,\r\n  Stephan Miklossy, was in a neighbouring room, but had a most\r\n  marvellous escape. Alexander Csatth, advocate and solicitor to the\r\n  bishopric, who was in another room, was mortally wounded by the\r\n  explosion. In a third room the bishop's servant with his wife were\r\n  both killed. All the walls in the office premises fell in, and the\r\n  whole building is very much damaged. The explosion caused such a\r\n  panic in the house that all the inhabitants took flight and\r\n  vanished. All the windows of the neighbouring Town Hall in the\r\n  Verboczy Street were shattered by the concussion. Loose tiles were\r\n  hurled into the street and many passers-by were injured. The four\r\n  dead bodies and the wounded were taken to the hospital. The\r\n  bishop, greatly distressed, left the building and went to a\r\n  friend's house. The daughter of the Vicar Jaczkovics went out of\r\n  her mind on hearing of her father's tragic death. The cause of the\r\n  explosion has not yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nI soon became involved in the affair when Hungary and Roumania began\r\nmutually to blame one another as originators of the outrage. This led\r\nto numerous interventions and adjustments, and my task was intensified\r\nbecause a presumed accomplice of the murderer Catarau was arrested in\r\nBucharest, and his extradition to Hungary had to be effected by me.\r\nThis man, of the name of Mandazescu, was accused of having obtained a\r\nfalse passport for Catarau.\r\n\r\nCatarau, who was a Roumanian Russian from Bessarabia, vanished\r\ncompletely after the murder and left no trace. News came, now from\r\nSerbia, then from Albania, that he had been found, but the rumours\r\nwere always false. I chanced to hear something about the matter in\r\nthis way. I was on board a Roumanian vessel bound from Constanza to\r\nConstantinople, when I accidentally overheard two Roumanian naval\r\nofficers talking together. One of them said: \"That was on the day\r\nwhen the police brought Catarau on board to help him to get away\r\nsecretly.\"\r\n\r\nCatarau was heard of later at Cairo, which he appears to have reached\r\nwith the aid of Roumanian friends.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be asserted that the Roumanian Government was implicated in\r\nthe plot--but the Roumanian authorities certainly were, for in the\r\nBalkans, as in Russia, there are many bands like the _Cerna Ruka_, the\r\n_Narodna Odbrena_, etc., etc., who carry on their activities alongside\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nIt was a crime committed by some Russian or Roumanian secret society,\r\nand the Governments of both countries showed surprisingly little\r\ninterest in investigating the matter and delivering the culprits up to\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nOn June 15 I heard from a reliable source that Catarau had been seen\r\nin Bucharest. He walked about the streets quite openly in broad\r\ndaylight, and no one interfered with him; then he disappeared.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to my interview with the old King. Filled with\r\nalarm, he dispatched that same evening two telegrams, one to Belgrade\r\nand one to Petersburg, urging that the ultimatum be accepted without\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nThe terrible distress of mind felt by the King when, like a sudden\r\nflash of lightning from the clouds, he saw before him a picture of the\r\nworld war may be accounted for because he felt certain that the\r\nconflict between his personal convictions and his people's attitude\r\nwould suddenly be known to all. The poor old King fought the fight to\r\nthe best of his ability, but it killed him. King Carol's death was\r\ncaused by the war. The last weeks of his life were a torture to him;\r\neach message that I had to deliver he felt as the lash of a whip. I\r\nwas enjoined to do all I could to secure Roumania's prompt\r\nco-operation, according to the terms of the Alliance, and I was even\r\nobliged to go so far as to remind him that \"a promise given allows of\r\nno prevarication: that a treaty is a treaty, and _his honour_ obliged\r\nhim to unsheathe his sword.\" I recollect one particularly painful\r\nscene, where the King, weeping bitterly, flung himself across his\r\nwriting-table and with trembling hands tried to wrench from his neck\r\nhis order _Pour le Mérite_. I can affirm without any exaggeration that\r\nI could see him wasting away under the ceaseless moral blows dealt to\r\nhim, and that the mental torment he went through undoubtedly shortened\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth was well aware of all, but she never took my action\r\namiss; she understood that I had to deliver the messages, but that it\r\nwas not I who composed them.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth was a good, clever and touchingly simple woman, not a\r\n_poet qui court après l'esprit_, but a woman who looked at the world\r\nthrough conciliatory and poetical glasses. She was a good\r\nconversationalist, and there was always a poetic charm in all she did.\r\nThere hung on the staircase a most beautiful sea picture, which I\r\ngreatly admired while the Queen talked to me about the sea, about her\r\nlittle villa at Constanza, which, built on the extreme end of the\r\nquay, seems almost to lie in the sea. She spoke, too, of her travels\r\nand impressions when on the high seas, and as she spoke the great\r\nlonging for all that is good and beautiful made itself felt, and this\r\nis what she said to me: \"The sea lives. If there could be found any\r\nsymbol of eternity it would be the sea, endless in greatness and\r\neverlasting in movement. The day is dull and stormy. One after another\r\nthe glassy billows come rolling in and break with a roar on the rocky\r\nshore. The small white crests of the waves look as if covered with\r\nsnow. And the sea breathes and draws its breath with the ebb and flow\r\nof the tide. The tide is the driving power that forces the mighty\r\nwaters from Equator to North Pole. And thus it works, day and night,\r\nyear by year, century by century. It takes no heed of the perishable\r\nbeings who call themselves lords of the world, who live only for a\r\nday, coming and going and vanishing almost as they come. The sea\r\nremains to work. It works for all, for men, for animals, for plants,\r\nfor without the sea there could be no organic life in the world. The\r\nsea is like a great filter, which alone can produce the change of\r\nmatter that is necessary for life. In the course of a century\r\nnumberless rivers carry earth to the sea. Each river carries without\r\nceasing its burden of earth and sand to the ocean; and the sea\r\nreceives the load which is carried by the current far out to sea, and\r\nslowly and by degrees in the course of time the sea dissolves or\r\ncrushes all it has received. No matter to the sea if the process lasts\r\na thousand years or more--it may even last for ages, who can tell?\r\n\r\n\"But one day, quite suddenly, the sea begins to wander. Once there was\r\nsea everywhere, and all continents are born from the sea. One day land\r\narose out of the sea. The birth was of a revolutionary nature, there\r\nwere earthquakes, volcanic craters, falling cities and dying men--but\r\nnew land was there. Or else it moves slowly, invisibly, a metre or two\r\nin a century, and returns to the land it used to possess. Thus it\r\nrestores the soil it stole from it, but cleaner, refined and full of\r\nvitality to live and to create. Such is the sea and its work.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the words of the old half-blind Queen, who can never look\r\nupon the beloved picture again, but she told me how she always\r\nidolised the sea, and how her grand nephews and nieces shared her\r\nfeelings, and how she grew young again with them when she told them\r\ntales of olden times.\r\n\r\nOne could listen to her for hours without growing weary, and always\r\nthere was some beautiful thought or word to carry away and think over.\r\n\r\nDoubtless such knowledge would be more correct were it taken from some\r\ngeological work. But Carmen Sylva's words invariably seemed to strike\r\nsome poetic chord; that is what made her so attractive.\r\n\r\nShe loved to discourse on politics, which for her meant King Carol. He\r\nwas her all in all. After his death, when it was said that all states\r\nin the world were losing in the terrible war, she remarked: \"Roumania\r\nhas already lost her most precious possession.\" She never spoke of her\r\nown poems and writings. In politics her one thought besides King Carol\r\nwas Albania. She was deeply attached to the Princess of Wied, and\r\nshowed her strong interest in the country where she lived. Talking\r\nabout the Wieds one day afforded me an opportunity of seeing the King\r\nvexed with his wife; it was the only time I ever noticed it. It was\r\nwhen we were at Sinaia, and I was, as often occurred, sitting with the\r\nKing. The Queen came into the room, which she was otherwise not in the\r\nhabit of entering, bringing with her a telegram from the Princess of\r\nWied in which she asked for something--I cannot now remember what--for\r\nAlbania. The King refused, but the Queen insisted, until he at last\r\ntold her very crossly to leave him in peace, as he had other things to\r\nthink of than Albania.\r\n\r\nAfter King Carol's death she lost all her vital energy, and the change\r\nin the political situation troubled her. She was very fond of her\r\nnephew Ferdinand--hers was a truly loving heart--and she trembled lest\r\nhe should commit some act of treachery. I remember once how, through\r\nher tears, she said to me: \"Calm my fears. Tell me that he will never\r\nbe guilty of such an act.\" I was unable to reassure her, but a kind\r\nFate spared her from hearing the declaration of war.\r\n\r\nLater, not long before her death, the old Queen was threatened with\r\ntotal blindness. She was anxious to put herself in the hands of a\r\nFrench oculist for an operation for cataract, who would naturally be\r\nobliged to travel through the Monarchy in order to reach Bucharest. At\r\nher desire I mentioned the matter in Vienna, and the Emperor Francis\r\nJoseph at once gave the requisite permission for the journey.\r\n\r\nAfter a successful operation, the Queen sent a short autograph poem to\r\none of my children, adding that it was her _first_ letter on\r\nrecovering her sight. At the same time she was again very uneasy\r\nconcerning politics.\r\n\r\nI wrote her the following letter:\r\n\r\n  Your Majesty,--My warmest thanks for the beautiful little poem you\r\n  have sent to my boy. That it was granted to me to contribute\r\n  something towards the recovery of your sight is in itself a\r\n  sufficient reward, and no thanks are needed. That Your Majesty has\r\n  addressed the first written lines to my children delights and\r\n  touches me.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile Your Majesty must not be troubled regarding politics. It\r\n  is of no avail. For the moment Roumania will retain the policy of\r\n  the late King, and God alone knows what the future will bring\r\n  forth.\r\n\r\n  We are all like dust in this terrible hurricane sweeping through\r\n  the world. We are tossed helplessly hither and thither and know\r\n  not whether we are to face disaster or success. The point is not\r\n  whether we live or die, but how it is done. In that respect King\r\n  Carol set an example to us all.\r\n\r\n  I hope King Ferdinand may never forget that, together with the\r\n  throne, his uncle bequeathed to him a political creed, a creed of\r\n  honour and loyalty, and I am persuaded that Your Majesty is the\r\n  best guardian of the bequest.\r\n\r\n  Your Majesty's grateful and devoted\r\n\r\n  CZERNIN.\r\n\r\nWhen I said that King Carol fought the fight to the best of his\r\nability, I intended to convey that no one could expect him to be\r\ndifferent from what he always was. The King never possessed in any\r\nspecial degree either energy, strength of action, or adventurous\r\ncourage, and at the time I knew him, as an old man, he had none of\r\nthose attributes. He was a clever diplomat, a conciliatory power, a\r\nsafe mediator, and one who avoided trouble, but not of a nature to\r\nrisk all and weather the storm. That was known to all, and no one,\r\ntherefore, could think that the King would try to put himself on our\r\nside against the clearly expressed views of all Roumania. My idea is\r\nthat if he had been differently constituted he could successfully have\r\nrisked the experiment. The King possessed in Carp a man of quite\r\nunusual, even reckless, activity and energy, and from the first moment\r\nhe placed himself and his activities at the King's disposal. If the\r\nKing, without asking, had ordered mobilisation, Carp's great energy\r\nwould have certainly carried it through. But, in the military\r\nsituation as it was then, the Roumanian army would have been forced to\r\nthe rear of the Russian, and in all probability the first result of\r\nthe battlefields would have changed the situation entirely, and the\r\nblood that was shed mutually in victorious battles would have brought\r\nforth the unity that the spirit of our alliance never succeeded in\r\nevolving. But the King was not a man of such calibre. He could not\r\nchange his nature, and what he did do entirely concurred with his\r\nmethods from the time he ascended the throne.\r\n\r\nAs long as the King lived there was the positive assurance that\r\nRoumania would not side against us, for he would have prevented any\r\nmobilisation against us with the same firm wisdom which had always\r\nenabled him to avert any agitation in the land. He would then have\r\nseen that the Roumanians are not a warlike people like the Bulgarians,\r\nand that Roumania had not the slightest intention of risking anything\r\nin the campaign. A policy of procrastination in the wise hands of the\r\nKing would have delayed hostilities against us indefinitely.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the outbreak of war Bratianu began his game, which\r\nconsisted of entrenching the Roumanian Government firmly and willingly\r\nin a position between the two groups of Powers, and bandying favours\r\nabout from one to the other, reaping equal profits from each, until\r\nthe moment when the stronger of the two should be recognised as such\r\nand the weaker then attacked.\r\n\r\nEven from 1914-16 Roumania was never really neutral. She always\r\nfavoured our enemies, and as far as lay in her power hindered all our\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nThe transport of horses and ammunition to Turkey in the summer of 1915\r\nthat was exacted from us was an important episode. Turkey was then in\r\ngreat danger, and was asking anxiously for munitions. Had the\r\nRoumanian Government adopted the standpoint not to favour any of the\r\nbelligerent Powers it would have been a perfectly correct attitude,\r\nviewed from a neutral standpoint, but she never did adopt such\r\nstandpoint, as is shown by her allowing the Serbians to receive\r\ntransports of Russian ammunition via the Danube, thus showing great\r\npartiality. When all attempts failed, the munitions were transmitted,\r\npartially at any rate, through other means.\r\n\r\nAt that time, too, Russian soldiers were allowed in Roumania and were\r\nnot molested, whereas ours were invariably interned.\r\n\r\nTwo Austrian airmen once landed by mistake in Roumania, and were, of\r\ncourse, interned immediately. The one was a cadet of the name of\r\nBerthold and a pilot whose name I have forgotten. From their prison\r\nthey appealed to me to help them, and I sent word that they must\r\nendeavour to obtain permission to pay me a visit. A few days later the\r\ncadet appeared, escorted by a Roumanian officer as guard. This\r\nofficer, not being allowed without special permission to set foot on\r\nAustro-Hungarian soil, was obliged to remain in the street outside the\r\nhouse. I had the gates closed, put the cadet into one of my cars, sent\r\nhim out through the back entrance, and had him driven to Giurgui,\r\nwhere he got across the Danube, and in two hours was again at liberty.\r\nAfter a lengthy and futile wait the officer departed. His protests\r\ncame too late.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate pilot who was left behind was not allowed to come to\r\nthe Embassy. One night, however, he made his escape through the window\r\nand arrived. I kept him concealed for some time, and he eventually\r\ncrossed the frontier safely and got away by rail to Hungary.\r\n\r\nBratianu reproached me later for what I had done, but I told him it\r\nwas in consequence of his not having strictly adhered to his\r\nneutrality. Had our soldiers been left unmolested, as in the case of\r\nthe Russians, I should not have been compelled to act as I had done.\r\n\r\nBratianu can never seriously have doubted that the Central Powers\r\nwould succumb, and his sympathies were always with the Entente, not\r\nonly on account of his bringing up, but also because of that political\r\nspeculation. During the course of subsequent events there were times\r\nwhen Bratianu to a certain extent seemed to vacillate, especially at\r\nthe time of our great offensive against Russia. The break through at\r\nGörlitz and the irresistible advance into the interior of Russia had\r\nan astounding effect in Roumania. Bratianu, who obviously knew very\r\nlittle about strategy, could simply not understand that the Russian\r\nmillions, whom he imagined to be in a fair way to Vienna and Berlin,\r\nshould suddenly begin to rush back and a fortress like Warsaw be\r\ndemolished like a house of cards. He was evidently very anxious then\r\nand must have had many a disturbed night. On the other hand, those who\r\nto begin with, though not for, still were not against Austria began to\r\nraise their heads and breathe more freely. The victory of the Central\r\nPowers appeared on the horizon like a fresh event. That was the\r\nhistoric moment when Roumania might have been coerced into active\r\nco-operation, but not the Bratianu Ministry. Bratianu himself would\r\nnever in any case have ranged himself on our side, but if we could\r\nhave made up our minds then to instal a Majorescu or a Marghiloman\r\nMinistry in office, we could have had the Roumanian army with us. In\r\nconnection with this were several concrete proposals. In order to\r\ncarry out the plan we should have been compelled to make territorial\r\nconcessions in Hungary to a Majorescu Ministry--Majorescu demanded it\r\nas a primary condition to his undertaking the conduct of affairs, and\r\nthis proposal failed owing to Hungary's obstinate resistance. It is a\r\nterrible but a just punishment that poor Hungary, who contributed so\r\nmuch to our definite defeat, should be the one to suffer the most from\r\nthe consequences thereof, and that the Roumanians, so despised and\r\npersecuted by Hungary, should gain the greatest triumphs on her\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nOne of the many reproaches that have been brought against me recently\r\nis to the effect that I, as ambassador at Bucharest, should have\r\nresigned if my proposals were not accepted in Vienna. These reproaches\r\nare dictated by quite mistaken ideas of competency and responsibility.\r\nIt is the duty of a subordinate official to describe the situation as\r\nhe sees it and to make such proposals as he considers right, but the\r\nresponsibility for the policy is with the Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, and it would lead to the most impossible and absurd state of\r\nthings if every ambassador whose proposals were rejected were to draw\r\nthe conclusion that his resignation was a necessary consequence\r\nthereof. If officials were to resign because they did not agree with\r\nthe view of their chief, it would mean that almost all of them would\r\nsend in their resignations.\r\n\r\nEspionage and counter-espionage have greatly flourished during the\r\nwar. In that connection Russia showed great activity in Roumania.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1914, an event occurred which was very unfortunate for me.\r\nI drove from Bucharest to Sinaia, carrying certain political\r\ndocuments with me in a dispatch-case, which, by mistake, was fastened\r\non behind instead of being laid in the car. On the way the case was\r\nunstrapped and stolen. I made every effort to get it back, and\r\neventually recovered it after a search of three weeks, involving much\r\nexpense. It was found at last in some peasant's barn, but nothing had\r\napparently been abstracted save the cigarettes that were in it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after the occupation of Bucharest copies and photographs\r\nof all my papers were found in Bratianu's house.\r\n\r\nAfter the loss of the dispatch-case I at once tendered my resignation\r\nin Vienna, but it was not accepted by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Red Book on Roumania, published by Burian, which contains a\r\nsummary of my most important reports, gives a very clear picture of\r\nthe several phases of that period and the approaching danger of war.\r\nThe several defeats that Roumania suffered justified the fears of all\r\nthose who warned her against premature intervention. In order to\r\nrender the situation quite clear, it must here be explained that\r\nduring the time immediately preceding Roumania's entry into war there\r\nwere really only two parties in the country: the one was hostile to us\r\nand wished for an immediate declaration of war, and the other was the\r\n\"friendly\" one that did not consider the situation ripe for action and\r\nadvised waiting until we were weakened still more. During the time of\r\nour successes the \"friendly\" party carried the day. Queen Marie, I\r\nbelieve, belonged to the latter. From the beginning of the war, she\r\nwas always in favour of \"fighting by the side of England,\" as she\r\nalways looked upon herself as an Englishwoman, but, at the last moment\r\nat any rate, she appears to have thought the time for action\r\npremature. A few days before the declaration of war she invited me to\r\na farewell lunch, which was somewhat remarkable, as we both knew that\r\nin a very few days we should be enemies. After lunch I took the\r\nopportunity of telling her that I _likewise_ was aware of the\r\nsituation, but that \"the Bulgarians would be in Bucharest before the\r\nRoumanians reached Budapest.\" She entered into the conversation very\r\ncalmly, being of a very frank nature and not afraid of hearing the\r\ntruth. A few days later a letter was opened at the censor's office\r\nfrom a lady-in-waiting who had been present at the lunch. It was\r\nevidently not intended for our eyes; it contained a description of the\r\n_déjeuner fort embêtant_, with some unflattering remarks about me.\r\n\r\nQueen Marie never lost her hope in a final victory. She did not\r\nperhaps agree with Bratianu in all his tactics, but a declaration of\r\nwar on us was always an item on her programme. Even in the distressing\r\ndays of their disastrous defeat she always kept her head above water.\r\nOne of the Queen's friends told me afterwards that when our armies,\r\nfrom south, north and west, were nearing Bucharest, when day and night\r\nthe earth shook with the ceaseless thunder of the guns, the Queen\r\nquietly went on with her preparations for departure, and was firmly\r\npersuaded that she would return as \"Empress of all the Roumanians.\" I\r\nhave been told that after the taking of Bucharest Bratianu collapsed\r\naltogether, and it was Queen Marie who comforted and encouraged him.\r\nHer English blood always asserted itself. After we had occupied\r\nWallachia, I received absolutely reliable information from England,\r\naccording to which she had telegraphed to King George from Jassy,\r\nrecommending \"her little but courageous people\" to his further\r\nprotection. After the Peace of Bucharest strong pressure was brought\r\nto bear on me to effect the abdication of the King and Queen. It would\r\nnot in any way have altered the situation, as the Entente would\r\nnaturally have reinstated them when victory was gained; but I opposed\r\nall such efforts, not for the above reason, which I could not foresee,\r\nbut from other motives, to be mentioned later, although I was\r\nperfectly certain that Queen Marie would always remain our enemy.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of war created a very uncomfortable situation for all\r\nAustro-Hungarians and Germans. I came across several friends in the\r\nAustro-Hungarian colony who had been beaten by the Roumanian soldiers\r\nwith the butt-ends of their rifles on their way to prison. I saw wild\r\nscenes of panic and flight that were both grotesque and revolting, and\r\nthe cruel sport lasted for days.\r\n\r\nIn Vienna all subjects of an enemy state were exempt from deportation.\r\nIn my capacity as Minister I ordered reprisals on Roumanian citizens,\r\nas there were no other means to relieve the fate of our poor refugees.\r\nAs soon as the neutral Powers notified that the treatment had become\r\nmore humane, they were set free.\r\n\r\nIf we showed ourselves at the windows or in the garden of the Embassy\r\nthe crowd scoffed and jeered at us, and at the station, when we left,\r\na young official whom I asked for information simply turned his back\r\non me.\r\n\r\nA year and a half later I was again in Bucharest. The tide of victory\r\nhad carried us far, and we came to make peace. We were again subjects\r\nof interest to the crowds in the streets, but in very different\r\nfashion. A tremendous ovation awaited us when we appeared in the\r\ntheatre, and I could not show myself in the street without having a\r\ncrowd of admirers in my wake.\r\n\r\nBefore all this occurred, and when war was first declared, the members\r\nof the Embassy, together with about 150 persons belonging to the\r\nAustro-Hungarian colony, including many children, were interned, and\r\nspent ten very unpleasant days, as we were not sure whether we should\r\nbe released or not. We had occasion during that time to witness three\r\nZeppelin raids over Bucharest, which, seen in the wonderful moonlight,\r\ncloudless nights under the tropical sky, made an unforgettable\r\nimpression on us.\r\n\r\nI find the following noted in my diary:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Bucharest, August, 1916._\r\n\r\n\"The Roumanians have declared war on my wife and daughter too. A\r\ndeputation composed of two officials from the Ministry for Foreign\r\nAffairs, in frock-coats and top hats, appeared last night at eleven\r\no'clock in my villa at Sinaia. My wife was roused out of her sleep,\r\nand by the light of a single candle--more is forbidden on account of\r\nthe Zeppelin raids--they informed her that Roumania had declared war\r\non us.\r\n\r\n\"As the speaker put it, '_Vous avez déclaré la guerre_.' He then read\r\nthe whole declaration of war aloud to them both. Bratianu sent word\r\nto me that he would have a special train sent to take my wife and\r\ndaughter and the whole personnel of the Embassy to Bucharest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Bucharest, September, 1916._\r\n\r\n\"The Roumanians really expected a Zeppelin attack at once. So far it\r\nhas not occurred, and they begin to feel more at ease, and say that it\r\nis too far for the Zeppelins to come all the way from Germany. They\r\nseem not to be aware that Mackensen has Zeppelins in Bulgaria. But who\r\ncan tell whether they really will come?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Bucharest, September, 1916._\r\n\r\n\"Last night a Zeppelin did come. About three o'clock we were roused by\r\nthe shrill police whistles giving the alarm. The telephone notified us\r\nthat a Zeppelin had crossed the Danube, and all the church bells began\r\nto peal. Suddenly darkness and silence reigned, and the whole town,\r\nlike some great angry animal, sullen and morose, prepared for the\r\nenemy attack. Nowhere was there light or sound. The town, with a\r\nwonderful starry firmament overhead, waited in expectation. Fifteen,\r\ntwenty minutes went by, when suddenly a shot was fired and, as though\r\nit were a signal, firing broke out in every direction. The\r\nanti-aircraft guns fired incessantly, and the police, too, did their\r\nbest, firing in the air. But what were they firing at? There was\r\nabsolutely nothing to be seen. The searchlights then came into play.\r\nSweeping the heavens from east to west, from north to south, they\r\nsearched the firmament, but could not find the Zeppelin. Was it really\r\nthere, or was the whole thing due to excited Roumanian nerves?\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly a sound was heard: the noise of the propeller overhead. It\r\nsounded so near in the clear, starry night, we felt we must be able to\r\nsee it. But the noise died away in the direction of Colbroceni. Then\r\nwe heard the first bomb. Like a gust of wind it whistled through the\r\nair, followed by a crash and an explosion. A second and third came\r\nquickly after. The firing became fiercer, but they can see nothing\r\nand seem to aim at where the sound comes from. The searchlights sway\r\nbackwards and forwards. Now one of them has caught the airship, which\r\nlooks like a small golden cigar. Both the gondolas can be seen quite\r\ndistinctly, and the searchlight keeps it well in view, and now a\r\nsecond one has caught it. It looks as though this air cruiser is\r\nhanging motionless in the sky, brilliantly lit up by the searchlights\r\nright and left. Then the guns begin in good earnest. Shrapnel bursts\r\nall around, a wonderful display of fireworks, but it is impossible to\r\nsay if the aim is good and if the monster is in danger. Smaller and\r\nsmaller grows the Zeppelin, climbing rapidly higher and higher, until\r\nsuddenly the miniature cigar disappears. Still the searchlights sweep\r\nthe skies, hoping to find their prey again.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly utter silence reigns. Have they gone? Is the attack over?\r\nHas one been hit? Forced to land? The minutes go by. We are all now on\r\nthe balcony--the women, too--watching the scene. Again comes the\r\nwell-known sound--once heard never forgotten--as though the wind were\r\ngetting up, then a dull thud and explosion. This time it is farther\r\naway towards the forts. Again the firing breaks out, and machine-guns\r\nbark at the friendly moon; searchlights career across the heavens, but\r\nfind nothing. Again there falls a bomb--much nearer this time--and\r\nagain comes the noise of the propellers louder and louder. Shrapnel\r\nbursts just over the Embassy, and the Zeppelin is over our heads. We\r\nhear the noise very distinctly, but can see nothing. Again a sudden\r\nsilence everywhere, which has a curious effect after the terrible\r\nnoise. Time passes, but nothing more is heard. The first rays of dawn\r\nare seen in the east; the stars slowly pale.\r\n\r\n\"A child is heard to cry somewhere, far away: strange how clearly it\r\nsounds in the silent night. There is a feeling as though the terrified\r\ntown hardly dared breathe or move for fear the monster might return.\r\nAnd how many more such nights are there in prospect? In the calm of\r\nthis fairylike dawn, slowly rising, the crying of the child strikes a\r\nnote of discord, infinitely sad. But the crying of the child--does it\r\nnot find an echo among the millions whom this terrible war has driven\r\nto desperation?\r\n\r\n\"The sun rises like a blood-red ball. For some hours the Roumanians\r\ncan take to sleep and gather fresh strength, but they know now that\r\nthe Zeppelin's visit will not be the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Bucharest, September, 1916._\r\n\r\n\"The Press is indignant about the nocturnal attack. Bucharest is\r\ncertainly a fortress, but it should be known that the guns are no\r\nlonger in the forts. It was stated in the _Adeverul_ that the heroic\r\nresistance put up in defence was most successful. That the airship,\r\nbadly damaged, was brought down near Bucharest, and that a commission\r\nstarted off at once to make sure whether it was an aeroplane or a\r\nZeppelin!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Bucharest, September, 1916._\r\n\r\n\"The Zeppelin returned again this evening and took us by surprise. It\r\nseemed to come from the other side of Plojest, and the sentries on the\r\nDanube must have missed it. Towards morning the night watch at the\r\nEmbassy whose duty it is to see that there is no light in the house\r\nsaw a huge mass descending slowly over the Embassy till it almost\r\ntouched the roof. It hovered there a few minutes, making observations.\r\nNo one noticed it until suddenly the engines started again, and it\r\ndropped the first bomb close to the Embassy. A direct hit was made on\r\nthe house of the Ambassador Jresnea Crecianu, and twenty gendarmes who\r\nwere there were killed. The royal palace was also damaged. The\r\nGovernment is apparently not satisfied with the anti-aircraft forces,\r\nbut concludes that practice will make them perfect. Opportunity for\r\npractice will certainly not be lacking.\r\n\r\n\"Our departure is being delayed by every sort of pretext. One moment\r\nit seems as though we should reach home via Bulgaria. This idea suited\r\nBratianu extremely well, as the Bulgarian willingness to grant\r\npermission was a guarantee that they had no plans of attack. But he\r\nreckoned in this without his host. E. and W. are greatly alarmed\r\nbecause the Roumanians intend to detain them, and will probably hang\r\nthem as spies. I have told them, 'Either we all stay here or we all\r\nstart together. No one will be given up.' That appears to have\r\nsomewhat quieted their fears.\r\n\r\n\"As might be expected, these nocturnal visits had disagreeable\r\nconsequences for us. The Roumanians apparently thought that it was not\r\na question of Zeppelins, but of Austro-Hungarian airships, and that my\r\npresence in the town would afford a certain protection against the\r\nattacks; after the first one they declared that for every Roumanian\r\nkilled ten Austrians or Bulgarians would be executed, and the hostile\r\ntreatment to which we were subjected grew worse and worse. The food\r\nwas cut down and was terribly bad, and finally the water supply was\r\ncut off. With the tropical temperature that prevailed and the\r\novercrowding of a house that normally was destined to hold twenty, and\r\nnow housed 170, persons, the conditions within the space of\r\ntwenty-four hours became unbearable and the atmosphere so bad that\r\nseveral people fell ill with fever, and neither doctor nor medicine\r\nwas obtainable. Thanks to the energetic intervention of the Dutch\r\nAmbassador, Herr von Vredenburch, who had undertaken the charge of our\r\nState interests, it was finally possible to alter the conditions and\r\nto avert the outbreak of an epidemic.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was just about that time that our Military Attaché, Lieut.-Colonel\r\nBaron Randa, made a telling remark. One of our Roumanian slave-drivers\r\nwas in the habit of paying us a daily visit and talking in the\r\nbombastic fashion the Roumanians adopted when boasting of their\r\nimpending victories. The word \"Mackensen\" occurred in Randa's answer.\r\nThe Roumanian was surprised to hear the name, unknown to him, and\r\nsaid: \"Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce Mackensen? Je connais beaucoup\r\nd'Allemands, mais je n'ai jamais fait la connaissance de M.\r\nMackensen.\" \"Eh bien,\" replied Randa, patting him on the shoulder,\r\n\"vous la ferez cette connaissance, je vous en guarantie.\" Three months\r\nafter that Mackensen had occupied all Wallachia and had his\r\nheadquarters at Bucharest. By that time, therefore, his name must have\r\nbeen more familiar to our Roumanian friend.\r\n\r\nAt last we set off for home via Russia and had a very interesting\r\njourney lasting three weeks, via Kieff, Petersburg, Sweden, and\r\nGermany. To spend three weeks in a train would seem very wearisome to\r\nmany; but as everything in this life is a matter of habit we soon grew\r\nso accustomed to it that when we arrived in Vienna there were many of\r\nus who could not sleep the first few nights in a proper bed, as we\r\nmissed the shaking of the train. Meanwhile, we had every comfort on\r\nthe special train, and variety as well, especially when, on Bratianu's\r\norders, we were detained at a little station called Baratinskaja, near\r\nKieff. The reason of this was never properly explained, but it was\r\nprobably owing to difficulties over the departure of the Roumanian\r\nAmbassador in Sofia and to the wish to treat us as hostages. The\r\njourney right through the enemy country was remarkable. Fierce battles\r\nwere just then being fought in Galicia, and day and night we passed\r\nendless trains conveying gay and smiling soldiers to the front, and\r\nothers returning full of pale, bandaged wounded men, whose groans we\r\nheard as we passed them. We were greeted everywhere in friendly\r\nfashion by the population, and there was not a trace of the hatred we\r\nhad experienced in Roumania. Everything that we saw bore evidence of\r\nthe strictest order and discipline. None of us could think it possible\r\nthat the Empire was on the eve of a revolution, and when the Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph questioned me on my return as to whether I had reason\r\nto believe that a revolution would occur, I discountenanced the idea\r\nmost emphatically.\r\n\r\nThis did not please the old Emperor. He said afterwards to one of his\r\nsuite: \"Czernin has given a correct account of Roumania, but he must\r\nhave been asleep when he passed through Russia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe development of Roumanian affairs during the war occurs in three\r\nphases, the first of which was in King Carol's reign. Then neutrality\r\nwas guaranteed. On the other hand, it was not possible during those\r\nmonths to secure Roumania's co-operation because we, in the first\r\nperiod of the war, were so unfavourably situated in a military sense\r\nthat public opinion in Roumania would not voluntarily have consented\r\nto a war at our side, and, as already mentioned, such forcible action\r\nwould not have met with the King's approval.\r\n\r\nIn the second phase of the war, dating from King Carol's death to our\r\ndefeat at Luck, conditions were quite different. In this second phase\r\nwere included the greatest military successes the Central Powers ever\r\nobtained. The downfall of Serbia and the conquest of the whole of\r\nPoland occurred during this period, and, I repeat, in those months we\r\ncould have secured the active co-operation of Roumania. Nevertheless,\r\nI must make it clearly understood here that if the political\r\npreliminaries for intervention on the part of Roumania were not\r\nundertaken, the fault must not be ascribed to the then Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, but to the _vis major_ which opposed the project\r\nunder the form of a Hungarian veto. As previously stated, Majorescu,\r\nas well as Marghiloman, would only have given his consent to\r\nco-operation if Roumania had been given a slice of the Hungarian\r\nstate. Thanks to the attitude of absolute refusal observed at the\r\nBallplatz, the territory in question was never definitely decided on,\r\nbut the idea probably was Transylvania and a portion of the Bukovina.\r\nI cannot say whether Count Burian, if he had escaped other influences,\r\nwould have adopted the plan, but certain it is that however ready and\r\nwilling he was to act he would never have carried out the plan against\r\nthe Hungarian Parliament. According to the Constitution, the Hungarian\r\nParliament is sovereign in the Hungarian State, and without the use of\r\narmed means Hungary could never have been induced to cede any part of\r\nher territory.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, however, that it would have been impossible during the\r\nworld war to have stirred up an armed conflict between Vienna and\r\nBudapest. My then German colleague, von dem Busche, entirely agreed\r\nwith me that Hungary ought to make some territorial sacrifices in\r\norder to encourage Roumania's intervention. I firmly believe that\r\nthen, and similarly before the Italian declaration of war, a certain\r\npressure was brought to bear direct on Vienna by Berlin to this end--a\r\npressure which merely contributed to strengthen and intensify Tisza's\r\nopposition. For Germany, the question was far simpler; she had drawn\r\npayment for her great gains from a foreign source. The cession of the\r\nBukovina might possibly have been effected, as Stürgkh did not object,\r\nbut that alone would not have satisfied Roumania.\r\n\r\nIt was quite clear that the opposition to the ceding of Transylvania\r\noriginated in Hungary. But this opposition was not specially Tisza's,\r\nfor whichever of the Hungarian politicians might have been at the head\r\nof the Cabinet he would have adopted the same standpoint.\r\n\r\nI sent at that time a confidential messenger to Tisza enjoining him to\r\nexplain the situation and begging him in my name to make the\r\nconcession. Tisza treated the messenger with great reserve, and wrote\r\nme a letter stating once for all that the voluntary cession of\r\nHungarian territory was out of the question; \"whoever attempts to\r\nseize even one square metre of Hungarian soil will be shot.\"\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done. And still I think that this was one of\r\nthe most important phases of the war, which, had it been properly\r\nmanaged, might have influenced the final result. The military advance\r\non the flank of the Russian army would have been, in the opinion of\r\nour military chiefs, an advantage not to be despised, and through it\r\nthe clever break through at Görlitz would have had some results; but\r\nas it was, Görlitz was a strategical trial of strength without any\r\nlasting effect.\r\n\r\nThe repellent attitude adopted by Hungary may be accounted for in two\r\nways: the Hungarians, to begin with, were averse to giving up any of\r\ntheir own territory, and, secondly, they did not believe--even to the\r\nvery last--that Roumania would remain permanently neutral or that\r\nsooner or later we would be forced to fight _against_ Roumania unless\r\nwe in good time carried her with us. In this connection Tisza always\r\nmaintained his optimism, and to the very last moment held to the\r\nbelief that Roumania would not dare take it upon herself to attack us.\r\nThis is the only reason that explains why the Roumanians surprised us\r\nso much by their invasion of Transylvania and by being able to carry\r\noff so much rich booty. I would have been able to take much better\r\ncare of the many Austrians and Hungarians living in Roumania--whose\r\nfate was terrible after the declaration of war, which took them also\r\nby surprise--if I had been permitted to draw their attention more\r\nopenly and generally to the coming catastrophe; but in several of his\r\nletters Tisza implored me not to create a panic, \"which would bring\r\nincalculable consequences with it.\" As I neither did, nor could, know\r\nhow far this secrecy was in agreement with our military\r\ncounter-preparations, I was bound to observe it. Apparently, Burian\r\nbelieved my reports to a certain extent; at any rate, for some time\r\nbefore the declaration of war he ordered all the secret documents and\r\nthe available money to be conveyed to Vienna, and entrusted to Holland\r\nthe care of our citizens; but Tisza told me long after that he\r\nconsidered my reports of too pessimistic a tendency, and was afraid to\r\ngive orders for the _superfluous_ evacuation of Transylvania.\r\n\r\nAfter the unexpected invasion, the waves of panic and rage ran high in\r\nthe Hungarian Parliament. The severest criticism was heaped upon me,\r\nas no one doubted that the lack of preparation was due to my false\r\nreports. Here Tisza was again himself when, in a loud voice, he\r\nshouted out that it was untrue; my reports were correct; I had warned\r\nthem in time and no blame could be attached to me; he thus took upon\r\nhimself the just blame. Fear was unknown to him, and he never tried to\r\nshield himself behind anyone. When I arrived back in Vienna after a\r\njourney of some weeks in Russia, and only then heard of the incident,\r\nI took the opportunity to thank Tisza for the honourable and loyal\r\nmanner in which he had defended my cause. He replied with the ironical\r\nsmile characteristic of him that it was simply a matter of course.\r\n\r\nBut for an Austro-Hungarian official it was by no means such a matter\r\nof course. We have had so many cowards on the Ministerial benches, so\r\nmany men who were brave when dealing with their subordinates, toadied\r\nto their superiors, and were intimidated by strong opposition, that a\r\nman like Tisza, who was such a contrast to these others, has a most\r\nrefreshing and invigorating effect. The Roumanians attempted several\r\ntimes to make the maintenance of their _neutrality_ contingent on\r\nterritorial concessions. I was always opposed to this, and at the\r\nBallplatz they were of the same opinion. The Roumanians would have\r\nappropriated these concessions and simply attacked us later to obtain\r\nmore. On the other hand, it seemed to me that to gain _military\r\nco-operation_ a cession of territory would be quite in order, since,\r\nonce in the field, the Roumanians could not draw back and their fate\r\nwould be permanently bound up with ours.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third phase comprises the comparatively short period\r\nbetween our defeat at Luck and the outbreak of the war in Roumania,\r\nand was simply the death throes of neutrality.\r\n\r\nWar was in the air and could be foreseen with certainty.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the inefficient diplomacy displayed in the\r\npreparations for the world war brought down severe criticism of our\r\ndiplomatic abilities, and if the intention at the Ballplatz was to\r\nbring about a war, it cannot be denied that the preparations for it\r\nwere most inadequate.\r\n\r\nCriticism was not directed towards the Ballplatz only, but entered\r\ninto further matters, such as the qualifications of the individual\r\nrepresentatives in foreign countries. I remember an article in one of\r\nthe most widely-read Viennese papers, which drew a comparison between\r\nthe \"excellent\" ambassador at Sofia and almost all of the others; that\r\nis, all those whose posts were in countries that either refused their\r\nco-operation or even already were in the field against us.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent any misunderstanding, I wish to state here that in\r\nmy opinion our then ambassador to Sofia, Count Tarnowski, was one of\r\nthe best and most competent diplomats in Austria-Hungary, but that the\r\npoint of view from which such praise was awarded to him was in itself\r\ntotally false. Had Count Tarnowski been in Paris, London or Rome,\r\nthese states, in spite of his undeniable capabilities, would not have\r\nadopted a different attitude; while, on the other hand, there are\r\nnumbers of distinguished members of the diplomatic corps who would\r\nhave carried out his task at Sofia just as well as Count Tarnowski.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I consider it is making an unwarrantable demand to\r\nexpect that a representative in a foreign land should have a leading\r\ninfluence on the policy of the state to which he is accredited. What\r\nmay be demanded of a diplomatic representative is a correct estimate\r\nof the situation. The ambassador must know what the Government of the\r\nstate where he is will do. A false diagnosis is discreditable. But it\r\nis impossible for a representative, whoever he may be, to obtain such\r\npower over a foreign state as to be able to guide the policy of that\r\nstate into the course desired by him. The policy of a state will\r\ninvariably be subservient to such objects as the Government of that\r\nperiod deem vital, and will always be influenced by factors which are\r\nquite outside the range of the foreign representative.\r\n\r\nIn what manner a diplomatic representative obtains his information is\r\nhis own affair. He should endeavour to establish intercourse, not only\r\nwith a certain class of society, but also with the Press, and also\r\nkeep in touch with other classes of the population.\r\n\r\nOne of the reproaches made to the \"old régime\" was the assumed\r\npreference for aristocrats in diplomacy. This was quite a mistake. No\r\npreference was shown for the aristocracy, but it lay in the nature of\r\nthe career that wealth and social polish were assets in the exercise\r\nof its duties. An attaché had no salary. He was, therefore, expected\r\nto have a tolerably good income at home in order to be able to live\r\nconformably to his rank when abroad. This system arose out of\r\nnecessity, and was also due to the unwillingness of the authorities to\r\nraise salaries in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The consequence\r\nwas that only sons of wealthy parents could adopt such a career. I\r\nonce told some delegates who interviewed me in connection with the\r\nsubject that a change of the system depended entirely on themselves\r\nand their increased munificence.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of social polish was just as necessary for diplomats\r\nof the old régime as was the requisite allowance for their household\r\nand a knowledge of foreign languages. So long as courts exist in\r\nEurope, the court will always be the centre of all social life, and\r\ndiplomats must have the entrée to such circles. A young man who does\r\nnot know whether to eat with his fork or his knife would play a sorry\r\npart there--his social training is not an indifferent matter.\r\nPreference is, therefore, not given to the aristocracy, but to young\r\nmen of wealth familiar with European society etiquette.\r\n\r\nThat does not mean that a diplomat is to consider it his duty only to\r\nshow himself at all the parties and fêtes given by the upper ten\r\nthousand, but it is one of his duties, as at such places he might gain\r\ninformation unobtainable elsewhere. A diplomat must be in touch with\r\nall sources from which he can glean information.\r\n\r\nIndividual capabilities and zeal will naturally play a great part; but\r\nthe means that a Government places at the disposition of its foreign\r\nmissions are also of the highest importance.\r\n\r\nThere are people in the East--I do not know whether to say in\r\ncontradistinction to the West--who are not immune to the influence of\r\ngold. In Roumania, for instance, Russia, before the war, had\r\ncompletely undermined the whole country and had lavished millions long\r\nbefore the war in the hope of an understanding with that country. Most\r\nof the newspapers were financed by Russians, and numbers of the\r\nleading politicians were bound by Russian interests, whereas neither\r\nGermany nor Austria-Hungary had made any such preparations. Thus it\r\nhappened that, on the outbreak of war, Russia was greatly in advance\r\nof the Central Powers, an advance that was all the more difficult to\r\novertake as from the first day of war Russia opened still wider the\r\nfloodgates of her gold and inundated Roumania with roubles.\r\n\r\nIf the fact that the scanty preparation for war is a proof of how\r\nlittle the Central Powers reckoned on such a contingency it may on the\r\nother hand explain away much apparent inactivity on the part of their\r\nrepresentatives. Karl Fürstenberg, my predecessor at Bucharest, whose\r\nestimate of the situation was a just one, demanded to have more funds\r\nat his disposal, which was refused at Vienna on the plea that there\r\nwas no money. After the war began the Ministry stinted us no longer,\r\nbut it was too late then for much to be done.\r\n\r\nWhether official Russia, four weeks in advance, had really counted on\r\nthe assassination of the Archduke and the outbreak of a war ensuing\r\ntherefrom remains an open question. I will not go so far as to assert\r\nit for a fact, but one thing is certain, that Russia within a\r\nmeasurable space of time had prepared for war as being inevitable and\r\nhad endeavoured to secure Roumania's co-operation. When the Tsar was\r\nat Constanza a month before the tragedy at Sarajevo, his Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, Sassonoff, paid a visit to Bucharest. When there, he\r\nand Bratianu went on a walking tour together to Transylvania. I did\r\nnot hear of this tactless excursion until it was over, but I shared\r\nBerchtold's surprise at such a proceeding on the part of both\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\nI once, in 1914, overheard by chance a conversation between two\r\nRussians. It was at the Hotel Capsa, known later as a resort for\r\nanti-Austrians. They were sitting at the table next to mine in the\r\nrestaurant and were speaking French quite freely and openly. They\r\nappeared to be on good terms with the Russian Ambassador and were\r\ndiscussing the impending visit of the Tsar to Constanza. I discovered\r\nlater that they were officers in mufti. They agreed that the Emperor\r\nFrancis Joseph could not live very much longer, and that when his\r\ndeath occurred and a new ruler came to the throne It would be a\r\nfavourable moment for Russia to declare war on us.\r\n\r\nThey were evidently exponents of the \"loyal\" tendency that aimed at\r\ndeclaring war on us without a preceding murder; and I readily believe\r\nthat the majority of the men in Petersburg who were eager for war held\r\nthe same view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE U-BOAT WARFARE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nMy appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs was thought by many to\r\nindicate that the Emperor Charles was carrying out the political\r\nwishes of his uncle, Ferdinand. Although it had been the Archduke's\r\nintention to have made me his Minister for Foreign Affairs, my\r\nappointment to the post by the Emperor Charles had nothing to do with\r\nthat plan. It was due, above all, to his strong desire to get rid of\r\nCount Burian and to the lack of other candidates whom he considered\r\nsuitable. The Red Book that was published by Count Burian after the\r\noutbreak of war with Roumania may have attracted the Emperor's\r\nattention to me.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Emperor, while still Archduke, was for several years my\r\nnearest neighbour in Bohemia--he was stationed at Brandeis, on the\r\nElbe--we never became more closely acquainted. In all those years he\r\nwas not more than once or twice at my house, and they were visits of\r\nno political significance. It was not until the first winter of the\r\nwar, when I went from Roumania to the Headquarters at Teschen, that\r\nthe then Archduke invited me to make the return journey with him.\r\nDuring this railway journey that lasted several hours politics formed\r\nthe chief subject of conversation, though chiefly concerning Roumania\r\nand the Balkan questions. In any case I was never one of those who\r\nwere in the Archduke's confidence, and my call to the Ballplatz came\r\nas a complete surprise.\r\n\r\nAt my first audience, too, we conversed at great length on Roumania\r\nand on the question whether the war with Bucharest could have been\r\naverted or not.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was then still under the influence of our first peace\r\noffer so curtly rejected by the Entente. At the German Headquarters at\r\nPless, where I arrived a few days later, I found the prevailing\r\natmosphere largely influenced by the Entente's answer. Hindenburg and\r\nLudendorff, who were apparently opposed to Burian's _démarche_ for\r\npeace, merely remarked to me that a definite victory presented a\r\npossibility of ending the war, and the Emperor William said that he\r\nhad offered his hand in peace but that the Entente had given him a\r\nslap in the face, and there was nothing for it now but war to the\r\nuttermost.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the question of the unrestricted U-boat\r\nwarfare began to be mooted. At first it was the German Navy only, and\r\nTirpitz in particular, who untiringly advocated the plan.\r\nHohenlohe,[5] who, thanks to his excellent connections, was always\r\nvery well informed, wrote, several weeks before the fateful decision\r\nwas taken, that the German Navy was determined and bent on that aim.\r\nBethmann and Zimmermann were both decidedly against it. It was\r\nentirely in keeping with the prudent wisdom of the former not to risk\r\nsuch experiments; Bethmann was an absolutely dependable, honourable\r\nand capable partner, but the unbounded growth of the military\r\nautocracy must be imputed to his natural tendency to conciliate. He\r\nwas powerless against Ludendorff and little by little was turned aside\r\nby him. My first visit to Berlin afforded me the opportunity of\r\nthoroughly discussing the U-boat question with the Imperial\r\nChancellor, and we were quite agreed in our disapproval of that method\r\nof warfare. At all events, Bethmann pointed out that such essentially\r\nmilitary matters should in the first instance be left to military\r\ndecision, as they alone were able to form a correct estimate of the\r\nresult, and these reflections made me fear from the very first that\r\nall reasonable political scruples would be upset by military\r\narguments. On this my first visit to Berlin, when this question\r\nnaturally was the dominating one, the Chancellor explained to me how\r\ndifficult his position was, because the military leaders, both on land\r\nand at sea, declared that if the unrestricted U-boat warfare were not\r\ncarried out they would not be able to guarantee the Western front.\r\nThey thus brought an iron pressure to bear on him, for how could he,\r\nthe Chancellor, undertake to guarantee that the Western front could\r\nhold out? As a matter of fact, the danger of introducing the\r\nunrestricted U-boat campaign became greater and greater, and the\r\nreports sent by Hohenlohe left no doubt as to the further development\r\nof affairs in Berlin.\r\n\r\nOn January 12 he reported as follows:\r\n\r\n  The question of the extension of the U-boat warfare, as Your\r\n  Excellency is aware from the last discussions in Berlin, becomes\r\n  daily more acute.\r\n\r\n  On the one hand, all leading military and naval authorities insist\r\n  on making use of this means as speedily as possible, as they\r\n  declare it will end the war much more rapidly; on the other hand,\r\n  all statesmen have grave fears as to what effect it will have on\r\n  America and other neutrals.\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Military Command declares that a new offensive on a\r\n  very large scale is imminent in the West and that the armies which\r\n  are to resist this attack will not be able to understand why the\r\n  navy should not do all that lies in its power to prevent, or at\r\n  any rate to decrease, the reserves and ammunition being sent to\r\n  our adversaries. The absence of co-operation on the part of the\r\n  navy in the terrible battles the troops on the Western front will\r\n  again have to face will have a most _injurious_ effect on their\r\n  _moral_.\r\n\r\n  The objections put forward as to the effect the proceeding might\r\n  have on America are met in military circles by the assumption that\r\n  America will take good care not to go to war; that she, in fact,\r\n  would not be able to do so. The unfortunate failure of the United\r\n  States military machine in the conflict with Mexico clearly proves\r\n  what is to be expected from America in that respect. Even a\r\n  possible breaking off relations with America does not necessarily\r\n  signify war.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile all the leading naval authorities reassert that they may\r\n  be relied on, even though they are not considered capable of\r\n  crushing England, at least to be able, _before_ America can come\r\n  in, so to weaken the British Island Empire that only one desire\r\n  will be left to English politicians, that of seating themselves\r\n  with us at the Conference table.\r\n\r\n  To this the Chancellor asked who would give him a guarantee that\r\n  the navy was right and in what position should we find ourselves\r\n  in case the admirals were mistaken, whereupon the Admiralty\r\n  promptly asked what sort of position the Chancellor expected to\r\n  find when autumn arrived without having made a proper use of the\r\n  U-boats and we found ourselves, through exhaustion, compelled to\r\n  _beg_ for peace.\r\n\r\n  And thus the scales went up and down, weighing the chances for or\r\n  against the U-boat war, and there was no possibility of positively\r\n  determining which decision was the right one.\r\n\r\n  Doubtless the German Government in the near future will be\r\n  constrained to take up a definite standpoint respecting the\r\n  question, and it is obvious--whatever the decision may be--that we\r\n  also shall be largely involved. Nevertheless, it appears to me\r\n  that when the German Government does approach us in that\r\n  connection we should act with all possible reserve. As the matter\r\n  now stands, a positive decision as to which course is the right\r\n  one is not possible. I have, therefore, thought it inadvisable to\r\n  take side definitely with either party and thus remove much of the\r\n  responsibility from the German Government and render it possible\r\n  for them to lay it upon us.\r\n\r\n  The Imperial and Royal Ambassador,\r\n\r\n  G. HOHENLOHE, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe concluding passage of the above cited report had already been\r\nanticipated by me in a telegraphic communication in which I begged the\r\nambassador with all possible energy to urge the political arguments\r\nopposed to the unrestricted U-boat warfare, which is proved by a\r\ntelegram from Hohenlohe on January 13 as follows:\r\n\r\n  Reply to yesterday's telegram No. 15.\r\n\r\n  In accordance with the telegram mentioned, and after discussing it\r\n  with Baron Flotow, I went to the Secretary of State--not being\r\n  able to see the Chancellor to-day--and in conformity with Your\r\n  Excellency's intentions called his attention to the fact that we\r\n  should participate in the results of the U-boat war just as much\r\n  as Germany and that, therefore, the German Government is bound to\r\n  listen to us also. All the leading German statesmen know that Your\r\n  Excellency, during your stay here, expressed _yourself as opposed\r\n  to the movement_, but that I had come once more as Your\r\n  Excellency's representative to repeat the _warning against too\r\n  hasty action_. I further emphasised all the arguments against the\r\n  U-boat warfare, but will not trouble Your Excellency with a\r\n  repetition of them, nor yet with the counter-arguments, already\r\n  known to Your Excellency, that were put forward by the Secretary.\r\n  I gave a brief summary of both these standpoints in my yesterday's\r\n  report No. 6 P.\r\n\r\n  Herr Zimmermann, however, laid special stress on the fact that the\r\n  information he was receiving convinced him more and more that\r\n  America, especially after the Entente's answer to Mr. Wilson,\r\n  which was in the nature of an insult, would very probably not\r\n  allow it to come to a breach with the Central Powers.\r\n\r\n  I did all I possibly could to impress upon him the responsibility\r\n  Germany was taking for herself and for us by her decision in this\r\n  question, pointing out very particularly that before any decision\r\n  was arrived at our opinion from a nautical-technical standpoint\r\n  must also be heard, in which the Secretary of State fully\r\n  concurred.\r\n\r\n  I have the feeling that the idea of carrying out the U-boat\r\n  warfare is more and more favourably received, and Your Excellency\r\n  had the same impression also when in Berlin. The last word as to\r\n  the final attitude to be adopted by the German Government will no\r\n  doubt come from the military side.\r\n\r\n  In conformity with the instructions received, _I will nevertheless\r\n  uphold with all firmness the political arguments against the\r\n  U-boat warfare_.\r\n\r\n  Baron Flotow will have occasion to meet the Secretary of State\r\n  this afternoon.\r\n\r\nI had sent Baron Flotow, a Chief of Department, to Berlin at the same\r\ntime, in order that he might support all Hohenlohe's efforts and spare\r\nno pains to induce Germany to desist from her purpose.\r\n\r\nFlotow sent me the following report on January 15:\r\n\r\n  After a two-days' stay in Berlin my impression is that the\r\n  question of the unrestricted U-boat warfare has again been brought\r\n  to the front by the leading men in the German Empire. This\r\n  question--according to Herr Zimmermann--under conditions of the\r\n  greatest secrecy where the public is concerned, is now under\r\n  debate between the heads of the Army and Navy and the Foreign\r\n  Office; they insist on a decision. For if the unrestricted U-boat\r\n  warfare is to be opened it must be at a time when, in view of the\r\n  vast impending Anglo-French offensive on the Western front, it\r\n  will make itself felt. The Secretary of State mentioned the month\r\n  of February.\r\n\r\n  I wish in the following account to summarise the reasons put\r\n  forward by the Germans for the justification of the unrestricted\r\n  U-boat warfare:\r\n\r\n  Time is against us and favours the Entente; if, therefore, the\r\n  Entente can keep up the desire for war there will be still less\r\n  prospect of our obtaining a peace on our own terms. The enemy's\r\n  last Note to Wilson is again a striking example of their war\r\n  energy.\r\n\r\n  It will be impossible for the Central Powers to continue the war\r\n  after 1917 with any prospect of success. Peace must, therefore,\r\n  unless it finally has to be proposed by the enemy, be secured in\r\n  the course of this year, which means that we must enforce it.\r\n\r\n  The military situation is unfavourable owing to the impending\r\n  Anglo-French offensive, which, it is presumed, will open with\r\n  great force, as in the case of the last offensive on the Somme. To\r\n  meet the attack, troops will have to be withdrawn from other\r\n  fronts. Consequently, an offensive against Russia with intent to\r\n  bring that enemy to his knees, which perhaps a year ago would have\r\n  been possible, can no longer be reckoned on.\r\n\r\n  If, therefore, the possibility of enforcing a decision in the East\r\n  becomes less and less, an effort must be made to bring it about in\r\n  the West, and to do it at a time when the unrestricted U-boat\r\n  warfare would affect the coming Anglo-French offensive by impeding\r\n  the transport of troops and munitions sailing under a neutral\r\n  flag.\r\n\r\n  In estimating the effect on England of the unrestricted U-boat\r\n  warfare, there will be not only the question of hindering the\r\n  transport of provisions, but also of curtailing the traffic to\r\n  such a degree as would render it impossible for the English to\r\n  continue the war. In Italy and in France this will be felt no less\r\n  severely. The neutrals, too, will be made to suffer, which,\r\n  however, might serve as a pretext to bring about peace.\r\n\r\n  America will hardly push matters further than breaking off\r\n  diplomatic relations; we need not, therefore, count for certain on\r\n  a war with the United States.\r\n\r\n  It must not be overlooked that the United States--as was the case\r\n  in regard to Mexico--are not well prepared for war, that their one\r\n  anxiety is Japan. Japan would not allow a European war with\r\n  America to pass unheeded.\r\n\r\n  But even if America were to enter the war it would be three to\r\n  four months before she could be ready, and in that space of time\r\n  peace must have been secured in Europe. According to the estimate\r\n  of certain experts (among others, some Dutch corn merchants),\r\n  England has only provisions sufficient for six weeks, or three\r\n  months at the outside.\r\n\r\n  It would be possible to carry on the U-boat warfare on England\r\n  from fifteen bases in the North Sea, so _that the passage of a\r\n  large vessel through to England would be hardly conceivable_.\r\n  Traffic in the Channel, even if not entirely stopped, would be\r\n  very limited, as travelling conditions in France exclude the\r\n  possibility of suitable connection.\r\n\r\n  And if the unrestricted U-boat warfare once were started, the\r\n  terror caused by it (the sinking of the vessels without warning)\r\n  would have such an effect that most vessels would not dare to put\r\n  to sea.\r\n\r\n  The above already hints at the rejoinder to be put forward to the\r\n  arguments advanced by us against the opening of the unrestricted\r\n  U-boat warfare, and also combats the view that the corn supply\r\n  from the Argentine is not at the present moment so important for\r\n  the United States as would be a prompt opening of the U-boat\r\n  campaign, which would mean a general stoppage of all traffic.\r\n\r\n  The fact that America would not be ready for war before the end of\r\n  three months does not exclude the possibility that it might even\r\n  be as long as six or eight months, and that she therefore might\r\n  join in the European war at a time when, without playing our last\r\n  card, it might be possible to end it in a manner that we could\r\n  accept. It must not be forgotten, however, that in America we have\r\n  to do with an Anglo-Saxon race, which--once it had decided on\r\n  war--will enter on it with energy and tenacity, as England did,\r\n  who, though unprepared for war as to military matters, can\r\n  confront to-day the Germans with an army of millions that commands\r\n  respect. I cannot with certainty make any statement as to the\r\n  Japanese danger to America at a time when Japan is bound up with\r\n  Russia and England through profitable treaties and Germany is shut\r\n  out from that part of the world.\r\n\r\n  Among other things I referred to the great hopes entertained of\r\n  the Zeppelins as an efficient weapon of war.\r\n\r\n  Herr Zimmermann said to me: \"Believe me, our fears are no less\r\n  than yours; they have given me many sleepless nights. There is no\r\n  positive certainty as to the result; we can only make our\r\n  calculations. We have not yet arrived at any decision. Show me a\r\n  way to obtain a reasonable peace and I would be the first to\r\n  reject the idea of the U-boat warfare. As matters now stand, both\r\n  I and several others have almost been converted to it.\"\r\n\r\n  But whether, in the event of the ruthless U-boat warfare being\r\n  decided on, it would be notified in some way, has not yet been\r\n  decided.\r\n\r\n  Zimmermann told me he was considering the advisability of\r\n  approaching Wilson, and, while referring to the contemptuous\r\n  attitude of the Entente in the peace question, give the President\r\n  an explanation of the behaviour of the German Government, and\r\n  request him, for the safety of the life and property of American\r\n  citizens, to indicate the steamers and shipping lines by which\r\n  traffic between America and other neutrals could be maintained.\r\n\r\n  _Vienna, January 15, 1917._\r\n\r\n  FLOTOW, M.P.\r\n\r\nOn January 20 Zimmermann and Admiral Holtzendorff arrived in Vienna,\r\nand a council was held, presided over by the Emperor. Besides the\r\nthree above-mentioned, Count Tisza, Count Clam-Martinic, Admiral Haus\r\nand I were also present. Holtzendorff expounded his reasons, which I\r\nrecapitulate below. With the exception of Admiral Haus, no one gave\r\nunqualified consent. All the arguments which appear in the official\r\ndocuments and ministerial protocols were advanced but did not make the\r\nslightest impression on the German representatives. The Emperor, who\r\ntook no part in the debate, finally declared that he would decide\r\nlater. Under his auspices a further conference was held in the\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs at 2 o'clock; the report is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Report of a conference held January 20, 1917, in the Imperial and\r\n  Royal Ministry of Home and Foreign Affairs. Members: Dr.\r\n  Zimmermann, Secretary of State of the German Foreign Affairs\r\n  Department; Admiral von Holtzendorff, Chief of the German Naval\r\n  Staff; Count Czernin, Imperial and Royal Minister for Foreign\r\n  Affairs; Count Tisza, Royal Hungarian Prime Minister; Count\r\n  Clam-Martinic, Imperial and Royal Prime Minister; Admiral Haus,\r\n  the German naval attaché in Vienna; Baron von Freyburg, the\r\n  Imperial and Royal naval attaché in Berlin; Count B.\r\n  Colloredo-Mannsfeld.\r\n\r\n  On January 20 a discussion took place in the Ministry of Foreign\r\n  Affairs on the question of establishing unrestricted U-boat\r\n  warfare.\r\n\r\n  As evidenced by Admiral v. Holtzendorff's statements, the German\r\n  naval authorities hold the standpoint that there exists an\r\n  absolute necessity for the quickest possible inauguration of an\r\n  unrestricted U-boat campaign. The arguments employed in support of\r\n  this thesis are known from the reports of the Imperial and Royal\r\n  Ambassador in Berlin (report of 12/1/17 Nr. 6/P, and telegram of\r\n  13/1 Nr. 22), and may be summarised in the following sentences:\r\n  Lack of time, decreasing human material in the Central Powers,\r\n  progressive deterioration of the harvest, impending Anglo-French\r\n  offensive on the Western front with improved and increased means\r\n  for fighting, and the necessity arising therefrom to prevent or at\r\n  least check the reinforcements required for such undertaking, the\r\n  impossibility of obtaining a decision on land, the necessity of\r\n  raising the _moral_ of the troops by ruthlessly obtained results\r\n  and the use of every available means in war, certainty of the\r\n  success of an unrestricted U-boat warfare in view of provisions\r\n  in England only being sufficient for two to three months, as well\r\n  as the stoppage of the munitions output and industrial production\r\n  owing to the lack of raw material, the impossibility of supplying\r\n  coal to France and Italy, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n  Concerning the carrying out of the plan, the German Navy owns at\r\n  present for that purpose 120 U-boats of the latest type. In view\r\n  of the great success achieved by the U-boats at the beginning of\r\n  the war, when there were only 19 of an antiquated type, the\r\n  present increased numbers of the vessels offer a safe guarantee of\r\n  success.\r\n\r\n  February 1 is suggested on the part of the Germans as the date on\r\n  which to start the unrestricted U-boat warfare and also to\r\n  announce the blockade of the English coast and the west coast of\r\n  France. Every vessel disobeying the order will be torpedoed\r\n  without warning. In this manner it is hoped to bring England to\r\n  reason within four months, and it must here be added that Admiral\r\n  von Holtzendorff _expressis verbis_ guaranteed the results.\r\n\r\n  As regards the attitude to be taken by the neutrals, leading\r\n  German circles, although aware of the danger, hold optimistic\r\n  views. It is not thought that either the Scandinavian countries or\r\n  Holland will interfere with us, although, in view of the\r\n  possibility of such happening, military precautions have been\r\n  taken. The measures taken on the Dutch and Danish frontiers will,\r\n  in the opinion of the Germans, hold those countries in check, and\r\n  the possibility of sharing the fate of Roumania will frighten\r\n  them. Indeed, it is expected that there will be a complete\r\n  stoppage of all neutral shipping, which in the matter of supplies\r\n  for England amounts to 39 per cent. of the cargo space. Meanwhile\r\n  concessions will be granted to the neutrals by fixing a time limit\r\n  for the withdrawal of such of their vessels as may be at sea on\r\n  the opening day of the U-boat warfare.\r\n\r\n  With regard to America, the Germans are determined, if at all\r\n  possible, to prevent the United States from attacking the Central\r\n  Powers by adopting a friendly attitude towards America (acting\r\n  upon the proposals made at the time of the _Lusitania_ incident),\r\n  but they are prepared for and await with calmness whatever\r\n  attitude America may adopt. The Germans are, nevertheless, of the\r\n  opinion that the United States will not go so far as making a\r\n  breach with the Central Powers. If that should occur, America\r\n  would be too late and could only come into action after England\r\n  had been beaten. America is not prepared for war, which was\r\n  clearly shown at the time of the Mexican crisis; she lives in fear\r\n  of Japan and has to fight against agricultural and social\r\n  difficulties. Besides which, Mr. Wilson is a pacifist, and the\r\n  Germans presume that after his election he will adopt a still\r\n  more decided tendency that way, for his election will not be due\r\n  to the anti-German Eastern States, but to the co-operation of the\r\n  Central and Western States that are opposed to war, and to the\r\n  Irish and Germans. These considerations, together with the\r\n  Entente's insulting answer to President Wilson's peace proposal,\r\n  do not point to the probability of America plunging readily into\r\n  war.\r\n\r\n  These, in brief, are the points of view on which the German demand\r\n  for the immediate start of the unrestricted U-boat warfare is\r\n  based, and which caused the Imperial Chancellor and the Foreign\r\n  Affairs Department to revise their hitherto objective views.\r\n\r\n  Both the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Hungarian\r\n  Prime Minister pointed out what disastrous consequences would\r\n  ensue from America's intervention, in a military, moral,\r\n  agricultural and financial sense, and great doubt was expressed of\r\n  the success of a blockade of England. Count Czernin held that the\r\n  Germans overlooked the possibility of lowering the consumption in\r\n  England, taking into consideration the fact that since the war\r\n  consumption in the countries of the Central Powers had been\r\n  reduced by half. Further, Count Czernin referred to the very vague\r\n  and by no means convincing data of the German naval authorities.\r\n  It was also debated whether a continuation of the U-boat war to\r\n  the present extent (the destruction on an average of 400,000 tons\r\n  per month) would not be more likely to achieve the desired end,\r\n  and if it were not more advisable not to play our last and best\r\n  card until all other means had been tried. The possibility of\r\n  being able to start a ruthless U-boat warfare hung like a\r\n  Damocles' sword over the heads of our adversaries, and would\r\n  perhaps be a more effectual means of ending the war than the\r\n  reckless use of the U-boat as a weapon of war, carrying with it\r\n  the danger of an attack by the neutrals. If the effect expected by\r\n  Germany was not realised, which was within the bounds of\r\n  possibility, we must be prepared to see the desire for war in the\r\n  enemy greatly intensified. However that may be, the vanishing of\r\n  the desire for peace must be accepted as an established fact.\r\n  Finally, it was pointed out that the arguments recently put\r\n  forward by the Germans show a complete _novum_, namely, the danger\r\n  on the Western front in view of the great Anglo-French offensive\r\n  that is expected. Whereas formerly it was always said that the\r\n  attacks of the enemy would be repulsed, it is now considered\r\n  necessary to relieve the land army by recklessly bringing the navy\r\n  into the line of action. If these fears are justified, then most\r\n  certainly should all other considerations be put on one side and\r\n  the risk ensuing from the ruthless employment of the U-boats be\r\n  accepted. Both Count Czernin and Count Tisza expressed their\r\n  grave doubts in this connection.\r\n\r\n  To meet the case, the Hungarian Prime Minister pointed out the\r\n  necessity of immediately starting propagandist activities in the\r\n  neutral countries and particularly in America, by which the\r\n  Central Powers' political methods and aims would be presented to\r\n  them in a proper light; and then later, after introducing\r\n  unrestricted U-boat warfare, it would be seen that no other choice\r\n  was left to the peaceful tendencies of the Quadruple Alliance as\r\n  the means for a speedy ending of the struggle between the nations.\r\n\r\n  The leaders of the foreign policy agreed to take the necessary\r\n  steps in that direction, and remarked that certain arrangements\r\n  had already been made.\r\n\r\n  Admiral Haus agreed _unreservedly_ with the arguments of the\r\n  German Navy, as he declared that _no great anxiety need be felt_\r\n  as to the likelihood of America's joining in with military force,\r\n  and finally pointed out that, on the part of the Entente, a\r\n  ruthless torpedoing of hospital and transport ships had been\r\n  practised for some time past in the Adriatic. The Admiral urged\r\n  that this fact be properly recognised and dealt with, to which the\r\n  Foreign Affairs leaders on both sides gave their consent.\r\n\r\n  The Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in conclusion, said\r\n  that the definite decision to be taken must be left to the\r\n  conclusions arrived at by both sovereigns, whereupon the 26th\r\n  inst. was fixed for a meeting to be held for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter the general discussion, I had a private talk with the Emperor,\r\nand found that he still had the same aversion to that means of warfare\r\nand the same fears as to the result. We knew, however, that Germany\r\nhad definitely made up her mind to start the campaign in any case, and\r\nthat all our arguments would be of no practical value. It remained to\r\nbe decided whether we should join them or not. Owing to the small\r\nnumber of our U-boats, our holding aside would not have had any great\r\neffect on the final issue of the experiment, and for a moment I\r\nentertained the idea of proposing to the Emperor that we should\r\nseparate from Germany on that one point, although I was aware that it\r\nmight lead to the ending of our alliance. But the difficulty was that\r\nthe U-boat effort would also have to be carried on in the\r\nMediterranean in order that it should not lose its effect in the\r\nNorth Sea. If the Mediterranean remained exempt, the transports would\r\ntake that route and proceed by land via Italy, France, and Dover, and\r\nthus render the northern U-boat warfare of no effect. But in order to\r\ncarry it on in the Mediterranean, Germany would need our support in\r\nthe Adriatic from Trieste, Pola, and Cattaro. If we allowed her at\r\nthose places it involved us in the campaign, and if we refused to let\r\nour few U-boats go out, it would be attacking Germany in the rear and\r\nwe should become embroiled with her, which would lead to the definite\r\nseverance of the Alliance.\r\n\r\nThis was again one of those instances that prove that when a strong\r\nand a weak nation concert in war, the weak one cannot desist unless it\r\nchanges sides entirely and enters into war with its former ally. None\r\nwho were in the Government would hear of that, and with a heavy heart\r\nwe gave our consent. Bulgaria, who was not affected by this phase of\r\nthe war, and had kept up diplomatic relations with America, was\r\ndifferently situated, being able to stand aside without paralysing the\r\nGerman plans. Apart from this, I was already persuaded then that\r\nBulgaria's not joining in would make a bad impression on the outside\r\nworld, and would not help her in any way. Although her relations with\r\nAmerica were maintained up to the last, they did not, as a matter of\r\nfact, make her fate easier.\r\n\r\nHad we been able to make Germany desist from the unrestricted U-boat\r\nwarfare, the advantage would have been very great; whether we joined\r\nin or not was a matter of indifference viewed from the standpoint of\r\nour treatment by the Entente, as is proved by the instance of\r\nBulgaria. As soon as America had declared war on Germany, a conflict\r\nwith us was inevitable in any case, as Austro-Hungarian troops and\r\nartillery were then on the Western front facing Americans. We were\r\ncompelled to go to war with America, seeing that Germany was already\r\nat war with her.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible, therefore, for us to remain in a state of even\r\nnominally peaceful relations with America, such as existed between her\r\nand Bulgaria to the very end of the war.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite clear when Germany really recognised the fact that\r\nthe unrestricted U-boat warfare had no effect, and was thus a terrible\r\nmistake. To the public, as well as to the Allied Cabinets, the German\r\nmilitary authorities continued to profess the greatest optimism, and\r\nwhen I left my post in April, 1918, the standpoint held in Berlin was\r\nstill that England would be defeated by the naval war. Writing on\r\nDecember 14, 1917, Hohenlohe reported that in competent German circles\r\nthe feeling was thoroughly optimistic. I, however, certainly perceived\r\ndefinite signs of doubt beginning in some German minds, and Ludendorff\r\nin replying to the reproaches I made to him said: \"Everything is risky\r\nin war; it is impossible before an operation to be sure of the\r\nresults. I admit that the time limit was a mistake, but the final\r\nresult will show that I was right.\" In order to exculpate themselves\r\nall the leaders in Germany declared that America would, in any case,\r\nhave gone to war, and that the U-boat had merely given the last\r\nimpetus. Whether this is quite true appears doubtful; it cannot either\r\nbe asserted or denied positively.\r\n\r\nThe world has become used to looking upon Hindenburg and Ludendorff as\r\none; they belonged together. Together they rose to highest power, to\r\nbe forcibly separated in their fall. In all business transactions\r\nLudendorff was in the foreground. He was a great speaker, but always\r\nin a sharp tone, suggestive of the Prussian military system. It\r\nusually aroused a scene, but he seemed to take nothing amiss, and his\r\nanger vanished as rapidly as it broke out. Hindenburg's retiring\r\nmodesty made him attractive. Once when we were speaking of the\r\nphotographers who besieged every conference in Berlin, the old\r\ngentleman remarked: \"I have lived to be seventy, and nobody ever\r\nthought there was anything wonderful about me; now they seem all at\r\nonce to have discovered that I have such an interesting head.\" He was\r\nmuch more staid and quiet than Ludendorff, nor was he so sensitive to\r\npublic opinion as the latter. I remember once how Ludendorff, when I\r\nexhorted him to yield on the peace question, rejoined with vigour:\r\n\"The German people wishes for no peace of renunciation, and I do not\r\nintend to end by being pelted with stones. The dynasty would never\r\nsurvive such a peace.\" The dynasty has departed, the stones have been\r\nthrown, and the peace of renunciation has become a reality, and is\r\ncertainly more terrible than the gloomiest pessimist could ever have\r\nbelieved!\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe rupture between America and Germany occurred on February 3, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador, Count Tarnowski, remained in Washington, but was not\r\nreceived by Wilson, and had intercourse with Lansing only. I still\r\nhoped to maintain these semi-official relations with America, in case\r\nAmerica, in breaking off relations with Germany, might be content with\r\nthat and not declare war on her. The German Government would have\r\npreferred our breaking off diplomatic relations simultaneously with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn February 12 Count Wedel called on me, and his request and my\r\nsettlement of it appear in the following telegram to Hohenlohe:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Vienna, Feb. 12, 1917._\r\n\r\n    To notify Your Excellency.\r\n\r\n  Count Wedel has been instructed to submit to me the following\r\n  three requests from his Government:\r\n\r\n  (1) Count Tarnowski is not to hand over his credentials until the\r\n        situation between Germany and America is clear.\r\n\r\n  (2) Count Tarnowski must protest to Mr. Wilson against his having\r\n        tried to make the neutrals turn against Germany.\r\n\r\n  (3) On the outbreak of war with Germany Count Tarnowski must be\r\n        recalled.\r\n\r\n  I have refused the first two items and accepted the last.\r\n\r\nAs we should not have been able to prevent Germany from beginning the\r\nU-boat warfare, the only alternative for us was to use all means in\r\nour power to maintain our relations with America, and thus enable us\r\nlater to play the part of mediator, although this could only be for\r\nthat period during which America, having broken off relations, had not\r\nyet declared war. My answer of March 5, 1917, to America's request\r\nfor an explanation of our standpoint was sent with the object of\r\npreventing America from breaking off relations with us, and also to\r\nkeep from the public the knowledge of our divergence from Germany.\r\nThis will be found noted in the appendix.[6] It met with success so\r\nfar that America continued diplomatic relations with us until April 9,\r\n1917.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNT TISZA. _Photo: Stanley's Press Agency._]\r\n\r\nI had a very lively correspondence with Stephen Tisza in consequence\r\nof my answer. I received the following letter on March 3:\r\n\r\n  DEAR FRIEND,--In the interests of the cause I can only greatly\r\n  regret that I had no opportunity of appreciating the definite\r\n  sense of our _aide-mémoire_ before it was dispatched. Apart from\r\n  other less important matters, I cannot conceal my painful surprise\r\n  that we repeatedly and expressly admit having given a promise in\r\n  our _Ancona_ Note. I am afraid that we have placed ourselves in a\r\n  very awkward position with Wilson, which so easily could have been\r\n  avoided, as it was not in accordance with my views that we had\r\n  given a promise.\r\n\r\n  An expression of opinion is not a promise. Without wishing to\r\n  detract from its moral value, it has nevertheless a different\r\n  legal character, and from the point of view of a third person has\r\n  no legal authority in favour of that person as a promise.\r\n\r\n  By unnecessarily having admitted that we gave the Americans a\r\n  promise we admit the existence of obligations on our side to them.\r\n  In spite of the fine and clever argument in our Note, it will be\r\n  easy for the Americans to prove that our present procedure cannot\r\n  be reconciled with the previous statement; if the statement was a\r\n  promise, then the American Government has the right to look for\r\n  the fulfilment of it, and we will then be in an awkward\r\n  predicament. I remarked in my notification that I would prefer to\r\n  omit the admission that we had made any promise; there would have\r\n  been the possibility of recurring to it. By placing this weapon in\r\n  their hands we have exposed ourselves to the danger of a\r\n  checkmate, and I very much fear that we shall greatly regret it.\r\n\r\n  Naturally this remains between us. But I was constrained to pour\r\n  out my heart to you and justify my request that the text of all\r\n  such important State documents which involve such far-reaching\r\n  consequences may be sent to me in time for me to study and\r\n  comment on them. Believe me, it is really in the interest of the\r\n  cause and in every respect can only be for the best. In sincere\r\n  friendship, your devoted\r\n\r\n  TISZA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Enclosure._\r\n\r\n  It may be presumed with some semblance of truth that the peace\r\n  wave in America is progressing, and that President Wilson,\r\n  influenced thereby, may perhaps be able at any rate to postpone a\r\n  decision of a warlike nature. Even though I may be wrong in my\r\n  presumption, it lies in our interests to avoid for as long as\r\n  possible the rupture of our diplomatic relations with America.\r\n\r\n  Therefore the answer to the American _aide-mémoire_, to be\r\n  dispatched as late as possible, should be so composed as to give\r\n  it the appearance of a meritorious handling of the theme put\r\n  forward on the American side without falling into the trap of the\r\n  question put forward in the _aide-mémoire_.\r\n\r\n  If we answer yes, then President Wilson will hardly be able to\r\n  avoid a breach with the Monarchy. If we give a negative answer we\r\n  shall abandon Germany and the standpoint we took up on January 31.\r\n\r\n  The handle wherewith to grasp evasion of a clear answer is\r\n  provided by the _aide-mémoire_ itself, as it identifies our\r\n  statements in the _Ancona_ and _Persia_ question with the attitude\r\n  of the German Note of May 4, 1916. We should, therefore, be quite\r\n  consistent if we, as we did in our Note of December 14, 1915, were\r\n  to declare that we should be governed by our own ideas of justice.\r\n\r\n  In our correspondence with the American Government respecting the\r\n  _Ancona_, _Persia_ and _Petrolite_ questions we treated the\r\n  concrete case always without going deeper into the individual\r\n  principles of legal questions. In our Note of December 29, 1915,\r\n  which contains the expression of opinion cited in the\r\n  _aide-mémoire_ (it may also be noted that our expression of\r\n  opinion was no pledge, as we had promised nothing nor taken any\r\n  obligation upon ourselves), the Austrian Government distinctly\r\n  stated that they would refer later to the difficult international\r\n  questions connected with the U-boat warfare.\r\n\r\n  Present war conditions did not appear suited to such a discussion.\r\n  In consequence, however, of the dealings of our enemies, events\r\n  have occurred and a state of things been brought about which, on\r\n  our side also, renders a more intense application of the U-boat\r\n  question unavoidable. Our merchantmen in the Adriatic, whenever\r\n  attainable, were constantly torpedoed without warning by the\r\n  enemy. Our adversaries have thus adopted the standard of the most\r\n  aggravated and unrestricted U-boat warfare without the neutrals\r\n  offering any resistance.\r\n\r\n  The Entente when laying their minefields displayed the same\r\n  ruthlessness towards free shipping and the lives of neutrals.\r\n\r\n  Mines are considered as a recognised weapon for the definite\r\n  protection of the home coast and ports, also as a means of\r\n  blockading an enemy port. But the use made of them as an\r\n  aggressive factor in this war is quite a new feature, for vast\r\n  areas of open sea on the route of the world's traffic were\r\n  converted into minefields impassable for the neutrals except at\r\n  the greatest danger of their lives.\r\n\r\n  There is no question but that that is a far greater check to the\r\n  freedom of movement and a greater obstacle to neutral interests\r\n  than establishing the unrestricted U-boat warfare within a limited\r\n  and clearly marked-out zone, leaving open channels for neutral\r\n  shipping, and by other measures giving due consideration to the\r\n  interests of the neutrals.\r\n\r\n  Just at the moment when the President's appeal to the entire\r\n  belligerent world coincided with the spontaneous statement of our\r\n  group, in which we gave a solemn proof of our willingness to\r\n  conclude a just peace and one acceptable by our enemies, a fresh\r\n  and larger minefield was laid down in the North Sea on the route\r\n  of the world's traffic, and, casting ridicule on the noble\r\n  initiative of the United States, a war of destruction against our\r\n  groups of Powers was announced by the Entente.\r\n\r\n  We urge the great aims that inspired the action of the American\r\n  Government: the quickest possible cessation of the fearful\r\n  slaughter of men and the founding of an honourable, lasting and\r\n  blessed peace by combating with the greatest energy our enemies'\r\n  furious war for conquest. The course we pursue leads to the common\r\n  aims of ourselves and the American Government, and we cannot give\r\n  up the hope of finding understanding in the people and the\r\n  Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n  TISZA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI answered as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  _March 5._\r\n\r\n  DEAR FRIEND,--I cannot agree with you. After the first _Ancona_\r\n  Note you veered round and declared in a second Note that \"we\r\n  agreed with the German standpoint in the main\"--that was an\r\n  obvious yielding and contained a hidden promise.\r\n\r\n  I do not think that any legal wiles will dupe the Americans, and\r\n  if we were to deny the promise it would not advance us any\r\n  further.\r\n\r\n  But, secondly and principally, it is altogether impossible with\r\n  words to make the Americans desist from war if they wish it;\r\n  either they will make straight for war and then no Notes will\r\n  avail, or they will seek a pretext to escape the war danger and\r\n  will find it in our Note.\r\n\r\n  So much for the merits of the matter.\r\n\r\n  What you demand is technically impossible. The Note was not easy\r\n  to compile. I had to alter it entirely as time went on; His\r\n  Majesty then wished to see it, made some alterations and\r\n  sanctioned it. Meanwhile Penfield[7] importuned me and telegraphed\r\n  even a week ago to America to reassure his people; the Germans,\r\n  too, had to be won over for that particular passage.\r\n\r\n  You know how ready I am to discuss important matters with you, but\r\n  _ultra posse nemo tenetur_--it was physically impossible to upset\r\n  everything again and to expect His Majesty to alter his views.\r\n\r\n  In true friendship, your\r\n\r\n  CZERNIN.\r\n\r\nI thereupon, on March 14, received the following answer from Tisza:\r\n\r\n  DEAR FRIEND,--I also note with genuine pleasure the success of\r\n  your American _aide-mémoire_ (meaning thereby America's resolve\r\n  not to break off relations with us). But it does not alter my\r\n  opinion that it was a pity to admit that a pledge had been given.\r\n  It may be requited at a later stage of the controversy, and it\r\n  would have been easy not to broach the subject for the moment.\r\n\r\n  Do you think me very obstinate? I have not suppressed the final\r\n  word in our retrospective controversy so that you should not think\r\n  me better than I am.\r\n\r\n  Au revoir, in true friendship, your\r\n\r\n  TISZA.\r\n\r\nTisza was strongly opposed to the U-boat warfare, and only tolerated\r\nit from reasons of _vis major_, because we could not prevent the\r\nGerman military leaders from adopting the measure, and because he, and\r\nI too, were convinced that \"not joining in\" would have been of no\r\nadvantage to us.\r\n\r\nNot until very much later--in fact, not until after the war--did I\r\nlearn from a reliable source that Germany, with an incomprehensible\r\nmisunderstanding of the situation, had restricted the building of more\r\nU-boats during the war. The Secretary of State, Capelle, was\r\napproached by competent naval technical experts, who told him that, by\r\nstopping the building of all other vessels, a fivefold number of\r\nU-boats could be built. Capelle rejected the proposal on the pretext\r\n\"that nobody would know what to do with so many U-boats when the war\r\nwas at an end.\" Germany had, as mentioned, 100 submarines; had she\r\npossessed 500, she might have achieved her aims.\r\n\r\nI only heard this in the winter of 1918, but it was from a source from\r\nwhich I invariably gleaned correct information.\r\n\r\nSeldom has any military action called forth such indignation as the\r\nsinking, without warning, of enemy ships. And yet the observer who\r\njudges from an objective point of view must admit that the waging war\r\non women and children was not begun by us, but by our enemies when\r\nthey enforced the blockade. Millions have perished in the domains of\r\nthe Central Powers through the blockade, and chiefly the poorest and\r\nweakest people--the greater part women and children--were the victims.\r\nIf, to meet the argument, it be asserted that the Central Powers were\r\nas a besieged fortress, and that in 1870 the Germans starved Paris in\r\nsimilar fashion, there is certainly some truth in the argument. But it\r\nis just as true--as stated in the Note of March 5--that in a war on\r\nland no regard is ever paid to civilians who venture into the war\r\nzone, and that no reason is apparent why a war at sea should be\r\nsubject to different moral conditions. When a town or village is\r\nwithin the range of battle, the fact has never prevented the artillery\r\nfrom acting in spite of the danger to the women and children. But in\r\nthe present instance, the non-combatants of the enemy States who are\r\nin danger can easily escape it by not undertaking a sea voyage.\r\n\r\nSince the débâcle in the winter of 1918, I have thoroughly discussed\r\nthe matter with English friends of long standing, and found that their\r\nstandpoint was--that it was not the U-boat warfare in itself that had\r\nroused the greatest indignation, but the cruel nature of the\r\nproceedings so opposed to international law. Also, the torpedoing of\r\nhospital ships by the Germans, and the firing on passengers seeking to\r\nescape, and so on. These accounts are flatly contradicted by the\r\nGermans, who, on their part, have terrible tales to tell of English\r\nbrutality, as instanced by the _Baralong_ episode.\r\n\r\nThere have, of course, been individual cases of shameful brutality in\r\nall the armies; but that such deeds were sanctioned or ordered by the\r\nGerman or English Supreme Commands I do not believe.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry by an international, but neutral, court would be the only\r\nmeans of bringing light to bear on the matter.\r\n\r\nAtrocities such as mentioned are highly to be condemned, no matter who\r\nthe perpetrators are; but in itself, the U-boat warfare was an\r\nallowable means of defence.\r\n\r\nThe blockade is now admitted to be a permissible and necessary\r\nproceeding; the unrestricted U-boat warfare is stigmatised as a crime\r\nagainst international law. That is the sentence passed by might but\r\nnot by right. In days to come history will judge otherwise.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] The Ambassador, Gottfried, Prince Hohenlohe-Schillingsfurst.\r\n\r\n[6] See p. 279.\r\n\r\n[7] Mr. Penfield, American Ambassador to Vienna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nATTEMPTS AT PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nThe constitutional procedure which prevails in every parliamentary\r\nstate is ordered so that the minister is responsible to a body of\r\nrepresentatives. He is obliged to account for what he has done. His\r\naction is subject to the judgment and criticism of the body of\r\nrepresentatives. If the majority of that body are against the\r\nminister, he must go.\r\n\r\nThe control of foreign policy in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was in\r\nthe hands of the delegations.\r\n\r\nBesides which, however, there existed in the Hungarian Constitution a\r\nregulation to the effect that the Hungarian Prime Minister was\r\nresponsible to the country for the foreign policy, and, consequently,\r\nthe \"foreign policy of the Monarchy had to be carried out, in\r\nconjunction, by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in office and\r\nthe Prime Minister.\"\r\n\r\nIt depended entirely on the personality of the Hungarian Prime\r\nMinister how he observed the regulation. Under Burian's régime it had\r\nbecome the custom for all telegrams and news, even of the most secret\r\nnature, to be communicated at once to Count Tisza, who then brought\r\nhis influence to bear on all decisions and tactical events. Tisza\r\npossessed a most extraordinary capacity for work. He always found time\r\nto occupy himself very thoroughly with foreign policy, notwithstanding\r\nhis own numerous departmental duties, and it was necessary, therefore,\r\nto gain his consent to every step taken. The control of our foreign\r\npolicy was, therefore, twofold--both by the delegation and the Prime\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\nGreat as was my esteem and respect for Count Tisza and close the\r\nfriendship between us, still his constant supervision and\r\nintervention put boundless difficulties in the way of the discharge of\r\nbusiness. It was not easy, even in normal times, to contend with, on\r\ntop of all the existing difficulties that confront a Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs; in war, it became an impossibility. The unqualified\r\npresumption behind such twofold government would have been that the\r\nHungarian Prime Minister should consider all questions from the\r\nstandpoint of the entire Monarchy, and not from that of the Magyar\r\ncentre, a presumption which Tisza ignored like all other Hungarians.\r\nHe did not deny it. He has often told me that he knew no patriotism\r\nsave the Hungarian, but that it was in the interests of Hungary to\r\nkeep together with Austria; therefore, he saw most things with a\r\ncrooked vision. Never would he have ceded one single square metre of\r\nHungarian territory; but he raised no objection to the projected\r\ncession of Galicia. He would rather have let the whole world be ruined\r\nthan give up Transylvania; but he took no interest whatever in the\r\nTyrol.\r\n\r\nApart from that, he applied different rules for Austria than for\r\nHungary. He would not allow of the slightest alteration in Hungary's\r\ninternal conditions, as they must not be effected through external\r\npressure. When I, forced thereto by the distress due to lack of\r\nprovisions, yielded to Ukrainian wishes and notified the Austrian\r\nMinistry of the Ukrainian desire to divide Galicia in two, Tisza was\r\nfully in accordance therewith. He went even further. He opposed any\r\nexpansion of the Monarchy as it might weaken Hungary's influence. All\r\nhis life he was an opponent of the Austro-Polish solution, and a\r\nmortal enemy of the tripartist project; he intended that Poland at\r\nmost should rank as an Austrian province, but would prefer to make her\r\nover to Germany. He did not even wish Roumania to be joined with\r\nHungary, as that would weaken the Magyar influence in Hungary. He\r\nlooked upon it as out of the question to grant the Serbians access to\r\nthe sea, because he wanted the Serbian agricultural products when he\r\nwas in need of them; nor would he leave an open door for the Serbian\r\npigs, as he did not wish the price of the Hungarian to be lowered.\r\nTisza went still further. He was a great stickler for equality in\r\nmaking appointments to foreign diplomatic posts, but I could not pay\r\nmuch heed to that. If I considered the Austrian X better fitted for\r\nthe post of ambassador than the Hungarian Y, I selected him in spite\r\nof eventual disagreement.\r\n\r\nThis trait in the Hungarian, though legally well founded, was\r\nunbearable and not to be maintained in war, and led to various\r\ndisputes between Tisza and myself; and now that he is dead, these\r\nscenes leave me only a feeling of the deepest regret for many a hasty\r\nword that escaped me. We afterwards made a compromise. Tisza promised\r\nnever to interfere except in cases of the greatest urgency, and I\r\npromised to take no important step without his approval. Soon after\r\nthis arrangement he was dismissed by the Emperor for very different\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nI greatly regretted his dismissal, in spite of the difficulties he had\r\ncaused me. To begin with, the Magyar-central standpoint was not a\r\nspeciality of Tisza's; all Magyar politicians upheld it. Secondly,\r\nTisza had one great point in his favour: he had no wish to prolong the\r\nwar for the purpose of conquest; he wished for a rectification of the\r\nRoumanian frontier and nothing beyond that. If it had come to peace\r\nnegotiations, he would have supported me in taking as a basis the\r\n_status quo ante_. His support--and that was the third reason--was of\r\ngreat value, for he was a man who knew how to fight. He had become\r\nhard and old on the battlefield of parliamentary controversy. He stood\r\nin awe of nothing and nobody--and he was true as gold. Fourthly, this\r\nupright man was one of the few who openly told the Emperor the truth,\r\nand the Emperor made use of this, as we all did.\r\n\r\nI was, therefore, convinced beforehand that a change would not improve\r\nthe situation for me. Esterhazy, who succeeded Tisza, certainly never\r\nput obstacles in the way of my policy. At the same time, I missed the\r\nstrong hand that had kept order in Hungary, and the stern voice that\r\nwarned the Emperor, and I did not place the same reliance on Wekerle\r\nas on Tisza, perhaps because I was not on the same terms of friendship\r\nwith him as with Tisza.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had many disputes with Tisza, it is one of the dearest\r\nreminiscences of my time of office that, up to the death of this\r\nremarkable man, our friendship remained unchanged. For many years\r\nHungary and Stephen Tisza were as one. Tisza was a man whose brave and\r\nmanly character, stern and resolute nature, fearlessness and integrity\r\nraised him high above the average man. He was a thorough man, with\r\nbrilliant qualities and great faults; a man whose like is rare in\r\nEurope, in spite of those faults. Great bodies cast long shadows; and\r\nhe was great, and modelled out of the stuff from which the heroes of\r\nold were made--heroes who understood how to fight and die. How often\r\ndid I reproach him with his unhappy \"_puszta_\" patriotism, that was\r\ndigging a grave for him and all of us. It was impossible to change\r\nhim; he was obstinate and unbending, and his greatest fault was that,\r\nall his life, he was under the ban of a petty ecclesiastical policy.\r\nNot a single square metre would he yield either to Roumania in her\r\nday, nor to the Czechs or the Southern Slavs. The career of this\r\nwonderful man contains a terrible tragedy. He fought and strove like\r\nnone other for his people and his country; for years he filled the\r\nbreach and protected his people and his Hungary with his powerful\r\npersonality, and yet it was his obstinate, unyielding policy that was\r\none of the chief reasons of Hungary's fall; the Hungary he so dearly\r\nloved; the fall that he saw when he died, killed by the accursed hand\r\nof some cowardly assassin.\r\n\r\nTisza once told me, with a laugh, that someone had said to him that\r\nhis greatest fault was that he had come into the world as a Hungarian.\r\n\r\nI consider this a most pertinent remark. As a human being and as a\r\nman, he was prominent; but all the prejudices and faults of the Magyar\r\nway of thinking spoilt him.\r\n\r\nHungary and her Constitution--dualism--were one of our misfortunes in\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nHad the Archduke Franz Ferdinand had no other plan but that of doing\r\naway with dualism, he would on that account alone have merited love\r\nand admiration. In Aehrenthal's and Berchtold's time Hungarian policy\r\nsettled the Serbian disputes; it made an alliance with Roumania an\r\nimpossibility; it accomplished the food blockade in Austria during the\r\nwar; prevented all internal reforms; and, finally, at the last moment,\r\nthrough Karolyi's petty shortsighted selfishness, the front was\r\nbeaten. This severe judgment on Hungary's influence on the war remains\r\ntrue, in spite of the undoubtedly splendid deeds of the Magyar troops.\r\nThe Hungarian is of a strong, courageous, and manly disposition;\r\ntherefore, almost always an excellent soldier; but, unfortunately, in\r\nthe course of the last fifty years, Hungarian policy has done more\r\ninjury than the Hungarian soldier possibly could make good in the war.\r\nOnce, during the war, a Hungarian met my reproaches with the rejoinder\r\nthat we could be quite sure about the Hungarians, they were so firmly\r\nlinked to Austria. \"Yes,\" said I; \"Hungary is firmly linked to us, but\r\nlike a stone a drowning man has tied round his own neck.\"\r\n\r\nIf we had not lost the war a fight to the death with the Magyars would\r\nhave been inevitable, because it is impossible to conceive that any\r\nsensible European _consortium_ would consent to be brought into\r\npartnership with Magyar aspirations and plans for dominion.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, during the war an open fight with Budapest was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nWhether the nations that once composed the Habsburg Empire will ever\r\nbe reunited is an open question; should it come to pass, may a kind\r\nfate preserve us from a return of dualism.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nOn December 26, 1916--four days after entering upon office--I received\r\na letter from Tisza in which he imparted to me his views on the\r\ntactics to be observed:\r\n\r\n  All the European neutrals feel that they are more seriously\r\n  threatened by England than by us. The events in Greece, Roumania,\r\n  etc., as well as England's commercial tyranny, act in our favour,\r\n  and the difference of our attitude to the peace plans as compared\r\n  with that of the Entente--if consistently and cleverly carried\r\n  out--will secure neutral sympathy for our group of Powers.\r\n\r\n  From this point of view I see that the chief danger will be that\r\n  our necessarily cautious attitude as regards revealing our war\r\n  aims may give rise to the idea that we are merely trifling with a\r\n  plan for peace for tactical reasons and do not really earnestly\r\n  desire peace.\r\n\r\n  We must therefore furnish our representatives accredited to\r\n  neutrals (the most important being Spain and Holland) with the\r\n  necessary instructions, so that they may be able to account for\r\n  our cautious attitude and explain the reasons that keep us from\r\n  making a premature or one-sided announcement of our conditions.\r\n\r\n  An announcement of the conditions on both sides would expose the\r\n  belligerent parties in both camps to unfavourable criticism and\r\n  might easily make the situation more strained; _a one-sided\r\n  announcement of the war aims would simply afford the leader of the\r\n  belligerent enemy group the opportunity of undoing everything_.\r\n\r\n  It is therefore in the interests of peace that a communication of\r\n  the peace terms should only be made mutually and confidentially,\r\n  but we might be able to give the individual neutral various hints\r\n  concerning it, to show that our war aims coincide with the lasting\r\n  interests of humanity and the peace of the world, that our chief\r\n  aim, _the prevention of Russian world dominion on land and of the\r\n  English at sea_, is in the interests of the entire world, and that\r\n  our peace terms would not include anything that would endanger the\r\n  future peace of the world or could be objected to on the neutral\r\n  side.\r\n\r\n  I offer these views for your consideration, and remain in truest\r\n  friendship, your devoted\r\n\r\n  TISZA.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor, Burian, shortly before he left, had drawn up a peace\r\nproposal together with Bethmann. The Entente's scornful refusal is\r\nstill fresh in everyone's memory. Since hostilities have ceased and\r\nthere have been opportunities of talking to members of the Entente, I\r\nhave often heard the reproach made that the offer of peace could not\r\nhave been accepted by the Entente, as it was couched in the terms of a\r\nconqueror who \"grants\" peace terms to the enemy. Although I will not\r\nattempt to deny that the tone of the peace proposal was very\r\narrogant--an impression which must have been enhanced by Tisza's\r\nspeeches in the Hungarian Parliament--I think, nevertheless, that even\r\nhad it been differently worded it had small prospect of success.\r\nHowever that may be, the stern refusal on the part of the Entente only\r\nstrengthened the situation for the war-keen military party, who, with\r\nincreased vehemence, maintained the point that all talk of peace was a\r\nmistake, and that the fighting must go on to the end.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1917, Italy made a slight advance. What territorial\r\nconcessions was the Monarchy prepared to make? This did not proceed\r\nfrom the Italian Government, but was a step taken by a private\r\nindividual which was communicated to me through a friendly Government.\r\nIt is extremely difficult to judge of the true value of such a step. A\r\nGovernment can make use of a private individual to take the first\r\nstep--it will probably do so when intercourse is desired; but it may\r\nalso be that a private person, without instructions from, or the\r\nknowledge of, his Government, might do the same. Instances of the\r\nlatter occurred frequently during my term of office.\r\n\r\nI always held the standpoint that any such tentative steps for peace,\r\neven when a ministerial source could not be proved _a priori_, should\r\nbe treated with prudence, but in a friendly spirit. In the\r\nabove-mentioned case, however, the fact was that Italy neither could\r\nseparate from her Allies, nor did she wish to do so. Had that been her\r\npurpose, it would have involved her in a conflict with England, whose\r\naim in war was the conquest of Germany and not any Italian\r\naspirations. A separate peace with Italy--her separation from her\r\nAllies--was entirely out of the question, but a general peace would\r\nhave been possible if the Western Powers could have come to an\r\nunderstanding with Germany.\r\n\r\nThe only object gained by that appeal would have been to confirm the\r\nextent of our exhaustion from the war. Had I answered that I was ready\r\nto give up this or that province, it would have been interpreted as a\r\nconclusive symptom of our increasing weakness, and would not have\r\nbrought peace any nearer, but rather kept it at a greater distance.\r\n\r\nI answered, therefore, in friendly tone that the Monarchy did not aim\r\nat conquests, and that I was ready to negotiate on the basis of\r\npre-war conditions of possession. No answer was sent.\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall I was told by a person, certainly not competent to\r\njudge, that my tactics had been mistaken, as Italy would have\r\nseparated from her Allies and concluded a separate peace. Further\r\naccounts given in this chapter prove the injustice of the reproof. But\r\nit is easy now to confirm the impression that there was not a single\r\nmoment while the war lasted when Italy ever thought of leaving her\r\nAllies.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary incident occurred at the end of February, 1917. A\r\nperson came to me on February 26 who was in a position to give\r\ncredentials showing him to be a recognised representative of a neutral\r\nPower, and informed me on behalf of his Government that he had been\r\ninstructed to let me know that our enemies--or at least one of\r\nthem--were ready to conclude peace with us, and that the conditions\r\nwould be favourable for us. In particular, there was to be no question\r\nof separating Hungary or Bohemia from the Empire. I was asked, if\r\nagreeable to the proposition, to communicate my conditions through the\r\nsame agency, my attention being called, however, to the proviso that\r\n_these proposals made by the enemy Government would become null and\r\nvoid from the moment that another Government friendly to us or to the\r\nhostile country heard of the step_.\r\n\r\nThe bearer of this message knew nothing beyond its contents. The final\r\nsentence made it obvious that one of the enemy Powers was anxious to\r\nnegotiate unknown to the others.\r\n\r\nI did not for a moment doubt that it was a question of Russia, and my\r\nauthority confirmed my conviction by stating distinctly that he could\r\nnot say so positively. I answered at once by telegram on February 27\r\nthrough the agency of the intervening neutral Power that\r\nAustria-Hungary was, of course, ready to put an end to further\r\nbloodshed, and did not look for any gains from the peace, because, as\r\nstated several times, we were engaged in a war of defence only. But I\r\ndrew attention to the rather obscure sense of the application, not\r\nbeing able to understand whether the State applying to us wished for\r\npeace _with us only_, or with the entire _group of Powers_, and I was\r\nconstrained to emphasise the fact that we did not intend to separate\r\nfrom our Allies. I was ready, however, to offer my services as\r\nmediator if, as presumed, the State making the advance was ready to\r\nconclude peace with our entire group of Powers. I would guarantee\r\nsecrecy, as I, first of all, considered it superfluous to notify our\r\nAllies. The moment for that would only be when the situation was made\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nThis was followed on March 9 by a reply accepting, though not giving a\r\ndirect answer to the point of whether the proposal was for a peace\r\nwith us alone or together with our Allies. In order to have it made\r\nclear as quickly as possible, and not to lose further time, I answered\r\nat once requesting the hostile Power to send a confidential person to\r\na neutral country, whither I also would send a delegate, adding that I\r\nhoped that the meeting would have a favourable result.\r\n\r\nI never received any answer to this second telegram. A week later, on\r\nMarch 16, the Tsar abdicated. Obviously, it was a last attempt on his\r\npart to save the situation which, had it occurred a few weeks earlier,\r\nwould not only have altered the fate of Russia, but that of the whole\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Revolution placed us in an entirely new situation. After\r\nall, there was no doubt that the East presented an obvious possibility\r\nof concluding peace, and all our efforts were turned in that\r\ndirection, for we were anxious to seize the first available moment to\r\nmake peace with the Russian Revolutionary Party, a peace which the\r\nTsar, faced by his coming downfall, had not been able to achieve.\r\n\r\nIf the spring of 1917 was noted for the beginning of the unrestricted\r\nU-boat warfare and all the hopes centred on its success and the\r\naltered situation anticipated on the part of the Germans, the summer\r\nof the same year proved that the proceeding did not fulfil all\r\nexpectations, though causing great anxiety to England. At that time\r\nthere were great fears in England as to whether, and how, the U-boat\r\ncould be paralysed. No one in London knew whether the new means to\r\ncounteract it would suffice before they had been tried, and it was\r\nonly in the course of the summer that the success of the\r\nanti-submarine weapons and the convoy principle was confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1917 very favourable news was received relative\r\nto English and French conditions. Information was sent from Madrid,\r\nwhich was always a reliable source, that some Spanish officers\r\nreturning to Madrid from England reported that the situation there\r\nduring the last few weeks had become very much worse, and that there\r\nwas no longer any confidence in victory. The authorities seized all\r\nthe provisions that arrived for the troops and the munition workers;\r\npotatoes and flour were not to be obtained by the poorer classes; the\r\nmajority of sailors fit for service had been enrolled in the navy, so\r\nthat only inefficient crews were left in the merchant service, and\r\nthey were difficult to secure, owing to their dread of U-boats, and,\r\ntherefore, many British merchantmen were lying idle, as there was no\r\none to man them.\r\n\r\nThis was the tenor of the Spanish reports coming from different\r\nsources. Similar accounts, though in slightly different form, came\r\nfrom France. It was stated that in Paris great war-weariness was\r\nnoticeable. All hope of definite victory was as good as given up; an\r\nend must certainly come before the beginning of winter, and many of\r\nthe leading authorities were convinced that, if war were carried on\r\ninto the winter, the result would be as in Russia--a revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, news came from Constantinople that one of the enemy\r\nPowers in that quarter had made advances for a separate peace. The\r\nTurkish Government replied that they would not separate from their\r\nAllies, but were prepared to discuss a general peace on a basis of\r\nnon-annexation. Talaat Pasha notified me at once of the request and\r\nhis answer. Thereupon nothing more was heard from the enemy Power. At\r\nthe same time news came from Roumania evincing great anxiety\r\nconcerning the increasing break-up in Russia, and acknowledging that\r\nshe considered the game was lost. The revolution and the collapse of\r\nthe army in Russia still continued.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether, the outlook presented a more hopeful picture for us,\r\nand justified the views of those who had always held that a little\r\nmore \"endurance\"--to use a word since become ominous--would lead to a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nDuring a war every Minister of Foreign Affairs must attach an\r\nimportant and adequately estimated significance to confidential\r\nreports. The hermetic isolation which during the world war divided\r\nEurope into two separate worlds made this doubly urgent. But it is\r\ninevitable in regard to confidential reports that they must be\r\naccepted, for various reasons, with a certain amount of scepticism.\r\nThose persons who write and talk, not from any material, but from\r\npolitical interests, from political devotion and sympathy, are, from\r\nthe nature of the case, above suspicion of reporting, for their own\r\npersonal reasons, more optimistically than is justified. But they are\r\napt to be deceived. Nations, too, are subject to feelings, and the\r\nfeelings of the masses must not be taken as expressing the tendencies\r\nof the leading influences. France was tired of war, but how far the\r\nleading statesmen were influenced by that condition, not to be\r\ncompared to our own war-weariness, was not proved.\r\n\r\nIn persons who make this _métier_ their profession, the wish is often\r\npresent, alongside the comprehensible mistakes they make, to give\r\npleasure and satisfaction by their reports, and not run any risk of\r\nlosing a lucrative post. I think it will be always well to estimate\r\nconfidential reports, no matter from what source they proceed, as\r\nbeing 50 per cent. less optimistic than they appear. The more\r\npessimistic opinion that prevailed in Vienna, compared with Berlin,\r\nwas due, first and foremost, to the reliance placed on news coming\r\nfrom the enemy countries. Berlin, too, was quite certain that we were\r\nlosing time, although Bethmann once thought fit in the Reichstag to\r\nassert the contrary; but the German military leaders and the\r\npoliticians looked at the situation _among our opponents_ differently\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor William was at Laxenburg in the summer of 1917 he\r\nrelated to me some instances of the rapidly increasing food trouble in\r\nEngland, and was genuinely surprised when I replied that, though I was\r\nconvinced that the U-boats were causing great distress, there was no\r\nquestion of a famine. I told the Emperor that the great problem was\r\nwhether the U-boats would actually interfere with the transport of\r\nAmerican troops, as the German military authorities asserted, or not,\r\nbut counselled him not to accept as very serious facts a few passing\r\nincidents that might have occurred.\r\n\r\nAfter the beginning of the unrestricted U-boat warfare, I repeat that\r\nmany grave fears were entertained in England. It is a well-known fact.\r\nBut it was a question of fears, not actualities. A person who knew how\r\nmatters stood, and who came to me from a neutral country in the summer\r\nof 1917, said: \"If the half only of the fears entertained in England\r\nbe realised, then the war will be over in the autumn\"; but a wide\r\ndifference existed between London's fears and Berlin's hopes on the\r\none hand, and subsequent events on the other, which had not been taken\r\ninto account by German opinion.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, I consider there is no doubt that, in spite of\r\nthe announced intervention of America, the summer of 1917 represented\r\na more hopeful phase for us. We were carried along by the tide, and it\r\nwas essential to make the most of the situation. Germany must be\r\nbrought to see that peace must be made, in case the peace wave became\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\nI resolved, therefore, to propose to the Emperor that he should make\r\nthe first sacrifice and prove to Berlin that it was not only by words\r\nthat he sought for peace. I asked him to authorise me to state in\r\nBerlin that, in the event of Germany coming to an agreement with\r\nFrance on the Alsace-Lorraine question, Austria would be ready to cede\r\nGalicia to Poland, which was about to be reorganised, and to make\r\nefforts to ensure that this Great-Polish State should be attached to\r\nGermany--not _incorporated_, but, say, some form of personal union.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and I went to Kreuznach, where I first of all made the\r\nproposal to Bethmann and Zimmermann, and subsequently, in the presence\r\nof the Emperor Charles and Bethmann, laid it before the Emperor\r\nWilliam. It was not accepted unconditionally, nor yet refused, and the\r\nconference terminated with a request from the Germans for\r\nconsideration of the question.\r\n\r\nIn making this proposal, I was fully aware of all that it involved. If\r\nGermany accepted the offer, and we in our consequent negotiations with\r\nthe Entente did not secure any noteworthy alterations in the Pact of\r\nLondon, we could count on war only. In that case, we should have to\r\nsatisfy not only Italy, Roumania, and Serbia, but would also lose the\r\nhoped-for compensation in the annexation of Poland. The Emperor\r\nCharles saw the situation very clearly, but resolved at once,\r\nnevertheless, to take the proposed step.\r\n\r\nI, however, thoroughly believed then--though wrongly--that in the\r\ncircumstances London and Paris would have been able to effect an\r\namendment in the Pact of London. It was not until much later that a\r\ndefinite refusal of our offer was sent by Germany.\r\n\r\nIn April, before a decision had been arrived at, I sent a report to\r\nthe Emperor Charles explaining the situation to him, and requesting\r\nthat he would submit it to the Emperor William.\r\n\r\nThe report was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Will Your Majesty permit me, with the frankness granted me from\r\n  the first day of my appointment, to submit to Your Majesty my\r\n  responsible opinion of the situation?\r\n\r\n  It is quite obvious that our military strength is coming to an\r\n  end. To enter into lengthy details in this connection would be to\r\n  take up Your Majesty's time needlessly.\r\n\r\n  I allude only to the decrease in raw materials for the production\r\n  of munitions, to the thoroughly exhausted human material, and,\r\n  above all, to the dull despair that pervades all classes owing to\r\n  under-nourishment and renders impossible any further endurance of\r\n  the sufferings from the war.\r\n\r\n  Though I trust we shall succeed in holding out during the next few\r\n  months and carry out a successful defence, I am nevertheless\r\n  quite convinced that another winter campaign would be absolutely\r\n  out of the question; in other words, that in the late summer or in\r\n  the autumn an end must be put to the war at all costs.\r\n\r\n  Without a doubt, it will be most important to begin peace\r\n  negotiations at a moment when the enemy has not yet grasped the\r\n  fact of our waning strength. If we approach the Entente at a\r\n  moment when disturbances in the interior of the Empire reveal the\r\n  coming breakdown every step will have been in vain, and the\r\n  Entente will agree to no terms except such as would mean the\r\n  absolute destruction of the Central Powers. To begin at the right\r\n  time is, therefore, of extreme importance.\r\n\r\n  I cannot here ignore the subject on which lies the crux of the\r\n  whole argument. That is, the danger of revolution which is rising\r\n  on the horizon of all Europe and which, supported by England, is\r\n  demonstrating a new mode of fighting. Five monarchs have been\r\n  dethroned in this war, and the amazing facility with which the\r\n  strongest Monarchy in the world was overthrown may help to make us\r\n  feel anxious and call to our memory the saying: _exempla trahunt_.\r\n  Let it not be said that in Germany or Austria-Hungary the\r\n  conditions are different; let it not be contested that the firmly\r\n  rooted monarchist tendencies in Berlin and Vienna exclude the\r\n  possibility of such an event. This war has opened a new era in the\r\n  history of the world; it is without example and without precedent.\r\n  The world is no longer what it was three years ago, and it will be\r\n  vain to seek in the history of the world a parallel to the\r\n  happenings that have now become daily occurrences.\r\n\r\n  The statesman who is neither blind nor deaf must be aware how the\r\n  dull despair of the population increases day by day; he is bound\r\n  to hear the sullen grumbling of the great masses, and if he be\r\n  conscious of his own responsibility he must pay due regard to that\r\n  factor.\r\n\r\n  Your Majesty has seen the secret reports from the governor of the\r\n  town. Two things are obvious. The Russian Revolution affects our\r\n  Slavs more than it does the Germans, and the responsibility for\r\n  the continuation of the war is a far greater one for the Monarch\r\n  whose country is only united through the dynasty than for the one\r\n  where the people themselves are fighting for their national\r\n  independence. Your Majesty knows that the burden laid upon the\r\n  population has assumed proportions that are unbearable; Your\r\n  Majesty knows that the bow is strained to such a point that any\r\n  day it may be expected to snap. But should serious disturbances\r\n  occur, either here or in Germany, it will be impossible to conceal\r\n  the fact from the Entente, and from that moment all further\r\n  efforts to secure peace will be defeated.\r\n\r\n  I do not think that the internal situation in Germany is widely\r\n  different from what it is here. I am only afraid that the military\r\n  circles in Berlin are deceiving themselves in certain matters. I\r\n  am firmly convinced that Germany, too, like ourselves, has reached\r\n  the limit of her strength, and the responsible political leaders\r\n  in Berlin do not seek to deny it.\r\n\r\n  I am firmly persuaded that, if Germany were to attempt to embark\r\n  on another winter campaign, there would be an upheaval in the\r\n  interior of the country which, to my mind, would be far worse than\r\n  a peace concluded by the Monarchs. If the Monarchs of the Central\r\n  Powers are not able to conclude peace within the next few months,\r\n  it will be done for them by their people, and then will the tide\r\n  of revolution sweep away all that for which our sons and brothers\r\n  fought and died.\r\n\r\n  I do not wish to make any _oratio pro domo_, but I beg Your\r\n  Majesty graciously to remember that I, the only one to predict the\r\n  Roumanian war two years before, spoke to deaf ears, and that when\r\n  I, two months before the war broke out, prophesied almost the very\r\n  day when it would begin, nobody would believe me. I am just as\r\n  convinced of my present diagnosis as I was of the former one, and\r\n  I cannot too insistently urge you not to estimate too lightly the\r\n  dangers that I see ahead.\r\n\r\n  Without a doubt, the American declaration of war has greatly\r\n  aggravated the situation. It may be many months before America can\r\n  throw any noteworthy forces into the field, but the moral fact,\r\n  the fact that the Entente has the hope of fresh forces, brings the\r\n  situation to an unfavourable stage for us, because our enemies\r\n  have more time before them than we have and can afford to wait\r\n  longer than we, unfortunately, are able to do. It cannot yet be\r\n  said what course events will take in Russia. I hope--and this is\r\n  the vital point of my whole argument--that Russia has lost her\r\n  motive power for a long time to come, perhaps for ever, and that\r\n  this important factor will be made use of. I expect, nevertheless,\r\n  that a Franco-English, probably also an Italian, offensive will be\r\n  launched at the first opportunity, though I hope and trust that we\r\n  shall be able to repulse both attacks. If this succeeds--and I\r\n  reckon it can be done in two or three months--we must then, before\r\n  America takes any further military action to our disadvantage,\r\n  make a more comprehensive and detailed peace proposal and not\r\n  shrink from the probably great and heavy sacrifices we may have to\r\n  make.\r\n\r\n  Germany places great hopes on the U-boat warfare. I consider such\r\n  hopes are deceptive. I do not for a moment disparage the fabulous\r\n  deeds of the German sea heroes; I admit admiringly that the\r\n  tonnage sunk per month is phenomenal, but I assert that the\r\n  success anticipated and predicted by the Germans has not been\r\n  achieved.\r\n\r\n  Your Majesty will remember that Admiral Holtzendorff, when last in\r\n  Vienna, told us positively that the unrestricted U-boat warfare\r\n  would bring England to her knees within six months. Your Majesty\r\n  will also remember how we combated the prediction and declared\r\n  that, though we did not doubt the U-boat campaign would seriously\r\n  affect England, yet the looked-for success would be discounted by\r\n  the anticipated entry of America into the war. It is now two and a\r\n  half months (almost half the time stated) since the U-boat warfare\r\n  started, and all the information that we get from England is to\r\n  the effect that the downfall of this, our most powerful and most\r\n  dangerous adversary, is not to be thought of. If, in, spite of\r\n  many scruples, Your Majesty yielded to Germany's wish and\r\n  consented to allow the Austro-Hungarian Navy to take part in the\r\n  U-boat warfare, it was not because we were converted by the German\r\n  arguments, but because Your Majesty deemed it to be absolutely\r\n  necessary to act with Germany in loyal concert in all quarters and\r\n  because we were firmly persuaded that Germany, unfortunately,\r\n  would never desist from her resolve to begin the unrestricted\r\n  U-boat warfare.\r\n\r\n  To-day, however, in Germany the most enthusiastic advocates of the\r\n  U-boat warfare are beginning to see that this means to victory\r\n  will not be decisive, and I trust that the mistaken idea that\r\n  England within a few months will be forced to sue for peace will\r\n  lose ground in Berlin too. Nothing is more dangerous in politics\r\n  than to believe the things one wishes to believe; nothing is more\r\n  fatal than the principle not to wish to see the truth and to fall\r\n  a prey to Utopian illusions from which sooner or later a terrible\r\n  awakening will follow.\r\n\r\n  England, the motive power in the war, will not be compelled to lay\r\n  down her arms in a few months' time, but perhaps--and here I\r\n  concede a limited success to the U-boat scheme--perhaps England in\r\n  a few months will ask herself whether it is wise and sensible to\r\n  continue this war _à l'outrance_, or whether it would not be more\r\n  statesmanlike to set foot upon the golden bridges the Central\r\n  Powers must build for her, and then the moment will have come for\r\n  great and painful sacrifices on the part of the Central Powers.\r\n\r\n  Your Majesty has rejected the repeated attempts of our enemies to\r\n  separate us from our Allies, in which step I took the\r\n  responsibility because Your Majesty is incapable of any\r\n  dishonourable action. But at the same time, Your Majesty\r\n  instructed me to notify the statesmen of the German Empire that\r\n  our strength is at an end, and that after the close of the summer\r\n  Germany must not reckon on us any longer. I carried out these\r\n  commands and the German statesmen left me in no doubt that for\r\n  Germany, too, another winter campaign would be impossible. In this\r\n  one sentence may be summed up all that I have to say:\r\n\r\n  We can still wait some weeks and try if there is any possibility\r\n  of dealing with Paris or Petersburg. If that does not succeed,\r\n  then we must--and at the right time--play our last card and make\r\n  the extreme proposals I have already hinted at. Your Majesty has\r\n  proved that you have no selfish plans and that you do not expect\r\n  from your German Ally sacrifices that Your Majesty would not be\r\n  ready to make yourself. More than that cannot be expected.\r\n\r\n  Your Majesty, nevertheless, owes it to God and to your peoples to\r\n  make every effort to avert the catastrophe of a collapse of the\r\n  Monarchy; it is your sacred duty to God and to your peoples to\r\n  defend those peoples, the dynastic principle and your throne with\r\n  all the means in your power and to your very last breath.\r\n\r\nOn May 11 there came the following official answer from the Imperial\r\nChancellor, which was sent by the German Emperor to the Emperor\r\nCharles, and then to me:--\r\n\r\n  In accordance with Your Majesty's commands I beg most humbly to\r\n  submit the following in answer to the enclosed _exposé_ from the\r\n  Imperial and Royal Minister for Foreign Affairs of 12th ult.\r\n\r\n  Since the _exposé_ was drawn up, the French and English on the\r\n  Western front have carried out the predicted great offensive on a\r\n  wide front, ruthlessly sacrificing masses of men and an enormous\r\n  quantity of war material. The German army checked the advance of\r\n  the numerically superior enemy; further attacks, as we have every\r\n  reason to believe, will also be shattered by the heroism of the\r\n  men and the iron will of their leaders.\r\n\r\n  Judging from all our experiences hitherto in the war, we may\r\n  consider the situation of the Allied armies on the Isonzo with the\r\n  same confidence.\r\n\r\n  The Eastern front has been greatly reduced owing to the political\r\n  upheaval in Russia. There can be no question of an offensive on a\r\n  large scale on the part of Russia. A further easing of the\r\n  situation would release more men even if it were considered\r\n  necessary to have a strong barrier on the Russian frontier to\r\n  guard against local disturbances owing to the revolutionary\r\n  movement. With the additional forces, the conditions in the West\r\n  would become more favourable for us. The withdrawal of men would\r\n  also provide more troops for the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy for\r\n  the successful carrying out of the fighting on the Italian front\r\n  until the end of the war is reached.\r\n\r\n  In both Allied Monarchies there is an ample supply of raw material\r\n  for the manufacture of munitions. Our situation as regards\r\n  provisions is such that with the greatest economy we can hold out\r\n  until the new harvest. The same applies to Austria-Hungary,\r\n  especially if her share of the supplies from Roumania are taken\r\n  into consideration.\r\n\r\n  The deeds of our navy rank beside the successes of the army. When\r\n  Admiral von Holtzendorff was permitted to lay before His Apostolic\r\n  Majesty the plans for the U-boat warfare, the prospects of success\r\n  for this stringent measure had been thoroughly tested here and the\r\n  expected military advantages weighed against the political risk.\r\n  We did not conceal from ourselves that the infliction of a\r\n  blockade of the coasts of England and France would bring about the\r\n  entry into war of the United States and, consequently, a falling\r\n  off of other neutral states. We were fully aware that our enemies\r\n  would thus gain a moral and economic renewal of strength, but we\r\n  were, and still are, convinced that the disadvantages of the\r\n  U-boat warfare are far surpassed by its advantages. The largest\r\n  share in the world struggle which began in the East has now been\r\n  transferred to the West in ever increasing dimensions, where\r\n  English tenacity and endurance promote and strengthen the\r\n  resistance of our enemies by varied means. A definite and\r\n  favourable result for us could only be achieved by a determined\r\n  attack on the vital spot in the hostile forces; that is, England.\r\n\r\n  The success obtained and the effect already produced by the U-boat\r\n  warfare far exceed all calculations and expectations. The latest\r\n  statements of leading men in England concerning the increasing\r\n  difficulty in obtaining provisions and the stoppage of supplies,\r\n  as well as corresponding comments in the Press, not only include\r\n  urgent appeals to the people to put forth their utmost strength,\r\n  but bear also the stamp of grave anxiety and testify to the\r\n  distress that England is suffering.\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of State, Helfferich, at a meeting of the Head\r\n  Committee of the Reichstag on the 28th ult., gave a detailed\r\n  account of the effects of the U-boat warfare on England. The\r\n  review was published in the _Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_ of\r\n  the 1st inst. I beg herewith to refer to the enclosed.[8]\r\n\r\n  According to the latest news the Food Controller, Lord Rhondda,\r\n  owing to the inadequate supply of corn, has been compelled to\r\n  specify a new allotment of cargo space. This is already so\r\n  restricted that more room for corn can only be secured by\r\n  hindering the conduct of the war in other ways. Apart from\r\n  abandoning overseas traffic, vessels could only be released by\r\n  cutting down such imports as absorbed much space. England requires\r\n  not only great transport facilities for provisions but also for\r\n  the import of ore to keep up war industries, and also pit props to\r\n  enable the coal output to be kept at a high level. In the case of\r\n  the ore needed for England and the wood available in the country,\r\n  it is not possible to restrict the cargo space in these two\r\n  instances. Already, after three months of the U-boat warfare, it\r\n  is a fact that the shortage of cargo space caused by the U-boats\r\n  reduces the living conditions of the population to an unbearable\r\n  extent, and paralyses all war industries, so much so that the hope\r\n  of defeating Germany by superior stores of munitions and a greater\r\n  number of guns has had to be given up. The lack of transport\r\n  facilities will also prevent the larger output of war industries\r\n  in America making up for the lesser output in England. The speed\r\n  with which the U-boat warfare has destroyed vessels excludes the\r\n  possibility of building new vessels to furnish adequate cargo\r\n  space. More vessels have been destroyed in a month of U-boat\r\n  warfare than the English dockyards have turned out in the last\r\n  year. Even the thousand much-talked-of American wooden vessels, if\r\n  they were there, would only cover the losses of four months. But\r\n  they will not come before it is too late. English experts on the\r\n  subject have already said quite openly that there are only two\r\n  ways of counteracting the effect of the U-boats: either to build\r\n  vessels quicker than the Germans destroy them, or else to destroy\r\n  the U-boats quicker than the Germans can build them. The first has\r\n  proved to be impossible, and the U-boat losses are far less than\r\n  the new vessels building.\r\n\r\n  England will also have to reckon on a progressive rise in the loss\r\n  of tonnage.\r\n\r\n  The effects of the U-boat warfare on the people's provisions and\r\n  on all private and Government activities will be felt more and\r\n  more.\r\n\r\n  I anticipate, therefore, the final results of the U-boat warfare\r\n  with the greatest confidence.\r\n\r\n  According to secret but reliable information, the Prime Minister\r\n  Ribot recently stated to the Italian Ambassador in Paris that\r\n  France was faced with exhaustion. This opinion was expressed\r\n  before the beginning of the last Franco-English offensive. Since\r\n  then, France has sacrificed life to a terrible extent by keeping\r\n  up the intensity of the fighting until the offensive ceased.\r\n\r\n  The French nation is certainly doing marvellous things in this\r\n  war, but the Government cannot sustain the enormous burden after\r\n  it reaches a certain limit. A reaction in the temper of France,\r\n  which is kept up by artificial means, is inevitable.\r\n\r\n  As regards our own internal situation, I do not under-estimate the\r\n  difficulties presented by the inevitable results of the severe\r\n  fighting and the exclusion from the seas. But I firmly believe\r\n  that we shall succeed in overcoming these difficulties without\r\n  permanently endangering the nation's strength and general welfare,\r\n  without any further crises and without menace to Government\r\n  organisation.\r\n\r\n  Although we are justified in viewing the total situation in a\r\n  favourable light, I am nevertheless in complete agreement with\r\n  Count Czernin in pursuing the aim of bringing about as speedily as\r\n  possible an honourable and, in the interests of the Empire and of\r\n  our Allies, just peace. I also share his opinion that the\r\n  important factor of the weakening of Russia must be exploited, and\r\n  that a fresh tentative offer for peace must be put forward at a\r\n  time when both political and military initiative are still in our\r\n  hands. Count Czernin estimates a suitable time will be in two or\r\n  three months, when the enemy offensive will be at an end. As a\r\n  matter of fact, in view of the French and English expectations of\r\n  the decisive success for their offensive, and the Entente not\r\n  having lost all hopes of Russia resuming her activities, any too\r\n  pronounced preparations for peace would not only be doomed to\r\n  failure, but would put new life into the enemy by revealing the\r\n  hopeless exhaustion of the Central Powers' forces. At the present\r\n  moment a general peace could only be bought by our submission to\r\n  the will of the enemy. A peace of that nature would not be\r\n  tolerated by the people and would lead to fatal dangers for the\r\n  Monarchy. It appears to me that quiet determination and caution as\r\n  regards the outer world are more than ever an imperative\r\n  necessity. The development of affairs in Russia has hitherto been\r\n  favourable for us. Party disputes are kept more and more within\r\n  the narrow limits of peace and war questions by political,\r\n  economic and social exigencies, and the impression grows every day\r\n  that the party which makes for peace with the Central Powers will\r\n  be the one to remain in power. It is our solemn duty carefully to\r\n  follow and encourage the process of development and disruption in\r\n  Russia and to sound the country, not with too obvious haste, but\r\n  yet with sufficient expert skill to lead to practical peace\r\n  negotiations. The probability is that Russia will avoid any\r\n  appearance of treachery towards her Allies, and will endeavour to\r\n  find a method which will practically lead to a state of peace\r\n  between herself and the Central Powers, but outwardly will have\r\n  the appearance of the union of both parties as a prelude to the\r\n  general peace.\r\n\r\n  As in July, 1914, we entered regardlessly into a loyal alliance\r\n  with Austria-Hungary, in like manner when the world war is at an\r\n  end will a basis be found for terms which will guarantee a\r\n  prosperous peace to the two closely united Monarchies.\r\n\r\nThis optimistic reply of Bethmann's was obviously not only based on\r\nthe idea of infusing more confidence in the future in us, but was also\r\nthe true expression of a more favourable atmosphere prevailing, as\r\nBerlin naturally received the same reports from the enemy countries as\r\nwe did.\r\n\r\nI received about that time a letter from Tisza which contained the\r\nfollowing passage:--\r\n\r\n  The varied information received from the enemy countries leaves no\r\n  doubt that the war is drawing to a close. It is now above all\r\n  essential to keep a steady nerve and play the game to the end with\r\n  _sangfroid_. Let there be no signs of weakness. It is not from a\r\n  love of humanity in general that our enemies have become more\r\n  peacefully inclined, but because they realise that we cannot be\r\n  crushed.\r\n\r\n  I beg of you no longer to give vent to the sentiments in your\r\n  report of April 12. A pessimistic tendency evinced now by the\r\n  leader of our foreign affairs would ruin everything. I know that\r\n  you are prudent, but I beg you to use your influence so that both\r\n  His Majesty and his entourage may show a confident front to the\r\n  world. And again, no one will have anything to say to us if they\r\n  cease to believe in our powers of resistance--and are not\r\n  persuaded that our Alliance rests on a solid foundation.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the only right tactics were to make the supremest\r\nefforts at the front and throughout the country, on the one hand, in\r\norder to hold the situation a little longer, and, on the other, to\r\npersuade the enemy that, in spite of the favourable situation, we were\r\nprepared for peace without conquest. To appoint Hebel to the German\r\nmilitary Commission to carry out this last procedure seemed devoid of\r\nsense. Neither did I expect to gain much from recent intervention in\r\nthe Wilhelmstrasse, and endeavoured therefore to put myself in direct\r\ntouch with the German Reichstag.\r\n\r\nOne of my political friends who had numerous and excellent connections\r\nwith the German Reichstag put himself into communication with\r\ndifferent leaders in Berlin and explained to them the situation in the\r\nMonarchy. It was understood that this gentleman was not acting for the\r\nMinistry, but presenting his own impressions and views. He was\r\nenjoined to be very cautious, as any indiscretion might have\r\nincalculable consequences. If the Entente were to imagine that we were\r\nthinking of ending the war, not for love of peace but because we\r\nsimply could not hold out any longer, all efforts would have been\r\nvain. In that respect, Tisza was perfectly right. It was, therefore,\r\nabsolutely necessary that the person to whom this delicate mission had\r\nbeen entrusted should act in such a manner as would keep it a secret\r\nfrom the Entente, a manner devoid of weakness and uniting confidence\r\nwith reasonable war aims, but also in a manner which would enable the\r\nMinistry eventually to disavow the advances.\r\n\r\nMy friend undertook the task with just as great zeal as efficiency\r\nand, in brief, this is what he told the Berlin leaders, Erzberger[9]\r\nand Südekum in particular. As far as he could judge, we had now\r\nreached a turning point. The next few weeks would decide whether it\r\nwas to be peace or war _à l'outrance_. France was tired and not\r\nanxious for America's entry into the war if it was not to be the\r\nlatter. If Germany forced the Entente to continue the war the\r\nsituation would be very grave. Neither Austria-Hungary nor Turkey\r\ncould do more. Germany, by herself, could not bring the war to a\r\nsuccessful end. Austria-Hungary's position was obvious to the whole\r\nworld. She was ready to make peace without annexations and without war\r\ncompensation, and to devote all her energies to preventing the\r\nrecurrence of a war. (Austria-Hungary's standpoint was that a\r\nuniversal, equal, but extensive disarmament on sea and on land offered\r\nthe only means to restore the financial situation in Europe after the\r\nwar.)\r\n\r\nGermany must publicly notify her position just as clearly as\r\nAustria-Hungary had done and must declare the following:\r\n\r\n  (1) No annexations, no indemnities.\r\n\r\n  (2) Particularly the unconditional and total release of Belgium\r\n        (politically and economically).\r\n\r\n  (3) All territories occupied by Germany and Austria-Hungary to be\r\n        evacuated as soon as both those States had had their\r\n        territories restored to them (including the German\r\n        colonies).\r\n\r\n  (4) Germany, as well as Austria-Hungary, to work for a general\r\n        disarmament and guarantee that no further war be possible.\r\n\r\nSuch declaration to be a joint one from the German Government and the\r\nReichstag, and to be made public.\r\n\r\nThe peace resolution of July 19, 1917, was the result of this step.\r\nThe Imperial Chancellor Bethmann was the first victim. The Supreme\r\nMilitary Command, by whom he always had been persecuted, now trying to\r\nsecure his dismissal, declared such resolution to be unacceptable.\r\nWhen Bethmann had gone and Michaelis had been appointed, they were\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nAlthough the resolution in itself was satisfactory, it had one fault\r\nat the start. It was no secret that everyone connected with\r\nPan-Germanism, especially the German generals, disagreed with the\r\ndecision, and would not accept the resolution as coming from the\r\nentire country. Certainly the great majority in Germany, counting them\r\nper head, supported the resolution but the leading men, together with\r\na considerable following, were opposed to it. The \"Starvation Peace,\"\r\nthe \"Peace of Renunciation,\" and the \"Scheidemann Peace\" were the\r\nsubjects of articles in the papers expressing the greatest disapproval\r\nof the resolution. Neither did the German Government take up any\r\ndecided attitude. On July 19 the Imperial Chancellor Michaelis made a\r\nspeech approving the resolution, but adding \"as I understand it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Chancellor wrote a letter to me in August confirming his\r\nvery optimistic views of the situation, and defining Germany's views\r\nregarding Belgium. The phrase, \"as I understand it,\" above alluded to\r\nin his approval of the resolution, was explained in his letter, at any\r\nrate, as to the Belgium question: \"As Germany wishes to reserve to\r\nherself the right to exercise a far-reaching military and economic\r\ninfluence on Belgium.\" He wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Berlin, August 17, 1917._\r\n\r\n  DEAR COUNT CZERNIN,--According to our agreement, I take the\r\n  liberty briefly to lay before you my views of our discussions of\r\n  the 14th and 15th inst., and would be extremely grateful if Your\r\n  Excellency would be so kind as to advise me of your views on my\r\n  activities.\r\n\r\n  The internal economic and political situation in Germany justifies\r\n  me in the firm belief that Germany herself would be able to stand\r\n  a fourth year of war. The bread-corn harvest promises better than\r\n  we thought five or six weeks ago, and will be better than that of\r\n  the previous year. The potato harvest promises a considerably\r\n  higher yield than in 1916-17. Fodder is estimated to be much less\r\n  than last year; by observing a unified and well-thought-out\r\n  economic plan for Germany herself and the occupied territories,\r\n  including Roumania, we shall be in a position to hold out with\r\n  regard to fodder, as was also possible in the very dry year 1915.\r\n\r\n  There is no doubt that the political situation is grave. The\r\n  people are suffering from the war, and the longing for peace is\r\n  very great; however, there is no trace of any general and really\r\n  morbid exhaustion, and when food is controlled any work done will\r\n  be no worse than it was last year.\r\n\r\n  This economic and political prospect can only be altered if the\r\n  condition of the Allies, or of the neutrals, under pressure from\r\n  the Entente, should become very much worse. It would be a change\r\n  for the worse for us if our Allies or the neutral states, contrary\r\n  to our expectations and hopes, were to experience such shortage as\r\n  would cause them to turn to us. To a certain extent, this is\r\n  already the case; a further increase of their claims would greatly\r\n  prejudice our economic position and in certain cases endanger it.\r\n  It must be admitted that the situation in the fourth year of war\r\n  in general is more difficult than in the third year. The most\r\n  earnest endeavours, therefore, will be made to bring about a peace\r\n  as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n  Nevertheless, our genuine desire for peace must not lead us to\r\n  come forward with a fresh peace proposal. That, in my opinion,\r\n  would be a great tactical error. Our _démarche_ for peace last\r\n  December found sympathy in the neutral states, but it was answered\r\n  by our adversaries raising their demands. A fresh step of the kind\r\n  would be put down to our weakness and would prolong the war; any\r\n  peace advances must come now from the enemy.\r\n\r\n  The leading motive in my foreign policy will always be the\r\n  watchful care of our Alliance with Austria-Hungary that the storm\r\n  of war has made still stronger, and a trusting, friendly and loyal\r\n  co-operation with the leading men of the Allied Monarchy. If the\r\n  spirit of the Alliance--and in this I know Your Excellency\r\n  agrees--remains on the same high level as heretofore, even our\r\n  enemies would see that it was impossible for one of the Allies to\r\n  agree to any separate negotiations offered to him, unless he\r\n  states beforehand that the discussion would only be entered into\r\n  if the object were a general peace. If this were clearly laid down\r\n  there could be no reason why one of the Allies should not listen\r\n  to such proposal from the enemy and with him discuss preparations\r\n  for peace.\r\n\r\n  At present no decided line of action can be specified for such a\r\n  proceeding. Your Excellency was good enough to ask me whether the\r\n  reinstatement of the _status quo_ would be a suitable basis on\r\n  which to start negotiations. My standpoint in this matter is as\r\n  follows: I have already stated in the Reichstag that Germany is\r\n  not striving for any great changes in power after the war, and is\r\n  ready to negotiate provided the enemy does not demand the cession\r\n  of any German territory; with such a conception of the term\r\n  \"reinstatement of the _status quo_,\" that form would be a very\r\n  suitable basis for negotiations. This would not exclude the\r\n  desired possibility of retaining the present frontiers, and by\r\n  negotiating bring former enemy economic territory into close\r\n  economic and military conjunction with Germany--this would refer\r\n  to Courland, Lithuania and Poland--and thus secure Germany's\r\n  frontiers and give a guarantee for her vital needs on the\r\n  continent and overseas.\r\n\r\n  Germany is ready to evacuate the occupied French territory, but\r\n  must reserve to herself the right, _by means of the peace\r\n  negotiations, to the economic exploitation of the territory of\r\n  Longwy and Briey_, if not through direct incorporation, by a legal\r\n  grant to exploit. We are not in a position to cede to France any\r\n  noteworthy districts in Alsace-Lorraine.\r\n\r\n  I should wish to have a free hand in the negotiations in the\r\n  matter of _connecting Belgium with Germany in a military and\r\n  economic sense_. The terms that I read out, taken from notes at\r\n  the Kreuznach negotiations--the military control of Belgium until\r\n  the conclusion of a defensive and offensive Alliance with Germany,\r\n  the acquisition of Liége (or a long-term rental thereof)--were\r\n  the maximum claims of the Supreme Military and Naval Command. The\r\n  Supreme Military Command agrees with me that these terms or\r\n  similar ones can only be secured if peace can be enforced on\r\n  England. But we are of opinion that a vast amount of economic and\r\n  military influence must be brought to bear in Belgium in the\r\n  matter of the negotiations and would perhaps not meet with much\r\n  resistance, because Belgium, from economic distress, will come to\r\n  see that her being joined to Germany is the best guarantee for a\r\n  prosperous future.\r\n\r\n  As regards Poland, I note that the confidential hint from Your\r\n  Excellency to give up Galicia and enrol it in the new Polish State\r\n  is subject to the ceding of portions of Alsace-Lorraine to France,\r\n  which was to be as a counter-sacrifice, but must be considered as\r\n  out of the question. The development of Poland as an independent\r\n  State must be carried out in the sense of the proclamation of\r\n  November 5, 1916. Whether this development will prove to be an\r\n  actual advantage for Germany or will become a great danger for the\r\n  future will be tested later. There are already many signs of\r\n  danger, and what is particularly to be feared is that the\r\n  Austro-Hungarian Government cannot notify us now during the war of\r\n  her complete indifference to Poland and leave us a free hand in\r\n  the administration of the whole state.\r\n\r\n  It will also remain to be seen whether, in view of the danger\r\n  caused to Germany and also to her relations with Austria-Hungary\r\n  through Poland's unwillingness to accept the situation, it would\r\n  not be more desirable politically for Germany, while retaining the\r\n  frontier territory as being necessary for military protection, to\r\n  grant to Poland full right of self-determination, also with the\r\n  possibility of being joined to Russia.\r\n\r\n  The question of the annexation of Roumania, according to the\r\n  Kreuznach debate of May 1, must be treated further and solved in\r\n  connection with the questions that are of interest to Germany\r\n  respecting Courland, Lithuania and Poland.\r\n\r\n  It was a special pleasure to me to meet you, dear Count Czernin,\r\n  here in Berlin and to discuss openly and frankly with you the\r\n  questions that occupy us at present. I hope in days to come there\r\n  may be an opportunity for a further exchange of thoughts enabling\r\n  us to solve problems that may arise, and carry them out in full\r\n  agreement.\r\n\r\n  With the expression of my highest esteem, I remain your very\r\n  devoted\r\n\r\n  MICHAELIS.\r\n\r\nI replied to the Chancellor that I welcomed, as a matter of course,\r\nthe agreement to maintain complete frankness, but remarked that I\r\ncould not share his optimism. I explained that the increasing\r\nwar-weariness, both in Germany and in Austria-Hungary, rendered it\r\nimperative to secure peace in good time, that is, before any\r\nrevolutionary signs appeared, for any beginning of disturbances would\r\nspoil the chance of peace. The German point of view in the case of\r\nBelgium seemed to me quite mistaken, as neither the Entente nor\r\nBelgium would ever consent to the terms. I could not, therefore,\r\nconceal from him that his point of view was a serious obstacle to\r\npeace; that it was also in direct opposition to the Reichstag view,\r\nand I failed to understand it.\r\n\r\nI then spoke of the necessity of coming to an understanding as to the\r\nminimum of the war aims in which an important part is played by the\r\nquestion whether and how we can achieve a voluntary and peaceable\r\nannexation of Poland and Roumania by the Central Powers.\r\n\r\nI finally again pointed out that I interpreted the views of the German\r\nReichstag as demanding a peace without annexation or indemnity, and\r\nthat it would be out of the question for the German Government to\r\nignore the unanimous decision of the Reichstag. It was not a question\r\nof whether we _wished_ to go on fighting, but whether we _could_, and\r\nit was my duty to impress upon him in time that we were bound to end\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nDr. Michaelis was more given to Pan-Germanism than his predecessor.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing to what degree the Pan-Germans misunderstood the\r\nsituation. They disliked me so intensely that they avoided me, and I\r\nhad very few dealings with them. They were not to be converted. I\r\nremember one instance, when a representative of that Party called on\r\nme in Vienna to explain to me the conditions under which his group was\r\nprepared to conclude peace: the annexation of Belgium, of a part of\r\neast France (Longwy and Briey), of Courland and Lithuania, the cession\r\nof the English Fleet to Germany, and I forget how many milliards in\r\nwar indemnity, etc. I received this gentleman in the presence of the\r\nAmbassador von Wiesner, and we both agreed that it was purely a case\r\nfor a doctor.\r\n\r\nThere was a wide breach between the Imperial Chancellor Michaelis's\r\nideas and our own. It was impossible to bridge it over. Soon after he\r\nleft office to make way for the statesmanlike Count Hertling.\r\n\r\nAbout this time very far-reaching events were being enacted behind the\r\nscenes which had a very pronounced influence on the course of affairs.\r\n\r\nActs of great indiscretion and interference occurred on the part of\r\npersons who, without being in any important position, had access to\r\ndiplomatic affairs. There is no object here in mentioning names,\r\nespecially as the responsible political leaders themselves only heard\r\nthe details of what had happened much later, and then in a very\r\nunsatisfactory way--at a time when the pacifist tendencies of the\r\nEntente were slackening.[10]\r\n\r\nIt was impossible then to see clearly in such a labyrinth of confused\r\nand contradictory facts. The truth is that in the spring or early\r\nsummer of 1917 leading statesmen in the countries of the Allies and of\r\nthe Entente gathered the impression that the existence of the\r\nQuadruple Alliance was at an end. At the very moment when it was of\r\nthe utmost importance to maintain secrecy concerning the conditions of\r\nour Alliance the impression prevailed, and, naturally, the Entente\r\nwelcomed the first signs of disruption in the Quadruple Alliance.\r\n\r\nI do not know if the opportunity will ever occur of throwing a clear\r\nlight on all the proceedings of those days. To explain the further\r\ndevelopment it will suffice to confirm what follows here. This is what\r\nhappened. In the spring of 1917 connecting links were established with\r\nParis and London. The first impressions received were that the Western\r\nPowers were ready to make use of us as a bridge to Germany and to a\r\ngeneral peace. At a somewhat later stage the wind veered and the\r\nEntente endeavoured to make a separate peace with us.\r\n\r\nSeveral important details only came to my knowledge later, some at the\r\ntime of my resignation in the spring of 1918, and some not until the\r\ncollapse in the winter of 1918-19. There was no lack of voices to\r\nblame me for a supposed double policy, which the public also\r\nsuspected, and to accuse me of having made different statements to\r\nBerlin from those I made in Paris. These charges were brought by\r\npersonal enemies who deliberately slandered me, which tales were\r\nrepeated by others who knew nothing about the affair. The fact is that\r\nwhen I heard of the episode I immediately _possessed myself of\r\ndocuments proving that not only did I know nothing whatever about the\r\nmatter_, but could not possibly have known.\r\n\r\nAstronomical causes sometimes give rise to disturbances in the\r\nuniverse, the reason of which cannot be understood by the observer. I\r\nfelt in the same way, without being able to prove anything definite,\r\nfrom certain signs that I noticed, that in those worlds on the other\r\nside of the trenches events were happening that were inexplicable to\r\nme. I felt the effect, but could not discover the cause. In the spirit\r\nof the Entente, now more favourably disposed for peace, an undertone\r\nwas distinctly audible. There was anxiety and a greater inclination\r\nfor peace than formerly, but again probably only in view of the\r\nalleged laxity of our Alliance conditions and the hopes of the\r\ndownfall of the Quadruple Alliance. A friend of mine, a subject of a\r\nneutral state, wrote to me from Paris in the summer and told me he had\r\nheard from a reliable source that apparently at the Quai d'Orsay they\r\nexpected the Monarchy to separate from Germany, which, as a matter of\r\ncourse, would alter the entire military situation.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards very secret information was received from a neutral\r\ncountry that a Bulgarian group was negotiating with the Entente behind\r\nthe back and without the knowledge of Radoslawoff. As soon as\r\nsuspicion of a breach in the Alliance had been aroused in our Allies,\r\nthe Bulgarian party hastened to forestall the event. We felt as safe\r\nabout Radoslawoff as about Talaat Pasha; but in both countries other\r\nforces were at work.\r\n\r\nThe suspicions aroused in our friends concerning our plans were a\r\nfurther disadvantage, certainly only of a technical nature, but yet\r\nnot to be underestimated. Our various agents worked splendidly, but it\r\nlay in the nature of the case that their dealings were more protracted\r\nthan those carried out by the Foreign Minister himself. According to\r\nthe course taken by the conversations, they were obliged to seek fresh\r\ninstructions; they were more tied, and therefore forced to assume a\r\nmore halting attitude than a responsible leader would have to do. In\r\nthe summer of 1917, therefore, I suggested going to Switzerland\r\nmyself, where negotiations were proceeding. But my journey could not\r\nhave been kept secret, and if an effort had been made to do so it\r\nwould have been all the more certain to arouse suspicion, owing to the\r\nmistrust already awakened. But not in Berlin. I believe I still held\r\nthe confidence of the leading men in Berlin sufficiently to avert\r\nthat. I should have explained the situation to the Imperial\r\nChancellor, and that would have sufficed. In Turkey and Bulgaria the\r\ncase was different.\r\n\r\nOne party in Bulgaria favoured the Entente. If Bulgaria was under the\r\nimpression that our group was falling asunder she would have staked\r\neverything to try and save herself by a separate peace. In\r\nConstantinople, too, there was an Entente group. Talaat and Enver were\r\nas reliable as they were strong. But a journey undertaken by me to\r\nSwitzerland in the conditions described might prove to be the alarm\r\nsignal for a general _sauve qui peut_. But the very suggestion that\r\nthe two Balkan countries would act as they supposed we should do would\r\nhave sufficed to destroy any attempt at peace in Paris and London.\r\n\r\nThe willingness to prepare for peace on the part of the enemy declined\r\nvisibly during the summer. It was evident from many trifling signs,\r\nseparately of small import, collectively of much. In the summer of\r\n1917, too, the first horror of the U-boat warfare began to grow less.\r\nIt was seen by the enemy that it could not accomplish what he had\r\nfirst feared, and that again put life into the desire for a final\r\nmilitary victory.\r\n\r\nThese two facts together probably contributed to fan back the peace\r\nwind blowing from the West. Among other things, the Armand-Revertera\r\nnegotiations were proceeding the whole time. It is not yet the moment\r\nto speak of the negotiations which in the spring of 1918, together\r\nwith the letters of the Emperor to Prince Sixtus, created such a\r\nsensation. But this much must be stated: that Revertera in the\r\nnegotiations proved himself to be an equally correct as efficient\r\nagent who acted exactly according to the instructions he received from\r\nthe Ballplatz. Our various attempts to take up the threads of peace\r\nwhen emanating from the Ballplatz were always intended for our entire\r\ngroup of Powers.\r\n\r\nNaturally, it was not in the interests of the Entente to _prevent_ us\r\nfrom separating from Germany, and when the impression was produced in\r\nLondon and Paris unofficially that we were giving Germany up, we\r\nourselves thus used _sabotage_ in the striving for a general peace;\r\nfor it would, of course, have been pleasing to the Entente to see\r\nGermany, her chief enemy, isolated.\r\n\r\nThere was a twofold and terrible mistake in thus trifling with the\r\nidea of a separate peace. First of all, it could not release us from\r\nthe terms of the Pact of London, and yet it spoiled the atmosphere for\r\nnegotiating a general peace. At the time when these events were being\r\nenacted, I presumed, but only knew for certain later, that Italy, in\r\nany case, would claim the promises made to her.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1917 Ribot and Lloyd George conferred with Orlando on\r\nthe subject, when at St. Jean de Maurienne, and endeavoured to modify\r\nthe terms in case of our separating from Germany. Orlando refused, and\r\ninsisted on his view that, even in the event of a separate peace, we\r\nshould still have to yield up Trieste and the Tyrol as far as the\r\nBrenner Pass to Italy, and thus have to pay an impossible price. And\r\nsecondly, these separatist tactics would break up our forces, and had\r\nalready begun to do so.\r\n\r\nWhen a person starts running away in a fight he but too easily drags\r\nothers with him. I do not doubt that the Bulgarian negotiations,\r\nopened with the purpose of taking soundings, were connected with the\r\nforegoing events.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this well-meant but secret and dilettante policy was\r\nthat we suggested to the Entente a willingness to separate from our\r\nAllies, and lost our position in the struggle for a separate peace.\r\nFor we saw that in separating from Germany we could not escape being\r\ncrippled; that, therefore, a separate peace was impossible, and that\r\nwe had dealt a death-blow at the still intact Quadruple Alliance.\r\n\r\nLater I had information from England relating to the official view of\r\nthe situation there, which differed very much from the optimistic\r\nconfidential reports, and proved that the desire for peace was not so\r\nstrong. It will easily be understood that for us the English policy\r\nwas always the most interesting. England's entry into the war had made\r\nthe situation so dangerous that an understanding arrived at with\r\nher--that is, an understanding between England and Germany through our\r\nintervention--would have put an end to the war.\r\n\r\nThis information was to the effect that England was less than ever\r\ninclined to confer with Germany until the two cardinal points had been\r\nguaranteed--the cession of Alsace-Lorraine and the abolition of German\r\nmilitarism. The former was a French claim, and England must and would\r\nsupport France in this to her very utmost; the second claim was\r\nnecessary in the interests of the future peace of the world. Germany's\r\nmilitary strength was always estimated very highly in England, but the\r\narmy's deeds in this war had surpassed all expectations. The military\r\nsuccesses had encouraged the growth of the military spirit. The peace\r\nresolution passed in the Reichstag proved nothing, or at any rate, not\r\nenough, for the Reichstag is not the real exponent of the Empire in\r\nthe outside world; it became paralysed through an unofficial\r\ncollateral Government, the generals, who possessed the greater power.\r\nCertain statements made by General Ludendorff--so the Entente\r\nsaid--proved that Germany did not wish for an honourable peace of\r\nunderstanding. Besides this the Wilhelmstrasse did not associate\r\nitself with the majority in the Reichstag. The war was not being waged\r\nagainst the German nation, but against its militarism, and to conclude\r\npeace with the latter would be impossible. It appeared, further, that\r\nin no circumstances would England restore Germany's colonies. So far\r\nas the Monarchy was concerned, England appeared to be ready to\r\nconclude a separate peace with her, though subject to the promises\r\nmade to her own Allies. According to the latter there was much\r\nterritory to be given up to Italy, Serbia and Roumania. But in\r\nexchange we might reckon on a sort of annexation of newly made states\r\nlike Poland.\r\n\r\nThis information left no doubt that England was not then thinking of\r\nmaking advances to Germany; the fear of Prussian militarism was at the\r\nbottom of her reasons for refusing. My impression was that, through a\r\nmore favourable continuous development, a settlement and understanding\r\nmight be feasible on the territorial but not on the military\r\nquestions. On the contrary, the stronger Germany's military power\r\nproved itself to be, the more did the Entente fear that their enemy's\r\npower of defence would be invincible unless it was broken then.\r\n\r\nNot only the period preceding war and the outbreak of war, but the\r\nactual course of the war has been full of many and disturbing\r\nmisunderstandings. For long it was not understood here what England\r\nmeant by the term militarism. It was pointed out that the English Navy\r\nwas jealously defending the dominion of the seas, that France and\r\nRussia stood ready armed for the attack, and that Germany was only in\r\na similar position to any other state; that every state strengthened\r\nand equipped its defensive forces as thoroughly as possible.\r\n\r\nBy the term \"Prussian militarism\" England did not only mean the\r\nstrength of the German army. She understood it to be a combination of\r\na warlike spirit bent on oppressing others, and supported by the best\r\nand strongest army in the world. The first would have been innocuous\r\nwithout the second; and the splendid German army was in England's\r\neyes the instrument of a domineering and conquest-loving autocrat.\r\nAccording to England's view, Germany was exactly the counterpart of\r\nFrance under Bonaparte--if for Napoleon be substituted a many-headed\r\nbeing called \"Emperor, Crown Prince, Hindenburg, Ludendorff\"--and just\r\nas little as England would treat with Napoleon would she have any\r\ndealings with the individual who to her was the personification of the\r\nlust for conquest and the policy of violence.\r\n\r\nThe notion of the existence of German militarism seems to be quite\r\njustified, although the Emperor and the Crown Prince played the\r\nsmallest part in it. But it seems to me an altogether wrong conception\r\nthat militarism is a speciality of Germany. The negotiations at\r\nVersailles must now have convinced the general public that it is not\r\nonly on the banks of the Spree that militarism reigns.\r\n\r\nGermany in former days was never able to understand that on the enemy\r\ncontinent, by the side of morally unjustified envy, fear and anxiety\r\nas to Germany's plans practically reigned, and that the talk about the\r\n\"hard\" and \"German\" peace, about \"victory and triumph\" was like\r\nthrowing oil on the flames of their fears; that in England and France,\r\ntoo, at one time, there was a current of feeling urging for a peace of\r\nsettlement, and that such expressions as the foregoing were highly\r\ndetrimental to all pacifist tendencies.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the air raids on England may be ranked in the same\r\ncategory as these expressions. They were carried out with the greatest\r\nheroism by the German fliers, but no other object was gained but to\r\nirritate and anger England and rouse to the utmost resistance all who\r\notherwise had pacifist tendencies. I said this to Ludendorff when he\r\ncalled on me at the Ballplatz in the summer of 1917, but it made not\r\nthe slightest impression on him.\r\n\r\nThe _démarche_ for peace made by the Pope and our reply have been\r\npublished in the European Press. We accepted the noble proposals made\r\nby the Holy Father. I have therefore nothing to add on that matter.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the summer of 1917 the Socialist Conference at\r\nStockholm had become a practical question. I issued passports to the\r\nrepresentatives of our Social Democrats, and had several difficulties\r\nto overcome in connection therewith. My own standpoint is made clear\r\nby the following letter to Tisza.\r\n\r\n  (_Not dated._)\r\n\r\n  DEAR FRIEND,--I hear that you do not approve of the delegation of\r\n  Socialists for Stockholm. To begin with, it is not a delegation.\r\n  The men came to me of their own accord and applied for permission\r\n  to travel, which I granted. Adler, Ellenbogen and Seitz were\r\n  there, Renner as well. The two first are capable men, and I value\r\n  them in spite of the differences that exist between us. The two\r\n  last are not well known to me. But all are genuinely desirous of\r\n  peace, and Adler in particular does not wish the downfall of the\r\n  Empire.\r\n\r\n  If they secure peace it will be a socialistic one, and the Emperor\r\n  will have to pay out of his own pocket; I am sure too, dear\r\n  friend, that if it is not possible to end the war, the Emperor\r\n  will have to pay still more; you may be sure of that.\r\n\r\n  Or, as may be expected, if they do not secure peace, then my\r\n  prediction was all the more correct, for then I shall have proved\r\n  to them that it is not the inefficiency of the Diplomatic Service\r\n  but the conditions surrounding it that must be blamed for the war\r\n  not coming to an end.\r\n\r\n  If I had refused to grant permission for them to travel, they\r\n  would have continued to the last declaring that, if they had been\r\n  allowed to proceed, they would have secured peace.\r\n\r\n  Everyone is indignant with me here, particularly in the\r\n  Herrenhaus. They even go so far that they imagine I had tried to\r\n  \"buy\" the Socialists by promising to lower the Customs dues if\r\n  they returned with peace. I do not want the dues, as you know, but\r\n  that has no connection with Stockholm, \"Sozie\" and peace.\r\n\r\n  I was at an Austrian Cabinet Council lately and gave the\r\n  death-blow to the Customs dues--but I felt rather like Daniel in\r\n  the lions' den when I did it; N. and E. in particular were very\r\n  indignant. The only one who entirely shares my standpoint beside\r\n  Trnka is the Prime Minister Clam.\r\n\r\n  Consequently, this contention that they have been deprived of the\r\n  octroi owing to my love for the \"Sozies\" angers them still more,\r\n  but the contention is false.\r\n\r\n  You, my dear friend, are doubly wrong. In the first place, we\r\n  shall be forced to have Socialist policy after the war whether it\r\n  is welcome or not, and I consider it extremely important to\r\n  prepare the Social Democrats for it. Socialist policy is the\r\n  valve we are bound to open in order to let off the superfluous\r\n  steam, otherwise the boiler will burst. In the second place, none\r\n  of us Ministers can take upon ourselves the false pretence of\r\n  using _sabotage_ with regard to peace. The nations may perhaps\r\n  tolerate the tortures of war for a while, but only if they\r\n  understand and have the conviction that it cannot be\r\n  otherwise--that a _vis major_ predominates; in other words, that\r\n  peace can fail owing to circumstances, but not owing to the ill\r\n  will or stupidity of the Ministers.\r\n\r\n  The German-Bohemian Deputy, K.H. Wolf, made a scene when the\r\n  speech from the throne was read in the \"Burg\"; he declared that we\r\n  were mad and would have to account for it to the delegation, and\r\n  made many other equally pleasant remarks, but he had also come to\r\n  a wrong conclusion about the Customs dues and Stockholm.\r\n\r\n  You are quite right in saying that it is no concern of Germany's\r\n  what we do in the interior. But they have not attempted the\r\n  slightest interference with the dues. If they are afraid of an\r\n  anti-German rate of exchange and, therefore, are in favour of the\r\n  dues, we are to a certain extent to blame. The Berlin people are\r\n  always afraid of treachery. When a vessel answers the starboard\r\n  helm it means she turns to the right, and in order to check this\r\n  movement the steersman must put the helm to larboard as the only\r\n  way to keep a straight course--he must hold out. Such is the case\r\n  of statecraft in Vienna--it is always carried out of the course of\r\n  the Alliance.\r\n\r\n  It is possible to turn and steer the Entente course if thought\r\n  feasible; but then courage would be needed to make the turn fully.\r\n  Nothing is more stupid than trifling with treachery and not\r\n  carrying it out; we lose all ground in Berlin and gain nothing\r\n  either in London or Paris. But why should I write all this--_you_\r\n  share my opinions; I do not need to convert you. We will talk\r\n  about Stockholm again.--In true friendship, your old\r\n\r\n  CZERNIN.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Tisza in this instance allowed himself to be\r\nquite converted, and raised no objections as to the Hungarian Social\r\nDemocrats. The negative result of the Stockholm Congress is known.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, it is at present still impossible to discuss in\r\ndetail the various negotiations and attempts at peace. Besides the\r\nnegotiations between Revertera and Armand, other tentative efforts\r\nwere made. For instance, the interviews already alluded to between the\r\nAmbassador Mennsdorff and General Smuts, which were referred to in\r\nthe English Parliament. I do not consider it right to say more about\r\nthe matter here. But I can and will repeat the point of view which was\r\nat the bottom of all our peace efforts since the summer of 1917, and\r\nwhich finally wrecked them all.\r\n\r\nThe last report cited reflected the views of the Entente quite\r\ncorrectly. With Germany there was at present no possibility of\r\nintercourse. France insisted on the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine,\r\nand the entire Entente demanded the abolition of German militarism.\r\nNeither would Germany be allowed to retain her colonies. But Germany\r\nwas not yet \"ripe\" for this demand to be made. In the opinion of the\r\nEntente, therefore, any debate on the subject would be useless. For us\r\nthe case was different. The impression prevailed that we could\r\nconclude a separate peace providing we were ready to make sacrifices.\r\nThe London terms had created a situation which must be accepted.\r\nConcessions to Roumania, the cession of Trieste and the Trentino, as\r\nwell as the German South Tyrol, to Italy, and concessions to the\r\nSouthern Slav state would be unavoidable, besides reforms in the\r\nMonarchy on a federal basis. Our answer was that a one-sided\r\nconcession of Austro-Hungarian and German territory in that form was,\r\nnaturally, not possible. But still we thought that, under certain\r\npremises in the territorial questions, an agreement might perhaps not\r\nmeet with insurmountable difficulties. As a matter of course, however,\r\nthe Entente were not in a position to make terms such as could only be\r\nlaid down by the victor to the vanquished, as we were anything but\r\nbeaten, but, in spite of that, we did not cling so firmly to the\r\nfrontier posts in the Monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought, therefore, that, the Entente being willing, a\r\nsettlement of the various interests would be possible; but proposals\r\nsuch as the giving up of Trieste, Bozen, and Meran were impossible, as\r\nwas also the suggestion to make peace behind Germany's back. I\r\nreferred to the military situation and the impossibility of anyone\r\naccepting these views of the Entente. I was full of confidence in the\r\nfuture, and even if that were not the case I could not conclude a\r\npeace in the present situation which the Entente could not dictate in\r\nother terms, even if we were beaten. To lose Trieste and access to the\r\nAdriatic was a totally unacceptable condition, just as much as the\r\nunconditional surrender of Alsace-Lorraine.\r\n\r\nNeutral statesmen agreed with my views that the Entente demands were\r\nnot couched in the terms of a peace of understanding, but of victory.\r\nOpinion in neutral countries was quite clear on the subject. But in\r\nEngland especially there were various currents of thought; not\r\neveryone shared Lloyd George's views. The main point was, however, to\r\nlead up to a debate which would tend to clear up many matters, and I\r\nseized the idea eagerly. The greatest difficulty, I was assured by\r\nsome, lay in the Entente's assertion that Germany had shown remarkable\r\nmilitary strength, but yet had not been adequately prepared for war;\r\nshe had not had sufficient stores either of raw materials or\r\nprovisions, and had not built sufficient U-boats. The Entente's idea\r\nwas that if peace were made now, Germany might perhaps accept even\r\nunfavourable conditions, but it would only be to gain time and make\r\nuse of the peace to draw breath before beginning a fresh war. She\r\nwould make up for loss of time and \"hit out again.\" The Entente,\r\ntherefore, considered the preliminary condition of any peace, or even\r\nof a discussion of terms, to be the certainty of the abolition of\r\nGerman militarism. I replied that nobody wished for more war, and that\r\nI agreed with the Entente that a guarantee in that connection must be\r\nsecured, but that a one-sided disarmament and disbanding of men by\r\nAustria-Hungary and Germany was an impossibility. It might be imagined\r\nwhat it would be like if one fine day an army, far advanced in the\r\nenemy country, full of confidence and hope and certain of victory, had\r\nto lay down arms and disappear. No one could accept such a proposal.\r\nMeanwhile, a general disarmament of all the Powers was both possible\r\nand necessary. Disarmament, the establishment of courts of arbitration\r\nunder international control: that, according to my idea, would present\r\nan acceptable basis. I mentioned my fears that the Entente rulers in\r\nthis, as in the territorial question, would not mete out the same\r\nmeasure to themselves as they intended for us, and unless I had some\r\nguarantee in the matter I should not be in a position to carry the\r\nplan through here and with our Allies; anyhow, it would be worth a\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nLong and frequent were the debates on the Central European question,\r\nwhich was the Entente's terror, as it implied an unlimited increase in\r\nGermany's power. In Paris and London it would presumably be preferred\r\nthat the Monarchy should be made independent of Germany, and any\r\nfurther advances to Berlin on the part of Vienna checked. We rejoined\r\nthat to us this was not a new Entente standpoint, but that the\r\nmutilation caused by the resolutions of the Pact of London forced us\r\nto investigate the matter. Apart from the question of honour and duty\r\nto the Alliance, as matters now stood, Germany was fighting almost\r\nmore for us than for herself. If Germany to-day, and we knew it,\r\nconcluded peace, she would lose Alsace-Lorraine and her military\r\nsuperiority on land; but we, with our territory, would have to pay the\r\nItalians, Serbians, and Roumanians for their part in the war.\r\n\r\nI heard it said on many sides that there were men in the Entente who\r\nreadily understood this point of view, but that the Entente nations\r\nwould do what they had intended. Italy had based her entry into the\r\nwar on promises from London. Roumania also had been given very solid\r\nassurances, and heroic Serbia must be compensated by Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina. Many, both in Paris and London, regretted the situation\r\nthat had arisen through the conference in London, but a treaty is a\r\ntreaty, and neither London nor Paris could forsake their Allies.\r\nMeanwhile, it was thought likely in Entente circles that both the new\r\nSerbian and Polish states, probably Roumania as well, would have\r\ncertain relations with the Monarchy. Further details respecting such\r\nrelations were still unknown. Our reply was: we would not give up\r\nGalicia to Poland, Transylvania and the Bukovina to Roumania, and\r\nBosnia together with Herzegovina to Serbia, in return for a vague\r\npromise of the closer relations of those states with the pitiful\r\nremains left to us of the Monarchy. We were not impelled thereto by\r\ndynastic interests. I myself had persuaded the Emperor to sacrifice\r\nGalicia to Poland; but in Transylvania there lived so many Germans and\r\nMagyars who simply could not be made a present of, and above all the\r\nconcessions, to Italy! I once asked a neutral statesman if he could\r\nunderstand what was meant by making Austria voluntarily give up the\r\narch-German Tyrol as far as the Brenner Pass. The storm that would be\r\nlet loose by such a peace would uproot more than merely the Minister\r\nwho had made the peace. I told my visitor that there were certain\r\nsacrifices which on no conditions could be expected of any living\r\nbeing. I would not give up German Tyrol, not even though we were still\r\nmore unfavourably situated. I reminded him of a picture that\r\nrepresented wolves chasing a sledge. One by one the driver threw out\r\nfur, coat, and whatever else he had to the pack to check them and save\r\nhimself--but he could not throw his own child to them: rather would he\r\nsuffer to the last gasp. That was how I felt about Trieste and the\r\nGerman Tyrol. We were not in the position of the man in the sledge,\r\nfor, thank God, we had our arms and could beat off the wolves; but\r\neven in the extremest emergency, never would I accept a peace that\r\ndeprived us of Bozen and Meran.\r\n\r\nMy listener did not disagree with my argument, but could see no end to\r\nthe war in that way. England was ready to carry on the war for another\r\nten years and, in any case, would crush Germany. Not the German\r\npeople, for whom no hatred was felt--always the same repetition of\r\nthat deceptive argument--but German militarism. England was in a\r\ncondition of constraint. Repeatedly it had been said that if Germany\r\nwere not defeated in this war she would continue with still more\r\nextensive armaments. That was the firm belief in London; she would\r\nthen, in a few years, have not 100, but 1,000, U-boats, and then\r\nEngland would be lost. Then England was also fighting for her own\r\nexistence, and her will was iron. She knew the task would be a hard\r\none, but it would not crush her. In London they cite again the\r\nexample of the wars of Napoleon, and conclude with: \"What man has done\r\nman can do again.\"\r\n\r\nThis fear of Prussian militarism was noticeable on all occasions, and\r\nthe suggestion constantly was put forward that if we were to declare\r\nourselves satisfied with a general disarmament, that in itself would\r\nbe a great advantage and an important step towards peace.\r\n\r\nMy speech on October 2, 1917, at Budapest, on the necessity of\r\nsecuring a reorganised world was prompted by the argument that\r\nmilitarism was the greatest obstacle in the way of any advance in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAt Budapest on that occasion I was addressing an audience of party\r\nleaders. I had to take into consideration that too pacifist a tone\r\nwould have an effect at home and abroad contrary to my purpose. At\r\nhome the lesser powers of resistance would be still further paralysed,\r\nand abroad it would be taken as the end of our capacity for fighting,\r\nand would further check all friendly intentions.\r\n\r\nThe passage in my speech relating to the securing of a new world\r\norganisation is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  The great French statesman, Talleyrand, is supposed to have said:\r\n  words are merely to conceal thoughts. It may be that it was true\r\n  respecting the diplomacy of his century, but I cannot imagine a\r\n  maxim less suited to the present day. The millions who are\r\n  fighting, whether in the trenches or behind the lines, wish to\r\n  know why and wherefore they are fighting. They have a right to\r\n  know why peace, which all the world is longing for, has not yet\r\n  been made.\r\n\r\n  When I entered upon office I seized the first opportunity openly\r\n  to state that we should commit no violence, but that we should\r\n  tolerate none, and that we were ready to enter into peace\r\n  negotiations as soon as our enemies accepted the point of view of\r\n  a peace of understanding. I think I have thus clearly explained,\r\n  though on broad lines only, the peace idea of the Austro-Hungarian\r\n  Monarchy. Many at home and also in friendly countries abroad have\r\n  reproached me for speaking so openly. The arguments of the said\r\n  critical gentlemen have only confirmed my belief in the justness\r\n  of my views. I take nothing back of what I said, convinced as I am\r\n  that the great majority of people here and in Austria approve my\r\n  attitude. Following on these introductory remarks, I feel called\r\n  upon to-day to tell the public how the Imperial and Royal\r\n  Government will deal with the further development of the utterly\r\n  distorted European conditions.\r\n\r\n  Our programme for the reconstruction of the world organisation,\r\n  preferably to be called the building of a new world organisation,\r\n  is given in our answer to the peace Note of the Holy Father. It,\r\n  therefore, only remains for me to-day to complete the programme\r\n  and, above all, to state what were the considerations that decided\r\n  us to accept the principles that overthrow the former system. It\r\n  will come as a surprise to many, and perhaps appear\r\n  incomprehensible, that the Central Powers, and especially\r\n  Austria-Hungary, should be willing to desist from future military\r\n  armament, as it is only their military power that has protected\r\n  them through these trying years against vastly superior forces.\r\n\r\n  Not only has the war created new factors and conditions, but it\r\n  has also led to new conceptions which have shattered the\r\n  foundations of former European policy. Among many other political\r\n  theses, the one which held that Austria-Hungary was an expiring\r\n  state has vanished. The dogma of the impending collapse of the\r\n  Monarchy was what made our position in Europe more difficult and\r\n  caused all the misunderstanding concerning our vital needs. But\r\n  having shown ourselves in this war to be thoroughly sound and, at\r\n  any rate, of equal standing, it follows that we can reckon now on\r\n  a proper understanding of our vital needs in Europe and that no\r\n  hopes are left of being able to beat us down by force of arms.\r\n  Until the moment had arrived when this could be proved, we could\r\n  not do without the protection of armaments nor expose ourselves to\r\n  unfavourable treatment in the matters vital to us produced by the\r\n  legend of our impending collapse. But from that moment, we have\r\n  been in the position simultaneously with our enemies to lay down\r\n  arms and settle our difficulties peacefully and by arbitration.\r\n  This being recognised by the world affords us the possibility of\r\n  not only accepting the plan of disarmament and a court of\r\n  arbitration, but, as you, gentlemen, are aware, of working with\r\n  all our energy for its realisation, as we have for some time past.\r\n\r\n  After this war Europe must without doubt be placed on a new\r\n  political basis, the permanency of which can be guaranteed. This\r\n  basis will, I believe, be of a fourfold nature:\r\n\r\n  In the first place, it must furnish a guarantee that there shall\r\n  be no war of revenge on any side; we must make sure that we can\r\n  bequeath to our children's children the knowledge that they will\r\n  be spared the horrors of a time similar to that which we have\r\n  undergone. No shifting of power in the belligerent states can\r\n  achieve that. The only manner by which it can be attained is\r\n  international disarmament throughout the world and acceptance of\r\n  the principle of arbitration. It is needless to say that these\r\n  measures for disarmament must not be confined to one separate\r\n  state or to a single group of Powers, and that they apply equally\r\n  to land, water and air. War as a factor in policy must be\r\n  combated. A general, uniform and progressive disarmament of all\r\n  states in the world must be established on an international basis\r\n  and under international control, and the defensive forces limited\r\n  to the utmost. I am well aware that this object will be difficult\r\n  to achieve and that the path that leads thereto is long and thorny\r\n  and full of difficulties. And yet I am firmly convinced it is a\r\n  path that must be trodden and will be trodden, no matter whether\r\n  it is approved of individuals or not. It is a great mistake to\r\n  imagine that after such a war the world can begin from where it\r\n  left off in 1914. A catastrophe such as this war does not pass by\r\n  and leave no trace, and the most terrible misfortune that could\r\n  happen to us would be if the race for armaments were to continue\r\n  after the conclusion of peace, for it would mean the economic ruin\r\n  of all states. Before the war began the military burdens to be\r\n  borne were heavy--though we specially note that Austria-Hungary\r\n  was far from being on a high level of military preparedness when\r\n  we were surprised by the outbreak of war, and it was only during\r\n  the war that she resumed her armaments--but after this war an open\r\n  competition in armaments would render state burdens all round\r\n  simply intolerable. In order to keep a high standard of armaments\r\n  in open competition all the states would have to secure a tenfold\r\n  supply of everything--ten times the artillery, munition factories,\r\n  vessels and U-boats of former days, and also many more soldiers to\r\n  work the machinery. The annual military budget of all the Great\r\n  Powers would comprise many milliards--it would be impossible with\r\n  all the other burdens which the belligerent states will have to\r\n  bear after peace is concluded. This expense, I repeat, would mean\r\n  the ruin of the nations. To return, however, to the relatively\r\n  limited armaments in existence previous to 1914 would be quite\r\n  impossible for any individual state, which would be so far behind\r\n  that its military strength would not count. The expense incurred\r\n  would be futile. But were it possible to return to the relatively\r\n  low level of armaments in 1914, that in itself would signify an\r\n  international lowering of armaments. But then there would be no\r\n  sense in not going further and practically disarming altogether.\r\n\r\n  There is but one egress from this narrow defile: the absolute\r\n  international disarmament of the world. There is no longer any\r\n  object in such colossal fleets if the states of the world\r\n  guarantee the freedom of the seas, and armies must be reduced to\r\n  the lowest limit requisite for the maintenance of order in the\r\n  interior. This will only be possible on an international basis;\r\n  that is, under international control. Every state will have to\r\n  cede some of its independence to ensure a world peace. The present\r\n  generation will probably not live to see this great pacifist\r\n  movement fully completed. It cannot be carried out rapidly, but I\r\n  consider it our duty to put ourselves at the head of the movement\r\n  and do all that lies in human power to hasten its achievement. The\r\n  conclusion of peace will establish the fundamental principles.\r\n\r\n  If the first principle be laid down as the compulsory\r\n  international arbitration system as well as general disarmament on\r\n  land, the second one must be that of the freedom of the high seas\r\n  and disarmament at sea. I purposely say the high seas, as I do not\r\n  extend the idea to straits or channels, and I readily allow that\r\n  special rules and regulations must be laid down for the connecting\r\n  sea routes. If these first two factors have been settled and\r\n  assured, any reason for territorial adjustments on the plea of\r\n  ensuring national safety is done away with, and this forms the\r\n  third fundamental principle of the new international basis. This\r\n  idea is the gist of the beautiful and sublime Note that His\r\n  Holiness the Pope addressed to the whole world. We have not gone\r\n  to war to make conquests, and we have no aggressive plans. If the\r\n  international disarmament that we so heartily are longing for be\r\n  adopted by our present enemies and becomes a fact, then we are in\r\n  no need of assurances of territorial safety; in that case, we can\r\n  give up the idea of expanding the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy,\r\n  provided, of course, that the enemy has entirely evacuated our own\r\n  territory.\r\n\r\n  The fourth principle to enforce in order to ensure a free and\r\n  peaceful development of the world after the hard times we have\r\n  experienced is the free economic participation by everyone and the\r\n  unconditional avoidance of an economic war; a war of that nature\r\n  must be excluded from all future contingencies. Before we conclude\r\n  peace we must have the positive assurance that our present enemies\r\n  have given up that idea.\r\n\r\n  Those, my honourable friends, are the principles of the new world\r\n  organisation as it presents itself to me, and they are all based\r\n  on general disarmament. Germany, in her answer to the Papal Note,\r\n  has also positively recognised the idea of a general disarmament.\r\n  Our present enemies have likewise, partly at any rate, adopted\r\n  these principles. I differ from Lloyd George in most points, but\r\n  agree thoroughly on one--that there nevermore should be a war of\r\n  revenge.\r\n\r\nThe impression made by my speech on the Entente surpassed the most\r\npessimistic expectations. In order not to approach too closely the\r\nsubject of their own disarmament, my propositions were said to be\r\nhypocritical and a peace trap. This needs no comment.\r\n\r\nHad the Entente replied that I must obtain the support of and secure a\r\nguarantee from Germany that she would disarm, it would have been an\r\nopportunity for me, with the help of the nations, to exercise the\r\ngreatest possible pressure on Germany's leaders. But the sword was\r\nknocked out of my hand by the Entente themselves, for the retort came\r\nfrom Berlin: Here is the proof that the Entente rejects our offer of\r\ndisarmament as they reject everything coming from us. There is only\r\none way out of it--a fight to the end and then victory.\r\n\r\nAgain did the Entente force the peoples of the Central Powers to side\r\nunconditionally with the generals.\r\n\r\nNever in the whole term of my office did I receive so many letters as\r\nafter my speech--both for and against, with both sides equally\r\nimpetuous. \"Death sentences\" from Germany were showered on me; scorn\r\nand contempt alternated with genuine sympathy and agreement.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1917 the peace movement diminished visibly. The\r\nU-boat fiasco was very obvious. England saw that she was able to\r\novercome the danger. The German military leaders still spoke of the\r\npositively expected successes of their submarines, but the tenor of\r\ntheir predictions became very different. There was no longer any talk\r\nof the downfall of England within a few months. A new winter campaign\r\nwas almost a certainty, and yet the Germans insisted that though\r\nmistakes occurred in the term fixed, this was not so respecting the\r\nultimate effect of the U-boats and that England would collapse. The\r\nU-boat warfare had achieved this amount of success, that the Western\r\nfront remained intact, though it would otherwise have fallen.\r\n\r\nThe military situation underwent a change in the autumn. The end of\r\nthe war in the East was within sight, and the possibility of being\r\nable to fling the enormous masses of troops from the East into the\r\nline in the West, and at last break through there, greatly improved\r\nthe situation.\r\n\r\nIt was not on the sea that the U-boat campaign had brought about a\r\ndecision, but it enabled a final decision on land to be made; such was\r\nthe new military opinion. Paris and Calais could not be taken.\r\n\r\nIn these different phases of military hopes and expectation we floated\r\nlike a boat on a stormy sea. In order to land in the haven of peace,\r\nwe needed a military wave to carry us nearer to the land; then only\r\ncould we unfurl the sail of understanding that would help us to reach\r\nthe saving shores. As long as the enemy persisted only in dealing with\r\nthe crushed and depopulated Central Powers all was in vain.\r\n\r\nI never believed in the success of the U-boat warfare. I believed in a\r\nbreak-through on the Western front, and during the winter of 1917-1918\r\nlived in the hope that by such means we might break the obstinate love\r\nof destruction in our enemies.\r\n\r\nAs long as our adversaries' peace terms remained the same peace was\r\nimpossible, as was also the bringing of any outside pressure to bear\r\non Germany, for it was true that \"the German army was fighting more to\r\nsupport Austria-Hungary than it was for its own existence.\"\r\n\r\nThreatening and breathing disaster, the decisions of the Pact of\r\nLondon confronted us. They forced us always to take up arms again, and\r\ndrove us back into the field.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing these lines, in June, 1919, Austria has long\r\nceased to exist. There is only left now a small, impoverished,\r\nwretched land called German-Austria, a country without army or money;\r\nhelpless, starving, and wellnigh in despair. This country has been\r\ntold of the peace terms at St. Germain. It has been told it must give\r\nup the Tyrol as to be handed over to Italy. And defenceless and\r\nhelpless as it is, it sends up a cry of despair and frantic grief. One\r\nvoice only is heard--such peace is impossible!\r\n\r\nHow could an Austrian Government accept the dictates of London at a\r\ntime when our armies stood far advanced in enemy country, unvanquished\r\nand unbroken, when we had for Ally the strongest land Power in the\r\nworld, and when the greatest generals of the war so firmly believed in\r\nthe break-through and in final victory?\r\n\r\nTo demand that in 1917 or 1918 I should have accepted peace terms\r\nwhich in 1919 were rejected by the whole of the German-Austrian people\r\nis sheer madness. But it may be there is method in such madness. The\r\nmethod of using every means to discredit the \"old régime.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of August, 1917, an effort was made at a\r\n_rapprochement_ between England and Germany which, unfortunately,\r\nalmost immediately broke down.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of England a neutral Power had sounded Germany with\r\nregard to Belgium. Germany replied that she was ready for direct\r\nverbal negotiations with England on the Belgian question. In\r\ntransmitting this favourable answer, Germany did not entrust it to the\r\nsame neutral Power that had brought the message, but for some unknown\r\nreason confided it to a trusted messenger from another neutral\r\ncountry. This latter appears to have been guilty of some indiscreet\r\ndealings, and when rumours of the affair reached Paris it caused some\r\nanxiety. It was probably thought there that England was more\r\ninterested in the Belgian than in the Alsace-Lorraine question.\r\n\r\nThe messenger sent from Berlin thought that his task had failed, and\r\nsent word to Berlin that, owing to his errand having been made known,\r\nthe opinion among the Entente was that every step taken by Germany was\r\ncondemned beforehand to failure.\r\n\r\nThe Government which had employed the messenger took up the case on\r\nits own initiative, and transmitted the German reply to London. No\r\nanswer was ever received from England.\r\n\r\nThis is the account as given to me _post festum_ by Berlin, and\r\ndoubtless reflects Berlin's views. Whether the incident in detail was\r\nexactly as described, or whether many more hitherto unknown events\r\ntook place, has not been proved.\r\n\r\nDuring the war all happenings on the other side of the trenches were\r\nlooked upon with dim and gloomy eyes as through a veil, and, according\r\nto news received by me later, it was not clear whether England had\r\nsent an answer. Whether it was dispatched and held up on the way, or\r\nwhat became of it I never knew. It is said never to have reached\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nA warlike speech by Asquith on September 27 appears to be connected\r\nwith this unsuccessful attempt, and served to calm the Allies.\r\n\r\nIt appears extremely doubtful to me, however, whether this advance\r\nwould have led to anything, had the occasion been more favourable. The\r\npreviously mentioned letter of the Imperial Chancellor Michaelis dates\r\nfrom those August days, a letter referring to Belgian projects which\r\nwere very far removed from the English ideas on the subject. And even\r\nif it had been possible to settle the Belgian question, there would\r\nhave been that of Alsace-Lorraine, which linked France and England\r\ntogether, and, first and foremost, the question of disarmament. The\r\nchasm that divided the two camps would have grown so wide that no\r\nbridge could possibly have spanned it.\r\n\r\nNot until January, 1918, did I learn the English version. According to\r\nthat, the Germans are said to have taken the first steps, and the\r\nEnglish were not disinclined to listen, but heard nothing further. It\r\nwas stated in _Vorwärts_ that the suggestion was made at the\r\ninstigation of the Cabinet Council, but that subsequently military\r\ninfluence gained the upper hand. The episode did not tend to improve\r\nthe frame of mind of the leading men in England.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1917 conditions seemed favourable for peace and\r\nthe hope of arriving at an understanding, though still far distant,\r\nwas not exactly a Utopian dream. How far the hope of splitting our\r\ngroup and the failure of the U-boat warfare may have contributed to\r\nstiffen the desire for war in the Entente countries cannot definitely\r\nbe stated. Both factors had a share in it. Before we came to a\r\ndeadlock in the negotiations, the position was such that even in case\r\nof a separate peace we should have been compelled to accept the terms\r\nof the conference of London. Whether the Entente would have abandoned\r\nthat basis if we had not veered from the straight course, and by\r\nunofficial cross-purposes become caught in the toils of separatist\r\ndesires, but had quickly and consistently carried out our task, is not\r\nproved, and never will be. After the débâcle in the winter of 1918-19\r\nit was intimated to me as a fact that when Clemenceau came into power\r\na peace of understanding with Germany became out of the question. His\r\nstandpoint was that Germany must be definitely vanquished and crushed.\r\nOur negotiations, however, had begun under Briand, and Clemenceau only\r\ncame into power when the peace negotiations had become entangled and\r\nwere beginning to falter.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Austria-Hungary, both France and England would have\r\nwelcomed a separate peace on our part, even during Clemenceau's period\r\nof office; but in that case we should have had to accept the terms of\r\nthe London conference.\r\n\r\nSuch was the peace question then. How it would have developed if no\r\nmisleading policy had come into being naturally cannot be stated.\r\n\r\nI am not putting forward suppositions but confirming facts. And the\r\nfact remains that the failure of the U-boat campaign on the one hand,\r\nand a policy carried on behind the backs of the responsible men on the\r\nother hand, were the reasons why the favourable moment passed and the\r\npeace efforts were checked. And I herewith repeat that this fact does\r\nnot in itself prove that peace negotiations would not also have failed\r\nlater if the two reasons mentioned above had not existed.\r\n\r\nIt became quite clear in the autumn that the war would have to\r\ncontinue. In my speeches to delegations I endeavoured to leave no\r\ndoubt that we were faithful to our Allies. When I said \"I see no\r\ndifference between Strassburg and Trieste,\" I said it chiefly for\r\nSofia and Constantinople, for the overthrow of the Quadruple Alliance\r\nwas the greatest danger. I still hoped to be able to prop the\r\ntrembling foundations of the Alliance policy, and either to secure a\r\ngeneral peace in the East, where the military opposition was giving\r\nway, or to see it draw nearer through the anticipated German\r\nbreak-through on the Western front.\r\n\r\nSeveral months after my dismissal in the summer of 1918 I spoke in the\r\nHerrenhaus on foreign policy, and warned everyone present against\r\ntrying to undermine the Quadruple Alliance. When I declared that\r\n\"honour, duty to the Alliance, and the call for self-preservation\r\ncompel us to fight by the side of Germany,\" I was misunderstood. It\r\ndid not seem as though the public realised that the moment the Entente\r\nthought the Quadruple Alliance was about to break up, from that moment\r\nour cause was lost. Had the public no knowledge of the London\r\nagreement? Did they not know that a separate peace would hand us over\r\ntotally defenceless to those cruel conditions? Did they not realise\r\nthat the German army was the shield that afforded us the last and only\r\npossibility of escaping the fate of being broken up?\r\n\r\nMy successor steered the same course as I had done, doubtless from the\r\nsame reasons of honour and the call for self-preservation. I have no\r\nparticulars as to what occurred in the summer of 1918.\r\n\r\nAfterwards events followed in rapid succession. First came our\r\nterrible defeat in Italy, then the Entente break-through on the\r\nWestern front, and finally the Bulgarian secession, which had\r\ngradually been approaching since the summer of 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nAs is the case in all countries, among the Entente during the war\r\nthere were many and varied currents of thought. When Clemenceau came\r\ninto office the definite destruction of Germany was the dominant war\r\naim.\r\n\r\nTo those who neither see nor hear the secret information which a\r\nForeign Minister naturally has at his disposal, it may appear as\r\nthough the Entente, in the question of crushing Germany's military\r\nstrength, had sometimes been ready to make concessions. I think that\r\nthis may have been the case in the spring of 1917, but not later, when\r\nany such hope was deceptive. Lansdowne in particular spoke and wrote\r\nin a somewhat friendly tone, but Lloyd George was the determining\r\ninfluence in England.\r\n\r\nWhen sounding England on different occasions, I endeavoured to\r\ndiscover by what means the dissolution of the military power in\r\nGermany was to be or could be guaranteed--and I invariably came to an\r\n_impasse_. It was never explained how England intended to carry out\r\nthe proposal.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there is no way of disarming a strong and determined\r\npeople except by defeating them, but such an aim was not to be openly\r\nadmitted to us in the preliminary dealings. The delegates could not\r\nsuggest any suitable mode of discussion, and no other proposals could\r\nlead to a decision.\r\n\r\nLansdowne, and perhaps Asquith as well, would have been content with a\r\nparliamentary régime which would have deprived the Emperor of power\r\nand given it to the Reichstag. Not so Lloyd George; at least, not\r\nlater. The English Prime Minister's well-known speech, \"A disarmament\r\ntreaty with Germany would be a treaty between a fox and many geese,\"\r\nconveyed what he really thought.\r\n\r\nAfter my Budapest speech, which was treated with such scorn and\r\ncontempt in the Press and by public opinion on the other side of the\r\nChannel, word was sent to me from an English source that it was said\r\nthe \"Czernin scheme\" might settle the question. But again it was not\r\nLloyd George who said that.\r\n\r\nOwing to the extreme distrust that Clemenceau, the English Prime\r\nMinister, and with them the great majority in France and England, had\r\nof Germany's intentions, no measure could be devised that would have\r\ngiven London and Paris a sufficient guarantee for a future peaceful\r\npolicy. From the summer of 1917, no matter what Germany had proposed,\r\nLloyd George would always have rejected it as inadequate.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this it was quite immaterial later to the course of\r\nthe war that Germany not only did nothing whatever to allay English\r\nfears, but, on the contrary, poured oil in the fire and fanned the\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nGermany, the leading military Power in the war, never for one moment\r\nthought of agreeing to disarmament under international control. After\r\nmy speech in Budapest I was received in Berlin not in an unfriendly\r\nmanner, but with a sort of pity, as some poor insane person might be\r\ntreated. The subject was avoided as much as possible. Erzberger alone\r\ntold me of his complete agreement with me.\r\n\r\nHad Germany been victorious her militarism would have increased\r\nenormously. In the summer of 1917 I spoke to several generals of high\r\nstanding on the Western front, who unanimously declared that after the\r\nwar armaments must be maintained, but on a very much greater scale.\r\nThey compared this war with the first Punic War. It would be continued\r\nand its continuation be prepared for; in short, the tactics of\r\nVersailles. The standard of violence must be planted, and would be the\r\nbanner of the generals, the Pan-Germans, the Fatherland Party, etc.\r\netc. They thought as little about a reconciliation of the nations\r\nafter the war as did the Supreme Council of Four at Versailles, and\r\nEmperor, Government and Reichstag floundered helplessly in this\r\ntorrent of violent purpose.\r\n\r\nThe military spirit flourished on the Spree as it is doing now on the\r\nSeine and the Thames. Lloyd George and Unter den Linden in Berlin.\r\nThe only difference between Foch and Ludendorff is that the one is a\r\nFrenchman and the other a German; as men they are as like as two peas.\r\n\r\nThe Entente is victorious, and many millions are delighted and declare\r\nthat the policy of Might is justified. The future only can show\r\nwhether this is not a terrible mistake. The lives of hundreds of\r\nthousands of young, hopeful men who have fallen might have been saved\r\nif in 1917 peace had been made possible for us. The triumph of victory\r\ncannot call them back to life again. It appears to me that the Entente\r\nhas conquered too much, too thoroughly. The madness of expiring\r\nmilitarism, in spite of all its orgies, has perhaps celebrated its\r\nlast triumph at Versailles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPostscript.\r\n\r\nTaking it altogether, the real historical truth concerning the peace\r\nmovement is that, in general, neither the Entente nor the ruling,\r\nall-powerful military party in Germany wished for a peace of\r\nunderstanding. They both wished to be victorious and to enforce a\r\npeace of violence on the defeated adversary. The leading men in\r\nGermany--Ludendorff above all--never had a genuine intention of\r\nreleasing Belgium in an economic and political sense; neither would\r\nthey agree to any sacrifices. They wished to conquer in the East and\r\nthe West, and their arbitrary tendencies counteracted the pacifist\r\nleaning of the Entente as soon as there were the slightest indications\r\nof it. On the other hand, the leading men in the Entente--Clemenceau\r\nfrom the first and Lloyd George later--were firmly resolved to crush\r\nGermany, and therefore profited by the continuous German threats to\r\nsuppress all pacifist movements in their own countries, always ready\r\nto prove that a peace of understanding with Berlin would be a \"pact\r\nbetween the fox and the geese.\"\r\n\r\nThanks to the attitude of the leading Ministers in Germany, the\r\nEntente was fully persuaded that an understanding with Germany was\r\nquite out of the question, and insisted obstinately on peace terms\r\nwhich could not be accepted by a Germany still unbeaten. This closes\r\nthe _circular vitiosus_ which paralysed all negotiating activities.\r\n\r\n_We_ were wedged in between these two movements and unable to strike\r\nout for ourselves, because the Entente, bound by their promises to\r\ntheir Allies, had already disposed of us by the Pact of London and the\r\nundertakings to Roumania and Serbia. We therefore _could_ not exercise\r\nextreme pressure on Germany, as we were unable to effect the annulment\r\nof those treaties.\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1917 the possibility of an understanding\r\n_seemed_ to show itself on the horizon, but it was wrecked by the\r\npreviously mentioned events.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Helfferich's _exposé_ is reproduced in the Appendix. (See p. 288.)\r\n\r\n[9] At this time I did not know that my secret report to the Emperor\r\nwas handed over to Herr Erzberger and not kept secret by him. (Later it\r\nwas made public through the revelations of Count Wedel.)\r\n\r\n[10] The disclosures made by Count Wedel and Helfferich concerning\r\nErzberger are only a link in the chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWILSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the dwindling away of the inclination for peace in the enemy\r\ncamp we were faced in the autumn of 1917 by the prospect either of\r\nconcluding separate peace and accepting the many complicated\r\nconsequences of a war with Germany and the ensuing mutilation of the\r\nMonarchy under the terms of the Pact of London, or else fighting on\r\nand, aided by our Allies, breaking the will for destruction of our\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nIf Russia was the one to let loose war, it was Italy who perpetually\r\nstood in the way of a peace of understanding, insisting upon obtaining\r\nunder all circumstances the whole of the Austrian territory promised\r\nto her in 1915. The Entente during the war assigned the several parts\r\nto be enacted. France was to shed the most blood; England, besides her\r\nfabulous military action, to finance the war, together with America,\r\nand diplomatic affairs to be in Italy's hands. Far too little is known\r\nas yet, and will only later be public knowledge, as to the extent to\r\nwhich Italian diplomacy dominated affairs during the war. Our\r\nvictories in Italy would only have changed the situation if the\r\ndefeats that were suffered had led to an Italian revolution and a\r\ncomplete overthrow of the régime existing there. In other words, the\r\nRoyal Government would not be influenced in its attitude by our\r\nvictories. Even had our armies advanced much farther than they did, it\r\nwould have held to its standpoint in the expectation that, perhaps not\r\nItaly herself, but her Allies, would secure final victory.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation in the autumn of 1917 when Wilson came forward\r\nwith his Fourteen Points.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the Wilson programme in the eyes of the whole world\r\nwas its violent contrast to the terms of the Pact of London. The right\r\nof self-determination for the nations had been utterly ignored in\r\nLondon by the allotment of German Tyrol to Italy. Wilson forbade this\r\nand declared that nations could not be treated against their will and\r\nmoved hither and thither like the pieces in a game of chess. Wilson\r\nsaid that every solution of a territorial question arising out of this\r\nwar must be arrived at in the interests and in favour of the peoples\r\nconcerned, and not as a mere balancing or compromise of claims from\r\nrival sources; and further, that all clearly stated national claims\r\nwould receive the utmost satisfaction that could be afforded them,\r\nwithout admitting new factors or the perpetuation of old disputes or\r\noppositions, which in all probability would soon again disturb the\r\npeace of Europe and the whole world. A general peace, established on\r\nsuch a basis could be discussed--and more in the same strain.\r\n\r\nThe publication of this clear and absolutely acceptable programme\r\nseemed from day to day to render possible a peaceful solution of the\r\nworld conflict. In the eyes of millions of people this programme\r\nopened up a world of hope. A new star had risen on the other side of\r\nthe ocean, and all eyes were turned in that direction. A mighty man\r\nhad come forward and with one powerful act had upset the London\r\nresolutions and, in so doing, had reopened the gates for a peace of\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment the main question was, so it seemed, what hopes\r\nwere there of Wilson's programme being carried out in London, Paris\r\nand, above all, in Rome?\r\n\r\nSecret information sent to me from the Entente countries seemed to\r\nsuggest that the Fourteen Points were decidedly not drawn up in\r\nagreement with England, France and Italy. On the other hand I was, and\r\nstill am, fully persuaded that Wilson had spoken honestly and\r\nsincerely and, as a matter of fact, believed that his programme could\r\nbe carried out.\r\n\r\nWilson's great miscalculation was his mistaken estimate of the actual\r\ndistribution of power in the Entente on the one hand, and his\r\nsurprising ignorance of national relationships in Europe, and\r\nespecially in Austria-Hungary, on the other hand, which would greatly\r\nweaken his position and his influence on his Allies. There would be\r\nno difficulty in the Entente's cleverly introducing Wilson into the\r\ninternational labyrinth and there bewildering him with wrong\r\ndirections, so that he could not find his way out again. To begin\r\nwith, therefore, Wilson's theory brought us not a step further.\r\n\r\nThe '67 settlement was proposed by a leading German-Magyar magnate in\r\nAustria-Hungary. Fifty years ago nationalism was much less developed\r\nthan it is now. Nations were still sleeping--the Czechs, Slovaks and\r\nSouthern Slavs, the Roumanians and Ruthenians had barely awakened to\r\nnational life. Fifty years ago it was possible to distinguish between\r\nwhat was deceptive and what gave promise of lasting. The union between\r\nItalians and Germans only took effect with the coming of--or was\r\nperhaps the first sign of--the world-movement. At all events it was in\r\nthe second half of the last century that we came within the radius of\r\ninternational politics.\r\n\r\nThe world's racial problems found a centre in Austria-Hungary, whose\r\naffairs, therefore, became very prominent. A chemist can enclose in\r\nhis retorts different substances and observe how, following the\r\neternal laws of nature, the processes of nature take place. In a\r\nsimilar way during past decades the effect of unsolved racial\r\nantagonisms might have been studied within the Habsburg Monarchy and\r\nthe inevitable explosion anticipated, instead of its being allowed to\r\nculminate in the world war.\r\n\r\nIn putting forward his Fourteen Points Mr. Wilson obviously felt the\r\nnecessity of settling the world problem of nationality and recognised\r\nthat the Habsburg Monarchy, once arranged and settled, could serve as\r\na model to the world, as hitherto it had afforded a terrifying\r\nexample. But to begin with, he overlooked the fact that in the\r\nsettling of national questions there must be neither adversary nor\r\nally, as those reflect passing differences, whereas the problem of\r\nnationality is a permanent one. He also ignored the fact that what\r\napplies to the Czechs applies also to Ireland, that the Armenians as\r\nwell as the Ukrainians desire to live their own national life, and\r\nthat the coloured peoples of Africa and India are human beings with\r\nthe same rights as white people. He also failed to see that good will\r\nand the desire for justice are far from being sufficient in themselves\r\nto solve the problem of nationality. Thus it was that under his\r\npatronage, and presumably on the basis of the Fourteen Points, the\r\nquestion of nationality was not solved but simply turned round where\r\nnot actually left untouched. If Germans and Magyars had hitherto been\r\nthe dominating races they would now become the oppressed. By the terms\r\nsettled at Versailles they were to be handed over to states of other\r\nnationality. Ten years hence, perhaps sooner, both groups of Powers as\r\nthey exist at present will have fallen. Other constellations will have\r\nappeared and become dominant. The explosive power of unsolved\r\nquestions will continue to take effect and within a measurable space\r\nof time again blow up the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson, who evidently was acquainted with the programme of the\r\nPact of London, though not attaching sufficient importance to the\r\nnational difficulties, probably hoped to be able to effect a\r\ncompromise between the Italian policy of conquest and his own ideal\r\npolicy. In this connection, however, no bridge existed between Rome\r\nand Washington. Conquests are made by right of the conqueror--such was\r\nClemenceau's and Orlando's policy--or else the world is ruled on the\r\nprinciples of national justice, as Wilson wished it to be. This ideal,\r\nhowever, will not be attained--no ideal is attainable; but it will be\r\nbrought very much nearer. Might or Right, the one alone can conquer.\r\nBut Czechs, Poles and others cannot be freed while at the same time\r\nTyrolese-Germans, Alsatian-Germans and Transylvanian-Hungarians are\r\nhanded over to foreign states. It cannot be done from the point of\r\nview of justice or with any hope of its being permanent. Versailles\r\nand St. Germain have proved that it can be done by might, and as a\r\ntemporary measure.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the question of nationality was the point round which\r\nall Franz Ferdinand's political interests were centred during his\r\nlifetime. Whether he would have succeeded is another question, but he\r\ncertainly did try. The Emperor Charles, too, was not averse to the\r\nmovement. The Emperor Francis Joseph was too old and too conservative\r\nto make the experiment. His idea was _quieta non movere_. Without\r\npowerful help from outside any attempt during the war against the\r\nGerman-Magyar opposition would not have been feasible. Therefore, when\r\nWilson came forward with his Fourteen Points, and in spite of the\r\nscepticism with which the message from Washington was received by the\r\nGerman public and here too, I at once resolved to take up the thread.\r\n\r\nI repeat that I never doubted the honourable and sincere intentions\r\nentertained by Wilson--nor do I doubt them now--but my doubts as to\r\nhis powers of carrying them out were from the first very pronounced.\r\nIt was obvious that Wilson, when conducting the war, was much stronger\r\nthan when he took part in the Peace Conference. As long as fighting\r\nproceeded Wilson was master of the world. He had only to call back his\r\ntroops from the European theatre of war and the Entente would be\r\nplaced in a most difficult position. It has always been\r\nincomprehensible to me why the President of the United States did not\r\nhave recourse to this strong pressure during this time in order to\r\npreserve his own war aims.\r\n\r\nThe secret information that I received soon after the publication of\r\nthe Fourteen Points led me to fear that Wilson, not understanding the\r\nsituation, would fail to take any practical measures to secure respect\r\nfor the regulations he had laid down, and that he underestimated\r\nFrance's, and particularly Italy's, opposition. The logical and\r\npractical consequences of the Wilson programme would have been the\r\npublic annulment of the Pact of London; it must have been so for us to\r\nunderstand the principles on which we could enter upon peace\r\nnegotiations. Nothing of that nature occurred, and the gap between\r\nWilson's and Orlando's ideas of peace remained open.\r\n\r\nOn January 24, 1918, in the Committee of the Austrian Delegation, I\r\nspoke publicly on the subject of the Fourteen Points and declared them\r\nto be--in so far as they applied to us and not to our Allies--a\r\nsuitable basis for negotiations. Almost simultaneously we took steps\r\nto enlighten ourselves on the problem of how in a practical way the\r\nfourteen theoretical ideas of Wilson could be carried out. The\r\nnegotiations were then by no means hopeless.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Brest negotiations were proceeding. Although that\r\nepisode, which represented a victory for German militarism, cannot\r\nhave been very encouraging for Wilson, he was wise enough to recognise\r\nthat we were in an awkward position and that the charge brought\r\nagainst Germany that she was making hidden annexations did not apply\r\nto Vienna. On February 12--thus, _after_ the conclusion of the Brest\r\npeace--the President, in his speech to Congress, said:\r\n\r\n  Count Czernin appears to have a clear understanding of the peace\r\n  foundations and does not obscure their sense. He sees that an\r\n  independent Poland composed of all the undeniably Polish\r\n  inhabitants, the one bordering on the other, is a matter for\r\n  European settlement and must be granted; further, that Belgium\r\n  must be evacuated and restored, no matter what sacrifices and\r\n  concessions it may involve; also that national desires must be\r\n  satisfied, even in his own Empire, in the common interests of\r\n  Europe and humanity.\r\n\r\n  Though he is silent on certain matters more closely connected with\r\n  the interests of his Allies than with Austria-Hungary, that is\r\n  only natural, because he feels compelled under the circumstances\r\n  to defer to Germany and Turkey. Recognising and agreeing with the\r\n  important principles in question and the necessity of converting\r\n  them into action, he naturally feels that Austria-Hungary, more\r\n  easily than Germany, can concur with the war aims as expressed by\r\n  the United States. He would probably have gone even further had he\r\n  not been constrained to consider the Austro-Hungarian Alliance and\r\n  the country's dependence on Germany.\r\n\r\nIn the same speech the President goes on to say:\r\n\r\n  Count Czernin's answer referring mainly to my speech of January 8\r\n  is couched in very friendly terms. He sees in my statements a\r\n  sufficiently encouraging approach to the views of his own\r\n  Government to justify his belief that they afford a basis for a\r\n  thorough discussion by both Governments of the aims.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n  I must say Count Hertling's answer is very undecided and most\r\n  confusing, full of equivocal sentences, and it is difficult to say\r\n  what it aims at. It certainly is written in a very different tone\r\n  from that of Count Czernin's speech and obviously with a very\r\n  different object in view.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that when the head of a State at war with us\r\nspeaks in such friendly terms of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he\r\nhas the best intentions of coming to an understanding. My efforts in\r\nthis connection were interrupted by my dismissal.\r\n\r\nIn these last weeks during which I remained in office the Emperor had\r\ndefinitely lost faith in me. This was not due to the Wilson question,\r\nnor yet was it the direct consequence of my general policy. A\r\ndifference of opinion between certain persons in the Emperor's\r\nentourage and myself was the real reason. The situation became so\r\nstrained as to make it unbearable. The forces that conspired against\r\nme convinced me that it would be impossible for me to gain my\r\nobjective which, being of a very difficult nature, could not be\r\nobtained unless the Emperor gave me his full confidence.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the rumours and stories spread about me I do not\r\nintend to go into details unless I should be compelled to do so by\r\naccounts derived from reliable sources. I am still convinced to this\r\nday that morally I was perfectly right. I was wrong as to form,\r\nbecause I was neither clever nor patient enough to _bend_ the\r\nopposition, but would have _broken_ it, by reducing the situation to a\r\ncase of \"either--or\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nIMPRESSIONS AND REFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1917 I had a visit from a subject of a neutral state,\r\nwho is a pronounced upholder of general disarmament and world\r\npacifism. We began, of course, to discuss the theme of free\r\ncompetition in armaments, of militarism, which in England prevails on\r\nthe sea and in Germany on land, and my visitor entered upon the\r\nvarious possibilities likely to occur when the war was at an end. He\r\nhad no faith in the destruction of England, nor had I; but he thought\r\nit possible that France and Italy might collapse. The French and\r\nItalians could not possibly bear any heavier burdens than already were\r\nlaid on them; in Paris and Rome, he thought, revolution was not far\r\ndistant, and a fresh phase of the war would then ensue. England and\r\nAmerica would continue to fight on alone, for ten, perhaps even\r\ntwenty, years. England was not to be considered just a little island,\r\nbut comprised Australia, India, Canada, and the sea. \"_L'Angleterre\r\nest imbattable_,\" he repeated, and America likewise. On the other\r\nhand, the German army was also invincible. The secession of France and\r\nItaly would greatly hinder the cruel blockade, for the resources of\r\nthose two countries--once they were conquered by the Central\r\nPowers--were very vast, and in that case he could not see any end to\r\nthe war. Finally, the world would collapse from the general state of\r\nexhaustion. My visitor cited the fable in which two goats met on a\r\nnarrow bridge; neither would give way to the other, and they fought\r\nuntil they both fell into the water and were drowned. The victory of\r\none group as in previous wars, he continued, where the conqueror\r\ngleaned a rich harvest of gains and the vanquished had to bear all\r\nthe losses, was out of the question in this present war. _Tout le\r\nmonde perdra, et à la fin il n'y aura que des vaincus._\r\n\r\nI often recalled that interview later. Much that was false and yet, as\r\nit seemed to me, much that was true lay in my friend's words. France\r\nand Italy did not break down; the end of the war came quicker than he\r\nthought; and the invincible Germany was defeated. And still I think\r\nthat the conclusions he arrived at came very near the truth.\r\n\r\nThe conquerors' finances are in a very precarious state, particularly\r\nin Italy and France; unrest prevails; wages are exorbitant; discontent\r\nis general; the phantom of Bolshevism leers at them; and they live in\r\nthe hope that the defeated Central Powers will have to pay, and they\r\nwill thus be saved. It was set forth in the peace terms, but _ultra\r\nposse nemo tenetur_, and the future will show to what extent the\r\nCentral Powers can fulfil the conditions dictated to them.\r\n\r\nSince the opening of the Peace Congress at Versailles continuous war\r\nin Europe has been seen: Russians against the whole world, Czechs\r\nagainst Hungarians, Roumanians against Hungarians, Poles against\r\nUkrainians, Southern Slavs against Germans, Communists against\r\nSocialists. Three-fourths of Europe is turned into a witch's cauldron\r\nwhere everything is concocted except work and production, and it is\r\nfutile to ask how this self-lacerated Europe will be able to find the\r\nwar expenses laid upon her. According to human reckoning, the\r\nconquerors cannot extract even approximate compensation for their\r\nlosses from the defeated states, and their victory will terminate with\r\na considerable deficit. If that be the case, then my visitor will be\r\nright--there will only be the vanquished.\r\n\r\nIf our plan in 1917, namely, Germany to cede Alsace-Lorraine to France\r\nin exchange for the annexation of all Poland, together with Galicia,\r\nand all states to disarm; if that plan had been accepted in Berlin and\r\nsanctioned by the Entente--unless the _non possumus_ in Berlin and\r\nopposition in Rome to a change in the Pact of London had hindered any\r\naction--it seems to me the advantage would not only have been on the\r\nside of the Central Powers.\r\n\r\nPyrrhus also conquered at Asculum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy visitor was astonished at Vienna. The psychology of no city that he\r\nhad seen during the war could compare with that of Vienna. An amazing\r\napathy prevailed. In Paris there was a passionate demand for\r\nAlsace-Lorraine; in Berlin the contrary was demanded just as eagerly;\r\nin England the destruction of Germany was the objective; in Sofia the\r\nconquest of the Dobrudsha; in Rome they clamoured for all possible and\r\nimpossible things; in Vienna nothing at all was demanded. In Cracow\r\nthey called for a Great Poland; in Budapest for an unmolested Hungary;\r\nin Prague for a united Czech State; and in Innsbruck the descendants\r\nof Andreas Hofer were fighting as they did in his day for their sacred\r\nland, Tyrol. In Vienna they asked only for peace and quiet.\r\n\r\nOld men and children would fight the arch-enemy in Tyrol, but if the\r\nItalians were to enter Vienna and bring bread with them they would be\r\nreceived with shouts of enthusiasm. And yet Berlin and Innsbruck were\r\njust as hungry as Vienna. _C'est une ville sans âme._\r\n\r\nMy visitor compared the Viennese to a pretty, gay, and frivolous woman,\r\nwhose aim in life is pleasure and only pleasure. She must dance, sing,\r\nand enjoy life, and will do so under any circumstances--_sans âme_.\r\n\r\nThis pleasure-loving good nature of the Viennese has its admirable\r\npoints. For instance, all enemy aliens were better treated in Vienna\r\nthan anywhere else. Not the slightest trace of enmity was shown to\r\nthose who were the first to attack and then starve the city.\r\n\r\nStronger than anything else in Vienna was the desire for sensation,\r\npleasure, and a gay life. My friend once saw a piece acted at one of\r\nthe theatres in Vienna called, I believe, _Der Junge Medardus_. The\r\nscene is laid during the occupation of Vienna by Napoleon. Viennese\r\ncitizens condemned to death for intriguing with the enemy are led away\r\nby the French. In a most thrilling scene weeping women and children\r\nbid them farewell. A vast crowd witnesses the affair. A boy suddenly\r\nrushes in shouting: \"Napoleon is coming.\" The crowd hurries away to\r\nsee him, and cries of \"Long live Napoleon\" are heard in the distance.\r\n\r\nSuch was Vienna a hundred years ago, and it is still the same. _Une\r\nville sans âme._\r\n\r\nI pass on the criticism without comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nIn different circles which justly and unjustly intervened in politics\r\nduring my time of office, the plan was suggested of driving a wedge\r\nbetween North and South Germany, and converting the latter to the\r\npeaceful policy of Vienna in contradistinction to Prussian militarism.\r\n\r\nThe plan was a faulty one from the very first. To begin with, as\r\nalready stated, the most pronounced obstacle to peace was not only the\r\nPrussian spirit, but the Entente programme for our disruption, which a\r\ncloser connection with Bavaria and Saxony would not have altered.\r\nSecondly, Austria-Hungary, obviously falling more and more to pieces,\r\nformed no point of attraction for Munich and Dresden, who, though not\r\nPrussian, yet were German to the very backbone. The vague and\r\nirresponsible plan of returning to the conditions of the period before\r\n1866 was an anachronism. Thirdly and chiefly, all experiments were\r\ndangerous which might create the impression in the Entente that the\r\nQuadruple Alliance was about to be dissolved. In a policy of that\r\nnature executive ability was of supreme importance, and that was\r\nexactly what was usually lacking.\r\n\r\nThe plan was not without good features. The appointment of the\r\nBavarian Count Hertling to be Imperial Chancellor was not due to\r\nViennese influence, though a source of the greatest pleasure to us,\r\nand the fact of making a choice that satisfied Vienna played a great\r\npart with the Emperor William. Two Bavarians, Hertling and Kühlmann,\r\nhad taken over the leadership of the German Empire, and they, apart\r\nfrom their great personal qualities, presented a certain natural\r\ncounter-balance to Prussian hegemony through their Bavarian origin;\r\nbut only so far as it was still possible in general administration\r\nwhich then was in a disturbed state. But farther they could not go\r\nwithout causing injury.\r\n\r\nCount Hertling and I were on very good terms. This wise and\r\nclear-sighted old man, whose only fault was that he was too old and\r\nphysically incapable of offering resistance, would have saved Germany,\r\nif she possibly could have been saved, in 1917. In the rushing torrent\r\nthat whirled her away to her fall, he found no pillar to which he\r\ncould cling.\r\n\r\nLatterly his sight began to fail and give way. He suffered from\r\nfatigue, and the conferences and councils lasting often for hours and\r\nhours were beyond his strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPOLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nBy letters patent November 5, 1916, both the Emperors declared\r\nPoland's existence as a Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhen I came into office, I found the situation to be that the Poles\r\nwere annoyed with my predecessor because, they declared, Germany had\r\nwanted to cede the newly created kingdom of Poland to us, and Count\r\nBurian had rejected the offer. Apparently there is some\r\nmisunderstanding in this version of the case, as Burian says it is not\r\ncorrectly rendered.\r\n\r\nThere were three reasons that made the handling of the Polish question\r\none of the greatest difficulty. The first was the totally different\r\nviews of the case held by competent individuals of the Austro-Hungarian\r\nMonarchy. While the Austrian Ministry was in favour of the so-called\r\nAustro-Polish solution, Count Tisza was strongly opposed to it. His\r\nstandpoint was that the political structure of the Monarchy ought not\r\nto undergo any change through the annexation of Poland, and that Poland\r\neventually might be joined to the Monarchy as an Austrian province, but\r\nnever as a partner in a tripartite Monarchy.\r\n\r\nA letter that he wrote to me from Budapest on February 22, 1917, was\r\ncharacteristic of his train of thought. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n  YOUR EXCELLENCY,--Far be it from me to raise a discussion on\r\n  questions which to-day are without actual value and most probably\r\n  will not assume any when peace is signed. On the other hand, I\r\n  wish to avoid the danger that might arise from mistaken\r\n  conclusions drawn from the fact that I accepted without protest\r\n  certain statements that appeared in the correspondence of our\r\n  diplomatic representatives.\r\n\r\n  Guided exclusively by this consideration, I beg to draw the\r\n  attention of Your Excellency to the fact that the so-called\r\n  Austro-Polish solution of the Polish question has repeatedly (as\r\n  in telegram Nr. 63 from Herr von Ugron) been referred to as the\r\n  \"tripartite solution.\"\r\n\r\n  With reference to this appellation I am compelled to point out the\r\n  fact that in the first period of the war, at a time when the\r\n  Austro-Polish solution was in the foreground, all competent\r\n  circles in the Monarchy were agreed that the annexation of Poland\r\n  to the Monarchy must on no account affect its _dualistic\r\n  structure_.\r\n\r\n  This principle was distinctly recognised by the then leaders in\r\n  the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, as also by both Prime Ministers;\r\n  it was also recognised and sanctioned by His late Majesty the\r\n  Emperor and King Francis Joseph. I trust I may assume that this\r\n  view is shared by Your Excellency; in any case, and to avoid\r\n  misunderstanding, I must state that the Royal Hungarian Government\r\n  considers this to be the ground-pillar of its entire political\r\n  system, from which, in no circumstances, would it be in a position\r\n  to deviate.\r\n\r\n  It would, in our opinion, be fatal for the whole Monarchy. The\r\n  uncertainty of the situation lies in the Austrian State, where the\r\n  German element, after the separation of Galicia, would be in a\r\n  very unsafe position, confronted by powerful tendencies that\r\n  easily might gain the upper hand should a relatively small number\r\n  of the Germans, whether from social-democratic,\r\n  political-reactionary or doctrinary reasons, separate from the\r\n  other German parties. The establishment of the new Polish element\r\n  as a third factor with Austria-Hungary in our constitutional\r\n  organism would represent an element so unsafe, and would be\r\n  combined with such risks for the further development of the policy\r\n  of the Habsburg Great Power, that, in view of the position of the\r\n  Monarchy as such, I should feel the greatest anxiety lest the new\r\n  and unreliable Russian-Polish element, so different from us in\r\n  many respects, should play too predominant a part.\r\n\r\n  The firm retention of dualism, according to which half the\r\n  political influence on general subjects rests with Hungary, and\r\n  _the Hungarian and German element in common furnish a safe\r\n  majority_ in the delegation, alone can secure for the dynasty and\r\n  the two States under its sceptre an adequate guarantee for the\r\n  future.\r\n\r\n  There is no other factor in the Monarchy whose every vital\r\n  interest is so bound up in the dynasty and in the position of the\r\n  Monarchy as a Great Power, as Hungary. The few people whose clear\r\n  perception of that fact may have become dulled during the last\r\n  peaceful decade must have been brought to a keener realisation of\r\n  it by the present war.\r\n\r\n  The preservation of the Danube Monarchy as a vigorous and active\r\n  Great Power is in the truest sense of the word a vital condition\r\n  for the existence of the Hungarian State. It was fatal for all of\r\n  us that this willing people, endowed with so many administrative\r\n  qualities, ready to sacrifice themselves for all State and\r\n  national aims, have for centuries past not been able to devote\r\n  themselves to the common cause. The striving for a solution of the\r\n  world racial problem and the necessity of combining the\r\n  responsibilities of a Great Power with the independence of the\r\n  Hungarian State have caused heavy trials and century-long friction\r\n  and fighting.\r\n\r\n  Hungary's longing for independence did not take the form of\r\n  efforts for dissolution. The great leaders in our struggle for\r\n  liberty did not attack the continuance of the Habsburg Empire as a\r\n  Great Power. And even during the bitter trials of the struggle\r\n  they never followed any further aim than to obtain from the Crown\r\n  a guarantee for their chartered rights.\r\n\r\n  Hungary, free and independent, wished to remain under the sceptre\r\n  of the Habsburgs; she did not wish to come under any foreign rule,\r\n  but to be a free nation governed by her own king and her own laws\r\n  and not subordinate to any other ruler. This principle was\r\n  repeatedly put forward in solemn form (in the years 1723 and\r\n  1791), and finally, in the agreement of 1867, a solution was found\r\n  which endowed it with life and ensured its being carried out in a\r\n  manner favourable for the position of a great nation.\r\n\r\n  In the period of preparation for the agreement of 1867 Hungary was\r\n  a poor and, comparatively speaking, small part of the then\r\n  Monarchy, and the great statesmen of Hungary based their\r\n  administrative plan on dualism and equality as being the only\r\n  possible way for ensuring that Hungarian independence, recognised\r\n  and appealed to on many occasions, should materialise in a\r\n  framework of modern constitutional practice.\r\n\r\n  A political structure for the Monarchy which would make it\r\n  possible for Hungary to be outvoted on the most important\r\n  questions of State affairs, and therefore subject to a foreign\r\n  will, would again have nullified all that had been achieved after\r\n  so much striving and suffering, so much futile waste of strength\r\n  for the benefit of us all, which even in this war, too, would have\r\n  brought its blessings. All those, therefore, who have always stood\r\n  up firmly and loyally for the agreement of 1867 must put their\r\n  whole strength into resisting any tripartite experiments.\r\n\r\n  I would very much regret if, in connection with this question,\r\n  differences of opinion should occur among the present responsible\r\n  leaders of the Monarchy. In view of this I considered it\r\n  unnecessary to give publicity to a question that is not pressing.\r\n  At all events, in dealing with the Poles, all expressions must be\r\n  avoided which, in the improbable, although not impossible, event\r\n  of a resumption of the Austro-Polish solution, might awaken\r\n  expectations in them which could only lead to the most complicated\r\n  consequences.\r\n\r\n  The more moderate Poles had made up their minds that the dualistic\r\n  structure of the Monarchy would have to remain intact, and that\r\n  the annexation of Poland by way of a junction with the Austrian\r\n  State, with far-reaching autonomy to follow, would have to be the\r\n  consequence. It would therefore be extremely imprudent and\r\n  injurious to awaken fresh aspirations, the realisation of which\r\n  seems very doubtful, not only from a Hungarian point of view but\r\n  from that which concerns the future of the Monarchy.\r\n\r\n  I beg Your Excellency to accept the expression of my highest\r\n  esteem.\r\n\r\n  TISZA.\r\n\r\n  _Budapest, February 22, 1917._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question as to what was to be Poland's future position with regard\r\nto the Monarchy remained still unsolved. I continued to press the\r\npoint that Poland should be annexed as an independent state. Tisza\r\nwanted it to be a province. When the Emperor dismissed him, although\r\nhe was favoured by the majority of the Parliament, it did not alter\r\nthe situation in regard to the Polish question, as Wekerle, in this as\r\nin almost all other questions, had to adopt Tisza's views; otherwise,\r\nhe would have been in the minority.\r\n\r\nThe actual reason of Tisza's dismissal was not the question of\r\nelectoral reforms, as his successors could only act according to\r\nTisza's instructions. For, as leader of the majority, which he\r\ncontinued to be even after his dismissal, no electoral reforms could\r\nbe carried out in opposition to his will. Tisza thought that the\r\nEmperor meditated putting in a coalition majority against him, which\r\nhe considered quite logical, though not agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe next difficulty was the attitude of the Germans towards Poland. At\r\nthe occupation of Poland we were already unfairly treated, and the\r\nGermans had appropriated the greater part of the country. Always and\r\neverywhere, they were the stronger on the battlefield, and the\r\nconsequence was that they claimed the lion's share of all the\r\nsuccesses gained. This was in reality quite natural, but it greatly\r\nadded to all diplomatic and political activities, which were\r\ninvariably prejudiced and hindered by military facts. When I entered\r\nupon office, Germany's standpoint was that she had a far superior\r\nright to Poland, and that the simplest solution would be for us to\r\nevacuate the territory we had occupied. It was, of course, obvious\r\nthat I could not accept such a proposal, and we held firmly to the\r\npoint that under no circumstances would our troops leave Lublin. After\r\nmuch controversy, the Germans agreed, _tant bien que mal_, to this\r\nsolution. The further development of the affair showed that the German\r\nstandpoint went through many changes. In general, it fluctuated\r\nbetween two extremes: either Poland must unite herself to Germany--the\r\nGerman-Polish solution, or else vast portions of her territory must be\r\nceded to Germany to be called frontier adjustments, and what remained\r\nwould be either for us or for Poland herself. Neither solution could\r\nbe accepted by us. The first one for this reason, that the Polish\r\nquestion being in the foreground made that of Galicia very acute, as\r\nit would have been quite impossible to retain Galicia in the Monarchy\r\nwhen separated from the rest of Poland. We were obliged to oppose the\r\nGerman-Polish solution, not from any desire for conquest, but to\r\nprevent the sacrifice of Galicia for no purpose.\r\n\r\nThe second German suggestion was just as impossible to carry out,\r\nbecause Poland, crippled beyond recognition by the frontier\r\nreadjustment, even though united with Galicia, would have been so\r\nunsatisfactory a factor that there would never have been any prospect\r\nof harmonious dealings with her.\r\n\r\nThe third difficulty was presented by the Poles themselves, as they\r\nnaturally wished to secure the greatest possible profit out of their\r\nrelease by the Central Powers, even though it did not contribute much\r\nto their future happiness so far as military support was concerned.\r\nThere were many different parties among them: first of all, one for\r\nthe Entente; a second, Bilinski's party; above all, one for the\r\nCentral Powers, especially when we gained military successes.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Polish policy was to show their hand as little as\r\npossible to any particular group, and in the end range themselves on\r\nthe side of the conquerors. It must be admitted that these tactics\r\nwere successful.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these difficulties, there prevailed almost always in\r\nPolish political circles a certain nervous excitement, which made it\r\nextremely difficult to enter into any calm and essential negotiations.\r\nAt the very beginning, misunderstandings occurred between the Polish\r\nleaders and myself with regard to what I proposed to do;\r\nmisunderstandings which, toward the end of my term of office,\r\ndeveloped into the most bitter enmity towards me on the part of the\r\nPoles. On February 10, 1917, a whole year before Brest-Litovsk, I\r\nreceived the news from Warsaw that Herr von Bilinski, apparently\r\nmisunderstanding my standpoint, evolved from the facts, considered\r\nthat hopes represented promises, and in so doing raised Polish\r\nexpectations to an unwarranted degree. I telegraphed thereupon to our\r\nrepresentative as follows:\r\n\r\n  _February 16, 1917._\r\n\r\n  I have informed Herr von Bilinski, together with other Poles, that\r\n  it is impossible in the present unsettled European situation to\r\n  make, on the whole, any plans for the future of Poland. I have\r\n  told them that I sympathise with the Austro-Polish solution longed\r\n  for by all our Poles, but that I am not in the position to say\r\n  whether this solution will be attainable, though I am equally\r\n  unable to foretell the opposite. Finally, I have also declared\r\n  that our whole policy where Poland is concerned can only consist\r\n  in our leaving a door open for all future transactions.\r\n\r\nI added that our representative must quote my direct orders in\r\nsettling the matter.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1917, a conference was held respecting the Polish\r\nquestion: a conference which aimed at laying down a broad line of\r\naction for the policy to be adopted. I first of all referred to the\r\ncircumstances connected with the previously-mentioned German request\r\nfor us to evacuate Lublin, and explained my reasons for not agreeing\r\nto the demand. I pointed out that it did not seem probable to me that\r\nthe war would end with a dictated peace on our side, and that, with\r\nreference to Poland, we should not be able to solve the Polish\r\nquestion without the co-operation of the Entente, and that there was\r\nnot much object so long as the war lasted in endeavouring to secure\r\n_faits accomplis_. The main point was that we remain in the country,\r\nand on the conclusion of peace enter into negotiations with the\r\nEntente and the Allies to secure a solution of the Austro-Polish\r\nquestion. That should be the gist of our policy. Count Tisza spoke\r\nafter me and agreed with me that we must not yield to the German\r\ndemand for our evacuation of Lublin. As regards the future, the\r\nHungarian Prime Minister stated that he had always held the view that\r\nwe should cede to Germany our claim to Poland in exchange for economic\r\nand financial compensation; but that, at the present time, he did not\r\nfeel so confident about it. The conditions then prevailing were\r\nunbearable, chiefly owing to the variableness of German policy, and\r\nhe, Count Tisza, returned to his former, oft-repeated opinion that we\r\nshould strive as soon as possible to withdraw with honour out of the\r\naffair; impose no conditions that would lead to further friction, but\r\nthe surrendering to Germany of our share in Poland in exchange for\r\neconomic compensation.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Prime Minister, Count Clam, opposed this from the\r\nAustrian point of view, which supported the union of all the Poles\r\nunder the Habsburg sceptre as being the one and only desirable\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe feeling during the debate was that the door must be closed against\r\nthe Austro-Polish proposals, and that, in view of the impossibility of\r\nan immediate definite solution, we must adhere firmly to the policy\r\nthat rendered possible the union of all the Poles under the Habsburg\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nAfter Germany's refusal of the proposal to accept Galicia as\r\ncompensation for Alsace-Lorraine, this programme was adhered to\r\nthrough various phases and vicissitudes until the ever-increasing\r\nGerman desire for frontier readjustment created a situation which made\r\nthe achievement of the Austro-Polish project very doubtful. Unless we\r\ncould secure a Poland which, thanks to the unanimity of the great\r\nmajority of all Poles, would willingly and cheerfully join the\r\nMonarchy, the Austro-Polish solution would not have been a happy one,\r\nas in that case we should only have increased the number of\r\ndiscontented elements in the Monarchy, already very high, by adding\r\nfresh ones to them. As it proved impossible to break the resistance\r\nput up by General Ludendorff, the idea presented itself at a later\r\nstage to strive for the annexation of Roumania instead of Poland. It\r\nwas a return to the original idea of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the\r\nunion of Roumania with Transylvania, closely linked to the Monarchy.\r\nIn that case we should have lost Galicia to Poland, but a certain\r\ncompensation would have been conceded to us in Roumania with her corn\r\nand oil springs, and for the Monarchy, as for the Poles, it appeared\r\nbetter to unite the latter collectively with Germany rather than to\r\ndivide them, as suggested in the Vienna-Berlin dispute.\r\n\r\nThe plan for the annexation of Roumania presented wellnigh\r\ninsurmountable internal difficulties. Owing to her geographical\r\nposition, Roumania ought naturally to be annexed to Hungary. Tisza,\r\nwho was not in favour of the plan, would, nevertheless, have agreed to\r\nit if the annexed country had been administered from Budapest and in\r\nthe Magyar spirit, which meant that it would be incorporated in\r\nHungary. This, for obvious reasons, would involve the failure of the\r\nplan, for the Roumanians would gain no advantage from the annexation\r\nif it was to be at the sacrifice of their national independence. On\r\nthe other hand, the Austrian Ministry raised quite justifiable\r\nobjections to the suggestion of a future combination that would add a\r\nrich and vast country to Hungary, while Austria would be reduced in\r\nproportion, and compensation in one or other form was demanded.\r\nAnother, but tentative, plan was to make over Bosnia and the\r\nHerzegovina definitely by way of compensation to Austria. All these\r\nideas and plans, however, were of a transitory nature, evoked by the\r\nconstantly recurring difficulties in Berlin and Warsaw, and they\r\ninvariably fell through when it was seen that the obstacles arising\r\nfrom dualism were not to be overcome. The original Austro-Polish\r\nsolution was taken up again, although it was impossible to extort\r\nfrom the Germans a definite statement as to a reasonable western\r\nfrontier for Poland. In the very last term of my office the Roumanian\r\nplan again came up, partly owing to the bitter feelings of the Poles\r\non the Cholm question, and partly owing to the claims made by Germany,\r\nwhich rendered the Austro-Polish solution impossible.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with these efforts, a plan for the future organisation\r\nof the Monarchy was being considered. The Emperor adhered to the\r\ncorrect standpoint, as I still consider it to be, that the structure\r\nof the Monarchy, after an endurable issue from the war, would have to\r\nbe altered, and reconstruction on a far more pronounced national basis\r\nbe necessary. As applied to the Poles, this project would entail the\r\ndividing of East and West Galicia, and an independent position for the\r\nRuthenian Poles.\r\n\r\nWhen at Brest-Litovsk, under the pressure of the hunger riots that\r\nwere beginning, I refused to agree to the Ukrainian demands, but\r\nconsented to submit the question of the division of Galicia to the\r\nAustrian Crown Council. I was impelled thereto by the conviction that\r\nwe were adhering strictly to the programme as it had been planned for\r\nthe Monarchy.\r\n\r\nI will give fuller details respecting this question in the next\r\nchapter, but will merely relate the following incident as an example\r\nto show the degree of hostile persecution to which I was exposed. The\r\nrumour was spread on all sides that the Emperor had told the Poles\r\nthat \"I had concluded peace with the Ukraine without his knowledge and\r\nagainst his will.\" It is quite out of the question that the Emperor\r\ncan have made such a statement, as the peace conditions at Kieff were\r\na result of a council convoked _ad hoc_, where--as the protocol\r\nproves--the Emperor and Dr. von Seidler were responsible for the\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe great indignation of the Poles at my conduct at Brest-Litovsk was\r\nquite unfounded. I never promised the Poles that they were to have the\r\nCholm district, and never alluded to any definite frontiers. Had I\r\ndone so the capable political leaders in Poland would never have\r\nlistened to me, as they knew very well that the frontiers, only in a\r\nvery slight degree, depended on the decisions at Vienna. If we lost\r\nthe war we had nothing more to say in the matter; if a peace of\r\nagreement was concluded, then Berlin would be the strongest side,\r\nhaving occupied the largest portion of the country; the question would\r\nthen have to be decided at the general Conference.\r\n\r\nI always told the Polish leaders that I hoped to secure a Poland\r\nthoroughly satisfied, also with respect to her frontier claims, and\r\nthere were times when we seemed to be very near the accomplishment of\r\nsuch an aim; but I never concealed the fact that there were many\r\ninfluences at work restricting my wishes and keeping them very much\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nThe partition of Galicia was an internal Austrian question. Dr. von\r\nSeidler took up the matter most warmly, and at the Council expressed\r\nthe hope of being able to carry out these measures by parliamentary\r\nprocedure and against the opposition of the Poles.\r\n\r\nI will allude to this question also in my next chapter.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the Polish question was the so-called\r\nCentral-European project.\r\n\r\nFor obvious and very comprehensible reasons Germany was keenly\r\ninterested in a scheme for closer union. I was always full of the idea\r\nof turning these important concessions to account at the right moment\r\nas compensation for prospective German sacrifices, and thus promoting\r\na peace of understanding.\r\n\r\nDuring the first period of my official activity, I still hoped to\r\nsecure a revision of the Pact of London. I hoped, as already\r\nmentioned, that the Entente would not keep to the resolution adopted\r\nfor the mutilation of the Monarchy, and I did not, therefore, approach\r\nthe Central-European question closer; had I raised it, it would\r\ngreatly have complicated our position with regard to Paris and London.\r\nWhen I was compelled later to admit that the Entente kept firmly to\r\nthe decision that we were to be divided in any case, and that any\r\nchange in their purpose would only be effected, if at all, by military\r\nforce, I endeavoured to work out the Central-European plan in detail,\r\nand to reserve the concessions ready to be made to Germany until the\r\nright moment had arrived to make the offer.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it seemed to me that the Customs Union was\r\nunfeasible, at any rate at first; but on the other hand, a new and\r\ncloser commercial treaty would be desirable, and a closer union of the\r\narmies would offer no danger; it was hoped greatly to reduce them\r\nafter the war. I was convinced that a peace of understanding would\r\nbring about disarmament, and that the importance of military\r\nsettlements would be influenced thereby. Also, that the conclusion of\r\npeace would bring with it different relations between all states, and\r\nthat, therefore, the political and military decisions to be determined\r\nin the settlement with Germany were not of such importance as those\r\nrelating to economic questions.\r\n\r\nThe drawing up of this programme was met, however, by the most violent\r\nopposition on the part of the Emperor. He was particularly opposed to\r\nall military _rapprochement_.\r\n\r\nWhen the attempt to approach the question failed through the\r\nresistance from the crown, I arranged on my own initiative for a\r\ndebate on the economic question. The Emperor then wrote me a letter in\r\nwhich he forbade any further dealings in the matter. I answered his\r\nletter by a business report, pointing out the necessity of continuing\r\nthe negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe question then became a sore point between the Emperor and myself.\r\nHe did not give his permission for further negotiations, but I\r\ncontinued them notwithstanding. The Emperor knew of it, but did not\r\nmake further allusion to the matter. The vast claims put forward by\r\nthe Germans made the negotiations extremely difficult, and with long\r\nintervals and at a very slow pace they dragged on until I left office.\r\n\r\nAfterwards the Emperor went with Burian to the German Headquarters.\r\nFollowing that, the Salzburg negotiations were proceeded with and,\r\napparently, at greater speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBREST-LITOVSK\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1917 we received information which seemed to suggest\r\na likelihood of realising the contemplated peace with Russia. A report\r\ndated June 13, 1917, which came to me from a neutral country, ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  The Russian Press, bourgeois and socialistic, reveals the\r\n  following state of affairs:\r\n\r\n  At the front and at home bitter differences of opinion are rife as\r\n  to the offensive against the Central Powers demanded by the Allies\r\n  and now also energetically advocated by Kerenski in speeches\r\n  throughout the country. The Bolsheviks, as also the Socialists\r\n  under the leadership of Lenin, with their Press, are taking a\r\n  definite stand against any such offensive. But a great part of the\r\n  Mensheviks as well, _i.e._ Tscheidse's party, to which the present\r\n  Ministers Tseretelli and Skobeleff belong, is likewise opposed to\r\n  the offensive, and the lack of unanimity on this question is\r\n  threatening the unity of the party, which has only been maintained\r\n  with difficulty up to now. A section of the Mensheviks, styled\r\n  Internationalists from their trying to re-establish the old\r\n  _Internationale_, also called _Zimmerwalder_ or _Kienthaler_, and\r\n  led by Trotski, or, more properly, Bronstein, who has returned\r\n  from America, with Larin, Martow, Martynoz, etc., returned from\r\n  Switzerland, are on this point, as with regard to the entry of\r\n  Menshevik Social Democrats into the Provisional Government,\r\n  decidedly opposed to the majority of the party. And for this\r\n  reason Leo Deutsch, one of the founders of the Marxian Social\r\n  Democracy, has publicly withdrawn from the party, as being too\r\n  little patriotic for his views and not insisting on final victory.\r\n  He is, with Georgei Plechanow, one of the chief supporters of the\r\n  Russian \"Social Patriots,\" which group is termed, after their\r\n  Press organ, the \"Echinstvo\" group, but is of no importance either\r\n  as regards numbers or influence. Thus it comes about that the\r\n  official organ of the Mensheviks, the _Rabocaja Gazeta_, is\r\n  forced to take up an intermediate position, and publishes, for\r\n  instance, frequent articles against the offensive.\r\n\r\n  There is then the Social Revolutionary party, represented in the\r\n  Cabinet by the Minister of Agriculture, Tschernow. This is,\r\n  perhaps, the strongest of all the Russian parties, having\r\n  succeeded in leading the whole of the peasant movement into its\r\n  course--at the Pan-Russian Congress the great majority of the\r\n  peasants' deputies were Social Revolutionaries, and no Social\r\n  Democrat was elected to the executive committee of the Peasants'\r\n  Deputies' Council. A section of this party, and, it would seem,\r\n  the greater and more influential portion, is definitely opposed to\r\n  any offensive. This is plainly stated in the leading organs of the\r\n  party, _Delo Naroda_ and _Zemlja i Wolja_. Only a small and\r\n  apparently uninfluential portion, grouped round the organ _Volja\r\n  Naroda_, faces the bourgeois Press with unconditional demands for\r\n  an offensive to relieve the Allies, as does the Plechanow group.\r\n  Kerenski's party, the Trudoviks, as also the related People's\r\n  Socialists, represented in the Cabinet by the Minister of Food,\r\n  Peschechonow, are still undecided whether to follow Kerenski here\r\n  or not. Verbal information, and utterances in the Russian Press,\r\n  as, for instance, the _Retch_, assert that Kerenski's health gives\r\n  grounds for fearing a fatal catastrophe in a short time. The\r\n  official organ of the Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies' Council,\r\n  the _Isvestia_, on the other hand, frequently asserts with great\r\n  emphasis that an offensive must unquestionably be made. It is\r\n  characteristic that a speech made by the Minister of Agriculture,\r\n  Tschernow, to the Peasants' Congress, was interpreted as meaning\r\n  that he was opposed to the offensive, so that he was obliged to\r\n  justify himself to his colleagues in the Ministry and deny that\r\n  such had been his meaning.\r\n\r\n  While, then, people at home are seriously divided on the question\r\n  of an offensive, the men at the front appear but little inclined\r\n  to undertake any offensive. This is stated by all parties in the\r\n  Russian Press, the symptoms being regarded either with\r\n  satisfaction or with regret. The infantry in particular are\r\n  against the offensive; the only enthusiasm is to be found among\r\n  the officers, in the cavalry or a part of it, and the artillery.\r\n  It is characteristic also that the Cossacks are in favour of war.\r\n  These, at any rate, have an ulterior motive, in that they hope by\r\n  success at the front to be able ultimately to overthrow the\r\n  revolutionary régime. For there is this to be borne in mind: that\r\n  while most of the Russian peasants have no landed property\r\n  exceeding five deshatin, and three millions have no land at all,\r\n  every Cossack owns forty deshatin, an unfair distinction which is\r\n  constantly being referred to in all discussion of the land\r\n  question. This is a sufficient ground for the isolated position of\r\n  the Cossacks in the Revolution, and it was for this reason also\r\n  that they were formerly always among the most loyal supporters of\r\n  the Tsar.\r\n\r\n  Extremely characteristic of the feeling at the front are the\r\n  following details:\r\n\r\n  At the sitting on May 30 of the Pan-Russian Congress, Officers'\r\n  Delegates, a representative of the officers of the 3rd\r\n  Elizabethengrad Hussars is stated, according to the _Retch_ of May\r\n  1, to have given, in a speech for the offensive, the following\r\n  characteristic statement: \"You all know to what extremes the\r\n  disorder at the front has reached. The infantry cut the wires\r\n  connecting them with their batteries and declare that the soldiers\r\n  will not remain _more than one month_ at the front, but will go\r\n  home.\"\r\n\r\n  It is very instructive also to read the report of a delegate from\r\n  the front, who had accompanied the French and English majority\r\n  Socialists at the front. This report was printed in the _Rabocaja\r\n  Gazeta_, May 18 and 19--this is the organ of the Mensheviks, i.e.\r\n  that of Tscheidse, Tseretelli and Skobeleff. These Entente\r\n  Socialists at the front were told with all possible distinctness\r\n  that the Russian army could not and would not fight for the\r\n  imperialistic aims of England and France. The state of the\r\n  transport, provisions and forage supplies, as also the danger to\r\n  the achievements of the Revolution by further war, demanded a\r\n  speedy cessation of hostilities. The English and French Socialist\r\n  delegates were said to be not altogether pleased at this state of\r\n  feeling at the front. And it was further demanded of them that\r\n  they should undertake to make known the result of their experience\r\n  in Russia on the Western front, i.e. in France. There was some\r\n  very plain speaking, too, with regard to America: representatives\r\n  from the Russian front spoke openly of America's policy of\r\n  exploitation towards Europe and the Allies. It was urged then that\r\n  an international Socialist conference should be convened at the\r\n  earliest possible moment, and supported by the English and French\r\n  majority Socialists. At one of the meetings at the front, the\r\n  French and English Socialists were given the following reply:\r\n\r\n  \"Tell your comrades that we await definite declarations from your\r\n  Governments and peoples renouncing conquest and indemnities. We\r\n  will shed no drop of blood for Imperialists, whether they be\r\n  Russians, Germans or English. We await the speediest agreement\r\n  between the workers of all countries for the termination of the\r\n  war, which is a thing shameful in itself, and will, if continued,\r\n  prove disastrous to the Russian Revolution. We will not conclude\r\n  any separate peace, but tell your people to let us know their aims\r\n  as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\n  According to the report, the French Socialists were altogether\r\n  converted to this point of view. This also appears to be the case,\r\n  from the statements with regard to the attitude of Cachin and\r\n  Moutet at the French Socialist Congress. The English, on the other\r\n  hand, were immovable, with the exception of Sanders, who inclined\r\n  somewhat toward the Russian point of view.\r\n\r\n  Private information reaching the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in\r\n  this country states that shots were fired at M. Thomas, the\r\n  Minister of Munitions, in the course of one of his war speeches at\r\n  the Russian front.\r\n\r\n  The disorganisation at the front is described by an officer or\r\n  soldier at the front in the same organ, the _Rabocaja Gazeta_ for\r\n  May 26, as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"The passionate desire for peace, peace of whatever kind, aye,\r\n  even a peace costing the loss of ten governments (i.e. districts),\r\n  is growing ever more plainly evident. Men dream of it\r\n  passionately, even though it is not yet spoken of at meetings and\r\n  in revolutions, even though all conscious elements of the army\r\n  fight against this party that long for peace.\" And to paralyse\r\n  this, there can be but one way: let the soldiers see the democracy\r\n  fighting emphatically for peace and the end of the war.\r\n\r\n  The Pan-Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Delegates'\r\n  Councils and the Army Organisation at the front in St. Petersburg\r\n  June 1-14 took for its first point in the order of the day the\r\n  following: \"The War, questions of defence and the struggle for\r\n  peace.\" At this time the Government would doubtless have to give a\r\n  declaration with regard to the answer already received at the\r\n  beginning of June from the Allies as to their war aims. This\r\n  congress will also probably decide definitely upon the nomination\r\n  for the Stockholm Conference and appoint delegates. Point 4 deals\r\n  with the question of nationality. An open conflict had broken out\r\n  between the Petersburg Workers' and Soldiers' Deputy Councils and\r\n  the Ukrainian Soldiers' Congress, sitting at Kieff, on account of\r\n  the formation of an Ukrainian army. The appointment of an\r\n  \"Ukrainian Army General Committee\" further aggravated the\r\n  conflict.\r\n\r\n  With regard to the increasing internal confusion, the growing\r\n  seriousness of the nationality dispute, the further troubles in\r\n  connection with agricultural and industrial questions, a detailed\r\n  report dealing separately with these heads will be forwarded\r\n  later.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of November I wrote to one of my friends the following\r\nletter, which I have given _in extenso_, as it shows faithfully my\r\nestimate of the situation at the time:\r\n\r\n  _Vienna, November 17, 1917._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR FRIEND,--After many days, full of trouble, annoyance and\r\n  toil, I write to you once more in order to answer your very\r\n  noteworthy observations; to be in contact with you again turns my\r\n  thoughts into other channels, and enables me, for the time at\r\n  least, to forget the wretchedness of every day.\r\n\r\n  You have heard, you say, that matters are not going so well\r\n  between the Emperor and myself, and you are sorry for this. I am\r\n  sorry myself, if for no other reason than that it increases the\r\n  friction of the daily working machine to an insupportable degree.\r\n  As soon as a thing of this sort leaks out--and it does so fast\r\n  enough--all enemies, male and female, rush in with renewed\r\n  strength, making for the vulnerable point, in the hope of securing\r\n  my overthrow. These good people are like carrion vultures--I\r\n  myself am the carrion--they can scent from afar that there is\r\n  something for them to do, and come flying to the spot. And the\r\n  lies they invent and the intrigues they contrive, with a view to\r\n  increasing existing differences--really, they are worthy of\r\n  admiration. You ask, who are these inveterate enemies of mine?\r\n\r\n  Well, first of all, those whom you yourself conjecture.\r\n\r\n  And, secondly, the enemies whom every Minister has, the numbers of\r\n  those who would fain be in his place. Finally, a crowd of\r\n  political mountebanks from the Jockey Club, who are disgusted\r\n  because they had hoped for some personal advantage through my\r\n  influence, and I have ignored them. No. 3 is a comfortingly\r\n  negligible quantity, No. 2 are dangerous, but No. 1 are deadly.\r\n\r\n  In any case, then, my days are numbered. Heaven be thanked, relief\r\n  is not far off. If only I could now settle things with Russia\r\n  quickly, and thus perhaps secure the possibility of a peace all\r\n  round. All reports from Russia seem to point to the fact that the\r\n  Government there is determined on peace, and peace as speedily as\r\n  possible. But the Germans are now full of confidence. If they can\r\n  throw their massed forces against the West, they have no doubt of\r\n  being able to break through, take Paris and Calais, and directly\r\n  threaten England. Such a success, however, could only lead to\r\n  peace if Germany could be persuaded to renounce all plans of\r\n  conquest. I at any rate cannot believe that the Entente, after\r\n  losing Paris and Calais, would refuse to treat for peace as _inter\r\n  pares_--it would at least be necessary to make every endeavour in\r\n  that direction. Up to now Hindenburg has done all that he\r\n  promised, so much we must admit, and the whole of Germany believes\r\n  in his forthcoming success in the West--always taking for granted,\r\n  of course, the freeing of the Eastern front; that is to say, peace\r\n  with Russia. The Russian peace, then, _may_ prove the first step\r\n  on the way to the peace of the world.\r\n\r\n  I have during the last few days received reliable information\r\n  about the Bolsheviks. Their leaders are almost all of them Jews,\r\n  with altogether fantastic ideas, and I do not envy the country\r\n  that is governed by them. From our point of view, however, the\r\n  most interesting thing about them is that they are anxious to make\r\n  peace, and in this respect they do not seem likely to change, for\r\n  they cannot carry on the war.\r\n\r\n  In the Ministry here, three groups are represented: one declines\r\n  to take Lenin seriously, regarding him as an ephemeral personage,\r\n  the second does not take this view at all, but is nevertheless\r\n  unwilling to treat with a revolutionary of this sort, and the\r\n  third consists, as far as I am aware, of myself alone, and I\r\n  _will_ treat with him, despite the possibly ephemeral character of\r\n  his position and the certainty of revolution. The briefer Lenin's\r\n  period of power the more need to act speedily, for no subsequent\r\n  Russian Government will recommence the war--and I cannot take a\r\n  Russian Metternich as my partner when there is none to be had.\r\n\r\n  The Germans are hesitating--they do not altogether like the idea\r\n  of having any dealings with Lenin, possibly also from the reasons\r\n  already mentioned; they are inconsistent in this, as is often the\r\n  case. The German military party--which, as everyone knows, holds\r\n  the reins of policy in Germany entirely--have, as far as I can\r\n  see, done all they could to overthrow Kerenski and set up\r\n  \"something else\" in his place. Now, the something else is there,\r\n  and is ready to make peace; obviously, then, one must act, even\r\n  though the party concerned is not such as one would have chosen\r\n  for oneself.\r\n\r\n  It is impossible to get any exact information about these\r\n  Bolsheviks; that is to say, there is plenty of information\r\n  available, but it is contradictory. The way they begin is this:\r\n  everything in the least reminiscent of work, wealth, and culture\r\n  must be destroyed, and the bourgeoisie exterminated. Freedom and\r\n  equality seem no longer to have any place on their programme; only\r\n  a bestial suppression of all but the proletariat itself. The\r\n  Russian bourgeois class, too, seems almost as stupid and cowardly\r\n  as our own, and its members let themselves be slaughtered like\r\n  sheep.\r\n\r\n  True, this Russian Bolshevism is a peril to Europe, and if we had\r\n  the power, besides securing a tolerable peace for ourselves, to\r\n  force other countries into a state of law and order, then it would\r\n  be better to have nothing to do with such people as these, but to\r\n  march on Petersburg and arrange matters there. But we have not the\r\n  power; peace at the earliest possible moment is necessary for our\r\n  own salvation, and we cannot obtain peace unless the Germans get\r\n  to Paris--and they cannot get to Paris unless their Eastern front\r\n  is freed. That is the circle complete. All this the German\r\n  military leaders themselves maintain, and it is altogether\r\n  illogical of them now apparently to object to Lenin on personal\r\n  grounds.\r\n\r\n  I was unable to finish this letter yesterday, and now add this\r\n  to-day. Yesterday another attempt was made, from a quarter which\r\n  you will guess, to point out to me the advantage of a separate\r\n  peace. I spoke to the Emperor about it, and told him that this\r\n  would simply be shooting oneself for fear of death; that I could\r\n  not take such a step myself, but would be willing to resign under\r\n  some pretext or other, when he would certainly find men ready to\r\n  make the attempt. The conference of London has determined on a\r\n  division of the Monarchy, and no separate peace on our part would\r\n  avail to alter that. The Roumanians, Serbians and Italians are to\r\n  receive enormous compensation, we are to lose Trieste, and the\r\n  remainder is to be broken up into separate states--Czechish,\r\n  Polish, Hungarian and German. There will be very slight contact\r\n  between these new states; in other words, a separate peace would\r\n  mean that the Monarchy, having first been mutilated, would then be\r\n  hacked to pieces. But until we arrive at this result, we must\r\n  fight on, and that, moreover, _against_ Germany, which will, of\r\n  course, make peace with Russia at once and occupy the Monarchy.\r\n  The German generals will not be so foolish as to wait until the\r\n  Entente has invaded Germany through Austria, but will take care to\r\n  make _Austria itself the theatre of war_. So that instead of\r\n  bringing the war to an end, we should be merely changing one\r\n  opponent for another and delivering up provinces hitherto\r\n  spared--such as Bohemia and Tyrol--to the fury of battle, only to\r\n  be wrecked completely in the end.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, we might perhaps, in a few months' time, secure\r\n  peace all round, with Germany as well--a tolerable peace of mutual\r\n  understanding--always provided the German offensive turns out\r\n  successful. The Emperor was more silent then. Among his entourage,\r\n  one pulls this way, another that--and we gain nothing in that\r\n  manner among the Entente, while we are constantly losing the\r\n  confidence of Berlin. If a man wishes to go over to the enemy,\r\n  then let him do it--_le remède sera pire que le mal_--but to be\r\n  for ever dallying with the idea of treachery and adopting the\r\n  pose without carrying it out in reality--this I cannot regard as\r\n  prudent policy.\r\n\r\n  I believe we could arrive at a tolerable peace of understanding;\r\n  we should lose something to Italy, and should, of course, gain\r\n  nothing in exchange. Furthermore, we should have to alter the\r\n  entire structure of the Monarchy--after the fashion of the\r\n  _fédération Danubienne_ proposed in France--and I am certainly\r\n  rather at a loss to see how this can be done in face of the\r\n  Germans and Hungarians. But I hope we may survive the war, and I\r\n  hope also that they will ultimately revise the conditions of the\r\n  London conference. Let but old Hindenburg once make his entry into\r\n  Paris, and then the Entente _must_ utter the decisive word that\r\n  they are willing to treat. But when that moment comes, I am firmly\r\n  determined to do the utmost possible, to appeal publicly to the\r\n  _peoples_ of the Central Powers and ask them if they prefer to\r\n  fight on for conquest or if they will have peace.\r\n\r\n  To settle with Russia as speedily as possible, then break through\r\n  the determination of the Entente to exterminate us, and then to\r\n  make peace--even at a loss--that is my plan and the hope for which\r\n  I live. Naturally, after the capture of Paris, all \"leading\"\r\n  men--with the exception of the Emperor Karl--will demand a \"good\"\r\n  peace, and that we shall never get in any case. The odium of\r\n  having \"spoiled the peace\" I will take upon myself.\r\n\r\n  So, I hope, we may come out of it at last, albeit rather mauled.\r\n  But the old days will never return. A new order will be born in\r\n  throes and convulsions. I said so publicly some time back, in my\r\n  Budapest speech, and it was received with disapproval practically\r\n  on all sides.\r\n\r\n  This has made a long letter after all, and it is late. _Lebe\r\n  wohl_, and let me hear from you again soon.--In friendship as of\r\n  old, yours\r\n\r\n  (Signed) CZERNIN.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk, I will leave\r\nmy diary to speak for itself. Despite many erroneous views that may\r\nappear in the following notes, and various unimportant details, I have\r\nnot abbreviated it at all, since it gives, in its present form, what I\r\nbelieve will be a clear picture of the development.\r\n\r\n\"_December 19, 1917._--Departure from Vienna, Wednesday, 19th.\r\n\r\n\"Four o'clock, Nordbahnhof. Found the party already assembled there:\r\nGratz and Wiesner, Colloredo, Gautsch and Andrian, also Lieut.\r\nField-Marshal Csicserics, and Major Fleck, Baden.\r\n\r\n\"I took the opportunity on the journey to give Csicserics an idea of\r\nmy intentions and the tactics to be pursued. I told him that in my\r\nopinion Russia would propose a _general_ peace, and that we must of\r\ncourse accept this proposal. I hoped that the first steps for a\r\ngeneral peace would be taken at Brest, and not given up for a long\r\ntime. Should the Entente not accept, then at least the way would be\r\nopen for a separate peace. After that I had long discussions with\r\nGratz and Wiesner, which took up more or less the whole day.\r\n\r\n\"_December 20, 1917._--Arrived at Brest a few minutes past five. At\r\nthe station were the Chief of Staff, General Hoffmann, with some ten\r\nof his suite, also the emissary Rosenberg and Merey with my party. I\r\ngreeted them on the platform, and after a few words Merey went into\r\nthe train with me to tell me what had happened during the past few\r\ndays. On the whole, Merey takes a not unfavourable view of the\r\nsituation, and believes that, unless something unforeseen crops up, we\r\nshould succeed within a reasonable time in arranging matters\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\"At six o'clock I went to pay my visit to General Hoffmann; he gave me\r\nsome interesting details as to the mentality of the Russian delegates,\r\nand the nature of the armistice he had so fortunately concluded. I had\r\nthe impression that the General combined expert knowledge and energy\r\nwith a good deal of calm and ability, but also not a little Prussian\r\nbrutality, whereby he had succeeded in persuading the Russians,\r\ndespite opposition at first, to agree to very favourable terms of\r\ntruce. A little later, as arranged, Prince Leopold of Bavaria came in,\r\nand I had some talk with him on matters of no importance.\r\n\r\n\"We then went to dinner, all together, including the whole staff of\r\nnearly 100 persons. The dinner presented one of the most remarkable\r\npictures ever seen. The Prince of Bavaria presided. Next to the Prince\r\nsat the leader of the Russian delegation, a Jew called Joffe,\r\nrecently liberated from Siberia; then came the generals and the other\r\ndelegates. Apart from this Joffe, the most striking personality in the\r\ndelegation is the brother-in-law of the Russian Foreign Minister,\r\nTrotski, a man named Kameneff, who, likewise liberated from prison\r\nduring the Revolution, now plays a prominent part. The third delegate\r\nis Madame Bizenko, a woman with a comprehensive past. Her husband is a\r\nminor official; she herself took an early part in the revolutionary\r\nmovement. Twelve years ago she murdered General Sacharow, the governor\r\nof some Russian city, who had been condemned to death by the\r\nSocialists for his energy. She appeared before the general with a\r\npetition, holding a revolver under her petticoat. When the general\r\nbegan to read she fired four bullets into his body, killing him on the\r\nspot. She was sent to Siberia, where she lived for twelve years, at\r\nfirst in solitary confinement, afterwards under somewhat easier\r\nconditions; she also owes her freedom to the Revolution. This\r\nremarkable woman learned French and German in Siberia well enough to\r\nread them, though she cannot speak them, not knowing how the words\r\nshould be pronounced. She is the type of the educated Russian\r\nproletariat. Extremely quiet and reserved, with a curious determined\r\nset of the mouth, and eyes that flare up passionately at times. All\r\nthat is taking place around her here she seems to regard with\r\nindifference. Only when mention is made of the great principles of the\r\nInternational Revolution does she suddenly awake, her whole expression\r\nalters; she reminds one of a beast of prey seeing its victim at hand\r\nand preparing to fall upon it and rend it.\r\n\r\n\"After dinner I had my first long conversation with Hr. Joffe. His\r\nwhole theory is based on the idea of establishing the right of\r\nself-determination of peoples on the broadest basis throughout the\r\nworld, and trusting to the peoples thus freed to continue in mutual\r\nlove. Joffe does not deny that the process would involve civil war\r\nthroughout the world to begin with, but he believes that such a war,\r\nas realising the ideals of humanity, would be justified, and its end\r\nworth all it would cost. I contented myself with telling him that he\r\nmust let Russia give proof that Bolshevism was the way to a happier\r\nage; when he had shown this to be so, the rest of the world would be\r\nwon over to his ideals. But until his theory had been proved by\r\nexample he would hardly succeed in convincing people generally to\r\nadopt his views. We were ready to conclude a general peace without\r\nindemnities or annexations, and were thoroughly agreed to leave the\r\ndevelopment of affairs in Russia thereafter to the judgment of the\r\nRussian Government itself. We should also be willing to learn\r\nsomething from Russia, and if his revolution succeeded he would force\r\nEurope to follow him, whether we would or not. But meanwhile there was\r\na great deal of scepticism about, and I pointed out to him that we\r\nshould not ourselves undertake any imitation of the Russian methods,\r\nand did not wish for any interference with our own internal affairs:\r\nthis we must strictly forbid. If he persisted in endeavouring to carry\r\nout this Utopian plan of grafting his ideas on ourselves, he had\r\nbetter go back home by the next train, for there could be no question\r\nof making peace. Hr. Joffe looked at me in astonishment with his soft\r\neyes, was silent for a while, and then, in a kindly, almost imploring\r\ntone that I shall never forget, he said: 'Still, I hope we may yet be\r\nable to raise the revolution in your country too.'\r\n\r\n\"We shall hardly need any assistance from the good Joffe, I fancy, in\r\nbringing about a revolution among ourselves; the people will manage\r\nthat, if the Entente persist in refusing to come to terms.\r\n\r\n\"They are strange creatures, these Bolsheviks. They talk of freedom\r\nand the reconciliation of the peoples of the world, of peace and\r\nunity, and withal they are said to be the most cruel tyrants history\r\nhas ever known. They are simply exterminating the bourgeoisie, and\r\ntheir arguments are machine guns and the gallows. My talk to-day with\r\nJoffe has shown me that these people are not honest, and in falsity\r\nsurpass all that cunning diplomacy has been accused of, for to oppress\r\ndecent citizens in this fashion and then talk at the same time of the\r\nuniversal blessing of freedom--it is sheer lying.\r\n\r\n\"_December 21, 1917._--I went with all my party to lunch at noon with\r\nthe Prince of Bavaria. He lives in a little bit of a palace half an\r\nhour by car from Brest. He seems to be much occupied with military\r\nmatters, and is very busy.\r\n\r\n\"I spent the first night in the train, and while we were at breakfast\r\nour people moved in with the luggage to our residence. We are in a\r\nsmall house, where I live with all the Austro-Hungarian party, quite\r\nclose to the officers' casino, and there is every comfort that could\r\nbe wished for here. I spent the afternoon at work with my people, and\r\nin the evening there was a meeting of the delegates of the three\r\nPowers. This evening I had the first talk with Kühlmann alone, and at\r\nonce declared positively that the Russians would propose a _general_\r\npeace, and that we must accept it. Kühlmann is half disposed to take\r\nmy view himself; the formula, of course, will be 'no party to demand\r\nannexations or indemnities'; then, if the Entente agree, we shall have\r\nan end of all this suffering. But, alas! it is hardly likely that they\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\"_December 22, 1917._--The forenoon was devoted to the first\r\ndiscussion among the Allies, the principles just referred to as\r\ndiscussed with Kühlmann being then academically laid down. In the\r\nafternoon the first plenary sitting took place, the proceedings being\r\nopened by the Prince of Bavaria and then led by Dr. Kühlmann. It was\r\ndecided that the Powers should take it in turns to preside, in order\r\nof the Latin alphabet as to their names, i.e. Allemagne, Autriche,\r\netc. Dr. Kühlmann requested Hr. Joffe to tell us the principles on\r\nwhich he considered a future peace should be based, and the Russian\r\ndelegate then went through the six main tenets already familiar from\r\nthe newspapers. The proposal was noted, and we undertook to give a\r\nreply as early as possible after having discussed the matter among\r\nourselves. These, then, were the proceedings of the first brief\r\nsitting of the peace congress.\r\n\r\n\"_December 23, 1917._--Kühlmann and I prepared our answer early. It\r\nwill be generally known from the newspaper reports. It cost us much\r\nheavy work to get it done. Kühlmann is personally an advocate of\r\ngeneral peace, but fears the influence of the military party, who do\r\nnot wish to make peace until definitely victorious. But at last it is\r\ndone. Then there were further difficulties with the Turks. They\r\ndeclared that they must insist on one thing, to wit, that the Russian\r\ntroops should be withdrawn from the Caucasus immediately on the\r\nconclusion of peace, a proposal to which the Germans would not agree,\r\nas this would obviously mean that they would have to evacuate Poland,\r\nCourland, and Lithuania at the same time, to which Germany would never\r\nconsent. After a hard struggle and repeated efforts, we at last\r\nsucceeded in persuading the Turks to give up this demand. The second\r\nTurkish objection was that Russia had not sufficiently clearly\r\ndeclared its intention of refraining from all interference in internal\r\naffairs. But the Turkish Foreign Minister agreed that internal affairs\r\nin Austria-Hungary were an even more perilous sphere for Russian\r\nintrigues than were the Turkish; if I had no hesitation in accepting,\r\nhe also could be content.\r\n\r\n\"The Bulgarians, who are represented by Popow, the Minister of\r\nJustice, as their chief, and some of whom cannot speak German at all,\r\nsome hardly any French, did not get any proper idea of the whole\r\nproceedings until later on, and postponed their decision until the\r\n24th.\r\n\r\n\"_December 24, 1917._--Morning and afternoon, long conferences with\r\nthe Bulgarians, in the course of which Kühlmann and I on the one hand\r\nand the Bulgarian representatives on the other, were engaged with\r\nconsiderable heat. The Bulgarian delegates demanded that a clause\r\nshould be inserted exempting Bulgaria from the no-annexation\r\nprinciple, and providing that the taking over by Bulgaria of Roumanian\r\nand Serbian territory should not be regarded as annexation. Such a\r\nclause would, of course, have rendered all our efforts null and void,\r\nand could not under any circumstances be agreed to. The discussion was\r\nattended with considerable excitement at times, and the Bulgarian\r\ndelegates even threatened to withdraw altogether if we did not give\r\nway. Kühlmann and my humble self remained perfectly firm, and told\r\nthem we had no objection to their withdrawing if they pleased; they\r\ncould also, if they pleased, send their own answer separately to the\r\nproposal, but no further alteration would be made in the draft which\r\nwe, Kühlmann and I, had drawn up. As no settlement could be arrived\r\nat, the plenary sitting was postponed to the 25th, and the Bulgarian\r\ndelegates wired to Sofia for fresh instructions.\r\n\r\n\"The Bulgarians received a negative reply, and presumably the snub we\r\nhad expected. They were very dejected, and made no further difficulty\r\nabout agreeing to the common action. So the matter is settled as far\r\nas that goes.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon I had more trouble with the Germans. The German\r\nmilitary party 'fear' that the Entente may, perhaps, be inclined to\r\nagree to a general peace, and could not think of ending the war in\r\nthis 'unprofitable' fashion. It is intolerable to have to listen to\r\nsuch twaddle.\r\n\r\n\"If the great victories which the German generals are hoping for on\r\nthe Western front should be realised, there will be no bounds to their\r\ndemands, and the difficulty of all negotiations will be still further\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\"_December 25, 1917._--The plenary sitting took place to-day, when we\r\ngave the Russians our answer to their peace proposals. I was\r\npresiding, and delivered the answer, and Joffe replied. _The general\r\noffer of peace is thus to be made, and we must await the result._ In\r\norder to lose no time, however, the negotiations on matters concerning\r\nRussia are being continued meanwhile. We have thus made a good step\r\nforward, and _perhaps_ got over the worst. It is impossible to say\r\nwhether yesterday may not have been a decisive turning point in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\n\"_December 26, 1917._--The special negotiations began at 9 A.M. The\r\nprogramme drawn up by Kühlmann, chiefly questions of economical matters\r\nand representation, were dealt with so rapidly and smoothly that by 11\r\no'clock the sitting terminated, for lack of further matter to discuss.\r\nThis is perhaps a good omen. Our people are using to-day to enter the\r\nresults of the discussion in a report of proceedings, as the sitting\r\nis to be continued to-morrow, when territorial questions will be\r\nbrought up.\r\n\r\n\"_December 26, 1917._--I have been out for a long walk alone.\r\n\r\n\"On the way back, I met an old Jew. He was sitting in the gutter,\r\nweeping bitterly. He did not beg, did not even look at me, only wept\r\nand wept, and could not speak at first for sobs. And then he told me\r\nhis story--Russian, Polish, and German, all mixed together.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he had a store--heaven knows where, but somewhere in the war\r\nzone. First came the Cossacks. They took all he had--his goats and his\r\nclothes, and everything in the place--and then they beat him. Then the\r\nRussians retired, beat him again, _en passant_ as it were, and then\r\ncame the Germans. They fired his house with their guns, pulled off his\r\nboots, and beat him. Then he entered the service of the Germans,\r\ncarrying water and wood, and received his food and beatings in return.\r\nBut to-day he had got into trouble with them in some incomprehensible\r\nfashion; no food after that, only the beatings; and was thrown into\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\"The beatings he referred to as something altogether natural. They\r\nwere for him the natural accompaniment to any sort of action--but he\r\ncould not live on beatings alone.\r\n\r\n\"I gave him what I had on me--money and cigars--told him the number of\r\nmy house, and said he could come to-morrow, when I could get him a\r\npass to go off somewhere where there were no Germans and no Russians,\r\nand try to get him a place of some sort where he would be fed and not\r\nbeaten. He took the money and cigars thankfully enough; the story of\r\nthe railway pass and the place he did not seem to believe. Railway\r\ntravelling was for soldiers, and an existence without beatings seemed\r\nan incredible idea.\r\n\r\n\"He kept on thanking me till I was out of sight, waving his hand, and\r\nthanking me in his German-Russian gibberish.\r\n\r\n\"A terrible thing is war. Terrible at all times, but worst of all in\r\none's own country. We at home suffer hunger and cold, but at least we\r\nhave been spared up to now the presence of the enemy hordes.\r\n\r\n\"This is a curious place--melancholy, yet with a beauty of its own. An\r\nendless flat, with just a slight swelling of the ground, like an ocean\r\nset fast, wave behind wave as far as the eye can see. And all things\r\ngrey, dead grey, to where this dead sea meets the grey horizon. Clouds\r\nrace across the sky, the wind lashing them on.\r\n\r\n\"This evening, before supper, Hoffmann informed the Russians of the\r\nGerman plans with regard to the outer provinces. The position is this:\r\nAs long as the war in the West continues, the Germans cannot evacuate\r\nCourland and Lithuania, since, apart from the fact that they must be\r\nheld as security for the general peace negotiations, these countries\r\nform part of the German munition establishment. The railway material,\r\nthe factories, and, most of all, the grain are indispensable as long\r\nas the war lasts. That they cannot now withdraw from there at once is\r\nclear enough. If peace is signed, then the self-determination of the\r\npeople in the occupied territory will decide. But here arises the\r\ngreat difficulty: how this right of self-determination is to be\r\nexercised.\r\n\r\n\"The Russians naturally do not want the vote to be taken while the\r\nGerman bayonets are still in the country, and the Germans reply that\r\nthe unexampled terrorism of the Bolsheviks would falsify any election\r\nresult, since the 'bourgeois,' according to Bolshevist ideas, are not\r\nhuman beings at all. My idea of having the proceedings controlled by a\r\n_neutral_ Power was not altogether acceptable to anyone. During the\r\nwar no neutral Power would undertake the task, and the German\r\noccupation could not be allowed to last until the ultimate end. In\r\npoint of fact, both sides are afraid of terrorisation by the opposing\r\nparty, and each wishes to apply the same itself.\r\n\r\n\"_December 26, 1917._--There is no hurry apparently in this place. Now\r\nit is the Turks who are not ready, now the Bulgarians, then it is the\r\nRussians' turn--and the sitting is again postponed or broken off\r\nalmost as soon as commenced.\r\n\r\n\"I am reading some memoirs from the French Revolution. A most\r\nappropriate reading at the present time, in view of what is happening\r\nin Russia and may perhaps come throughout Europe. There were no\r\nBolsheviks then, but men who tyrannised the world under the battle-cry\r\nof freedom were to be found in Paris then as well as now in St.\r\nPetersburg. Charlotte Corday said: 'It was not a man, but a wild beast\r\nI killed.' These Bolsheviks in their turn will disappear, and who can\r\nsay if there will be a Corday ready for Trotski?\r\n\r\n\"Joffe told me about the Tsar and his family, and the state of things\r\nsaid to exist there. He spoke with great respect of Nicolai\r\nNicolaievitch as a thorough man, full of energy and courage, one to be\r\nrespected even as an enemy. The Tsar, on the other hand, he considered\r\ncowardly, false, and despicable. It was a proof of the incapacity of\r\nthe bourgeois that they had tolerated such a Tsar. Monarchs were all\r\nof them more or less degenerate; he could not understand how anyone\r\ncould accept a form of government which involved the risk of having a\r\ndegenerate ruler. I answered him as to this, that a monarchy had first\r\nof all one advantage, that there was at least one place in the state\r\nbeyond the sphere of personal ambition and intrigues, and as to\r\ndegeneration, that was often a matter of opinion: there were also\r\ndegenerates to be found among the uncrowned rulers of states. Joffe\r\nconsidered that there would be no such risk when the people could\r\nchoose for themselves. I pointed out that Hr. Lenin, for instance, had\r\nnot been 'chosen,' and I considered it doubtful whether an impartial\r\nelection would have brought him into power. Possibly there might be\r\nsome in Russia who would consider him also degenerate.\r\n\r\n\"_December 27, 1917._--The Russians are in despair, and some of them\r\neven talked of withdrawing altogether. They had thought the Germans\r\nwould renounce all occupied territory without further parley, or hand\r\nit over to the Bolsheviks. Long sittings between the Russians,\r\nKühlmann, and myself, part of the time with Hoffmann. I drew up the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\"1. As long as general peace is not yet declared, we cannot give up\r\nthe occupied areas; they form part of our great munition works\r\n(factories, railways, sites with buildings, etc.).\r\n\r\n\"2. After the general peace, a plebiscite in Poland, Courland, and\r\nLithuania is to decide the fate of the people there; as to the form in\r\nwhich the vote is to be taken, this remains to be further discussed,\r\nin order that the Russians may have surety that no coercion is used.\r\nApparently, this suits neither party. Situation much worse.\r\n\r\n\"_Afternoon._--Matters still getting worse. Furious wire from\r\nHindenburg about \"renunciation\" of everything; Ludendorff telephoning\r\nevery minute; more furious outbursts, Hoffmann very excited, Kühlmann\r\ntrue to his name and 'cool' as ever. The Russians declare they cannot\r\naccept the vague formulas of the Germans with regard to freedom of\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\"I told Kühlmann and Hoffmann I would go as far as possible with them;\r\nbut should their endeavours fail, then I would enter into separate\r\nnegotiations with the Russians, since Berlin and Petersburg were\r\nreally both opposed to an uninfluenced vote. Austria-Hungary, on the\r\nother hand, desired nothing but final peace. Kühlmann understands my\r\nposition, and says he himself would rather _go_ than let it fail.\r\nAsked me to give him my point of view in writing, as it 'would\r\nstrengthen his position.' Have done so. He has telegraphed it to the\r\nKaiser.\r\n\r\n\"_Evening._--Kühlmann believes matters will be settled--or broken off\r\naltogether--by to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"_December 28, 1917._--General feeling, dull. Fresh outbursts of\r\nviolence from Kreuznach. But at noon a wire from Bussche: Hertling had\r\nspoken with the Kaiser, who is perfectly satisfied. Kühlmann said to\r\nme: 'The Kaiser is the only sensible man in the whole of Germany.'\r\n\r\n\"We have at last agreed about the form of the committee; that is, a\r\ncommittee _ad hoc_ is to be formed in Brest, to work out a plan for\r\nthe evacuation and voting in detail. _Tant bien que mal_, a\r\nprovisional expedient. All home to report; next sitting to be held\r\nJanuary 5, 1918.\r\n\r\n\"Russians again somewhat more cheerful.\r\n\r\n\"This evening at dinner I rose to express thanks on the part of the\r\nRussians and the four Allies to Prince Leopold. He answered at once,\r\nand very neatly, but told me immediately afterwards that I had taken\r\nhim by surprise. As a matter of fact, I had been taken by surprise\r\nmyself; no notice had been given; it was only during the dinner itself\r\nthat the Germans asked me to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Left at 10 P.M. for Vienna.\r\n\r\n\"From the 29th to the morning of the 3rd I was in Vienna. Two long\r\naudiences with the Emperor gave me the opportunity of telling him what\r\nhad passed at Brest. He fully approves, of course, the point of view\r\nthat peace must be made, if at all possible.\r\n\r\n\"I have dispatched a trustworthy agent to the outer provinces in order\r\nto ascertain the exact state of feeling there. He reports that _all_\r\nare against the Bolsheviks except the Bolsheviks themselves. The\r\nentire body of citizens, peasants--in a word, everyone with any\r\npossessions at all--trembles at the thought of these red robbers, and\r\nwishes to go over to Germany. The terrorism of Lenin is said to be\r\nindescribable, and in Petersburg all are absolutely _longing_ for the\r\nentry of the German troops to deliver them.\r\n\r\n\"_January 3, 1918._--Return to Brest.\r\n\r\n\"On the way, at 6 P.M., I received, at a station, the following\r\ntelegram, in code, from Baron Gautsch, who had remained at Brest:\r\n\r\n  \"'Russian delegation received following telegram from Petersburg\r\n  this morning: To General Hoffmann. For the representatives of the\r\n  German, Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian and Turkish delegations. The\r\n  Government of the Russian Republic considers it necessary to carry\r\n  on the further negotiations on neutral ground, and proposes\r\n  removing to Stockholm. Regarding attitude to the proposals as\r\n  formulated by the German and Austro-Hungarian delegation in Points\r\n  1 and 2, the Government of the Russian Republic and the\r\n  Pan-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Councils of\r\n  Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies consider, in entire\r\n  agreement with the view expressed by our delegation, that the\r\n  proposals are contrary to the principle of national\r\n  self-determination, even in the restricted form in which it\r\n  appears in Point 3 of the reply given by the Four Powers on the\r\n  12th ult. President of the Russian Delegation, A. Joffe.\" Major\r\n  Brinkmann has communicated this by telephone to the German\r\n  delegation, already on the way here. Herr von Kühlmann has sent a\r\n  telephone message in return that he is continuing the journey, and\r\n  will arrive at Brest this evening.'\r\n\r\n\"I also went on of course, considering this manoeuvre on the part of\r\nthe Russians as rather in the nature of bluffing. If they do not come,\r\nthen we can treat with the Ukrainians, who should be in Brest by now.\r\n\r\n\"In Vienna I saw, among politicians, Baernreither, Hauser, Wekerle,\r\nSeidler, and some few others. The opinion of almost all may be summed\r\nup as follows: 'Peace _must_ be arranged, but a separate peace without\r\nGermany is _impossible_.'\r\n\r\n\"No one has told me how I am to manage it if neither Germany nor\r\nRussia will listen to reason.\r\n\r\n\"_January 4, 1918._--Fearful snowstorm in the night; the heating\r\napparatus in the train was frozen, and the journey consequently far\r\nfrom pleasant. On awaking early at Brest the trains of the Bulgarians\r\nand Turks were standing on adjacent sidings. Weather magnificent now:\r\ncold, and the air as at St. Moritz. I went across to Kühlmann, had\r\nbreakfast with him, and talked over events in Berlin. There seems to\r\nhave been desperate excitement there. Kühlmann suggested to Ludendorff\r\nthat he should come to Brest himself and take part in the\r\nnegotiations. After long discussion, however, it appeared that\r\nLudendorff himself was not quite clear as to what he wanted, and\r\ndeclared spontaneously that he considered it superfluous for him to go\r\nto Brest; he would, at best, 'only spoil things if he did.' Heaven\r\ngrant the man such gleams of insight again, and often! It seems as if\r\nthe whole trouble is more due to feeling against Kühlmann than to\r\nanything in the questions at issue; people do not want the world to\r\nhave the impression that the peace was gained by 'adroit diplomacy,'\r\nbut by military success alone. General Hoffmann appears to have been\r\nreceived with marked favour by the Kaiser, and both he and Kühlmann\r\ndeclare themselves well satisfied with the results of their journey.\r\n\r\n\"We talked over the reply to the Petersburg telegram, declining a\r\nconference in Stockholm, and further tactics to be followed in case of\r\nneed. We agreed that if the Russians did not come, we must declare the\r\narmistice at an end, and chance what the Petersburgers would say to\r\nthat. On this point Kühlmann and I were entirely agreed. Nevertheless,\r\nthe feeling, both in our party and in that of the Germans, was not a\r\nlittle depressed. Certainly, if the Russians do break off\r\nnegotiations, it will place us in a very unpleasant position. The only\r\nway to save the situation is by acting quickly and energetically with\r\nthe Ukrainian delegation, and we therefore commenced this work on the\r\nafternoon of the same day. There is thus at least a hope that we may\r\nbe able to arrive at positive results with them within reasonable\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"In the evening, after dinner, came a wire from Petersburg announcing\r\nthe arrival of the delegation, including the Foreign Minister,\r\nTrotski. It was interesting to see the delight of all the Germans at\r\nthe news; not until this sudden and violent outbreak of satisfaction\r\nwas it fully apparent how seriously they had been affected by the\r\nthought that the Russians would not come. Undoubtedly this is a great\r\nstep forward, and we all feel that peace is really now on the way.\r\n\r\n\"_January 5, 1918._--At seven this morning a few of us went out\r\nshooting with Prince Leopold of Bavaria. We went for a distance of 20\r\nto 30 kilometres by train, and then in open automobiles to a\r\nmagnificent primeval forest extending over two to three hundred square\r\nkilometres. Weather very cold, but fine, much snow, and pleasant\r\ncompany. From the point of view of sport, it was poorer than one could\r\nhave expected. One of the Prince's aides stuck a pig, another shot two\r\nhares, and that was all. Back at 6 P.M.\r\n\r\n\"_January 6, 1918._--To-day we had the first discussions with the\r\nUkrainian delegates, all of whom were present except the leader. The\r\nUkrainians are very different from the Russian delegates. Far less\r\nrevolutionary, and with far more interest in their own country, less\r\nin the progress of Socialism generally. They do not really care about\r\nRussia at all, but think only of the Ukraine, and their efforts are\r\nsolely directed towards attaining their own independence as soon as\r\npossible. Whether that independence is to be complete and\r\ninternational, or only as within the bounds of a Russian federative\r\nstate, they do not seem quite to know themselves. Evidently, the very\r\nintelligent Ukrainian delegates intended to use us as a springboard\r\nfrom which they themselves could spring upon the Bolsheviks. Their\r\nidea was that we should acknowledge their independence, and then, with\r\nthis as a _fait accompli_, they could face the Bolsheviks and force\r\nthem to recognise their equal standing and treat with them on that\r\nbasis. Our line of policy, however, must be either to bring over the\r\nUkrainians to our peace basis, or else to drive a wedge between them\r\nand the Petersburgers. As to their desire for independence, we\r\ndeclared ourselves willing to recognise this, provided the Ukrainians\r\non their part would agree to the following three points: 1. The\r\nnegotiations to be concluded at Brest-Litovsk and not at Stockholm. 2.\r\nRecognition of the former political frontier between Austria-Hungary\r\nand Ukraine. 3. Non-interference of any one state in the internal\r\naffairs of another. Characteristically enough, no answer has yet been\r\nreceived to this proposal!\r\n\r\n\"_January 7, 1918._--This forenoon, all the Russians arrived, under\r\nthe leadership of Trotski. They at once sent a message asking to be\r\nexcused for not appearing at meals with the rest for the future. At\r\nother times also we see nothing of them. The wind seems to be in a\r\nvery different quarter now from what it was. The German officer who\r\naccompanied the Russian delegation from Dunaburg, Captain Baron\r\nLamezan, gave us some interesting details as to this. In the first\r\nplace, he declared that the trenches in front of Dunaburg are entirely\r\ndeserted, and save for an outpost or so there were no Russians there\r\nat all; also, that at many stations delegates were waiting for the\r\ndeputation to pass, in order to demand that peace should be made.\r\nTrotski had throughout answered them with polite and careful\r\nspeeches, but grew ever more and more depressed. Baron Lamezan had the\r\nimpression that the Russians were altogether desperate now, having no\r\nchoice save between going back with a bad peace or with no peace at\r\nall; in either case with the same result: that they would be swept\r\naway. Kühlmann said: 'Ils n'ont que le choix à quelle sauce ils se\r\nferont manger.' I answered: 'Tout comme chez nous.'\r\n\r\n\"A wire has just come in reporting demonstrations in Budapest against\r\nGermany. The windows of the German Consulate were broken, a clear\r\nindication of the state of feeling which would arise if the peace were\r\nto be lost through our demands.\r\n\r\n\"_January 8, 1918._--The Turkish Grand Vizier, Talaat Pasha, arrived\r\nduring the night, and has just been to call on me. He seems\r\nemphatically in favour of making peace; but I fancy he would like, in\r\ncase of any conflict arising with Germany, to push me into the\r\nforeground and keep out of the way himself. Talaat Pasha is one of the\r\ncleverest heads among the Turks, and perhaps the most energetic man of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\n\"Before the Revolution he was a minor official in the telegraph\r\nservice, and was on the revolutionary committee. In his official\r\ncapacity, he got hold of a telegram from the Government which showed\r\nhim that the revolutionary movement would be discovered and the game\r\nbe lost unless immediate action were taken. He suppressed the message,\r\nwarned the revolutionary committee, and persuaded them to start their\r\nwork at once. The coup succeeded, the Sultan was deposed, and Talaat\r\nwas made Minister of the Interior. With iron energy he then turned his\r\nattention to the suppression of the opposing movement. Later, he\r\nbecame Grand Vizier, and impersonated, together with Enver Pasha, the\r\nwill and power of Turkey.\r\n\r\n\"This afternoon, first a meeting of the five heads of the allied\r\ndelegations and the Russian. Afterwards, plenary sitting.\r\n\r\n\"The sitting postponed again, as the Ukrainians are still not ready\r\nwith their preparations. Late in the evening I had a conversation with\r\nKühlmann and Hoffmann, in which we agreed fairly well as to tactics. I\r\nsaid again that I was ready to stand by them and hold to their demands\r\nas far as ever possible, but in the event of Germany's breaking off\r\nthe negotiations with Russia I must reserve the right to act with a\r\nfree hand. Both appeared to understand my point of view, especially\r\nKühlmann, who, if he alone should decide, would certainly not allow\r\nthe negotiations to prove fruitless. As to details, we agreed to\r\ndemand continuation of the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk in the form\r\nof an ultimatum.\r\n\r\n\"_January 9, 1918._--Acting on the principle that attack is the best\r\ndefence, we had determined not to let the Russian Foreign Minister\r\nspeak at all, but to go at him at once with our ultimatum.\r\n\r\n\"Trotski had prepared a long speech, and the effect of our attack was\r\nsuch that he at once appealed for adjournment, urging that the altered\r\nstate of affairs called for new resolutions. The removal of the\r\nconference to Stockholm would have meant the end of matters for us,\r\nfor it would have been utterly impossible to keep the Bolsheviks of\r\nall countries from putting in an appearance there, and the very thing\r\nwe had endeavoured with the utmost of our power to avoid from the\r\nstart--to have the reins torn from our hands and these elements take\r\nthe lead--would infallibly have taken place. We must now wait to see\r\nwhat to-morrow brings: either a victory or the final termination of\r\nthe negotiations.\r\n\r\n\"Adler said to me in Vienna: 'You will certainly get on all right with\r\nTrotski,' and when I asked him why he thought so, he answered: 'Well,\r\nyou and I get on quite well together, you know.'\r\n\r\n\"I think, after all, the clever old man failed to appreciate the\r\nsituation there. These Bolsheviks have no longer anything in common\r\nwith Adler; they are brutal tyrants, autocrats of the worst kind, a\r\ndisgrace to the name of freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Trotski is undoubtedly an interesting, clever fellow, and a very\r\ndangerous adversary. He is quite exceptionally gifted as a speaker,\r\nwith a swiftness and adroitness in retort which I have rarely seen,\r\nand has, moreover, all the insolent boldness of his race.\r\n\r\n\"_January 10, 1918._--The sitting has just taken place. Trotski made a\r\ngreat and, in its way, really fine speech, calculated for the whole of\r\nEurope, in which he gave way entirely. He accepts, he says, the\r\nGerman-Austria 'ultimatum,' and will remain in Brest-Litovsk, as he\r\nwill not give us the satisfaction of being able to blame Russia for\r\nthe continuance of the war.\r\n\r\n\"Following on Trotski's speech, the Committee was at once formed to\r\ndeal with the difficult questions of territory. I insisted on being on\r\nthe Committee myself, wishing to follow throughout the progress of\r\nthese important negotiations. This was not an easy matter really, as\r\nthe questions involved, strictly speaking, concern only Courland and\r\nLithuania, i.e., they are not our business, but Germany's alone.\r\n\r\n\"In the evening I had another long talk with Kühlmann and Hoffmann, in\r\nthe course of which the General and the Secretary of State came to\r\nhigh words between themselves. Hoffmann, elated at the success of our\r\nultimatum to Russia, wished to go on in the same fashion and 'give the\r\nRussians another touch of the whip.' Kühlmann and I took the opposite\r\nview, and insisted that proceedings should be commenced quietly,\r\nconfining ourselves to the matters in hand, clearing up point by point\r\nas we went on, and putting all doubtful questions aside. Once we had\r\ngot so far, in clearing up things generally, we could then take that\r\nwhich remained together, and possibly get telegraphic instructions\r\nfrom the two Emperors for dealing therewith. This is undoubtedly the\r\nsurest way to avoid disaster and a fresh breach.\r\n\r\n\"A new conflict has cropped up with the Ukrainians. They now demand\r\nrecognition of their independence, and declare they will leave if this\r\nis not conceded.\r\n\r\n\"Adler told me at Vienna that Trotski had his library, by which he set\r\ngreat store, somewhere in Vienna, with a Herr Bauer, I fancy. I told\r\nTrotski that I would arrange to have the books forwarded to him, if\r\nhe cared about it. I then recommended to his consideration certain\r\nprisoners of war, as L. K. and W., all of whom are said to have been\r\nvery badly treated. Trotski noted the point, declared that he was\r\nstrongly opposed to ill-treatment of prisoners of war, and promised to\r\nlook into the matter; he wished to point out, however, that in so\r\ndoing he was not in the least influenced by the thought of his\r\nlibrary; he would in any case have considered my request. He would be\r\nglad to have the books.\r\n\r\n\"_January 11, 1918._--Forenoon and afternoon, long sittings of the\r\nCommittee on territorial questions. Our side is represented by\r\nKühlmann, Hoffmann, Rosenberg, and a secretary, in addition to myself,\r\nCsicserics, Wiesner, and Colloredo. The Russians are all present, but\r\nwithout the Ukrainians. I told Kühlmann that I only proposed to attend\r\nas a second, seeing that the German interests were incomparably more\r\naffected than our own. I only interpose now and again.\r\n\r\n\"Trotski made a tactical blunder this afternoon. In a speech rising to\r\nviolence, he declared that we were playing false; we aimed at\r\nannexations, and were simply trying to cover them with the cloak of\r\nself-determination. He would never agree to this, and would rather\r\nbreak off altogether than continue in that way. If we were honest, we\r\nshould allow representatives from Poland, Courland, and Lithuania to\r\ncome to Brest, and there express their views without being influenced\r\nin any way by ourselves. Now it should here be noted that from the\r\ncommencement of the negotiations it has been a point of conflict\r\nwhether the legislative bodies at present existing in the occupied\r\nterritories are justified in speaking in the name of their respective\r\npeoples, or not. We affirm that they are; the Russians maintain they\r\nare not. We at once accepted Trotski's proposal, that representatives\r\nof these countries should be called, but added that, when we agreed to\r\naccept their testimony, then their judgment if in our favour should be\r\ntaken as valid.\r\n\r\n\"It was characteristic to see how gladly Trotski would have taken back\r\nwhat he had said. But he kept his countenance, fell in with the new\r\nsituation at once, and requested that the sitting be adjourned for\r\ntwenty-four hours, as our reply was of such far-reaching importance\r\nthat he must confer with his colleagues on the matter. I hope Trotski\r\nwill make no difficulty now. If the Poles could be called, it would be\r\nan advantage. The awkward thing about it is that Germany, too, would\r\nrather be without them, knowing the anti-Prussian feeling that exists\r\namong the Poles.\r\n\r\n\"_January 12, 1918._--Radek has had a scene with the German chauffeur,\r\nwhich led to something more. General Hoffmann had placed cars at the\r\ndisposal of the Russians in case they cared to drive out. On this\r\noccasion it happened that the chauffeur was not there at the proper\r\ntime, and Radek flew into a rage with the man and abused him\r\nviolently. The chauffeur complained, and Hoffmann took his part.\r\nTrotski seems to consider Hoffmann's action correct, and has\r\n_forbidden_ the entire delegation to go out any more. That settled\r\nthem. And serve them right.\r\n\r\n\"No one ventured to protest. They have indeed a holy fear of Trotski.\r\nAt the sittings, too, none of them dare to speak while he is there.\r\n\r\n\"_January 12, 1918._--Hoffmann has made his unfortunate speech. He has\r\nbeen working at it for days, and was very proud of the result.\r\nKühlmann and I did not conceal from him that he gained nothing by it\r\nbeyond exciting the people at home against us. This made a certain\r\nimpression on him, but it was soon effaced by Ludendorff's\r\ncongratulations, which followed promptly. Anyhow, it has rendered the\r\nsituation more difficult, and there was certainly no need for that.\r\n\r\n\"_January 15, 1918._--I had a letter to-day from one of our mayors at\r\nhome, calling my attention to the fact that disaster due to lack of\r\nfoodstuffs is now imminent.\r\n\r\n\"I immediately telegraphed the Emperor as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"'I have just received a letter from Statthalter N.N. which\r\n  justifies all the fears I have constantly repeated to Your\r\n  Majesty, and shows that in the question of food supply we are on\r\n  the very verge of a catastrophe. The situation _arising out of the\r\n  carelessness and incapacity of the Ministers_ is terrible, and I\r\n  fear it is already too late to check the total collapse which is\r\n  to be expected in the next few weeks. My informant writes: \"Only\r\n  small quantities are now being received from Hungary, from\r\n  Roumania only 10,000 wagons of maize; this gives then a decrease\r\n  of at least 30,000 wagons of grain, without which we must\r\n  infallibly perish. On learning the state of affairs, I went to the\r\n  Prime Minister to speak with him about it. I told him, as is the\r\n  case, that in a few weeks our war industries, our railway traffic,\r\n  would be at a standstill, the provisioning of the army would be\r\n  impossible, it must break down, and that would mean the collapse\r\n  of Austria and therewith also of Hungary. To each of these points\r\n  he answered yes, that is so, and added that all was being done to\r\n  alter the state of affairs, especially as regards the Hungarian\r\n  deliveries. But no one, not even His Majesty, has been able to get\r\n  anything done. We can only hope that some _deus ex machina_ may\r\n  intervene to save us from the worst.'\"\r\n\r\n\"To this I added:\r\n\r\n  \"'I can find no words to describe properly the apathetic attitude\r\n  of Seidler. How often and how earnestly have I not implored Your\r\n  Majesty to intervene forcibly for once and _compel_ Seidler, on\r\n  the one hand, and Hadik, on the other, to set these things in\r\n  order. Even from here I have written entreating Your Majesty to\r\n  act while there was yet time. But all in vain.'\r\n\r\n\"I then pointed out that the only way of meeting the situation would\r\nbe to secure temporary assistance from Germany, and then to\r\nrequisition by force the stocks that were doubtless still available in\r\nHungary; finally, I begged the Emperor to inform the Austrian Prime\r\nMinister of my telegram.\r\n\r\n\"_January 16, 1918._--Despairing appeals from Vienna for food\r\nsupplies. Would I apply at once to Berlin for aid, otherwise disaster\r\nimminent. I replied to General Landwehr as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"'Dr. Kühlmann is telegraphing to Berlin, but has little hope of\r\n  success. The only hope now is for His Majesty to do as I have\r\n  advised, and send an urgent wire at once to Kaiser Wilhelm. On my\r\n  return I propose to put before His Majesty my point of view, that\r\n  it is impossible to carry on the foreign policy if the food\r\n  question at home is allowed to come to such a state as now.\r\n\r\n  \"'Only a few weeks back your Excellency declared most positively\r\n  that we could hold out till the new harvest.'\r\n\r\n\"At the same time I wired the Emperor:\r\n\r\n  \"'Telegrams arriving show the situation becoming critical for us.\r\n  Regarding question of food, we can only avoid collapse on two\r\n  conditions: first, that Germany helps us temporarily, second, that\r\n  we use this respite to set in order our machinery of food supply,\r\n  which is at present beneath contempt, and to gain possession of\r\n  the stocks still existing in Hungary.\r\n\r\n  \"'I have just explained the entire situation to Dr. Kühlmann, and\r\n  he is telegraphing to Berlin. He, however, is not at all sanguine,\r\n  as Germany is itself in straitened circumstances. I think the only\r\n  way to secure any success from this step would be for Your Majesty\r\n  to send at once, through military means, a Hughes telegram to\r\n  Kaiser Wilhelm direct, urgently entreating him to intervene\r\n  himself, and by securing us a supply of grain prevent the outbreak\r\n  of revolution, which would otherwise be inevitable. I must,\r\n  however, emphatically point out that the commencement of unrest\r\n  among our people at home will have rendered conclusion of peace\r\n  here absolutely impossible. As soon as the Russian representatives\r\n  perceive that we ourselves are on the point of revolution, they\r\n  will not make peace at all, since their entire speculation is\r\n  based on this factor.'\r\n\r\n\"_January 17, 1918._--Bad news from Vienna and environs: serious\r\nstrike movement, due to the reduction of the flour rations and the\r\ntardy progress of the Brest negotiations. The weakness of the Vienna\r\nMinistry seems to be past all understanding.\r\n\r\n\"I have telegraphed to Vienna that I hope in time to secure some\r\nsupplies from the Ukraine, if only we can manage to keep matters quiet\r\nat home for the next few weeks, and I have begged the gentlemen in\r\nquestion to do their utmost not to wreck the peace here. On the same\r\nday, in the evening, I telegraphed to Dr. von Seidler, the Prime\r\nMinister:\r\n\r\n  \"'I very greatly regret my inability to counteract the effect of\r\n  all the errors made by those entrusted with the food resources.\r\n\r\n  \"'Germany declares categorically that it is unable to help us,\r\n  having insufficient for itself.\r\n\r\n  \"'Had your Excellency or your department called attention to the\r\n  state of things _in time_, it might still have been possible to\r\n  procure supplies from Roumania. As things are now, I can see no\r\n  other way than that of brute force, by requisitioning Hungarian\r\n  grain for the time being, and forwarding it to Austria, until the\r\n  Roumanian, and it is to be hoped also Ukrainian, supplies can come\r\n  to hand.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL HOFFMANN (on right) WITH MAJ. BRINKMANN]\r\n\r\n\"_January 20, 1918._--The negotiations have now come to this: that\r\nTrotski declares his intention of laying the German proposals before\r\nPetersburg, though he cannot accept them himself; he undertakes, in\r\nany case, to return here. As to calling in representatives from the\r\nouter provinces, he will only do this provided he is allowed to choose\r\nthem. We cannot agree to this. With the Ukrainians, who, despite their\r\nyouth, are showing themselves quite sufficiently grown to profit by\r\nthe situation, negotiations are proceeding but slowly. First they\r\ndemanded East Galicia for the new 'Ukrainia.' This could not be\r\nentertained for a moment. Then they grew more modest, but since the\r\noutbreak of trouble at home among ourselves they realise our position,\r\nand know that we _must_ make peace in order to get corn. Now they\r\ndemand a separate position for East Galicia. The question will have to\r\nbe decided in Vienna, and the Austrian Ministry will have the final\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\"Seidler and Landwehr again declare by telegram that without supplies\r\nof grain from Ukraine the catastrophe is imminent. There _are_\r\nsupplies in the Ukraine; if we can get them, the worst may be avoided.\r\n\r\n\"The position now is this: Without help from outside, we shall,\r\naccording to Seidler, have thousands perishing in a few weeks. Germany\r\nand Hungary are no longer sending anything. All messages state that\r\nthere is a great surplus in Ukraine. The question is only whether we\r\ncan get it in time. I hope we may. But if we do not make peace _soon_,\r\nthen the troubles at home will be repeated, and each demonstration in\r\nVienna will render peace here most costly to obtain, for Messrs.\r\nSewrjuk and Lewicky can read the degree of our state of famine at\r\nhome from these troubles as by a thermometer. If only the people who\r\ncreate these disturbances know how they are by that very fact\r\nincreasing the difficulty of procuring supplies from Ukraine! And we\r\nwere all but finished!\r\n\r\n\"The question of East Galicia I will leave to the Austrian Ministry;\r\nit must be decided in Vienna. I cannot, and dare not, look on and see\r\nhundreds of thousands starve for the sake of retaining the sympathy of\r\nthe Poles, so long as there is a possibility of help.\r\n\r\n\"_January 21, 1918._--Back to Vienna. The impression of the troubles\r\nhere is even greater than I thought, and the effect disastrous. The\r\nUkrainians no longer treat with us: they _dictate_!\r\n\r\n\"On the way, reading through old reports, I came upon the notes\r\nrelating to the discussions with Michaelis on August 1. According to\r\nthese, Under-Secretary of State von Stumm said at the time:\r\n\r\n\"'The Foreign Ministry was in communication with the Ukrainians, and\r\nthe separatist movement in Ukrainia was very strong. In furtherance of\r\ntheir movement, the Ukrainians demanded the assurance that they should\r\nbe allowed to unite with the Government of Cholm, and with the areas\r\nof East Galicia occupied by Ukrainians. So long as Galicia belongs to\r\nAustria, the demand for East Galicia cannot be conceded. It would be\r\nanother matter if Galicia were united with Poland; then a cession of\r\nEast Galicia might be possible.'\r\n\r\n\"It would seem that the unpleasant case had long since been prejudged\r\nby the Germans.\r\n\r\n\"On January 22 the Council was held which was to determine the issue\r\nof the Ukrainian question. The Emperor opened the proceedings, and\r\nthen called on me to speak. I described first of all the difficulties\r\nthat lay in the way of a peace with Petersburg, which will be apparent\r\nfrom the foregoing entries in this diary. I expressed my doubt as to\r\nwhether our group would succeed in concluding general peace with\r\nPetersburg. I then sketched the course of the negotiations with the\r\nUkrainians. I reported that the Ukrainians had originally demanded the\r\ncession of East Galicia, but that I had refused this. With regard to\r\nthe Ruthenian districts of Hungary also they had made demands which\r\nhad been refused by me. At present, they demanded the division of\r\nGalicia into two parts, and the formation of an independent Austrian\r\nprovince from East Galicia and Bukovina. I pointed out the serious\r\nconsequences which the acceptance of the Ukrainian demands would have\r\nupon the further development of the Austro-Polish question. The\r\nconcessions made by the Ukrainians on their part were to consist in\r\nthe inclusion in the peace treaty of a commercial agreement which\r\nshould enable us to cover our immediate needs in the matter of grain\r\nsupplies. Furthermore, Austria-Hungary would insist on full\r\nreciprocity for the Poles resident in Ukraine.\r\n\r\n\"I pointed out emphatically that I considered it my duty to state the\r\nposition of the peace negotiations; that the decision could not lie\r\nwith me, but with the Ministry as a whole, in particular with the\r\nAustrian Prime Minister. The Austrian Government would have to decide\r\nwhether these sacrifices could be made or not, and here I could leave\r\nthem in no doubt that if we declined the Ukrainian demands we should\r\nprobably come to no result with that country, and should thus be\r\ncompelled to return from Brest-Litovsk without having achieved any\r\npeace settlement at all.\r\n\r\n\"When I had finished, the Prime Minister, Dr. von Seidler, rose to\r\nspeak. He pointed out first of all the necessity of an immediate\r\npeace, and then discussed the question of establishing a Ukrainian\r\ncrown land, especially from the parliamentary point of view. Seidler\r\nbelieved that despite the active opposition which was to be expected\r\nfrom the Poles, he would still have a majority of two-thirds in the\r\nHouse for the acceptance of the bill on the subject. He was not blind\r\nto the fact that arrangement would give rise to violent parliamentary\r\nconflicts, but repeated his hope that a two-thirds majority could be\r\nobtained despite the opposition of the Polish Delegation. After\r\nSeidler came the Hungarian Prime Minister, Dr. Wekerle. He was\r\nparticularly pleased to note that no concessions had been made to the\r\nUkrainians with regard to the Ruthenians resident in Hungary. A clear\r\ndivision of the nationalities in Hungary was impracticable. The\r\nHungarian Ruthenians were also at too low a stage of culture to enable\r\nthem to be given national independence. Dr. Wekerle also laid stress\r\non the danger, alike in Austria, of allowing any interference from\r\nwithout; the risk of any such proceeding would be very great, we\r\nshould find ourselves on a downward grade by so doing, and we must\r\nhold firmly to the principle that no interference in the affairs of\r\nthe Monarchy from without could be tolerated. In summing up, however,\r\nWekerle opposed the point of view of the Austrian Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\"I then rose again to speak, and declared that I was perfectly aware\r\nof the eminent importance and perilous aspects of this step. It was\r\ntrue that it would bring us on to a down-grade, but from all\r\nappearances, we had been in that position already for a long time,\r\nowing to the war, and could not say how far it might lead us. I put\r\nthe positive question to Dr. Wekerle, what was a responsible leader of\r\nour foreign policy to do when the Austrian Prime Minister and both the\r\nMinisters of Food unanimously declared that the Hungarian supplies\r\nwould only suffice to help us over the next two months, after which\r\ntime a collapse would be absolutely unavoidable, unless we could\r\nsecure assistance from somewhere in the way of corn? On being\r\ninterrupted here by a dissentient observation from Dr. Wekerle, I told\r\nhim that if he, Wekerle, could bring corn into Austria I should be the\r\nfirst to support his point of view, and that with pleasure, but so\r\nlong as he stood by his categorical denial, and insisted on his\r\ninability to help us, we were in the position of a man on the third\r\nfloor of a burning house who jumps out of the window to save himself.\r\nA man in such a situation would not stop to think whether he risked\r\nbreaking his legs or not; he would prefer the risk of death to the\r\ncertainty of the same. If the position really were as stated, that in\r\na couple of months we should be altogether without food supplies, then\r\nwe must take the consequences of such a position. Dr. von Seidler\r\nhere once more took up the discussion, and declared himself entirely\r\nin agreement with my remarks.\r\n\r\n\"During the further course of the debate, the probability of a\r\ndefinitive failure of the Austro-Polish solution in connection with\r\nthe Ukrainian peace was discussed, and the question was raised as to\r\nwhat new constellation would arise out of such failure. Sektionschef\r\nDr. Gratz then took up this question. Dr. Gratz pointed out that the\r\nAustro-Polish solution must fail even without acceptance of the\r\nUkrainian demands, since the German postulates rendered solution\r\nimpossible. The Germans demanded, apart from quite enormous\r\nterritorial reductions of Congress-Poland, the restriction of Polish\r\nindustry, part possession of the Polish railways and State domains, as\r\nwell as the imposition of part of the costs of war upon the Poles. We\r\ncould not attach ourselves to a Poland thus weakened, hardly, indeed,\r\ncapable of living at all, and necessarily highly dissatisfied with its\r\nposition. Dr. Gratz maintained that it would be wiser to come back to\r\nthe programme already discussed in general form; the project, by which\r\nUnited Poland should be left to Germany, and the attachment of\r\nRoumania to the Monarchy in consequence. Dr. Gratz went at length into\r\nthe details of this point of view. The Emperor then summed up the\r\nessence of the opinions expressed to-day as indicating that it was\r\nprimarily necessary to make peace with Petersburg and the Ukrainians,\r\nand that negotiations should be entered upon with Ukrainia as to the\r\ndivision of Galicia. The question as to whether the Austro-Polish\r\nsolution should be definitely allowed to drop was not finally settled,\r\nbut shelved for the time being.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, Dr. Burian, the Minister of Finance, rose to speak,\r\nand pointed out, as Dr. Wekerle had done, the danger of the Austrian\r\nstandpoint. Burian declared that, while the war might doubtless change\r\nthe internal structure of the Monarchy, such alteration must be made\r\nfrom within, not from without, if it were to be of any benefit to the\r\nMonarchy at all. He further pointed out that if the Austrian principle\r\nof the division of Galicia were to be carried through, the _form_ of\r\nso doing would be of great importance. Baron Burian advised that a\r\nclause referring to this should be inserted, not in the instrument of\r\npeace itself, but in a secret annexe. This form was, in his, Burian's,\r\nview, the only possible means of diminishing the serious consequences\r\nof the steps which the Austrian Government wished to take.\"\r\n\r\nThus the notes in my diary relative to this Council. The Austrian\r\nGovernment was thus not only agreed as to the proposed arrangement\r\nwith the Ukraine; it was indeed at the direct wish of the Government,\r\nby its instigation and on its responsibility, that it was brought\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\"_January 28, 1918._--Reached Brest this evening.\r\n\r\n\"_January 29, 1918._--Trotski arrived.\r\n\r\n\"_January 30, 1918._--The first plenary session has been held. There\r\nis no doubt that the revolutionary happenings in Austria and in\r\nGermany have enormously raised the hopes of the Petersburgers for a\r\ngeneral convulsion, and it seems to me altogether out of the question\r\nnow to come to any peace terms with the Russians. It is evident among\r\nthe Russians themselves that they positively expect the outbreak of a\r\nworld-revolution within the next few weeks, and their tactics now are\r\nsimply to gain time and wait for this to happen. The conference was\r\nnot marked by any particular event, only pin-pricks between Kühlmann\r\nand Trotski. To-day is the first sitting of the Committee on\r\nterritorial questions, where I am to preside, and deal with our\r\nterritorial affairs.\r\n\r\n\"The only interesting point about the new constellation seems to be\r\nthat the relations between Petersburg and Kieff are considerably worse\r\nthan before, and the Kieff Committee is no longer recognised at all by\r\nthe Bolsheviks as independent.\r\n\r\n\"_February 1, 1918._--Sitting of the Territorial Committee, I myself\r\npresiding, with the Petersburg Russians. My plan is to play the\r\nPetersburgers and the Ukrainians one against the other, and manage at\r\nleast to make peace with one of the two parties. I have still some\r\nslight hope that a peace with one may so affect the other that\r\npossibly peace with both may be attained.\r\n\r\n\"As was to be expected, Trotski replied to my question, whether he\r\nadmitted that the Ukrainians should treat with us alone on questions\r\ndealing with their frontiers, with an emphatic denial. I then, after\r\nsome exchange of words, proposed that the sitting be adjourned, and a\r\nplenary sitting convened, in order that the matter might be dealt with\r\nby the Kieff and Petersburg parties together.\r\n\r\n\"_February 2, 1918._--I have tried to get the Ukrainians to talk over\r\nthings openly with the Russians, and succeeded almost too well. The\r\ninsults hurled by the Ukrainians to-day against the Russians were\r\nsimply grotesque, and showed what a gulf is fixed between these two\r\nGovernments, and that it is not our fault that we have not been able\r\nto bring them together under one hat on the question of peace. Trotski\r\nwas so upset it was painful to see. Perfectly pale, he stared fixedly\r\nbefore him, drawing nervously on his blotting paper. Heavy drops of\r\nsweat trickled down his forehead. Evidently he felt deeply the\r\ndisgrace of being abused by his fellow-citizens in the presence of the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n\"The two brothers Richthofen were here a little while ago. The elder\r\nhas shot down some sixty, the younger 'only' some thirty enemy\r\nairmen. The elder's face is like that of a young and pretty girl. He\r\ntold me 'how the thing is done.' It is very simple. Only get as near\r\nto the enemy as possible, from behind, and then keep on shooting,\r\nwhen the other man would fall. The one thing needful was to 'get over\r\nyour own fright,' and not be shy of getting quite close to your\r\nopponent.--Modern heroes.\r\n\r\n\"Two charming stories were told about these two brothers. The English\r\nhad put a price on the head of the elder Richthofen. When he learned\r\nof this, he sent down broadsheets informing them that to make matters\r\neasier for them, he would from the following day have his machine\r\npainted bright red. Next morning, going to the shed, he found all the\r\nmachines there painted bright red. One for all and all for one.\r\n\r\n\"The other story is this: Richthofen and an English airman were\r\ncircling round each other and firing furiously. They came closer and\r\ncloser, and soon they could distinctly see each other's faces.\r\nSuddenly something went wrong with Richthofen's machine-gun, and he\r\ncould not shoot. The Englishman looked across in surprise, and seeing\r\nwhat was wrong, waved his hand, turned and flew off. Fair play! I\r\nshould like to meet that Englishman, only to tell him that he is\r\ngreater, to my mind, than the heroes of old.\r\n\r\n\"_February 3, 1918._--Started for Berlin. Kühlmann, Hoffmann,\r\nColloredo.\r\n\r\n\"_February 4, 1918._--Arrived Berlin. Nothing this afternoon, as the\r\nGermans are holding council among themselves.\r\n\r\n\"_February 5, 1918._--Sitting all day. I had several violent passages\r\nof arms with Ludendorff. Matters seemed to be clearing up, though this\r\nis not yet altogether done. Apart from deciding on our tactics for\r\nBrest, we have at last to set down _in writing_ that we are only\r\nobliged to fight for the pre-war possessions of Germany. Ludendorff\r\nwas violently opposed to this, and said, 'If Germany makes peace\r\nwithout profit, then Germany has lost the war.'\r\n\r\n\"The controversy was growing more and more heated, when Hertling\r\nnudged me and whispered: 'Leave him alone, we two will manage it\r\ntogether without him.'\r\n\r\n\"I am now going to work out the draft at once and send it in to\r\nHertling.\r\n\r\n\"Supper this evening at Höhenlohe.\r\n\r\n\"_February 6, 1918._--Arrived Brest this evening. Wiesner has been at\r\nit untiringly and done excellent work; the situation, too, is easier\r\nnow. The leader of the Austrian Ruthenians, Nikolay Wassilko, arrived\r\nyesterday, and albeit evidently excited by the part his\r\nRussian-Ukrainian comrades are playing at Brest, speaks nationally,\r\nfar more chauvinistically than when I thought I knew him in Vienna,\r\nand we have at last agreed on the minimum of the Ukrainian demands. I\r\ngave as my advice in Berlin that we should try to finish with the\r\nUkrainians as soon as possible. I could then in the name of Germany\r\ncommence negotiations with Trotski, and try if I could not get speech\r\nwith him privately, and find out whether any agreement were possible\r\nor not. It is Gratz's idea. After some opposition we agreed.\r\n\r\n\"_February 7, 1918._--My conversation with Trotski took place. I took\r\nGratz with me; he has far exceeded all my expectations of him. I began\r\nby telling Trotski that a breach of the regulations and a resumption\r\nof hostilities were imminent, and wished to know if this could not be\r\navoided before the fatal step were definitely taken. I therefore\r\nbegged Herr Trotski to inform me openly and without reserve what\r\nconditions he would accept. Trotski then declared very frankly and\r\nclearly that he was not so simple as we appeared to think, that he\r\nknew well enough force was the strongest of all arguments, and that\r\nthe Central Powers were quite capable of taking away the Russian\r\nprovinces. He had several times tried to bridge a way for Kühlmann\r\nduring the conference, telling him it was not a question of the right\r\nof self-determination of the peoples in the occupied districts, but of\r\nsheer brutal annexation, and that he must give way to force. He would\r\nnever relinquish his principles, and would never give his consent to\r\nthis interpretation of the right of self-determination. The Germans\r\nmust say straight out what were the boundaries they demanded, and he\r\nwould then make clear to all Europe that it was a brutal annexation\r\nand nothing else, but that Russia was too weak to oppose it. Only the\r\nMoon Sound Islands seemed to be more than he could swallow. Secondly,\r\nand this is very characteristic, Trotski said he could never agree to\r\nour making peace with the Ukraine, since the Ukraine was no longer in\r\nthe hands of its Rada, but in the hands of his troops. It was a part\r\nof Russia, and to make peace with it would be interfering in the\r\ninternal affairs of Russia itself. The fact of the matter seems to be\r\nthat about nineteen days ago the Russian troops really did enter\r\nKieff, but were subsequently driven out, the Rada once more coming\r\ninto power as before. Whether Trotski was unaware of this latter\r\ndevelopment or purposely concealed the truth I cannot say for certain,\r\nbut it seems as if the former were the case.\r\n\r\n\"The last hope of coming to an understanding with Petersburg has\r\nvanished. An appeal from the Petersburg Government to the German\r\nsoldiers has been discovered in Berlin, inciting them to revolt, to\r\nmurder the Kaiser and their generals, and unite with the soviets.\r\nFollowing on this came a telegram from Kaiser Wilhelm to Kühlmann\r\nordering him to terminate negotiations at once, by demanding, besides\r\nCourland and Lithuania, also the unoccupied territories of Livonia and\r\nEsthonia--all without regard to the right of self-determination of the\r\npeoples concerned.\r\n\r\n\"The dastardly behaviour of these Bolsheviks renders negotiation\r\nimpossible. I cannot blame Germany for being incensed at such\r\nproceedings, but the instructions from Berlin are hardly likely to be\r\ncarried out. We do not want to drag in Livonia and Esthonia.\r\n\r\n\"_February 8, 1918._--This evening the peace with Ukraine is to be\r\nsigned. The first peace in this terrible war. I wonder if the Rada is\r\nstill really sitting at Kieff? Wassilko showed me a Hughes message\r\ndated 6th inst. from Kieff to the Ukrainian delegation here, and\r\nTrotski has declined my suggestion to dispatch an officer of the\r\nAustrian General Staff to the spot, in order to bring back reliable\r\ninformation. Evidently, then, his assertion that the Bolsheviks were\r\nalready masters of Kieff was only a ruse. Gratz informs me, by the\r\nway, that Trotski, with whom he spoke early this morning, is much\r\ndepressed at our intention of concluding peace with Ukraine to-day\r\nafter all. This confirms me in my purpose of having it signed. Gratz\r\nhas convened a meeting with the Petersburgers for to-morrow; this will\r\nclear matters up, and show us whether any agreement is possible, or if\r\nwe must break off altogether. In any case, there can be no doubt that\r\nthe intermezzo at Brest is rapidly nearing its end.\"\r\n\r\nAfter conclusion of peace with Ukraine, I received the following\r\ntelegram from the Emperor:\r\n\r\n  \"'_Court train, February 9, 1918._\r\n\r\n  \"'Deeply moved and rejoiced to learn of the conclusion of peace\r\n  with Ukraine. I thank you, dear Count Czernin, from my heart for\r\n  your persevering and successful endeavours.\r\n\r\n  \"'You have thereby given me the happiest day of my hitherto far\r\n  from happy reign, and I pray God Almighty that He may further\r\n  continue to aid you on your difficult path--to the benefit of the\r\n  Monarchy and of our peoples.\r\n\r\n  KARL.'\r\n\r\n\"_February 11, 1918._--Trotski declines to sign. The war is over, but\r\nthere is no peace.\r\n\r\n\"The disastrous effects of the troubles in Vienna will be seen clearly\r\nfrom the following message from Herr von Skrzynski, dated Montreux,\r\nFebruary 12, 1918. Skrzynski writes:\r\n\r\n  \"'I learn from a reliable source that France has issued the\r\n  following notification: We were already quite disposed to enter\r\n  into discussion with Austria. Now we are asking ourselves whether\r\n  Austria is still sound enough for the part it was intended to give\r\n  her. One is afraid of basing an entire policy upon a state which\r\n  is perhaps already threatened with the fate of Russia.' And\r\n  Skrzynski adds: 'During the last few days I have heard as follows:\r\n  It has been decided to wait for a while.'\"\r\n\r\nOur position, then, during the negotiations with Petersburg was as\r\nfollows: We could not induce Germany to resign the idea of Courland\r\nand Lithuania. We had not the physical force to do so. The pressure\r\nexerted by the Supreme Army Command on the one hand and the shifty\r\ntactics of the Russians made this impossible. We had then to choose\r\nbetween leaving Germany to itself, and signing a separate peace, or\r\nacting together with our three Allies and finishing with a peace\r\nincluding the covert annexation of the Russian outer provinces.\r\n\r\nThe former alternative involved the serious risk of making a breach in\r\nthe Quadruple Alliance, where some dissension was already apparent.\r\nThe Alliance could no longer stand such experiments. We were faced\r\nwith the final military efforts now, and the unity of the Allies must\r\nnot in any case be further shaken. On the other hand, the danger that\r\nWilson, the only statesman in the world ready to consider the idea of\r\na peace on mutual understanding, might from the conclusion of such a\r\npeace obtain an erroneous impression as to our intentions. I hoped\r\nthen, and I was not deceived, that this eminently clever man would\r\nsee through the situation and recognise that we were forced to act\r\nunder pressure of circumstances. His speeches delivered after the\r\npeace at Brest confirmed my anticipation.\r\n\r\nThe peace with Ukraine was made under pressure of imminent famine. And\r\nit bears the characteristic marks of such a birth. That is true. But\r\nit is no less true that despite the fact of our having obtained far\r\nless from Ukraine than we had hoped, we should, without these\r\nsupplies, have been unable to carry on at all until the new harvest.\r\nStatistics show that during the spring and summer of 1918 42,000\r\nwagon-loads were received from the Ukraine. It would have been\r\nimpossible to procure these supplies from anywhere else. Millions of\r\nhuman beings were thus saved from death by starvation--and let those\r\nwho sit in judgment on the peace terms bear this in mind.\r\n\r\nIt is also beyond doubt that with the great stocks available in\r\nUkraine, an incomparably greater quantity could have been brought into\r\nAustria if the collecting and transport apparatus had worked\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State for Food Supplies has, at my request, in May,\r\n1919, furnished me with the following statistical data for\r\npublication:\r\n\r\n  Brief survey of the organisation of corn imports from Ukraine (on\r\n  terms of the Brest-Litovsk Peace) and the results of same:\r\n\r\n  When, after great efforts, a suitable agreement had been arrived\r\n  at with Germany as to the apportionment of the Ukrainian supplies,\r\n  a mission was dispatched to Kieff, in which not only Government\r\n  officials but also the best qualified and most experienced experts\r\n  which the Government could procure were represented.\r\n\r\n  Germany and Hungary had also sent experts, among them being\r\n  persons with many years of experience in the Russian grain\r\n  business, and had been in the employ of both German and Entente\r\n  grain houses (as, for instance, the former representative of the\r\n  leading French corn merchants, the house of Louis Dreyfuss).\r\n\r\n  The official mission arrived at Kieff by the middle of March, and\r\n  commenced work at once. A comparatively short time sufficed to\r\n  show that the work would present quite extraordinary difficulties.\r\n\r\n  The Ukrainian Government, which had declared at Brest-Litovsk that\r\n  very great quantities, probably about one million tons, of\r\n  surplus foodstuffs were ready for export, had in the meantime\r\n  been replaced by another Ministry. The Cabinet then in power\r\n  evinced no particular inclination, or at any rate no hurry, to\r\n  fulfil obligations on this scale, but was more disposed to point\r\n  out that it would be altogether impossible, for various reasons,\r\n  to do so.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, the Peace of Brest had provided for a regular exchange\r\n  system, bartering load by load of one article against another. But\r\n  neither Germany nor Austria-Hungary was even approximately in a\r\n  position to furnish the goods (textiles especially were demanded)\r\n  required in exchange.\r\n\r\n  We had then to endeavour to obtain the supplies on credit, and the\r\n  Ukrainian Government agreed, after long and far from easy\r\n  negotiations, to provide _credit valuta_ (against vouchers for\r\n  mark and krone in Berlin and Vienna). The arrangements for this\r\n  were finally made, and the two Central Powers drew in all 643\r\n  million karbowanez.\r\n\r\n  The Rouble Syndicate, however, which had been formed under the\r\n  leadership of the principal banks in Berlin, Vienna and Budapest,\r\n  was during the first few months only able to exert a very slight\r\n  activity. Even the formation of this syndicate was a matter of\r\n  great difficulty, and in particular a great deal of time was lost;\r\n  and even then the apparatus proved very awkward to work with.\r\n  Anyhow, it had only procured comparatively small sums of roubles,\r\n  so that the purchasing organisation in Ukraine, especially at\r\n  first, suffered from a chronic lack of means of payment.\r\n\r\n  But, in any case, a better arrangement of the money question would\r\n  only have improved matters in a few of the best supplied\r\n  districts, for the principal obstacle was simply _the lack of\r\n  supplies_. The fact that Kieff and Odessa were themselves\r\n  continually in danger of a food crisis is the best indication as\r\n  to the state of things.\r\n\r\n  In the Ukraine, the effects of four years of war, with the\r\n  resulting confusion, and of the destruction wrought by the\r\n  Bolsheviks (November, 1917, to March, 1918) were conspicuously\r\n  apparent; cultivation and harvesting had suffered everywhere, but\r\n  where supplies had existed they had been partly destroyed, partly\r\n  carried off by the Bolsheviks on their way northward. Still, the\r\n  harvest had given certain stocks available in the country, though\r\n  these were not extensive, and the organisation of a purchasing\r\n  system was now commenced. The free buying in Ukraine which we and\r\n  Germany had originally contemplated could not be carried out in\r\n  fact, since the Ukrainian Government declared that it would itself\r\n  set up this organisation, and maintained this intention with the\r\n  greatest stubbornness. But the authority in the country had been\r\n  destroyed by the Revolution, and then by the Bolshevist invasion;\r\n  the peasantry turned Radical, and the estates were occupied by\r\n  revolutionaries and cut up. The power of the Government, then, in\r\n  respect of collecting supplies of grain, was altogether\r\n  inadequate; on the other hand, however, it was still sufficient\r\n  (as some actual instances proved) to place serious, indeed\r\n  insuperable, obstacles in our way. It was necessary, therefore, to\r\n  co-operate with the Government--that is, to come to a compromise\r\n  with it. After weeks of negotiation this was at last achieved, by\r\n  strong diplomatic pressure, and, accordingly, the agreement of\r\n  April 23, 1918, was signed.\r\n\r\n  This provided for the establishment of a German-Austro-Hungarian\r\n  Economical Central Commission; practically speaking, a great firm\r\n  of corn merchants, in which the Central Powers appointed a number\r\n  of their most experienced men, familiar, through years of activity\r\n  in the business, with Russian grain affairs.\r\n\r\n  But while this establishment was still in progress the people in\r\n  Vienna (influenced by the occurrences on the Emperor's journey to\r\n  North Bohemia) had lost patience; military leaders thought it no\r\n  longer advisable to continue watching the operations of a _civil_\r\n  commercial undertaking in Ukraine while that country was occupied\r\n  by the military, and so finally the General Staff elicited a\r\n  decree from the Emperor providing that the procuring of grain\r\n  should be entrusted to Austro-Hungarian army units in the\r\n  districts occupied by them. To carry out this plan a general, who\r\n  had up to that time been occupied in Roumania, was dispatched to\r\n  Odessa, and now commenced independent military proceedings from\r\n  there. For payment kronen were used, drawn from Vienna. The War\r\n  Grain Transactions department was empowered, by Imperial\r\n  instructions to the Government, to place 100 million kronen at the\r\n  disposal of the War Ministry, and this amount was actually set\r\n  aside by the finance section of that department.\r\n\r\n  This military action and its execution very seriously affected the\r\n  civil action during its establishment, and also greatly impaired\r\n  the value of our credit in the Ukraine by offering kronen notes to\r\n  such an extent at the time. Moreover, the kronen notes thus set in\r\n  circulation in Ukraine were smuggled into Sweden, and coming thus\r\n  into the Scandinavian and Dutch markets undoubtedly contributed to\r\n  the well-known fall in the value of the krone which took place\r\n  there some months later.\r\n\r\n  The Austro-Hungarian military action was received with great\r\n  disapproval by the _Germans_, and when in a time of the greatest\r\n  scarcity among ourselves (mid-May) we were obliged to ask Germany\r\n  for temporary assistance, this was granted only on condition that\r\n  independent military action on the part of Austria-Hungary should\r\n  be suppressed and the whole leadership in Ukraine be entrusted to\r\n  Germany.\r\n\r\n  It was then hoped that increased supplies might be procured,\r\n  especially from Bessarabia, where the Germans have established a\r\n  collecting organisation, to the demand of which the Roumanian\r\n  Government had agreed. This hope, however, also proved vain, and\r\n  in June and July the Ukraine was still further engaged. The\r\n  country was, in fact, almost devoid of any considerable supplies,\r\n  and in addition to this the collecting system never really worked\r\n  properly at all, as the arrangement for maximum prices was\r\n  frequently upset by overbidding on the part of our own military\r\n  section.\r\n\r\n  Meantime everything had been made ready for getting in the harvest\r\n  of 1918. The collecting organisation had become more firmly\r\n  established and extended, the necessary personal requirements were\r\n  fully complied with, and _it would doubtless have been possible to\r\n  bring great quantities out of the country_. But first of all the\r\n  demands of the Ukrainian cities had to be met, and there was in\r\n  many cases a state of real famine there; then came the Ukrainian\r\n  and finally the very considerable contingents of German and\r\n  Austro-Hungarian armies of occupation. Not until supplies for\r\n  these groups had been assured would the Ukrainian Government allow\r\n  any export of grain, and to this we were forced to agree.\r\n\r\n  It was at once evident that the degree of cultivation throughout\r\n  the whole country had seriously declined--owing to the entire\r\n  uncertainty of property and rights after the agrarian revolution.\r\n  The local authorities, affected by this state of things, were\r\n  little inclined to agree to export, and it actually came to local\r\n  embargoes, one district prohibiting the transfer of its stocks to\r\n  any other, exactly as we had experienced with ourselves.\r\n\r\n  In particular, however, the agitation of the Entente agents (which\r\n  had been frequently perceptible before), under the impression of\r\n  the German military defeats, was most seriously felt. The position\r\n  of the Government which the Germans had set up at Kieff was\r\n  unusually weak. Moreover, the ever-active Bolshevik elements\r\n  throughout the whole country were now working with increasing\r\n  success against our organisation. All this rendered the work more\r\n  difficult in September and October--and then came the collapse.\r\n\r\n  The difficulties of transport, too, were enormous; supplies had\r\n  either to be sent to the Black Sea, across it and up the Danube,\r\n  or straight through Galicia. For this we often lacked sufficient\r\n  wagons, and in the Ukraine also coal; there were, in addition,\r\n  often instances of resistance on the part of the local railways,\r\n  incited by the Bolsheviks, and much more of the same sort.\r\n\r\n  However great the lack of supplies in Ukraine itself, however much\r\n  the limitations of our Russian means of payment may have\r\n  contributed to the fact that the hopes entertained on the signing\r\n  of peace at Brest-Litovsk were far from being realised, we may\r\n  nevertheless maintain that _all that was humanly possible_ was\r\n  done to overcome the unprecedented difficulties encountered. And\r\n  in particular, by calling in the aid of the most capable and\r\n  experienced firms of grain merchants, the forces available were\r\n  utilised to the utmost degree.\r\n\r\n  Finally it should perhaps be pointed out that the import\r\n  organisation--apart from the before-mentioned interference of the\r\n  military department and consequent fluctuations of the system--was\r\n  largely upset by very extensive smuggling operations, carried on\r\n  more particularly from Galicia. As such smuggling avoided the high\r\n  export duty, the maximum prices appointed by the Ukrainian\r\n  Government were constantly being overbid. This smuggling was also\r\n  in many cases assisted by elements from Vienna; altogether the\r\n  nervousness prevailing in many leading circles in Vienna, and\r\n  frequently criticising our own organisation in public, or\r\n  upsetting arrangements before they could come into operation, did\r\n  a great deal of damage. It should also be mentioned that Germany\r\n  likewise carried on a great deal of unofficially assisted\r\n  smuggling, with ill effects on the official import organisation,\r\n  and led to similar conditions on our own side.\r\n\r\n  Despite all obstacles, the machinery established, as will be seen\r\n  from the following survey, nevertheless succeeded in getting not\r\n  inconsiderable quantities of foodstuffs into the states concerned,\r\n  amounting in all to about 42,000 wagons, though unfortunately the\r\n  quantities delivered did not come up to the original expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  SURVEY OF THE IMPORTS FROM UKRAINE DATING FROM COMMENCEMENT OF\r\n  IMPORTATION (SPRING, 1918) TO NOVEMBER, 1918.\r\n\r\n  I.

But should I have shown more capability by asserting, after\r\nthe collapse of the Central Powers, that the peace still existed?\r\n\r\nThe term \"bread peace\" (_Brotfrieden_) was not coined by me, but by\r\nBurgemeister Weisskirchner on the occasion of my reception by the\r\nGemeinderat of Vienna at the Nordbahnhof. The millions whose lives\r\nwere saved by those 42,000 wagon-loads of food may repeat the words\r\nwithout a sneer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE OF BUCHAREST\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Brest-Litovsk rumours had already spread that Roumania did not\r\nintend to continue the war. These rumours assumed a very definite\r\ncharacter after peace was concluded with the Ukraine. That peace, as\r\nwell as Trotski's attitude, left no doubt in Bucharest that Roumania\r\ncould no longer reckon on further co-operation on the part of Russia\r\nand gave rise to the idea in some circles that she would turn back. I\r\nsay in _some_ circles, for there was one group which, to the very last\r\nmoment, was all for war.\r\n\r\nWhile at Brest-Litovsk I began to get into touch with the leaders of\r\nthe Hungarian Parliament in order to come to an agreement on the peace\r\naims relating to Roumania. It was evident that, as regards Roumania, a\r\npeace without annexations would be more difficult to bring about than\r\nwith any other state, because the treacherous attack by the Roumanians\r\non the whole of Hungary had raised the desire for a better strategical\r\nfrontier. As might be expected, I met with violent opposition from\r\nHungary, where, under the name of strategical frontier rectifications,\r\nas a matter of fact greater annexations were desired. The first person\r\nwith whom I dealt was Stephen Tisza, who, at great trouble, was\r\nbrought to modify his original standpoint and finally was led so far\r\nas to admit that the fundamental ideas for peace were capable of\r\nacceptance. On February 27, 1918, he handed me a _pro-memoria_ with\r\nthe request to show it to the Emperor, in which he explained his\r\nalready more conciliatory point of view, though, nevertheless, he very\r\ndistinctly showed his disapproval of my intentions. The _pro-memoria_\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n  Unfortunately, Roumania can withdraw from the war not as much\r\n  exhausted as justice and the justified interests of the Monarchy\r\n  could wish.\r\n\r\n  The loss of the Dobrudsha will be made good by territorial gains\r\n  in Bessarabia, while the frontier rectifications demanded by us\r\n  are out of all proportion with Roumania's guilt and with her\r\n  military situation.\r\n\r\n  Our peace terms are so mild that they are as a generous gift\r\n  offered to vanquished Roumania and are _not at all to be made a\r\n  subject for negotiations_. In no case are these negotiations to\r\n  assume the character of trading or bargaining. If Roumania refuses\r\n  to conclude peace on the basis laid down by us our answer can only\r\n  be a resumption of hostilities.\r\n\r\n  I consider it highly probable that the Roumanian Government will\r\n  run that risk to prove her necessity in the eyes of the Western\r\n  Powers and her own population. But it is just as probable that\r\n  after breaking off negotiations she will just as quickly turn back\r\n  and give way before our superior forces.\r\n\r\n  At the worst a short campaign would result in the total collapse\r\n  of Roumania.\r\n\r\n  In all human probability it is almost certain that the development\r\n  of affairs will take a course similar to the last phase in the\r\n  peace with Northern Russia, and will lead to an easy and complete\r\n  success for the Central Powers. That we lay down the frontier\r\n  rectification as _conditio sine qua non_ forms a justifiable\r\n  measure to protect an important interest for the Monarchy of a\r\n  purely defensive nature. It is energetically demanded by the\r\n  entire patriotic public opinion of Hungary. It appears out of the\r\n  question that a Minister of Foreign Affairs, had he taken up\r\n  another attitude in the matter, would have been able to remain in\r\n  the Delegation.\r\n\r\n  And, besides, the procedure--to which the greatest importance must\r\n  be attached--is absolutely necessary in order not to compromise\r\n  the chances of a general peace.\r\n\r\n  It is obvious from the public statements of leading statesmen of\r\n  the Western Powers that they will not be prevailed upon to agree\r\n  to an acceptable peace, as they do not believe in our capacity and\r\n  firm resolve to carry it out. Whatever confirms their views in\r\n  this respect widens the distance between us and peace; the only\r\n  way to bring us really nearer to peace is to adopt an attitude\r\n  that will lead them to think differently.\r\n\r\n  This must constitute the line of action in our resolves and\r\n  undertakings. In connection with the Roumanian peace, it is\r\n  evident that to yield on the frontier question--even for fear of a\r\n  breakdown in the negotiations--must have a deplorable effect on\r\n  the opinion our enemies have of us. It would certainly be right\r\n  not to take advantage of Roumania's desperate situation, but to\r\n  grant her reasonable peace terms in accordance with the\r\n  principles embodied in our statements. But if we do not act with\r\n  adequate firmness on that reasonable basis we shall encourage the\r\n  Western Powers in the belief that it is not necessary to conclude\r\n  a peace with us on the basis of the integrity of our territory and\r\n  sovereignty, and fierce and bitter fighting may be looked for to\r\n  teach them otherwise.\r\n\r\n  TISZA.\r\n\r\n  _February 27, 1916._\r\n\r\nAndrassy and Wekerle were also opposed to a milder treatment of\r\nRoumania, and thus the whole Hungarian Parliament were of one accord\r\non the question. I am not sure what standpoint Karolyi held, and I do\r\nnot know if at that period the \"tiger soul\" which he at one time\r\ndisplayed to Roumania, or the pacifist soul which he laid later at the\r\nfeet of General Franchet d'Esperey, dominated.\r\n\r\nThus at Brest-Litovsk, when the Roumanian peace appeared on the\r\nhorizon, I took up the standpoint that the party desirous of peace\r\nnegotiations must be supported.\r\n\r\nThe episode of the Roumanian peace must not be taken out of the great\r\npicture of the war. Like the Peace of Brest-Litovsk, the Roumanian\r\npeace was necessary from a military point of view, because it seemed\r\ndesirable to release troops in the East as quickly as possible and\r\ntransfer them to the Western front. It was urgently desired and\r\nrepeatedly demanded that we should come to a final settlement with\r\nRoumania as soon as possible. In order to secure a speedy result I had\r\nalready, from Brest-Litovsk, advised the Emperor to send word\r\nprivately to King Ferdinand that he could reckon on an honourable\r\npeace should he wish to enter into negotiations. The Emperor took my\r\nadvice, and Colonel Randa had one or two interviews with a member of\r\nthe immediate entourage of the King. But the German opinion was that\r\nKing Ferdinand must be \"punished for his treachery\" and no\r\nnegotiations entered into with him. For this reason, and to avoid\r\nfruitless controversy, I first imparted to Herr von Kühlmann the\r\naccomplished fact and informed him that we had put ourselves secretly\r\ninto communication with King Ferdinand. This event was quite in\r\naccordance with the standard of equality in our Federation, by which\r\nevery member was privileged to act according to the best of his\r\nability and was merely bound to inform the friendly Powers of the\r\nproceedings. It was not our duty to apply to Germany for permission to\r\ntake such a step.\r\n\r\nThere was a three-fold reason why I did not share Germany's opinion on\r\nthis question. In the first place, my point of view was that it was\r\nnot our duty to mete out divine justice and to inflict punishment,\r\nbut, on the contrary, to end the war as quickly as possible. Therefore\r\nmy duty was to seize every means possible to prevent a continuance of\r\nthe war. I must mention here that the idea prevailing in many circles\r\nthat the Roumanians were quite at the end of their strength, and were\r\ncompelled to accept all the conditions, is entirely false. The\r\nRoumanians held very strong positions, the _moral_ in the army was\r\nexcellent, and in the last great attack on Maracesci, Mackensen's\r\ntroops had suffered very severely. This success turned the Roumanians'\r\nheads, and there were many leading men in the ranks of the Roumanian\r\narmy who sided entirely with those who wished to carry on the war _à\r\nl'outrance_. They did not count so much on an actual victory, but were\r\nupheld by the hope that for some time to come they could maintain the\r\ndefensive and that, meanwhile, the decisive successes of their Allies\r\non the West would secure victory for them. They were probably afraid,\r\ntoo, that a peace concluded with us would place them in permanent\r\ndisgrace with the Entente--that they would lose the friendship of the\r\nEntente, fail to gain ours, and find themselves between two stools.\r\nThe second reason which decided me to insist on negotiating with the\r\nKing was that, from a dynastic point of view, I considered it most\r\nunwise to dethrone a foreign king. There was already then a certain\r\nfall in the value of kings on the European market, and I was afraid it\r\nmight develop into a panic if we put more kings off their thrones. The\r\nthird reason was that, in order to conclude peace, we must have a\r\ncompetent representative in Roumania. If we were to depose the King we\r\nshould divide Roumania into two camps and would, at the best, only be\r\nable to conclude a transitory peace with that party which accepted the\r\ndethronement of the King. A rapid and properly-secured peace could\r\nonly be concluded with the legitimate head in Roumania.\r\n\r\nIn the introductory interviews which Colonel Randa had on February 4\r\nand 5 with the confidential envoy from the King of Roumania, the envoy\r\nasked whether all the Quadruple Alliance Powers were acting in the\r\nstep in question, and whether the occupied territory in Roumania would\r\nbe released. I was notified of this inquiry of the King, and replied\r\nthat I was persuaded that no refusal need be expected from the other\r\nCentral Powers should he, with the object of securing an honourable\r\npeace, address them accordingly. As to the question of territorial\r\npossessions, I stated that, for the present, I was not able to express\r\nany opinion on the matter, as it would have to be a subject for the\r\nintroductory negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe view held by the German military leaders in agreement with\r\nHungarian politicians that Roumania should be treated differently\r\nfrom, and in a much sterner manner than, any other state was, if the\r\nquestion is considered from the point of view of retribution, quite\r\njustified. Roumania's actions with regard to us were far more\r\ntreacherous than those of Italy. Italy, owing to her geographical\r\nposition and to the fact of her being totally dependent on the Western\r\nPowers--a blockade by whom might finally have forced her to submit to\r\ntheir demands--would have found it very difficult to remain neutral in\r\nthis world war. Roumania was not only perfectly independent, but was\r\namply provided for through her rich granaries. Apart from the fact\r\nthat Roumania alone was to blame for allowing things to go so far that\r\nRussia was enabled finally to send her an ultimatum and so force her\r\ninto war, it must be admitted that Roumania was far less likely to be\r\ninfluenced by the Entente than Italy. But neither would the Russian\r\nultimatum have taken effect if Roumania had not consciously and\r\nwillingly placed herself in a position in regard to military and\r\npolitical matters that gave her into Russia's power. Bratianu said to\r\nme in one of our last interviews: \"Russia is exactly like a blackcock\r\ndancing before the hens.\" In admitting the truth of this appropriate\r\ncomparison, it must be added that the female of the simile, longing to\r\nbe embraced, directly provoked violence.\r\n\r\nFor two years Bratianu had stirred up public opinion against us in his\r\nown country. Had he not done so, and had he not finally bared his\r\nRussian frontier of all troops, the Russian ultimatum would have had\r\nno effect.\r\n\r\nIn Roumania the Avarescu Ministry was in power. On February 24\r\nKühlmann and I had our first interview alone with Avarescu at the\r\ncastle of Prince Stirbey, at Buftia. At this interview, which was very\r\nshort, the sole topic was the Dobrudsha question. The frontier\r\nrectifications, as they stood on the Austro-Hungarian programme, were\r\nbarely alluded to, and the economic questions, which later played a\r\nrather important part, were only hinted at. Avarescu's standpoint was\r\nthat the cession of the Dobrudsha was an impossibility, and the\r\ninterview ended with a _non possumus_ from the Roumanian general,\r\nwhich was equivalent to breaking off negotiations. As regards the\r\nDobrudsha question, our position was one of constraint. The so-called\r\n\"old\" Dobrudsha, the portion that Roumania in 1913 had wrested from\r\nBulgaria, had been promised to the Bulgarians by a treaty in the time\r\nof the Emperor Francis Joseph as a reward for their co-operation, and\r\nthe area that lies between that frontier and the Constanza-Carnavoda\r\nrailway line was vehemently demanded by the Bulgarians. They went much\r\nfurther in their aspirations: they demanded the whole of the\r\nDobrudsha, including the mouth of the Danube, and the great and\r\nnumerous disputes that occurred later in this connection show how\r\ninsistently and obstinately the Bulgarians held to their demands. At\r\nthe same time, as there was a danger that the Bulgars, thoroughly\r\ndisappointed in their aspirations, might secede from us, it became\r\nabsolutely impossible to hand over the Dobrudsha to the Roumanians.\r\nAll that could be effected was to secure for the Roumanians free\r\naccess to Constanza, and, further, to find a way out of the\r\ndifficulty existing between Turkey and Bulgaria in connection with the\r\nDobrudsha.\r\n\r\nIn order not to break off entirely all discussion, I suggested to\r\nAvarescu that he should arrange for his King to meet me. My plan was\r\nto make it clear to the King that it would be possible for him now to\r\nconclude a peace, though involving certain losses, but still a peace\r\nthat would enable him to keep his crown. On the other hand, by\r\ncontinuing the war, he could not count on forbearance on the part of\r\nthe Central Powers. I trusted that this move on my part would enable\r\nhim to continue the peace negotiations.\r\n\r\nI met the King on February 27 at a little station in the occupied\r\ndistrict of Moldavia.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Focsani at noon and continued by motor to the lines,\r\nwhere Colonel Ressel and a few Roumanian officers were waiting to\r\nreceive me. We drove past positions on both sides in a powerful German\r\ncar that had been placed at my disposal, and proceeded as far as the\r\nrailway station of Padureni. A saloon carriage in the train had been\r\nreserved for me there, and we set off for Rasaciuni, arriving there at\r\n5 o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe Roumanian royal train arrived a few minutes later, and I at once\r\nwent across to the King.\r\n\r\nIncidentally my interview with King Ferdinand lasted twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nAs the King did not begin the conversation I had to do so, and said\r\nthat I had not come to sue for peace but purely as the bearer of a\r\nmessage from the Emperor Charles, who, in spite of Roumania's\r\ntreachery, would show indulgence and consideration if King Ferdinand\r\nwould _at once_ conclude peace under the conditions mutually agreed on\r\nby the Quadruple Alliance Powers.\r\n\r\nShould the King not consent, then a continuance of the war would be\r\nunavoidable and would put an end to Roumania and the dynasty. Our\r\nmilitary superiority was already very considerable, and now that our\r\nfront would be set free from the Baltic to the Black Sea, it would be\r\nan easy matter for us, in a very short space of time, to increase our\r\nstrength still more. We were aware that Roumania would very soon have\r\nno more munitions and, were hostilities to continue, in six weeks the\r\nkingdom and dynasty would have ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe King did not oppose anything but thought the conditions terribly\r\nhard. Without the Dobrudsha Roumania would hardly be able to draw\r\nbreath. At any rate, there could be further parley as to ceding \"old\"\r\nDobrudsha again.\r\n\r\nI said to the King that if he complained about hard conditions I could\r\nonly ask what would his conditions have been if his troops had reached\r\nBudapest? Meanwhile, I was ready to guarantee that Roumania would not\r\nbe cut off from the sea, but would have free access to Constanza.\r\n\r\nHere the King again complained of the hard conditions enforced on him,\r\nand declared he would never be able to find a Ministry who would\r\naccept them.\r\n\r\nI rejoined that the forming of a Cabinet was Roumania's internal\r\nbusiness, but my private opinion was that a Marghiloman Cabinet, in\r\norder to save Roumania, would agree to the conditions laid down. I\r\ncould only repeat that no change could be made in the peace terms laid\r\nbefore the King by the Quadruple Alliance. If the King did not accept\r\nthem, we should have, in a month's time, a far better peace than the\r\none which the Roumanians might consider themselves lucky to get\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nWe were ready to give our diplomatic support to Roumania that she\r\nmight obtain Bessarabia, and she would, therefore, gain far more than\r\nshe would lose.\r\n\r\nThe King replied that Bessarabia was nothing to him, that it was\r\nsteeped in Bolshevism, and the Dobrudsha could not be given up;\r\nanyhow, it was only under the very greatest pressure that he had\r\ndecided to enter into the war against the Central Powers. He began\r\nagain, however, to speak of the promised access to the sea, which\r\napparently made the cession of the Dobrudsha somewhat easier.\r\n\r\nWe then entered into details, and I reproached the King for the\r\ndreadful treatment of our people interned in Roumania, which he said\r\nhe regretted.\r\n\r\nFinally, I requested that he would give me a clear and decided answer\r\nwithin forty-eight hours as to whether he would negotiate on the basis\r\nof our proposals or not.\r\n\r\nThe result of the interview was the appointment of the Marghiloman\r\nMinistry and the continuation of the negotiations.\r\n\r\nBefore Marghiloman consented to form a Cabinet, he approached me to\r\nlearn the exact terms.\r\n\r\nHe declared himself to be in agreement with the first and hardest of\r\nthe conditions--the cession of the Dobrudsha, because he was quicker\r\nthan the King in seeing that in consequence of our binding obligation\r\nto Bulgaria in this connection, it could not be otherwise. As to our\r\nterritorial demands, I told Marghiloman that I laid chief stress on\r\nentering into friendly and lasting relations with Roumania after peace\r\nwas concluded, and, therefore, desired to reduce the demands in such\r\nmeasure as Roumania, on her part, would consider bearable. On the\r\nother hand, he, Marghiloman, must understand that I was bound to\r\nconsider the Hungarian aspirations to a certain degree, Marghiloman,\r\nwho was an old and tried parliamentarian, fully saw in what a\r\nconstrained position I was placed. We finally agreed that the cession\r\nof the populated districts and towns like Turn-Saverin and Okna should\r\nnot take place, and, altogether the original claims were reduced to\r\nabout half. Marghiloman said he accepted the compromise.\r\n\r\nMy desire to enter into a lasting economic union with Roumania played\r\nan important part in the negotiations. It was clear to me that this\r\ndemand was in Austrian, but not in Hungarian interests; but I still\r\nthink that, even so, it was my duty, although joint Minister for both\r\ncountries, to work for Austria, as the shortage of provisions made the\r\nopening of the Roumanian granaries very desirable. As was to be\r\nexpected, this clause in the negotiations met with the most violent\r\nopposition in Hungary, and it was at first impossible to see a way out\r\nof the difficulty. I never took back my demand, however, and was\r\nfirmly resolved that peace should not be signed if my plan was not\r\nrealised. I was dismissed from office in the middle of the\r\nnegotiations, and my successor did not attach the same importance to\r\nthat particular item as I did.\r\n\r\nOn the German side there was at once evidence of that insatiable\r\nappetite which we had already noticed at Brest-Litovsk. The Germans\r\nwished to have a species of war indemnity by compelling Roumania to\r\ncede her petroleum springs, her railways and harbours to German\r\ncompanies, and placing the permanent control of her finances in German\r\nhands. I opposed these demands in the most decided manner from the\r\nvery first, as I was convinced that such terms would preclude all\r\npossibility of any friendly relations in future. I went so far as to\r\nask the Emperor Charles to telegraph direct to the Emperor William in\r\nthat connection, which met with a certain amount of success. In the\r\nend the German claims were reduced by about fifty per cent., and\r\naccepted by Marghiloman in the milder form. With regard to the\r\npetroleum question, a ninety years' lease was agreed on. In the matter\r\nof the corn supply, Roumania was to bind herself to deliver her\r\nagricultural produce to the Central Powers for a certain number of\r\nyears. The plan for Germany to be in the permanent control of\r\nRoumanian finances was not carried out. In the question of price, the\r\nRoumanian views held good. The most impossible of the German demands,\r\nnamely, the occupation of Roumania for five to six years after the\r\nconclusion of peace, gave rise to great difficulties. This was the\r\npoint that was most persistently and energetically insisted on by the\r\nGerman Supreme Military Command, and it was only with great trouble\r\nand after lengthy explanations and discussions that we settled the\r\nmatter on the following lines: That on the conclusion of peace the\r\nentire legislative and executive power of the Roumanian Government\r\nwould be restored in principle, and that we should content ourselves\r\nwith exercising a certain control through a limited number of agents,\r\nthis control not to be continued after the general peace was made. I\r\ncannot say positively whether this standpoint was adhered to by my\r\nsuccessor or not, but certain it is that Marghiloman only undertook\r\noffice on condition that I gave him a guarantee that the plan would be\r\nsupported by me.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, the question of the Dobrudsha had prepared great\r\ndifficulties for us in two respects. First of all there was the\r\nrelinquishing of their claim which, for the Roumanians, was the\r\nhardest term of all, and imparted to the peace the character of a\r\npeace of violence; and secondly, the matter had precipitated a dispute\r\nbetween Turkey and Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians' view was that the entire Dobrudsha, including the\r\nmouth of the Danube, must be promised to them, and they insisted on\r\ntheir point with an obstinacy which I have seldom, if ever, come\r\nacross. They went so far as to declare that neither the present\r\nGovernment nor any other would be able to return to Sofia, and allowed\r\nit clearly to be seen that by refusing their claims we could never\r\nagain count on Bulgaria. The Turks, on the other hand, protested with\r\nequal vehemence that the Dobrudsha had been conquered by two Turkish\r\narmy corps, that it was a moral injustice that the gains chiefly won\r\nby Turkish forces should be given exclusively to the Bulgarians, and\r\nthat they would never consent to Bulgaria receiving the whole of the\r\nDobrudsha unless compensation was given to them. By way of\r\ncompensation, they asked not only for that stretch of land which they\r\nhad ceded to Bulgaria on their entry into the war (Adrianople), but\r\nalso a considerable area beyond.\r\n\r\nIn the numerous conferences at which the question was discussed,\r\nKühlmann and I played the part of honest mediators who were making\r\nevery effort to reconcile the two so divergent standpoints. We both\r\nsaw clearly that the falling off of the Bulgars or Turks might be the\r\nresult if a compromise was not effected. Finally, after much trouble,\r\nwe succeeded in drawing up a programme acceptable to both sides. It\r\ntook this form: That \"old\" Dobrudsha should at once be given back to\r\nBulgaria, and the other parts of the area to be handed over as a\r\npossession to the combined Central Powers, and a definite decision\r\nagreed upon later.\r\n\r\nNeither Turkey nor Bulgaria was quite satisfied with the decision, nor\r\nyet averse to it; but, in the circumstances, it was the only possible\r\nway of building a bridge between the Turks and the Bulgars.\r\n\r\nJust as England and France secured the entry into the war of Italy\r\nthrough the Treaty of London, so did the Emperor Francis Joseph and\r\nBurian, as well as the Government in Berlin, give binding promises to\r\nthe Bulgars to secure their co-operation, and these promises proved\r\nlater to be the greatest obstacles to a peace of understanding.\r\nNevertheless, no sensible person can deny that it is natural that a\r\nstate engaged in a life-and-death struggle should seek an ally without\r\nfirst asking whether the keeping of a promise later will give rise to\r\nimportant or minor difficulties. The fireman extinguishing flames in a\r\nburning house does not first ask whether the water he pumps on it has\r\ndamaged anything. When Roumania attacked us in the rear the danger was\r\nvery great, the house was in flames, and the first act of my\r\npredecessor was naturally, and properly, to avert the great danger.\r\nThere was no lack of promises, and the Dobrudsha was assigned to the\r\nBulgarians. Whether and in what degree the Turks had a right, through\r\npromises, to the territory they, on their part, had ceded to the\r\nBulgars I do not know. But they certainly had a moral right to it.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the Roumanian peace in the spring of 1918, too\r\nsevere a test of the loyalty of Bulgars and Turks to the alliance was\r\ndangerous. For some time past the former had been dealing in secret\r\nwith the Entente. The alliance with Turkey rested mainly on Talaat and\r\nEnver. Talaat told me in Bucharest, however, quite positively that he\r\nwould be forced to send in his resignation if he were to return\r\nempty-handed, and in that case the secession of Turkey would be very\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nWe tried then at Bucharest to steer our way through the many shoals;\r\nnot mortally to offend the Roumanians, to observe as for as possible\r\nthe character of a peace of understanding, and yet to keep both Turks\r\nand Bulgars on our side.\r\n\r\nThe cession of the Dobrudsha was a terribly hard demand to make on the\r\nRoumanians, and was only rendered bearable for them when Kühlmann and\r\nI, with the greatest difficulty and against the most violent\r\nopposition from the Bulgarians, obtained for them free access to the\r\nBlack Sea.\r\n\r\nWhen later, in one breath, we were reproached with having enforced a\r\npeace of violence on the Roumanians and with not having treated the\r\nBulgarian claims and wishes with sufficient consideration--the answer\r\nto the charge is obvious. _Because_ we were compelled to consider both\r\nBulgaria and Turkey we were forced to demand the Dobrudsha from the\r\nRoumanians and treat them with greater severity than we should have\r\ndone otherwise, in order finally to gain the Turks and the Bulgars for\r\nour negotiation plans. Judged according to the Versailles standard,\r\nthe Peace of Bucharest would be a peace of understanding, both as\r\nregards form and contents.\r\n\r\nThe Central Powers' mediators, both at Versailles and St. Germain,\r\nwould have been glad had they been treated in the same way as the\r\nMarghiloman Ministry was treated.\r\n\r\nThe Roumanians lost the Dobrudsha, but acquired safe and guaranteed\r\naccess to the sea; they lost a district of sparsely populated\r\nmountainous country to us, and through us they acquired Bessarabia.\r\n\r\nThey gained far more than they lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFINAL REFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farther the world war progressed, the more did it lose the\r\ncharacter of the work of individual men. It assumed rather the\r\ncharacter of a cosmic event, taking more and more from the\r\neffectiveness of the most powerful individuals.\r\n\r\nAll settlements on which coalitions were based were connected with\r\ncertain war aims by the Cabinets, such as the promises of compensation\r\ngiven to their own people, the hopes of gain from the final victory.\r\nThe encouragement of intense and boundless hatred, the increasing\r\ncrude brutality of the world all tended to create a situation making\r\neach individual like a small stone which, breaking away from an\r\navalanche of stones, hurls itself downwards without a leader and\r\nwithout goal, and is no longer capable of being guided by anyone.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Four at Versailles tried for some time to make the\r\nworld believe that they possessed the power to rebuild Europe\r\naccording to their own ideas. According to their own ideas! That\r\nsignified, to begin with, four utterly different ideas, for four\r\ndifferent worlds were comprised in Rome, Paris, London, and\r\nWashington. And the four representatives--\"the Big Four,\" as they were\r\ncalled--were each individually the slave of his programme, his\r\npledges, and his people. Those responsible for the Paris negotiations\r\n_in camera_, which lasted for many months, and were a breeding ground\r\nfor European anarchy, had their own good reasons for secrecy; there\r\nwas no end to the disputes, for which no outlet could be found.\r\n\r\nHere, Wilson had been scoffed at and cursed because he deserted his\r\nprogramme; certainly, there is not the slightest similarity between\r\nthe Fourteen Points and the Peace of Versailles and St. Germain, but\r\nit is forgotten now that Wilson no longer had the power to enforce his\r\nwill against the three others. We do not know what occurred behind\r\nthose closed doors, but we can imagine it, and Wilson probably fought\r\nweeks and months for his programme. He could have broken off\r\nproceedings and left! He certainly could have done so, but would the\r\nchaos have been any less; would it have been any better for the world\r\nif the only one who was not solely imbued with the lust of conquest\r\nhad thrown down his arms? But Clemenceau, too, the direct opposite of\r\nWilson, was not quite open in his dealings. Undoubtedly this old man,\r\nwho now at the close of his life was able to satisfy his hatred of the\r\nGermans of 1870, gloried in the triumph; but, apart from that, if he\r\nhad tried to conclude a \"Wilson peace,\" all the private citizens of\r\nFrance, great and small, would have risen against him, for they had\r\nbeen told for the last five years: _Que les boches payeront tout_.\r\nWhat he did, he enjoyed doing; but he was forced to do it or France\r\nwould have dismissed him.\r\n\r\nAnd Italy? From Milan to Naples is heard the subterraneous rumbling of\r\napproaching revolution; the only means the Government have adopted to\r\ncheck the upheaval is to drown the revolution in a sea of national\r\ninterests. I believe that in 1917, when the general discontent was\r\nmuch less and finances were much better, the Italian Government might\r\nmuch more probably have accepted Wilson's standpoint than after final\r\nvictory. Then they could not do it. At Versailles they were the slaves\r\nof their promises. And does anyone believe that Lloyd George would\r\nhave had the power at Versailles to extend the Wilson principle of the\r\nright of self-determination to Ireland and the Dominions? Naturally,\r\nhe did not wish to do otherwise than he did; but that is not the\r\nquestion here, but rather that neither could have acted very\r\ndifferently even had he wished to do so.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the historical moment is the year 1917 when Wilson\r\nlost his power, which was swallowed up in Imperialism, and when the\r\nPresident of the United States neglected to force his programme on his\r\nAllies. Then power was still in his hands, as the American troops were\r\nso eagerly looked for; but later, when victory came, he no longer held\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd thus there came about what is now a fact. A dictated peace of the\r\nmost terrible nature was concluded and a foundation laid for a\r\ncontinuance of unimaginable disturbances, complications and wars.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the apparent power of victorious armies, in spite of\r\nall the claims of the Council of Four, a world has expired at\r\nVersailles--the world of militarism. Solely bent on exterminating\r\nPrussian militarism, the Entente have gained so complete a victory\r\nthat all fences and barriers have been pulled down and they can give\r\nthemselves up unchecked to a torrent of violence, vengeance and\r\npassion. And the Entente are so swallowed up by their revengeful\r\nparoxysm of destruction that they do not appear to see that, while\r\nthey imagine they still rule and command, they are even now but\r\ninstruments in a world revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Entente, who would not allow the war to end and kept up the\r\nblockade for months after the cessation of hostilities, has made\r\nBolshevism a danger to the world. War is its father, famine its\r\nmother, despair its godfather. The poison of Bolshevism will course in\r\nthe veins of Europe for many a long year.\r\n\r\nVersailles is not the end of the war, it is only a phase of it. The\r\nwar goes on, though in another form. I think that the coming\r\ngeneration will not call the great drama of the last five years the\r\nworld-war, but the world-revolution, which it will realise began with\r\nthe world-war.\r\n\r\nNeither at Versailles nor St. Germain has any lasting work been done.\r\nThe germs of decomposition and death lie in this peace. The paroxysms\r\nthat shattered Europe are not yet over; as, after a terrible\r\nearthquake, the subterraneous rumblings may still be heard. Again and\r\nagain we shall see the earth open, now here, now there, and shoot up\r\nflames into the heavens; again and again there will be expressions of\r\nelementary nature and elementary force that will spread devastation\r\nthrough the land--until everything has been swept away that reminds us\r\nof the madness of the war and the French peace.\r\n\r\nSlowly but with unspeakable suffering a new world will be born. Coming\r\ngenerations will look back to our times as to a long and very bad\r\ndream, but day follows the darkest night. Generations have been laid\r\nin their graves, murdered, famished, and a prey to disease. Millions,\r\nwith hatred and murder in their hearts, have died in their efforts to\r\ndevastate and destroy.\r\n\r\nBut other generations will arise and with them a new spirit: They will\r\nrebuild what war and revolution have pulled down. Spring comes always\r\nafter winter. Resurrection follows after death; it is the eternal law\r\nin life.\r\n\r\nWell for those who will be called upon to serve as soldiers in the\r\nranks of whoever comes to build the new world.\r\n\r\n_June, 1919._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n=Resolutions of the London Conference, of April 26, 1915=[11]\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 1917, the _Isvestia_ published the following text of\r\nthis agreement:\r\n\r\n\"The Italian Ambassador in London, Marchese Imperiali, acting on the\r\ninstructions of his Government, has the honour to convey to the\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Sir Edward Grey, the French Ambassador\r\nin London, M. Cambon, and the Russian Ambassador in London, Count\r\nBenckendorff, the following notable points:\r\n\r\n§1. A _Military Convention_ shall be concluded without delay between\r\nthe General Staffs of France, Great Britain, Russia and Italy. This\r\nconvention to determine the minimum of forces to be directed by Russia\r\nagainst Austria-Hungary in case that country should turn all its\r\nforces against Italy, provided Russia decides to concentrate chiefly\r\nagainst Germany. The Military Convention referred to shall also settle\r\nquestions bearing upon an armistice, in so far as these by their\r\nnature come within the scope of the Army Command.\r\n\r\n§2. Italy on her part undertakes to carry on war with all the means at\r\nher disposal, together with France, Great Britain and Russia, against\r\nall countries at war with them.\r\n\r\n§3. The naval forces of France and Great Britain are to render Italy\r\nundiminished, active assistance until the _destruction of the Austrian\r\nfleet_, or until the moment peace is concluded. A _Naval Convention_\r\nshall be concluded without delay between France, Great Britain and\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n§4. At the coming conclusion of peace Italy is to receive: the\r\ndistrict of the _Trentino; the whole of South Tyrol as far as its\r\nnatural geographical boundary, thereby understood the Brenner; the\r\ncity and district of Trieste; the provinces of Goerz and Gradisca,\r\nthe whole of Istria_ as far as Quarnero, including Volosca and the\r\nIstrian islands of Cherso and Lussin, also the smaller islands of\r\nPlavnica, Unie, Canidolo, Palazzoli, as well as the island of St.\r\nPeter de Nembi, Astinello and Cruica, with the neighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nNote: 1. By way of supplement to §4, the frontier shall be drawn\r\nthrough the following-points: From the peak of the Umbrail in a\r\nnortherly direction as far as the Stilfserjoch, and thence along the\r\nwatershed of the Ratische Alps as far as the sources of the rivers\r\nEtsch and Eisack, then over the Reschen-Scheideck, the Brenner and the\r\nOetztaler and Zillertaler Alps; the frontier line then to turn\r\nsouthwards, cutting the Toblach range, and proceeding as far as the\r\npresent frontier of Grein, drawn towards the Alps; following this it\r\nwill run to the heights of Tarvis, then, however, pursuing a course\r\nalong the watershed of the Julian Alps, over the heights of Predil,\r\nMangart and Triglav group, and the passes of Podbrda, Podlaneskan and\r\nIdria. From there the frontier continues in a south-easterly direction\r\nto the Schneeberg, so that the basin of the River Save, with its\r\nsources, shall not fall within the Italian territory. From the\r\nSchneeberg the frontier proceeds towards the coast, enclosing Castua,\r\nMatuglie and Volosca in the Italian possessions.\r\n\r\n§5. Similarly, Italy is to receive the province of Dalmatia in its\r\npresent form, including Lissarik and Trebinje in the north, and all\r\npossessions as far as a line drawn from the coast at Cape Blanca\r\neastward to the watershed in the south, so as to include in the\r\nItalian possessions all valleys on the course of the rivers debouching\r\nat Sebenico, such as Cikola, Kerke and Budisnica, with all those\r\nsituate on their sources. Similarly also, Italy is promised _all the\r\nislands lying north and west of the Dalmatian coast_, beginning with\r\nthe islands of Premuda, Selve, Ulbo, Skerda Maon, Pago and Puntadura,\r\netc., in the north; as far as Malarda in the south, adding also the\r\nislands of St. Andrae, Busi, Lissa, Lessina, Torzola, Curzola, Cazza\r\nand Lagosta, with all rocks and islets thereto pertaining, as well as\r\nPelagosa, but not to include the islands of Great and Lesser Zirona,\r\nPua, Solta and Brazza.\r\n\r\nThe following are to be _neutralised_: (1) The entire coast from Cape\r\nBlanca in the north as far as the southern end of the peninsula of\r\nSabbioncello, and in the south including the whole of the mentioned\r\npeninsula in the neutralised area; (2) a part of the coast beginning\r\nfrom a point situate 10 versts south of the cape of Alt-Ragusa, as far\r\nas the river Wojusa in the south, so as to include within the\r\nboundaries of the neutralised zone _the whole of the Bay of Cattaro_\r\nwith its ports, Antivari, Dulcigno, San Giovanni di Medua and Durazzo;\r\nthis not to affect the declarations of the contracting parties in\r\nApril and May, 1909, as to the rights of _Montenegro_.\r\n\r\nIn consideration, however, of the fact that these rights were only\r\nadmitted as applying to the present possessions of Montenegro, they\r\nshall not be so extended as to embrace any lands or ports which may in\r\nthe future be ceded to Montenegro. In the same way, no part of the\r\ncoast at present belonging to Montenegro shall be subject to future\r\nneutralisation. The restrictions in the case of the port of Antivari,\r\nagreed by Montenegro itself in 1909, remain in force. (3) Finally, the\r\nislands not accorded to Italy.\r\n\r\nNote: 3. The following lands in the Adriatic Sea are accorded by the\r\nPowers of the Quadruple Alliance to the territories of _Croatia,\r\nSerbia and Montenegro_: In the north of the Adriatic, _the entire\r\ncoast, commencing from the Bay of Volosca_ on the frontier of Istria\r\nas far as the _northern frontier_ of Dalmatia, including the whole of\r\nthe coast-line now belonging to Hungary, the entire coast of Croatia,\r\nthe port of Fiume and the small harbours of Novi and Carlopago, as\r\nalso the islands of Velia, Pervicchio, Gregorio, Goli and Arbe. In the\r\nsouth of the Adriatic, where Serbia and Austrian interests lie, the\r\nentire coast from Cape Planca as far as the river Drina, with the\r\nprincipal ports of _Spaluto, Ragusa, Cattaro, Antivari, Dulcigno and\r\nSan Giovanni di Medua_, and with the islands of Greater Zirona, Pua,\r\nSolta, Brazza, Jaklian and Calamotta.\r\n\r\nThe port of Durazzo can be accorded to an independent Mohammedan State\r\nof Albania.\r\n\r\n§6. Italy to be given full possession of _Valona, the Island of\r\nSasseno_, and a sufficiently extensive territory to protect it in\r\nmilitary respects, approximately from the River Vojusa in the north\r\nand east to the boundary of the Chimara district in the south.\r\n\r\n§7. Italy, receiving the Trentino according to §4, Dalmatia and the\r\nislands of the Adriatic according to §5, as well as Valona, is not to\r\noppose the possible wishes of France, Great Britain and Russia in case\r\nof the establishment of a small autonomous neutralised state in\r\nAlbania, as to _division of the northern and southern frontier belts\r\nof Albania between Montenegro, Serbia and Greece_. The southern strip\r\nof coast from the frontier of the Italian district of Valona as far as\r\nCape Stiloa to be subject to neutralisation.\r\n\r\nItaly has the prospect of _right to determine the foreign policy of\r\nAlbania_; in any case, Italy undertakes to assent to the cession of a\r\nsufficient territory to Albania to make the frontiers of the latter on\r\nthe west of the Ochrida Lake coincide with the frontiers of Greece and\r\nSerbia.\r\n\r\n§8. Italy to have full possession of all the _islands of the\r\nDodecanessus_ which it occupies at present.\r\n\r\n§9. France, Great Britain and Russia accept in principle the fact of\r\n_Italy's interest in maintaining political equilibrium_ in the\r\nMediterranean, as also Italy's right, in case of any _division of\r\nTurkey, to a like portion with themselves_ in the basin of the\r\nMediterranean, and that in the part adjacent to the _province of\r\nAdalia_, where Italy has already acquired particular rights, and\r\ndeveloped particular interests, to be noted in the Italo-British\r\nConvention. The zone then falling to the possession of Italy will in\r\ndue time be determined according to the vital interests of France and\r\nGreat Britain. Similarly, the interests of Italy are also to be\r\nconsidered in case the territorial integrity of Asiatic Turkey should\r\nbe maintained by the Powers for a further period, and only a\r\nlimitation between the spheres of interest be made. Should, in such\r\ncase, any areas of Asiatic Turkey be occupied by France, Great Britain\r\nand Russia during the present war, then the entire area contiguous to\r\nItaly, and further defined below, shall be granted to Italy, together\r\nwith the right to occupy the same.\r\n\r\n§10. In Lybia, Italy is to be granted all rights and claims hitherto\r\nconceded to the Sultan on the basis of the Treaty of Lausanne.\r\n\r\n§11. Italy to receive such part of the war contribution as shall be\r\ncommensurate with her sacrifices and efforts.\r\n\r\n§12. Italy subscribes to the declaration issued by France, England and\r\nRussia whereby _Arabia and the holy cities of the Mohammedans_ are to\r\nbe granted to _an independent Mohammedan Power_.\r\n\r\n§13. In case of any extension of the French and English colonial\r\npossessions in Africa at the expense of Germany, France and Great\r\nBritain acknowledge in principle the right of Italy to demand certain\r\ncompensation in respect of extension of Italian possessions in\r\nEritrea, Somaliland, in Lybia, and the colonial areas contiguous to\r\nthe colonies of France and England.\r\n\r\n§14. England undertakes to facilitate the immediate realisation of _a\r\nloan of not less than 50 million pounds sterling_ in the English\r\nmarket on favourable conditions.\r\n\r\n§15. France, England and Russia undertake to support Italy in\r\n_preventing the representatives of the Holy See from taking any\r\ndiplomatic steps whatever in connection with the conclusion of a\r\npeace_, or the regulation of questions connected with the present war.\r\n\r\n§16. The present treaty to be _kept secret_. As regards Italy's\r\nagreement to the declaration of September 5, 1914, this declaration\r\nwill be made public as soon as war is declared by Italy or against\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing points having been duly noted, the respective authorised\r\nrepresentatives of France, Great Britain and Russia, together with the\r\nrepresentative of Italy similarly authorised by his Government for\r\nthis purpose, are agreed: France, Great Britain and Russia declare\r\ntheir full agreement with the foregoing notable points, as set before\r\nthem by the Italian Government. With regard to §§1, 2 and 3, referring\r\nto the agreement upon military and naval undertakings of all four\r\nPowers, _Italy undertakes to commence active operations at the\r\nearliest possible date_, and in any case not later than one month\r\nafter the signing of the present document by the contracting parties.\r\n\r\nThe present agreement, in four copies, signed in London on the 26th\r\nApril, 1915, and sealed, by\r\n\r\n  Sir Edward Grey,\r\n  Cambon,\r\n  Marchese Imperiali,\r\n  Graf Benckendorff.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the entry of Roumania into the war (September, 1916) this\r\nprogramme was further extended.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n=Note from Count Czernin to the American Government, dated March 5,\r\n1917=\r\n\r\nFrom the _aide-mémoire_ of the American Ambassador in Vienna, dated\r\nFebruary 18 of this year, the Imperial and Royal Ministry for Foreign\r\nAffairs understands that the Washington Cabinet entertains some doubt,\r\nin view of the statements issued by the Imperial and Royal Government\r\non February 10 and January 11 of this year, as to what attitude\r\nAustria-Hungary contemplates adopting for the future with regard to\r\nsubmarine warfare, and whether the assurance given by the Austrian\r\nGovernment to the Washington Cabinet in the course of the proceedings\r\nwith regard to the case of the vessels _Ancona_ and _Persia_ might not\r\nbe taken as altered or withdrawn by the statements mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Government is most willing to meet the desire of the\r\nUnited States Government that this doubt should be removed by a clear\r\nand final declaration.\r\n\r\nIt should here be permitted first of all to touch very briefly on the\r\nmethods adopted by the Allied Powers in marine warfare, since these\r\nform the starting-point of the aggravated submarine warfare put into\r\npractice by Austria-Hungary and her allies, besides throwing a clear\r\nlight upon the attitude hitherto adopted by the Austrian Government in\r\nthe questions arising therefrom.\r\n\r\nWhen Great Britain entered upon the war with the Central Powers, but a\r\nfew years had elapsed since the memorable time when Great Britain\r\nitself, together with the remaining states, had commenced at the Hague\r\nto lay the foundations of a modern code of law for marine warfare.\r\nShortly after that the English Government had brought about a meeting\r\nof representatives of the principal naval Powers, assembling in\r\nLondon, in order further to carry forward the work commenced at the\r\nHague, presumably in a spirit of reasonable compromise between the\r\ninterests of belligerents and those of neutrals. The unexpected\r\nsuccess of these endeavours, which aimed at nothing less than\r\nconcerted establishment of legal standards calculated to maintain the\r\nfreedom of the seas and the interests of neutrals even in time of war,\r\nwas not to be long enjoyed by the peoples concerned.\r\n\r\nHardly had the United Kingdom decided to take part in the war than it\r\nalso began to break through the barriers with which it was confronted\r\nby the standards of international law. While the Central Powers\r\nimmediately on the outbreak of war had announced their intention of\r\nobserving the Declaration of London, which also bore the signature of\r\nthe British representative, England discarded the most important\r\npoints in that Declaration. In the endeavour to cut off the Central\r\nPowers from all supplies by sea, England gradually extended the list\r\nof contraband until it included everything now required by human\r\nbeings for the maintenance of life. Great Britain then placed all the\r\ncoasts of the North Sea--an important transit-way also for the\r\nmaritime trade of Austria-Hungary--under the obstruction of a\r\nso-called \"blockade,\" in order to prevent the entry into Germany of\r\nall goods not yet inscribed on the contraband list, as also to bar all\r\nneutral traffic with those coasts, and prevent any export from the\r\nsame. That this method of proceeding stands in the most lurid\r\ncontradiction to the standards of blockade law arrived at and\r\nestablished by international congress has already been admitted by the\r\nPresident of the United States in words which will live in the history\r\nof the law of nations. By this illegally preventing export of goods\r\nfrom the Central Powers Great Britain thought to be able to shut down\r\nthe innumerable factories and industries which had been set up by\r\nindustrious and highly-developed peoples in the heart of Europe; and\r\nto bring the workers to idleness and thence to want and revolt. And\r\nwhen Austria-Hungary's southern neighbour joined the ranks of the\r\nenemies of the Central Powers her first step was to declare a\r\nblockade of all the coasts of her opponent--following the example, of\r\ncourse, of her Allies--in disregard of the legal precepts which Italy\r\nhad shortly before helped to lay down. Austria-Hungary did not fail to\r\npoint out to the neutral Powers at once that this blockade was void of\r\nall legal validity.\r\n\r\nFor two years the Central Powers have hesitated. Not until then, and\r\nafter long and mature consideration for and against, did they proceed\r\nto answer in like measure and close with their adversaries at sea. As\r\nthe only belligerents who had done everything to secure the observance\r\nof the agreement which should provide for freedom of the seas to\r\nneutrals, it was sorely against their wishes to bow to the need of the\r\nmoment and attack that freedom; but they took that step in order to\r\nfulfil their urgent duty to their peoples and with the conviction that\r\nthe step in question must lead towards the freedom of the seas in the\r\nend. The declarations made by the Central Powers on the last day of\r\nJanuary of this year are only apparently directed against the rights\r\nof neutrals; as a matter of fact, they are working toward the\r\nrestitution of those rights which the enemy has constantly infringed\r\nand would, if victorious, annihilate for ever. The submarines, then,\r\nwhich circle round England's shores, announce to all peoples using and\r\nneeding the sea--and who does not need it?--that the day is not far\r\noff when the flags of all nations shall wave over the seas in newly\r\nacquired freedom.\r\n\r\nIt may doubtless be hoped that this announcement will find echo\r\nwherever neutral peoples live, and that it will be understood in\r\nparticular by the great people of the United States of America, whose\r\nmost famous representative has in the course of the war spoken up with\r\nardent words for the freedom of the seas as the highway of all\r\nnations. If the people and the government of the Union will bear in\r\nmind that the \"blockade\" established by Great Britain is intended not\r\nonly to force the Central Powers to submission by starvation but\r\nultimately to secure undisputed mastery of the sea for itself, and\r\nthereby ensure its supremacy over all other nations, while on the\r\nother hand the blockading of England and its Allies only serves to\r\nrender possible _a peace with honour_ for these Powers and to\r\nguarantee to all peoples the freedom of navigation and maritime trade,\r\nthus ensuring their safe existence, then the question as to which of\r\nthe two belligerent parties has right on its side is already decided.\r\nThough the Central Powers are far from wishing to seek for further\r\nallies in their struggle, they nevertheless feel justified in claiming\r\nthat neutrals should appreciate their endeavours to bring to life\r\nagain the principles of international law and the equal rights of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nProceeding now to answer the questions set forth in the memorandum of\r\nFebruary 18 of this year, already referred to, the Austrian Government\r\nwould first of all remark that in the exchange of Notes in the cases\r\nof the _Ancona_ and _Persia_ this Government restricted itself to\r\nconsideration of the concrete questions which had up to then arisen,\r\nwithout setting forth the legal position in point of principle. In the\r\nNote of December 29, 1915, however, regarding the _Ancona_ case it\r\nreserved the right to bring up the intricate questions of\r\ninternational law connected with the submarine warfare for discussion\r\nat a later date. In reverting now to this point, and taking up the\r\nquestion as to sinking of enemy ships, with which the memorandum is\r\nconcerned, for brief consideration, it is with the hope that it may be\r\nmade clear to the American Government that the Austrian Government now\r\nas heretofore _holds immovably by the assurance already given_, and\r\nwith the endeavour to avoid any misunderstanding between the Monarchy\r\nand the American Union by clearing up the most important question\r\narising out of the submarine warfare--most important as it rests on\r\nthe dictates of humanity.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost the Austrian Government wishes to point out that\r\nthe thesis advanced by the American Government and adopted in many\r\nlearned works--to the effect that enemy merchant vessels, save in the\r\nevent of attempted flight or resistance, should not be destroyed\r\nwithout provision for the safety of those on board--is also, in the\r\nopinion of the Austrian Government itself, the kernel, so to speak, of\r\nthe whole matter. Regarded from a higher point of view, this theory\r\ncan at any rate be considered in connection with possible\r\ncircumstances, and its application be more closely defined; from the\r\ndictates of humanity, which the Austrian Government and the Washington\r\nCabinet have equally adopted as their guide, we can lay down the\r\ngeneral principle that, in exercising the right to destroy enemy\r\nmerchant shipping, loss of life should be avoided as far as possible.\r\nThis necessitates a warning on the part of the belligerent before\r\nexercising the right of destruction. And he can here adopt the method\r\nindicated by the theory of the Union Government referred to, according\r\nto which _the commander of the warship himself issues a warning to the\r\nvessel about to be sunk_, so that crew and passengers can be brought\r\ninto safety at the last moment; or, on the other hand, the Government\r\nof the belligerent state can, when it is considered an imperative\r\nnecessity of war, give warning, with complete effect, _before the\r\nsailing of the vessel_ to be sunk; or, finally, such Government can,\r\nwhen preparing comprehensive measures against the enemy traffic at\r\nsea, have recourse to _a general warning applicable to all enemy\r\nvessels concerned_.\r\n\r\nThat the principle as to providing for the safety of persons on board\r\nis liable to exceptions has been admitted by the Union Government\r\nitself. The Austrian Government believes, however, that destruction\r\nwithout warning is not only justifiable in cases of attempted escape\r\nor resistance. It would seem, to take one instance only, that the\r\ncharacter of the vessel itself should be taken into consideration;\r\nthus merchant ships or other private craft, placed in the service of\r\nwar operations, whether as transports or guardships, or with a\r\nmilitary crew or weapons on board for the purpose of any kind of\r\nhostilities, should doubtless, according to general law, be liable to\r\ndestruction without notice. The Austrian Government need not go into\r\nthe question of how far a belligerent is released from any obligation\r\nas to provision for safety of human life when his opponent sinks enemy\r\nmerchant vessels without such previous warning, as in the well-known\r\ncases, previously referred to, of the _Elektra_, _Dubrovnik_,\r\n_Zagreb_, etc., since, in this respect, despite its evident right, the\r\nAustrian Government itself has never returned like for like.\r\nThroughout the entire course of the war Austro-Hungarian warships have\r\nnot destroyed a single enemy merchant vessel without previous warning,\r\nthough this may have been of a general character.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the Union Government, frequently referred to, also\r\nadmits of several interpretations; the question arises, for instance,\r\nwhether, as has frequently been maintained, only armed resistance can\r\nbe held to justify destruction of ship and persons on board, or\r\nwhether the same applies to resistance of another sort, as, for\r\nexample, when the crew purposely refrain from getting the passengers\r\ninto the boats (the case of the _Ancona_), or when the passengers\r\nthemselves decline to enter the boats. In the opinion of the Austrian\r\nGovernment cases such as those last should also justify destruction of\r\nthe vessel without responsibility for the lives of those on board, as\r\notherwise it would be in the power of anyone on the vessel to deprive\r\nthe belligerent of his right to sink the ship. For the rest it should\r\nalso be borne in mind that there is no unanimity of opinion really as\r\nto when the destruction of enemy merchant tonnage is justifiable at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe obligation as to issuing a warning immediately before sinking a\r\nvessel will, in the view of the Austrian Government on the one hand,\r\ninvolve hardships otherwise avoidable, while, on the other, it may in\r\ncertain circumstances be calculated to prejudice the rightful\r\ninterests of the belligerent. In the first place it cannot be denied\r\nthat saving lives _at sea_ is nearly always a matter of blind\r\nuncertainty, since the only alternatives are to leave them on board a\r\nvessel exposed to the operations of the enemy, or to take them off in\r\nsmall boats to face the dangers of the elements. It is, therefore,\r\nfar more in accordance with the dictates of humanity _to restrain\r\npeople from venturing upon vessels thus endangered by warning them\r\nbeforehand_. For the rest, however, the Austrian Government is not\r\nconvinced, despite careful consideration of all legal questions\r\nconcerned, that the subjects of neutral countries have any claim to\r\nimmunity when travelling on board enemy ships.\r\n\r\nThe principle that neutrals shall also in time of war enjoy the\r\nfreedom of the seas extends only to neutral vessels, not to neutral\r\npersons on board enemy ships, since the belligerents are admittedly\r\njustified in hampering enemy traffic at sea as far as lies in their\r\npower. Granted the necessary military power, they can, if deemed\r\nnecessary to their ends, forbid enemy merchant vessels to sail the\r\nsea, on pain of instant destruction, as long as they make their\r\npurpose known beforehand so that all, whether enemy or neutral, _are\r\nenabled to avoid risking their lives_. But even where there is doubt\r\nas to the justification of such proceeding, and possible reprisals\r\nthreatened by the opposing side, the question would remain one to be\r\ndecided between the belligerents themselves alone, they being\r\nadmittedly allowed the right of making the high seas a field for their\r\nmilitary operations, of suppressing any interruption of such\r\noperations and supremely determining what measures are to be taken\r\nagainst enemy ships. The neutrals have in such case no legitimate\r\nclaims beyond that of demanding that due notice be given them of\r\nmeasures contemplated against the enemy, in order that they may\r\nrefrain from entrusting their persons or goods to enemy vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Government may presumably take it for granted that the\r\nWashington Cabinet agrees with the foregoing views, which the Austrian\r\nGovernment is fully convinced are altogether unassailable. To deny the\r\ncorrectness of these views would imply--and this the Union Government\r\ncan hardly intend--that neutrals have the right of interfering in the\r\nmilitary operations of the belligerents; indeed, ultimately to\r\nconstitute themselves the judges as to what methods may or may not be\r\nemployed against an enemy. It would also seem a crying injustice for a\r\nneutral Government, in order merely to secure for its subjects the\r\nright of passage on enemy ships when they might just as well, or\r\nindeed with far greater safety, travel by neutral vessels, to grasp at\r\nthe arm of a belligerent Power, fighting perhaps for its very\r\nexistence. Not to mention the fact that it would open the way for all\r\nkinds of abuses if a belligerent were forced to lay down arms at the\r\nbidding of any neutral whom it might please to make use of enemy ships\r\nfor business or pleasure. No doubt has ever been raised as to the fact\r\nthat subjects of neutral states are themselves responsible for any\r\nharm they may incur _by their presence in any territory on land where\r\nmilitary operations are in progress_. Obviously, there is no ground\r\nfor establishing another standard for naval warfare, particularly\r\nsince the second Peace Conference expressed the wish that, pending the\r\nagreement of rules for naval warfare, the rules observed in warfare\r\nupon land should be applied as far as possible at sea.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it appears that the rule as to warning being given\r\nto the vessel itself before such vessel is sunk is subject to\r\nexceptions of various kinds under certain circumstances, as, for\r\ninstance, the cases cited by the Union Government of flight and\r\nresistance, the vessel may be sunk without any warning; in others\r\nwarning should be given before the vessel sails. The Austrian\r\nGovernment may then assert that it is essentially in agreement with\r\nthe Union Government as to the protection of neutrals against risk of\r\nlife, whatever may be the attitude of the Washington Cabinet towards\r\nsome of the separate questions here raised. The Austrian Government\r\nhas not only put into practice throughout the war the views it holds\r\nin this respect, but has gone even farther, regulating its actions\r\nwith the strictest care according to the theory advanced by the\r\nWashington Cabinet, although its assurance as published only stated\r\nthat was \"essentially in agreement\" with the Union Government's views.\r\nThe Austrian Government would be extremely satisfied if the Washington\r\nCabinet should be inclined to assist it in its endeavours, which are\r\ninspired by the warmest feelings of humanity, to save American\r\ncitizens from risk at sea by instructing and warning its subjects in\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\nThen, as regards the circular verbal note of February 10 of this year\r\nconcerning the treatment of armed enemy merchant vessels, the Austrian\r\nGovernment must in any case declare itself to be, as indicated in the\r\nforegoing, of the opinion that the arming of trading ships, even when\r\nonly for the purpose of avoiding capture, is not justified in modern\r\ninternational law. The rules provide that a warship is to approach an\r\nenemy merchant vessel in a peaceable manner; it is required to stop\r\nthe vessel by means of certain signals, to interview the captain,\r\nexamine the ship's papers, enter the particulars in due form and,\r\nwhere necessary, make an inventory, etc. But in order to comply with\r\nthese requirements it must obviously be understood that the warship\r\nhas full assurance that the merchant vessel will likewise observe a\r\npeaceable demeanour throughout. And it is clear that no such assurance\r\ncan exist when the merchant vessel is so armed as to be capable of\r\noffering resistance to a warship. A warship can hardly be expected to\r\nact in such a manner under the guns of an enemy, whatever may be the\r\npurpose for which the guns were placed on board. Not to speak of the\r\nfact that the merchant vessels of the Entente Powers, despite all\r\nassurances to the contrary, have been proved to be armed for offensive\r\npurposes, and make use of their armament for such purposes. It would\r\nalso be to disregard the rights of humanity if the crew of a warship\r\nwere expected to surrender to the guns of an enemy without resistance\r\non their own part. No State can regard its duty to humanity as less\r\nvalid in respect of men defending their country than in respect of the\r\nsubjects of a foreign Power.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Government is therefore of opinion that its former\r\nassurance to the Washington Cabinet could not be held to apply to\r\narmed merchant vessels, since these, according to the legal standards\r\nprevailing, whereby hostilities are restricted to organised military\r\nforces, must be regarded as privateers (freebooters) which are liable\r\nto immediate destruction. History shows us that, according to the\r\n_general_ law of nations, merchant vessels have never been justified\r\nin resisting the exercise by warships of the right of taking prizes.\r\nBut even if a standard to this effect could be shown to exist, it\r\nwould not mean that the vessels had the right to provide themselves\r\nwith guns. It should also be borne in mind that the arming of merchant\r\nships must necessarily alter the whole conduct of warfare at sea, and\r\nthat such alteration cannot correspond to the views of those who seek\r\nto regulate maritime warfare according to the principles of humanity.\r\nAs a matter of fact, since the practice of privateering was\r\ndiscontinued, until a few years back no Power has ever thought of\r\narming merchant vessels. Throughout the whole proceedings of the\r\nsecond Peace Conference, which was occupied with all questions of the\r\nlaws of warfare at sea, not a single word was ever said about the\r\narming of merchant ships. Only on one occasion was a casual\r\nobservation made with any bearing on this question, and it is\r\ncharacteristic that it should have been by a British naval officer of\r\nsuperior rank, who impartially declared: \"Lorsqu'un navire de guerre\r\nse propose d'arrêter et de visiter un vaisseau marchand, le\r\ncommandant, avant de mettre une embarcation à la mer, fera tirer un\r\ncoup de canon. Le coup de canon est la meilleure garantie que l'on\r\npuisse donner. _Les navires de commerce n'ont pas de canons à bord._\"\r\n(When a warship intends to stop and board a merchant vessel the\r\ncommander, before sending a boat, will fire a gun. The firing of a gun\r\nis the best guarantee that can be given. _Merchant vessels do not\r\ncarry guns._)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Austria-Hungary has in this regard also held by its\r\nassurance; in the circular verbal note referred to neutrals were\r\ncautioned beforehand against entrusting their persons or their goods\r\non board any armed ship; moreover, the measures announced were not put\r\ninto execution at once, but a delay was granted in order to enable\r\nneutrals already on board armed ships to leave the same. And, finally,\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian warships are instructed, even in case of\r\nencountering armed enemy merchant vessels, to give warning and to\r\nprovide for the safety of those on board, provided it seems possible\r\nto do so in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe statement of the American Ambassador, to the effect that the armed\r\nBritish steamers _Secondo_ and _Welsh Prince_ were sunk without\r\nwarning by Austrian submarines, is based on error. The Austrian\r\nGovernment has in the meantime received information that no\r\nAustro-Hungarian warships were at all concerned in the sinking of\r\nthese vessels.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Government has, as in the circular verbal note already\r\nreferred to--reverting now to the question of aggravated submarine\r\nwarfare referred to in the memorandum--also in its declaration of\r\nJanuary 31 of this year issued a warning to neutrals with\r\ncorresponding time limit; indeed, _the whole of the declaration itself\r\nis, from its nature, nothing more or less than a warning to the effect\r\nthat no merchant vessel may pass the area of sea expressly defined\r\ntherein_. Nevertheless, the Austrian warships have been instructed as\r\nfar as possible to warn such merchant vessels as may be encountered in\r\nthe area concerned and provide for the safety of passengers and crew.\r\nAnd the Austrian Government is in the possession of numerous reports\r\nstating that the crews and passengers of vessels destroyed in these\r\nwaters have been saved. But the Austrian Government cannot accept any\r\nresponsibility for possible loss of human life which may after all\r\noccur in connection with the destruction of armed vessels or vessels\r\nencountered in prohibited areas. Also it may be noted that the\r\nAustro-Hungarian submarines operate only in the Adriatic and\r\nMediterranean Seas, and there is thus hardly any question as to any\r\naction affecting American interests on the part of Austro-Hungarian\r\nwarships.\r\n\r\nAfter all that has been said in the preamble to this Memorandum, it\r\nneed hardly be said that the declaration of the waters in question as\r\na prohibited area is in no way intended as a measure aiming at the\r\ndestruction of human life, or even to endangering the same, but that\r\nits object--apart from the higher aims of _relieving humanity from\r\nfurther suffering by shortening the war_, is only to place Great\r\nBritain and its Allies, who have--without establishing any legally\r\neffective blockade of the coasts of the Central Powers--hindered\r\ntraffic by sea between neutrals and these Powers in a like position of\r\nisolation, and render them amenable to a peace with some guarantee of\r\npermanency. That Austria-Hungary here makes use of other methods of\r\nwar than her opponents is due mainly to circumstances beyond human\r\ncontrol. But the Austrian Government is conscious of having done all\r\nin its power to avoid loss of human life. _The object aimed at in the\r\nblockading of the Western Powers would be most swiftly and certainly\r\nattained if not a single human life were lost or endangered in those\r\nwaters._\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the Austrian Government may point out that the assurance\r\ngiven to the Washington Cabinet in the case of the _Ancona_, and\r\nrenewed in the case of the _Persia_, is neither withdrawn nor\r\nqualified by its statements of February 10, 1916, and January 31,\r\n1917. Within the limits of this assurance the Austrian Government\r\nwill, together with its Allies, continue its endeavours to secure to\r\nthe peoples of the world a share in the blessings of peace. If in the\r\npursuit of this aim--which it may take for granted has the full\r\nsympathy of the Washington Cabinet itself--it should find itself\r\ncompelled to impose restrictions on neutral traffic by sea in certain\r\nareas, it will not need so much to point to the behaviour of its\r\nopponents in this respect, which appears by no means an example to be\r\nfollowed, but rather to the fact that Austria-Hungary, through the\r\npersistence and hatred of its enemies, who are determined upon its\r\ndestruction, is brought to a state of self-defence in so desperate\r\nextreme as is unsurpassed in the history of the world. The Austrian\r\nGovernment is encouraged by the knowledge that the struggle now being\r\ncarried on by Austria-Hungary tends not only toward the preservation\r\nof its own vital interests, but also towards the realisation of the\r\nidea of equal rights for all states; and in this last and hardest\r\nphase of the war, which unfortunately calls for sacrifices on the part\r\nof friends as well, it regards it as of supreme importance to confirm\r\nin word and deed the fact that it is guided equally by the laws of\r\nhumanity and by the dictates of respect for the dignity and interests\r\nof neutral peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n=Speech by Dr. Helfferich, Secretary of State, on the Submarine\r\nWarfare=\r\n\r\nThe _Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_ of May 1, 1917, gives the\r\nfollowing speech by Dr. Helfferich, Secretary of State, on the\r\neconomic effects of the submarine warfare delivered in the principal\r\ncommittee of the Reichstag on April 28. The speech is here given\r\nverbatim, with the exception of portions containing confidential\r\nstatements:\r\n\r\n\"In the sitting of yesterday a member rightly pointed out that the\r\ntechnical and economic results of the submarine warfare have been\r\nestimated with caution. In technical respects the caution observed in\r\nestimating the results is plain; the sinkings have, during the first\r\nmonth, exceeded by nearly a quarter, in the second by nearly half, the\r\nestimated 600,000 tons, and for the present month also we may fairly\r\ncherish the best expectations. The technical success guarantees the\r\neconomic success with almost mathematical exactitude. True, the\r\neconomic results cannot be so easily expressed numerically and set\r\ndown in a few big figures as the technical result in the amount of\r\ntonnage sunk. The economic effects of the submarine warfare are\r\nexpressed in many different spheres covering a wide area, where the\r\nenemy seeks to render visibility still more difficult by resorting, so\r\nto speak, to statistical smoke-screens.\r\n\r\n\"The English statistics to-day are most interesting, one might almost\r\nsay, in what they wisely refrain from mentioning. The Secretary of\r\nState for the Navy pointed out yesterday how rapidly the pride of the\r\nBritish public had faded. The English are now suppressing our reports\r\non the successes of our submarines and our statements as to submarine\r\nlosses; they dare not make public the amount of tonnage sunk, but\r\nmystify the public with shipping statistics which have given rise to\r\ngeneral annoyance in the English Press itself. The English Government\r\nlets its people go on calmly trusting to the myth that instead of six\r\nU-boats sunk there are a hundred at the bottom of the sea. It conceals\r\nfrom the world also the true course of the entries and departures of\r\ntonnage in British ports since the commencement of unrestricted\r\nsubmarine warfare. And more than all, the English Government has since\r\nFebruary suppressed most strictly all figures tending to throw light\r\non the position of the grain market. In the case of the coal exports,\r\nthe country of destination is not published. The monthly trade report,\r\nwhich is usually issued with admirable promptness by the tenth of the\r\nnext month or thereabouts, was for February delayed and incomplete;\r\nand for March it has not yet appeared at all. It is to be regretted\r\nthat this sudden withdrawal of information makes it more difficult for\r\nus to estimate the effect of our submarine operations, but there is a\r\ngratifying side to the question after all. It is not to be supposed\r\nthat England should suddenly become reticent in order to avoid\r\nrevealing its strength.\r\n\r\n\"For the rest, what can be seen is still sufficient to give us an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\"I will commence with the tonnage. You are aware that in the first two\r\nmonths of the unrestricted submarine warfare more than 1,600,000 tons\r\nwere sunk, of which probably considerably over one million tons sailed\r\nunder the British flag.\r\n\r\n\"The estimates as to the quantity of English tonnage at present\r\navailable are somewhat divergent; in any case, whether we take the\r\nhigher or the lower figures, a loss of more than a million tons in two\r\nmonths is a thing that England cannot endure for long. And to replace\r\nit, even approximately, by new building, is out of the question. In\r\nthe year 1914 England's newly-built ships gave a tonnage increment of\r\n1,600,000; in 1915 it was 650,000 tons, in 1916 only 580,000, despite\r\nall efforts. And the normal loss of the British merchant fleet in\r\npeace time amounts to between 700,000 and 800,000 tons. It is hopeless\r\nto think of maintaining equilibrium by urging on the building of new\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n\"The attempts which are made to enlist the neutral tonnage in British\r\nservice by a system of rewards and punishments may here and there, to\r\nthe ultimate disadvantage of the neutrals themselves, have met with\r\nsome success, but even so, the neutrals must consider the need for\r\npreserving a merchant fleet themselves for peace time, so that there\r\nis a narrow limit to what can be attained in this manner. Even in\r\nJanuary of this year about 30 per cent. of the shipping entries into\r\nBritish ports were under foreign flags. I have heard estimates brought\r\nup to 80 per cent. in order to terrify the neutrals; if but 50 per\r\ncent. of this be correct it means a decrease in British shipping\r\ntraffic of roughly one-sixth. Counting tonnage sunk and tonnage\r\nfrightened off, the arrivals at British ports have been reduced, at a\r\nlow estimate, by one-fourth, and probably by as much as one-third, as\r\nagainst January. In January arrivals amounted to 2.2 million net tons.\r\nI may supplement the incomplete English statistics by the information\r\nthat in March the arrivals were only 1.5 to 1.6 million tons net, and\r\nleave it to Mr. Carson to refute this. The 1.5 to 1.6 million tons\r\nrepresent, compared with the average entries in peace time, amounting\r\nto 4.2 millions, not quite 40 per cent. This low rate will be further\r\nprogressively reduced. Lloyd George at the beginning of the war\r\nreckoned on the last milliard. Those days are now past. Then he based\r\nhis plans on munitions. England has here, with the aid of America,\r\nachieved extraordinary results. But the Somme and Arras showed that,\r\neven with those enormous resources, England was not able to beat us.\r\nNow, in his greeting to the American Allies, Lloyd George cries out:\r\n'Ships, ships, and yet more ships.' And this time he is on the right\r\ntack; it is on ships that the fate of the British world-empire will\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\n\"The Americans, too, have understood this. They propose to build a\r\nthousand wooden vessels of 3,000 tons. But before these can be brought\r\ninto action they will, I confidently hope, have nothing left to save.\r\n\r\n\"I base this confidence upon the indications which are visible,\r\ndespite the English policy of suppression and concealment.\r\n\r\n\"Take the total British trade. The figures for March are still not yet\r\navailable, but those for February tell us enough.\r\n\r\n\"British imports amounted in January of this year to 90 million pounds\r\nsterling, in February to only 70 million; the exports have gone down\r\nfrom 46 to 37 millions sterling--imports and exports together showing\r\na decline of over 20 per cent. in the first month of the submarine\r\nwarfare. And again, the rise in prices all round has, since the\r\ncommencement of the U-boat war, continued at a more rapid rate, so\r\nthat the decline in the import quantity from one month to another may\r\nfairly be estimated at 25 per cent. The figures for imports and\r\nexports, then, confirm my supposition as to the decrease of tonnage in\r\nthe traffic with British ports.\r\n\r\n\"The British Government has endeavoured, by the strictest measures\r\nrigorously prohibiting import of less important articles, to ward off\r\nthe decline in the quantity of vital necessaries imported. The attempt\r\ncan only partially succeed.\r\n\r\n\"In 1916, out of a total import quantity of 42 million tons, about 31\r\nmillions fall to three important groups alone, viz., foodstuffs and\r\nluxuries, timber, and iron ore; all other goods, including important\r\nwar materials, such as other ores and metals, petroleum, cotton and\r\nwool, rubber, only 11 million tons, or roughly one-fourth. A decline\r\nof one-fourth, then, as brought about by the first month of\r\nunrestricted submarine warfare, must affect articles indispensable to\r\nlife and to the purposes of war.\r\n\r\n\"The decline in the imports in February, 1917, as against February,\r\n1916, appears as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Wool 17 per cent., cotton 27 per cent., flax 38 per cent., hemp 48\r\nper cent., jute 74 per cent., woollen materials 83 per cent., copper\r\nand copper ore 49 per cent., iron and steel 59 per cent. As to the\r\nimports of iron ore I will give more detailed figures:\r\n\r\n\"Coffee 66 per cent., tea 41 per cent., raw sugar 10 per cent.,\r\nrefined sugar 90 per cent., bacon 17 per cent., butter 21 per cent.,\r\nlard 21 per cent., eggs 39 per cent., timber 42 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"The only increases worth noting are in the case of leather, hides,\r\nrubber and tin.\r\n\r\n\"As regards the group in which we are most interested, the various\r\nsorts of grain, no figures for quantities have been given from\r\nFebruary onwards.\r\n\r\n\"The mere juxtaposition of two comparable values naturally gives no\r\ncomplete idea of the facts. It should be borne in mind that the\r\ncommencement of the unrestricted U-boat campaign came at a time when\r\nthe economical position of England was not normal, but greatly\r\nweakened already by two and a half years of war. A correct judgment\r\nwill, then, only be possible when we take into consideration the\r\nentire development of the imports during the course of the war.\r\n\r\n\"I will here give only the most important figures.\r\n\r\n\"In the case of iron ore, England has up to now maintained its\r\nposition better than in other respects.\r\n\r\n\"Imports amounted in 1913 to 7.4 million tons.\r\n\r\n\"In 1916 to 6.9 million tons.\r\n\r\n\"January, 1913, 689,000 tons; February, 1913, 658,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\"January, 1916, 526,000 tons; February, 1916, 404,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\"January, 1917, 512,000 tons; February, 1917, 508,000 tons.\r\n\r\n\"Here again comparison with the peace year 1913 shows for the months\r\nof January and February a not inconsiderable decrease, though the\r\nimports, especially in February, 1917, were in excess of those for the\r\nsame month in 1916.\r\n\r\n  \"Timber imports, 1913, 10.1 million loads.\r\n     \"       \"     1916,  5.9    \"      \"\r\n     \"   February, 1913, 406,000 loads.\r\n     \"       \"     1916, 286,000   \"\r\n     \"       \"     1917, 167,000   \"\r\n\r\n\"As regards mining timber especially, the import of which fell from\r\n3.5 million loads in 1913 to 2.0 million in 1916, we have here\r\nDecember, 1916, and January, 1917, with 102,000 and 107,000 loads as\r\nthe lowest import figures given since the beginning of 1913; a\r\nstatement for the import of mining timber is missing for February.\r\n\r\n\"Before turning to the import of foodstuffs a word may be said as to\r\nthe export of coal.\r\n\r\n\"The total export of coal has decreased from 78 million tons in 1913\r\nto 461/2 million tons in 1915; in 1916 only about 42 million tons were\r\nexported. In December, 1916, the export quantity fell for the first\r\ntime below 3 million tons, having remained between 3.2 and 3.9 million\r\ntons during the months from January to November, 1916. In January,\r\n1917, a figure of 3.5 million tons was again reached; it is the more\r\nsignificant, therefore, that the coal export, which from the nature of\r\nthe case exhibits only slight fluctuations from month to month, falls\r\nagain in February, 1917, to 2.9 million tons (as against 3.4 million\r\ntons in February of the year before), thus almost reaching once more\r\nto the lowest point hitherto recorded--that of December, 1916. And it\r\nshould be remembered that here, as in the case of all other exports,\r\nsunk transports are included in the English statistics.\r\n\r\n\"Details as to the destination of exported coal have since the\r\nbeginning of this year been withheld. England is presumably desirous\r\nof saving the French and Italians the further distress of reading for\r\nthe future in black and white the calamitous decline in their coal\r\nsupply. The serious nature of this decline, even up to the end of\r\n1916, may be seen from the following figures:\r\n\r\n\"England's coal export to France amounted in December, 1916, to only\r\n1,128,000 tons, as against 1,269,000 tons in January of the same year;\r\nthe exports to Italy in December, 1916, amounted only to 278,000 tons,\r\nas against 431,000 tons in January, and roughly 800,000 tons monthly\r\naverage for the peace year 1913.\r\n\r\n\"As to the further development since the end of February, I am able to\r\ngive some interesting details. Scotland's coal export in the first\r\nweek of April was 103,000 tons, as against 194,000 tons the previous\r\nyear; from the beginning of the year 1,783,000 tons, as against\r\n2,486,000 tons the previous year. From this it is easy to see how the\r\noperations of the U-boats are striking at the root of railway and war\r\nindustries in the countries allied with England.\r\n\r\n\"Lloyd George, in a great speech made on January 22 of this year,\r\nshowed the English how they could protect themselves against the\r\neffects of submarine warfare by increased production in their own\r\ncountry. The practicability and effectiveness of his counsels are more\r\nthan doubtful. He makes no attempt, however, to instruct his Allies\r\nhow they are to protect themselves against the throttling of the coal\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n\"I come now to the most important point: _the position of England with\r\nregard to its food supply_.\r\n\r\n\"First of all I would give a few brief figures by way of calling to\r\nmind the degree to which England is dependent upon supplies of\r\nfoodstuffs from overseas.\r\n\r\n\"The proportion of imports in total British consumption averaged\r\nduring the last years of peace as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Bread-corn, close on 80 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"Fodder-grain (barley, oats, maize), which can be utilised as\r\nsubstitutes for, and to supplement, the bread-corn, 50 per cent.;\r\nmeat, over 40 per cent.; butter, 60-65 per cent. The sugar\r\nconsumption, failing any home production at all, must be entirely\r\ncovered by imports from abroad.\r\n\r\n\"I would further point out that our U-boats, inasmuch as concerns the\r\nfood situation in England, are operating under quite exceptionally\r\nfavourable conditions; the world's record harvest of 1915 has been\r\nfollowed by the world's worst harvest of 1916, representing a loss of\r\n45-50 million tons of bread and fodder-grain. The countries hardest\r\nhit are those most favourably situated, from the English point of\r\nview, in North America. The effects are now--the rich stocks from the\r\nformer harvest having been consumed--becoming more evident every day\r\nand everywhere. The Argentine has put an embargo on exports of grain.\r\nAs to the condition of affairs in the United States, this may be seen\r\nfrom the following figures:\r\n\r\n\"The Department of Agriculture estimates the stocks of wheat still in\r\nthe hands of the farmer on March 1, 1917, at 101 million bushels, or\r\nlittle over 21/2 million tons. The stocks for the previous year on that\r\ndate amounted to 241 million bushels. Never during the whole of the\r\ntime I have followed these figures back have the stocks been so low or\r\neven nearly so. The same applies to stocks of maize. Against a supply\r\nof 1,138,000 bushels on March 1, 1916, we have for this year only\r\n789,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n\"The extraordinary scarcity of supplies is nearing the panic limit.\r\nThe movement of prices during the last few weeks is simply fantastic.\r\nMaize, which was noted in Chicago at the beginning of January, 1917,\r\nat 95 cents, rose by the end of April to 127 cents, and by April 25\r\nhad risen further to 148 cents. Wheat in New York, which stood at 871/4\r\ncents in July, 1914, and by the beginning of 1917 had already risen to\r\n1911/2 cents, rose at the beginning of April to 229 cents, and was noted\r\nat no less than 281 on April 2. This is three and a half times the\r\npeace figure! In German currency at normal peace time exchange, these\r\n281 cents represent about 440 marks per ton, or, at present rate of\r\nexchange for dollars, about 580 marks per ton.\r\n\r\n\"That, then, is the state of affairs in the country which is to help\r\nEngland in the war of starvation criminally begun by itself!\r\n\r\n\"In England no figures are now made public as to imports and stocks of\r\ngrain. I can, however, state as follows:\r\n\r\n\"On the last date for which stocks were noted, January 13, 1917,\r\nEngland's visible stocks of wheat amounted to 5.3 million quarters, as\r\nagainst 6.3 and 5.9 million quarters in the two previous years. From\r\nJanuary to May and June there is, as a rule, a marked decline in the\r\nstocks, and even in normal years the imports during these months do\r\nnot cover the consumption. In June, 1914 and 1915, the visible stocks\r\namounted only to about 2 million quarters, representing the\r\nrequirements for scarcely three weeks.\r\n\r\n\"We have no reason to believe that matters have developed more\r\nfavourably during the present year. This is borne out by the import\r\nfigures for January--as published. The imports of bread-corn and\r\nfodder-grain--I take them altogether, as in the English regulations\r\nfor eking out supplies--amounted only to 12.6 million quarters, as\r\nagainst 19.8 and 19.2 in the two previous years.\r\n\r\n\"For February the English statistics show an increase in the import\r\nvalue of unstated import quantity of all grain of 50 per cent., as\r\nagainst February, 1916. This gives, taking the distribution among the\r\nvarious sorts of grain as similar to that of January, and reckoning\r\nwith the rise in prices since, about the same import quantity as in\r\nthe previous year. But in view of the great decrease in American grain\r\nshipments and the small quantity which can have come from India and\r\nAustralia the statement is hardly credible. We may take it that March\r\nhas brought a further decline, and that to-day, when we are nearing\r\nthe time of the three-week stocks, the English supplies are lower than\r\nin the previous years.\r\n\r\n\"The English themselves acknowledge this. Lloyd George stated in\r\nFebruary that the English grain supplies were lower than ever within\r\nthe memory of man. A high official in the English Ministry of\r\nAgriculture, Sir Ailwyn Fellowes, speaking in April at an agricultural\r\ncongress, added that owing to the submarine warfare, which was an\r\nextremely serious peril to England, the state of affairs had grown far\r\nworse even than then.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Bathurst, of the British Food Controller's Department\r\n(_Kriegsernährungsamt_), stated briefly on April 19 that the then\r\nconsumption of breadstuffs was 50 per cent. in excess of the present\r\n_and prospective_ supplies. It would be necessary to reduce the\r\nconsumption of bread by fully a third in order to make ends meet.\r\n\r\n\"Shortly before, Mr. Wallhead, a delegate from Manchester, at a\r\nconference of the Independent Labour Party in Leeds had stated that,\r\naccording to his information, England would in six to eight weeks be\r\nin a complete state of famine.\r\n\r\n\"The crisis in which England is placed--and we can fairly call it a\r\ncrisis now--is further aggravated by the fact that the supplies of\r\nother important foodstuffs have likewise taken an unfavourable turn.\r\n\r\n\"The import of meat in February, 1917, shows the lowest figures for\r\nmany years, with the single exception of September, 1914.\r\n\r\n\"The marked falling off in the butter imports--February, 1917, showing\r\nonly half as much as in the previous year--is not nearly\r\ncounterbalanced by the margarine which England is making every effort\r\nto introduce.\r\n\r\n\"The import of lard also, most of which comes from the United States,\r\nshows a decline, owing to the poor American crops of fodder-stuffs.\r\nThe price of lard in Chicago has risen from 151/2 cents at the beginning\r\nof January, 1917, to 211/2 cents on April 25, and the price of pigs in\r\nthe same time from 9.80 to 16.50 dollars.\r\n\r\n\"Most serious of all, however, is the shortage of potatoes, which at\r\npresent is simply catastrophic. The English crop was the worst for a\r\ngeneration past. The imports are altogether insignificant. Captain\r\nBathurst stated on April 19 that in about four weeks the supplies of\r\npotatoes in the country would be entirely exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"The full seriousness of the case now stares English statesmen in the\r\nface. Up to now they have believed it possible to exorcise the danger\r\nby voluntary economies. Now they find themselves compelled to have\r\nrecourse to compulsory measures. I believe it is too late.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State then gives a detailed account of the measures\r\ntaken up to date in England for dealing with the food question, and\r\nthereafter continues:\r\n\r\n\"On March 22 again the English food dictator, Lord Devonport, stated\r\nin the House of Lords that a great reduction in the consumption of\r\nbread would be necessary, but that it would be _a national disaster_\r\nif England should have to resort to compulsion.\r\n\r\n\"His representative, Bathurst, stated at the same time: 'We do not\r\nwish to introduce _so un-English a system_. In the first place,\r\nbecause we believe that the patriotism of the people can be trusted to\r\nassist us in our endeavours towards economy, and, further, because, as\r\nwe can see from the example of Germany, the compulsory system promises\r\nno success; finally, because such a system would necessitate a too\r\ncomplicated administrative machinery and too numerous staffs of men\r\nand women whose services could be better employed elsewhere.'\r\n\r\n\"Meantime the English Government has, on receipt of the latest\r\nreports, decided to adopt this un-English system which has proved a\r\nfailure in Germany, declaring now that the entire organisation for the\r\npurpose is in readiness.\r\n\r\n\"I have still something further to say about the vigorous steps now\r\nbeing taken in England to further the progress of agriculture in the\r\ncountry itself. I refrain from going into this, however, as the\r\nmeasures in question cannot come to anything by next harvest time, nor\r\ncan they affect that harvest at all. The winter deficiency can hardly\r\nbe balanced, even with the greatest exertions, by the spring. Not\r\nuntil the 1918 crop, if then, can any success be attained. And between\r\nthen and now lies a long road, a road of suffering for England, and\r\nfor all countries dependent upon imports for their food supply.\r\n\r\n\"Everything points to the likelihood that the universal failure of the\r\nharvest in 1916 will be followed by a like universal failure in 1917.\r\nIn the United States the official reports of acreage under crops are\r\nworse than ever, showing 63.4, against 78.3 the previous year. The\r\nwinter wheat is estimated at only 430 million bushels, as against 492\r\nmillion bushels for the previous year and 650 million bushels for\r\n1915.\r\n\r\n\"The prospects, then, for the next year's harvest are poor indeed, and\r\noffer no hope of salvation to our enemies.\r\n\r\n\"As to our own outlook, this is well known to those present: short,\r\nbut safe--for we can manage by ourselves. And to-day we can say that\r\nthe war of starvation, that crime against humanity, has turned against\r\nthose who commenced it. We hold the enemy in an iron grip. No one can\r\nsave them from their fate. Not even the apostles of humanity across\r\nthe great ocean, who are now commencing to protect the smaller nations\r\nby a blockade of our neutral neighbours through prohibition of\r\nexports, and seeking thus to drive them, under the lash of starvation,\r\ninto entering into the war against us.\r\n\r\n\"Our enemies are feeling the grip of the fist that holds them by the\r\nneck. They are trying to force a decision. England, mistress of the\r\nseas, is seeking to attain its end by land, and driving her sons by\r\nhundreds of thousands to death and mutilation. Is this the England\r\nthat was to have sat at ease upon its island till we were starved into\r\nsubmission, that could wait till their big brother across the Atlantic\r\narrived on the scene with ships and million armies, standing fast in\r\ncrushing superiority until the last annihilating battle?\r\n\r\n\"No, gentlemen, our enemies have no longer time to wait. Time is on\r\nour side now. True, the test imposed upon us by the turn of the\r\nworld's history is enormous. What our troops are doing to help, what\r\nour young men in blue are doing, stands far above all comparison. But\r\nthey will attain their end. For us at home, too, it is hard; not so\r\nhard by far as for them out there, yet hard enough. Those at home must\r\ndo their part as well. If we remain true to ourselves, keeping our own\r\nhouse in order, maintaining internal unity, then we have won existence\r\nand the future for our Fatherland. Everything is at stake. The German\r\npeople is called upon now, in these weeks heavy with impending\r\ndecision, to show that it is worthy of continued existence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n=Speech by Count Czernin to the Austrian Delegation, January 24,\r\n1918.=\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, it is my duty to give you a true picture of the peace\r\nnegotiations, to set forth the various phases of the results obtained\r\nup to now, and to draw therefrom such conclusions as are true, logical\r\nand justifiable.\r\n\r\n\"First of all it seems to me that those who consider the progress of\r\nthe negotiations too slow cannot have even an approximate idea of the\r\ndifficulties which we naturally had to encounter at every step. I will\r\nin my remarks take the liberty of setting forth these difficulties,\r\nbut would like first to point out a cardinal difference existing\r\nbetween the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk and all others which\r\nhave ever taken place in the history of the world. Never, so far as I\r\nam aware, have peace negotiations been conducted with open windows. It\r\nwould be impossible that negotiations of the depth and extent of the\r\npresent could from the start proceed smoothly and without opposition.\r\nWe are faced with nothing less than the task of building up a new\r\nworld, of restoring all that the most merciless of all wars has\r\ndestroyed and cast down. In all the peace negotiations we know of the\r\nvarious phases have been conducted more or less behind closed doors,\r\nthe results being first declared to the world when the whole was\r\ncompleted. All history books tell us, and indeed it is obvious enough,\r\nthat the toilsome path of such peace negotiations leads constantly\r\nover hill and dale, the prospects appearing often more or less\r\nfavourable day by day. But when the separate phases themselves, the\r\ndetails of each day's proceedings, are telegraphed all over the world\r\nat the time, it is again obvious that nervousness prevailing\r\nthroughout the world must act like an electric current and excite\r\npublic opinion accordingly. We were fully aware of the disadvantage of\r\nthis method of proceeding. Nevertheless we at once agreed to the wish\r\nof the Russian Government in respect of this publicity, desiring to\r\nmeet them as far as possible, and also because we had nothing to\r\nconceal on our part, and because it would have made an unfavourable\r\nimpression if we had stood firmly by the methods hitherto pursued, of\r\nsecrecy until completion. _But the complete publicity in the\r\nnegotiations makes it insistent that the great public, the country\r\nbehind, and above all the leaders, must keep cool._ The match must be\r\nplayed out in cold blood, and the end will be satisfactory if the\r\npeoples of the Monarchy support their representatives at the\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n\"It should be stated beforehand that the basis on which\r\nAustria-Hungary treats with the various newly-constituted Russian\r\nstates is that of 'no indemnities and no annexations.' That is the\r\nprogramme which a year ago, shortly after my appointment as Minister,\r\nI put before those who wished to talk of peace, and which I repeated\r\nto the Russian leaders on the occasion of their first offers of peace.\r\nAnd I have not deviated from that programme. Those who believe that I\r\nam to be turned from the way which I have set myself to follow are\r\npoor psychologists. I have never left the public in the slightest\r\ndoubt as to which way I intended to go, and I have never allowed\r\nmyself to be turned aside so much as a hair's breadth from that way,\r\neither to right or left. And I have since become far from a favourite\r\nof the Pan-Germans and of those in the Monarchy who follow the\r\nPan-German ideas. I have at the same time been hooted as an inveterate\r\npartisan of war by those whose programme is peace at any price, as\r\ninnumerable letters have informed me. Neither has ever disturbed me;\r\non the contrary, the double insults have been my only comfort in this\r\nserious time. I declare now once again that I ask not a single\r\nkreuzer, not a single square metre of land from Russia, and that if\r\nRussia, as appears to be the case, takes the same point of view, then\r\npeace must result. Those who wish for peace at any price might\r\nentertain some doubt as to my 'no-annexation' intentions towards\r\nRussia if I did not tell them to their faces with the same complete\r\nfrankness that I shall never assent to the conclusion of a peace going\r\nbeyond the lines just laid down. If the Russian delegates demand any\r\nsurrender of territory on our part, or any war indemnity, then I shall\r\ncontinue the war, despite the fact that I am as anxious for peace as\r\nthey, or I would resign if I could not attain the end I seek.\r\n\r\n\"This once said, and emphatically asserted, that there is no ground\r\nfor the pessimistic anticipation of the peace falling through, since\r\nthe negotiating committees are agreed on the basis of no annexations\r\nor indemnities--and nothing but new instructions from the various\r\nRussian Governments, or their disappearance, could shift that basis--I\r\nthen pass to the two great difficulties in which are contained the\r\nreasons why the negotiations have not proceeded as quickly as we all\r\nwished.\r\n\r\n\"The first difficulty is this: that we are not dealing with _a single_\r\nRussian peace delegation, but with various newly-formed Russian\r\nstates, whose spheres of action are as yet by no means definitely\r\nfixed or explained among themselves. We have to reckon with the\r\nfollowing: firstly, the Russia which is administered from St.\r\nPetersburg; secondly, our new neighbour proper, the great State of\r\nUkraine; thirdly, Finland; and, fourthly, the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n\"With the first two of these states we are treating directly; that is\r\nto say, face to face; with the two others it was at first in a more or\r\nless indirect fashion, as they had not sent any representative to\r\nBrest-Litovsk. We have then four Russian parties, and four separate\r\nPowers on our own side to meet them. The case of the Caucasus, with\r\nwhich we ourselves have, of course, no direct questions to settle, but\r\nwhich, on the other hand, is in conflict with Turkey, will serve to\r\nshow the extent of the matter to be debated.\r\n\r\n\"The point in which we ourselves are most directly interested is that\r\nof the great newly-established state upon our frontiers, Ukraine. In\r\nthe course of the proceedings we have already got well ahead with this\r\ndelegation. We are agreed upon the aforementioned basis of no\r\nindemnities and no annexations, and have in the main arrived at a\r\nsettlement on the point that trade relations are to be re-established\r\nwith the new republic, as also on the manner of so doing. But this\r\nvery case of the Ukraine illustrates one of the prevailing\r\ndifficulties. While the Ukraine Republic takes up the position of\r\nbeing entirely autonomous and justified in treating independently with\r\nourselves, the Russian delegation insists that the boundaries between\r\ntheir territory and that of the Ukraine are not yet definitely fixed,\r\nand that Petersburg is therefore able to claim the right of taking\r\npart in our deliberations with the Ukraine, which claim is not\r\nadmitted by the members of the Ukraine delegation themselves. This\r\nunsettled state of affairs in the internal conditions of Russia,\r\nhowever, gave rise to very serious delays. We have got over these\r\ndifficulties, and I hope that in a few days' time we shall be able\r\nonce more to resume negotiations.\r\n\r\n\"As to the position to-day, I cannot say what this may be. I received\r\nyesterday from my representative at Brest-Litovsk the following two\r\ntelegrams:\r\n\r\n\"'Herr Joffe has this evening, in his capacity as President of the\r\nRussian Delegation, issued a circular letter to the delegations of the\r\nfour allied Powers in which he states that the Workers' and Peasants'\r\nGovernment of the Ukrainian Republic has decided to send two delegates\r\nto Brest-Litovsk with instructions to take part in the peace\r\nnegotiations on behalf of the central committee of the workers',\r\nsoldiers' and peasants' councils of Pan-Ukraine, but also to form a\r\nsupplementary part of the _Russian_ delegation itself. Herr Joffe adds\r\nwith regard to this that the Russian delegation is prepared to receive\r\nthese Ukrainian representatives among themselves. The above statement\r\nis supplemented by a copy of a \"declaration\" dated from Kharkov,\r\naddressed to the President of the Russian Peace Delegation at Brest,\r\nand emanating from the Workers' and Peasants' Government of the\r\nUkrainian Republic, proclaiming that the Central Rada at Kiev only\r\nrepresents the propertied classes, and is consequently incapable of\r\nacting on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people. The Ukrainian\r\nWorkers' and Peasants' Government declares that it cannot acknowledge\r\nany decisions arrived at by the delegates of the Central Rada at Kiev\r\nwithout its participation, but has nevertheless decided to send\r\nrepresentatives to Brest-Litovsk, there to participate as a\r\nsupplementary fraction of the Russian Delegation, which they recognise\r\nas the accredited representatives of the Federative Government of\r\nRussia.'\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore: 'The German translation of the Russian original text of\r\nthe communication received yesterday evening from Herr Joffe regarding\r\nthe delegates of the Ukrainian Government at Kharkov and the two\r\nappendices thereto runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'To the President of the Austro-Hungarian Peace Delegation.\r\n\r\n\"'Sir,--In forwarding you herewith a copy of a declaration received by\r\nme from the delegates of the Workers' and Peasants' Government of the\r\nUkrainian Republic, W.M. Schachrai and J.G. Medwjedew, and their\r\nmandates, I have the honour to inform you that the Russian Delegation,\r\nin full agreement with its frequently repeated acknowledgment of the\r\nright of self-determination among all peoples--including naturally the\r\nUkrainian--sees nothing to hinder the participation of the\r\nrepresentatives of the Workers' and Peasants' Government of the\r\nUkrainian Republic in the peace negotiations, and receives them,\r\naccording to their wish, among the personnel of the Russian Peace\r\nDelegation, as accredited representatives of the Workers' and\r\nPeasants' Government of the Ukrainian Republic. In bringing this to\r\nyour knowledge, I beg you, sir, to accept the expression of my most\r\nsincere respect.--The President of the Russian Peace Delegation:\r\nA. JOFFE.'\r\n\r\n\"'Appendix 1.

In the name\r\nof the Ukrainian workers, soldiers and peasants, we declare\r\ncategorically that all resolutions formed by the General Secretariat\r\nwithout our assent will not be accepted by the Ukrainian people,\r\ncannot be carried out, and can in no case be realised.\r\n\r\n\"'In full agreement with the Council of People's Commissaries, and\r\nthus also with the Delegation of the Russian Workers' and Peasants'\r\nGovernment, we shall for the future undertake the conduct of the peace\r\nnegotiations with the Delegation of the four Powers, together with the\r\nRussian Peace Delegation.\r\n\r\n\"'And we now bring to the knowledge of the President the following\r\nresolution, passed by the Central Executive Committee of the\r\nPan-Ukrainian Council of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies,\r\non the 30th December, 1917/12th January, 1918:\r\n\r\n\"'The Central Committee has decided: To delegate Comrade Medwjedew,\r\nPresident of the Central Executive Committee, and People's Secretary\r\nSatonski and Commissary Schachrai, to take part in the peace\r\nnegotiations, instructing them at the same time to declare\r\ncategorically that all attempts of the Ukrainian Central Rada to act\r\nin the name of the Ukrainian people are to be regarded as _arbitrary\r\nsteps_ on the part of the bourgeois group of the Ukrainian population,\r\nagainst the will and interests of the working classes of the Ukraine,\r\nand that no resolutions formed by the Central Rada will be\r\nacknowledged either by the Ukrainian Soviet Government or by the\r\nUkrainian people; that the Ukrainian Workers' and Peasants' Government\r\nregards the Council of People's Commissaries as representatives of the\r\nPan-Russian Soviet Government, and as accordingly entitled to act on\r\nbehalf of the entire Russian Federation; and that the delegation of\r\nthe Ukrainian Workers' and Peasants' Government, sent out for the\r\npurpose of exposing the arbitrary steps of the Ukrainian Central Rada,\r\nwill act together with and in full agreement with the Pan-Russian\r\nDelegation.\r\n\r\n\"'Herewith: The mandate issued by the People's Secretariat of the\r\nUkrainian Workers' and Peasants' Republic, 30th December, 1917.\r\n\r\n\"'Note: People's Secretary for Enlightenment of the People, Wladimir\r\nPetrowitch Satonski, was taken ill on the way, and did not therefore\r\narrive with us.\r\n\r\n\"'January, 1918.\r\n\r\n\"'The President of the Central Executive Committee of the Ukrainian\r\nCouncil of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, E.

With\r\nthis end in view the mentioned deputies, Jesim Gregoriewitch\r\nMedwjedew, Wasili Matwjejewitch Schachrai and Wladimir Petrowitch\r\nSatonski are empowered, in all cases where they deem it necessary, to\r\nissue declarations and to sign documents in the name of the Workers'\r\nand Peasants' Government of the Ukrainian Republic.

Joffe.'\r\n\r\n\"This is at any rate a new difficulty, since we cannot and will not\r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of Russia.\r\n\r\n\"This once disposed of, however, there will be no further difficulties\r\nto encounter here; we shall, in agreement with the Ukrainian Republic\r\ndetermine that _the old boundaries between Austria-Hungary and the\r\nformer Russia will also be maintained as between ourselves and the\r\nUkraine._\r\n\r\n\r\n=Poland=\r\n\r\n\"As regards Poland, the frontiers of which, by the way, have not yet\r\nbeen exactly determined, _we want nothing at all from this new state_.\r\nFree and uninfluenced, the population of Poland shall choose its own\r\nfate. For my part I attach no great weight to the _form_ of the\r\npeople's vote in this respect; _the more surely it expresses the\r\ngeneral wish of the people, the better I shall be pleased_. For I\r\ndesire only the _voluntary_ attachment of Poland; only in the express\r\n_wish_ of Poland itself toward that end can I see any guarantee for\r\nlasting harmony. It is my unalterable conviction that _the Polish\r\nquestion must not be allowed to delay the signing of peace by a single\r\nday_. If, after peace is arrived at, Poland should wish to approach\r\nus, we will not reject its advances--_the Polish question must not and\r\nshall not endanger the peace itself_.\r\n\r\n\"I should have been glad if _the Polish Government had been able to\r\ntake part in the negotiations_, since in my opinion Poland is _an\r\nindependent state_. The Petersburg Government, however, takes the\r\nattitude that the present Polish Government is not entitled to speak\r\nin the name of the country, and does not acknowledge it as competent\r\nto represent the country, and we therefore gave way on this point in\r\norder to avoid possible conflict. The question is certainly one of\r\nimportance, but it is more important still in my opinion _to set aside\r\nall difficulties likely to delay the negotiations_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=German-Russian Differences as to the Occupied Areas=\r\n\r\n\"The second difficulty to be reckoned with, and one which has been\r\nmost widely echoed in the Press, is the _difference of opinion between\r\nour German allies and the Petersburg Government_ anent the\r\ninterpretation of _the right of self-determination among the Russian\r\npeoples_; that is to say, in the areas occupied by German troops.\r\nGermany maintains that it _does not aim at any annexation of territory\r\nby force_ from Russia, but, briefly stated, the difference of opinion\r\nis a double one.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, Germany rightly maintains that _the numerous\r\nexpressions of desire for independence_ on the part of _legislative\r\ncorporations, communal representations_, etc., in the occupied areas\r\nshould be taken as the _provisional_ basis for the will of the people,\r\nto be _later_ tested by _plebiscite on a broader foundation_, a point\r\nof view which the Russian Government at first was indisposed to agree\r\nto, as it did not consider the existing administrations in Courland\r\nand Lithuania entitled to speak for those provinces any more than in\r\nthe case of Poland.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place, Russia demands that this plebiscite shall take\r\nplace _after all German troops and officials have been withdrawn from\r\nthe occupied provinces_, while Germany, in reply to this, points out\r\nthat if this principle were carried to its utmost limits it would\r\ncreate a vacuum, which could not fail to bring about at once a state\r\nof complete anarchy and the utmost misery. It should here be noted\r\nthat everything in these provinces which to-day renders possible the\r\nlife of a state at all is _German property_. Railways, posts and\r\ntelegraphs, the entire industry, and moreover the entire\r\nadministrative machinery, police, law courts, all are in German hands.\r\nThe sudden withdrawal of all this apparatus would, in fact, create a\r\ncondition of things which seems _practically impossible to maintain_.\r\n\r\n\"In both cases it is a question of finding a _middle way_, which\r\nmoreover _must be found_.\r\n\r\n\"_The differences between these two points of view are in my opinion\r\nnot great enough to justify failure of the negotiations_.\r\n\r\n\"But such negotiations cannot be settled from one day to another; they\r\ntake time.\r\n\r\n\"_If once we have attained peace with Russia, then in my opinion the\r\ngeneral peace cannot be long delayed_, despite all efforts on the part\r\nof the Western Entente statesmen. I have learned that some are unable\r\nto understand why I stated in my first speech after the resumption of\r\nnegotiations that it was not now a question at Brest of a general\r\npeace, but of a _separate peace with Russia_. This was the necessary\r\nrecognition of a plain fact, which Herr Trotski also has admitted\r\nwithout reserve, and it was necessary, since the negotiations would\r\nhave been on a different footing--that is to say, _in a more limited\r\nsphere_--if treating with Russia alone than if it were a case of\r\ntreating for a general peace.\r\n\r\n\"Though I have no illusions in the direction of expecting the fruit of\r\ngeneral peace to ripen in a single night, I am nevertheless convinced\r\nthat the fruit _has begun to ripen_, and that it is now only a\r\nquestion of holding out whether we are to obtain a general honourable\r\npeace or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wilson's Message=\r\n\r\n\"I have recently been confirmed in this view by the offer of peace put\r\nforward by the President of the United States of America to the whole\r\nworld. This is _an offer of peace_, for in fourteen points Mr. Wilson\r\nsets forth the principles upon which he seeks to establish a general\r\npeace. Obviously, an offer of this nature cannot be expected to\r\nfurnish a scheme acceptable in every detail. If that were the case,\r\nthen negotiations would be superfluous altogether, and peace could be\r\narrived at by a simple acceptance, a single assent. This, of course,\r\nis not so.\r\n\r\n\"_But I have no hesitation in declaring that these last proposals on\r\nthe part of President Wilson seem to me considerably nearer the\r\nAustro-Hungarian point of view_, and that there are among his\r\nproposals some which we can even agree to _with great pleasure_.\r\n\r\n\"If I may now be allowed to go further into these proposals, I must,\r\nto begin with, point out two things:\r\n\r\n\"So far as the proposals are concerned with _our Allies_--mention is\r\nmade of the German possession of _Belgium_ and of the _Turkish\r\nEmpire_--I declare that, in fulfilment of our duty to our Allies, I am\r\nfirmly determined _to hold out in defence of our Allies to the very\r\nlast. The pre-war possessions of our Allies we will defend equally\r\nwith our own_. This standpoint is that of all four Allies in complete\r\nreciprocity with ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place, I have to point out that I must _politely but\r\ndefinitely decline_ to consider the Point dealing with our internal\r\nGovernment. We have in Austria _a parliament elected by general,\r\nequal, direct and secret ballot_. There is not a more democratic\r\nparliament in the world, and this parliament, together with the other\r\nconstitutionally admissible factors, has the sole right to decide upon\r\nmatters of _Austrian internal affairs_. I speak of _Austria_ only,\r\nbecause I do not refer to _Hungarian_ internal affairs in the\r\n_Austrian Delegation_. I should not consider it constitutional to do\r\nso. _And we do not interfere in American affairs; but, on the other\r\nhand, we do not wish for any foreign guidance from any state\r\nwhatever._ Having said this, I may be permitted, with regard to the\r\nremaining Points, to state as follows:\r\n\r\n\"As to the Point dealing with the abolition of 'secret diplomacy' and\r\nthe introduction of full openness in the negotiations, I have nothing\r\nto say. From my point of view I have _no objection to such public\r\nnegotiations so long as full reciprocity_ is the basis of the same,\r\nthough I do entertain _considerable doubt_ as to whether, all things\r\nconsidered, _it is the quickest and most practical method_ of arriving\r\nat a result. Diplomatic negotiations are simply a matter of business.\r\nBut it might easily be imagined that in the case, for instance, of\r\ncommercial treaties between one country and another it would not be\r\nadvisable _to publish incomplete results beforehand_ to the world. In\r\nsuch negotiations both parties naturally commence by setting their\r\ndemands as high as possible in order to climb down gradually, using\r\nthis or that expressed demand as matter for _compensation in_ other\r\nways until finally an _equilibrium of the opposing interests is\r\narrived at_, a point which must necessarily be reached if agreement is\r\nto be come to at all. If such negotiations were to be carried on with\r\nfull publicity, nothing could prevent the general public from\r\npassionately defending every separate clause involved, regarding any\r\nconcession as a defeat, even when such clauses had only been advanced\r\n_for tactical reasons_. And when the public takes up any such point\r\nwith particular fervour, ultimate agreement may be thereby rendered\r\nimpossible or the final agreement may, if arrived at, be regarded as\r\nin itself _a defeat_, possibly by both sides. And this would not\r\nconduce to peaceable relations thereafter; it would, on the contrary,\r\n_increase the friction_ between the states concerned. And as in the\r\ncase of commercial treaties, so also with _political_ negotiations,\r\nwhich deal with political matters.\r\n\r\n\"If the abolition of secret diplomacy is to mean that _no secret\r\ncompacts are to be made_, that no agreements are to be entered upon\r\nwithout the public knowledge, then I have no objection to the\r\nintroduction of this principle. As to how it is to be realised and\r\nadherence thereto ensured, I confess I have no idea at all. Granted\r\nthat the governments of two countries are agreed, they will always be\r\nable to make a secret compact without the public being aware of the\r\nfact. These, however, are minor points. I am not one to stick by\r\nformalities, and _a question of more or less formal nature will never\r\nprevent me from coming to a sensible arrangement_.\r\n\r\n\"Point 1, then, is one that can be discussed.\r\n\r\n\"Point 2 is concerned with the _freedom of the seas_. In this\r\npostulate the President speaks from the hearts of all, and I can here\r\n_fully and completely share America's desire_, the more so as the\r\nPresident adds the words, 'outside territorial waters'--that is to\r\nsay, we are to understand the freedom of _the open sea_, and there is\r\nthus, of course, no question of any interference by force in the\r\nsovereign rights of our faithful _Turkish_ Allies. Their standpoint in\r\nthis respect will be ours.\r\n\r\n\"Point 3, which is definitely directed against any _future economic\r\nwar_, is so right, so sensible, and has so often been craved by\r\nourselves that I have here again nothing to remark.\r\n\r\n\"Point 4, which demands _general disarmament_, sets forth in\r\nparticularly clear and lucid form the necessity of reducing after this\r\npresent war the free competition in armaments to a footing sufficient\r\nfor the _internal security_ of states. Mr. Wilson states this frankly\r\nand openly. In my speech at Budapest some months back I ventured to\r\nexpress the same idea; it forms _part of my political creed_, and I\r\nam most happy to find any other voice uttering the same thought.\r\n\r\n\"As regards the _Russian clause_, we are already showing in deeds that\r\nwe are endeavouring to bring about friendly relations with our\r\nneighbours there.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to _Italy, Serbia, Roumania and Montenegro_, I can only\r\nrepeat my statement already made in the Hungarian Delegation.\r\n\r\n\"I am not disposed to effect any insurance on the war ventures of our\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\"I am not disposed to make any one-sided concessions to our enemies,\r\nwho still obstinately adhere to the standpoint of fighting on until\r\nthe final victory; to prejudice permanently the Monarchy by such\r\nconcessions, which would give the enemy the invaluable advantage of\r\nbeing able to carry on the war indefinitely without risk.\r\n(_Applause._)\r\n\r\n\"Let Mr. Wilson use the great influence he undoubtedly possesses among\r\nhis Allies to persuade them on their part to declare _on what\r\nconditions they are willing to treat_; he will then have rendered the\r\nenormous service of having set on foot the _general peace\r\nnegotiations_. I am here replying openly and freely to Mr. Wilson, and\r\nI will speak as openly and freely to any who wish to speak for\r\nthemselves, but it must necessarily be understood that _time, and the\r\ncontinuation of the war, cannot but affect the situations here\r\nconcerned_.\r\n\r\n\"I have already said this once before; Italy is a striking example.\r\nItaly had the opportunity before the war of making great territorial\r\nacquisitions without firing a shot. It declined this and entered into\r\nthe war; it has lost hundreds of thousands of lives, milliards in war\r\nexpenses and values destroyed; it has brought want and misery upon its\r\nown population, and all this _only to lose for ever an advantage which\r\nit might have won_.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, as regards Point 13, it is an open secret that we are\r\nadherents to the idea of establishing 'an independent Polish State to\r\ninclude the areas undoubtedly occupied by Polish inhabitants.' On this\r\npoint also we shall, I think, soon agree with Mr. Wilson. And if the\r\nPresident crowns his proposals with the idea of a universal _League of\r\nNations_ he will hardly meet with any opposition thereto on the part\r\nof the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.\r\n\r\n\"As will be seen from this comparison of my views with those of Mr.\r\nWilson, we are not only _agreed in essentials as to the great\r\nprinciples_ for rearrangement of the world after this war, but _our\r\nideas as to several concrete questions bearing on the peace are\r\nclosely allied_.\r\n\r\n\"The differences remaining do not appear to me so great but that a\r\ndiscussion of these points might lead to a clearer understanding and\r\nbring us closer still.\r\n\r\n\"The situation, then, seems to be this: Austria-Hungary on the one\r\nhand, and the United States of America on the other, are the two Great\r\nPowers in the hostile groups of states whose interests are least\r\nopposed one to the other. It seems reasonable, then, to suppose that\r\n_an exchange of opinion between these two Powers might form the\r\nnatural starting point for a conciliatory discussion_ between all\r\nthose states which have not yet entered upon peace negotiations.\r\n(_Applause._) So much for Wilson's proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Petersburg and the Ukraine=\r\n\r\n\"And now, gentlemen, I hasten to conclude. But this conclusion is\r\nperhaps the most important of all I have to say; I am endeavouring to\r\nbring about peace between the Ukraine and Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\"The conclusion of peace with Petersburg alters nothing in our\r\ndefinitive situation. Austro-Hungarian troops are nowhere opposed to\r\nthe Petersburg Government--we have the Ukrainian against us--and it is\r\nimpossible to export anything from Petersburg, since they have nothing\r\nthere themselves but _revolution and anarchy, goods which the\r\nBolshevists, no doubt, would be glad to export, but which I must\r\npolitely decline to receive_.\r\n\r\n\"In spite of this, I wish to make peace with Petersburg as well, since\r\nthis, like any other cessation of hostilities, brings us nearer to the\r\n_general peace_.\r\n\r\n\"It is otherwise with Ukraine. For the Ukraine has supplies of\r\nprovisions which they will export if we can agree on commercial terms.\r\nThe question of food is to-day a matter of anxiety throughout the\r\nworld; among our opponents, and also in the neutral countries, it is a\r\nburning question. I wish to profit by the conclusion of peace with\r\nthose Russian states which have food to export, in order to help our\r\nown population. _We could and would hold out without this assistance._\r\nBut I know my duty, and my duty bids me do all that can be done to\r\nlighten the burden of our suffering people, and I will not, therefore,\r\nfrom any hysterical nervousness about getting to final peace a few\r\ndays or a few weeks earlier, throw away this possible advantage to our\r\npeople. Such a peace takes time and cannot be concluded in a day. For\r\nsuch a peace must definitely state whether, what and how the Russian\r\nparty will deliver to us, for the reason that the Ukraine on its part\r\nwishes to close the business not after, but at the signing of peace.\r\n\r\n\"I have already mentioned that the unsettled conditions in this newly\r\nestablished state occasion great difficulty and naturally considerable\r\ndelay in the negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Appeal to the Country=\r\n\r\n\"_If you fall on me from behind, if you force me to come to terms at\r\nonce in headlong fashion, we shall gain no economic advantage at all_,\r\nand our people will then be forced to renounce the alleviation which\r\nthey should have gained from the peace.\r\n\r\n\"A surgeon conducting a difficult operation with a crowd behind him\r\nstanding watch in hand may very likely complete the operation in\r\nrecord time, but in all probability the patient would not thank him\r\nfor the manner in which it had been carried out.\r\n\r\n\"If you give our present opponents the impression that we must have\r\n_peace at once, and at any price_, we shall not get so much as a\r\nsingle measure of grain, and the result will be more or less platonic.\r\nIt is no longer by any means a question principally of terminating the\r\nwar on the Ukrainian front; neither we nor the Ukrainians themselves\r\nintend to continue the war now that we are agreed upon the\r\nno-annexation basis. It is a question--I repeat it once again--not of\r\n'imperialistic' annexation plans and ideas, but of securing for our\r\npopulation at last the merited reward of their endurance, and\r\nprocuring them those supplies of food for which they are waiting. Our\r\npartners in the deal are good business men and are closely watching to\r\nsee _whether you are forcing me to act or not_.\r\n\r\n\"_If you wish to ruin the peace_, if you are anxious to renounce the\r\nsupply of grain, then it would be logical enough to force my hand by\r\nspeeches and resolutions, strikes and demonstrations, but not\r\notherwise. And there is not an atom of truth in the idea that we are\r\nnow at such a pass that we must prefer a bad peace without economic\r\ngain rather than a good peace with economic advantages to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"The difficulties in the matter of food of late are not due solely to\r\nlack of actual provisions; it is the crises in coal, transport and\r\norganisation which are increasing. _When you at home get up strikes\r\nyou are moving in a vicious circle; the strikes increase and aggravate\r\nthe crises concerned and hinder the supplies of food and coal._ You\r\nare cutting your own throats in so doing, and all who believe that\r\npeace is accelerated thereby are terribly mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"It is believed that men in the country have been circulating rumours\r\nto the effect that the Government is instigating the strikes. I leave\r\nto these men themselves to choose whether they are to appear as\r\n_criminal slanderers or as fools_.\r\n\r\n\"If you had a Government desirous of concluding a peace different\r\nfrom that desired by the majority of the population, if you had a\r\nGovernment seeking to prolong the war for purposes of conquest, one\r\nmight understand a conflict between the Government and the country.\r\n_But since the Government desires precisely the same as the majority\r\nof the people--that is to say, the speedy settlement of an honourable\r\npeace without annexationist aims--then it is madness to attack that\r\nGovernment from behind, to interfere with its freedom of action and\r\nhamper its movements._ Those who do so are fighting, not against the\r\nGovernment, they are fighting blindly against the people they pretend\r\nto serve and against themselves.\r\n\r\n\"As for yourselves, gentlemen, it is not only your right, but your\r\nduty, to choose between the following alternatives: either you trust\r\nme to proceed with the peace negotiations, and in that case you must\r\nhelp me, or you do not trust me, and in that case you must depose me.\r\nI am confident that I have the support of the majority of the\r\nHungarian delegation. The Hungarian Committee has given me a vote of\r\nconfidence. If there is any doubt as to the same here, then the matter\r\nis clear enough. The question of a vote of confidence must be brought\r\nup and put to the vote; if I then have the majority against me I shall\r\nat once take the consequences. No one of those who are anxious to\r\nsecure my removal will be more pleased than myself; indeed far less\r\nso. Nothing induces me now to retain my office but the sense of duty,\r\nwhich constrains me to remain as long as I have the confidence of the\r\nEmperor and the majority of the delegations. A soldier with any sense\r\nof decency does not desert. But no Minister for Foreign Affairs could\r\nconduct negotiations of this importance unless he knows, and all the\r\nworld as well, that he is endowed with the confidence of the majority\r\namong the constitutional representative bodies. There can be no half\r\nmeasures here. You have this confidence or you have not. You must\r\nassist me or depose me; there is no other way. I have no more to say.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n=Report of the Peace Negotiations at Brest-Litovsk=\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian Government entered upon the peace negotiations at\r\nBrest-Litovsk with the object of arriving as quickly as possible at a\r\npeace compact which, if it did not, as we hoped, lead to a general\r\npeace, should at least secure order in the East. The draft of a\r\npreliminary peace was sent to Brest containing the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Cessation of hostilities; if general peace should not be\r\nconcluded, then neither of the present contracting parties to afford\r\nany support to the enemies of the other.\r\n\r\n2. No surrender of territory; Poland, Lithuania and Courland retaining\r\nthe right of determining their own destiny for the future.\r\n\r\n3. No indemnity for costs of war or damages due to military\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n4. Cessation of economic war and reparation of damages sustained by\r\nprivate persons through the economic war.\r\n\r\n5. Resumption of commercial intercourse and the same provisionally on\r\nthe basis of the old commercial treaty and twenty years' preference\r\nsubject to restriction in respect of any Customs union with\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n6. Mutual assistance in raw materials and industrial articles.\r\n\r\nA further point was contemplated, dealing with the evacuation of the\r\noccupied areas, but the formulation of this had to be postponed until\r\nafter consultation with the German Supreme Military Command, whose\r\nco-operation was here required owing to the mingling of German and\r\nAustro-Hungarian troops on the Russian front. The Army Command has\r\nindicated a period of at least six months as necessary for the\r\nevacuation.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this draft with the German delegates two points in\r\nparticular were found to present great difficulty. One was that of\r\nevacuation. The German Army Command declared categorically that no\r\nevacuation of the occupied districts could be thought of until after\r\nconclusion of the general peace. The second difficulty arose in\r\nconnection with the question as to treatment of the occupied\r\ndistricts. Germany insisted that in the peace treaty with Russia it\r\nshould be simply stated that Russia had conceded to the peoples within\r\nits territory the right of self-determination, and that the nations in\r\nquestion had already availed themselves of that right. The plain\r\nstandpoint laid down in our draft we were unable to carry through,\r\nalthough it was shared by the other Allies. However, in formulating\r\nthe answer sent on December 25, 1916, to the Russian peace proposals a\r\ncompromise was, after persistent efforts on our part, ultimately\r\narrived at which at least prevented the full adoption of the divergent\r\nGerman point of view on these two points. In the matter of evacuation\r\nthe Germans agreed that the withdrawal of certain bodies of troops\r\nbefore the general peace might be discussed.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of annexations a satisfactory manner of formulating this\r\nwas found, making it applicable only in the event of general peace.\r\nHad the Entente then been disposed to make peace the principle of \"no\r\nannexations\" would have succeeded throughout.\r\n\r\nEven allowing for the conciliatory form given through our endeavours\r\nto this answer by the four Powers to the Russian proposals, the German\r\nHeadquarters evinced extreme indignation. Several highly outspoken\r\ntelegrams from the German Supreme Command to the German delegates\r\nprove this. The head of the German Delegation came near to being\r\nrecalled on this account, and if this had been done it is likely that\r\nGerman foreign policy would have been placed in the hands of a firm\r\nadherent of the sternest military views. As this, however, could only\r\nhave had an unfavourable effect on the further progress of the\r\nnegotiations, we were obliged to do all in our power to retain Herr\r\nKühlmann. With this end in view he was informed and invited to advise\r\nBerlin that if Germany persisted in its harsh policy Austria-Hungary\r\nwould be compelled to conclude a separate peace with Russia. This\r\ndeclaration on the part of the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not\r\nfail to create a certain impression in Berlin, and was largely\r\nresponsible for the fact that Kühlmann was able to remain.\r\n\r\nKühlmann's difficult position and his desire to strengthen it rendered\r\nthe discussion of the territorial questions, which were first\r\nofficially touched upon on December 27, but had been already taken up\r\nin private meetings with the Russian delegates, a particularly awkward\r\nmatter. Germany insisted that the then Russian front was not to be\r\nevacuated until six months after the general peace. Russia was\r\ndisposed to agree to this, but demanded on the other hand that the\r\nfate of Poland was not to be decided until after evacuation. Against\r\nthis the Germans were inclined to give up its original standpoint to\r\nthe effect that the populations of occupied territories had already\r\navailed themselves of the right of self-determination conceded, and\r\nallow a new inquiry to be made among the population, but insisted that\r\nthis should be done during the occupation. No solution could be\r\narrived at on this point, though Austria-Hungary made repeated efforts\r\nat mediation. The negotiations had arrived at this stage when they\r\nwere first interrupted on December 29.\r\n\r\nOn resuming the negotiations on January 6 the situation was little\r\nchanged. Kühlmann's position was at any rate somewhat firmer than\r\nbefore, albeit only at the cost of some concessions to the German\r\nmilitary party. In these circumstances the negotiations, in which\r\nTrotski now took part as spokesman for the Russians, led only to\r\naltogether fruitless theoretical discussions and the right of\r\nself-determination, which could not bring about any lessening of the\r\ndistance between the two firmly maintained points of view. In order to\r\nget the proceedings out of this deadlock further endeavours were made\r\non the part of Austria to arrive at a compromise between the German\r\nand Russian standpoints, the more so as it was generally, and\r\nespecially in the case of Poland, desirable to solve the territorial\r\nquestion on the basis of complete self-determination. Our proposals to\r\nthe German delegates were to the effect that the Russian standpoint\r\nshould so far be met as to allow the plebiscite demanded by the\r\nRussians, this to be taken, as the Germans insisted should be the\r\ncase, during the German occupation, but with extensive guarantees for\r\nfree expression of the will of the people. On this point we had long\r\ndiscussions with the German delegates, based on detailed drafts\r\nprepared by us.\r\n\r\nOur endeavours here, however, were again unsuccessful. Circumstances\r\narising at the time in our own country were responsible for this, as\r\nalso for the result of the negotiations which had in the meantime been\r\ncommenced with the Ukrainian delegates. These last had, at the first\r\ndiscussion, declined to treat with any Polish representatives, and\r\ndemanded the concession of the entire Cholm territory, and, in a more\r\nguarded fashion, the cession of Eastern Galicia and the Ukrainian part\r\nof North-Eastern Hungary, and in consequence of which the negotiations\r\nwere on the point of being broken off. At this stage a food crisis\r\nbroke out in Austria to an extent of which the Ministry of Foreign\r\nAffairs was hitherto unaware, threatening Vienna in particular with\r\nthe danger of being in a few days devoid of flour altogether. Almost\r\nimmediately after this came a strike movement of threatening\r\nproportions. These events at home weakened the position of the Foreign\r\nMinister both as regards his attitude towards the German Allies and\r\ntowards the opposing parties in the negotiations--with both of which\r\nhe was then in conflict--and this, at a most critical moment, to a\r\ndegree that can hardly be appreciated from a distance. He was required\r\nto exert pressure upon Germany, and was now forced, not merely to ask,\r\nbut to entreat Germany's aid in sending supplies of food, or Vienna\r\nwould within a few days be in the throes of a catastrophe. With the\r\nenemy, on the other hand, he was forced, owing to the situation at\r\nhome, to strive for a settlement of peace that should be favourable to\r\nAustria, in spite of the fact that our food situation and our labour\r\ntroubles were well known to that enemy.\r\n\r\nThis complete alteration of the position changed the whole basis and\r\ntactics of the Foreign Minister's proceedings. He had to obtain the\r\nsupplies of grain asked for from Germany and thus to diminish\r\npolitical pressure on that country; but at the same time he had to\r\npersuade the Soviet delegates to continue negotiations, and finally to\r\narrive at a settlement of peace under the most acceptable conditions\r\npossible with the Ukraine, which would put an end to the still serious\r\ndifficulties of the food situation.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances it was impossible now to work on the German\r\ndelegates by talking of Austria-Hungary's concluding a separate peace\r\nwith Russia, as this would have imperilled the chance of food supplies\r\nfrom Germany--the more so as the representative of the German Army\r\nCommand had declared that it was immaterial whether Austria-Hungary\r\nmade peace or not. Germany would in any case march on Petersburg if\r\nthe Russian Government did not give way. On the other hand, however,\r\nthe Foreign Minister prevailed on the leader of the Russian delegation\r\nto postpone the carrying out of the intentions of his Government--to\r\nthe effect that the Russian delegation, owing to lack of good faith on\r\nthe part of German-Austro-Hungarian negotiators, should be recalled.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the negotiations with the Ukrainian delegation were\r\ncontinued. By means of lengthy and wearisome conferences we succeeded\r\nin bringing their demands to a footing which might just possibly be\r\nacceptable, and gaining their agreement to a clause whereby Ukraine\r\nundertook to deliver at least 1,000,000 tons of grain by August, 1918.\r\nAs to the demand for the Cholm territory, which we had wished to have\r\nrelegated to the negotiations with Poland, the Ukrainian delegates\r\nrefused to give way on this point, and were evidently supported by\r\nGeneral Hoffmann. Altogether the German military party seemed much\r\ninclined to support Ukrainian demands and extremely indisposed to\r\naccede to Polish claims, so that we were unable to obtain the\r\nadmission of Polish representatives to the proceedings, though we had\r\nfrequently asked for this. A further difficulty in the way of this was\r\nthe fact that Trotski himself was unwilling to recognise the Polish\r\nparty as having equal rights here. The only result obtainable was that\r\nthe Ukrainians should restrict their claims on the Cholm territory to\r\nthose parts inhabited by Ukrainian majority and accept a revision of\r\nthe frontier line, as yet only roughly laid down, according to the\r\nfinding of a mixed commission and the wishes of the population, i.e.\r\nthe principle of national boundaries under international protection.\r\nThe Ukrainian delegates renounced all territorial claims against the\r\nMonarchy, but demanded from us on the other hand a guarantee as to the\r\nautonomous development of their co-nationals in Galicia. With regard\r\nto these two weighty concessions, the Foreign Minister declared that\r\nthey could only be granted on the condition that the Ukraine fulfilled\r\nthe obligation it had undertaken as to delivery of grain, the\r\ndeliveries being made at the appointed times; he further demanded that\r\nthe obligations on both sides should be reciprocal, i.e. that the\r\nfailure of one party to comply therewith should release the other.\r\nThe formulation of these points, which met with the greatest\r\ndifficulties on the part of Ukraine, was postponed to a later date.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the proceedings a new pause occurred to give the\r\nseparate delegates time to advise their Governments as to the results\r\nhitherto attained and receive their final instructions. The Foreign\r\nMinister returned to Vienna and reported the state of the negotiations\r\nto the proper quarters. In the course of these deliberations his\r\npolicy of concluding peace with Russia and Ukraine on the basis of the\r\nconcessions proposed was agreed to. Another question dealt with at the\r\nsame time was whether the Monarchy should, in case of extreme\r\nnecessity, conclude a separate peace with Russia if the negotiations\r\nwith that state should threaten to come to nothing on account of\r\nGermany's demands. This question was, after full consideration of all\r\ngrounds to the contrary, answered _in thesi_ in the affirmative, as\r\nthe state of affairs at home apparently left no alternative.\r\n\r\nOn resuming the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk further endeavours were\r\nmade to persuade Germany to give way somewhat by pointing out what\r\nwould be the consequence of its obstinate attitude. In the course of\r\nthe deliberations on this point with Herr Kühlmann we succeeded after\r\ngreat difficulty in obtaining the agreement of the German delegates to\r\na final attempt at compromise, to be undertaken by the Foreign\r\nMinister. The proposals for this compromise were based on the\r\nfollowing considerations:\r\n\r\nFor months past conflicting views had been expressed as to:\r\n\r\n1. Whether in the territories where constitutional alterations were to\r\nbe made owing to the war the right of self-determination should be\r\ntaken as already exercised, or whether a plebiscite should be taken\r\nfirst;\r\n\r\n2. Whether such plebiscite, if taken, should be addressed to a\r\nconstituent body or in the form of a referendum to the people direct;\r\n\r\n3. Whether this should be done before or after evacuation; and\r\n\r\n4. In what manner it was to be organised (by general franchise, by a\r\nvote of the nobles, etc.). It would be advisable, and would also be in\r\naccordance with the principles adopted by Russia, to leave the\r\ndecision on all these points to the people themselves, and deliver\r\nthem over to the \"temporary self-administrative body,\" which should,\r\nalso according to the Russian proposal (Kameneff), be introduced at\r\nonce. The whole of the peace negotiations could then be concentrated\r\nupon a single point: the question as to the composition of this\r\ntemporary body. Here, however, a compromise could be arrived at, as\r\nRussia could agree that the already existent bodies set in the\r\nforeground by Germany should be allowed to express a part of the will\r\nof the people, Germany agreeing that these bodies should, during the\r\noccupation, be supplemented by elements appointed, according to the\r\nRussian principles, by free election.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, immediately after Herr Kühlmann had agreed to mediation\r\non this basis, the Foreign Minister saw the leader of the Russian\r\ndelegation, Trotski, and had a series of conversations with him. The\r\nidea of compromise on the lines just set forth was little to Trotski's\r\ntaste, and he declared that he would in any case protest against the\r\nhandling of the self-determination question by the Four Powers. On the\r\nother hand, the discussion did lead to some result, in that a new\r\nbasis for disposing of the difficulties which had arisen was now\r\nfound. There was to be no further continuance of the conflict as to\r\nwhether the territorial alterations involved by the peace should be\r\ntermed \"annexations,\" as the Russian delegates wished, or \"exercise of\r\nthe right of self-determination,\" as Germany wished; the territorial\r\nalterations were to be simply noted in the peace treaty (\"Russia notes\r\nthat ...\"). Trotski, however, made his acquiescence to the conclusion\r\nof such a compact subject to two conditions: one being that the Moon\r\nSound Islands and the Baltic ports should remain with Russia; the\r\nother that Germany and Austria-Hungary should not conclude any\r\nseparate peace with the Ukrainian People's Republic, whose Government\r\nwas then seriously threatened by the Bolsheviks and, according to some\r\nreports, already overthrown by them. The Foreign Minister was now\r\nanxious to arrive at a compromise on this question also, in which he\r\nhad to a certain degree the support of Herr von Kühlmann, while\r\nGeneral Hoffmann most vehemently opposed any further concession.\r\n\r\nAll these negotiations for a compromise failed to achieve their end\r\nowing to the fact that Herr Kühlmann was forced by the German Supreme\r\nArmy Command to act promptly. Ludendorff declared that the\r\nnegotiations with Russia must be concluded within three days, and when\r\na telegram from Petersburg was picked up in Berlin calling on the\r\nGerman Army to rise in revolt Herr von Kühlmann was strictly ordered\r\nnot to be content with the cessions already agreed to, but to demand\r\nthe further cession of the unoccupied territories of Livonia and\r\nEsthonia. Under such pressure the leader of the German delegation had\r\nnot the power to compromise. We then arrived at the signing of the\r\ntreaty with Ukraine, which had, after much trouble, been brought to an\r\nend meanwhile. It thus appeared as if the efforts of the Foreign\r\nMinister had proved fruitless. Nevertheless he continued his\r\ndiscussions with Trotski, but these still led to no result, owing to\r\nthe fact that Trotski, despite repeated questioning, persisted in\r\nleaving everything vague till the last moment as to whether he would,\r\nin the present circumstances, conclude any peace with the Four Powers\r\nat all or not. Not until the plenary session of February 10 was this\r\ncleared up; Russia declared for a cessation of hostilities, but signed\r\nno treaty of peace.\r\n\r\nThe situation created by this declaration offered no occasion for\r\nfurther taking up the idea of a separate peace with Russia, since\r\npeace seemed to have come _via facta_ already. At a meeting on\r\nFebruary 10 of the diplomatic and military delegates of Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary to discuss the question of what was now to be done it\r\nwas agreed unanimously, save for a single dissentient, that the\r\nsituation arising out of Trotski's declarations must be accepted. The\r\none dissentient vote--that of General Hoffmann--was to the effect that\r\nTrotski's statement should be answered by declaring the Armistice at\r\nan end, marching on Petersburg, and supporting the Ukraine openly\r\nagainst Russia. In the ceremonial final sitting, on February 11, Herr\r\nvon Kühlmann adopted the attitude expressed by the majority of the\r\npeace delegations, and set forth the same in a most impressive speech.\r\nNevertheless, a few days later, as General Hoffmann had said, Germany\r\ndeclared the Armistice at an end, ordered the German troops to march\r\non Petersburg, and brought about the situation which led to the\r\nsigning of the peace treaty. Austria-Hungary declared that we took no\r\npart in this action.\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n=Report of the Peace Negotiations at Bucharest=\r\n\r\nThe possibility of entering upon peace negotiations with Roumania was\r\nconsidered as soon as negotiations with the Russian delegations at\r\nBrest-Litovsk had commenced. In order to prevent Roumania itself from\r\ntaking part in these negotiations Germany gave the Roumanian\r\nGovernment to understand that it would not treat with the present King\r\nand the present Government at all. This step, however, was only\r\nintended to enable separate negotiations to be entered upon with\r\nRoumania, as Germany feared that the participation of Roumania in the\r\nBrest negotiations would imperil the chances of peace. Roumania's idea\r\nseemed then to be to carry on the war and gain the upper hand. At the\r\nend of January, therefore, Austria-Hungary took the initiative in\r\norder to bring about negotiations with Roumania. The Emperor sent\r\nColonel Randa, the former Military Attaché to the Roumanian\r\nGovernment, to the King of Roumania, assuring him of his willingness\r\nto grant Roumania honourable terms of peace.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the peace negotiations a demand was raised in\r\nHungarian quarters for a rectification of the frontier line, so as to\r\nprevent, or at any rate render difficult, any repetition of the\r\ninvasion by Roumania in 1916 over the Siebenbürgen, despite opposition\r\non the part of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The strategical\r\nfrontier drawn up by the Army Command, which, by the way, was\r\ninfluenced by considerations not conducive to peace, followed a line\r\ninvolving the cession to Hungary of Turnu-Severin, Sinaia and several\r\nvaluable petroleum districts in Moldavia. Public opinion in Hungary\r\nvoiced even further demands. The Hungarian Government was of opinion\r\nthat the Parliament would offer the greatest hindrances to any peace\r\nnot complying with the general desire in this respect, and leading\r\nHungarian statesmen, even some among the Opposition parties, declared\r\nthe rectification of the frontier to be a condition of peace _sine qua\r\nnon_. Wekerle and Tisza in particular took this view. Despite this\r\nserious difference of opinion, the Foreign Minister, in entire\r\nagreement with the Emperor, even before the commencement of the\r\nnegotiations in the middle of February, took up the position that\r\ndemands connected with the frontier line should not offer any obstacle\r\nto the conclusion of peace. The rectification of the frontier should\r\nonly seriously be insisted on as far as could be done on the basis of\r\na loyal and, for the future, amicable relations with Roumania. Hungary\r\nregarded this lenient attitude on the part of the Foreign Minister\r\nwith increasing disapproval. We pointed out that a frontier line\r\nconceding cities and petroleum districts to Hungary would be\r\nunfortunate in every respect. From the point of view of internal\r\npolitics, because the number of non-Hungarian inhabitants would be\r\nthereby increased; from the military point of view, because it would\r\ngive rise to frontier conflicts with unreliable Roumanian factions;\r\nand, finally, from the point of view of foreign policy, because it\r\nwould mean annexations and the transference of population this way and\r\nthat, rendering friendly relations with Roumania an impossibility.\r\nNevertheless, it would be necessary for a time to hold fast by the\r\nfrontier line as originally conceived, so that the point could be used\r\nto bring about the establishment in Roumania of a régime amicably\r\ndisposed toward the Central Powers. The Foreign Minister was\r\nparticularly anxious to see a Marghiloman Cabinet formed, inaugurating\r\na policy friendly to ourselves. He believed that with such a Cabinet\r\nit would be easier to arrive at a peace of mutual understanding, and\r\nwas also resolved to render possible such a peace by extensive\r\nconcessions, especially by giving his diplomatic support in the\r\nBessarabian question. He informed Marghiloman also in writing that he\r\nwould be prepared to grant important concessions to a Cabinet of which\r\nhe, Marghiloman, was the head, in particular as regards the cession of\r\ninhabited places such as Turnu-Severin and Ocna, on which points he\r\nwas willing to give way. When the Marghiloman Cabinet was formed the\r\nAustro-Hungarian demands in respect of the frontier line would,\r\ndespite active opposition on the part of the Hungarian Government, be\r\nreduced almost by half. The negotiations with Roumania were\r\nparticularly difficult in regard to the question of two places, Azuga\r\nand Busteni. On March 24 Count Czernin prepared to terminate these\r\nnegotiations, declaring that he was ready to renounce all claim to\r\nAzuga and Busteni and halve his demands as to the much-debated Lotru\r\ndistrict, provided Marghiloman were willing to arrange the frontier\r\nquestion on this basis. Marghiloman declared himself satisfied with\r\nthis compromise. On the next day, however, it was nevertheless\r\nrejected by the Hungarian Government, and not until after further\r\ntelegraphic communication with the Emperor and Wekerle was the assent\r\nof all competent authorities obtained. This had, indeed, been widely\r\nconsidered in Hungarian circles as an impossibility.\r\n\r\nAnother Austro-Hungarian demand which played some part in the\r\nBucharest negotiations was in connection with the plan of an\r\neconomical alliance between Austria-Hungary and Roumania. This was of\r\nespecial interest to the Austrian Government, whereas the frontier\r\nquestion, albeit in some degree affecting Austria as well, was a\r\nmatter of indifference to this Government, which, as a matter of fact,\r\ndid not sympathise with the demands at all. The plan for an economical\r\nalliance, however, met with opposition in Hungary. Immediately before\r\nthe commencement of the Bucharest negotiations an attempt was made to\r\novercome this opposition on the part of the Hungarian Government and\r\nsecure its adherence to the idea of an economical alliance with\r\nRoumania--at any rate, conditionally upon the conclusion of a customs\r\nalliance with Germany as planned. It proved impossible, however, at\r\nthe time to obtain this assent. The Hungarian Government reserved the\r\nright of considering the question later on, and on March 8 instructed\r\ntheir representatives at Bucharest that they must dissent from the\r\nplan, as the future economical alliance with Germany was a matter\r\nbeyond present consideration. Consequently this question could play no\r\npart at first in the peace negotiations, and all that could be done\r\nwas to sound the leading Roumanian personages in a purely private\r\nmanner as to the attitude they would adopt towards such a proposal.\r\nThe idea was, generally speaking, well received by Roumania, and the\r\nprevalent opinion was that such an alliance would be distinctly\r\nadvisable from Roumania's point of view. A further attempt was\r\ntherefore made, during the pause in the peace negotiations in the\r\nEast, to overcome the opposition of the Hungarian Government; these\r\ndeliberations were, however, not concluded when the Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs resigned his office.\r\n\r\nGermany had, even before the commencement of negotiations in\r\nBucharest, considered the question of imposing on Roumania, when\r\ntreating for peace, a series of obligations especially in connection\r\nwith the economical relations amounting to a kind of indirect war\r\nindemnity. It was also contemplated that the occupation of Wallachia\r\nshould be maintained for five or six years after the conclusion of\r\npeace. Roumania should then give up its petroleum districts, its\r\nrailways, harbours and domains to German companies as their property,\r\nand submit itself to a permanent financial control. Austria-Hungary\r\nopposed these demands from the first on the grounds that no friendly\r\nrelations could ever be expected to exist with a Roumania which had\r\nbeen economically plundered to such a complete extent; and\r\nAustria-Hungary was obliged to maintain amicable relations with\r\nRoumania.\r\n\r\nThis standpoint was most emphatically set forth, and not without some\r\nsuccess, on February 5 at a conference with the Reichskansler. In the\r\nmiddle of February the Emperor sent a personal message to the German\r\nEmperor cautioning him against this plan, which might prove an obstacle\r\nin the way of peace. Roumania was not advised of these demands until\r\ncomparatively late in the negotiations, after the appointment of\r\nMarghiloman. Until then the questions involved gave rise to constant\r\ndiscussion between Germany and Austria-Hungary, the latter throughout\r\nendeavouring to reduce the German demands, not only with a view to\r\narriving at a peace of mutual understanding, but also because, if\r\nGermany gained a footing in Roumania on the terms originally\r\ncontemplated, Austro-Hungarian economical interests must inevitably\r\nsuffer thereby. The demands originally formulated with regard to the\r\nRoumanian railways and domains were then relinquished by Germany, and\r\nthe plan of a cession of the Roumanian harbours was altered so as to\r\namount to the establishment of a Roumanian-German-Austro-Hungarian\r\nharbour company, which, however, eventually came to nothing. The\r\npetroleum question, too, was reduced from a cession to a ninety years'\r\ntenure of the state petroleum districts and the formation of a\r\nmonopoly trading company for petroleum under German management.\r\nFinally, an economic arrangement was prepared which should secure the\r\nagricultural products of Roumania to the Central Powers for a series of\r\nyears. The idea of a permanent German control of the Roumanian finances\r\nwas also relinquished owing to Austro-Hungarian opposition. The\r\nnegotiations with Marghiloman and his representatives on these\r\nquestions made a very lengthy business. In the economic questions\r\nespecially there was great difference of opinion on the subject of\r\nprices, which was not disposed of until the last moment before the\r\ndrawing up of the treaty on March 28, and then only by adopting the\r\nRoumanian standpoint. On the petroleum question, where the differences\r\nwere particularly acute, agreement was finally arrived at, in face of\r\nthe extreme views of the German economical representative on the one\r\nhand and the Roumanian Foreign Minister, Arion, on the other, by a\r\ncompromise, according to which further negotiations were to be held in\r\nparticular with regard to the trade monopoly for petroleum, and the\r\noriginal draft was only to apply when such negotiations failed to lead\r\nto any result.\r\n\r\nThe German demands as to extension of the period of occupation for\r\nfive to six years after the general peace likewise played a great part\r\nat several stages of the negotiations, and were from the first stoutly\r\nopposed by Austria-Hungary. We endeavoured to bring about an\r\narrangement by which, on the conclusion of peace, Roumania should have\r\nall legislative and executive power restored, being subject only to a\r\ncertain right of control in respect of a limited number of points, but\r\nnot beyond the general peace. In support of this proposal the Foreign\r\nMinister pointed out in particular that the establishment of a\r\nRoumanian Ministry amicably disposed towards ourselves would be an\r\nimpossibility (the Averescu Ministry was then still in power) if we\r\nwere to hold Roumania permanently under our yoke. We should far rather\r\nuse every endeavour to obtain what could be obtained from Roumania\r\nthrough the medium of such politicians in that country as were\r\ndisposed to follow a policy of friendly relations with the Central\r\nPowers. The main object of our policy to get such men into power in\r\nRoumania, and enable them to remain in the Government, would be\r\nrendered unattainable if too severe measures were adopted. We might\r\ngain something thereby for a few years, but it would mean losing\r\neverything in the future. And we succeeded also in convincing the\r\nGerman Secretary of State, Kühlmann, of the inadvisability of the\r\ndemands in respect of occupation, which were particularly voiced by\r\nthe German Army Council. As a matter of fact, after the retirement of\r\nAverescu, Marghiloman declared that these demands would make it\r\nimpossible for him to form a Cabinet at all. And when he had been\r\ninformed, from German sources, that the German Supreme Army Command\r\ninsisted on these terms, he only agreed to form a Cabinet on the\r\nassurance of the Austrian Foreign Minister that a solution of the\r\noccupation problem would be found. In this question also we did\r\nultimately succeed in coming to agreement with Roumania.\r\n\r\nOne of the decisive points in the conclusion of peace with Roumania\r\nwas, finally, the cession of the Dobrudsha, on which Bulgaria insisted\r\nwith such violence that it was impossible to avoid it. The ultimatum\r\nwhich preceded the preliminary Treaty of Buftea had also to be altered\r\nchiefly on the Dobrudsha question, as Bulgaria was already talking of\r\nthe ingratitude of the Central Powers, of how Bulgaria had been\r\ndisillusioned, and of the evil effects this disillusionment would have\r\non the subsequent conduct of the war. All that Count Czernin could do\r\nwas to obtain a guarantee that Roumania, in case of cession of the\r\nDobrudsha, should at least be granted a sure way to the harbour of\r\nKustendje. In the main the Dobrudsha question was decided at Buftea.\r\nWhen, later, Bulgaria expressed a desire to interpret the wording of\r\nthe preliminary treaty by which the Dobrudsha \"as far as the Danube\"\r\nwas to be given up in such a sense as to embrace the whole of the\r\nterritory up to the northernmost branch (the Kilia branch) of the\r\nDanube, this demand was most emphatically opposed both by Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary, and it was distinctly laid down in the peace treaty\r\nthat only the Dobrudsha as far as the St. George's branch was to be\r\nceded. This decision again led to bad feeling in Bulgaria, but was\r\nunavoidable, as further demands here would probably have upset the\r\npreliminary peace again.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings had reached this stage when Count Czernin resigned his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n=Wilson's Fourteen Points=\r\n\r\nI. Open covenants of peace openly arrived at, after which there shall\r\nbe no private international understandings of any kind, but diplomacy\r\nshall proceed always frankly and in the public view.\r\n\r\nII. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas outside territorial\r\nwaters alike in peace and in war except as the seas may be closed in\r\nwhole or in part by international action for the enforcement of\r\ninternational covenants.\r\n\r\nIII. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the\r\nestablishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations\r\nconsenting to the peace and associating themselves for its\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nIV. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will\r\nbe reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\r\n\r\nV. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all\r\ncolonial claims based upon a strict observance of the principle that\r\nin determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the\r\npopulations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims\r\nof the Government whose title is to be determined.\r\n\r\nVI. The evacuation of all Russian territory, and such a settlement of\r\nall questions affecting Russia as will secure the best and freest\r\nco-operation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an\r\nunhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent\r\ndetermination of her own political development and national policy,\r\nand assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations\r\nunder institutions of her own choosing; and more than a welcome\r\nassistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself\r\ndesire. The treatment accorded Russia by her sister nations in the\r\nmonths to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their\r\ncomprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests,\r\nand of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy.\r\n\r\nVII. Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and\r\nrestored without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys\r\nin common with all other free nations. No other single act will serve\r\nas this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws\r\nwhich they have themselves set and determined for the government of\r\ntheir relations with one another. Without this healing act the whole\r\nstructure and validity of international law is for ever impaired.\r\n\r\nVIII. All French territory should be freed, and the invaded portions\r\nrestored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the\r\nmatter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world\r\nfor nearly 50 years, should be righted in order that peace may once\r\nmore be made secure in the interests of all.\r\n\r\nIX. A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along\r\nclearly recognisable lines of nationality.\r\n\r\nX. The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place among the nations we\r\nwish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the first\r\nopportunity of autonomous development.\r\n\r\nXI. Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be evacuated, occupied\r\nterritories restored, Serbia accorded free and secure access to the\r\nsea, and the relations of the several Balkan States to one another\r\ndetermined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of\r\nallegiance and nationality, and international guarantees of the\r\npolitical and economic independence and territorial integrity of the\r\nseveral Balkan States should be entered into.\r\n\r\nXII. The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be\r\nassured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are\r\nnow under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life\r\nand an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development,\r\nand the Dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to\r\nthe ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees.\r\n\r\nXIII. An independent Polish State should be erected which should\r\ninclude the territories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations,\r\nwhich should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose\r\npolitical and economic independence and territorial integrity should\r\nbe guaranteed by international covenant.\r\n\r\nXIV. A general association of nations must be formed under specific\r\ncovenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political\r\nindependence and territorial integrity to great and small States\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n=Ottokar Czernin on Austria's Policy During the War=\r\n\r\n_Speech delivered December 11, 1918_\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--In rising now to speak of our policy during the war it is\r\nmy hope that I may thereby help to bring the truth to light. We are\r\nliving in a time of excitement. After four years of war, the bloodiest\r\nand most determined war the world has ever seen, and in the midst of\r\nthe greatest revolution ever known, this excitement is only too easily\r\nunderstood. But the result of this excitement is that all those rumours\r\nwhich go flying about, mingling truth and falsehood together, end by\r\nmisleading the public. It is unquestionably necessary to arrive at a\r\nclear understanding. The public has a right to know what has really\r\nhappened, it has the right to know why we did not succeed in attaining\r\nthe peace we had so longed for, it has a right to know whether, and if\r\nso where, any neglect can be pointed out, or whether it was the\r\noverwhelming power of circumstances which has led our policy to take\r\nthe course it did. The new arrangement of relations between ourselves\r\nand Germany will make an end of all secret proceedings. The day will\r\ncome then when, fortunately, all that has hitherto been hidden will be\r\nmade clear. As, however, I do not know when all this will be made\r\npublic, I am grateful for the opportunity of lifting the veil to-day\r\nfrom certain hitherto unknown events. In treating of this theme I will\r\nrefrain from touching upon those constitutional factors which once\r\ncounted for so much, but which do so no longer. I do so because it\r\nseems to me unfair to import into the discussion persons who are now\r\npaying heavily for what they may have done and who are unable to defend\r\nthemselves. And I must pay this honourable tribute to the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Press, that it has on the whole sought to spare the\r\nformer Emperor as far as possible. There are, of course,\r\nexceptions--_exceptiones firmant regulam_. There are in Vienna, as\r\neverywhere else, men who find it more agreeable to attack, the less if\r\nthose whom they are attacking are able to defend themselves. But,\r\nbelieve me, gentlemen, those who think thus are not the bravest, not\r\nthe best, nor the most reliable; and we may be glad that they form so\r\ninsignificant a minority.\r\n\r\nBut, to come to the point. Before passing on to a consideration of the\r\nvarious phases of the work for peace, I should like to point out two\r\nthings: firstly, that since the entry of Italy and Roumania into the\r\nwar, and especially since the entry of America, a \"victorious peace\"\r\non our part has been a Utopian idea, a Utopia which, unfortunately,\r\nwas throughout cherished by the German military party; and, secondly,\r\nthat we have never received any offer of peace from the Entente. On\r\nseveral occasions peace feelers were put forward between\r\nrepresentatives of the Entente and our own; unfortunately, however,\r\nthese never led to any concrete conditions. We often had the\r\nimpression that we might conclude a separate peace without Germany,\r\nbut we were never told the concrete conditions upon which Germany, on\r\nits part, could make peace; and, in particular, we were never informed\r\nthat Germany would be allowed to retain its possessions as before the\r\nwar, in consequence of which we were left in the position of having to\r\nfight a war of defence for Germany. We were compelled by our treaty to\r\na common defence of the pre-war possessions, and since the Entente\r\nnever declared its willingness to treat with a Germany which wished\r\nfor no annexations, since the Entente constantly declared its\r\nintention of annihilating Germany, we were forced to defend Germany,\r\nand our position in Berlin was rendered unspeakably more difficult.\r\nWe ourselves, also, were never given any assurance that we should be\r\nallowed to retain our former possessions; but in our case the desire\r\nfor peace was so strong that we would have made territorial\r\nconcessions if we had been able thereby to secure general peace. This,\r\nhowever, was not the case. Take Italy, for instance, which was\r\nprimarily at war with ourselves and not with Germany. If we had\r\noffered Italy concessions however great, if we had offered all that\r\nItaly has now taken possession of, even then it could not have made\r\npeace, being bound by duty to its Allies and by circumstances not to\r\nmake peace until England and France made peace with Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen, then, peace by sacrifice was the only peace attainable,\r\nobviously, as a matter of principle, there were two ways of reaching\r\nthat end. One, a general peace, i.e. including Germany, and the other,\r\na separate peace. Of the overwhelming difficulties attending the\r\nformer course I will speak later; at present a few words on the\r\nquestion of separate peace.\r\n\r\nI myself would never have made a separate peace. I have never, not\r\neven in the hour of disillusionment--I may say of despair at my\r\ninability to lead the policy of Berlin into wiser channels--even in\r\nsuch hours, I say, I have never forgotten that our alliance with the\r\nGerman Empire was no ordinary alliance, no such alliance as may be\r\ncontracted by two Emperors or two Governments, and can easily be\r\nbroken, but an alliance of blood, a blood-brotherhood between the ten\r\nmillion Austro-Germans and the seventy million of the Empire, which\r\ncould not be broken. And I have never forgotten that the military\r\nparty in power at that time in Germany were not the German people, and\r\nthat we had allied ourselves with the German people, and not with a\r\nfew leading men. But I will not deny that in the moments when I saw my\r\npolicy could not be realised I did ventilate the idea of suggesting to\r\nthe Emperor the appointment, in my stead, of one of those men who saw\r\nsalvation in a separation from Germany. But again and again I\r\nrelinquished this idea, being firmly convinced that separate peace was\r\na sheer impossibility. The Monarchy lay like a great block between\r\nGermany and the Balkans. Germany had great masses of troops there from\r\nwhich it could not be cut off, it was procuring oil and grain from the\r\nBalkans; if we were to interpose between it and the Balkans we should\r\nbe striking at its most sensitive vital nerve. Moreover, the Entente\r\nwould naturally have demanded first of all that we joined in the\r\nblockade, and finally our secession would automatically have involved\r\nalso that of Bulgaria and Turkey. Had we withdrawn, Germany would have\r\nbeen unable to carry on the war. In such a situation there can be no\r\npossibility of doubt but that the German Army Command would have flung\r\nseveral divisions against Bohemia and the Tyrol, meting out to us the\r\nsame fate which had previously befallen Roumania. The Monarchy,\r\nBohemia in particular, would at once have become a scene of war. But\r\neven this is not all. Internally, such a step would at once have led\r\nto civil war. The Germans of Austria would never have turned against\r\ntheir brothers, and the Hungarians--Tisza's Hungarians--would never\r\nhave lent their aid to such a policy. _We had begun the war in common,\r\nand we could not end it save in common._ For us there was no way out\r\nof the war; we could only choose between fighting with Germany against\r\nthe Entente, or fighting with the Entente against Germany until\r\nGermany herself gave way. A slight foretaste of what would have\r\nhappened was given us through the separatist steps taken by Andrassy\r\nat the last moment. This utterly defeated, already annihilated and\r\nprostrate Germany had yet the power to fling troops toward the Tyrol,\r\nand had not the revolution overwhelmed all Germany like a\r\nconflagration, smothering the war itself, I am not sure but that the\r\nTyrol might at the last moment have been harried by war. And,\r\ngentlemen, I have more to say. The experiment of separate peace would\r\nnot only have involved us in a civil war, not only brought the war\r\ninto our own country, but even then the final outcome would have been\r\nmuch the same. The dissolution of the Monarchy into its component\r\nnational parts was postulated throughout by the Entente. I need only\r\nrefer to the Conference of London. But whether the State be dissolved\r\nby way of reward to the people or by way of punishment to the State\r\nmakes little difference; the effect is the same. In this case also a\r\n\"German Austria\" would have arisen, and in such a development it would\r\nhave been hard for the German-Austrian people to take up an attitude\r\nwhich rendered them allies of the Entente. In my own case, as Minister\r\nof the Imperial and Royal Government, it was my duty also to consider\r\ndynastic interests, and I never lost sight of that obligation. But I\r\nbelieve that in this respect also the end would have been the same. In\r\nparticular the dissolution of the Monarchy into its national elements\r\nby legal means, against the opposition of the Germans and Hungarians,\r\nwould have been a complete impossibility. And the Germans in Austria\r\nwould never have forgiven the Crown if it had entered upon a war with\r\nGermany; the Emperor would have been constantly encountering the\r\npowerful Republican tendencies of the Czechs, and he would have been\r\nin constant conflict with the King of Serbia over the South-Slav\r\nquestion, an ally being naturally nearer to the Entente than the\r\nHabsburgers. And, finally, the Hungarians would never have forgiven\r\nthe Emperor if he had freely conceded extensive territories to Bohemia\r\nand to the South-Slav state; I believe, then, that in this confusion\r\nthe Crown would have fallen, as it has done in fact. _A separate peace\r\nwas a sheer impossibility._ There remained the second way: to make\r\npeace jointly with Germany. Before going into the difficulties which\r\nrendered this way impossible I must briefly point out wherein lay our\r\ngreat dependence upon Germany. First of all, in military respects.\r\nAgain and again we were forced to rely on aid from Germany. In\r\nRoumania, in Italy, in Serbia, and in Russia we were victorious with\r\nthe Germans beside us. We were in the position of a poor relation\r\nliving by the grace of a rich kinsman. But it is impossible to play\r\nthe mendicant and the political adviser at the same time, particularly\r\nwhen the other party is a Prussian officer. In the second place, we\r\nwere dependent upon Germany owing to the state of our food supply.\r\nAgain and again we were here also forced to beg for help from Germany,\r\nbecause the complete disorganisation of our own administration had\r\nbrought us to the most desperate straits. We were forced to this by\r\nthe hunger blockade established, on the one hand, by Hungary, and on\r\nthe other by the official authorities and their central depots. I\r\nremember how, when I myself was in the midst of a violent conflict\r\nwith the German delegates at Brest-Litovsk, I received orders from\r\nVienna to bow the knee to Berlin and beg for food. You can imagine,\r\ngentlemen, for yourselves how such a state of things must weaken a\r\nMinister's hands. And, thirdly, our dependence was due to the state of\r\nour finances. In order to keep up our credit we were drawing a hundred\r\nmillion marks a month from Germany, a sum which during the course of\r\nthe war has grown to over four milliards; and this money was as\r\nurgently needed as were the German divisions and the German bread.\r\nAnd, despite this position of dependence, the only way to arrive at\r\npeace was by leading Germany into our own political course; that is to\r\nsay, persuading Germany to conclude a peace involving sacrifice. _The\r\nsituation all through was simply this: that any momentary military\r\nsuccess might enable us to propose terms of peace which, while\r\nentailing considerable loss to ourselves, had just a chance of being\r\naccepted by the enemy._ The German military party, on the other hand,\r\nincreased their demands with every victory, and it was more hopeless\r\nthan ever, after their great successes, to persuade them to adopt a\r\npolicy of renunciation. I think, by the way, that there was a single\r\nmoment in the history of this war when such an action would have had\r\nsome prospect of success. I refer to the famous battle of Görlitz.\r\nThen, with the Russian army in flight, the Russian forts falling like\r\nhouses of cards, many among our enemies changed their point of view.\r\nI was at that time still our representative in Roumania. Majorescu was\r\nthen not disinclined to side with us actively, and the Roumanian army\r\nmoved forward toward Bessarabia, could have been hot on the heels of\r\nthe flying Russians, and might, according to all human calculations,\r\nhave brought about a complete débâcle. It is not unlikely that the\r\ncollapse which later took place in Russia might have come about then,\r\nand after a success of that nature, with no \"America\" as yet on the\r\nhorizon, we might perhaps have brought the war to an end. Two things,\r\nhowever, were required: in the first place, the Roumanians demanded,\r\nas the price of their co-operation, a rectification of the Hungarian\r\nfrontier, and this first condition was flatly refused by Hungary; the\r\nsecond condition, which naturally then did not come into question at\r\nall, would have been that we should even then, after such a success,\r\nhave proved strong enough to bear a peace with sacrifice. We were not\r\ncalled upon to agree to this, but the second requirement would\r\nundoubtedly have been refused by Germany, just as the first had been\r\nby Hungary. I do not positively assert that peace would have been\r\npossible in this or any other case, but I do positively maintain that\r\nduring my period of office _such a peace by sacrifice was the utmost\r\nwe and Germany could have attained_. The future will show what\r\nsuperhuman efforts we have made to induce Germany to give way. That\r\nall proved fruitless was not the fault of the German people, nor was\r\nit, in my opinion, the fault of the German Emperor, but that of the\r\nleaders of the German military party, which had attained such enormous\r\npower in the country. Everyone in Wilhelmstrasse, from Bethmann to\r\nKühlmann, wanted peace; but they could not get it simply because the\r\nmilitary party got rid of everyone who ventured to act otherwise than\r\nas they wished. This also applies to Bethmann and Kühlmann. The\r\nPan-Germanists, under the leadership of the military party, could not\r\nunderstand that it was possible to die through being victorious, that\r\nvictories are worthless when they do not lead to peace, that\r\nterritories held in an iron grasp as \"security\" are valueless\r\nsecurities as long as the opposing party cannot be forced to redeem\r\nthem. There were various shades of this Pan-Germanism. One section\r\ndemanded the annexation of parts of Belgium and France, with an\r\nindemnity of milliards; others were less exorbitant, but all were\r\nagreed that peace could only be concluded with an extension of German\r\npossessions. It was the easiest thing in the world to get on well with\r\nthe German military party so long as one believed in their fantastic\r\nideas and took a victorious peace for granted, dividing up the world\r\nthereafter at will. But if anyone attempted to look at things from\r\nthe point of view of the real situation, and ventured to reckon with\r\nthe possibility of a less satisfactory termination of the war, the\r\nobstacles then encountered were not easily surmounted. We all of us\r\nremember those speeches in which constant reference was always made to\r\na \"stern peace,\" a \"German peace,\" a \"victorious peace.\" For us, then,\r\nthe possibility of a more favourable peace--I mean a peace based on\r\nmutual understanding--I have never believed in the possibility of a\r\nvictorious peace--would only have been acute in the case of Poland and\r\nthe Austro-Polish question. But I cannot sufficiently emphasise the\r\nfact that the Austro-Polish solution never was an obstacle in the way\r\nof peace and could never have been so. There was only the idea that\r\nAustrian Poland and the former Russian Poland might be united and\r\nattached to the Monarchy. It was never suggested that such a step\r\nshould be enforced against the will of Poland itself or against the\r\nwill of the Entente. There was a time when it looked as if not only\r\nPoland but also certain sections among the Entente were not\r\ndisinclined to agree to such a solution.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the German military party. This had attained a degree\r\nof power in the State rarely equalled in history, and the rarity of\r\nthe phenomenon was only exceeded by the suddenness of its terrible\r\ncollapse. The most striking personality in this group was General\r\nLudendorff. Ludendorff was a great man, a man of genius, in\r\nconception, a man of indomitable energy and great gifts. But this man\r\nrequired a political brake, so to speak, a political element in the\r\nWilhelmstrasse capable of balancing his influence, and this was never\r\nfound. It must fairly be admitted that the German generals achieved\r\nthe gigantic, and there was a time when they were looked up to by the\r\npeople almost as gods. It may be true that all great strategists are\r\nmuch alike; they look to victory always and to nothing else. Moltke\r\nhimself, perhaps, was nothing more, but he had a Bismarck to maintain\r\nequilibrium. We had no such Bismarck, and when all is said and done it\r\nwas not the fault of Ludendorff, or it is at any rate an excuse for\r\nhim, that he was the only supremely powerful character in the whole of\r\nGermany, and that in consequence the entire policy of the country was\r\ndirected into military channels. Ludendorff was a great patriot,\r\ndesiring nothing for himself, but seeking only the happiness of his\r\ncountry; a military genius, a hard man, utterly fearless--and for all\r\nthat a misfortune in that he looked at the whole world through Potsdam\r\nglasses, with an altogether erroneous judgment, wrecking every attempt\r\nat peace which was not a peace by victory. Those very people who\r\nworshipped Ludendorff when he spoke of a victorious peace stone him\r\nnow for that very thing; Ludendorff was exactly like the statesmen of\r\nEngland and France, who all rejected compromise and declared for\r\nvictory alone; in this respect there was no difference between them.\r\nThe peace of mutual understanding which I wished for was rejected on\r\nthe Thames and on the Seine just as by Ludendorff himself. I have said\r\nthis already. According to the treaty it was our undoubted duty to\r\ncarry on a defensive war to the utmost and reciprocally to defend the\r\nintegrity of the State. It is therefore perfectly obvious that I could\r\nnever publicly express any other view, that I was throughout forced to\r\ndeclare that we were fighting for Alsace-Lorraine just as we were for\r\nTrentino, that I could not relinquish German territory to the Entente\r\nso long as I lacked the power to persuade Germany herself to such a\r\nstep. But, as I will show, the most strenuous endeavours were made in\r\nthis latter direction. And I may here in parenthesis remark that our\r\nmilitary men throughout refrained from committing the error of the\r\nGerman generals, and interfering in politics themselves. It is\r\nundoubtedly to the credit of our Emperor that whenever any tendency to\r\nsuch interference appeared he quashed it at once. But in particular I\r\nshould point out that the Archduke Frederick confined his activity\r\nsolely to the task of bringing about peace. He has rendered most\r\nvaluable service in this, as also in his endeavours to arrive at\r\nfavourable relations with Germany.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after taking up office I had some discussions with the\r\nGerman Government which left those gentlemen perfectly aware of the\r\nserious nature of the situation. In April, 1917--eighteen months\r\nago--I sent the following report to the Emperor Charles, which he\r\nforwarded to the Emperor William with the remark that he was entirely\r\nof my opinion.\r\n\r\n[This report is already printed in these pages. See p. 146.]\r\n\r\nThis led to a reply from the German Government, dated May 9, again\r\nexpressing the utmost confidence in the success of the submarine\r\ncampaign, declaring, it is true, their willingness in principle to\r\ntake steps towards peace, but reprehending any such steps as might be\r\ncalculated to give an impression of weakness.\r\n\r\nAs to any territorial sacrifice on the part of Germany, this was not\r\nto be thought of.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from this report, however, we did not confine\r\nourselves to words alone. In 1917 we declared in Berlin that the\r\nEmperor Charles was prepared to permit the union of Galicia with\r\nPoland, and to do all that could be done to attach that State to\r\nGermany in the event of Germany making any sacrifices in the West in\r\norder to secure peace. But we were met with a _non possumus_ and the\r\nGerman answer that territorial concessions to France were out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Galicia was here involved, but I was firmly assured that\r\nif the plan succeeded Germany would protect the rights of the Ukraine;\r\nand consideration for the Ukrainians would certainly not have\r\nrestrained me had it been a question of the highest value--of peace\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWhen I perceived that the likelihood of converting Berlin to our views\r\nsteadily diminished I had recourse to other means. The journey of the\r\nSocialist leaders to Stockholm will be remembered. It is true that the\r\nSocialists were not \"sent\" by me; they went to Stockholm of their own\r\ninitiative and on their own responsibility, but it is none the less\r\ntrue that I could have refused them their passes if I had shared the\r\nviews of the Entente Governments and of numerous gentlemen in our own\r\ncountry. Certainly, I was at the time very sceptical as to the\r\noutcome, as I already saw that the Entente would refuse passes to\r\ntheir Socialists, and consequently there could be nothing but a \"rump\"\r\nparliament in the end. But despite all the reproaches which I had to\r\nbear, and the argument that the peace-bringing Socialists would have\r\nan enormous power in the State to the detriment of the monarchical\r\nprinciple itself, I never for a moment hesitated to take that step,\r\nand I have never regretted it in itself, only that it did not succeed.\r\nIt is encouraging to me now to read again many of the letters then\r\nreceived criticising most brutally my so-called \"Socialistic\r\nproceedings\" and to find that the same gentlemen who were then so\r\nincensed at my policy are now adherents of a line of criticism which\r\nmaintains that I am too \"narrow-minded\" in my choice of new means\r\ntowards peace.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered how, in the early autumn of 1917, the majority\r\nof the German Reichstag had a hard fight against the numerically\r\nweaker but, from their relation to the German Army Command, extremely\r\npowerful minority on the question of the reply to the Papal Note. Here\r\nagain I was no idle spectator. One of my friends, at my instigation,\r\nhad several conversations with Südekum and Erzberger, and encouraged\r\nthem, by my description of our own position, to pass the well known\r\npeace resolution. It was owing to this description of the state of\r\naffairs here that the two gentlemen mentioned were enabled to carry\r\nthe Reichstag's resolution in favour of a peace by mutual\r\nunderstanding--the resolution which met with such disdain and scorn\r\nfrom the Pan-Germans and other elements. I hoped then, for a moment,\r\nto have gained a lasting and powerful alliance in the German Reichstag\r\nagainst the German military plans of conquest.\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen, I should like to say a few words on the subject of\r\nthat unfortunate submarine campaign which was undoubtedly the beginning\r\nof the end, and to set forth the reasons which in this case, as in many\r\nother instances, forced us to adopt tactics not in accordance with our\r\nown convictions. Shortly after my appointment as Minister the idea of\r\nunrestricted submarine warfare began to take form in German minds. The\r\nprincipal advocate of this plan was Admiral Tirpitz. To the credit of\r\nthe former _Reichskansler_, Bethmann-Hollweg, be it said that he was\r\nlong opposed to the idea, and used all means and every argument to\r\ndissuade others from adopting so perilous a proceeding. In the end he\r\nwas forced to give way, as was the case with all politicians who came\r\nin conflict with the all-powerful military party. Admiral Holtzendorff\r\ncame to us at that time, and the question was debated from every point\r\nof view in long conferences lasting for hours. My then ministerial\r\ncolleagues, Tisza and Clam, as well as myself were entirely in\r\nagreement with Emperor Charles in rejecting the proposal, and the only\r\none who then voted unreservedly in favour of it was Admiral Haus. It\r\nshould here be noted that the principal German argument at that time\r\nwas not the prospect of starving England into submission, but the\r\nsuggestion that the Western front could not be held unless the American\r\nmunition transports were sunk--that is to say, the case for the\r\nsubmarine campaign was then based chiefly on a point of _technical\r\nmilitary importance_ and nothing else. I myself earnestly considered\r\nthe question then of separating ourselves from Germany on this point;\r\nwith the small number of U-boats at our disposal it would have made but\r\nlittle difference had we on our part refrained. But another point had\r\nhere to be considered. If the submarine campaign was to succeed in the\r\nnorthern waters it must be carried out at the same time in the\r\nMediterranean. With this latter water unaffected the transports would\r\nhave been sent via Italy, France and Dover to England, and the northern\r\nU-boat campaign would have been paralysed. But in order to carry\r\non submarine war in the Adriatic we should have to give the Germans\r\naccess to our bases, such as Pola, Cattaro and Trieste, and by so doing\r\nwe were _de facto_ partaking in the submarine campaign ourselves. If we\r\ndid not do it, then we were attacking Germany in the rear by hindering\r\ntheir submarine campaign--that is to say, it would bring us into direct\r\nconflict with Germany. Therefore, albeit sorely against our will, we\r\nagreed, not convinced by argument, but unable to act otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen, I hasten to conclude. I have but a few words to\r\nsay as to the present. From time to time reports have appeared in the\r\npapers to the effect that certain gentlemen were preparing\r\ndisturbances in Switzerland, and I myself have been mentioned as one\r\nof them. I am doubtful whether there is any truth at all in these\r\nreports; as for myself, I have not been outside this country for the\r\nlast nine months. As, however, my contradiction on this head itself\r\nappears to have given rise to further misunderstandings, I will give\r\nyou my point of view here briefly and, as I hope, clearly enough. I am\r\nmost strongly opposed to any attempt at revolt. I am convinced that\r\nany such attempt could only lead to civil war--a thing no one would\r\nwish to see. I am therefore of opinion that the Republican Government\r\nmust be maintained untouched until the German-Austrian people as a\r\nwhole has taken its decision. But this can only be decided by the\r\nGerman people. Neither the Republic nor the Monarchy is in itself a\r\ndogma of democracy. The Kingdom of England is as democratic as\r\nrepublican Switzerland. I know no country where men enjoy so great\r\nfreedom as in England. But it is a dogma of democracy that the people\r\nitself must determine in what manner it will be governed, and I\r\ntherefore repeat that the final word can only be spoken by the\r\nconstitutional representative body. I believe that I am here entirely\r\nat one with the present Government. There are two methods of\r\nascertaining the will of the people: either each candidate for the\r\nrepresentative body stands for election on a monarchical or a\r\nrepublican platform, in which case the majority of the body itself\r\nwill express the decision; or the question of Monarchy or Republic can\r\nbe decided by a plebiscite. It is matter of common knowledge that I\r\nmyself have had so serious conflicts with the ex-Kaiser that any\r\nco-operation between us is for all time an impossibility. No one can,\r\ntherefore, suspect me of wishing on personal grounds to revert to the\r\nold régime. But I am not one to juggle with the idea of democracy, and\r\nits nature demands that the people itself should decide. I believe\r\nthat the majority of German-Austria is against the old régime, and\r\nwhen it has expressed itself to this effect the furtherance of\r\ndemocracy is sufficiently assured.\r\n\r\nAnd with this, gentlemen, I have finished what I proposed to set\r\nbefore you. I vainly endeavoured to make peace together with Germany,\r\nbut I was not unsuccessful in my endeavours to save the\r\nGerman-Austrians from ultimately coming to armed conflict with\r\nGermany. I can say this, and without exaggeration, that I have\r\ndefended the German alliance as if it had been my own child, and I do\r\nnot know what would have happened had I not done so. Andrassy's \"extra\r\nturn\" at the last moment showed the great mass of the public how\r\npresent a danger was that of war with Germany. Had the same\r\nexperiment been made six months before it would have been war with\r\nGermany; would have made Austria a scene of war.\r\n\r\nThere are evil times in store for the German people, but a people of\r\nmany millions cannot perish and will not perish. The day will come\r\nwhen the wounds of this war begin to close and heal, and when that day\r\ncomes a better future will dawn.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian armies went forth in the hour of war to save Austria.\r\nThey have not availed to save it. But if out of this ocean of blood\r\nand suffering a better, freer and nobler world arise, then they will\r\nnot have died in vain, all those we loved who now lie buried in cold\r\nalien earth; they died for the happiness, the peace and the future of\r\nthe generations to come.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Translated from the German text given by Count Czernin, no English\r\ntext being
