RIDGEWAY, NO. 1, YORK-STREET, ST. JAMES'S SQUARE.\r\n\r\nM,DCC,XII. [_sic_, actually 1792]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA London translation of an original work in French, by the Abbe\r\nRaynal, which treats of the Revolution of North America, having been\r\nreprinted in Philadelphia and other parts of the continent, and as the\r\ndistance at which the Abbe is placed from the American theatre of war\r\nand politics, has occasioned him to mistake several facts, or\r\nmisconceive the causes or principles by which they were produced; the\r\nfollowing tract, therefore, is published with a view to rectify them,\r\nand prevent even accidental errors intermixing with history, under the\r\nsanction of time and silence.\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the London edition has entitled it, \"The Revolution of\r\nAmerica, by the Abbe Raynal,\" and the American printers have followed\r\nthe example. But I have understood, and I believe my information just,\r\nthat the piece, which is more properly reflections on the revolution,\r\nwas unfairly purloined from the printer which the Abbe employed, or\r\nfrom the manuscript copy, and is only part of a larger work then in\r\nthe press, or preparing for it. The person who procured it appears to\r\nhave been an Englishman; and though, in an advertisement prefixt to\r\nthe London edition, he has endeavoured to gloss over the embezzlement\r\nwith professions of patriotism, and to soften it with high encomiums\r\non the author, yet the action, in any view in which it can be placed,\r\nis illiberal and unpardonable.\r\n\r\n\"In the course of his travels,\" says he, \"the translator happily\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a copy of this exquisite little piece, which\r\nhas not yet made its appearance from any press. He publishes a French\r\nedition, in favour of those who will feel its eloquent reasoning more\r\nforcibly in its native language, at the same time with the following\r\ntranslation of it; in which he has been desirous, perhaps in vain,\r\nthat all the warmth, the grace, the strength, the dignity of the\r\noriginal should not be lost. And he flatters himself, that the\r\nindulgence of the illustrious historian will not be wanting to a man,\r\nwho, of his own motion, has taken the liberty to give this composition\r\nto the public, only from a strong persuasion, that this momentous\r\nargument will be useful, in a critical conjecture, to that country\r\nwhich he loves with an ardour that can be exceeded only by the nobler\r\nflame which burns in the bosom of the philanthropic author, for the\r\nfreedom and happiness of all the countries upon earth.\"\r\n\r\nThis plausibility of setting off a dishonourable action, may pass for\r\npatriotism and sound principles with those who do not enter into its\r\ndemerits, and whose interest is not injured, nor their happiness\r\naffected thereby. But it is more than probable, notwithstanding the\r\ndeclarations it contains, that the copy was obtained for the sake of\r\nprofiting by the sale of a new and popular work, and that the\r\nprofessions are but a garb to the fraud.\r\n\r\nIt may with propriety be remarked, that in all countries where\r\nliterature is protected, and it never can flourish where it is not,\r\nthe works of an author are his legal property; and to treat letters in\r\nany other light than this, is to banish them from the country, or\r\nstrangle them in the birth.--The embezzlement from the Abbe Raynal\r\nwas, it is true, committed by one country upon another, and therefore\r\nshews no defect in the laws of either. But it is nevertheless a breach\r\nof civil manners and literary justice; neither can it be any apology,\r\nthat because the countries are at war, literature shall be entitled\r\nto depredation.[1]\r\n\r\nBut the forestalling the Abbe's publication by London editions, both\r\nin French and English, and thereby not only defrauding him, and\r\nthrowing an expensive publication on his hands, by anticipating the\r\nsale, are only the smaller injuries which such conduct may occasion. A\r\nman's opinions, whether written or in thought, are his own until he\r\npleases to publish them himself; and it is adding cruelty to injustice\r\nto make him the author of what future reflection or better information\r\nmight occasion him to suppress or amend. There are declarations and\r\nsentiments in the Abbe's piece, which, for my own part, I did not\r\nexpect to find, and such as himself, on a revisal, might have seen\r\noccasion to change, but the anticipated piracy effectually prevented\r\nhim the opportunity, and precipitated him into difficulties, which,\r\nhad it not been for such ungenerous fraud, might not have happened.\r\n\r\nThis mode of making an author appear before his time, will appear\r\nstill more ungenerous, when we consider how exceedingly few men there\r\nare in any country who can at once, and without the aid of reflection\r\nand revisal, combine warm passions with a cool temper, and the full\r\nexpansion of imagination with the natural and necessary gravity of\r\njudgment, so as to be rightly balanced within themselves, and to make\r\na reader feel, and understand justly at the same time. To call three\r\npowers of the mind into action at once, in a manner that neither shall\r\ninterrupt, and that each shall aid and vigorate the other, is a talent\r\nvery rarely possessed.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, that the weight of an argument is lost by the wit of\r\nsetting it off, or the judgment disordered by an intemperate\r\nirritation of the passions: yet a certain degree of animation must be\r\nfelt by the writer, and raised in the reader, in order to interest the\r\nattention; and a sufficient scope given to the imagination, to enable\r\nit to create in the mind a sight of the persons, characters, and\r\ncircumstances of the subject; for without these, the judgment will\r\nfeel little or no excitement to office, and its determinations will be\r\ncold, sluggish, and imperfect. But if either or both of the two former\r\nare raised too high, or heated too much, the judgment will be jostled\r\nfrom his seat, and the whole matter, however important in itself, will\r\ndiminish into a pantomime of the mind, in which we create images that\r\npromote no other purpose than amusement.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe's writings bear evident marks of that extension and rapidness\r\nof thinking and quickness of sensation which of all others require\r\nrevisal, and the more particularly so when applied to the living\r\ncharacters of nations or individuals in a state of war. The least\r\nmisinformation or misconception leads to some wrong conclusion and an\r\nerror believed becomes the progenitor of others. And as the Abbe has\r\nsuffered some inconveniences in France, by mistating certain\r\ncircumstances of the war and the characters of the parties therein, it\r\nbecomes some apology for him, that those errors were precipitated into\r\nthe world by the avarice of an ungenerous enemy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] The state of literature in America must one day become a subject\r\nof legislative consideration. Hitherto it hath been a disinterested\r\nvolunteer in the service of the revolution, and no man thought of\r\nprofits: but when peace shall give time and opportunity for study, the\r\ncountry will deprive itself of the honour and service of letters and\r\nthe improvement of science, unless sufficient laws are made to prevent\r\ndepredations on literary property. It is well worth remarking that\r\nRussia, who but a few years ago was scarcely known in Europe, owes a\r\nlarge share of her present greatness to the close attention she has\r\npaid, and the wise encouragement she has given to science and\r\nlearning, and we have almost the same instance in France, in the reign\r\nof Lewis XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER ADDRESSED TO THE ABBE RAYNAL\r\n\r\n\r\nTo an author of such distinguished reputation as the Abbe Raynal, it\r\nmight very well become me to apologize for the present undertaking;\r\nbut as _to be right_ is the first wish of philosophy, and the first\r\nprinciple of history, he will, I presume, accept from me a declaration\r\nof my motives, which are those of doing justice, in preference to any\r\ncomplimental apology, I might otherwise make. The Abbe, in the course\r\nof his work, has, in some instances extolled, without a reason, and\r\nwounded without a cause. He has given fame where it was not deserved,\r\nand withheld it where it was justly due; and appears to be so\r\nfrequently in and out of temper with his subjects and parties, that\r\nfew or none of them are decisively and uniformly marked.\r\n\r\nIt is yet too soon to write the history of the revolution; and whoever\r\nattempts it precipitately, will unavoidably mistake characters and\r\ncircumstances, and involve himself in error and difficulty. Things\r\nlike men are seldom understood rightly at first sight. But the Abbe is\r\nwrong even in the foundation of his work; that is, he has misconceived\r\nand misstated the causes which produced the rupture between England\r\nand her then colonies, and which led on, step by step, unstudied and\r\nuncontrived on the part of America, to a revolution, which has engaged\r\nthe attention, and affected the interest of Europe.\r\n\r\nTo prove this, I shall bring forward a passage, which, though placed\r\ntowards the latter part of the Abbe's work, is more intimately\r\nconnected with the beginning: and in which, speaking of the original\r\ncause of the dispute, he declares himself in the following manner--\r\n\r\n\"None,\" says he, \"of those energetic causes, which have produced so\r\nmany revolutions upon the globe, existed in North-America. Neither\r\nreligion nor laws had there been outraged. The blood of martyrs or\r\npatriots had not there streamed from scaffolds. Morals had not there\r\nbeen insulted. Manners, customs, habits, no object dear to nations,\r\nhad there been the sport of ridicule. Arbitrary power had not there\r\ntorn any inhabitant from the arms of his family and friends, to drag\r\nhim to a dreary dungeon. Public order had not been there inverted. The\r\nprinciples of administration had not been changed there; and the\r\nmaxims of government had there always remained the same. The whole\r\nquestion was reduced to the knowing whether the mother country had,\r\nor, had not a right to lay, directly or indirectly, a slight tax upon\r\nthe colonies.\"\r\n\r\nOn this extraordinary passage, it may not be improper, in general\r\nterms, to remark, that none can feel like those who suffer; and that\r\nfor a man to be a competent judge of the provocative, or, as the Abbe\r\nstyles them, the energetic causes of the revolution, he must have\r\nresided in America.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe, in saying that the several particulars he has enumerated did\r\nnot exist in America, and neglecting to point out the particular\r\nperiod in which the means they did not exist, reduces thereby his\r\ndeclaration to a nullity, by taking away all meaning from the passage.\r\n\r\nThey did not exist in 1763, and they all existed before 1776;\r\nconsequently as there was a time when they did _not_, and another when\r\nthey _did_ exist, the _time when_ constitutes the essence of the fact;\r\nand not to give it, is to withhold the only evidence which proves the\r\ndeclaration right or wrong, and on which it must stand or fall. But\r\nthe declaration as it now appears, unaccompanied by time, has an\r\neffect in holding out to the world, that there was no real cause for\r\nthe revolution, because it denied the existence of all those causes\r\nwhich are supposed to be justifiable, and which the Abbe styles\r\nenergetic.\r\n\r\nI confess myself exceedingly at a loss to find out the time to which\r\nthe Abbe alludes; because, in another part of the work, in speaking of\r\nthe stamp act, which was passed in 1764, he styles it \"An _usurpation_\r\nof the Americans' _most precious and sacred rights_.\" Consequently he\r\nhere admits the most energetic of all causes, that is, _an usurpation\r\nof their most precious and sacred rights_, to have existed in America\r\ntwelve years before the declaration of independence, and ten years\r\nbefore the breaking out of hostilities. The time, therefore, in which\r\nthe paragraph is true, must be antecedent to the stamp act, but as at\r\nthat time there was no revolution, nor any idea of one, it\r\nconsequently applies without a meaning; and as it cannot, on the\r\nAbbe's own principle, be applied to any time _after_ the stamp act, it\r\nis therefore a wandering, solitary paragraph connected with nothing,\r\nand at variance with every thing.\r\n\r\nThe stamp act, it is true, was repealed two years after it was passed;\r\nbut it was immediately followed by one of infinitely more mischievous\r\nmagnitude, I mean the declaratory act, which asserted the right, as it\r\nwas styled, of the British Parliament, \"_to bind America in all cases\r\nwhatsoever_.\"\r\n\r\nIf then, the stamp act was an usurpation of the Americans' most\r\nprecious and sacred rights, the declaratory Act left them no rights at\r\nall; and contained the full grown seeds of the most despotic\r\ngovernment ever exercised in the world. It placed America not only in\r\nthe lowest, but in the basest state of vassalage; because it demanded\r\nan unconditional submission in everything, or, as the act expressed\r\nit, _in all cases whatsoever_: and what renders this act the more\r\noffensive, is, that it appears to have been passed as an act of mercy;\r\ntruly then may it be said, that _the tender mercies of the wicked are\r\ncruel_.\r\n\r\nAll the original charters from the Crown of England, under the faith\r\nof which, the adventurers from the old world settled in the new, were\r\nby this act displaced from their foundations; because, contrary to the\r\nnature of them, which was that of a compact, they were now made\r\nsubject to repeal or alteration at the mere will of one party only.\r\nThe whole condition of America was thus put into the hands of the\r\nParliament or the Ministry, without leaving to her the least right in\r\nany case whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThere is no despotism to which this iniquitous law did not extend; and\r\nthough it might have been convenient in the execution of it, to have\r\nconsulted manners and habits, the principle of the act made all\r\ntyranny legal. It stopt no where. It went to everything. It took in\r\nwith it the whole life of a man, or, if I may so express it, an\r\neternity of circumstances. It is the nature of law to require\r\nobedience, but this demanded servitude; and the condition of an\r\nAmerican, under the operation of it, was not that of a subject, but a\r\nvassal. Tyranny has often been established _without_ law, and\r\nsometimes _against_ it, but the history of mankind does not produce\r\nanother instance, in which it has been established _by_ law. It is an\r\naudacious outrage upon civil government, and cannot be too much\r\nexposed, in order to be sufficiently detested.\r\n\r\nNeither could it be said after this, that the legislature of that\r\ncountry any longer made laws for this, but that it gave out commands;\r\nfor wherein differed an act of Parliament constructed on this\r\nprinciple, and operating in this manner, over an unrepresented people,\r\nfrom the orders of a military establishment?\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of England, with respect to America, was not septennial\r\nbut _perpetual_. It appeared to the latter a body always in being. Its\r\nelection or expiration were to her the same, as if its members\r\nsucceeded by inheritance, or went out by death, or lived for ever, or\r\nwere appointed to it as a matter of office. Therefore, for the people\r\nof England to have any just conception of the mind of America,\r\nrespecting this extraordinary act, they must suppose all election and\r\nexpiration in that country to cease forever, and the present\r\nParliament, its heirs, &c., to be perpetual; in this case, I ask, what\r\nwould the most clamorous of them think, were an act to be passed,\r\ndeclaring the right of _such a Parliament_ to bind _them_ in all cases\r\nwhatsoever? For this word _whatsoever_ would go as effectually to\r\ntheir _Magna Charta, Bill of Rights, trial by Juries_, &c. as it went\r\nto the charters and forms of government in America.\r\n\r\nI am persuaded, that the Gentleman to whom I address these remarks\r\nwill not, after the passing of this act, say, \"That the _principles_\r\nof administration had not been _changed_ in America, and that the\r\nmaxims of government had there been _always the same_.\" For here is,\r\nin principle, a total overthrow of the whole; and not a subversion\r\nonly, but an annihilation of the foundation of liberty and absolute\r\ndominion established in its stead.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe likewise states the case exceedingly wrong and injuriously,\r\nwhen he says, \"that _the whole_ question was reduced to the\r\nknowing whether the mother country had, or had not, a right to lay,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, a _slight_ tax upon the colonies.\" This was\r\n_not the whole_ of the question; neither was the _quantity_ of the tax\r\nthe object, either to the Ministry, or to the Americans. It was the\r\nprinciple, of which the tax made but a part, and the quantity still\r\nless, that formed the ground on which America opposed.\r\n\r\nThe tax on tea, which is the tax here alluded to, was neither more or\r\nless than an experiment to establish the practice of a declaratory law\r\nupon; modelled into the more fashionable phrase _of the universal\r\nsupremacy of Parliament_. For until this time the declaratory law had\r\nlain dormant, and the framers of it had contented themselves with\r\nbarely declaring an opinion.\r\n\r\nTherefore the _whole_ question with America, in the opening of the\r\ndispute, was, Shall we be bound in all cases whatsoever by the British\r\nParliament, or shall we not? For submission to the tea or tax act,\r\nimplied an acknowledgment of the declaratory act, or, in other words,\r\nof the universal supremacy of Parliament, which as they never intended\r\nto do, it was necessary they should oppose it, in its first stage of\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, the Abbe has been led into this mistake by perusing\r\ndetached pieces in some of the American newspapers; for, in a case\r\nwhere all were interested, everyone had a right to give his opinion;\r\nand there were many who, with the best intentions, did not chuse the\r\nbest, nor indeed the true ground, to defend their cause upon. They\r\nfelt themselves right by a general impulse, without being able to\r\nseparate, analyze, and arrange the parts.\r\n\r\nI am somewhat unwilling to examine too minutely into the whole of this\r\nextraordinary passage of the Abbe, lest I should appear to treat it\r\nwith severity; otherwise I could shew, that not a single declaration\r\nis justly founded; for instance, the reviving an obsolete act of the\r\nreign of Henry the Eighth, and fitting it to the Americans, by\r\nauthority of which they were to be seized and brought from America to\r\nEngland, and there imprisoned and tried for any supposed offenses,\r\nwas, in the worse sense of the words, _to tear them by the arbitrary\r\npower of Parliament, from the arms of their families and friends, and\r\ndrag them not only to dreary but distant dungeons_. Yet this act was\r\ncontrived some years before the breaking out of hostilities. And\r\nagain, though the blood of martyrs and patriots had not streamed on\r\nthe scaffolds, it streamed in the streets, in the massacre of the\r\ninhabitants of Boston, by the British soldiery in the year 1770.\r\n\r\nHad the Abbe said that the causes which produced the revolution in\r\nAmerica were originally _different_ from those which produced\r\nrevolutions in other parts of the globe, he had been right. Here the\r\nvalue and quality of liberty, the nature of government, and the\r\ndignity of man, were known and understood, and the attachment of the\r\nAmericans to these principles produced the revolution, as a natural\r\nand almost unavoidable consequence. They had no particular family to\r\nset up or pull down. Nothing of personality was incorporated with\r\ntheir cause. They started even-handed with each other, and went no\r\nfaster into the several stages of it, than they were driven by the\r\nunrelenting and imperious conduct of Britain. Nay, in the last act,\r\nthe declaration of independence, they had nearly been too late; for\r\nhad it not been declared at the exact time it was, I saw no period in\r\ntheir affairs since, in which it could have been declared with the\r\nsame effect, and probably not at all.\r\n\r\nBut the object being formed before the reverse of fortune took place,\r\nthat is, before the operations of the gloomy campaign of 1776, their\r\nhonour, their interest, their everything, called loudly on them to\r\nmaintain it; and that glow of thought and energy of heart, which even\r\ndistant prospect of independence inspires, gave confidence to their\r\nhopes, and resolution to their conduct, which a state of dependence\r\ncould never have reached. They looked forward to happier days and\r\nscenes of rest, and qualified the hardships of the campaign by\r\ncontemplating the establishment of their new-born system.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we take a review of what part great Britain has\r\nacted, we shall find every thing which ought to make a nation blush.\r\nThe most vulgar abuse, accompanied by that species of haughtiness\r\nwhich distinguishes the hero of a mob from the character of a\r\ngentleman; it was equally as much from her manners as from her\r\ninjustice that she lost the colonies. By the latter she provoked their\r\nprinciples, by the former she wore out their temper; and it ought to\r\nbe held out as an example to the world, to shew how necessary it is to\r\nconduct the business of government with civility. In short, other\r\nrevolutions may have originated in caprice, or generated in ambition,\r\nbut here, the most unoffending humility was tortured into rage, and\r\nthe infancy of existence made to weep.\r\n\r\nA union so extensive, continued and determined, suffering with\r\npatience, and never in despair, could not have been produced by common\r\ncauses. It must be something capable of reaching the whole soul of man\r\nand arming it with perpetual energy. In vain it is to look for\r\nprecedents among the revolutions of former ages, to find out, by\r\ncomparison, the causes of this. The spring, the progress, the object,\r\nthe consequences, nay the men, their habits of thinking, and all the\r\ncircumstances of the country, are different. Those of other nations\r\nare, in general, little more than the history of their quarrels. They\r\nare marked by no important character in the annals of events; mixt in\r\nthe mass of general matters, they occupy but a common page; and while\r\nthe chief of the successful partizans stept into power, the plundered\r\nmultitude sat down and sorrowed. Few, very few of them are accompanied\r\nwith reformation, either in government or manners; many of them with\r\nthe most consummate profligacy.--Triumph on the one side, and misery\r\non the other, were the only events. Pains, punishments, torture, and\r\ndeath, were made the business of mankind, until compassion, the\r\nfairest associate of the heart, was driven from its place; and the\r\neye, accustomed to continual cruelty, could behold it without offence.\r\n\r\nBut as the principles of the present resolution differed from those\r\nwhich preceded it, so likewise has the conduct of America, both in\r\ngovernment and war. Neither the foul finger of disgrace, nor the\r\nbloody hand of vengeance has hitherto put a blot upon her fame. Her\r\nvictories have received lustre from a greatness of lenity; and her\r\nlaws been permitted to slumber, where they might justly have awakened\r\nto punish. War, so much the trade of the world, has here been only the\r\nbusiness of necessity; and when the necessity shall cease, her very\r\nenemies must confess, that as she drew the sword in her just defence,\r\nshe used it without cruelty, and sheathed it without revenge.\r\n\r\nAs it is not my design to extend these remarks to a history, I shall\r\nnow take my leave of this passage of the Abbe, with an observation,\r\nwhich, until something unfolds itself to convince me otherwise, I\r\ncannot avoid believing to be true;--which is, that it was the fixt\r\ndetermination of the British Cabinet to quarrel with America at all\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThey (the members who compose the cabinet) had no doubt of success, if\r\nthey could once bring it to the issue of a battle; and they expected\r\nfrom a conquest, what they could neither propose with decency, nor\r\nhope for by negociation. The charters and constitutions of the\r\ncolonies were become to them matters of offence, and their rapid\r\nprogress in property and population were disgustingly beheld as the\r\ngrowing and natural means of independence. They saw no way to retain\r\nthem long but by reducing them time. A conquest would at once have\r\nmade them both lords and landlords, and put them in the possession\r\nboth of the revenue and the rental. The whole trouble of government\r\nwould have ceased in a victory, and a final end put to remonstrance\r\nand debate. The experience of the stamp act had taught them how to\r\nquarrel with the advantages of cover and convenience, and they had\r\nnothing to do but to renew the scene, and put contention into motion.\r\nThey hoped for a rebellion, and they made one. They expected a\r\ndeclaration of independence, and they were not disappointed. But after\r\nthis, they looked for victory, and obtained a defeat.\r\n\r\nIf this be taken as the generating cause of the contest, then is every\r\npart of the conduct of the British ministry consistent, from the\r\ncommencement of the dispute, until the signing the treaty of Paris,\r\nafter which, conquest becoming doubtful, they retreated to\r\nnegociation, and were again defeated.\r\n\r\nThough the Abbe possesses and displays great powers of genius, and is\r\na master of style and language, he seems not to pay equal attention to\r\nthe office of an historian. His facts are coldly and carelessly\r\nstated. They neither inform the reader, nor interest him. Many of them\r\nare erroneous, and most of them defective and obscure. It is\r\nundoubtedly both an ornament, and a useful addition to history, to\r\naccompany it with maxims and reflections. They afford likewise an\r\nagreeable change to the style, and a more diversified manner of\r\nexpression; but it is absolutely necessary that the root from whence\r\nthey spring, or the foundations on which they are raised, should be\r\nwell attended to, which in this work they are not. The Abbe hastens\r\nthrough his narrations, as if he was glad to get from them, that he\r\nmay enter the more copious field of eloquence and imagination.\r\n\r\nThe actions of Trenton and Princeton, in New Jersey, in December 1776,\r\nand January following, on which the fate of America stood for a while\r\ntrembling on the point of suspence, and from which the most important\r\nconsequences followed, are comprised within a single paragraph,\r\nfaintly conceived, and barren of character, circumstance and\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\"On the 25th of December,\" says the Abbe, \"they (the Americans)\r\ncrossed the Delaware, and fell _accidentally_ upon Trenton, which was\r\noccupied by fifteen hundred of the twelve thousand Hessians, sold in\r\nso base a manner by their avaricious master, to the King of Great\r\nBritain. This corps was _massacred_, taken, or dispersed. Eight days\r\nafter, three English regiments were in like manner driven from\r\nPrinceton; but after having better supported their reputation than the\r\nforeign troops in their pay.\"\r\n\r\nThis is all the account which is given of these most interesting\r\nevents. The Abbe has preceded them by two or three pages, on the\r\nmilitary operations of both armies, from the time of General Howe\r\narriving before New York from Halifax, and the vast reinforcements of\r\nBritish and foreign troops with Lord Howe from England. But in these\r\nthere is so much mistake, and so many omissions, that to set them\r\nright, must be the business of history, and not of a letter. The\r\naction of Long Island is but barely hinted at; and the operations at\r\nthe White Plains wholly omitted: as are likewise the attack and loss\r\nof Fort Washington, with a garrison of about two thousand five hundred\r\nmen, and the precipitate evacuation of Fort Lee, in consequence\r\nthereof; which losses were in a great measure the cause of the retreat\r\nthrough the Jersies to the Delaware, a distance of about ninety miles.\r\nNeither is the manner of the retreat described, which, from the season\r\nof the year, the nature of the country, the nearness of the two armies\r\n(sometimes within sight and shot of each other for such a length of\r\nway), the rear of the one employed in pulling down bridges, and the\r\nvan of the other in building them up, must necessarily be accompanied\r\nwith many interesting circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt was a period of distresses. A crisis rather of danger than of\r\nhope, there is no description can do it justice; and even the actors\r\nin it, looking back upon the scene, are surprised how they got\r\nthrough; and at a loss to account for those powers of the mind and\r\nsprings of animation, by which they withstood the force of accumulated\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\nIt was expected, that the time for which the army was enlisted, would\r\ncarry the campaign so far into the winter, that the severity of the\r\nseason, and the consequent condition of the roads, would prevent any\r\nmaterial operation of the enemy, until the new army could be raised\r\nfor the next year. And I mention it, as a matter worthy of attention\r\nby all future historians, that the movements of the American army,\r\nuntil the attack upon the Hessian post at Trenton, the 26th of\r\nDecember, are to be considered as operating to effect no other\r\nprincipal purpose than delay, and to wear away the campaign under all\r\nthe disadvantages of an unequal force, with as little misfortune as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBut the loss of the garrison at Fort Washington, on the 16th of\r\nNovember, and the expiration of the time of a considerable part of the\r\narmy, so early as the 30th of the same month, and which were to be\r\nfollowed by almost daily expirations afterwards, made retreat the only\r\nfinal expedient. To these circumstances may be added the forlorn and\r\ndestitute condition of the few that remained; for the garrison at Fort\r\nLee, which composed almost the whole of the retreat, had been obliged\r\nto abandon it so instantaneously, that every article of stores and\r\nbaggage was left behind, and in this destitute condition, without tent\r\nor blanket, and without any other utensils to dress their provision\r\nthan what they procured by the way, they performed a march of about\r\nninety miles, and had the address and management to prolong it to the\r\nspace of nineteen days.\r\n\r\nBy this unexpected, or rather unthought of turn of affairs, the\r\ncountry was in an instant surprised into confusion, and found an enemy\r\nwithin its bowels, without any army to oppose him. There were no\r\nsuccours to be had, but from the free-will offering of the\r\ninhabitants. All was choice, and every man reasoned for himself.\r\n\r\nIt was in this situation of affairs, equally calculated to confound or\r\nto inspire, that the gentleman, the merchant, the farmer, the\r\ntradesman and the labourer, mutually turned out from all the\r\nconveniencies of home, to perform the duties of private soldiers, and\r\nundergo the severities of a winter campaign. The delay, so judiciously\r\ncontrived on the retreat, afforded time for the volunteer\r\nreinforcements to join General Washington on the Delaware.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe is likewise wrong in saying, that the American army fell\r\n_accidentally_ on Trenton. It was the very object for which General\r\nWashington crossed the Delaware in the dead of night, in the midst of\r\nsnow, storms, and ice: and which he immediately re-crossed with his\r\nprisoners, as soon as he had accomplished his purpose. Neither was the\r\nintended enterprise a secret to the enemy, imformation [_sic_] having\r\nbeen sent of it by letter, from a British Officer at Princeton, to\r\nColonel Rolle, who commanded the Hessians at Trenton, which letter was\r\nafterwards found by the Americans. Nevertheless the post was\r\ncompletely surprised. A small circumstance, which had the appearance\r\nof mistake on the part of the Americans, led to a more capital and\r\nreal mistake on the part of Rolle.\r\n\r\nThe case was this: A detachment of twenty or thirty Americans had been\r\nsent across the river from a post a few miles above, by an officer\r\nunacquainted with the intended attack; these were met by a body of\r\nHessians on the night, to which the information pointed, which was\r\nChristmas night, and repulsed. Nothing further appearing, and the\r\nHessians mistaking this for the advanced party, supposed the\r\nenterprize disconcerted, which at that time was not begun, and under\r\nthis idea returned to their quarters; so that, what might have raised\r\nan alarm, and brought the Americans into an ambuscade, served to take\r\noff the force of an information, and promote the success of the\r\nenterprise. Soon after day-light General Washington entered the town,\r\nand after a little opposition made himself master of it, with upwards\r\nof nine hundred prisoners.\r\n\r\nThis combination of equivocal circumstances, falling within what the\r\nAbbe styles, \"_the wide empire of chance_,\" would have afforded a fine\r\nfield for thought; and I wish, for the sake of that elegance of\r\nreflection he is so capable of using, that he had known it.\r\n\r\nBut the action of Princeton was accompanied by a still greater\r\nembarrassment of matters, and followed by more extraordinary\r\nconsequences. The Americans, by a happy stroke of generalship, in this\r\ninstance, not only deranged and defeated all the plans of the British,\r\nin the intended moment of execution, but drew from their posts the\r\nenemy they were not able to drive, and obliged them to close the\r\ncampaign. As the circumstance is a curiosity in war, and not well\r\nunderstood in Europe, I shall, as concisely as I can, relate the\r\nprincipal parts; they may serve to prevent future historians from\r\nerror, and recover from forgetfulness a scene of magnificent\r\nfortitude.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the surprise of the Hessians at Trenton, General\r\nWashington re-crossed the Delaware, which at this place is about three\r\nquarters of a mile over, and re-assumed his former post on the\r\nPennsylvania side. Trenton remained unoccupied, and the enemy were\r\nposted at Princeton, twelve miles distant, on the road toward\r\nNew-York. The weather was now growing very severe, and as there were\r\nvery few houses near the shore where General Washington had taken his\r\nstation, the greatest part of his army remained out in the woods and\r\nfields. These, with some other circumstances, induced the re-crossing\r\nthe Delaware and taking possession of Trenton. It was undoubtedly a\r\nbold adventure, and carried with it the appearance of defiance,\r\nespecially when we consider the panic-struck condition of the enemy on\r\nthe loss of the Hessian post. But in order to give a just idea of the\r\naffair, it is necessary that I should describe the place.\r\n\r\nTrenton is situated on a rising ground, about three quarters of a mile\r\ndistant from the Delaware, on the eastern or Jersey side; and is cut\r\ninto two divisions by a small creek or rivulet, sufficient to turn a\r\nmill which is on it, after which it empties itself at nearly right\r\nangles into the Delaware. The upper division, which is that to the\r\nnorth-east, contains about seventy or eighty houses, and the lower\r\nabout forty of fifty. The ground on each side this creek, and on which\r\nthe houses are, is likewise rising, and the two divisions present an\r\nagreeable prospect to each other, with the creek between, on which\r\nthere is a small stone bridge of one arch.\r\n\r\nScarcely had General Washington taken post here, and before the\r\nseveral parties of militia, out on detachments, or on their way, could\r\nbe collected, than the British, leaving behind them a strong garrison\r\nat Princeton, marched suddenly and entered Trenton at the upper or\r\nnorth-east quarter. A party of the Americans skirmished with the\r\nadvanced party of the British, to afford time for removing the stores\r\nand baggage, and withdrawing over the bridge.\r\n\r\nIn a little time the British had possession of one half of the town,\r\nGeneral Washington of the other; and the creek only separated the two\r\narmies. Nothing could be a more critical situation than this, and if\r\never the fate of America depended upon the event of a day, it was now.\r\nThe Delaware was filling fast with large sheets of driving ice, and\r\nwas impassable, so that no retreat into Pennsylvania could be\r\neffected, neither is it possible, in the face of an enemy, to pass a\r\nriver of such extent. The roads were broken and rugged with the frost,\r\nand the main road was occupied by the enemy.\r\n\r\nAbout four o'clock a party of the British approached the bridge, with\r\na design to gain it, but were repulsed. They made no more attempts,\r\nthough the creek itself is passable anywhere between the bridge and\r\nthe Delaware. It runs in a rugged, natural-made ditch, over which a\r\nperson may pass with little difficulty, the stream being rapid and\r\nshallow. Evening was now coming on, and the British, believing they\r\nhad all the advantages they could wish for, and that they could use\r\nthem when they pleased, discontinued all further operations, and held\r\nthemselves prepared to make the attack next morning.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning produced a scene as elegant as it was unexpected.\r\nThe British were under arms and ready to march to action, when one of\r\ntheir light-horse from Princeton came furiously down the street, with\r\nan account that General Washington had that morning attacked and\r\ncarried the British post at that place, and was proceeding on to seize\r\nthe magazine at Brunswick; on which the British, who were then on the\r\npoint of making an assault on the evacuated camp of the Americans,\r\nwheeled about, and in a fit of consternation marched for Princeton.\r\n\r\nThis retreat is one of those extraordinary circumstances, that in\r\nfuture ages may probably pass for fable. For it will with difficulty\r\nbe believed that two armies, on which such important consequences\r\ndepended, should be crouded into so small a space as Trenton; and that\r\nthe one, on the eve of an engagement, when every ear is supposed to be\r\nopen, and every watchfulness employed, should move completely from the\r\nground, with all its stores, baggage and artillery, unknown and even\r\nunsuspected by the other. And so entirely were the British deceived,\r\nthat when they heard the report of the cannon and small arms at\r\nPrinceton, they supposed it to be thunder, though in the depth of\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington, the better to cover and disguise his retreat from\r\nTrenton, had ordered a line of fires to be lighted up in front of his\r\ncamp. These not only served to give an appearance of going to rest,\r\nand continuing that deception, but they effectually concealed from the\r\nBritish whatever was acting behind them, for flame can no more be seen\r\nthrough than a wall, and in his situation, it may with some propriety\r\nbe said, they came a pillar of fire to the one army, and a pillar of a\r\ncloud to the other: after this, by a circuitous march of about\r\neighteen miles, the Americans reached Princeton early in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe number of prisoners taken were between two and three hundred, with\r\nwhich General Washington immediately set off. The van of the British\r\narmy from Trenton, entered Princeton about an hour after the Americans\r\nhad left it, who, continuing their march for the remainder of the day,\r\narrived in the evening at a convenient situation, wide of the main\r\nroad to Brunswick, and about sixteen miles distant from Princeton. But\r\nso wearied and exhausted were they, with the continual and unabated\r\nservice and fatigue of two days and a night, from action to action,\r\nwithout shelter and almost without refreshment, that the bare and\r\nfrozen ground, with no other covering than the sky, became to them a\r\nplace of comfortable rest. By these two events, and with but little\r\ncomparitive force to accomplish them, the Americans closed with\r\nadvantages a campaign, which but a few days before threatened the\r\ncountry with destruction. The British army, apprehensive for the\r\nsafety of their magazines at Brunswick, eighteen miles distant,\r\nmarched immediately for that place, where they arrived late in the\r\nevening, and from which they made no attempts to move for nearly five\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the principal outlines of these two most\r\ninteresting actions, I shall now quit them, to put the Abbe right in\r\nhis misstated account of the debt and paper money of America, wherein,\r\nspeaking of these matters, he says,\r\n\r\n\"These ideal riches were rejected. The more the multiplication of them\r\nwas urged by want, the greater did their appreciation grow. The\r\nCongress was indignant at the affronts given to its money, and\r\ndeclared all those to be traitors to their country, who should not\r\nreceive it as they would have received gold itself.\r\n\r\n\"Did not this body know, that possessions are no more to be controuled\r\nthan feelings are? Did it not perceive, that in the present crisis,\r\nevery rational man would be afraid of exposing his fortune? Did it not\r\nsee, that in the beginning of a Republic it permitted to itself the\r\nexercise of such acts of despotism as are unknown even in the\r\ncountries which are moulded to, and become familiar with servitude and\r\noppression? Could it pretend that it did not punish a want of\r\nconfidence with the pains which would have been scarcely merited by\r\nrevolt and treason? Of all this was the Congress well aware. But it\r\nhad no choice of means. Its despised and despicable scraps of paper\r\nwere actually thirty times below their original value, when more of\r\nthem were ordered to be made. On the 13th of September 1779, there was\r\nof this paper money, amongst the public, to the amount of\r\n£.35,544,155. The State owed moreover £.8,305,356, without reckoning\r\nthe particular debts of single Provinces.\"\r\n\r\nIn the above-recited passages, the Abbe speaks as if the United States\r\nhad contracted a debt of upwards of forty million pounds sterling,\r\nbesides the debts of individual States. After which, speaking of\r\nforeign trade with America, he says, that \"those countries in Europe,\r\nwhich are truly commercial ones, knowing that North America had been\r\nreduced to contract debts at the epoch even of her greatest\r\nprosperity, wisely thought, that in her present distress, she would be\r\nable to pay but very little, for what might be carried to her.\"\r\n\r\nI know it must be extremely difficult to make foreigners understand\r\nthe nature and circumstances of our paper money, because there are\r\nnatives who do not understand it themselves. But with us its fate is\r\nnow determined. Common consent has consigned it to rest with that kind\r\nof regard which the long service of inanimate things insensibly\r\nobtains from mankind. Every stone in the bridge, that has carried us\r\nover, seems to have a claim upon our esteem. But this was a\r\ncorner-stone, and its usefulness cannot be forgotten. There is\r\nsomething in a grateful mind, which extends itself even to things that\r\ncan neither be benefited by regard, nor suffer by neglect: But so it\r\nis; and almost every man is sensible of the effect.\r\n\r\nBut to return. The paper money, though issued from Congress under the\r\nname of dollars, did not come from that body always at that value.\r\nThose which were issued the first year, were equal to gold and silver.\r\nThe second year less; the third still less; and so on, for nearly the\r\nspace of five years; at the end of which, I imagine, that the whole\r\nvalue at which Congress might pay away the several emissions, taking\r\nthem together, was about ten or twelve millions pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nNow, as it would have taken ten or twelve millions sterling of taxes,\r\nto carry on the war for five years, and, as while this money was\r\nissuing and likewise depreciating down to nothing, there were none, or\r\nvery few valuable taxes paid; consequently the event to the public was\r\nthe same, whether they sunk ten or twelve millions of expended money,\r\nby depreciation, or paid ten or twelve millions by taxation; for as\r\nthey did not do both, and chose to do one, the matter, in a general\r\nview, was indifferent. And therefore, what the Abbe supposes to be a\r\ndebt, has now no existence; it having been paid, by every body\r\nconsenting to reduce it, at his own expence, from the value of the\r\nbills continually passing among themselves, a sum, equal to nearly\r\nwhat the expence of the war was for five years.\r\n\r\nAgain.--The paper money having now ceased, and the depreciation with\r\nit, and gold and silver supplied its place, the war will now be\r\ncarried on by taxation, which will draw from the public a considerable\r\nless sum than what the depreciation drew; but as, while they pay the\r\nformer, they do not suffer the latter, and as, when they suffered the\r\nlatter, they did not pay the former, the thing will be nearly equal,\r\nwith this moral advantage, that taxation occasions frugality and\r\nthought, and depreciation produced dissipation and carelessness.\r\n\r\nAnd again.--If a man's portion of taxes comes to less than what he\r\nlost by the depreciation, it proves the alteration is in his favour.\r\nIf it comes to more, and he is justly assessed, it shews that he did\r\nnot sustain his proper share of depreciation, because the one was as\r\noperatively his tax as the other.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that it never was intended, neither was it foreseen, that\r\nthe debt contained in the paper currency should sink itself in this\r\nmanner; but as by the voluntary conduct of all and of everyone it has\r\narrived at this fate, the debt is paid by those who owed it. Perhaps\r\nnothing was ever so much the act of a country as this. Government had\r\nno hand in it. Every man depreciated his own money by his own consent,\r\nfor such was the effect which the raising of the nominal value of\r\ngoods produced. But as by such reduction he sustained a loss equal to\r\nwhat he must have paid to sink it by taxation; therefore the line of\r\njustice is to consider his loss by the depreciation as his tax for\r\nthat time, and not to tax him when the war is over, to make that money\r\ngood in any other person's hands, which became nothing in his own.\r\n\r\nAgain.--The paper currency was issued for the express purpose of\r\ncarrying on the war. It has performed that service, without any other\r\nmaterial change to the public, while it lasted. But to suppose, as\r\nsome did, that at the end of the war, it was to grow into gold and\r\nsilver, or become equal thereto, was to suppose that we were to _get_\r\ntwo hundred millions of dollars by _going to war_, instead of _paying_\r\nthe cost of carrying it on.\r\n\r\nBut if any thing in the situation of America, as to her currency or\r\nher circumstances, yet remains not understood, then let it be\r\nremembered, that this war is the public's war; the people's war; the\r\ncountry's war. It is _their_ independence that is to be supported;\r\n_their_ property that is to be secured; _their_ country that is to be\r\nsaved. Here, government, the army, and the people, are mutually and\r\nreciprocally one. In other wars, kings may lose their thrones and\r\ntheir dominions; but here, the loss must fall on the _majesty of the\r\nmultitude_, and the property they are contending to save. Every man\r\nbeing sensible of this, he goes to the field, or pays his portion of\r\nthe charge as the sovereign of his own possessions; and when he is\r\nconquered, a monarch falls.\r\n\r\nThe remark which the Abbe, in the conclusion of the passage, has made\r\nrespecting America contracting debts in the time of her prosperity (by\r\nwhich he means, before the breaking out of hostilities), serves to\r\nshew, though he has not yet made the application, the very great\r\ncommercial difference between a dependant and an independent country.\r\nIn a state of dependence, and with a fettered commerce, though with\r\nall the advantages of peace, her trade could not balance herself, and\r\nshe annually run into debt. But now, in a state of independence,\r\nthough involved in war, she requires no credit; her stores are full of\r\nmerchandise, and gold and silver are become the currency of the\r\ncountry. How these things have established themselves, it is difficult\r\nto account for: but they are facts, and facts are more powerful than\r\narguments.\r\n\r\nAs it is probable this letter will undergo a republication in Europe,\r\nthe remarks here thrown together will serve to show the extreme folly\r\nof Britain, in resting her hopes of success on the extinction of our\r\npaper currency. The expectation is at once so childish and forlorn,\r\nthat it places her in the laughable condition of a famished lion\r\nwatching for prey at a spider's web.\r\n\r\nFrom this account of the currency, the Abbe proceeds to state the\r\ncondition of America in the winter of 1777, and the spring following;\r\nand closes his observations with mentioning the treaty of alliance,\r\nwhich was signed in France, and the propositions of the British\r\nministry, which were rejected in America. But in the manner in which\r\nthe Abbe has arranged his facts, there is a very material error, that\r\nnot only he, but other European historians, have fallen into: none of\r\nthem having assigned the true cause why the British proposals were\r\nrejected, and all of them have assigned a wrong one.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1777, and spring following, Congress were assembled\r\nat York-Town, in Pennsylvania, the British were in possession of\r\nPhiladelphia, and General Washington with the army were encamped in\r\nhuts at the Valley-Forge, twenty-five miles distant therefrom. To all\r\nwho can remember, it was a season of hardship, but not of despair; and\r\nthe Abbe, speaking of this period and its inconveniences, says,\r\n\r\n\"A multitude of privations, added to so many other misfortunes, might\r\nmake the Americans regret their former tranquillity, and incline them\r\nto an accommodation with England. In vain had the people been bound to\r\nthe new Government by the sacredness of oaths, and the influence of\r\nreligion. In vain had endeavors been used to convince them, that it\r\nwas impossible to treat safely with a country in which one parliament\r\nmight overturn what should have been established by another. In vain\r\nhad they been threatened with the eternal resentment of an exasperated\r\nand vindictive enemy. It was possible that these distant troubles\r\nmight not be balanced by the weight of present evils.\r\n\r\n\"So thought the British ministry when they sent to the New World\r\npublic agents authorized to offer every thing except independence to\r\nthese very Americans, from whom they had two years before exacted an\r\nunconditional submission. It is not improbable, but that by this plan\r\nof conciliation, a few months sooner, some effect might have been\r\nproduced. But at the period at which it was proposed by the Court of\r\nLondon, it was rejected with disdain, because this measure appeared\r\nbut as an argument of fear and weakness. The people were already\r\nre-assured. The Congress, the Generals, the troops, the bold and\r\nskilful men in each colony, had possessed themselves of the authority;\r\nevery thing had recovered its first spirit. _This was the effect of a\r\ntreaty of friendship and commerce between the United States and the\r\nCourt of Versailles, signed the 8th of February, 1778._\"\r\n\r\nOn this passage of the Abbe's I cannot help remarking, that, to unite\r\ntime with circumstance, is a material nicety in history; the want of\r\nwhich frequently throws it into endless confusion and mistake,\r\noccasions a total separation between causes and consequences, and\r\nconnects them with others they are not immediately, and sometimes not\r\nat all, related to.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe, in saying that the offers of the British ministry \"were\r\nrejected with disdain,\" is _right_ as to the _fact_, but _wrong_ as to\r\nthe _time_; and this error in the time, has occasioned him to be\r\nmistaken in the cause.\r\n\r\nThe signing the treaty of Paris the 6th of February, 1778, could have\r\nno effect on the mind or politics of America, until it was _known in\r\nAmerica_; and therefore, when the Abbe says, that the rejection of the\r\nBritish offers was in consequence of the alliance, he must mean, that\r\nit was in consequence of the alliance _being known_ in America; which\r\nwas not the case: and by this mistake he not only takes from her the\r\nreputation, which her unshaken fortitude in that trying situation\r\ndeserves, but is likewise led very injuriously to suppose that had she\r\n_not known_ of the treaty, the offers would probably have been\r\naccepted; whereas she knew nothing of the treaty at the time of the\r\nrejection, and consequently did not reject them on that ground.\r\n\r\nThe propositions or offers above-mentioned, were contained in two\r\nbills brought into the British Parliament by Lord North, on the 17th\r\nof February, 1778. Those bills were hurried through both houses with\r\nunusual haste; and before they had gone through all the customary\r\nforms of Parliament, copies of them were sent over to Lord Howe and\r\nGeneral Howe, then in Philadelphia, who were likewise Commissioners.\r\nGeneral Howe ordered them to be printed in Philadelphia, and sent\r\ncopies of them by a flag to General Washington, to be forwarded to\r\nCongress at York-Town, where they arrived the 21st of April, 1778.\r\nThus much for the arrival of the bills in America.\r\n\r\nCongress, as is their usual mode, appointed a committee from their own\r\nbody, to examine them, and report thereon. The report was brought in\r\nthe next day (the twenty-second,) was read, and unanimously agreed to,\r\nentered on their journals, and published for the information of the\r\ncountry. Now this report must be the rejection to which the Abbe\r\nalludes, because Congress gave no other formal opinion on those bills\r\nand propositions: and on a subsequent application from the British\r\nCommissioners, dated the 27th of May, and received at York-Town the\r\n6th of June, Congress immediately referred them for an answer, to\r\ntheir printed resolves of the 22d of April.--Thus much for the\r\nrejection of the offers.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of May, that is, eleven days after the above rejection was\r\nmade, the treaty between the United States and France arrived at\r\nYork-Town; and until this moment Congress had not the least notice or\r\nidea, that such a measure was in any train of execution. But lest this\r\ndeclaration of mine should pass only for assertion, I shall support it\r\nby proof, for it is material to the character and principle of the\r\nrevolution to shew, that no condition of America, since the\r\ndeclaration of independence, however trying and severe, ever operated\r\nto produce the most distant idea of yielding it up either by force,\r\ndistress, artifice, or persuasion. And this proof is the more\r\nnecessary, because it was the system of the British ministry at this\r\ntime, as well as before and since, to hold out to the European powers\r\nthat America was unfixt in her resolutions and policy; hoping by this\r\nartifice to lessen her reputation in Europe, and weaken the confidence\r\nwhich those powers, or any of them, might be inclined to place in her.\r\n\r\nAt the time these matters were transacting, I was Secretary to the\r\nForeign Department of Congress. All the political letters from the\r\nAmerican Commissioners rested in my hands, and all that were\r\nofficially written went from my office; and so far from Congress\r\nknowing anything of the signing the treaty, at the time they rejected\r\nthe British offers, they had not received a line of information from\r\ntheir Commissioners at Paris on any subject whatever for upwards of a\r\ntwelvemonth. Probably the loss of the port of Philadelphia, and the\r\nnavigation of the Delaware, together with the danger of the seas,\r\ncovered at this time with British cruizers, contributed to the\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nOne packet, it is true, arrived at York-Town in January preceding,\r\nwhich was about three months before the arrival of the treaty; but,\r\nstrange as it may appear, every letter had been taken out, before it\r\nwas put on board the vessel which brought it from France, and blank\r\nwhite paper put in their stead.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the time when the proposals from the British\r\nCommissioners were first received, and likewise the time when the\r\ntreaty of alliance arrived, and shewn that the rejection of the former\r\nwas eleven days prior to the arrival of the latter, and without the\r\nleast knowledge of such circumstance having taken place, or being\r\nabout to take place; the rejection, therefore, must, and ought to be\r\nattributed to the fixt, unvaried sentiments of America respecting the\r\nenemy she is at war with, and her determination to support her\r\nindependence to the last possible effort, and not to any new\r\ncircumstance in her favour, which at that time she did not, and could\r\nnot, know of.\r\n\r\nBesides, there is a vigor of determination and spirit of defiance in\r\nthe language of the rejection (which I here subjoin), which derive\r\ntheir greatest glory by appearing before the treaty was known; for\r\nthat, which is bravery in distress, becomes insult in prosperity: And\r\nthe treaty placed America on such a strong foundation, that had she\r\nthen known it, the answer which she gave would have appeared rather as\r\nan air of triumph, than as the glowing serenity of fortitude.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the Abbe appears to have entirely mistaken the matter;\r\nfor instead of attributing the rejection of the propositions to our\r\nknowledge of the treaty of alliance; he should have attributed the\r\norigin of them in the British cabinet, to their knowledge of that\r\nevent. And then the reason why they were hurried over to America in\r\nthe state of bills, that is, before they were passed into acts, is\r\neasily accounted for, which is that they might have the chance of\r\nreaching America before any knowledge of the treaty should arrive,\r\nwhich they were lucky enough to do, and there met the fate they so\r\nrichly merited. That these bills were brought into the British\r\nParliament after the treaty with France was signed, is proved from the\r\ndates: the treaty being on the 6th and the bills the 17th of February.\r\nAnd that the signing the treaty was known in Parliament, when the\r\nbills were brought in, is likewise proved by a speech of Mr. Charles\r\nFox, on the said 17th of February, who, in reply to Lord North,\r\ninformed the House of the treaty being signed, and challenged the\r\nMinister's knowledge of the same fact.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn CONGRESS, April 22d, 1778.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee to whom was referred the General's Letter of the 18th,\r\ncontaining a certain printed paper sent from Philadelphia, purporting\r\nto be the draught of a Bill for declaring the _intentions_ of the\r\nParliament of Great Britain, as to the _exercise_ of what they are\r\npleased to term their _right_ of imposing taxes within these United\r\nStates; and also the draft of a Bill to enable the King of\r\nGreat-Britain to appoint Commissioners, with powers to treat, consult,\r\nand agree upon the means of quieting certain disorders within the said\r\nStates, beg leave to observe,\r\n\r\n\"That the said paper being industriously circulated by emissaries of\r\nthe enemy, in a partial and secret manner, the same ought to be\r\nforthwith printed for the public information.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee cannot ascertain whether the contents of the said paper\r\nhave been framed in Philadelphia or in Great Britain, much less\r\nwhether the same are really and truly intended to be brought into the\r\nParliament of that kingdom, or whether the said Parliament will confer\r\nthereon the usual solemnities of their laws. But are inclined to\r\nbelieve this will happen, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\"1st. Because their General hath made divers feeble efforts to set on\r\nfoot some kind of treaty during the last winter, though either from a\r\nmistaken idea of his own dignity and importance, the want of\r\ninformation, or some other cause, he hath not made application to\r\nthose who are invested with a proper authority.\r\n\r\n\"2dly. Because they suppose that the fallacious idea of a cessation of\r\nhostilities will render these States remiss in their preparations for\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"3dly. Because believing the Americans wearied with war, they suppose\r\nwe will accede to the terms for the sake of peace.\r\n\r\n\"4thly. Because they suppose that our negotiations may be subject to a\r\nlike corrupt influence with their debates.\r\n\r\n\"5thly. Because they expect from this step the same effects they did\r\nfrom what one of their ministers thought proper to call his\r\n_conciliatory motion_, viz. that it will prevent foreign powers from\r\ngiving aid to these States; that it will lead their own subjects to\r\ncontinue a little longer the present war; and that it will detach some\r\nweak men in America from the cause of freedom and virtue.\r\n\r\n\"6thly. Because their King, from his own shewing hath reason to\r\napprehend that his fleets and armies, instead of being employed\r\nagainst the territories of these States, will be necessary for the\r\ndefence of his own dominions. And,\r\n\r\n\"7thly. Because the impracticability of subjugating this country,\r\nbeing every day more and more manifest, it is their interest to\r\nextricate themselves from the war upon any terms.\r\n\r\n\"The Committee beg leave further to observe, That, upon a supposition,\r\nthe matters contained in the said paper will really go into the\r\nBritish Statute Book, they serve to shew, in a clear point of view,\r\nthe weakness and wickedness of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"THEIR WEAKNESS,\r\n\r\n\"1st. Because they formerly declared, not only that they had a right\r\nto bind the inhabitants of these States in all cases whatsoever, but\r\nalso that the said inhabitants should _absolutely_ and\r\n_unconditionally_ submit to the exercise of that right. And this\r\nsubmission they have endeavored to exact by the sword. Receding from\r\nthis claim, therefore, under the present circumstances, shews their\r\ninability to enforce it.\r\n\r\n\"2dly. Because their Prince had heretofore rejected the humblest\r\npetitions of the Representatives of America, praying to be considered\r\nas subjects, and protected in the enjoyment of peace, liberty, and\r\nsafety; and hath waged a most cruel war against them, and employed the\r\nsavages to butcher innocent women and children. But now the same\r\nPrince pretends to treat with those very Representatives, and grant\r\nto the _arms_ of America what he refused to her _prayers_.\r\n\r\n\"3dly. Because they have uniformly laboured to conquer this Continent,\r\nrejecting every idea of accommodation proposed to them, from a\r\nconfidence in their own strength. Wherefore it is evident, from the\r\nchange in their mode of attack, that they have lost this confidence.\r\nAnd,\r\n\r\n\"4thly. Because the constant language, spoken not only by their\r\nMinisters, but by the most public and authentic acts of the nation,\r\nhath been, that it is incompatible with their dignity to treat with\r\nthe Americans while they have arms in their hands. Notwithstanding\r\nwhich, an offer is now about to be made for treaty.\r\n\r\n\"The wickedness and insincerity of the enemy appear from the following\r\nconsiderations:\r\n\r\n\"1st. Either the _Bills_ now to be passed contain a direct or indirect\r\ncession of a part of their former claims, or they do not. If they do,\r\nthen it is acknowledged that they have sacrificed many brave men in an\r\nunjust quarrel. If they do not, then they are calculated to deceive\r\nAmerica into terms, to which neither argument before the war, nor\r\nforce since, could procure her assent.\r\n\r\n\"2dly. The first of these _Bills_ appears, from the title, to be a\r\ndeclaration of the _intentions_ of the British Parliament concerning\r\nthe exercise of the _right of imposing taxes_ within these States.\r\nWherefore, should these States treat under the said Bill, they would\r\nindirectly acknowledge that right, to obtain which acknowledgment the\r\npresent war has been avowedly undertaken and prosecuted, on the part\r\nof Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"3dly. Should such pretended right be so acquiesced in, then of\r\nconsequence the same might be exercised whenever the British\r\nParliament should find themselves in a different _temper_ and\r\n_disposition_; since it must depend upon those, and such like\r\ncontingencies, how far men will act according to their former\r\n_intentions_.\r\n\r\n\"4thly. The said first Bill, in the body thereof, containeth no new\r\nmatter, but is precisely the same with the motion before mentioned,\r\nand liable to all the objections which lay against the said motion,\r\nexcepting the following particular, viz. that _by the motion_, actual\r\ntaxation was to be suspended, so long as America should give as much\r\nas the said Parliament might think proper: whereas, _by the proposed\r\nBill_, it is to be suspended as long as future Parliaments continue of\r\nthe same mind with the present.\r\n\r\n\"5thly. From the second Bill it appears, that the British King may, if\r\nhe pleases, appoint Commissioners to _treat_ and _agree_ with those,\r\nwhom they please, about a variety of things therein mentioned. But\r\nsuch treaties and agreements are to be of no validity without the\r\nconcurrence of the said Parliament, except so far as they relate to\r\nthe suspension of hostilities, and of certain of their acts, the\r\ngranting of pardons, and the appointment of Governors to these\r\nsovereign, free, and independent States. Wherefore, the said\r\nParliament have reserved to themselves, in _express words_, the power\r\nof setting aside any such treaty, and taking the advantages of any\r\ncircumstances which may arise to subject this Continent to their\r\nusurpations.\r\n\r\n\"6thly, The said Bill, by holding forth a tender of pardon, implies a\r\ncriminality in our justifiable resistance, and consequently, to treat\r\nunder it, would be an implied acknowledgment, that the inhabitants of\r\nthese States were, what Britain had declared them to be, _Rebels_.\r\n\r\n\"7thly. The inhabitants of these States being claimed by them as\r\nsubjects, they may infer, from the nature of the negotiation now\r\npretended to be set on foot, that the said inhabitants would of right\r\nbe afterwards bound by such laws as they should make. Wherefore, any\r\nagreement entered into on such negociation might at any future time be\r\nrepealed. And,\r\n\r\n\"8thly. Because the said Bill purports, that the Commissioners therein\r\nmentioned may treat with private individuals; a measure highly\r\nderogatory to the dignity of the national character.\r\n\r\n\"From all which it appears evident to your Committee, that the said\r\nBills are intended to operate upon the hopes and fears of the good\r\npeople of these States, so as to create divisions among them, and a\r\ndefection from the common cause, now by the blessing of Divine\r\nProvidence drawing near to a favourable issue. That they are the\r\nsequel of that insidious plan, which from the days of the Stamp-act\r\ndown to the present time, hath involved this country in contention and\r\nbloodshed. And that, as in other cases so in this, although\r\ncircumstances may force them at times to recede from the unjustifiable\r\nclaims, there can be no doubt but they will as heretofore, upon the\r\nfirst favourable occasion, again display that lust of domination,\r\nwhich hath rent in twain the mighty empire of Britain.\r\n\r\n\"Upon the whole matter, the Committee beg leave to report it as their\r\nopinion, that as the Americans united in this arduous contest upon\r\nprinciples of common interest, for the defence of common rights and\r\nprivileges, which union hath been cemented by common calamities, and\r\nby mutual good offices and and [_sic_] affection, so the great cause\r\nfor which they contend, and in which all mankind are interested, must\r\nderive its success from the continuance of that union. Wherefore any\r\nman or body of men, who should presume to make any seperate or partial\r\nconvention or agreement with Commissioners under the Crown of Great\r\nBritain, or any of them, ought to be considered and treated as open\r\nand avowed enemies of these United States.\r\n\r\n\"And further your Committee beg leave to report it as their opinion,\r\nThat these united States cannot, with propriety, hold any conference\r\nor treaty with _any_ Commissioners on the part of Great Britain,\r\nunless they shall, as a preliminary thereto, either withdraw their\r\nfleets and admirals, or else, in positive and express terms,\r\nacknowledge the Independence of the said States.\r\n\r\n\"And inasmuch as it appears to be the design of the enemies of these\r\nStates to lull them into a fatal security--to the end that they may\r\nact with a, becoming weight and importance, it is the opinion of your\r\nCommittee That the several States be called upon to use the most\r\nstrenuous exertions to have their respective quotas of continental\r\ntroops in the field as soon as possible, and that all the militia of\r\nthe said States be held in readiness, to act as occasion may require.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The following is the answer of Congress to the second application of\r\nthe Commissioners._\r\n\r\n    SIR,\r\n\r\n    _York-Town, June 6, 1778._\r\n\r\n    \"I HAVE had the honour of laying your letter of the 3d instant,\r\n    with the acts of the British Parliament which came inclosed,\r\n    before Congress; and I am instructed to acquaint you, Sir, that\r\n    they have already expressed their sentiments upon bills, not\r\n    essentially different from those acts, in a publication of the\r\n    22d of April last.\r\n\r\n    \"Be assured, Sir, when the King of Great Britain shall be\r\n    seriously disposed to put an end to the unprovoked and cruel war\r\n    waged against these United States, Congress will readily attend\r\n    to such terms of peace, as may consist with the honour of\r\n    independent nations, the interest of their constituents, and the\r\n    sacred regard they mean to pay to treaties. I have the honour to\r\n    be, Sir,\r\n\r\n    _Your most obedient, and\r\n    most humble servant_,\r\n    HENRY LAURENS,\r\n    _President of Congress_.\"\r\n\r\n    _His Excellency,\r\n    Sir Henry Clinton, K.B., Philad_.\r\n\r\nThough I am not surprised to see the Abbe mistaken in matters of\r\nhistory, acted at so great a distance from his sphere of immediate\r\nobservation, yet I am more than surprised to find him wrong, (or at\r\nleast what appears so to me) in the well-enlightened field of\r\nphilosophical reflection. Here the materials are his own; created by\r\nhimself; and the error, therefore, is an act of the mind. Hitherto my\r\nremarks have been confined to circumstances: the order in which they\r\narose, and the events they produced. In these, my information being\r\nbetter than the Abbe's, my task was easy. How I may succeed in\r\ncontroverting matters of sentiment and opinion, with one whom years,\r\nexperience, and long established reputation have placed in a superior\r\nline, I am less confident in; but as they fall within the scope of my\r\nobservations, it would be improper to pass them over.\r\n\r\nFrom this part of the Abbe's work to the latter end, I find several\r\nexpressions which appear to me to start, with a cynical complexion,\r\nfrom the path of liberal thinking, or at least they are so involved as\r\nto lose many of the beauties which distinguish other parts of the\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nThe Abbe having brought his work to the period when the treaty of\r\nalliance between France and the United States commenced, proceeds to\r\nmake some remarks thereon.\r\n\r\n\"In short,\" says he, \"philosophy, whose first sentiment is the desire\r\nto see all governments just, and all people happy, in casting her eyes\r\nupon this alliance of a monarchy, with a people who are defending\r\ntheir liberty, _is curious to know its motive. She sees at once too\r\nclearly, that the happiness of mankind has no part in it_.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever train of thinking or of temper the Abbe might be in, when he\r\npenned this expression, matters not. They will neither qualify the\r\nsentiment, nor add to its defect. If right, it needs no apology; if\r\nwrong, it merits no excuse. It is sent to the world as an opinion of\r\nphilosophy, and may be examined without regard to the author.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a defect, connected with ingenuity, that it often\r\nemploys itself more in matters of curiosity than usefulness. Man must\r\nbe the privy councillor of fate, or something is not right. He must\r\nknow the springs, the whys, and wherefores of every thing, or he sits\r\ndown unsatisfied. Whether this be a crime, or only a caprice of\r\nhumanity, I am not enquiring into. I shall take the passage as I find\r\nit, and place my objections against it.\r\n\r\nIt is not so properly the _motives_ which _produced_ the alliance, as\r\nthe _consequences_ which are to be _produced from it_, that mark out\r\nthe field of philosophical reflection. In the one we only penetrate\r\ninto the barren cave of secrecy, where little can be known, and every\r\nthing may be misconceived; in the other, the mind is presented with a\r\nwide extended prospect, of vegetative good, and sees a thousand\r\nblessings budding into existence.\r\n\r\nBut the expression, even within the compass of the Abbe's meaning,\r\nsets out with an error, because it is made to declare that, which no\r\nman has authority to declare. Who can say that the happiness of\r\nmankind made _no part of the motives_ which produced the alliance? To\r\nbe able to declare this, a man must be possessed of the mind of all\r\nthe parties concerned, and know that their motives were something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the independence of America became contemplated and\r\nunderstood, the local advantages of it to the immediate actors, and\r\nthe numerous benefits it promised to mankind, appear to be every day\r\nencreasing, and we saw not a temporary good for the present race only,\r\nbut a continued good to all posterity; these motives, therefore, added\r\nto those which preceded them, became the motives, on the part of\r\nAmerica, which led her to propose and agree to the treaty of alliance,\r\nas the best effectual method of extending and securing happiness; and\r\ntherefore, with respect to us, the Abbe is wrong.\r\n\r\nFrance, on the other hand, was situated very differently to America.\r\nShe was not acted upon by necessity to seek a friend, and therefore\r\nher motive in becoming one, has the strongest evidence of being good,\r\nand that which is so, must have some happiness for its object. With\r\nregard to herself she saw a train of conveniencies worthy her\r\nattention. By lessening the power of an enemy, whom, at the same\r\ntime, she sought neither to destroy nor distress, she gained an\r\nadvantage without doing an evil, and created to herself a new friend\r\nby associating with a country in misfortune. The springs of thought\r\nthat lead to actions of this kind, however political they may be, are\r\nnevertheless naturally beneficent; for in all causes, good or bad, it\r\nis necessary there should be a fitness in the mind, to enable it to\r\nact in character with the object: Therefore, as a bad cause cannot be\r\nprosecuted with a good motive, so neither can a good cause be long\r\nsupported by a bad one, as no man acts without a motive; therefore, in\r\nthe present instance, as they cannot be bad, they must be admitted to\r\nbe good. But the Abbe sets out upon such an extended scale, that he\r\noverlooks the degrees by which it is measured, and rejects the\r\nbeginning of good, because the end comes not at once.\r\n\r\nIt is true that bad motives may in some degree be brought to support a\r\ngood cause or prosecute a good object; but it never continues long,\r\nwhich is not the case with France; for either the object will reform\r\nthe mind, or the mind corrupt the object, or else not being able,\r\neither way, to get into unison, they will separate in disgust: And\r\nthis natural, though unperceived progress of association or contention\r\nbetween the mind and the object, is the secret cause of fidelity or\r\ndefection. Every object a man pursues is, for the time, a kind of\r\nmistress to his mind: if both are good or bad, the union is natural;\r\nbut if they are in reverse, and neither can seduce nor yet reform the\r\nother, the opposition grows into dislike, and a separation follows.\r\n\r\nWhen the cause of America first made her appearance on the stage of\r\nthe universe, there were many who, in the style of adventurers and\r\nfortune-hunters, were dangling in her train, and making their court to\r\nher with every profession of honour and attachment. They were loud in\r\nher praise, and ostentatious in her service. Every place echoed with\r\ntheir ardour or their anger, and they seemed like men in love.--But,\r\nalas, they were fortune-hunters. Their expectations were excited, but\r\ntheir minds were unimpressed; and finding her not to the purpose, nor\r\nthemselves reformed by her influence, they ceased their suit, and in\r\nsome instances deserted and betrayed her.\r\n\r\nThere were others, who at first beheld her with indifference, and\r\nunacquainted with her character, were cautious of her company. They\r\ntreated her as one, who, under the fair name of liberty, might conceal\r\nthe hideous figure of anarchy, or the gloomy monster of tyranny. They\r\nknew not what she was. If fair, she was fair indeed. But still she was\r\nsuspected, and though born among us, appeared to be a stranger.\r\n\r\nAccident, with some, and curiosity with others, brought on a distant\r\nacquaintance. They ventured to look at her. They felt an inclination\r\nto speak to her. One intimacy led to another, till the suspicion wore\r\naway, and a change of sentiment stole gradually upon the mind; and\r\nhaving no self-interest to serve, no passion of dishonour to gratify,\r\nthey became enamoured of her innocence, and unaltered by misfortune or\r\nuninflamed by success, shared with fidelity in the varieties of her\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThis declaration of the Abbe's, respecting motives, has led me\r\nunintendedly into a train of metaphysical reasoning; but there was no\r\nother avenue by which it could so properly be approached. To place\r\npresumption against presumption, assertion against assertion, is a\r\nmode of opposition that has no effect; and therefore the more eligible\r\nmethod was, to shew that the declaration does not correspond with the\r\nnatural progress of the mind, and the influence it has upon our\r\nconduct.--I shall now quit this part, and proceed to what I have\r\nbefore stated, namely, that it is not so properly the motives which\r\nproduced the alliance, as the consequences to be produced from it,\r\nthat mark out the field of philosophical reflections.\r\n\r\nIt is an observation I have already made in some former publication,\r\nthat the circle of civilization is yet incomplete. A mutuality of\r\nwants have formed the individuals of each country into a kind of\r\nnational society, and here the progress of civilization has stopt.\r\nFor it is easy to see, that nations with regard to each other\r\n(notwithstanding the ideal civil law, which every one explains as it\r\nsuits him) are like individuals in a state of nature. They are\r\nregulated by no fixt principle, governed by no compulsive law, and\r\neach does independently what it pleases, or what it can.\r\n\r\nWere it possible we could have known the world when in a state of\r\nbarbarism, we might have concluded, that it never could be brought\r\ninto the order we now see it. The untamed mind was then as hard, if\r\nnot harder to work upon in its individual state, than the national\r\nmind is in its present one. Yet we have seen the accomplishment of the\r\none, why then should we doubt that of the other?\r\n\r\nThere is a greater fitness in mankind to extend and complete the\r\ncivilization of nations with each other at this day, than there was to\r\nbegin it with the unconnected individuals at first; in the same manner\r\nthat it is somewhat easier to put together the materials of a machine\r\nafter they are formed, than it was to form them from original matter.\r\nThe present condition of the world, differing so exceedingly from what\r\nit formerly was, has given a new cast to the mind of man, more than\r\nwhat he appears to be sensible of. The wants of the individual, which\r\nfirst produced the idea of society, are now augmented into the wants\r\nof the nation, and he is obliged to seek from another country what\r\nbefore he sought from the next person.\r\n\r\nLetters, the tongue of the world, have in some measure brought all\r\nmankind acquainted, and, by an extension of their uses, are every day\r\npromoting some new friendship. Through them distant nations became\r\ncapable of conversation, and losing by degrees the awkwardness of\r\nstrangers, and the moroseness of suspicion, they learn to know and\r\nunderstand each other. Science, the partizan of no country, but the\r\nbeneficent patroness of all, has liberally opened a temple where all\r\nmay meet. Her influence on the mind, like the sun on the chilled\r\nearth, has long been preparing it for higher cultivation and further\r\nimprovement. The philosopher of one country sees not an enemy in the\r\nphilosopher of another: he takes his seat in the temple of science,\r\nand asks not who sits beside him.\r\n\r\nThis was not the condition of the barbarian world. Then the wants of\r\nman were few, and the objects within his reach. While he could acquire\r\nthese, he lived in a state of individual independence; the consequence\r\nof which was, there were as many nations as persons, each contending\r\nwith the other, to secure something which he had, or to obtain\r\nsomething which he had not. The world had then no business to follow,\r\nno studies to exercise the mind. Their time was divided between sloth\r\nand fatigue. Hunting and war were their chief occupations; sleep and\r\nfood their principal enjoyments.\r\n\r\nNow it is otherwise. A change in the mode of life has made it\r\nnecessary to be busy; and man finds a thousand things to do now which\r\nbefore he did not. Instead of placing his ideas of greatness in the\r\nrude achievements of the savage, he studies arts, science,\r\nagriculture, and commerce, the refinements of the gentleman, the\r\nprinciples of society, and the knowledge of the philosopher.\r\n\r\nThere are many things which in themselves are morally neither good nor\r\nbad, but they are productive of consequences, which are strongly\r\nmarked with one or other of these characters. Thus commerce, though in\r\nitself a moral nullity, has had a considerable influence in tempering\r\nthe human mind. It was the want of objects in the ancient world, which\r\noccasioned in them such a rude and perpetual turn for war. Their time\r\nhung upon their hands without the means of employment. The indolence\r\nthey lived in afforded leisure for mischief, and being all idle at\r\nonce, and equal in their circumstances, they were easily provoked or\r\ninduced to action.\r\n\r\nBut the introduction of commerce furnished the world with objects,\r\nwhich in their extent, reach every man, and give him something to\r\nthink about and something to do; by these his attention his [_sic_]\r\nmechanically drawn from the pursuits which a state of indolence and an\r\nunemployed mind occasioned, and he trades with the same countries,\r\nwhich former ages, tempted by their productions, and too indolent to\r\npurchase them, would have gone to war with.\r\n\r\nThus, as I have already observed, the condition of the world being\r\nmaterially changed by the influence of science and commerce, it is put\r\ninto a fitness not only to admit of, but to desire an extension of\r\ncivilization. The principal and almost only remaining enemy it now has\r\nto encounter, is _prejudice_; for it is evidently the interest of\r\nmankind to agree and make the best of life. The world has undergone\r\nits divisions of empire, the several boundaries of which are known and\r\nsettled. The idea of conquering countries, like the Greeks and Romans,\r\ndoes not now exist; and experience has exploded the notion of going to\r\nwar for the sake of profit. In short, the objects for war are\r\nexceedingly diminished, and there is now left scarcely any thing to\r\nquarrel about, but what arises from that demon of society, prejudice,\r\nand the consequent sullenness and untractableness of the temper.\r\n\r\nThere is something exceedingly curious in the constitution and\r\noperation of prejudice. It has the singular ability of accommodating\r\nitself to all the possible varieties of the human mind. Some passions\r\nand vices are but thinly scattered among mankind, and find only here\r\nand there a fitness of reception. But prejudice, like the spider,\r\nmakes every where its home. It has neither taste nor choice of place,\r\nand all that it requires is room. There is scarcely a situation,\r\nexcept fire or water, in which a spider will not live. So, let the\r\nmind be as naked as the walls of an empty and forsaken tenement,\r\ngloomy as a dungeon, or ornamented with the richest abilities of\r\nthinking; let it be hot, cold, dark, or light, lonely or inhabited,\r\nstill prejudice, if undisturbed, will fill it with cobwebs, and live,\r\nlike the spider, where there seems nothing to live on. If the one\r\nprepares her food by poisoning it to her palate and her use, the other\r\ndoes the same; and as several of our passions are strongly charactered\r\nby the animal world, prejudice may be denominated the spider of the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no two events ever united so intimately and forceably to\r\ncombat and expel prejudice, as the Revolution of America, and the\r\nAlliance with France. Their effects are felt, and their influence\r\nalready extends as well to the old world as the new. Our style and\r\nmanner of thinking have undergone a revolution, more extraordinary\r\nthan the political revolution of the country. We see with other eyes;\r\nwe hear with other ears; and think with other thoughts, than those we\r\nformerly used. We can look back on our own prejudices, as if they had\r\nbeen the prejudices of other people. We now see and know they were\r\nprejudices, and nothing else; and relieved from their shackles, enjoy\r\na freedom of mind we felt not before. It was not all the argument,\r\nhowever powerful, nor all the reasoning, however elegant, that could\r\nhave produced this change, so necessary to the extension of the mind\r\nand the cordiality of the world, without the two circumstances of the\r\nRevolution and the Alliance.\r\n\r\nHad America dropt quietly from Britain, no material change in\r\nsentiment had taken place. The same notions, prejudices, and conceits,\r\nwould have governed in both countries, as governed them before; and,\r\nstill the slaves of error and education, they would have travelled on\r\nin the beaten tract of vulgar and habitual thinking. But brought about\r\nby the means it has been, both with regard to ourselves, to France,\r\nand to England, every corner of the mind is swept of its cobwebs,\r\npoison, and dust, and made fit for the reception of general happiness.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there never was an alliance on a broader basis, than that\r\nbetween America and France, and the progress of it is worth attending\r\nto. The countries had been enemies, not properly of themselves, but\r\nthrough the medium of England. They, originally, had no quarrel with\r\neach other, nor any cause for one, but what arose from the interest of\r\nEngland, and her arming America against France. At the same time, the\r\nAmericans, at a distance from and unacquainted with the world, and\r\ntutored in all the prejudices which governed those who governed them,\r\nconceived it their duty to act as they were taught. In doing this\r\nthey expended their substance to make conquests, not for themselves,\r\nbut for their masters, who in return, treated them as slaves.\r\n\r\nA long succession of insolent severity, and the separation finally\r\noccasioned by the commencement of hostilities at Lexington, on the\r\n19th of April, 1775, naturally produced a new disposition of thinking.\r\nAs the mind closed itself towards England, it opened itself toward the\r\nworld; and our prejudices, like our oppressions, underwent, though\r\nless observed, a mental examination; until we found the former as\r\ninconsistent with reason and benevolence, as the latter were repugnant\r\nto our civil and political rights.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus advancing by degrees into the wide field of\r\nextended humanity, the alliance with France was concluded; an alliance\r\nnot formed for the mere purpose of a day, but on just and generous\r\ngrounds, and with equal and mutual advantages; and the easy\r\naffectionate manner in which the parties have since communicated, has\r\nmade it an alliance, not of courts only, but of countries. There is\r\nnow an union of mind as well as of interest; and our hearts as well as\r\nour prosperity, call on us to support it.\r\n\r\nThe people of England not having experienced this change, had likewise\r\nno ideas of it, they were hugging to their bosoms the same prejudices\r\nwe were trampling beneath our feet; and they expected to keep a hold\r\nupon America, by that narrowness of thinking which America disdained.\r\nWhat they were proud of, we despised: and this is a principal cause\r\nwhy all their negotiations, constructed on this ground, have failed.\r\nWe are now really another people, and cannot again go back to\r\nignorance and prejudice. The mind once enlightened cannot again become\r\ndark. There is no possibility, neither is there any term to express\r\nthe supposition by, of the mind unknowing any thing it already knows;\r\nand therefore all attempts on the part of England, fitted to the\r\nformer habit of America, and on the expectation of their applying now,\r\nwill be like persuading a seeing man to become blind, and a sensible\r\none to turn an idiot. The first of which is unnatural and the other\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAs to the remark which the Abbe makes on the one country being a\r\nmonarchy and the other a republic, it can have no essential meaning.\r\nForms of government have nothing to do with treaties. The former are\r\nthe internal police of the countries severally; the latter their\r\nexternal police jointly: and so long as each performs its part, we\r\nhave no more right or business to know how the one or the other\r\nconducts its domestic affairs, than we have to inquire into the\r\nprivate concerns of a family.\r\n\r\nBut had the Abbe reflected for a moment, he would have seen that\r\ncourts, or the governing powers of all countries, be their forms what\r\nthey may, are relatively republics with each other. It is the first\r\nand true principle of alliancing. Antiquity may have given precedence,\r\nand power will naturally create importance, but their equal right is\r\nnever disputed. It may likewise be worthy of remarking, that a\r\nmonarchical country can suffer nothing in its popular happiness by an\r\nalliance with a republican one; and republican governments have never\r\nbeen destroyed by their external connections, but by some internal\r\nconvulsion or contrivance. France has been in alliance with the\r\nrepublic of Switzerland for more than two hundred years, and still\r\nSwitzerland retains her original form as entire as if she had allied\r\nwith a republic like herself; therefore this remark of the Abbe should\r\ngo for nothing.--Besides, it is best mankind should mix. There is ever\r\nsomething to learn, either of manners or principle; and it is by a\r\nfree communication, without regard to domestic matters, that\r\nfriendship is to be extended, and prejudice destroyed all over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the Abbe's high professions in favour of liberty,\r\nhe appears sometimes to forget himself, or that his theory is rather\r\nthe child of his fancy than of his judgment: for in almost the same\r\ninstant that he censures the alliance, as not originally or\r\nsufficiently calculated for the happiness of mankind, he, by a figure\r\nof implication, accuses France for having acted so generously and\r\nunreservedly in concluding it. \"Why did they (says he, meaning the\r\nCourt of France) tie themselves down by an inconsiderate treaty to\r\nconditions with the Congress, which they might themselves have held in\r\ndependence by ample and regular supplies.\"\r\n\r\nWhen an author undertakes to treat of public happiness, he ought to be\r\ncertain that he does not mistake passion for right, nor imagination\r\nfor principle. Principle, like truth, needs no contrivance. It will\r\never tell its own tale, and tell it the same way. But where this is\r\nnot the case, every page must be watched, recollected, and compared\r\nlike an invented story.\r\n\r\nI am surprised at this passage of the Abbe. It means nothing or it\r\nmeans ill; and in any case it shows the great difference between\r\nspeculative and practical knowledge. A treaty according to the Abbe's\r\nlanguage would have neither duration nor affection; it might have\r\nlasted to the end of the war, and then expired with it.--But France,\r\nby acting in a style superior to the little politics of narrow\r\nthinking, has established a generous fame, and won the love of a\r\ncountry she was before a stranger to. She had to treat with a people\r\nwho thought as nature taught them; and, on her own part, she wisely\r\nsaw there was no present advantage to be obtained by unequal terms,\r\nwhich could balance the more lasting ones that might flow from a kind\r\nand generous beginning.\r\n\r\nFrom this part the Abbe advances into the secret transactions of the\r\ntwo Cabinets of Versailles and Madrid, respecting the independence of\r\nAmerica, through which I mean not to follow him. It is a circumstance\r\nsufficiently striking, without being commented on, that the former\r\nunion of America with Britain, produced a power, which, in her hands,\r\nhad was becoming dangerous to the world: and there is no improbability\r\nin supposing, that had the latter known as much of the strength of\r\nformer, before she began the quarrel, as she has known since, that\r\ninstead of attempting to reduce her to unconditional submission, would\r\nhave proposed to her the conquest of Mexico. But from the countries\r\nseparately, Spain has nothing to apprehend, though from their union,\r\nshe had more to fear than any other power in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe part which I shall more particularly confine myself to, is that,\r\nwherein the Abbe takes an opportunity of complimenting the British\r\nMinistry with high encomiums of admiration, on their rejecting the\r\noffered mediation of the Court of Madrid, in 1779.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, that before Spain joined France in the War, she\r\nundertook the office of a mediator, and made proposals to the British\r\nKing and Ministry so exceedingly favourable to their interest, that\r\nhad they been accepted, would have become inconvenient, if not\r\ninadmissible to America. These proposals were nevertheless rejected by\r\nthe British Cabinet: on which the Abbe says,--\r\n\r\n\"It is in such a circumstance as this, it is in the time when noble\r\npride elevates the soul superior to all terror; when nothing is seen\r\nmore dreadful than the shame of receiving the law, and when there is\r\nno doubt or hesitation which to chuse, between ruin and dishonour; it\r\nis then, that the greatness of a nation is displayed. I acknowledge,\r\nhowever, that men accustomed to judge of things by the event, call\r\ngreat and perilous resolutions, heroism or madness, according to the\r\ngood or bad success with which they have been attended. If then I\r\nshould be asked, what is the name which shall in years to come be\r\ngiven to the firmness, which was in this moment exhibited by the\r\nEnglish, I shall answer, that I do not know. But that which it\r\ndeserves I know. I know that the annals of the world hold out to us\r\nbut rarely the august and majestic spectacle of a nation, which chuses\r\nrather to renounce its duration than its glory.\"\r\n\r\nIn this paragraph the conception is lofty, and the expression elegant;\r\nbut the colouring is too high for the original, and the likeness fails\r\nthrough an excess of graces. To fit the powers of thinking and the\r\nturn of language to the subject, so as to bring out a clear conclusion\r\nthat shall hit the point in question, and nothing else, is the true\r\ncriterion of writing. But the greater part of the Abbe's writings (if\r\nhe will pardon me the remark) appear to me uncentral and burthened\r\nwith variety. They represent a beautiful wilderness without paths; in\r\nwhich the eye is diverted by every thing, without being particularly\r\ndirected to any thing: and in which it is agreeable to be lost, and\r\ndifficult to find the way out.\r\n\r\nBefore I offer any other remark oh the spirit and composition of the\r\nabove passage, I shall compare it with the circumstance it alludes to.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance, then, does not deserve the encomium. The rejection\r\nwas not prompted by her fortitude but her vanity. She did not view it\r\nas a case of despair or even of extreme danger, and consequently the\r\ndetermination to renounce her duration rather than her glory, cannot\r\napply to the condition of her mind. She had then high expectations of\r\nsubjugating America, and had no other naval force against her than\r\nFrance; neither was she certain that rejecting the mediation of Spain\r\nwould combine that power with France. New mediations might arise more\r\nfavourable than those she had refused. But if they should not, and\r\nSpain should join, she still saw that it would only bring out her\r\nnaval force against France and Spain, which was wanted and could not\r\nbe employed against America, and habits of thinking had taught her to\r\nbelieve herself superior to both.\r\n\r\nBut in any case to which the consequence might point, there was\r\nnothing to impress her with the idea of renouncing her duration. It is\r\nnot the policy of Europe to suffer the extinction of any power, but\r\nonly to lop off, or prevent its dangerous encrease. She was likewise\r\nfreed by situation from the internal and immediate horrors of\r\ninvasion; was rolling in dissipation, and looking for conquests; and\r\nthough she suffered nothing but the expense of war, she still had a\r\ngreedy eye to magnificent reimbursement.\r\n\r\nBut if the Abbe is delighted with high and striking singularities of\r\ncharacter he might, in America, have found ample field for encomium.\r\nHere was a people, who could not know what part the world would take\r\nfor, or against them; and who were venturing on an untried scheme, in\r\nopposition to a power, against which more formidable nations had\r\nfailed. They had every thing to learn but the principles which\r\nsupported them, and every thing to procure that was necessary for\r\ntheir defense. They have at times seen themselves as low as distress\r\ncould make them, without showing the least stagger in their fortitude;\r\nand been raised again by the most unexpected events, without\r\ndiscovering an unmanly discomposure of joy. To hesitate or to despair\r\nare conditions equally unknown in America. Her mind was prepared for\r\nevery thing; because her original and final resolution of succeeding\r\nor perishing included all possible circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe rejection of the British propositions in the year 1778,\r\ncircumstanced as America was at that time, is a far greater instance\r\nof unshaken fortitude than the refusal of the Spanish mediation by the\r\nCourt of London: and other historians, besides the Abbe, struck with\r\nthe vastness of her conduct therein, have, like himself, attributed it\r\nto a circumstance which was then unknown, the alliance with France.\r\nTheir error shows their idea of its greatness; because, in order to\r\naccount for it, they have sought a cause suited to its magnitude,\r\nwithout knowing that the cause existed in the principles of the\r\ncountry.[2]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] Extract from, \"_A short Review of the present Reign_,\" in England.\r\n_Page 45, in the New Annual Register for the year 1780_.\r\n\r\n    \"_THE Commissioners, who, in consequence of Lord North's\r\n    conciliatory bills, went over to America, to propose terms of\r\n    peace to the colonies, were wholly unsuccessful. The concessions\r\n    which formerly would have been received with the utmost\r\n    gratitude, were rejected with disdain. Now was the time of\r\n    American pride and haughtiness. It is probable, however, that it\r\n    was not pride and haughtiness alone that dictated the\r\n    Resolutions of Congress, but a distrust of the sincerity of the\r\n    offers of Britain, a determination not to give up their\r\n    independence, and_ ABOVE ALL, THE ENGAGEMENTS INTO WHICH _I_\r\n    HAD ENTERED BY THEIR LATE TREATY WITH FRANCE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this passionate encomium of the Abbe is deservedly subject to\r\nmoral and philosophical objections. It is the effusion of wild\r\nthinking, and has a tendency to prevent that humanity of reflection\r\nwhich the criminal conduct of Britain enjoins on her as a duty.--It is\r\na laudanum to courtly iniquity.--It keeps in intoxicated sleep the\r\nconscience of a nation; and more mischief is effected by wrapping up\r\nguilt in splendid excuse, than by directly patronizing it.\r\n\r\nBritain is now the only country which holds the world in disturbance\r\nand war; and instead of paying compliments to the excess of her\r\ncrimes, the Abbe would have appeared much more in character, had he\r\nput to her, or to her monarch, this serious question--\r\n\r\nAre there not miseries enough in the world, too difficult to be\r\nencountered and too pointed to be borne, without studying to enlarge\r\nthe list and arming it with new destruction? Is life so very long,\r\nthat it is necessary, nay even a duty, to shake the sand, and hasten\r\nout the period of duration? Is the path so elegantly smooth, so decked\r\non every side, and carpeted with joys, that wretchedness is wanting to\r\nenrich it as a soil? Go ask thine aching heart, when sorrow from a\r\nthousand causes wounds it, go, ask thy sickened self when every\r\nmedicine fails, whether this be the case or not?\r\n\r\nQuitting my remarks on this head, I proceed to another, in which the\r\nAbbe has let loose a vein of ill-nature, and, what is still worse, of\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\nAfter caviling at the treaty, he goes on to characterize the several\r\nparties combined in the war.--\"Is it possible,\" says the Abbe, \"that a\r\nstrict union should long subsist amongst confederates of characters so\r\nopposite as the hasty, light, disdainful Frenchman, the jealous,\r\nhaughty, sly, slow, circumspect Spaniard, and the American, who is\r\nsecretly snatching looks at the mother country, and would rejoice,\r\nwere they compatible with his independence, at the disasters of his\r\nallies?\"\r\n\r\nTo draw foolish portraits of each other, is a mode of attack and\r\nreprisal, which the greater part of mankind are fond of indulging. The\r\nserious philosopher should be above it, more especially in cases from\r\nwhich no possible good can arise, and mischief may, and where no\r\nreceived provocation can palliate the offense.--The Abbe might have\r\ninvented a difference of character for every country in the world, and\r\nthey in return might find others for him, till in the war of wit all\r\nreal character is lost. The pleasantry of one nation or the gravity of\r\nanother may, by a little penciling, be distorted into whimsical\r\nfeatures, and the painter becomes so much laughed at as the painting.\r\n\r\nBut why did not the Abbe look a little deeper, and bring forth the\r\nexcellencies of the several parties? Why did he not dwell with\r\npleasure on that greatness of character, that superiority of heart,\r\nwhich has marked the conduct of France in her conquests, and which has\r\nforced an acknowledgment even from Britain.\r\n\r\nThere is one line, at least (and many others might be discovered), in\r\nwhich the confederates unite; which is, that of a rival eminence in\r\ntheir treatment of their enemies. Spain, in her conquest of Minorca\r\nand the Bahama Islands, confirms this remark. America has been\r\ninvariable in her lenity from the beginning of the war,\r\nnotwithstanding the high provocations she has experienced? It is\r\nEngland only who has been insolent and cruel.\r\n\r\nBut why must America be charged with a crime undeserved by her\r\nconduct, more so by her principles, and which, if a fact, would be\r\nfatal to her honour? I mean the want of attachment to her allies, or\r\nrejoicing in their disasters. She, it is true, has been assiduous in\r\nshowing to the world that she was not the aggressor toward England;\r\nand that the quarrel was not of her seeking, or, at that time, even of\r\nher wishing. But to draw inferences from her justification, to stab\r\nher character by, and I see nothing else from which they can be\r\nsupposed to be drawn, is unkind and unjust.\r\n\r\nDoes her rejection of the British propositions in 1778, before she\r\nknew of any alliance with France, correspond with the Abbe's\r\ndescription of her mind? Does a single instance of her conduct since\r\nthat time justify it?--But there is a still better evidence to apply\r\nto, which is, that of all the mails which at different times have been\r\nway-laid on the road, in divers parts of America, and taken and\r\ncarried into New-York, and from which the most secret and confidential\r\nprivate letters, as well as those from authority, have been published,\r\nnot one of them, I repeat it, not a single one of them, gives\r\ncountenance to such a charge.\r\n\r\nThis is not a country where men are under government restraint in\r\nspeaking; and if there is any kind of restraint, it arises from a fear\r\nof popular resentment. Now, if nothing in her private or public\r\ncorrespondence favours such a suggestion, and if the general\r\ndisposition of the country is such as to make it unsafe for a man to\r\nshew an appearance of joy at any disaster to her ally; on what\r\ngrounds, I ask, can the accusation stand? What company the Abbe may\r\nhave kept in France, we cannot know; but this we know, that the\r\naccount he gives does not apply to America.\r\n\r\nHad the Abbe been in America at the time the news arrived of the\r\ndisaster of the fleet under Count de Grasse, in the West-Indies, he\r\nwould have seen his vast mistake. Neither do I remember any instance,\r\nexcept the loss of Charlestown, in which the public mind suffered more\r\nsevere and pungent concern, or underwent more agitations of hope and\r\napprehension, as to the truth or falsehood of the report. Had the loss\r\nbeen all our own, it could not have had a deeper effect; yet it was\r\nnot one of those cases which reached to the independence of America.\r\n\r\nIn the geographical account which the Abbe gives of the Thirteen\r\nStates, he is so exceedingly erroneous, that to attempt a particular\r\nrefutation, would exceed the limits I have prescribed to myself. And\r\nas it is a matter neither political, historical, nor sentimental, and\r\nwhich can always be contradicted by the extent and natural\r\ncircumstances of the country, I shall pass it over; with this\r\nadditional remark, that I never yet saw an European description of\r\nAmerica that was true, neither can any person gain a just idea of it,\r\nbut by coming to it.\r\n\r\nThough I have already extended this letter beyond what I at first\r\nproposed, I am, nevertheless, obliged to omit many observations I\r\noriginally designed to have made. I wish there had been no occasion\r\nfor making any. But the wrong ideas which the Abbe's work had a\r\ntendency to excite, and the prejudicial impressions they might make,\r\nmust be an apology for my remarks, and the freedom with which they are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nI observe the Abbe has made a sort of epitome of a considerable part\r\nof the pamphlet Common Sense, and introduced it in that form into his\r\npublication. But there are other places where the Abbe has borrowed\r\nfreely from the said pamphlet without acknowledging it. The difference\r\nbetween society and government, with which the pamphlet opens, is\r\ntaken from it, and in some expressions almost literally, into the\r\nAbbe's work, as if originally his own; and through the whole of the\r\nAbbe's remarks on this head, the idea in Common Sense is so closely\r\ncopied and pursued, that the difference is only in words, and in the\r\narrangement of the thoughts, and not in the thoughts themselves.[3]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n\r\n       COMMON SENSE.                                      ABBE RAYNAL.\r\n\"Some writers have so confounded           \"Care must be taken not to confound\r\nsociety With government, as to leave       together society with government.\r\nlittle or no distinction between them;     That they may be known distinctly,\r\nwhereas they are not only different,       their origin should be considered.\r\nbut have different origins.\r\n\r\n\"Society is produced by our wants,         \"Society originates in the wants of\r\nand governments by our wickedness;         men, government in their vices.\r\nthe former promotes our happiness          Society tends always to good; government\r\n_positively_, by uniting our affections;   ought always to tend to the\r\nthe latter _negatively_, by restraining    repressing of evil.\"\r\nour vices.\"\r\n\r\n_In the following paragraphs there is less likeness in the language, but\r\nthe ideas in the one are evidently copied from the other_.\r\n\r\n\"In order to gain a clear and just         \"Man, thrown, as it were by\r\nidea of the design and end of government,  chance upon the globe, surrounded\r\nlet us suppose a small number              by all the evils of nature, obliged\r\nof persons, meeting in some frequented     continually to defend and protect his\r\npart of the earth, unconnected             life against the storms and tempests\r\nwith the rest; they will then represent    of the air, against the inundations of\r\nthe peopling of any country or             water, against the fire of volcanoes,\r\nof the world.

To gain an idea of the politics which actuated the British\r\nMinistry to this measure, we must enter into the opinion which they,\r\nand the English in general, had formed of the temper of the Dutch\r\nnation; and from thence infer what their expectation of the\r\nconsequences would be.\r\n\r\nCould they have imagined that Holland would have seriously made a\r\ncommon cause with France, Spain and America, the British Ministry\r\nwould never have dared to provoke them. It would have been a madness\r\nin politics to have done so; unless their views were to hasten on a\r\nperiod of such emphatic distress, as should justify the concessions\r\nwhich they saw they must one day or other make to the world, and for\r\nwhich they wanted an apology to themselves.--There is a temper in some\r\nmen which seeks a pretense for submission. Like a ship disabled in\r\naction, and unfitted to continue it, it waits the approach of a still\r\nlarger one to strike to, and feels relief at the opportunity. Whether\r\nthis is greatness or littleness of mind, I am not enquiring into. I\r\nshould suppose it to be the latter, because it proceeds from the want\r\nof knowing how to bear misfortune in its original state.\r\n\r\nBut the subsequent conduct of the British cabinet has shown that this\r\nwas not their plan of politics, and consequently their motives must be\r\nsought for in another line.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the British had formed a very humble opinion of the\r\nDutch nation. They looked on them as a people who would submit to any\r\nthing; that they might insult them as they liked, plunder them as they\r\npleased, and still the Dutch dared not to be provoked.\r\n\r\nIf this be taken as the opinion of the British cabinet, the measure\r\nis easily accounted for, because it goes on the supposition, that\r\nwhen, by a declaration of hostilities, they had robbed the Dutch of\r\nsome millions sterling (and to rob them was popular), they could make\r\npeace with them again whenever they pleased, and on almost any terms\r\nthe British ministry should propose. And no sooner was the plundering\r\ncommitted, than the accommodation was set on foot, and failed.\r\n\r\nWhen once the mind loses the sense of its own dignity, it loses,\r\nlikewise, the ability of judging of it in another. And the American\r\nwar has thrown Britain into such a variety of absurd situations, that,\r\narguing from herself, she sees not in what conduct national dignity\r\nconsists in other countries. From Holland she expected duplicity and\r\nsubmission, and this mistake from her having acted, in a number of\r\ninstances during the present war, the same character herself.\r\n\r\nTo be allied to, or connected with Britain, seems to be an unsafe and\r\nimpolitic situation. Holland and America are instances of the reality\r\nof this remark. Make those countries the allies of France or Spain,\r\nand Britain will court them with civility and treat them with respect;\r\nmake them her own allies, and she will insult and plunder them. In the\r\nfirst case, she feels some apprehensions at offending them, because\r\nthey have support at hand; in the latter, those apprehensions do not\r\nexist. Such, however, has hitherto been her conduct.\r\n\r\nAnother measure which has taken place since the publication of the\r\nAbbe's work, and likewise since the time of my beginning this letter,\r\nis the change in the British Ministry. What line the new cabinet will\r\npursue respecting America, is at this time unknown; neither is it very\r\nmaterial, unless they are seriously disposed to a general and\r\nhonourable peace.\r\n\r\nRepeated experience has shown, not only the impracticability of\r\nconquering America, but the still higher impossibility of conquering\r\nher mind, or recalling her back to her former condition of thinking.\r\nSince the commencement of the war, which is now approaching to eight\r\nyears, thousands and tens of thousands have advanced, and are daily\r\nadvancing into the first state of manhood, who know nothing of Britain\r\nbut as a barbarous enemy, and to whom the independence of America\r\nappears as much the natural and established government of the country,\r\nas that of England does to an Englishman. And on the other hand,\r\nthousands of the aged, who had British ideas, have dropped and are\r\ndaily dropping, from the stage of business and life.--The natural\r\nprogress of generation and decay operates every hour to the\r\ndisadvantage of Britain. Time and death, hard enemies to contend with,\r\nfight constantly against her interest; and the bills of mortality, in\r\nevery part of America, are the thermometers of her decline. The\r\nchildren in the streets are from their cradle bred to consider her as\r\ntheir only foe. They hear of her cruelties; of their fathers, uncles,\r\nand kindred killed; they see the remains of burned and destroyed\r\nhouses, and the common tradition of the school they go to, tells them,\r\n_those things were done by the British._\r\n\r\nThese are circumstances which the mere English state politician, who\r\nconsiders man only in a state of manhood, does not attend to. He gets\r\nentangled with parties coeval or equal with himself at home, and\r\nthinks not how fast the rising generation in America is growing beyond\r\nhis knowledge of them, or they of him. In a few years all personal\r\nremembrance will be lost, and who is king or minister in England, will\r\nbe but little known and scarcely inquired after.\r\n\r\nThe new British administration is composed of persons who have ever\r\nbeen against the war, and who have constantly reprobated all the\r\nviolent measures of the former one. They considered the American war\r\nas destructive to themselves, and opposed it on that ground. But what\r\nare these things to America? She has nothing to do with English\r\nparties. The ins and the outs are nothing to her. It is the whole\r\ncountry she is at war with, or must be at peace with.\r\n\r\nWere every minister in England a _Chatham_, it would now weigh little\r\nor nothing in the scale of American politics. Death has preserved to\r\nthe memory of this statesman _that fame_, which he by living, would\r\nhave lost. His plans and opinions, towards the latter part of his\r\nlife, would have been attended with as many evil consequences, and as\r\nmuch reprobated here, as those of Lord North; and considering him a\r\nwise man, they abound with inconsistencies amounting to absurdities.\r\n\r\nIt has apparently been the fault of many in the late minority, to\r\nsuppose that America would agree to certain terms with them, were they\r\nin place, which she would not ever listen to, from the then\r\nadministration. This idea can answer no other purpose than to prolong\r\nthe war; and Britain may, at the expense of many more millions, learn\r\nthe fatality of such mistakes. If the new ministry wisely avoid this\r\nhopeless policy, they will prove themselves better pilots and wiser\r\nmen than they are conceived to be; for it is every day expected to see\r\ntheir bark strike upon some hidden rock, and go to pieces.\r\n\r\nBut there is a line in which they may be great. A more brilliant\r\nopening needs not to present itself; and it is such an one as true\r\nmagnanimity would improve, and humanity rejoice in.\r\n\r\nA total reformation is wanted in England. She wants an expanded\r\nmind,--an heart which embraces the universe. Instead of shutting\r\nherself up in an island, and quarreling with the world, she would\r\nderive more lasting happiness, and acquire more real riches by\r\ngenerously mixing with it, and bravely saying, I am the enemy of none.\r\nIt is not now the time for little contrivances, or artful politics.\r\nThe European world is too experienced to be imposed upon, and America\r\ntoo wise to be duped. It must be something new and masterly that must\r\nsucceed. The idea of seducing America from her independence, or of\r\ncorrupting her from her alliance is a thought too little for a great\r\nmind, and impossible for any honest one, to attempt. When ever\r\npolitics are applied to debauch mankind from their integrity, and\r\ndissolve the virtues of human nature, they become detestables and to\r\nbe a statesman on this plan, is to be a commissioned villain. He who\r\naims at it, leaves a vacancy in his character, which may be filled up\r\nwith the worst of epithets.\r\n\r\nIf the disposition of England should be such, as not to agree to a\r\ngeneral and honourable peace, and the war must at all events, continue\r\nlonger, I cannot help wishing that the alliances which America has or\r\nmay enter into, may become the only objects of the war. She wants an\r\nopportunity of shewing to the world that she holds her honour as dear\r\nand sacred as her independence, and that she will in no situation\r\nforsake those, whom no negotiations could induce to forsake her.\r\nPeace, to every reflective mind is a desirable object; but that peace\r\nwhich is accompanied with a ruined character, becomes a crime to the\r\nseducer, and a curse upon the seduced.\r\n\r\nBut where is the impossibility or even the great difficulty of England\r\nforming a friendship with France and Spain, and making it a national\r\nvirtue to renounce for ever those prejudiced inveteracies it has been\r\nher custom to cherish; and which, while they serve to sink her with an\r\nincreasing enormity of debt, by involving her in fruitless wars,\r\nbecome likewise the bane of her repose, and the destruction of her\r\nmanners. We had once the fetters that she has now, but experience has\r\nshewn us the mistake, and thinking justly, has set us right.\r\n\r\nThe true idea of a great nation is that, which extends and promotes\r\nthe principles of universal society. Whose mind rises above the\r\nAtmospheres of local thoughts, and considers mankind, of whatever\r\nnation or profession they may be, as the work of one Creator. The rage\r\nfor conquest has had its fashion, and its day. Why may not the amiable\r\nvirtues have the same? The Alexanders and Cæsars of antiquity have\r\nleft behind them their monuments of destruction, and are remembered\r\nwith hatred; while those more exalted characters, who first taught\r\nsociety and science, are blessed with the gratitude of every age and\r\ncountry. Of more use was one philosopher, though a heathen, to the\r\nworld, than all the heathen conquerors that ever existed.\r\n\r\nShould the present revolution be distinguished by opening a new system\r\nof extended civilization, it will receive from heaven the highest\r\nevidence of approbation; and as this is a subject to which the Abbe's\r\npowers are so eminently suited, I recommend it to his attention, with\r\nthe affection of a friend, and the ardour of a universal citizen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\n\r\nSince closing the foregoing letter some intimations respecting a\r\ngeneral peace, have made their way to America. On what authority or\r\nfoundation they stand, or how near or remote such an event may be, are\r\ncircumstances I am not enquiring into. But as the subject must sooner\r\nor later, become a matter of serious attention, it may not be\r\nimproper, even at this early period, candidly to investigate some\r\npoints that are connected with it, or lead towards it.\r\n\r\nThe independence of America is at this moment as firmly established as\r\nthat of any other country in a state of war. It is not length of time,\r\nbut power that gives stability. Nations at war know nothing of each\r\nother on the score of antiquity. It is their present and immediate\r\nstrength, together with their connections, that must support them. To\r\nwhich we may add, that a right which originated to-day, is as much a\r\nright, as if it had the sanction of a thousand years; and therefore\r\nthe independence and present government of America are in no more\r\ndanger of being subverted, because they are modern, than that of\r\nEngland is secure, because it is ancient.\r\n\r\nThe politics of Britain, so far as respected America, were originally\r\nconceived in idiotism, and acted in madness. There is not a step which\r\nbears the smallest trace of rationality. In her management of the war,\r\nshe has laboured to be wretched, and studied to be hated; and in all\r\nher former propositions for accommodation, she has discovered a total\r\nignorance of mankind, and of those natural and unalterable sensations\r\nby which they are so generally governed. How she may conduct herself\r\nin the present or future business of negotiating a peace is yet to be\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nHe is a weak politician who does not understand human nature, and\r\npenetrate into the effect which measures of government will have upon\r\nthe mind. All the miscarriages of Britain have arisen from this\r\ndefect. The former Ministry acted as if they supposed mankind to be\r\n_without a mind_; and the present Ministry, as if America was _without\r\na memory_. The one must have supposed we were incapable of feeling;\r\nand the other that we could not remember injuries.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise another line in which politicians mistake, which is\r\nthat of not rightly calculating, or rather of misjudging, the\r\nconsequence which any given circumstance will produce. Nothing is more\r\nfrequent, as well in common as in political life, than to hear people\r\ncomplain, that such or such means produced an event directly contrary\r\nto their intentions. But the fault lies in their not judging rightly\r\nwhat the event would be; for the means produced only its proper and\r\nnatural consequence.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable, that in a treaty of peace, Britain will contend\r\nfor some post or other in North America, perhaps Canada or Halifax, or\r\nboth; and I infer this from the known deficiency of her politics,\r\nwhich have ever yet made use of means, whose natural event was against\r\nboth her interest and her expectation. But the question with her ought\r\nto be, Whether it is worth her while to hold them, and what will be\r\nthe consequence?\r\n\r\nRespecting Canada, one or other of the two following will take place,\r\nviz. If Canada should people, it will revolt, and if it do not people,\r\nit will not be worth the expense of holding. And the same may be said\r\nof Halifax; and the country round it. But Canada _never will_ people;\r\nneither is there any occasion for contrivances on one side or the\r\nother, for nature alone will do the whole.\r\n\r\nBritain may put herself to great expenses in sending settlers to\r\nCanada; but the descendants of those settlers will be Americans, as\r\nother descendants have been before them. They will look round and see\r\nthe neighbouring States sovereign and free, respected abroad, and\r\ntrading at large with the world; and the natural love of liberty, the\r\nadvantages of commerce, the blessings of independence and of a happier\r\nclimate, and a richer soil, will draw them southward; and the effect\r\nwill be, that Britain will sustain the expense, and America reap the\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the experience which Britain has had of America,\r\nwould entirely sicken her of all thoughts of continental colonization,\r\nand any part she might retain will only become to her a field of\r\njealousy and thorns, of debate and contention, forever struggling for\r\nprivileges, and meditating revolt. She may form new settlements, but\r\nthey will be for us; they will become part of the United States of\r\nAmerica; and that against all her contrivances to prevent it, or\r\nwithout any endeavors of ours to promote it. In the first place she\r\ncannot draw from them a revenue, until they are able to pay one, and\r\nwhen they are so, they will be above subjection. Men soon become\r\nattached to the soil they live upon, and incorporated with the\r\nprosperity of the place; and it signifies but little what opinions\r\nthey come over with, for time, interest, and new connections, will\r\nrender them obsolete, and the next generations know nothing of them.\r\n\r\nWere Britain truly wise, she would lay hold of the present opportunity\r\nto disentangle herself from all continental embarrassments in North\r\nAmerica, and that not only to avoid future broils and troubles, but to\r\nsave expenses. For to speak explicitly on the matter, I would not,\r\nwere I an European power, have Canada, under the conditions that\r\nBritain must retain it, could it be given to me. It is one of those\r\nkind of dominions that is, and ever will be, a constant charge upon\r\nany foreign holder.\r\n\r\nAs to Halifax, it will become useless to England after the present\r\nwar, and the loss of the United States. A harbour, when the dominion\r\nis gone, for the purpose of which only it was wanted, can be attended\r\nonly with expense. There are, I doubt not, thousands of people in\r\nEngland, who suppose, that these places are a profit to the nation,\r\nwhereas they are directly the contrary, and instead of producing any\r\nrevenue, a considerable part of the revenue of England is annually\r\ndrawn off, to support the expense of holding them.\r\n\r\nGibraltar is another instance of national ill-policy. A post which in\r\ntime of peace is not wanted, and in time of war is of no use, must at\r\nall times be useless. Instead of affording protection to a navy, it\r\nrequires the aid of one to maintain it. To suppose that Gibraltar\r\ncommands the Mediterranean, or the pass into it, or the trade of it,\r\nis to suppose a detected falsehood; because though Britain holds the\r\npost, she has lost the other three, and every benefit she expected\r\nfrom it. And to say that all this happens because it is besieged by\r\nland and water, is to say nothing, for this will always be the case in\r\ntime of war, while France and Spain keep up superior fleets, and\r\nBritain holds the place.--So that, though, as an impenetrable\r\ninaccessible rock, it may be held by the one, it is always in the\r\npower of the other to render it useless and excessively chargeable.\r\n\r\nI should suppose that one of the principal objects of Spain in\r\nbesieging it, is to show to Britain, that though she may not take it,\r\nshe can command it, that is, she can shut it up, and prevent its being\r\nused as a harbour, though not as a garrison.--But the short way to\r\nreduce Gibraltar is to attack the British fleet; for Gibraltar is as\r\ndependent on a fleet for support, as a bird is on its wing for food,\r\nand when wounded there it starves.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance which the people of England have not\r\nonly not attended to, but seem to be utterly ignorant of, and that is,\r\nthe difference between permanent power and accidental power,\r\nconsidered in a national sense.\r\n\r\nBy permanent power, I mean, a natural inherent, and perpetual ability\r\nin a nation, which though always in being, may not be always in\r\naction, or not always advantageously directed; and by accidental\r\npower, I mean, a fortunate or accidental disposition or exercise of\r\nnational strength, in whole or in part.\r\n\r\nThere undoubtedly was a time when any one European nation, with only\r\neight or ten ships of war, equal to the present ships of the line,\r\ncould have carried terror to all others, who had not begun to build a\r\nnavy, however great their natural ability might be for that purpose:\r\nbut this can be considered only as accidental, and not as a standard\r\nto compare permanent power by, and could last no longer than until\r\nthose powers built as many or more ships than the former. After this a\r\nlarger fleet was necessary, in order to be superior; and a still\r\nlarger would again supersede it. And thus mankind have gone on\r\nbuilding fleet upon fleet, as occasion or situation dictated. And this\r\nreduces it to an original question, which is: Which power can build\r\nand man the largest number of ships? The natural answer to which is,\r\nThat power which has the largest revenue and the greatest number of\r\ninhabitants, provided its situation of coast affords sufficient\r\nconveniencies.\r\n\r\nFrance being a nation on the continent of Europe, and Britain an\r\nisland in its neighbourhood, each of them derived different ideas from\r\ntheir different situations. The inhabitants of Britain could carry on\r\nno foreign trade, nor stir from the spot they dwelt upon, without the\r\nassistance of shipping; but this was not the case with France. The\r\nidea therefore of a navy did not arise to France from the same\r\noriginal and immediate necessity which produced to England. But the\r\nquestion is, that when both of them turn their attention, and employ\r\ntheir revenues the same way, which can be superior?\r\n\r\nThe annual revenue of France is nearly double that of England, and her\r\nnumber of inhabitants nearly twice as many. Each of them has the same\r\nlength of ground on the Channel; besides which, France has several\r\nhundred miles extent on the Bay of Biscay, and an opening on the\r\nMediterranean: and every day proves that practice and exercise make\r\nsailors, as well as soldiers, in one country as well as another.\r\n\r\nIf then Britain can maintain a hundred ships of the line, France can\r\nas well support a hundred and fifty, because her revenue and her\r\npopulation are as equal to the one as those of England are to the\r\nother. And the only reason why she has not done it is because she has\r\nnot till very lately attended to it. But when she sees, as she now\r\nsees, that a navy is the first engine of power, she can easily\r\naccomplish it.\r\n\r\nEngland very falsely, and ruinously for herself, infers, that because\r\nshe had the advantage of France, while France had the smaller navy,\r\nthat for that reason it is always to be so. Whereas it may be clearly\r\nseen that the strength of France has never yet been tried on a navy,\r\nand that she is able to be as superior to England in the extent of a\r\nnavy, as she is in the extent of her revenues and her population. And\r\nEngland may lament the day, when, by her insolence and injustice, she\r\nprovoked in France a maritime disposition.\r\n\r\nIt is in the power of the combined fleets to conquer every island in\r\nthe West Indies, and reduce all the British Navy in those places. For\r\nwere France and Spain to send their whole naval force in Europe to\r\nthose islands, it would not be in the power of Britain to follow them\r\nwith an equal force. She would still be twenty or thirty ships\r\ninferior, were she to send every vessel she had; and in the meantime\r\nall the foreign trade of England would lay exposed to the Dutch.\r\n\r\nIt is a maxim which, I am persuaded, will ever hold good, and more\r\nespecially in naval operations, that a great power ought never to move\r\nin detachments, if it can possibly be avoided; but to go with its\r\nwhole force to some important object, the reduction of which shall\r\nhave a decisive effect upon the war. Had the whole of the French and\r\nSpanish fleets in Europe come last spring to the West Indies, every\r\nisland had been their own, Rodney their prisoner, and his fleet their\r\nprize. From the United States the combined fleets can be supplied with\r\nprovisions, without the necessity of drawing them from Europe, which\r\nis not the case with England.\r\n\r\nAccident has thrown some advantages in the way of England, which, from\r\nthe inferiority of her navy, she had not a right to expect. For though\r\nshe had been obliged to fly before the combined fleets, yet Rodney has\r\ntwice had the fortune to fall in with detached squadrons, to which he\r\nwas superior in numbers: The first off Cape St. Vincent, where he had\r\nnearly two to one, and the other in the West Indies, where he had a\r\nmajority of six ships. Victories of this kind almost produce\r\nthemselves. They are won without honour, and suffered without\r\ndisgrace; and are ascribable to the chance of meeting, not to the\r\nsuperiority of fighting: For the same Admiral, under whom they were\r\nobtained, was unable, in three former engagements, to make the least\r\nimpression on a fleet consisting of an equal number of ships with his\r\nown, and compounded for the events by declining the actions.[4]\r\n\r\nTo conclude: if it may be said that Britain has numerous enemies, it\r\nlikewise proves that she has given numerous offenses. Insolence is\r\nsure to provoke hatred, whether in a nation or an individual. That\r\nwant of manners in the British Court may be seen even in its\r\nbirth-days and new-years odes, which are calculated to infatuate the\r\nvulgar, and disgust the man of refinement; and her former overbearing\r\nrudeness, and insufferable injustice on the seas, have made every\r\ncommercial nation her foe. Her fleets were employed as engines of\r\nprey; and acted on the surface of the deep the character which the\r\nshark does beneath it.--On the other hand, the Combined Powers are\r\ntaking a popular part, and will render their reputation immortal, by\r\nestablishing the perfect freedom of the ocean, to which all countries\r\nhave a right, and are interested in accomplishing. The sea is the\r\nworld's highway; and he who arrogates a prerogative over it\r\ntransgresses the right, and justly brings on himself the chastisement\r\nof nations.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it might be of some service to the future tranquillity of\r\nmankind, were an article were introduced into the next general peace,\r\nthat no one nation should, in time of peace, exceed a certain number\r\nof ships of war. Something of this kind seems necessary; for,\r\naccording to the present fashion, half of the world will get upon the\r\nwater, and there appears to be no end to the extent to which navies\r\nmay be carried. Another reason is that navies add nothing to the\r\nmanners or morals of a people. The sequestered life which attends the\r\nservice, prevents the opportunities of society, and is too apt to\r\noccasion a coarseness of ideas and of language, and that more in ships\r\nof war than in the commercial employ; because in the latter they mix\r\nmore with the world, and are nearer related to it. I mention this\r\nremark as a general one, and not applied to anyone country more than\r\nto another.\r\n\r\nBritain has now had the trial of above seven years, with an expense of\r\nnearly a hundred million pounds sterling; and every month in which she\r\ndelays to conclude a peace, costs her another million sterling, over\r\nand above her ordinary expenses of government, which are a million\r\nmore; so that her total _monthly_ expense is two million pounds\r\nsterling, which is equal to the whole _yearly_ expenses of America,\r\nall charges included. Judge then who is best able to continue it.\r\n\r\nShe has likewise many atonements to make to an injured world, as well\r\nin one quarter as in another. And instead of pursuing that temper of\r\narrogance, which serves only to sink her in the esteem, and entail on\r\nher the dislike, of all nations, she would do well to reform her\r\nmanners, and retrench her expenses, live peaceably with he neighbours,\r\nand think of war no more.\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia, August 21, 1782._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] _See the accounts, either English or French, of the actions in the\r\nWest-Indies between Count de Guichen and Admiral Rodney, in 1780._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
