THE ISSUES NOW AT STAKE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer of this work first saw the light on a modest farmstead in\r\nthe parish of Droumtariffe, North Cork. He came of a stock long\r\nsettled there, whose roots were firmly fixed in the soil, whose love\r\nof motherland was passionate and intense, and who were ready \"in other\r\ntimes,\" when Fenianism won true hearts and daring spirits to its side,\r\nto risk their all in yet one more desperate battle for \"the old\r\ncause.\" His father was a Fenian, and so was every relative of his,\r\neven unto the womenfolk. He heard around the fireside, in his younger\r\ndays, the stirring stories of all the preparations which were then\r\nmade for striking yet another blow for Ireland, and he too sighed and\r\nsorrowed for the disappointments that fell upon noble hearts and\r\nardent souls with the failure of \"The Rising.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not more than seven years of age when the terrible tribulation\r\nof eviction came to his family. He remembers, as if the events were\r\nbut of yesterday, the poignant despair of his mother in leaving the\r\nhome into which her dowry was brought and where her children were\r\nborn, and the more silent resignation, but none the less deeply felt\r\nbitterness, of his father--a man of strong character and little given\r\nto expressing his emotions. He recalls that, a day or two before the\r\neviction, he was taken away in a cart, known in this part of the\r\ncountry as \"a crib,\" with some of the household belongings, to seek a\r\ntemporary shelter with some friends. May God be good to them for their\r\nloving-kindness and warm hospitality!\r\n\r\nHe wondered, then, why there should be so much suffering and sorrow as\r\nhe saw expressed around him, in the world, and he was told that there\r\nwas nothing for it--that the lease of the farm had expired, that the\r\nlandlord wanted it for himself, and that though his father was willing\r\nto pay an increased rent, still out he had to go--and, what was worse,\r\nto have all his improvements confiscated, to have the fruits of the\r\nblood and sweat and energy of his forefathers appropriated by a man\r\nwho had no right under heaven to them, save such as the iniquitous\r\nlaws of those days gave him.\r\n\r\nIt was something in the nature of poetic justice that the lad whose\r\nfamily was cast thus ruthlessly on the roadside in the summer of 1880,\r\nshould, after the passage of the Land Act of 1903, have, in the\r\nprovidence of things, the opportunity and the power for negotiating,\r\nin fair and friendly and conciliatory fashion, for the expropriation\r\nfor evermore from all ownership in the land of the class who cast him\r\nand his people adrift in earlier years.\r\n\r\nThe writer has it proudly to his credit that, acting on behalf of the\r\ntenants of County Cork, he individually negotiated the sales of more\r\nlanded estates than any other man, or combination of men, in Ireland,\r\nand that with the good will and, indeed, with the gratitude of the\r\nlandlords and their agents, and by reason of the fact that he applied\r\nthe policy of Conference, Conciliation and Consent to this practical\r\nconcern of men's lives, he secured for the tenants of County Cork a\r\nmargin of from one and a half to two years' purchase better terms than\r\nthe average rate prevailing elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFor the rest he devoted himself during the better part of a quarter of\r\na century to the housing and the social betterment of the workers in\r\ntown and country, with results which are reflected in their present\r\nvastly improved condition.\r\n\r\nBut his greatest effort, and what he would wish most to be remembered\r\nfor is that, with a faithful few and against overwhelming odds, he\r\ntook his stand for Mr William O'Brien's policy of National\r\nReconciliation, which all thoughtful men now admit would have saved\r\nIreland from countless horrors and England from a series of most\r\nappalling political blunders if only it had been given fair play and a\r\nfair trial.\r\n\r\nIt is no use, however, in a very sordid and material world, sighing\r\nfor the might-have-beens. What the writer seeks in the present work is\r\nto give, fairly and dispassionately, a narrative of what has happened\r\nin Ireland since Parnell appeared upon the Irish scene and the curtain\r\nwas rung down upon the tragedy that brought the career of the one and\r\nonly \"Uncrowned King of Ireland\" to a close--and until, in turn, the\r\ndownfall of Parliamentarianism was accomplished by means which will,\r\nin due course, appear in these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         IRELAND SINCE PARNELL\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                            A LEADER APPEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some who would dispute the greatness of Parnell--who would\r\ndeny him the stature and the dignity of a leader of men. There are\r\nothers who would aver that Parnell was made by his lieutenants--that\r\nhe owed all his success in the political arena to their ability and\r\nfighting qualities and that he was essentially a man of mediocre\r\ntalents himself.\r\n\r\nIt might be enough to answer to these critics that Parnell could never\r\nhold the place he does in history, that he could never have overawed\r\nthe House of Commons as he did, nor could he have emerged so\r\ntriumphantly from the ordeal of _The Times_ Commission were he\r\nnot superabundantly endowed with all the elements and qualities of\r\ngreatness. But apart from this no dispassionate student of the Parnell\r\nperiod can deny that it was fruitful in massive achievement for\r\nIreland. When Parnell appeared on the scene it might well be said of\r\nthe country, what had been truly said of it in another generation,\r\nthat it was \"as a corpse on the dissecting-table.\" It was he, and the\r\ngallant band which his indomitable purpose gathered round him, that\r\ngalvanised the corpse into life and breathed into it a dauntless\r\nspirit of resolve which carried it to the very threshold of its\r\nsublimest aspirations. To Isaac Butt is ascribed the merit of having\r\nconceived and given form to the constitutional movement for Irish\r\nliberty. He is also credited with having invented the title \"Home\r\nRule\"--a title which, whilst it was a magnificent rallying cry for a\r\ncause, in the circumstances of the time when it was first used, was\r\nprobably as mischievous in its ultimate results as any unfortunate\r\nnomenclature well could be, since all parties in Ireland and out of it\r\nbecame tied to its use when any other designation for the Irish demand\r\nmight have made it more palatable with the British masses. Winston\r\nChurchill is reported to have said, in his Radical days, to a\r\nprominent Irish leader: \"I cannot understand why you Irishmen are so\r\nstupidly wedded to the name 'Home Rule.' If only you would call it\r\nanything else in the world, you would have no difficulty in getting\r\nthe English to agree to it.\"\r\n\r\nBut although Isaac Butt was a fine intellect and an earnest patriot he\r\nnever succeeded in rousing Ireland to any great pitch of enthusiasm\r\nfor his policy. It was still sick, and weary, and despondent after the\r\nFenian failure, and the revolutionary leaders were not prone to\r\ntolerate or countenance what they regarded as a Parliamentary\r\nimposture. A considerable body of the Irish landed class supported the\r\nButt movement, because they had nothing to fear for their own\r\ninterests from it. They were members of his Parliamentary Party, not\r\nto help him on his way, but rather with the object of weakening and\r\nretarding his efforts.\r\n\r\nIt was at this stage that Parnell arrived. The country was stricken\r\nwith famine--the hand of the lord, in the shape of the landlord, was\r\nheavy upon it. After a season of unexampled agricultural prosperity\r\nthe lean years had come to the Irish farmer and he was ripe for\r\nagitation and resistance. Butt had the Irish gentry on his side. With\r\nthe sure instinct of the born leader Parnell set out to fight them. He\r\nhad popular feeling with him. It was no difficult matter to rouse the\r\ndemocracy of the country against a class at whose doors they laid the\r\nblame for all their woes and troubles and manifold miseries. Butt was\r\nlikewise too old for his generation. He was a constitutional statesman\r\nwho made noble appeal to the honesty and honour of British statesmen.\r\nParnell, too, claimed to be a constitutional leader, but of another\r\ntype. With the help of men like Michael Davitt and John Devoy he was\r\nable to muster the full strength of the revolutionary forces behind\r\nhim and he adopted other methods in Parliament than lackadaisical\r\nappeals to the British sense of right and justice.\r\n\r\nThe time came when the older statesman had perforce to make way for\r\nthe younger leader. The man with a noble genius for statesman-like\r\ndesign--and this must be conceded to Isaac Butt--had to yield place\r\nand power to the men whose genius consisted in making themselves\r\namazingly disagreeable to the British Government, both in Ireland and\r\nat Westminster. \"The Policy of Exasperation\" was the epithet applied\r\nby Butt to the purpose of Parnell, in the belief that he was uttering\r\nthe weightiest reproach in his power against it. But this was the\r\ndescription of all others which recommended it to the Irish race--for\r\nit was, in truth, the only policy which could compel British statesmen\r\nto give ear to the wretched story of Ireland's grievances and to\r\nlegislate in regard to them. It is sad to have to write it of Butt, as\r\nof so many other Irish leaders, that he died of a broken heart. Those\r\nwho would labour for \"Dark Rosaleen\" have a rough and thorny road to\r\ntravel, and they are happy if the end of their journey is not to be\r\nfound in despair, disappointment and bitter tragedy.\r\n\r\nParnell, once firmly seated in the saddle, lost no time in asserting\r\nhis power and authority. Mr William O'Brien, who writes with a quite\r\nunique personal authority on the events of this time, tells us that\r\nthere is some doubt whether \"Joe\" Biggar, as he was familiarly known\r\nfrom one end of Ireland to the other, was not the actual inventor of\r\nParliamentary obstruction. His own opinion is that it was Biggar who\r\nfirst discovered it but it was Parnell who perceived that the new\r\nweapon was capable of dislocating the entire machinery of Government\r\nat will and consequently gave to a disarmed Ireland a more formidable\r\npower against her enemies than if she could have risen in armed\r\ninsurrection, so that a Parliament which wanted to hear nothing of\r\nIreland heard of practically nothing else every night of their lives.\r\n\r\nLet it be, however, clearly understood that there was an Irish Party\r\nbefore Parnell's advent on the scene. It was never a very effective\r\ninstrument of popular right, but after Butt's death it became a\r\ndecrepit old thing--without cohesion, purpose or, except in rare\r\ninstances, any genuine personal patriotism. It viewed the rise of\r\nParnell and his limited body of supporters with disgust and dismay. It\r\nhad no sympathy with his pertinacious campaign against all the\r\ncherished forms and traditions of \"The House,\" and it gave him no\r\nsupport. Rather it virulently opposed him and his small group, who\r\nwere without money and even without any organisation at their back.\r\nParnell had also to contend with the principal Nationalist newspaper\r\nof the time--_The Freeman's Journal_--as well as such remnants as\r\nremained of Butt's Home Rule League.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, however, a movement--not for the first or the last\r\ntime--came out of the West. A meeting had been held at Irishtown,\r\nCounty Mayo, which made history. It was here that the demand of \"The\r\nLand for the People\" first took concrete form. Previously Mr Parnell\r\nand his lieutenants had been addressing meetings in many parts of the\r\ncountry, at which they advocated peasant proprietorship in\r\nsubstitution for landlordism, but now instead of sporadic speeches\r\nthey had to their hand an organisation which supplied them with a\r\ntremendous dynamic force and gave a new edge to their Parliamentary\r\nperformances. And not the least value of the new movement was that it\r\nimmediately won over to active co-operation in its work the most\r\npowerful men in the old revolutionary organisation. I remember being\r\npresent, as a very little lad indeed, at a Land League meeting at\r\nKiskeam, Cork County, where scrolls spanned the village street bearing\r\nthe legend: \"Ireland for the Irish and the Land for the People.\"\r\n\r\nThe country people were present from far and near. Cavalcades of\r\nhorsemen thronged in from many a distant place, wearing proudly the\r\nFenian sash of orange and green over their shoulder, and it struck my\r\nyouthful imagination what a dashing body of cavalry these would have\r\nmade in the fight for Ireland. Michael Davitt was the founder and\r\nmainspring of the Land League and it is within my memory that in the\r\nhearts and the talks of the people around their fireside hearths he\r\nwas at this time only second to Parnell in their hope and love. I am\r\ntold that Mr John Devoy shared with him the honour of co-founder of\r\nthe Land League, but I confess I heard little of Mr Devoy, probably\r\nbecause he was compulsorily exiled about this time.[1]\r\n\r\nIn those days Parnell's following consisted of only seven men out of\r\none hundred and three Irish members. When the General Election of 1880\r\nwas declared he was utterly unprepared to meet all its emergencies.\r\nFor lack of candidates he had to allow himself to be nominated for\r\nthree constituencies, yet with marvellous and almost incredible energy\r\nhe fought on to the last polling-booth. The result was astounding. He\r\nincreased his following to thirty-five, not, perhaps, overwhelming in\r\npoint of numbers, but remarkable for the high intellectual standard of\r\nthe young men who composed it, for their varied capacities, for their\r\nfine patriotism, and their invincible determination to face all risks\r\nand invite all dangers. It has been said of Parnell that he was an\r\nintolerant autocrat in the selection of candidates for and membership\r\nof the Party, and that he imposed his will ruthlessly upon them once\r\nthey were elected. I am told by those who were best in a position to\r\nform a judgment, and whose veracity I would stake my life upon, that\r\nnothing could be farther from the truth. Parnell had little to say\r\nwith the choosing of his lieutenants. Indeed, he was singularly\r\nindifferent about it, as instances could be quoted to prove.\r\nUndoubtedly he held them together firmly, because he had the gift of\r\ndeveloping all that was best in a staff of brilliant talents and\r\nvaried gifts, and so jealousies and personal idiosyncrasies had not\r\nthe room wherein to develop their poisonous growths.\r\n\r\nI pass rapidly over the achievements of Parnell in the years that\r\nfollowed. He gave the country some watchwords that can never be\r\nforgotten, as when he told the farmers to \"Keep a firm grip of your\r\nhomesteads!\" followed by the equally energetic exhortation: \"Hold the\r\nharvest!\" They were his Orders of the Day to his Irish army. Then came\r\nthe No-Rent Manifesto, the suppression of the Land League after only\r\ntwelve months' existence, Kilmainham and its Treaty, and the Land Act\r\nof 1881, which I can speak of, from my own knowledge, as the first\r\ngreat forward step in the emancipation of the Irish tenant farmer. Mr\r\nDillon differed with Parnell as to the efficacy of this Act, but he\r\nwas as hopelessly wrong in his attitude then as he was twenty-two\r\nyears later in connection with the Land Act of 1903. In 1882 the\r\nNational League came into being, giving a broader programme and a\r\ndeeper depth of meaning to the aims of Parnell. At this time the\r\nParliamentary policy of the Party under his leadership was an absolute\r\nindependence of all British Parties, and therein lay all its strength\r\nand savour. There was also the pledge of the members to sit, act and\r\nvote together, which owed its wholesome force not so much to anything\r\ninherent in the pledge itself as to the positive terror of a public\r\nopinion in Ireland which would tolerate no tampering with it.\r\nFurthermore, a rigid rule obtained against members of the Party\r\nseeking office or preferment for themselves or their friends on the\r\nsound principle that the Member of Parliament who sought ministerial\r\nfavours could not possibly be an impeccable and independent patriot.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest achievement of Parnell was the fact that he had both\r\nthe great English parties bidding for his support. We know that the\r\nTory Party entered into negotiations with him on the Home Rule issue.\r\nMeanwhile, however, there was the more notable conversion of\r\nGladstone, a triumph of unparalleled magnitude for Parnell and in\r\nitself the most convincing testimony to the positive strength and\r\nabsolute greatness of the man. A wave of enthusiasm went up on both\r\nsides of the Irish Sea for the alliance which seemed to symbolise the\r\nending of the age-long struggle between the two nations. True, this\r\nalliance has since been strangely underrated in its effects, but there\r\ncan be no doubt that it evoked at the time a genuine outburst of\r\nfriendliness on the part of the Irish masses to England. And at the\r\nGeneral Election of 1885 Parnell returned from Ireland with a solid\r\nphalanx of eighty-four members--eager, invincible, enthusiastic, bound\r\nunbreakably together in loyalty to their country and in devotion to\r\ntheir leader.\r\n\r\nFrom 1885 to 1890 there was a general forgiving and forgetting of\r\nhistoric wrongs and ancient feuds. The Irish Nationalists were willing\r\nto clasp hands across the sea in a brotherhood of friendship and even\r\nof affection, but there stood apart, in open and flaming disaffection,\r\nthe Protestant minority in Ireland, who were in a state of stark\r\nterror that the Home Rule Bill of 1886 meant the end of everything for\r\nthem--the end of their brutal ascendancy and probably also the\r\nconfiscation of their property and the ruin of their social position.\r\n\r\nThen, as on a more recent occasion, preparations for civil war were\r\ngoing on in Ulster, largely of English Party manufacture, and more\r\nwith an eye to British Party purposes than because of any sincere\r\nconvictions on the rights of the ascendancy element. Still the Grand\r\nOld Man carried on his indomitable campaign for justice to Ireland,\r\nnotwithstanding the unfortunate cleavage which had taken place in the\r\nranks of his own Party, and it does not require any special gift of\r\nprevision to assert, nor is it any unwarrantable assumption on the\r\nfacts to say, that the alliance between the Liberal and Irish Parties\r\nwould inevitably have triumphed as soon as a General Election came had\r\nnot the appalling misunderstanding as to Gladstone's \"Nullity of\r\nLeadership\" letter flung everything into chaos and irretrievably\r\nruined the hopes of Ireland for more than a generation.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to what I regard as the greatest of Irish\r\ntragedies--the deposition and the dethronement of Parnell under\r\ncircumstances which will remain for all time a sadness and a sorrow to\r\nthe Irish race.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Devoy, although banished, did turn up secretly in Mayo\r\nwhen the Land League was being organised, and his orders were supreme\r\nwith the secret societies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                         A LEADER IS DETHRONED!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the cabin, in the shieling, in the home of the \"fattest\" farmer, as\r\nwell as around the open hearth of the most lowly peasant, in town and\r\ncountry, wherever there were hearts that hoped for Irish liberty and\r\nthat throbbed to the martial music of \"the old cause,\" the name of\r\nParnell was revered with a devotion such as was scarcely ever rendered\r\nto any leader who had gone before him. A halo of romance had woven\r\nitself around his figure and all the poetry and passion of the mystic\r\nCeltic spirit went forth to him in the homage of a great loyalty and\r\nregard. The title of \"The Uncrowned King of Ireland\" was no frothy\r\nexuberance as applied to him--for he was in truth a kingly man, robed\r\nin dignity, panoplied in power, with a grand and haughty bearing\r\ntowards the enemies of his people--in all things a worthy chieftain of\r\na noble race. The one and only time in life I saw him was when he was\r\na broken and a hunted man and when the pallor of death was upon his\r\ncheeks, but even then I was impressed by the majesty of his bearing,\r\nthe dignity of his poise, the indescribably magnetic glance of his\r\nwondrous eyes, and the lineaments of power in every gesture, every\r\ntone and every movement. He awed and he attracted at the same time. He\r\nstood strikingly out from all others at that meeting at Tralee, where\r\nI was one of a deputation from Killarney who presented him with an\r\naddress of loyalty and confidence, which, by the way, I, as a youthful\r\njournalist starting on my own adventurous career, had drafted. It was\r\none of his last public appearances, and the pity of it all that it\r\nshould be so, when we now know, with the fuller light and knowledge\r\nthat has been thrown upon that bitterest chapter of our tribulations,\r\nthat with the display of a little more reason and a juster\r\naccommodation of temper, Parnell might have been saved for his\r\ncountry, and the whole history of Ireland since then--if not, indeed,\r\nof the world--changed for the better. But these are vain regrets and\r\nit avails not to indulge them, though it is permissible to say that\r\nthe desertion of Parnell brought its own swift retribution to the\r\npeople for whom he had laboured so potently and well.\r\n\r\nI have read all the authentic literature I could lay hold of bearing\r\nupon the Parnell imbroglio, and it leaves me with the firm conviction\r\nthat if there had not been an almost unbelievable concatenation of\r\nerrors and misunderstandings and stupid blunderings, Parnell need\r\nnever have been sacrificed. And the fact stands out with clearness\r\nthat the passage in Gladstone's \"Nullity of Leadership\" letter, which\r\nwas the root cause of all the trouble that followed, would never have\r\nbeen published were it not that the political hacks, through motives\r\nof party expediency, insisted on its inclusion. That plant of tender\r\ngrowth--the English Nonconformist conscience--it was that decreed the\r\nfall of the mighty Irish leader.\r\n\r\nIt is only in recent years that the full facts of what happened during\r\nwhat is known as \"The Parnell Split\" have been made public, and these\r\nfacts make it quite clear that neither during the Divorce Court\r\nproceedings nor subsequently had Parnell had a fair fighting chance.\r\nLet it be remembered that no leader was ever pursued by such malignant\r\nmethods of defamation as Parnell, and it is questionable how far the\r\nDivorce Court proceedings were not intended by his enemies as part of\r\nthis unscrupulous campaign. Replying to a letter of William O'Brien\r\nbefore the trial, Parnell wrote: \"You may rest quite sure that if this\r\nproceeding ever comes to trial (which I very much doubt) it is not I\r\nwho will quit the court with discredit.\" And when the whole mischief\r\nwas done, and the storm raged ruthlessly around him, Parnell told\r\nO'Brien, during the Boulogne negotiations, that he all but came to\r\nblows with Sir Frank Lockwood (the respondent's counsel) when\r\ninsisting that he should be himself examined in the Divorce Court, and\r\nhe intimated that if he had prevailed the political complications that\r\nfollowed could never have arisen. On which declaration Mr O'Brien has\r\nthis footnote: \"The genial giant Sir Frank Lockwood confessed to me in\r\nafter years: 'Parnell was cruelly wronged all round. There is a great\r\nreaction in England in his favour. I am not altogether without remorse\r\nmyself.'\"\r\n\r\nNot all at once were the flood-gates of vituperation let loose upon\r\nParnell. Not all at once did the question of his continued leadership\r\narise. He had led his people, with an incomparable skill and\r\nintrepidity, not unequally matched with the genius of Gladstone\r\nhimself, from a position of impotence and contempt to the supreme\r\npoint where success was within their reach. A General Election, big\r\nwith the fate of Ireland, was not far off. Was the matchless leader\r\nwho had led his people so far and so well to disappear and to leave\r\nhis country the prey of warring factions--he who had established a\r\nnational unity such as Ireland had never known before? \"For myself,\"\r\nwrites William O'Brien, \"I should no more have voted Parnell's\r\ndisplacement on the Divorce Court proceedings alone than England would\r\nhave thought of changing the command on the eve of the battle of\r\nTrafalgar in a holy horror of the frailties of Lady Hamilton and her\r\nlover.\"\r\n\r\nThe Liberal Nonconformists, however, shrieked for his head in a real\r\nor assumed outburst of moral frenzy, and the choice thrust upon the\r\nIrish people and their representatives was as to whether they should\r\nremain faithful to the alliance with the Liberal Party, to which the\r\nIrish nation unquestionably stood pledged, or to the leader who had\r\nwon so much for them and who might win yet more if he had a united\r\nIreland behind him, unseduced and unterrified by the clamour of\r\nEnglish Puritan moralists. O'Brien and Dillon and other leading\r\nIrishmen were in America whilst passions were being excited and events\r\nmarching to destruction over here. \"The knives were out,\" as one fiery\r\nprotagonist of the day rather savagely declared. It is, as I have\r\nalready inferred, now made abundantly clear that Gladstone would not\r\nhave included in his letter the famous \"Nullity of Leadership\" passage\r\nif other counsels had not overborne his own better judgment.\r\n\r\nIt was this letter of Gladstone which set the ball rolling against\r\nParnell. Up till then the members of the Irish Party and the Irish\r\npeople were solidly and, indeed, defiantly with him. No doubt Michael\r\nDavitt joined with such zealots as the Rev. Mr Price Hughes and W.T.\r\nStead in demanding the deposition of Parnell, but one need not be\r\nuncharitable in saying that Davitt had his quarrels with Parnell--and\r\nserious ones at that--on the Land Question and other items of the\r\nnational demand, and he was, besides, a man of impetuous temperament,\r\nnot overmuch given to counting the consequences of his actions.\r\n\r\nThen there came the famous, or infamous, according as it be viewed,\r\nstruggle in Committee Room 15 of the House of Commons, when, by a\r\nmajority of 45 to 29, it was finally decided to declare the chair\r\nvacant, after a battle of unusual ferocity and personal bitterness.\r\nAnd now a new element of complication was added to the already\r\nsufficiently poignant tragedy by the entry of the Irish Catholic\r\nbishops on the scene. Hitherto they had refrained, with admirable\r\nrestraint, from interference, and they had done nothing to intensify\r\nthe agonies of the moment. It will always remain a matter for regret\r\nthat they did not avail themselves of a great opportunity, and their\r\nown unparalleled power with the people, to mediate in the interests of\r\npeace--whilst their mediation might still avail. But unfortunately,\r\nwith one notable exception, they united in staking the entire power of\r\nthe Church on the dethronement of Parnell. The effect was twofold. It\r\nadded fresh fury to the attacks of those who were howling for the head\r\nof their erstwhile chieftain and who were glad to add the thunderbolts\r\nof the Church to their own feebler weapons of assault; but the more\r\npermanent effect, and, indeed, the more disastrous, was the doubt it\r\nleft on the minds of thousands of the best Irishmen whether there was\r\nnot some malign plot in which the Church was associated with the\r\nban-dogs of the Liberal Party for dishing Home Rule by overthrowing\r\nParnell. It was recalled that the Catholic priesthood, with a few\r\nglorious exceptions, stood apart from Parnell when he was struggling\r\nto give life and force to the Irish movement, and thus it came to pass\r\nthat for many a bitter year the part of the Irish priest in politics\r\nwas freely criticised by Catholics whose loyalty to the Church was\r\nindisputable.\r\n\r\nEven still--if only the temporary withdrawal of Parnell were\r\nsecured--all might have been well. And it was to this end that the\r\nBoulogne negotiations were set on foot. Mr William O'Brien has,\r\nperhaps, left us the most complete record of what transpired in the\r\ncourse of those fateful conversations. Parnell naturally desired to\r\nget out of a delicate situation with all possible credit and honour,\r\nand his magnificent services entitled him to the utmost consideration\r\nin this respect. He insisted on demanding guarantees from Mr Gladstone\r\non Home Rule and the Land Question, and these given he expressed his\r\nwillingness to retire from the position of Chairman of the Party. At\r\nfirst he insisted on Mr William O'Brien being his successor, but\r\nO'Brien peremptorily dismissed this for reasons which were to him\r\nunalterable. Mr Dillon was then agreed to, and a settlement was on the\r\npoint of achievement when a maladroit remark of this gentleman about\r\nthe administration of the Paris Funds so grievously wounded the pride\r\nof Parnell that the serenity of the negotiations was irreparably\r\ndisturbed, and from that moment the movement for peace was merely an\r\nempty show.\r\n\r\nChaos had come again upon the Irish Cause, and the Irish people, who\r\nwere so near the goal of success, wasted many years, that might have\r\nbeen better spent, in futile and fratricidal strife, in which all the\r\nbaser passions of politics ran riot and played havoc with the finer\r\npurposes of men engaged in a struggle for liberty and right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          THE DEATH OF A LEADER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no Irishman who can study the incidents leading up to\r\nParnell's downfall and the wretched controversies connected with it\r\nwithout feelings of shame that such a needless sacrifice of greatness\r\nshould have been made.\r\n\r\nParnell broke off the Boulogne negotiations ostensibly on the ground\r\nthat the assurances of Mr Gladstone on the Home Rule Question were not\r\nsufficient and that if he was to be \"thrown to the English wolves,\" to\r\nuse his own term, the Irish people were not getting their price in\r\nreturn. But giving the best thought possible to all the available\r\nmaterials it would seem that Mr Dillon's reflection on Parnell's\r\n_bona fides_ was really at the root of the ultimate break-away.\r\n\r\nMr Barry O'Brien, in his _Life of Parnell_, thus describes the\r\nincident:\r\n\r\n\"Parnell went to Calais and met Mr O'Brien and Mr Dillon. The Liberal\r\nassurances were then submitted to him and he considered them\r\nunsatisfactory; but this was not the only trouble. Mr O'Brien had\r\nlooked forward with hope to the meeting between Parnell and Mr Dillon.\r\nHe believed the meeting would make for peace. He was awfully\r\ndisappointed. Mr Dillon succeeded completely in getting Parnell's back\r\nup, adding seriously to the difficulties of the situation. He seemed\r\nspecially to have offended Parnell by proposing that he (Mr Dillon)\r\nshould have the decisive voice in the distribution of the Paris\r\nFunds.... Mr Dillon proposed that the funds might be drawn without the\r\nintervention of Parnell; that, in fact, Mr Dillon should take the\r\nplace Parnell had hitherto held.[1] Parnell scornfully brushed aside\r\nthis proposal and broke off relations with Mr Dillon altogether,\r\nthough to the end he remained on friendly terms with Mr O'Brien.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a vivid memory with me how closely we in Ireland hung upon the\r\nvarying fortunes and vicissitudes of the Boulogne pourparlers, and how\r\nearnest was the hope in every honest Irish heart that a way out might\r\nbe found which would not involve our incomparable leader in further\r\nhumiliations. But alas for our hopes! The hemlock had to be drained to\r\nthe last bitter drop. Meanwhile Parnell never rested day or night. He\r\nrushed from one end of the country to the other, addressing meetings,\r\nfighting elections, stimulating his followers, answering his defamers\r\nand all the time exhausting the scant reserves of strength that were\r\nleft him.\r\n\r\nConsidering all the causes of his downfall in the light of later\r\nevents the alliance of the Irish Party with English Liberalism was, in\r\nmy judgment, the primary factor. Were it not for this entanglement or\r\nobligation--call it what you will--the Gladstone letter would never\r\nhave been written. And even that letter was no sufficient\r\njustification for throwing Parnell overboard. If it were a question of\r\nthe defeat of the Home Rule cause and the withdrawal of Mr Gladstone\r\nfrom the leadership of the Liberal Party, something may be said for\r\nit, but the words actually used by Mr Gladstone were: \"The continuance\r\nof Parnell's leadership would render my retention of the leadership of\r\nthe Liberal Party almost a nullity.\" Be it observed, Gladstone did not\r\nsay he was going to retire from leadership; nor did he say he was\r\ngoing to abandon Home Rule--to forsake a principle founded on justice\r\nand for which he had divided the Liberal Party and risked his own\r\nreputation as a statesman.\r\n\r\nTo think that Gladstone meant this is not alone inconceivable, but\r\npreposterous. And, indeed, it has been recently made abundantly clear\r\nin Lord Morley's book of personal reminiscences that the Parnell Split\r\nneed never have taken place at all had steps been taken by any\r\nresponsible body of intermediaries to obtain Gladstone's real views.\r\nWe now know it for absolute fact that Gladstone had had actually\r\nstruck out of his letter as prepared by him for publication the fatal\r\nand fateful passage and that it was only reinserted at Mr John\r\nMorley's dictation. Mr Morley's own narrative of the circumstances\r\ndeserves quotation:\r\n\r\n\"At 8 to dinner in Stratton Street. I sat next to Granville and next\r\nto him was Mr G. We were all gay enough and as unlike as possible to a\r\nmarooned crew. Towards the end of the feast Mr G. handed to me, at the\r\nback of Granville's chair, the draft of the famous letter in an\r\nunsealed envelope. While he read the Queen's speech to the rest I\r\nperused and reperused the letter. Granville also read it. I said to Mr\r\nG. across Granville: 'But you have not put in the very thing that\r\nwould be most likely of all things to move him,' referring to the\r\nstatement in the original draft, that Parnell's retention would mean\r\nthe nullity of Gladstone's leadership. Harcourt again regretted that\r\nit was addressed to me and not to P. and agreed with me that it ought\r\nto be strengthened as I had indicated if it was meant really to affect\r\nP.'s mind. Mr G. rose, went to the writing-table and with me standing\r\nby wrote, on a sheet of Arnold M.'s grey paper, the important\r\ninsertion. I marked then and there under his eyes the point at which\r\nthe insertion was to be made and put the whole into my pocket. Nobody\r\nelse besides H. was consulted about it, or saw it.\"\r\n\r\nThus the fate of a great man and, to a very considerable extent also,\r\nthe destiny of an ancient nation was decided by one of those\r\nunaccountable mischances which are the weapons of Fate in an\r\ninscrutable world. I think that to-day Ireland generally mourns it\r\nthat Parnell should ever have been deposed in obedience to a British\r\nmandate--or perhaps, as those who conscientiously opposed Mr Parnell\r\nat the time might prefer to term it, because of their fidelity to a\r\ncompact honestly entered into with the Liberal Party--an alliance\r\nwhich they no doubt believed to be essential to the grant of Home\r\nRule.\r\n\r\nWe have since learned, through much travail and disappointment, what\r\nlittle faith can be reposed in the most emphatic pledges of British\r\nParties or leaders, and we had been wiser in 1890 if we had taken\r\nsides with Parnell against the whole world had the need arisen. As it\r\nwas, fought on front and flank, with the thunders of the Church, and\r\nthe ribaldry of malicious tongues to scatter their venomed darts\r\nabroad, Parnell was a doomed man. Not that he lacked indomitable\r\ncourage or loyal support. But his frail body was not equal to the\r\ndemands of the undaunted spirit upon it, and so he went to his grave\r\nbroken but not beaten--great even in that last desperate stand he had\r\nmade for his own position, as he was great in all that he had\r\nundertaken, suffered and achieved for his country. It was a hushed and\r\nheart-broken Ireland that heard of his death. It was as if a pall had\r\nfallen over the land on that grey October morning in 1891 when the\r\nnews of his passing was flashed across from the England that he\r\nscorned to the Ireland that he loved. It may be that those who had\r\nreviled him and cast the wounding word against him had then their\r\nmoment of regret and the wish that what had been heatedly spoken might\r\nbe unsaid, but those who loved him and who were loyal to the end found\r\nno consolation beyond this, that they had stood, with leal hearts and\r\ntrue, beside the man who had found Ireland broken, maimed and\r\ndispirited and who had lifted her to the proud position of conscious\r\nstrength and self-reliant nationhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is not exact. What Dillon proposed was that Parnell,\r\nMcCarthy and Dillon himself should be the trustees, the majority to be\r\nsufficient to sign cheques. When Parnell objected to a third being\r\nadded, Dillon made the observation which ruined everything: \"Yes,\r\nindeed, and the first time I was in trouble to leave me without a\r\npound to pay the men\" (O'Brien's _An Olive Branch in Ireland_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                       AN APPRECIATION OF PARNELL\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the death of Parnell a cloud of despair seemed to settle upon the\r\nland. Chaos had come again; indeed, it had come before, ever since the\r\nwar of faction was set on foot and men devoted themselves to the\r\nsatisfaction of savage passions rather than constructive endeavour for\r\nnational ideals. We could have no greater tribute to Parnell's power\r\nthan this--that when he disappeared the Party he had created was rent\r\ninto at least three warring sections, intent for the most part on\r\ntheir own miserable rivalries, wasting their energies on small\r\nintrigues and wretched personalities and by their futilities bringing\r\nshame and disaster upon the Irish Cause. There followed what Mr\r\nWilliam O'Brien describes in his _Evening Memories_ as \"eight\r\nyears of unredeemed blackness and horror, upon which no Irishman of\r\nany of the three contending factions can look back without shame and\r\nfew English Liberals without remorse.\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus Ireland parted with \"the greatest of her Captains\" and reaped\r\na full crop of failures as her reward. Too late there were flashing\r\ntestimonials to his greatness. Too late it became a commonplace\r\nobservation in Ireland, when the impotence of the sordid sections was\r\napparent: \"How different it would all be if Parnell were alive.\" Too\r\nlate did we have tributes to Parnell's capacity from friend and foe\r\nwhich magnified his gifts of leadership beyond reach of the envious.\r\nEven the man who was more than any other responsible for his fall said\r\nof Parnell (Mr Barry O'Brien's _Life of Parnell_):\r\n\r\n\"Parnell was the most remarkable man I ever met. I do not say the\r\nablest man; I say the most remarkable and the most interesting. He was\r\nan intellectual phenomenon. He was unlike anyone I had ever met. He\r\ndid things and said things unlike other men. His ascendancy over his\r\nParty was extraordinary. There has never been anything like it in my\r\nexperience in the House of Commons. He succeeded in surrounding\r\nhimself with very clever men, with men exactly suited for his purpose.\r\nThey have changed since--I don't know why. Everything seems to have\r\nchanged. But in his time he had a most efficient party, an\r\nextraordinary party. I do not say extraordinary as an opposition but\r\nextraordinary as a Government. The absolute obedience, the strict\r\ndiscipline, the military discipline in which he held them was unlike\r\nanything I have ever seen. They were always there, they were always\r\nready, they were always united, they never shirked the combat and\r\nParnell was supreme all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Parnell was supreme all the time.\" This is the complete answer to\r\nthose--and some of them are alive still--who said in the days of \"the\r\nSplit\" that it was his Party which made him and not he who made the\r\nParty. In this connection I might quote also the following brief\r\nextract from a letter written by Mr William O'Brien to Archbishop\r\nCroke during the Boulogne negotiations:\r\n\r\n\"We have a dozen excellent front bench men in our Party but there is\r\nno other Parnell. They all mean well but it is not the same thing. The\r\nstuff talked of Parnell's being a sham leader, sucking the brains of\r\nhis chief men, is the most pitiful rubbish.\"\r\n\r\nTime proved, only too tragically, the correctness of Mr O'Brien's\r\njudgment. When the guiding and governing hand of Parnell was withdrawn\r\nthe Party went to pieces. In the words of Gladstone: \"they had changed\r\nsince then\"--and I may add that at no subsequent period did they gain\r\nthe same cohesion, purpose or power as a Party.\r\n\r\nIt may be well when dealing with Parnell's position in Irish history\r\nto quote the considered opinion of an independent writer of neutral\r\nnationality. M. Paul Dubois, a well-known French author, in his\r\nmasterly work, _Contemporary Ireland_, thus gives his estimate of\r\nParnell:\r\n\r\n\"Parnell shares with O'Connell the glory of being the greatest of\r\nIrish leaders. Like O'Connell he was a landlord and his family\r\ntraditions were those of an aristocrat. Like him, too, he was\r\noverbearing, even despotic in temperament. But in all else Parnell was\r\nthe very opposite of the 'Liberator.' The Protestant leader of a\r\nCatholic people, he won popularity in Ireland without being at all\r\ntimes either understood or personally liked. In outward appearance he\r\nhad nothing of the Irishman, nothing of the Celt about him. He was\r\ncold, distant and unexpansive in manner and had more followers than\r\nfriends. His speech was not that of a great orator. Yet he was\r\nsingularly powerful and penetrating, with here and there brilliant\r\nflashes that showed profound wisdom. A man of few words, of strength\r\nrather than breadth of mind--his political ideals were often uncertain\r\nand confused--he was better fitted to be a combatant than a\r\nconstructive politician. Beyond all else he was a Parliamentary\r\nfighter of extraordinary ability, perfectly self-controlled, cold and\r\nbitter, powerful at hitting back. It was precisely these English\r\nqualities that enabled him to attain such remarkable success in his\r\nstruggle with the English. Pride was perhaps a stronger motive with\r\nhim than patriotism or faith.\"\r\n\r\nWe have here the opinions of those who knew Parnell in Parliament--the\r\none as his opponent, the other as, perhaps, his most intimate\r\nfriend--and of an independent outsider who had no part or lot in Irish\r\ncontroversies. It may be perhaps not amiss if I conclude this\r\nappreciation of Parnell with the views of an Irishman of the latest\r\nschool of Irish thought. Mr R. Mitchell Henry, in his work, _The\r\nEvolution of Sinn Fein_, writes:\r\n\r\n\"The pathetic and humiliating performance (of the Butt 'Home Rulers')\r\nwas ended by the appearance of Charles Stewart Parnell, who infused\r\ninto the forms of Parliamentary action the sacred fury of battle. He\r\ndetermined that Ireland, refused the right of managing her own\r\ndestinies, should at least hamper the English in the government of\r\ntheir own house; he struck at the dignity of Parliament and wounded\r\nthe susceptibilities of Englishmen by his assault upon the institution\r\nof which they are most justly proud. His policy of Parliamentary\r\nobstruction went hand in hand with an advanced land agitation at home.\r\nThe remnant of the Fenian Party rallied to his cause and suspended for\r\nthe time, in his interests and in furtherance of his policy, their\r\nrevolutionary activities. For Parnell appealed to them by his honest\r\ndeclaration of his intentions; he made it plain both to Ireland and to\r\nthe Irish in America that his policy was no mere attempt at a\r\nreadjustment of details in Anglo-Irish relations but the first step on\r\nthe road to national independence. He was strong enough both to\r\nannounce his ultimate intentions and to define with precision the\r\nlimit which must be placed upon the immediate measures to be taken....\r\nHe is remembered, not as the leader who helped to force a Liberal\r\nGovernment to produce two Home Rule Bills but as the leader who said\r\n'No man can set bounds to the march of a nation....' To him the\r\nBritish Empire was an abstraction in which Ireland had no spiritual\r\nconcern; it formed part of the order of the material world in which\r\nIreland found a place; it had, like the climatic conditions of Europe,\r\nor the Gulf Stream, a real and preponderating influence on the\r\ndestinies of Ireland. But the Irish claim was, to him, the claim of a\r\nnation to its inherent rights, not the claim of a portion of an empire\r\nto its share in the benefits which the Constitution of that empire\r\nbestowed upon its more favoured parts.\"\r\n\r\nJudged by the most varied standards and opinions the greatness of\r\nParnell as the leader of a nation is universally conceded. The\r\nquestion may be asked: But what did Parnell actually accomplish to\r\nentitle him to this distinction? I will attempt briefly to summarise\r\nhis achievements. He found a nation of serfs, and if he did not\r\nactually make a nation of freemen of them he set them on the high road\r\nto freedom, he gave them a measure of their power when united and\r\ndisciplined, and he taught them how to resist and combat the\r\narrogance, the greed and the inbred cruelty of landlordism. He struck\r\nat England through its most vulnerable point--through its Irish\r\ngarrison, with its cohorts of unscrupulous mercenaries and hangers-on.\r\nHe struck at it in the very citadel of its own vaunted liberties--in\r\nthe Parliament whose prestige was its proudest possession and which he\r\nmade it his aim to shatter, to ridicule and to destroy. He converted\r\nan Irish Party of complaisant time-servers, Whigs and office-seekers\r\ninto a Party of irreproachable incorruptibility, unbreakable unity,\r\niron discipline and a magnificently disinterested patriotism. He\r\nformulated the demand for Irish nationhood with clearness and\r\nprecision. He knew how to bargain with the wiliest and subtlest\r\nstatesman of his age, and great and powerful as Gladstone was he met\r\nin Parnell a man equally conscious of his own strength and equally\r\ntenacious of his principles. In fact, on every encounter the ultimate\r\nadvantage rested with Parnell. He won on the Land Question, he won on\r\nthe labourer's demands, he won on the Home Rule issue and he showed\r\nwhat a potent weapon the balance of power could be in the hands of a\r\ncapable and determined Irish leader.\r\n\r\nNot alone did he create an impregnable Irish Party; he established a\r\nunited Irish race throughout the world. His sway was acknowledged with\r\nthe same implicit confidence among the exiled Irish in America and\r\nAustralia as it was by the home-folk in Ireland. He was the great\r\ncementing influence of an Irish solidarity such as was never before\r\nattempted or realised. He did a great deal to arrest the outflow of\r\nthe nation's best blood by emigration, and, if he had no strong or\r\nstriking policy on matters educational and industrial, he gave manhood\r\nto the people, he developed character in them, he gave them security\r\nin their lands and homes, and, if the unhappy cataclysm of his later\r\ndays had not be-fallen, he would unquestionably have given them a\r\nmeasure of self-government from which they could march onward to the\r\nfullest emancipation that the status of nationhood demands.\r\n\r\nThere was never stagnation, nor stupidity, nor blundering in the\r\nhandling of Irish affairs whilst his hand was on the helm. It was only\r\nlater that the creeping paralysis of inefficiency and incompetence\r\nexhibited itself and that a people deprived of his genius for\r\ndirection and control sank into unimagined depths of apathy,\r\nindifference and gloom.\r\n\r\nHe thwarted and defeated what appeared to be the settled policy of\r\nEngland--namely, to palter and toy with Irish problems, to postpone\r\ntheir settlement, to engage in savage repressions and ruthless\r\noppressions until, the race being decimated by emigration or, what\r\nremained, being destroyed in their ancient faiths by a ruthless method\r\nof Anglicisation, the Irish Question would settle itself by a process\r\nof gradual attenuation unto final disappearance.\r\n\r\nIt was Parnell who practically put an end to evictions in\r\nIreland--those \"sentences of death\" under which, from 1849 to 1882,\r\nthere were no less than 363,000 peasant families turned out of their\r\nhomes and driven out of their country. It was his policy which\r\ninvested the tenants with solid legal rights and gave them\r\nunquestioned guarantees against landlord lawlessness. He and his\r\nlieutenants had their bouts with Dublin Castle, and they proved what a\r\nvery vulnerable institution it was when courageously assailed.\r\n\r\nTaken all in all, he brought a new life into Ireland. He left it for\r\never under manifold obligations to him, and whilst grass grows and\r\nwater runs and the Celtic race endures, Ireland will revere the name\r\nof Parnell and rank him amongst the noblest of her leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                     THE WRECK AND RUIN OF A PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blight that had come upon Irish politics did not abate with the\r\ndeath of Parnell. Neither side seemed to spare enough charity from its\r\nchildish disputations to make an honest and sincere effort at\r\nsettlement. There was no softening of the asperities of public life on\r\nthe part of the Parnellites--they claimed that their leader had been\r\nhounded to his death, and they were not going to join hands in a\r\nblessed forgiveness of the bitter years that had passed with those who\r\nhad lost to Ireland her greatest champion. On the other hand, the\r\nAnti-Parnellites showed no better disposition. It had been one of\r\ntheir main contentions that Parnell was not an indispensable leader\r\nand that he could be very well done without. They were to prove by\r\ntheir own conduct and incapacity what a hollow mockery this was and\r\nhow feeble was even the best of them without the guidance of the\r\nmaster mind. They cut a pitiful figure in Parliament, where their\r\ninternal bickerings and miserable squabbles reduced them to positive\r\nimpotence. For years the \"Antis,\" as they were termed, were divided\r\ninto two almost equal sections, one upholding the claims of John\r\nDillon and the other faithful to the flag of T.M. Healy. Meanwhile\r\nJustin McCarthy, a man of excellent intention but of feeble grasp,\r\noccupied the chair of the Party, but did nothing to direct its policy.\r\nHe was a decent figurehead, but not much else. William O'Brien lent\r\nall the support of his powerful personality to Mr Dillon in the hope\r\nthat, by establishing his leadership and keeping the door open for\r\nreconciliation with the Parnellite minority, he could restore the\r\nParty to some of its former efficiency and make it once again the\r\nspear-head of the constitutional fight for Ireland's liberties. Mr\r\nHealy, whose boldness of attack upon Parnell had won him the\r\nenthusiastic regard of the clergy as well as the title of \"The Man in\r\nthe Gap,\" was also well supported within the Party--in fact, there\r\nwere times when he carried a majority of the Party with him. After\r\nParnell's overthrow a committee was elected by the Anti-Parnellites to\r\ndebate and decide policy, but it was in truth left to decide very\r\nlittle, for the agile intellect of Mr Healy invariably transferred the\r\nfight from it to the Party, which had now become a veritable hell of\r\nincompatibilities and disagreements.\r\n\r\nAt this time also indications came from outside that all was not well\r\nwithin the Liberal ranks. Some of the most prominent members of this\r\nParty began to think that the G.O.M. was getting too old for active\r\nleadership and should be sent to the House of Lords. Justin McCarthy\r\nalso reported an interview he had with Gladstone, in which the G.O.M.\r\nplainly hinted that, so far as Home Rule was concerned, he could no\r\nlonger hope to be in at the finish, and that there was a strong\r\nfeeling among his own friends that Irish legislation should be shelved\r\nfor a few years so that place might be yielded to British affairs. The\r\nGeneral Election of 1892 had taken place not, as may be imagined,\r\nunder the best set of circumstances for the Liberals. The Nationalist\r\nmembers were still faithful to their alliance, which had cost Ireland\r\nso much, and which was to cost her yet more, and this enabled the\r\nLiberals to remain in office with a shifting and insecure majority of\r\nabout 42 when all their hosts were reckoned up.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed for the Home Rule Bill of 1893 that it satisfied all Mr\r\nParnell's stipulations. However this may be, Mr Redmond and his\r\nfriends seemed to think otherwise, for they raised many points and\r\npressed several amendments to a division on one occasion, reducing the\r\nGovernment majority to 14 on the question of the Irish representation\r\nat Westminster, which the Parnellites insisted should remain at 103.\r\nHow the mind of Nationalist Ireland has changed since then!\r\n\r\nMr Thomas Sexton was one of the brilliant intellects of the Party at\r\nthis period, a consummate orator, a reputed master of all the\r\nintricacies of international finance, and in every sense of the word a\r\nfirst-rate House of Commons man. But he had in some way or other\r\naroused the implacable ire of Mr T.M. Healy, whose sardonic invective\r\nhe could not stand. A politician has no right to possess a sensitive\r\nskin, but somehow Mr Sexton did, with the result that he allowed\r\nhimself to be driven from public life rather than endure the continual\r\nstabs of a tongue that could be very terrible at times--though I would\r\nsay myself of its owner that he possesses a heart as warm as ever beat\r\nin Irish breast.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Home Rule Bill of 1893 was already assured long before\r\nit left the House of Commons. Like the Bill of 1886 it came to grief\r\non the fear of the English Unionists for the unity of the Empire. Home\r\nRule was conquered by Imperialism, and the Ulster opposition was\r\nmerely used as a powerful and effective argument in the campaign.\r\n\r\nIreland had sunk meanwhile into a hopeless stupor. The attitude of the\r\nIrish masses appeared to be one of despairing indifference to all the\r\nparties whose several newspapers were daily engaged in the delectable\r\ntask of hurling anathemas at each other's heads. Interest in the\r\nnational cause had almost completely ebbed away. A Liberal Chief\r\nSecretary, in the person of Mr John Morley, reigned in Dublin Castle,\r\nbut all that he is remembered for now is that he started the\r\ninnovation of placing Nationalist and Catholic Justices of the Peace\r\non the bench, who became known in time as \"the Morley magistrates.\"\r\nOtherwise he left Dublin Castle as formidable a fortress of ascendancy\r\nauthority as it had ever been. Under conditions as they were then, or\r\nas they are now, no Chief Secretary can hope to fundamentally alter\r\nthe power of the Castle. \"Imagine,\" writes M. Paul Dubois in\r\n_Contemporary Ireland_: \"the situation of a Chief Secretary newly\r\nappointed to his most difficult office. He comes to Ireland full of\r\nprejudices and preconceptions, and, like most Englishmen, excessively\r\nignorant of Irish conditions.... It does not take him long to discover\r\nthat he is completely in the hands of his functionaries. His\r\nParliamentary duties keep him in London for six or eight months of the\r\nyear, and he is forced to accept his information on current affairs in\r\nIreland from the permanent officials of the Castle, without having\r\neven an opportunity of verifying it, and to rely on their\r\nrecommendations in making appointments. The representative of Ireland\r\nin England and of England in Ireland he is 'an embarrassed phantom'\r\ndoomed to be swept away by the first gust of political change. The\r\nlast twenty years, indeed, have seen thirteen chief secretaries come\r\nand go! With or against his will he is a close prisoner of the\r\nirresponsible coterie which forms the inner circle of Irish\r\nadministration. Even a change of Government in England is not a change\r\nof Government in Ireland. The Chief Secretary goes, but the permanent\r\nofficials remain. The case of the clock is changed, but the mechanism\r\ncontinues as before.... The Irish oligarchy has retained its supremacy\r\nin the Castle. Dislodged elsewhere it still holds the central fortress\r\nof Irish administration and will continue to hold it until the\r\nconcession of autonomy to Ireland enables the country to re-mould its\r\nadministrative system on national and democratic lines.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it came to Gladstone surrendering the sceptre he had so long and\r\nbrilliantly wielded, I do not remember that the event excited any\r\noverpowering interest in Ireland. Outside the ranks of the politicians\r\nthe people had almost ceased to speculate on these matters. A period\r\nof utter stagnation had supervened and it came as no surprise or shock\r\nto Nationalist sentiment when Home Rule was formally abandoned by\r\nGladstone's successor, Lord Rosebery. \"Home Rule is as dead as Queen\r\nAnne,\" declared Mr Chamberlain. These are the kind of declarations\r\nusually made in the exuberance of a personal or political triumph, but\r\nthe passing of the years has a curious knack of giving them emphatic\r\nrefutation.\r\n\r\nDivided as they were and torn with dissensions, the Nationalists were\r\nnot in a position where they could effectively demand guarantees from\r\nLord Rosebery or enter into any definite arrangement with him. They\r\nkept up their squalid squabble and indulged their personal rivalries,\r\nbut a disgusted country had practically withdrawn all support from\r\nthem, and an Irish race which in the heyday of Parnell was so proud to\r\ncontribute to their war-chest, now buttoned up its pockets and in the\r\nmost practical manner told them it wanted none of them.\r\n\r\nIn this state of dereliction and despair did the General Election of\r\n1895 surprise them. The Parnellites had their old organisation--the\r\nNational League--and the Anti-Parnellites had established in\r\nopposition to this the National Federation, so that Ireland had a\r\nsufficiency of Leagues but no concrete programme beyond a disreputable\r\npolicy of hacking each other all round. As a matter of fact, we had in\r\nCork city the curious and almost incredible spectacle of the\r\nDillonites and Healyites joining forces to crush the Parnellite\r\ncandidate, whilst elsewhere they were tearing one another to tatters,\r\nas it would almost appear, for the mere love of the thing.\r\n\r\nThere was one pathetic figure in all this wretched business--that of\r\nthe Hon. Edward Blake, who had been Prime Minister of Canada and who\r\nhad surrendered a position of commanding eminence in the political,\r\nlegal and social life of the Dominion to give the benefit of his\r\nsplendid talents to the service of Ireland. It was a service rendered\r\nall in vain, though, to the end of his life, with a noble fidelity, he\r\ndevoted himself to his chosen cause, thus completing a sacrifice which\r\ndeserved a worthier reward.\r\n\r\nAt this period the Home Rule Cause seemed to be buried in the same\r\ngrave with Parnell. It may be remarked that there were countless\r\nbodies of the Irish peasantry who still believed that Parnell had not\r\ndied, that the sad pageant of his funeral and burial was a prearranged\r\nshow to deceive his enemies, and that the time would soon come when\r\nthe mighty leader would emerge from his seclusion to captain the hosts\r\nof Irish nationality in the final battle for independence. This idea\r\nlately found expression in a powerful play by Mr Lennox Robinson,\r\nentitled _The Lost Leader_.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! for the belief, the chieftain had only too surely passed\r\naway, and when the General Election of 1895 was over it was a\r\nbattered, broken and bitterly divided Irish Party which returned to\r\nWestminster--a Party which had lost all faith in itself and which was\r\na byword and a reproach alike for its helpless inefficiency and its\r\npetty intestine quarrels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                       TOWARDS LIGHT AND LEADING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the slow corruption of the Party had been going on in Ireland,\r\nthe cause of Home Rule had been going down to inevitable ruin. The\r\nwarnings on which Parnell founded his refusal to be expelled from the\r\nleadership by dictation from England were more than justified in the\r\nevent. And later circumstances only too bitterly confirmed it, that\r\nany blind dependence upon the Liberal Party was to be paid for in\r\ndisappointment, if not in positive betrayal of Irish interests. A Tory\r\nParty had now come into power with a large majority, and the people\r\nwere treated alternately or concurrently to doses of coercion and\r\nproposals initiated with the avowed object of killing Home Rule with\r\nkindness. This had been the declared policy of Mr Arthur Balfour when\r\nhis attempt to inaugurate his uncle Lord Salisbury's policy of twenty\r\nyears of resolute government had failed, and when, with considerable\r\nconstructive foresight, he established the Congested Districts Board\r\nin 1891 as a sort of opposition show--and not too unsuccessful at\r\nthat--to the Plan of Campaign and the Home Rule agitation.\r\n\r\nWith the developments that followed the Irish Party had practically no\r\nconnection. They were neither their authors nor instruments, though they\r\nhad the sublime audacity in a later generation to claim to be the\r\nlegitimate inheritors of all these accomplishments. Mr Dillon had now\r\narrived at the summit of his Parliamentary ambition--he was the leader\r\nof \"the majority\" Party, but his success seemed to bring him no comfort,\r\nand certainly discovered no golden vein of statesmanship in his\r\ncomposition. The quarrels and recriminations of the three sectional\r\norganisations--the National Federation of the Dillonites, the National\r\nLeague of the Parnellites, and the People's Rights Association of the\r\nHealyites--continued unabated. But beyond the capacity for vulgar abuse\r\nthey possessed none other. Parliamentarianism was dying on its legs and\r\nconstitutionalism appeared to have received its death-blow. The country\r\nhad lost all respect for its \"Members,\" and young and old were sick\r\nunto death of a movement which offered no immediate prospects of action\r\nand no hope for the future. A generation of sceptics and scoffers was\r\nbeing created, and even if the idealists, who are always to be found in\r\nlarge number in Ireland, still remained unconquerable in their faith\r\nthat a resurgent and regenerated Ireland must arise some time, and\r\nsomehow, they were remarkably silent in the expression of their\r\nconvictions. Mr William O'Brien thus describes the unspeakable depths to\r\nwhich the Party had fallen in those days:\r\n\r\n\"The invariable last word to all our consultations was the pathetic\r\none, 'Give me a fund and I see my way to doing anything.' And so we\r\nhad travelled drearily for years in the vicious circle that there\r\ncould be no creative energy in the Party without funds, and that there\r\ncould be no possibility for funds for a party thus ingloriously\r\ninactive. Although myself removed from Parliament my aid had been\r\nconstantly invoked by Mr Dillon on the eve of any important meeting of\r\nthe Party in London, or of the Council of the National Federation in\r\nDublin, for there was not one of them that was not haunted by the\r\nanticipation of some surprise from Mr Healy's fertile ingenuity. There\r\nis an unutterable discomfort in the recollections of the invariable\r\ncourse of procedure on these occasions--first, the dozens of\r\nbeseeching letters to be written to our friends, imploring their\r\nattendance at meetings at which, if Mr Healy found us in full\r\nstrength, all was uneventful and they had an expensive journey for\r\ntheir pains; next, the consultations far into the night preceding\r\nevery trial of strength; the painful ticking off, man by man, of the\r\nfriends, foes, and doubtfuls on the Party list, the careful collection\r\nof information as to the latest frame of mind of this or that man of\r\nthe four or five waverers who might turn the scale; the resolution,\r\nafter endless debates, to take strong action to force the Party to a\r\nmanful choice at long last between Mr Dillon and his tormentors, and\r\nto give somebody or anybody authority enough to effect something; and\r\nthen almost invariably the next day the discovery that all the labour\r\nhad been wasted and the strong action resolved upon had been dropped\r\nin deference to some drivelling hesitation of some of the four or five\r\ndoubtfuls who had become _de facto_ the real leaders of the\r\nParty.\"\r\n\r\nI venture to say that a confession of more amazing impotency,\r\nindecision and inefficiency it would be impossible to make. It brings\r\nbefore the mind as nothing else could the utter degradation of a Party\r\nwhich only a few brief years before was the terror of the British\r\nParliament and the pride of the Irish race.\r\n\r\nOne occasion there was between the Parnell Split and the subsequent\r\nreunion in 1900 when the warring factions might have been induced to\r\ncompose their differences and to reform their ranks. A Convention of\r\nthe Irish Race was summoned in 1906 which was carefully organised and\r\nwhich in its character and representative authority was in every way a\r\nvery unique and remarkable gathering. I attended it myself in my\r\njournalistic capacity, and I was deeply impressed by the fact that\r\nhere was an assembly which might very well mark the opening of a fresh\r\nepoch in Irish history, for there had come together for counsel and\r\ndeliberation men from the United States, Canada, Australia, New\r\nZealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, the Argentine, as well as from\r\nall parts of Great Britain and Ireland--men who, by reason of their\r\neminence, public worth, sympathies and patriotism, were calculated to\r\ngive a new direction and an inspiring stimulus to the Irish Movement.\r\nThey were men lifted high above the passions and rivalries which had\r\nwrought distraction and division amongst the people at home, and it\r\nneeds no great argument to show what a powerful and impartial tribunal\r\nthey might have been made into for the restoration of peace and the\r\nre-establishment of a new order in Irish political affairs. But this\r\ngreat opportunity was lost. The factions had not yet fought themselves\r\nto a standstill. Mr Redmond and Mr Healy resisted the most pressing\r\nentreaties of the American and Australian delegates to join the\r\nConvention, and, beyond a series of laudable speeches and resolutions,\r\na Convention which might have been constituted the happy harbinger of\r\nunity left no enduring mark on the life of the people or the fate of\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Gerald Balfour became Chief Secretary for Ireland after the\r\nHome Rule debacle of 1895 he determined to continue the policy,\r\ninaugurated by his more famous brother, of appeasement by considerable\r\ninternal reforms, which have made his administration for ever\r\nmemorable. There have ever been in Irish life certain narrow coteries\r\nof thought which believed that with every advance of prosperity\r\nsecured by the people, and every step taken by them in individual\r\nindependence, there would be a corresponding weakness in their desire\r\nand demand for a full measure of national freedom. A more fatal or\r\nfoolish conviction there could not be. The whole history of nations\r\nand peoples battling for the right is against it. The more a people\r\nget upon their feet, the more they secure a grip upon themselves and\r\ntheir inheritance, the more they are established in security and\r\nwell-being, the more earnestly, indefatigably and unalterably are they\r\ndetermined to get all that is due to them. They will make every height\r\nthey attain a fortress from which to fight for the ultimate pinnacle\r\nof their rights. The more prosperous they become, the better are they\r\nable to demand that the complete parchments and title-deeds of their\r\nliberty and independence shall be engrossed. Hence the broader-minded\r\ntype of Irish Nationalist saw nothing to fear from Mr Balfour's\r\nattempts to improve the material condition of the people.\r\nUnfortunately for his reputation, Mr Dillon always uniformly opposed\r\nany proposals which were calculated to take the yoke of landlordism\r\nfrom off the necks of the farmers. He seemed to think that a\r\nsettlement of the Land and National questions should go hand in hand,\r\nfor the reason that if the Land Question were once disposed of the\r\nfarmers would then settle down to a quiescent existence and have no\r\nfurther interest in the national struggle.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Mr Balfour's good intentions were fought and frustrated\r\nfrom two opposing sources. His Land Act of 1906 and his Local\r\nGovernment (Ireland) Act, 1898, were furiously opposed by the Irish\r\nUnionists and the Dillonites alike. The Land Bill was by no means a\r\nheroic measure, and made no serious effort to deal with the land\r\nproblem in a big or comprehensive fashion. The Local Government Bill,\r\non the other hand, was a most far-reaching measure, one of national\r\nscope and importance, full of the most tremendous opportunities and\r\npossibilities, and how any Irish leader in his senses could have been\r\nso short-sighted as to oppose it will for ever remain one of the\r\nmysteries of political life. This Bill broke for ever the back of\r\nlandlord power in Irish administration. It gave into the hands of the\r\npeople for the first time the absolute control of their own local\r\naffairs. It enfranchised the workers in town and country, enabling\r\nthem to vote for the man of their choice at all local elections. It\r\nput an end to the pernicious power of the landed gentry, who hitherto\r\nraised the rates for all local services, dispersed patronage and were\r\nguilty of many misdeeds and malversations, as well of being prolific\r\nin every conceivable form of abuse which a rotten and corrupt system\r\ncould lend itself to. To this the Local Government Act of 1898 put a\r\nviolent and abrupt end. The Grand Juries and the Presentment Sessions\r\nwere abolished. Elected Councils took their place. The franchise was\r\nextended to embrace every householder and even a considerable body of\r\nwomen. It was the exit of \"the garrison\" and the entrance of the\r\npeople--the triumph of the democratic principle and the end of\r\naristocratic power in local life.\r\n\r\nNext to the grant of Home Rule there could not be a more remarkable\r\nconcession to popular right and feeling. Yet Mr Dillon had to find\r\nfault with it because its provisions, to use his own words, included\r\n\"blackmail to the landlords\" and arranged for \"a flagitious waste of\r\npublic funds\"--the foundation on which these charges rested being\r\nthat, following an unvarying tradition, the Unionist Government bribed\r\nthe landlords into acceptance of the Bill by relieving them of half\r\ntheir payment for Poor Rate, whilst it gave a corresponding relief of\r\nhalf the County Dues to the tenants. He also ventured the prediction,\r\neasily falsified in the results, that the tenants' portion of the rate\r\nrelief would be transferred to the landlords in the shape of increased\r\nrents. As a matter of fact, the second term judicial rents,\r\nsubsequently fixed, were down by an average of 22 per cent.\r\n\r\nMr Redmond, wiser than Mr Dillon, saw that the Bill had magnificent\r\npossibilities; he welcomed it, and he promised that the influence of\r\nhis friends and himself would be directed to obtain for the principles\r\nit contained a fair and successful working. But, with a surprising\r\nlack of political acumen, he likewise expressed his determination to\r\npreserve in the new councils the presence and power of the landlord\r\nand _ex-officio_ element. This was, in the circumstances, with\r\nthe Land Question unsettled and landlordism still an insidious power,\r\na rather gratuitous surrender to the privileged classes.\r\n\r\nBefore the Local Government Act was sent on its heaven-born mission of\r\nnational amelioration another considerable happening had taken place:\r\nthe Financial Relations Commission appointed to inquire into the\r\nfinancial relations between Ireland and Great Britain having tendered\r\nits report in 1896. Financial experts had long contended that Ireland\r\nwas grievously overtaxed, and that there could be no just dealing\r\nbetween the two countries until the amount of this overtaxation was\r\naccurately and scientifically ascertained and a proper balance drawn.\r\nIt was provided in the Act of Union that the two countries should\r\nretain their separate budgets and should each remain charged with\r\ntheir respective past debts, and a relative proportion of contribution\r\nto Imperial expenses was fixed. But the British Parliament did not\r\nlong respect this provision. In 1817 it decreed a financial union\r\nbetween the two countries, amalgamated their budgets and exchequers,\r\nand ordered that henceforth all the receipts and expenditure of the\r\nUnited Kingdom should be consolidated into one single fund, which was\r\nhenceforward to be known as the Consolidated Fund. It was not long\r\nbefore we had cumulative examples of the truth of Dr Johnson's dictum\r\nthat England would unite with us only that she may rob us. Successive\r\nEnglish chancellors imposed additional burdens upon our poor and\r\nimpoverished country, until it was in truth almost taxed out of\r\nexistence. The weakest points in the Gladstonian Home Rule Bills were\r\nadmittedly those dealing with finance.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the report of the Financial Relations Commission,\r\nwhich had been taking evidence for two years, created a formidable\r\noutcry in Ireland. We had long protested against our taxes being\r\nlevied by an external power; now we knew also that we were being\r\nrobbed of very large amounts annually. The Joint Report of the\r\nCommission, signed by eleven out of thirteen members, decided that the\r\nAct of Union placed on the shoulders of Ireland a burden impossible\r\nfor her to bear; that the increase of taxation laid on her in the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century could not be justified, and, finally,\r\nthat the existing taxable capacity of Ireland did not exceed\r\none-twentieth part of that of Great Britain (and was perhaps far\r\nless), whereas Ireland paid in taxes one-eleventh of the amount paid\r\nby Great Britain. Furthermore, the actual amount taken each year in\r\nthe shape of overtaxation was variously estimated to be between two\r\nand three quarters and three millions. Instantly Ireland was up in\r\narms against this monstrous exaction. For a time the country was\r\nroused from its torpor and anything seemed possible. All classes and\r\ncreeds were united in denouncing the flagrant theft of the nation's\r\nsubstance by the predominant partner. By force and fraud the Act of\r\nUnion was passed: by force and fraud we were kept in a state of\r\nbeggary for well-nigh one hundred years and our poverty flaunted\r\nabroad as proof of our idleness and incapacity. What wonder that we\r\nfelt ourselves outraged and wronged and bullied? Huge demonstrations\r\nof protest were held in all parts of the country. These were attended\r\nby men of all sects and of every political hue. Nationalist and\r\nUnionist, landlord and tenant, Protestant and Catholic stood on the\r\nsame platform and vied with each other in denunciation of the common\r\nrobber. At Cork Lord Castletown recalled the Boston Tea riots. At\r\nLimerick Lord Dunraven presided at a meeting which was addressed by\r\nthe Most Rev. Dr O'Dwyer, the Catholic bishop of the diocese, and by\r\nMr John Daly, a Fenian who had spent almost a lifetime in prison to\r\nexpiate his nationality.\r\n\r\nThere was a general forgetfulness of quarrels and differences whilst\r\nthis ferment of truly national indignation lasted. But the cohesive\r\nmaterials were not sound enough to make it a lasting union of the\r\nwhole people. There were still class fights to be fought to their\r\nappointed end, and so the agitation gradually filtered out, and\r\nIreland remains to-day still groaning under the intolerable burden of\r\novertaxation, not lessened, but enormously increased, by a war which\r\nIreland claims was none of her business.\r\n\r\nThe subsidence of the political fever from 1891 to 1898 was not\r\nwithout its compensations in other directions. Ireland had time to\r\nthink of other things, to enter into a sort of spiritual retreat--to\r\nwonder whether if, after all, politics were everything, whether the\r\nexclusive pursuit of them did not mean that other vital factors in the\r\nnational life were forgotten, and whether the attainment of material\r\nambitions might not be purchased at too great a sacrifice--at the loss\r\nof those spiritual and moral forces without which no nation can be\r\neither great or good in the best sense. There was much to be done in\r\nthis direction. The iron of slavery had very nearly entered our souls.\r\nCenturies of landlord oppression, of starvation, duplicity and\r\nAnglicisation had very nearly destroyed whatever there was of moral\r\nvirtue and moral worth in our nature. The Irish language--our\r\ndistinctive badge of nationhood--had almost died upon the lips of the\r\npeople. The old Gaelic traditions and pastimes were fast fading away.\r\nHad these gone we might, indeed, win Home Rule, but we would have lost\r\nthings immeasurably greater, for \"not by bread alone doth man\r\nlive\"--we would have lost that independence of the soul, that moral\r\ngrandeur, that intellectual distinction, that spiritual strength\r\nwithout which all the charters of liberty which any foreign Parliament\r\ncould confer would be only so many \"scraps of paper,\" assuring us it\r\nmay be of fine clothes and well-filled stomachs and self-satisfied\r\nminds, but conferring none of those glories whose shining illumines\r\nthe dark ways of life and leads us towards that light which surpasseth\r\nall understanding.\r\n\r\nThanks to the workings of an inscrutable Providence it was, however,\r\nwhilst the worst form of political stagnation had settled on the land\r\nthat other deeper depths were stirring and that the people were of\r\nthemselves moving towards a truer light and a higher leading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                 FORCES OF REGENERATION AND THEIR EFFECT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"George A. Birmingham\" (who in private life is Canon Hannay), in his\r\nadmirable book, _An Irishman Looks at his World_, tells us: \"The\r\nmost important educational work in Ireland during the last twenty\r\nyears has been done independently of universities or schools,\" and in\r\nthis statement I entirely agree with him. And I may add that in this\r\nwork Canon Hannay himself bore no inconsiderable part. During a\r\npolitical campaign in Mayo in 1910 I had some delightful conversations\r\nwith Canon Hannay in my hotel at Westport, and his views expressed in\r\nthe volume from which I quote are only a development of those which he\r\nthen outlined. Both as to the vexed questions then disturbing North\r\nand South Ireland and as to the lines along which national growth\r\nought to take place we had much in common. We agreed that nationality\r\nmeans much more than mere political independence--that it is founded\r\non the character and intellect of the people, that it lives and is\r\nexpressed in its culture, customs and traditions, in its literature,\r\nits songs and its arts. We saw hope for Ireland because she was\r\nremaking and remoulding herself from within--the only sure way in\r\nwhich she could work out her eventual salvation, whatever political\r\nparties or combinations may come or go.\r\n\r\nThis process of regeneration took firm root when the parties were\r\nexhausting themselves in mournful internal strife. Through the whole\r\nof the nineteenth century it had been the malign purpose of England to\r\ndestroy the spirit of nationality through its control of the schools.\r\nJust as in the previous century it sought to reduce Ireland to a state\r\nof servitude through the operations of the Penal Laws, so it now\r\nsought to continue its malefic purpose by a system of education \"so\r\nbad that if England had wished to kill Ireland's soul when she imposed\r\nit on the Sister Isle she could not have discovered a better means of\r\ndoing so\" (M. Paul Dubois). And the same authority ascribes the\r\nfatalism, the lethargy, the moral inertia and intellectual passivity,\r\nthe general absence of energy and character which prevailed in Ireland\r\nten or twelve years ago to the fact that England struck at Ireland\r\nthrough her brain and sought to demoralise and ruin the national mind.\r\n\r\nThank God for it that the effort failed, but it failed mainly owing to\r\nthe fact that a new generation of prophets had arisen in Ireland who\r\nsaw that in the revival and reform of national education rested the\r\nbest hope for the future. They recalled the gospel of Thomas Davis and\r\nthe other noble minds of the Young Ireland era that we needs must\r\neducate in order that we may be free. They sought to give form and\r\neffect to the splendid ideals of the Young Irelanders. A new spirit\r\nwas abroad, and not in matters educational alone. The doctrine of\r\nself-help and self-reliance was being preached and, what was better,\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nThe Gaelic League, founded in 1893 by a few enthusiastic Irish\r\nspirits, was formed to effect an Irish renascence in matters of the\r\nmind and spirit. It was non-sectarian and non-political. Its purpose\r\nwas purely psychological and educational--it sought the preservation\r\nof the Irish language from a fast-threatening decay, it encouraged the\r\nstudy of ancient Irish literature and it promoted the cultivation of a\r\nmodern literature in the Irish language. Its beginnings were modest,\r\nand its founders were practically three unknown young men whose only\r\nspecial equipment for leadership of a new movement were boundless\r\nenthusiasm and the possession of the scholastic temperament. Douglas\r\nHyde, the son of a Protestant clergyman, dwelt far away in an\r\nunimportant parish in Connaught, and, while still a boy, became\r\ndevoted to the study of the Irish language. Father O'Growney was a\r\nproduct of Maynooth culture, whose love of the Irish tongue became the\r\nbest part of his nature, and John MacNeill (now so well known as a\r\nSinn Fein leader) was born in Antrim, educated in a Belfast school and\r\nacquired his love for Irish in the Aran islands. It is marvellous to\r\nconsider how the programme of the new League \"caught on.\" Some\r\nmovements make their appeal to a class or a cult--to the young, the\r\nmiddle-aged or the old. But the Gaelic League, perhaps because of the\r\nvery simplicity and directness of its objects, made an appeal to all.\r\nIt numbered its adherents in every walk of life; it drew its\r\nmembership from all political parties; it gathered the sects within\r\nits folds, and the greatest tribute that can be paid it is that it\r\ntaught all its disciples a new way of looking at Ireland and gave them\r\na new pride in their country. Ireland became national and independent\r\nin a sense it had not learnt before--it realised that \"the essential\r\nmark of nationhood is the intellectual, social and moral patrimony\r\nwhich the past bequeaths to the present, which, amplified, or at least\r\npreserved, the present must bequeath to the future, and that it is\r\nthis which makes the strength and individuality of a people.\"\r\n\r\nIts branches spread rapidly throughout Ireland, and the movement was\r\ntaken up abroad with equal enthusiasm. Irish language classes were\r\norganised, Irish history of the native--as distinct from the\r\nBritish--brand was taught. Lessons in dancing and singing were given\r\nand the old national airs were revived and became the popular music of\r\nthe day. It would take too much of my space to recount all the varied\r\nactivities of the League, all that it did to preserve ancient Irish\r\nculture, to make the past live again in the lives of the people, to\r\nfoster national sports and recreations, to organise Gaelic festivals\r\nof the kind that flourished in Ireland's artistic past, to create an\r\nIrish Ireland and to arrest the decadence of manners and the\r\nAnglicisation which had almost eaten into the souls of the people and\r\ndestroyed their true Celtic character. Mr P.H. Pearse truly said of\r\nit: \"The Gaelic League will be recognised in history as the most\r\nrevolutionary influence that ever came into Ireland.\" It saved the\r\nsoul of Ireland when it was in imminent danger of being lost, and its\r\ntriumph was in great measure due to the fact that it held rigidly\r\naloof from the professedly political parties, although it may be said\r\nfor it that it undoubtedly laid the foundations of that school of\r\nthought which made all the later developments of nationality possible.\r\nAnd the amazing thing is that the priest and the parson, the gentry\r\nand the middle classes, equally with the peasantry, vied with each\r\nother in extending the influence and power of the movement. One of its\r\nstrongest supporters was a leader of the Belfast Orangemen, the late\r\nDr Kane, who observed that though he was a Unionist and a Protestant\r\nhe did not forget that he had sprung from the Clan O'Cahan. The\r\nstimulation given to national thought and purpose spread in many\r\ndirections. A new race of Irish priests was being educated on more\r\nthoroughly Irish lines, and they went forth to their duties with the\r\ninspiration, as it were, of a new call. A crusade was started against\r\nemigration, which was fast draining the country of its reserves of\r\nbrain, brawn and beauty. The dullness of the country-side, an\r\nimportant factor in forcing the young and adventurous abroad, was\r\nrelieved by the new enthusiasm for Irish games and pastimes and\r\nrecreations--for the _seanchus_, the _sgoruidheacht_, the\r\n_ceilidhe_ and the _Feiseanna_.\r\n\r\nIn giving to the young especially a new pride in their country and in\r\ntheir own, great and distinctive national heritage, it did a great\r\ndeal to strengthen the national character and to make it more\r\nindependent and self-reliant. It started the great work of rooting out\r\nthe slavery which centuries of dependency and subjection had bred into\r\nthe marrow of the race. Mr Arthur Griffith has admitted that the\r\npresent generation could never have effected this work had not Parnell\r\nand his generation done their brave labour before them, but considered\r\nin themselves the achievements of the Gaelic League can only be\r\ndescribed as mighty both in the actual revolution it wrought in the\r\nmoral, intellectual and spiritual sphere, in the reaction it created\r\nagainst the coarser materialism of imported modes and manners, and in\r\nthe new spirit which it breathed into the entire people.\r\n\r\nCoincident with the foundation of the Gaelic League, other\r\nregenerative influences were also at work. These aimed at the economic\r\nreconstruction and the industrial development of the country by the\r\ninculcation of the principles of self-help, self-reliance and\r\nco-operation, and by the wider dissemination of technical instruction\r\nand agricultural education. Ireland, by reason, I suppose, of its\r\ncondition, its arrested development and its psychology, is a country\r\nmuch given to \"new movements,\" most of which have a very brief\r\nexistence. They are born but to breathe and then expire. In the ease,\r\nhowever, of the Gaelic League, and the movements for co-operation\r\namongst the farmers, and for technical instruction in the arts and\r\ncrafts most suitable to the country, these movements were conceived\r\nand created strongly to endure. And to the credit of their authors\r\nand, be it said also, of the country for whose upliftment and\r\nbetterment they were intended, they have endured greatly, and greatly\r\nfulfilled their purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is conceded by all who have any knowledge of the subject that the\r\neconomic decadence of Ireland is not due to any lack of natural\r\nresources; neither is it due to insufficiency of capital or absence of\r\nworkers. It is due to want of initiative, want of enterprise, want of\r\nbusiness method, want of confidence, and want of education on the\r\nright lines. The education which should have been fashioned to fit the\r\nyouth of Ireland for a life of work and industry and usefulness in\r\ntheir own land was invented with the express object of making of them\r\n\"happy English children.\" There are possibly a few hundred millions\r\nsterling of Irish money, belonging in the main to the farmers and\r\nwell-to-do shopkeepers, lying idle in Irish banks, and the irony of it\r\nis that these savings of the Irish are invested in British\r\nenterprises. They help to enrich the British plutocrat and to provide\r\nemployment for the British worker, whilst the vast natural resources\r\nof Ireland remain undeveloped and the cream of Ireland's productive\r\npower, in the shape of its workers, betake themselves to other lands\r\nto assist in strengthening the structure and stability of other\r\nnations, when they should be engaged in raising the fabric of a\r\nprosperous commonwealth at home.\r\n\r\nThose, however, who would blame Ireland for its present position of\r\nindustrial stagnation forget that it was not always thus--they do not\r\nbear it in mind that Ireland had a great commercial past, that it had\r\nits own mercantile marine doing direct trade with foreign countries,\r\nthat it had flourishing industries and factories and mills all over\r\nthe country, but that all these were killed and destroyed and driven\r\nout of existence by the cruel trade policy of England, which decreed\r\nthe death of every Irish industry or manufacture which stood in the\r\nway of its own industrial progress.\r\n\r\nThose who sought the economic reconstruction of the country had\r\naccordingly to contend against a very evil inheritance. The commercial\r\nspirit had been destroyed; it should be educated anew. The desire to\r\nfoster home products and manufactures had ceased to exist; it should\r\nbe re-born and a patriotic preference for home manufactures instilled\r\ninto the people. Pride in one's labour--the very essence of\r\nefficiency--had gone out of the country. It should be aroused again.\r\nEconomic reform should proceed first on educational lines before it\r\ncould be hoped to establish new industries with any hope of success.\r\nThe pioneer in this work was the Hon. (now Sir) Horace Plunkett who\r\nreturned to Ireland after some ranching experiences in the United\r\nStates and set himself the task of effecting the economic regeneration\r\nof rural Ireland by preaching the gospel of self-help and\r\nco-operation. It is no part of my purpose to inquire into the secret\r\nmotives of Sir Horace Plunkett, if he ever had any, or to allege, as a\r\ncertain writer (M. Paul Dubois) has done, that Sir Horace promoted the\r\nmovement for economic reform in the hope of reconciling Ireland to the\r\nUnion and to Imperialism. I may lament it, as I do, that Sir Horace,\r\nwho now believes himself to be the discoverer of Dominion Home Rule,\r\ndid not raise his voice either for the Agrarian Settlement or for Home\r\nRule during all the years while he was a real power in the country. I\r\nam not however going to allow my views on these questions to deflect\r\nmy judgment from the real merit of the work performed by Sir Horace\r\nand his associates in the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society,\r\nwhich in the teeth of considerable difficulties and obstacles\r\nsucceeded in propagating through Ireland the principles of self-help\r\nand co-operation.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the Society had many and powerful enemies, most of the\r\nopposition springing from interested and malevolent parties. But there\r\nis, perhaps, no man in all the world so quick to see what is really\r\nfor his advantage as the Irish farmer, and so the movement gradually\r\nfound favour, and co-operative associations began to be formed in all\r\nparts of Ireland. The agricultural labourer has all along regarded the\r\nCreamery side of co-operation with absolute dislike. He declares that\r\nit is fast denuding the land of labour, that it tends to decrease\r\ntillage, and is one of the most active causes of emigration. They say,\r\nand there is ocular evidence of the fact, that a donkey and a little\r\nboy or girl to drive him to the Creamery now do the work of dairymaids\r\nand farm hands. But, whilst this is a criticism justified by existing\r\nconditions, it does not mean that co-operation is a thing bad in\r\nitself, or that there is anything inherently vicious in it to cause or\r\ncreate the employment of less labour. What it does mean is that the\r\neducation of the farmer is still far from complete, that he does not\r\nyet know how to make the best use of his land, and that he does not\r\ntill and cultivate it as he ought to make it really fruitful. Besides\r\nthe Creamery system there are other forms of co-operation which have\r\nexercised a most beneficent influence amongst the peasantry. These\r\ninclude agricultural societies for the improvement of the breed of\r\ncattle, a number of country banks, mostly of the Raiffeisen type,\r\nco-operative associations of rural industries, principally lace, and\r\nsocieties for the sale of eggs and fowls, the dressing of flax, and\r\ngeneral agriculture.\r\n\r\nA direct outcome of the Co-operative Movement was the creation by Act\r\nof Parliament in 1899 of the Department of Agriculture and Technical\r\nInstruction in Ireland--a Department which, though it possesses many\r\nfaults of administration and of policy, has nevertheless had a\r\ndistinctly wholesome influence on Irish life. In relation to the\r\nCo-operative Movement the judgment of Mr Dillon was once again\r\nsignally at fault. He gave it vehement opposition at every point and\r\nthrew the whole weight of his personal following into the effort to\r\narrest its growth and expansion. Happily, however, the practical good\r\nsense of the people saved them from becoming the dupes of parties who\r\nhad axes of their own, political or personal, to grind, and thus\r\nco-operation and self-help have won, in spite of all obstacles and\r\nobjections, a very fair measure of success.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a remarkable development was taking place in the matter of\r\nbringing popular and educative literature within reach of the masses.\r\nPublic and parish libraries and village halls were widely established.\r\nThese were supplementary to the greater movements to which reference\r\nhas been made, but they were indicative of the steady bent of the\r\nnational mind towards enlightenment and education, and of a desire in\r\nall things appertaining to the national life for more and better\r\ninstruction. Another important movement there was to which little\r\nreference is made in publications dealing with the period--namely, the\r\norganisation of the town and country labourers for their political and\r\nsocial improvement. It was first known as the Irish Democratic Trade\r\nand Labour Federation, but this went to pieces in the general\r\nconfusion of the Split. It was resurrected subsequently under the\r\ntitle of the Irish Land and Labour Association. I mention it here as\r\nan additional instance of the regenerative agencies that were at work\r\nin every domain of Irish life, and among all classes, at a time when\r\nthe politicians were tearing themselves to pieces and providing a\r\nRoman holiday for their Saxon friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n               THE BIRTH OF A MOVEMENT AND WHAT IT CAME TO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst Ireland was thus finding her soul and Mr Gerald Balfour\r\npursuing his beneficent schemes for \"killing Home Rule with kindness,\"\r\nthe country had sickened unto death of the \"parties\" and their\r\ndisgusting vagaries. Mr William O'Brien, although giving loyal support\r\nand, what is more, very material assistance to Mr Dillon and his\r\nfriends, was not himself a Member of Parliament, but was doing far\r\nbetter work as a citizen, studying, from his quiet retreat on the\r\nshores of Clew Bay, the shocking conditions of the Western peasantry,\r\nwho were compelled to eke out an existence of starvation and misery\r\namid the crags and moors and fastnesses of the west, whilst almost\r\nfrom their very doorsteps there stretched away mile upon mile of the\r\nrich green pastures from which their fathers were evicted during the\r\nclearances that followed the Great Famine of 1847, and which M. Paul\r\nDubois describes as \"the greatest legalised crime that humanity has\r\never accomplished against humanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"To look over the fence of the famine-stricken village and see the\r\nrich green solitudes, which might yield full and plenty, spread out at\r\nthe very doorsteps of the ragged and hungry peasants, was to fill a\r\nstranger with a sacred rage and make it an unshirkable duty to strive\r\ntowards undoing the unnatural divorce between the people and the land\"\r\n(William O'Brien in an _Olive Branch in Ireland_).\r\n\r\nMr Arthur Balfour had established the Congested Districts Board in\r\n1891 to deal with the Western problem, where \"the beasts have eaten up\r\nthe men,\" and when Mr O'Brien settled down at Mallow Cottage he\r\ndevoted himself energetically to assisting the Board in various\r\nprojects of local development. But his experiences proved that these\r\nminor reforms were at the best only palliatives, \"sending men ruffles\r\nwho wanted shirts,\" and that there could be only one really\r\nsatisfactory solution--to restore to the people the land that had been\r\ntheirs in bygone time, to root out the bullocks and the sheep and to\r\nroot in the people into their ancient inheritance. It was only after\r\nyears of patient effort that he at last succeeded in persuading the\r\nCongested Districts Board to make its first experiment in land\r\npurchase for the purpose of enlarging the people's holdings and making\r\nthem the owners of their own fields.[1] The scene was Clare Island,\r\n\"the romantic dominion of Granya Uaile, the 'Queen of Men,'\" who for\r\nmany years brought Elizabeth's best captains to grief among her wild\r\nislands. The lordship of this island of 3949 acres, with its\r\nninety-five families, had passed into the hands of a land-jobber,\r\n\"with bowels of iron,\" who sought to extract his cent. per cent. from\r\nthe unfortunate islanders by a series of police expeditions in a\r\ngunboat, with a crop of resulting evictions, bayonet charges and\r\nimprisonments.\r\n\r\nThe result of the experiment was, beyond expectation, happy. After\r\nmany delays the Congested Districts Board handed over the island to\r\nits new peasant proprietors, now secure for ever more in their own\r\nhomesteads, but this transfer was not completed until the Archbishop\r\nof Tuam and Mr O'Brien had guaranteed the payment of the purchase\r\ninstalments for the first seven years--a guarantee which to the\r\nislanders' immortal credit never cost the guarantors a farthing.\r\n\r\nFired to enthusiasm by the success of this experiment Mr O'Brien\r\nconceived the idea of a virile agitation for the replantation of the\r\nwhole of Connaught, so that the people should be transplanted from\r\ntheir starvation plots to the abundant green patrimony around them. He\r\navows that no political objects entered into his first conceptions of\r\nthis movement in the West. But the approach of the centenary of the\r\ninsurrection of 1798, with its inspiring memories of the United\r\nIrishmen, furnished him with the idea, and the happy title for a new\r\norganisation which, in his own words, \"drawing an irresistible\r\nstrength and reality from the conditions in the West, would also throw\r\nopen to the free air of a new national spirit those caverns and\r\ntabernacles of faction in which good men of all political persuasions\r\nhad been suffocating for the previous eight years.\" Accordingly the\r\nUnited Irish League was born into the world at Westport on the 16th\r\nJanuary 1898, to achieve results which, if they be not greater--though\r\ngreat, indeed, they are--the fault assuredly rests not with the\r\nfounder of the League, but with those others who malevolently thwarted\r\nhis purposes. The occasion was opportune. The three several movements\r\nof the Dillonites, Redmondites and Healyites were in ruins, and\r\nIreland went its way unheeding of them. The young men were busy with\r\ntheir '98 and Wolfe Tone Clubs. They drank deep of the doctrines of a\r\nheroic age. Centenary celebrations were held throughout the country,\r\nat which men were exhorted to study the history of an era when men\r\nwere proud to die for the land they loved. For a space we listened to\r\nthe martial music of other days, and our hearts throbbed to its\r\nstirring notes. The soul of the nation was uplifted above the squalid\r\nrivalries of the \"'ites\" and the \"'isms.\" It awaited a unifying\r\ninfluence and a programme which would disregard the factions and leave\r\na wide-open door for all Nationalists to come in, no matter what sides\r\nthey had previously taken or whether they had taken any at all.\r\n\r\nThis wide-open door and this broad-based programme the United Irish\r\nLeague offered. Mr Dillon attended the inaugural meeting, but from\r\nwhat Mr O'Brien tells us he did not seem to grasp the full\r\npotentialities of the occasion, \"and he made his own speech without\r\nany indication that any unusual results were expected to follow.\" Mr\r\nTimothy Harrington, one of the leading and most levelheaded of the\r\nParnellite members, also attended, in defiance of bitter attack from\r\nhis own side, showing a moral courage sadly lacking in our public men,\r\neither then or later. By what I cannot help thinking was a most\r\nfortuitous circumstance for the League, at a moment when its existence\r\nwas not known outside three or four parishes, Mr Gerald Balfour\r\ndetermined to swoop down upon it and to crush it with the whole might\r\nof the Crown forces. Two Resident Magistrates and the Assistant\r\nInspector-General of Constabulary, with a small army corps of special\r\npolice, were sent to Westport. Result--the inevitable conflict between\r\nthe police and people took place, prosecutions followed, extra police\r\ntaxes were put on and a store of popular resentment was aroused, the\r\nLeague getting an advertisement which was worth scores of organisers\r\nand monster meetings. I am myself satisfied that it was the ferocity\r\nof the Crown attack upon the League which gave it its surest passport\r\nto popular favour. Whilst the United Irish League was struggling into\r\nlife in the west I was engaged in the south in an attempt to lead the\r\nlabourers out of the bondage and misery that encompassed them--their\r\nown sad legacy of generations of servitude and subjection--but I am\r\nnevertheless pleased to recall now that, as the editor of a not\r\nunimportant provincial newspaper in Cork, I followed the early\r\nstruggles of the new League with sympathy and gave it cordial welcome\r\nwhen it travelled our way.\r\n\r\nAs a mere statement of indisputable fact, it is but just to say\r\nthat the entire burden of organising the League fell upon the\r\nshoulders of Mr O'Brien. When it was yet an infant, so to speak, in\r\nswaddling-clothes, and indeed for long after, when it grew to lustier\r\nlife, he had to bear the whole brunt of the battle for its existence,\r\nwithout any political party to support him, without any great\r\nnewspaper to espouse his cause and without any public funds to supply\r\ncampaign expenses. Nay, far worse, he had to face the bitter hostility\r\nof the Redmondites and Healyites \"and the scarcely less depressing\r\nneutrality\" of the Dillonites, whilst under an incessant fire of shot\r\nand shell from a Coercion Government. After Mr Dillon's one appearance\r\nat Westport he was not seen on the League platform for many a day. At\r\nWestport he had exhorted the crowd to \"be ready at the call of their\r\ncaptain by day or night,\" but having delivered this incitement he left\r\nto others the duty of facing the consequences, candidly declaring that\r\nhe had made up his mind never to go to jail again. Mr Harrington,\r\nhowever, remained the steadfast friend of the League, and Mr Davitt\r\nalso gave it his personal benediction, all the more generous and\r\npraiseworthy in that his views of national policy seldom agreed with\r\nthose of Mr O'Brien. Confounding all predictions of its early eclipse,\r\nand notwithstanding a thousand difficulties and discouragements, the\r\nLeague continued to make headway, and after eighteen months' Herculean\r\nlabours Mr O'Brien and his friends were in a position to summon a\r\nProvincial Convention at Claremorris, in the autumn of 1899, to settle\r\nthe constitution of the organisation for Connaught. Two nights before\r\nthe Convention Mr Dillon and Mr Davitt visited Mr O'Brien at Mallow\r\nCottage to discuss his draft Constitution. It is instructive, having\r\nin mind what has happened since, that Mr Dillon took exception to the\r\nvery first clause, defining the national claim to be \"the largest\r\nmeasure of national self-government which circumstances may put it in\r\nour power to obtain.\" This was the logical continuance of Parnell's\r\nposition that no man had a right to set bounds to the march of a\r\nnation, but Mr Dillon seemed to have descried in it some sinister\r\npurpose on the part of Mr O'Brien and Mr Davitt to abandon the\r\nconstitutional Home Rule demand in the interest of the physical force\r\nmovement. Eventually a compromise was agreed on, but in regard to\r\nother points of the Constitution--particularly that which made the\r\nconstituencies autonomous and self-governing--Mr Dillon was\r\nobstinately opposed to democratic innovation. It would appear to me\r\nthat in these days was sown the seeds of those differences of opinion\r\nbetween those close friends of many years' standing which were later\r\nto develop into a feeling of personal hostility which, on the part of\r\none of them (Mr Dillon) at least, was black and bitter in its\r\nunforgivingness. The Claremorris Convention was such a success its\r\n\"dimensions and character almost took my own breath away with wonder;\r\nall other feelings vanished from the minds of us all except one of\r\nthankfulness and rapture in presence of this incredible spectacle of\r\nthe foes of ten years' bitter wars now marching all one way 'in mutual\r\nand beseeming ranks,' radiant with the life and hope of a national\r\nresurgence\" (Mr O'Brien).\r\n\r\nThe first test of the strength and power of the League was shortly to\r\ncome. Mr Davitt resigned his seat for South Mayo and proceeded to\r\nSouth Africa to give what aid he could to the Boers in their desperate\r\nstruggle for freedom. A peculiar situation arose over the\r\nParliamentary vacancy that was thus created. The enemies of the United\r\nIrish League hit upon the astute political device of nominating Major\r\nM'Bride, himself a Mayo man, who was at the moment fighting in the\r\nranks of the Irish Brigade in the Boer service. Mr O'Brien was\r\nnaturally confronted with a cruel dilemma. To allow the seat to go\r\nuncontested was to confess a failure and to give joy to another\r\nbrigade--the Crowbar Brigade--who wished for nothing better than the\r\nearly overthrow of the League, which was the only serious menace to\r\ntheir power in the country. To contest the seat was to have the\r\naccusation hurled at his head that he was lacking in enthusiasm for\r\nthe Boer cause, which Nationalist Ireland to a man devotedly espoused.\r\nThe question Mr O'Brien had to ask himself was what was his duty to\r\nIreland and to the oppressed peasantry of the West. It could not\r\naffect the Boer cause by a hair's-breadth who was to be future member\r\nfor South Mayo, but it meant everything to Irish interests whether the\r\nUnited Irish League was to make headway and to gain a grip on the\r\nimagination and sympathies of the people. And, influenced by the only\r\nconsideration which could be decisive in a situation of such\r\ndifficulty, Mr O'Brien offered to the electors of South Mayo Mr John\r\nO'Donnell, the first secretary and organiser of the League, who was\r\nthen lying in Castlebar Jail as the result of a Coercion prosecution.\r\nAfter a contest, in which all the odds seemed to lie on the side of\r\nthe South African candidate, Mr O'Donnell was returned by an\r\noverwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nThe South Mayo election meant the end of one chapter of Irish history\r\nand the opening of another in which the political imbecility and\r\nmadness which had distorted and disgraced the years since the Parnell\r\nSplit could no longer continue their vicious courses. The return of Mr\r\nO'Donnell had focussed the attention of all Ireland on the programme\r\nand policy of the League. Branches multiplied amazingly, until it\r\nwould be no exaggeration to say that they spread through the country\r\nlike wildfire. The heather was ablaze with the joy of a resurgent\r\npeople who had already almost forgotten the weary wars that had\r\nsundered them and who blissfully joined hands in one more grand united\r\nendeavour for the old land.\r\n\r\nHaving in several pitched battles defeated the forces of the\r\nRent-offices and the politicians and disposed of some of the vilest\r\nconspiracies which the police emissaries of the Castle could hatch\r\nagainst it, the League had to engage in more desperate encounters\r\nbefore it could claim its cause won. I have already remarked that when\r\nthe Local Government Bill was receiving the benediction of all parties\r\nin Parliament, except Mr Dillon, Mr Redmond promised that his\r\ninfluence would be extended to an effort to return the landlord and\r\nascendancy class to the new Councils. The United Irish League\r\ndetermined to take issue with him on this. When the elections under\r\nthe new Act were announced, Mr Redmond, honestly enough, proceeded to\r\ngive effect to his promise. Mr O'Brien decided, and very rightly and\r\nproperly in my judgment, that it would be a fatal policy, and a weak\r\none, to surrender to the enemy, whilst he was still unconquered and\r\nunrepentant, any of those new Councils which could be made citadels of\r\nnational strength and a new fighting arm of the constitutional\r\nmovement. It meant that having driven the landlords forth from the\r\nfortresses from which they had so long oppressed the people, they\r\nshould be immediately readmitted to them, having made no submissions\r\nand given no guarantees as to their future good behaviour. Mr Redmond\r\nand his followers made brave appeal from the landlord platforms to\r\ntheir supporters \"not to be bitten by the Unity dog.\" Mr Healy's\r\nnewspaper and influence took a similar bent. Mr Dillon's majority, as\r\nusual helpless and indecisive, promulgated no particular policy. For\r\nMr O'Brien and the United Irish League there could be no such\r\nbalancings or doubts. It is good also to be able to say of Mr Davitt\r\nthat he assisted in fighting the insidious attempt to denationalize\r\nthe County and District Councils. The League and its supporters won\r\nall along the line. The few reverses they sustained were negligible\r\nwhen compared with the mighty victories they obtained all over\r\nIreland, and when the elections were over the League was established\r\nin an impregnable position as the organisation of disinterested and\r\ngenuine nationality.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentarians, seeing how matters stood, and no doubt with a\r\nwise thought of their own future, now proceeded to compose their\r\nquarrels. They saw themselves forgotten of the people, but they were\r\nresolved apparently that the people should not forget them. They took\r\ntheir cue from a country no longer divided over sombre futilities, and\r\nunable to make up their minds for themselves they accepted the\r\njudgment of the country once they were aware that it was irrevocably\r\ncome to. Mr Dillon after his re-election to the chair of his section\r\nin 1900 immediately announced his resignation of the office, and\r\nbeing, as we are assured on the authority of Mr O'Brien, always\r\nsincerely solicitous for peace with the Parnellites, he caused a\r\nresolution to be passed binding the majority party in case of reunion\r\nto elect as their chairman a member of the Parnellite Party, which\r\nnumbered merely nine.\r\n\r\nNaturally Mr Redmond and his friends did not hesitate to close with\r\nthis piece of good fortune, which opened an honourable passage from a\r\nposition of comparative isolation to one of triumph and power. The\r\nHealyites, whose quarrel appeared to be wholly with Mr Dillon, to whom\r\nMr Healy in sardonic mood had attached the sobriquet of \"a melancholy\r\nhumbug,\" made no difficulty about falling in with the new arrangement,\r\nand the three parties forthwith met and signed and sealed a pact for\r\nreunification without the country in the least expecting it or,\r\nindeed, caring about it. Probably the near approach of a General\r\nElection had more to do with this hastily-made pact than any of the\r\nnobler promptings of patriotism. I believe myself the country would\r\nhave done much better had the United Irish League gone on with its own\r\nblessed work of appeasement and national healing unhampered by what,\r\nas after knowledge conclusively proved to me, was nothing but a\r\nhypocritical unity for selfish salvation's sake. Mr O'Brien puts the\r\nwhole position in a nutshell when he says: \"The Party was reunified\r\nrather than reformed.\" The treaty of peace they entered into was a\r\ntreaty to preserve their own vested interests in their Parliamentary\r\nseats.\r\n\r\nBut a generous and forgiving nation was only too delighted to have an\r\nend of the bickerings and divisions which had wrought such harm to the\r\ncause of the people, and accordingly it hailed with gratification the\r\nspectacle of a reunited Irish Party.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, nevertheless, that had the process of educating the\r\npeople into a knowledge of their own power gone on a little further\r\nthe United Irish League would have been able at the General Election\r\nto secure a national representation which would more truly reflect\r\nnational dignity, duty and purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first result of the Parliamentary treaty was the election of Mr\r\nJohn E. Redmond to the chair. In the circumstances, the majority party\r\nhaving pledged themselves to elect a Parnellite, no other choice was\r\npossible. Mr Redmond possessed many of the most eminent qualifications\r\nfor leadership. He had an unsurpassed knowledge of Parliamentary\r\nprocedure and seemed intended by nature for a great Parliamentary\r\ncareer. He was uniformly dignified in bearing, had a distinguished\r\npresence, a voice of splendid quality, resonant and impressive in\r\ntone, and an eloquence that always charmed his hearers. Had he\r\npossessed will power and strength of character in any degree\r\ncorresponding to his other great gifts, there were no heights of\r\nleadership to which he might not have reached. As it was, he lacked\r\njust that leavening of inflexibility of purpose and principle\r\nwhich was required for positive greatness as distinct from\r\nmoderately-successful leadership. At any rate, he was the only\r\npossible selection, yet once again Mr Dillon exhibited a disposition\r\nto show the cloven hoof. For some inscrutable reason he made up his\r\nmind to oppose Mr Redmond's election to the chair, but when Mr O'Brien\r\nand Mr Davitt (who had returned from the Transvaal) got word of the\r\nplot they wired urgent messages to their friends in Parliament that Mr\r\nRedmond's selection was the only one that could give the leadership\r\nanything better than a farcical character. Result--Mr Redmond was\r\nelected by a very considerable majority, and Mr Dillon had further\r\nreason for having his knife in his former friend and comrade, Mr\r\nO'Brien.\r\n\r\nThe three sectional organisations--the National Federation, the\r\nNational League and the People's Rights Association thereafter died a\r\nnatural death. There were no ceremonial obsequies and none to sing\r\ntheir requiem.\r\n\r\nThe first National Convention of the reunited country was then\r\nsummoned by a joint committee consisting of representatives of the\r\nUnited Irish League and the Party in equal numbers, and it gave the\r\nLeague a constitution which made it possible for the constituencies to\r\ncontrol the organisation, to select their own Parliamentary\r\nrepresentatives and generally to direct national affairs within their\r\nborders. The conception of the Constitution was sound and democratic.\r\nBut in any organisation it is not the constitution that counts, but\r\nthe men who control the movement. And the time came all too soon when\r\nthis was sadly true of the United Irish League.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: To Dr Robert Ambrose belongs the credit for having first\r\nintroduced, as a private member, in 1897, a Bill to confer upon the\r\nCongested Districts compulsory powers for land purchase. This was\r\nsubsequently adopted as an Irish Party measure. Dr Ambrose was also\r\nthe author of a measure empowering the County Councils to acquire\r\nwaste lands for reclamation. He was one of the pioneers of the\r\nIndustrial Development Movement and wrote and lectured largely on the\r\nsubject. He was, with the late Bishop Clancy, prominent in promoting\r\n\"the All-Red Route,\" which would have given Ireland a great terminal\r\nport on its western coast at Blacksod Bay. He, at considerable\r\nprofessional sacrifice, entered the Party, at the request of Mr Dillon\r\nand Mr O'Brien, as Member for West Mayo. The reward he received for\r\nall his patriotic services was to find himself opposed in 1910 by the\r\nDillonite caucus because of his independent action on Irish questions.\r\nMr Dillon had no toleration for the person of independent mind, and\r\nthus a man who had given distinguished service to public causes was\r\nruthlessly driven out of public life.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                  THE LAND QUESTION AND ITS SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Election of 1900 witnessed a wonderful revival of national\r\ninterest in Ireland. Doubtless if the constituencies had been left to\r\ntheir own devices they would have returned members responsive to the\r\nmagnificent resolves of the people. But the Parliamentarians were\r\nastute manipulators of the political machine: they had for the most\r\npart wormed themselves into the good graces of the local leaders, and\r\narranged for their own re-election when the time came. But there was\r\nnevertheless a considerable leavening of new members--young,\r\nenthusiastic and uncontaminated by the feuds and paltry personalities\r\nof an older generation. They brought, as it were, a whiff of the free,\r\ndemocratic air of the country to Parliament with them, and gave an\r\nexample of fine unselfishness and devotion to duty which did not fail\r\nto have their influence on their elder and more cynical brethren. The\r\nfeud between the Dillonites and Healyites had not, however, been ended\r\nwith the general treaty of peace. Mr Redmond did not want Mr Healy\r\nfought, but in the interests of internal peace Mr Dillon, Mr Davitt\r\nand Mr O'Brien appear to have come to the conclusion that they could\r\nnot have Mr Healy in the new Party. Accordingly, Mr Healy and his\r\nfriends were fought wherever they allowed themselves to be nominated,\r\nand Mr Healy himself was the only one to survive after a desperate\r\ncontest full of exciting incidents in North Louth.\r\n\r\nI made my first bid for Parliamentary honours in the 1900 election,\r\nwhen I had my name put forward as Labour candidate at the South Cork\r\nconvention. I was not very strongly supported then, but the following\r\nMay, on the death of Dr Tanner, I was nominated again as Labour\r\ncandidate for Mid-Cork, and after a memorable tussle at the Divisional\r\nConvention I headed the poll by a substantial majority. Hence I write\r\nfrom now onward with what I may claim to be an intimate inside\r\nknowledge of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe first few years after the 1900 election saw us a solidly united\r\nopposition in Parliament for the first time for ten years. Question\r\ntime was a positive joy to us younger members, who developed almost\r\ndiabolical capacity for heckling Ministers on every conceivable topic\r\nunder the sun. Our hostility to the Boer War also brought us into\r\nperennial conflict with the Government. The Irish members in a very\r\nliteral sense once more occupied \"the floor of the House,\" and there\r\nwere some fierce passages-at-arms, resulting on one occasion in the\r\nforcible ejection of a large body of Nationalists by the police--an\r\nincident which had no relish for those who were jealous of the\r\nprestige and fair fame of the Mother of Parliaments. In Ireland the\r\nfight for constitutional reform went on with unabated energy. All the\r\nold engines of oppression and repression were at work, and the people\r\nproved that they had lost none of their wit or resource in the\r\nstruggle with the forces of the Crown. Mr George Wyndham, whom I like\r\nto look back upon as one of the most courtly and graceful figures in\r\nthe public life of the past generation, was installed in Dublin Castle\r\nas Chief Secretary. I can imagine that nothing could have been more\r\ndistasteful to his generous spirit than to be obliged to use the\r\nhackneyed weapons of brute force in the pursuance of British policy.\r\nAs an answer to the agitation for compulsory land purchase and a\r\nsettlement of the western problem Mr Wyndham introduced in 1902 a Land\r\nPurchase Bill which fell deplorably short of the necessities of the\r\nsituation. It would have deprived the tenants of all free will in the\r\nmatter of the price they would be obliged to sell at, and left them\r\nwholly at the mercy of two landlord nominees on the Estates\r\nCommissioners, whilst it did not even pretend to find any remedy for\r\nthe two most crying national scandals of the western \"congests\" and\r\nthe homeless evicted tenants. No doubt there were many good and\r\nwell-meaning men in the Party, and out of it, who thought this Bill\r\nshould have been accepted as \"an instalment of justice.\" But there are\r\ntimes when to be moderate is to be criminally weak, and this was one\r\nof them. It is as certain as anything in life or politics can be that\r\nif the Bill of 1902 had been accepted, the Irish tenants would be\r\nstill going gaily on under the old rent-paying conditions. The United\r\nIrish League was still in the first blush of its pristine vigour, and\r\nwhen the delegates of the National Directory came up from the country\r\nto Dublin they soon showed the mettle they were made of. They wanted\r\nno paltry compromises, and it was then and there decided to enter upon\r\na virile campaign against rack-renters, grazing monopolists and\r\nland-grabbers such as would convince the Government in a single winter\r\nhow grossly they had under-estimated the requirements of the country.\r\n\r\nSome of the older men of the Party were pessimistic about the new\r\ncampaign. Messrs Dillon, Davitt and T.P. O'Connor wrote a letter to Mr\r\nO'Brien remonstrating with him, in a tone of gentle courtesy, on the\r\nextreme character of his speeches and actions. But Mr O'Brien was not\r\nto be deflected from his purpose by any friendly pipings of this kind.\r\nThe country was with him. The country was roused to a pitch of\r\npassionate resistance to the Wyndham Bill, and the Government, seeing\r\nwhich way the wind blew, and realising that the time for half-measures\r\nwas past, withdrew their precious Purchase Bill. Then followed a\r\nfierce conflict along the old lines. The Government sought to suppress\r\nthe popular agitation by the usual antiquated methods. Proclamation\r\nfollowed proclamation, until two-thirds of the Irish counties, and the\r\ncities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick, were proclaimed under the\r\nCoercion Act and the ordinary tribunals of justice abolished. Public\r\nmeetings were suppressed. The leaders of the people were thrown into\r\nprison: at one time no less than ten members of Parliament were in\r\njail. The country was seething with turmoil and discontent and there\r\nwas no knowing where the matter would end. The landlords, feeling the\r\nnecessity for counter-action of some kind, organised a Land Trust of\r\n£100,000 to prosecute Messrs Redmond, Davitt, Dillon and O'Brien for\r\nconspiracy. The United Irish League replied by starting a Defence Fund\r\nand arranging that Messrs Redmond, Davitt and Dillon should go to the\r\nUnited States to make an appeal in its support. All the elements of\r\nsocial convulsion were gathering their strength, when an unknown\r\ncountry gentleman wrote a letter to the Irish newspapers dated 2nd\r\nSeptember 1902, in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"For the last two hundred years the land war in this country has raged\r\nfiercely and continuously, bearing in its train stagnation of trade,\r\nparalysis of commercial business and enterprise and producing hatred\r\nand bitterness between the various sections and classes of the\r\ncommunity. To-day the United Irish League is confronted by the Irish\r\nLand Trust, and we see both combinations eager and ready to renew the\r\nunending conflict. I do not believe there is an Irishman, whatever his\r\npolitical feeling, creed or position, who does not yearn to see a true\r\nsettlement of the present chaotic, disastrous and ruinous struggle. In\r\nthe best interests, therefore, of Ireland and my countrymen I beg most\r\nearnestly to invite the Duke of Abercorn, Mr John Redmond, M.P., Lord\r\nBarrymore, Colonel Saunderson, M.P., the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the\r\nO'Conor Don, Mr William O'Brien, M.P., and Mr T.W. Russell, M.P., to a\r\nConference to be held in Dublin within one month from this date. An\r\nhonest, simple and practical suggestion will be submitted and I am\r\nconfident that a settlement will be arrived at.\"\r\n\r\nThe country rubbed its eyes to see who it was that had put forward\r\nthis audacious but not entirely original proposal. (It had been\r\nsuggested by Archbishop Walsh fifteen years before.) Captain John\r\nShawe-Taylor's name suggested nothing to the Nationalist leaders. They\r\nhad never heard of him before. In the landlord camp he stood for\r\nnothing and had no authority--he was simply the young son of a Galway\r\nsquire, with entire unselfishness and boundless patience, who\r\nconceived that he had a mission to settle this tremendous problem that\r\nhad been rendered only the more keen by forty-two Acts of the Imperial\r\nParliament that had been vainly passed for its settlement. It is\r\nsurely one of the strangest chances of history that where generations\r\nof statesmen and parliaments had failed the _via media_ for a\r\nfinal arrangement should have been made by an unknown officer who\r\nprosecuted his purpose to such effect that he forced his way into the\r\ncounsels of the American Clan-na-Gael, and even, as we are told,\r\n\"beyond the ante-chambers of royalty itself.\" It is probable that\r\nCaptain Shawe-Taylor's invitation would have been regarded as the\r\nusual Press squib had it not been followed two days later by a public\r\ncommunication from Mr Wyndham in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"No Government can settle the Irish Land Question. It must be settled\r\nby the parties interested. The extent of useful action on the part of\r\nany Government is limited to providing facilities, in so far as that\r\nmay be possible, for giving effect to any settlement arrived at by the\r\nparties. It is not for the Government to express an opinion on the\r\nopportuneness of the moment chosen for holding a conference or on the\r\nselection of the persons invited to attend. Those who come together\r\nwill do so on their own initiative and responsibility. Any conference\r\nis a step in the right direction if it brings the prospect of a\r\nsettlement between the parties near, and as far as it enlarges the\r\nprobable scope of operations under such a settlement.\"\r\n\r\nThis official declaration gave an importance and a significance to\r\nCaptain Shawe-Taylor's letter which otherwise would never have\r\nattached to it. The confession that \"no Government can settle the\r\nIrish Land Question\" was in itself a most momentous admission. It was\r\nthe most ample justification of nationalism, which held that a foreign\r\nParliament was incompetent to legislate for Irish affairs, and now the\r\naccredited mouthpiece of the Government in Ireland had formally\r\nsubscribed to this doctrine. This admission was in itself and in its\r\noutflowing an event comparable only to Gladstone's conversion to Home\r\nRule. It amounted to a challenge to Irishmen to prove their competence\r\nto settle the most sorely-beset difficulty that afflicted their\r\ncountry. Not only were Irishmen invited to settle this particularly\r\nIrish question, but they were given what was practically an official\r\nassurance that the Unionist Party would sponsor their agreement,\r\nwithin the limits of reason.\r\n\r\nImmediately Captain Shawe-Taylor's proposal became canvassed of the\r\nnewspapers and the politicians. Mr Dillon seemed to be sceptical of\r\nit, as a transparent landlord dodge. It was, however, enthusiastically\r\nwelcomed by the _Freeman_, whilst _The Daily Express_, the\r\norgan of the more unbending of the territorialists, denounced it\r\nmercilessly, and no sooner did the Duke of Abercorn, Lord Barrymore,\r\nthe O'Conor Don and Colonel Saunderson learn that Mr Redmond, the Lord\r\nMayor of Dublin, Mr T.W. Russell and Mr O'Brien were willing to join\r\nthe Conference than they wrote to Captain Shawe-Taylor declining his\r\ninvitation. The Landowners Convention, the official landlord\r\norganisation, also by an overwhelming majority decided against any\r\npeace parley with the tenants' representatives. But the forces in\r\nfavour of a conference were daily gaining force even amongst the\r\nlandlord class; whilst on the tenants' side a meeting of the Irish\r\nCatholic Hierarchy, attended by three archbishops and twenty-four\r\nbishops, with Cardinal Logue in the chair, cordially approved the Land\r\nConference project and put on record their earnest hope \"that all\r\nthose on whose co-operation the success of this most important\r\nmovement depends may approach the consideration of it in the spirit of\r\nconciliation in which it has been initiated.\" The Irish Party, on the\r\nmotion of Mr Dillon, also unanimously adopted a resolution approving\r\nof the action taken by Messrs Redmond, O'Brien and Harrington in\r\nexpressing their willingness to meet the landlord representatives. The\r\nmass of the landlords were so far from submitting to the veto of the\r\nLandowners' Convention that, headed by men of such commanding position\r\nand ability as the Earl of Dunraven, Lord Castletown, the Earl of\r\nMeath, Lord Powerscourt, the Earl of Mayo, Colonel Hutcheson-Poë and\r\nMr Lindsay Talbot Crosbie, they formed a Conciliation Committee of\r\ntheir own to test the opinion of the landlords over the heads of the\r\nLandowners Convention. The plebiscite taken by this Committee more\r\nthan justified them. By a vote of 1128 to 578 the landlords of Ireland\r\ndeclared themselves in favour of a Conference, and empowered the\r\nConciliation Committee to nominate representatives on their behalf.\r\n\r\nThus the first stage of the struggle for a settlement by consent was\r\nvictoriously carried.\r\n\r\nThe next stage was the discussion of the terms upon which the\r\nlandlords would allow themselves to be expropriated throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of the land. Here there were, unfortunately,\r\nviolent divergences of opinion on the tenants' side. Mr O'Brien\r\npostulated, as an essential ingredient of any settlement that could\r\nhope for success, that the State should step in with a liberal bonus\r\nto bridge over the difference between what the tenants could afford to\r\ngive and the landlords afford to take. When this proposal was first\r\nmooted it was regarded as a counsel of perfection, and Mr O'Brien was\r\nlooked upon as a genial visionary or a well-meaning optimist. But\r\nnobody thought it was a demand that the Government or Parliament would\r\nagree to. Happily, however, for the foresight of Mr O'Brien, it was\r\nhis much-derided bonus scheme which became the very pivot of the Land\r\nConference Report.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile events were moving rapidly behind the scenes. It was\r\nconveyed to Messrs Redmond, Davitt, Dillon and O'Brien that Mr Wyndham\r\nhad offered the Under-Secretaryship for Ireland to Sir Antony\r\nMacDonnell, who had lately retired from the position of Governor of\r\nBengal. They were told by his brother, Dr Mark Antony MacDonnell, who\r\nwas one of the Nationalist members, that Sir Antony was hesitating\r\nmuch as to his decision. Sir Antony conveyed that he had made it clear\r\nto Mr Wyndham that, as he was an Irish Nationalist and a believer in\r\nself-government, he could not think of going to Ireland to administer\r\na Coercion regime, and, further, that he favoured a bold and generous\r\nsettlement of the University difficulty. Mr Wyndham, it was\r\nunderstood, had given the necessary assurances, and Sir Antony now\r\nwished it to be conveyed to the Irish leaders that he would not accept\r\nthe post against their will or without a certain measure, at least, of\r\nbenevolent toleration on their part.\r\n\r\nAll these happenings foreshadowed a joyous transformation of the\r\npolitical scene, to the incalculable advantage of those who had made\r\nsuch a magnificent stand for Irish rights; but the Irish Party was\r\ndetermined that until rumours had crystallised into realities they\r\nwere going to relax none of their extra-constitutional pressure upon\r\nthe Government. It was, for instance, resolved to begin the Autumn\r\nSession with a resounding protest against Coercion and to carry on the\r\nconflict in the country more determinedly than ever.\r\n\r\nThe just and reasonable demand for a day to debate the administration\r\nwas unaccountably avoided by the Government, whose reply was that a\r\nday would be granted if the demand came from the official Liberal\r\nOpposition. The Nationalists could not submit to this degradation of\r\ntheir independent position in Parliament, and when they attempted to\r\nsecure their end by a motion for the adjournment of the House they\r\nfound that two Irish Unionists had \"blocked\" them by placing on the\r\nOrder Paper certain omnibus resolutions on the state of Ireland. Since\r\nthe days of Parnellite obstruction such scenes were not witnessed as\r\nthose that followed. The Party defied all rules of law and order,\r\nworried the Government by all sort of lawless interruptions and\r\nirrelevant questions, flagrantly flouted the authority of the chair\r\nand, finally, after a week of Parliamentary anarchy, it was determined\r\nthat even more extreme courses would be adopted unless the\r\nconstitutional right of Ireland to be heard in the Chamber was\r\nconceded. Hint of this was conveyed to Mr Speaker Gully, who,\r\nregardful of the honour of the House, used his good offices with the\r\nGovernment to such effect that the blocking motions were incontinently\r\nwithdrawn and the discussion in due course took place.\r\n\r\nWhilst these developments were taking place Mr O'Brien had taken every\r\npossible precaution to guard himself against any charge of autocracy\r\nin the direction of the movement, whether in Parliament or in the\r\ncountry. At the request of his colleagues on the Land Conference he\r\nhad drafted a Memorandum containing the basis of settlement which\r\nwould be acceptable to Nationalist opinion. This was submitted to\r\nMessrs Redmond, Davitt and Sexton, with an urgent entreaty for their\r\nfreest criticism or any supplementary suggestions of their own. None\r\nof these could, therefore, complain that Mr O'Brien was attempting to\r\ndo anything over their heads. And impartial judgment will declare that\r\nif either Mr Sexton, Mr Dillon or Mr Davitt had views of their own, or\r\nhad any vital disagreements with Mr O'Brien's suggestions, now was the\r\ntime to declare them. Far from committing himself to any dissent, when\r\nMr O'Brien, after a fortnight, wrote to Mr Sexton for the return of\r\nhis Memorandum, Mr Sexton wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I have read the Memo. carefully two or three times and now return it\r\nto you as you want to use it and have no other copy. It will take some\r\ntime to look into your proposals with anything like sufficient care.\r\nYou will hear from me as soon as I think I can say anything that may\r\npossibly be of use.\"\r\n\r\nBe it here noted that Mr Sexton never did communicate, even when he\r\nhad looked into Mr O'Brien's proposals \"with sufficient care.\" Later\r\nhe waged implacable war on the Land Conference Report and the Land Act\r\nfrom his commanding position as Managing Director of _The Freeman's\r\nJournal_ (the official National organ). He did so in violation of\r\nthe promise on which the Party had entrusted him with that position,\r\nthat he would never interfere in its political direction.\r\n\r\nOther informal meetings between Sir Antony MacDonnell and the Irish\r\nleaders followed, the purpose of Sir Antony being, before he accepted\r\noffice in the Irish Government, to gather the views of leading\r\nIrishmen, especially as to the possibility of a genuine land\r\nsettlement, which he regarded as the foundation of all else.\r\nSubsequently it transpired that Mr Sexton had engaged in some\r\nnegotiations on his own account with Sir Antony MacDonnell, and it is\r\nnot improbable that part at least of his quarrel with the Land\r\nConference was that the settlement propounded by it superseded and\r\nsupplanted his own scheme. Neither Mr O'Brien nor his friends were\r\nmade aware of these private pourparlers, entered into without any\r\nvestige of authority from the Party or its leader, and they only\r\nlearnt of them casually afterwards. The incident is instructive of how\r\nthe path of the peacemaker is ever beset with difficulties, even from\r\namong his own household.\r\n\r\nAfter surmounting a whole host of obstacles the Land Conference at\r\nlong last assembled in the Mansion House, Dublin, on 20th December\r\n1902. Mr Redmond submitted the final selection of the tenants'\r\nrepresentatives to a vote of the Irish Party and, with the exception\r\nof one member who declined to vote, the choice fell unanimously upon\r\nthose named in Captain Shawe-Taylor's letter. Although their findings\r\nwere subsequently subjected to much embittered attack, no one had any\r\nright to impugn their authority, capacity, judgment or intimate\r\nknowledge of the tenants' case.\r\n\r\nThe landlords' representatives were also fortunately chosen. The Earl\r\nof Dunraven was a man of the most statesmanlike comprehension, whose\r\nhigh patriotic purpose in all the intervening years has won for him an\r\nenduring and an honourable place in the history of his country. He\r\nstrove to imbue his own landlord class with a new vision of their duty\r\nand their destiny, and if only a few of the later converts to the\r\nnational claim of Ireland had supported him when he came forward\r\nfirst, in favour of the policy of national reconciliation, many\r\nchapters of tragedy in our national life would never have been\r\nwritten. With a close knowledge of his labours and his personality I\r\ncan write this of him--that a man more passionately devoted to his\r\ncountry, more sincerely anxious to serve her highest interests, or\r\nmore intrepid in pursuing the courses and supporting the causes he\r\ndeems right, does not live. He has been a light in his generation and\r\nto his class, and he deserves well of all men who admire a moral\r\ncourage superior to all the shafts of shallow criticism and a\r\npatriotism which undoubtedly seeks the best, as he sees it, for the\r\nbenefit of his country. And more than this cannot be said of the\r\ngreatest patriot who ever lived. The Earl of Mayo also brought a fine\r\nidealism and high patriotism to the Conference Council Board. He had a\r\ngenuine enthusiasm for the development of Irish industries and was the\r\nmoving spirit in the Irish Arts and Crafts Exhibitions. Colonel\r\nHutcheson-Poë, a gallant soldier, who had lost a leg in Kitchener's\r\nSoudan Campaign, a gentleman of sound judgment and excellent sense,\r\nwas one of the moderating elements in the Conference. Finally, Colonel\r\nNugent Everard represented one of the oldest Anglo-Irish families of\r\nthe Pale and the author of several projects tending to the betterment\r\nof the people. The tenants' representatives presented a concise list\r\nof their own essential requirements as drafted by Mr O'Brien. It was\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n   BASIS.--ABOLITION OF DUAL OWNERSHIP\r\n\r\n1. For landlords, net second-term income, less all outgoings.\r\n\r\n2. For occupiers, reduction of not less than 20 per cent. in\r\n   second-term rents or first-term correspondingly reduced. Decennial\r\n   reductions to be retained.\r\n\r\n3. Difference between landlords' terms and occupiers' terms to be made\r\n   up by State bonus and reduced interest with, in addition, purchase\r\n   money in cash and increased value for resale of mansion and demesne.\r\n\r\n4. Complete settlement of evicted tenants' question an indispensable\r\n   condition.\r\n\r\n5. Special and drastic treatment for all congested districts in the\r\n   country (as defined by the Bill of 1902).\r\n\r\n6. Sales to be between parties or through official commissioners as\r\n   parties would prefer.\r\n\r\n7. Non-judicial and future tenants to be admitted.\r\n\r\n8. (Query.) Sporting rights to be a matter of agreement.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to go into any detailed account of what transpired at\r\nthe sittings (six in number) of the Land Conference. All this\r\ninformation is available in Mr O'Brien's _An Olive Branch in\r\nIreland_. Suffice it to say that seven out of eight of the tenants'\r\nrequirements were conceded outright and the eighth was covered by a\r\ncompromise which would have enabled any tenant in the country, whether\r\nnon-judicial or future tenants, to become the proprietor of his own\r\nholding on reasonable terms. On 4th January 1903 a unanimous report\r\nwas published. The country scarcely expected this, and its joy at this\r\never-memorable achievement was correspondingly greater. It was\r\ninconceivable that the landlords should have, in solemn treaty, signed\r\ntheir own death warrant as territorialists, yet this was the amazing\r\ndeed to which they affixed their sign manual when their four\r\nrepresentatives signed the Land Conference Report.\r\n\r\nEver since the first Anglo-Norman set foot in Ireland and began to\r\ndespoil the ancient clans of their land there has been trouble in\r\nconnection with the Irish Land Question. The new race of landlords\r\nregarded their Irish land purely as a speculation, not as a home; they\r\nwere in great part absentees, having no aim in Ireland beyond drawing\r\ntheir rents. They had no duties to their tenants in the sense that\r\nEnglish landlords have. They had no natural ties with the country and\r\nthey regarded themselves as free from all the duties or obligations of\r\nownership. They never advanced capital for the improvement of the land\r\nor the erection of buildings, and never put a farthing into the\r\ncultivation of the soil. The tenant had to do everything out of his\r\nown sweat and blood--build his home and out-offices, clean and drain\r\nthe land, make the fences, lay down the roads and, when he had done\r\nall this and made the property more valuable, his rent was raised on\r\nhim, even beyond the value of the improvements he had effected. Woe to\r\nthe industrious man, for he was taxed upon his industry! And yet who\r\nis not familiar with the foolish and the ignorant tribe of scribblers\r\nwho, with no knowledge of the facts, prate about \"the lazy Irish\"? And\r\nif they were lazy--which I entirely deny--who made them so? Had they\r\nno justification for their \"laziness\"? Why should they wear their\r\nlives out so that a rapacious landlord whom they never saw should live\r\nin riotousness and debauchery in the hells of London or the Continent?\r\n\r\n\"One could count on one's fingers,\" said the Cowper Commission in\r\n1887, \"the number of Irish estates on which the improvements have been\r\nmade by the landlord.\" The Irish landlord class never did a thing for\r\nIreland except to drain her of her life-blood--to rob and depopulate\r\nand destroy, to make exaction after exaction upon the industry of her\r\npeasants, until their wrongs cried aloud for redress, if not for\r\nvengeance. In England it was estimated in 1897 that the landlord class\r\nhad spent in investments in landlord property a sum estimated at\r\n£700,000,000. These can justly claim some right in the land. In\r\nIreland the landlord was simply the owner of \"the raw earth\"--the bare\r\nproprietor of the soil, a dead weight upon the industry and honest\r\ntoil of the tenant, receiving a rent upon the values that the labour\r\nand the energy of generations of members of a particular family had\r\ncreated. The Irish landlord and his horde of hangers-on--his agents,\r\nhis bailiffs, his process-servers, his bog-rangers, his\r\nrent-warners--created a system built upon corruption, maintained in\r\ntyranny, and enforced with all the ruthless severities of foreign laws\r\nenacted solely for the benefit of England's garrison. \"I can imagine\r\nno fault,\" said Mr Arthur Balfour, speaking as Prime Minister in the\r\nHouse of Commons, 4th May 1903, \"attaching to any land system which\r\ndoes not attach to the Irish system.\" Evictions in Ireland came to be\r\nknown as \"sentences of death,\" so cruel and numerous were they until\r\nthe popular agitation was strong enough to check them.\r\n\r\nEven the Gladstonian legislation of 1881, though it admittedly did\r\nsomething substantial towards redressing the balance between landlord\r\nand tenant by securing to the tenants what were known as \"the three\r\nF.'s \"--viz. Fixity of Tenure, Fair Rent, and Free Sale--yet left the\r\nquestion in a wholly unsettled state. The fixing of fair rents, no\r\ndoubt, acted as a curb on landlord rapacity, but from the tenants'\r\npoint of view it was a wholly vicious, indeterminate and\r\nunsatisfactory system. It was incentive to indifferent farming, since\r\nthe commissioners who had the fixing of rents, and the inspectors who\r\nexamined the farms, made their valuations upon the farms as they saw\r\nthem. True, the tenant could claim for his improvements, but in\r\npractice this was no real safeguard. The more industrious the tenant\r\nthe higher the rent--the less industrious and the less capable the\r\nlower the figure to be paid.\r\n\r\nHence, after the failure of countless Acts of Parliament, it was borne\r\nin upon all earnest land-reformers that there could be only one final\r\nand satisfactory solution: that was the abolition of dual\r\nownership--in other words, the buying out of the landlord and the\r\nestablishment of the tenant in the single and undisputed ownership of\r\nthe soil on fair and equitable terms. A tentative start had been made\r\nin land purchase by the Land Purchase Act of 1885--called, after its\r\nauthor, the Ashbourne Act. This experiment had proved an immense\r\nsuccess, for in six years the ten millions sterling assigned for its\r\noperations were exhausted and 25,867 tenants had been turned into\r\nowners of their farms.\r\n\r\nIt became clear that a scheme of purchase which would, within a\r\ndefinite period, root out the last vestige of landlordism was the one\r\nonly real and true solution for the land problem. And now, blessed\r\nday, and glory to the eyes that had lived to see it, and undying\r\nhonour to the men whose genius and sacrifices had made it possible,\r\nthe decree had gone forth that end there must be to landlordism. And,\r\nwonder of wonders, the landlords themselves had agreed to the fiat\r\ndecreeing their own extinction as a ruling caste. It was with\r\nheartfelt hope and relief, and with the sense of a great victory\r\nachieved, that the country received the wondrous news of the success\r\nof the Land Conference. The dawn of a glorious promise had broken\r\nthrough the long night of Ireland's suffering, but the mischief-makers\r\nwere already at work to see that the noonday sun of happiness did not\r\nshine too strongly or too steadily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                LAND PURCHASE AND A DETERMINED CAMPAIGN\r\n                               TO KILL IT\r\n\r\n\r\nI can only rapidly sketch the events that followed the publication of\r\nthe Land Conference Report. Mr Sexton made it his business in _The\r\nFreeman's Journal_ to decry its findings on the sinister ground\r\nthat they offered too much to the landlords and were not sufficiently\r\nfavourable to the tenants, sneering at the proposal for a bonus,\r\nhinting that no Government would find money for this purpose. Mr\r\nDavitt, who was an earnest disciple of Henry George's ideal of Land\r\nNationalisation, naturally enough found nothing to like in the\r\nproposals for land purchase, which would set up a race of\r\npeasant-proprietors who would never consent to surrender their\r\nownership to the State and would consequently make the application of\r\nthe principles of Land Nationalisation for ever impossible in Ireland.\r\nBesides, Michael Davitt had cause for personal hatred of landlordism,\r\nwhich exiled his parents after eviction, and incidentally meant the\r\nloss of an arm to himself, and a violence of language which would be\r\nexcusable in him would not be justifiable or allowable in the cases of\r\nmen who had not suffered similarly, such as Messrs Dillon and Sexton.\r\nYet the fault was not theirs if the Land Conference did not end in\r\nwreckage and such a glorious chance of national reconciliation and\r\nappeasement was not lost to Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sir Antony MacDonnell, greatly daring and, I would\r\nlikewise say, greatly patriotic, accepted the offer of the Irish\r\nUnder-Secretaryship in a spirit of self-abnegation beyond praise. Mr\r\nRedmond and Mr O'Brien had, at his request, met him, early in\r\nFebruary, 1903, to discuss the provisions of the contemplated Purchase\r\nBill. It may be remarked that Messrs Dillon and Davitt were invited to\r\nmeet Sir Antony on the same occasion, but they declined. They\r\napparently desired the position of greater freedom and less\r\nresponsibility, from which they could deliver their attacks upon their\r\nfriends. They received little support from the country in their\r\nguerrilla warfare on the Land Conference findings. The Standing\r\nCommittee of the Catholic Hierarchy left no room for doubt as to their\r\nviews. They declared the holding of the Land Conference \"to be an\r\nevent of the best augury for the future welfare of both classes\"\r\n(landlords and tenants), and they expressed the hope that its\r\nunanimity would result in legislation which would settle the Land\r\nQuestion once for all \"and give the Irish people of every class a fair\r\nopportunity to live and serve their native land.\" The Irish Party and\r\nthe National Directory of the United Irish League, the two bodies\r\ninvested with sovereign authority to declare the national policy,\r\nunanimously, at specially convened meetings, approved the findings of\r\nthe Land Conference and accepted them as the basis of a satisfactory\r\nsettlement of the Land Question. Neither Mr Dillon nor Mr Davitt\r\nattended either of these meetings. Indeed, Mr Dillon ostentatiously\r\ntook his departure from Dublin on the morning the meetings were held,\r\nbut strangely enough he attended an adjourned meeting of the Party at\r\nWestminster the following day and opposed a proposal to raise the\r\nquestion of the Land Conference Report on the Address. Mr Redmond\r\nentered a dignified protest against Mr Dillon's conduct, pointing out\r\nthat the previous day was Mr Dillon's proper opportunity for\r\nsubmitting any objections of his to his colleagues of the Party and of\r\nthe National Directory. Mr Dillon did not find a single supporter for\r\nhis attitude, and he was obliged to disclaim, with some heat, that he\r\nhad any grievance in reference to the Conference. Next day he went\r\nabroad for the benefit of his health.\r\n\r\nThe debate on the Amendment to the Address had the most gratifying\r\nresults. Mr Wyndham accepted, in principle, the Land Conference\r\nAgreement and announced that the Government would smooth the\r\noperations of Land Purchase by a bonus of twelve millions sterling as\r\na free grant to Ireland. The debate accomplished another striking\r\nsuccess, that it elicited from all the men of light and leading in the\r\nLiberal Party--from Mr Morley, Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman, Sir E. Grey,\r\nMr Haldane and Mr John Burns--expressions of cordial adhesion to the\r\npolicy of pacification outlined by the Chief Secretary, thus effecting\r\nthe obliteration of all English Party distinctions for the first time\r\nwhere one of Ireland's supreme interests was concerned. It required\r\nonly the continuance of this spirit to give certain assurance of\r\nIreland's early deliverance from all her woes and troubles. But an\r\nadverse fate, in the form of certain perverse politicians, ordained it\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nOn 25th March 1903 Mr Wyndham introduced his Bill. It adopted fully\r\nthe fundamental principles of the Land Conference and undertook to\r\nfind Imperial funds for the complete extinction of landlordism in\r\nIreland within a period which Mr Wyndham estimated at fifteen years.\r\nFurthermore the tenants were to obtain the loans on cheaper terms than\r\nhad ever been known before--viz. an interest of 2-3/4 per cent. and a\r\nsinking fund of 1/2 per cent., being a reduction in the tenants'\r\nannuity from £4 to £3, 5s. as compared with the best of the previous\r\nActs. In addition a State grant-in-aid to the extent of\r\n£12,000,000--roughly equivalent to three years' purchase--was produced\r\nto bridge the gap between what the tenants could afford to pay and the\r\nlandlords to accept. The Bill fell short of the requirements of the\r\nLand Conference in certain respects, notably in that it proposed to\r\nwithhold one-eighth of the freehold from the tenants as an assertion\r\nof State right in the land, and that the clauses dealing with the\r\nEvicted Tenants and Congested questions were vague and inadequate.\r\nOther minor defects there also were, but nothing that might not be\r\nremedied in Committee by conciliatory adjustments. A National\r\nConvention was summoned for 16th April to consider whether the Bill\r\nshould be accepted or otherwise. Previously there was much\r\nsubterranean communication between Messrs Dillon, Davitt, Sexton and\r\nT.P. O'Connor, all with calculated intent to damage or destroy the\r\nBill. And it is also clear that certain members of the Irish Party\r\n(Messrs Dillon and T.P. O'Connor), who were pledge-bound to support\r\nmajority rule \"in or out of Parliament,\" were carrying on official\r\nnegotiations of their own with the Minister in charge of the Bill and\r\nwere using the organ of the Party to discredit principles and\r\nproposals to which the Party had given its unanimous assent. It would\r\nnot, in the circumstances, be unjust to stigmatise this conduct as\r\ndisloyalty, if not exactly treachery, to the recorded decisions of the\r\nParty. At any rate it was the source and origin of incredible mischief\r\nand the most deplorable consequences to Ireland. The opponents of the\r\nBill made a concerted effort to stampede the National Convention from\r\narriving at any decision regarding the Bill. They wanted it to\r\npostpone judgment. But the Convention, in every sense magnificently\r\nrepresentative of all that was sound and sincere in the constitutional\r\nmovement, was too much alive to all the glorious possibilities of the\r\npolicy of national reconciliation which was taking shape and form\r\nbefore their eyes to brook any of the ill-advised counsels of those\r\nwho had determined insidiously on the wreck of this policy.\r\n\r\nIn all the great Convention there were only two voices raised in\r\nsupport of the rejection of the Bill. And when Mr Davitt moved the\r\nmotion, concerted between Mr T.P. O'Connor, Mr Sexton and himself,\r\nthat the Convention should suspend judgment until it was brought in\r\nits amended Third Reading Form before an adjourned sitting of the\r\nConvention, he was so impressed by the enthusiastic unanimity of the\r\ndelegates that he offered, after some parley, to withdraw his motion,\r\nand thus this great and authoritative assembly pledged the faith of\r\nthe Irish nation to the policy of national reconciliation and gave its\r\nloyal adhesion to the authors of that policy.\r\n\r\nBut this decision of the people, constitutionally and legitimately\r\nexpressed, was not long to remain unchallenged. Immediately after the\r\nConvention Mr Davitt waited upon Mr Redmond, at the Gresham Hotel,\r\nDublin, and blandly told him: \"I have had a wire from Dillon to-day\r\nfrom the Piraeus, to say he is starting by the first boat for home and\r\nfrom this day forth O'Brien and yourself will have Dillon, T.P. and\r\nmyself on your track.\" Thus was set on foot what, with engaging\r\ncandour, Mr Davitt himself later described in an article he\r\ncontributed to _The Independent Review_ as \"a determined\r\ncampaign\" against the national policy which had been authoritatively\r\nendorsed and approved by every organisation in the country entitled to\r\nspeak on the subject. The country has had to pay much in misery, in\r\nthe postponement of its most cherished hopes and in the holding up of\r\nland purchase over great areas owing to the folly, the madness and the\r\ntreachery of this \"determined campaign.\" Mr Dillon, at a later stage,\r\nwith a certain Machiavellian cunning, raised the cry of \"Unity\" from\r\nevery platform in the country against those who had never acted a\r\ndisloyal part in all their lives, whilst his own political conscience\r\nnever seemed to trouble him when he was flagrantly and foully defying\r\nthat very principle of unity which he had pledged himself to maintain\r\nand uphold \"in or out of Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nThe National Convention was followed by an event which might easily\r\nhave been made a turning point in Ireland's good fortune had it been\r\nproperly availed of. Lord Dunraven and his landlord Conciliation\r\nCommittee met the day after the Land Convention and resolved to\r\nsupport sixteen out of the seventeen Nationalist amendments. They\r\nfurthermore sent a message to Mr Redmond offering to co-operate\r\nactively with the members of the Irish Party throughout the Committee\r\nstage of the Wyndham Bill. Every consideration of national policy and\r\nprudence would seem to urge the acceptance of this generous offer. It\r\nwould, if accepted, be the outward and visible sign of that new spirit\r\nof grace that had entered into Irish relations with the foregathering\r\nof the Land Conference. But fear of what Mr Dillon and the\r\n_Freeman_ might do if this open association with a landlord--even\r\nif a friendly landlord--interest took place apparently operated on Mr\r\nRedmond's judgment. Although urged by Mr O'Brien, who made the utmost\r\nallowance for the leader's difficulties, to accept the offer of Lord\r\nDunraven and his friends for continued co-operation, Mr Redmond\r\ntemporised, and the opportunity passed into the limbo of golden\r\npossibilities gone wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Dillon, in pursuance of his wire to Mr Davitt, returned from\r\nhis holiday, he proceeded to make good the threat to be \"on the track\r\nof Redmond and O'Brien.\" He made himself as troublesome as he could\r\nduring the Committee stage of the Bill and did his utmost to force its\r\nrejection. He sought to commit the Party to a policy which must have\r\nmeant the defeat or withdrawal of the measure. He made vicious\r\npersonal attacks upon Lord Dunraven. He did everything in his power to\r\ndelay and frustrate the passage of the Bill in Committee. And the most\r\ngenerous construction that can be placed upon his actions is that he\r\ndid all this in support of the theory, which he is known to have\r\nconsistently held, that Home Rule should precede the settlement of the\r\nLand Question, or any other Irish question. Notwithstanding Mr\r\nDillon's criticisms, not then well understood either in the Party or\r\nthe country, the Bill at length emerged triumphantly from its ordeal,\r\nwith the good will of all parties in Parliament. It should have\r\ncreated--and it would, if it had only been given a fair chance--a new\r\nheaven and a new earth in Ireland. As far as could be prognosticated\r\nall the omens were favourable. Even the atmosphere of administration,\r\nso important a matter where any Irish Act is concerned, was of the\r\nmost auspicious kind. The Lord-Lieutenant was Lord Dudley, who was\r\nimmensely popular in Ireland, and who had made public proclamation of\r\nhis desire that \"Ireland should be governed in accordance with Irish\r\nideas.\" Two out of the three Estates Commissioners, in whose hands the\r\nactual administration of the Act lay, were men of whose absolute\r\nimpartiality the Nationalist opinion of the country was assured. Sir\r\nAntony MacDonnell was the power in Dublin Castle, and not much likely\r\nto be intimidated by the permanent gang there. All that was required\r\nwas that the Irish Party and the United Irish League should agree upon\r\na broad-based policy for combining the various classes affected to\r\nextract the best possible advantage from the provisions of the Act. A\r\nmeeting of the National Directory was summoned to formulate such a\r\npolicy, but shortly before it was held Mr Dillon went down to Swinford\r\nand, from the board-room of the workhouse there, definitely raised the\r\nstandard of revolt against the new Land Act. Nothing could be said\r\nagainst his action if he had come out from the Party and fulminated\r\nagainst its authority, but to remain a member of the Party and then to\r\nindict its conduct of the nation's business was, to put it mildly,\r\nindefensible. He denounced the new spirit of conciliation that had\r\nbeen so fast gaining ground, attacked the landlords, who had proved\r\nthemselves friendly to a settlement, in rather ferocious language, and\r\nspoke in violent terms of those who would \"in a moment of weakness\r\nmortgage the future of Ireland to an intolerable extent.\" Clearly Mr\r\nDillon intended carrying out his threat of \"taking the field\" against\r\nMr Redmond and Mr O'Brien and of damning the consequences. But the\r\ncountry was not yet \"rattled\" into disaffection by Mr Dillon's\r\nmelancholy vaticinations and rather vulgar appeals to the baser\r\npassions of greed and covetousness which are perhaps more firmly\r\nrooted in the peasant than in any other class.\r\n\r\nThe National Directory, unintimidated by Mr Dillon's pronouncement, met\r\nand calmly proceeded to formulate plans for the better working of the\r\nPurchase Act. A clear and definite plan of campaign was outlined for the\r\ntesting of the Act. Mr O'Brien was also in favour of handling the\r\ndisaffection of Mr Dillon and the _Freeman_ in straightforward manner\r\nand of pointing out to them their duty of loyally supporting the\r\ndecisions of the Party and of the League. Mr Redmond shrank from\r\ndecisive action. It was part of the weakness of his estimable character\r\nthat he always favoured \"the easier way.\" He thought that when the\r\nDirectory spoke out the recalcitrant elements would subside. Little did\r\nhe understand the malignant temper of the powerful group who, with the\r\naid of the supposedly national organ, were determined to kill the\r\noperations of the Purchase Act and to destroy the policy of Conciliation\r\nwhich had promised such splendid fruit in other directions. Mr Dillon\r\nwent to Swinford again and he and his associates did everything in their\r\npower to stir up a national panic and to spread the impression that the\r\nPurchase Act was a public calamity, \"a landlord swindle,\" and that it\r\nwould lead straight to national bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nEven yet those who sought the wreck and ruin of land purchase might be\r\nmet with and fought outright if the announcement had not appeared in\r\nthe _Freeman_ that Mr Redmond had sold his Wexford estate at\r\n\"24-1/2 years' purchase,\" or over two years' purchase higher in the\r\ncase of second-term rents and four and a half years' purchase in the\r\ncase of first-term rents than the prices which the National Directory\r\nhad a few weeks previously resolved to fight for, with all the force\r\nof the tenants' organisation as a fair standard. True enough Mr\r\nRedmond was able to plead later that these were not the terms finally\r\nagreed upon between his tenants and himself, and beyond all question\r\nhe made no profit out of the transaction. Where the mischief lay was\r\nin the original publication, which gave a headline to the landlords\r\nall over the country and, what was far more regrettable from the\r\npurely national standpoint, irretrievably tied the hands of Mr Redmond\r\nso far as making any heroic stand against Mr Dillon and his\r\nfellow-conspirators was concerned. Thus the country drifted along,\r\nbereft of firm leadership or strong guidance. Mr O'Brien had to hold\r\nhis hand whilst \"the determined campaigners\" were more boldly and\r\ndefiantly inveighing against the declared and adopted national policy\r\nand trampling upon every principle of Party discipline and loyalty.\r\nThe situation might have been saved if Mr Redmond had taken his\r\ncourage in both his hands, summoned the Party together and received\r\nfrom it an authoritative declaration defining anew the National policy\r\nand the danger that attended it from those who had set out recklessly\r\nto destroy it; or if he sought an opportunity for publicly recalling\r\nthe country to its duty and its allegiance to himself and to the Party\r\nwhose chosen leader he was. Mr Redmond was fully alive to the danger,\r\nbut he hesitated about taking that bold action which could alone bring\r\nthe recalcitrants to heel. He was afraid of doing anything which might\r\nprovoke a fresh \"split.\" Later he delivered himself of the\r\nunstatesmanlike and unworthy apophthegm: \"Better be united in support\r\nof a short-sighted and foolish policy than divided in support of a\r\nfar-sighted and wise one.\" This was the fatuous attitude which led him\r\ndown the steep declivity that ended so tragically for him and his\r\nreputation. In those fateful days, when so much was in the balance for\r\nthe future of Ireland, Mr O'Brien pressed his views earnestly upon Mr\r\nRedmond that unless he exercised his authority, and that of the Party\r\nand the Directory, it would be impossible for them to persevere in\r\ntheir existing programme, and that the only alternative left for him\r\nwould be to retire and leave those who had opposed the policy of\r\nConciliation a free stage for any more heroic projects they might\r\ncontemplate. Mr Redmond still remained indecisive and Mr\r\nO'Brien--whether wisely or unwisely will always remain a debatable\r\npoint with his friends--quietly quitted the stage, resigning his seat\r\nin Parliament, withdrawing from the Directory of the United Irish\r\nLeague, and ceasing publication of his weekly newspaper on the ground,\r\nas he says himself, that \"the authorised national policy having been\r\nmade unworkable, nothing remained, in order to save the country from\r\ndissension, except to leave its wreckers an absolutely free field for\r\nany alternative policy of their own.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the country was thrown into a state\r\nof stupefaction by Mr O'Brien's retirement. It did not know the reason\r\nof it. Very few members of the Party did. I was then a member of\r\nit--perhaps a little on the outer fringe, but still an ordinarily\r\nintelligent member--and I was not aware of the underground factors and\r\nforces which had caused this thunderbolt out of the blue, as it were.\r\nNeedless to say, the country was in a state of more abysmal ignorance\r\nstill, and it is questionable whether outside of Munster, owing to a\r\nscandalous Press boycott of Mr O'Brien's speeches for many years\r\nafterwards, the masses of the people ever had an understanding of the\r\nmotives which impelled him \"to stand down and out\" when he was\r\nundoubtedly supreme in the Party and in the United Irish League and\r\nwhen he might easily have overborne \"the determined campaigners\" if he\r\nhad only knit the issue with them in a fair and square fight. This,\r\nhowever, was the thing of all others he wished to avoid. Perhaps if he\r\ncould have foreseen how barren in any alternative policy his sapient\r\ncritics were to be he might have acted otherwise, but the credit is\r\ndue to him of making dissension impossible by leaving no second party\r\nto the quarrel.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at Limerick a few days after his retirement, Mr Redmond\r\navowed that Mr O'Brien's principles were his own, and added these\r\nmemorable words: \"But for Mr William O'Brien there would have been no\r\nLand Conference and no Land Act.\" Every effort was made to induce Mr\r\nO'Brien to withdraw his resignation. A delegation of the leading\r\ncitizens of Cork travelled all the way to Mayo to entreat him to\r\nreconsider his decision. To them he said: \"There is not the smallest\r\ndanger of any split either in the Party, or in the League, or in the\r\ncountry. There will be a perfectly free field for the development of\r\nany alternative policy; and I will not use my retirement in any way\r\nwhatever to criticise or obstruct; neither, I am certain, will anybody\r\nin the country who has any regard for my wishes.\"\r\n\r\nBut having got all they wanted, \"the determined campaigners\"\r\nmysteriously abandoned their determined campaign. Mr Dillon's health\r\nagain required that he should bask 'neath the sunny southern skies of\r\nItaly, whilst Mr Davitt betook himself to the United States, without\r\neither of them making a single speech or publishing a single\r\nsuggestion to the tenants how they were to guard themselves against\r\nthe \"inflated prices\" and the national insolvency they had been\r\nthreatening them with. Having destroyed the plans of the National\r\nDirectory for testing the Purchase Act they had no guidance of their\r\nown to offer. The tenants were left leaderless, to make their own\r\nbargains as best they could, with the inevitable result that the\r\nlandlords, thanks to \"the determined campaigners,\" were able to force\r\nup prices two years above the standard which the Directory of the\r\nLeague had decided to stand out and fight for.\r\n\r\nIt used to be said of Daniel O'Connell that whenever _The Times_\r\npraised him he subjected himself to an examination of conscience to\r\nfind out wherein he had offended as against Ireland. Likewise one\r\nwould have supposed that when Mr Dillon found himself patted on the\r\nback by the extreme Orange gang he might have asked himself: \"Wherein\r\nam I wrong to have earned the plaudits of these people?\" For if Mr\r\nDillon was rabid in his opposition to the policy of Conciliation the\r\nUlster Orangemen were ferocious in their denunciation of it, Mr Moore,\r\nK.C., referred to it as \"the cowardly, rotten, and sickening policy of\r\nConciliation.\" Small wonder that the Orange extremists should have\r\ndreaded this policy, since it had already been the means of creating\r\nin the North an Independent Orange Order, who unhesitatingly declared\r\nas the first article of their creed that they were \"Irishmen first of\r\nall,\" and who had an honest and enthusiastic spokesman in the House of\r\nCommons in the person of Mr Thomas Sloane, and an able and, indeed, a\r\nbrilliant leader in Ireland in Mr Lindsay Crawford. But so it\r\nwas--every advance towards national reconciliation and mutual\r\nunderstanding was opposed by those two divergent forces as if they had\r\na common interest in defeating it.\r\n\r\nMr O'Brien having retired from Cork, the vacancy should, in the\r\nordinary course, have been filled in the course of a few weeks. But\r\nthe Nationalists of \"the City by the Lee\" made it clear that they\r\nwanted no other representative than Mr O'Brien, and they forbade the\r\nissue of a writ for a new election. And so there was the extraordinary\r\nspectacle of a people who voluntarily disfranchised themselves rather\r\nthan give up the last hope of a policy of National Conciliation in\r\nwhich they descried a Home Rule settlement by Consent as surely as the\r\nabolition of landlordism already decreed. As an example of loyalty and\r\npersonal devotion, as well as of patriotic foresight, it would be\r\ndifficult to parallel it. Towards the close of the session of 1904 Mr\r\nJasper Tully, a more or less free lance member of the Party, took it\r\nupon himself to play them the trick of moving the writ for a new\r\nelection. And the Nationalists of Cork knew their own business so well\r\nthat, without a line of communication with Mr O'Brien, they had him\r\nnominated and re-elected without anybody dreaming that anything else\r\nwas humanly possible. There were no conditions attaching to Mr\r\nO'Brien's re-election. He was free to rejoin the Irish Party if it\r\nshould resume its position of twelve months ago or to remain out of it\r\nif a policy of mere destruction were persisted in. He was re-elected\r\nbecause the people of Cork had the most absolute confidence in his\r\nintegrity, good faith and political judgment, and because they were\r\nconvinced that his return to public life represented the only hope of\r\nthe resumption of the great policy in which their confidence never for\r\na moment wavered.\r\n\r\nWithin a week of Mr O'Brien's re-election an event took place which once\r\nagain made it possible for him to take up the threads of his policy\r\nwhere he had surrendered them. The landlords' Conference Committee, to\r\nthe number of three hundred of the leading Irish nobles and country\r\ngentlemen, met in Dublin and resolved themselves into a new Association,\r\nunder Lord Dunraven's leadership, which was named the Irish Reform\r\nAssociation. It immediately issued a manifesto proclaiming \"a policy of\r\nconciliation, of good will and of reform,\" by means of \"a union of all\r\nmoderate and progressive opinion irrespective of creed or class\r\nanimosities,\" with the object of \"the devolution to Ireland of a large\r\nmeasure of self-government\" without disturbing the Parliamentary Union\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nWithin three days of the publication of the manifesto Mr Redmond, who\r\nwas on a mission to the States pleading for Irish-American support,\r\ncabled: \"The announcement [of the Irish Reform Association] is of the\r\nutmost importance. It is simply a declaration for Home Rule and is quite\r\na wonderful thing. With these men with us Home Rule may come at any\r\nmoment.\" It is known that the idea of the Irish Reform Association had\r\nbeen talked over between Mr Wyndham, Lord Dunraven and Sir Antony\r\nMacDonnell, but it is probable that it would never have emerged into the\r\nconcrete if the Cork election had not opened up the prospect of a fair\r\nand sympathetic national hearing for a project of self-government, now\r\nadvocated for the first time by a body of Unionist Irishmen. Mr\r\nRedmond's fervid message from America also was as plain a welcome to the\r\nnew movement for genuine national unity as words could express. But \"the\r\nfly was in the ointment nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n               THE MOVEMENT FOR DEVOLUTION AND ITS DEFEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vital declaration of the objects of the Irish Reform Association\r\nwas contained in the following passage:--\r\n\r\n\"While firmly maintaining that the Parliamentary Union between Great\r\nBritain and Ireland is essential to the political stability of the\r\nEmpire and to the prosperity of the two islands, we believe that such\r\na Union is compatible with the devolution to Ireland of a larger\r\nmeasure of self-government than she now possesses. We consider that\r\nthis devolution, while avoiding matters of Imperial concern and\r\nsubjects of common interest to the kingdom as a whole, would be\r\nbeneficial to Ireland and would relieve the Imperial Parliament of a\r\nmass of business with which it cannot now deal satisfactorily. In\r\nparticular we consider the present system of financial administration\r\nto be wasteful and inappropriate to the needs of the country.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the manifesto proceeded to enumerate various questions of\r\nnational reform \"for whose solution we earnestly invite the\r\nco-operation of all Irishmen who have the highest interests of their\r\ncountry at heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe enemies of Home Rule had no misconceptions either as to the purpose,\r\nscope or object of the Reform Association. They saw at once how\r\nabsolutely it menaced their position--how completely it embodied in\r\nsubstance the main principle of the constitutional movement since the\r\ndays of Parnell--namely, the control of purely Irish affairs by an Irish\r\nassembly subject to the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament. From\r\ndebates which followed in the House of Lords (17th February 1905) it\r\nbecame clear that the new movement had no sinister origin--that it was\r\nhonestly conceived and honestly intended for Ireland's national\r\nadvantage. But the Irish, whether of North or South, are a people to\r\nwhom suspiciousness in politics is a sort of second nature. It is the\r\ninheritance of centuries of betrayals, treacheries and\r\nduplicities--broken treaties, crude diplomacies and shattered faiths.\r\nAnd thus we had a Unionist Attorney-General (now Lord Atkinson) asking\r\n\"whether the Devolution scheme is not the price secretly arranged to be\r\npaid for Nationalist acquiescence in the settlement of the Land Question\r\non gracious terms\"; and _The Times_ declaring (1st September 1904):\r\n\"What the Dunraven Devolution policy amounts to is nothing more nor less\r\nthan the revival in a slightly weakened and thinly disguised form of Mr\r\nGladstone's fatal enterprise of 1886\"; whilst on the other hand those\r\nIrish Nationalists who followed Mr Dillon's lead attacked the new\r\nmovement with a ferocity that was as stupid as it was criminal. For at\r\nleast it did not require any unusual degree of political intelligence to\r\npostulate that if _The Times_, Sir Edward Carson, _The Northern Whig_\r\nand other Unionist and Orange bravoes and journals were denouncing the\r\nDevolution proposals as \"worse than Home Rule,\" Irish Nationalists\r\nshould have long hesitated before they joined them in their campaign of\r\ndestruction and became the abject tools of their insensate hate. Sir\r\nEdward Carson wrote that, much as he detested the former proposals of\r\nHome Rule, he preferred them to \"the insidious scheme put forward by the\r\nso-called Reform Association.\" So incorrigibly foolish were the attacks\r\nof Mr Dillon and his friends on the Reform Association that Lord\r\nRathmore was able to say in the House of Lords: \"Not only did the\r\nUnionist Party in Ireland denounce the Dunraven scheme as worse than the\r\nHome Rule of Mr Gladstone, but their language was mild in comparison to\r\nthe language of contempt which a great many of the Irish Nationalist\r\npatriots showered upon the proposals of the noble earl.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the mournful tragedy of all this period that a certain section\r\nof Nationalist opinion should have seen in every advance towards a\r\npolicy of conciliation, good will and understanding between brother\r\nIrishmen, some deep and sinister conspiracy against the National\r\nCause, and in this unaccountable belief should have allowed themselves\r\nto become the dupes and to play the game of the bitterest enemies of\r\nIrish freedom. But so it was, to the bitter sorrow of Ireland; and\r\nmany a blood-stained chapter has been written because of it. Whether a\r\nfatal blindness or an insatiate personal rancour dictated this\r\nincomprehensible policy Providence alone knows, but oceans of woe, and\r\nmisery and malediction have flowed from it as surely as that the sun\r\nis in the heavens.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr O'Brien's retirement, as I have already remarked, the country\r\nwas left without a policy or active national guidance. The leaders of\r\nthe revolt against the authorised policy of the nation went abroad\r\n\"for the benefit of their health.\" (What a lot of humbug this\r\nparticular phrase covers in political affairs only the initiated are\r\naware of!) No sooner was the Cork election announced than Mr Dillon\r\nreturned from his holiday, ready \"to take the field\" against the Irish\r\nReform Association and anyone who dared to show it toleration or\r\nregard. He declared in a speech at Sligo that its one object was \"to\r\nbreak national unity in Ireland and to block the advance of the\r\nNationalist Cause,\" and he went on to deliver this definite threat:\r\n\"Now I say that any attempt such as was made the other day in the city\r\nof Cork to force on the branches of the national organisation, or on\r\nthe National Directory itself, any vote of confidence in Lord Dunraven\r\nor any declaration of satisfaction at the foundation of this\r\nAssociation would tear the ranks of the Nationalists of Ireland to\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\nNote Mr Dillon's extreme zeal for national unity--the man who, less\r\nthan twelve months before, had set himself at the head of \"a\r\ndetermined campaign to defy the decisions of the Irish Party, the\r\nNational Directory and the United Irish League,\" and who did not in\r\nthe least scruple whether or not he \"would tear the ranks of the\r\nNationalists of Ireland to pieces\" in the gratification of his\r\npurpose! The \"attempt made in the city of Cork\" which called forth Mr\r\nDillon's thunders was a resolution of the Cork branch of the United\r\nIrish League which hailed with sympathy the establishment of the Irish\r\nReform Association as proof of the continuance of the spirit of\r\nconciliation \"among those classes of our countrymen who have hitherto\r\nheld aloof from us\"--a spirit which had already led to such happy\r\nresults in the abolition of landlordism \"by common consent,\" and which\r\nwas capable of \"still wider and more blessed results in the direction\r\nof a National Parliament of our own.\" The resolution also expressed\r\ngratification \"at the statesmanlike spirit in which Mr Redmond has\r\ngreeted the establishment of the new Association.\" It will be observed\r\nthat there was here a clear line of demarcation. Mr O'Brien and his\r\nfriends wanted, in moderate and guarded language, without in any way\r\nbinding themselves \"to the particular views set forth in the programme\r\nof the Irish Reform Association,\" to give a message of encouragement\r\nto a body of Irish Unionists, who, as Sir Edward Carson, _The\r\nTimes_ and every other enemy of Home Rule declared, had become\r\nconverts to the National demand for self-government and who looked\r\nlikely to bring the bulk of the Protestant minority in Ireland with\r\nthem. Mr Dillon and those who thought with him savagely repelled this\r\nmovement towards a national unity which would embrace all classes and\r\ncreeds to the forgetfulness of past wrongs, animosities and deep\r\ndivisions. It seemed to have got into their minds that the appearance\r\nof the Irish Reform Association covered some occult plot between Lord\r\nDunraven, Mr Wyndham, Sir Antony MacDonnell and Mr O'Brien. Mr Davitt\r\ndeclared that \"No party or leader can consent to accept the Dunraven\r\nsubstitute without betraying a national trust.\" Others of lesser note\r\ndenounced the new movement and its authors with every circumstance of\r\ninsult and used language of a coarseness that deserves the severest\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\nMr Joseph Devlin, who had succeeded Mr John O'Donnell as Secretary of\r\nthe United Irish League, now began to be a rather considerable figure\r\nin Irish politics on the Dillonite side. He told his constituents in\r\nNorth Kilkenny that they were not going to seek \"the co-operation of a\r\nfew aristocratic nobodies,\" and he, quite unjustly, as I conceive,\r\nattributed to Lord Dunraven and his friends a desire to weaken the\r\nnational demand.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the Government had given no sign that the Devolution\r\nmovement might not find favour in their sight. Had its main objects\r\nmet with a more cordial reception from the arbiters of the national\r\npolicy it is more than probable that the Unionist Government would\r\nhave stood sponsor for a large and generous instalment of\r\nself-government which would have received the joyous assent of the\r\nLiberal Party and passed through both Houses of Parliament with the\r\nacclamations of everybody. In his first speech at Cork after his\r\nelection Mr O'Brien sought to rouse the country to a real perception\r\nof the momentous issues that were at stake. He pointed out that the\r\nproposals of the Reform Association were only \"mere preliminary\r\nmaterials for discussion and negotiation and that they are rather\r\naddressed towards the removal of the prejudices of Unionists than put\r\nforward as a final and unalterable answer to our national demand.\" And\r\nthen he went on to say: \"Lord Dunraven and his friends may be all that\r\nis diabolical, but at least they are not such born idiots as to expect\r\nus to surrender our own organisation, or, as it has been absurdly put,\r\nto coalesce with the new Association on such a programme.\" As a matter\r\nof fact, Lord Dunraven had, in the most outspoken manner, stated that\r\nhe expected nothing from the Nationalists except friendly toleration\r\nand fair play, whilst he and those associated with him were engaged in\r\nthe hard task of conquering the mass of racial prejudice and sectarian\r\nbigotry that had been for so long arrayed against the National claim.\r\n\r\nThe efforts to induce in the intransigeant section of the Party a\r\nspirit of sweet reasonableness were, however, foredoomed to failure.\r\nMr Dillon declined to address a meeting at Limerick, specially\r\nsummoned to establish a concordat between the Irish leaders. Mr\r\nRedmond and Mr O'Brien accepted the invitation, and the former made it\r\nclear that he still regarded the Land Conference policy as the policy\r\nof the nation. He said: \"It has been stated in some newspapers of our\r\nenemies that the Land Conference agreement, which was endorsed by the\r\nIrish Party, endorsed by the Directory of the League and endorsed by\r\nthe National Convention and accepted by the people, has been in some\r\nway repudiated recently by us. I deny that altogether.... I speak\r\nto-day only for the people and, so far as the people are concerned, I\r\nsay that the agreement, from the day it was entered upon down to this\r\nmoment, has never been repudiated by anybody entitled to speak in\r\ntheir name.\"\r\n\r\nHad the spirit of the Limerick meeting and the unity which it\r\nsymbolised been allowed to prevail, all might yet have been well and\r\nthe national platform might have been broadened out so that all men of\r\ngood will who wished to labour for an independent and self-governed\r\nIreland could stand upon it. But such a consummation was not to be.\r\nThere was no arguing away the hostility of Mr Dillon, _The Freeman's\r\nJournal_ and those others upon whom they imposed their will. Mr\r\nDillon could give no better proof of statesmanship or generous\r\nsentiment than to refer to \"Dunraven and his crowd\" and to declare\r\nthat \"Conciliation, so far as the landlords are concerned, was another\r\nname for swindling.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the moment Mr Wyndham had placed his Purchase Act on the Statute\r\nBook, with the assent of all parties in England and Ireland, his hopes\r\nwere undoubtedly set on the larger and nobler ambition of linking his\r\nname with the grant of a generous measure of self-government. The\r\nblood of a great Irish patriot, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, coursed\r\nthrough his veins, and it is not impossible that it influenced his\r\nIrish outlook and stimulated his purpose to write his name largely on\r\nIrish affairs. And at this time nothing was beyond his capacity or\r\npower. He was easily the most notable figure in the Cabinet, by reason\r\nof the towering success that had attended his effort to remove from\r\nthe arena of perennial contention a problem that had daunted and\r\ndefeated so many previous attempts at solution. In all quarters the\r\nmost glorious future was prophesied for him. His star shone most\r\nbrightly in the political firmament--and there were many in high\r\nplaces who were quite willing to hitch their wagon to it. He was\r\nimmensely popular in the House and he had captured the public\r\nimagination by his many gifts and graces of intellect and character.\r\nHe had an exquisite personality, a wonderful charm of manner, a most\r\nhandsome and distinguished presence and was a perfect courtier in an\r\nage which knew his kind not at all. His like was not in Parliament,\r\nnor, indeed, can I conceive his like to be elsewhere in these rougher\r\ndays, when the ancient courtesies seem to have vanished from our\r\npublic life. There can be no doubt about it that in his first\r\ntentative approaches towards Home Rule Mr Wyndham received\r\nencouragement from leading members of the Cabinet, including Lord\r\nLansdowne and Mr Balfour. Sir Antony MacDonnell had been the welcome\r\nguest of Lord Lansdowne at his summer seat in Ireland, and the latter\r\nmade no secret of the fact that their conversation turned upon the\r\nlarger question of Irish self-government. When Lord Dunraven was\r\nattacked in the House of Lords for his Devolution plans Lord Lansdowne\r\n\"declined to follow Lord Rathmore in the trenchant vituperation Lord\r\nDunraven's scheme had encountered,\" and he admitted that Sir Antony\r\nMacDonnell had been in the habit of conferring with Lord Dunraven on\r\nmany occasions, with the full knowledge and approval of the Chief\r\nSecretary, and had collaborated with him \"in working out proposals for\r\nan improved scheme of local government for Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Dudley, made open avowal\r\nof his sympathies and stated repeatedly that it was his earnest wish\r\nto see Ireland governed in accordance with Irish ideas.\r\n\r\nIt was in this friendly atmosphere that the Irish Reform Association\r\npropounded its scheme of Devolution which Mr T.P. O'Connor (before he\r\ncame under the influence of Mr Dillon) happily described as \"the Latin\r\nfor Home Rule,\" and which Mr Redmond welcomed in the glowing terms\r\nalready quoted. The Convention of the United Irish League of America,\r\nrepresenting the best Irish elements in the United States, also\r\nproclaimed the landlord concession as embodied in the Irish Reform\r\nAssociation to be \"a victory unparalleled in the whole history of\r\nmoral warfare.\" Here was an opportunity such as Wolfe Tone, Robert\r\nEmmet, Thomas Davis and the other honoured patriots of Ireland's love\r\nsighed for in vain, when, with the display of a generous and forgiving\r\nspirit on all sides, the best men of every creed and class could have\r\nbeen gathered together in support of an invincible demand for the\r\nrestoration of Irish liberty. I do not know how any intelligent and\r\nimpartial student of the events of that historical cycle can fail to\r\nvisit the blame for the miscarriage of a great occasion, and the\r\ndefeat of the definite movement towards the widest national union upon\r\nMr Dillon and those who joined him in his \"determined\" and tragically\r\nfoolish campaign. As a humble participator in the activities of the\r\nperiod, I dare say it is not quite possible for me to divest myself of\r\na certain bias, but I cannot help saying that I am confirmed in the\r\nopinion that in addition to being the most melancholy figure in his\r\ngeneration Mr John Dillon was also the most malignant in that at every\r\nstage of his career, when decisive action had to be taken his judgment\r\ninvariably led him to take the course which brought most misfortune\r\nupon his country and upon the hopes of its people.\r\n\r\nAttacked on front and flank, assailed by Sir Edward Carson and his\r\ngang and denounced by Mr Dillon and his faithful henchmen, deserted by\r\nMr Balfour at the moment when his support was vital, Mr Wyndham weakly\r\nallowed himself to be badgered into disowning Home Rule, thus sealing\r\nhis doom as a statesman and as potential leader of his own party. The\r\nsecret history of this time when it is made public will disclose a\r\npitiful story of base intrigue and baser desertion and of a great and\r\nchivalrous spirit stretched on the rack of Ireland's ill-starred\r\ndestiny. I do not think it is any exaggeration of the facts to say\r\nthat Wyndham was done to death, physically as well as politically, in\r\nthose evil days. Driven from office, with the ruin of all his high\r\nhopes in shattered disorder around him, his proud soul was never able\r\nto recover itself, and he drifted out of politics and into the greater\r\nvoid without--so fine a gentleman in such utter disarray that the\r\nangels must have wept his fall.\r\n\r\nThat Mr William O'Brien did not meet a similar fate was due only to\r\nthe fact that he was made of sterner fighting stuff--that he possessed\r\na more intrepid spirit and a more indomitable will. But the base\r\nweapons of calumny and of viler innuendo were employed to injure him\r\nin the eyes of his fellow-countrymen, to whom he had devoted, in a\r\nmanner never surely equalled or surpassed before, a life of service\r\nand sacrifice. _The Freeman's Journal_, whilst suppressing Mr\r\nO'Brien's speeches and arguments, threw its columns open to ruffianly\r\nattacks which no paper knowing his record should have published. In\r\none of these he was charged with \"unnatural services to insatiable\r\nlandlordism.\" He was charged by Mr Dillon and the _Freeman_ with\r\nbeing actively engaged with Mr Wyndham, Sir Antony MacDonnell and Lord\r\nDunraven in a plot to break up the Irish Party, and to construct a new\r\nModerate Centre Party by selling eighteen Nationalist seats in\r\nParliament to Lord Dunraven and his friends, and he was further\r\ncharged with being concerned in a conspiracy having for its object the\r\ndenationalisation of the _Freeman_. There were six libels in all,\r\nof so gross a character that Mr O'Brien, since reports of his speeches\r\nwere systematically suppressed in every newspaper outside of Munster,\r\nwas obliged to take his libellers into court and, before a jury of\r\ntheir fellow-countrymen at Limerick, to convict them of uttering six\r\nfalse, malicious and defamatory libels, and thus bring to the public\r\nknowledge the guilt of his accusers. Asked what his \"unnatural\r\nservices to insatiable landlordism\" were, Mr O'Brien made this\r\nmemorable reply: \"To abolish it! All the Irish tenants had gained by\r\nthe land agitation of the previous twenty years was a reduction of\r\ntwenty per cent. My unnatural services under the Land Conference\r\nAgreement was to give them a reduction of _forty per cent._ more\r\nright away and the ownership of the soil of Ireland thrown in.\"\r\n\r\nLord Dunraven on his own part took Mr Dillon publicly to task for his\r\nmisrepresentations of him. He said that Mr Dillon \"mentioned him as\r\nbeing more or less connected with a great variety of conspiracies and\r\nplots and with general clandestine arrangements.... He and George\r\nWyndham were said to have been constantly plotting for the purpose of\r\ndriving a wedge into the midst of the Nationalist Party. Well, as far\r\nas he was concerned, all these deals and all these conspiracies\r\nexisted only in Mr Dillon's fervid imagination.\" And Lord Dunraven\r\nwent on to express his sorrow that a man in Mr Dillon's position\r\nshould have taken up so unworthy a line.\r\n\r\nMr Dillon, when he had the opportunity of appearing before the\r\nLimerick jury, to justify himself, if he could, never did so. And he\r\nnever expressed regret for having defamed his former friend and\r\ncolleague and for having vilified honourable men, honourably seeking\r\nIreland's welfare. Upon which I must content myself with saying that\r\nhistory will pass its own verdict on Mr Dillon's conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                 THE LATER IRISH PARTY--ITS CHARACTER AND\r\n                               COMPOSITION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo enable our readers to have a clearer understanding of all that has\r\ngone before and all that is to follow, I think it well at this stage\r\nto give a just impression of the Party, of its personnel, its method\r\nof working and its general character and composition.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Party, as we know it, was originally the creation of\r\nParnell, and was, perhaps, his most signal achievement. It became,\r\nunder the genius of his leadership, a mighty constitutional\r\nforce--disciplined, united, efficient and vigilant. It had the merit\r\nof knowing its own mind. It kept aloof from British Party\r\nentanglements. It was pledged to sit, act and vote together, and its\r\nmembers loyally observed the pledge both in the spirit and the letter,\r\nand did not claim the right to place their own individual\r\ninterpretation upon it. Furthermore, it was a cardinal article of\r\nhonour that members of the Party were to seek no favours from British\r\nMinisters, because it needs no argument to demonstrate that the Member\r\nof Parliament who pleads for favours for himself or preferment for his\r\nfriends can possess no individual independence. He is shackled in\r\nslavery to the Minister to whom his importunities are addressed. He is\r\nsimply a patriot on the make, despised by himself and despised by\r\nthose to whom he addresses his subservient appeals. There was no place\r\nfor such a one in Parnell's Irish Party, which embodied as nearly as\r\npossible that perfect political cohesion which is the dream of all\r\ngreat leaders. There were men of varying capacity and, no doubt, of\r\ndiffering thought in Parnell's Party, but where Ireland's national\r\ninterests were concerned it was a united body, an undivided phalanx\r\nwhich faced the foe. And by the very boldness and directness of\r\nParnell's policy, he won to his side in the country, not only all the\r\nmoral and constitutional forces making for Nationalism, but the\r\nrevolutionary forces--who yearned for an Irish Republic--as well. He\r\nwas, therefore, not only the leader of a Party; he was much more--he\r\nwas the leader of a United Irish nation. His aim was eminently sane\r\nand practical--to obtain the largest possible measure of national\r\nautonomy, and he did not care very much what it was called. But he\r\nmade it clear that whatever he might accept in his time and generation\r\nwas not to be the last word on the Irish Question. He fought with the\r\nweapons that came to his hand--and he used them with incomparable\r\nskill and judgment--with popular agitation in Ireland, with \"direct\r\naction\" of a most forcible and audacious kind in Parliament. A great\r\nleader has always the capacity for attracting capable lieutenants to\r\nhis side. We need only refer to the example of Napoleon as\r\noverwhelming proof of this. And so out of what would ordinarily seem\r\nhumble and unpromising material Parnell brought to his banner a band\r\nof young colleagues who have since imperishably fixed their place in\r\nIrish history. I am not writing the life-story of the members of\r\nParnell's Party, but if I were it would be easy to show that most of\r\nthe colleagues who have come to any measure of greatness since were\r\nmen of no antecedent notoriety (I use the word in its better\r\napplication), with possibly one exception, and it is somewhat\r\nremarkable that the son of John Blake Dillon, who owed perhaps not a\r\nlittle to the fact that he was his father's son, should have been the\r\none who first showed signs of recalcitrancy against Party rule and\r\ndiscipline when he inveighed against the Land Act of 1881 and betook\r\nhimself abroad for three years during the time when the national\r\nmovement was locked in bitterest conflict with the Spencer Coercionist\r\nregime. Let it be at once conceded that Parnell's lieutenants were men\r\nwhose gifts and talents would have in any circumstances carried them\r\nto eminent heights, but it might be said also they lost nothing from\r\ntheir early association with so great a personality and from the fact\r\nthat he brought them into the gladiatorial arena, where their mental\r\nmuscles were, so to speak, trained and tested and extended in combat\r\nwith some of the finest minds of the age.\r\n\r\nIn the days when the later Irish Party had entered upon its\r\ndecrepitude some of its leaders sought to maintain a sorry unity by\r\nshouting incessantly from the house-tops, as if it were some sacred\r\nformula which none but the unholy or those predestined to political\r\ndamnation dare dispute: \"Majority Rule.\" And a country which they had\r\nreduced to the somnambulistic state by the constant reiteration of\r\nthis phrase unfortunately submitted to their quackery, and have had\r\ngrave reason to regret it ever since. Parnell had very little respect\r\nfor shams--whether they were sham phrases or sham politicians. He was\r\na member of Butt's Home Rule Party but he was not to be intimidated\r\nfrom pursuing the course he had mapped out for himself by any foolish\r\ntaunts about his \"Policy of Exasperation\"; he was a flagrant sinner\r\nagainst the principle of \"majority rule,\" but time has proved him to\r\nbe a sinner who was very much in the right. Mr Dillon used to hurl\r\nanother name of anathema at our heads--the heads of those of us who\r\nwere associated with Mr O'Brien in his policy of national\r\nreconciliation--he used to dub us \"Factionists.\" It was not fair\r\nfighting, nor honest warfare, nor decent politics. It was the base\r\nweapon of a man who had no arguments of reason by which he could\r\noverwhelm an opponent, but who snatched a bludgeon from an armoury of\r\ncertain evil associations which he knew would prevail where more\r\nlegitimate methods could not.\r\n\r\nI entered the Party in May 1901, having defeated their official\r\ncandidate at a United Irish League Convention for the selection of a\r\nParliamentary candidate for Mid-Cork on the death of Dr Tanner. In\r\nthose days I was not much of a politician. My heart was with the\r\nneglected labourer and I stood, accordingly, as a Labour candidate, my\r\nprogramme being the social elevation of the masses, particularly in\r\nthe vital matters of housing, employment and wages. I was not even a\r\nmember of the United Irish League, being wholly concerned in building\r\nup the Irish Land and Labour Association, which was mainly an\r\norganisation for the benefit, protection and the education in social\r\nand citizen duty of the rural workers. Mr Joseph Devlin was sent down\r\nto the Convention to represent the Party and the League. It was sought\r\nto exclude a considerable number of properly accredited Labour\r\ndelegates from the Convention, but after a stiff fight my friends and\r\nmyself compelled the admission of a number just barely sufficient to\r\nsecure me a majority. This was heralded as a tremendous triumph for\r\nthe Labour movement, and it spoke something for the democratic\r\nconstitution of the United Irish League, as drafted by Mr O'Brien,\r\nthat it was possible for an outsider to beat its official nominee and\r\nthereby to become the officially adopted candidate of the League\r\nhimself. In due course I entered the portals of the Irish Party, but\r\nthough in it was, to a certain extent, not of it, in that I was more\r\nan observer of its proceedings than an active participant in its work.\r\nMy supreme purpose in public life was to make existence tolerable for\r\na class who had few to espouse their claims and who were in the\r\ndeepest depths of poverty, distress and neglect. Hence, except where\r\nLabour questions and the general interests of my constituents were\r\nconcerned, I stood more or less aloof from the active labours of the\r\nParty. I was in the position of a looker-on and a critic, and I saw\r\nmany things that did not impress me at all too favourably.\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately following the General Election of 1900 the\r\nParty had a splendid solidarity and a fine enthusiasm. There had been\r\njust sufficient new blood infused into it to counteract the jealous\r\nhumours and to minimise the weariness of spirit of those older members\r\nwho had served in the halcyon days of Parnell and had gone through all\r\nthe squalidness and impotence of the years of the Split. Had the Party\r\nbeen rightly handled, and led by a man of strong will and inflexible\r\ncharacter, it could have been made the mightiest constitutional power\r\nfor Ireland's emancipation. Unfortunately Mr John Redmond was not a\r\nstrong leader. He unquestionably possessed many of the attributes of\r\nleadership--a dignified presence, distinguished deportment, a wide\r\nknowledge of affairs, a magnificent mastery of the forms and rules of\r\nthe House of Commons, a noble eloquence and a sincere manner, but he\r\nlacked the vital quality of strength of character and energetic\r\nresolve. He was not, as Parnell was, strong enough to impose his will\r\non others if he found it easier to give way himself. And thus from the\r\nvery outset of his career as leader of the reunited Party he allowed\r\nhis conduct to be influenced by others--very often, let it be said,\r\nagainst his own better judgment. Mr Redmond had a matchless faculty\r\nfor stating the case of Ireland in sonorous sentences, but too often\r\nhe was content to take his marching orders from those powers behind\r\nthe throne who were the real manipulators of what passed for an Irish\r\npolicy. In the shaping of this policy and in the general ordering of\r\naffairs, the rank and file of the members had very little say--they\r\nwere hopelessly invertebrate and pusillanimous. The majority of them\r\nwere mere automatons--very honest, very patriotic, exceedingly\r\nrespectable, good, ordinary, decent and fairly intelligent Irishmen,\r\nbut as Parliamentarians their only utility consisted in their capacity\r\nto find their way into the voting Lobby as they were ordered. To their\r\nmeek submission, and to their rather selfish fear of losing their\r\nseats if they asserted an independent opinion, I trace many if not all\r\nof the catastrophes and failures that overtook the Party in later\r\nyears. Needless to say, neither the country nor the other parties in\r\nParliament had the least understanding of the real character and\r\ncomposition of the Nationalist Party. It had always a dozen or more\r\ncapable men who could dress the ranks and hold their own \"on the floor\r\nof the House\" as against the best intellects and debating power of\r\neither British party. Irish readiness and repartee made question time\r\nan overwhelmingly Irish _divertissement_. Our members had a\r\nunique faculty for bringing about spectacular scenes that read very\r\nwell in the newspapers and made the people at home think what fine\r\nfellows they had representing them! All this might be very good\r\nbusiness in its way if it had any special meaning, but I could never\r\nfor the life of me see how taking the Sultanate of Morocco under our\r\nwing could by any stretch of the imagination help forward the cause of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Party, in the ultimate resort, was supposed to be\r\ncontrolled by the United Irish League acting through its branches in\r\nConvention assembled. Inasmuch as the Party derived whatever strength\r\nit possessed in Parliament from the virility and force of the\r\nagitation in Ireland, it was in the fitness of things that the country\r\nshould have the right of ordering the tune. When he founded the United\r\nIrish League Mr O'Brien unquestionably intended that this should be\r\nthe case--that the country should be the master of its own fate and\r\nthat the constituencies should be in the position of exercising a\r\nwholesome check on the conduct of their Parliamentary representatives,\r\nwho, in addition to the pledge to sit, act and vote with the Party,\r\nalso entered into an equally binding undertaking to accept neither\r\nfavour nor office from the Government. As the Party was for the\r\ngreater part made up of poor men or men of moderate means, members\r\nreceived an indemnity from a special fund called \"The Parliamentary\r\nFund,\" which was administered by three trustees. This fund was\r\nspecially collected each year, and in principle, if the subscriptions\r\ncame from Ireland alone, was an excellent method of making members of\r\nthe Party obey the mandate of the people, under the penalty of\r\nforfeiting their allowance. But in practice, most of the subscriptions\r\nwere collected in America, and we had in effect the extraordinary\r\nsituation of Irish representatives being maintained in Parliament by\r\nthe moneys of their American kith and kin. And the situation after\r\n1903 was rendered the more ludicrous by reason of the fact that the\r\nParty could never have dragged along its existence if it had been\r\ndependent upon Irish contributions to its funds. These were largely\r\nwithdrawn because the Party was delinquent in adhering to the policy\r\nof Conciliation. It is a phenomenon worth remarking that the Irish\r\npeople never failed to contribute generously what Parnell had termed\r\n\"the sinews of war\" so long as the members of the Party deserved it of\r\nthem. But when symptoms of demoralisation set in, or when contentions\r\ndistracted their energies, the people cut off the supplies. This would\r\nundoubtedly have been an effective means of control in normal\r\ncircumstances, but when the Party, of its own volition, was able to\r\nsend \"missions\" to America and Australia to collect funds, it was no\r\nlonger dependent on the popular will, as expressed in terms of\r\nmaterial support, and it became the masters of the people instead of\r\ntheir servants.\r\n\r\nNot that I want for one moment unnecessarily to disparage the\r\npersonnel of the Party--it was probably the best that Ireland could\r\nhave got in the circumstances--nor do I seek to diminish its\r\nundoubtedly great services to Ireland in the days of Parnell and\r\nduring the period that it loyally adopted the policy of Conciliation.\r\nBut what I do deplore is that a few men in the Party--not more than\r\nthree or four all told--were able, by getting control of \"the\r\nmachine,\" to destroy the fairest chance that Ireland ever had of\r\ngaining a large measure of self-government. Knowing all that happened\r\nwithin the Party in the years of which I am writing, knowing the\r\nmethods that were employed, rather unscrupulously and with every\r\ncircumstance of pettiness, to bear down any member who showed the\r\nleast disposition to exercise legitimately an independent\r\njudgment--knowing how the paid organisers of the League were at once\r\ndispatched to his constituency to intrigue against him and to work up\r\nlocal enmities, I am not, and never was, surprised at the compelled\r\nsubmission of the body of the members to the decrees of the secret\r\nCabinet who controlled policy and directed affairs with an absolute\r\nautocracy that few dared question. One member more courageous than his\r\nfellows, Mr Thomas O'Donnell, B.L., did come upon the platform with Mr\r\nWm. O'Brien at Tralee, in his own constituency and had the manliness\r\nto declare in favour of the policy of Conciliation, but the tragic\r\nconfession was wrung from him: \"I know I shall suffer for it.\" And he\r\ndid!\r\n\r\nI mention these matters to explain what would otherwise be\r\ninexplicable--how it came to pass that a policy solemnly ratified by\r\nthe Party, by the Directory of the League, and by a National\r\nConvention was subsequently repudiated. Whilst Mr O'Brien remained in\r\nthe Party there was no question of the allegiance of these men to\r\ncorrect principle. Mr Joseph Devlin, who later was far and away the\r\nmost powerful man in the Party, had not yet \"arrived.\" (It was the\r\nretirement of Mr O'Brien from public life and the resignation of Mr\r\nJohn O'Donnell from the secretaryship of the United Irish\r\nLeague--under circumstances which Mr Devlin's admirers will scarcely\r\ncare to recall--which gave him his chance.) Mr Dillon was a more or\r\nless negligible figure until Mr O'Brien made way for him by his\r\nretirement. Right up to this there was only one man for the Party and\r\nthe country, and that man was William O'Brien. Let me say at once that\r\nin those days I had no attachments and no personal predilections. John\r\nRedmond, William O'Brien and John Dillon were all, as we say in\r\nIreland, \"one and the same to me.\" If anything, because of my\r\nParnellite proclivities, I rather leaned to Mr Redmond's side, and his\r\nchairmanship of the Party had certainly my most loyal adherence.\r\nOtherwise I was positively indifferent to personalities, and to a\r\ngreat extent also to policies, since I was in the Party for one\r\npurpose, and one alone, of pushing the labourers' claims upon the\r\nnotice of the leaders and of ventilating their grievances in the House\r\nof Commons whenever occasion offered. Furthermore, I do not think I\r\never spoke to Mr O'Brien until after the Cork election in 1904, when,\r\nconvinced of the rectitude of his policy and principles, I stood upon\r\nhis platform to give such humble support as I could to the cause he\r\nadvocated, and thereafter, I am proud to say, never once turned aside,\r\neither in thought or action, from the thorny and difficult path I had\r\nchosen to travel. I take no credit to myself for having taken my stand\r\non behalf of Mr O'Brien's policy. I knew him in all essential things,\r\nboth then and thereafter, to be absolutely in the right. I was aware\r\nthat, had he so minded, in 1903, when he was easily the most powerful\r\nman in the Party and the most popular in Ireland, he could have\r\nsmashed at one onslaught the conspiracy of \"the determined\r\ncampaigners\" and driven its authors to a well-deserved doom. But the\r\nmistake he made then, as mistake I believe it to be, was that he left\r\nthe field to those men, who had no alternative policy of their own to\r\noffer to the country, and who, instead of consolidating the national\r\norganisation for the assertion of Irish right, consolidated it rather\r\nin the interests of their own power and personal position. Thus it\r\nhappened that a movement conceived and intended as the adequate\r\nexpression of the people's will became, in the course of a short\r\ntwelve months, everywhere outside of Munster, a mere machine for\r\nregistering the decrees of Mr Dillon and his co-conspirators.\r\n\r\nI do not think, if Mr T.M. Healy had been a member of the Party then,\r\nthat Mr Dillon would have been able so successfully to entrench\r\nhimself in power as he did. Mr Healy knew Mr Dillon inside out and he\r\nhad little respect for his qualities. He knew him to be vain,\r\nintractable, small-minded and abnormally ambitious of power. Parnell\r\nonce said of him: \"Dillon is as vain as a peacock and as jealous as a\r\nschoolgirl.\" And when he was not included as a member of the Land\r\nConference I am sure it does him no wrong to say that he made up his\r\nmind that somebody should suffer for the affront put upon him. It is\r\never thus. Even the greatest men are human, with human emotions,\r\nfeelings, likes and dislikes. And though it is far from my intention\r\nto robe Mr Dillon in any garment of greatness, he was, unfortunately,\r\nput in a position to do irreparable mischief to great principles, as I\r\nconceive, through motives of petty spite. Even if Mr Dillon had stood\r\nalone I do not think he would have counted for very much, supported\r\nthough he was by the suave personality of Mr T.P. O'Connor. But he had\r\nwon to his side, in the person of Mr Devlin, one of great organising\r\ngifts and considerable eloquence, who had now obtained control of the\r\nUnited Irish League and all its machinery and who knew how to\r\nmanipulate it as no other living person could. Without Mr Devlin's\r\nuncanny genius for organisation Mr Dillon's idiosyncrasies could have\r\nbeen easily combated. Mr Dillon's diatribes against \"the black-blooded\r\nCromwellians\" at a time when the best of the landlord class were\r\nsteadily veering in the Nationalist direction, I could never\r\nunderstand. Mr Devlin's detestation of the implacable spirit of Ulster\r\nOrangemen was a far more comprehensible feeling, but the years have\r\nshown only too thoroughly that both passions, and the pursuit of them,\r\nhave had the most disastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nEven when Mr Dillon was most powerful in the Party there were many men\r\nin it, to my knowledge, who secretly sympathised with the policy of\r\nConciliation but who had not sufficient moral courage to come out in\r\nthe open in support of it, knowing that if they did they would be\r\nmarked down for destruction at the next General Election. It is\r\nevident that from a Party thus dominated and dragooned, and an\r\norganisation which had its resolutions manufactured for it in the\r\nLeague offices in Dublin, no good fruit could come.\r\n\r\nMr Redmond's position was pitiful in the extreme. Neither his judgment\r\nnor his sense of statesmanship could approve the departure which Mr\r\nDillon and his accomplices had initiated. He avowed again and again,\r\npublicly to the country and privately in the Party, that he was in\r\nentire agreement with Mr O'Brien up to the date of his resignation;\r\nand it is as morally certain as anything can be in this world that if\r\nhe had not crippled his initiative by sanctioning, under his own hand,\r\nthe announcement of the 24-1/2 years' purchase terms for his estate,\r\nhe would never have allowed himself to be associated with what he\r\nrather wearily and shamefacedly described as \"a short-sighted and\r\nunwise policy.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the time that Mr Dillon and his friends got control of the Party\r\nand the national organisation the country was never allowed to\r\nexercise an independent judgment of its own, for the simple reason\r\nthat the facts were carefully kept from its knowledge by a Press\r\nboycott unparalleled in the history of any other nation. Under this\r\ntyranny all independence and honest conviction were sapped. And with a\r\nbrutal irony, which must compel a certain amazed admiration on the\r\npart of the disinterested inquirer after truth, the men who set the\r\nParty pledge at defiance, who set themselves to destroy Party unity\r\nand to scoff at majority rule, were the men who at a later date, when\r\nit suited their malevolent purpose, used the catch-cries of \"Unity,\"\r\n\"Majority Rule\" and \"Factionists\" with all their evil memories of the\r\nnine years of the Split to intimidate the people from listening to the\r\narguments and reasonings of Mr O'Brien and his friends. And when their\r\nkept Press and their subservient Parliamentarians did not prevail,\r\nthey did not hesitate to use hired revolver gangs and to employ paid\r\nemissaries to prevent the gospel of Conciliation from being preached\r\nto the people.\r\n\r\nWith the entrance of false principles and the employment of pernicious\r\nand demoralising influences the _moral_ of the Party began to be\r\nat first vitiated and then utterly destroyed. It lost its independent\r\ncharacter and cohesive force. To a certain extent it became a party of\r\npetty tale-bearers. The men most in favour with the secret Cabinet\r\nwere the men who kept them informed of the sayings and doings of their\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nThe members of lesser note simply dare not be seen speaking to anyone\r\nsuspected of a friendly feeling to Mr O'Brien or his policy. Woe to\r\nthem if they were! In the expressive phrase of Mr O'Donnell, they were\r\n\"made to suffer for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe proud independence and incorruptibility which the Party boasted in\r\nParnell's day of power now also began to give way. With the accession\r\nof the Liberal Party to office in 1906 the Nationalist members began\r\nto beseech favours. It may be it was only in the first instance that\r\nthey sought J.P.-ships for their leading friends and supporters in\r\ntheir several constituencies. But we all know how the temptation of\r\npatronage grows: it is so fine a thing to be able to do \"a good turn\"\r\nfor one's friend or neighbour by merely inditing a letter to some\r\ncondescending Minister. And now, particularly since there was no\r\ncensure to be dreaded, it became one of the ordinary functions of the\r\nNationalist M.P.'s life. It was no secret that prominent leaders were\r\nexercising a similar privilege, and the rank and file saw no reason\r\nwhy they should not imitate so seductive an example.\r\n\r\nI once heard a keen student of personalities in Parliament observe\r\nthat Mr Dillon and Mr T.P. O'Connor always appeared to him to be\r\nsounder and more sincere Liberals than they were Irish Nationalists. I\r\nagree, and no doubt much of Ireland's later misfortunes sprang from\r\nthis circumstance. I confess I have always thought of Mr Dillon, in my\r\nown mind, as an English Radical first and an Irish Nationalist\r\nafterwards. I believe he was temperamentally incapable of adopting\r\nParnell's position of independence of either British Party and of\r\nsupporting only that Party which undertook to do most for Ireland.\r\nThen, again, Mr Dillon was more of an Internationalist than a\r\nNationalist. He delighted in mixing himself up in foreign affairs, and\r\nI am much mistaken if he did not take more pride in being regarded as\r\nan authority on the Egyptian rather than on the Irish question. Mr\r\nT.P. O'Connor was so long out of Ireland, and had so completely lost\r\ntouch with genuine Irish opinion that much might be forgiven to him.\r\nHis ties with Liberalism were the outgrowth of years spent in\r\nconnection with the Liberal Press of London and of social associations\r\nwhich had their natural and inevitable influence on his political\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nWith Messrs Dillon and O'Connor and--at this time, probably, in a more\r\nsecondary sense--Mr Devlin, in control of the Party, it can be well\r\nunderstood how easy was the descent from an independence of all\r\nparties to an alliance with one. I believe that in all these things Mr\r\nRedmond's judgment was overborne by his more resolute colleagues. I\r\nbelieve also, as I have already said, that the weakness of his\r\nposition was engendered by the unforgettable mistake he made in regard\r\nto the sale of his estate--that he felt this was held over him as a\r\nsword of Damocles, and that he was never able to get away from its\r\nhaunting shadow sufficiently to assert his own authority in the manner\r\nof an independent and resolute leader.\r\n\r\nI am at pains to set forth these matters to justify the living and, in\r\nsome measure, to absolve the dead. I want to place the responsibility\r\nfor grievous failures and criminal blunders on the right shoulders. I\r\nseek to make it plain how the country was bamboozled and betrayed by\r\nParty machinations such as have not had their parallel in any other\r\nperiod of Irish history. I state nothing in malice or for any ulterior\r\nmotive, since I have none. But I think it just and right that the\r\nchief events of the past twenty years should be set forth in their\r\ntrue character so that impartial inquirers may know to what causes can\r\nbe traced the overwhelming tragedies of recent times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                  A TALE OF BAD LEADERSHIP AND BAD FAITH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt became a habit of the Irish Party, in its more decadent days, to\r\nspout out long litanies of its achievements and to claim credit, as a\r\nsort of hereditament no doubt, for the reforms won under the\r\nleadership of Parnell. It was, when one comes to analyse it, a sorry\r\nmethod of appealing for public confidence--a sort of apology for\r\npresent failures on the score of past successes. It was as if they\r\nsaid: \"We may not be doing very well now, but think of what we did and\r\ntrust us.\" And the time actually arrived when \"Trust us\" was the\r\nleading watchword of Mr Redmond and his Party. How little they\r\ndeserved that trust in regard to some important concerns I will\r\nproceed to explain. I have shown how they dished Devolution and drove\r\nMr Wyndham from office when he was feeling his way towards the\r\nconcession of Home Rule--or equivalent proposals under another name;\r\nand how they thus destroyed in their generation the last hope of a\r\nsettlement by Consent of the Irish Question--although a settlement\r\nalong these lines was what Gladstone most desired. Writing to Mr\r\nBalfour, so long ago as 20th December 1885, he thus expressed himself:\r\n\r\n\"On reflection I think what I said to you in our conversation at Eaton\r\nmay have amounted to the conveyance of a hope that the Government\r\nwould take a strong and early decision on the Irish Question. This\r\nbeing so, I wish, under the very peculiar circumstances of the case,\r\nto go a step further and say that I think it will be a public calamity\r\nif this great subject should fall into the lines of Party conflict. I\r\nfeel sure that the question can only be dealt with by a Government,\r\nand I desire especially on grounds of public policy that it should be\r\ndealt with by the present Government. If, therefore, they bring in a\r\nproposal after settling the whole question of the future government of\r\nIreland my desire will be, reserving, of course, necessary freedom, to\r\ntreat it in the same spirit in which I have endeavoured to proceed in\r\nrespect to Afghanistan and with respect to the Balkan Peninsula.\"\r\n\r\nTo this statesmanlike offer Mr Balfour immediately replied:\r\n\r\n\"I have had as yet no opportunity of showing your letter to Lord\r\nSalisbury or of consulting him as to its contents, but I am sure he\r\nwill receive without any surprise the statement of your earnest hope\r\nthat the Irish Question should not fall into the lines of Party\r\nconflict. If the ingenuity of any Ministry is sufficient to devise\r\nsome adequate and lasting remedy for the chronic ills of Ireland, I am\r\ncertain it will be the wish of the leaders of the Opposition, to\r\nwhatever side they may belong, to treat the question as a national and\r\nnot as a Party one.\"\r\n\r\nAnd not less clear or emphatic were the views of Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, spoken on 23rd December 1885, as to the\r\nfeasibility of settling the Irish problem by Consent:\r\n\r\n\"On one point I may state my views with tolerable clearness. In my\r\nopinion the best plan of dealing with the Irish Question would be for\r\nthe leaders of the two great parties to confer together for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining whether some _modus vivendi_ could not be\r\narrived at by which the matter would be raised out of the area of\r\nparty strife.\"\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that at a very early stage indeed of the\r\ndiscussions on Home Rule, distinguished statesmen were agreed that the\r\nideal way of settling the Irish Question was by an arrangement or\r\nunderstanding between the two great British parties--otherwise by\r\nthose methods of Conference, Conciliation and Consent which Mr William\r\nO'Brien and Lord Dunraven were so violently and irrationally assailed\r\nby Mr Dillon and his supporters for advocating. The great land pact\r\nwas arranged by those methods of common agreement between all parties\r\nin Parliament--it could never have been reached otherwise. And, as\r\nthese pages will conclusively show, the \"factionism\" of Mr O'Brien and\r\nthose associated with him consisted in pressing a settlement by\r\nConference methods consistently on the notice of the leaders of all\r\nparties. But Mr Wyndham was treated by the Dillonite section as \"a\r\nprisoner in a condemned cell\"--to use their own elegant\r\nmetaphor--because he showed a disposition to secure a settlement of\r\nthe Irish difficulty on a non-party basis. He was ruthlessly exiled\r\nfrom office by methods which confer no credit on their authors, and\r\nthe Unionist Party retired at the close of the year 1905 with nothing\r\naccomplished on the Home Rule issue.\r\n\r\nWhen the Liberals came back to power with an irresistible majority\r\nIreland rang from end to end with glad promises of a great, a glorious\r\nand a golden future. The Liberals had the reins of government in their\r\nhands, and the tears were going to be wiped from the face of dark\r\nRosaleen. Never again was she to know the bitterness of sorrow or that\r\nhope of freedom so long deferred which maketh the heart sick. Mr T.P.\r\nO'Connor wrote to his American news agency that Home Rule was coming\r\nat a \"not far distant date.\" It was a fair hope, but the men who\r\ngambled on it did not take the House of Lords sufficiently into their\r\ncalculations. And they forgot also that Home Rule was not a concrete\r\nand definite issue before the country at the General Election. The\r\nLiberal Party in 1906 had no Home Rule mandate. Its leaders were\r\navowedly in favour of what was known as \"the step-by-step\" programme.\r\nThis policy was less than Lord Dunraven's scheme of Devolution, but\r\nbecause it was the Liberal plan it came in for no stern denunciations\r\nfrom either Mr Dillon or Mr T.P. O'Connor. Even so staunch a Home\r\nRuler as Mr John Morley insisted that Mr Redmond's Home Rule Amendment\r\nto the Address should contain this important addendum: \"subject to the\r\nsupreme authority of the Imperial Parliament.\" The men who shouted in\r\nIreland: \"No compromise,\" who were clamant in their demand that there\"\r\nshould be no hauling down of the flag,\" and who asked the country to\r\ngo \"back to the old methods\" (though they made it clear they were not\r\ngoing to lead them if they did), showed no disinclination to have\r\ntheir own private negotiations with the Liberal leaders on a much\r\nnarrower programme.\r\n\r\nMr T.P. O'Connor, in his _Life of Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman,\r\nM.P._, tells us exactly what happened, in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"The Irish Nationalists had already become restive, for, while not\r\nopenly repudiating Home Rule as an ultimate solution, several of the\r\nfriends and adherents of Lord Rosebery among the leaders of the\r\nLiberal Party had proclaimed that they would not only not support, but\r\nwould resist any attempt to introduce a Home Rule measure in a\r\nParliament that was about to be elected. It was under these\r\ncircumstances that I had an interview of any length with\r\nCampbell-Bannerman for the last time. He invited a friend and me to\r\nbreakfast with him.... This exchange of views was brief, for there was\r\ncomplete agreement as to both policy and tactics.... It was shortly\r\nafter this that he made his historic speech in Stirling. That was the\r\nspeech in which he laid down the policy that while Ireland might not\r\nexpect to get at once a measure of complete Home Rule, any measure\r\nbrought in should be consistent with and leading up to a larger\r\npolicy. Such a declaration was all that the Irish Nationalist Party\r\ncould have expected at that moment and it enabled them to give their\r\nfull support at the elections to the Liberal Party.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a very notable statement, because it shows that the\r\nNationalists, who poured out their vials of vituperation upon Lord\r\nDunraven and the Irish Reform Association, were now eager to accept an\r\ninfinitely lesser instalment of Home Rule from their own Liberal\r\nfriends. And it also demonstrates that for a very meagre modicum of\r\nthe Irish birth-right they were willing to sacrifice the position of\r\nParliamentary independence, which was one of the greatest assets of\r\nthe Party, and to enter into a formal alliance with the Liberals on a\r\nmere contingent declaration that \"any measure brought in\" should be\r\n\"consistent with and leading up to a larger policy.\" Note, there was\r\nno guarantee, no positive statement, that a measure would be brought\r\nin, yet Mr T.P. O'Connor tells us that this declaration was \"all that\r\nthe Irish Nationalist Party could have expected,\" and that it enabled\r\nthem \"to give their full support at the elections to the Liberal\r\nParty.\" I wonder what Parnell, had he been alive, would have thought\r\nof this offer of the Liberals and whether he would in return for it\r\nmake such an easy surrender of a nation's claims. And I wonder also\r\nwhether a paltrier bargain was ever made in the whole history of\r\npolitical alliances. It does not require any special gift of vision to\r\ndivine who was \"the friend\" who went with Mr O'Connor to Sir H.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman's breakfast-party and who was in \"complete\r\nagreement as to both policy and tactics.\" They were good Liberals both\r\nof them, and for my own part I would find no fault with them for this,\r\nif only they had been better Nationalists.\r\n\r\nMr Redmond publicly ratified the new policy--or rather, treaty, as it\r\nnow practically was--of Home Rule by instalments in a speech at\r\nMotherwell, in which he announced his readiness to accept any\r\nconcession \"which would shorten and smoothen the road to Home Rule.\"\r\nBut it is significant that although Mr Dillon was in complete\r\nagreement with the Liberals \"as to both policy and tactics,\" yet he\r\ndevoted, with a rather supercilious levity, his speeches in Ireland to\r\na demand for \"Boer Home Rule as a minimum.\" This was the way in which\r\nthe country was scandalously hoodwinked as to the real relations which\r\nexisted between the Liberals and Nationalists.\r\n\r\nMr O'Brien had at this time gone abroad and left the stage completely\r\nto Mr Dillon and his friends, having, however, made it clear that he\r\nwas in favour of the Council Bill and suggested certain improvements,\r\nwhich the Government agreed to. His temporary withdrawal from the\r\nscene was dictated solely by the desire to give the utmost freedom of\r\naction to the Irish Party, seeing that they were acting in conformity\r\nwith the best national interests in the special circumstances of the\r\nmoment. He was also aware that Mr Birrell, who had now accepted office\r\nas Chief Secretary, was particularly acceptable to the Nationalist\r\nleaders and that they were in constant communication with him on\r\ndetails of the Bill, the safety of which seemed to be assured. Indeed,\r\nwhen it was introduced into Parliament, Mr Redmond spoke in\r\nappreciation of it, reserved in statement, no doubt, as befitting a\r\nleader who had yet to see the measure in print, but there is not a\r\nshadow of doubt that Messrs Redmond, Dillon and O'Connor were\r\npractically pledged to the support of the principle of the Bill before\r\never it was submitted to Parliament.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, they summoned a National Convention to consider the\r\nBill, to which they were committed by every principle of honour which\r\ncould bind self-respecting men, to the amazement of everybody not\r\nbehind the scenes, the very men who had crossed over from Westminster\r\nto recommend the acceptance of the measure were the first to move its\r\nrejection. A more unworthy and degrading performance it is not\r\npossible to imagine. It was an arrant piece of cowardice on the part\r\nof \"the leaders,\" who failed to lead and who shamefully broke faith\r\nwith Mr Birrell and their Liberal allies. True, the Irish Council Bill\r\nwas not a very great or strikingly generous measure. It had serious\r\ndefects, but these might be remedied in Committee, and it had this\r\nmerit, at least, that it did carry out the Liberal promise of being\r\n\"consistent with and leading up to a larger policy.\" Its purpose,\r\nbroadly stated, was to consolidate Irish administration under the\r\ncontrol of an Irish Council, which would be elected on the popular\r\nfranchise. It contained no provision for a Statutory Legislative body.\r\nIt was to confine itself to the purely administrative side of\r\nGovernment. The various Irish administrative departments were to be\r\nregrouped, with a Minister (to be called Chairman) at the head of\r\neach, who would be responsible to the elected representatives of the\r\npeople. The Council was to be provided with the full Imperial costs\r\n(the dearest in the world) of the departments they were to administer,\r\nand they were to receive in addition an additional yearly subsidy of\r\n£600,000 to spend, with any savings they might effect on the\r\nadministrative side on the development of Irish resources. Finally,\r\nthis limited incursion into the field of administrative\r\nself-government was to last only for five years. Appeals to ignorant\r\nprejudice were long made by misquoting the title of the Irish Council\r\nBill as \"The Irish _Councils_ Bill\"--quite falsely, for one of\r\nits main recommendations was that the Bill created _one_ national\r\nassembly for all Ireland, including the Six Counties which the Party\r\nsubsequently ceded to Carson. Do not these proposals justify the\r\ncomment of Mr O'Brien on them?--\"If the experiment had been proved to\r\nwork with the harmony of classes and the broad-mindedness of\r\npatriotism, of which the Land Conference had set the example, the end\r\nof the quinquennial period would have found all Ireland and all\r\nEngland ready with a heart and a half for 'the larger policy.' There\r\nwould even have been advantages which no thoughtful Irish Nationalist\r\nwill ignore, in accustoming our people to habits of self-government by\r\na probationary period of smaller powers and of substantial premiums\r\nupon self-restraint.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in addition to having no legislative functions, Mr\r\nBirrell's Bill contained one other proposal which damned it from the\r\noutset with a very powerful body of Irish thought and influence--it\r\nproposed to transfer the control of education to a Committee\r\npreponderatingly composed of laymen. When dropping the Bill later Sir\r\nH. Campbell-Bannerman declared: \"We took what steps we could to\r\nascertain Irish feelings and we had good reason to believe that the\r\nBill would receive the most favourable reception.\" One would like to\r\nknow how far the leaders of the Irish Party who were taken into the\r\nconfidence of the Government regarding the provisions of the Bill\r\nconcurred in this clause. To anyone acquainted with clerical feeling\r\nin Ireland, whether Catholic or Protestant, it should be known that\r\nsuch a proposal would be utterly inadmissible. But apparently the\r\nGovernment were not warned, although it is a matter of history that\r\nthe Irish Party entertained Mr Birrell to a banquet in London the\r\nnight before they went over to Ireland for the National Convention,\r\nand it is equally well known, on the admissions of Mr Redmond, Mr\r\nO'Connor and others, that they crossed with the express determination\r\nto support the Irish Council Bill and in the full expectation that\r\nthey would carry it.\r\n\r\nBut they had not reckoned on Mr Devlin and on the younger priests, who\r\nhad now begun to assert themselves vigorously in politics. Mr Devlin,\r\nin addition to being Secretary of the United Irish League, had also\r\nobtained a position of dominating control in the Ancient Order of\r\nHibernians (Board of Erin section), a secret and sectarian\r\norganisation of which I will have much to say anon. For some\r\ninscrutable reason Mr Devlin set himself at the head of his delegates\r\nto intrigue with the young and ardent priesthood against the Bill. Mr\r\nRedmond, Mr T.P. O'Connor and their friends got to hear of the tempest\r\nthat was brewing when they reached Dublin. Mr Dillon, unfortunately,\r\nwas suffering from a grievous domestic bereavement at the time, and\r\nwas naturally unable to attend the Convention. The others, instead of\r\nstanding to their guns like men and courageously facing the opposition\r\nwhich unexpectedly confronted them, and which was largely founded on\r\nmisunderstandings, basely ran away from all their honourable\r\nobligations--from what they owed in good faith to the Liberal Party,\r\nas a duty to their country, and as a matter of self-respect to their\r\nown good name--and instead of standing by the Bill, defending it and\r\nexplaining whatever was not quite clear in its proposals, forestalled\r\nall criticism by putting up Mr Redmond to move its rejection. A more\r\nhumiliating attitude, a more callous betrayal, a more sorry\r\nperformance the whole history of political baseness and political\r\nineptitude cannot produce. The feeling that swept through Ireland on\r\nthe morrow of this Convention was one of disgust and shame, yet the\r\npeople were so firmly shackled in the bonds of the Party that they\r\nstill sullenly submitted to their chains. And the worst of this bitter\r\nbusiness is that the shameful thing need never have occurred. If Mr\r\nRedmond had boldly advocated the adoption of the measure instead of\r\nmoving its rejection in a state of cowardly panic, there is\r\nincontestable evidence he would have carried the overwhelming majority\r\nof the Convention with him.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the members of his Party had no love for the Bill.\r\nSensible of their own imperfections, as many of them were, and well\r\naware that, whilst considered good enough by their constituents for\r\nservice at Westminster, it was quite possible they would not come up\r\nto the standard which national duty at home would set up, they were\r\nnaturally not very enthusiastic about any measure which would threaten\r\ntheir vested interests. It may appear an extraordinary statement to\r\nmake to those who do not know their Ireland very well that the members\r\nof the Party were not the best that could be got, the best that would\r\nbe got, under other conditions to serve in a representative capacity.\r\nBut it is nevertheless true that the conditions of service at\r\nWestminster were not such as to tempt or induce the best men to leave\r\ntheir professions or their interests for seven or eight months of the\r\nyear, whereas it was and is to be hoped that when the time comes the\r\ncream of Irish intellect, ability and character will seek the\r\nhonourable duty of building up Irish destinies in Ireland. In justice\r\nto those who did serve at Westminster let it be, however, said that it\r\ninvariably entailed loss and sacrifice even to the very least of them,\r\nand to very many, indeed, it meant ruined careers and broken lives.\r\n\r\nThis apart. The Irish Council Bill was lost because of bad leadership\r\nand bad faith, and the Irish Party continued to travel stumblingly\r\nalong its pathway of disaster and disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                             LAND AND LABOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of every country, when one comes seriously to reflect on\r\nit, are to a great extent dependent on these two vital factors--Land\r\nand Labour. In a country so circumstanced as Ireland, practically\r\nbereft of industries and manufactures, land and labour--and more\r\nespecially the labour which is put into land--are the foundation of\r\nits very being. They mean everything to it--whether its people be well\r\nor ill off, whether its trade is good, its towns prosperous, its\r\nnational economy secure.\r\n\r\nThe history of Ireland, ever since the first Englishman set foot on it\r\nwith the eye of conquest, centres to a more or less degree around the\r\nland. We know how the ancient clans tenaciously clung to their\r\nheritage and how ruthlessly they were deprived of it by the\r\nPlantations and the Penal Laws and by a series of confiscations, the\r\nmemory of which even still chills the blood. Conquest, confiscation,\r\neviction, persecution--this was the terrible story of Ireland for\r\nseven centuries--and the past century worst of all. At the\r\ncommencement of the nineteenth century Ireland was extensively\r\ncultivated. The land had been parcelled out amongst the people;\r\nholdings were multiplied and tenancies for life increased amazingly\r\nbecause it meant a larger rent-roll for the landlord and a great\r\nincrease in the voting power of his serfs. But there came the Corn\r\nLaws, making cultivation unprofitable, and earlier the law of Catholic\r\nEmancipation, withdrawing the right of voting from the forty-shilling\r\nfreeholders, and the crisis was reached when the Great Famine appeared\r\nand was followed by the Great Clearances. The Famine lasted for three\r\nyears, the Clearances endured for over thirty. Houses were demolished,\r\nfences levelled, the peasants swept out and the notices to quit kept\r\nfalling, as the well-known saying of Gladstone expressed it, as thick\r\nas snowflakes. Between 1849 and 1860, according to Mulhall, 373,000\r\nIrish families were evicted, numbering just about 2,000,000 in all. \"I\r\ndo not think the records of any country, civilised or barbarian,\" said\r\nSir Robert Peel, \"ever presented such scenes of horror.\"\r\n\r\nLegislation became necessary to counteract the appalling evils arising\r\nfrom such a state of things. It went on through the years with varying\r\nfortune, never providing any real solution of the intolerable\r\nrelations between landlord and tenant, until the blessed Land\r\nConference pact was sealed and signed and the country finally\r\ndelivered from the haunting terror of landlordism. Now although the\r\nentire population may be said in Ireland to be either directly or\r\nindirectly dependent on the land, two classes were absolutely\r\ndependent on it for their very livelihood--namely, the farmers and the\r\nagricultural labourers. And through all the various agrarian\r\nagitations they made united cause against their common enemy, the\r\nlandlord. There was also in the days of my boyhood a far friendlier\r\nrelation between the farmers and labourers than unhappily exists at\r\npresent. Their joint heritage of suffering and hardship had drawn them\r\ntogether in bonds of sympathy and friendship. The farmer often shared,\r\nin the bitterness of the winter months, something out of his own stock\r\nof necessities with his less fortunate labourer. And before the\r\narrival of the Creameries the daily allowance of the gallon of\r\n\"skimmed\" milk was made to almost every labourer's family in the\r\ncountry by kind-hearted neighbouring farmers. In addition, in a land\r\nwhere few were rich, the ancient proverb held good: \"The poor always\r\nhelp one another.\" And it is true that, in the darkest days of their\r\nsuffering, the farmers and labourers shouldered their troubles and\r\ntheir sorrows in a community of sympathy, which at least lessened\r\ntheir intensity. It is only with the growth of a greater independence\r\namong either class that the old friendly bonds and relationships have\r\nshown a loosening, and newer and more personal interests have tended\r\nto divide them into distinctive bodies, with separate class interests\r\nand class programmes.\r\n\r\nAs a very little boy I remember trudging my way to school with\r\nchildren who knew not what the comfort of boots and stockings was on\r\nthe coldest winter's day; who shivered in insufficient rags and whose\r\ngaunt bodies never knew any nourishment save what could be got from\r\n\"Indian meal stir-about\" (a kind of weak and watery porridge made from\r\nmaize). And it was not the children of the labourers alone who endured\r\nthis bleak and starved and sunless childhood; the offspring of the\r\nsmaller struggling farmers were often as badly off--they were all the\r\nprogeny of the poor, kept poor and impoverished by landlordism. This\r\nfurther bond of blood and even class relationship also bound the\r\nfarmers and labourers together--the labourers of to-day were, in\r\ncountless cases, the farmers of yesterday, whom the Great Clearances\r\nhad reduced to the lowest form of servitude and who dragged out an\r\nexistence of appalling wretchedness in sight of their former homes,\r\nnow, alas, razed to the ground. My mind carries me back to the time\r\nwhen the agricultural labourer in Munster was working for four\r\nshillings a week, and trying to rear a family on it! I vowed then that\r\nif God ever gave me the chance to do anything for this woe-stricken\r\nclass I would strive for their betterment, according to the measure of\r\nmy opportunity. And it happened, in the mysterious workings of\r\nProvidence, that I was able to battle and plan and accomplish solid\r\nwork for the amelioration of the labourers' lot.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr William O'Brien was labouring for the wretched \"congests\" in\r\nthe West and founding the United Irish League to make the great final\r\nonslaught on the ramparts of landlordism, a few of us in the South\r\nwere engaged unpretentiously but earnestly to get houses and\r\nallotments for the agricultural labourers, and to provide them with\r\nwork on the roads during the winter months when they could not labour\r\non the land. Ten years previously we had laid the foundations of what\r\nwe hoped would be a widespread national movement for the regeneration\r\nof the working classes. The founder of that movement was the late Mr\r\nP.J. Neilan, of Kanturk, a man of eminent talent and of a great heart\r\nthat throbbed with sympathy for the sufferings of the workers. I was\r\nthen a schoolboy, with a youthful yearning of my own towards the poor\r\nand the needy, and I joined the new movement. Two others--the one John\r\nD. O'Shea, a local painter, and the other John L. O'Shea, a carman\r\n(the similarity of their names often led to amusing mistakes)--with\r\nsome humble town workers, formed the working vanguard of the new\r\nmovement, what I might term a sort of apostolate of rural democracy.\r\nOur organisation was first known as the Kanturk Trade and Labour\r\nAssociation. As we carried our flag, audaciously enough, as it seemed\r\nin those days, to neighbouring villages and towns, we enlarged our\r\ntitle, and now came to be known as \"the Duhallow Trade and Labour\r\nAssociation.\" I was then trying some 'prentice flights in journalism\r\nand I managed to get reports of our meetings into the Cork Press, with\r\nthe result that demands for our evangelistic services began to flow in\r\nupon us from Kerry and Limerick and Tipperary. But, even as we grew\r\nand waxed stronger we still, with rather jealous exclusiveness, called\r\nourselves \"the parent branch\" in Kanturk. We are, by the way, a very\r\nproud people down there, proud of our old town and our old barony,\r\nwhich has produced some names distinguished in Irish history, such as\r\nJohn Philpot Curran, Barry Yelverton and the adored _fiancée_ of\r\nRobert Emmet.\r\n\r\nIn time we interested Michael Davitt in our movement, and we achieved\r\nthe glorious summit of our ambitions when we got him to preside at a\r\ngreat Convention of our Labour branches in Cork, where we formally\r\nlaunched the movement on a national basis under the title of the Irish\r\nDemocratic Trade and Labour Federation. The credit of this achievement\r\nwas altogether and entirely due to Mr Neilan, who had founded the\r\nmovement, watched over its progress, addressed its meetings, framed\r\nits programme and carried it triumphantly to this stage of success.\r\nUnfortunately, when all seemed favourable for the spread of the\r\nmovement, though not in opposition to the National League but as a\r\nsort of auxiliary force, moving in step with it, the disastrous Split\r\noccurred. It spelt ruin for our organisation because I think it will\r\nnot be denied that the workers are the most vehement and vital\r\nelements in the national life, and they took sides more violently than\r\nany other section of the population. After trying for a little while\r\nto steer the Democratic Trade and Labour Federation clear of the\r\nshoals of disunion, and having failed, Mr Neilan and his friends gave\r\nup the task in despair. Meanwhile, however, Mr Michael Austin of the\r\nCork United Trades, who was joint-secretary, with Mr Neilan, of the\r\nFederation, succeeded in getting himself absorbed into the Irish\r\nParty, and, having got the magic letters of M.P. after his name, not\r\nvery much was ever heard of him in the Labour movement afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of journalistic experience I left Ireland for a few\r\nyears, and on my return I found that a new Labour movement had been\r\nfounded on the ruins of the old, under the title of the Irish Land and\r\nLabour Association. Mr James J. O'Shee, a young Carrick-on-Suir\r\nsolicitor, was the secretary and moving spirit in this--a man of\r\nadvanced views, of intense sympathy with the labourer's position, and\r\nof a most earnest desire to improve their wretched lot. I obtained an\r\neditorial position in West Cork which left me free to devote my spare\r\ntime to the Labour cause, which I again enthusiastically espoused,\r\nhaving as colleagues in County Cork Mr Cornelius Buckley, of Blarney,\r\nanother of exactly the same name in Cork, my old friend Mr John L.\r\nO'Shea, of Kanturk, and Mr William Murphy, of Macroom--men whose names\r\ndeserve to be for ever honourably associated with the movement which\r\ndid as much in its own way for the emancipation and independence of\r\nthe labourers as the National organisations did for the farmers.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose here to recount the fierce opposition that was\r\ngiven to the labourer's programme. It had at first no friends either\r\nin the Party or in the Press. I verily believe that there were\r\notherwise good and honest men who thought the labourers had no citizen\r\nrights and that it was the height of conscious daring for anybody to\r\nlift either hand or voice on their behalf. But those of us who had\r\ntaken up the labourer's cause were well aware of all the difficulties\r\nand obstacles that would confront us; and we knew that worst of all we\r\nhad to battle with the deadly torpor of the labourers themselves, who\r\nwere trained to shout all right for \"the Land for the People\" but who\r\nhad possibly no conception of their own divine right to an inheritance\r\nin that selfsame land. Furthermore, since the Land and Labour\r\nAssociation was an organisation entirely apart from the Trade and\r\nLabour movement of the cities and larger corporate towns we received\r\nlittle support or assistance from what I may term, without offence,\r\nthe aristocracy of labour. We nevertheless simply went our way,\r\nbuilding up our branches, extending knowledge of the labourers'\r\nclaims, educating these humble folk into a sense of their civic rights\r\nand citizen responsibilities and making thinking men out of what were\r\npreviously little better than soulless serfs. It was all desperately\r\nhard, uphill work, with little to encourage and no reward beyond the\r\nconsciousness that one was reaching out a helping hand to the most\r\nneglected, despised, and unregarded class in the community. The\r\npassage of the Local Government Act of 1898 was that which gave power\r\nand importance to our movement. The labourers were granted votes for\r\nthe new County and District Councils and Poor Law Guardians as well as\r\nfor Members of parliament. They were no longer a people to be kicked\r\nand cuffed and ordered about by the shoneens and squireens of the\r\ndistrict: they became a very worthy class, indeed, to be courted and\r\nflattered at election times and wheedled with all sorts of fair\r\npromises of what would be done for them. The grant of Local Government\r\nenabled the labourers to take a mighty stride in the assertion of\r\ntheir independent claims to a better social position and more constant\r\nand remunerative employment. The programme that we put forward on\r\ntheir behalf was a modest one. It was our aim to keep within the\r\nimmediately practical and attainable and the plainly justifiable and\r\nreasonable. In the towns and in the country they had to live in hovels\r\nand mud-wall cabins which bred death and disease and all the woeful\r\nmiseries of mankind. One would not kennel a dog or house any of the\r\nlower animals in the vile abominations called human dwellings in which\r\ntens of thousands of God's comfortless creatures were huddled together\r\nin indiscriminate wretchedness. Added to that, most of them had not a\r\n\"haggart\" (a few perches of garden) on which to grow any household\r\nvegetables. They were landless and starving, the last word in pitiful\r\nrags and bare bones. They were in a far greater and more intense\r\ndegree than the farmers the victims of capricious harvests, whilst\r\ntheir winters were recurrent periods of the most awful and\r\nunbelievable distress and hunger and want. The first man to notice\r\ntheir degraded position was Parnell, who, early in the eighties, got a\r\nLabourers' Act passed for the provision of houses and half-acre\r\nallotments of land. But as the administration of this Act was\r\nentrusted to the Poor Law Boards, as it imposed a tax upon the\r\nratepayers, and as the labourers had then no votes and could secure no\r\nconsideration for their demands, needless to say, very few cottages\r\nwere built. With the advent of the Local Government Act and the\r\nextension of the franchise, the labourer was now able to insist on a\r\nspeeding-up of building operations. But the Labourers' Act needed many\r\namendments, a simplification and cheapening of procedure, an extension\r\nof taxing powers, an enlargement of the allotment up to an acre and,\r\nwhere the existing abode of the labourers was insanitary, an\r\nundeniable claim to a new home. Moderate and just and necessary to the\r\nnational welfare as these claims were, it took us years of unwearied\r\nagitation before we were able to get them legislatively recognised.\r\nWhat we did, however, more promptly achieve was the smashing of the\r\ncontract system by which the roads of the country were farmed out to\r\ncontractors, mostly drawn from the big farming and grazier classes\r\nwho, by devious dodges, known to all, were able to make very\r\ncomfortable incomes out of them. We insisted--and after some exemplary\r\ndisplays of a resolute physical force we carried our point--that in\r\nthe case of the main roads, particularly, these should be worked under\r\nthe system known as \"direct labour\"--that is, by the county and deputy\r\nsurveyors directly employing the labourers on them and paying them a\r\ndecent living wage. In this way we removed at one stroke the black\r\nshadow of want that troubled their winters and made these dark months\r\na horror for them and their families. But we had still to remove the\r\nmud-wall cabins and the foetid dens in the villages and towns in which\r\nfamilies were huddled together anyhow, and in our effort to bring\r\nabout this most necessary of social reforms we received little or no\r\nassistance from public men or popular movements. We were left to our\r\nown unaided resources and our own persistent agitation. As I have\r\nalready stated, I was elected Member of Parliament for Mid-Cork on the\r\ndeath of Dr Tanner in 1901, and Mr O'Shee had been previously elected\r\nfor West Waterford, but not strictly on the Land and Labour platform\r\nas I was. Nevertheless, we heartily co-operated in and out of\r\nParliament in making the Labour organisation a real and vital force,\r\nand our relations for many useful years, as I am happy to think, were\r\nof the most cordial and kindly character.\r\n\r\nIn the Land Purchase Act of 1903 Mr Wyndham included a few\r\ninsignificant clauses bearing on the labourer's grievances, but\r\ndropped them on the suggestion of Mr O'Brien, to whom he gave an\r\nundertaking at the same time to bring in a comprehensive Labourers'\r\nBill in the succeeding session. When that session came Mr Wyndham had,\r\nhowever, other fish to fry. The Irish Party and the Orange gang were\r\nhowling for his head, and his days of useful service in Ireland were\r\nreduced to nothingness. Meanwhile we kept pressing our demands as\r\nenergetically as we could on the public notice, but we were\r\nsystematically boycotted in the Press and by the Nationalist leaders\r\nuntil a happy circumstance changed the whole outlook for us. It was\r\nour custom to invite to all our great Labour demonstrations the\r\nvarious Nationalist leaders, without any regard to their differences\r\nof opinion on the main national issue. The way we looked at it was\r\nthis--that we wanted the support of all parties in Ireland, Unionist\r\nas well as Nationalist, for our programme, which was of a purely\r\nnon-partisan character, and we were ready to welcome support from any\r\nquarter whence it came.\r\n\r\nOur invitations were, however, sent out in vain until, on Mr O'Brien's\r\nre-election for Cork in October 1904, a delegation from the Land and\r\nLabour Association approached him and requested him to come upon our\r\nplatform and to specifically advocate the labourers' claims, now long\r\noverdue. Without any hesitation, nay, even with a readiness which made\r\nhis acceptance of our request doubly gracious, Mr O'Brien replied that\r\nnow that the tenants' question was on the high road to a settlement he\r\nconsidered that the labourers had next call on the national energies\r\nand that, for his part, he would hold himself at our disposal.\r\n\r\nWhat followed is so faithfully and impartially related in Mr O'Brien's\r\nbook, _An Olive Branch in Ireland,_ that I reproduce it:\r\n\r\n\"One of our first cares on my return to Cork was to restore vitality\r\nto the labourer's cause, and formulate for the first time a precise\r\nlegislative scheme on which they might take their stand as their\r\ncharter. This scheme was placed before the country at a memorable\r\nmeeting in Macroom on December 10, 1904, and whoever will take the\r\ntrouble of reading it will find therein all the main principles and\r\neven details of the great measure subsequently carried into law in\r\n1906. The Irish Land and Labour Association, which was the\r\norganisation of the labourers, unanimously adopted the scheme, and\r\ncommissioned their Secretary, Mr J.J. Shee, M.P., in their name, to\r\nsolicit the co-operation of the Directory of the United Irish League\r\nin convening a friendly Conference of all Irish parties and sections\r\nfor the purpose of securing the enactment of a Labourers' Bill on\r\nthese lines as a non-contentious measure. If common ground was to be\r\nfound anywhere on which all Irishmen, or at the worst all\r\nNationalists, might safely grasp hands, and with a most noble aim, it\r\nwas surely here. But once more Mr Dillon scented some new plot against\r\nthe unity and authority of the Irish Party, and at the Directory\r\nmeeting of the secretary of the Land and Labour Association was\r\ninduced without any authority from his principals to abandon their\r\ninvitation, and thus take the first step to the disruption of his own\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n\"I bowed and held my peace, to see what another year might bring forth\r\nthrough the efforts of those who had made a national agreement upon the\r\nsubject impracticable. Another year dragged along without a Labourers'\r\nBill, or any effort of the Irish Party to bring it within the domain of\r\npractical politics. The Land and Labour Association determined to rouse\r\nthe Government and the country to the urgency of the question by an\r\nagitation of an unmistakable character. Mr Redmond, Mr Dillon and all\r\ntheir chief supporters were invariably invited to these demonstrations;\r\nbut the moment they learned that Mr Harrington, Mr Healy and myself had\r\nbeen invited as well, a rigorous decree of boycott went forth against\r\nthe Labour demonstrations, and as a matter of fact no representative of\r\nthe Irish Party figured on the Labourers' platform throughout the\r\nagitation. This, unfortunately, was not the most inexcusable of their\r\nservices to the Labourers' cause. When the Land and Labour Association\r\nheld their annual Convention, the secretary, who had infringed their\r\ninstructions at the Directory meeting, finding himself hopelessly\r\noutnumbered, seceded from the organisation and formed a rival\r\nassociation of his own; and sad and even shocking though the fact is, it\r\nis beyond dispute that this split in the ranks of the unhappy labourers,\r\nin the very crisis of their cause, was organised with the aid of the\r\nmoneys of the National Organisation administered by the men who were at\r\nthat very moment deafening the country with their indignation against\r\ndissension-mongers and their zeal for majority rule.\r\n\r\n\"It was all over again the dog-in-the-manger policy which had already\r\nkept the evicted tenants for years out in the cold. They would neither\r\nstand on a non-contentious platform with myself nor organise a single\r\nLabourers' demonstration of their own. It has been repeatedly stated\r\nby members who were constant attendants at the meetings of the Irish\r\nParty that the subject of the Labourers' grievances was never once\r\ndiscussed at any meeting of the party until the agitation in Ireland\r\nhad first compelled the introduction of Mr Bryce's Bill. Then, indeed,\r\nwhen the battle was won, and there was only question of the booty, Mr\r\nRedmond made the public boast that he and Mr Dillon \"were in almost\r\ndaily communications with Mr Bryce upon the subject.\" The excuse was\r\nas unavailing as his plea that the finally revised terms of sale of\r\nhis Wexford estate left him without a penny of profit. What concerned\r\nthe country was the first announcement of 24-1/2 years' purchase\r\nauthorised under his own hand which had 'given a headline' to every\r\nlandlord in the country. In the same way, whatever obsequious\r\nattendance he might dance on Mr Bryce, when the die was cast and the\r\nBill safe, the ineffaceable facts remain that neither he nor anybody\r\nin his party whom he could influence had stood on a Labour platform,\r\nor touched upon the subject at the party meeting, while the intentions\r\nof the Government were, as we shall see in a moment, undecided in the\r\nextreme, but on the contrary were (it may be hoped unconscious but\r\nnone the less indispensable) parties to an organised effort to split\r\nthe Labourers' Association asunder while their fate was trembling in\r\nthe balance.\r\n\r\n\"Their war upon the Land and Labour Association was all the more\r\nwanton, because Mr Dillon's persuasion, which gave rise to it that the\r\nAssociation had been brigaded into my secret service for some\r\nnefarious purpose of my own, was as absurdly astray as all the rest of\r\nhis troubled dreams of my Machiavellian ambitions. To avoid giving any\r\npretext for such a suspicion, I declined to accept any office or\r\nhonour or even to become a member of the Land and Labour Association,\r\nattended no meeting to which Mr Redmond and Mr Dillon were not invited\r\nas well as I; and beyond my speeches at those meetings, never in the\r\nremotest degree interfered in the business or counsels of the\r\nAssociation. A number of men on the governing council of the\r\nAssociation were to my knowledge, and continued to be, sympathisers\r\nwith my critics. Beyond the fact that their president, Mr Sheehan,\r\nM.P., happened to be the most successful practiser of my Land Purchase\r\nplans in the county of Cork, as well as by far the ablest advocate the\r\nLabourers' agitation had called into action, I know of no shadow of\r\nexcuse for the extraordinary folly which led responsible Irishmen,\r\nwith the cry of 'Unity' on their lips, not only to decline to meet me\r\non a common platform, but to make tens of thousands of absolutely\r\nunoffending labourers the victims of their differences with me.\r\n\r\n\"Despite their aloofness and their attempts to divide the Labourers'\r\nbody, the agitation swept throughout the south of Ireland with an\r\nintensity which nothing could withstand. Demonstrations of amazing\r\nextent and still more remarkable resoluteness of spirit were addressed\r\nby my friends and myself in Charleville and Macroom, County Cork;\r\nKilfinane and Drumcolliher, County Limerick; Tralee and Castle Island,\r\nCounty Kerry; Scariff, County Clare; Goolds Cross, County Tipperary;\r\nand Ballycullane, County Wexford; and by the time they were over, the\r\nfield was fought and won. One last difficulty remained; but it was a\r\nformidable difficulty. So far from Mr Redmond's 'almost daily\r\ncommunications with Mr Bryce' reaching back to the critical days of\r\nthe problem, we were already in the first days of summer in the\r\nsession of 1906 when a communication was made to me from a high\r\nofficial quarter that the Irish Government were so deeply immersed in\r\nthe Irish Council Bill of the following year that they shrank from the\r\nlabour and the financial difficulties of a Labourers' Bill in the\r\ncurrent session, and an appeal was diplomatically hinted as to whether\r\nthere was any possibility of slowing down the Labourers' agitation so\r\nas to make a postponement to the following session practicable. My\r\nreply was undiplomatically clear:--that, if the Government wanted to\r\ndeprive the Irish Council Bill of all chance of a hearing, they could\r\nnot take a better means of making the country too hot for themselves\r\nthan by proposing to fob off the labourers for another year, and that\r\nnot only would I not, if I could, but could not if I would, moderate\r\ntheir insistence upon immediate redress.\r\n\r\n\"A short time afterwards, I met Sir Antony MacDonnell in the House of\r\nCommons, and he asked 'What is your labourers' minimum?' I gave him a\r\nbrief outline of the Macroom programme. 'No rational being could\r\nobject,' he said, 'but what does it mean in hard cash?' I replied,\r\n'Roughly, four millions.' And the great Irishman--'the worst enemy\r\nthat ever came to Ireland' of Mr Dillon's nightmare hours--ended the\r\ninterview with these laconic words: 'The thing ought to be done and I\r\nthink can be.' At the period of the session at which the Bill was\r\nintroduced, the opposition of even half-a-dozen determined men could\r\nhave at any stage achieved its ruin. Thanks, however, to the good\r\nfeeling the precedent of the Act of 1903 and the admirably\r\nconciliatory temper displayed by the labourers themselves in their\r\nagitation had engendered, the Bill went triumphantly through and has\r\nbeen crowned with glory in its practical application. I never pass\r\nthrough any of the southern counties now and feast my eyes on the\r\nlabourers' cottages which dot the landscape--prettier than the\r\nfarmers' own homes--honeysuckles or jasmines generally trailing around\r\nthe portico--an acre of potato ground sufficient to be a sempiternal\r\ninsurance against starvation, stretching out behind--the pig and the\r\npoultry--perhaps a plot of snowdrops or daffodils for the English\r\nmarket, certainly a bunch of roses in the cheeks of the children\r\nclustering about the doorsteps--without thankfully acknowledging that\r\nCork was right in thinking such conquests were worth a great deal of\r\nevil speech from angry politicians.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                 SOME FURTHER SALVAGE FROM THE WRECKAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr O'Brien retired in 1903 the majority of the members of the\r\nParty scarcely knew what to make of it, and I have to confess myself\r\namong those who were lost in wonder and amazement at the suddenness of\r\nthe event and the reasons that caused it. This knowledge came later,\r\nbut until I got to a comprehension of the entire facts I refused to\r\nmix myself up with either side. When, however, Mr O'Brien returned to\r\npublic life in 1904, I saw my way clear to associate myself with his\r\npolicy and to give it such humble and independent support as I could.\r\nIt will be remembered that one of Mr O'Brien's proposals for testing\r\nthe Purchase Act was to select suitable estates, parish by parish,\r\nwhere for one reason or another the landlords could be induced to\r\nagree to a reasonable number of years' purchase and thus to set up a\r\nstandard which, with the strength of the National organisation to back\r\nit up, could be enforced all over the country. The \"determined\r\ncampaigners\" defeated this plan but failed to provide any machinery of\r\ntheir own to protect the tenant purchasers or to assist them in their\r\nnegotiations. On Mr O'Brien's re-election he took immediate steps to\r\nform an Advisory Committee composed of delegates from the eight\r\ndivisional executives of the city and county of Cork. This Committee\r\nadopted as its watchword, \"Conciliation plus Business,\" and as its\r\nhonorary secretary I can vouch for it that when the methods of\r\nConciliation failed we were not slow about putting into operation the\r\nbusiness side of our programme. Thus the landlord who could not be\r\ninduced to listen to reason around a table was compelled to come to\r\nterms by an agitation which was none the less forceful and effective\r\nbecause it was directed and controlled by men of conciliatory temper\r\nwhom circumstances obliged to resort to extreme action.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the work of the Advisory Committee, ranging over a\r\nnumber of years, are blazoned in the official statistics. They make it\r\nclear that if only a similar policy had been working elsewhere the\r\ntenant purchasers all over Ireland would have got infinitely better\r\nterms than they did. The bare fact is that in County Cork, where we\r\nhad proportionately the largest number of tenant purchasers (in\r\nMid-Cork, I am glad to say, there was scarcely a tenant who did not\r\npurchase, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred through my\r\nintervention), the prices are, roughly, two years' purchase lower than\r\nthe average all over the rest of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn Cork, where Mr O'Brien's policy prevailed, we had, outside the\r\nCongested Districts, from 1st November 1903 to 31st March 1909, a\r\ntotal of 16,159 tenant purchasers, and the amount of the purchase\r\nmoney was £7,994,591; whilst in Mayo, one of whose divisions Mr Dillon\r\nrepresented in Parliament, and where his doctrines held sway, the\r\nnumber of tenant purchasers in the same period was 774, and the amount\r\nof the purchase money only £181,256. And be it noted what these\r\nunfortunate and misguided Mayo men have to be grateful for: that they\r\nhave remained for all these years, since the Act of 1903 was placed on\r\nthe Statute Book, under the old inexorable rent-paying conditions,\r\nwhilst down in Cork the tenants are almost to a man the proprietors of\r\ntheir own holdings, owning their own improvements, knowing that every\r\nyear that passes brings the time nearer when their land will be free\r\nof annuities, and having all that sweet content and satisfaction that\r\nflow from personal ownership. Up in Mayo, in a famous speech delivered\r\nat Swinford, 12th September 1906, three years after the Land Purchase\r\nAct was passed, Mr Dillon declared:\r\n\r\n\"Attempts have been made to throw the blame on Michael Davitt, _The\r\nFreeman's Journal_ and myself, and it has been said that we have\r\ndelayed the reinstatement of the evicted tenants and obstructed the\r\nsmooth working of the Act more than we have done. It has worked too\r\nsmoothly--far too smoothly, to my mind. Some men have complained\r\nwithin the past year that the Land Act was not working smooth enough.\r\nFor my part I look upon it as working a great deal too fast. Its pace\r\nhas been ruinous to the people.\"\r\n\r\nThere, in a nutshell and sufficiently stated, are the two policies. Mr\r\nO'Brien wanted to expedite land purchase by every means in his power,\r\nbut he wished that the tenants should have proper advisers and should\r\nact under the skilled guidance of their own organisation, so that they\r\nmay make no bad bargains. Mr Dillon, on his part, sought to kill land\r\npurchase outright, but why he should have had this mad infatuation\r\nagainst the most beneficent Act that was passed for Ireland in our\r\ngeneration, I am at a loss to know, if it is not that he allowed his\r\npersonal feeling against Mr O'Brien to cloud the operations of his\r\nintellect. It is a curious commentary, however, on the good faith of\r\nthe Party leaders, that whilst Mr Dillon was making the speech I have\r\nquoted to his constituents at Swinford, his bosom friend and\r\nconfidant, Mr T.P. O'Connor, who was seeking the shekels in New York,\r\nwas telling his audience that \"the Irish landlords were on the run,\r\nand, if they continued to yield, in fifteen years the very name of\r\nlandlordism would be unknown. I say to the British power:--after seven\r\ncenturies we have beaten you; the land belongs now to the Irish; the\r\nland is going back to the old race.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is one to say of the manhood or honour of the men who spent their\r\ndays denouncing the policy of Conciliation in Ireland, but who, when\r\nthey went across the Atlantic, and wanted to coax the money out of the\r\nexiles' pockets, spoke the sort of stuff that Mr O'Connor so\r\nsoothingly \"slithered\" out at New York?\r\n\r\nI say it with full and perfect knowledge of the facts, that it was the\r\ndishonest policy of Mr Dillon, Mr T.P. O'Connor and the men who,\r\nblindly and weakly, and with an abominable lack of moral courage,\r\nfollowed their leadership, which has kept one hundred thousand tenants\r\nstill under the heel of landlordism in Ireland. These men, in driving\r\na nail into the policy of Conciliation, drove a nail far more deeply\r\ninto their own coffin. In burying the Land Act of 1903 they were only\r\nopening graves for themselves, but, in the words of Mr Redmond, they\r\nwere \"so short-sighted and unwise\" they could not see the inevitable\r\nresult of their malicious side-stepping.\r\n\r\nI know of no greater glory that any man, or Party, or organisation\r\ncould aspire to than to be, in any way, however humble, associated\r\nwith the policy which made three hundred thousand of the farmers of\r\nIreland the owners of their own hearths and fields. Where the Land\r\nPurchase Act operated it gave birth to a new race of peasant owners,\r\nwho were frugal, industrious, thrifty, and assiduous in the\r\ncultivation and improvement of the soil. In a few years the face of\r\nthe country was transformed. A new life and energy were springing into\r\nbeing. The old tumble-down farm-houses and out-offices began to be\r\nreplaced by substantial, comfortable, and commodious buildings.\r\nPersonal indebtedness became almost a thing of the past, and the\r\ngombeen man--one of Ireland's national curses--was fast fading out of\r\nsight. The tenant purchasers, against whose solvency the \"determined\r\ncampaigners\" issued every form of threat, took a pride in paying their\r\npurchase instalments as they fell due. The banks began to swell out\r\ninto a plethoric affluence on their deposits. And who can estimate the\r\nsocial sweetness that followed on land purchase--the sense of peace\r\nand security that it gave to the tenant and his family, the falling\r\nfrom him of the numbing shadows of unrest and discontent? Also with\r\nthe disappearance of agrarian troubles and the unsettlement that\r\nattended them there has been a notable decline in the consumption of\r\nalcohol. To reverse an old saying: \"Ireland sober is Ireland free\"--it\r\nmay be said that \"Ireland free (of landlordism) is Ireland sober.\" And\r\nthen the happiness of being the master of one's own homestead! No race\r\nin the world clings so lovingly to the soil as the Irish. We have the\r\nclan feeling of a personal love and affection for the spot of earth\r\nwhere we were born, and when the shadows of evening begin to fall\r\nathwart our lives, do we not wish to lay ourselves down in that\r\nhallowed spot where the bones of our forefathers mingle with the dust\r\nof ages? Truly we love the land of our birth--every stone of it, every\r\nblade of grass that grows in it, its lakes, its valleys, and its\r\nstreams, each mountain that in rugged grandeur stands sentinel over\r\nit, each rivulet that whispers its beautiful story to us--and because\r\nwe would yet own it for our very own, we grudge not the sacrifices\r\nthat its final deliverance demands, for it will be all the dearer in\r\nthat its liberty was dearly purchased with the tears and the blood of\r\nour best!\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the Evicted Tenants Question was another of the\r\nvital issues salved from the wreckage. There were from eight to ten\r\nthousand evicted tenants--\"the wounded soldiers of the Land War\" as\r\nthey were termed--to whom the Irish Party and the National\r\nOrganisation were pledged by every tie of honour that could bind all\r\nbut the basest. The Land Conference Report made an equitable\r\nsettlement of the Evicted Tenants problem an essential portion of\r\ntheir treaty of peace. But the revival of an evil spirit amongst the\r\nworst landlords and the interpretations of hostile law officers\r\nreduced the Evicted Tenants clause in the Act of 1903 almost to a\r\nnullity. In this extremity the Cork evicted tenants requested the Land\r\nConference to reassemble and specify in precise language the\r\nsettlement which they regarded as essential. All the representatives\r\nof the landlords and of the tenants on the Conference accepted the\r\ninvitation, with the single exception of Mr Redmond. Eventually,\r\ndespite these and other discouragements, the Conference met in Dublin\r\nin October 1906, sat for three days, and agreed upon lines of\r\nsettlement which were given effect to in legislation by Mr Bryce the\r\nfollowing year. True, the restoration of these unhappy men did not\r\nproceed as rapidly as their sacrifices or interests demanded. They\r\nwere also the victims of the malign opposition extended to the policy\r\nof Conciliation, even when it embraced a deed so essentially\r\ncharitable as the relief of the families who had borne the burden and\r\nthe heat of the day in the fierce agrarian wars. Lamentable to relate,\r\nMr Dillon tried to intimidate Mr T.W. Russell and Mr Harrington from\r\njoining the Conference, and when he failed, publicly denounced their\r\nReport. And if there are still some of them \"on the roadside,\" as I\r\nregret to think they are, the blame does not lie with the\r\nConciliationists, but with those who persistently opposed their\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nIn the settlement of the University Question Cork also took the lead\r\nwhen its prospects were in a very bad way. This had been for over a\r\ncentury a vexed and perplexing problem. I have dealt cursorily with\r\nprimary education, which is even still in a deplorably backward state\r\nin Ireland. Secondary education has not yet been placed on a\r\nscientific basis, and is not that natural stepping-stone between the\r\nprimary school and the university that it ought to be. There is no\r\nintelligent co-ordination of studies in Ireland and we suffer as no\r\nother country from ignorantly imposed \"systems\" which have had for\r\ntheir object, not the development of Irish brains but the\r\nAnglicisation of Irish youth, who were drenched with the mire of\r\n\"foreign\" learning when they should have been bathed in the pure\r\nstream of Irish thought and culture.\r\n\r\nIt would require a volume in itself to deal with all the evils, not\r\nonly intellectual and educational, but social, economic and political,\r\nwhich Ireland has suffered owing to the absence of a higher education\r\ndirected to the development of her special psychological and material\r\nneeds. It took eighty years of agitation before anything like\r\neducational equality in the higher realms of study was established.\r\nThe Protestants had in Trinity College a university with a noble\r\ntradition and a great historic past. The Catholics had only University\r\nCollege and a Royal University, which conferred degrees without\r\ncompulsion of residence. In hounding Mr Wyndham from office and\r\nkilling him (in the political sense, though one would be sorely\r\ntempted to add, also in the physical sense), the Irish Party also\r\ndestroyed, amongst other things, the prospects of a University\r\nsettlement in 1904. A University Bill had, as a matter of fact, been\r\npromised as the principal business for that session. The question was\r\nin a practically quiescent state, nobody taking any particular\r\ninterest in it, when the Catholic laity of Cork, supported by the mass\r\nof the Protestant laity as well (as was now become the custom on all\r\ngreat questions in the leading Irish county), came together in a\r\nmighty and most representative gathering, which instantly impressed\r\nstatesmen that this educational disability on religious grounds could\r\nno longer be tolerated. Mr Birrell, who failed in most other things\r\nduring his ill-starred Irish administration, was admirably energetic\r\nand suave in getting his University proposals through. And it was by\r\nemploying wisely the methods of conciliation and winning over to his\r\nside men of opposite political views, like Mr Balfour, Mr Wyndham, Sir\r\nEdward Carson, and Professor Butcher that he piloted the Bill safely\r\nthrough its various Parliamentary stages.\r\n\r\nWith the success of Land Purchase, with the introduction and passage\r\nof the Labourers and University Acts, with the settlement of the\r\nEvicted Tenants Question, and with the offering of any resistance to\r\nthe effort made to remove the embargo on Canadian cattle, which would\r\nseriously have affected the prospects of the farmers, the Irish Party\r\nhad exercised no initiative and could not legitimately claim one atom\r\nof credit in respect of them. Yet when their Parliamentary prestige\r\nbegan to shake and show unmistakable signs of an approaching collapse,\r\nit was ever their habit to group these among their achievements in the\r\nsame way that they appropriated the fruits of Parnell's genius--it was\r\n\"the Party\" that did everything, and so they demanded that the people\r\nshould sing eternal Hosannas to its glory.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the Party, or, more correctly, to Mr J.J. Clancy, M.P.,\r\nwho stood sponsor for the measures and watched over their progress\r\nwith paternal care, they did get inscribed on the Statute Book two\r\nActs of considerable importance--the Town Tenants Act and the Housing\r\nof the Working Classes Act, but beyond these the less said of their\r\nParliamentary conquests from 1903 onward the better. Their\r\nachievements were rather of the destructive and mischievous than the\r\nconstructive and beneficent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                          REUNION AND TREACHERY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be said that whilst all these things were going on in Ireland\r\nand the Party marching with steady purpose to its irretrievable doom,\r\nthe British people were in the most profound state of ignorance as to\r\nwhat was actually happening. And the same may be said of the Irish in\r\nAmerica, Australia, and all the other distant lands to which the\r\nmissionary Celts have betaken themselves. They were all fed with the\r\nsame newspaper pap. The various London Correspondents took their cue\r\nfrom Mr T.P. O'Connor and the _Freeman_. These and the Whips kept\r\nthem supplied with the tit-bits that were in due course served up to\r\ntheir several readers. And thus it never got to be known that it was\r\nMr William O'Brien and his friends who were the true repositories of\r\nParty loyalty and discipline, the only men who were faithful to the\r\npledge, who had never departed from the policy of Conference,\r\nConciliation and Consent, upon which the great Land Act of 1903 was\r\nbased and to which the Party, the United Irish League, and Nationalist\r\nopinion stood committed in the most solemn manner.\r\n\r\nWhen the General Election of 1906 took place those of us in County\r\nCork and elsewhere who had taken our stand by Mr O'Brien were marked\r\nout for opposition by the Party chiefs. But a truce was arranged\r\nthrough the intervention of Mr George Crosbie, editor of _The Cork\r\nExaminer_, who generously sought to avert a fight between brother\r\nNationalists, which, whatever its effects at home, would be bound to\r\nhave grave results abroad, where the only thing that would be\r\nstrikingly apparent was that brother Nationalists were at one\r\nanother's throats. So we all came back, if not exactly a happy family\r\nat least outwardly in a certain state of grace.\r\n\r\nThis state of things was not, however, to last. Without rhyme or\r\nreason, without cause stated or charge alleged, with no intimation of\r\nany sort or kind that I was acting contrary to any of the Party\r\ntenets, I was, so to speak, quietly dropped overboard from the Party\r\nship in November 1906. I did not get any official intimation that I\r\nwas dismissed the Party or that I had in any way violated my pledge to\r\nsit, act and vote with it. I was simply cut off from the Party Whips\r\nand the Parliamentary allowance and, without a word spoken or written,\r\nthus politely, as it were, told to go about my business. The matter\r\nseemed inconceivable and I wrote a firm letter of remonstrance to Mr\r\nRedmond. It drew from him merely a formal acknowledgment--an adding of\r\ninsult to injury. To test the matter I immediately resigned my seat\r\nfor Mid-Cork, placed the whole facts before my constituents, published\r\nmy letter and Mr Redmond's acknowledgment and challenged the Party to\r\nfight me on the issue they had themselves deliberately raised--namely,\r\nas to whether in supporting the policy of Conciliation I was in any\r\nway faithless to my pledge. Wise in their generation, the men who were\r\ncourageous enough to expel me from the Party, to which I belonged by\r\nas good a title as they, were not brave enough to meet me in the open\r\nin a fair fight and, where there could be no shirking a plain issue,\r\nand accordingly I had a bloodless victory. It was satisfactory to know\r\nI had the practically unanimous support and confidence of the electors\r\nof Mid-Cork. It would have been more satisfactory still if we had the\r\npolicy of Conciliation affirmed, as we undoubtedly would have, by an\r\noverwhelming vote in a genuine trial of strength. There were at this\r\ntime outside of the Party, besides myself, Mr William O'Brien, Mr T.\r\nM. Healy, M.P. for North Louth (who had not been readmitted after\r\n1900), Sir Thomas Esmonde, M.P. for North Wexford, Mr John O'Donnell,\r\nM.P. for South Mayo, Mr Charles Dolan, M.P. for South Leitrim, and Mr\r\nAugustine Roche (Mr O'Brien's colleague in the representation of\r\nCork).\r\n\r\nThe Party were now in a rather parlous state. The country was\r\ndisgusted with their mismanagement of the Irish Council Bill. Branches\r\nof the United Irish League had ceased to subscribe to the Party funds\r\nand it was evident that a temper distinctly hostile to the Party\r\nmanagers was widely springing up. Furthermore, an irresistible\r\nmovement of popular opinion set in, demanding that there should be a\r\nreunion of all the Nationalist forces and \"Unity\" demonstrations of\r\nhuge dimensions were held in Kerry, Limerick, Cork, Clare and Wexford.\r\nThere was no denying the intensity of the demand that there should be\r\nan end of those differences which divided brother Nationalists and\r\ndissipated their strength. Finally, at Ballycullane, in Mr Redmond's\r\nnative constituency, Mr O'Brien formulated proposals for reunion, the\r\nfirst of which is so notable as a declaration of Nationalist principle\r\nthat I quote it fully:\r\n\r\n\"No man or party has authority to circumscribe the inalienable right\r\nof Ireland to the largest measure of national self-government it may\r\nbe in her power to obtain.\"\r\n\r\nFurther conditions declared that it was the duty of Nationalist\r\nrepresentatives to devote themselves honestly to working for every\r\nmeasure of practical amelioration which it may be possible to obtain\r\nfrom \"either English Party, or from both,\" and that the co-operation\r\nof Irishmen of all creeds and classes willing to aid in the attainment\r\nof any or all of those objects should be cordially welcomed. Within a\r\nweek Mr Redmond conveyed to Mr O'Brien his desire for a Conference on\r\nunity. It was duly held. Mr O'Brien's proposals were substantially\r\nagreed to. It will be observed that they were a solemn reiteration of\r\nthe principles of Conference and Conciliation, which was the bed-rock\r\nbasis of the Party policy in its most useful and memorable year, 1903.\r\nIt is possible that if Mr O'Brien's suggestion for a National\r\nConvention to give the new Unity an enthusiastic \"send-off\" had been\r\nagreed to, many things might have been different to-day. But Mr Dillon\r\nnever wanted, in those days, if he could help it, to appear before a\r\ngreat assemblage of his countrymen in company with Mr O'Brien. He knew\r\nhis own limitations for popular appeal too well to risk comparison\r\nwith the most persuasive Irish orator since the days of O'Connell.\r\n\r\nThe six of us who rejoined the Party under the foregoing peace treaty\r\nwere sincerely anxious that the reunion should be cordial and thorough.\r\nWe saw, however, no manifestations of a similar spirit on the part of Mr\r\nDillon or his special coterie of friends. Mr O'Brien published in his\r\nown paper, _The Irish People,_ a _communique_ in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"I am certain the universal Irish instinct will be, frankly and\r\ncompletely, to drop all disputes as to the past and have no rivalries\r\nexcept as to who shall do most to create good will and a common\r\npatriotism among Irishmen of all shades and schools of thought. Let us\r\nturn with high hearts from the tragedies of the past to the glorious\r\npossibilities of the future.\"\r\n\r\nOur optimism was sadly disappointed when the first occasion came for\r\ntesting the sincerity of the reunion. A Treasury Report was issued\r\ncontaining proposals for lessening the landlords' bonus under the\r\nPurchase Act of 1903 and for increasing the tenants' annuities. (These\r\nproposals were later embodied in Mr Birrell's Land Act of 1909 and\r\npractically put an end to land purchase and to the beneficent\r\noperations of the Act of 1903.) A meeting of the reunited Party was\r\nsummoned for the Mansion House, Dublin (29th April 1908), to deal with\r\nthis grave situation, rendered all the more serious by reason of the\r\nfact that the Treasury proposals were openly advocated by _The\r\nFreeman's Journal._ One of the clauses of the articles of reunion\r\ndeclared that the co-operation of Irishmen of all classes and creeds\r\nwilling to aid in the attainment of, among other things, \"the\r\ncompletion of the abolition of landlordism\" is cordially welcomed.\r\nWhen Mr O'Brien moved, in order that the demands of the Treasury\r\nshould be met with a united and resolute Irish front, that the Party\r\nwas prepared to appoint representatives to confer with representatives\r\nof the landlords, Mr Dillon at once showed that on no account would be\r\nagree to any Conference, and he proposed an amendment that the whole\r\nmatter should be referred to a Committee of the Irish Party\r\nexclusively. This was a fatal blow at the principle on which the Party\r\nhad been reunited. Whilst the controversy raged around the Conference\r\nidea, Mr Redmond spoke never a word, though he saw that \"the\r\nshort-sighted and unwise policy\" was again getting the upper hand. Mr\r\nDillon carried his amendment by 45 votes to 15, and thus the treaty on\r\nwhich the Party was reunited was practically torn to pieces before the\r\nink was scarce dry on it.\r\n\r\nOne further effort was made to try to preserve the Act of 1903 from\r\nbeing ham-strung by the Treasury. A short time previously a deputation\r\nof the foremost landed men and representative bodies of Cork had saved\r\nIreland from the importation of Canadian cattle into Britain. It was\r\ndecided to organise now a still more powerful deputation from the\r\nprovince of Munster to warn the Government of the fatal effects of the\r\nproposed Birrell Bill. I had a great deal to do with the preliminaries\r\nof the meeting at which this deputation was selected, and I can say\r\nwith all certainty that if we had had only the most moderate display\r\nof political wisdom from Mr Dillon and his friends we could have the\r\ngreat mass of the landlords in Ireland agreeing to the full concession\r\nof the constitutional demand for Irish liberty. The Cork meeting was\r\nbeyond all doubt or question the most remarkable held in Ireland for a\r\ncentury. It was summoned by a Joint Committee drawn from the\r\nNationalist and landlord ranks. On its platform were assembled all the\r\nmen, either on the landlord or the tenant side, who had been the\r\nfiercest antagonists in the agrarian wars of the previous twenty-five\r\nyears--men who had literally taken their lives in their hands in\r\nfighting for their respective causes. It is but the barest truth to\r\nsay that the evictors and the evicted--the leading actors in the most\r\nawful of Ireland's tragedies--stood for the first time in Irish\r\nhistory side by side to join hands in a noble effort to obliterate the\r\npast and to redeem the future. It was one of the greatest scenes of\r\ntrue emotion and tremendous hope that ever was witnessed in any land\r\nor any time. If its brave and joyous spirit could only have been\r\ncaught up and passed along, we would have seen long before now that\r\nvision glorious which inspired the deeds and sacrifices of Tone and\r\nEmmet and the other magnificent line of martyrs for Irish liberty--we\r\nwould have witnessed that brotherhood of class and creed which is\r\nIreland's greatest need, and upon which alone can her eventual\r\nhappiness and liberty rest. And, most striking incident of all, here\r\nhad met, in a blessed forgetfulness of past rancours and of fierce\r\nblows given and received, the two most redoubtable champions of the\r\nlandlords and the tenants--Lord Barrymore and Mr William O'Brien, the\r\nmen whose sword blows upon each other's shields still reverberated in\r\nthe minds of everyone present. What a study for a painter, or poet, or\r\nphilosopher! The most dauntless defender of landlordism, in a generous\r\nimpulse of what I believe to be the most genuine patriotism, stood on\r\na platform with Mr William O'Brien, whom he had fought so resolutely\r\nin the Plan of Campaign days, to declare in effect that landlordism\r\ncould no longer be defended and to agree as to the terms on which it\r\ncould be ended, with advantage to every section of the Irish nation.\r\nIt was only magnanimous men--men of fine fibre and a noble moral\r\ncourage--who could stretch their hands across the yawning chasm of the\r\nbad and bitter years, with all their evil memories of hates and wounds\r\nand scars and defy the yelpings of the malicious minds who were only\r\ntoo glad to lead on the pack, to shout afterwards at Mr O'Brien:\r\n\"Barrymore!\" when of a truth, of all the achievements of Mr O'Brien's\r\ncrowded life of effort and accomplishment there is not one that should\r\nbring more balm to his soul or consolation to his war-worn heart than\r\nthat he should have induced the enemy of other days to pay this\r\nhighest of all tributes to his honesty and worth. He had convinced his\r\nenemy of his rectitude, and what greater deed than this! I confess it\r\nmade my ears tingle with shame when I used to hear unthinking\r\nscoundrels, egged on by others who should have known better, shout\r\n\"Barrymore!\" at Mr O'Brien in their attempts to hold him up to public\r\nodium for an act which might easily have been made the most benign in\r\nhis life, as it certainly was one of the most noble.\r\n\r\nThis memorable meeting of the erstwhile warring hosts agreed\r\nabsolutely as to the main conditions on which the Land Settlement of\r\n1903 ought to be preserved--viz. that the abolition of landlordism\r\nshould be completed in the briefest possible time, that the rate of\r\ntenant purchasers' annuity should remain undisturbed, and that the\r\nState bonus to the landlords should not be altered. If there were to\r\nbe losses on the notation of land loans the loss should be borne by\r\nthe Imperial Treasury for the greatest of all Imperial purposes. A\r\ndeputation of unequalled strength and unrivalled representative\r\ncharacter was appointed to submit these views to the Prime Minister,\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary for Ireland.\r\nBut jealous and perverse and, I must add, blindly malignant,\r\ninfluences had been at work, and a deputation which comprised six\r\npeers, eleven Members of Parliament, and some of the leading public\r\nmen in Munster was refused a hearing by Mr Birrell. Though the act was\r\nthe act of Mr Birrell, all the world knew that the sinister figure in\r\nthe background was Mr Dillon. And they have both paid the penalty\r\nsince then of their follies, not to say crimes--though a nation still\r\nsuffers for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                      A NEW POWER ARISES IN IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Party manipulators had now got their stranglehold on the country.\r\nThe people, where they were not chloroformed into insensibility, were\r\ndoped into a state of corrupt acquiescence. All power was in the hands\r\nof the Party. The orthodox daily Press was wholly on their side. The\r\nBritish public and the English newspaper writers were impressed only,\r\nas always, by the big battalions. The Irish Party had numbers, and\r\nnumbers count in Parliament as nothing else does. Whatever information\r\nwent through to the American Press passed through tainted sources. An\r\ninfluential Irish-American priest, Father Eamon Duffy, writing some\r\ntime since in the great American Catholic magazine, _The\r\nMonitor_, said:\r\n\r\n\"We really never understood the situation in America. Ireland was in\r\nthe grip of the Party machine and of one great daily paper, and these\r\nwere our sources of information. It was only the great upheaval that\r\nawakened us from our dream and showed us that something had been\r\nwrong, and that the Party no longer represented the country.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable admission from an independent and unprejudiced\r\nauthority. He candidly declares they never understood the situation in\r\nAmerica. Neither was it understood in England, and the House of\r\nCommons is the last place which tries to understand anything except\r\nparty or personal interests. There is just about as much freedom of\r\nopinion and individual independence in Parliament as there could be in\r\na slave state. In Ireland, as I have said, outside Munster the truth\r\nwas never allowed to reach the people. Even the great national\r\nmovement which Mr William O'Brien re-created in the United Irish\r\nLeague had almost ceased to function. It was gradually superseded by a\r\nsecret sectarian organisation which was the absolute antithesis of all\r\nfree development of democratic opinion and the complete negation of\r\nliberty and fair play.\r\n\r\nUp in the north of Ireland there existed an organisation of a secret\r\nand sworn character which was an evil inheritance of an evil\r\ngeneration. From the fact that the Ribbonmen used to meet in a shebeen\r\nowned by one Molly Maguire, with the Irish adaptability for attaching\r\nnicknames to anything short of what is sacred, they became known as\r\n\"Molly Maguires,\" or, for short, \"the Mollies.\" In some ill-omened day\r\nbranches of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, which had seceded from\r\nthe American order of that name, began to interest themselves in\r\nUlster in political affairs. They called themselves the Board of Erin,\r\nbut they were, as I have said, more generally known as \"the Mollies.\"\r\nThey were a narrowly sectarian institution and they had the almost\r\nblasphemous rule that nobody but a Catholic frequenting the Sacraments\r\ncould remain a member. They had their own ritual and initiation\r\nceremony, founded on the Orange and Masonic precedents, and had their\r\nsecret signs and passwords. It is possible that they were at first\r\nintended to be a Catholic protection society in Ulster at the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century to combat the aggressiveness and the fanatical\r\nintolerance of the Orange Order, who sought nothing less than the\r\ncomplete extermination of the Catholic tenantry. A Catholic Defence\r\norganisation was a necessity in those circumstances, but when the\r\noccasion that gave it justification and sanction had passed it would\r\nhave been better if it were likewise allowed to pass. Any organisation\r\nwhich fans the flames of sectarianism and feeds the fires of religious\r\nbigotry should have no place in a community which claims the sacred\r\nright of freedom. It was the endeavour of Mr O'Brien and his friends\r\nfinally to close this bitter chapter of Irish history by reconciling\r\nthe ancient differences of the sects and inducing all Irishmen of good\r\nintent to meet upon a common platform in which there should be no\r\nrivalries except the noble emulations of men seeking the weal of the\r\nwhole by the combined effort of all.\r\n\r\nWhatever unfortunate circumstance or combination of circumstances gave\r\nimpulse to \"the Board of Erin,\" I know not-whether it arose out of a\r\nvainglorious purpose to meet the Orangemen with a weapon of import\r\nsimilar to their own, or whether it was merely the love of young\r\npeople to have association with the occult, I can merely\r\nconjecture--but it was only when Mr Joseph Devlin assumed the\r\nleadership of it that it began to acquire an influence in politics\r\nwhich could have no other ending than a disastrous one.\r\n\r\nNever before was the cause of Irish liberty associated with\r\nsectarianism. Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet and Thomas Davis are regarded\r\nas the most inspired apostles and confessors of Irish nationality. It\r\nwas a profanation of their memory and an insult to their creed that in\r\nthe first decade of the twentieth century any man or band of men\r\nshould have been audacious enough to superimpose upon the structure of\r\nthe national movement an organisation which in addition to being\r\nsecret and sectarian was grossly sordid and selfish in its aims.\r\n\r\nStealthily and insidiously \"the Board of Erin\" got its grip in the\r\nUnited Irish League. It \"bossed,\" by establishing a superiority of\r\nnumbers, the Standing Committee. Then by \"getting hold\" of the\r\nofficers of Divisional Executives and branches it acquired control\r\nover the entire machinery of the movement, and thus, in an amazingly\r\nshort space of time, it secured an ascendancy of a most deadly and\r\nmenacing character. Its first overt act of authority was to strangle\r\nfreedom of speech and to kill land purchase. What Mr John Dillon had\r\nbeen unable to do through his control of the Party and his collusion\r\nwith _The Freeman's Journal_ the Board of Erin most effectively\r\naccomplished by an energetic use of boxwood batons and, at a later\r\ntime, weapons of a more lethal character.\r\n\r\nA National Convention had been summoned to pronounce on the Birrell\r\nLand Bill of 1909--a measure which, with incomparable meanness, was\r\ndesigned \"to save the Treasury\" by ridding it of the honourable\r\nobligations imposed by the Wyndham Act of 1903. This Bill, on the\r\nground that the finance of the Act of 1903 had broken down, proposed\r\nto increase the rate of interest on land loans from 2-3/4 to 3-1/4 per\r\ncent., and to transform the bonus from a free Imperial grant to a\r\nTreasury debt against Ireland. Apparently it should require no\r\nargument to prove that this was a treacherous repeal of an existing\r\ntreaty, guaranteed by considered legislative enactment, and that it\r\nwas a proposal which no Irishman with any sense of the duty he owed\r\nhis country could for one moment entertain. But it was the unthinkable\r\nand the unbelievable thing which happened. Mr Dillon was determined,\r\nat all costs--and how heavy these costs were, one hundred thousand\r\nunpurchased tenants in Ireland to-day have weighty reason to know--to\r\nwreak his spite against the Wyndham Act, which he had over and over\r\nagain declared was working too smoothly, and prayed that he might have\r\nthe power to stop it. Mr Redmond I regard in all this wretched\r\nbusiness as the unwilling victim of the forces which held him, as a\r\nvice in their power. Yet from the sin of a weak compliancy in the\r\nunwise decrees of others he cannot be justly acquitted. Although the\r\nParty had rejected the proposal for a new Land Conference, and thereby\r\nbroken the articles of reunion under which Mr O'Brien and his friends\r\nre-entered it, we continued to remain within its fold. We could not,\r\nfor one thing, believe that the country was so steeped in ignorance\r\nand blindness that if the facts were once allowed to reach it, or the\r\narguments to be temperately addressed to any free assembly of\r\nIrishmen, they would not see where national interests lay. Accordingly\r\nMr O'Brien and his friends determined to submit, in constitutional\r\nfashion, the overwhelming objections to Mr Birrell's Bill to the\r\njudgment of the National Convention which was to consider whether the\r\nBill would expedite or destroy land purchase. It was conveyed to Mr\r\nO'Brien beforehand that it was madness on his part to attempt to get a\r\nhearing at the Convention, that this was the last thing \"the powers\r\nthat be\" would allow, and that as he valued his own safety it would be\r\nbetter for him to remain away.\r\n\r\nJust as he had never submitted to intimidation when it was backed by\r\nthe whole force of the British Government, Mr O'Brien was equally\r\nresolved that the arrogance of the new masters of the Irish democracy\r\nwas not going to compel him to a mood of easy yielding and he properly\r\ndecided to submit his arguments to a Convention which, though he was\r\nwell aware it would be \"packed\" against him, yet he had hopes might be\r\nswayed by the invincibility of his arguments. In the ordinary course\r\nthe stewards for managing and regulating the Convention would be drawn\r\nfrom Dublin Nationalists. On this occasion, however, they came by\r\nspecial train from Belfast and were marched in military order to the\r\nMansion House, where some sackfuls of policemen's brand-new batons\r\nwere distributed amongst them. They were the \"Special Constables\" of\r\nthe Molly Maguires recruited for the first time by an Irish\r\norganisation to kill the right of free speech for which Irishmen had\r\nbeen contending with their lives through the generations. It would be\r\nquite a comedy of Irish topsy-turvydom were it not, in fact, such a\r\ndisastrous tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe favourite cry of the enemies of Conciliation was that the Purchase\r\nAct would bankrupt the Irish ratepayers. By means which it is not\r\nnecessary to develop or inquire into, the British Treasury was induced\r\non the very eve of the Convention to present to a number of the Irish\r\nCounty Councils claims for thousands of pounds on foot of expenses for\r\nthe flotation of land loans. A base political trick of this kind is\r\ntoo contemptible for words. It, however, gave Mr Redmond one of the\r\nmain arguments for impressing the Convention that the Birrell Bill\r\ncould alone save the ratepayers from the imminence of this burden. It\r\nwould have been easy to demolish the contention had the reply been\r\nallowed to be made. But this was just the one thing \"the bosses\" were\r\ndetermined not to allow--Mr O'Brien had given notice of an amendment,\r\nthe justification of which is attested by the facts of the succeeding\r\ntwelve years. It expressed the view that the Birrell Land Bill would\r\nlead to the stoppage of land purchase, that it would impose an\r\nintolerable penalty upon the tenant purchasers whose purchase money\r\nthe Treasury had failed to provide, and that it would postpone for\r\nfifty years any complete solution of the problem of the West and of\r\nthe redistribution of the untenanted grass lands of the country. The\r\nmoment Mr O'Brien stood up to move this, at a concerted signal,\r\npandemonium was let loose. I was never the witness of a more\r\ndisgraceful incident--that an Irishman whose life had been given in\r\nso full and generous a fashion to the people should, by secret and\r\nsubsidised arrangement, be howled down by an imported gang and\r\nprevented from presenting his views in rational fashion to men the\r\nmajority of whom at least were present for honest consideration of\r\narguments. It is a thing not easily forgotten or forgiven for the\r\nIrishmen who engineered it, that such a ferocious and foolish display\r\nof truculent cowardice should have taken place. For an hour Mr O'Brien\r\nmanfully faced the obscene chorus of cat-cries and disorder. He\r\ndescribes one of the incidents that occurred in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"While I was endeavouring, by the aid of a fairly powerful voice, to\r\ndominate the air-splitting clamour around me, Mr Crean, M.P., on the\r\nsuggestion of Father Clancy, attempted to reach me, in order to urge\r\nme to give up the unequal struggle. He was no sooner on his legs than\r\nhe was pounced upon by a group of brawny Belfast Mollies and dragged\r\nback by main force, while Mr Devlin, with a face blazing with passion,\r\nrushed towards his colleague in the Irish Party, shouting to his\r\nlodgemen: 'Put the fellow out.' At the same time Father Clancy, Mr\r\nSheehan, M.P., and Mr Gilhooly, M.P., having interposed to remonstrate\r\nwith Mr Crean's assailants, found themselves in the midst of a\r\ndisgraceful mêlée of curses, blows and uplifted sticks, Mr Sheehan\r\nbeing violently struck in the face, and one of the Molly Maguire\r\nbatonmen swinging his baton over Mr Gilhooly's head to a favourite\r\nBelfast battle-cry: 'I'll slaughter you if you say another word.'\"\r\n\r\nSo does this Convention go down to history as the beginning of an\r\ninfamous period when the sanctity of free speech was a thing to be\r\nruthlessly smashed by the hireling or misguided mobs of an\r\norganisation professing democratic principles. The miracle of the\r\nEaster Rising was that it put an end to the rule of the thug and the\r\nbludgeonman. But many things were to happen in between.\r\n\r\nCertain police court proceedings followed, in which Mr Crean, M.P.,\r\nwas the plaintiff. The only comment on these that need now be made is\r\nthat Mr Crean's summons for assault was dismissed, and he was ordered\r\nto pay £150 costs or to go to gaol for two months, whilst the police\r\nmagistrate who tried the case was shortly afterwards rewarded with the\r\nChief Magistracy of Dublin!\r\n\r\nThe Board of Erin now began to march south of the Boyne and to usurp\r\nthe functions of the United Irish League wherever it got a footing. It\r\nwas frankly out for jobs, preferments and patronage of all kinds, so\r\nthat even the dirty crew of place-hunting lawyers which Dublin Castle\r\nhad plentifully spoon-fed for over a century became its leaders and\r\ngospellers, seeing that through it alone could they carve their way to\r\nthose goodly plums that maketh easy the path of the unctuous crawlers\r\nin life--the creed of the Mollies, and it gained them followers\r\ngalore, being that nobody who was not a member of \"the Ancient Order\"\r\nwas eligible for even the meanest public office in the gift of the\r\nGovernment or the elected of the people. Even a Crown Prosecutor, one\r\nof the Castle \"Cawtholic\" tribe whose record of life-long antipathy to\r\nthe vital creed of Irish Nationality was notorious, now became a pious\r\nfollower of the new Order and was in due course \"saved\" by receiving\r\nan exalted position in the judicial establishment of the country,\r\nwhich owed nothing to his honour or his honesty. Under the auspices of\r\nthe Board of Erin \"the shoneen\"--the most contemptible of all our\r\nIrish types--began to flourish amain. It was a great thing to be a\r\n\"Jay Pay\" in the Irish country-side. It added inches to one's girth\r\nand one's stature, and to the importance of one's \"lady.\" It was\r\ngreatly coveted by the thousands who always pine to swagger in a\r\nlittle brief authority, and thus the Board of Erin drew its adherents\r\nfrom every low fellow who had an interest to serve, a dirty ambition\r\nto satisfy, an office to gain or probably even a petty score to pay\r\noff. No doubt there were many sincere and honest and enthusiastic\r\nyoung men attracted to it by the charm of the secret sign and\r\npassword, and others who believed that its Catholic pomp and parade\r\nmade for the religious uplift of the people. But taken all in all, it\r\nwas unquestionably an evil influence in the lives of the people and it\r\ndegraded the fine inspiration of Nationality to a base sectarian\r\nscramble for place and power.\r\n\r\nGone were the glorious ideals of a nobler day wherever it pushed out\r\nits pernicious grip. Surrendered were the sterner principles which\r\ninstructed and enacted that the man who sought office or preferment\r\nfrom a British Minister unfitted himself as a standard-bearer or even\r\na raw recruit in the ranks of Irish Nationality. The Irish birth-right\r\nwas bartered for a mess of pottage and, worst of all, the fine\r\ninstincts of Ireland's glorious youth were being corrupted and\r\nperverted. The cry of \"Up the Mollies!\" became the watchword of the\r\nnew movement and the creed of selfishness and sectarianism supplanted\r\nthe evangel of self-denial and self-sacrifice. It was a time when\r\nclear-sighted and earnest men almost lost hope, if they did not lose\r\nfaith. To be held in subjection by the tyranny of a stronger power was\r\na calamity of destiny to be resisted, but that the people should\r\nthemselves bind the chains of a more sordid tyranny of selfishness\r\naround their spirits was wholly damnable and heart-breaking.\r\n\r\nIt was to fight this thing that Mr William O'Brien proposed yet\r\nanother crusade of light and liberty. As he founded the United Irish\r\nLeague when the country was sunk in the uttermost depths of despair\r\nand indifference, he now made a first gallant effort to establish a\r\nnew national organisation to preach a nobler creed of brotherhood and\r\nreconciliation among all Irishmen, and to this he gave the appropriate\r\ntitle of the All-for-Ireland League. The city and county of Cork\r\nrallied to his side, with all the old-time fervour of Rebel Cork. The\r\ninaugural meeting of the League was held in my native town, Kanturk,\r\nand was splendidly attended by as gallant a body of Irishmen as could\r\nbe found in all Ireland--men who knew, as none others better, how to\r\nfight, when fighting was the right policy, but who knew also, in its\r\nproper season, when it was good to make peace. The Press, however,\r\nshut its pages to the new movement and a complaisant Irish Party, now\r\nutterly at the mercy of the Board of Erin, at a meeting specially\r\nsummoned for the purpose, passed a resolution of excommunication\r\nagainst the new League and against every Member of Parliament who\r\nshould venture upon its platform, on the ground that it was usurping\r\nthe functions and authority of the United Irish League, which was now\r\nnothing more than a cloak for the operations of the Board of Erin.\r\n\r\nNo human being could struggle under the mountain weight of\r\nresponsibility that now rested on the shoulders of Mr O'Brien. Wearied\r\nby the monstrous labours and fights of many years, deserted by his own\r\ncolleague in the representation of Cork City, with the Nationalist\r\nPress engaged in a policy of suppression and a system of secret\r\nintimidation springing up all over the country, it would have been\r\nmadness for him to attempt to continue.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he decided to quit the field again and to leave the clever\r\npolitical manipulators in possession. After he had sent in his\r\napplication for the Chiltern Hundreds I came across specially from\r\nIreland to meet him at the Westminster Palace Hotel. It were meet not\r\nto dwell upon our interview, for there are some things too sacred for\r\nwords. I know that he had then no intention of ever returning to\r\npublic life, and though he was obviously a man very, very ill, in the\r\nphysical sense, yet I could see it was the deeper wounds of the soul\r\nthat really mattered.\r\n\r\nI have had sorrows in my life and deep afflictions, the scars of which\r\nnothing on this earth can cure, yet I can say I never felt parting so\r\npoignantly as with this friend, whom I loved most and venerated most\r\non earth. I returned to Ireland that night, not knowing whether I\r\nshould ever see the well-beloved face again. He went to Italy on the\r\nmorrow to seek peace and healing, away from the land to which he had\r\ngiven more than a life's labour and devotion. He enjoined his friends\r\nnot to communicate with him, but he promised to watch from a distance,\r\nand that if the occasion ever arose he would not see them cast to\r\ndestruction without effort of his duty made.\r\n\r\nHow well and generously he kept that promise these pages will show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                    A CAMPAIGN OF EXTERMINATION AND ITS\r\n                                CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nMr O'Brien went abroad in March 1909, leaving his friends in\r\nmembership of the Irish Party. His last injunction to us was that we\r\nshould do nothing unnecessarily to draw down the wrath of \"the bosses\"\r\nupon us and to work as well as we might in the circumstances\r\nconscientiously for the Irish cause. I had some reputation, whether\r\ndeserved or otherwise, as a successful organiser, and I wrote to Mr\r\nRedmond offering my services to re-establish the United Irish League\r\nin my own constituency or in any other place where it was practically\r\nmoribund. I received a formal note of acknowledgment and heard not a\r\nword more, nor was my offer ever availed of. On the contrary, the fiat\r\nwent forth that the constituencies of those who had for five years\r\nremained staunch and steadfast to the policy of Conciliation should be\r\norganised against them and that not a friend of Mr O'Brien should be\r\nallowed to remain in public life. We were not yet actually cut off\r\nfrom the Party or its financial perquisites, but in all other ways we\r\nwere treated as political pariahs and outcasts and made to feel that\r\nthere was a rod in pickle for us.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1909 I was attending my law lectures in Dublin when\r\nit was conveyed to me that a raid on my constituency was contemplated,\r\nthat the officials at the League headquarters in Dublin were, without\r\nrhyme or reason, returning the affiliation fees of branches which were\r\nknown to be friendly to me, and that a Divisional Conference of my\r\nenemies was summoned for the purpose of \"organising\" me out of\r\nMid-Cork. I immediately resolved that if the issue were to be knit at\r\nall the sooner the better, and I took my own steps to circumvent the\r\nmachinations of those who were out, so to speak, for my blood. Hence\r\nwhen the bogus delegates were brought together in Macroom one Saturday\r\nafternoon a little surprise awaited them, for as they proceeded to the\r\nTown Hall to deliberate their plans for my overthrow, another and a\r\nmore determined militant body, with myself at their head, also marched\r\non the same venue. There was a short and sharp encounter for\r\npossession of the hall: the plotters put up a sorry fight; they were\r\nsoon routed, and my friends and myself held our meeting on the chosen\r\nground of our opponents. Moreover, Mr Denis Johnston, the Chief\r\nOrganiser of the League, who had come down from Dublin with all his\r\nplans for my extermination cut and dried, dared not take the train\r\nthat evening in the ordinary course from the Macroom station, but,\r\nlike a thief in the night, stole out of the town in a covered car and\r\ndrove to a station farther on.\r\n\r\nThus began the foul attempt to exterminate Mr O'Brien's friends, who,\r\nbe it noted, were still members of the Irish Party, against whom no\r\ncrime was alleged or any charge of Party disloyalty preferred. The\r\nfunds of the League, its organisers and its executive machinery,\r\ninstead of being used for the advancement of the Irish movement along\r\nconstitutional lines, were brutally directed to the political\r\nexecution of Mr O'Brien's friends, who, now that he had gone for good,\r\nand was reported to be in that state of physical breakdown which would\r\nprevent him from ever again taking an active part in Irish affairs,\r\nwere supposed to be at the mercy of the big \"pots\" and their big\r\nbattalions.\r\n\r\nMr Maurice Healy, who had been elected for Cork City by an\r\noverwhelming majority over the nominee of \"the leaders\" after Mr\r\nO'Brien's retirement, was unconstitutionally and improperly refused\r\nadmission to the Party, although he was quite prepared to sign the\r\npledge to sit, act, and vote with it. There was scarcely a thing wrong\r\nthey could do which these blind leaders of the blind did not clumsily\r\nattempt at this juncture. They might have shown us, whose only crime\r\nwas loyalty to principle and to a policy which had been signally\r\nratified by the repeated mandates of the people, a reasonable measure\r\nof generosity and a frank fellowship and all would be well.\r\n\r\nBut no; we had committed the cardinal offence of preferring a policy\r\nto a personality and, in famous phrase, we were marked down to \"suffer\r\nfor it.\" Hordes of organisers were dispatched to our constituencies to\r\n\"pull the strings\" against us. I can aver, with a certain malicious\r\nsatisfaction, that wherever they made their appearance in Cork, we met\r\nthem and we routed them. This may appear an ill way to conduct a\r\npolitical campaign, but be it remembered that we were fighting for our\r\nlives, almost resourceless, and that the aggressors had practically\r\nlimitless powers, financially and otherwise. I will mention one\r\nincident to explain many. It was announced that Mr Redmond was to\r\nspeak at Banteer, on the borders of my constituency. I could not allow\r\nthat challenge to pass unnoticed without surrendering ground which it\r\nwould be impossible to recover; and so I took the earliest opportunity\r\nof proclaiming that if Mr Redmond came to Banteer my friends and I\r\nwould be there to meet him. He never came! Meanwhile through a private\r\nsource--for none of his colleagues were in communication with him--Mr\r\nO'Brien heard of the nefarious attempts that were being made to\r\nexterminate his friends and he broke silence for the first time since\r\nhis retirement by despatching the following message to the Press\r\nAssociation:--\r\n\r\n\"If these people are wise they will drop their campaign of vengeance\r\nagainst my friends.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless \"these people\" thought this the threat of a man helpless\r\nthrough illness, and not to be seriously noticed, for they went on\r\nwith their preparations, surreptitious and otherwise, for our\r\ndestruction, in suitable time and form. I will ever remember it with\r\npride and gratitude that the labourers of the south, the President of\r\nwhose Association I was, were gloriously staunch and loyal and that\r\nthere never was a demand I made upon them for support and\r\nencouragement they did not magnificently respond to. They gave\r\nrepayment, in full measure and flowing over, for whatever little I was\r\nable to accomplish in my lifetime for the alleviation of their lot and\r\nthe brightening of their lives.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Party had matters all their own way, yet their only\r\n\"great\" achievement was to get the Birrell Land Bill passed into law\r\nand to put an end to the operations of the Purchase Act of 1903 which\r\nwas so rapidly transforming the face of the country. They also passed\r\nfor Mr Lloyd George what Mr Dillon termed \"the great and good\" Budget,\r\nbut which really added enormously to the direct taxation of\r\nIreland--imposing an additional burden of something not far from three\r\nmillions sterling on the backs of an already overtaxed country. But if\r\nthe people were plundered the place-hunters were placated. The Irish\r\nParty had now become little better than an annexe of Liberalism. They\r\nsat in Opposition because it was the tradition to do so, but in\r\nreality they were the obsequious followers of a British Party and\r\nbrowsing on its pasturage in the hope of better things to come.\r\n\r\nNot far off were heard the rumblings of an approaching General\r\nElection. There were the usual flutterings of the \"ins\" who wanted to\r\nremain in, and of the \"outs\" who were anxious to taste the social\r\nsweets and the personal pomp of the successful politician, who had got\r\nthe magic letters \"M.P.\" to his name. It is wonderful what an appeal\r\nit makes to the man who has made his \"pile\" somehow or anyhow (or who\r\nwants to make it) to have the right to enter the sacred portals of\r\nWestminster, but it is more wonderful still to see him when he gets\r\nthere become the mere puppet of the Party Whips, without an atom of\r\nindividual independence or a grain of useful initiative. The system\r\nabsorbs them and they become cogs in a machine, whose movements they\r\nhave little power of controlling or directing.\r\n\r\nIt was pretended by the leaders of the Nationalists that their\r\nsubservient surrender to the Liberal Party was a far-sighted move to\r\ncompel Mr Asquith and his friends to make Home Rule \"the dominant\r\nissue,\" as they termed it, at the General Election. The veto of the\r\nHouse of Lords, the hitherto one intractable element of opposition to\r\nHome Rule, was to go before long and the House of Commons, within\r\ncertain limits, would be in a position to impose its will as the\r\nsovereign authority in the State. Yet it is the scarcely believable\r\nfact that in all these precious months, and after all the servile\r\nsycophancy they had given to the Liberals, neither Mr Redmond nor\r\nthose true-blue Liberals, Mr Dillon and Mr O'Connor, had ever sought\r\nto extract from Mr Asquith an irrefragable statement of his intentions\r\nregarding the Irish Question, or whether he and his Government\r\nintended to make it a prime plank in the Liberal platform at the\r\npolls. The rejection of the Budget by the Lords was made the real\r\nissue before the electors, and little was heard of Home Rule, either\r\non the platform or in the Press. True, Mr Asquith made a vague and\r\nnon-committal reference to it at the Albert Hall on the eve of the\r\nelection, but the Liberal candidates, with extraordinary unanimity,\r\nfought shy of it in every constituency, except where there was a\r\nconsiderable Irish vote to be played up to, and one of the Liberal\r\nParty Whips even went so far as to declare there was no Home Rule\r\nengagement at all. Far different was it in other days, when Parnell\r\nwas in power. He would have pinned the Party to whom he was giving his\r\nsupport down to a written compact, which could not be broken without\r\ndishonour, and he would leave nothing to the mere emergencies and\r\nexpediencies of politics, which are only the gambler's dice in a\r\ndevil's game.\r\n\r\nBut the men of lesser calibre who had now the destiny of a nation in\r\ntheir hands \"trusted\" in the good faith of the Liberals and in return\r\nasked the country to \"trust\" them. There never was such a puckish game\r\nplayed in history. Criticism was stifled and the people were told, and\r\nno doubt in their innocence believed it, that Home Rule was already as\r\ngood as carried and that the dream of all the years was come true. Mr\r\nDillon was audaciously flying the flag of \"Boer Home Rule as a\r\nminimum,\" although he had not a scrap of authority or a line of\r\nsanction for his pronouncements.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if every friend of Mr O'Brien was to go under in the\r\ncampaign of opposition that was being elaborately carried out against\r\nthem. Our constituencies were swarming with paid organisers and men\r\nand money galore were pouring in from outside, so that our downfall\r\nand defeat should be made an absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nIt was in this crisis that the generous spirit of Mr O'Brien impelled\r\nhim to come to our assistance. For my own part I never had a doubt\r\nthat when the hour struck the champion of so many noble causes would\r\nbe found once again stoutly defending the men who had staked all for\r\nthe sake of principle, but who, without his aid, must be mercilessly\r\nthrown to the wolves. We were in a most benighted state, without any\r\ntrace of organisation of our own (except that I had the Land and\r\nLabour Association unflinchingly on my side), without any newspaper to\r\nreport our speeches, and with only the bravest of the brave to come\r\nupon our platforms and say a good word for us. The outlook was as\r\nbleak as it well could be, when suddenly, towards the end of December\r\n1909, the joyous news reached us that \"the hero of a hundred fights\"\r\nwas about to throw himself into the breach on our behalf. Our enemies\r\nlaughed the rumour to scorn, but we knew better and we bided in\r\npatience the coming of our man.\r\n\r\nOne stipulation, indeed, Mr O'Brien did make, that in coming to our\r\nassistance it was not implied that he was to be a candidate himself\r\nand that he was merely to deliver three speeches in Cork City to put\r\nthe issue clearly before the people. Matters had now reached so grave\r\na pitch that not only were Mr O'Brien's own friends to be attacked by\r\nthe \"Board of Erin,\" which was now in complete control of the\r\nmachinery of the national organisation, but that every other Member of\r\nParliament who had not bent the knee to its occult omnipotence was to\r\nbe run out of public life without cause assigned. All this while there\r\nwas rumour and counter-rumour about Mr O'Brien's return. The\r\nDillonites up to the last moment believed we were playing a game of\r\nbluff and went on right merrily with their preparations for making a\r\nclean sweep of every man who was \"suspect\" of possessing an\r\nindependent mind. Then on one winter's night, shortly before the\r\nelection writs were issued, the doubters and the scoffers were once\r\nand for all confounded. Mr O'Brien arrived in the city which was\r\nalways proud to do him honour, but which never more proudly did him\r\nhonour than on this occasion, when they mustered in their thousands at\r\nthe station and lined the streets, a frantic, cheering, enthusiastic\r\nand madly joyous people, to see him back amongst them once again,\r\nneither bent nor broken nor physically spent, but gloriously erect,\r\nacknowledging the thunderous salutations of the tens of thousands who\r\nloved him, even to the little children, with a love which was surely\r\ncompensation for many a bitter wound of injustice and ingratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n          A GENERAL ELECTION THAT LEADS TO A \"HOME RULE\" BILL!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt boots not to dwell at any great length on the contests that\r\nfollowed. Suffice it to say that Irish manhood and Irish honesty\r\nmagnificently asserted itself against the audacious and unscrupulous\r\ntactics of the Party plotters. Mr O'Brien, by a destiny there was no\r\nresisting, was forced into the fight in Cork City and emerged\r\nvictoriously from the ordeal, as well as winning also in North-East\r\nCork. In my own case, except for the splendid and most generous\r\nassistance given me by Mr Jeremiah O'Leary, the leading citizen of\r\nMacroom, who shared all the labours and all the anxieties of my\r\ncampaign, I was left to fight my battle almost single-handed, having\r\narrayed against me two canons of my Church and every Catholic\r\nclergyman in the constituency, with two or three notable exceptions.\r\nThe odds seemed hopeless, but the result provides the all-sufficient\r\nanswer to those who say that the Irish Catholic vote can be controlled\r\nunder all circumstances by the priests, for I scored a surprising\r\nmajority of 825 in a total poll of about 4500, and I have good reason\r\nfor stating that 95 per cent. of the illiterate votes were cast in my\r\nfavour, although a most powerful personal canvass was made of every\r\nvote in the constituency by the clergy.\r\n\r\nI consider this incident worthy of special emphasis in view of the\r\nignorant and malicious statements of English and Unionist publicists,\r\nwho make it a stock argument against the grant of independence to\r\nIreland that the Catholics will vote as they are bidden by their\r\npriests. I have sufficient experience and knowledge of my countrymen\r\nto say that whilst in troublous times the Irish soggarths were the\r\nnatural leaders and protectors of their flocks, even to the peril of\r\ntheir lives, yet in these times, when other conditions prevail, whilst\r\nin religion remaining staunchly loyal to their faith and its teachers,\r\nwhen it comes to a question of political principle there is no man in\r\nall the world who can be so independently self-assertive as the Irish\r\nCatholic. There is nothing to fear for Ireland, either now or in the\r\nfuture, from what I may term clericalism in politics, whilst on the\r\nother hand it is earnestly to be hoped that nothing will ever happen\r\nto intrude unnecessarily the question or authority of religion in the\r\ndomain of more mundane affairs.\r\n\r\nMr O'Brien sums up the result of the General Election briefly thus:\r\n\r\n\"When the smoke of battle cleared away, nevertheless, every friend of\r\nmine, against whom this pitiless cannonade of vengeance had been\r\ndirected, stood victorious on the field, and it was the conspirators\r\nwho a few weeks before deemed themselves unshakable in the mastery of\r\nIreland who, to their almost comic bewilderment and dismay, found\r\nthemselves and their boasts rolled in the dust. Not only did every man\r\nfor whose destruction they had thrown all prudence to the winds find\r\nhis way back to Parliament in their despite, but in at least eighteen\r\nother constituencies their plots to replace members under any\r\nsuspicion of independence with reliables absolutely amenable to the\r\nsigns and passwords of the Order resulted in their being blown\r\nsky-high with their own petards.... Messrs Dillon and Devlin led their\r\ndemoralised forces back, seventy in place of eighty-three, and for the\r\nfirst time since 1885 they went back a minority of the Nationalist\r\nvotes actually cast as between the policy of Conciliation and the\r\npolicy of _Væ Victis_.\"\r\n\r\nMr O'Brien had established a campaign sheet during the election called\r\n_The Cork Accent_ (as a sort of reminder of the \"Baton\"\r\nConvention, at which the order was given that no one with a \"Cork\r\naccent\" should be allowed near the platform), and surely never did\r\npaper render more brilliant service in an exceptional emergency. It\r\nwas his intention that his attitude in the new Parliament should be\r\none of \"patient observation\" and of steady but unaggressive allegiance\r\nto the principles of national reconciliation. But such a rôle was\r\nrendered impossible by the active hostility of Mr Dillon and his\r\nfollowers. The doors of the Party were shut and banged against every\r\nman who was independently elected by the voters. It was proclaimed\r\nthat we would be helpless in the country without organisation or\r\nnewspaper to support us and that we would be left even without the\r\nmeans of travelling to London to represent our constituents.\r\n\r\nWe could not sit inactively under this decree of annihilation. It was\r\ndecided to continue _The Cork Accent_ in a permanent form as a\r\ndaily journal under the title of _The Cork Free Press_, which was\r\nfounded at a public meeting presided over by the Lord Mayor. The\r\nAll-for-Ireland League was also established to advocate and expound\r\nthe principles for which we stood in Irish life. Its purposes are\r\nclearly stated in the resolution which gave it birth--viz.:\r\n\r\n\"That inasmuch as we regard self-Government in purely Irish affairs,\r\nthe transfer of the soil to the cultivators upon just terms, and the\r\nrelief of Ireland from intolerable over-taxation as essential\r\nconditions of happiness and prosperity for our country, and further\r\ninasmuch as we believe the surest means of effecting these objects to\r\nbe a combination of all the elements of the Irish population in a\r\nspirit of mutual tolerance and patriotic good will, such as will\r\nguarantee to the Protestant minority of our fellow-countrymen\r\ninviolable security for all their rights and liberties and win the\r\nfriendship of the entire people of Great Britain, this representative\r\nmeeting of the City and County of Cork hereby establishes an\r\nAssociation to be called the All-for-Ireland League, whose primary\r\nobject shall be the union and active co-operation in every department\r\nof our national life of all Irish men and women who believe in the\r\nprinciple of domestic self-government for Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe All-for-Ireland League made memorable progress in a brief space of\r\ntime. Mr O'Brien's return to public life was hailed even by the late\r\nW.T. Stead in _The Westminster Gazette_ as nothing short of a\r\ngreat political resurrection. The noble appeal of the League's\r\nprogramme to the chivalrous instincts of the race attracted the young\r\nmen to its side with an enthusiasm amounting to an inspiration. The\r\nProtestant minority in Southern Ireland were being gradually won over\r\nto a genuine confidence in our motives and generous intentions to\r\nsafeguard fully their interests and position and to secure them an\r\nadequate part in the future government of our common country. Even the\r\ngreat British parties began to see in the new movement hopes of that\r\npeace and reconciliation between Great Britain and Ireland which must\r\nbe the hope of all just and broad-minded statesmanship.\r\n\r\nIt was in these circumstances that the Party surrendered \"at discretion\"\r\nto the expediencies of Liberalism, abjectly waiving their position as an\r\nindependent entity in Parliament, with no shadow of the pride and spirit\r\nof the Parnell period left, seeming to exist for the favours and bonuses\r\nthat came their way, and for the rest playing to the gallery in Ireland\r\nby telling them that Home Rule was coming \"at no far distant date,\" and\r\nthat they had only to trust to Asquith and all would be well. Never had\r\na Party such a combination of favourable circumstances to command\r\nsuccess. They possessed a strategical advantage such as Parnell would\r\nhave given his life for--they held the balance of power and they could\r\norder the Government to do their bidding or quit. Yet instead of\r\nregarding themselves as the ambassadors of a nation claiming its liberty\r\nthey seemed to be obsessed with a criminal selfishness passing all\r\npossible belief. When it was proposed to make Members of Parliament\r\nstipendiaries of the State, they at first protested vehemently against\r\nthe application of this principle to the Irish representatives, and\r\ntherein they were right. From a purely democratic standpoint no\r\nreasonable objection can be urged against the payment of those who give\r\ntheir time and talent to the public service, but Ireland was in\r\ndifferent case. Her representatives were at Westminster unwillingly,\r\nnot to assist in the government of the Empire with gracious intent, but\r\nrather definitely to obstruct, impede and hamper this government until\r\nIreland's inalienable right to self-government was conceded, and\r\ntherefore it was their clear duty to say that they would accept payment\r\nonly from the country and the people they served and that they cast back\r\nthis Treasury bribe in the teeth of those who offered it. But having\r\nostentatiously resolved that they would never accept a Parliamentary\r\nstipend, they finally allowed their virtuous resistance to temptation to\r\nbe overcome and voted for \"payment of members,\" which, without their\r\nvotes, would never have been adopted by the House of Commons. There were\r\nplacemen now in Parliament, and place-hunting was no longer a pastime to\r\nbe proscribed amongst Nationalists. It may be there was no wilful\r\ncorruption in thus accepting from the common purse of the United Kingdom\r\npayment which was made to all Members of Parliament alike, but it\r\ndeprived the Irish people of control of their representatives and handed\r\nthem over to the control of the English Treasury, and thus opened the\r\nway to the downfall of Parliamentarianism in Ireland that rapidly set\r\nin. Abandoned all too lightly was the rigid principle that to accept\r\nfavours from England was to betray Ireland, and the pursuit of place and\r\npatronage was esteemed as not being inconsistent with a pure patriotism.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as if to cap the climax of their imbecilities and\r\nblunders, the Irish Party allowed the first precious year of their\r\nmastery of Parliament to be devoted to the passage of an Insurance Act\r\nwhich nobody in Ireland outside the job-seekers wanted, which every\r\nindependent voice in the country, including a unanimous Bench of\r\nBishops, protested against, and whose only recommendation was that it\r\nprovided a regular deluge of well-paid positions for the votaries of\r\nthe secret sectarian society that had the country in its vicious grip.\r\nSuch a debauch of sham Nationalism as now ensued was never paralleled\r\nin the worst period of Ireland's history, and that this should be done\r\nin the name of patriotism was not its least degrading feature. Nemesis\r\ncould not fail to overtake this conscious sin against the national\r\nideal. It met with its own condign punishment before many years were\r\nover. To show the veritable depths of baseness to which the so-called\r\nNational Movement had fallen it need only be stated that it was\r\ncharged against their official organ--_The Freeman's Journal\r\n_--that no less than eighteen members of its staff had obtained\r\npositions of profit under the Crown, including a Lord Chancellorship,\r\nan Under-secretaryship, Judgeships, Crown Prosecutorships, University\r\nProfessorships, Resident Magistracies, Local Government\r\nInspectorships, etc. In this connection it is also worthy of mention\r\nthat when the premises of this concern were burnt out in the course of\r\nthe Easter Week Rebellion it was reendowed for \"national\" purposes,\r\nwith a Treasury grant of £60,000, being twice the amount which the\r\nthen directors of the _Freeman_ confessed to be the business\r\nvalue of the property.\r\n\r\nThus did the \"Board of Erin\" attract to its side all the most selfish\r\nand disreputable elements in Irish Catholic life, and thus also did it\r\nrepel and disgust the more broad-minded and tolerant Protestant\r\npatriots whom the All-for-Ireland programme, under happier\r\ncircumstances, would have undoubtedly won over to the side of Home\r\nRule. Much might even yet be forgiven to the men who had the destiny\r\nof Ireland in their hands if they had shown any striking capacity to\r\nexact a measure of self-government sufficiently big and broad to\r\njustify the national demand as then understood. But they showed\r\nneither strength nor wisdom, neither courage nor sagacity in their\r\ndealings with the English Liberal leaders and old Parliamentary hands\r\nagainst whom they were pitted. They were hopelessly out-manoeuvred and\r\novermatched at every stage of the game. It is but just to state that\r\nthe members of the Party as a whole had scarcely an atom of\r\nresponsibility for these miserable failures and defects of policy.\r\nThey owed their election to \"the machine.\" They were the complaisant\r\nbondsmen of the secret Order. Whatever they felt they dared not utter\r\na word which would bring the wrath of \"the Bosses\" upon their heads.\r\nThey were never candidly consulted as to tactics or strategy, or even\r\nfirst principles.\r\n\r\nThe decisions of the little ring of three or four who dominated the\r\nsituation within the Party were sometimes, it may be, submitted to\r\nthem for their formal approval, but more often than otherwise this\r\nshow of formal courtesy was not shown them. The position of Mr Redmond\r\nwas most humiliating of all. He did not lack many of the qualities\r\nwhich might have made for greatness in leadership, but he did\r\nundoubtedly lack the quality of backbone and that strength of\r\ncharacter to assert himself and to maintain his own position without\r\nwhich no man can be truly considered great. Whenever it came to an\r\nissue between them it is well known he had to submit his judgment and\r\nto bend his will to the decision of the three others--Messrs Dillon,\r\nDevlin and T.P. O'Connor--who must historically be held responsible\r\nfor the mistakes and weaknesses and horrible blunders of those years,\r\nwhich no self-respecting Irishman of the future can ever look back\r\nupon without a shudder of horror.\r\n\r\nThe Home Rule Bill, which was the product of those shameful years of\r\ndebility and disgrace, was so poor and paltry a thing as to be almost\r\nan insult to Irish patriotism and intelligence. It proposed to\r\nestablish merely a nominal Parliament in Dublin. It was financially\r\nunsound, besides being a denial of Ireland's right to fix and levy her\r\nown taxes. As a matter of fact, the power of taxation was rigorously\r\nmaintained at Westminster with a reduced Irish representation of\r\ntwo-thirds. And this was the measure which was proclaimed to be\r\ngreater than Grattan's Parliament or than any of the previous Home\r\nRule Bills! Furthermore, it made no provision for the completion of\r\nland purchase, but Mr Asquith was not really to be blamed for this, as\r\nMr Dillon proclaimed that one of the great attractions of the Bill was\r\nthat it would leave the remnant of the landlords to be dealt with by\r\nhim and his obedient henchmen. Finally, neither the Liberal Party nor\r\ntheir faithful Irish supporters would hear of any concessions to\r\nUlster.\r\n\r\nThese people were now so arrogant in the fancied security and strength\r\nof their position to do just as they pleased that Mr Redmond rashly\r\nundertook \"to put down Ulster with the strong hand\" and rather\r\nprematurely declared: \"There is no longer an Ulster difficulty.\" One\r\nfurther financial infamy the Bill perpetrated. The twenty millions\r\nsterling which were, under the Land Purchase Act of 1903, to have been\r\na free Imperial grant to lubricate the wheels of agrarian settlement,\r\nwas henceforth and by a \"Home Rule Government\" to be audaciously\r\ncharged as a debt against Ireland. And this, be it noted, was part of\r\nthe pact come to with the \"Nationalist\" leaders at the Downing Street\r\nbreakfast-table, where Ireland's fate was sealed, and which they\r\njoyously supported in the House of Commons against such opposition as\r\nthe All-for-Ireland minority was allowed to give it by the ruthless\r\napplication of the guillotine.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Nationalist members were willing to make the best of a\r\nvery \"bad bargain,\" if only they could succeed in getting adopted\r\nthree amendments which they regarded as vital to the success of the\r\nmeasure: (1) A new financial plan; (2) the completion of land\r\npurchase, and (3) such concessions as would win the consent of Ulster.\r\nBut our reward for thus endeavouring to make the Bill adaptable to\r\nIrish requirements and acceptable to the whole of Ireland was to be\r\ndubbed \"factionists\" and \"traitors\" by the official Irish Party, who\r\nnever once during three years' debates in Parliament made the\r\nslightest attempt to amend or improve the Bill, but who remained\r\nsilent and impotent as graven images on the Irish benches whilst the\r\nway was being paved for all the ruin and desolation and accumulated\r\nhorrors that have since come to Ireland through their compliant and\r\ncriminal imbecility.\r\n\r\nThey had a perfect Parliamentary unity; they certainly seemed to have\r\nthe most perfect understanding with their Liberal friends, but they\r\nhad no more claim to represent an independent, vigilant,\r\nself-respecting nation than they had to represent, say, \"Morocco\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                     THE RISE OF SIR EDWARD CARSON\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The question I put to myself is this: In the years of failure, where\r\nhave we gone wrong? What are the mistakes we have made? What has been\r\nthe root cause of our failure? The Lord Chancellor was perfectly frank\r\nso far as the Unionists were concerned. He said, indeed, that he was\r\nstill a Unionist, but he had come to the conclusion that the\r\nmaintenance of the Union was impossible. What lesson have we who have\r\nbeen Home Rulers to draw from the past? I think the mistake we made in\r\nthe beginning was that we did not sufficiently realise the absolute\r\nnecessity of taking into consideration the feeling of Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nThese notable words were spoken by Viscount Grey of Falloden in the\r\ndebate in the House of Lords on the Partition Bill on 24th November\r\n1920. A more remarkable vindication of All-for-Ireland principles and\r\na more utter condemnation of the egregious folly of our opponents it\r\nis not possible to imagine, coming especially from so clear and\r\ncalm-minded a statesman as the former Liberal Foreign Secretary. The\r\nroot principles upon which Mr O'Brien and his friends proceeded from\r\nthe start were that success was to be had by making an Irish\r\nsettlement depend, in the first place, upon the co-operation of a\r\nmillion of our Protestant countrymen, and next by enlisting the\r\nco-operation of both British parties, instead of making the Irish\r\nQuestion the exclusive possession of one English Party. These two\r\nprinciples are now universally acknowledged to be the wise ones, yet\r\nwhen we were urging them in the Home Rule debates we could find no\r\nsupport from the Liberal-Irish cohorts, and although we sedulously\r\ndevoted ourselves to urging a non-party programme and the conciliation\r\nof the Protestant minority--about which all parties are now agreed--we\r\nonly received vilification and calumny for our portion.\r\n\r\nGreat play is being made by distinguished converts within the past few\r\nyears of Dominion Rule as if they were the discoverers of this blessed\r\npanacea for Ireland's ills, but it is proper to recall that the\r\nAll-for-Ireland Party specifically proposed Dominion Home Rule in a\r\nletter to Mr Asquith in 1911 as the wisest of all solutions. Scant\r\nattention was paid to our recommendation then and it is not even\r\nremembered for us by the protagonists of a later time. In all our\r\nefforts to conciliate Ulster and to allay the alarms it undoubtedly\r\nfelt owing to the growth and aggressiveness of the Catholic Order of\r\nOrangeism, we never received encouragement or support from the\r\nGovernment or the Irish Party. On the contrary, they denounced as\r\ntreason to Ireland the proposal made by us that for an experimental\r\nterm of five years the Ulster Party, which would remain in the\r\nImperial Parliament, should have the right of appeal as against any\r\nIrish Bill of which they did not approve, the decision to be given\r\nwithin one month. This, we held, would have been a more effectual\r\nsafeguard than any proposed since to satisfy Irish Unionists that\r\nlegislative oppression would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nOther proposals of a representation in the Irish Parliament\r\nproportioned to their numbers and of guarantees against the\r\nestablishment of any Tammany system of spoils in favour of the secret\r\nsectarian association were also submitted. But all our overtures for a\r\npeace based on reasonable concessions were repudiated by the official\r\nParty and contemptuously rejected by them and we were held up to\r\npublic obloquy as proposing to subject Ireland to the veto of fourteen\r\nOrangemen.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the opposition to Home Rule, curiously enough\r\nSir Edward Carson did not count as a figure of any particular power or\r\nmalignancy. True, he had his early period of notoriety in Ireland when\r\nhe acted as a Crown Prosecutor under the Crimes Act. But when he\r\ntransferred his legal and political ambition to England it is alleged\r\nthat he was for a season a member of the National Liberal Club and was\r\nthus entitled to be ranked as a Liberal in politics. Whether through\r\nconviction or otherwise, his allegiance appears to have been promptly\r\nand permanently transferred to the Unionist Party, but even then he\r\nwas in no sense regarded as an Ulster Member--he is himself a Southern\r\nIrishman by birth--and in the House of Commons comported himself as a\r\ngood Unionist, holding office as such. It was only when the Irish\r\nParty set their faces sternly against any concessions to Ulster that\r\nSir Edward Carson stepped into the breach and came to the front as the\r\nduly elected leader of the Ulster Party. It is the sheerest nonsense\r\nand pure ignorance of the facts to say that Sir Edward Carson created\r\nthe Ulster difficulty. It was created by the statesmen and politicians\r\nwho, in the words of Viscount Grey, \"did not sufficiently realise the\r\nabsolute necessity of taking into consideration the feeling of\r\nUlster.\" When the full history of this period is written, and when\r\ndocuments at present confidential are available, I believe it will be\r\nshown that if the concessions and safeguards suggested by the\r\nAll-for-Ireland Party had been offered by the Government or the Irish\r\nParty in the earlier stages of the Home Rule controversy they would\r\nhave been, in the main, acceptable to Ulster Unionist opinion. I well\r\nremember Mr (now Mr Justice) Moore declaring, from his place on the\r\nUlster benches:\r\n\r\n\"My friends and myself have always marvelled at the fatuity of the\r\nIrish Party in throwing over the member for the City of Cork (Mr\r\nWilliam O'Brien) when he had all the cards in his hands.\"\r\n\r\nWhere we preached all reasonable concession and conciliation our\r\nopponents proclaimed that Ulster must submit itself unconditionally to\r\nthe law and that it must content itself in the knowledge that\r\n\"minorities must suffer.\" And all this while the Board of Erin\r\nHibernians were consolidating their position as the ascendant\r\nauthority in Irish life, from whom the Protestant minority might not,\r\nwithout some reason, in looking back on their own bad past, expect\r\nthat it would be taken out of them when the Catholics got into power.\r\nThus in very real fear and terror of their disabilities under an Irish\r\nParliament, which would be elected and dominated by a secret sectarian\r\norganisation, they entered into the famous Ulster Covenant and\r\nsolemnly swore to resist Home Rule and to raise a Volunteer Army for\r\nthe purpose of giving force and effect to their resistance. The visit\r\nof Mr Winston Churchill to Belfast early in 1912 to address a\r\nNationalist meeting there was an aggravation of the situation and\r\nthere was a time during his progress through the city when his motor\r\ncar was in imminent danger of being upset and when it was surrounded\r\nby a howling and enraged mob of Orangemen, who shouted the fiercest\r\ncurses and threats at him. As a result of this experience Mr Churchill\r\nwas never afterwards a very enthusiastic supporter of what came to be\r\ncalled \"the coercion of Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr Churchill's most ill-advised visit, from the point of\r\nview of political tactics, was just the thing required to raise all\r\nthe worst elements of Orangeism and to give its best fillip to the\r\nsigning of the Covenant, which proceeded apace, not only in Ulster,\r\nbut in Great Britain, even to the extent that the army was said to be\r\nhoney-combed with sworn Covenanters, contrary to all the rules and\r\ndoctrines of military law and discipline. And in due course, in reply\r\nto the challenge of Mr Churchill's visit the leader of the Unionist\r\nParty, Mr Bonar Law, visited Balmoral, near Belfast, and reviewed from\r\n80,000 to 100,000 Ulster Volunteers, who marched past him in military\r\norder, and saluted. Sir Edward Carson made the meeting repeat after\r\nhim the pledge: \"We will never in any circumstances submit to Home\r\nRule.\"\r\n\r\nThe Unionist Party was now solidly and assertively on the side of\r\nUlster in its opposition to Home Rule. They held a demonstration at\r\nBlenheim on 27th July 1912, when some three thousand delegates from\r\npolitical associations, invited by the Duke of Marlborough, were\r\npresent. Mr Bonar Law described the Liberal Ministry as a\r\nrevolutionary committee which had seized by fraud on despotic power,\r\nand declared that the Unionist Party would use whatever means seemed\r\nlikely to be most effective. He made the declaration that Ireland was\r\ntwo nations, a theory which, strangely enough, Mr Lloyd George, as\r\nCoalition Premier, advocated eight years later. He went on to say that\r\nthe Ulster people would submit to no ascendancy and \"he could imagine\r\nno lengths of resistance to which they might go in which he would not\r\nbe ready to support them\" and in which they would not be supported by\r\nthe overwhelming majority of the British people.\r\n\r\nIn Parliament a few weeks later Mr Asquith described Mr Bonar Law's\r\nspeech as a declaration of war against Constitutional Government, but\r\nthe Ulstermen went on calmly making their preparations for levying war\r\nand Sir Edward Carson and his friends coolly delivered speeches which\r\nreeked of sedition and treason against the State. Sir Edward Carson\r\ndeclared (27th July 1912): \"We will shortly challenge the Government.\r\nThey shall us if they like it is treason. We are prepared to take the\r\nconsequences.\" And again he said (1st October 1912): \"The\r\nAttorney-General says that my doctrines and the course I am taking\r\nlead to anarchy. Does he not think I know that?\" And that fine\r\nexemplar of constitutional law, Mr F.E. Smith (now Lord Chancellor of\r\nEngland) said: \"Supposing the Government gave such an order the\r\nconsequences can only be described in the words of Mr Bonar Law when\r\nhe said: 'If they did so it would not be a matter of argument but the\r\npopulation of London would lynch you on the lamp-posts.'\" Ulster\r\nscarcely needed these incitements to encourage it in its definite\r\npurpose of armed resistance to Home Rule. It began to organise and\r\ndiscipline its army of Volunteers under able military leaders who\r\nsubsequently demonstrated their capacity in no uncertain fashion,\r\nunder the tests of actual warfare on many fields of battle. With the\r\nknowledge we now possess it seems scarcely believable that Mr Redmond\r\nand his friends should have professed to treat what was happening in\r\nUlster as \"a gigantic game of bluff.\" They joked pleasantly over the\r\ndrilling of the Ulster Volunteers with \"wooden guns,\" and they only\r\nasked that the Government should \"Let the police and soldiers stand\r\naside and make a ring and you will hear no more of the wooden gunmen.\"\r\nRibaldry and gibes of this sort in the face of open and avowed treason\r\nwas but a poor substitute for that firm statesmanship which should\r\nhave grappled with the Ulster difficulty in either of two ways--to\r\ncome to terms with it or, in the alternative, beat all unruly\r\nopposition to the ground.\r\n\r\nMr Asquith is blamed because he did not put the law in operation\r\nagainst Sir Edward Carson, proclaim his illegal organisation of\r\nVolunteers and deal with him and his friends as a people seditious and\r\ndisaffected towards the State, who, by their acts and conduct, had\r\ninvited and merited the traitors' doom. But Mr Devlin declared not\r\nlong after in Parliament that the reason why Mr Asquith did not move\r\nwas because he and his friends would not allow him. Whence this\r\nextraordinary tenderness for the man who was thwarting and defying\r\nthem at every point, it is not possible to say. No doubt the Ministry\r\nknew themselves in the wrong in that they had not considered the\r\nposition of Ulster and had not attempted to legislate for their just\r\nfears. It is beyond question that there were conditions upon which the\r\nconsent of Ulster could have been secured. If, these conditions being\r\noffered, this consent was unreasonably withheld, then the Government\r\nwould have been absolutely justified in throttling Sir Edward Carson's\r\npreparations for rebellion before they had gained any ground or\r\neffective shape. But the weakness of the Liberal-Irish position was\r\nthat they would not bring themselves to admit that the All-for-Ireland\r\npolicy of Conciliation and a settlement by Conference and Consent was\r\nright.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, with a weak Irish administration in charge of Mr Birrell as\r\nChief Secretary--most amiable of _litterateurs_, but most\r\nimbecile of politicians--the Ulster opposition was allowed to harden\r\ninto potential violence and civil war. \"Engagements\" between the\r\nOrangemen and the Hibernians began to form a sort of political\r\namusement in the north of Ireland. The cries of religious and race\r\nhatred were allowed to devour the sweeter gospel of reconciliation and\r\nthe recognition of a common country and that communion of right and\r\ninterest between all classes and creeds which was the evangel of Wolfe\r\nTone and other northern Protestant patriots in sublimer days. Matters\r\nwere drifting from bad to worse under the fatal weakness and\r\nirresolution of the Government. So little fear had Sir Edward Carson\r\nof any penal consequences to himself that he declared, on the 7th\r\nSeptember 1913:\r\n\r\n\"We will set up a Government [of their own as provided for in the\r\nUlster Covenant]. I am told it will be illegal. Of course it will.\r\nDrilling is illegal. The Government dare not interfere.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was right! It did not interfere. And the Ulster Volunteers\r\nbegan to provide themselves with arms and ammunition and to organise\r\nthemselves for actual war conditions. There were no more feeble jokes\r\nabout \"wooden guns\" and \"making a free ring\"--as if it were to be\r\nonly an ordinary pugilistic encounter and of no account. In 1913 the\r\nUlster Volunteer Force was said to be well armed and probably better\r\ndrilled than the northern regiments at the outbreak of the American\r\nWar of Secession.\r\n\r\nOfficial nationalism was, though it knew it not, passing through the\r\ngates of disaster. It was still able to maintain its hold on the old\r\nstagers who were grafted on to it for various reasons, and the Board\r\nof Erin was still able to count on the fidelity of those who believed\r\nin the secret sign and watchword as the avenue to place and\r\npreferment.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Ireland Bill was merrily pursuing its three years'\r\ncourse through Parliament--passed by the House of Commons and rejected\r\nby the House of Lords after the usual farce and formality of debates\r\nwhich had very little reality in them. What counted was that Ulster\r\nwas in arms and determined to resist and that \"the Home Rule\r\nGovernment\" had proved themselves incapable either of conceding or of\r\nresisting. Other things began to count also in Ireland. The young\r\nmanhood of Nationalist Ireland, seeing the liberties of their country\r\nmenaced by force, decided to organise themselves into a corps of Irish\r\nVolunteers to defend these liberties from wanton aggression. The\r\nTransport Workers' Strike in Dublin, in 1913, under Mr James Larkin,\r\nalso showed the existence of a powerful body of organised opinion,\r\nwhich cared little for ordinary political methods and which was\r\nclearly disaffected to the Party leaders. Forces were being loosed\r\nthat had long been held in check by the power of the place-hunting and\r\nsectarian \"constitutional\" movement asserting and enforcing its\r\nauthority, through unscrupulous methods already described, to speak\r\nand act on behalf of the people. If Sir Edward Carson had risen to\r\npower through open and flagrant defiance of all constituted right and\r\nauthority, there were others who were not slow to copy his methods.\r\nThe Irish Party may denounce him in Parliament as a disloyal subject\r\nof the Crown, but there were young Nationalists in Southern Ireland,\r\naye, even in Rebel Cork, who sincerely raised cheers for him because\r\nhe had shown them, as they believed, the better way \"to save Ireland.\"\r\nThe Government could not make one law for the North and another for\r\nthe South. If it allowed the Orangemen to drill and arm it could not\r\nwell interfere with the Nationalists if they took a leaf out of their\r\nbook and proceeded to act in like manner. And thus are the destinies\r\nof people and the fate of nations decided. In preparing for civil war\r\nSir Edward Carson gave that spur of encouragement to Germany that it\r\njust needed to rush it into a world war. And for how much else he is\r\nresponsible in Ireland every faithful student of current history\r\nknows!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n               SINN FEIN--ITS ORIGINAL MEANING AND PURPOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nSinn Fein had a comparatively small and unimportant beginning. It was\r\nnot heralded into existence by any great flourish of trumpets nor for\r\nmany years had it any considerable following among the masses of the\r\nNationalists. It is more than doubtful, if there had been normal\r\npolitical progress in Ireland, whether Sinn Fein would ever have made\r\nitself into a great movement. It was, in the first instance, the\r\ndisappointments and humiliations which the debilitated Irish Party had\r\nbrought to the national movement and the utter disrepute into which\r\nParliamentarianism had fallen as a consequence that moved the thoughts\r\nof Ireland's young manhood to some nobler and better way of serving\r\nthe Motherland. But it was the rebellion of Easter Week which\r\ncrystallised and fused all these various thoughts and ideals into one\r\ndirect channel of action and made Sinn Fein the mightiest national\r\nforce that has perhaps arisen in Ireland since first the English set\r\nfoot upon our shores for purposes of conquest.\r\n\r\nSinn Fein, as a political organisation, did not exist until 1905, but\r\nthe originator of it, Mr Arthur Griffith, had established in Dublin,\r\nin 1899, a weekly paper called _The United Irishman_. This was\r\nthe title of the paper which John Mitchell had founded to advocate the\r\npolicy of the Young Irelanders and was, therefore, supposed to favour\r\nto some extent a movement along those lines. Its appeal was mainly to\r\nthe young and intellectual and to those extremists who were out of\r\nharmony with the moderate demands of the Parliamentary Party. Its\r\nfirst editorial gave an index to its teachings and aims. \"There\r\nexists,\" it declared, \"has existed for centuries and will continue to\r\nexist in Ireland a conviction hostile to the subjection or dependence\r\nof the fortunes of this country to the necessities of any other; we\r\nintend to voice that conviction. We bear no ill-will to any section of\r\nthe Irish political body, whether its flag be green or orange, which\r\nholds that tortuous paths are the safest for Irishmen to tread; but\r\nknowing we are governed by a nation which religiously adheres to 'the\r\ngood old rule, the simple plan, that those may take who have the power\r\nand those may keep who can,' we, with all respect for our friends who\r\nlove the devious ways, are convinced that an occasional exhibition of\r\nthe naked truth will not shock the modesty of Irishmen and that a\r\nreturn to the straight road will not lead us to political\r\ndestruction.... In these later days we have been diligently taught\r\nthat, by the law of God, of Nature and of Nations, we are rightfully\r\nentitled to the establishment in Dublin of a legislative assembly,\r\nwith an expunging angel watching over its actions from the Viceregal\r\nLodge. We do not deprecate the institution of any such body, but we do\r\nassert that the whole duty of an Irishman is not comprised in\r\nutilising all the forces of his nature to procure its inception.\" It\r\ncontinued: \"With the present-day movements outside politics we are in\r\nmore or less sympathy,\" and it particularly specified the Financial\r\nReformers and the Gaelic League, adding, however: \"We would regret any\r\ninsistence on a knowledge of Gaelic as a test of patriotism.\" Finally\r\nit said: \"Lest there might be any doubt in any mind, we will say that\r\nwe accept the Nationalism of '98, '48 and '67 as the true Nationalism,\r\nand Grattan's cry 'Live Ireland. Perish the Empire' as the watchword\r\nof patriotism.\" Thus its creed was the absolute independence of\r\nIreland, and though it did not advocate the methods of armed\r\nrevolution, it opened its columns to those Nationalists who did. It\r\npreached particularly the doctrine of self-reliance and independence.\r\nIt attached more importance to moral qualities than to mere political\r\naction. It was free in its criticism of persons or parties who it\r\nconsidered were setting up false standards for the guidance of the\r\npeople. It derided the policy of the Irish Party as \"half-bluster and\r\nhalf-whine,\" and when Mr Redmond spoke rhetorically of \"wringing from\r\nwhatever Government may be in power the full measure of a nation's\r\nrights,\" it bluntly told him he was talking \"arrant humbug.\" It made\r\nthe development of Irish industries one of the foremost objects of its\r\nadvocacy. It courageously attacked the Catholic clergy for the faults\r\nit saw, or thought it saw, in them. They were told they took no\r\neffective steps to arrest emigration--that they next to the British\r\nGovernment were responsible for the depopulation of the country; that\r\nthey failed to encourage Irish trade and manufactures and that they\r\n\"made life dull and unendurable for the people.\" And so on and so\r\nforth it continued its criticisms with remarkable candour and\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\nIt came early into conflict with the Castle authorities on account of\r\nits vigorous propaganda against recruiting for the army and it\r\npublished the text of an anti-recruiting pamphlet for the distribution\r\nof which prosecutions were instituted. It was found difficult,\r\nhowever, to obtain convictions against those who distributed these\r\npamphlets, and even in Belfast a jury refused to bring in a conviction\r\non this charge at the instance of the Crown. _The United\r\nIrishman_ was seized by the authorities and only got an excellent\r\nadvertisement into the bargain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an organisation of Irishmen who shared the views of the\r\npaper was being gradually evolved, and in 1900 the first steps were\r\ntaken in the foundation of Cumann na n Gaedhal. Its objects were to\r\nadvance the cause of Ireland's national independence by (1)\r\ncultivating a fraternal spirit amongst Irishmen; (2) diffusing\r\nknowledge of Ireland's resources and supporting Irish industries; (3)\r\nthe study and teaching of Irish history, literature, language, music\r\nand art; (4) the assiduous cultivation and encouragement of Irish\r\ngames, pastimes and characteristics; (5) the discountenancing of\r\nanything tending towards the Anglicisation of Ireland; (6) the\r\nphysical and intellectual training of the young; (7) the development\r\nof an Irish foreign policy; (8) extending to each other friendly\r\nadvice and aid, socially and politically; (9) the nationalisation of\r\npublic boards. It was felt, however, that the ends of Cumann na n\r\nGaedhal were remote and that something more was needed to bring the\r\nnew policy into more intimate connection with political facts. This\r\nwas supplied by Mr A. Griffith when he outlined, in October, 1902,\r\nwhat came to be known afterwards as the Hungarian policy. This policy\r\nwas, in effect, a demand that the members of the Irish Parliamentary\r\nshould abstain from attendance at Westminster, which was declared to\r\nbe \"useless, degrading and demoralising,\" and should adopt the policy\r\nof the Hungarian Deputies of 1861 and, \"refusing to attend the British\r\nParliament or to recognise its right to legislate for Ireland, remain\r\nat home to help in promoting Ireland's interests and to aid in\r\nguarding its national rights.\"\r\n\r\nA pamphlet by Mr Griffith, entitled _The Resurrection of\r\nHungary_, was prepared and published, which expounded the details of\r\nthe new policy. Mr R.M. Henry, in his admirable book, _The\r\nEvolution of Sinn Fein_ (to which I express my indebtedness for\r\nmuch of what appears in this chapter), tells us that the pamphlet, as\r\na piece of propaganda, was a failure, and produced no immediate or\r\nwidespread response. Mr Henry also takes exception to the fact of Mr\r\nGriffith putting forward the Hungarian policy as an original idea. \"It\r\nhad,\" he writes, \"been advocated and to a certain extent practised in\r\nIreland long before the Hungarian Deputies adopted it,\" and he quotes\r\nmatter to show that Thomas Davis was the real author of the policy of\r\nParliamentary abstention and wonders why the credit was not given to\r\nthe Irishman instead of the Hungarian Franz Deák.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Mr Griffith at this stage was that the independence of\r\nIreland was to be based not upon force but upon law and the\r\nconstitution of 1782: \"His claim was not a Republic, but a national\r\nconstitution under an Irish Crown\" (Mr R.M. Henry). Finally _Sinn\r\nFein_, which, literally translated, means \"Ourselves,\" was formally\r\ninaugurated at a meeting held in Dublin on 28th November 1905, under\r\nthe chairmanship of Mr Edward Martyn and was defined as: \"National\r\nself-development through the recognition of the rights and duties of\r\ncitizenship on the part of the individual and by the aid and support\r\nof all movements originating from within Ireland, instinct with\r\nnational tradition and not looking outside Ireland for the\r\naccomplishment of their aims.\"\r\n\r\nSinn Fein had now formally constituted itself into a distinct Party,\r\nwith a definite policy of its own, and _The United Irishman_\r\nceasing to exist, a new organ was established, called _Sinn\r\nFein_. But though Mr Griffith may found a Party, he was not so\r\nfortunate in getting followers. The Parliamentarians had not yet begun\r\nto make that mess of their position which they did so lamentably\r\nlater. That self-reliant spirit was not abroad which came when a\r\nmanlier generation arose to take their stand for Ireland.\r\n\r\nCanon Hannay paints a peculiarly unpleasant picture of the state of\r\nIreland at this time. \"Never,\" he writes, \"in her history was Ireland\r\nless inclined to self-reliance. The soul of the country was debauched\r\nwith doles and charities. An English statesman might quite truthfully\r\nhave boasted that Ireland would eat out of his hand. The only thing\r\nwhich troubled most of us was that the hand, whether we licked it or\r\nsnarled at it, was never full enough. The idea of self-help was\r\nintensely unpleasant, and as for self-sacrifice!\" The note of\r\nexclamation sufficiently conveys the writer's meaning.\r\n\r\nThe Sinn Fein organisation as a national movement made very little\r\nprogress and exercised no considerable influence in affairs. But its\r\nprinciples undoubtedly spread, particularly among the more earnest and\r\nenthusiastic young men in the towns. The one Parliamentary election it\r\ncontested--that of North Leitrim, where the sitting member, Mr C.J.\r\nDolan, resigned, declared himself a convert to the new movement and\r\noffered himself for re-election--proved a costly failure. It\r\nestablished a daily edition of _Sinn Fein_, but this also had no\r\nsuccess and had to be dropped. For some following years Sinn Fein\r\ncould be said merely to exist as a name and nothing more. The country\r\nhad dangled before it the project of the triumph of Parliamentarianism\r\nand it discouraged all criticism of \"the Party,\" no matter how just,\r\nhonest or well-intended. In April 1910, _Sinn Fein_ announced, on\r\nbehalf of its Party, that Mr John Redmond, having now the chance of a\r\nlifetime to obtain Home Rule, \"will be given a free hand, without a\r\nword said to embarrass him.\" Sinn Fein took no part in the elections\r\nof 1910. \"This,\" says Mr Henry, \"was not purely an act of\r\nself-sacrifice. In fact, Sinn Fein was never at so low an ebb.\" Its\r\nattitude towards the Home Rule, which now seemed inevitable, was\r\nstated as follows:--\"No scheme which the English Parliament may pass\r\nin the near future will satisfy Sinn Fein--no legislature created in\r\nIreland which is not supreme and absolute will offer a basis for\r\nconcluding a final settlement with the foreigners who usurp the\r\nGovernment of this country. But any measure which gives genuine, if\r\neven partial, control of their own affairs to Irishmen shall meet with\r\nno opposition from us and should meet with no opposition from any\r\nsection of Irishmen.\"\r\n\r\nFrom now onward until 1914 the Sinn Fein Movement was practically\r\nmoribund and its name was scarcely heard of. When it appeared again as\r\nan active force it was not the old Sinn Fein Movement that was there.\r\nAs Canon Hannay justly remarks: \"It cannot be said with any accuracy\r\nthat Sinn Fein won Ireland. Ireland took over Sinn Fein. Indeed,\r\nIreland took over very little of Sinn Fein except the name.\" And this\r\nis the literal truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                  LABOUR BECOMES A POWER IN IRISH LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the play and interplay of movements and events at this time in\r\nIreland we cannot leave out of account the Labour Movement--that is,\r\nthe official Trade Union organisation as distinct from the Labourers'\r\nAssociation. Hitherto it had mainly concerned itself with industrial\r\nand social questions and had not made politics or nationalism an\r\nobject of direct activity. The workers had their politics, so to\r\nspeak, apart from their Trade Unions, and the toilers from Belfast\r\nwere able to meet the moilers from Cork for the consideration of their\r\ncommon programme and common lot without infringing on the vexed issue\r\nof Home Rule, on which they held widely divergent views--often enough\r\nwithout understanding the reason why. They were a good deal concerned\r\nabout municipal government and how many men they were able to return\r\nto the Dublin, Belfast and Cork corporations, but they had not counted\r\nhighly and, indeed, scarcely at all in the scheme of national affairs.\r\nThe Parliamentarians were too strong for them. Yet it was the workers\r\nwho always provided the soundest leaders of nationality and its most\r\nincorruptible and self-sacrificing body-guard. The thinkers expressed\r\nthe ideals of Irish nationhood; they lived them and were even prepared\r\nto suffer for them. But the time had come when this parochialism of\r\nlabour in Ireland was to end. To the enthusiasm and impetuous force of\r\nJames Larkin and the fine brain of James Connolly Irish labour owes\r\nmost for its awakening. The rise of Larkin was almost meteoric. He was\r\none day organising the workers of Cork into a Transport Workers Union;\r\nalmost the next he was marshalling a strike in Dublin, which made him\r\nan international democratic figure of extraordinary power. He was a\r\nman of amazing personality, who exercised a compelling influence over\r\nthe workers. He shook them out of their deadly stupor, lectured them\r\nin a manner that they were not accustomed to, brow-beat them and,\r\nthough he made them suffer in body over the weary months of the\r\nstrike, he infused a spirit into them they had not known before. He\r\nmade the world ring with the shame of Dublin's slums and he did much\r\nto make men of those who were little better than dumb-driven animals.\r\nHe united the Capitalists of Ireland against him in a powerful\r\norganisation, and though they broke his strike they did not break the\r\nspirit that was behind it. Some men will say the Rebellion of Easter\r\nWeek had its beginnings in the Dublin Strike of 1913; others that\r\nCarson was the cause of it; whilst many ascribe it to the criminal\r\nfolly and short-sightedness of Redmond and his followers, who allowed\r\nBritish politicians to bully and betray them at every point and made\r\nParliamentarianism of their type intolerable to the young soul of\r\nIreland. History in due course will assign each its due meed of\r\nresponsibility, but of this we are certain, that the men who came out\r\nin Easter Week and bore arms were largely the men whom Larkin had\r\norganised and whom Connolly's doctrine had influenced. From the point\r\nof view of mental calibre Connolly was by far the abler man. He was\r\nnot as well known outside Labour circles in Dublin as he has come to\r\nbe since his death, but to anyone who has given any thought or study\r\nto his life and writings he must appear a person of single-minded\r\npurpose, great ability, ordered methods of thought and a fine\r\nNationalism, which was rooted in the principles of Wolfe Tone and the\r\nUnited Irishmen. Connolly preached the gospel of social democracy with\r\na fine and almost inspired fervour. He was an internationalist in the\r\nfull Socialist sense, but seeing the harrowing sights that beset him\r\nevery day in the abominable slums of Dublin City he was an Irish\r\nReformer above all else. Mr Robert Lynd writes of him, in his\r\nIntroduction to Connolly's _Labour in Ireland_:\r\n\r\n\"To Connolly Dublin was in one respect a vast charnel-house of the\r\npoor. He quotes figures showing that in 1908 the death-rate in Dublin\r\nCity was 23 per 1000 as compared with a mean death-rate of 15.8 in the\r\nseventy-six largest English towns. He then quotes other figures,\r\nshowing that while among the professional and independent classes of\r\nDublin children under five die at a rate of 0.9 per 1000 of the\r\npopulation of the class the rate among the labouring poor is 27.7. To\r\nacquiesce in conditions such as are revealed in these figures is to be\r\nguilty of something like child murder. We endure such things because\r\nit is the tradition of comfortable people to endure them. But it would\r\nbe impossible for any people that had its social conscience awakened\r\nto endure them for a day. Connolly was the pioneer of the social\r\nconscience in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on \"Labour in Dublin\" Connolly himself thus refers to\r\nthe Dublin Strike and what it meant:\r\n\r\n\"Out of all this turmoil and fighting the Irish working class movement\r\nhas evolved, is evolving, amongst its members a higher conception of\r\nmutual life, a realisation of their duties to each other and to\r\nsociety at large, and are thus building for the future a way that\r\nought to gladden the hearts of all lovers of the race. In contrast to\r\nthe narrow, restricted outlook of the Capitalist class and even of\r\ncertain old-fashioned trade unionists, with their perpetual insistence\r\nupon 'rights,' it insists, almost fiercely, that there are no rights\r\nwithout duties, and the first duty is to help one another. This is,\r\nindeed, revolutionary and disturbing, but not half as much as would be\r\na practical following out of the moral precepts of Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nHere we get some measure of the man and of his creed. To the part he\r\nplayed in the Easter Week Rebellion I must refer in its own proper\r\nplace. That the Dublin Strike and its consequences had a profound\r\neffect on later events, this quotation from \"Æ\" will show. In a famous\r\n\"open letter\" to the employers he declared:\r\n\r\n\"The men whose manhood you have broken will loathe you and will be\r\nalways brooding and scheming to strike a fresh blow. The children will\r\nbe taught to curse you. The infant being moulded in the womb will have\r\nbreathed into its starved body the vitality of hate. It is not\r\nthey--it is you who are blind Samsons pulling down the pillars of the\r\nsocial order.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet oftentimes has the vision to see in clear outline what the\r\npolitician and the Pharisee cannot even glimpse.\r\n\r\nAt any rate this may be asserted, that from the year of the Dublin\r\nStrike dates the uprise of Labour in Ireland. Connolly became a martyr\r\nfor his principles, whilst Larkin has been hunted from one end of the\r\nworld to the other because of his doctrines, undoubtedly of an\r\nextremely revolutionary character. But able men have arisen to\r\ncontinue the work they inaugurated and Labour in Ireland has now\r\nformally insisted on its right to be a political Party as well as a\r\nsocial organisation. It no longer circumscribes its aspirations to\r\npurely industrial issues and social concerns, but it takes its place\r\non the stage of larger happenings and events and is like to play a\r\ngreat part in the moulding of the Ireland that will arise when the old\r\nvicious systems and forms are shattered for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                  CARSON, ULSTER AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the nearness of the time when Home Rule must automatically become\r\nlaw, unless something happened to interfere, events began to move\r\nrapidly. The Tory Party, largely, I believe, through political\r\nconsiderations, had unalterably taken sides with Ulster. The Liberal\r\nParty were irresolute, wavering, pusillanimous. Mr Redmond's followers\r\nbegan to be uneasy--they commenced to falter in their blind faith that\r\nthey had only to trust Asquith and all would be well.\r\n\r\n\"In the Ancient Order of Hibernians,\" Mr Henry tells us, \"all sections\r\nof Sinn Fein, as well as the Labour Party, saw a menace to any\r\nprospect of an accommodation with Ulster. This strictly sectarian\r\nsociety, as sectarian and often as violent in its methods as the\r\nOrange Lodges, evoked their determined hostility.\"\r\n\r\n\"This narrowing down,\" wrote _Irish Freedom_ (the organ of Mr P.\r\nH. Pearse and his friends), \"of Nationalism to the members of one\r\ncreed is the most fatal thing that has taken place in Irish politics\r\nsince the days of the Pope's Brass Band,\" and the Ancient Order was\r\nfurther referred to as \"a job-getting and job-cornering organisation,\"\r\nas \"a silent, practical riveting of sectarianism on the nation.\"\r\n_The Irish Worker_ was equally emphatic. \"Were it not for the\r\nexistence of the Board of Erin the Orange Society would have long\r\nsince ceased to exist. To Brother Devlin and not to Brother Carson is\r\nmainly due the progress of the Covenanter Movement in Ulster.\"\r\n\r\nThough no doubt in Ireland religion exercises a considerable\r\ninfluence, it is nevertheless a mistake to think that it was purely a\r\nquestion of religion with those redoubtable Northern Unionists whom\r\nSir Edward Carson led. They attached more importance to their\r\npolitical rights and independent commercial position, which they\r\nbelieved to be endangered; corruption in matters of administration was\r\nwhat they were most in dread of. The Irish Party used to point proudly\r\nto the number of Protestants who had been elected as members of their\r\nParty. The reply of Ulster was that they owed their election to their\r\naccommodating spirit in accepting the Parliamentary policy and not\r\nbecause of their rigid adherence to Protestant principles.\r\n\r\nThen came the Lame gun-running expedition, when the _Fanny_\r\nsailed across from Hamburg, under the noses of English destroyers and\r\nmen-of-war, and, it is said, with the knowledge and connivance of the\r\nofficers commanding them, safely landed 50,000 German rifles and\r\nseveral million rounds of ammunition, which were distributed within\r\ntwenty-four hours to the Covenanters throughout the Province. It is\r\nclear that at this time extensive negotiations were going on between\r\nGermany and the Ulster extremists. The Ulster Provisional Government\r\nwere leaving nothing to chance. History is entitled to know the full\r\nstory of all that happened at this most fateful period--what\r\n\"discussions\" took place between the Ulster leaders and the Kaiser,\r\nhow far Sir Edward Carson was implicated in these matters and how real\r\nand positive is his responsibility for the world war that ensued. And\r\nit should be borne in mind that these seditious traffickings with a\r\nforeign state were going on at a time when there was no Sinn Fein army\r\nin existence, and that the man who first showed a readiness not alone\r\nto invoke German aid but actually to avail himself of it, was not any\r\nSouthern Nationalist rebel leader but Sir Edward Carson, the leader\r\nand, as he was called, \"the Uncrowned King\" of Ulster. When critics\r\ncondemn the Nationalists of the South for their alleged communications\r\nwith Germany, let them not, in all fairness, forget Sir Edward Carson\r\nwas the man who first showed the way. To whom then--if guilt there\r\nbe--does the greater guilt belong? When the news of this audacious\r\ngun-running expedition was published, Ireland waited breathless to\r\nknow what was going to happen. Warships were posted on the Ulster\r\ncoast, ostensibly to stop further gun-running, and the Prime Minister\r\nannounced in the House of Commons that \"in view of this grave and\r\nunprecedented outrage the Government would take appropriate steps\r\nwithout delay to vindicate the authority of the law.\"\r\n\r\nBut in view of what _The Westminster Gazette_ termed \"the abject\r\nsurrender to the Army\" of the Government over the Curragh incident,\r\nwhen officers were declared to have refused to serve against Ulster,\r\nnot much in the way of stern measures was to be expected now. The\r\nGovernment on the occasion of the Curragh incident had declared: \"His\r\nMajesty's Government must retain their right to use all the forces of\r\nthe Crown in Ireland or elsewhere to maintain law and order and to\r\nsupport the civil power in the ordinary execution of its duty. But\r\nthey have no intention whatever of taking advantage of this right to\r\ncrush political opposition to the policy or principles of the Home\r\nRule Bill.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mr Balfour was not slow in pointing out, this statement made \"it\r\nimpossible to coerce Ulster.\" The officers who had refused to obey\r\norders, including General Gough, were in effect patted on the back,\r\ntold they were splendid fellows, and that they would not be asked to\r\nmarch against Ulster. It was the same thing over again in the case of\r\nthe _Fanny_ exploit, Sir Edward Carson unblushingly improving the\r\noccasion by laying stress on the weakening of Great Britain's position\r\nabroad that followed as a consequence of his own acts. The Irish Party\r\nleaders, who had a few months before still persisted in describing the\r\nUlster preparations as \"a masquerade\" and \"a sham,\" were now in a\r\nstate of funk and panic. They found the solid ground they thought they\r\nhad stood on rapidly slipping from under them. There was to be no\r\nprosecution of the Ulster leaders, no proclamation of their\r\norganisation, nothing to compel them to surrender the arms they had so\r\nbrazenly and illegally imported.\r\n\r\nWhy was not Carson arrested at this crisis, as he surely ought to have\r\nbeen by any Government which respected its constitutional forms and\r\nauthority, not to speak of its dignity? Captain Wedgwood Benn having\r\nin the Parliamentary Session of 1919 taunted Sir Edward Carson with\r\nhis threat that if Ulster was coerced he intended to break every law\r\nthat was possible, there followed this interchange:\r\n\r\nSir E. Carson: I agree that these words are perfectly correct.\r\n\r\nA Labour Member: Anyone else would have been in prison.\r\n\r\nSir E. Carson: Why was I not put in prison?\r\n\r\nMr Devlin: Because I was against it.\r\n\r\nWell may Mr Devlin take all the credit that is due to him for\r\npreventing Sir Edward Carson's arrest, considering that he and his\r\nOrder had been mainly the cause of bringing Carson to the verge of\r\nrebellion, but that gentleman himself seems to have a different\r\nopinion about it if we are to put any credence in the following\r\nextract from Colonel Repington's _Diary of the First World War_,\r\nunder date 19th November 1915:\r\n\r\n\"Had a talk with Carson about the Ulster business. He was very amusing\r\nand outspoken. He told me how near we were to an explosion, that the\r\nGovernment had determined to arrest the chief leaders; that he had\r\narranged to send the one word H.X. over the wire to Belfast and that\r\nthis was to be the signal for the seizure of the Customs throughout\r\nUlster. He called to see the King and told Stamfordham exactly what\r\nwas going to happen and the arrest of the leaders was promptly\r\nstopped.\"\r\n\r\nNote the scandalous implication here! What does it amount to? That Sir\r\nEdward Carson went to Buckingham Palace, held the threat of civil war\r\nover the King, and intimidated His Majesty into using his exalted\r\noffice to screen the Orange leader and his chief advisers from\r\nprosecution! If it does not bear this meaning, what other can it bear?\r\nAnd what are we to think of its relation to constitutional authority\r\nand right usage?\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only occasion on which Sir Edward Carson shows up\r\nin Colonel Repington's pages. Under date 19th October 1916:\r\n\r\n\"Carson told me that a man who had been on board the _Fanny_ was\r\nwriting the story of the famous voyage and the gun-running exploit.\"\r\n\r\nWe have not got that story yet. When it is published it would be an\r\nadvantage if we could also have the full account of the circumstances\r\nunder which Baron von Kuhlman went over to Ireland to prospect as to\r\nthe imminence of civil war, who it was he saw in Ulster, what\r\narrangements and interviews he had with the Ulster Volunteers and\r\ntheir leaders, who were the other prominent people he met there and,\r\nabove all, how the _Fanny's_ cargo of German rifles was arranged\r\nand paid for? Surely these are questions vital to an understanding of\r\nthe extent of Sir Edward Carson's culpability for the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nLoyalist Ulster--the Ulster of law and order--was now openly defiant\r\nof the law. Mr P.H. Pearse summed up the situation rather neatly in an\r\narticle in _Irish Freedom_:\r\n\r\n\"One great source of misunderstanding\" (he wrote) \"has now\r\ndisappeared; it has become clear within the last few years that the\r\nOrangeman is no more loyal to England than we are. He wants the Union\r\nbecause he imagines it secures his prosperity, but he is ready to fire\r\non the Union flag the moment it threatens his prosperity.... The case\r\nmight be put thus: Hitherto England has governed Ireland through the\r\nOrange Lodges--she now proposes to govern Ireland through the Ancient\r\nOrder of Hibernians. You object: so do we. Why not unite and get rid\r\nof the English? They are the real difficulty; their presence here the\r\nreal incongruity.\"\r\n\r\nI quote this to show it was not the All-for-Irelanders alone who saw\r\nthat the Board of Erin was the real stumbling-block in the way of a\r\nnational settlement. And now when matters were to be put to the test\r\nthe Government showed a monstrous culpability. It does not avail them\r\nto say that the Irish Party had been guilty of treachery to Ireland,\r\nthat it misled the Ministry as to the extent and depth of Ulster's\r\nirreconcilability, and that it had betrayed its own supporters by\r\nreposing a childish faith in Liberal promises. The Government must\r\nbear their own responsibility for allowing Sir Edward Carson and the\r\nUlster Covenanters to defy and thwart them at every point, for\r\npermitting what amounted to a mutiny in the army, for ordering the\r\nChannel Fleet and the soldiers to Ulster \"to put these grave matters\r\nto the test even if the red blood should flow,\" and then withdrawing\r\nthem again, for issuing a proclamation forbidding the importation of\r\narms and allowing the Covenanters to spit at it in mockery, and\r\nfinally for admitting, in the famous Army Order I have quoted, the\r\nRight of Rebellion as part of the constitutional machinery of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\"The gigantic game of bluff\"--as the Ulster preparations were\r\ntermed--had won outright. The political gamesters, who would not\r\nsurrender an inch to Ulster when it could be negotiated with, were now\r\nwilling to surrender everything, including the principle of an\r\nindivisible Irish nationhood. \"Conversations\" between the various\r\nleaders went on during the early months of 1914 to arrange a compromise\r\nand a settlement, the gigantic crime of Partition as a substitute for\r\nIrish Freedom was traitorously perpetrated by Ireland's own\r\n\"representatives\" and by the so-called \"Home Rule Government,\" and\r\nIreland woke up one fine morning to find that the Home Rule Act even\r\nwhen on the Statute Book might as well not be there--all the bonfires\r\nthat were lighted in Ireland to hail its enactment\r\nnothwithstanding--that \"Dark Rosaleen,\" the mother that they loved so\r\nwell, was to be brutally dismembered, and that \"A Nation Once Again\" was\r\nto mean, in the words of Sir Horace Plunkett: \"Half Home Rule for\r\nthree-quarters of Ireland.\" The Prime Minister had proposed the\r\npartition of Ireland--three-fourths to go to the Nationalists and\r\none-fourth to the Orangemen--and the Irish Party had accepted the\r\nproposal, nay, more, they summoned a Conference of Northern Nationalists\r\nand compelled them to pass a resolution, strongly against their\r\ninclination, in favour of the proposal, under threat of the resignation\r\nof Messrs Redmond, Dillon and Devlin if the resolution were not adopted.\r\n\r\nAn Amending Bill was immediately introduced into Parliament (23rd June\r\n1914), which provided for the exclusion of such Ulster counties as\r\nmight avail themselves of it. This measure was transformed by the\r\nHouse of Lords so as permanently to exclude the whole of Ulster from\r\nthe operations of the Home Rule Act.\r\n\r\nBy people forgetful of the facts, it is sometimes supposed that the\r\nPartition was agreed to by the Irish Party under the pressure of war\r\nconditions. This is not so. The Party have not even this poor excuse\r\nto justify their betrayal, which was the culminating point in the\r\nsteep declivity of their downfall. The All-for-Ireland Party resisted\r\nwith all the strength at their command the violation of Ireland's\r\nnational unity. We spoke against it, voted against it, did all we\r\ncould to rouse the conscience of the people as to its unparalleled\r\niniquity. But though a proposal more offensive to every instinct of\r\nnational feeling could not be submitted, the Irish Party determined to\r\nsee the thing through--they seemed anxious to catch at any straw that\r\nwould save them from an irretrievable doom. On account of the deadlock\r\nbetween the Lords and Commons on the question of exclusion, and with a\r\nview to the adjustment of differences, it was announced that the King\r\nhad summoned a Conference of two representatives from each\r\nParty--eight in all--to meet at Buckingham Palace. It is believed that\r\nthis Conference was initiated by His Majesty but taken with the\r\nknowledge and consent of the Ministry. Messrs Redmond and Dillon\r\nrepresented the Irish Party, and thus the man (Mr Dillon) who had been\r\nfor ten years denouncing any Conference with his own countrymen went\r\nblithely into a Conference at Buckingham Palace, where the only issue\r\nto be discussed was as to whether Sir Edward Carson should have four\r\nor six counties for his kingdom in the North. On this point the\r\nConference for the moment disagreed, but nothing can ever undo the\r\nfact that a body of Irishmen claiming to be Nationalists had not only\r\nignobly agreed to the Partition of their native land but, after twelve\r\nmonths for deliberation, agreed to surrender six counties, instead of\r\nfour, to the Covenanters. And the time came when it was remembered for\r\nthem in an Ireland which had worthier concepts of Nationality than\r\npartition and plunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                FORMATION OF IRISH VOLUNTEERS AND OUTBREAK\r\n                                  OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Nationalist Ireland was deep in its heart revolted by the\r\nway the Parliamentary Party was managing its affairs. They sought\r\nstill to delude it with the cry that \"the Act\" was on the Statute Book\r\nand that all would be well. My experience of my own people is that\r\nonce confidence is yielded to a person or party they are trustful to\r\nan amazing degree; let that confidence once be disturbed, then\r\ndistrust and suspicion are quickly bred--and to anyone who knows the\r\nCeltic psychology a suspicious Irishman is not a very pleasant person\r\nto deal with. This the Party were to find out in suitable time.\r\nMeanwhile the young men of the South saw no reason why, Ulster being\r\narmed and insolent, they might not become armed and self-reliant. And\r\naccordingly, without any petty distinctions of party, or class, or\r\ncreed, they decided to band themselves into a body of volunteers and\r\nthey adopted a title sanctioned in Irish history--namely, the Irish\r\nVolunteers.\r\n\r\nThe movement was publicly inaugurated at a meeting held in the\r\nRotunda, Dublin, on 25th November 1913, the leading spirits in the\r\norganisation being Captain White, D.S.O., and Sir Roger Casement, a\r\nNorthern Protestant who, knighted by England for his consular and\r\ndiplomatic services, was later to meet the death penalty at her hands\r\nfor his loyalty to his own country. The new body drew its supporters\r\nfrom Parliamentarians, Sinn Feiners, Republicans and every other class\r\nof Irish Nationalist. The manifesto it issued stated: \"The object\r\nproposed for the Irish Volunteers is to secure and maintain the rights\r\nand liberties common to all the people of Ireland. Their duties will\r\nbe defensive and protective and they will not attempt either\r\naggression or domination. Their ranks are open to all able-bodied\r\nIrishmen without distinction of creed, politics, or social grade.\" And\r\nthen it appealed \"in the name of national unity, of national dignity,\r\nof national and individual liberty, of manly citizenship to our\r\ncountrymen to recognise and accept without hesitation the opportunity\r\nthat has been granted to them to join the ranks of the Irish\r\nVolunteers and to make the movement now begun not unworthy of the\r\nhistoric title which it has adopted.\" The president of the Volunteers\r\nwas Professor John MacNeill, who had borne an honourable and\r\ndistinguished part in the Gaelic League Revival. They declared they\r\nhad nothing to fear from the Ulster Volunteers nor the Ulster\r\nVolunteers from them. They acknowledged that the Northern body had\r\nopened the way for a National Volunteer movement, but whilst at first\r\nthey were willing to cheer Sir Edward Carson because he had shown them\r\nthe way to arm, it was not long before they recognised that whilst\r\nextending courtesy to Ulster, their supreme duty was the defence of\r\nIrish liberty. For this they drilled and armed in quiet but firm\r\ndetermination. When Partition became part of the policy of the Irish\r\nParty, Mr Redmond and his friends had many warnings that the Irish\r\nVolunteers were not in existence to support the mutilation of Ireland.\r\nThey proclaimed their intention originally of placing themselves at\r\nthe disposal of an Irish Parliament, but not of the kind contemplated\r\nby the Home Rule Bill. The Irish Party saw in the Volunteers a\r\nformidable menace to their power, if not to their continued existence.\r\nThey must either control them or suppress them. Mr Redmond demanded\r\nthe right to nominate a committee of twenty-five \"true-blue\"\r\nsupporters of his own policy. The Volunteer Committee had either to\r\ndeclare war on Mr Redmond or submit to his demand. They submitted. The\r\nGovernment, who were supposed to have instigated and inspired Mr\r\nRedmond's demand, were satisfied. The reconstituted Committee called\r\nthe new body the National Volunteers.\r\n\r\nBut though the Redmondites got control of the Committee they did not\r\nsucceed in curbing the spirit of the Volunteers. And besides there was\r\nin Dublin an independent body of Volunteers entitled the Citizen Army,\r\nunder the control of Messrs Connolly and Larkin. This was purely drawn\r\nfrom the workers of the metropolis and was fiercely antagonistic to\r\nthe Ancient Order of Hibernians, which _The Irish Worker_\r\ndeclared to be \"the foulest growth that ever cursed this land,\" and\r\nagain as \"a gang of place-hunters and political thugs.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears Mr Redmond's nominees gave little assistance in arming the\r\nVolunteers, but the original members of the Committee got arms on\r\ntheir own responsibility and, imitating the exploit of the\r\n_Fanny_, they ran a cargo of rifles into Howth. The forces of the\r\nCrown, which winked at the Larne gun-running, made themselves active\r\nat Howth. The Volunteers were intercepted on their way back by a\r\nmilitary force, but succeeded in getting away with their rifles. The\r\nsoldiers, on returning to Dublin, irritated at their failure to get\r\nthe arms and provoked by a jeering crowd, fired on them, killing three\r\n(including one woman) and wounding thirty-two. \"It was,\" writes Mr\r\nRobert Lynd, \"Sir Edward Carson and Mr Bonar Law who introduced the\r\nbloody rule of the revolver into modern Ireland and the first victims\r\nwere the Dublin citizens shot down in Bachelor's Walk on the eve of\r\nthe war.\"\r\n\r\nHardly had the echoes of the Dublin street firing died down before the\r\nthunders of war were heard on the Continent. Germany had temporarily\r\ncut through the entanglements of the Irish situation, and from the\r\nisland drama across the Irish Sea the thoughts of all flew to the\r\nworld tragedy that was commencing with an entire continent for a\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\nIf the situation created by the war had been properly handled, it\r\ncould, with the exercise of a little tact and management and, it may\r\nbe, with the application of a certain pressure upon Ulster, have been\r\nturned to magnificent account for the settlement of Ireland's\r\ndifficulties and disagreements. The Home Rule Bill had not yet passed\r\ninto law. Anything was possible in regard to it. Again, however--and\r\nwith the utmost regret it must be set down--the wrong turning was\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nConfronted with a common peril, all British parties drew together in a\r\nunited effort to support the war. The Irish Party had to declare\r\nthemselves. Mr Redmond spoke in Parliament with restraint and\r\nqualification, but he made a sensation, at which probably nobody was\r\nmore surprised than himself, when he said that the Government might\r\nwithdraw all her troops from Ireland; her coasts would be defended by\r\nher armed sons and the National Volunteers would gladly co-operate\r\nwith those of Ulster in doing so. Mr Redmond might have bargained for\r\nthe immediate enactment of Home Rule or he might have remained\r\nneutral. Instead he gave a half-hearted offer of service at home, \"to\r\ndefend the shores of Ireland,\" and forthwith Sir Edward Grey\r\nproclaimed, with an applauding Empire to support him, that \"Ireland\r\nwas the one bright spot.\" Yes, but at what a cost to Ireland herself!\r\nIt is a fallacy, widely believed in, that Mr Redmond proposed a\r\ndefinite war policy. He did not. He did not at first promise a single\r\nrecruit for the front. He did not put England upon her honour even to\r\ngrant \"full self-government\" in return for Irish service. Admitted\r\nthat the Home Rule Act was on the Statute Book; but it was accompanied\r\nby a Suspensory Bill postponing its operation, and the Government\r\nlikewise gave a guarantee that an Amending Bill would be introduced to\r\nmake the measure acceptable to Ulster according to the bargain agreed\r\nto by the Irish Party surrendering the Six Counties to Carson.\r\n\r\nThe Ulster Party, on the other hand, were determined to extract the\r\nlast ounce of advantage they could out of the situation. They made no\r\npromises and gave no guarantees until they knew where they stood. When\r\nit was seen, after the war had been for a month running its untoward\r\ncourse against the Allies, that they had nothing to fear from Home\r\nRule, they told the Ulster Volunteers they were free to enlist.\r\n\r\nThe official organ of Sinn Fein and _The Irish Worker_ were\r\nagainst any Irish offer of service, but the bulk of Nationalist\r\nopinion undoubtedly favoured the Allied course on the broad grounds of\r\nits justice and righteousness. Mr William O'Brien sought to unite all\r\nIrish parties on a definite war policy. He held the view that \"however\r\nlegitimate would have been the policy of compelling England to fulfil\r\nher pledges by holding sternly aloof in her hour of necessity, the\r\npolicy of frank and instant friendship on condition of that fulfilment\r\nwould have been greatly the more effectual to make Home Rule a\r\nnecessity that could not be parried, as well as to start it under\r\nevery condition of cordiality all round.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mr Redmond and his friends missed the tide of the war opportunity\r\nas they missed all other tides. They were neither one thing nor the\r\nother. Mr Redmond spoke in Ireland in halting and hesitating fashion,\r\npublicly asking the National Volunteers to stay at home, and again\r\nmade half-hearted speeches in favour of recruiting. Mr Redmond's\r\nsupporters in Cork were not, however, as politically obtuse as he\r\nappeared to be, or perhaps as his associations with Mr Dillon\r\ncompelled him to be. Through the writer they asked Mr O'Brien to set\r\nforth a plan of united action. Mr O'Brien did so in a memorandum which\r\nsuggested that Mr Redmond should take the initiative in inviting a\r\nConference with the Irish Unionists to devise a programme of common\r\naction for the double purpose of drawing up an agreement for Home Rule\r\non a basis beyond cavil in the matter of generosity to the Irish\r\nUnionists, and, on the strength of this agreement, undertaking a joint\r\ncampaign to raise an Irish Army Corps, with its reserves, which was Mr\r\nAsquith's own measure of Ireland's just contribution. Mr O'Brien was\r\nin a position to assure Mr Redmond, and did in fact assure him, that\r\nif he took the initiative in summoning this Conference, he would have\r\nthe ready co-operation of some of the most eminent Irish Unionists who\r\nfollowed Lord Midleton three years afterwards. To this Memorandum Mr\r\nO'Brien never received any reply, and I have reason to believe that\r\nall the reply received by Mr Redmond's own supporters in Cork, who\r\nsubmitted the Memorandum to him with an expression of their own\r\napproval of its terms, was a mere formal acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nI am confident that Mr Redmond's own judgment favoured this proposal,\r\nas it did the policy of Conference and Conciliation in 1909, but that\r\nhe was overborne by the other bosses, who had him completely at their\r\nmercy and who had not the wisdom to see that this gave them a glorious\r\nand honourable way out of their manifold difficulties.\r\n\r\nThere were, meanwhile, differences at the headquarters of the National\r\nVolunteers over Mr Redmond's offer of their services \"for the defence\r\nof the shores of Ireland,\" which was made without their knowledge or\r\nconsent. They, however, passed a resolution declaring \"the complete\r\nreadiness of the Irish Volunteers to take joint action with the Ulster\r\nVolunteer Force for the defence of Ireland.\" The Prime Minister\r\npromised in Parliament that the Secretary for War would \"do everything\r\nin his power after consultation with gentlemen in Ireland, to arrange\r\nfor the full equipment and organisation of the Irish Volunteers.\" But\r\nthe War Office had other views in the matter, and though a scheme was\r\ndrawn up by General Sir Arthur Paget, Commanding the Forces in\r\nIreland, \"by which the War Office may be supplied from the Irish\r\nVolunteers with a force for the defence of Ireland,\" this scheme was\r\nimmediately rejected by the War Office authorities who, in their\r\nefforts to gain Irish recruits--and I write with perfect knowledge of\r\nthe facts--were guilty of every imaginable blunder and every possible\r\ninsult to Irish sentiment and Irish ideals.\r\n\r\nThe Ulster Volunteers, on the other hand, were allowed to retain their\r\nown officers and their own tests of admission, and were taken over,\r\nholus-bolus, as they stood; were trained in camps of their own, had\r\ntheir own banners, were kept compactly together and were recognised in\r\nevery way as a distinct unit of Army organisation. All of these\r\nprivileges were insolently refused to the Nationalists of the\r\nSouth--they were for a time employed in the paltry duty of minding\r\nbridges, but they were withdrawn from even this humiliating\r\nperformance after a short period.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile an Irish Division was called for to be composed of Southern\r\nNationalists, and with the Government guarantee that \"it would be\r\nmanned by Irishmen and officered by Irishmen.\" I had my own strong and\r\nearnest conviction about the war and the justice and righteousness of\r\nthe Allied cause. I felt, if service was offered at all, it should not\r\nbe confined to \"defence of the shores of Ireland,\" but should be given\r\nabroad where, under battle conditions, the actual issue between right\r\nand wrong would be decided. I made my own offer of service in November\r\n1914, and all the claim I make was that I was actuated by one desire\r\nand one only--to advance, humbly as may be, in myself the cause of\r\nIrish freedom. For the rest, I served and I suffered, and I\r\nsacrificed, and if the results were not all that we intended let this\r\ncredit at least be given to those of us who joined up then, that we\r\nenlisted for worthy and honourable motives and that we sought, and\r\nsought alone, the ultimate good of Ireland in doing so. Mr Redmond's\r\nfamily bore their own honourable and distinguished part in \"The Irish\r\nBrigade,\" as it came to be known, and Major \"Willie\" Redmond, when he\r\ndied on the field of France, offered his life as surely for Ireland as\r\nany man who ever died for Irish liberty.\r\n\r\nFaith was not kept with \"The Irish Brigade\" in either the manning or\r\nthe officering of it by Irishmen, and the time came when, through\r\nfailure of reserves, it was Irish more in name than in anything else,\r\nand when the gaps caused by casualties had to be filled by English\r\nrecruits. A disgusted and disappointed country turned its thoughts\r\naway from constitutional channels; and the betrayals of Ireland's\r\nhopes, and dignity and honour, which had gone on during the years,\r\nwere fast leading to their natural and inevitable Nemesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                 THE EASTER WEEK REBELLION AND AFTERWARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nA world preoccupied with the tremendous movements of mighty armies\r\nwoke up one morning and rubbed its eyes in amazement to read that a\r\nrebellion had broken out in the capital of Ireland. How did it happen?\r\nWhat did it mean? What was the cause of it? These and similar\r\nquestions were being asked, and those who were ready with an answer\r\nwere very few indeed. The marvellous thing, a matter almost incredible\r\nof belief, is that it caught the Irish Government absolutely unawares.\r\nTheir Secret Service Department might as well not have been in\r\nexistence. For the first time probably in Irish history an Irish\r\nmovement had come into being which had not a single \"informer\" in its\r\nranks. This in itself was a remarkable thing and to be noted. The\r\nleaders and their officers had accomplished the remarkable achievement\r\nof discriminating against the Secret Service agent.\r\n\r\nAlthough everything was clouded in a mist of conjecture and obscurity\r\nat the time, the causes of the Rebellion of Easter Week are now fairly\r\nclear, and may be shortly summarised. From the moment that the\r\nRedmondite Party had imposed their conditions on the Committee of the\r\nIrish Volunteers the vast bulk of the Volunteers who were not also\r\n\"Mollies\" were thoroughly dissatisfied with the arrangement. This\r\ndiscontent increased when the recruiting campaign in Ireland was\r\nconducted with calculated offence to Nationalist sentiment and\r\nself-respect, and eventually developed into a split. The members of\r\nthe original Committee as a result summoned a Volunteer Convention for\r\n25th November 1914, at which it was decided to declare: \"That Ireland\r\ncannot with honour or safety take part in foreign quarrels otherwise\r\nthan through the free action of a National Government of her own; and\r\nto repudiate the claim of any man to offer up the blood and lives of\r\nthe sons of Irishmen and Irishwomen to the service of the British\r\nEmpire while no National Government which could act and speak for the\r\npeople of Ireland is allowed to exist.\"\r\n\r\nThe new body, or rather the old, resumed the original title of the\r\nIrish Volunteers. There were also a number of other bodies entirely\r\nout of harmony with the policy of the Parliamentary Party, such as\r\nSinn Feiners, the Republicans, and the Citizen Army of Dublin's\r\nworkers organised in connection with Liberty Hall. These were all\r\nopposed to recruiting, and the extremists amongst them advocated total\r\nseparation from England as the cardinal article of their faith. A new\r\nSeparatist daily newspaper was published in Dublin under the title\r\n_Eire--Ireland_. Its attitude towards the war was that Ireland\r\nhad no cause of quarrel with the German people, or just cause of\r\noffence against them; and it was not long before the Irish Volunteers\r\ncame to be regarded by the British authorities as a \"disaffected\"\r\norganisation. Its organs in the Press were promptly suppressed, only\r\nfor others as promptly to take their place. Its officers began to be\r\ndeported without charge preferred or investigation of any sort. Fenian\r\nteachings became popular once more and \"the Old Guard\" of Ireland, who\r\nhad remained ever loyal to their early Fenian faith, must have felt a\r\npulsing of their veins when they saw the doctrines of their hot youth\r\ntake shape again. The eyes of a small but resolute minority of Irish\r\nNationalists began to see in red revolution the only hope of Irish\r\nfreedom. Physical force may appear a hopeless policy but it was at\r\nleast worth preparing for, and it may be also it would be worth the\r\ntrial. This was their creed and this the purpose that animated them.\r\nThere can be no doubt that through the medium of the old Irish\r\nRepublican Brotherhood, which had never quite died out in Ireland,\r\ncommunications were kept up with the Clan-na-Gael and other extreme\r\norganisations in the United States, and through these avenues also\r\nprobably with Germany. Indeed the German Foreign Office, quite early\r\nin the war, at the instigation of Sir Roger Casement had declared\r\nformally \"that Germany would not invade Ireland with any intentions of\r\nconquest or of the destruction of any institutions.\" If they did land\r\nin the course of the war, they would come \"inspired by good will\r\ntowards a land and a people for whom Germany only wishes national\r\nprosperity and freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThe avowedly revolutionary party gained a great accession of strength\r\nwhen Mr P.H. Pearse and Mr James Connolly composed certain differences\r\nand united the workers in the Citizen Army with the Irish Volunteers.\r\nMr Pearse was now the leader of the latter organisation--a man of high\r\nintellectual attainments, single-minded purpose, and austere\r\ncharacter. \"For many years,\" writes Mr Henry, \"his life seems to have\r\nbeen passed in the grave shadow of the sacrifice he felt that he was\r\ncalled upon to make for Ireland. He believed that he was appointed to\r\ntread the path that Robert Emmet and Wolfe Tone had trodden before\r\nhim, and his life was shaped so that it might be worthy of its end.\"\r\n\r\nSeparation as the only road to independence was the burden of Pearse's\r\nteaching. It was his definite purpose to do something which, by the\r\nsplendour of the sacrifice involved, would rouse Ireland out of its\r\nnational apathy and national stupor. He and his associates believed,\r\nas a writer in _Nationality_ declared: \"We have the material, the\r\nmen and stuff of war, the faith and purpose and cause for\r\nrevolution.... We shall have Ireland illumined with a light before\r\nwhich even the Martyrs' will pale: the light of Freedom, of a deed\r\ndone and action taken and a blow struck for the Old Land.\" It was in\r\nthis faith they went forth to their sacrifice. \"On Palm Sunday 1916,\"\r\nwrites Mr Henry, \"the Union of Irish Labour and Irish Nationality was\r\nproclaimed in a striking fashion. In the evening of that day Connolly\r\nhoisted over Liberty Hall, the headquarters of the Citizen Army, the\r\nIrish tricolour of orange, white, and green, the flag designed by the\r\nYoung Irelanders in 1848 to symbolise the union of the Orange and\r\nGreen by the white bond of a common brotherhood. On Easter Monday the\r\nIrish Republic was proclaimed in Arms in Dublin.\"\r\n\r\nNow there are many considerations that could be usefully discussed in\r\nrelation to the Easter Week Rebellion, but this is not the time or\r\nplace for them. Let it be made clear, however, that the Rising was not\r\nthe work of Sinn Fein, but of the leaders of the Irish Volunteers and\r\nthe Citizen Army. It would be a pretty subject of inquiry to know how\r\nSinn Fein got the credit for the Rising and why the title was given to\r\nthe new movement that came into being afterwards. My own view is that\r\nthe British journalists who swarmed into Ireland are chiefly\r\nresponsible for the designation. _Sinn Fein_ was a fine mouthful\r\nfor their British readers to swallow, and so they gave it to them. Be\r\nthis as it may, the Rebellion came to be referred to as the Sinn Fein\r\nRebellion, and the movement to which it gave birth has ever since\r\nassumed the same name. It is not my intention to dwell on the grave\r\nincidents that followed, the prolonged agony of \"the shootings of the\r\nRebel leaders,\" the assassination of Mr Sheehy-Skeffington, the\r\nindecent scenes in the House of Commons when the Nationalist members\r\nbehaved themselves with sad lack of restraint--cheering Mr Birrell's\r\nprediction that \"the Irish people would never regard the Dublin\r\nRebellion with the same feelings with which they regarded previous\r\nrebellions,\" cheering still more loudly when, in response to Sir\r\nEdward Carson's invitation to Mr Redmond to join him in \"denouncing\r\nand putting down those Rebels for evermore,\" Mr Redmond expressed, to\r\nthe amazement of all Nationalist Ireland, his \"horror and detestation\"\r\nof Irishmen who, however mistaken they may be--and history has yet to\r\ndecide this--at least \"poured out their blood like heroes--as they\r\nbelieved and as millions of their countrymen now believe for Ireland\"\r\n(Mr William O'Brien). Mr Dillon, needless to say, flung his leader\r\noverboard on this occasion without the slightest truth. He declared he\r\nhad never stood on a recruiting platform (which was not true!) and\r\nthat he never would do so, and accused the Government and the soldiers\r\nof washing out the life-work of the Nationalists in \"a sea of blood.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government were at their wits' end what to do. Mr Birrell, the\r\namiable and inefficient Chief Secretary, had to go. Mr Asquith went\r\nover to Ireland on a tour of investigation and returned to Westminster\r\nwith two dominant impressions: (1) the breakdown of the existing\r\nmachinery of Irish Government; (2) the strength and depth, almost the\r\nuniversality, of the feeling in Ireland that there was a unique\r\nopportunity for the settlement of outstanding problems and for a\r\ncombined effort to obtain an agreement as to the way in which the\r\ngovernment of Ireland was to be carried on for the future. He\r\nannounced that Mr Lloyd George had undertaken, at the request of his\r\ncolleagues, to devote his time and energy to the promotion of an Irish\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly \"the machinery of Government had broken down.\" But the\r\nGovernment of England had taken no account of what was happening in\r\nIreland--of the veritable wave of passion that swept the country\r\nafter, the \"executions\" of the Rebel leaders, of the manner in which\r\nthis passion was fanned and flamed by the arrest and deportation of\r\nthousands of young men all over the country, who were believed to be\r\nprominently identified with the Volunteer Movement, of the unrest that\r\nwas caused by the reports that a number of the peaceable citizens of\r\nDublin were deliberately shot without cause by the troops during the\r\nmilitary occupation of the city. What wonder that there was a strong\r\nand even fierce revulsion of feeling! And this was not reserved\r\naltogether for the Government. The Irish Parliamentarians had their\r\nown fair share of it. The process of disillusionment now rapidly set\r\nin. That portion of the country that had not already completely lost\r\nfaith in the Party and in Parliamentary methods was fast losing it. It\r\nonly required that the Party should once again give its unqualified\r\nassent, as it did, to Mr Lloyd George's \"Headings of Agreement,\" which\r\nprovided for the partition of Ireland and the definite exclusion of\r\nthe six counties of Down, Antrim, Londonderry, Armagh, Monaghan and\r\nTyrone, to send it down into the nethermost depths of popular favour\r\nand the whole-hearted contempt of every self-respecting man of the\r\nIrish race. The collapse of Parliamentarianism was now complete. There\r\nwas no Nationalist of independent spirit left in Ireland who would\r\neven yield it lip service. Irish public bodies which a year or two\r\npreviously were the obedient vehicles of Party manipulation were now\r\nunanimous in denouncing any form of partition. The proposals for\r\nsettlement definitely failed, and the machinery of Irish Government\r\nwhich had \"broken down\" was set up afresh and the discredited\r\nadministration of Dublin Castle fully restored by the appointment of\r\nMr Duke, a Unionist, as Chief Secretary for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe war was not going at all well for the Allies. America was still\r\nhesitating on the brink as to whether she would come in or remain\r\nsteadfastly aloof. The Asquithian Ministry had been manoeuvred out of\r\noffice under circumstances which it will be the joy of the historian\r\nto deal with when all the documents and facts are available. That\r\ninteresting and candid diarist, Colonel Repington, under date 3rd\r\nDecember 1916, writes:\r\n\r\n\"Last Friday began a great internal crisis, when L.G. [Lloyd George]\r\nwrote to the P.M. [Asquith] that he could not go on unless our methods\r\nof waging war were speeded up. He proposed a War Council of three,\r\nincluding himself, Bonar Law and Carson. The two latter are with him,\r\nwhich means the Unionists too.\"\r\n\r\nAsquith resigned, the Coalition Ministry was formed, and it is\r\nprobably more than a surmise that the part played by Sir Edward Carson\r\nin bringing about this result and in elevating Mr Lloyd George into\r\nthe Premiership explains much of the power he has exercised over him\r\never since. Mr Redmond and Sir Edward Carson were both invited to join\r\nthe Coalition. The former declined, the latter accepted, and from his\r\nposition of power within the Cabinet was able to torpedo Home Rule at\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nAnd thus came to an end in Ireland as gross a tyranny perpetrated in\r\nthe sacred name of Nationality as ever disgraced our annals. The Party\r\nwhich had so long held power had destroyed themselves by years of\r\nselfish blundering. The country was growing weary of the men who\r\nkilled land purchase, constituted themselves the mere dependents of an\r\nEnglish Party in exchange for boundless jobbery, intensified the alarm\r\nof Ulster by transferring all power and patronage to a pseudo-Catholic\r\nsecret organisation, and crowned their incompetence by accepting a\r\nmiserably inadequate Home Rule Bill (with Partition twice over thrown\r\nin). The country which had been shackled into silence by the terrorist\r\nmethods of the Board of Erin (which made the right of free meeting\r\nimpossible by the use of their batons, bludgeons and revolvers) was\r\nemancipated by the Dublin Rising. And in the scale of things it must\r\nbe counted, for the young men who risked their lives in Easter Week,\r\nnot the least of their performances that they gave back to the people\r\nof Ireland the right of thinking and acting for themselves. How well\r\nthey used this right to exact a full measure of retribution from the\r\nParty that had betrayed them the General Election of 1918 abundantly\r\nshows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n              THE IRISH CONVENTION AND THE CONSCRIPTION OF\r\n                                 IRELAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time had now come when the Irish Party had to taste all the\r\nbitterness of actual and anticipated defeat. Several Irish newspapers\r\nhad gone over to Sinn Fein. _The Irish Independent_ had been\r\npreviously a fearless critic of the Party, and the defeat of the\r\nPartition proposals was largely due to the manner in which they had\r\ndenounced them and exposed their real character.\r\n\r\nA bye-election took place in North Roscommon. There was a straight\r\nfight between the Parliamentary Party and Sinn Fein and the former\r\nwere defeated by an overwhelming majority. Another trial of strength\r\ncame soon afterwards, and the Party again bit the dust. The\r\nCoalitionists had now turned a cold shoulder to the Party. They could\r\nget along very well without them. They had got all they could out of\r\nthem for war purposes. They foresaw their approaching defeat, and they\r\ndid not, therefore, count on their scheme of things as a force to be\r\nconciliated or to be afraid of. And as if to ensure the complete\r\ndownfall and overthrow of the Party the Government continued their\r\narrests and deportations.\r\n\r\nThe Party had to \"demonstrate\" in some way and they hit upon the device\r\nof withdrawing from Parliament and sending a Manifesto to the United\r\nStates and the self-governing dominions. But whilst they paid _Sinn\r\nFein_ the compliment of adopting their policy of Parliamentary\r\nabstention, they neither honestly kept away nor openly remained--asking\r\nquestions and sending ambassadors from time to time. _Sinn Fein_ was not\r\ninactive either. It summoned a Convention to meet in Dublin to assert\r\nthe independence of Ireland, its status as a nation and its right to\r\nrepresentation at the Peace Conference.\r\n\r\nThe Government was still faced with a reluctant and undecided America,\r\nand it became essential for \"propaganda purposes\" to do something of\r\nfair seeming on the Irish Question. The Prime Minister accordingly\r\nrevived the old Partition proposals, but these were now dead and\r\ndamned by all parties, the Roscommon, Longford and East Clare\r\nvictories of Sinn Fein having brought the Irish Party to disown their\r\ntwice-repeated bargain for Partition. He then proposed as an\r\nalternative that an Irish Convention, composed of representative\r\nIrishmen, should assemble to deliberate upon the best means of\r\ngoverning their own country.\r\n\r\nThe All-for-Ireland Party were asked to nominate representatives to\r\nthis Convention, as were also Sinn Fein. In reply Mr O'Brien stated\r\nfour essential conditions of success: (1) a Conference of ten or a\r\ndozen persons known to intend peace; (2) a prompt agreement, making\r\nevery conceivable concession to Ulster, with the one reservation that\r\npartition in any shape or form was inadmissible and unthinkable; (3)\r\nthe immediate submission of the agreement to a Referendum of the Irish\r\npeople (never before consulted upon a definite proposal); (4) if any\r\nconsiderable minority of irreconcilables still uttered threats of an\r\nUlster rebellion a bold appeal of the Government to the British\r\nelectorate at a General Election to declare once and for all between\r\nthe claims of reason and justice and the incorrigibility of Ulster.\r\n\r\nOne panel of names which Mr O'Brien submitted to the Cabinet at their\r\nrequest was: The Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Protestant Primate, the\r\nCatholic Archbishop of Dublin, the Marquess of Londonderry, the\r\nMarquess of Ormonde, General Sir Hubert Gough, Major \"Willie\" Redmond,\r\nM.P., the Earl of Shaftesbury, the Earl of Dunraven, Viscount\r\nNorthcliffe, Mr William Martin Murphy, Mr Hugh Barrie, M.P., and two\r\nrepresentatives of Sinn Fein. Mr O'Brien was in a position to\r\nguarantee that at a Conference thus constituted Sinn Fein would not be\r\nunrepresented. Instead of setting up a Conference of this character,\r\nwhich it is now clear would not have separated without coming to an\r\nagreement, the proposal was set aside--whether by Mr Lloyd George or\r\nby Mr Redmond's advisers has yet to be revealed--and an Irish\r\nConvention composed of nominated representatives was constituted,\r\nwhich had no possibility of agreement except an agreement on the lines\r\nof Partition and which was doubtless planned and conceived for the\r\npurpose of fooling Ireland and America and keeping the Convention\r\n\"talking\" for nine months until America was wiled into the war.\r\n\r\nThe Convention could by no possibility succeed, and my belief is it\r\nwas never intended to succeed. It was numerically unwieldy.\r\nNine-tenths of its representation was drawn from the Ulster Party's\r\nand the Irish Party's supporters, both of whom were pledged in advance\r\nto the Partition settlement, and as far as the Irish Party\r\nrepresentation was concerned the last thing that could be said of it\r\nwas that it was representative. Of the seventy-five Redmondites who\r\ncomposed three-fourths of the Convention only one escaped rejection by\r\nhis constituents as soon as the electors had their say! The Convention\r\nlaboured under the still further disadvantage of being at the mercy of\r\nan Orange veto, which makes one wonder how it was that Mr Redmond or\r\nhis party ever submitted to it. The Ulster delegates to the Convention\r\nwere under the control of an outside body--the Ulster Orange Council.\r\nThey could decide nothing without reference to this body, and hence\r\nthe Convention was in the perfectly humiliating position of carrying\r\non its proceedings subject to an outside Orange veto.\r\n\r\nNeither the All-for-Ireland Party nor Sinn Fein was represented at the\r\nConvention, although Mr Lloyd George made a second appeal to Mr\r\nO'Brien to assist in its deliberations. It says something for the\r\nwisdom of Mr O'Brien's proposal for a small Conference that after\r\ndebating the matter for months the Convention decided to transmit\r\ntheir powers to a Committee of Nine to draw up terms of agreement.\r\nThis Committee did actually reach agreement, only to have it squelched\r\ninstantly by the veto of the Ulster Council when the Ulster nominees\r\nreported the terms of it to them. Lord MacDonnell, in a letter to\r\n_The Times_, dated 2nd November 1919, makes the following\r\ndisclosure regarding Mr Redmond's view of this matter:--\r\n\r\n\"In regard to this episode I well remember the late Mr Redmond saying\r\nin conversation that if he had foreseen the possibility of a proposal\r\nmade there being submitted for judgment to men who had not\r\nparticipated in the Convention's proceedings, and were removed from\r\nits pervading atmosphere of good will, he would never have consented\r\nto enter it.\"\r\n\r\nMr O'Brien, however, saw this danger in advance and drew public\r\nattention to it. In a speech in the House of Commons he also foretold\r\nwhat the failure of the Convention meant: the destruction of the\r\nconstitutional movement and the setting up of \"the right of rebellion,\r\nwhether from the Covenanters or Sinn Feiners as the only arbiter left\r\nin Irish affairs. You will justly make Parliamentary methods more\r\ndespised and detested than they are at the present moment by the young\r\nmen of Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Convention failed to reach unanimity. It presented various\r\nreports, and the Government, glad of so easy a way out, simply did\r\nnothing. The Convention served the Ministerial purpose, and there was\r\nan end of it. The proceedings were, however, notable for one tragic\r\nincident. Mr Redmond sought to rally the majority of the Convention in\r\nsupport of a compromise which, whilst falling short of Dominion Home\r\nRule, avoided partition and would have been acceptable to Southern\r\nUnionist opinion. Mr Devlin and the Catholic Bishops opposed Mr\r\nRedmond's motion and the Irish leader, feeling himself deserted at the\r\nmost critical moment, did not move, and withdrew from the Convention\r\nto his death, adding another to the long list of tragic figures in\r\nIrish history.\r\n\r\nThe only practical outcome of the Convention was the acceptance of\r\nDominion Home Rule by a minority, which included Mr Devlin. As if to\r\nmake matters as impracticable as possible for the Parliamentarians, Mr\r\nLloyd George introduced a Bill to conscript Ireland at the very time\r\nthe Convention proposals were before Parliament. A more callous\r\nindifference to Irish psychology could scarcely be imagined. A series\r\nof Sinn Fein victories at the polls had decided the fate of Partition\r\nonce and for all. But the war exigencies of the Government were so\r\ngreat, the military situation on the Continent was so hazardous, they\r\nseemed determined to risk even civil war in their resolve to get\r\nIrishmen to serve. They must have fighting men at any cost. The menace\r\nwas very real, and the whole of Nationalist Ireland came together as\r\none man to resist it. The representatives of the Irish Party, of\r\nLabour, of Sinn Fein and of the All-for-Irelanders met in Conference\r\nat the Mansion House, Dublin, to concert measures of Irish defence.\r\nThe Mansion House Conference, at its first meeting, on 18th April,\r\nissued the following declaration:--\r\n\r\n\"Taking our stand on Ireland's separate and distinct nationhood, and\r\naffirming the principle of liberty, that the Governments of nations\r\nderive their just powers from the consent of the governed, we deny the\r\nright of the British Government or any external authority to impose\r\ncompulsory military service in Ireland against the clearly expressed\r\nwill of the Irish people. The passing of the Conscription Bill by the\r\nBritish House of Commons must be regarded as a declaration of war on\r\nthe Irish nation. The alternative to accepting it as such is to\r\nsurrender our liberties and to acknowledge ourselves slaves. It is in\r\ndirect violation of the rights of small nationalities to\r\nself-determination, which even the Prime Minister of England--now\r\npreparing to employ naked militarism and force his Act upon\r\nIreland--himself announced as an essential condition for peace at the\r\nPeace Congress. The attempt to enforce it is an unwarrantable\r\naggression, which we call upon all Irishmen to resist by the most\r\neffective means at their disposal.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish Catholic Bishops on the same day received a deputation from\r\nthe Mansion House Conference, and, having heard them, issued a\r\nmanifesto, in the course of which they said:\r\n\r\n\"In view especially of the historic relations between the two\r\ncountries from the very beginning up to this moment, we consider that\r\nConscription forced in this way upon Ireland is an oppressive and\r\ninhuman law, which the Irish people have a right to resist by every\r\nmeans that are consonant with the law of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish Labour Party called a one-day strike on 23rd April as \"a\r\ndemonstration of fealty to the cause of labour and Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Government went on with its preparations for enforcing\r\nConscription. The Lord-Lieutenant, who was known to be opposed to the\r\npolicy of the Ministry, was recalled, and Field-Marshal Lord French\r\nwas put in his place. A \"German plot,\" which the late Viceroy declared\r\nhad no existence in fact, was supposed to be discovered, and in\r\nconnection with it Messrs de Valera and A. Griffith, the two Sinn Fein\r\nmembers of the Mansion House Conference, were arrested and deported.\r\nThe Sinn Fein, the Gaelic League and allied organisations were\r\ndeclared to be \"dangerous associations.\" Concerts, hurling matches,\r\netc., were prohibited, and Ireland was frankly treated as an occupied\r\nterritory. A bye-election occurred in East Cavan and Mr\r\nGriffith--England's prisoner--was returned, defeating a nominee of the\r\nIrish Party. This gave the death-blow to Conscription, though Ireland\r\nstill stood sternly on guard.\r\n\r\nThe Mansion House Conference during its existence held a position of\r\nunique authority in the country. During its sittings a proposal was\r\nmade to initiate negotiations with a view to combined action between\r\nSinn Fein, the two sections of Parliamentary Nationalists and the\r\nIrish Labour bodies, on the basis of the concession of Dominion Home\r\nRule, while the war was still proceeding with the alternative, if the\r\nconcession were refused, of combined action to enforce the claims of\r\nIreland at the Peace Conference. There was reason to believe Sinn Fein\r\nwould agree to this proposal, and that the Cabinet would have invited\r\nthe Dominion Premiers' Conference to intervene in favour of an Irish\r\nsettlement, limited only by the formula: \"within the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nMr Dillon blocked the way with the technical objection that the\r\nConference was called to discuss Conscription alone and that no other\r\ntopic must be permitted to go further. Could stupid malignancy or\r\nblind perversity go further?\r\n\r\nThis fair chance was lost, with so many others. The war came to an end\r\nand a few weeks afterwards the Irish Parliamentary Party, which had so\r\nlong played shuttlecock with the national destinies of Ireland, went\r\nto crashing doom and disaster at the polls. The country had found them\r\nout for what they were, and it cast them into that outer darkness from\r\nwhich, for them, there is no returning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                    \"THE TIMES\" AND IRISH SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nNo volume, professing to deal however cursorily with the events of the\r\nperiod, can ignore the profound influence of _The Times_ as a\r\nfactor in promoting an Irish settlement. That this powerful organ of\r\nopinion--so long arrayed in deadly hostility to Ireland--should have\r\nin recent years given sympathetic ear to her sufferings and\r\ndisabilities is an event of the most tremendous significance, and it\r\nis not improbable that the Irish administration in these troubled\r\nyears would have been even more deplorably vicious than it has been\r\nwere it not that _The Times_ showed the way to other independent\r\njournals in England in vigilant criticism and fearless exposure of\r\nofficial wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nWhen, on St Patrick's Day, 1917, Lord Northcliffe spoke at the Irish\r\nClub in London on the urgency of an Irish settlement and on the need\r\nfor the economic and industrial development of the country, and when\r\nhe proclaimed himself an Irish-born man with \"a strong strain of Irish\r\nblood\" in him, he did a sounder day's work for Ireland than he\r\nimagined, for he shattered a tradition of evil association which for\r\ngenerations had linked the name of a great English newspaper with\r\nunrelenting opposition to Ireland's historic claim for independence.\r\nIf Ireland had been then approached in the generous spirit of Lord\r\nNorthcliffe's speech, if the investigation into Irish self-government\r\nfor which he pleaded had then taken place, if British statesmen had\r\nmade \"a supreme effort,\" as he begged them to do, \"to find good\r\ngovernment for Ireland,\" I am convinced that all the horrors and\r\nmanifold disasters of the past four years would have been avoided, and\r\nthe Irish people would be at this moment in happiness and contentment\r\nadministering their own affairs. But the voice of sweet reasonableness\r\nand statesmanlike admonition was not hearkened unto. The neglect of\r\nIreland and of her industrial concerns, of which Lord Northcliffe so\r\njustly made complaint, continued, and instead of the counsels of peace\r\nprevailing all the follies of wrong methods and repressive courses\r\nwere committed which will leave enduring memories of bitterness and\r\nbroken faith long after a settlement is reached. Meanwhile _The\r\nTimes_ devoted itself earnestly and assiduously to the cause of\r\npeace and justice. It opened its columns to the expression of reasoned\r\nopinion on the Irish case. The problem of settlement was admittedly\r\none of extreme difficulty--it welcomed discussion and consideration of\r\nevery feasible plan in the hope that some _via media_ might be\r\nfound which would constitute a basis of comparative agreement between\r\nthe various warring factors. It even instituted independent inquiries\r\nof its own and gave an exhaustive and splendidly impartial survey of\r\nthe whole Irish situation and of the various influences,\r\npsychological, religious and material, that made the question one of\r\nsuch complexity and so implacably unyielding in many of its features.\r\nIts pressure upon the Government was continuous and consistent, but\r\nthe Government was deaf to wisdom and dumb to a generous importunity.\r\nNot content with appeal, remonstrance and exhortation, _The\r\nTimes_, in the summer of 1919, boldly, and with a courage that was\r\ngreatly daring in the circumstances of the moment, set forth in all\r\ndetail, and with a vigorous clearness that was most praiseworthy, its\r\nown plan of settlement. As it was upon this model that the Ministry\r\nlater built its Government of Ireland Act, I think it well to quote\r\n_The Times_, own summary of its scheme, though it is but proper\r\nto say that whilst the Government adapted the model it discarded\r\neverything else that was useful and workmanlike in the structure:\r\n\r\n                          _Legislatures_\r\n\r\nCreation by an Act of Settlement of two State Legislatures for\r\n\r\n(a) The whole of Ulster,\r\n\r\n(b) The rest of Ireland,\r\n\r\nwith full powers of legislation in all matters affecting the internal\r\naffairs of their respective States. In each State there will be a\r\nState Executive responsible to the State Legislature.\r\n\r\nBy the same Act of Settlement, the creation of an All-Ireland\r\nParliament on the basis of equal representation of the two\r\nStates--_i.e.,_ Ulster is to have as many representatives as the\r\nrest of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe All-Ireland Parliament to be a Single Chamber which may sit\r\nalternately at Dublin and Belfast.\r\n\r\n                             _Powers_\r\n\r\nGoverning powers not conferred on the State Legislatures will be\r\ndivided between the All-Ireland and the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Parliament will retain such powers as those involving the\r\nCrown and the Succession; peace and war; the armed forces.\r\n\r\nTo the All-Ireland Parliament may be delegated, _inter alia_, the\r\npowers involving direct taxation, Customs and Excise, commercial\r\ntreaties (with possible exceptions), land purchase, and education. The\r\ndelegation may take place by stages.\r\n\r\n                            _Executive_\r\n\r\nUpon the assumption of the Irish Parliament of any or all of the\r\npowers transferred from the Imperial Parliament, an All-Ireland\r\nExecutive, responsible to the All-Ireland Parliament, will come into\r\nbeing. The Office of Lord Lieutenant, shorn of its political\r\ncharacter, will continue. The Lord Lieutenant will have the right of\r\nveto on Irish and State legislation, and may be assisted by the Irish\r\nPrivy Council.\r\n\r\n                           _Safeguards_\r\n\r\nTo safeguard the liberties of both States, each State Legislature is\r\nto have a permanent veto upon the application of its own State of any\r\nlegislation passed by an All-Ireland Parliament.\r\n\r\n                  _Representation at Westminster_\r\n\r\nIreland will be still represented at Westminster by direct election.\r\nThe number of representatives to the Commons is to be determined on\r\nthe basis of population relative to that of Great Britain. Irish\r\nrepresentative peers will retain their seats in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n                     _Constitutional Disputes_\r\n\r\nConstitutional disputes between the Imperial and Irish Parliament will\r\nbe decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council; those\r\nbetween the Irish Parliament and State Legislatures by an Irish\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\n                             _Finance_\r\n\r\nIn the financial section of the scheme, the case for the over-taxation\r\nof Ireland is considered, but it is urged that, while due account\r\nshould be taken of this circumstance in any plan for financial\r\nreconstruction, Ireland ought not to be relieved of her proper share\r\nof the cost of the war or of liability for her share of the National\r\nDebt.\r\n\r\nIreland is to contribute an annual sum to the Imperial Exchequer,\r\ncalculated on the relative taxable capacity of Ireland. This will\r\ncover interest on the Irish share of the National Debt and a\r\ncontribution to the Sinking Fund, as well as to defence and other\r\nImperial expenditure.\r\n\r\nI do not intend to subject the foregoing scheme to any detailed\r\ncriticism. The method of constituting the All-Ireland Parliament was\r\nopen to grave objection. It was to be a single chamber legislature and\r\nwas to be selected or nominated rather than elected. This damned it\r\nright away from the democratic standpoint, and the defence of _The\r\nTimes_ that \"the system of delegations would probably have the\r\nadvantage of being the simplest inasmuch as it would avoid\r\ncomplicating the electoral machinery\" was not very forceful. The\r\nsupreme test to be applied to any plan of Irish Government is whether\r\nit provides, beyond yea or nay, for the absolute unity of Ireland as\r\none distinct nation. Unless this essential unity is recognised all\r\nproposals for settlement, no matter how generous in intent otherwise,\r\nmust fail. Mr Lloyd George grossly offended Irish sentiment when he\r\nflippantly declared that Ireland was not one nation but two nations.\r\nThis is the kind of foolishness that makes one despair at times of\r\nBritish good sense, not to speak of British statesmanship. Mr Asquith,\r\nwhatever his political blunderings--and they were many and grievous in\r\nthe case of Ireland--declared in 1912:--\"I have always maintained and\r\nI maintain as strongly to-day that Ireland is a nation--not two\r\nnations but one nation.\" And those Prime Ministers of another day--Mr\r\nGladstone and Mr Disraeli--were equally emphatic in recognising that\r\nIreland was one distinct nation.\r\n\r\n_The Times_ itself saw the folly of partition, for it wrote\r\n(24th July 1919):\r\n\r\n\"The burden of finding a solution rests squarely upon the shoulders of\r\nthe British Government, and they must bear it until at least the\r\nbeginnings have been found. Some expedients have found favour among\r\nthose who realise the urgency of an Irish settlement, but have neither\r\nopportunity nor inclination closely to study the intricacies of the\r\nquestion. One such expedient is partition in the form of the total\r\nexclusion from the operations of any Irish settlement of the whole or\r\na part of Ulster. Far more cogent reasons than any yet adduced, and\r\nfar more certainty that every other path had been explored to the end,\r\nwould be needed to render this expedient other than superficially\r\nplausible. Politically there are acute differences between Ulster and\r\nthe rest of Ireland; economically they are closely interwoven.\r\nEconomic bonds are stronger than constitutional devices. The partition\r\nof Ireland would limit the powers of a Southern parliament so\r\nseverely, and would leave so little room for development, that it\r\nwould preclude any adequate realisation of Nationalist hopes. For\r\ninstance, fiscal autonomy for the Southern provinces could be enjoyed\r\nat the price of a Customs barrier round the excluded Ulster Counties.\r\nYet to Irish Nationalists fiscal autonomy is the symbol of freedom.\r\nHowever speciously it may be attired, partition offers no hope of a\r\npermanent settlement.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough _The Times_ specifically denounced partition its\r\nproposals undoubtedly perpetuated the partition idea and were thus\r\nrepugnant to national opinion. Its plan also suggested a settlement by\r\nprocess of gradual evolution, but Ireland had progressed far beyond\r\nthe point when any step-by-step scheme stood the slightest chance of\r\nsuccess. Credit must, however, be given to it for its generous\r\nintentions, for the magnificent spirit of fair play it has shown ever\r\nsince towards a sadly stricken land and for what it has done and is\r\nstill doing to find peace and healing for the wrongs and sufferings of\r\nan afflicted race. For all these things Ireland is deeply grateful,\r\nwith the gratitude that does not readily forget, and it may be that\r\nwhen all this storm and stress, and the turbulent passions of an evil\r\nepoch have passed away, it will be remembered then for Englishmen that\r\ntheir greatest organ in the Press maintained a fine tradition of\r\nindependence, and thus did much to redeem the good name of Britain\r\nwhen \"the Black and Tans\" were dragging it woefully in the mire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                           THE ISSUES NOW AT STAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now my appointed task draws to its close. In the pages I have\r\nwritten I have set nothing down in malice nor have I sought otherwise\r\nthan to make a just presentment of facts as they are within my\r\nknowledge. It may be that, being a protagonist of one Party in the\r\nstruggles and vicissitudes of these years, I may sometimes see things\r\ntoo much from the standpoint of my own preconceived opinions and\r\nnotions. But on the whole it has been my endeavour to give an honest\r\nand fair-minded narrative of the main events and movements of Irish\r\nhistory over a period in which I believe I can claim I am the first\r\nexplorer. There are some subjects which would come properly within the\r\npurview of my title, such as the power, province and influence of\r\nclericalism in politics, but I have thought it best at this stage,\r\nwhen so many matters are in process of readjustment in Ireland, and\r\nwhen our people are adapting themselves to a new form of citizen duty\r\nand responsibility, to leave certain aspects of our public life\r\nuntouched. It may be, however, if this book meets with the success I\r\nhope for it, that my researches and labours in this field of\r\nenterprise are not at an end.\r\n\r\nAll I have now to do in this my final chapter is to summarise some of\r\nthe issues that present themselves for our consideration. I do not\r\npropose to deal with the activities of Sinn Fein since it won its\r\nredoubtable victory over the forces of Parliamentarianism as\r\nrepresented by the Irish Party at the General Election. The country\r\nturned to it as its only avenue of salvation from a reign of\r\ncorruption, incompetence and helplessness unparalleled in history. Mr\r\nO'Brien and his friends of the All-for-Ireland League, of their own\r\nvolition, effaced themselves at the General Election. They had striven\r\nthrough fifteen long years, against overwhelming odds and most\r\nunscrupulous and malignant forces, for a policy of reason and for the\r\nprinciples of Conference, Conciliation and Consent, as between all\r\nIrish-born men and a combination of all parties, Irish and British,\r\nfor the purpose of effecting a broad and generous National settlement.\r\nHad they received that support which the events of the last two years\r\ndemonstrates could have been had--had the moderate Irish Unionists,\r\nand especially the Southern Irish Unionists, the moral courage to\r\ndeclare their views, temperately but unequivocally, as Lord Midleton\r\nand others have recently declared them, the tide might easily have\r\nbeen turned and wiser counsels and policies prevailed.\r\n\r\nIf the great peace pronouncement of Cork City merchants and professional\r\nmen, made a few months ago on the initiative of Alderman Beamish, had\r\nonly been arranged when the All-for-Ireland League was founded; if Lord\r\nBandon had then held the meeting of Deputy-Lieutenants he recently\r\nconvened to declare for Home Rule; if Lord Shaftesbury, three times Lord\r\nMayor of Belfast, had then made the speech he made at the Dublin Peace\r\nConference last year, nothing could have resisted the triumph of the\r\npolicy of Conciliation, and Ireland would be now in enjoyment of\r\nresponsible self-government instead of being ravaged as it is by the\r\nsavagery of a civil war, in which all the usages of modern warfare have\r\nbeen ruthlessly abandoned. It is also to be deplored that Sir Horace\r\nPlunkett, who is now the enthusiastic advocate of Dominion Home Rule\r\n(and, indeed, believes himself to be the discoverer of it), did not,\r\nduring all the years when he could potently influence certain channels\r\nof opinion in England, raise his voice either for the agrarian\r\nsettlement or for Home Rule and refused his support, when he was\r\nChairman of the Irish Convention, to Mr W.M. Murphy's well-meant efforts\r\nto get Dominion Home Rule adopted or even discussed by the Convention.\r\n\r\nOf course this much must be said for the Unionists who have pronounced\r\nin favour of Home Rule within the past few years, that they could plead\r\nfairly enough that every man like Lord Dunraven, Mr Moreton Frewen, Lord\r\nRossmore, Colonel Hutcheson-Poë, and Mr Lindsay Crawford, who came upon\r\nthe All-for-Ireland platform from the first, was foully assailed and\r\ntraduced and had his motives impugned by the Board of Erin bosses, and\r\nother Unionists, more timid, naturally enough, shrank from incurring a\r\nsimilar fate.\r\n\r\nBut these things are of the past, and we would turn our thoughts to\r\nthe present and the future.\r\n\r\nThe country, at the General Election of 1918, by a vote so\r\noverwhelming as to be practically unanimous, gave the guardianship of\r\nits national faith and honour into the keeping of Sinn Fein. This is\r\nthe dominant fact of the situation from the Irish standpoint. Other\r\nconsiderations there are, but any which leave this out of account fail\r\nto grip the vital factor which must influence our march towards a just\r\nand durable Irish settlement. Another fact that cannot be lost sight\r\nof is that there is a Home Rule Act on the Statute Book. With this\r\nSouthern Ireland will have nothing to do! Unionists and Nationalists\r\nalike condemn it as a mockery of their national rights. But the\r\nOrangeman of the Six Counties are first seriously going to work their\r\nregional autonomy--they are going to set up their Parliament in\r\nBelfast. And once set up it will be a new and vital complication of\r\nthe situation preceding a settlement which will embrace the whole of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nSo far as Ireland is concerned the public mind is occupied at the\r\nmoment of my writing with the question of \"reprisals.\" Various efforts\r\nhave been made to bring about peace. They have failed because, in my\r\nview, they have been reluctant to recognise and make allowance for\r\ncertain essential facts. The whole blame for the existing state of\r\ncivil war--for, repudiate it as the Government may, such it\r\nundoubtedly is--is thrown on the shoulders of the Irish Republican\r\nArmy by those who take their ethical standard from Sir Hamar\r\nGreenwood. It is forgotten that for two or three years before the\r\nattacks on the Royal Irish Constabulary began there were no murders,\r\nno assassinations and no civil war in Ireland. There was, however, a\r\ncampaign of gross provocation by Dublin Castle for two reasons: (1) by\r\nway of vengeance for their defeat on the Conscription issue; (2) as a\r\nretaliation on Sinn Fein, because it had succeeded in peacefully\r\nsupplanting English rule by a system of Volunteer Police, Sinn Fein\r\nCourts, Sinn Fein Local Government, etc. The only pretext on which\r\nthis provocation was pursued was on account of a mythical \"German\r\nplot,\" which Lord Wimbourne never heard of, which Sir Bryan Mahon,\r\nCommander-in-Chief, told Lord French he flatly disbelieved in, and\r\nwhich, when, after more than two years, the documents are produced,\r\nproves to be a stale rehash of negotiations before the Easter Week\r\nRising, with some sham \"German Irish Society\" in Berlin. On this\r\npretext the Sinn Fein leaders, Messrs de Valera and Griffith (whom\r\nthere is not a shadow of proof to connect with the German plot), were\r\narrested and deported, with many hundreds of the most responsible\r\nleaders. Furthermore, an endless series of prosecutions were\r\ninstituted and savage sentences imposed for the most paltry\r\ncharges-such as drilling, wearing uniform, singing _The Soldiers'\r\nSong_, having portraits of Rebel leaders, taking part in the\r\nArbitration Courts which had superseded the Petty Sessions Courts, and\r\nsuch like. All this, with suppression of newspapers and of all public\r\nmeetings, went on for many months before Sinn Fein, deprived of its\r\nleaders, was goaded at last into attacking the Royal Irish\r\nConstabulary. Whatever the juridical status of the guerrilla warfare\r\nthus entered upon (which it is not improbable England would have\r\napplauded if employed against any other Empire than her own), it was\r\nconducted on honourable lines by the Sinn Feiners. The policemen and\r\nsoldiers, including General Lewis, who surrendered, were treated with\r\ncourtesy, and not one of them wounded or insulted. Their wives and\r\nchildren were also carefully preserved from danger until the police\r\n\"reprisals\" in the Thurles neighbourhood--the wrecking of villages and\r\nthe savage murders of young men--ended by producing equally ruthless\r\n\"reprisals\" on the other side. In Dublin, since the Dublin\r\nMetropolitan Police declined to go about armed, not one of them has\r\nbeen fired upon.\r\n\r\nThe real ferocity on both sides began when the \"Black and Tans\" were\r\nimported to take the place of the R.I.C., who were resigning in\r\nbatches. It is indisputable--independent investigation by the\r\nCommittee of the British Labour Party and the daily messages of\r\nfearless British journalists, such as Mr Hugh Martin, establish it\r\nbeyond possibility of contradiction--that when the \"Black and Tans\"\r\nwere let loose on the Irish people they began a villainous campaign of\r\ncowardly murder, arson, robbery and drunken outrage, which should have\r\nmade all decent Englishmen and Englishwomen shudder for the deeds\r\ncommitted in their name. Whenever the particulars are fully disclosed\r\nthey will, I venture to say, horrify every honest man in the Empire.\r\nNot the least disgraceful feature of this black business was the\r\nmanner in which the Chief Secretary sought to brazen things out and\r\nthe audacious lies that he fathered, such as that Lord Mayor M'Curtain\r\nwas murdered by the Sinn Feiners, that it was Sinn Feiners who raided\r\nthe Bishop of Killaloe's house at midnight and searched for him\r\n(unquestionably with intent to shoot him), that it was the Sinn\r\nFeiners who burned down the City Hall, Public Library and the\r\nprincipal streets of Cork, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd then the utter failure of all this \"frightfulness\"! Several months\r\nago Sir Hamar Greenwood declared that Sinn Fein was on the run, and\r\nthe Prime Minister declared they had \"murder by the throat,\" the fact\r\nbeing that the young men they sought to terrorise were made more\r\nresolute in their defiance of the Government. The only people at all\r\nterrorised were the invalids, the nuns whose cloisters were violated\r\nby night, the women and children whose homes were invaded at night by\r\nmiscreants masquerading in the British uniform, maddened with drink\r\nand uttering the filthiest obscenities. And does England take account\r\nof what all this is going to mean to her--that the young generation\r\nwill grow up with never-to-be-forgotten memories of these atrocities,\r\nwhile the thousands of young men herded together in the internment\r\ncamps and convict prisons are being manufactured into life-long\r\nenemies of the Empire? Might not Englishmen pause and ask themselves\r\nwhether it is worth it all, apart from other considerations, to\r\nimplant this legacy of bitter hatred in Irish breasts?\r\n\r\nLet it be admitted that since the Government have been shamed into\r\ndropping their denials of \"reprisals\" and taken them in hand\r\nthemselves the military destruction has at least been carried on with\r\nsome show of reluctance and humanity by the regular army, but it\r\ncannot be too strongly emphasised that the disbandment and deportation\r\nof \"the Black and Tans\" is the first condition of any return to\r\ncivilised warfare or to any respect for the good name of England or\r\nher army.\r\n\r\nIf I were asked to state some of the essentials of peace I would say\r\nit must depend first of all on the re-establishment of a belief in the\r\ngood faith of England. This belief, and for the reasons which I have\r\nattempted to outline in the preceding chapters, has been shattered\r\ninto fragments. There is a strong feeling in Ireland that the Prime\r\nMinister's recent peace \"explorations\" are not honestly meant--that\r\nthey are intended to rouse the \"sane and moderate\" elements in\r\nopposition to Sinn Fein. Whilst this feeling exists no real headway\r\ncan be made by those who seek a genuine peace along rational and\r\nreasoned lines. The Prime Minister must be aware that when he\r\nprofesses his readiness to meet those who can \"deliver the goods\" he\r\nis talking rhetorical rubbish. \"Delivering the goods\" is not a matter\r\nfor Irishmen, but for British politicians, who have spent the last\r\ntwenty years cheating Ireland of the \"goods\" of Home Rule, which they\r\nhad solemnly covenanted again and again to \"deliver.\"\r\n\r\nMr Lloyd George's conditions for a meeting with \"Dail Eireann\" are so\r\nimpossible that one wonders he took the trouble to state them--viz.\r\n(1) that \"Dail Eireann\" must give up to be tried (and we presume\r\nhanged) a certain unspecified number of their own colleagues; (2) that\r\nthey must recant their Republicanism and proclaim their allegiance to\r\nthe Empire; (3) that negotiations must proceed on the basis of the\r\nPartition Act and the surrender of one-fourth of their country to the\r\nnew Orange ascendancy.\r\n\r\nNo section of honest Irishmen will dream of negotiating on such a\r\nbasis, and any attempt to make use of \"sane and moderate\" elements to\r\ndivide and discredit the elected representatives of the people will be\r\nmet by the universal declaration that the \"Dail Eireann\" alone is\r\nentitled to speak for Ireland. Until this primary fact is recognised\r\nthe fight in Ireland must go on, and many black chapters of its\r\nhistory will have to be written before some British statesman comes\r\nalong who is prepared to treat with the Irish nation in a spirit of\r\njustice and generosity.\r\n\r\nPeace is still perfectly possible if right methods are employed to\r\nensure it. It is futile to ask Sinn Fein to lay down arms and to abjure\r\ntheir opinions as a preliminary condition to negotiations. I doubt\r\nwhether the Sinn Fein leaders could impose such a condition upon their\r\nfollowers, even if they were so inclined--which they are not and never\r\nwill be. Let there, then, to start with, be no preliminary tying of\r\nhands. The initiative must come from the Government. They should\r\nannounce the largest measure of Home Rule they will pledge themselves to\r\npass. They should accompany this with a public promise to submit it to\r\nan immediate plebiscite or referendum of the whole Irish people on the\r\nplain issue \"Yes\" or \"No.\" All they can ask of the Sinn Fein leaders is\r\nthat they will leave the Irish people absolutely free to record their\r\njudgment. I can imagine that, in such circumstances, the attitude of the\r\nSinn Fein leaders would be: \"We do not surrender our Republican\r\nopinions, but if the Government offer full New Zealand Home Rule (let us\r\nsay) and pledge themselves to enforce it if Ireland accepts it, Sinn\r\nFein would be justified before all National Republicans in saying: 'This\r\nis a prospect so magnificent for our country we shall do nothing in the\r\nsmallest degree to prejudice the opinion of the people against its\r\nacceptance or to fetter the free and honest working of the new\r\ninstitutions.'\" Beyond this no person desiring a real peace ought to\r\nexpect Sinn Fein to go, and I am convinced that if this were the\r\nattitude of Sinn Fein and if the offer were made by the Government as\r\nsuggested, the majority for acceptance, on a plebiscite being taken,\r\nwould be so great that there would be no further shadow of opposition\r\neven in Ulster, where nobody would object that it should have local\r\nautonomy in all necessary particulars.\r\n\r\nI can conceive only one man standing in the way of a settlement on these\r\nlines--a settlement which would be just to Ireland and honourable to\r\nBritain. So long as Sir Edward Carson remains the powerful figure he\r\nis--dictating and directing the policy of the Cabinet--it is improbable\r\nthat he will consent to have the opinion of \"the six counties\" taken by\r\na plebiscite. But if Sir Edward Carson were to quit politics, as one may\r\nhope he can see a thousand good reasons for doing, I can well imagine\r\nthat Mr Lloyd George would be very glad to come to a satisfactory\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nWhatever happens this much is certain, there is only one road to peace\r\nin Ireland--the recognition of her nationhood, one and indivisible,\r\nand of the right of Irishmen to manage their own affairs in accordance\r\nwith Irish ideals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               POSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this book went to press, the appointment of Sir Edward Carson as\r\nLord of Appeal and the interview between Mr de Valera and Sir James\r\nCraig are developments of a more hopeful character which, it is devoutly\r\nto be hoped, will bring about the longed-for _rapprochement_ between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Ireland Since Parnell, by Daniel Desmond Sheehan",
