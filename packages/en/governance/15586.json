MARTIN'S STREET, LONDON\r\n  1921\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is little more than ten years since I wrote my _Indian Unrest_. But\r\nthey have been years that may well count for decades in the history of\r\nthe world, and not least in the history of India. Much has happened in\r\nIndia to confirm many of the views which I then expressed. Much has\r\nhappened also to lead me to modify others, and to recognise more clearly\r\nto-day the shortcomings of a system of government, in many ways\r\nunrivalled, but subject to the inevitable limitations of alien rule.\r\n\r\nAt a very early stage of the Great War the Prime Minister warned the\r\nBritish people that, after the splendid demonstration India was already\r\ngiving of her loyalty to the cause for which the whole Empire was then\r\nin arms, our relations with her would have henceforth to be approached\r\nfrom \"a new angle of vision.\" The phrase he used acquired a deeper\r\nmeaning still as the war developed from year to year into a\r\nlife-and-death struggle not merely between nations but between ideals,\r\nand India claimed for herself the benefit of the ideals for which she\r\ntoo fought and helped the British Commonwealth to victory. When victory\r\nwas assured, could India's claim be denied after she had been called in,\r\nwith all the members of the British Commonwealth, to the War Councils of\r\nthe Empire in the hour of need, and again been associated with them in\r\nthe making of peace? The British people have answered that question as\r\nall the best traditions of British governance in India, and all the\r\nprinciples for which they had fought and endured through four and a half\r\nyears of frightful war, bade them answer it.\r\n\r\nThe answer finally took shape in the great constitutional experiment of\r\nwhich I witnessed the inauguration during my visit to India this winter.\r\nIt promises to rally as seldom before in active support of the British\r\nconnection those classes that British rule brought within the orbit of\r\nWestern civilisation by the introduction of English education, just\r\nabout a century ago. It has not disarmed all the reactionary elements\r\nwhich, even when disguised in a modern garb, draw their inspiration from\r\nan ancient civilisation, remote indeed from, though not in its better\r\naspects irreconcilable with, our own. A century is but a short moment of\r\ntime in the long span of Indian history, and the antagonism between two\r\ndifferent types of civilisation cannot be easily or swiftly lived down.\r\nIt would be folly to underrate forces of resistance which are by no\r\nmeans altogether ignoble, and in this volume I have studied their origin\r\nand their vitality because they underlie the strange \"Non-co-operation\"\r\nmovement which has consciously or unconsciously arrayed every form of\r\nracial and religious and economic and political discontent, not merely\r\nagainst British rule, but against the progressive forces which contact\r\nwith Western civilisation has slowly brought into existence under\r\nBritish rule in India itself. These forces have been stirred to new\r\nendeavour by the goal now definitely placed within their reach. That we\r\nwere bound to set that goal and no other before them I have tried to\r\nshow by reviewing the consistent evolution of British policy in India\r\nfor the last 150 years, keeping, imperfectly sometimes, but in the main\r\nsurely, abreast of our own national and political evolution at home and\r\nthroughout the Empire. Once placed in its proper perspective, this great\r\nexperiment, though fraught with many dangers and difficulties, is one of\r\nwhich the ultimate issue can be looked forward to hopefully as the not\r\nunworthy sequel to the long series of bold and on the whole wonderfully\r\nsuccessful experiments that make up the unique story of British rule in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nI have to express my thanks to the proprietors of _The Times_ for\r\nallowing me to use some of the letters which I wrote for that paper\r\nwhilst I was in India last winter, and also to the Royal Society of Arts\r\nfor permission to reproduce the main portions of a lecture delivered by\r\nme last year on Hinduism as the first of the Memorial Lectures\r\ninstituted in honour of the late Sir George Birdwood, to whom I owe as\r\nmuch for the deeper understanding which he gave me of old India as I do\r\nto the late Mr. G.K. Gokhale for the clearer insight I gained from him\r\ninto the spirit of new India whilst we were colleagues from 1912 to 1915\r\non the Royal Commission on Indian Public Services.\r\n\r\n                                                      VALENTINE CHIROL.\r\n\r\n34 CARLYLE SQUARE, CHELSEA,\r\n_August 24, 1921._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                 PAGE\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n  THE CLASH OF TWO CIVILISATIONS                                    1\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n  THE ENDURING POWER OF HINDUISM                                   15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n  MAHOMEDAN DOMINATION                                             46\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n  BRITISH RULE UNDER THE EAST INDIA COMPANY                        66\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n  THE MUTINY AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER                                 84\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n  THE FIRST GREAT WAVE OF UNREST                                  111\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII\r\n  THE MORLEY-MINTO REFORMS                                        125\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII\r\n  THROUGH THE GREAT WAR TO THE GREAT INDIAN REFORM BILL      139\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX\r\n  THE EMERGENCE OF MR.

To bring home to every Indian the full significance of the\r\noccasion, the King-Emperor did not shrink from using in his Royal\r\nMessage an Indian word which not long ago was held to bear no other than\r\na seditious construction. His Majesty gave it a new and finer meaning.\r\n\"For years--it may be for generations--patriotic and loyal Indians have\r\ndreamed of _Swaraj_ for their motherland. To-day you have the beginnings\r\nof _Swaraj_ within my Empire, and the widest scope and ample opportunity\r\nfor progress to the liberty which my other Dominions enjoy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a bold pronouncement inaugurating another, some say the boldest,\r\nof all the many bold adventures which make up the marvellous history of\r\nBritish rule in India. The simplicity, rare in the East, of the ceremony\r\nitself enhanced its significance. It was not held, like the opening of\r\nthe Chamber of Princes, in the splendid Hall of Public Audience in the\r\nold Fort where the Moghul Emperors once sat on the Peacock Throne, nor\r\nwere there the flash of jewels and blaze of colour that faced the Duke\r\nwhen he addressed the feudatory chiefs who still rule their states on\r\nancient lines beyond the limits of direct British administration. The\r\nmembers of the new Indian Legislatures, most of them in sober European\r\nattire, though many of them retained their own distinctive head-dress,\r\nwere assembled within the white and unadorned walls of the temporary\r\nbuilding in which they will continue to sit until the statelier home to\r\nbe built for them in new Delhi is ready to receive them. But Delhi\r\nitself with all its age-long memories was around one to provide the\r\nhistoric setting for an historic scene, and Delhi still stands under the\r\nsign of the Kutub Minar, the splendid minaret--a landmark for miles and\r\nmiles around--which dominates the vast graveyard of fallen dynasties at\r\nits feet and the whole of the great plain beyond where the fate of\r\nIndia, and not of India alone, has so often been decided.\r\n\r\nOn that plain were fought out, in prehistoric times, the fierce\r\nconflicts of ancient Aryan races, Pandavas and Kauravas, around which\r\nthe poetic genius of India has woven the wonderful epos of the\r\nMahabharata. Only a couple of miles south of the modern city, the walls\r\nof the Purana Kilat, the fortress built by Humayun, cover the site but\r\nhave not obliterated the ancient name of Indraprasthra, or Indrapat, the\r\ncity founded by the Pandavas themselves, when Yudhisthira celebrated\r\ntheir final victory by performing on the banks of the Jumna, in token of\r\nthe Pandava claim to Empire, the _Asvamedha_, or great Horse Sacrifice,\r\noriginated by Brahma himself. There too, on a mound beyond Indrapat,\r\nstands the granite shaft of one of Asoka's pillars, on which, with a\r\nfine faith that the world has never yet justified, the great Buddhist\r\nApostle-Emperor of India inscribed over 2000 years ago his edicts\r\nprohibiting the taking of life. At the very foot of the Kutub Minar the\r\nfamous Iron Pillar commemorates the victories of the \"Sun of Power,\" the\r\nHindu Emperor of the Gupta dynasty with whose name, under the more\r\npopular form of Raja Bikram, Indian legend associates the vague memories\r\nof a golden age of Hindu civilisation in the fifth and sixth centuries.\r\nThe Pillar was brought there by one of the Rajput princes who founded in\r\nthe middle of the eleventh century the first city really known to\r\nhistory as Delhi. There Prithvi Raja reigned, who still lives in Indian\r\nminstrelsy as the embodiment of Hindu chivalry, equally gallant and\r\ndaring in love and in war--the last to make a stand in northern India\r\nagainst the successive waves of Mahomedan conquest which Central Asia\r\nhad begun to pour in upon India in 1001, with the first of Mahmud\r\nGhazni's seventeen raids. In the next century an Afghan wave swept down\r\non the top of the original Turki wave, and Kutub-ed-Din, having\r\nproclaimed himself Emperor of Delhi in 1206, built the great Mosque of\r\n_Kuwwet-el-Islam_, \"The Power of Islam,\" and the lofty minaret, still\r\nknown by his name, from which for six centuries the Moslem call to\r\nprayer went forth to proclaim Mahomedan domination over India.\r\n\r\nWith the monumental wreckage of those early Mahomedan dynasties, steeped\r\nin treachery and bloodshed, the plain of Delhi is still strewn. The\r\nannals of Indian history testify more scantily but not less eloquently\r\nto their infamy until the supremacy of Delhi, but not of Islam, was\r\nshaken for two centuries by Timur, who appeared out of the wild spaces\r\nof Tartary and within a year disappeared into them again like a\r\ndevastating meteor. From his stock, nevertheless, was to proceed the\r\nlong line of Moghul Emperors who first under Baber and then under Akbar\r\nwon the Empire of Hindustan at the gates of Delhi, and for a time\r\nsucceeded in bringing almost the whole of India under their sway. But\r\ntheir splendid marble halls in the great Fort of Delhi recall not only\r\nthe magnificence of the Moghul Empire, but its slow and sure decay,\r\nuntil it became a suitor for the protection of the British power, which,\r\nat first a mere trading power that had once sued humbly enough for its\r\nprotection, had risen to be the greatest military and political power\r\nin India. It was at Delhi at the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nthat Lord Lake rescued a Moghul Emperor from the hands of Mahratta\r\njailers, and it was at Delhi again that in 1857 the last semblance of\r\nMoghul rulership disappeared out of history in the tempest of the\r\nMutiny. It was on the plain of Delhi that the assumption by Queen\r\nVictoria of the imperial title was solemnly proclaimed in 1878, and,\r\nwith still greater pomp, King Edward's accession in 1903. There again in\r\n1911 King George, the first of his line to visit his Indian Empire as\r\nKing-Emperor, received in person the fealty of princes and peoples and\r\nrestored Delhi to her former pride of place as its imperial capital.\r\n\r\nWhere else in the world can such a procession of the ages pass before\r\none's eyes, from the great \"Horse Sacrifice\" of the Pandavas at the dawn\r\nof history to the inauguration by a British prince in the King-Emperor's\r\nname of modern political institutions conceived in the democratic spirit\r\nof British freedom?\r\n\r\nYet at the very time when an Indian-elected assembly, representing as\r\nfar as possible all creeds and classes and communities, and above all\r\nthe Western-educated classes who are the intellectual offspring of\r\nBritish rule, were gathered together to hear delivered to them in\r\nEnglish--the one language in which, as a result of British rule, and by\r\nno means the least valuable, Indians from all parts of a vast polyglot\r\ncountry are able to hold converse--the Royal message throwing open to\r\nthe people of India the road to _Swaraj_ within the British Empire, the\r\nimperial city of Delhi went into mourning as a sign of angry protest,\r\nand the vast majority of its citizens, mostly, it must be remembered,\r\nMahomedans, very strictly observed a complete boycott of the Royal visit\r\nin accordance with Mr. Gandhi's \"Non-co-operation\" campaign, and went\r\nout in immense crowds to greet the strange Hindu saint and leader who\r\nhad come to preach to them his own very different message--a message of\r\nrevolt, not indeed by violence but by \"soul force,\" against the\r\nsoulless civilisation of the West.\r\n\r\nIn no other city in India would such an alliance between Hindus and\r\nMahomedans have seemed only a few years ago more unthinkable. For\r\nnowhere else have we such a vision as in Delhi of the ruthlessness as\r\nwell as of the splendour of Mahomedan domination in India. Nowhere can\r\none measure as in Delhi the greatness of its fall, and its fall had\r\nbegun before it ever came into conflict with the rising British power.\r\nIt had been shaken to its foundations by the far more ancient power of\r\nHinduism, which Islam had subdued but never destroyed. In the\r\nseventeenth century Shivaji, the hero still to-day of the Hindu revival\r\nof which Mr. Gandhi is the latest apostle, led out for the first time\r\nhis Mahrattas in open rebellion against Delhi and started the continuous\r\nprocess of disintegration from which the Moghul Emperors were driven to\r\npurchase their only possible respite under British protection. Since\r\nIndia finally passed not under Mahratta, but under British rule,\r\nHinduism has never again been subjected to the oppression which the\r\nfierce monotheism of Islam itself taught all her Mahomedan rulers, with\r\nthe one noble exception of Akbar, to inflict upon an \"idolatrous\" race.\r\nBritish rule introduced into India not only a new reign of law and order\r\nbut the principles of equal tolerance and justice for all which had\r\nstruck root in our own civilisation. Nevertheless, at the very moment at\r\nwhich we were attempting to extend a wide and generous application of\r\nthose principles to the domain of political rights and liberties, we\r\nwere being confronted with unexpected forces of resistance which, even\r\nin Mahomedan Delhi, drew their chief inspiration from Hinduism.\r\n\r\nBut, it might be argued, Delhi, though restored to the primacy it had\r\nlost under British rule as the capital city of India, has continued to\r\nlive on the memories of the past and has been scarcely touched by the\r\nbreath of modern civilisation. For the full effect of close contact\r\nwith the West, ought one not to look to the great cities that have\r\ngrown up under British rule--to Calcutta, for instance, the seat until a\r\nfew years ago of British Government in India, itself a creation of the\r\nBritish, and if not to-day a more prosperous centre of European\r\nenterprise than Bombay, a larger and more populous city, in which the\r\nHindus are in an overwhelming majority? But in the life even of Calcutta\r\nfeatures are not lacking to remind one how persistent are the forces of\r\nresistance to the whole spirit of the West which Mr. Gandhi mustered in\r\nDelhi to protest against the purpose of the Duke of Connaught's mission.\r\nHad not a great part of Calcutta itself also observed the _Hartal_\r\nproclaimed by Mr. Gandhi during the Prince's visit?\r\n\r\nOn the surface it seems difficult in Calcutta to get even an occasional\r\nglimpse of the old India upon which we have superimposed a new India\r\nwith results that are still in the making. In Bombay, though it proudly\r\ncalls itself \"the Western Gate of India\" the glow of Hindu funeral\r\npyres, divided only by a long wall from the fashionable drive which\r\nsweeps along Back Bay from the city, still called the Fort, to Malabar\r\nHill, serves to remind one any evening that he is in an oriental world\r\nstill largely governed as ever by the doctrine of successive rebirths,\r\nthe dead being merely reborn to fresh life, in some new form according\r\nto each one's merits or demerits, out of the flames that consume the\r\nbody. On Malabar Hill itself, in the very heart of the favourite\r\nresidential quarter whence the Europeans are being rapidly elbowed out\r\nby Indian merchant princes, the finest site of all still encloses the\r\nTowers of Silence on which, contrary to the Hindu usage of cremation,\r\nthe Parsees, holding fire too sacred to be subjected to contact with\r\nmortal corruption, expose their dead to be devoured by vultures.\r\nCalcutta has no such conspicuous landmarks of the East to disturb the\r\nillusion produced by most of one's surroundings that this is a city\r\nwhich, if not actually European, differs only from the European type in\r\nthe complexion and dress of its oriental population and the\r\narchitectural compromises imposed on European buildings by a tropical\r\nclimate. The Marquess of Wellesley built Government House over a hundred\r\nyears ago on the model of Kedleston, and it is still the stateliest\r\nofficial residence in British India. Fort William with Olive's ramparts\r\nand fosses is still almost untouched, and with an ever-expanding\r\nWalhalla of bronze or marble Governors and Viceroys and\r\nCommanders-in-Chief, and at the farther end the white marble walls and\r\ndomes of the Queen Victoria Memorial Hall--the one noble monument we\r\nhave built in India--at last nearing completion, the broad expanse of\r\nCalcutta's incomparable Maidan is, even more than our London parks, the\r\ngreen playfield and the vital lung of the whole city. Along and behind\r\nChowringhee there are still a few of the old-time mansions of\r\nThackeray's \"nabobs,\" with their deep, pillared verandahs standing well\r\noff from the road, each within its discreet \"compound,\" but they are all\r\nrapidly making room for \"eligible residences,\" more opulent perhaps but\r\nmore closely packed, or for huge blocks of residential flats, even less\r\nadapted to the climate. The great business quarter round Dalhousie\r\nSquare has been steadily rebuilt on a scale of massive magnificence\r\nscarcely surpassed in the city of London, and many of the shops compare\r\nwith those of our West End. The river, too, all along the Garden Reach\r\nand far below is often almost as crowded as the Pool of London, with\r\nocean-going steamers waiting to load or unload their cargoes as well as\r\nwith lumbering native sailing ships and the ferries that ply ceaselessly\r\nbetween the different quarters of the city on both banks of the Hugli.\r\nThe continuous roar of traffic in the busy streets, the crowded\r\ntram-cars, the motors and taxis jostling the ancient bullock-carts, the\r\nsurging crowds in the semi-Europeanised native quarters, even the pall\r\nof smoke that tells of many modern industrial activities are not quite\r\nso characteristic of new India as, when I was last there, the\r\nsandwich-men with boards inviting a vote for this or that candidate in\r\nthe elections to the new Indian Councils.\r\n\r\nIn all the strenuous life and immense wealth of this great city, to\r\nwhich European enterprise first gave and still gives the chief impulse,\r\nIndians are taking an increasing share. The Bengalees themselves still\r\nhold very much aloof from modern developments of trade and industry, but\r\nthey were the first to appreciate the value of Western education, and\r\nthe Calcutta University with all its shortcomings has maintained the\r\nhigh position which Lord Dalhousie foreshadowed for it nearly seventy\r\nyears ago. In art and literature the modern Bengalee has often known how\r\nto borrow from the West without sacrificing either his own originality\r\nor the traditions of his race or the spirit of his creed. Some of the\r\nfinest Bengalee brains have taken for choice to the legal profession and\r\nhave abundantly justified themselves both as judges in the highest court\r\nof the province and as barristers and pleaders. In every branch of the\r\npublic services open to Indians and in all the liberal professions, as\r\nwell as in the civic and political life of their country, the Bengalees\r\nhave played a leading part, not restricted even to their own province,\r\nand in the very distinguished person of Lord Sinha, Bengal has just\r\nprovided for the first time an Indian to represent the King-Emperor as\r\ngovernor of a province--the neighbouring province of Behar and Orissa.\r\nNor have the women of Bengal been left behind as in so many other parts\r\nof India. In Calcutta many highly educated ladies have won such complete\r\nrelease from the ancient restraints imposed upon their sex that they\r\npreside to-day over refined and cultured homes from which the subtle\r\natmosphere of the East does not exclude the ease and freedom of Western\r\nhabits of mind and body.\r\n\r\nYet these are still exceptions, and even in such a progressive city as\r\nCalcutta and even amongst the highest classes the social and domestic\r\nlife of the majority of Hindus is still largely governed by the laws of\r\nHinduism, and not least with regard to marriage and the seclusion of\r\nwomen. I was once allowed to attend a sort of \"scripture lesson\" for\r\nlittle high-caste Hindu girls, organised by a benevolent old Brahman\r\nlady, who has devoted herself to the cause of infant education on\r\northodox lines. None of these 40 or 50 little girls had of course\r\nreached the age, usually ten, at which they would be cut off from all\r\ncontact with the other sex except in marriage. They had bright and happy\r\nfaces, and as it was a Hindu festival most of them were decked out in\r\nall their finery with gold and silver bangles on their dainty arms and\r\nankles, sometimes with jewelled nose-rings as well as ear-rings. They\r\nwent through an elaborate and picturesque ritual with great earnestness\r\nand reverence and carefully followed the injunctions of the Brahman, a\r\ncultured and Western-educated gentleman who presided over the ceremony.\r\nIt was an attractive scene, and would have been entirely pleasant but\r\nfor the painful contrast afforded by some eight or ten poor little mites\r\nwith shaven heads and drab-coloured dresses, almost ragged and quite\r\nunadorned. They were infant widows, condemned according to the laws of\r\nHinduism by the premature death of their husbands to whom they had been\r\nwedded, but whom they had never known, to lifelong widowhood, and\r\ntherefore in most cases to lifelong contempt and drudgery. For they were\r\ndebarred henceforth from fulfilling the supreme function of Hindu\r\nwomanhood, _i.e._ securing the continuity of family rites from father to\r\nson by bearing children in legitimate wedlock, itself terribly\r\ncircumscribed by the narrow limits within which inter-marriage is\r\npermissible even between different septs of the same caste. Happily\r\nthose I saw were probably still too young to realise the full\r\nsignificance of the unkind fate that already differentiated them so\r\nmarkedly from their more fortunate caste-sisters.\r\n\r\nNor has one to go so very far from the heart of Calcutta to be reminded\r\nthat the \"premier city\" of modern India derives its name from Kali, the\r\nmost sinister of Indian goddesses. She was the tutelary deity of\r\nKali-Kata, one of the three villages to which Job Charnock removed the\r\nfirst British settlement in Bengal when he abandoned Hugli in 1690, and\r\nher shrine has grown in wealth and fame with the growth of Calcutta.\r\nKali-Kata is to-day only a suburb of the modern city, but in entering it\r\none passes into another world--the world of popular Hinduism. In its\r\nnarrow streets every shop is stocked with the paraphernalia that Hindus\r\nrequire for their devotions, for everything centres in Kali-Kata round\r\nthe popular shrine sacred to Kali, the black goddess of destruction,\r\nwith a protruding blood-red tongue, who wears a necklace of human skulls\r\nand a belt of human hands and tongues, and, holding in one of her many\r\nhands a severed human head, tramples under foot the dead bodies of her\r\nvictims. From the _ghats_, or long flights of steps, that descend to the\r\nmuddy waters of a narrow creek which claims a more or less remote\r\nconnection with the sacred Ganges, crowds of pious Hindus go through\r\ntheir ablutions in accordance with a long and complicated ritual, whilst\r\nhigh-caste ladies perform them in mid-stream out of covered boats and\r\nbehind curtains deftly drawn to protect their _purdah_. Past an ancient\r\nbanyan tree, from whose branches streamers of coloured stuffs depend\r\nwith other votive offerings from grateful mothers who have not prayed\r\nfor male offspring in vain, past the minor shrines of many favourite\r\ndeities, a road lined with closely packed beggars and ascetics,\r\nthrusting forth their sores and their shrivelled limbs in the hope of a\r\nfew coppers, leads up to the place of sacrifice in front of the temple.\r\nThe pavement is still red with the blood of goats immolated to the Great\r\nGoddess, and her devotees who may have just missed the spectacle can at\r\nleast embrace the posts to which the victims were tied. On an open\r\npillared platform facing the holy of holies some of the high-caste\r\nworshippers await in prayer and meditation the moment when its ponderous\r\nbronze doors are from time to time thrown open. One old Brahman lady of\r\nsingularly refined appearance presses her fingers alternately on her\r\nright and her left nostril, whilst she expels through the other, keeping\r\nher lips all the time tightly closed, the unhallowed air which may have\r\ncontaminated her lungs on her way to the temple. Another worshipper lies\r\nfull length with his face pressed to the ground in motionless adoration.\r\nBetween them flit about laughing, bright-eyed little girls, the\r\n\"daughters\" of the temple, still unconscious of the life of temple\r\nprostitution to which they have been dedicated from their birth. The\r\ncourt-yard all around is packed with a surging, howling mob of pilgrims,\r\nmany of them from a great distance, fighting for a vantage point from\r\nwhich they may get a glimpse of the Great Goddess in her inner\r\nsanctuary, even if they cannot hope to penetrate into it.\r\n\r\nAt last, after much clanging of bells and fierce altercations between\r\nthe Brahman priests and the faithful as to payment of necessary fees,\r\nthe bronze doors roll back, and in the dim religious twilight one\r\ncatches a glint of gold and precious stones, the head-dress of Kali,\r\nwhose terrific image barely emerges from the depth of the inner\r\nsanctuary in which it stands, accessible only to its serving Brahmans.\r\nThey alone, though strangely enough temple Brahmans as a class enjoy\r\nlittle credit with their fellow-castemen, can approach the idol and wash\r\nand dress and feed it with offerings. Whilst the doors are open the\r\nfrenzy and the noise increases, as the mob of worshippers struggle for a\r\nfront place and bawl out their special supplications at the top of their\r\nvoices. Then when they are closed again there is a general unravelling\r\nof the tangled knots of perspiring humanity, and those who have achieved\r\nthe supreme purpose of their pilgrimage gradually disperse to make room\r\nfor another crowd, one stream succeeding another the whole day long on\r\nspecial festivals, but on ordinary days mostly between sunrise and noon.\r\nAt the back of the shrine, as I came away, some privileged worshippers\r\nwere waiting to drink a few drops of the foul water which trickles out\r\nof a small conduit through the wall from the holy of holies. It is the\r\nwater in which the feet of the idol--and those of the serving\r\nBrahmans--have been washed!\r\n\r\nIt was in this same temple of Kali that only some fifteen years ago,\r\nduring the violent agitation provoked by the Partition of Bengal, vast\r\ncrowds used to assemble and take by the name of the Great Goddess the\r\nvow of _Swadeshi_ as the first step to _Swaraj_, and Bengalee youths,\r\nmaddened by an inflammatory propaganda, learned to graft on to ancient\r\nforms of worship the very modern cult of the bomb. To this same temple\r\nresorted only the other day Mr. Gandhi's followers to seek the blessing\r\nof the Great Goddess for the more harmless forms of protest by which he\r\nexhorted the inhabitants of Calcutta to bring home to the Duke of\r\nConnaught during his stay in Calcutta their indignant rejection of the\r\nboon which he had been sent out by the King-Emperor to confer on the\r\npeople of India.\r\n\r\nMust we then be driven to the conclusion that there is a gulf never to\r\nbe bridged between India's ancient civilisation and the modern\r\ncivilisation which we have brought to her out of the West? In that case\r\nthe great constitutional adventure on which we have just embarked would\r\nbe, unlike all our other great adventures in India, foredoomed to\r\nfailure, and those Englishmen would be right who shudder at its rashness\r\nand reiterate with added conviction, since the school of Indian thought\r\nfor which Mr. Gandhi stands seems to bear them out, that \"East is East\r\nand West is West, and never the twain shall meet.\" The whole history of\r\nthe British connection with India surely excludes such a conclusion of\r\nfailure and despair. It teaches us, not, as such Englishmen contend,\r\nthat India was won and has been held and must be retained by the sword\r\nalone, but that British rule was established and has been maintained\r\nwith and by the co-operation of Indians and British, and that in seeking\r\nto-day to associate Indians more closely than ever before with the\r\ngovernment and administration of the country, we are merely persevering\r\nin the same path which, though at times hesitatingly and reluctantly,\r\nthe British rulers of India have trodden for generations past, always\r\nkeeping step with the successive stages of our own national and\r\npolitical evolution. The Indian extremists misread equally the whole\r\nhistory of British rule who see in it nothing but a long nightmare of\r\nhateful oppression to be finally overcome, according to Mr. Gandhi's\r\npreaching, by \"Non-co-operation\" and the immortal \"soul force\" of India,\r\nrescued at last from the paralysing snares of an alien civilisation. Not\r\nfor the first time has the cry of \"Back to the Vedas\" been raised by\r\nIndians who, standing in the old ways, watch with hostility and alarm\r\nthe impact on their ancient but static civilisation of the more dynamic\r\ncivilisation of the West with which we for the first time brought India\r\ninto contact. It would be folly to underrate the resistance which the\r\nreactionary elements in Hinduism are still capable of putting forth. I\r\nhave shown how it can still be seen operating in extreme forms, and not\r\nupon Hindus alone, in the two pictures which I have drawn from Delhi and\r\nCalcutta. It meets one in a lesser degree at almost every turn all over\r\nIndia. But it would be just as foolish to underrate the progressive\r\nforces which show now as ever in the history of Hinduism, that it is\r\nalso capable of combining with a singular rigidity of structure and with\r\nmany forms repugnant to all our own beliefs a breadth and elasticity of\r\nthought by no means inferior to that of the West.\r\n\r\nTo those who hoped for a more rapid and widespread fusion of Indian and\r\nWestern ideals, some of the phenomena which have marked the latter-day\r\nrevival of Hinduism and the shape it has recently assumed in Mr.\r\nGandhi's \"Non-co-operation\" campaign, may have brought grave\r\ndisappointment. But the inrush of Western influences was assuredly bound\r\nto provoke a strong reaction. For let us not forget that to the abiding\r\npower of Hinduism India owes the one great element of stability that\r\nenabled her, long before we appeared in India, to weather so many\r\ntremendous storms without altogether losing the sense of a great\r\nunderlying unity stronger and more enduring than all the manifold lines\r\nof cleavage which have tended from times immemorial to divide her.\r\nHinduism has not only responded for some forty centuries to the social\r\nand religious aspirations of a large and highly endowed portion of the\r\nhuman race, almost wholly shut off until modern times from any intimate\r\ncontact with our own Western world, but it has been the one great force\r\nthat has preserved the continuity of Indian life. It withstood six\r\ncenturies of Mahomedan domination. Could it be expected to yield without\r\na struggle to the new forces, however superior we may consider them and\r\nhowever overwhelming they may ultimately prove, which British rule has\r\nimported into India during a period of transition more momentous than\r\nany other through which she has ever passed, but still very brief when\r\ncompared with all those other periods of Indian history which modern\r\nresearch has only recently rescued from the legendary obscurity of still\r\nearlier ages?\r\n\r\nWe are witnessing to-day a new phase of this great struggle, the clash\r\nof conflicting elements in two great civilisations. A constitution has\r\nbeen inaugurated at Delhi to bring India into permanent and equal\r\npartnership with a commonwealth of free nations which is the greatest\r\npolitical achievement of Western civilisation, and the latest prophet of\r\nHinduism, applying to it the language of the West, has banned it\r\nforthwith as a thing of Satan, the offspring of a Satanic government and\r\nof a Satanic civilisation. His appeal to India is intended to strike\r\nmany and various chords, but it is essentially an appeal to the ancient\r\nforces of Hinduism which gave India a great civilisation long before\r\nEurope, and least of all Britain, had emerged from the savagery of\r\nprimitive man. Englishmen find it difficult to understand the strength\r\nof that appeal, perhaps because they do not realise how deep and vital\r\nare the roots of the civilisation to which it appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ENDURING POWER OF HINDUISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia's civilisation, intimately bound up from its birth with the great\r\nsocial and religious system which we call Hinduism, is as unique as it\r\nis ancient. Its growth and its tenacity are largely due to the\r\ngeographical position of a great and populous sub-continent, on its land\r\nside exposed only to incursions from the north through mountainous and\r\ndesolate regions, everywhere difficult of access and in some parts\r\nimpenetrable, and shut in on the other two sides of a roughly isosceles\r\ntriangle by broad expanses of sea which cut it off from all direct\r\nintercourse with the West until, towards the close of the Middle Ages,\r\nEuropean navigators opened up new ocean highways to the East. India owes\r\nher own peculiar civilisation to the gradual fusion of Aryan races of a\r\nhigher type that began to flow down from Central Asia before the dawn of\r\nhistory upon the more primitive indigenous populations already in\r\npossession. Its early history has only now begun to emerge from the\r\ntwilight of myths and legends, and cannot even now be traced with any\r\nassurance of accuracy nearly as far back as that of other parts of the\r\nworld which preceded or gave birth to our own much more recent\r\ncivilisation. The pyramids of Ghizeh and Sakkara and the monumental\r\ntemples of Thebes bore ample witness to the greatness of Egyptian\r\ncivilisation long before the interpretation of her hieroglyphics enabled\r\nus to determine its antiquity, and the discovery of its abundant art\r\ntreasures revealed the high degree of culture to which it reached.\r\nExcavations in the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates have yielded an\r\nalmost equally valuable harvest in regard to Babylonian and Assyrian\r\ncivilisation, and Cnossus has told us its scarcely less wonderful story.\r\nYet the long line of Pharaohs was coming to an end and Egypt was losing\r\nthe national independence which she has never once recovered; Nineveh\r\nhad fallen and Jerusalem was destroyed; Greece and even Rome had already\r\nstarted on their great creative careers before any approximately correct\r\ndate can be assigned to the stages through which Indian civilisation had\r\npassed. India only becomes historical with the establishment of the\r\nSasunaga dynasty in the Gangetic kingdom of Magadha, which centred in\r\nwhat is now Behar, about the year 600 B.C.\r\n\r\nAs to the state of India before that date, no sort of material evidence\r\nhas survived, or at any rate has yet been brought to light--no\r\nmonuments, no inscriptions, very little pottery even, in fact very few\r\ntraces of the handicraft of man; nor any contemporary records of\r\nundoubted authenticity. Fortunately the darkness which would have been\r\notherwise Cimmerian is illuminated, though with a partial and often\r\nuncertain light, by the wonderful body of sacred literature which has\r\nbeen handed down to our own times in the Vedas and Brahmanas and\r\nUpanishads. To none of these books, which have, for the most part,\r\nreached us in various recensions often showing considerable\r\ndiscrepancies and obviously later interpolations, is it possible to\r\nascribe any definite date. But in them we undoubtedly possess a genuine\r\nkey to the religious thought and social conceptions, and even\r\ninferentially to the political institutions of the Aryan Hindus through\r\nthe many centuries that rolled by between their first southward\r\nmigrations into the Indian peninsula and their actual emergence into\r\nhistory. The Vedic writings constitute the most ancient documents\r\navailable to illustrate the growth of religious beliefs founded on pure\r\nNature-worship, which translated themselves into a polytheistic and\r\npantheistic idea of the universe and, in spite of many subsequent\r\ntransformations, are found to contain all the germs of modern Hinduism\r\nas we know it to-day--and, indeed, of all the religious thought of\r\nIndia. In the Vedic hymns Nature itself is divine, and their pantheon\r\nconsists of the deified forces of Nature, worshipped now as Agni, the\r\ngod of Fire; Soma, the god and the elixir of life; Indra, the god of\r\nheaven and the national god of the Aryans; and again, under more\r\nabstract forms, such as Prajapati, the lord of creation, Asura, the\r\ngreat spirit, Brahmanaspati, the lord of prayer; and sometimes, again,\r\ngathered together into the transcendent majesty of one all-absorbing\r\ndivinity, such as Varuna, whose pre-eminence almost verges on\r\nmonotheism. But the general impression left on the Western mind is of a\r\nfantastic kaleidoscope, in which hundreds and even thousands of deities,\r\nmale and female, are constantly waxing and waning and changing places,\r\nand proceeding from, and merging their identity in, others through an\r\ninfinite series of processes, partly material and partly metaphysical,\r\nbut ever more and more subject to the inspiration and the purpose of the\r\nBrahman, alone versed in the knowledge of the gods, and alone competent\r\nto propitiate them by sacrificial rites of increasing intricacy, and by\r\nprayers of a rigid formalism that gradually assume the shape of mere\r\nincantations.\r\n\r\nThis is the great change to which the Brahmanas bear witness. They show\r\nno marked departure from the theology of the Vedas, though many of the\r\nold gods continue to be dethroned either to disappear altogether, or to\r\nreappear in new shapes, like Varuna, who turns into a god of night to be\r\nworshipped no longer for his beneficence, but to be placated for his\r\ncruelty; whilst, on the other hand, Prajapati is raised to the highest\r\nthrone, with Sun, Air, and Fire in close attendance. What the Brahmanas\r\ndo show is that the Brahman has acquired the overwhelming authority of a\r\nsacerdotal status, not vested merely in the learning of a theologian,\r\nbut in some special attribute of his blood, and therefore transmissible\r\nonly from father to son. The Brahman was doubtless helped to this\r\nfateful pre-eminence by the modifications which the popular tongue had\r\nundergone in the course of time, and as the result more especially of\r\nmigration from the Punjab to the Gangetic plains. The language of the\r\nVedic hymns had ceased to be understood by the masses, and its\r\ninterpretation became the monopoly of learned families; and this\r\nmonopoly, like all others, was used by those who enjoyed it for their\r\nown aggrandisement. The language that had passed out of common usage\r\nacquired an added sanctity. It became a sacred language, and sacred\r\nbecame the Brahman, who alone possessed the key to it, who alone could\r\nrecite its sacred texts and perform the rites which they prescribed, and\r\nselect the prayers which could best meet every distinct and separate\r\nemergency in the life of man.\r\n\r\nIn the Brahmanas we can follow the growth of a luxuriant theology for\r\nthe use of the masses which, in so far as it was polytheistic, tended to\r\nthe infinite multiplication of gods and goddesses and godlings of all\r\ntypes, and in so far as it was pantheistic invested not only men, but\r\nbeasts and insects and rivers and fountains and trees and stones with\r\nsome living particle of the divine essence pervading all things; and we\r\ncan follow there also the erection on the basis of that theology, of a\r\nformidable ritual of which the exclusive exercise and the material\r\nbenefits were the appanage of the Brahman. But we have to turn to a\r\nlater collection of writings known as the Upanishads for our knowledge\r\nof the more abstract speculations out of which Hindu thinkers, not\r\nalways of the Brahmanical caste, were concurrently evolving the esoteric\r\nsystems of philosophy that have exercised an immense and abiding\r\ninfluence on the spiritual life of India. There is the same difficulty\r\nin assigning definite dates to the Upanishads, though many of the later\r\nones bear the post-mark of the various periods of theological evolution\r\nwith which they coincided. Only some of the earliest ones are held by\r\nmany competent authorities to be, in the shape in which they have\r\nreached us, anterior to the time when India first becomes, in any real\r\nsense, historical; but there is no reason to doubt that they represent\r\nthe progressive evolution into different forms of very ancient germs\r\nalready present in the Vedas themselves. They abound in the same\r\nextravagant eclecticism, leading often to the same confusions and\r\ncontradictions that Hindu theology presents. The Sankhya Darshana, or\r\nsystem, recognising only a primary material cause from which none but\r\nfinite beings can proceed, regards the universe and all that exists in\r\nit and life itself as a finite illusion of which the end is\r\nnon-existence, and its philosophic conceptions are atheistic rather than\r\npantheistic. In opposition to it the Vedantic system of mystic\r\npantheism, whilst also seeing in this finite world a mere world of\r\nillusion, holds that rescue from it will come to each individual soul\r\nafter a more or less prolonged series of rebirths, determined for better\r\nor for worse by its own spirituality according to the law of Karma, not\r\nin non-existence, but in its fusion with God, whose identity with the\r\nsoul of man is merely temporarily obscured by the world illusion of\r\nMaya. Only the inconceivable is real, for it is God, but God dwells in\r\nthe heart of every man, who, if and when he can realise it and has\r\ndetached himself from his unworthy because unreal surroundings, is\r\nhimself God. Akin to Vedantic mysticism is the Yoga system, which\r\nteaches extreme asceticism, retirement into solitude, fastings, nudity,\r\nmortification of the flesh, profound meditation on unfathomable\r\nmysteries, and the endless reiteration of magic words and phrases as the\r\nmeans of accelerating that ineffable fusion of God and man. The\r\nmaterialism of the Sankhya and the idealism of the Vedanta combine to\r\nprovoke the reaction of yet another system, the Mimansa, which stands\r\nfor the eternal and divine revelation of the Vedas, codifies, so to say,\r\ntheir theology into liturgical laws, admits of no speculation or\r\nesoteric interpretation, and seems to subordinate the gods themselves\r\nto the forms of worship that consecrate their existence.\r\n\r\nOf all the doctrines that these early speculations evolved, none has had\r\na more enduring influence on Hinduism than that of the long and indeed\r\ninfinite succession of rebirths through which man is doomed to pass\r\nbefore he reaches the ultimate goal either of non-existence or of\r\nabsorption into the divine essence. For none has done more to fortify\r\nthe patriarchal principle which from the earliest times governed the\r\ntribal family, and to establish the Hindu conception of the family as it\r\nprevails to the present day. With that curious inconsequence which\r\nfrequently characterises Hindu thought, even when it professes to be\r\nruled by the sternest logic, the belief that every rebirth is\r\nirrevocably determined by the law of Karma, _i.e._ in accordance with\r\nthe sum total of man's deeds, good and bad, in earlier existences, is\r\nheld to be compatible with the belief that the felicity of the dead can\r\nonly be assured by elaborate rites of worship and sacrifice, which a son\r\nalone, or a son's son, can take over from his father and properly\r\nperform. The ancient _patria potestas_ of tribal institutions has been\r\nthus prolonged beyond the funeral pyre, and the ancient reverence for\r\nthe dead which originally found expression in an instinctive worship of\r\nthe ancestors has been translated into a ceremonial cult of the\r\nancestral manes, which constitutes the primary duty and function of\r\nevery new head of the family. Hence the Hindu joint family system which\r\nkeeps the whole property of the family as well as the governance of all\r\nits members under the sole control of the head of the family. Hence also\r\nthe necessity of early marriage, lest death should overtake the Hindu\r\nbefore he has begotten the son upon whose survival the performance of\r\nthe rites essential, not only to his own future felicity, but to that of\r\nall his ancestors depends, and, as an alternative, to mitigate the awful\r\nconsequences of the default of heirs male of his own body, the\r\nintroduction of adoption under conditions that secure to the adopted\r\nson precisely the same position as a real son would have enjoyed. Hence\r\nagain the inferiority of woman, whom early marriage tended to place in\r\ncomplete subjection to man. Her chief value was that of a potential\r\nbreeder of sons. In any case, moreover, she passed on her marriage\r\nentirely out of her own family into that of her husband, and terribly\r\nhard was her lot if she were left a widow before having presented her\r\nhusband with a son. Even if she were left an infant widow of an infant\r\nhusband and their marriage could not possibly have been consummated, she\r\nwas doomed to an austere and humiliating life of perpetual widowhood,\r\nwhilst, on the other hand, if she died, her widowed husband was enjoined\r\nto marry again at once unless she had left him a son. To explain away\r\nthis cruel injustice, her fate was supposed to be due to her own Karma,\r\nand to be merely the retribution that had overtaken her for sins\r\ncommitted in a former existence, which condemned her to be born a woman\r\nand to die a childless wife, or worse still, to survive as a childless\r\nwidow. The misfortune of the widowed husband who was left without a son\r\nshould logically have been imputed in the same way to his own Karma, but\r\nit was not. All through life, and in death itself, man was exalted and\r\nwoman occupied a much lower plane, though in practice this hardship was\r\nmitigated for the women who bore sons by the reverence paid to them in\r\ntheir homes, where their force of character and their virtues often gave\r\nthem a great and recognised ascendancy. However hard the laws that\r\ngoverned the Hindu family might press on individual members, the family\r\nitself remained a living organism, united by sacred ties--indeed more\r\nthan a mere living organism, for the actually living organism was one\r\nwith that part of it which had already passed away and that which was\r\nstill awaiting rebirth. It is undoubtedly in the often dignified and\r\nbeautiful relations which bind the Hindu family together that Hinduism\r\nis seen at its best, and Hindu literature delights in describing and\r\nexalting them.\r\n\r\nTraditional usages, or Smriti, were ultimately embodied in codes of law,\r\nof which the most famous is that of Manu; and though disfigured by many\r\nsocial servitudes repugnant to the Western mind, they represent a lofty\r\nstandard of morality based upon a conception of duty, or Dharma,\r\nnarrowly circumscribed, but solid and practical. Though these codes of\r\nlaw, and notably that of Manu in the form in which we possess them, are\r\nof uncertain but probably much later date, they afford us, in\r\nconjunction with the vast body of earlier religious and philosophic\r\nliterature, and with a certain amount of scientific literature dealing\r\nwith astronomy and astrology, with mathematics and specially with\r\ngeometry, and with grammar and prosody, sufficient materials for\r\nappraising, with a fair measure of accuracy, the stage of progress which\r\nthe Aryan Hindus had reached in the sixth century B.C. When the world\r\nwas young, and they revelled in their recent conquest of a fair portion\r\nin it, they delighted to worship the bright gods who had helped them to\r\npossess it, and worship and war were the ties that kept their loose\r\ntribal organisation together. Out of the primitive conditions of nomadic\r\nand pastoral life, under the leadership of tribal elders who were both\r\npriests and warriors, they gradually passed, after many vicissitudes of\r\npeace and war, into more settled forms of agricultural life and\r\ndeveloped into distinct and separate polities of varying vitality, but\r\nstill united by the bond of common religious and social institutions in\r\nthe face of the indigenous populations whom they drove before them, or\r\nreduced into subjection and slowly assimilated as they moved down\r\ntowards and into the Gangetic plain. As the conditions of life grew more\r\ncomplex, with increasing prosperity and probably longer intervals of\r\npeace, differentiation between classes and professions grew more marked.\r\nThere was time and leisure for thinking as well as for fighting, for\r\ncontemplation as well as for action. The \"bright\" gods that Nature had\r\nconceived for the early Aryans were fashioned and refashioned by\r\nspeculations already laden with the gloom of melancholy and awesomeness\r\nthat pervades India. Caste, it may be inferred from the Sanskrit word\r\n_Varna_, which means colour, originally discriminated only between the\r\nAryan conquerors of relatively fair complexion and the darker aborigines\r\nthey had subdued. It was extended to connote the various stratifications\r\ninto which Hindu society was settling, and in the stringent rules which\r\ngoverned the constitution of each caste, and the relations between the\r\ndifferent castes, the old exclusiveness of tribal customs was\r\nperpetuated and intensified.\r\n\r\nTo the supremacy which the Brahman, as the expounder of the scriptures\r\nand of the laws deduced from them, and the ordained dispenser of divine\r\nfavour, through prayer and sacrifice, was able to arrogate to his own\r\ncaste, the code of Manu, above all others, bears emphatic witness:\r\n\r\n     The very birth of Brahmans is a constant incarnation of Dharma....\r\n     When a Brahman springs to light he is born above the world, the\r\n     chief of all creatures, assigned to guard the treasury of duties,\r\n     religious and civil. Whatever exists in the world is all in effect,\r\n     though not in form, the wealth of the Brahman, since the Brahman is\r\n     entitled to it all by his primogeniture and eminence of birth.\r\n\r\nEvery offence committed by a Brahman involves a relatively slight\r\npenalty; every offence committed against him the direst punishment. Next\r\nto the Brahman, but far beneath him, is the Kshatrya and beneath him\r\nagain the Vaishya. The Shudras are the fourth caste that exists chiefly\r\nto serve the three twice-born castes, and above all the Brahman. As Sir\r\nWilliam Jones observes in the preface to the translation which he was\r\nthe first to make a little more than a century ago of these\r\nextraordinarily full and detailed ordinances, they represent a system of\r\ncombined despotism and priestcraft, both indeed limited by law, but\r\nartfully conspiring to give mutual support with mutual checks. But\r\nthough they abound with minute and childish formalities, though they\r\nprescribe ceremonies often ridiculous, though the punishments they\r\nenact are partial and fanciful, for some crimes dreadfully cruel, for\r\nothers reprehensibly slight, though the very morals they lay down, rigid\r\nenough on the whole, are in one or two instances, as in the case of\r\nlight oaths and of pious perjury, dangerously relaxed, one must,\r\nnevertheless, admit that, subject to those grave limitations, a spirit\r\nof sublime devotion, of benevolence to mankind, and of amiable\r\ntenderness to all sentient creatures pervades the whole work, and the\r\nstyle of it has a certain austere majesty that sounds like the language\r\nof legislation and extorts a respectful awe. Above all it is well to\r\nremember that the ordinances of Manu still constitute to-day the\r\nframework of Hindu society, and Brahman judges of the Indian High\r\nCourts, who administer our own very different codes, still cling to them\r\nin private life and quote them in political controversies as the\r\nrepositories of inspired wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt is on this background of tangled religious beliefs and abstruse\r\nphilosophic speculations and very precise and elaborate laws framed to\r\nsafeguard the twofold authority of priests and kings, but of the latter\r\nalways in subordination to the former, that we see men and cities and\r\norganised states assume for the first time historic substance towards\r\nthe sixth century B.C. From that date onwards we are on firmer ground.\r\nFor though even in much later times the Hindus never produced historians\r\nin the strict sense of the term, we are able to call in aid the valuable\r\ntestimony not only of a few indigenous chroniclers but also of Greek and\r\nChinese and Arab writers and travellers, as well as the authoritative\r\nevidence supplied by epigraphy and numismatics; and though for many\r\ncenturies still very infrequently, the precious remains of ancient\r\nmonuments. But the original background is never effaced, for the whole\r\nreligious and social system, the whole philosophic outlook upon the\r\nworld of which I have sought to outline the long and laborious evolution\r\nthrough prehistoric ages, remained fundamentally immune against change\r\nuntil the advent of the British to India subjected them to the solvent\r\nof Western civilisation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking peculiarities of Hinduism is that its origin\r\ncannot be associated with any single great teacher or prophet, however\r\nlegendary. Still less can it be identified with the personal inspiration\r\nof a Moses or a Christ, of a Confucius or a Mahomed. Only when we reach\r\nthe firmer ground of historic times does any commanding personality\r\nemerge to leave a definite and abiding impress upon successive ages. The\r\nfirst and the greatest is Buddha, and we can still trace to-day his\r\nfootsteps in the places where he actually stood and delivered his\r\nmessage to the world. It was at Buddh Gaya that, after fleeing from the\r\npomp and luxury of his father's royal palace, he sat and meditated under\r\nthe Bo-tree on the vanity and misery of human life, but it was at\r\nRajagriha, \"the King's House,\" that he first began to preach. Rajagriha,\r\nabout 40 miles S.S.E. of the modern Patna, was then the capital of one\r\nof the many small kingdoms that had grown up in the broad valley of the\r\nGanges. It was already an ancient city of some fame, for the Mahabharata\r\nmentions all the five hills which, as the first Chinese pilgrim,\r\nFa-Hien, puts it, \"encompass it with a girdle like the walls of a town.\"\r\nIt was itself a walled city, and some of the walls, as we can still see\r\nthem to-day, represent most probably the earliest structure raised in\r\nIndia by human hands that has survived down to our own times. They were\r\nno jerry-builders then. Strengthened at sundry points by great square\r\nbastions, the walls of Rajagriha measure in places over seventeen feet\r\nin width and eleven or twelve feet in height, and they are faced with\r\nundressed stones three to five feet in length, without mortar or cement,\r\nbut carefully fitted and banded together with a core of smaller blocks\r\nnot less carefully laid and packed. They merely supplemented and\r\ncompleted the natural line of defences provided by the outer girdle of\r\nhills, rising to 1200 feet, which shut off Rajagriha from the plain of\r\nBihar. On one of those peerless days of the cold season in Upper India\r\nwhen there is not a cloud to break the serenity of the deep blue sky, I\r\nlooked up to the mountain Ghridrakuta, on whose slopes Buddha dwelt for\r\nsome time after he had found enlightenment at Buddh Gaya, and saw it\r\njust as the second Chinese pilgrim to whom we owe most of our knowledge\r\nof Rajagriha described it--\"a solitary peak rising to a great height on\r\nwhich vultures make their abode.\" Many had been the revolutions of the\r\nwheel of time since Hiuen-Tsang had watched the circling of the vultures\r\nround the sacred peak some twelve and a half centuries before me, and as\r\nBuddha himself, another twelve and a half centuries earlier, must have\r\nwatched them when he miraculously stretched forth his hand through a\r\ngreat rock to rescue his beloved disciple Ananda from the clutch of the\r\ndemon Mara, who had taken on the shape of a vulture. The swoop of those\r\ngreat birds seemed to invest the whole scene with a new and living\r\nreality. Across the intervening centuries I could follow King Bimbisara,\r\nwho reigned in those days at Rajagriha, proceeding along the causeway of\r\nrough, undressed stones, which can be traced to-day to the foot of the\r\nmountain and up its rocky flanks, after his men had \"levelled the valley\r\nand spanned the precipices, and with the stones had made a staircase\r\nabout ten paces wide,\" so that he should himself be carried up to wait\r\nin his own royal person on the Lord Buddha. There, marked to the present\r\nday by the remains of two large _stupas_, was the place where the king\r\nalighted from his litter to go forward on foot, and farther up again the\r\nspot where he dismissed his followers and went on alone to invite the\r\nBuddha to come down and dwell in his capital.\r\n\r\nThat must have been about 500 B.C., and Buddha spent thereafter a\r\nconsiderable portion of his time in the bamboo garden which King\r\nBimbisara presented to him on the outskirts of Rajagriha. There, and in\r\nhis annual wanderings through the country, he delivered to the poor and\r\nto the rich, to the Brahman and to the sinner, to princes and peasants,\r\nto women as well as to men, his message of spiritual and social\r\ndeliverance from the thraldom of the flesh and from the tyranny of\r\ncaste.\r\n\r\nWith the actual doctrines of Buddhism I do not propose to deal. There is\r\nnothing in them that could not be reconciled with those of the Vedanta,\r\nand they are especially closely akin to the Sankhya system. But the\r\ndriving force of Buddhism, as also of Jainism, which grew up at the same\r\ntime as Buddhism under the inspiration of another great reformer,\r\nMahavira, who is said to have been a cousin of King Bimbisara, was a\r\nspirit of revolt against Brahmanical Hinduism, and a new sense of social\r\nsolidarity which appealed to all classes and castes, and to women as\r\nwell as to men. The Vedanta reserved the study of the scriptures to men\r\nof the three \"twice-born\" castes, and placed it under the supreme\r\nauthority of the Brahmans. Both Buddha and Mahavira recognised no such\r\nrestrictions, though they did not refuse reverence to the Brahman as a\r\nman of special learning. The religious orders which they founded were\r\nopen to all, and these orders included nuns as well as monks. This was\r\nthe rock on which they split with Hinduism. This was the social\r\nrevolution that, in spite of the religious and philosophical elasticity\r\nof Hinduism, made Buddhists and Jains unpardonable heretics in the eyes\r\nof the Brahmans, and produced a conflict which was to last for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nThough King Bimbisara welcomed the Buddha to his capital, and Buddhism\r\nmade rapid headway amongst the masses, he does not appear to have\r\nhimself embraced the new religion, and it is not till after Alexander\r\nthe Great's expedition had for the first time brought an European\r\nconqueror on to Indian soil, and a new dynasty had transferred the seat\r\nof government to Pataliputra, the modern Patna, on the Ganges, that\r\nperhaps the greatest of Indian rulers, the Emperor Asoka, who reigned\r\nfrom 272 to _circa_ 232 B.C., made Buddhism the state religion of his\r\nEmpire. Tradition has it, that when Buddha on his last wanderings\r\npassed by the fort which King Ajatasatni was building at Pataliputra, he\r\nprophesied for it a great and glorious future. It had already fulfilled\r\nthat prophecy when the Greek Ambassador, Megasthenes, visited it in 303\r\nB.C. A few remains only are being laboriously rescued from the waters of\r\nthe Ganges, under which Pataliputra is for the most part buried. But at\r\nthat time it spread for ten miles along the river front; five hundred\r\nand seventy towers crowned its walls, which were pierced by sixty-four\r\ngates, and the total circumference of the city was twenty-four miles.\r\nThe palace rivalled those of the Kings of Persia, and a striking\r\ntopographical similarity has been lately traced between the artificial\r\nfeatures of the lay-out of Pataliputra and the natural features of\r\nPersepolis, King Darius's capital in Southern Persia.\r\n\r\nPataliputra became the capital of India under Chandragupta Maurya, who,\r\nsoldier of fortune and usurper that he was, transformed the small\r\nkingdom of Magadha into a mighty empire. Known to Greek historians as\r\nSandrokottos, young Chandragupta had been in Alexander's camp on the\r\nIndus, and had even, it is said, offered his services to the Macedonian\r\nking. In the confusion which followed Alexander's death, he had raised\r\nan army with which he fell on the Macedonian frontier garrisons, and\r\nthen, flushed with victory, turned upon the King of Magadha, whom he\r\ndethroned. After eighteen years of constant fighting he had extended his\r\nfrontiers to the Hindu Kush in the north, and nearly down to the\r\nlatitude of Madras in the south. He had, at the same time, established a\r\nremarkable system of both civil and military administration by which he\r\nwas able to consolidate his vast conquests. His war office was\r\nscientifically divided into six boards for maintaining and supplying his\r\nhuge fighting force of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 9000 elephants,\r\nand 8000 war chariots, besides fully equipped transport and commissariat\r\nservices. No less scientific was the system of civil government as\r\nillustrated by the municipal institutions of Pataliputra. There, again,\r\nthere were six boards dealing respectively with trade, industries,\r\nwages, local taxation, the control of foreign residents and visitors,\r\nand, perhaps most extraordinary of all, with vital statistics. Equally\r\nadmirable was the solicitude displayed for agriculture, then, as now,\r\nthe greatest of Indian industries, and for its handmaid, irrigation. The\r\npeople themselves, if we may believe Megasthenes, were a model people\r\nwell worthy of a model government, though if he does not exaggerate, one\r\nis driven to wonder at the necessity for such fearful penalties as were\r\ninflicted for the most trivial breaches of the law. But behind\r\nChandragupta the power of the Brahman was still clearly entrenched, for\r\nhis chief minister was a Brahman, Chanakya, who had followed his\r\nfortunes from their first adventurous beginnings.\r\n\r\nThe stately fabric which Chandragupta built up during his own\r\ntwenty-five years' reign, _circa_ 322-297 B.C., endured during the reign\r\nof his son Bendusara, of whom scarcely anything is known, and at the end\r\nof another twenty-five years passed on, undiminished, to his great\r\nsuccessor, Asoka, whose unique experiment would have been scarcely\r\npossible had he not succeeded to an empire already firmly consolidated\r\nat home and abroad. When he came to the throne, about 272 B.C., Asoka\r\nhad served his apprenticeship in the art of government as viceroy, first\r\nin the north at Taxila, and then in the west at Ujjain. He had been\r\nbrought up by Brahmans in the manner befitting his rank. Buddhist\r\ntradition would have us believe that until his conversion he was a\r\nmonster of cruelty; but there is scarcely enough to warrant that\r\nindictment in the fact that he began his reign with a war of aggression,\r\nfor which he afterwards expressed the deepest remorse. It was, indeed,\r\nfrom that moment that he determined to be henceforth a prince of peace;\r\nbut it is quite as probable that his determination inclined him more and\r\nmore to turn his ear to Buddhist teaching as that Buddhist teaching\r\nprompted his determination.\r\n\r\nNo monarch has ever recorded the laws which he gave to his people in\r\nsuch imperishable shape. They are to be seen to the present day cut into\r\ngranite pillars or chiselled into the face of the living rock in almost\r\nevery part of what was then the Empire of the Mauryas, from the Peshawar\r\ndistrict in the north to Mysore and the Madras Presidency in the south,\r\nfrom the Kathiawar Peninsula in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the\r\neast. The pillars are often at the same time monuments of artistic\r\ndesign and workmanship, as, above all, the Garnath pillar near Benares\r\nwith its magnificent capital of the well-known Persepolitan type and its\r\nfour lions supporting the stone Wheel of the Law, first promulgated on\r\nthat spot. Many more of Asoka's monuments may yet be discovered, but the\r\neleven pillar edicts and the fourteen rock edicts, not to speak of minor\r\ninscriptions already brought to light and deciphered, constitute a body\r\nof laws which well deserve to have been made thus imperishable. For no\r\ntemporal sovereign has ever legislated so fully and exclusively and with\r\nsuch evident conviction for the spiritual advancement and moral\r\nelevation of his people. Scarcely less important is the autobiographical\r\nvalue of these inscriptions, which enable one to follow stage by stage\r\nthe evolution of the Apostle-Emperor's soul. Within a year of the\r\nconquest of the Kalinjas, for which he afterwards publicly recorded his\r\nremorse, Asoka became a lay disciple of the Buddhist law, and two and a\r\nhalf years later studied as a Buddhist monk. In 257 B.C., the thirteenth\r\nyear of his reign, he began to preach his series of sermons in\r\nstone--sermons that were at the same time laws given to his Empire. His\r\nprofession of faith was as lofty as it was simple:\r\n\r\n     The gods who were regarded as true all over India have been shown\r\n     to be untrue. For the fruit of exertion is not to be attained by a\r\n     great man only, because even by the small man who chooses to exert\r\n     himself immense heavenly bliss may be won.... Father and mother\r\n     must be hearkened to. Similarly, respect for living creatures must\r\n     be firmly established. Truth must be spoken. These are the virtues\r\n     of the law of piety which must be practised.... In it are included\r\n     proper treatment of slaves and servants, honour to teachers,\r\n     gentleness towards living creatures, and liberality towards\r\n     ascetics and Brahmans.... All men are my children, and just as I\r\n     desire for my children that they may enjoy every kind of prosperity\r\n     and happiness in both this world and the next, so I desire the same\r\n     for all men.\r\n\r\nThese principles are applied in all the instructions to his officials.\r\nHe commends to their special care the primitive jungle folk and the\r\nuntamed people of the borderlands. He bestows much thought on the\r\nalleviation of human suffering, and his injunctions in restriction of\r\nthe slaughter and maiming of animals and the preservation of life are\r\nminute and precise. It is in this connection that the influence of\r\nBuddhism on Hinduism has been most permanent, for whilst the primitive\r\nAryan Hindus were beef-eaters, their descendants carried the vegetarian\r\ndoctrines of Buddhism to the extreme length of condemning cow-killing as\r\nthe most awful of crimes, next to the killing of a Brahman.\r\n\r\nDetermined to preserve the unity and discipline of his own church,\r\nAsoka's large tolerance sees some good in all creeds. He wishes every\r\nman to have the reading of his own scriptures, and whilst reserving his\r\nmost lavish gifts for Buddhist shrines and monasteries, he does not deny\r\nhis benefactions to Brahmans and ascetics of other sects. Nor is he\r\ncontent merely to preach and issue orders. His monastic vows, though\r\nthey lead him to forswear the amusements and even the field sports which\r\nhad been his youthful pastimes, do not involve the severance of all\r\nworldly ties. He is the indefatigable and supreme head of the Church; he\r\nvisits in solemn pilgrimage all the holy places hallowed by the memory\r\nof Buddha, and endows shrines and monasteries and convents with princely\r\nmunificence; he convenes at Pataliputra a great Buddhist council for\r\ncombating heresy. But he remains the indefatigable and supreme head of\r\nthe State. \"I am never fully satisfied with my efforts and my despatch\r\nof business. Work I must for the welfare of all, and the root of the\r\nmatter is in effort.\" He controls a highly trained bureaucracy not\r\nunlike that of British India to-day, and his system of government is\r\nwonderfully effective so long as it is informed by his untiring energy\r\nand singular loftiness of purpose.\r\n\r\nWith Asoka Buddhism attained to a supremacy in India which may well be\r\ncompared with that of Christianity in Europe under Constantine; and it\r\nis only by measuring the height to which Buddhism had then risen that we\r\ncan realise the enduring power of Hinduism, as we see it through\r\nsuccessive centuries slowly but irresistibly recovering all the ground\r\nit had lost until Buddhism at last disappears almost entirely off the\r\nface of India, whereas it continued to spread, though often in very\r\ndebased forms, over the greater part of Eastern Asia, and still\r\nmaintains its hold there over more than a third of the total population\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\nAs with most of the great rulers and conquerors that India has from time\r\nto time thrown up, Asoka's life-work fell to pieces almost as soon as he\r\nhad passed away. Not only did the temporal empire which he built up\r\ndisintegrate rapidly in the hands of his feeble successors, but Buddhism\r\nitself was dethroned within fifty years with the last of his dynasty,\r\nslain by the usurper Pushyamitra Sunga, who, after consecrating himself\r\nto the Hindu gods with the rites of _Rajasuya_, celebrated his advent to\r\nParamount Power by reviving the ancient ceremony of _Asvamedha_, the\r\nSacrifice of the Horse--one of the most characteristic of Brahmanical\r\nrites.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after another great conquering inflow from Central Asia\r\nin the first century of our era that Kanishka, the greatest of a new\r\ndynasty which had set itself up at Purushpura, situated close to the\r\nmodern Peshawar, shed a transient gleam of glory over the decline of\r\nBuddhism and even restored it to the position of a state religion. But\r\nit was a Buddhism already far removed from the purity of Asoka's reign.\r\nThe most striking feature of this short-lived revival is the artistic\r\ninspiration which it derived from Hellenistic sources, of which the\r\nmuseums of Peshawar and Lahore contain so many remarkable illustrations.\r\nThe theory, at one time very widely entertained, that Alexander's brief\r\nincursion into India left any permanent mark on Indian civilisation is\r\nnow entirely discarded by the best authorities. No Indian author makes\r\neven the faintest allusion to him, nor is there any trace of Hellenic\r\ninfluence in the evolution of Indian society, or in the elaborate\r\ninstitutions with which India was endowed by the Mauryan dynasty that\r\nfollowed immediately on the disruption of Alexander's empire. But the\r\nKushans, or Yueh Chis, during the various stages of their slow migration\r\ndown into Northern India, came into long and close contact with the\r\nIndo-Bactrian and Indo-Parthian kingdoms that sprang up after Alexander.\r\nThe populations were never Hellenised, but their rulers were to some\r\nextent the heirs, albeit hybrid heirs, to Greek civilisation. They spoke\r\nGreek and worshipped at Greek shrines, and as they were in turn\r\nsubjugated by the forebears of the Kushan Empire, they imparted to the\r\nconquerors something of their own Greek veneer. In the second century of\r\nour era Kanishka carried his victorious arms down to the Gangetic plain,\r\nwhere Buddhism still held its own in the region which had been its\r\ncradle; and, according to one tradition, he carried off from Pataliputra\r\na famous Buddhist saint, who converted him to Buddhism. But as these\r\nIndo-Scythian kings had not been long enough in India to secure\r\nadmission to the social aristocracy of Hinduism by that slow process of\r\nnaturalisation to which so many ruling families have owed their Kshatrya\r\npedigrees, Kanishka, having himself no claim to caste, may well have\r\npreferred for reasons of state to favour Buddhism as a creed\r\nfundamentally opposed to caste distinctions. Whatever the motives of his\r\nconversion, we have it on the authority of Hiuen-Tsang that he\r\nultimately did great things for Buddhism, and the magnificent _stupa_,\r\nwhich he erected outside his capital, five-and-twenty stories high and\r\ncrowned with a cupola of diamonds, was still 150 feet high and measured\r\na quarter of a mile in circumference when the Chinese pilgrim visited\r\nPurushpura five centuries later. To the present day there are traces\r\noutside the northern gate of Peshawar of a great Buddhist monastery,\r\nalso built by Kanishka, which remained a seat of Buddhist learning until\r\nit was destroyed by Mahomedan invaders; and it was only a mile from\r\nPeshawar that the American Sanskritist, Dr. Spooner, discovered ten\r\nyears ago the casket containing some of Buddha's bones, which is one of\r\nthe most perfect specimens of Graeco-Buddhist art. The Buddhist statues\r\nand bas-reliefs of that period are Greek rather than Indian in their\r\ntreatment of sacred history, and even the head of Gautama himself might\r\nsometimes be taken for that of a young Greek god.\r\n\r\nThese exotic influences may indeed have acted as a further solvent upon\r\nBuddhism. But in any case, its local and temporary revival as a dominant\r\nstate religion under Kanishka, whose empire did not long outlive him,\r\nfailed to arrest its steady resorption into Hinduism. On the one hand,\r\nBuddhism itself was losing much of its original purity. The miraculous\r\nlegends with which the life of Buddha was gradually invested, the almost\r\nidolatrous worship paid to him, the belief that he himself was but the\r\nlast of many incarnations in which the Buddha had already revealed\r\nhimself from the very beginning of creation--all these later accretions\r\nrepresent, no doubt, the reaction upon Buddhism of its Hinduistic\r\nsurroundings. But they doubtless helped also to stimulate the growth of\r\nthe more definite forms of anthropomorphism which characterised the\r\ndevelopment of Hinduism when the ancient ritual and the more impersonal\r\ngods of the Vedas and of the Brahmanas gave way to the cult of such very\r\npersonal gods as Shiva and Vishnu, with their feminine counterparts,\r\nKali and Lakshmi, and ultimately to the evolution of still more popular\r\ndeities, some, like Skanda and the elephant-headed Ganesh, closely\r\nconnected with Shiva; others like Krishna and Rama, _av[=a]taras_ or\r\nincarnations--and in many ways extremely human incarnations--of Vishnu.\r\nAt the same time, the Aryan Hindus, as they went on subduing the\r\nnumerous aboriginal races of India, constantly facilitated their\r\nassimilation by the more or less direct adoption of their primitive\r\ndeities and religious customs. The two great epics, the Mahabharata,\r\nwith its wonderful episode, the Baghavat-Ghita, which is the apotheosis\r\nof Krishna, and the Ramayana, which tells the story of Rama, show the\r\ninfusion into Hinduism of a distinctly national spirit in direct\r\nopposition to the almost cosmopolitan catholicity of Buddhism,\r\nsufficiently elastic to adapt itself even to the political aspirations\r\nof non-Hindu conquerors as well as of non-Hindu races beyond the borders\r\nof Hindustan, in Nepal and in Ceylon, in Burma and in Tibet, in China\r\nand in Japan. The conflict between Buddhist and Hindu theology might not\r\nhave been irreconcilable, for Hinduism, as we know, was quite ready to\r\nadmit Buddha himself into the privileged circle of its own gods as one\r\nof the incarnations of Vishnu. What was irreconcilable was the conflict\r\nbetween a social system based on Brahmanical supremacy and one that\r\ndenied it--especially after Hinduism had acquired a new sense of Indian\r\npatriotism which only reached fuller development in our own times when\r\nit was quickened by contact with European nationalism.\r\n\r\nHindus themselves prefer, however, to-day to identify Indian nationalism\r\nwith the period when from another long interval of darkness, which\r\nfollowed the downfall of the Kushan kingdom, Indian history emerges into\r\nthe splendour of what has been called \"the golden age of Hinduism\" in\r\nthe fourth and fifth centuries of our era under the great Gupta dynasty,\r\nwho ruled at Ujjain. Few Indian cities are reputed to be more ancient or\r\nmore sacred than the little town of Ujjain on the Sipra river, known as\r\nOzen[=i] to the Greeks, and where Asoka had ruled in his youth as\r\nViceroy of Western India. It owes its birth to the gods themselves.\r\nWhen Uma wedded Shiva her father slighted him, not knowing who he was,\r\nfor the mighty god had wooed and won her under the disguise of a mere\r\nascetic mendicant, and she made atonement by casting herself into the\r\nsacrificial fire, which consumed her--the prototype of all pious Hindu\r\nwidows who perform _Sati_--in the presence of gods and Brahmans. Shiva,\r\nmaddened with grief, gathered up the bones of his unfortunate consort\r\nand danced about with them in a world-shaking frenzy. Her scattered\r\nbones fell to earth, and wherever they fell the spot became sacred and a\r\ntemple sprang up in her honour. One of her elbows fell on the banks of\r\nthe Sipra at Ujjain, and few shrines enjoy greater or more widespread\r\nfame than the great temple of Maha-Kal, consecrated to her worship and\r\nthat of Shiva. Its wealth was fabulous when it was looted and destroyed\r\nby Altamsh and his Pathan Mahomedans in 1235. The present buildings are\r\nfor the most part barely 200 years old, and remarkable chiefly for the\r\ninsistency with which the _lingam_ and the bull, the favourite symbols\r\nof Shiva, repeat themselves in shrine after shrine. But it attracts\r\nimmense numbers of pilgrims, especially in every twelfth year, when they\r\nflock in hundreds of thousands to Ujjain and camp as near as possible to\r\nthe river. The peculiarity of the Ujjain festival is that, in memory of\r\nthe form which Shiva took on when he wooed Uma, it attracts a veritable\r\narmy of Sanyasis, or mendicants, sometimes as many as fifty thousand,\r\nfrom all parts of India. Seldom, except at the great Jaganath festivals\r\nat Puri, is a larger congregation seen of weird and almost inhuman\r\nfigures; some clothed solely with their long unkempt hair, some with\r\ntheir bodies smeared all over with white ashes, and the symbol of their\r\nfavourite deity painted conspicuously on their foreheads; some\r\ndisplaying ugly sores or withered limbs as evidence of lifelong\r\nmortification of the flesh; some moving as if in a dream and entirely\r\nlost to the world's realities; some with frenzied eyes shouting and\r\nbrandishing their instruments of self-torture; some with a repulsive\r\nleer and heavy sensuous jowls affecting a certain coquetry in the\r\nritualistic adornment of their well-fed bodies.\r\n\r\nChandragupta I., the founder of the great dynasty which Hindus extol\r\nabove all others, was only a petty chieftain by birth, but he was\r\nfortunate enough to wed a lady of high lineage, who could trace a\r\nconnection with the ancient Maurya house of Magadha, and, thanks to this\r\nalliance and to his own prowess, he was able at his death to bequeath\r\nreal kingship to his son, Samadragupta, who, during a fifty years'\r\nreign, A.D. 326-375, again welded almost the whole of India north of the\r\nNerbudda river into one empire, and once even spoiled Southern India\r\nright down to Cape Comorin. His victories are recorded--with an irony\r\nperhaps not wholly accidental--beneath the Asokan inscription on the\r\nAllahabad pillar. Of his zeal for Hinduism we have a convincing proof in\r\ngold coins of his reign that preserve on the obverse in the figure of\r\nthe sacrificial horse a record of the _Asvamedha_, which he again\r\nrevived. Strange to say, however, his fame has never been so popular as\r\nthat of his son, Chandragupta II., Vikramadytia, the Sun of Power, who\r\nreigned in turn for nearly forty years, and has lived in Hindu legend as\r\nthe Raja Bikram, to whom India owes her golden age. It was his court at\r\nUjjain which is believed to have been adorned by the \"Nine Gems\" of\r\nSanskrit literature, amongst whom the favourite is Kalidasa, the poet\r\nand dramatist. Amidst much that is speculative, one thing is certain.\r\nThe age of Vikramadytia was an age of Brahmanical ascendancy. As has so\r\noften happened, and is still happening in India to-day in the struggle\r\nbetween Urdu and Hindi, the battle of religious and political supremacy\r\nwas largely one of languages. During the centuries of Brahmanical\r\ndepression that preceded the Gupta dynasty, the more vulgar tongue\r\nspoken of the people prevailed. Under the Guptas, Sanskrit, which was\r\nthe language of the Brahmans, resumed its pre-eminence and took\r\npossession of the whole field of literature and art and science as well\r\nas of theology. Oral traditions were reduced to writing and poetry was\r\nadapted to both sacred and profane uses in the Puranas, in the metrical\r\ncode of Manu, in treatises on sacrificial ritual, in Kalidasa's plays,\r\nand in many other works of which only fragments have survived.\r\nAstronomy, logic, philosophy were all cultivated with equal fervour and\r\nto the greater glory of Brahmanism. Local tradition is doubtless quite\r\nwrong in assigning to Raja Bikram the noble gateway which is the only\r\nmonument of Hindu architecture at its best that Ujjain has to show\r\nto-day. But to that period may, perhaps, be traced the graceful, if\r\nhighly ornate, style of architecture, of which the Bhuvaneshwar temples,\r\nseveral centuries more recent, are the earliest examples that can be at\r\nall accurately dated. To the credit of Brahmanism be it said that in its\r\nhour of triumph it remained at least negatively tolerant, as all purely\r\nIndian creeds generally have been. Fa-Hien, who visited India during the\r\nreign of Vikramadytia, though dismayed at the desolation which had\r\nalready overtaken many of the sacred places of Buddhism, pays a generous\r\ntribute to the tolerance and statesmanship of that great sovereign. The\r\ncountry seems, indeed, to have enjoyed real prosperity under a paternal\r\nand almost model administration.\r\n\r\nYet the Gupta dynasty endured only a little longer than had that of the\r\nMauryas. Its downfall was hastened by the long reign of terror which\r\nIndia went through during the invasion of the White Huns. Europe had\r\nundergone a like ordeal nearly a century earlier, for when the Huns\r\nbegan to move out of the steppes of Eastern Asia they poured forth in\r\ntwo separate streams, one of which swept into Eastern Europe, whilst the\r\nother flowed more slowly towards Persia and India. What Attila had been\r\nto Europe, Mihiragula was to India, and though the domination of the\r\nHuns did not long outlive him, the anarchy they left behind them\r\ncontinued for another century, until \"the land of Kuru,\" the cradle and\r\nbattle-field of so many legendary heroes, produced another heroic\r\nfigure, who, as King Harsha, filled for more than forty years (606-648)\r\nthe stage of Indian history with his exploits. He had inherited the\r\nblood of the Gupta emperors from his mother, though his father was only\r\na small Raja of Thanesvar, to the north of Delhi. The tragic\r\ncircumstances in which he succeeded him made a man of him at the early\r\nage of fourteen. By the time he was twenty he was \"master of the five\r\nIndias\"--_i.e._ of nearly the whole of Northern India from Kathiawar to\r\nthe delta of the Ganges, and henceforth he proved himself as great in\r\npeace as in war. In his case the knowledge we owe to Chinese sources is\r\nsupplemented by the valuable record left by the Brahman Bana, who lived\r\nat his court and wrote the Harsha-Charita. Taxation, we are told, was\r\nlightened, and the assessment of land revenue was equitable and\r\nmoderate. Security for life and property was enforced under severe but\r\neffective penalties. Education received impartial encouragement whether\r\nconducted by Brahmans or by Buddhist monks, and both as a patron of\r\nliterature, which he himself cultivated by composing dramas, and as a\r\nphilanthropic ruler King Harsha bestowed his favours with a fairly equal\r\nhand on Hinduism and on Buddhism alike. For Buddhism still lingered in\r\nthe land, and Harsha, who was a mystic and a dreamer as well as a man of\r\naction, certainly inclined during his later years towards Buddhism, or,\r\nat least, included it in his own eclectic creed.\r\n\r\nHiuen-Tsang, who spent fifteen years in India during Harsha's reign,\r\nsearching for the relics of early Buddhism in a land from which it was\r\nsteadily disappearing, has given us a wonderful picture of a religious\r\nstate-pageant which makes Prayaga, at the triple confluence of the\r\nGanges and the Jumna with the sacred but invisible river, Saraswati,\r\nnear to the modern city of Allahabad, stand out as another striking\r\nlandmark in Indian history. Hindus attach great holiness to rivers and\r\ntheir confluence, and this Triveni, or triple confluence, had been\r\nspecially consecrated by Brahma, who chose that spot for the first\r\n_Asvamedha_. \"From ancient times,\" says the Chinese chronicler, \"the\r\nkings used to go there to distribute alms, and hence it was known as the\r\nPlace of Almsgiving. According to tradition more merit is gained by\r\ngiving one piece of money there than one hundred thousand elsewhere.\" So\r\nKing Harsha having invited all alike, whether \"followers of the law or\r\nheretics, the ascetics and the poor, the orphans and the helpless,\" the\r\nkings of eighteen subordinate kingdoms assembled there with their people\r\nto the number of 500,000, and found immense refectories laid out for\r\ntheir refreshment, and long rows of warehouses to receive silk and\r\ncotton garments and gold and silver coins for distribution to them. \"The\r\nfirst day a statue of Buddha was placed in the shrine erected on the\r\nPlace of Almsgiving, and there was a distribution of the most precious\r\nthings and of the garments of greatest value, whilst exquisite viands\r\nwere served and flowers scattered to the sound of harmonious music. Then\r\nall retired to their resting-places. On the second day a statue of the\r\nSun-god was placed in the shrine, and on the third day the statue of\r\nShiva,\" and the distribution of gifts continued on those days and day\r\nafter day for a period of over two months, ten thousand Brahmans\r\nreceiving the lion's share, until, having exhausted all his wealth, even\r\nto the jewels and garments he was wearing, King Harsha borrowed a coarse\r\nand much-worn garment, and having \"adored the Buddhas of the ten\r\ncountries,\" he gave vent to his pious delight, exclaiming: \"Whilst I was\r\namassing all this wealth I was always afraid lest I should find no safe\r\nand secret place to stow it away. Now that I have deposited it by\r\nalms-giving in the Field of Happiness I know that it is for ever in\r\nsafety. I pray that in my future lives I may amass in like manner great\r\ntreasures and give them away in alms so as to obtain the ten divine\r\nfaculties in all their plenitude.\"\r\n\r\nHere one sees India as it was before the Mahomedan invasions, in the\r\ndays of the last of the great Indian rulers who succeeded for a time in\r\nbending the whole of Northern India to his will. As always in India,\r\nbehind whatever form of temporal power might for the moment appear to be\r\nparamount, religion and the social order which it consecrates\r\nrepresented the real paramount power that alone endures. In this\r\nextraordinary festival which marked the close of Harsha's reign the\r\npicture left to us is singularly complete. The first day is a sort of\r\nfarewell tribute to the waning glory of Buddha, and the second to the\r\nancient majesty of the Vedic gods; but they only prepare the way for the\r\nculminating worship, on the third day, of the terrific figure of Shiva,\r\nwho had already been raised to one of the highest, if not the highest,\r\nthrone in the Hindu pantheon, which he still retains--Shiva, the master\r\nof life and death, whose favourite emblem is the phallus, and from whose\r\nthird eye bursts forth the flame which is one day to consume the world.\r\nAround Harsha, and devouring his gifts until, at the end of two months,\r\nthey are wholly exhausted, are the Brahmans, \"born above the world,\r\nassigned to guard the treasury of duties, civil and religious,\" through\r\nwhom alone the wrath of angry gods can be appeased and present and\r\nfuture life be made safe in the descending hierarchy of caste.\r\n\r\nShortly after Harsha's death in A.D. 648, India, as is her wont as soon\r\nas the strong man's arm is paralysed, relapses once more into political\r\nchaos. Her history does not indeed ever again recede into the complete\r\nobscurity of earlier ages. We get glimpses of successive kingdoms and\r\ndynasties rising and again falling in Southern India, as the Hindu\r\nAryans gradually permeate and subdue the older Dravidian races and\r\nabsorb the greater part of them, not without being in turn influenced by\r\nthem, into their own religious and social system. The most notable\r\nfeature of the post-Harsha period of Hindu history is the emergence of\r\nthe Rajput states, whose rulers, though probably descendants of\r\nrelatively recent invaders, not only became rapidly Hinduised, but\r\nsecured relatively prompt admission to the rank of Kshatryas in the\r\nHindu caste system, with pedigrees dated back to the Sun and Moon, which\r\nto the popular mind were well justified by their warlike prowess and\r\nsplendid chivalry. I need only recall the name of Prithvi-Raja, the lord\r\nof Sambhar, Delhi, and Ajmer, whose epic fame rests not less on his\r\nabduction of the Kanauj princess who loved him than on his gallant\r\nlosing fight against the Mahomedan invaders of India. But fierce clan\r\njealousies and intense dynastic pride made the Rajputs incapable of\r\nuniting into a single paramount state, or even into an enduring\r\nconfederacy fit to withstand the storm of which Harsha himself might\r\nhave heard the distant rumblings. For it was during his reign that\r\nmilitant Islam first set foot in India, in a remote part of the\r\npeninsula. Just at the same time as the Arabs, in the first flush of\r\nvictory, poured into Egypt, a small force crossed the Arabian Sea and\r\nentered Baluchistan, and a century later the whole of Sind passed into\r\nArab hands. Another two centuries and the Mahomedan flood was pouring\r\nirresistibly into India, no longer across the Arabian Sea, but from\r\nCentral Asia through the great northern passes, until in successive\r\nwaves it submerged for a time almost the whole of India.\r\n\r\nNow if we look back upon the fifteen centuries of Indian history, of\r\nwhich I have sought to reconstitute the chief landmarks before the\r\nMahomedan invasions, the two salient features that emerge from the\r\ntwilight are the failure of the Aryan Hindus to achieve any permanent\r\nform of political unity or stability, and their success, on the other\r\nhand, in building up on adamantine foundations a complex but vital\r\nsocial system. The supple and subtle forces of Hinduism had already in\r\nprehistoric times welded together the discordant beliefs and customs of\r\na vast variety of races into a comprehensive fabric sufficiently elastic\r\nto shelter most of the indigenous populations of India, and sufficiently\r\nrigid to secure the Aryan Hindu ascendancy. Of its marvellous tenacity\r\nand powers of resorption there can be no greater proof than the\r\nelimination of Buddhism from India, where, in spite of its tremendous\r\nuplift in the days of Asoka and the intermittent favours it enjoyed\r\nunder later and lesser monarchs, it was already moribund before the\r\nMahomedans gave it its final deathblow. Jainism, contemporary and\r\nclosely akin to Buddhism, never rose to the same pre-eminence, and\r\nperhaps for that very reason secured a longer though more obscure lease\r\nof life, and still survives as a respectable but numerically quite\r\nunimportant sect. But indomitably powerful as a social amalgam, Hinduism\r\nfailed to generate any politically constructive force that could endure\r\nmuch beyond the lifetime of some exceptionally gifted conqueror. The\r\nMauryan and the Gupta dynasties succumbed as irretrievably to the\r\ncentrifugal forces of petty states and clans perpetually striving for\r\nmastery as the more ephemeral kingdoms of Kanishka and Harsha. They all\r\nin turn crumbled away, and, in a land of many races and languages and\r\nclimates, split up into many states and groups of states constantly at\r\nstrife and constantly changing masters and frontiers. Hinduism alone\r\nalways survived with its crowded and ever-expanding pantheon of gods and\r\ngoddesses for the multitude, with its subtle and elastic philosophies\r\nfor the elect, with the doctrine of infinite reincarnations for all,\r\nand, bound up with it, the iron law of caste.\r\n\r\nThe caste system, though it may be slowly yielding in non-essentials to\r\nthe exigencies of modern life, is still vigorous to-day in all its\r\nessential features, and cannot easily be extruded from their family life\r\neven by the Western-educated classes. It divides up Indian society into\r\nthousands of water-tight compartments within which the Hindu is born and\r\nlives and dies without any possibility of emerging from the one to which\r\nhe has been predestined by his own deeds in his former lives. Each caste\r\nforms a group, of which the relations within its own circle, as well as\r\nwith other groups, are governed by the most rigid laws--in no\r\nconnection more rigid than in regard to marriage. These groups are of\r\nmany different types; some are of the tribal type, some national, some\r\nsectarian, some have been formed by migration, some are based upon a\r\ncommon social function or occupation past or present, some on\r\npeculiarities of religious beliefs and superstitions. A distinguished\r\nFrench writer, M. Senart, has described a caste as a close corporation,\r\nin theory at any rate rigorously hereditary, equipped with a certain\r\ntraditional and independent organisation, observing certain common\r\nusages, more particularly as to marriage, food, and questions of\r\nceremonial pollution, and ruling its members by the sanction of certain\r\npenalties of which the most signal is the sentence of irrevocable\r\nexclusion or out-casting. The Census of 1901 was the first to attempt a\r\nthorough classification of Indian castes, and the number of the main\r\ncastes enumerated in it is well over two thousand, each one divided up\r\nagain into almost endless sub-castes. The keystone of the whole caste\r\nsystem is the supremacy of the _quasi_-sacerdotal caste of Brahmans--a\r\ncaste which constitutes in some respects the proudest and closest\r\naristocracy that the world has ever seen, since it is not merely an\r\naristocracy of birth in the strictest sense of the term, but one of\r\ndivine origin. An Indian is either born a Brahman or he is not. No power\r\non earth can make him a Brahman. Not all Brahmans were learned even in\r\nthe old days of Hinduism, though it was to their monopoly of such\r\nlearning as there then was that they owed their ascendancy over the\r\nwarrior kings. Nor do all Brahmans minister in the temples. Strangely\r\nenough the minority who do are looked down upon by their own castemen.\r\nThe majority pursue such worldly avocations, often quite humble, as are\r\npermissible for them under their caste laws. The Brahmans were wise\r\nenough, too, to temper the fundamental rigidity of the system with\r\nsufficient elasticity to absorb the new elements with which it came into\r\ncontact, and in most cases gradually to reabsorb such elements as from\r\ntime to time rebelled against it. The process by which new castes may be\r\nadmitted into the pale of Hinduism, or the status of existing castes be\r\nfrom time to time readjusted to new conditions, has been admirably\r\nexplained by Sir Alfred Lyall. But the process can be worked only under\r\nBrahmanical authority, and the supreme sanction for all caste laws rests\r\nsolely with the Brahmans, whilst of all caste laws the most inexorable\r\nis the supremacy of the Brahman. Therein lies the secret of the great\r\ninfluence which, for good as well as for evil, he has always wielded\r\nover the masses. For though in theory there could be no escape from the\r\nbondage of caste, individuals, and even a whole group, would sometimes\r\nfind ways and means of propitiating the Brahmans who ministered to their\r\nspiritual needs, and the miraculous intervention of a favouring god or\r\nthe discovery of a long-lost but entirely mythical ancestor would secure\r\ntheir social uplift on to a higher rung of the caste-ladder.\r\n\r\nSuch a system, by creating and perpetuating arbitrary and yet almost\r\nimpassable lines of social cleavage, must be fatal to the development of\r\na robust body politic which can only be produced by the reasonable\r\nintermingling and healthy fusion of the different classes of the\r\ncommunity. It was perhaps chief among the causes that left Hinduism with\r\nso little force of organised political cohesion that the Hindu states of\r\nancient India, with their superior culture and civilisation, were sooner\r\nor later swept away by the devastating flood of Mahomedan conquest,\r\nwhilst the social structure of Hinduism, just because it consisted of\r\nsuch an infinity of water-tight compartments each vital and\r\nself-sufficing, could be buffeted again and again and even almost\r\nsubmerged by the waves without ever breaking up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMAHOMEDAN DOMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the great religions that have shaped and are still shaping the\r\ndestinies of the human race, Islam alone was borne forth into the world\r\non a great wave of forceful conquest. Out of the sun-scorched deserts of\r\nArabia, with the Koran in the one hand and the sword in the other, the\r\nfollowers of Mahomed swept eastward to the confines of China, northward\r\nthrough Asia Minor into Eastern Europe, and westward through Africa into\r\nSpain, and even into the heart of medieval France. But it was not till\r\nthe beginning of the eleventh century that the Mahomedan flood began to\r\nroll down into India from the north with the overwhelming momentum of\r\nfierce fanaticism and primitive cupidity behind it--at first mere short\r\nbut furious irruptions, like the seventeen raids of Mahmud of Ghazni\r\nbetween 1001 and 1026, then a more settled tide of conquest, now and\r\nagain checked for a time by dissensions amongst the conquerors quite as\r\nmuch as by some brilliant rally of Hindu religious and patriotic\r\nfervour, but sweeping on again with a fresh impetus until the flood had\r\nspread itself over the whole of the vast peninsula, except the extreme\r\nsouth. For three centuries one wave of invasion followed another, one\r\ndynasty of conquerors displaced another, but whether under Turki or\r\nAfghan rulers, under Slave kings or under the house of Tughluk, there\r\nwas seldom a pause in the consolidation of Mahomedan power, seldom a\r\nbreak in the long-drawn tale of plunder and carnage, cruelty and lust,\r\nunfolded in the annals of the earlier Mahomedan dynasties that ruled at\r\nDelhi. One notable victory Prithvi Raja, the forlorn hope of Hindu\r\nchivalry, won at Thanesvar in 1192 over the Afghan hordes that had\r\nalready driven the last of the Ghaznis from Lahore and were sweeping\r\ndown upon Delhi, but in the following year the gallant young Rajput was\r\ncrushingly defeated, captured, and done to death by a ruthless foe. Then\r\nDelhi fell, and Kutub-ed-Din, in turn the favourite slave, the trusted\r\nlieutenant and the deputed viceroy of the Afghan conqueror, growing\r\ntired of serving an absent master, within a few years threw off his\r\nallegiance. In 1206 he proclaimed himself Emperor of Delhi. That the\r\nSlave Dynasty which he founded was in one respect at least not unworthy\r\nof empire, in spite of the stigma attaching to its worse than servile\r\norigin, the Kutub Minar and the splendid mosque of which it forms part\r\nare there to show. The great minaret, which was begun by Kutub-ed-Din\r\nhimself, upon whose name it has conferred an enduring lustre not\r\notherwise deserved, is beyond comparison the loftiest and the noblest\r\nfrom which the Musulman call to prayer has ever gone forth, nor\r\nis the mosque which it overlooks unworthy to have been called\r\n_Kuwwet-el-Islam_, the Might of Islam. To make room for it the Hindu\r\ntemples, erected by the Rajput builders of the Red Fort, were torn down,\r\nand the half-effaced figures on the columns of the mosque, and many\r\nother conventional designs peculiar to Hindu architecture, betray\r\nclearly the origin of the materials used in its construction. But the\r\ngeneral conception, and especially the grand lines of the screen of\r\narches on the western side, are essentially and admirably Mahomedan. On\r\na slighter scale, but profusely decorated and of exquisite workmanship,\r\nis the tomb of Altamsh, Kutub-ed-Din's successor, and like him\r\noriginally a mere favourite slave.\r\n\r\nIt had been well for these Slave kings had no other record survived of\r\nthem than those which they have left in stone and marble. Great\r\nbuilders and mighty warriors they were in the cause of Allah and his\r\nProphet, but their depravity was only exceeded by their cruelty. The\r\nstory of the whole dynasty is a long-drawn tale of horrors until the\r\nwretched Kaikobad, having turned Delhi for a short three years into a\r\nhouse of ill-fame, was dragged out of his bed and flung into the Jumna,\r\nhis infant child murdered, and the house of Khilji set up where the\r\nSlave kings had reigned. It was the second of these Khilji princes,\r\nAla-ud-Din, who built, alongside of Kutub-ed-Din's mosque, the Alai\r\nDarwazah, the monumental gateway which is not only an exceptionally\r\nbeautiful specimen of external polychromatic decoration, but, to quote\r\nFergusson, \"displays the Pathan style at its period of greatest\r\nperfection, when the Hindu masons had learned to fit their exquisite\r\nstyle of ornamentation to the forms of their foreign masters.\" Yet the\r\natrocities of his twenty years' reign, which was one of almost unbroken\r\nconquest and plunder, wellnigh surpass those of the Slave kings. He had\r\nseized the throne by murdering his old uncle in the act of clasping his\r\nhand, and his own death was, it is said, hastened by poison administered\r\nto him by his favourite eunuch and trusted lieutenant, K[=a]fur, who had\r\nministered to his most ignoble passions. To the Khiljis succeeded the\r\nTughluks, and the white marble dome of Tughluk Shah's tomb still stands\r\nout conspicuous beyond the broken line of grim grey walls which were\r\nonce Tughlukabad. The Khiljis had been overthrown, but the curse of a\r\nMahomedan saint, Sidi Dervish, whose fame has endured to the present\r\nday, still rested upon the Delhi in which they had dwelt. So Mahomed\r\nTughluk built unto himself a new and stronger city, but he did nothing\r\nelse to avert the curse. Indeed, he invented a form of man-hunt which\r\nfor sheer devilish cruelty has been only once matched in the West by the\r\n_cani del duca_ when the crazy Gian Maria ruled in Milan. Well may his\r\nmilder successor, Firuz Shah, have removed to yet another new capital.\r\nWell may he have sought to disarm the wrath to come by pious deeds and\r\nlavish charities. The record he kept of them is not without a certain\r\nnaïve pathos:\r\n\r\n     Under the guidance of the Almighty, I arranged that the heirs of\r\n     those persons who had been slain in the reign of my late Lord and\r\n     Patron, Sultan Mahomed Shah, and those who had been deprived of a\r\n     limb, nose, eye, hand, or foot, should be reconciled to the late\r\n     Sultan and appeased by gifts, so that they executed deeds declaring\r\n     their satisfaction, duly attested by witnesses. These deeds were\r\n     put into a chest, which was placed at the head of the late Sultan's\r\n     grave in the hope that God in his great mercy would show his\r\n     clemency to my late friend and patron and make those persons feel\r\n     reconciled to him.\r\n\r\nThe curse fell upon Delhi in the reign of the next Tughluk, Sultan\r\nMahmud. Timur, with his Mongolian horsemen, swooped down through the\r\nnorthern passes upon Delhi, slaying Mahomedans and Hindus alike and\r\nplundering and burning on all sides as he came. Opposite to the famous\r\nridge, where four and a half centuries later England was to nail her\r\nflag to the mast, he forded the Jumna, having previously slain all\r\ncaptives with his army to the number of 100,000. Mahmud's army, with its\r\n125 elephants, could not withstand the shock. Timur entered Delhi, which\r\nfor five whole days was given over to slaughter and pillage. Then,\r\nhaving celebrated his victory by a great carouse, he proceeded to the\r\nmarble mosque which Firuz Tughluk's piety had erected in atonement of\r\nhis grim predecessor's sins, and solemnly offered up a \"sincere and\r\nhumble tribute of praise\" to God. Within a year he disappeared in the\r\nsame whirl-wind of destruction through the northern passes into his\r\nnative wilds of Central Asia, leaving desolation and chaos behind him.\r\n\r\nFrom so terrific a blow Delhi was slow to recover. A group of\r\npicturesque domes marks the resting-place of some of the Seyyid and Lodi\r\nkings who in turn ruled or misruled the shrunken dominions which still\r\nowned allegiance to Delhi. The achievement of a centralised Mahomedan\r\nempire was delayed for nearly two centuries. But the aggressive vitality\r\nof Islam had not been arrested, and out of the anarchy which followed\r\nTimur's meteoric raid Mahomedan soldiers of fortune built up for\r\nthemselves independent kingdoms and principalities and founded dynasties\r\nwhich each had their own brief moment of power and magnificence. In all\r\nthese states, which spread right across Middle India from the Arabian\r\nSea to the Gulf of Bengal, Islam remained the dominant power; but, even\r\nwhilst trampling upon Hinduism, it did not escape altogether the\r\ninevitable results of increasing contact with an older and more refined\r\ncivilisation. Amidst rapine and bloodshed and the constant clash of\r\narms, it was a period of intense artistic activity which, as usual in\r\nthe countries conquered by Islam, expressed itself chiefly in terms of\r\nstone and marble, and though Hinduism never triumphed as classical\r\npaganism, for instance, triumphed for a time in Papal Rome, the steady\r\nand all-pervading revival of its influence can be traced from capital to\r\ncapital, wherever these Mahomedan _podestas_ established their seat of\r\ngovernment during that Indian _Cinque Cento_, which corresponds in time\r\nwith, and recalls in many ways, though at best distantly, the Italian\r\n_Cinque Cento_, with its strange blend of refined luxury and cruelty, of\r\nhigh artistic achievement and moral depravity.\r\n\r\nTo the present day almost all those cities--some of them now mere cities\r\nof the dead, such as Golconda and Gaur and Mandu, some, such as Bijapur\r\nand Bidar and Ahmednagar and Ahmedabad, still living and even\r\nflourishing--bear witness to the genius of their makers. From motives of\r\npolitical expediency, the Mahomedan rulers of those days, whether\r\nBahmanis or Ahmed Shahis or Adil Shahis or whatever else they were\r\ncalled, were fain to reckon with their Hindu subjects. Wholesale\r\nconversions to the creed of the conquerors, whether spontaneous or\r\ncompulsory, introduced new elements into the ruling race itself; for\r\nconverted Hindus, even when they rose to high positions of trust,\r\nretained many of their own customs and traditions. Differences of\r\nreligion ceased to be a complete bar to matrimonial and other alliances\r\nbetween Mahomedans and Hindus. Even in war Mahomedan mercenaries took\r\nservice with Hindu chiefs, and Hindus under Mahomedan captains. There\r\nwas thus, if not a fusion, a gradual mingling of the Mahomedan and Hindu\r\npopulations which, in spite of many fierce conflicts, tended to promote\r\na new _modus vivendi_ between them. It was a period of transition from\r\nthe era of mere ruthless conquest, which Timur's tempestuous irruption\r\nbrought practically to a close, to the era of constructive\r\nstatesmanship, which it was reserved to Akbar, the greatest of the\r\nMoghul Emperors, to inaugurate.\r\n\r\nEach of these early Mahomedan states has a story and a character of its\r\nown, and each goes to illustrate the subtle ascendancy which the Hindu\r\nmind achieved over the conquering Mahomedan. I can only select a few\r\ntypical examples. None is in its way more striking than Mandu, over\r\nwhose desolation the jungle now spreads its kindly mantle. Within two\r\nyears of Timur's raid into India the Afghan governors of Malwa\r\nproclaimed themselves independent, and Hushang Ghuri, from whom the new\r\ndynasty took its name, proceeded to build himself a new capital. The\r\ngrey grim walls of Mandu still crown a lofty outpost of the Vindhya\r\nhills, some seventy miles south-east of Indore, the natural scarp\r\nfalling away as steeply on the one side to the fertile plateau of Malwa\r\nas on the other to the broad valley of the sacred Nerbudda. The place\r\nhad no Hindu associations, and in the stately palaces and mosques\r\nerected by Hushang and his immediate successors early in the fifteenth\r\ncentury scarcely a trace of Hindu influence can be detected, though some\r\nof them still stand almost intact amidst the luxuriant vegetation which\r\nhas now swallowed up the less substantial remains of what was once a\r\npopulous and wealthy city. The Ghuris came from Afghanistan, and the\r\ngreat mosque of Hushang Ghuri--in spite of inscriptions which say in\r\none place that it has been modelled on the mosque of the Kaaba at Mecca,\r\nand in another place on the great mosque at Damascus--is perhaps the\r\nfinest example of pure Pathan architecture in India, and one of the\r\nhalf-dozen noblest shrines devoted to Mahomedan worship in the whole\r\nworld; a mighty structure of red sandstone and white marble, stern and\r\nsimple, and as perfect in the proportions of its long avenues of pointed\r\narches as in the breadth of its spacious design. Behind it, under a\r\ngreat dome of white marble, Hushang himself sleeps. Unique in its way,\r\ntoo, is the lofty hall of the Hindola Mahal, with its steeply sloping\r\nbuttresses--a hall which has not been inaptly compared to the great\r\ndining-hall of some Oxford or Cambridge College--and alongside of it,\r\nthe more delicate beauty, perhaps already suggestive of Hindu\r\ncollaboration, of the Jahaz Mahal, another palace with hanging balconies\r\nand latticed windows of carved stone overlooking on either side an\r\nartificial lake covered with pink lotus blossoms. Mandu was at first an\r\nessentially Mahomedan city, and under Mahmud Khilji, who wrested the\r\nthrone from Hushang's effete successor, its fame as a centre of Islamic\r\nlearning attracted embassies even from Egypt and Bokhara. But its\r\ngreatness was short-lived. Mahmud's son, Ghijas-ud-Din, had been for\r\nmany years his father's right hand, both in council and in the field.\r\nBut no sooner did he come to the throne in 1469 than he discharged all\r\nthe affairs of the state on to his own son and retired into the\r\nseraglio, where 15,000 women formed his court and provided him even with\r\na bodyguard. Five hundred beautiful young Turki women, armed with bows\r\nand arrows, stood, we are told, on his right hand, and, on his left,\r\nfive hundred Abyssinian girls. Profligate succeeded profligate, and the\r\ndegeneracy of his Mahomedan rulers was the Hindu's opportunity. The\r\npower passed into the hands of Hindu officers, who were even suffered to\r\ntake unto themselves mistresses from among the Mahomedan women of the\r\ncourt. The end came, after many vicissitudes, with Baz Bahadur, chiefly\r\nknown for his passionate devotion to the fair Hindu, Rup Mati, for whom\r\nhe built on the very crest of the hill, so that from her windows she\r\nmight worship the waters of the sacred Nerbudda, the only palace now\r\nsurviving in Mandu which bears a definite impress of Hinduism. Baz\r\nBahadur surrendered to the Emperor Akbar in 1562.\r\n\r\nAt Ahmedabad, on the other hand, the Ahmed Shahi Sultans of Gujerat\r\nfound themselves in presence of an advanced form of Hindu civilisation\r\nas soon as they entered into possession of the kingdom which they\r\nsnatched from the general conflagration. Whether Ahmedabad, which is\r\nstill the modern capital of Gujerat and ranks only second to its\r\nneighbour, Bombay, as a centre of the Indian cotton industry, occupies\r\nor not the exact site of the ancient Karn[=a]vati, Gujerat was a\r\nstronghold of Indian culture long before the Mahomedan invasions.\r\nArchitecture especially had reached a very high standard of development\r\nin the hands of what is usually known as the Jaina school. This is a\r\nmisnomer, for the school was in reality the product of a period rather\r\nthan a sect, though Jainism probably never enjoyed anywhere, or at any\r\ntime, such political ascendancy as in Gujerat under its Rashtrakuta and\r\nSolanki rulers from the ninth to the thirteenth century, and seldom has\r\nthere been such an outburst of architectural activity as amongst the\r\nJains of that period. To the present day the _salats_ or builders,\r\nmostly Jains, have in their keeping, jealously locked away in iron-bound\r\nchests in their temples, many ancient treatises on civil and religious\r\narchitecture, of which only a few abstracts have hitherto been published\r\nin Gujerati, but, as may be seen at Ahmedabad, in the great Jaina temple\r\nof Hathi Singh, built in the middle of the last century at a cost of one\r\nmillion sterling, they have preserved something of the ancient\r\ntraditions of their craft.\r\n\r\nFirishta described Ahmedabad as, in his day, \"the handsomest city in\r\nHindustan and perhaps in the world,\" and very few Indian cities contain\r\nso many beautiful buildings as those with which Ahmedabad was endowed in\r\nthe course of a few decades by its Ahmed Shahi rulers. No one can fail\r\nto admire the wealth of ornamentation and the exquisite workmanship\r\nlavished upon them, though they are not by any means the noblest\r\nmonuments of Mahomedan architecture in India. In fact--and herein lies\r\ntheir peculiar interest--they are Hindu rather than Mahomedan in spirit.\r\nFor they were built by architects of the Jaina school, who were just as\r\nready to work for their Moslem rulers as they had been to work in\r\nearlier times for their Hindu rajas. By the mere force of a civilisation\r\nin many ways superior to that of their conquerors, these builders\r\nimposed upon them, even in the very mosques which they built for them,\r\nmany of the most characteristic features of Hindu architecture. To\r\nobtain, for instance, in a mosque the greater elevation required by the\r\nMahomedans, to whom the dim twilight of a Hindu shrine is repugnant,\r\nthey began by merely superimposing the shafts of two pillars, joining\r\nthem together with blocks to connect the base of the upper with the\r\ncapital of the lower shaft; and this feature in a less crude shape was\r\npermanently retained in the Indo-Mahomedan architecture of Gujerat.\r\nNowhere better than at Ahmedabad can the various stages be followed\r\nthrough which this adaptation of a purely Hindu style to Mahomedan\r\npurposes has passed. It was at first somewhat violent and clumsy. The\r\nearliest mosque in Ahmedabad, that of Ahmed Shah, is practically a Hindu\r\ntemple with a Mahomedan façade, and the figures of animals and of idols\r\ncan still be traced on the interior pillars. The octagonal tomb of Ganj\r\nBakhsh, the spiritual guide of Ahmed Shah, just outside the city at\r\nSarkhij, marks an immense stride, and the adjoining mosque, of which all\r\nthe pillars have the Hindu bracket capitals and all the domes are built\r\non traditional Hindu lines, retains nevertheless its Mahomedan\r\ncharacter. Still more wonderful is the blend achieved in the mosque and\r\ntomb of Ranee Sepree, the consort of Mahmud Bigarah, who was perhaps the\r\nmost magnificent of the Mahomedan kings of Gujerat. It was completed in\r\n1514, just a hundred years after the foundation of the Ahmed Shahi\r\ndynasty, and it shows the distance travelled in the course of one\r\ncentury towards something like a fusion of Hindu and Mahomedan ideals in\r\nthe domain at least of architecture.\r\n\r\nIn Bijapur alone, of all the great Mahomedan cities of that period which\r\nI have seen, did the proud austerity of Mahomedan architecture shake\r\nitself free from the complex and flamboyant suggestions of Hindu\r\nart--perhaps because the great days of Bijapur came after it had taken\r\nits full share of the spoils of Vijianagar, the last kingdom in Southern\r\nIndia to perish by the sword of Islam. Having laid low the Hindu \"City\r\nof Victory,\" the conquerors determined to make the Mahomedan \"City of\r\nVictory\" eclipse the magnificence of all that they had destroyed. The\r\nGol Kumbaz, the great round dome over the lofty quadrangular hall in\r\nwhich Sultan Mahomed Adil Shah lies under a plain slab of marble, is an\r\nalmost perfect hemisphere, which encloses the largest domed space in the\r\nworld, and it dominates the Deccan tableland just as the dome of St.\r\nPeter's dominates the Roman Campagna. To such heights Hindu architecture\r\ncan never soar, for it eschews the arched dome; and beautiful as the\r\nHindu cupola may be with its concentric mouldings and the superimposed\r\ncircular courses horizontally raised on an octagonal architrave which\r\nrests on symmetrical groups of pillars, it cannot attain anything like\r\nthe same bold span or the same lofty elevation. Have we not there a\r\nsymbol of the fundamental antagonism between Hindu and Mahomedan\r\nconceptions in many other domains than that of architecture? Even if the\r\nArabs did not originate the pointed arch, it has always been one of the\r\nmost beautiful and characteristic features of Mahomedan architecture.\r\nThe Hindu, on the other hand, has never built any such arch except\r\nunder compulsion.\r\n\r\nTo unite India under Mahomedan rule and attempt to bridge the gulf that\r\ndivided the alien race of Mahomedan conquerors from the conquered Hindus\r\nrequired more stedfast hands and a loftier genius than those Mahomedan\r\n_condottieri_ possessed. A new power more equal to the task was already\r\nstorming at the northern gates of India. On a mound thirty-five miles\r\nnorth of Delhi, near the old bed of the Jumna, there still stands a\r\nsmall town which has thrice given its name to one of those momentous\r\nbattles that decide the fate of nations. It is Panipat. There, on April\r\n21, 1526, Baber the Lion, fourth in descent from Timur, overthrew the\r\nlast of the Lodis. Like his terrible ancestor, he had fought his way\r\ndown from Central Asia at the head of a great army of Tartar horsemen;\r\nbut, unlike Timur, he fought not for mere plunder and slaughter, but for\r\nempire. He has left us in his own memoirs an incomparable picture of his\r\nremarkable and essentially human personality, and it was his\r\nstatesmanship as much as his prowess that laid the rough foundations\r\nupon which the genius of his grandson Akbar was to rear the great fabric\r\nof the Moghul Empire as it was to stand for two centuries. Though it was\r\nat Delhi that, three days after the battle of Panipat, Baber proclaimed\r\nhimself Emperor, no visible monument of his reign is to be seen there\r\nto-day. But the white marble dome and lofty walls and terraces of his\r\nson Humayun's mausoleum, raised on a lofty platform out of a sea of dark\r\ngreen foliage, are, next to the Kutub Minar, the most conspicuous\r\nfeature in the plain of Delhi. Endowed with many brilliant and amiable\r\nqualities, Humayun was not made of the same stuff as either his father\r\nor his son. Driven out of India by the Afghans, whom Baber had defeated\r\nbut not subdued, he had, it is true, in a great measure reconquered it,\r\nwhen a fall from the top of the terraced roof of his palace at Delhi\r\ncaused his death at the early age of forty-eight. But would he have\r\nbeen able to retain it? He had by no means crushed the forces of\r\nrebellion which the usurper Sher Shah had united against Moghul rule,\r\nand which were still holding the field under the leadership of the\r\nbrilliant Hindu adventurer Hemu. Delhi itself was lost within a few\r\nmonths of Humayun's death, and it was again at Panipat, just thirty\r\nyears after his grandfather's brilliant victory, that the boy Akbar had\r\nin his turn to fight for the empire of Hindustan. He too fought and won,\r\nand when he entered Delhi on the very next day, the empire was his to\r\nmould and to fashion at the promptings of his genius.\r\n\r\nAkbar was not yet fourteen, but, precocious even for the East, he was\r\nalready a student and a thinker as well as an intrepid fighter. He\r\nshowed whither his meditations were leading him as soon as he took the\r\nreins of government into his own hands. There had been great conquerors\r\nbefore him in India, men of his own race and creed--the blood of Timur\r\nflowed in his veins--and men of other races and of other creeds. They\r\ntoo had founded dynasties and built up empires, but their dynasties had\r\npassed away, their empires had crumbled to pieces. What was the reason?\r\nWas it not that they had established their dominion on force alone, and\r\nthat when force ceased to be vitalised by their own great personalities\r\ntheir dominion, having struck no root in the soil, withered away and\r\nperished? Akbar, far ahead of his times, determined to try another and a\r\nbetter way by seeking the welfare of the populations he subdued, by\r\ndispensing equal justice to all races and creeds, by courting loyal\r\nservice from Hindus as well as Mahomedans, by giving them a share on\r\nterms of complete equality in the administration of the country, by\r\nbreaking down the social barriers between them, even those which hedge\r\nin the family. He was a soldier, and he knew when and how to use force,\r\nbut he never used force alone. He subdued the Rajput states, but he won\r\nthe allegiance of their princes and himself took a consort from among\r\ntheir daughters. With their help he reduced the independent Mahomedan\r\nkings of Middle India, from Gujerat in the West to Bengal in the East.\r\nHe created a homogeneous system of civil administration which our own\r\nstill in many respects resembles, the revenue system especially, which\r\nwas based on ancient Hindu custom, having survived with relatively\r\nslight modifications to the present day.\r\n\r\nPolitical uniformity had been achieved, at least over a very large area\r\nof India. A great stride had been made towards real unity and social\r\nfusion. Nevertheless Akbar felt that, so long as the fierce religious\r\nexclusivism of Islam on the one hand, and the rigidity of the Hindu\r\ncaste system on the other, were not fundamentally modified there could\r\nbe no security for the future against the revival of the old and\r\ndeep-seated antagonism between the two races and creeds. He was himself\r\nlearned in Islamic doctrine; he caused some of the Brahmanical sacred\r\nbooks to be translated into Persian--the cultured language of his\r\ncourt--so that he could study them for himself; and he invited\r\nChristians and Zoroastrians, as well as Hindus and Mahomedans of\r\ndifferent schools of thought, to confer with him and discuss in his\r\npresence the relative merits of their religious systems. The deserted\r\npalaces of Fatehpur Sikri, which he planned out and built with all his\r\ncharacteristic energy as a royal residence, only about twenty-two miles\r\ndistant from the imperial city of Agra, still stand in a singularly\r\nperfect state of preservation that enables one to reconstruct with\r\nexceptional vividness the life of the splendid court over which the\r\ngreatest of the Moghul Emperors--the contemporary of our own great Queen\r\nElizabeth--presided during perhaps the most characteristic years of his\r\nlong reign. Within the enceinte of his palace were grouped the chief\r\noffices of the State, the Treasury, the Record Office, the Council\r\nChamber, the Audience Hall, some of them monuments of architectural\r\nskill and of decorative taste, more often bearing the impress of Hindu\r\nthan of Mahomedan inspiration. For his first wife, Sultana Rakhina, who\r\nwas also his first cousin, Akbar built the Jodh Bai palace, whilst over\r\nagainst it, in the beautiful \"Golden House,\" dwelt his Rajput consort,\r\nMiriam-uz-Zemani, who bore him the future Emperor Jehanghir. Nor did he\r\nforget his favourite friends and counsellors. Upon no building in\r\nFatehpur has such a wealth of exquisite ornamentation been lavished as\r\nupon the dainty palace of Raja Birbal, the most learned and illustrious\r\nHindu, who gave his spiritual as well as his political allegiance to\r\nAkbar. The Mahomedan brothers Abul Fazl and Faizi, whose conversation,\r\nuntrammelled by orthodoxy, so largely influenced his religious\r\nevolution, had their house close to the great mosque, sacred to the\r\nmemory of a Mahomedan saint who, according to popular legend, sacrificed\r\nthe life of his own infant son in order that Akbar's should live. In the\r\ngreat hall of the Ibadat Khaneh, built by him for the purpose, Akbar\r\nhimself took part in the disputations of learned men of all\r\ndenominations in search of religious truth. The spirit which inspired\r\nAkbar during that period of his life breathes nowhere more deeply than\r\nin one of the inscriptions which he chose for the \"Gate of Victory,\" the\r\nlofty portal, perhaps the most splendid in India, leading up to the\r\nspacious mosque quadrangle: \"Jesus, on whom be peace, said: 'The world\r\nis a bridge. Pass over it, but build not upon it. The world endures but\r\nan hour; spend that hour in devotion.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was at Fatehpur that Akbar sought to set the seal upon his conquests\r\nin peace and in war by evolving from a comparative study of all the\r\nreligions of his empire some permanent remedy for the profound\r\ndenominational and racial discords by which, unless he could heal them,\r\nhe foresaw that his life's work would assuredly some day be wrecked. Did\r\nhe despair of any remedy unless he took the spiritual law, as he had\r\nalready taken the civil law, into his own hands? Or was even as noble a\r\nmind as his not proof against the overweening _hubris_ to which a\r\ndespotic genius has so often succumbed? One momentous evening, in the\r\nHall of Disputations, he caused, or allowed, his devoted friend and\r\nconfidant, Abul Fazl, to proclaim the Emperor's infallibility in the\r\ndomain of faith. From claiming the right to explain away the Koran,\r\nwhich is the corner-stone of Islam, its alpha and omega, to repudiating\r\nit altogether, there was but a short step. Akbar very soon took it. He\r\npromulgated a new religion, which he called the Din-i-Ilahi, and a new\r\nprofession of faith, which, instead of the old Islamic formula, \"There\r\nis no God but God, and Mahomed is his prophet,\" proclaimed indeed in the\r\nsame words the unity of God, but declared Akbar to be the one Viceregent\r\nof God. The new religion, theistic in doctrine, not only borrowed its\r\nprayers chiefly from the Parsees and its ritual from the Hindus, but\r\npractically abolished all Mahomedan observances. The orthodox Mahomedans\r\nnaturally held up their hands in horror, and many preferred honourable\r\nexile to conformity. But the awe which Akbar inspired, and perhaps the\r\nacknowledged elevation of his motives, generally compelled at least\r\noutward acceptance during his lifetime. His Mahomedan subjects had,\r\nmoreover, to admit that his desire to conciliate Hinduism did not blind\r\nhim to its most perverse features. Whilst he abolished the capitation\r\ntax on Hindus and the tax upon Hindu pilgrims, he forbade infant\r\nmarriages and, short of absolute prohibition, did all he could to\r\ndiscountenance the self-immolation of Hindu widows. To the Brahmans\r\nespecially his condemnation, both implied and explicit, of the caste\r\nsystem was a constant stone of offence.\r\n\r\nGreat as was his genius and admirable as were many of his institutions,\r\nAkbar, to use a homely phrase, fell between two stools to the ground. He\r\nhimself ceased to be a Mahomedan without becoming a Hindu, whilst the\r\ngreat bulk at least of his subjects still remained at bottom Mahomedans\r\nand Hindus as before. Neither community was ripe for an eclectic creed\r\nbased only upon sweet reasonableness and lofty ethical conceptions. His\r\nson and successor, Jehanghir, at once reverted to Mahomedan orthodoxy,\r\nbut the reaction only became militant when Aurungzeb succeeded Shah\r\nJehan. The profound incompatibility between Islam and Hinduism\r\nreasserted itself in him with a bitterness which the growing menace of\r\nthe rising power of the Hindu Mahrattas probably helped to intensify.\r\nThe reimposition of the poll-tax on the Hindus destroyed the last\r\nvestige of the great work of conciliation to which Akbar had vainly\r\napplied all his brilliant energies. Like Fatehpur Sikri itself, which\r\nfor lack of water he had been compelled to abandon within fifteen years\r\nof its construction, it was a magnificent failure, and it was perhaps\r\nbound in his time to be a failure.\r\n\r\nAurungzeb was the first of the Moghuls to reside in the Mahomedan\r\natmosphere of Delhi throughout his long reign. But, begun in usurpation\r\nat the cost of his own father, it ended in misery and gloom. His sons\r\nhad revolted against him, his sombre fanaticism had estranged from him\r\nthe Rajput princes of whom Akbar had made the pillars of the Moghul\r\nthrone, and though he had reduced to subjection the last of the\r\nindependent Mahomedan kingdoms of India, he had exhausted his vast\r\nmilitary resources in long and fruitless endeavours to arrest the growth\r\nof the new Mahratta power, to which Shivaji had not unsuccessfully\r\nattempted to rally the spiritual forces of disaffected Hinduism. In the\r\nincapable hands of Aurungzeb's successors, whilst the Delhi palace\r\nbecame a hotbed of squalid and often sanguinary intrigue, disintegration\r\nproceeded with startling rapidity. Revolt followed revolt within, and\r\nthe era of external invasions was reopened. Nadir Shah swept down from\r\nPersia and, after two months' carnage and plunder, carried off from\r\nDelhi booty to the value of thirty-two millions, including the famous\r\nPeacock Throne. Then the Afghans again broke through the northern\r\npasses. Six times in the course of fourteen years did Ahmed Shah Durani\r\ncarry fire and sword through Northern India. One service, however, the\r\nAfghan rendered. From the Deccan, where a great Mahratta confederacy\r\nhad grown up under the Poona Peishwa, the Mahrattas slowly but surely\r\nclosed in upon Delhi. Another great battle was fought at Panipat between\r\nthe Afghan invaders from the North and the flower of the Mahratta army.\r\nThe Mahrattas endured a crushing defeat, which, together with treachery\r\nwithin their own ranks, broke up the confederacy and prepared the\r\ndownfall of their military power, which British arms were to complete.\r\n\r\nFor whilst the Moghul Empire was rapidly breaking up, the oversea\r\npenetration of India by the ocean route, which the Portuguese had been\r\nthe first to open up at the beginning of the sixteenth century, was\r\nprogressing apace. Of all those who had followed in the wake of the\r\nPortuguese--Dutch and Danes and Spaniards and French and British--the\r\nBritish alone had come to stay. After Panipat the wretched emperor, Shah\r\nAlam II., actually took refuge at Allahabad under British protection,\r\nand stayed there for some years as a pensioner of the East India\r\nCompany, already a power in the land. Well for him had he remained\r\nthere, for he returned to Delhi only to be buffeted, first by one\r\nfaction and then by another. Ghulam Kadir, the Rohilla, blinded him in\r\nthe very Hall of Audience which bears the famous inscription, \"If a\r\nparadise there be on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here\"; and\r\nwhen the Mahrattas rescued him he merely exchanged jailers. He was\r\nalready an old man, decrepit and sightless, when in 1803, in the same\r\nHall of Audience, he welcomed his deliverer in Lord Lake, who had routed\r\nthe Mahratta forces, almost within sight of his palace, between\r\nHumayun's tomb and the river Jumna. Then, perhaps for the first time in\r\nher history, India knew peace; for though two more descendants of the\r\nMoghul Emperors were still suffered to retain at Delhi the insignia of\r\nroyalty, Mahomedan domination was over and her destinies had passed into\r\nthe strong keeping of the British, who have sought to fulfil, on\r\ndifferent and sounder lines, the purpose which had inspired the noblest\r\nof Akbar's dreams.\r\n\r\nBut throughout all those centuries of Mahomedan domination the enduring\r\npower of Hinduism had bent without ever breaking to the storm, even in\r\nNorthern India, where it was exposed to the full blast of successive\r\ntempests. Many of its branches withered or were ruthlessly lopped off,\r\nbut its roots were too firmly and too deeply embedded in the soil to be\r\nfatally injured. It continued indeed to throw off fresh shoots. The same\r\nprocess of adaptation, assimilation, and absorption, which had been\r\ngoing on for centuries before the Mahomedan conquest, without ever being\r\npermanently or even very deeply affected by the vicissitudes of Indian\r\npolitical history, went on throughout all the centuries of Mahomedan\r\ndomination. Whilst millions of Hindus were, it is true, being forcibly\r\nconverted to Islam, Hinduism, making good its losses to a great extent\r\nby the complete elimination of Buddhism, and by permeating the Dravidian\r\nraces of Southern India, continued its own social and religious\r\nevolution. It was, in fact, after the tide of Mahomedan conquest had set\r\nin that Hindu theology put on fresh forms of interpretation. The rivalry\r\nbetween the cults of Shiva and of Vishnu became more acute, and many of\r\nthe Dharmashastras and Puranas were recast and elaborated by Shivaite\r\nand Vishnuite writers respectively in the form in which we now know\r\nthem, thus affording contemporary and graphic pictures of the\r\npersistency of Hindu life and manners after India had lost all political\r\nindependence. It was then, too, that Krishna rose to be perhaps the most\r\npopular of Hindu gods, and the divine love, of which he was at first the\r\npersonification, was to a great extent lost sight of in favour of his\r\nhuman amours, whilst the works known as the Tantras, deriving in their\r\norigin from the ancient ideas of sexual dualism immanent in some of the\r\nVedic deities, developed the customary homage paid to the consorts of\r\nthe great gods into the Sakti worship of the female principle, often\r\nwith ritual observances either obscene or sanguinary or both. Possibly\r\nas a result of closer contact with primitive Dravidian religions, or of\r\nsuch wild lawlessness as followed the barbarous devastation wrought by\r\nTimur, the blood even of human victims flowed more freely before the\r\naltars of the Mahamatri, the great goddesses personified in Kali and\r\nDurga. The worship of the gods assumed a more terrific and orgiastic\r\ncharacter. _Sati_ was more frequently practised. Many of the most\r\nsplendid and, at the present day, most famous temples--amongst others\r\nthat of Jaganath at Puri--were founded during that period. The custom,\r\nin itself very ancient, of religious pilgrimages to celebrated shrines\r\nand to the banks and sources of specially sacred rivers, was consecrated\r\nin elaborate manuals which became text-books of ritual as well as of\r\nreligious geography. Much of what might be regarded as the degeneration\r\nof Hinduism from its earlier and more spiritual forms into gross\r\nidolatry and licentiousness, may well have been in itself a reaction\r\nagainst the iconoclastic monotheism of the politically triumphant\r\nMahomedans. Caste, which was as foreign to Islam as to Christianity, but\r\nnevertheless retained its hold upon Indian converts to Islam as it has\r\nalso in later times upon Indian converts to the Christian creeds, tended\r\nto harden still further; for caste has ever been the keystone of\r\nHinduism, and, as Mahomedan power gradually waned, Hinduism reasserted\r\nitself in a spirit of both religious and national rebellion against\r\nMahomedan domination.\r\n\r\nThe most permanent, or at least the most signal, mark which Mahomedan\r\nascendancy has left upon Hinduism has been to accentuate the inferiority\r\nof woman by her close confinement--of which there are few traces in\r\nearlier times--within the zenana, possibly in the first instance a\r\nprecautionary measure for her protection against the lust of the\r\nMahomedan conquerors. Her seclusion still constitutes one of the\r\ngreatest obstacles to Indian social and religious reform. For, as custom\r\nrequires an Indian girl to be shut up in the zenana at the very age when\r\nher education, except in quite elementary schools, should commence, the\r\nwomen of India, even in the classes in which the men of India have been\r\ndrawn into the orbit by Western education, have until recently remained\r\nand still for the most part remain untouched by it, and their innate\r\nconservatism clings to social traditions and religious superstitions of\r\nwhich their male belongings have already been taught to recognise the\r\nevils. In this respect Mahomedan domination has helped to strengthen the\r\nforces of resistance inherent to Hinduism.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mahomedan domination has left behind it a deep line\r\nof religious cleavage, deepest in the north, which was the seat of\r\nMahomedan power, but extending to almost every part of India. Sixty-six\r\nmillions of Indians out of three hundred millions are still Mahomedans,\r\nand though time has in a large measure effaced the racial differences\r\nbetween the original Mahomedan conquerors and the indigenous populations\r\nconverted to their creed, the religious antagonism between Islam and\r\nHinduism, though occasionally and temporarily sunk in a sense of common\r\nhostility to alien rulers who are neither Mahomedans nor Hindus, is\r\nstill one of the most potent factors not only in the social but in the\r\npolitical life of India, both indelibly moulded from times immemorial by\r\nthe supreme force of religion. We have a pale reflection of that sort of\r\nantagonism at our own doors in the bitterness between Protestants and\r\nRoman Catholics in Ulster. All over India, Mahomedans and Hindus alike\r\nremember the centuries of Mahomedan domination, the latter with the\r\nbitterness bred of the long oppression that struck down their gods and\r\nmutilated their shrines, the former with the unquenched pride and\r\nunquenchable hope of a fierce faith which will yet, they believe, make\r\nthe whole world subject to Allah, the one God, and Mahomed, his one\r\nProphet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBRITISH RULE UNDER THE EAST INDIA COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basic fact which has governed the whole evolution of British rule in\r\nIndia is that we went there in the first instance as traders, and not as\r\nconquerors. For trade meant co-operation. There could be no successful\r\ntrading for British traders unless they found Indian traders ready to\r\nco-operate with them in trade. That we ever went to India at all was due\r\nto the national instincts of an insular people accustomed to go down to\r\nthe sea in ships and to trade with distant lands. When the rise of great\r\nMahomedan states on the southern and eastern shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and finally the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks,\r\nblocked the overland trade routes from Christendom into the Orient, our\r\nforefathers determined to emulate the example of the Spaniards and\r\nPortuguese and open up new ocean highways to the remote markets credited\r\nwith fabulous wealth which would have been otherwise lost to them\r\nindefinitely. The handful of English merchant-venturers who under Queen\r\nElizabeth's charter first established three hundred years ago a few\r\nprecarious settlements on the far-flung shores of a then almost unknown\r\ncontinent no more dreamt of ruling India than did the great East India\r\nCompany of which they had laid the foundations when it first sought to\r\nextend its trading operations into the interior and sent an embassy to\r\ncourt the goodwill of the mighty Moghul emperors then at the height of\r\ntheir power. Throughout those early days co-operation between Indians\r\nand Englishmen, though then for the sole purpose of trade, was the\r\nprinciple that guided British enterprise in India, and the venturers\r\nwould never have grown and thriven as they did had they not laid\r\nthemselves out to secure the confidence and co-operation of the Indians\r\nwho flocked to their \"factories.\" At home too it was not dominion, but\r\nthe profits derived from the Indian trade that occupied the mind of the\r\nnation. Not till the disintegration of the Moghul Empire in the\r\neighteenth century plunged India into a welter of anarchy which\r\nendangered not only our trade but the safety of our settlements, which,\r\nlike the foreign settlements in the Chinese Treaty Ports to-day,\r\nattracted in increasing numbers an indigenous population in search of\r\nsecurity for life and property, did the Directors of the East India\r\nCompany consent to depart from their policy of absolute non-intervention\r\nin the internal affairs of India. Nor was it till, in the course of the\r\ngreat duel between England and France for the mastery of the seas which\r\nonly ended at Trafalgar, the genius of Dupleix threatened the very\r\nexistence of the East India Company that the British nation began to\r\nface the responsibilities of British dominion in India as the only\r\nalternative to the greater danger of French dominion. It was the French\r\nchallenge to Britain's position all over the world far more than any\r\ndeliberate policy of conquest in India that drove successive agents of\r\nthe East India Company to enlarge the area of British authority, and\r\nsuccessive Governments at home to acquiesce and aid in its enlargement,\r\nuntil ultimately the whole peninsula was made subject to the paramount\r\nBritish power from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin.\r\n\r\nBut even that long period of irresistible expansion was a period of\r\nalmost constant co-operation between British and Indians. The East India\r\nCompany extended its authority quite as much by a system of alliances\r\nwith indigenous rulers, who turned to our growing power to save them\r\nfrom destruction at the hands of Haidar Ali or of the Mahratta\r\nconfederacy, as by mere force of arms, and, when it had to use force,\r\nits most decisive victories in the field were won by armies in which\r\nIndian troops fought shoulder to shoulder with British troops. At\r\nPlassey in 1757 and at Buxar in 1764, when the destinies of India were\r\nstill in the balance, the British, though the backbone of the Company's\r\nforces, formed only a tithe numerically of the victorious armies that\r\nfought under Clive and Munro. The traditions of loyal comradeship\r\nbetween the Indian and the British army, only once and for a short time\r\nseriously broken during the Mutiny of 1857, can be traced back to the\r\nearliest days of British ascendancy, just as the map of India to-day,\r\nwith hundreds of native States, covering one-third of the total area and\r\nnearly one-fourth of the total population under the autonomous rulership\r\nof their own ancient dynasties, testifies to the wisdom and moderation\r\nwhich inspired the policy of the East India Company in preferring,\r\nwherever circumstances made co-operation possible, co-operation based\r\nupon alliances to submission enforced by the sword.\r\n\r\nIn the same spirit there grew up at home with the extension of British\r\ndominion in India a definite determination on the part of the British\r\nGovernment and the British people to control the methods by which\r\nBritish dominion was to be exercised and maintained. So when the British\r\nin India ceased to be mere traders and became administrators and rulers,\r\nthey had behind them not only the driving power, but the restraining\r\nforce also, of a civilisation which was producing in England new\r\nconceptions of personal rights destined profoundly to affect the\r\nrelations between those who govern and those who are governed. Those\r\nconceptions which underlay both the great Cromwellian upheaval and the\r\nmore peaceful revolution of 1688 were at first limited in their\r\napplication to the free people of Britain, but they began before long to\r\ninfluence also the attitude of the British people towards the alien\r\nraces brought under their sway. The motives which prompted English\r\ncolonial enterprise in its earliest stages did not differ materially\r\nfrom those which prompted the Spanish and the Portuguese, the Dutch and\r\nthe French. All were impelled primarily by the desire to attain wealth.\r\nBut whilst our competitors never got much beyond that stage, and for the\r\nmost part imagined that the only way to attain wealth was by a crude\r\nexploitation of subject countries and peoples, the British were saved\r\nfrom similar short-sightedness by the very different spirit with which\r\nthe development of their own national institutions had imbued their\r\nrulers at home. By the middle of the eighteenth century a British\r\nGovernment had a very different sense of its responsibilities to the\r\nBritish people for the welfare of the nation as a whole from that which\r\nany continental ruler had been taught to entertain in regard to his own\r\npeople. That sense of responsibility the British Government and the\r\nBritish people applied in a modified form to the administration of their\r\nIndian possessions.\r\n\r\nSo long as British settlements were confined to trading factories on the\r\nshores of the Indian Ocean, the problems of administration were simple.\r\nThe three \"Presidents\" who with their large and rather unwieldy Councils\r\ncarried on at the beginning of the eighteenth century the affairs of the\r\nEast India Company on the west coast, at Madras and in Bengal were\r\nchiefly concerned with commercial operations, and they provided in their\r\nown way and out of their own resources for the maintenance of the public\r\npeace within the narrow areas subject to their jurisdiction. But matters\r\nassumed a very different complexion when instead of merely taking\r\nabundant tithe of the wealth acquired by the enterprise and ability of\r\nBritish traders in a far-away land, the British people had to lend\r\nfinancial and military assistance in order to rescue the East India\r\nCompany from destruction at the hands of their French rivals as well as\r\nfrom the overwhelming ruin of internecine strife all over India. The\r\ngrant of the _Diwani_ to the Company by the titular Emperor of Delhi\r\ngave the Company not only the wealth of Bengal, the richest province in\r\nIndia, but full rights of government and administration, which were at\r\nfirst ruthlessly exercised with little or no regard for the interests of\r\nthe unfortunate population, who alone gained nothing by the change. The\r\nmagnitude of the financial transactions between the Company and the\r\nBritish Government, which was sometimes heavily subsidised by the\r\nCompany's coffers and then in turn compelled to make considerable\r\nadvances in order to replenish them, and the splendour of the fortunes\r\namassed by many of the Company's servants who returned from India to\r\nspend them in ostentatious luxury and in political intrigue at home,\r\ncombined with the brilliant achievements of British arms on Indian soil\r\nto focus public attention on Indian affairs. They became one of the live\r\nissues of British party politics.\r\n\r\nThere was much that was squalid and grossly unjust in the rancorous\r\ncampaigns conducted first against Clive and then against Warren\r\nHastings. But behind all the personal jealousies and the greed of\r\nfactions there was a strong and healthy public instinct that the\r\nresponsibilities assumed by the East India Company were greater than a\r\ntrading association could safely be left to discharge uncontrolled, and\r\nthat the State could not divest itself of the duties imposed upon it by\r\nthe acquisition of vast and populous possessions. It would be idle to\r\npretend that the British people already entertained any definite\r\nconception of a tutelary relationship towards the peoples of India, or\r\nwere animated by purely philanthropic solicitude for the moral welfare\r\nof India. But the passionate oratory of Fox and Burke and their fervid\r\ndenunciation of oppression and wrongdoing in India awoke responsive\r\nechoes far beyond the walls of Westminster. In 1762, when France had\r\nclaimed, in the course of the peace negotiations which led to the Treaty\r\nof Paris, the restitution of the possessions she had lost to the East\r\nIndia Company, the British Government pleaded the absence of \"any right\r\nof the Crown of England to interfere in the legal and exclusive property\r\nof a body corporate.\" Only eleven years later, the House of Commons\r\npassed resolutions to the effect that \"all acquisitions made under the\r\ninfluence of military force or by treaty with foreign princes do of\r\nright belong to the State,\" and the Commons had the country behind them.\r\nFrom 1773 onward British public opinion never hesitated to support\r\nParliament in claiming and exercising supreme control over Indian\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nA very brief survey of the long series of enactments in which\r\nParliament, asserting the right of \"eminent dominion over every British\r\nsubject in every country,\" gradually established its authority over\r\nIndian administration and moulded it to the shape which it virtually\r\npreserved until the Crown assumed direct sovereignty in 1858, shows how\r\nsteadily the strengthening of Parliamentary control kept pace with the\r\nextension of British dominion in India. The first of these legislative\r\nmeasures was Lord North's Regulating Act, which was passed in 1773, just\r\neight years after the East India Company had acquired for the first time\r\nthe right of revenue and civil administration over vast territories in\r\nBengal and in the Madras \"Northern Circars,\" and thereby taken over the\r\nduties of government in respect of a great native population, absolutely\r\nalien in race, in religion, and in customs. Lord North's Act did not\r\nattack directly the problem of Indian government, but it sought to\r\nfacilitate its solution by the East India Company itself by reforming\r\nits constitution at home, where the jealousies and intrigues of rival\r\nfactions in the Board of Directors had often reached the dimensions of a\r\npublic scandal, and by centralising the Company's authority in India,\r\nwhere, as the result of recent developments which had now established\r\nthe centre of British gravity in Bengal, the post of Governor-General\r\nwas created for the Bengal Presidency and invested with powers of\r\ncontrol over the other Presidencies, Madras and Bombay, which had\r\nhitherto enjoyed a status of practical equality. At the same time an\r\nattempt was made to strengthen control from home by enjoining upon the\r\nGovernor-General to keep the Board of Directors in London fully informed\r\nand to abide by its instructions, whilst a check was placed upon the\r\nexecutive authority in Bengal by the creation of a Supreme Court in\r\nCalcutta from which the present High Court is descended.\r\n\r\nThe defect of this legislation--a defect inherent to the situation in\r\nIndia itself--was the dualism it created by endeavouring to enforce\r\nParliamentary restraints upon a Company which derived its title to\r\ngovernment over the greater part of its possessions from the\r\nirresponsible despotism of the Moghul emperors. The Company was thus\r\nmade to serve two masters, and at the same time it remained essentially\r\na great trading corporation whose commercial and fiscal interests were\r\nalways liable to conflict, and sometimes did conflict, with its duties\r\ntowards both masters. The total collapse of the Moghul Empire removed\r\nbefore long one of the ambiguities of this situation, but the other\r\nendured in a greater or less degree until the East India Company itself\r\ndisappeared, though every subsequent measure of Indian legislation at\r\nhome tended to bring the Indian executive more and more fully under the\r\ncontrol of the home Government.\r\n\r\nEleven years later Pitt's famous Government of India Act of 1784 marked\r\na very important step forward. Another great war had been brought to an\r\nend by the Peace of Versailles in 1783, and whilst at its close we had\r\nlost the greater part of our North American Colonies, the genius of\r\nWarren Hastings had saved and consolidated British power in India. It\r\nwas easy to criticise, and if we are to judge in accordance with modern\r\nstandards, it is doubtless right to condemn some of the devices to which\r\nhe resorted in the course of the long struggle he was often left to wage\r\nwith little or no help, and sometimes in the face of active obstruction\r\nfrom those who, at home and in India, should have been the first to\r\nsupport him. Whatever his errors may have been, they were more than\r\natoned for by the cruel persecution to which he was subjected whilst\r\nEngland was harvesting the fruits of his energy and courage. Pitt's Act\r\nwas in fact the solemn consecration of all his greatest achievements,\r\nwhilst it brought India into closer and more direct relationship with\r\nthe Crown. Not the least of the difficulties with which Hastings, the\r\nonly Governor-General appointed by the East India Company, was\r\nconfronted arose from frequent opposition in his own Council, where he\r\nwas merely _primus inter pares_. Pitt took care to provide against the\r\nrecurrence of similar trouble in the future. But having strengthened the\r\nGovernor-General's position, he took away the right of appointing him\r\nfrom the Company and transferred it to the Crown. Nor was that all. The\r\nCompany itself was placed under the effective control of the Crown by\r\nthe establishment in London of a Board of Control, of which the\r\nPresident was ultimately to develop into the Secretary of State for\r\nIndia, over the Courts of Directors and Proprietors. In substance, if\r\nnot in form, India was already becoming a Dependency of the British\r\nCrown.\r\n\r\nNor was Pitt's Act concerned only with the relations of the Company to\r\nthe Crown. Its numerous and very drastic provisions for the prevention\r\nand punishment of the corruption and oppression which had become rampant\r\namongst the Company's servants after the grant of the _Diwani_ testified\r\nto the determination of Parliament, whilst acquiescing in the extension\r\nof the British dominion, to uphold and enforce at the same time in the\r\ngovernance of Indian peoples the principle of justice for all to which\r\nthe British people had gradually fought their way. A strong impetus was\r\nthus given to the great reforms already initiated by Clive himself, and\r\nstill more drastically by Warren Hastings, which, within the framework\r\nas far as possible of the old indigenous system of judicial and civil\r\nadministration, built up on solid foundations of integrity and\r\nefficiency a capacious and elastic structure easily extended to the vast\r\nterritories that were still to pass under British rule. But then no\r\nmore than at any later period could the machinery of government have\r\nworked smoothly, or even at all, without the co-operation of the Indians\r\nthemselves, who were recruited in large numbers into the Company's\r\nservice. Respect for their traditional customs and beliefs, and\r\nencouragement, of which Warren Hastings was the first to recognise the\r\nimportance, to Indian education, though still only on the old lines with\r\nwhich Indians were already familiar, secured the growing loyalty of\r\ntheir co-operation. Then, as now, it was nowhere more effective than in\r\nthe judicial administration, and side by side with new tribunals, which\r\nconformed with Western jurisprudence, the old ones, purified and\r\nreorganised, continued to dispense justice in accordance mainly with\r\nHindu and Mahomedan and Indian customary law. With the consolidation of\r\nthe British Paramount Power Indians learnt to identify it with their\r\nancient conception of the State, and the Company's service came to enjoy\r\nthe popularity and prestige which had always attached to the service of\r\nthe State under their indigenous rulers and even under Mahomedan\r\ndomination.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of the Company's Charter, which took place at intervals of\r\ntwenty years, dating from Lord North's Act of 1773, afforded a\r\nconvenient opportunity for the revision, when required, both of its\r\nrelations to the Crown and of its methods of government in India. The\r\nabrogation of its trading monopoly in 1813 was mainly a concession to\r\nopposition at home, quickened by the loss of the European markets which\r\nhad been closed against Great Britain by Napoleon's continental system,\r\nand for the renewal of its Charter the Company had to surrender its\r\ntrading monopoly. It was the first step towards the abrogation of all\r\nits trading privileges twenty years later, when the Company, finally\r\ndelivered from the temptations which beset a commercial corporation,\r\nbecame for the first time a purely governing body, free to devote its\r\nentire energies to the discharge of the immense responsibilities that\r\nhad devolved upon it. This was, however, only one, though not the least\r\nsignificant of the momentous changes that accompanied the renewal of the\r\nCharter in 1833.\r\n\r\nThe trend of events in Europe after the peace in 1815 had tended to\r\naccentuate the profound divergency of views between Great Britain and\r\nthe leading continental Powers in regard to fundamental principles of\r\ngovernment, which, dating back to the seventeenth century, had been\r\narrested at the close of the eighteenth by the exigencies of common\r\naction against the excesses of the French Revolution and the inordinate\r\nambition of Napoleon. Under the auspices of the Holy Alliance, the\r\ncontinent of Europe was drifting into blind reaction. The British\r\npeople, on the contrary, were entering upon a further stage of\r\ndemocratic evolution at home, and, under the influence of new liberal\r\nand humanitarian doctrines, their sympathies were going out abroad to\r\nevery down-trodden nationality that was struggling, whether in Greece or\r\nin South America, to throw off the yoke of oppressive despotisms. Their\r\ngrowing sense of responsibility towards alien races which they\r\nthemselves held in subjection was manifested most conspicuously in the\r\ngenerous movement which resulted in the abolition of slavery in our West\r\nIndian Colonies. It could not fail to be extended also to India. Under\r\nLord Hastings British dominion had again rapidly expanded between 1813\r\nand 1823, when he left it firmly established from the extreme south to\r\nthe Sutlej in the north. Then ten years of internal and external peace\r\nhad followed in which the educational labours, chiefly in Bengal, of a\r\ngeneration of great missionaries began not only to meet with unexpected\r\nreward in India itself, but also to stir the public mind at home to new\r\naspects of a mission which came to be regarded as providential, and to\r\nthe moral duties which it imposed upon us in return for the material\r\nadvantages to be derived from political dominion. Some of our great\r\nadministrators in India were themselves beginning to look forward to a\r\ntime, however far distant, when we should have made the people of India\r\ncapable of self-government--not yet, of course, on the lines now\r\ncontemplated, since even in Great Britain self-government was not\r\nestablished then on a broad popular basis. As early as 1824 Sir Thomas\r\nMunro, then Governor of Madras, raised in an official minute the \"one\r\ngreat question to which we should look in all our arrangements: What is\r\nto be their final result on the character of the people?\" The following\r\npassage in that remarkable document may be commended to our\r\nfaint-hearted doubters of to-day:\r\n\r\n     Liberal treatment has always been found the most effectual way of\r\n     elevating the character of any people, and we may be sure that it\r\n     will produce a similar effect on that of the people of India. The\r\n     change will no doubt be slow, but that is the very reason why no\r\n     time should be lost in commencing the work. We should not be\r\n     discouraged by difficulties, nor, because little progress may be\r\n     made in our own time, abandon the enterprise as hopeless, and\r\n     charge upon the obstinacy and bigotry of the nations the failure\r\n     occasioned by our own fickleness in not pursuing steadily the only\r\n     line of conduct on which any hope of success can be reasonably\r\n     founded. We should make the same allowances for the Hindus as for\r\n     other nations and consider how slow the progress of improvement has\r\n     been among the nations of Europe and through what a long course of\r\n     barbarous ages they had to pass before they attained their present\r\n     state. When we compare other countries with England, we usually\r\n     speak of England as she now is. We scarcely ever think of going\r\n     back beyond the Reformation, and we are apt to regard every foreign\r\n     nation as ignorant and uncivilised, whose state of government does\r\n     not in some degree approximate to our own, even should it be higher\r\n     than our own was at no distant date.\r\n\r\n     We should look upon India not as a temporary possession but as one\r\n     to be maintained permanently until the natives shall in some future\r\n     age have abandoned most of their superstitions and prejudices and\r\n     become sufficiently enlightened to frame a regular government for\r\n     themselves and to conduct and preserve it. Whenever such a time\r\n     shall arrive it will probably be best for both countries that the\r\n     British control over India should be gradually withdrawn. That the\r\n     desirable change contemplated may in some after age be effected in\r\n     India there is no cause to despair. Such a change was at one time\r\n     in Britain itself at least as hopeless as it is here. When we\r\n     reflect how much the character of nations has always been\r\n     influenced by that of governments, and that some, once the most\r\n     cultivated, have sunk into barbarism, while others, formerly the\r\n     rudest, have attained the highest point of civilisation, we shall\r\n     see no reason to doubt that if we pursue steadily the proper\r\n     measures, we shall in time so far improve the character of our\r\n     Indian subjects as to enable them to govern and protect themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid vision for a great British administrator to have\r\nentertained nearly one hundred years ago, though, with no self-governing\r\nDominions in those days to point a better way, the only possibility that\r\ncould occur to Munro's mind in the event of its fulfilment was an\r\namicable but complete severance of our connection with India; and it is\r\nwell to be reminded of the faith that was already in him and not a few\r\nother experienced and broad-minded Englishmen in India as well as at\r\nhome, now that many of us are inclined to contemplate only with\r\nscepticism and apprehension an approach to its fulfilment on the new\r\nlines which the evolution of the British Empire and of democratic\r\ngovernment throughout all its component parts, neither of which could\r\nthen be foreseen, have in the meantime suggested.\r\n\r\nIndians were at that time already employed in large numbers in the\r\nCompany's services, but only in subordinate posts, for which in most\r\ncases their educational backwardness alone fitted them, and only as an\r\nact of grace on the part of their British rulers. Parliament had\r\nrecognised the right of the Indian people to expect from us the benefits\r\nof good and honest government--perhaps as a duty which we owed to\r\nourselves as much as to them--but it had not yet risen to a recognition\r\nof their right to any active share in the government of their country.\r\n\r\nOne of the first questions to come before the new Parliament elected\r\nafter the great Reform Bill was that of the renewal of the Company's\r\ncharter in 1833. The Parliamentary Committee appointed to inquire and\r\nreport on the subject struck a new note when it laid distinct stress on\r\nthe Indian point of view. It admitted frankly that \"Indians were alive\r\nto the grievance of being excluded from a larger share in the executive\r\ngovernment,\" and proceeded to state that in its opinion ample evidence\r\nhad been given to show \"that such exclusion is not warranted on the\r\nscore of their own incapacity for business or the want of application or\r\ntrustworthiness.\" Accordingly, when the Charter was renewed, Parliament\r\nlaid it down that \"no native of the said Indian territories, nor any\r\nnatural British-born subject of His Majesty resident therein, shall by\r\nreason only of his religion, place of birth, descent, colour, or any of\r\nthem be disabled from holding any place, office, or employment under the\r\nCompany.\" This was the first substantial promise given to India that\r\nBritish rule was not to spell merely the unqualified dominion, however\r\nbeneficent, of alien rulers. It invited the co-operation of the subject\r\nrace, instead of merely postulating unconditional submission. It\r\nheralded at the same time the introduction of Western education, without\r\nwhich the promise would have been empty.\r\n\r\nThe problem of Indian education had occupied the minds of far-sighted\r\nEnglishmen from the days of Warren Hastings, who had been the first to\r\nprovide out of the Company's funds for the maintenance of indigenous\r\neducational institutions, and it had been definitely provided in the\r\nrenewal of the Charter in 1813 that the Company should set aside a\r\ncertain portion of its revenues to be spent annually upon education. But\r\nlong delays had been caused by an interminable and fierce controversy\r\nover the rival merits of the vernaculars and of English as the more\r\nsuitable vehicle for the diffusion of education. The champions of\r\nEnglish were much encouraged by the immediate success which attended the\r\nopening of an English school in Calcutta in 1830 by Dr. Alexander Duff,\r\na great missionary who was convinced that English education could alone\r\nwin over India to Christianity, and Macaulay's famous Minute of March 7,\r\n1835, disfigured as it is by the quite unmerited and ignorant scorn\r\nwhich he poured out on Oriental learning with his customary\r\nself-confidence, finally turned the scales in favour of the adoption of\r\nEnglish as essential to the spread of Western education. One of the\r\nimmediate objects in view--and incidentally as a measure of economy--was\r\nundoubtedly the training of Indians, and in much larger numbers, for the\r\nmore efficient performance of the work allotted to them in the\r\nadministrative and judicial services of the Company. But if Macaulay was\r\nquite wrong in imagining that Western education would assimilate Indians\r\nto Englishmen in everything but their complexions, he was by no means\r\nblind to the larger implications of the new departure he was advocating.\r\nLike other great Englishmen of his day, he believed that good government\r\nand, still less, mere dominion were not the only ends to which our\r\nefforts should be directed. \"It may be,\" he declared, \"that the public\r\nmind of India may expand under our system until it has outgrown that\r\nsystem; that by good government we may educate our subjects into a\r\ncapacity for better government; that having become instructed in\r\nEuropean knowledge they may, in some future age, demand European\r\ninstitutions. Whether such a day will ever come, I know not. But never\r\nwill I attempt to avert or retard it. Whenever it comes, it will be the\r\nproudest day in English history.\"\r\n\r\nPeace and law and order British rule had restored to India, and its\r\nforemost purpose henceforth, as set forth by Lord William Bentinck, a\r\ngreat Governor-General, imbued with the progressive spirit of the best\r\nEnglishmen in India, to which Parliament had given a fresh impetus, was\r\nto be the diffusion of Western education. \"The great object of the\r\nBritish Government,\" he declared, \"ought to be the promotion of English\r\nliterature and science, and all the funds appropriated for the purpose\r\nof education would be best employed in English education alone.\"\r\n\r\nIndia seemed for the next twenty years to respond enthusiastically to\r\nthe new call. Not only were the new Government schools as well as the\r\nolder missionary schools thronged with Indian students who displayed no\r\nless intelligence than industry in the acquisition of Western learning,\r\nbut the rapid assimilation of Western ideas amongst the upper classes,\r\nespecially in Bengal, was reflected in the social and religious reform\r\nmovements initiated by Western-educated Indians touched with the spirit\r\nof the West. Already in 1829 Lord William Bentinck had been supported by\r\na considerable body of Indian public opinion in prohibiting the\r\nbarbarous custom of _Sati_, _i.e._ the self-immolation of Hindu widows\r\non the funeral pyre of their husbands. Government, however, rightly felt\r\nthat, except in regard to practices of which it could not tolerate the\r\ncontinuance without surrendering the principles of humanity for which it\r\nstood, it was for the Indians themselves and not for their alien rulers\r\nto take the lead in bringing their religious and social customs and\r\nbeliefs into harmony with Western standards. Nor was there any lack of\r\nIndians to give their countrymen that lead--amongst them several\r\nhigh-caste Brahmans, Ram Mohun Roy first and foremost. They were\r\nresolved to cleanse Hinduism of the superstitious and idolatrous\r\nimpurities which, as they believed, were only morbid growths on the pure\r\nkernel of Hindu philosophy. The Brahmo Somaj, the most vital of all\r\nthese reform movements, professed even to reconcile Hinduism with\r\ntheism, though without importing into the new creed the belief in any\r\npersonal God. British administrators watched and fostered the moral and\r\nintellectual progress of India with increasing confidence in the results\r\nof Western education, and none with more conviction than Lord Dalhousie,\r\na high-minded and dour Scotsman, who was the last Governor-General to\r\nserve out his time under the East India Company. Other aspects of his\r\npolicy may have been less wise. The extension of British rule to the\r\nPunjab became inevitable after a Sikh rising compelled him to complete\r\nwhat his predecessor, Lord Hardinge, had begun, and break once and for\r\nall the aggressive power of the Sikh Confederacy; but the rigorous\r\napplication to the native States of the doctrine of lapse or escheat\r\nwhenever the ruler died without a recognised heir, and the forcible\r\nannexation of the kingdom of Oudh as a penalty incurred by the sins,\r\nhowever gross, of the reigning dynasty have been often condemned as\r\ngrave errors of judgment. They were not, in any case, errors that can be\r\nascribed to the lust of mere dominion. Dalhousie was convinced that\r\nIndian progress would always be hampered by the continuance of native\r\nadministration under such rulers as the kings of Oudh. If he was bent on\r\nextending the area of British dominion, it was in order to extend the\r\narea within which Britain was to be free to discharge her civilising\r\nmission without let or hindrance, and not least by the furtherance of\r\neducation. If he took a legitimate pride in the introduction into India\r\nunder his auspices of the two great discoveries of applied science which\r\nwere just beginning to revolutionise the Western world, viz. railways\r\nand telegraphs, together with unified postage, it was because he\r\nregarded them as powerful instruments of education. The impulse given by\r\nhim to public instruction even in the new provinces recently brought\r\nunder British control prepared the way for the great educational\r\nmeasures of 1854 which marked a tremendous stride forward on the road\r\nupon which Macaulay's Minute had started India just two decades before.\r\nIt was to Dalhousie that Sir Charles Wood addressed his memorable\r\ndespatch which contained, as the Governor-General frankly acknowledged,\r\n\"a scheme of education for all India far wider and more comprehensive\r\nthan the local or Supreme Governments could have ventured to suggest.\"\r\nIts main features were the establishment of a department of Public\r\nInstruction in every province to emphasise the importance attached by\r\nGovernment to the educational purpose of British rule; the creation of\r\nUniversities in each of the three Presidency cities, and of Government\r\ncolleges of a higher grade, and training colleges for teachers, and the\r\nbestowal of grants-in-aid on private educational institutions. The\r\nclaims of vernacular education were not forgotten, nor the vital\r\nimportance of promoting female education, by which \"a far greater\r\nproportional impulse is imported to the educational and moral tone of\r\nthe people than by the education of men.\" The despatch mapped out a\r\nreally national system of education worthy of the faith which the\r\nBritish generation of that day had in the establishment of an\r\nintellectual and spiritual communion between India and the West. The\r\ninitial steps immediately taken by Dalhousie to carry the provisions of\r\nthat despatch into execution are enumerated in the masterly Report drawn\r\nup by him on his way home in 1856, reviewing every aspect of his\r\nadministration during his eight years' tenure of office--an\r\nadministration which virtually closed, and not unworthily, perhaps the\r\nnoblest period of British rule in India, when men of the intellectual\r\nand moral elevation of Bentinck and Munro and Metcalfe and Elphinstone\r\nand Thomason, and Dalhousie himself, humbly but firmly believed that in\r\ntrying to found \"British greatness on Indian happiness\" they were\r\ncarrying out the mission which it had pleased Providence to entrust to\r\nthe British people. Dalhousie's parting hope and prayer, when he left\r\nIndia, broken in health but not in spirit, after eight years of\r\nintensely strenuous service, was that \"in all time to come these reports\r\nfrom the Presidencies and provinces under our rule may form in each\r\nsuccessive year a happy record of peace, prosperity, and progress.\" His\r\nimmediate successor, Lord Canning, was moved to utter some strangely\r\nprophetic words before he left England: \"I wish for a peaceful term of\r\noffice. But I cannot forget that in the sky of India, serene as it is, a\r\nsmall cloud may arise, no larger than a man's hand, but which, growing\r\nlarger and larger, may at last threaten to burst and overwhelm us with\r\nruin.\" Within less than a year the cloud arose and burst, and he had to\r\nface the outbreak of the Mutiny and see all the foundations of\r\nco-operation between Indians and British rudely shaken, which a broad\r\nand liberal policy of \"peace, prosperity, and progress\" seemed to have\r\nso well and truly laid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE MUTINY AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER\r\n\r\n\r\nMany different causes, much more clearly apprehended to-day than at the\r\ntime, contributed to provoke the great storm which burst over India in\r\n1857. On the surface it was a military and mainly Mahomedan\r\ninsurrection, but it was far more than that. It was a violent upheaval\r\nnot so much against the political supremacy of Britain as against the\r\nwhole new order of things which she was importing into India. The\r\ngreased cartridges would not have sufficed to provoke such an explosion,\r\nnor would even Mahomedans, let alone Hindus, have rallied round a\r\nphantom King of Delhi in mere revenge for the annexation of Oudh or the\r\nenforcement of the doctrine of lapse. The cry of \"Islam in danger\" was\r\nquick to stir the Mahomedans, but the brains that engineered and\r\ndirected the Mutiny were Hindu, and the Mutiny itself was the\r\ncounter-revolution arraying in battle against the intellectual and moral\r\nas well as against the material and military forces of Western\r\ncivilisation that was slowly but steadily revolutionising India, all the\r\ngrievances and all the fears, all the racial and religious antagonism\r\nand bitterness aroused by the disintegration under its impact of ancient\r\nsocial and religious systems. Western education was to yield other\r\nfruits later on, but before the Mutiny it was rapidly familiarising the\r\nmind of India with Western ideals which imperilled not only the worship\r\nof the old gods but also the worship of the Brahman as their mouthpiece\r\nand \"the guardian of the treasury of civil and religious duties.\"\r\nModern schools and colleges threatened to undermine his ascendancy just\r\nas Western competition had by more dubious methods undermined Indian\r\ndomestic industries. No man's caste was said to be safe against the\r\nhidden defilement of all the strange inventions imported from beyond the\r\nseas. Prophecy, vague but persuasive, hinted that British rule, which\r\ndated in the Indian mind from the battle of Plassey in 1757, was doomed\r\nnot to outlive its centenary. All the vested interests connected with\r\nthe old order of things in the religious as well as in the political\r\ndomain felt the ground swaying under their feet, and the peril with\r\nwhich they were confronted came not only from their alien rulers but\r\nfrom their own countrymen, often of their own caste and race, who had\r\nfallen into the snares and pitfalls of an alien civilisation. The spirit\r\nof fierce reaction that lay behind the Mutiny stands nowhere more\r\nfrankly revealed than in the _History of the War of Independence of\r\n1857_, written by Vinayak Savarkar, one of the most brilliant apostles\r\nof a later school of revolt, who, as a pious Hindu, concludes his\r\nversion of the Cawnpore massacre with the prayer that \"Mother Ganges,\r\nwho drank that day of the blood of Europeans, may drink her fill of it\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe revolt failed except in one respect. It failed as a military\r\nmovement. It had appealed to the sword and it perished by the sword. But\r\nit is well to remember that the struggle, which was severe, would have\r\nbeen, to say the least, far more severe and protracted had not a large\r\npart of the Indian army remained staunch to the _Raj_, and had not\r\nIndian troops stood, as they had stood throughout all our previous\r\nfighting in India, shoulder to shoulder with British troops on the ridge\r\nat Delhi and in the relief of Lucknow. It failed equally as a political\r\nmovement, for it never spread beyond a relatively narrow area in Upper\r\nand Central India. The vast majority of the Indian people and princes\r\nnever even wavered. British rule passed through a trial by fire and it\r\nemerged from the ordeal unscathed and fortified. For it was purged of\r\nall the ambiguities of a dual position and of divided responsibilities.\r\nThe last of the Moghuls forfeited the shadowy remnants of an obsolete\r\nsovereignty. Just a hundred years earlier Clive had advised after\r\nPlassey that the Crown should assume direct sovereignty over the whole\r\nof the British possessions in India, as the responsibility was growing\r\ntoo heavy for the mere trading corporation that the East India Company\r\nthen still was. The Company had long ceased to be a mere trading\r\ncorporation. Transformed into a great agency of government and\r\nadministration, it had risen not unworthily to its immense\r\nresponsibilities. But the time had come for the final step. The Company\r\ndisappeared and the Crown assumed full and sole responsibility for the\r\ngovernment and administration of India. The change was in effect more\r\nformal than real. The Governor-General came to be known as the Viceroy,\r\nand the Secretary of State in Council took the place of the old\r\nPresident of the Board of Control. But the system remained as before one\r\nof paternal despotism in India, to be tempered still by the control of\r\nParliament at home.\r\n\r\nOnly in one respect had the reactionary forces at the back of the Mutiny\r\nscored some success. The Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria on her\r\nassumption of \"the government of the territories in India heretofore\r\nadministered in trust for us by the Honourable East India Company,\" was\r\na solemn and earnest renewal of all the pledges already given to the\r\nprinces and people of India. It emphasised the determination of the\r\nCrown to abstain from all interference with their religious belief or\r\nworship. It reiterated the assurance that \"as far as may be,\" her\r\nsubjects \"of whatever race or creed\" would be freely and impartially\r\nadmitted to offices in the service of the Crown, \"the duties of which\r\nthey may be qualified by their education, ability, and integrity duly to\r\ndischarge,\" and that, \"generally in framing and administering the law,\r\ndue regard be paid to the ancient rights, usages, and customs of India.\"\r\nIt promised the wide exercise of her royal clemency to all offenders\r\nsave those actually guilty of murder during the recent outbreak. It\r\nclosed with a fine expression of her confidence and affection towards\r\nher Indian subjects. \"In their prosperity will be our strength, in their\r\ncontentment our security, and in their gratitude our best reward.\" But\r\nno Proclamation, however generous and sincere, could undo the moral harm\r\ndone by the Mutiny. The horrors which accompanied the rising and the\r\nsternness of the repression left terrible memories behind them on both\r\nsides, and this legacy of racial hatred acted as a blight on the growth\r\nof the spirit of mutual understanding and co-operation between Indians\r\nand Englishmen in India which two generations of broad-minded Englishmen\r\nand progressive Indians had sedulously and successfully cultivated.\r\n\r\nIf we look back upon the half-century after the Mutiny and before the\r\nPartition of Bengal, which may be regarded as closing that long period\r\nof paternal but autocratic government, it was one of internal peace and\r\nof material progress which the large annual output of eloquent\r\nstatistics may be left to demonstrate. In 1857 there were not 200 miles\r\nof railways in India, in 1905 there was a network of railways amounting\r\nto over 28,000 miles, and the telegraph system expanded during the same\r\nperiod from 4500 to 60,000 miles. The development of a great system of\r\nirrigation canals added large new tracts of hitherto barren wastes to\r\nthe cultivable area of the country, and an elaborate machinery of\r\nprecautionary measures and relief works was created to mitigate the\r\nhardships of periodical famines unavoidable in regions where a\r\npredominantly agricultural population is largely dependent for existence\r\non the varying abundance or shortage of the seasonal rainfalls. The\r\nincidence and methods of collection of the land-tax, the backbone of\r\nIndian revenue, were carefully corrected and perfected, and the burden\r\nof taxation readjusted and on the whole lightened. Those were the days\r\nof _laisser-faire_, _laisser-aller_ at home, and it was not deemed to\r\nbe part of the duties of government to give any special protection to\r\nIndian commerce, whilst the operation of free trade principles in India\r\nchecked the industrial development of the country. Nevertheless the\r\ninternal and external trade of India expanded continually, and the\r\ncotton mills in Western India, and the jute mills in Calcutta, as well\r\nas the opening up of coal mines in Bengal and of gold mines in Southern\r\nIndia showed how great were the natural resources of the peninsula still\r\nawaiting development; and under Lord Curzon's administration, which\r\nreached during the first years of the present century the high-water\r\nmark of efficiency, a department was created to deal specially with\r\ncommerce and industry. In spite of several famines of unusual intensity\r\nand of the appearance in India in 1896 of a new scourge in the shape of\r\nthe bubonic plague, which has carried off since then over eight million\r\npeople, the population increased by leaps and bounds, and the census of\r\n1901 showed it to have reached in our Indian Empire the huge figure of\r\nnearly 300,000,000--which it has since then exceeded by another\r\n20,000,000--or about a fifth of the estimated population of the whole\r\nglobe. It had risen since the first census officially recorded in 1871\r\nby nearly 30 per cent--no mean evidence that fifty years of peaceful and\r\nefficient administration had produced an increased sense of welfare and\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the population, mostly a simple and ignorant peasantry\r\nwhose horizon does not extend beyond their own village and the fields\r\nthat surround it, accepted with more or less conscious gratitude the\r\nmaterial benefits conferred upon them by alien rulers with whom they\r\nwere seldom brought into actual contact save through the occasional\r\npresence of a District officer on tour, almost invariably humane and\r\nkindly and anxious to do even-handed justice to all. Another class of\r\nIndians, chiefly dwellers in large cities, infinitesimally small\r\nnumerically but constantly increasing in numbers and still more rapidly\r\nin activity and influence, saw, however, in an autocratic form of\r\ngovernment, of which it even questioned the efficiency, an\r\ninsurmountable barrier to the aspirations which Western education had\r\ntaught it to entertain. The list of graduates from Indian Universities\r\nlengthened every year, the number of schools and colleges in which young\r\nIndians acquired at least the rudiments of Western knowledge grew and\r\nmultiplied in every province. Western-educated Indians flocked to the\r\nbar; they showed themselves qualified for most of the liberal\r\nprofessions; they filled every post that was open to them in the public\r\nservices. But where, they asked with growing impatience, was the\r\nfulfilment of the hopes which they had founded on the Queen's\r\nProclamation of 1858? There had been perhaps no departure from the\r\nletter of the Proclamation, but had its spirit been translated into\r\neffective practice? Was it never to be interpreted in the same generous\r\nsense in which a still earlier generation of British administrators had\r\ninterpreted their mission as a means to train the Indians to protect and\r\ngovern themselves?\r\n\r\nThe Indian army, reorganised after the Mutiny, displayed all its old\r\nqualities of loyalty and gallantry in the course of the numerous foreign\r\nexpeditions in which it was employed in co-operation with the British\r\narmy, in Egypt and the Sudan, in Afghanistan, China, and Tibet, in\r\naddition to the chronic frontier fighting on the turbulent North-West\r\nborder. The menace of Russia's persistent expansion towards India\r\nthrough Central Asia and the ascendancy for which she was at the same\r\ntime striving in the Near East and the Far East, and later on the far\r\nmore real menace of German aspirations to world-dominion, lent added\r\nimportance to the maintenance of an efficient Indian army as an\r\nessential factor in the defensive forces of the Empire. But there was no\r\ndeparture from the old system under which not only were army\r\nadministration and all the higher commands reserved for British\r\nofficers, but the whole army was kept as a fighting machine entirely\r\ndependent upon British leadership. The native officers of an Indian\r\nregiment, mostly promoted from the ranks, could in no circumstances rise\r\nto a position in which they might give orders to a British officer,\r\nwhilst, however senior in years and service, they were under the orders\r\nof the youngest British subaltern gazetted to the regiment. No other\r\nsystem was indeed possible so long as no attempt was made to give to\r\nIndians any higher military training, or to hold out to them any\r\nprospects of promotion beyond those within their reach by enlistment in\r\nthe ranks. These Indian officers, drawn from races that had acquired a\r\nmartial reputation and often from families with whom military service\r\nwas an hereditary tradition, were as a rule not only very fine fighters\r\nbut gallant native gentlemen, between whom and their British officers\r\nthere existed very cordial relations, human and professional, based upon\r\nan instinctive recognition of differences of education and similarities\r\nof tastes on both sides. But such a system, however well it worked in\r\npractice for the production of a reliable fighting machine, was not\r\ncalculated to train the Indians to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nThat nothing was done to open up a military career to the\r\nWestern-educated classes was not at first more than a sentimental\r\ngrievance. But when the years passed and they still waited for that\r\nlarger share in the government and even in the administration of their\r\ncountry to which the British Parliament had recognised their claim as\r\nfar back as the Act of 1833, their faith even in the professed purpose\r\nof British rule began to waver. At first the leaders of the Indian\r\n_intelligentsia_, some of whom had learned the value of British\r\ninstitutions and of the freedom of British public life, not merely\r\nthrough English literature but through years of actual residence in\r\nEngland, preferred to hold the Anglo-Indian bureaucracy alone or chiefly\r\nresponsible for the long delay in the fulfilment of hopes which they in\r\nfact regarded as rights. Their confidence in British statesmanship and\r\nin the British Parliament remained unshaken for nearly thirty years\r\nafter the Mutiny, though they were perhaps not unnaturally inclined to\r\nput their trust chiefly in the Liberal party which had been most closely\r\nassociated with the promotion of a progressive policy towards India in\r\nthe past. Lord Lytton's Viceroyalty confirmed them in the belief that\r\nfrom the Conservative party they had little to hope for, and his drastic\r\nPress Act of 1879, though not unprovoked by the virulent abuse of\r\nGovernment in some of the vernacular papers and the reckless\r\ndissemination of alarmist rumours during the worst period of the Afghan\r\ntroubles, was held to foreshadow a return all along the line to purely\r\ndespotic methods of government. But his departure from India after Lord\r\nBeaconsfield's defeat at the general election of 1880 and the return of\r\nthe Liberal party to power quickened new hopes which Lord Ripon, when he\r\nbecame Viceroy in succession to Lord Lytton, showed every disposition to\r\njustify.\r\n\r\nAll the greater was the disillusionment when a measure, introduced for\r\nthe purpose of abolishing \"judicial disqualifications based on race\r\ndistinctions,\" not only provoked fierce opposition amongst the whole\r\nEuropean community and even amongst the rank and file of the civil\r\nservice, but was ultimately whittled down in deference to that\r\nopposition until the very principle at issue was virtually surrendered.\r\nIndians resented this fresh assertion of racial superiority, and saw in\r\nthe violence of the agitation, sometimes not far removed from threats of\r\nactual lawlessness, and in the personal abuse poured out by his own\r\ncountrymen on the Queen's representative, the survival amongst a large\r\nsection of Europeans of the same hatred that had invented for a Viceroy\r\nwho was determined to temper justice with mercy after the Mutiny the\r\nscornful nickname of \"Clemency Canning.\"\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Ilbert Bill taught the Indians above all one practical\r\nlesson--the potency of agitation. If by agitation a Viceroy enjoying the\r\nfull confidence of the British Government, with a powerful\r\nParliamentary majority behind it, could be compelled by the British\r\ncommunity in India, largely consisting of public servants, to surrender\r\na great principle of policy, then the only hope for Indians was to learn\r\nto agitate in their own interests, and to create a political\r\norganisation of their own in order both to educate public opinion in\r\nIndia and influence public opinion in England. The men who started the\r\nIndian National Congress were inspired by no revolutionary ambitions.\r\nThough they did not talk, as Mr. Gandhi does to-day, about producing a\r\n\"change of hearts\" in their British rulers, that was their purpose and\r\nunlike Mr. Gandhi, they were firm believers not in any racial\r\nsuperiority, but in the superiority of Western civilisation and of\r\nBritish political institutions which they deemed not incapable of\r\ntransplantation on to Indian soil. So on December 28, 1885, a small band\r\nof Indian gentlemen, who represented the _élite_ of the Western-educated\r\nclasses, met in Bombay to hold the first session of the Indian National\r\nCongress which, with all its many shortcomings, even in its earlier and\r\nbetter days, was destined to play a far more important part than was for\r\na long time realised by Englishmen in India or at home. Many of\r\nthem--such as Mr. Bonnerji, a distinguished Bengalee, Pherozeshah Mehta,\r\na rising member of the great Parsee community in Bombay, Dadabhai\r\nNaoroji, who was later on to be the first Indian to put forward plainly\r\nIndia's claim to self-government within the British Empire--had spent\r\nseveral years in England. Others, like Ranadé and Telang, had been for a\r\nlong time past vigorous advocates of Indian social reforms. With them\r\nwere a few Englishmen--chief among them a retired civilian Mr. Hume--who\r\nwere in complete sympathy with their aspirations. Only the Mahomedans\r\nwere unrepresented, though not uninvited, partly because few of them had\r\nbeen caught up in the current of Western thought and education, and\r\npartly because the community as a whole, reflecting the ancient and\r\ndeep-seated antagonism between Islam and Hinduism, distrusted\r\nprofoundly every movement in which Hindus were the leading spirits. Lord\r\nReay, who was then Governor of Bombay, was invited to preside and\r\ndeclined only after asking for instructions from the Viceroy, Lord\r\nDufferin, who, though not unfriendly, held that it was undesirable for\r\nthe head of a Provincial Government to associate himself with what\r\nshould essentially be a popular movement. Mr. Bonnerji, who was selected\r\nto take the chair, emphatically proclaimed the loyalty of the Congress\r\nto the British Crown. Amongst the most characteristic resolutions moved\r\nand carried was one demanding the appointment of a Royal Commission, on\r\nwhich the people of India should be represented, to inquire into the\r\nworking of the Indian administration, and another pleading for a large\r\nexpansion of the Indian Legislative Councils and the creation of a\r\nStanding Committee of the House of Commons to which the majority in\r\nthose Councils should have the right to appeal if overruled by the\r\nExecutive.\r\n\r\nThe Congress claimed to represent the educated opinion of India, and,\r\nthough Government withheld from it all official recognition, it\r\nflattered itself not without reason that its preaching had not fallen on\r\nto altogether barren soil when, still under Lord Dufferin's Viceroyalty,\r\nthe Indian Local Government Act of 1888 marked a large advance upon the\r\nreforms in local and municipal institutions which, with the repeal of\r\nthe Lytton Press Act, had been amongst the few tangible results of Lord\r\nRipon's \"Pro-Indian\" Viceroyalty; for it fulfilled many of the demands\r\nwhich Indian Liberals, and notably Pherozeshah Mehta, had urged for\r\nyears past for a more effective share in municipal administration. Still\r\ngreater was the satisfaction when, under Lord Lansdowne's Viceroyalty,\r\nthe British Parliament passed in 1892 an Indian Councils Act, for which\r\nLord Dufferin himself had paved the way by admitting that Government\r\ncould and should rely more largely upon the experience and advice of\r\nresponsible Indians. The functions and the constitution of both the\r\nViceroy's and the Provincial Legislative Councils, though their powers\r\nremained purely consultative, were substantially enlarged by the\r\naddition of a considerable number of unofficial members representing, at\r\nleast in theory, all classes and interests, who were given the right to\r\nput questions to the Executive on matters of administration and, in the\r\ncase of the Viceroy's Council, to discuss the financial policy of\r\nGovernment if and when the budget to be laid before it involved fresh\r\ntaxation. The Act of 1892 did not, however, admit \"the living forces of\r\nthe elective principle\" on which the Congress leaders had laid their\r\nchief stress, and they went on pressing \"not for Consultative Councils,\r\nbut for representative institutions.\" Their hopes never perhaps rose so\r\nhigh as when one of their own veterans, Dadabhai Naoroji--though Lord\r\nSalisbury could not resist a jibe at the expense of the \"black\r\nman\"--entered the House of Commons as Liberal member for Central\r\nFinsbury. It must be conceded that, had Government at that time taken\r\nthe Congress by the hand instead of treating it with disdain and\r\nsuspicion, it might have played loyally and usefully a part analogous to\r\nthat of \"Her Majesty's Opposition\" at home--a part which Lord Dufferin\r\nhad been shrewd enough in the beginning not to dismiss as altogether\r\nimpossible or undesirable. Its claim to represent Indian opinion, as,\r\nwithin certain limits, it unquestionably did, was ignored, and it was\r\nleft to drift without any attempt at official guidance into waters none\r\nthe less dangerous because they seemed shallow. It quickly attracted a\r\nlarge following among the urban middle classes all over India. But as\r\nthe number of those who attended its annual sessions, held in turn in\r\nevery province, grew larger, it became less amenable to the guiding and\r\nrestraining influence of those who had created it, and especially of\r\nthose who had hoped to lead it in the path of social and religious\r\nreform as well as of political advancement.\r\n\r\nThe social and religious reform movement which had been of great promise\r\nbefore the Mutiny and for some years afterwards, when Keshab Chundra Sen\r\ngave the Brahmo Somaj a fine uplift, slackened. Like the Brahmo Somaj in\r\nBengal, the Prirthana Somaj in Bombay no longer made so many or such\r\nfervent recruits. New societies sprang up in defence of the old faiths,\r\nsome even glorifying all their primitive customs and superstitions, and\r\nmost of them, whilst professing to recognise the need for cleansing them\r\nof their grosser accretions, displaying a marked reaction against the\r\nWest in their avowed determination to seek reform only in a return to\r\nthe purer doctrines of early Hinduism. The most important of all these\r\nmovements was the Arya Somaj in the Punjab, whose watchwords were \"Back\r\nto the Vedas\" and \"Arya for the Aryans.\" The latter has sometimes barely\r\ndisguised a more than merely platonic desire to see the British\r\ndisappear out of the Aryan land of India. But the Vedas at any rate\r\nyielded to the searchers sufficient fruitful authority for promoting\r\nfemale education on sound moral lines and for discouraging idolatry and\r\nrelaxing the cruel bondage of caste. That it has been and still is in\r\nmany respects a powerful influence for good is now generally admitted by\r\nthose even whom its political tendencies have alarmed. New sects arose\r\nwithin Hinduism.[1] An ardent apostle of the Hindu revival in Bengal,\r\nSwami Vivekananda, was the most impressive and picturesque figure at the\r\nChicago Parliament of Religions in 1893 and made converts in America and\r\nin Europe, amongst them in England the gifted poetess best known under\r\nher Hindu name as Sister Nivedita. How strong was the hold regained by\r\nthe purely reactionary forces in Hinduism was suddenly shown in the\r\nfurious campaign against Lord Lansdowne's Age of Consent Bill in 1891\r\nwhich brought Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a Chitawan Brahman of Poona, for\r\nthe first time into public life as the champion of extreme Hindu\r\northodoxy. That measure was intended to mitigate the evils of infant\r\nmarriage by raising the age for the woman's consent to its consummation\r\nfrom ten to twelve, and the death quite recently of a young Hindu girl\r\nof eleven in Calcutta due to the violence inflicted upon her by a\r\nhusband nearly twenty years older than she was, had enlisted very\r\nwidespread support for Government amongst enlightened Hindus and\r\nespecially amongst the Western-educated. Tilak did not defeat the Bill,\r\nbut his unscrupulous attacks, not only upon the British rulers of India\r\nbut upon his own more liberal co-religionists, including men of such\r\nability and character as Telang and Ranadé, dealt a sinister blow at the\r\nsocial reform movement, which practically died out of the Congress when\r\nhe and his friends began to establish their ascendancy over it.\r\n\r\nIt was so much easier for Indians to unite on a common political\r\nplatform against British methods of government than on a platform of\r\nsocial and religious reforms which offended many different prejudices\r\nand threatened many vested interests. The Congress developed into a\r\npurely political body, and like all self-constituted bodies with no\r\ndefinite responsibilities it showed greater capacity for acrid\r\ncriticism, often quite uninformed, than for any constructive policy. As\r\nthe years passed on without any tangible results from its expanding flow\r\nof oratory and long \"omnibus\" resolutions, proposed and carried more or\r\nless automatically at every annual session, it turned away from the old\r\nexponents of constitutional agitation to the fiery champions of very\r\ndifferent methods, and almost insensibly favoured the dangerous growth\r\nboth inside it and outside it of the new forces, and of the old forces\r\nin new shapes, which were to explode into the open with such unforeseen\r\nviolence after the Partition of Bengal in 1905.\r\n\r\nIf, however, when that explosion came the Western-educated classes were\r\nagainst us rather than with us, the explanation cannot be sought only in\r\ntheir continued exclusion from all real participation in the counsels\r\nof Government, or in the refusal of the political rights for which they\r\nhad vainly agitated, or even in a general reaction against the earlier\r\nacceptance of the essential superiority of the West. A much more acute\r\nand substantial grievance, which affected also their material interests,\r\nwas the badge of inferiority imposed upon them in the public services.\r\nNot till 1886 had Government appointed a Commission to report upon a\r\nreorganisation of the public services, and its recommendations\r\nprofoundly disappointed Indian expectations. For only a narrow door was\r\nopened for the admission of Indians into the higher Civil Service, and\r\nall public services were divided into two nearly water-tight\r\ncompartments, the one labelled Imperial, recruited in England and\r\nreserved in practice, as to most of the superior posts, for Englishmen,\r\nand the other recruited in India mainly from Indians, but labelled\r\nProvincial and clearly intended to be inferior. Such a system bore the\r\nstamp, barely disguised, of racial discrimination, at variance with the\r\nspirit, if not the letter, of the Queen's Proclamation--and this at a\r\ntime when Indian universities and colleges were bearing abundant fruit,\r\nand some of it at least of a good quality.\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of Western education had, it is true, produced other and\r\nless healthy results, but the inquiry into Indian education instituted\r\nby Government in 1882 had been unfortunately blind to them. Diffusion\r\nhad been attained largely by a dangerous process of dilution, as side by\r\nside with the European schools and colleges, either under Government\r\ncontrol or State-aided, which had grown and multiplied, many had been\r\nalso started and supported by Indian private enterprise, often\r\nill-equipped for their task. The training of Indian teachers could\r\nhardly keep pace with the demand, either as to quantity or quality, and\r\nwith overcrowded classes even the best institutions suffered from the\r\nloss of individual contact between the European teacher and the Indian\r\nscholar. Western education had been started in India at the top, whence\r\nit was expected to filter down by some strange and unexplained process\r\nof gravitation. Attention was concentrated on higher and secondary\r\neducation, to which primary education was at first entirely sacrificed.\r\nWhereas Lord William Bentinck had declared the great object of\r\nGovernment to be the promotion of both Western science and literature,\r\nscarcely any effort was made--perhaps because most Anglo-Indians had a\r\nleaning towards the humanities--to correct by the encouragement of\r\nscientific studies the natural bent of the Indian mind towards a purely\r\nliterary education. Yet the Indian mind being specially endowed with the\r\ngift of imagination and prone to speculative thought stands in\r\nparticular need of the corrective discipline afforded by the study of\r\nexact science. Again, the reluctance of Government to appear even to\r\ninterfere with Indian moral and religious conceptions, towards which it\r\nwas pledged to observe absolute neutrality, tended to restrict the\r\ndomain of education to the purely intellectual side. Yet, religion\r\nhaving always been in India the basic element of life, and morality\r\napart from religion an almost impossible conception, that very aspect of\r\neducation to which Englishmen profess to attach the highest value, and\r\nof which Mr. Gokhale in a memorable speech admitted Indians to stand in\r\nspecial need, viz. the training of character, was gravely neglected.\r\n\r\nWhilst from lack of any settled policy Indian education was drifting on\r\nto rocks and quicksands, and the personal influence of Englishmen on the\r\nyounger generation diminished in an officialised educational service,\r\ngradual changes in the material conditions of European life in India\r\ntended to keep British and Indians more rather than less apart. Greater\r\nfacilities of travel between England and India, and the growth of \"hill\r\nstations\" in which Europeans congregated during the hot season, made it\r\neasier for Englishwomen to live in India, though, when the time came for\r\nchildren to be sent home for their education, the choice continued to\r\nlie between separation of husband and wife, or of mother and children.\r\nBut if the presence of a larger feminine element was calculated to\r\nexercise a refining and restraining influence on Anglo-Indian society,\r\nit did not promote the growth of intimate social relations between\r\nEuropeans and Indians, as Indian habits and domestic institutions, and\r\nespecially the seclusion of women, created an even greater barrier,\r\nwhich only slowly and rarely yielded to the influences of Western\r\neducation, between European and Indian ladies than between the men of\r\nthe two races. Englishwomen even more than Englishmen continued to be\r\nhaunted by the memories of the Mutiny, which remained painfully present\r\nto a generation who, whether Indians or British, had lived through that\r\ntempest, and if to Indians the Mutiny recalled such scenes as \"The\r\nBlowing of Indians from British Guns\" which the great Russian painter\r\nVerestchagin depicted with the same realism as the splendid pageant of\r\nthe entry of the Prince of Wales into Delhi in 1876, it was the horrors\r\nof Cawnpore that chiefly dwelt in the minds of Europeans. Many\r\nEnglishmen and Englishwomen owed their lives during the Mutiny to the\r\ndevotion and courage of Indians who helped them to escape, and sheltered\r\nthem sometimes for months at no slight risk to themselves. But the\r\nspirit of treachery and cruelty revealed in the Mutiny and personified\r\nin a Nana Sahib, who had disappeared into space but, according to\r\nfrequently recurrent rumour, was still alive somewhere, chilled the\r\nfeelings of trustfulness and goodwill of an earlier generation. Again,\r\nwhilst there was a large increase in the number of young Indians who\r\nwent to England to complete their studies--especially technical studies\r\nfor which only tardy and inadequate facilities were provided in their\r\nown country--and many of them, left to their own devices in our large\r\ncities, brought back to India a closer familiarity with the unedifying\r\nrather than the edifying aspects of Western civilisation, the\r\ndevelopment of European industries and the railway and telegraph\r\nservices, which at first at least required the employment of Europeans\r\nin subordinate capacities, imported into India a new type of European,\r\nwith many good qualities, but rather more prone than those of better\r\nbreeding and education to glory in his racial superiority and to bring\r\nit home somewhat roughly to the Indians with whom he associated. The\r\nignorance of European and American globe-trotters who were finding their\r\nway to India also often offended Indian susceptibilities. Add to many\r\ncauses of friction, almost inevitable sometimes between people whose\r\nhabits and ideas are widely different, the effect of a trying climate\r\nupon the European temper--never, for instance, even at home at its best\r\nwhen travelling--and one need hardly be surprised that unpleasant\r\nincidents occurred in which, sometimes under provocation and sometimes\r\nunder none, Englishmen who ought to have known better were guilty of\r\ngross affronts upon Indians. Such incidents were never frequent, but,\r\neven if there had been no tendency on the part of Indians to magnify and\r\non the part of Englishmen to minimise their gravity, they were frequent\r\nenough to cause widespread heartburning, and in not a few cases\r\npolitical hatred has had its origin in the rancour created by personal\r\ninsults to which even educated Indians of good position have\r\noccasionally been subjected by Englishmen who fancied themselves, but\r\nwere not, their betters. That Indians also could be, and were sometimes,\r\noffensive they were generally apt to forget, as they forgot in their\r\ndenunciations of Lord Curzon at the time of the Partition of Bengal that\r\nhe had not shrunk from incurring great unpopularity in some Anglo-Indian\r\ncircles by insisting upon adequate punishment of all Europeans guilty of\r\nviolence towards Indians. Apart from such collisions nothing rankled\r\nmore with Indians of the better classes than their rigid exclusion from\r\nthe European clubs in India. Even the few who were members of, or had\r\nbeen admitted at home as visitors to, the best London clubs were\r\ndebarred, when they landed in Bombay, even from calling on their English\r\nfriends at the Yacht Club. Europeans could see nothing in this but the\r\nright of every club to restrict its membership and frame its regulations\r\nas it chooses. Indians could see nothing in it but humiliating racial\r\ndiscrimination. The question has now been more or less solved by the\r\ncreation in most of the large cities in India of new clubs to which\r\nIndians and Europeans are equally eligible, and in which those who\r\nchoose can meet on terms of complete equality and good fellowship. But\r\nit constituted one of the grievances which contributed to the\r\nestrangement of the Western educated classes during the latter part of\r\nthe last century.\r\n\r\nThough social friction assisted that estrangement its chief cause lay\r\nmuch deeper. After the Mutiny government under the direct authority of\r\nthe Crown lost the flexibility which the vigilant control of the British\r\nParliament had imparted to the old system of government under the East\r\nIndia Company with every periodical renewal of its charter. The system\r\nremained what it had inevitably been from the beginning of British rule,\r\na system devised by foreigners and worked by foreigners--at its best a\r\ntrusteeship committed to them for the benefit of the people of India,\r\nbut to be discharged on the sole judgment and discretion of the British\r\ntrustees. The Mutiny shook the finer faith which had contemplated the\r\nfinality some day or other of the trusteeship and introduced Western\r\neducation into India as the agency by which Indians were to be prepared\r\nto resume when that day came the task of governing and protecting\r\nthemselves. There was a tacit assumption now, if never officially\r\nformulated, that the trusteeship was to last for ever, and with that\r\nassumption grew the belief that those who were actually employed in\r\ndischarging it were alone competent to judge the methods by which it was\r\ndischarged, whilst the increasing complexity of their task made it more\r\nand more difficult for them to form a right judgment on the larger\r\nissues, or to watch or appraise the results of the great educational\r\nexperiment which was raising up a steadily increasing proportion of\r\nIndians who claimed both a share in the administration and a voice in\r\nthe framing of policy. Executive and administrative functions were\r\nvested practically in the same hands, _i.e._ in the hands of a great and\r\nubiquitous bureaucracy more and more jealous of its power and of its\r\ninfallibility in proportion as the latter began to be questioned and the\r\nformer to be attacked by the class of Indians who had learned to speak\r\nthe same language and to profess the same ideals.\r\n\r\nThe constant additions made to the huge machinery of administration in\r\norder to meet the growing needs of the country on the approved lines of\r\na modern state resulted in increased centralisation. New departments\r\nwere created and old ones expanded, but even when the highest posts in\r\nthem were not specifically or in practice reserved for the Indian Civil\r\nService, it retained the supreme control over them as the _corps\r\nd'élite_ from which most of the members of the Viceroy's Executive\r\nCouncil, _i.e._ the Government of India, were recruited. The District\r\nOfficer remained the pivot and pillar of British administration\r\nthroughout rural India, and he kept as closely as he could in touch with\r\nthe millions of humble folk committed to his care, though the\r\nmultiplication of codes and regulations and official reports and\r\nstatistics involving heavy desk work kept him increasingly tied to his\r\noffice. But the secretariats, which from the headquarters of provincial\r\ngovernments as well as from the seat of supreme government directed and\r\ncontrolled the whole machine, became more and more self-centred, more\r\nand more imbued with a sense of their own omniscience. Even the men with\r\ndistrict experience, and those who had groaned in provincial\r\nsecretariats under the heavy hand of the Government of India, were quick\r\nto adopt more orthodox views as soon as they were privileged to breathe\r\nthe more rarefied atmosphere of the Olympian secretariats, that prided\r\nthemselves on being the repositories of all the _arcana_ of \"good\r\ngovernment.\" Of what constituted good government efficiency came to be\r\nregarded as the one test that mattered, and it was a test which only\r\nEnglishmen were competent to apply and which Indians were required to\r\naccept as final whatever their wishes or their experience might be.\r\n\r\nHerein perhaps more than anywhere else lay the secret of the antagonism\r\nbetween the British bureaucracy and the Western-educated Indians which\r\ngradually grew up between the repression of the Mutiny and the Partition\r\nof Bengal, a measure enforced on the sole plea of greater administrative\r\nefficiency by a Viceroy under whom a system of government by efficiency\r\nreached its apogee--himself the incarnation of efficiency and\r\nunquestionably the greatest and most indefatigable administrator that\r\nBritain sent out to India during that period. It would be unfair to\r\nsuppose that that antagonism was due on either side to mere narrow\r\nprejudice or sordid jealousy. Indians who resented their exclusion from\r\nthe share in the administration of their country for which they believed\r\ntheir education to have qualified them, and which they claimed as the\r\nfulfilment of repeated promises and of the declared purpose of British\r\nrule, may not have been free from a human appetite for loaves and\r\nfishes. British officials who were loath to recognise those claims, or\r\nto concede to Indians any substantial proportion of their privileged\r\nposts and emoluments, may have been not always unselfishly indifferent\r\nto the material interests and prospects of the services to which they\r\nbelonged, if not to their own personal interests and prospects. But\r\napart from any such considerations, the attitude of both parties was\r\ngoverned by the firm belief, not in itself discreditable to either, that\r\nit possessed the better knowledge of the needs and interests and wishes\r\nof the vast populations of India, still too ignorant and inarticulate to\r\ngive expression of their own to them. The lamentable effects of the\r\nestrangement between British administrators and the very class of\r\nIndians whose co-operation it had been one of the main objects of\r\nBritish policy ever since the Act of 1833 to promote, never stood\r\nclearly revealed till the sudden wave of unrest that followed the\r\nPartition of Bengal, and it is upon future co-operation between them\r\nthat the success of the great constitutional experiment now being made\r\nmust ultimately depend. It is therefore well to try to understand the\r\nconflicting sentiments and opinions which drove asunder the moderate but\r\nprogressive Western-educated Indian and the earnest but conservative\r\nBritish administrator, and ended by bringing them almost into open\r\nconflict. The Western-educated Indian claimed recognition at our hands\r\nfirst and foremost because he was the product of the educational system\r\nwe ourselves imposed upon India. His limitations, intellectual and\r\nmoral, were largely due to the defects of that system, just as his\r\npolitical immaturity was largely due to our failure to provide him with\r\nopportunities of acquiring experience in administrative work and public\r\nlife. Where careers had been opened up to him in the liberal professions\r\nhe had often achieved great distinction--at the Bar, on the Bench, in\r\nliterature--and he had proved himself quite competent to fill all the\r\nposts accessible to him in the public services. Without his assistance\r\nin the many subordinate branches the everyday work of administration\r\ncould not have been carried on for a day. He contended that he must\r\nintuitively be a better judge than aliens, who were, after all, birds of\r\npassage, of the needs and interests and wishes of his own\r\nfellow-countrymen, and a better interpreter to them of so much of\r\nWestern thought and Western civilisation as they could safely absorb\r\nwithout becoming denationalised. His complaint was that his own best\r\nefforts and best intentions were constantly thwarted by the rigid\r\nconservatism and aloofness of the European, official and unofficial,\r\nwrapped up in his racial and bureaucratic superiority. He admitted that\r\nhe might not yet be able to discharge with the European's efficiency the\r\nlegislative or administrative responsibilities for which he had hitherto\r\nbeen denied the necessary training, but he protested against being kept\r\naltogether out of the water until he had learnt to swim, especially\r\nwhen there was so little disposition ever to teach him to swim. What he\r\nlacked in the way of efficiency he alone, he argued, could supply in the\r\nway of sympathy with and understanding of his own people. When it was\r\nobjected that he represented only a very small minority of Indians, and\r\nformed, indeed, a class widely divided from the vast majority of his\r\nfellow-countrymen, and that the democratic institutions for which he\r\nclamoured were unsuited to the traditions and customs of his country, he\r\nreplied that in every country the impulse towards democratic\r\ninstitutions had come in the first instance from small minorities and\r\nhad always been regarded at first as subversive and revolutionary. If,\r\nagain, it was objected that the moderate and reasonable views he\r\nexpressed were not the views of the more ambitious politicians who\r\nprofessed to be the accredited interpreters of Western-educated India,\r\nthat there were many amongst them whose aims were more or less openly\r\nantagonistic to all the ideals for which British rule stands, and were\r\ndirected in reality not to the establishment of democratic institutions\r\nbut to the maintenance of caste monopoly and other evils inherent to the\r\nHindu social system, and that in the political arena he seemed incapable\r\nof asserting himself against these dangerous and reactionary elements,\r\nhis reply was once more that he had never received the support and\r\nencouragement which he had a right to expect from his European mentors,\r\nand that it was often their indifference or worse that had chiefly\r\nhelped to raise a spirit of revolt against every form of Western\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe case for the British administrator can be still more easily stated.\r\nBritain has never sent out a finer body of public servants, take them\r\nall in all, than those who have in the course of a few generations\r\nrescued India from anarchy, secured peace for her at home and abroad,\r\nmaintained equal justice amidst jealous and often warring communities\r\nand creeds, established new standards of tolerance and integrity, and\r\nraised the whole of India to a higher plane of material prosperity and\r\nof moral and intellectual development. They spend the best part of their\r\nlives in an exile which cuts them off from most of the amenities of\r\nsocial existence at home, and often involves the more or less prolonged\r\nsacrifice of the happiest family ties. Those especially whose work lies\r\nchiefly in the remote rural districts, far away from the few cities in\r\nwhich European conditions of life to some extent prevail, are brought\r\ndaily into the very closest contact with the people, and because of\r\ntheir absolute detachment from the prejudices and passions and material\r\ninterests by which Indian society, like all other societies, is largely\r\nswayed, they enjoy the confidence of the people often in a higher degree\r\nthan Indian officials whose detachment can never be so complete. Their\r\ntask has been to administer well and to do the best in their power for\r\nthe welfare of the population committed to their charge. The Englishman,\r\nas a rule, sticks to his own job. The British administrator's job had\r\nbeen to administer, and he had not yet been told that it was also his\r\njob to train up a nation on democratic lines and to instil into them the\r\nprinciples of civic duty as such duty is understood in Western\r\ncountries. No doubt there were British administrators in India whose\r\ninnate conservatism, coupled with the narrowness which years of routine\r\nwork and official self-confidence are apt to breed, revolted against any\r\ntransfer of power to, or any recognition of equality with, the people of\r\nthe country they had spent their lives in ruling with unquestioned but,\r\nas they at least conceived it, paternal authority. The conditions of\r\nbureaucratic rule inevitably tended to produce an autocratic temper. But\r\nit was not merely in obedience to that temper that they shrank from any\r\nchanges that would weaken the administration; the best of them at least\r\nhad a strong sense of their responsibilities as guardians and protectors\r\nof the simple and ignorant masses committed to their care. They might be\r\ninclined to judge the Western-educated class of Indians too harshly, and\r\nto identify them too closely with the type that was beginning to\r\ndominate the Indian National Congress, but the form in which the\r\nquestion of yielding to Indians any substantial part of their authority\r\npresented itself to their minds was by no means an entirely selfish one.\r\n\"Are we justified,\" they asked, \"in transferring our responsibilities\r\nfor the welfare and good government of such a large section of the human\r\nrace to a small minority which has hitherto shown so little disposition\r\nto approach any of the difficult problems with the solution of which the\r\nhappiness and progress of the overwhelming majority of their own race\r\nare bound up, though, because themselves belonging to the same stock and\r\nthe same social system, it would have been much easier for them to deal\r\nwith those problems than it is for alien rulers like ourselves? Those\r\nproblems arise out of the social system which is known as Hinduism--for\r\nHinduism is much more a social than a religious system. Western-educated\r\nIndians will not openly deny its evils--the iron-bound principle of\r\ncaste, which, in spite of many concessions in non-essentials to modern\r\nexigencies of convenience, remains almost untouched in all essentials\r\nand, above all, in the fundamental laws of inter-marriage, the social\r\noutlawry of scores of millions of the lower castes, labelled and treated\r\nas 'untouchable,' infant-marriage, the prohibition of the re-marriage of\r\nwidows, which, especially in the case of child-widows, condemns them to\r\na lifetime of misery and semi-servitude, the appalling infantile\r\nmortality, largely due to the prevalence of barbarous superstitions, the\r\neconomic waste resulting from lavish expenditure, often at the cost of\r\nlifelong indebtedness, upon marriages and funerals, and so forth and so\r\nforth. How many of the Western-educated Indians who have thrown\r\nthemselves into political agitation against the tyranny of the British\r\nbureaucracy have ever raised a finger to free their own\r\nfellow-countrymen from the tyranny of those social evils? How many of\r\nthem are entirely free from it themselves, or, if free, have the courage\r\nto act up to their opinions? At one time--before the Congress gave\r\nprecedence to political reforms--social reform did find many\r\nenthusiastic supporters amongst the best class of Western-educated\r\nIndians, but the gradual disappearance of men of that type may be said\r\nalmost to coincide with the growth of political agitation. There have\r\nbeen, and there still are, some notable and admirable exceptions, but\r\nthey are seldom to be found amongst the men who claim to be the tribunes\r\nof the Indian people. It is on these grounds--moral rather than\r\npolitical--that we claim to be still the best judges of our duties as\r\ntrustees for the people of India.\"\r\n\r\nThis was perhaps the most forcible of the British administrator's\r\narguments, and it was an honest one. Another was that the\r\nWestern-educated Indians were mainly drawn from the towns and from a\r\nnarrow circle of professional classes in the towns, who could not\r\ntherefore speak on behalf of and still less control the destinies of a\r\nvast population, overwhelmingly agricultural, regarding whose interests\r\nthey had hitherto shown themselves both ignorant and indifferent, and\r\nfrom whom the very education which constituted their main title to\r\nconsideration had tended to separate and estrange them. The land-owning\r\ngentry and the peasantry had so far scarcely been touched by this\r\npolitical agitation. The peasantry knew little or nothing of its\r\nexistence. The land-owners feared it, for, having themselves for the\r\nmost part kept aloof from modern education, and shrinking instinctively\r\nfrom the limelight of political controversies and such electioneering\r\ncompetitions as they had already been drawn into for municipal and local\r\ngovernment purposes, they felt themselves hopelessly handicapped in a\r\nstruggle that threatened their traditional prestige and authority as\r\nwell as their material interests. What they dreaded most of all was the\r\nascendancy of the lawyer class in this new political movement--the\r\n_Vakil-Raj_, as they called it--for they had in many instances already\r\nbeen made to feel how heavy the hand of the lawyer could be upon them\r\nin a country so prone to litigation as India, and endowed with so costly\r\nand complicated a system of jurisprudence and procedure, if they\r\nventured to place themselves in opposition to the political aspirations\r\nof ambitious lawyers. Above all, the British administrator, who rightly\r\nheld the maintenance of a strict balance between the different creeds\r\nand communities of India to be an essential part of his mission, felt\r\nstrong in the undivided support which his conception of his\r\nresponsibilities and duties received from the Mahomedans of India. Then,\r\nand almost into the second decade of this century, a community forming a\r\nfifth of the whole population professed itself absolutely opposed to any\r\nsurrender of British authority which, it was convinced, would enure\r\nsolely to the benefit of its hated Hindu rivals, far more supple and far\r\nmore advanced in all knowledge of the West, including political\r\nagitation. The Mahomedans had held aloof from the Congress. They still\r\nhad no definite political organisation of their own; they were content\r\nwith the British _raj_ and wanted nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe British administrator was therefore not altogether unwarranted in\r\nhis conviction that in standing in the ancient ways he had behind him\r\nnot only the tacit assent of the inarticulate masses but the positive\r\nsupport of very important classes and communities. He knew also that he\r\nhad with him, besides unofficial European opinion in India, almost solid\r\non his side, the sympathy, however vague and uninformed, of the bulk of\r\nhis own countrymen at home, represented for a great part of the fifty\r\nyears now under review by a succession of conservative parliaments and\r\ngovernments. There were no longer, as in the East India Company days,\r\nperiodical inquests into the state of India to wind up Parliament to a\r\nconcert pitch of sustained and vigilant interest in Indian affairs. The\r\nvery few legislators who exhibited any persistent curiosity about Indian\r\nadministration were regarded for the most part as cranks or bores, and\r\nthe annual statement on the Indian budget was usually made before\r\nalmost empty benches. Only questions that raised large issues of foreign\r\npolicy, such as Afghan expeditions and the Russian menace in Asia Minor,\r\nor that affected the considerable commercial interests at home, like the\r\nIndian cotton duties or currency and exchange, would intermittently stir\r\nBritish public opinion inside and outside Parliament, and these often\r\nchiefly as occasions for party warfare. Ministers themselves appeared to\r\nbe mainly concerned with the part which India had to play in their\r\ngeneral scheme of Imperial and Asiatic policy rather than with the\r\nmethods by which India was governed. These could be safely left to \"the\r\nman on the spot.\"\r\n\r\nVery different had been the spirit in which British parliaments and\r\ngovernments had discharged their responsibilities before the transfer of\r\nIndia to the Crown, and rude was the awakening for the British\r\nadministrator in India and for British ministers at home when the\r\nexplosion that followed the Partition of Bengal revealed a very\r\ndifferent India that was in process of evolution with much and dangerous\r\ntravail out of the reaction of new forces, hitherto almost unobserved,\r\nupon old forces so long quiescent that they had come to be regarded as\r\nnegligible quantities.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] A detailed and learned study of these movements is found in Dr.\r\nJ.N. Farquhar's _Modern Religious Movements in India_, published by\r\nthe Macmillan Company, New York, in 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST GREAT WAVE OF UNREST\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the Western-educated classes the new forces which had been\r\nturning the minds of young India towards _Swaraj_ as the watchword of\r\nnational unity and independence had drawn much of their inspiration from\r\ntext-books which taught them how large a share Nationalism had played in\r\nredeeming modern nations from alien oppression and in shaping the whole\r\npolitical evolution of Europe. It had emancipated the Balkan States from\r\nthe alien thraldom of the Ottoman Sultans; it had helped to unify Italy\r\nand Germany; it had been a potent if less apparent factor in welding\r\nGreat Britain and the distant colonies peopled by the British race into\r\na great British Empire. Had not Indians also a common nationhood which,\r\ndespite all racial and religious differences, could be traced back\r\nacross centuries of internal strife and foreign domination to a period,\r\nremote indeed but none the less enviable, when they had been their own\r\nmasters? Had not the British themselves removed one of the greatest\r\nbarriers to India's national unity--the multiplicity of her\r\nvernaculars--by giving English to the Western-educated classes as a\r\ncommon language, without which, indeed, Indian Nationalism could never\r\nhave found expression, and such an assembly of Indians from all parts of\r\nIndia to discuss their common aspirations as the Indian National\r\nCongress itself would have been an impossibility? Great events,\r\nmoreover, had been happening quite recently which tended to shake the\r\nIndians' belief in the irresistible superiority of Western civilisation\r\neven in its material aspects. The disaster inflicted upon an Italian\r\narmy at Adowa in 1894 by the Abyssinians--a backward African people\r\nscarcely known except for the ease with which a British expedition had\r\nchastised them not thirty years before--was perhaps the first of these\r\nevents to awaken observant Indians to the fact that European arms were\r\nnot necessarily invincible. The resistance put up for nearly three years\r\nby two small South African Republics, strong chiefly in their\r\nindomitable pride of nationhood, seemed to have strained the resources\r\neven of the British Empire, and Japan, an Asiatic power only recently\r\nemerged from obscurity, had just proved on land and sea that an Asiatic\r\nnation in possession of her national independence could equip herself to\r\nmeet and overcome one of the greatest of European powers--one whose vast\r\nambitions constituted in the eyes of generations of British statesmen a\r\ngrave menace to the safety of India itself. Was England really mightier\r\nthan Russia? Had she not also perhaps feet of clay? Was British rule to\r\nendure for ever? Was it not a weak point in England's armour that she\r\nhad to rely not a little on Indian troops, whom she still treated as\r\nmercenaries, to fight her battles even in such distant countries as\r\nChina and the Sudan, and upon still more numerous legions of Indians in\r\nevery branch of the civil administration to carry out all the menial\r\nwork of government? If the Indians, untrained, and indeed forbidden, to\r\nbear arms, were unable at once to overthrow British rule, could they not\r\nat least paralyse its machinery, as Bepin Chandra Pal was preaching, by\r\nrefusing to take any kind of service under it?\r\n\r\nTo such interpretations of contemporary events young Indians, who at\r\nschool read Burke and Byron and Mill \"On Liberty,\" and in secret the\r\nlives of Garibaldi and Mazzini, were bound to be receptive, and they\r\nsoon reached from a different base along different lines the same ground\r\non which the old orthodox foes not only of British rule but of Western\r\ncivilisation stood who appealed to the Baghavat-Ghita and exhorted\r\nIndia to seek escape from the foreign domination that had enslaved her,\r\nbody and soul, by clinging to the social and religious ark of Hinduism\r\nwhich in her golden age had made her wise and wealthy and free beyond\r\nall the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe stronghold of orthodox reaction was in the Mahratta Deccan, and its\r\nstoutest fighters were drawn from the Chitawan Brahmans, who had never\r\nforgiven us for snatching the cup of power from their lips just when\r\nthey saw the inheritance of the Moghul Empire within their grasp. First\r\nand foremost of them all was the late Mr. Tilak, a pillar of Hindu\r\northodoxy, who knew both in his speeches and in his Mahratta organ, the\r\n_Kesari_, _i.e._ \"The Lion,\" how to play on religious as well as on\r\nracial sentiment. He first took the field against the Hindu Social\r\nReformers who dared to support Lord Lansdowne's Age of Consent Bill, and\r\nhis rabid campaign against them developed quickly into an equally rabid\r\ncampaign against British rule. He appealed to the pride of his Mahratta\r\npeople by reviving the cult of Shivaji, the great Mahratta chieftain who\r\nfirst raised the standard of Hindu revolt against Mahomedan domination,\r\nand he appealed to their religious passions by placing under the\r\npatronage of their favourite deities a national movement for boycotting\r\nBritish-imported goods and manufactures which, under the name of\r\n_Swadeshi_, was to be the first step towards _Swaraj_. He it was too who\r\nfor the first time imported into schools and colleges the ferment of\r\npolitical agitation, and presided at bonfires which schoolboys and\r\nstudents fed with their European text-books and European clothes. The\r\nmovement died down for a time after the murder of two British officials\r\nin Poona on the night of Queen Victoria's second jubilee in 1897 and the\r\nsentencing of Tilak himself shortly afterwards to a term of imprisonment\r\non a charge of seditious and inflammatory writing. But the Partition of\r\nBengal was to give him the opportunity of transplanting his doctrines\r\nand his methods from the Deccan to the most prosperous province in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe Partition of Bengal was a measure harmless enough on the face of it\r\nfor splitting up into two administrative units a huge province with some\r\n70 million inhabitants which had outgrown the capacities of a single\r\nprovincial government. But the Bengalees are a singularly sensitive\r\nrace. They were intensely proud of their province as the senior of the\r\nthree great \"Presidencies\" of India, of their capital as the capital\r\ncity of India and the seat of Viceregal Government, and of their\r\nCalcutta University as the first and greatest of Indian Universities,\r\nthough already menaced, they declared, by Lord Curzon's Universities\r\nAct. They resented the Partition, against which they had no remedy, as a\r\nwanton _diminutio capitis_ inflicted upon them by a despotic Viceroy\r\nbent on chastising them for the prominent part played by their leaders\r\nin pressing the claims of India to political emancipation from\r\nbureaucratic leading-strings. That in the new province of Eastern\r\nBengal, which was to be created by the Partition, the Mahomedans would\r\nconstitute a large majority and enjoy advantages hitherto denied to them\r\nas a minority in the undivided province was an added grievance for the\r\nHindus. Lord Curzon had not at first been unpopular with the\r\nWestern-educated classes. They recognised his great intellectual gifts\r\nand admired his majestic eloquence. But continuing to fasten their hopes\r\non the Liberal party in England, they had quickly followed its lead in\r\nattacking him as a dangerous Imperialist, whose Tibetan adventure was\r\nsaddling the Indian tax-payer with the costs of his aggressive foreign\r\npolicy, and they required no promptings to denounce as the sworn foe of\r\nIndia a Viceroy who had not only sought to restrict the statutory\r\nfreedom of their University, but, as its Chancellor, used language into\r\nwhich they read a deliberate insult to the Bengalee character. By\r\npartitioning Bengal he had struck both at the dignity of the Bengalee\r\n\"nation\" and at the nationhood of the Indian Motherland, in whose\r\nhonour the old invocation to the goddess Kali, \"_Bande Materam_,\" or\r\n\"Hail to the Mother,\" acquired a new significance and came to be used as\r\nthe political war-cry of Indian Nationalism. To that war-cry public\r\nmeetings were organised in Calcutta and all over the province. The\r\nnative press teemed with denunciatory articles. The wildest rumours were\r\nset afloat as to the more concrete mischiefs which partition portended.\r\nNever had India seen such popular demonstrations. Government, however,\r\nremained inflexible, and the storm abated when it was announced that\r\nLord Curzon had resigned and was about to leave India--the last and\r\nperhaps the ablest and certainly the most forceful Viceroy of a period\r\nin which efficient administration had come to be regarded as the be-all\r\nand end-all of government. His resignation, however, had nothing to do\r\nwith the Partition. He had fought and been defeated by Lord Kitchener,\r\nthen, and largely at his instance, Commander-in-Chief in India, over the\r\nreorganisation of the military administration. Lord Curzon stood for the\r\nsupremacy of the civil over the military authority, but he made the\r\nmistake of resigning not on the question of principle, on which he\r\nfinally agreed to a compromise, but on a subsidiary point which, fatal\r\nas he may have thought it to the spirit of the compromise, appeared to\r\nthe outside public to be mainly a personal question. In any case, though\r\non the merits of the quarrel he might have looked for support from\r\neducated Indian opinion, Bengal was content to rejoice over his\r\ndisappearance and to wonder whether with its author the Partition might\r\nnot also disappear.\r\n\r\nAnother and worthier preoccupation was the impending visit of the Prince\r\nand Princess of Wales to India. King Edward's son was to follow in the\r\nfootsteps of his father, who had for the first time made a Royal\r\nprogress through the Indian Empire nearly thirty years before. His\r\nprogress had been a triumphal one at a period when the internal and\r\nexternal peace of India seemed equally profound. That of his son was no\r\nless triumphal, though India was just entering on a period of political\r\nunrest undreamt of in the preceding generation. Even in Calcutta, which\r\nhad been seething with agitation a few weeks before, the Prince and\r\nPrincess were received not only with loyal acclamations but almost with\r\ngod-like worship; and all these demonstrations were perfectly genuine.\r\nFor with the curious inconsistency which pervades all Indian\r\nspeculations religious and political, though countless dynasties have\r\nfallen and countless rulers have come to a violent end in the chequered\r\nannals of Indian history, nothing has ever destroyed the ancient\r\nconception of royalty as partaking of the divine essence. The remoteness\r\nof the Western rulers under whose sceptre India had passed lent if\r\nanything an added mystery and majesty to the royalty they wielded. Even\r\nthe avowed enemies of British rule seldom levelled their shafts at the\r\nThrone. That the King can do no wrong is a saying that appealed to the\r\nIndian mind long before the Western-educated classes grasped its real\r\nmeaning under a constitutional monarchy, and began to extend its\r\napplication even to the King's Government for the purpose of\r\nconveniently discriminating between the British Government, whose good\r\nintentions were generally assumed, and the autocratic Government of\r\nIndia, whence all mischief sprang. During the whole of the Royal tour,\r\nwhich extended to all the major provinces of British India and to\r\nseveral of the Native States, the enthusiasm was general, and even the\r\nExtremists did not venture a discordant note. The Prince and Princess,\r\nwhose graciousness never wearied, moved freely amongst the crowds, and\r\nthe presence of the future Queen appealed strongly to the women of\r\nIndia, whose influence we are apt to underrate because until recently it\r\nhas been exercised almost exclusively in the seclusion of the zenana.\r\nEven high-caste ladies, Hindus as well as Mahomedans, were known on this\r\noccasion for the first time perhaps in their lives to pass beyond the\r\nouter gates of their houses in order to attend a Royal reception--with\r\nall the precautions of course that have always to be taken to shelter a\r\n_purdah_ party from any contact with the other sex.\r\n\r\nIt became the fashion for all classes to draw their own happy auguries\r\nfrom the Royal visit, but to none did it seem so auspicious as to the\r\npolitically-minded Indians. For it coincided with the sweeping defeat of\r\nthe Unionist party at the general election of 1905 and the return to\r\noffice of a Liberal Government with a crushing majority behind it, whom\r\nthe hostility displayed by the Liberal party towards Lord Curzon's\r\nadministration on almost every Indian question save that which had\r\nbrought about his resignation seemed to pledge to a prompt reversal of\r\nhis policy. Was not the appointment to the India Office of such a\r\nstalwart Radical as Mr. John Morley, who had been Gladstone's Home Rule\r\nSecretary for Ireland, enough to justify the expectation that the right\r\nof India, if not to Home Rule, to a large measure of enfranchisement\r\nwould receive prompt recognition? If Indians could hardly regard Lord\r\nCurzon's successor as another Ripon, their first impression of Lord\r\nMinto satisfied them that, though the Conservative nominee of Mr.\r\nBalfour's Government, the new Viceroy was neither disposed to tread in\r\nhis predecessor's footsteps as an autocratic administrator nor likely to\r\ncarry sufficient weight at home to stand in the way of a Secretary of\r\nState who, like many Radical doctrinaires, was essentially what the\r\nFrench call _un homme d'autorité_. The event proved that they were right\r\nin their estimate of Lord Minto, but wrong in their sanguine expectation\r\nthat Mr. Morley would at once break with the old principles of Indian\r\ngovernment or even with Lord Curzon's administrative methods. Bengal\r\nremained partitioned. It was a _chose jugée_ which Mr. Morley was not\r\nprepared to reopen.\r\n\r\nThe disillusionment in India was much greater than after the fiasco of\r\nthe Ilbert Bill in Lord Ripon's time, and there had been a vast if still\r\nunsuspected change since those days in the whole atmosphere of India.\r\nDisillusionment in the 'eighties was mainly confined to a small group of\r\nWestern-educated Indians who had hoped for better things but did not\r\ndespair of bringing constitutional methods of agitation to bear upon\r\nBritish public opinion. In 1906 the Indian National Congress, which they\r\nhad founded twenty years before, was sliding rapidly down the inclined\r\nplane which was to lead first to open and violent discord and later on\r\nto disruption. Even before the Partition the Moderates could make but a\r\npoor reply to those who jeered at the paltry results which had attended\r\ntheir practice of constitutional forms of agitation. For if the Indian\r\nCouncils Act of 1892 had opened the doors of the Viceroy's Legislative\r\nAssembly to some of the most distinguished among them, what had it\r\nprofited them? The official benches merely gave a courteous hearing to\r\nthe incisive criticisms proceeding from men of such undisputed capacity\r\nas Mehta and Gokhale and bore less patiently with the Ciceronian periods\r\nof the great Bengalee tribune Surendranath Banerjee. Government paid\r\nlittle or no heed to them. Equally powerless had been their passionate\r\nprotest against the Partition. Even had they not been in complete\r\nsympathy with popular feeling, they would have been compelled to voice\r\nit or surrender the leadership they still hoped to retain to the new\r\nExtremist party which, under Mr. Tilak's leadership, was carrying his\r\ndoctrines and his methods far beyond the limits of the Deccan. Each\r\nannual session of the Congress grew more turbulent and the Moderates\r\ngave ground each year, until at the famous Surat session of 1907 they\r\nrealised that they had to make a definite stand or go under. There the\r\nstorm burst over the preliminary proceedings before the real issues were\r\nreached. Mr. Tilak's followers assailed the presidential platform of\r\nwhich the Moderates had still retained possession, and the Congress\r\nbroke up in hopeless confusion and disorder.\r\n\r\nBut what happened in the Congress was but a pale reflection of what was\r\nhappening outside. The Partition was indeed little more than the signal\r\nfor an explosion, not merely in Bengal, of which premonitory indications\r\nhad been witnessed, but had passed almost unheeded, some ten years\r\nearlier in the Deccan. The cry of _Swaraj_ was caught up and re-echoed\r\nin every province of British India. In Calcutta the vow of _Swadeshi_\r\nwas administered at mass meetings in the famous temple of Kali. Hindu\r\nreactionaries, whose conception of a well-ordered society had not moved\r\nbeyond the laws of Manu, fell into line for the moment with the\r\nintellectual products of the modern Indian University. Hindu ascetics\r\nappealed to the credulity of the masses and every Bar Association became\r\nthe centre of an active political propaganda on a Western democratic\r\nmodel. Schoolboys and students were exhorted to abandon their studies\r\nand go out into the streets, where they qualified as patriots by\r\nmarching in the van of national demonstrations for _Swaraj_ or by\r\nfurnishing picketing parties for the _Swadeshi_ boycott. The native\r\npress, whether printed in the vernacular tongues or in the language of\r\nthe British tyrant, reached the extreme limits of licence, and when it\r\ndid not actually preach violence it succeeded in producing the\r\natmosphere which engenders violence. When passions were wrought up to a\r\nwhite heat by fiery orators and still more fiery newspaper writers, who\r\nknew how to draw equally effectively on the ancient legends of Hindu\r\nmythology and on the contemporary records of Russian anarchism, the cult\r\nof the bomb was easily grafted on to the cult of Shiva, the Destroyer,\r\nand murders, of which the victims were almost as often Indians in\r\nGovernment service as British-born officials, were invested with a halo\r\nof religious and patriotic heroism. Youths even of the better classes\r\nbanded themselves together to collect patriotic funds by plunder and\r\nviolence, and revived those old forms of lawlessness which had been\r\nrampant in pre-British days under the name of _dacoity_. Schools and\r\ncolleges were found to be honeycombed with secret societies, and a flood\r\nof light was suddenly thrown on the disastrous workings of an\r\neducational system that had been slowly perverted to such ends under the\r\nvery eyes of the Government that was supposed to direct and control it.\r\n\r\nLord Curzon had held a special conference at Simla in 1900 \"to consider\r\nthe system of education in India,\" but not a single Indian and only one\r\nnon-official European had been invited to take part in it. It was the\r\nintellectual shortcomings of the system with which he was concerned, and\r\nthe chief outcome of that conference and of a Commission subsequently\r\nappointed to carry on the inquiry was the Universities Act of 1904,\r\ncarried in the face of bitter Indian opposition. Even such broad-minded\r\nand experienced Indians as Gokhale and Mehta suspected the Viceroy of a\r\ndesire to hamper the growth of higher Western education on political\r\ngrounds. But throughout the four years' controversy Government never\r\nbetrayed an inkling of the appalling extent to which inferior secondary\r\neducation had been allowed to degenerate in second-and third-rate\r\nschools with second-and third-rate masters into a mere teaching machine,\r\nclumsy and imperfect at that, for the passing of examinations that\r\ntested memory rather than intelligence, and character least of all. The\r\nunfortunate youths who could not stand even that test were left\r\nhopelessly stranded on the road, equally disqualified for a humbler\r\nsphere of life which they had learnt to despise and for the higher walks\r\nto which they had vainly aspired. Soured by defeat, and easily persuaded\r\nto impute it solely to the alien rulers responsible for a system which\r\nhad led them merely into a blind alley, they formed the rank and file of\r\na proletariat that could only by courtesy be called intellectual, but\r\nwas just the material out of which every form of discontent is apt to\r\nbreed desperadoes. But many were no mere vulgar desperadoes. Amongst\r\nthose who were engaged in making bombs and collecting revolvers and\r\norganising dacoities or who actually committed murder not a few\r\nsincerely believed that they were risking or giving their lives in a\r\ngreat patriotic and religious cause. The _Yugantar_, their chief\r\nBengalee organ, which had an enormous circulation and sold often at\r\nfancy prices in the streets of Calcutta, was written, according to a\r\nstatement made in the High Court by the Government translator whose\r\nbusiness it was to study it, in language so lofty, so pathetic, so\r\nstirring that he found it impossible to convey it into English. The\r\nwriters made no secret of their purpose. The young Indian's \"mind must\r\nbe excited and maddened by such an ideal as will present to him a\r\npicture of everlasting salvation.\" Murder had its creed to which Dr.\r\nFarquhar assigns a definite place in his _Modern Religious Movements in\r\nIndia_ with the following as its chief dogmas:\r\n\r\n     Indian civilisation in all its branches,--religion, education, art,\r\n     industry, home life and government,--is healthy, spiritual,\r\n     beautiful and good. It has become corrupted in the course of\r\n     centuries, but that is largely the result of the cruelty and\r\n     aggression of the Muhammadans in former times and now of the\r\n     British. The Indian patriot must toil to restore Indian life and\r\n     civilisation.\r\n\r\n     Western civilisation in all its parts,--religion, education, art,\r\n     business and government,--is gross, materialistic and therefore\r\n     degrading to India. The patriotic Indian must recognise the grave\r\n     danger lurking in every element of Western influence, must hate it,\r\n     and must be on his guard against it.\r\n\r\n     India ought to be made truly Indian. There is no place for\r\n     Europeans in the country. Indians can manage everything far better\r\n     than Europeans can. The British Government, Missions, European\r\n     trade and Western influence of every kind, are altogether unhealthy\r\n     in India. Everything should belong to the Indians themselves.\r\n\r\n     Hence it is a religious duty to get rid of the European and all the\r\n     evils that attend him. The better a man understands his religion,\r\n     the more clear will be his perception that Europeans and European\r\n     influence must be rooted out. All means for the attainment of this\r\n     end are justifiable. As Krishna killed Kamsa, so the modern Indian\r\n     must kill the European demons that are tyrannically holding India\r\n     down. The bloodthirsty goddess Kali ought to be honoured by the\r\n     Indian patriot. Even the Baghavad Ghita was used to teach murder.\r\n     Lies, deceit, murder, everything, it was argued, may be rightly\r\n     used.\r\n\r\nNot till some years later did a Committee, presided over by a British\r\nHigh Court judge sent out from England for the purpose, fully explore\r\nthe many ramifications of a revolutionary movement which had one of its\r\nhead centres in London, until the murder of Sir W. Curzon-Wylie by an\r\nIndian student during a crowded reception at the Imperial Institute\r\naroused the attention of the authorities to the activities of the \"India\r\nHouse,\" and Mr. Krishnavarma, its familiar genius, had to transfer to\r\nParis his notorious paper, the _Indian Sociologist_, in which he openly\r\nglorified murder. The \"Sedition Committee's\" Report was only made public\r\nin 1918, and if the action taken upon it by the Government of India was\r\nto furnish the occasion for another popular explosion different in\r\ncharacter from, but no less formidable than, the explosion which\r\nfollowed the Partition of Bengal, the facts which it marshalled and the\r\nconclusions which it drew from them with judicial soberness have never\r\nbeen seriously challenged. It found that the long series of crimes of\r\nwhich it recorded the genesis and growth had been \"directed towards one\r\nand the same objective, the overthrow by force of British rule in\r\nIndia,\" and nothing revealed more clearly the mainspring of the movement\r\nthan the statistics given as to age, caste, and occupation of persons\r\nwho had been actually convicted of revolutionary crimes or killed whilst\r\ncommitting them. The large majority were between 16 and 25 years of age;\r\nmost of them students and teachers; all of them Hindus, and almost all\r\nhigh-caste Hindus, either Brahmans or Kayasthas--the latter a\r\nwriter-caste ranking just below the Brahman caste. These statistics did\r\nnot cover the large number of crimes of which the authors escaped\r\nscot-free and were never brought to justice.\r\n\r\nNot the least alarming feature of the situation was the attitude of the\r\nIndian public generally towards this epidemic of political crime which\r\nassumed some forms hitherto quite unknown to India and abhorrent to\r\nmost Indians. The movement could only be correctly described as an\r\nAnarchist movement in so far as the methods to which it resorted were\r\nlargely modelled upon those of Russian anarchists and aimed, like\r\ntheirs, at the subversion of the existing Government. It differed\r\nfundamentally from Russian anarchism in that it was directed against\r\nalien rulers of another faith and another civilisation. That it created\r\na widespread feeling of apprehension and even of detestation amongst the\r\ngreat majority of peaceful and sober-minded Indians cannot be doubted,\r\nand especially amongst those who watched with alarm the ravages it was\r\nmaking amongst the younger generation. But few had the courage to carry\r\nreprobation to the length of assisting Government in the detection and\r\nrepression of crimes which terrorism made it less dangerous to extenuate\r\nas lamentable exhibitions of a misguided patriotic frenzy. The\r\nWestern-educated classes were completely estranged and smarted so\r\nbitterly over the contempt with which their representations and protests\r\nagainst the policy of Government had been treated that those even of the\r\nmore moderate school of politics were content to throw up their hands in\r\nhorror and declare that if they were unable to stem the torrent, the\r\nfault lay entirely with the bureaucracy which had killed by long years\r\nof neglect and hostility the influence they might have otherwise been\r\nable to exert over their fellow-countrymen in the hour of stress. The\r\nExtremists boldly threw the whole responsibility for the movement on\r\nBritish rule and combined with a perfunctory and dubious condemnation of\r\nthe crimes themselves an ecstatic admiration for the heroism which had\r\ndriven the youth of India to follow the example of the Russian\r\n_intelligentsia_ in its revolt against an autocracy as brutal and as\r\nodious as that of Russia. Mere measures of repression under the ordinary\r\nlaw were clearly incapable of coping with a situation which was becoming\r\nno less dangerous in its negative than in its positive aspects. British\r\nrule in India had concentrated so largely on mechanical efficiency that\r\nit had gradually lost sight of the old and finer principles of\r\nAnglo-Indian as well as of British statesmanship based on the paramount\r\nimportance of genuine co-operation between British and Indians. During\r\nthe Mutiny there were few of the Western-educated classes whose loyalty\r\nto the British _Raj_ ever wavered. Fifty years later, when the _Raj_ was\r\nconfronted with a less violent but more insidious movement of revolt, a\r\nlarge part of the Western-educated classes, whose influence and numbers\r\nhad increased immensely in the interval, were, if not in league, at\r\nleast to some extent in sympathy with it, and many of those who deplored\r\nand reprobated it remained sulking in their tents. Government, they\r\ndeclared, had always despised their co-operation. As it had made its\r\nbed, so it must lie. It was a desperately short-sighted attitude, which\r\nhas had its nemesis in the \"Non-co-operation\" movement of the present\r\nday. But, in a situation so severely strained, relief could only come\r\nfrom England and from a return to the earlier British ideals, and to\r\nthose Indians who still looked for it there with some confidence after\r\nthe change of Government which had taken place at home in December 1905\r\nit seemed to come very slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MORLEY-MINTO REFORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nA British Government of a more advanced type of liberalism than any of\r\nits Liberal predecessors found itself confronted as soon as it took\r\noffice with a more difficult situation in India than had ever been\r\ndreamt of since the Mutiny, and the difficulties grew rapidly more\r\ngrave. When Mr. Morley went to the India Office during the respite from\r\nagitation against the Partition of Bengal, procured by the visit of the\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales to India even more than by Lord Curzon's\r\ndeparture from India, the new Secretary of State allowed himself to be\r\npersuaded that an agitation directed, so far, mainly against a harmless\r\nmeasure of mere administrative importance must be largely artificial,\r\nand he determined to maintain the Partition. He was entirely new to\r\nIndian affairs, and his _Recollections_ show him to have been often\r\nsorely perplexed by the conflict between his own political instincts and\r\nthe picture of Indian conditions placed before him by his official\r\nadvisers at home and in India. He felt, however, on the whole fairly\r\nconfident that he could deal with the situation by producing a moderate\r\nmeasure of reforms which would satisfy India's political aspirations and\r\nby keeping an extremely vigilant eye on Indian methods of administration\r\nof which \"sympathy\" was in future to be the key-note rather than mere\r\nefficiency. But when in the course of 1907 the agitation broke out\r\nafresh with increased fury and began to produce a crop of political\r\noutrages, Mr. Morley found himself in a particularly awkward position.\r\nHe was known from his Irish days to be no believer in coercion. But the\r\nGovernment of India was not to be denied when it insisted that a\r\ncampaign of murder could not be tolerated and that repression was as\r\nnecessary as reform. The Secretary of State agreed reluctantly to\r\nsanction more stringent legislation for dealing with the excesses of the\r\nExtremist press in India, but he was only the more resolved that it must\r\nbe accompanied by a liberal reforms scheme. The Viceroy himself shared\r\nthis view and lent willing assistance. But the interchange of opinions\r\nbetween India and Whitehall was as usual terribly lengthy and laborious.\r\nA Royal Proclamation on November 28, 1908, the fiftieth anniversary of\r\nQueen Victoria's Proclamation after the Mutiny, foreshadowed reforms in\r\n\"political satisfaction of the claims of important classes representing\r\nideas that have been fostered and encouraged by British rule.\" But not\r\ntill the following month, _i.e._ three years after Mr. Morley had taken\r\nover the India Office, did the reforms scheme see the light of day.\r\n\r\nIt bore his impress. He had a ready ear for Indian grievances and much\r\nunderstanding for the Moderate Indian point of view. He was prepared to\r\ngive Indians a larger consultative voice in the conduct of Indian\r\naffairs, and even to introduce individual Indians not only into his own\r\nCouncil at Whitehall but even into the Viceroy's Executive Council, the\r\ncitadel of British authority in India. He was determined to enforce far\r\nmore energetically than most of his predecessors the constitutional\r\nright of the Secretary of State to form and lay down the policy for\r\nwhich his responsibility was to the British Parliament alone, while the\r\nfunction of the Government of India was, after making to him whatever\r\nrepresentations it might deem desirable, to carry his decisions\r\nfaithfully and fully into execution. He was prepared to exercise also to\r\nthe full his right to control the administrative as well as the\r\nexecutive acts of the Government of India and its officers. He was not\r\nprepared to devolve upon Indians collectively any part of the\r\nconstitutional powers vested in the Indian Executive and ultimately\r\nthrough the Secretary of State in the British Parliament. He was not\r\ntherefore prepared to give India any representative institutions that\r\nshould circumscribe or share the power of the Indian Executive. The\r\nIndian Councils Act of 1909 was drawn up on those lines. It enlarged the\r\nmembership and the functions of the Indian Legislative Councils, and\r\nplaced them definitely on an elective basis without doing away\r\naltogether with nominations by Government. The only point upon which Mr.\r\nMorley yielded to pressure was in conceding the principle of community\r\nrepresentation in favour of the Mahomedans, to whom, at a time when they\r\nnot only held rigidly aloof from all political agitation but professed\r\ngreat anxiety as to political concessions of which the benefit would,\r\nthey submitted, accrue mainly to the Hindus, Lord Minto had given a\r\npromise that in any future reforms scheme full consideration should be\r\ngiven to the historical importance and actual influence of their\r\ncommunity rather than to its mere numerical strength.\r\n\r\nThe Indian Councils Act, 1909, fell considerably short of the demands\r\nput forward even by the founders of the Congress five-and-twenty years\r\nbefore, as the new Councils, greatly enlarged, were still to be merely\r\nconsultative assemblies. But it did for the first time admit \"the living\r\nforces of the elective principle,\" and to that extent it met the demand\r\nfor representative institutions. Indian Moderates could point also to\r\nthe presence of an Indian member, Sir Satyendra (now Lord) Sinha, in the\r\nViceroy's Executive Council and of two Indian members in the Secretary\r\nof State's Council at Whitehall as a definite proof that India would\r\nhave henceforth a hearing before, and not as in the past merely after,\r\nthe adoption of vital lines of policy. The Act was accepted by the\r\nModerate leaders as a genuine if not a generous instalment of reform,\r\nand it restored to some extent their influence as the advocates of\r\nconstitutional progress by showing that the British Government had not\r\nbeen altogether deaf to their appeals. It did not of course satisfy the\r\nExtremists, but their influence had suffered a great set-back from the\r\nwrecking of the Surat Congress, their great Deccanee leader was working\r\nout a long term of imprisonment at Mandalay, and with the tide of\r\nanarchism still spreading and visibly demoralising the student class all\r\nover India, even to the undermining of parental authority, the first\r\nfeeling of suppressed and largely inarticulate alarm and resentment\r\ndeveloped into a definite reaction in favour of government as by law\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe great wave of unrest which had swept over India was already\r\nsubsiding when Lord Minto left India in 1910 amidst genuine\r\ndemonstrations of returning goodwill, and the appointment of Lord\r\nHardinge of Penshurst as his successor was welcomed in the same spirit,\r\nnot because Lord Kitchener, who had run him very hard for the\r\nViceroyalty, was personally unpopular in India, but because he owed to\r\nreactionary supporters the quite unmerited reputation of being \"the man\r\nwith the big stick.\"\r\n\r\nThe visit of the King and Queen to India at the end of 1911 was\r\ntherefore well timed, and it provoked a still greater outburst of\r\npopular enthusiasm than their visit as Prince and Princess of Wales in\r\n1905. For it was the first time that the Sovereign to whom it was given\r\nto rule over India from a remote Western island travelled out to receive\r\non Indian soil the homage of his Indian subjects and appeared before\r\nthem in the full majesty of crown, orb, and sceptre. Apart entirely from\r\nthe merits of the measure, the dramatic transfer of the capital of his\r\nIndian Empire from Calcutta to Delhi appealed to the imagination of\r\nIndians as a demonstration of the Royal power no less impressive than\r\nthe splendours of the great Durbar at which the Royal command went\r\nforth. Equally did their Majesties fulfil another of the time-honoured\r\nconceptions of royalty by knowing, so to say, when to step down from\r\ntheir throne and mix freely with the people. It has been from times\r\nimmemorial one of the principles of Indian rulership that the ruler\r\ncannot deny to his subjects the privilege of access to his person, and\r\nmany are those who have gained more popularity by giving ample\r\nopportunity to their subjects for stating to them their grievances in\r\nthe royal presence than by ever actually redressing them. In Calcutta\r\nespecially when the King and Queen moved cheerfully amongst the\r\ndelirious crowds that had thronged to the Maidan to worship them, the\r\nscene surpassed all previous experiences. For had not one of the\r\nmeasures announced as the Royal will at the Delhi Durbar been the\r\nrevision at last of Lord Curzon's detested Partition of Bengal? The\r\nfurious agitation of the first few years had broken in vain against the\r\ndead wall of the _chose jugée_ which Mr. Morley had upheld, and it had\r\ngradually died down. The wound, however, had been still there, and now\r\nthe King's hand had touched and healed it. The old Province of Bengal\r\nwas not indeed restored within its former limits, but Eastern Bengal,\r\ncreated as the Hindu Bengalees believed, in favour of Mahomedan\r\nascendancy, disappeared, and in its stead Behar and Orissa, where a\r\nlarge part of the population was of a different stock and spoke a\r\ndifferent tongue, were detached to the west and south of Bengal proper\r\nand formed into a separate province which served equally well to relieve\r\nadministrative congestion without doing violence to Bengalee sentiment.\r\n\r\nOn the very first anniversary, however, of the day of the great Delhi\r\nDurbar an audacious attempt to murder the Viceroy at the moment when he\r\nwas making his solemn entry into the new capital came as a painful\r\nreminder that the fangs of Indian anarchism had not yet been drawn. From\r\none of the balconies of the Chandni Chauk, the chief thoroughfare of the\r\nnative city, a bomb was thrown at Lord Hardinge who was riding with Lady\r\nHardinge on a State elephant, in accordance with Indian usage, on his\r\nway to the Fort where he was to have delivered a message of greeting to\r\nthe people of India recalling the memorable results of the Royal visit.\r\nThe Viceroy was severely wounded and Lady Hardinge, though she escaped\r\nwithout any apparent hurt, suffered a shock which at least hastened her\r\npremature death two and a half years later. Lord Hardinge had already\r\nearned the widespread confidence of Indians by his undisguised sympathy\r\nwith all their legitimate aspirations, and the Lady Hardinge's School of\r\nMedicine for Indian women stands now at Delhi as an enduring monument,\r\nnot only of the keen interest which she took in the cause of Indian\r\nwomanhood and in everything that could tend to its advancement, but of\r\nthe affection she had won by a rare charm of manner that was, with her,\r\nmerely the outward reflection of a gentle and finely tempered nature.\r\nThere had been abortive plots against Lord Minto's life, but it had been\r\ndeemed politic to minimise their importance. This, however, was an\r\nattempt too flagrant and too nearly fatal to be disguised or denied, and\r\na thrill of horror which hushed even the Extremists went through the\r\nwhole of India, for to the office of the Viceroy as the personal\r\nrepresentative of the sovereign there had always hitherto attached\r\nsomething of the sanctity with which, according to Indian beliefs, all\r\nkingship is invested. All the more grateful was the response elicited by\r\nthe assurance which Lord Hardinge hastened to convey from his sick-bed\r\nthat what had happened could and would in no way diminish his affection\r\nand devotion to the people of India or modify the policy of goodwill and\r\nprogress for which he stood. Neither he nor India ever forgot that\r\nassurance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the artificial basis upon which the Morley-Minto reforms\r\nhad been built revealed itself very soon under the searching test of\r\npractical experience. The Councils Act of 1909 had made no attempt to\r\norganise on an effective and genuine basis \"the living forces of the\r\nelective principle.\" The indirect system of election established under\r\nthe Act could only produce haphazard and misleading results. An indirect\r\nchain of elections afforded no means of appraising the true\r\nrelationship between the elected members of the Councils and their\r\noriginal electors. The qualifications of candidates, as well as of\r\nelectors, varied widely from province to province, but shared one common\r\ncharacteristic, that the election was more often a matter of form.\r\nMembers of the Provincial Councils were returned partly by Municipal and\r\nLocal Boards arranged in various groups, without any connection with, or\r\nmandate from, the constituencies by which these bodies had been chosen,\r\npartly by a land-holding community which did not consider itself bound\r\nby the acts of its constituted representatives. The so-called\r\nelectorates were never known to give definite mandates to those who\r\nprofessed to represent them or to pronounce upon any course of action\r\nwhich their representatives might pursue. Nobody knew what was the\r\nnumerical foundation on which an elected member took his seat. It was\r\nalmost impossible to trace it back along the chain of indirect\r\nelections. Before the British Reform Bill of 1832 much play was made of\r\npocket boroughs of twenty or thirty electors. In India, one constituency\r\nelecting a member to the Imperial Legislative Council numbered exactly\r\nseven, and there were cases where the representation was pretty well\r\nknown to have been divided by agreement between two individuals. Nor did\r\nthe recommendations of a Royal Commission on Decentralisation avail to\r\nbreak down that spirit of over-centralisation which had of late years\r\nmarked the policy of the Government of India. The Provincial Governments\r\nstill remained bound hand and foot by the necessity of constant\r\nreference to the Central Government, while the latter in its turn was\r\nforced to make an ever-increasing number of references to Whitehall,\r\nwhere Mr. Morley enforced, far beyond the practice of any previous\r\nSecretary of State, the principle that the Provincial Governments were\r\nresponsible to the Central Government, and the Central Government to the\r\nIndia Office for every detail of administration.\r\n\r\nMore galling to Indians was it to have to admit that the expansion of\r\nIndian representation in the Councils had not been followed by any\r\nvisible increase of Indian control over the conduct of public affairs.\r\nWhilst disclaiming warmly any intention of paving the way for the\r\nintroduction of parliamentary institutions into India, Mr. Morley had\r\nallowed an illusory semblance of parliamentary institutions to be\r\nintroduced into the enlarged Councils by requiring their sanction for\r\nlegislative measures brought forward by the Executive. The latter had to\r\ngo through the same forms of procedure as if its existence depended upon\r\nthe support of a parliamentary majority to which it was responsible,\r\nwhereas it continued to be irremovable and responsible only to the\r\nSecretary of State. These were in fact mere empty forms, for however\r\nunpalatable any measure might be to the Indian members, or however\r\npowerful their arguments against it, Government could always vote the\r\nIndian opposition down in the Viceroy's Legislative Council, the most\r\nimportant of all, by mustering the official majority in full force to\r\ndeliver their votes according to instructions. In the Provincial\r\nCouncils on the other hand in which an unofficial majority had been\r\nconceded, the Indian members were in a position to create a deadlock by\r\nrefusing to vote for measures indispensable to the proper conduct of\r\nGovernment; but whilst the power they could thus exercise might go far\r\nenough to paralyse the Executive, they had no power to turn it out.\r\nThese new Councils had been invested with large but mostly negative\r\npowers, and with no positive responsibilities.\r\n\r\nFor a time the sentiment of trust which underlay the granting of the\r\nreforms had its effect. Both sides seemed to display a more conciliatory\r\nspirit and the relations between the official and unofficial benches in\r\nthe enlarged Councils assumed a more friendly character. In many cases\r\nthe influence of the non-official members was successfully exerted to\r\nsecure modifications in the legislative measures of Government, though\r\nfrom a mistaken desire to \"save its face\" Government too often preferred\r\nto make concessions at private conferences with the Indian leaders\r\nrather than as the outcome of public discussion, and lost thereby a good\r\ndeal of the credit which it might have secured by a more open display of\r\nits desire to meet Indian objections. On some occasions before the war\r\nthe pressure of Indian opinion even deterred Provincial Governments from\r\nintroducing legislative measures which they considered essential to\r\npublic safety because they apprehended defeat at the hands of the\r\nunofficial majority in the legislative Councils. But the Indian public\r\nremained generally in ignorance of the extent to which the influence of\r\nthe Indian representatives made itself felt, either for good or for\r\nevil, on Government. The bureaucracy, more secretive in India than\r\nelsewhere, had never realised the importance of guiding public opinion,\r\nor, _a fortiori_, the necessity of keeping it informed if you wish to\r\nguide it. The politicians, on the other hand, preferred to make capital\r\nout of those questions on which they failed to make any impression upon\r\nGovernment, though the real difficulty very often lay in the rigidity of\r\nthe statutory control exercised by the Central Government over\r\nProvincial Governments, and by Whitehall over the Central Government.\r\nThe inevitable consequences soon became clear. The enlarged Indian\r\nrepresentation appeared to have less power than it really enjoyed, and,\r\nhaving no responsibility whatever, it was free to make its own bids for\r\npopularity with constituencies equally irresponsible. Resolutions were\r\nintroduced which, if they could have carried them, the unofficial\r\nmembers would often have been much puzzled to carry into effect, and\r\ngrievances were voiced which, even when well founded, it was frequently\r\nbeyond the power of any Government to remedy. On the other hand, the\r\nExecutive was threatened with the possibility of a complete deadlock,\r\nand the concessions by which it could be averted often alarmed not\r\nmerely the innate conservatism of the official world but many Indian\r\ninterests scarcely less conservative.\r\n\r\nNot till after Mr. Morley had been raised to the peerage and Lord Crewe\r\nhad succeeded him at the India Office was anything done to meet the\r\ndemand of the Western-educated classes for a larger share in the\r\nadministrative work of the country or to redress the very reasonable\r\ngrievances of Indians employed in the Government services who were still\r\nfor the most part penned up in the Provincial Services as established on\r\nthe recommendations of the Aitcheson Committee more than twenty-five\r\nyears earlier. In 1912 a Royal Commission went out to India with Lord\r\nIslington as Chairman. It was a body on which the British element in the\r\nIndian Public Services was only represented by a small minority, and\r\namongst the European members Lord Ronaldshay and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald,\r\nboth then in the House of Commons, stood for widely different schools of\r\npolitics. Of the three Indian members, Mr. Gokhale, who had become one\r\nof the most influential leaders of the Moderate party, carried by far\r\nthe greatest weight, and his premature death before the Commission\r\ncompleted its Report seriously impaired its usefulness. It spent two\r\nsuccessive winters in taking a mass of evidence from Indians and\r\nEuropeans all over India, but its sittings held, except in very rare\r\ncases, in public served chiefly at the time to stir up Indian opinion by\r\nbringing into sharp relief the profound divergencies between the Indian\r\nand the Anglo-Indian point of view, and in a form which on the one hand,\r\nunfortunately, was bound to offend Indian susceptibilities, and on the\r\nother hand was apt to produce the impression that Indians were chiefly\r\nconcerned to substitute an indigenous for an alien bureaucracy. Anyhow,\r\nwhile the Western-educated classes were rapidly coming to the conclusion\r\nthat the Minto-Morley reforms had given them the shadow rather than the\r\nsubstance of political power, they saw in the proceedings of the Public\r\nServices Commission little indication of any radical change in the\r\nattitude of the British official classes towards the question of\r\ntraining up the people of India to a larger share in the administration.\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances the Extremists saw their opportunity to pour\r\nridicule on the new Councils and preach once more the futility of\r\nconstitutional agitation. The Indian National Congress, overshadowed for\r\na time by the new Councils, began to recover its popularity, and though\r\nthe split which had taken place at Surat between Moderates and\r\nExtremists had not yet been mended, there was much talk of reunion. Some\r\nof the Moderates had grown once more faint-hearted. The Extremists who\r\nknew their own minds still constituted a very formidable party, and they\r\nwere finding new allies in an unexpected quarter.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indian National Congress was founded in 1885 and for nearly\r\nthirty years afterwards, the Indian Mahomedans kept severely aloof from\r\nit, partly because they had kept equally aloof from Western education\r\nwhich had originally brought the leaders of the new political movement\r\ntogether, and partly because most of those leaders were Hindus, and the\r\nancient antagonism between Mahomedans and Hindus led the former to\r\ndistrust profoundly anything that seemed likely to enhance the influence\r\nof the latter. One intellectual giant among the Mahomedans had indeed\r\narisen after the Mutiny, during which his loyalty had never wavered, who\r\nlaboured hard to convert his co-religionists to Western education. In\r\nspite of bitter opposition from a powerful party, rooted in the old\r\nfanatical orthodoxy of Islam, who resented his broad-mindedness which\r\nwent to the length of trying to explain, and even to explain away much\r\nof, the Koran, Sir Seyyid Ahmed Khan succeeded in founding at Aligurh in\r\n1880 a Mahomedan College which soon attracted students from the best\r\nMahomedan families all over India. His idea was to create there a centre\r\nwhich should do for young Mahomedans what he himself had watched Oxford\r\nand Cambridge doing for young Englishmen. Education was not to be\r\ndivorced as in most Indian colleges from religion, and he was convinced\r\nthat a liberal interpretation of the Mahomedan doctrine was no more\r\nincompatible with the essence of Islam than with that of Western\r\ncivilisation, with which British rule had come to bring India into\r\nprovidential contact. Loyalty to British rule was with him synonymous\r\nwith loyalty to all the high ideals which he himself pursued and set\r\nbefore his students. For a whole generation success appeared to crown\r\nthis work to which he brought all the fervour of missionary enterprise.\r\nHe died full of years and honour in 1898, and one of his last efforts\r\nwas an historical refutation of the Ottoman Sultan's claim to the\r\nKhalifate of Islam. He already realised the reactionary tendencies of\r\nthe Pan-Islamic propaganda which Abdul Hamid was trying to spread into\r\nIndia. So great and enduring was the hold of Sir Seyyid Ahmed's\r\nteachings upon the progressive elements in Mahomedan India that the\r\nAll-India Moslem League was founded in 1905, almost avowedly in\r\nopposition to the subversive activities which the Indian National\r\nCongress was beginning to develop. It was in this spirit, too, that the\r\ninfluential deputation headed by the Agha Khan, who, though himself the\r\nhead of a dissenting and thoroughly unorthodox Mahomedan community\r\nclaiming descent from the Old Man of the Mountain, was then the\r\nrecognised political leader of the whole Indian Mahomedan community,\r\nwaited on Lord Minto to press upon the Government of India the Mahomedan\r\nview of the political situation created by the Partition of Bengal, lest\r\npolitical concessions should be hastily made to the Hindus which would\r\npave the way for the ascendancy of a Hindu majority equally dangerous to\r\nthe stability of British rule and to the interests of the Mahomedan\r\nminority whose loyalty was beyond dispute. It was again in the same\r\nspirit, and fortified by the promise which Lord Minto had on that\r\noccasion given them, that they insisted, and insisted successfully, on\r\nthe principle of community representation being applied for their\r\nbenefit in the Indian Councils Act of 1909.\r\n\r\nA new generation of young Mahomedans had nevertheless been growing up\r\nwho knew not Seyyid Ahmed and regarded his teachings as obsolete. The\r\nlessons which they had learnt from their Western education were not his.\r\nThey were much more nearly those that the more ardent spirits amongst\r\nthe Hindus had imbibed, and they were ready to share with them the new\r\ncreed of Indian Nationalism in its most extreme form. Other\r\ncircumstances were tending to weaken the faith of the Mahomedan\r\ncommunity in the goodwill, not only of the Government of India, but of\r\nthe British Government. Even the most conservative Mahomedans were\r\ndisappointed and irritated by the revision of the Partition of Bengal in\r\n1911 when the predominantly Mahomedan Province of Eastern Bengal,\r\ncreated under Lord Curzon, was merged once more into a largely Hindu\r\nBengal. The more advanced Mahomedans had been stirred by the\r\nrevolutionary upheaval in Constantinople to seek contact with the\r\nTurkish Nationalist leaders who now ruled the one great Mahomedan power\r\nin the world, and they learnt from them to read into British foreign\r\npolicy a purpose of deliberate hostility to Islam itself inspired by\r\ndread of the renewed vitality it might derive from the returning\r\nconsciousness in many Mahomedan countries of their own independent\r\nnationhood. In that light they saw in the British occupation of Egypt,\r\nin the Anglo-French agreement with regard to Morocco and the\r\nAnglo-Russian agreement with regard to Persia, and last but not least,\r\nin the Italian invasion of Tripoli, the gradual development of a scheme\r\nin which all the powers of Christendom were involved for the extinction\r\nof the temporal power of Islam and, with it inevitably, according to\r\northodox doctrine, of its spiritual authority. The Ottoman Empire had\r\nbeen saved for a time by the protection extended to it for her own\r\npurposes by Germany who had alone stood between it and the\r\ndisintegrating machinations of the \"European Concert\" in\r\nConstantinople, bent on undermining the ascendancy of the ruling\r\nMahomedan race by its menacing insistence on reforms for the benefit of\r\nthe subject Christian races which could result only in the further\r\naggrandisement of the independent Christian states already carved out of\r\nthe Sultans' former dominions in Europe and in the introduction of\r\nsimilar processes even into their Asiatic dominions. The Balkan wars of\r\n1912-1913 appeared to bear out the theory of a great European conspiracy\r\ndirected against Turkey as \"the sword of Islam,\" and whilst the\r\nsympathies of Indian Mahomedans of all classes and schools of thought\r\nwere naturally enlisted in favour of their Turkish co-religionists, the\r\nleaders of the advanced Mahomedan party themselves went to\r\nConstantinople in charge of the Red Crescent funds collected in India\r\nand got into close personal touch with the Turkish Nationalists who\r\nruled in the name of the Sultan but derived their authority from the\r\n\"Committee of Union and Progress.\" The same party had in the meantime\r\ngone a long way towards capturing the All-India Moslem League and\r\nbringing it into line with the advanced wing of the Indian National\r\nCongress. The fusion between the League and the Congress, which was\r\nstill very repugnant both to the politically conservative and to the\r\nreligious orthodox majority of the Indian Mahomedan community, was not\r\ncompleted, nor was the reunion of the Moderate and Extremist parties\r\nwithin the Congress itself, when India was caught up with Great Britain\r\nand most of the nations of the world into the whirlpool of the Great War\r\non August 4, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE GREAT WAR TO THE GREAT INDIAN REFORM BILL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genuine outburst of enthusiasm with which India, whether under\r\ndirect British administration or under the autonomous rule of indigenous\r\ndynasties, responded to the call of the Empire at the beginning of the\r\nwar came almost as a revelation to the British public generally who knew\r\nlittle about India, and the impression deepened when during the critical\r\nwinter of 1914-1915 Indian troops stood shoulder to shoulder with\r\nBritish troops in the trenches to fill the gap which could not then have\r\nbeen filled from any other quarter. The loyalty displayed by the Indian\r\nprinces and the great land-owning gentry and the old fighting races who\r\nhad stood by the British for many generations was no surprise to\r\nEnglishmen who knew India; but less expected was the immediate rally to\r\nthe British cause of the new Western-educated classes who, baulked of\r\nthe political liberties which they regarded as their due, had seemed to\r\nbe drifting hopelessly into bitter antagonism to British rule--a rally\r\nwhich at first included even those who, like Mr. Tilak, just released\r\nfrom his long detention at Mandalay, had taught hatred and contempt of\r\nthe British rulers of India with a violence which implied, even when it\r\nwas not definitely expressed, a fierce desire to sever the British\r\nconnection altogether. In some cases the homage paid to the\r\nrighteousness of the British cause may not have been altogether genuine,\r\nbut with the great majority it sprang from one thought, well expressed\r\nby Sir Satyendra Sinha, one of the most gifted and patriotic of India's\r\nsons, in his presidential address to the Indian National Congress in\r\n1915, that, at that critical hour in the world's history, it was for\r\nIndia \"to prove to the great British nation her gratitude for peace and\r\nthe blessings of civilisation secured to her under its aegis for the\r\nlast hundred and fifty years and more.\" The tales of German\r\nfrightfulness and the guns of the _Emden_ bombarding Madras, which were\r\nan ominous reminder that a far worse fate than British rule might\r\nconceivably overtake India, helped to confirm Indians in the conviction\r\nthat the British Empire and India's connection with it were well worth\r\nfighting for. This was one of Germany's many miscalculations, and the\r\nloyalty of the Indian people quite as much as the watchfulness of\r\nGovernment defeated the few serious efforts made by the disaffected\r\nemissaries and agents in whom she had put her trust to raise the\r\nstandard of rebellion in India. All they could do was to feed the\r\n\"Indian Section\" of the Berlin Foreign Office with cock-and-bull stories\r\nof successful Indian mutinies and risings, which the German public,\r\nhowever gullible, ceased at last to swallow. Amongst the Indian\r\nMahomedans there was a small pro-Turkish group, chiefly of an Extremist\r\ncomplexion, whose appeals to the religious solidarity of Islam might\r\nhave proved troublesome when Turkey herself came into the war, had not\r\nGovernment deemed it advisable to put a stop to the mischievous\r\nactivities of the two chief firebrands, the brothers Mahomed Ali and\r\nShaukat Ali, by interning them under the discretionary powers conferred\r\nupon it by the Defence of India Act. Indian Mahomedan troops fought with\r\nthe same gallantry and determination against their Turkish\r\nco-religionists in Mesopotamia and Palestine as against the German enemy\r\nin France and in Africa, and the Mahomedan Punjab answered even more\r\nabundantly than any other province of India every successive call for\r\nfresh recruits to replenish and strengthen the forces of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe British Government and people responded generously to these splendid\r\ndemonstrations of India's fundamental loyalty to the British cause and\r\nthe British connection. The Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, declared with\r\nspecial emphasis that in future Indian questions must be approached from\r\n\"a new angle of vision,\" and Indians, not least the Western-educated\r\nclasses, construed his utterance into a pledge of the deepest\r\nsignificance. For two years India presented on everything that related\r\nto the war a front unbroken by any dissensions. The Imperial Legislative\r\nCouncil passed, almost without a murmur even at its most drastic\r\nprovisions, repugnant as they were to the more advanced Indian members,\r\na Defence of India Act on the lines of the Defence of the Realm Act at\r\nhome, when Lord Hardinge gave an assurance that it was essential to the\r\nproper performance of her part in the war, and it voted spontaneously\r\nand unanimously a contribution of one hundred million pounds by the\r\nIndian Exchequer to the war expenditure of the Empire. India had\r\nthrilled with pride when, at Lord Hardinge's instance, her troops were\r\nfirst sent, not to act as merely subsidiary forces in subsidiary\r\nwar-areas, but to share with British troops the very forefront of the\r\nbattle in France, and she thrilled again when an Indian prince, the\r\nMaharajah of Bikanir, and Sir Satyendra Sinha, who was once more playing\r\na conspicuous part in the political arena, and had been one of the\r\noldest and ablest members of the moderate Congress party, were sent to\r\nrepresent India at the first Imperial War Conference in London, and took\r\ntheir seats side by side with British Ministers and with the Ministers\r\nof the self-governing Dominions.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another side to the picture. If India had displayed\r\nin the best sense of the word an Imperial spirit and made sacrifices\r\nthat entitled her to be treated as a partner in, rather than a mere\r\ndependency of, the British Empire, was she still to be denied a large\r\ninstalment at least of the political liberties which had been long ago\r\nconferred on the self-governing Dominions? Were her people to be refused\r\nin the self-governing Dominions themselves the equality of treatment\r\nwhich her representatives were allowed to enjoy in the council-chamber\r\nof the Empire? Whilst the Morley-Minto reforms had disappointed the\r\npolitical expectations of the Western-educated classes, the measures\r\nadopted in several of the self-governing Dominions to exclude Indian\r\nimmigration, and, especially in South Africa, to place severe social and\r\nmunicipal disabilities on Indians already settled in some of the\r\nprovinces of the Union, had caused still more widespread resentment, and\r\nnothing did more to strengthen Lord Hardinge's hold upon Indian\r\naffection than his frank espousal of these Indian grievances, even at\r\nthe risk of placing himself in apparent opposition to the Imperial\r\nGovernment, who had to reckon with the sentiment of the Dominions as\r\nwell as with that of India. The war suddenly brought to the front in a\r\nnew shape the question of the constitutional relationship not only\r\nbetween Great Britain and India but between India and the other\r\ncomponent parts of the Empire. It was known in India that, before Lord\r\nHardinge reached the end of his term of office, extended for six months\r\ntill April 1916, he had been engaged in drafting a scheme of reform to\r\nmeet Indian political aspirations more fully than Lord Morley had done,\r\nand it was known also in India that schemes of Imperial reconstruction\r\nafter the war were already being discussed throughout the Empire. The\r\nIndian politician not unnaturally argued that if, as was generally\r\nconceded, the constitutional relations of the Government of India to the\r\nImperial Government were to be substantially modified and India to be\r\nadvanced to a position approximately similar to that of the\r\nself-governing Dominions whose governments were responsible to their own\r\npeoples, this could be done only by opening up to her too the road to\r\nself-government. The Extremist at once pressed the argument to its\r\nutmost consequences. The India for which he spoke was at that time, he\r\ndeclared, still willing to accept the British connection on the same\r\nterms as the Dominions, but she must be given Dominion Home Rule at\r\nonce--not merely as a goal to be slowly reached by carefully graduated\r\nstages, but as an immediate concession to Indian sentiment, already more\r\nthan due to her for her share in the defence of the Empire during the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislative Councils there had been a political truce by common\r\nconsent after the Government had undertaken to introduce no\r\ncontroversial measures whilst the war was going on. But the war dragged\r\non much longer than had been generally anticipated. India, to whom it\r\nbrought after the first few months an immense accession of material\r\nprosperity by creating a great demand for all her produce at rapidly\r\nenhanced prices, was so sheltered from its real horrors, and the number\r\nof Indians who had any personal ties with those actually fighting in far\r\noff-lands was after all so small in proportion to the vast population,\r\nthat the keen edge of interest in its progress was gradually blunted,\r\nand political speculations as to the position of India after the war\r\nwere unwittingly encouraged by the failure of Government to keep Indian\r\nopinion concentrated on the magnitude of the struggle which still\r\nthreatened the very existence of the Empire. Circumstances, for which\r\nthe British lack of imagination as well as the ponderous machinery of\r\nIndian administration was in some measure responsible, favoured, it must\r\nbe admitted, the revival of political agitation. Some three years\r\nelapsed after India was promised a \"new angle of vision\" before there\r\nwas evidence to the Indian eye that anything was being done to redeem\r\nthat promise. Lord Hardinge had taken home with him one scheme of\r\nreforms, and his successor, Lord Chelmsford, had set to work with his\r\nCouncil on another one as soon as he reached Simla. But time passed and\r\nall this travail bore no visible fruits. Outside events also gave rise\r\nto suspicion. The rejection by the House of Lords of the proposed\r\ncreation of an Executive Council for the United Provinces caused\r\nwidespread irritation amongst even moderate Indians, and the rumours of\r\na scheme to hasten on Imperial federation and to give the self-governing\r\nDominions some share in the control of Indian affairs aroused a very\r\nbitter feeling, as Indian opinion still smarted under the treatment of\r\nIndians in other parts of the Empire and remained distrustful of the\r\ntemporary compromise only recently arrived at. The Viceroy was very\r\nreserved and reticent, and his reserve and reticence were made the\r\npretext for assuming that, as he had been appointed under the first\r\nCoalition Government at home when Mr. Chamberlain succeeded Lord Crewe\r\nat the India Office, he was the reactionary nominee of a reactionary\r\nSecretary of State. No assumption could have been more unjust. Lord\r\nChelmsford's scheme was completed and sent home towards the end of 1916.\r\nBut nothing transpired as to its contents, nor as to any action being\r\ntaken upon it. Indians inferred that it was indefinitely pigeon-holed in\r\nWhitehall. The very reasonable plea that the Imperial Government, whose\r\nenergies had to be devoted to the life-and-death struggle in which the\r\nwhole Empire was involved, had little time to devote to a serious study\r\nof such problems as the introduction of grave constitutional changes in\r\nIndia, was countered by the argument that the same Imperial Government\r\nseemed to find no difficulty in sparing time for such measures as Irish\r\nHome Rule, votes for women, and a large extension of the franchise in\r\nthe United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe long delay, whatever its causes, perplexed and alarmed even moderate\r\nIndian opinion, which had lost the most popular of the leaders capable\r\nof guiding it, and waited in vain for any comforting assurances from\r\nresponsible official quarters. Moreover, it allowed the Extreme wing to\r\nset up a standard of political demands which it became more and more\r\ndifficult for any Indian to decline altogether to endorse without\r\nexposing himself to the reproach that he was unpatriotic and a creature\r\nof Government. As soon as it became known that Lord Chelmsford was\r\nengaged in elaborating a scheme of post-war reforms, nineteen Indian\r\nmembers of the Imperial Legislative Council hurriedly put forward a\r\ncounter scheme of their own, professedly for the better guidance of\r\nBritish Ministers. Besides pressing for various more or less practical\r\nreforms, such as the granting of commissions to Indians, the Nineteen\r\ndemanded full control for the Provincial Councils over the Executive\r\nsubject to a limited veto of the Governor of the Province; direct\r\nelection to those Councils--although nothing definite was said about the\r\nfranchise; and, in the Imperial Legislative Council, an unofficial\r\nmajority and control over the Central Government except in certain\r\nreserved matters. The scheme was hazy, bore evident marks of haste, and\r\naggravated immensely the dangers with which experience had already shown\r\nthe Morley-Minto reforms to be fraught. It was an attempt to make the\r\nCentral and Provincial Governments in India dependent upon the caprice\r\nof legislatures, with no mandate from any representative electorate and\r\nno training in responsible government, but completely immune to the\r\nconsequences of their own mistakes. It must have led to a hopeless\r\ndeadlock and the complete paralysis of Government, but even so it did\r\nnot satisfy the more fiery members of the Indian National Congress,\r\nwhere, in complete unison with the All-India Moslem League, finally\r\ncaptured by some slight concessions to Mahomedan sentiment, resolutions\r\nwere passed more crude and unworkable than the scheme of the Nineteen,\r\nand virtually amounting to Home Rule in its most impracticable shape.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was at last passing under Extremist control. Its first\r\nsession during the war was held in December 1914 in Bombay, and under\r\nthe presidency of Mr. Bupendranath Basu, afterwards a member of the\r\nSecretary of State's Council, the proceedings reflected the general\r\nenthusiasm with which India had rallied to the cause of the Empire. But\r\nbefore the Congress met again a disease common amongst Indians and\r\naggravated by overwork and anxiety had carried away in April 1915, still\r\nin the prime of life, the founder of the \"Servants of India Society,\"\r\nMr. Gokhale, himself perhaps the greatest servant of India that has\r\ntoiled in our time for her social as well as her political advancement.\r\nHis friends believed that in his case the end was precipitated by an\r\nacute controversy with Mr. Tilak, to whom he had made one last appeal to\r\nabandon his old attitude of irreconcilable opposition. A few months\r\nlater, in November, the veteran Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, who had fought\r\nstoutly ever since Surat against any Congress reunion, in which he\r\nclearly foresaw that the Moderates would be the dupes of the Extremists,\r\npassed away in his seventy-first year, but not before he had sent a\r\nmessage, worded in his old peremptory style, to Sir Satyendra Sinha,\r\ndaring him to refuse the chairmanship of the coming session which was to\r\nbe held in December in Bombay. Sir Satyendra came, and his great\r\npersonal influence kept the Indian National Congress on the rails, and\r\ndefeated the projects already on foot once more for delivering it into\r\nthe hands of Mr. Tilak and his followers. But the death of those two\r\npillars of the Moderate party at such a critical juncture proved to be\r\nan irreparable loss. When Mr. Gokhale's political testament was\r\npublished, it was dismissed by the Extremists as a well-meant but quite\r\nobsolete document. The Congress found a new and strange Egeria in Mrs.\r\nBesant, who had thrown herself into Indian politics when, owing to\r\ncircumstances[2] which had nothing to do with politics, the faith that\r\nmany respectable Hindus had placed in her, on the strength of her\r\ntheosophical teachings, as a vessel of spiritual election was rudely\r\nshaken. But nothing shook the mesmeric influence which she had acquired\r\nover young India by preaching with rare eloquence the moral and\r\nspiritual superiority of Indian over Western creeds, and condemning the\r\nBritish administration of India, root and branch, as one of the worst\r\nmanifestations of Western materialism. With her remarkable power of\r\nseizing the psychological moment, she had fastened on to the catchword\r\nof \"Home Rule for India,\" into which Indians could read whatever measure\r\nof reform they happened to favour, whilst it voiced the vague aspiration\r\nof India to be mistress in her own house, and to be freed from the\r\nreproach of \"dependency\" in any future scheme of reconstruction. She\r\nherself gave it the widest interpretation in _New India_, a newspaper\r\nwhose extreme views expressed in the most extreme form drew down upon\r\nher not only the action of Government but the censure of the High Court\r\nof Madras. At the Congress session held at Lucknow at the end of 1916\r\nshe shared the honours of a tremendous ovation with Tilak, whose\r\nsufferings--and her own--in the cause of India's freedom her newspaper\r\ncompared with those of Christ on the Cross. Resolutions were carried not\r\nonly requesting that the King Emperor might be pleased \"to issue a\r\nproclamation announcing that it is the aim and intention of British\r\npolicy to confer self-government on India at an early date,\" but setting\r\nforth in detail a series of preliminary reforms to be introduced\r\nforthwith in order to consummate the \"bloodless revolution\" which,\r\naccording to the President's closing oration, was already in full blast.\r\nThe All-India Moslem League sitting at the same time at Lucknow followed\r\nthe Congress lead.\r\n\r\nTo those feverish days at Lucknow the session of the Imperial\r\nLegislative Council held shortly afterwards at Delhi afforded a striking\r\ncontrast. The Great War was in its third year, and the end seemed as far\r\noff as ever. The Government of India announced the issue of an Indian\r\nWar Loan for £100,000,000 which was well received and speedily\r\nsubscribed, and, as an earnest of the revision of the whole fiscal\r\nrelations of the Empire after the war, an increase of the import duty on\r\ncotton fabrics, without the corresponding increase of the excise duty\r\nwhich had always been resented as an unjust protection of the Lancashire\r\nindustry, abated an Indian grievance of twenty years' standing. A\r\nDefence Force Bill opening up opportunities for Indians to volunteer and\r\nbe trained for active service responded in some measure to the agitation\r\nfor a national militia which the Congress had encouraged. The Viceroy\r\nalso announced that the system of indentured emigration to Fiji and the\r\nWest Indies against which Indian sentiment had begun to rebel was at an\r\nend, and that the problem of Indian education would be submitted to a\r\nstrong Commission appointed, with Sir Thomas Sadler at its head, to\r\ninquire in the first place into the position of the Calcutta University,\r\nand he warmly invited the co-operation of Indians of all parties with\r\nthe representative Committee under Sir Thomas Holland, then already\r\nengaged in quickening the development of Indian industries which, far\r\ntoo long neglected by successive governments, was at last receiving\r\nserious attention under the compelling pressure of a world-war.\r\nGovernment and Legislature met and parted on cordial terms. But Mrs.\r\nBesant never abated the vehemence of her Home Rule campaign, for only by\r\nHome Rule could India, she declared, \"be saved from ruin, from becoming\r\na nation of coolies for the enrichment of others.\" Access to some of the\r\nprovinces was denied to her by Provincial Governments, and the\r\nGovernment of Madras decided to \"intern\" her. The \"internment\" meant\r\nmerely that she transferred her residence and most of her activities\r\nfrom Madras to Ootacamund, the summer quarters of the Madras Government,\r\nwhere she hoisted the Home Rule flag on her house and continued to\r\ndirect the Home Rule movement as vigorously as ever. But in her own\r\nflamboyant language she described herself as having been \"drafted into\r\nthe modern equivalent for the Middle Ages _oubliette_,\" and even Indians\r\nwho were not wholly in sympathy with her views were aflame with\r\nindignation at her cruel \"martyrdom.\" The Government of India, whilst\r\nacquiescing in the action of the Provincial Governments, maintained an\r\nattitude of masterly inactivity, and neither in India nor at home was an\r\nauthoritative word forthcoming as to the birth of the reforms scheme\r\nknown to be in laborious gestation.\r\n\r\nThe political tension grew more and more acute. When would Simla or\r\nWhitehall break the prolonged silence? The publication of the\r\nMesopotamian Report only added fuel to the flames, as it was easy to\r\nread into it a condemnation of Indian administration only less sweeping,\r\nif expressed in a more restrained form, than that which Indians had for\r\nyears past poured forth upon it. There was no restraint at all in the\r\nfierce attack delivered upon it during the subsequent debate in the\r\nHouse of Commons by Lord Morley's former Under Secretary of State for\r\nIndia, Mr. Montagu. He had himself visited India and was personally\r\nknown there, and his speech, cabled out at once in full, produced a\r\ntremendous sensation, which was intensified when a few days later he was\r\nappointed Secretary of State for India in succession to Mr. Chamberlain.\r\nThere could be no doubt whatever as to the reality of the \"new angle of\r\nvision\" when on August 20 Mr. Montagu made in the House of Commons and\r\nLord Chelmsford in Simla a simultaneous announcement, as solemn in its\r\nform as it was far-reaching in its implications.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of British policy, it declared, was not only \"the increasing\r\nassociation of Indians in every branch of the administration, but also\r\nthe greatest development of self-governing institutions with a view to\r\nthe progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an\r\nintegral part of the British Empire.\"\r\n\r\nThis momentous announcement was accompanied, it is true, by a\r\nreservation to the effect \"that the British Government and the\r\nGovernment of India, on whom the responsibility lies for the welfare and\r\nadvancement of the Indian people, must be judges of the time and measure\r\nof each advance; and they must be guided by the co-operation received\r\nfrom those upon whom new opportunities of service will thus be\r\nconferred, and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can be\r\nreposed in their sense of responsibility.\" But it was made clear that\r\nthe declaration of policy was not meant to be a mere enunciation of\r\nprinciples, for it wound up with the statement that His Majesty's\r\nGovernment had \"decided that substantial steps in this direction should\r\nbe taken as soon as possible, and that it is of the highest importance\r\nthat there should be a free and informal exchange of opinion between\r\nthose in authority at home and in India.\" For that purpose Mr. Montagu\r\nhimself was authorised to proceed to India and confer with the Viceroy,\r\nin response to an invitation addressed originally to Mr. Chamberlain and\r\nextended after his resignation to his successor at the India Office.\r\n\r\nCould this great pronouncement have been made a year earlier, and with\r\nthe added authority of a Royal proclamation, it might have been received\r\nwith such widespread acclamation in India as to drown any but the\r\nshrillest notes of dissent from the irreconcilables. The Moderates\r\nhardly dared to admit that it fulfilled--nay, more than fulfilled--their\r\nhopes, whilst the Extremists in the Indian National Congress, presided\r\nover on this occasion by Mrs. Besant herself, banged, bolted, and barred\r\nthe door against any compromise by reaffirming and stiffening into\r\nsomething akin to an ultimatum the Home Rule resolutions of 1916 just at\r\nthe moment when Mr. Montagu was landing in India. But the Secretary of\r\nState was not the man to be perturbed by such demonstrations. He had the\r\nBritish politician's faith in compromise, and he did not perhaps\r\nunderstand fully that Indian Extremism represents a very different\r\nquality of opposition from any that a British Minister has yet had to\r\nreckon with in Parliament. He saw Indians of all classes and creeds and\r\npolitical parties during his tour through India, but on none did he\r\nlavish more time and more patient hearing than upon the Extremists whom\r\nhe hoped against hope to convert. He had an easier task when he tried\r\nto disarm the resentment which his vigorous onslaught on the methods and\r\ntemper of British administration just before he took office had aroused\r\namongst the European members of the public services. He conferred with\r\ngovernors and with heads of departments, and with representatives of the\r\nEuropean community. He received endless deputations and masses of\r\naddresses, and he remained of course in close consultation with the\r\nViceroy in accordance with the declared object of his mission. After\r\nfour strenuous months Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford signed at Simla on\r\nApril 22, 1918, a joint report which was laid before Parliament in July.\r\n\r\nGreat as had always been the responsibilities of the Secretary of State\r\nand the Viceroy for the government of India \"as by law established,\"\r\nthey were on this occasion vastly greater. For two men of widely\r\ndifferent temperaments had to work out together a scheme for shifting\r\nthe very axis of government. They rose to the occasion. The\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford Report will rank with the great State papers which\r\nare landmarks of constitutional progress in the history of the British\r\nEmpire. It falls naturally and logically into two parts, the first\r\nsetting forth the conditions of the problem, the second the\r\nrecommendations for its solution; and even if the second had not\r\nprovided the foundations for the Act of 1919, the first would have\r\ndeserved to live as a masterly survey of the state of India--the first\r\nauthoritative one since the transfer to the Crown just sixty years\r\nbefore. For the first time since the Mutiny it marked a reversion to the\r\nspirit in which the Bentincks and Munros and Elphinstones had almost a\r\ncentury earlier conceived the mission of England in India to lie in the\r\ntraining of the Indian people to govern themselves, and for the first\r\ntime an attempt was made to appraise generously but fairly the position\r\nof the Western-educated classes and the part they have come to play in\r\nthe Indian polity. The passage is worth quoting in full, as the\r\nconstitutional changes effected on the lines recommended by the Report\r\nwere to give them the opportunity to prove the stuff they were made of\r\nas the political leaders of their country.\r\n\r\n     In estimating the politically-minded portion of the people of India\r\n     we should not go either to census reports on the one hand, or to\r\n     political literature on the other. It is one of the most difficult\r\n     portions of our task to see them in their right relation to the\r\n     rest of the country. Our obligations to them are plain, for they\r\n     are intellectually our children. They have imbibed ideas which we\r\n     ourselves have set before them, and we ought to reckon it to their\r\n     credit. The present intellectual and moral stir in India is no\r\n     reproach but rather a tribute to our work. The _Raj_ would have\r\n     been a mechanical and iron thing if the spirit of India had not\r\n     responded to it. We must remember, too, that the educated Indian\r\n     has come to the front by hard work; he has seized the education\r\n     which we offered him because he first saw its advantages; and it is\r\n     he who has advocated and worked for political progress. All this\r\n     stands to his credit. For thirty years he has developed in his\r\n     Congress, and latterly in the Moslem League, free popular\r\n     convocations which express his ideals. We owe him sympathy because\r\n     he has conceived and pursued the idea of managing his own affairs,\r\n     an aim which no Englishman can fail to respect. He has made a\r\n     skilful, and on the whole a moderate, use of the opportunities\r\n     which we have given him in the legislative councils of influencing\r\n     Government and affecting the course of public business, and of\r\n     recent years he has by speeches and in the press done much to\r\n     spread the idea of a united and self-respecting India among\r\n     thousands who had no such conception in their minds. Helped by the\r\n     inability of the other classes in India to play a prominent part he\r\n     has assumed the place of leader; but his authority is by no means\r\n     universally acknowledged and may in an emergency prove weak.\r\n\r\n     The prospects of advance very greatly depend upon how far the\r\n     educated Indian is in sympathy with and capable of fairly\r\n     representing the illiterate masses. The old assumption that the\r\n     interests of the ryot must be confided to official hands is\r\n     strenuously denied by modern educated Indians. They claim that the\r\n     European official must by his lack of imagination and comparative\r\n     lack of skill in tongues be gravely handicapped in interpreting the\r\n     thoughts and desires of an Asiatic people. On the other hand, it is\r\n     argued that in the limited spread of education, the endurance of\r\n     caste exclusiveness and of usages sanctioned by caste, and in the\r\n     records of some local bodies and councils, may be found reasons\r\n     which suggest that the politically-minded classes stand somewhat\r\n     apart from and in advance of the ordinary life of the country. Nor\r\n     would it be surprising if this were the case. Our educational\r\n     policy in the past aimed at satisfying the few who sought after\r\n     English education, without sufficient thought of the consequences\r\n     which might ensue from not taking care to extend instruction to the\r\n     many. We have in fact created a limited _intelligentsia_, who\r\n     desire advance; and we cannot stay their progress entirely until\r\n     education has been extended to the masses. It has been made a\r\n     reproach to the educated classes that they have followed too\r\n     exclusively after one or two pursuits, the law, journalism, or\r\n     school teaching; and that these are all callings which make men\r\n     inclined to overrate the importance of words and phrases. But even\r\n     if there is substance in the count, we must take note also how far\r\n     the past policy of Government is responsible. We have not succeeded\r\n     in making education practical. It is only now, when the war has\r\n     revealed the importance of industry, that we have deliberately set\r\n     about encouraging Indians to undertake the creation of wealth by\r\n     industrial enterprise, and have thereby offered the educated\r\n     classes any tangible inducement to overcome their traditional\r\n     inclination to look down on practical forms of energy. We must\r\n     admit that the educated Indian is a creation peculiarly of our own;\r\n     and if we take the credit that is due to us for his strong points\r\n     we must admit a similar liability for his weak ones. Let us note\r\n     also in justice to him that the progressive Indian appears to\r\n     realise the narrow basis of his position and is beginning to\r\n     broaden it. In municipal and university work he has taken a useful\r\n     and creditable share. We find him organising effort not for\r\n     political ends alone, but for various forms of public and social\r\n     service. He has come forward and done valuable work in relieving\r\n     famine and distress by floods, in keeping order at fairs, in\r\n     helping pilgrims, and in promoting co-operative credit. Although\r\n     his ventures in the fields of commerce have not been always\r\n     fortunate, he is beginning to turn his attention more to the\r\n     improvement of agriculture and industry. Above all, he is active in\r\n     promoting education and sanitation; and every increase in the\r\n     number of educated people adds to his influence and authority.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Report were at the same time by no means unmindful of\r\nEngland's responsibilities towards the vast masses still quite content\r\nto accept the system of government which she had given them, and who\r\nlooked with undiminished faith to their British administrators for the\r\ncontinuance of the peace and security and even-handed justice which they\r\nhad seldom if ever enjoyed in the same measure under their indigenous\r\nrulers. The problem to be solved was \"one of political education which\r\nmust be practical and also experimental.\" The politically-minded classes\r\nhad to be given an opportunity of learning how to govern and administer;\r\nand the other classes, which have hitherto accepted unquestioningly the\r\ngovernment and administration given to them, had to be taught to\r\nexercise the critical rights of intelligent citizenship. A sphere had to\r\nbe found in which Indians could be given work to do, and be held\r\naccountable to their own people for the way they did it. That sphere had\r\nto be circumscribed at first so as not to endanger the foundations of\r\nGovernment, and yet capable of steady expansion if and in proportion as\r\nthe experiment succeeds, until the process of political education should\r\nbe complete and Indians should have shown themselves qualified for the\r\nsame measure of self-government as the Dominions already enjoy within\r\nthe British Empire.\r\n\r\nFrom a careful examination of the existing structure of Government and\r\nan exhaustive review of present conditions in India, the\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford Report deduced two definite conclusions:\r\n\r\n(1) It is on the Central Government, _i.e._ the Government of India,\r\nthat the whole structure rests; and the foundations must not be\r\ndisturbed pending experience of the changes to be introduced into less\r\nvital parts. The Government of India must therefore remain wholly\r\nresponsible to Parliament, and, saving such responsibility, its\r\nauthority in essential matters must during the initial stages of the\r\nexperiment remain indisputable.\r\n\r\n(2) While popular control can be at once largely extended in the domain\r\nof local government, the Provinces provide the sphere in which the\r\nearlier steps towards the development of representative institutions and\r\nthe progressive realisation of responsible government promised in the\r\nDeclaration of August 20, 1917, can be most usefully and safely taken.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the second part of the Report was devoted to working out in\r\nconsiderable detail a practical scheme for giving effect to those two\r\nconclusions. The powers and responsibilities of the Government of India\r\nas the Central Government were left intact, but an All-Indian\r\nlegislature consisting of two assemblies, the one as popular and\r\ndemocratic as a large elective majority proceeding from the broadest\r\npracticable franchise could make it--to be called the Indian Legislative\r\nAssembly--and the other a relatively small upper chamber to be known as\r\nthe Council of State which, composed partly of elected members and\r\npartly of members nominated by Government or entitled _ex officio_ to\r\nmembership, was expected to provide the desired counterpoise of approved\r\nexperience and enlightened conservatism. The Report expressed the pious\r\nhope that \"inasmuch as the Council of State will be the supreme\r\nlegislative authority for India on all crucial questions and the\r\nrevising authority for all Indian legislation,\" it would \"attract the\r\nservices of the best men available,\" and \"develop something of the\r\nexperience and dignity of a body of Elder Statesmen\"--an expression\r\npresumably borrowed, but not very aptly, from Japan, where the Elder\r\nStatesmen have no doubt had immense influence but never any\r\nconstitutional status. The Report had, moreover, to contemplate the\r\npossibility of conflict between the Legislature and the Executive, and\r\nin accordance with the first of the two main conclusions at which it had\r\narrived it proposed to arm the Governor-General in Council with power to\r\noverride the Legislature if it failed to pass measures or grant supplies\r\nwhich he was prepared to \"certify\" as vital to the peace, safety, and\r\ninterests of India.\r\n\r\nFor the great experiment in the provincial sphere, the eight provinces\r\nof Bombay, Madras, Bengal, the United Provinces, Behar and Orissa, the\r\nPunjab, the Central Provinces, and Assam, were deemed to be already\r\nripe. Burma (which is not really India at all, and whose people belong\r\nto another race and to another stage of political development), the\r\nNorth-West Frontier Province, and Baluchistan (which for strategical\r\nreasons must remain under the direct control of the Government of\r\nIndia), and a few smaller areas, whose populations are altogether too\r\nbackward, were not to be touched at present. The essential feature of\r\nthe scheme was the division of the functions of the Provincial\r\nGovernment into two categories: the one comprising what are now termed\r\n\"the reserved subjects,\" _i.e._ those with which the maintenance of\r\npeace and order and good government is immediately bound up; and the\r\nother, those which, though less vital, very closely affect the daily\r\nlife and common interests of the people, and which were to be called\r\n\"the transferred subjects,\" because it was proposed to transfer at once\r\nthe largest possible measure of power and responsibility in regard to\r\nthem to exclusively Indian shoulders. While all essential power and\r\nresponsibility in regard to \"the reserved subjects\" were to remain\r\nvested in the Governor-in-Council, _i.e._ the executive body consisting\r\nof the Governor and (under the new scheme) one British and one Indian\r\nmember of Council, real power and responsibility for dealing with \"the\r\ntransferred subjects\" were to be conferred on Indian Ministers\r\naccountable to a Legislative Council in which there was to be a large\r\nIndian non-official majority, elected also on the broadest possible\r\nfranchise. The Provincial Government would thus itself be divided into\r\ntwo compartments: in the one the Governor-in-Council, responsible as\r\nheretofore to the Government of India and to the Secretary of State,\r\n_i.e._ the British Parliament; in the other the Governor--but not \"in\r\nCouncil\"--acting with Indian Ministers responsible to an Indian\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThis was the system of partial but progressive devolution that had\r\nalready come to be known as \"Dyarchy,\" having been propounded in a\r\nsomewhat different form by an independent inquirer, Mr. Lionel Curtis,\r\nwhose \"Letters to the People of India\" on responsible Government, though\r\nthey at first caused almost as much displeasure in official as in\r\nExtremist circles, did a great deal to educate the mind of the\r\n\"politically-minded\" classes, and to prepare the ground for the\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford Report. The authors of the Report were themselves\r\nfully alive to the demerits as well as to the merits of dyarchy, and\r\nthey were careful to state it as their intention that \"the Government\r\nthus composed and with this distribution of functions shall discharge\r\nthem as one Government, and that as a general rule it shall deliberate\r\nas a whole.\" The Governor-in-Council was to have, on the other hand,\r\nwithin his narrower sphere, powers similar to those retained by the\r\nViceroy for overriding the Provincial Legislature in extreme cases of\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nGeneral principles were alone laid down in the Report, and its authors\r\nconfined themselves to a rough preliminary indication of their views, as\r\nto the distribution of \"reserved\" and \"transferred\" subjects in the\r\nProvinces and as to the constitution of electorates. The latter problem\r\nthey stated in brief terms: \"We must measure the number of persons who\r\ncan in the different parts of the country be reasonably entrusted with\r\nthe duties of citizenship. We must ascertain what sort of franchise will\r\nbe suited to local conditions, and how interests that may be unable to\r\nfind adequate representation in such constituencies are to be\r\nrepresented.\" But it was perhaps Mr. Montagu's doctrinaire Radicalism\r\nthat betrayed itself in the treatment of the question of \"communal\"\r\nrepresentation, _i.e._ the creation of separate constituencies for\r\nvarious communities, which, however important or however much entitled\r\nto make their voices heard, might be submerged in constituencies based\r\nsolely on territorial representation. \"Communal representation\" had been\r\nconceded to so powerful a minority as the Mahomedans under the Indian\r\nCouncils Act of 1909; and the Report admitted that it could not be\r\nwithdrawn from them, and that it might have to be conceded to other\r\ncommunities, such as the Sikhs. At the same time it developed at great\r\nlength all the theoretical arguments against the principle, viz. that it\r\nis opposed to history, that it perpetuates class division, that it\r\nstereotypes existing relations based on traditions and prejudices which\r\nwe should do everything to discourage.\r\n\r\nAt the risk even of travelling somewhat beyond the expressed terms of\r\ntheir reference, the Secretary of State and the Viceroy could not but\r\nrecognise that the effects of great constitutional reforms, of which the\r\nstatutory application would be necessarily confined to that part of\r\nIndia that is under direct British administration, must nevertheless\r\nreact upon that other smaller but still very considerable part of India\r\nwhich enjoys more or less complete internal autonomy under its own\r\nhereditary rulers. A growing number of questions, and especially\r\neconomic questions, must arise in future, which will affect the\r\ninterests of the Native States as directly as those of the rest of\r\nIndia; and their rulers may legitimately claim, as the Report plainly\r\nadmitted, to have constitutional opportunities of expressing their views\r\nand wishes and of conferring with one another and with the Government of\r\nIndia. For such purposes the Report included suggestions which were to\r\ntake shape in the establishment of the Chamber of Princes.\r\n\r\nOne other recommendation of the Report deserves special notice, as it\r\nshows the authors to have realised how seriously Parliament, though more\r\ndirectly responsible than ever for the exercise of due vigilance over\r\nIndian affairs after the transfer to the Crown, had lost touch with\r\nthem, since, with the disappearance of the East India Company after the\r\nMutiny, it ceased to hold the regular and exhaustive inquiries which the\r\nrenewal of the Charter had until then periodically required. As their\r\nown scheme was designed merely to give Parliament a lead in the first of\r\na progressive series of constitutional reforms, they recommended that a\r\nParliamentary Commission of Inquiry into the working of the new Indian\r\ninstitutions and the general progress of the people of India should at\r\nstated intervals determine the further stages of advance towards the\r\nfinal goal of self-government. Such a Commission, armed with power to\r\nexamine witnesses, would not only enlighten British public opinion, but\r\nalso probe Indian opinion in a much more searching way than can be done\r\nby impassioned and irresponsible arguments and counter-arguments in the\r\npress and on platforms. It would, above all, assist Parliament to master\r\nfrom time to time the many-sided problem whose progressive solution it\r\nwould have constantly to watch and periodically to determine.\r\n\r\nThe Report was a document of such magnitude and complexity, and went so\r\nboldly to the roots of Indian government and administration, that even\r\namongst the absorbing preoccupations of the war, which was only just\r\nemerging for the Allies from the terrible crisis of March-April 1918,\r\nits publication at once provoked a considerable stream of criticism. On\r\nthe whole, British public opinion was favourable, though there was a\r\nsmall but not uninfluential group of British reactionaries who at once\r\ntook up, and have ever since maintained, the position that the Report\r\nmeant, not the mending, for which they saw, moreover, very little need,\r\nbut the ending of British rule in India. Equal divergencies occurred in\r\nIndian public opinion. An Extremist gathering in Madras declared roundly\r\nthat \"the scheme is so radically wrong in principle and in detail that\r\nin our opinion it is impossible to modify or improve it.\" In vain had\r\nMrs. Besant been released from her modern _oubliette_ before Mr. Montagu\r\nstarted for India. \"The scheme,\" she wrote in her haste, on the very day\r\nof its publication, \"is unworthy to be offered by England or to be\r\naccepted by India.\" In vain had Mr. Montagu allowed himself to be\r\ngarlanded by Mr. Tilak, who was not far behind Mrs. Besant in\r\npronouncing the scheme to be \"entirely unacceptable.\" The Calcutta\r\nProvincial Conference of the Congress party held a few days later\r\nabounded in the same sense, and a special session of the whole Congress\r\nconvoked in August in Bombay was only in form somewhat less bitterly\r\nuncompromising, and only because it began to realise that the secession\r\nof the more moderate elements was likely to reduce \"the Parliament of\r\nIndia\" to a mere rump. Moderate opinion had not committed itself to\r\nacceptance of the scheme as precipitately as the Extremists to its\r\nrejection, but against rejection pure and simple it set its face at\r\nonce, and it rallied so steadily and surely to acceptance that few of\r\nthe Moderates attended the Provincial Congress, where they were promptly\r\nhowled down, and they determined to hold a Conference of their own in\r\nopposition to the special Congress session. At this Conference, as well\r\nas in the Committee of non-official members of the Indian Legislative\r\nCouncil, there was a good deal of disjointed criticism of various\r\nrecommendations in the Report, not infrequently due to misunderstanding\r\nof their import, but on the whole it was recognised as representing a\r\ngreat triumph for the cause of political progress on constitutional\r\nlines and therefore for the educated opinion of India. The breach\r\nbetween the Extremists and the Moderates was clearly defined by Mr. B.L.\r\nMitter, a prominent Moderate of Calcutta and a member of the new\r\nModerate organisation, the \"National Liberal League\":\r\n\r\n     The Extremists would have nothing to do with the English in the\r\n     Government or outside; the Moderates consider co-operation with the\r\n     English necessary for national development, political, industrial,\r\n     economic, and otherwise. The Extremists would straightway assume\r\n     full responsibility of Government; the Moderates think that would\r\n     lead to chaos, and would proceed by stages. It is the difference\r\n     between cataclysm and evolution. The Extremists' ideal is\r\n     destruction of the existing order of things in the hope that\r\n     something better will take its place, for nothing can be worse than\r\n     what is; the Moderates' ideal is formation of a new order of things\r\n     on definite progressive lines. One is chance, the other is design.\r\n     The primary difference (so far as methods are concerned) is that\r\n     the Extremists' method is not necessarily constitutional; the\r\n     Moderates' method always constitutional. Some Extremists use\r\n     violence, others work secretly and spread discontent and\r\n     disaffection. Others again, pretending to follow legitimate methods\r\n     of agitation, take care not to discourage unconstitutional methods\r\n     or even crimes, nay, they miss no opportunity to applaud criminals\r\n     as martyrs. There are others, again, who merely idealise and are\r\n     content with rousing the passions of the people. Intrigue and abuse\r\n     are the general weapons in the Extremists' armoury. The Moderates\r\n     always act openly and with dignity, and follow lawful methods of\r\n     agitation. The Extremists always oppose the Government. The\r\n     Moderates co-operate with authority, and oppose when necessary in\r\n     the interests of the country. Lastly, the Extremists appeal only to\r\n     the passions of the people; the Moderates appeal to their reason.\r\n\r\nLater developments in India itself were unfortunately to play once more\r\ninto the hands of the Extremists, and the leadership was to pass from\r\nMr. Tilak, who was growing old and died in the summer of 1920, and from\r\nMrs. Besant too, who, after being bitterly reviled by her former ally,\r\nat last saw the error of her ways and finally went over to the Moderate\r\ncamp with the diminishing remnants of her influence, into the hands of a\r\nnew and strange figure in Indian politics, Mr. Gandhi, endowed with very\r\ndifferent qualities and greater spiritual influence than either of them.\r\n\r\nBut before bringing him on to the stage it may be well to follow the\r\nprogress of Indian reforms at home after the publication of the\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford Report. It had been laid before Parliament without\r\nany _imprimatur_ from the Cabinet, and some months passed before, with\r\nthe conclusion of the war, His Majesty's Government found leisure to\r\ngive it their collective consideration. Not till June 1919 was Mr.\r\nMontagu in a position to move in the House of Commons the second reading\r\nof the great Bill drafted with their authority to give effect in all\r\nessentials to the recommendations of the Report. His powerful and lucid\r\nexposition of its provisions and of the whole situation with which\r\nEngland was confronted in India made a deep impression on the House,\r\nthough it by no means disarmed opposition, and the Bill was remitted for\r\nconsideration to a Joint Select Committee of both Houses which, chosen\r\nimpartially from all parties, proceeded to take a large mass of evidence\r\nfrom British and Indian witnesses of every political complexion, and\r\ndelivered a very weighty report in November. The views of the Government\r\nof India and of the Provincial Governments, by no means always in accord\r\namongst themselves, had also been before the Committee, as well as those\r\nof the members of the Secretary of State's Council. But the alternative\r\nproposals submitted were either impracticable or ineffective, and the\r\nBill which, in so far as it was modified in accordance with its\r\nrecommendations, assumed an even more liberal character. Mr. Montagu's\r\nhands were thus strengthened for the final debates in the House of\r\nCommons in which the opposition proved sterile in argument and weak in\r\nnumbers, and the Bill was passed through both Houses of Parliament in\r\ntime for the constitutional assent of the Crown to be given to it and\r\nfor the King-Emperor to address a solemn proclamation to the Viceroy,\r\nPrinces, and people of India on the eminently appropriate date of\r\nChristmas Eve 1920. This Royal message of peace and goodwill set forth\r\nin simple language both the purposes and the genesis of the Act:\r\n\r\n     I have watched with understanding and sympathy the growing desire\r\n     of my Indian people for representative institutions. Starting from\r\n     small beginnings, this ambition has steadily strengthened its hold\r\n     upon the intelligence of the country. It has pursued its course\r\n     along constitutional channels with sincerity and courage. It has\r\n     survived the discredit which at times and in places lawless men\r\n     sought to cast upon it by acts of violence committed under the\r\n     guise of patriotism. It has been stirred to more vigorous life by\r\n     the ideals for which the British Commonwealth fought in the Great\r\n     War, and it claims support in the part which India has taken in our\r\n     common struggles, anxieties, and victories.\r\n\r\n     In truth, the desire after political responsibility has its source\r\n     at the root of the British connection with India. It has sprung\r\n     inevitably from the deeper and wider studies of human thought and\r\n     history which that connection has opened to the Indian people.\r\n     Without it the work of the British in India would have been\r\n     incomplete. It was, therefore, with a wise judgment that the\r\n     beginnings of representative institutions were laid many years ago.\r\n     Their scope has been extended stage by stage until there now lies\r\n     before us a definite step on the road to responsible government.\r\n\r\nThe Act, which implemented all the principal recommendations of the\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford Report, superseded within little more than fifty\r\nyears the Government of India Act of 1858, under which the Crown first\r\nassumed direct responsibility for the government and administration of\r\nIndia. The Royal message certainly did not exaggerate its significance.\r\nIts actual provisions are indeed of less moment than its larger\r\nimplications and the spirit in which it will be interpreted and carried\r\ninto effect. For the right spirit to crown the new Constitution with\r\nsuccess we must look to Indians and British alike, not forgetting that\r\nthe changes introduced into the structure of Indian government and\r\nadministration are themselves only ancillary to the still more important\r\nchanges which must result from the recognition of Indian public opinion\r\nas a powerful and ultimately paramount influence in the shaping of\r\npolicy. Such recognition must follow not only from the creation of\r\nIndian representative Assemblies with a large majority of Indian elected\r\nmembers but from the appointment of Indians, three in number already in\r\nthe Government of India, three in the Secretary of State's Council in\r\nWhitehall, and in varying numbers both as Ministers and members of the\r\nExecutive Councils in Provincial Governments. Side by side with this\r\nprogressive Indianisation of the Executive of which we are witnessing\r\nonly the first stage, the Indianisation of the administrative\r\ndepartments and of the public services, and not least of the Indian\r\nCivil Service, is bound to proceed with increasing rapidity. Indians can\r\nhardly fail to realise that, perhaps for a long time to come, they will\r\nrequire the experience and driving power of Englishmen, but they will\r\ninevitably claim increasing control over policy, now formally conceded\r\nto them in a large Provincial sphere, until it shall have extended in\r\nsuccessive stages to the whole sphere of Provincial Government and\r\nultimately to the Central Government itself. Then, and then only, India\r\nwill actually emerge into complete Dominion Self-Government. But we\r\nshall do well to remember, and Indians will certainly not allow us to\r\nforget, that the terms of equality, on which her representatives are now\r\nadmitted to the innermost counsels of the Empire, have already in many\r\nrespects outstripped the Act of 1919.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] _The Evolution of Mrs. Besant_, by the Editor of _Justice_,\r\nMadras, _Justice_ Printing Works, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE EMERGENCE OF MR. GANDHI\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore this great statute could be brought into operation, and even\r\nwhilst Parliament was still laboriously evolving it, a strange and\r\nincalculable figure was coming to the forefront in India, who, favoured\r\nby an extraordinary combination of untoward circumstances, was to rally\r\nround him some of the most and many of the least reputable forces which,\r\nsometimes under new disguises, the old and passive civilisation of India\r\nis instinctively driven to oppose to the disintegrating impact upon it\r\nof the active and disturbing energies of Western civilisation. Saint and\r\nprophet in the eyes of the multitude of his followers--saint in the eyes\r\neven of many who have not accepted him as a prophet--Mr. Gandhi preaches\r\nto-day under the uninspiring name of \"Non-co-operation,\" a gospel of\r\nrevolt none the less formidable because it is so far mainly a gospel of\r\nnegation and retrogression, of destruction not construction. Mr. Gandhi\r\nchallenges not only the material but the moral foundations of British\r\nrule. He has passed judgment upon both British rule and Western\r\ncivilisation, and, condemning both as \"Satanic,\" his cry is away with\r\nthe one and with the other, and \"back to the Vedas,\" the fountain source\r\nof ancient Hinduism. That he is a power in the land none can deny, least\r\nof all since the new Viceroy, Lord Reading, almost immediately on his\r\narrival in India, spent long hours in close conference with him at\r\nSimla. What manner of man is Mr. Gandhi, whom Indians revere as a\r\nMahatma, _i.e._ an inspired sage upon whom the wisdom of the ancient\r\nRishis has descended? What is the secret of his power?\r\n\r\nBorn in 1869 in a Gujarat district in the north of the Bombay\r\nPresidency, Mohandas Karamchamd Gandhi comes of very respectable Hindu\r\nparentage, but does not belong to one of the higher castes. His father,\r\nlike others of his forebears, was Dewan, or chief administrator, of one\r\nof the small native States of Kathiawar. He himself was brought up for\r\nthe Bar and, after receiving the usual English education in India,\r\ncompleted his studies in England, first as an undergraduate of the\r\nLondon University and then at the Inner Temple. His friend and\r\nbiographer, Mr. H.S.L. Polak, tells us that his mother, whose religious\r\nexample and influence made a lasting impression upon his character, held\r\nthe most orthodox Hindu views, and only agreed to his crossing \"the\r\nBlack Water\" to England after exacting from him a three-fold vow, which\r\nhe faithfully kept, of abstinence from flesh, alcohol, and women. He\r\nreturned to India as soon as he had been called to the Bar and began to\r\npractise as an advocate before the Bombay High Court, but in 1893, as\r\nfate would have it, he was to be called to South Africa in connection\r\nwith an Indian legal case in Natal. In South Africa he was brought at\r\nonce into contact with a bitter conflict of rights between the European\r\npopulation and the Indian settlers who had originally been induced to go\r\nout and work there at the instance of the white communities who were in\r\nneed of cheap labour for the development of the country. The Europeans,\r\nprofessing to fear the effects of a large admixture of Asiatic elements,\r\nhad begun not only to restrict further Indian immigration, but to place\r\nthe Indians already in South Africa under many disabilities all the more\r\noppressive because imposed on racial grounds. Natal treated them\r\nharshly, but scarcely as harshly as the Transvaal, then still under Boer\r\ngovernment. In the Transvaal the Imperial Government took up the cudgels\r\nfor them, and the treatment of the Indian settlers there was one of the\r\ngrievances pressed by Lord Milner during the negotiations which preceded\r\nthe final rupture with the Boer Republics. When the South African war\r\nbroke out Mr. Gandhi believed that it would lead to a generous\r\nrecognition of the rights of Indians if they at once identified their\r\ncause with that of the British, and he induced Government to accept his\r\noffer of an Indian Ambulance Corps which did excellent service in the\r\nfield. Mr. Gandhi himself served with it, was mentioned in despatches,\r\nand received the war medal. His health gave way, and he returned to\r\nIndia in 1901 where he resumed practice in Bombay with no intention of\r\nreturning to South Africa, as he felt confident that when the war was\r\nover the Imperial Government would see to it that the Indians should\r\nhave the benefit of the principles which it had itself proclaimed before\r\ngoing into the war. He was, however, induced to return in 1903 to help\r\nin preparing the Indian memorials to be laid before Mr. Chamberlain\r\nwhose visit was imminent in connection with the work of reconstruction.\r\nOn his arrival he found that conditions and European opinion were\r\nbecoming more instead of less unfavourable for Indians, and though in\r\n1906, when the native rebellion broke out in Natal, he again offered and\r\nsecured the acceptance of an Indian Stretcher-Bearer Corps with which he\r\nagain served and received the thanks of the Governor, he gradually found\r\nhimself driven into an attitude of more and more open opposition and\r\neven conflict with Government by a series of measures imposing more and\r\nmore intolerable restraints upon his countrymen. It was in 1906 that he\r\nfirst took a vow of passive resistance to a law which he regarded as a\r\ndeliberate attack upon their religion, their national honour, and their\r\nracial self-respect. In the following year he was consigned, not for the\r\nfirst time, to jail in Pretoria, but his indomitable attitude helped to\r\nbring about a compromise. It was, however, short-lived, as\r\nmisunderstandings occurred as to its interpretation. The struggle broke\r\nout afresh until another provisional settlement promised to lead to a\r\npermanent solution, when Mr. Gokhale, after consultation with the India\r\nOffice during a visit to England, was induced in 1912 to proceed to\r\nSouth Africa and use his good offices in a cause which he had long had\r\nat heart. Whether, as Mr. Gokhale himself always contended, as a\r\ndeliberate breach of the promise made to him by the principal Union\r\nMinisters, or as the result of a lamentable misunderstanding, measures\r\nwere again taken in 1913 which led Mr. Gandhi to renew the struggle, and\r\nit assumed at once a far more serious character than ever before. It was\r\nthen that Mr. Gandhi organised his big strikes of Indian labour and\r\nheaded the great strikers' march of protest into the Transvaal which led\r\nto the arrest and imprisonment of the principal leaders and of hundreds\r\nof the rank and file. The furious indignation aroused in India, the\r\npublic meetings held in all the large centres, and the protest entered\r\nby the Viceroy himself, Lord Hardinge, in his speech at Madras, combined\r\nwith earnest representations from Whitehall, compelled General Smuts to\r\nenter once more the path of conciliation and compromise. As the result\r\nof a Commission of Inquiry the Indians' Relief Act was passed, and in\r\nthe correspondence between Mr. Gandhi and General Smuts the latter\r\nundertook on behalf of the South African Government to carry through\r\nother administrative reforms not actually specified in the new Act. Mr.\r\nGandhi returned to India just after the outbreak of the Great War, and\r\nthe Government of India marked its appreciation of the great services\r\nwhich he had rendered to his countrymen in South Africa by recommending\r\nhim for the Kaisar-i-Hind gold medal, which was conferred upon him\r\namongst the New Year honours of 1915.\r\n\r\nThe South African stage of Mr. Gandhi's career is of great importance,\r\nas it goes far to explain both the views and the methods which he\r\nafterwards applied in India. He brought back with him from South Africa\r\na profound distrust of Western civilisation, of which he had\r\nunquestionably witnessed there some of the worst aspects, and also a\r\nstrong belief in the efficacy of passive resistance as the most peaceful\r\nmeans of securing the redress of all Indian grievances in India as well\r\nas in South Africa should they ever become in his opinion unendurable.\r\nMr. Gokhale, before he died, obtained a promise from him that for at\r\nleast a year he would not attempt to give practical expression to the\r\nextreme views which he had already set forth in the proscribed pamphlet\r\n_Hind Swaraj_. At an early age Mr. Gandhi had fallen under the spell of\r\nTolstoian philosophy, and he has admitted only quite recently that for a\r\ntime he was so much impressed with the doctrines of Christ that he was\r\ninclined to adopt Christianity; but the further study of the spiritual\r\nside of Hinduism convinced him that in it alone the key of salvation\r\ncould be found, and all his teachings since then have been based on his\r\nfaith in the superiority of the Indian civilisation rooted in Hinduism\r\nto Western civilisation, which for him in fact represents in its present\r\nstage only a triumph of gross materialism and brute force. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen the Great War broke out, he was prepared to believe that the ordeal\r\nof war in the cause of freedom for which Britain had taken up arms might\r\nlead to the redemption of Western civilisation from its worst evils, and\r\nwhilst in London on his way to South Africa he had already offered to\r\nform, and to enrol himself and his wife in, an Indian Volunteer\r\nAmbulance Corps. Yet he was not blind to the flaws of the civilisation\r\nfor which he stood. He conducted a temperance campaign amongst his\r\ncountrymen in South Africa, and, brought there into close contact with\r\nmany Indians of the \"untouchable\" castes, he revolted against a system\r\nwhich tried to erect such insurmountable barriers between man and man.\r\nPerhaps the best clue to the many contradictions in which his activities\r\nhave continually seemed to involve him was furnished by himself when he\r\nsaid, \"Most religious men I have met are politicians in disguise; I,\r\nhowever, who wear the guise of a politician am at heart a religious\r\nman,\" and the doctrine which he holds of all others to be the\r\ncorner-stone of his religion is that of _Ahimsa_, which, as he has\r\ndescribed it, \"requires deliberate self-suffering, not the deliberate\r\ninjuring of the wrongdoer,\" in the resistance of evil.\r\n\r\nThroughout the war Mr. Gandhi devoted his ceaseless energies chiefly to\r\npreaching social reforms and the moral regeneration of his countrymen.\r\nHe was then an honoured guest at European gatherings, as for instance at\r\nthe Madras Law dinner in 1915, at various conferences on education, at\r\nthe Bombay Provincial Co-operative Conference in 1917 when in connection\r\nwith the admirable Co-operative Credit movement in India he lectured on\r\nthe moral basis of co-operation, at missionary meetings in which he\r\nshowed his intimate familiarity with the gospels by reverently quoting\r\nChrist's words in support of his own plea for mutual forbearance and\r\ntolerance. As late as July 1918 he defined _Swaraj_ as partnership in\r\nthe Empire, and war service as the easiest and straightest way to win\r\n_Swaraj_, inviting the people of his own Gujarat country whom he was\r\naddressing to wipe it free of the reproach of effeminacy by contributing\r\nthousands of Sepoys in response to the Viceroy's recent appeal for fresh\r\nrecruits for the Indian army at one of the most critical moments during\r\nthe war. His comments about the same time on the Montagu-Chelmsford\r\nscheme were by no means unfavourable, and he specifically joined in the\r\ntribute of praise bestowed upon the Indian Civil Service for their\r\nsteadfast devotion to duty and great organising ability. Government\r\nitself resorted to his services as the member of a Commission appointed\r\nto inquire into agrarian troubles at Camparan, and his collaboration was\r\nwarmly welcomed by his European colleagues. Nor were there any signs of\r\nimplacable hostility to British rule in his vigorous protests in the\r\nfollowing year against the anti-Asiatic legislation of the South\r\nAfrican Union which was again stirring up bad feeling in India.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which drove him to declare war against British rule\r\nand Western civilisation arose out of the action taken by Government on\r\nthe report of the \"Sedition Committee,\" which, under the presidency of\r\nMr. Justice Rowlatt, a judge of the High Court of King's Bench, sent out\r\nespecially to preside over it, had not only carefully explored the\r\norigins and growth of political crime during the great wave of unrest\r\nafter the Partition of Bengal, but recommended that in some directions\r\nthe hands of the executive and judicial authorities should be\r\nstrengthened to cope with any fresh outbreaks of a similar character.\r\nThe Committee pointed out that in spite of the preventive legislation of\r\n1911 it had become apparent before the war broke out that the forces of\r\nlaw and order were still inadequately equipped to cope with the\r\nsituation in Bengal. For the duration of the war the Defence of India\r\nAct had conferred upon Government emergency powers which had enabled the\r\nauthorities summarily to intern a large number of those who were known\r\nto be closely connected with the criminal propaganda, but almost as soon\r\nas the war was over their release would follow automatically upon the\r\nexpiry of the Defence Act, and a dangerous situation would arise again\r\nif Government had nothing but the old methods of procedure to fall back\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nIn January 1919 the Government of India announced that legislation in\r\nconformity with the recommendations of the Sedition Committee would be\r\nrequired from the Imperial Legislative Council, and two draft bills were\r\npublished, one of them embodying permanent alterations in the law and\r\nthe other arming the Executive with emergency powers. The publication of\r\nthese bills threw the country into a fresh ferment of agitation, and\r\neven an Indian judge of undeniably moderate views, Sir Narain\r\nChandavarkar, declared that such measures were no longer required, as\r\nwith the advent of constitutional reforms revolutionary agitation\r\nwould, he believed, cease, and, as a warm supporter of the\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford Report, he felt bound to protest against legislation\r\nso entirely at variance with the spirit in which the Report had been\r\nconceived and with the expectations which it had aroused. The Extremists\r\nread into the bills another proof of the organised hypocrisy\r\ncharacteristic of British rule in general and of the Report in\r\nparticular, and denounced them as a monstrous engine of tyranny and\r\noppression, against which no Indian would be safe. Government, however,\r\nwas not to be moved from its determination, and in explaining the\r\nnecessity for proceeding with the bills the Viceroy pointed out in his\r\nopening speech that \"the reaction against all authority that had\r\nmanifested itself in many parts of the civilised world was unlikely to\r\nleave India entirely untouched and the powers of evil were still\r\nabroad.\" The Indian non-official members, on the other hand, were solid\r\nin opposition, and even those who did not challenge the report of the\r\nSedition Committee intimated that now the war was over they could not\r\nacquiesce in such measures until the reforms had come into operation,\r\nand unless it was then found that revolutionary forces were still at\r\nwork and constituted a real public danger. The two amendments, supported\r\nby all the Indian non-official members, were voted down by the official\r\n_bloc_. Government did something to allay opposition by agreeing that\r\nthe Act which was to have been permanent should operate for three years\r\nonly, and the title of the bill was amended to show clearly that its\r\napplication would be confined to clearly anarchical and revolutionary\r\ncrimes. It was further modified in form in the committee stage, but the\r\nopposition within the Council remained unmoved, and outside the Council\r\ngrew more and more fierce. The Extremists who had shrunk from no efforts\r\nto misrepresent the purpose of the bills received a great accession of\r\nstrength when Mr. Gandhi instituted the vow of _Satyagraha_, or passive\r\nresistance, under which, if the bills became law, he and his followers\r\nwould \"severally refuse to obey these laws and such other laws as a\r\ncommittee to be thereafter appointed might see fit,\" whilst they would\r\n\"faithfully follow the truth and refrain from violence to life, person,\r\nor property.\" The Moderate leaders at Delhi at once issued a manifesto\r\ncondemning _Satyagraha_, but Government stuck to its guns, the bills\r\nbeing finally passed on March 18, after very hot discussion. Mr. Gandhi,\r\nhaving formed his committee, proclaimed a _Hartal_, _i.e._ a\r\ndemonstrative closing of shops and suspension of business for March 30.\r\nThis _Hartal_ at Delhi started a terrible outbreak which spread with\r\nunexpected violence over parts of the Bombay Presidency and the greater\r\npart of the Punjab, with sporadic disturbances in the North-West\r\nFrontier Province, and even in Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThe Delhi _Hartal_ brought for the first time into full relief the close\r\nalliance into which the Mahomedan Extremists had been brought with the\r\nHindu Extremists, as well as the influence which both had acquired over\r\na considerable section of the lower classes in the two communities. The\r\npolitical leaders had fallen into line in the Indian National Congress\r\nand the All-India Moslem League during the 1916 and 1917 sessions, when\r\nthey united in demanding Home Rule for India, and they had united since\r\nthen in rejecting as totally inadequate the scheme of reforms\r\nforeshadowed in the Montagu-Chelmsford Report. But not till towards the\r\nconclusion of the war did the Mahomedan Extremists discover a special\r\ngrievance for their own community in the peace terms likely to be\r\nimposed upon a beaten Turkey. That was a grievance far more likely to\r\nappeal to their co-religionists than the political grievances which had\r\nformed the stock-in-trade of Hindu Extremism, if they could be worked\r\nupon to believe that Great Britain and her allies were plotting not\r\nmerely against the temporal power of the Ottoman Empire, but against the\r\nMahomedan religion all over the world by depriving the Sultan of Turkey\r\nof the authority essential to the discharge of his office as Khalif or\r\nspiritual head of Islam.\r\n\r\nThe agitation was at first very artificial, for the bulk of Indian\r\nMahomedans had until recent years known very little about and taken\r\nstill less interest in Turkey, and their loyalty had never wavered\r\nduring the war. Some of the leading Indian Mahomedans had indeed openly\r\ndisputed Sultan Abdul Hamid's claim to the Khalifate of Islam when he\r\nfirst tried at the end of the last century to import his Pan-Islamic\r\npropaganda into India. But the long delay on the part of the Allies in\r\nformulating their Turkish peace terms allowed time for the movement to\r\ngrow and to carry with it the more fanatical element amongst Indian\r\nMahomedans. The Government of India tried in vain to allay Mahomedan\r\nfeeling by receiving deputations from the _Khilafat_ Association founded\r\nto prosecute an intensified campaign in favour of Turkey, and professing\r\nits own deep anxiety to procure what it called \"a just peace with\r\nTurkey,\" for which the Indian delegates to the War and to the Peace\r\nConferences in Europe had been constantly instructed to plead. The\r\ngreatest success which the _Khilafat_ agitators achieved was when Mr.\r\nGandhi allowed himself to be persuaded by them that the movement was a\r\nsplendid manifestation of religious faith, as he himself described it to\r\nme. For, once satisfied that the cause which they had taken up was a\r\nreligious cause, he was prepared to make it his own without inquiring\r\ntoo closely into its historical or political justification. For him it\r\nbecame a revolt of the Mahomedan religious conscience against the\r\ntyranny of the West just as legitimate as the revolt of the Hindu\r\nconscience against the same tyranny embodied in the Rowlatt Acts. Whilst\r\nMahomedans proved their emancipation from narrow sectarianism by joining\r\nin the _Satyagraha_ movement of passive resistance in spite of the Hindu\r\ncharacter impressed upon it by its Sanscrit name, it was, he declared,\r\nfor Hindus to show that they, too, could rise above ancient prejudice\r\nand resentment by throwing themselves heart and soul into the _Khilafat_\r\nmovement. Both movements were to be demonstrations of the \"soul-force\"\r\nof India, to be put forth in passive resistance according to his\r\nfavourite doctrine of _Ahimsa_, the endurance and not the infliction of\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Gandhi, with all his visionary idealism, was letting loose\r\ndangerous forces which recked naught of _Ahimsa_. Hindus and Mahomedans\r\n\"fraternised\" at the Delhi _Hartal_ in attempts to compel its observance\r\nby violence which obliged the authorities to use forcible methods of\r\nrepression, and of the five rioters who were killed two were Mahomedans.\r\nThese deaths were skilfully exploited by the Extremists of both\r\ndenominations, and a day of general mourning for the Delhi \"martyrs\" was\r\nappointed. The spark had been laid to the train, and Hindus and\r\nMahomedans continued to \"fraternise\" in lawlessness, arson, and murder\r\nwherever the mob ran riot. Systematic attempts to destroy railways and\r\ntelegraphs at the same moment in widely separated areas pointed to the\r\nexistence of a carefully elaborated organisation. Public buildings as\r\nwell as European houses were burnt down in half a dozen places, and\r\nEuropeans were often savagely attacked and done to death, nowhere more\r\nsavagely than at Amritsar, where five Europeans, two of them Bank\r\nmanagers, were killed with the most fiendish brutality, and a missionary\r\nlady, known for her good works, barely escaped with her life. The\r\nauthorities were not slow to take stern measures. Troops were rapidly\r\nmoved to the centres of disturbance, flying columns were sent through\r\nthe country, and armoured cars and trains and aeroplanes were used to\r\ndisperse the rioters. A Resolution issued by the Government of India on\r\nApril 14 asserted its determination to use all the powers vested in it\r\nto put down \"open rebellion\" even by the most drastic means. By the end\r\nof the month the Viceroy was able to announce that order had been\r\ngenerally restored, though in some places there was still considerable\r\neffervescence.\r\n\r\nHad the measures taken, however stern, been confined to the repression\r\nof actual violence and to the punishment of the guilty, the reaction\r\nproduced amongst the great majority of Indians by the atrocities which\r\nIndian mobs had committed, and the appalling spirit of lawlessness which\r\ninspired them, would probably have been at least as great as the\r\nimpression which they at first made upon Mr. Gandhi himself, who\r\nsuddenly recognised and admitted that he had underrated the \"forces of\r\nevil\" and advised his disciples to co-operate, as he himself had done at\r\nAhmedabad, with Government in the restoration of order. The _Satyagraha_\r\nCommittee, of which he was President, resolved to suspend temporarily\r\n\"civil disobedience\" to the laws, and the fraternisation between\r\nMahomedans and Hindus cooled down, when important Mahomedan associations\r\nbegan to protest against the desecration of mosques by the admission of\r\nHindu \"idolaters\" to deliver fiery orations to mixed congregations\r\nwithin the sacred precincts. But before the reaction could take real\r\neffect, it was arrested by rumours of terrible happenings in the course\r\nof the repression in the Punjab which turned the tide of Indian feeling\r\ninto an opposite direction, and for those rumours there ultimately\r\nproved to have been no slight foundation.\r\n\r\nThe methods adopted in the Punjab had been very different from those\r\nadopted in the Bombay Presidency, where there had been scarcely less\r\nmenacing outbursts in some of the northern districts, besides serious\r\nrioting in Bombay itself. In Ahmedabad, the second city of the\r\nPresidency, mob law reigned for two days. There were arson and pillage,\r\nand murder of Europeans and Government officers. Troops had to be\r\nhurried up to quell the disturbances, and for a short time the military\r\nauthorities had to take charge. The repression was stern; 28 of the\r\nrioters were killed and 123 wounded in Ahmedabad alone. There were many\r\narrests and prosecutions. But those stormy days left no bitterness\r\nbehind them. The use of military force was not resented, because it was\r\ndirected only against the crowds actually engaged in violent rioting.\r\nMartial law was never proclaimed, nor did the military authorities\r\nprolong the exercise of their punitive powers beyond the short period of\r\nactive disorder, nor strain it beyond the measures essential to the\r\nsuppression of disorder. They never interfered in administrative\r\nmatters. The Bombay Government kept their heads, and there was nowhere\r\nany wholesale surrender of the civil authority into military hands. Mr.\r\nGandhi, who had been turned back by the Punjab Government when he tried\r\nto enter the Punjab, was left free by the Bombay Government, and the\r\nvalue of his assistance in restoring order in Allahabad, whilst he was\r\nin his first fit of penitence, was acknowledged by the authorities.\r\n\r\nVery different was the intensive enforcement of martial law in the\r\nPunjab. Even when all allowance is made for the more dangerous situation\r\ncreated by a more martial population and the proximity of an always\r\nturbulent North-Western Frontier with the added menace at that time of\r\nan Afghan invasion, nothing can justify what was done at Amritsar where\r\nthe deliberate bloodshed at Jallianwala has marked out April 13, 1919,\r\nas a black day in the annals of British India. One cannot possibly\r\nrealise the frightfulness of it until one has actually looked down on\r\nthe Jallianwala Bagh--once a garden, but in modern times a waste space\r\nfrequently used for fairs and public meetings, about the size perhaps of\r\nTrafalgar Square, and closed in almost entirely by walls above which\r\nrise the backs of native houses facing into the congested streets of the\r\ncity. I entered by the same narrow lane by which General Dyer--having\r\nheard that a large crowd had assembled there, many doubtless in\r\ndefiance, but many also in ignorance of his proclamation forbidding all\r\npublic gatherings--entered with about fifty rifles. I stood on the same\r\nrising ground on which he stood when, without a word of warning, he\r\nopened fire at about 100 yards' range upon a dense crowd, collected\r\nmainly in the lower and more distant part of the enclosure around a\r\nplatform from which speeches were being delivered. The crowd was\r\nestimated by him at 6000, by others at 10,000 and more, but practically\r\nunarmed, and all quite defenceless. The panic-stricken multitude broke\r\nat once, but for ten consecutive minutes he kept up a merciless\r\nfusillade--in all 1650 rounds--on that seething mass of humanity, caught\r\nlike rats in a trap, vainly rushing for the few narrow exits or lying\r\nflat on the ground to escape the rain of bullets, which he personally\r\ndirected to the points where the crowd was thickest. The \"targets,\" to\r\nuse his own word, were good, and when at the end of those ten minutes,\r\nhaving almost exhausted his ammunition, he marched his men off by the\r\nway they came, he had killed, according to the official figures only\r\nwrung out of Government months later, 379, and he left about 1200\r\nwounded on the ground, for whom, again to use his own word, he did not\r\nconsider it his \"job\" to take the slightest thought.\r\n\r\nIn going to Jallianwala I had passed through the streets where, on April\r\n10, when the disorders suddenly broke out in Amritsar, the worst\r\nexcesses were committed by the Indian rioters. But for General Dyer's\r\nown statements before the Hunter Commission, one might have pleaded\r\nthat, left to his own unbalanced judgment by the precipitate abdication\r\nof the civil authority, he simply \"saw red,\" though the outbreak of the\r\n10th had been quelled before he arrived in Amritsar, and the city had\r\nbeen free from actual violence for the best part of three days. But, on\r\nhis own showing, he deliberately made up his mind whilst marching his\r\nmen to Jallianwala, and would not have flinched from still greater\r\nslaughter if the narrowness of the approaches had not compelled him\r\nregretfully to leave his machine-guns behind. His purpose, he declared,\r\nwas to \"strike terror into the whole of the Punjab.\" He may have\r\nachieved it for the time, though the evidence on this point is\r\nconflicting, but what he achieved far more permanently and effectively\r\nwas to create in the Jallianwala Bagh, purchased since then as a\r\n\"Martyrs' Memorial\" by the Indian National Congress, a place of\r\nperpetual pilgrimage for racial hatred.\r\n\r\nThen, two days after--not before--Jallianwala came the formal\r\nproclamation of martial law in the Punjab, and though there were no more\r\nJallianwalas, what but racial hatred could result from a constant stream\r\nof petty and vindictive measures enforced even after the danger of\r\nrebellion, however real it may at first have seemed, had passed away?\r\nSir Michael O'Dwyer protested, it is true, against General Dyer's\r\nmonstrous \"crawling order,\" and it was promptly disallowed. But what of\r\nmany other \"orders\" which were not disallowed? What of the promiscuous\r\nfloggings and whippings, the indiscriminate arrests and confiscations,\r\nthe so-called \"fancy punishments\" designed not so much to punish\r\nindividual \"rebels\" as to terrorise and humiliate? What of the whole\r\njudicial or _quasi_-judicial administration of martial law? The\r\nessential facts are on record now in the Report of the Hunter Committee\r\nand in the evidence taken before it, though its findings were not\r\nentirely unanimous and the majority report of the European members, five\r\nin number including the president Lord Hunter, formerly\r\nSolicitor-General for Scotland, was accompanied by a minority report\r\nsigned by the three Indian members, two of them now Ministers in the\r\nGovernment of Bombay and of the United Provinces respectively, who on\r\nseveral points attached graver importance to the circumstances which\r\nthey themselves had chiefly helped to elicit from witnesses under\r\nexamination. Upon the Report the Government of India and His Majesty's\r\nGovernment expressed in turn their views in despatches which are also\r\npublic property. The responsibility of the Government of India was so\r\ndeeply involved, and in a lesser degree that of the Secretary of State,\r\nthat in neither case was judgment likely to err on the side of severity.\r\nThe Government of India certainly did not so err, and one must turn to\r\nthe despatch embodying the views of the British Government for a\r\nconsidered judgment which at least set forth in weighty terms the\r\nprinciples of British policy that had been violated in the Punjab,\r\nhowever short some may consider it to have fallen of the full\r\nrequirements of justice in appraising the gravity of the departure from\r\nthose principles in specific cases.\r\n\r\nThe Punjab tragedy has had such far-reaching effects in shaking the\r\nconfidence of the Indian people in the justice and even in the humanity\r\nof British rule that it is best to quote the language in which the\r\nBritish Government recorded their judgment in their despatch to the\r\nGovernment of India:\r\n\r\n     The principle which has consistently governed the policy of His\r\n     Majesty's Government in directing the methods to be employed, when\r\n     military action in support of civil authority is required, may be\r\n     broadly stated as using the minimum force necessary. His Majesty's\r\n     Government are determined that this principle shall remain the\r\n     primary factor of policy whenever circumstances unfortunately\r\n     necessitate the suppression of civil disorder by military force\r\n     within the British Empire.\r\n\r\n     It must regretfully but without possibility of doubt be concluded\r\n     that Brigadier-General Dyer's action at Jallianwala Bagh was in\r\n     complete violation of this principle.\r\n\r\nThe despatch proceeded to take into account the provocation offered and\r\nthe great difficulties of the position in which General Dyer was placed.\r\nHis omission to give warning before opening fire was nevertheless\r\ndeclared to have been \"inexcusable,\" his failure to see that some\r\nattempt was made to give medical assistance to the dying and the wounded\r\nan \"omission from his obvious duty,\" and the \"crawling order\" issued by\r\nhim six days later \"an offence against every canon of civilised\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\n     Upon a military commander administering martial law in a hostile\r\n     country there lies a grave responsibility; when he is compelled to\r\n     exercise this responsibility over a population which owes\r\n     allegiance and looks for protection to the Government which he\r\n     himself is serving, this burden is immeasurably enhanced. It would\r\n     prejudice the public safety, with the preservation of which he is\r\n     charged, to fetter his free judgment or action either by the\r\n     prescription of rigid rules before the event or by over-censorious\r\n     criticism when the crisis is past. A situation which is essentially\r\n     military must be dealt with in the light of military considerations\r\n     which postulate breadth of view and due appreciation of all the\r\n     possible contingencies. There are certain standards of conduct\r\n     which no civilised Government can with impunity neglect and which\r\n     His Majesty's Government are determined to uphold.... That\r\n     Brigadier-General Dyer displayed honesty of purpose and unflinching\r\n     adherence to his conception of his duty cannot for a moment be\r\n     questioned. But his conception of his duty in the circumstances in\r\n     which he was placed was so fundamentally at variance with that\r\n     which His Majesty's Government have a right to expect from and a\r\n     duty to enforce upon officers who hold His Majesty's commission\r\n     that it is impossible to regard him as fitted to remain entrusted\r\n     with the responsibilities which his rank and position impose upon\r\n     him. You have reported to me that the Commander-in-Chief has\r\n     directed Brigadier-General Dyer to resign his appointment as\r\n     Brigade Commander, and has informed him that he would receive no\r\n     further employment in India and that you have concurred. I approve\r\n     the decision and the circumstances of the case have been referred\r\n     to the Army Council.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the administration of martial law the despatch considers\r\nit\r\n\r\n     impossible to avoid the conclusion that the majority of Lord\r\n     Hunter's Committee have failed to express themselves in terms\r\n     which, unfortunately, the facts not only justify, but necessitate.\r\n     In paragraphs 16 to 25 of chapter xii. of their report the majority\r\n     have dealt with the \"intensive\" form generally which martial law\r\n     assumed and with certain specific instances of undue severity and\r\n     of improper punishments or orders. It is unnecessary to\r\n     recapitulate the instances which the Committee have enumerated in\r\n     detail in both their reports, nor would any useful purpose be\r\n     served by attempting to assess, with a view to penalties, the\r\n     culpability of individual officers who were responsible for these\r\n     orders, but whose conduct in other respects may have been free from\r\n     blame or actually commendable. But His Majesty's Government must\r\n     express strong disapproval of these orders and punishments and ask\r\n     me to leave to you the duty of seeing that this disapproval shall\r\n     be unmistakably marked by censure or other action which seems to\r\n     you necessary upon those who were responsible for them. The\r\n     instances cited by the Committee gave justifiable ground for the\r\n     assertion that the administration of martial law in the Punjab was\r\n     marred by a spirit which prompted--not generally, but unfortunately\r\n     not uncommonly--the enforcement of punishments and orders\r\n     calculated, if not intended to humiliate Indians as a race, to\r\n     cause unwarranted inconvenience amounting on occasions to\r\n     injustice, and to flout the standards of propriety and humanity,\r\n     which the inhabitants not only of India in particular but of the\r\n     civilised world in general have a right to demand of those set in\r\n     authority over them. It is a matter for regret that,\r\n     notwithstanding the conduct of the majority, there should have been\r\n     some officers in the Punjab who appear to have overlooked the fact\r\n     that they were administering martial law, not in order to subdue\r\n     the population of a hostile country temporarily occupied as an act\r\n     of war, but in order to deal promptly with those who had disturbed\r\n     the peace of a population owing allegiance to the King Emperor, and\r\n     in the main profoundly loyal to that allegiance.\r\n\r\nThis clear enunciation of bed-rock principles and emphatic condemnation\r\nof many of the methods of repression used in the Punjab would have done\r\nmore to reassure the public mind in India had the actual punishment\r\ninflicted on General Dyer and a few others been more commensurate with\r\nthe gravity of the censure passed on their actions, and in any case it\r\ncame far too late. It came too late to stem the rising tide of Indian\r\nbitterness, intensified by many gross exaggerations and deliberate\r\ninventions, which lost all sense of proportion when the Extremists\r\ndemanded Sir Michael O'Dwyer's impeachment, though many responsible\r\nIndians had expressed their unabated confidence in him before he left\r\nthe Punjab on the expiry of his term of office, just after the troubles,\r\nin terms more unstinted even than those in which the Government of India\r\nand the British Government conveyed their appreciation of his long and\r\ndistinguished services--services which assuredly no errors of judgment\r\ncommitted under great stress could be allowed to overshadow. It came\r\ntoo late also to correct the effects of the panic that had taken\r\npossession of the European mind when it was still largely in ignorance\r\nof the actual facts. For most Europeans had at once rushed to the\r\nconclusion that the outbreak in the Punjab, in which no single Sepoy\r\never took part, was or threatened to be a reproduction of the Mutiny. In\r\nthe first days, as a measure of precaution, European women and children\r\nhad been hurriedly collected into places of refuge lest the horrible\r\nexcesses perpetrated by the Indian mob at Amritsar might prove the\r\nprelude to a repetition of Cawnpore. The hardships and anxiety they\r\nunderwent and the murderous outrages actually committed on not a few\r\nEuropeans moved most of their fellow countrymen and countrywomen to\r\nunmeasured resentment, and not until they gained at last a fuller\r\nknowledge of all the facts so long allowed to remain obscure did a\r\ngradual reaction set in against the belief which was genuinely\r\nentertained by most Europeans, non-official and official in India, and\r\nwhich spread from them to England, that General Dyer's action and the\r\nrigours of martial law alone \"saved India.\"\r\n\r\nWhat drove the iron into the soul of India more than the things actually\r\ndone in the Punjab, for which many Indians admit the provocation, was\r\nthe reluctance of her rulers to look them in the face, and the tardiness\r\nand half-heartedness of the atonement made for them. Not till nearly\r\nhalf a year after the troubles had occurred did the Government of India\r\nannounce the appointment of the Hunter Committee of Inquiry, and this\r\nannouncement was coupled with the introduction of a Bill of Indemnity\r\nfor all officers of Government engaged in their repression, which wore,\r\nin the eyes of Indians, however unreasonably, the appearance of an\r\nattempt to shelter them against the possible findings of the Committee.\r\nAgain nearly half a year passed before the report of the Committee was\r\nmade public, and the bloom had already been taken off it for most\r\nIndians by the report of a Commission instituted on its own account by\r\nthe Indian National Congress which, partisan and lurid as it was, never\r\nreceived full refutation, as the witnesses upon whose evidence it was\r\nbased were, for technical reasons, not heard by the Hunter Committee.\r\nThe complete surrender of civil authority into military hands first at\r\nAmritsar, and then, under orders from Simla, at Lahore and elsewhere,\r\nwas, as His Majesty's Government afterwards acknowledged, a disastrous\r\ndeparture from the best traditions of the Indian Civil Service. But,\r\nwhatever the mistakes committed by the civil authority in the Punjab or\r\nby those charged with the administration of martial law in that\r\nprovince, there is above the Punjab the Government of India, and its\r\nplea of prolonged ignorance as to the details of the occurrences in the\r\nPunjab can hardly hold water. The preoccupations of the Afghan war which\r\nfollowed closely on the Punjab troubles were no doubt absorbing, but had\r\nthe Viceroy or the Home member or the Commander-in-Chief or one of his\r\nresponsible advisers proceeded in person, the moment the disorders were\r\nover, to Lahore or Amritsar, barely more than a night's journey from\r\nDelhi or Simla, is it conceivable that a halt would not have been\r\nforthwith called to proceedings which these high officers of state were\r\nconstrained later on unanimously to deplore and reprobate? And if the\r\nGovernment of India were too slow to move, was there not a Secretary of\r\nState who knew, from statements made to him personally by Sir Michael\r\nO'Dwyer on his return to England, at least enough to insist upon\r\nimmediate inquiry on the spot? Mr. Montagu has seldom, it is believed,\r\nhesitated to require in the most peremptory terms full information on\r\nfar more trivial matters. Had prompt action been taken in India, there\r\nwould never have been any need for the Hunter Committee. As it was,\r\nIndian feeling had run tremendously high before its findings were made\r\npublic. So when the Government of India and the Secretary of State\r\npublished their belated judgment, the people of India weighed such a\r\ntardy measure of justice against the dissent of an important minority in\r\nthe House of Commons and of the majority of the Lords, the stifling of\r\ndiscussion in the Indian Legislature, which was still more directly\r\ninterested in the matter, and above all the unprecedented public\r\nsubscriptions in England and in India for the glorification of General\r\nDyer, whilst the Punjab Government was still haggling over doles to the\r\nwidows and orphans of Jallianwala--and, having weighed it, found it\r\nlamentably wanting, until at last the Duke of Connaught's moving speech\r\nat Delhi for the first time began to redress the balance.\r\n\r\nThe story of Jallianwala and all that followed in the Punjab scattered\r\nto the winds Mr. Gandhi's threadbare penitence for the horrible violence\r\nof Indian mobs, and he poured out henceforth all the vials of his wrath\r\non the violence of the repression, far more unpardonable, he declared,\r\nbecause they were not the outcome of ignorant fanaticism, but of a\r\ndefinite policy adopted by European officers high in rank and\r\nresponsibility. There was no longer any doubt in his mind that a\r\nGovernment that tolerated or condoned or palliated such things was\r\n\"Satanic,\" and that the whole civilisation for which such a Government\r\nstood was equally Satanic. For Indians to co-operate with it until it\r\nhad shown \"a complete change of heart\" was a deadly sin. To accept any\r\nscheme of constitutional reforms as reparation for the wrongs of the\r\nPunjab with which the wrongs of Turkey were linked up with an increased\r\nfervour of righteous indignation when the terms of the treaty of Sèvres\r\nbecame known, was treachery to the soul of India. Thence it was but a\r\nstep to the organisation of a definite \"Non-co-operation\" movement to\r\ndemonstrate the finality of the breach. Mr. Gandhi appealed in the first\r\nplace to the educated classes to set the example to the people. He\r\ncalled upon those on whom the State had conferred honours and titles to\r\nrenounce them, upon barristers and pleaders to cease to practise in the\r\nlaw-courts, and upon parents to withdraw their children from the\r\nschools and colleges tainted with State control and State doles. If\r\nparents would not hearken to him, schoolboys and students were exhorted\r\nto shake themselves free of their own accord. To the people he opened up\r\nsimpler ways of \"Non-co-operation\" by abstaining from tea and sugar and\r\nall articles of consumption and of clothing contaminated by alien hands\r\nor alien industry. If all would join in a common effort he promised that\r\nIndia would speedily attain _Swaraj_--the term mentioned was generally a\r\nyear--and, quit of the railways and telegraphs and all other instruments\r\nand symbols of Western economic bondage, return to the felicity and\r\ngreatness of Vedic times. All this, however, was to be done by \"soul\r\nforce\" alone and without violence.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the only long conversation I had with Mr. Gandhi I\r\ntried to obtain from him some picture of what India would be like under\r\n_Swaraj_ as he understood it. In a voice as gentle as his whole manner\r\nis persuasive, he explained, more in pity than in anger, that India had\r\nat last recovered her own soul through the fiery ordeal which Hindus and\r\nMahomedans had undergone in the Punjab, and the perfect act of faith\r\nwhich the _Khilafat_ meant for all Mahomedans, and that, purged of the\r\ndegrading influences of the West, she would find again that peace which\r\nwas hers before alien domination divided and exploited her people. As to\r\nthe form of government and administration which would then obtain in\r\nIndia, he would not go beyond a vague assurance that it would be based\r\non the free will of the people expressed by manhood suffrage for which\r\nIndians were already ripe, if called upon to exercise it upon truly\r\nIndian lines. When I objected that caste, which was the bed-rock of\r\nHindu social and religious life, was surely a tremendous obstacle to any\r\nreal democracy, he admitted that the system would have to be restored to\r\nits pristine purity and redeemed from some of the abuses that had crept\r\ninto it. But he upheld the four original castes as laid down in the\r\nVedas, and even their hereditary character, though in practice some born\r\nin a lower caste might well rise by their own merits and secure the\r\ndeference and respect of the highest castes, \"such as, for instance, if\r\nI may in all modesty quote my own unworthy case, the highest Brahmans\r\nspontaneously accord to me to-day, though by birth I am only of a lowly\r\ncaste.\" I tried to get on to more solid ground by pointing out that,\r\nwhatever views one might hold as to his ultimate goal, the methods he\r\nwas employing in trying to break up the existing schools and colleges\r\nand law-courts and to paralyse the machinery of administration was\r\ndestructive rather than constructive, and that, confident as he might\r\nfeel of substituting better things ultimately for those that he had\r\ndestroyed, construction must always be a much slower process than\r\ndestruction; and in the meantime infinite and perhaps irreparable harm\r\nwould be done. \"No,\" he rejoined--and I think I can convey his words\r\npretty accurately, but not his curious smile as of boundless compassion\r\nfor the incurable scepticism of one in outer darkness--\"no, I destroy\r\nnothing that I cannot at once replace. Let your law-courts with their\r\ncumbersome and ruinous procedure disappear, and India will set up her\r\nold _Panchayats_, in which justice will be dispensed in accordance with\r\nher own conscience. For your schools and colleges, upon which lakhs of\r\nrupees have been wasted in bricks and mortar for the erection of\r\nponderous buildings that weigh as heavily upon our boys as the\r\neducational processes by which you reduce their souls to slavery, we\r\nwill give them simpler structures, open to God's air and light, and the\r\nlearning of our forefathers that will make them free men once more.\" Not\r\nthat he would exclude all Western literature--Ruskin, for instance, he\r\nwould always welcome with both hands--nor Western science so long as it\r\nwas applied to spiritual and not to materialistic purposes, nor even\r\nEnglish teachers, if they would become Indianised and were reborn of the\r\nspirit of India. Indeed, what he had looked for, and looked in vain\r\nfor, in the rulers of India was \"a change of hearts\" by which they too\r\nmight be reborn of the spirit of India. He hated no one, for that would\r\nbe a negation of the great principle of _Ahimsa_, on which he expatiated\r\nwith immense earnestness.\r\n\r\nAs I watched the slight ascetic frame and mobile features of the Hindu\r\ndreamer in his plain garment of white home-spun, and, beside him, one of\r\nhis chief Mahomedan allies, Shaukat Ali, with his great burly figure and\r\nheavy jowl and somewhat truculent manner and his opulent robes\r\nembroidered with the Turkish crescent, I wondered how far Mr. Gandhi had\r\nsucceeded in converting his Mahomedan friend to the principle of\r\n_Ahimsa_. Perhaps Mr. Gandhi guessed what was passing in my mind when I\r\nasked him how the fundamental antagonism between the Hindu and the\r\nMahomedan outlook upon life was to be permanently overcome even if the\r\ncommon cause held Hindus and Mahomedans together in the struggle for\r\n_Swaraj_. He pointed at once to his \"brother\" Shaukat as a living proof\r\nof the \"change of hearts\" that had already taken place in the two\r\ncommunities. \"Has any cloud ever arisen between my brother Shaukat and\r\nmyself during the months that we have now lived and worked together? Yet\r\nhe is a staunch Mahomedan and I a devout Hindu. He is a meat-eater and I\r\na vegetarian. He believes in the sword, I condemn all violence. But what\r\ndo such differences matter between two men in both of whom the heart of\r\nIndia beats in unison?\"\r\n\r\nI turned thereupon to Mr. Shaukat Ali and asked him whether he would\r\nexplain to me the application to India under _Swaraj_ of the Mahomedan\r\ndoctrine that the world is divided into two parts, one the \"world of\r\nIslam\" under Mahomedan rule, and the other \"the world of war,\" in which\r\ninfidels may rule for a time but will sooner or later be reduced to\r\nsubjection by the sword of Islam. To which of these worlds would\r\nMahomedans reckon India to belong when she obtained _Swaraj_? Mr.\r\nShaukat Ali evaded the question by assuring me with much unction that\r\nhe could not conceive the possibility of the Hindus doing any wrong to\r\nIslam, but, if the unthinkable happened, Mahomedans, he quickly added,\r\nwould know how to redress their wrongs, for they could never renounce\r\ntheir belief in the sword, and it was indeed because Turkey is the sword\r\nof Islam that they could not see her perish or the Khalifate depart from\r\nher.\r\n\r\nI wondered as I withdrew how long the fiery Mahomedan would keep his\r\nsword sheathed, did he not feel that his own personality and that of his\r\nbrother Mahomed Ali would count for very little without the reflected\r\nhalo with which they were at least temporarily invested by the\r\nsaintliness of Mr. Gandhi's own simple and austere life of\r\nself-renunciation, so different in every way from their own. For it is\r\nto his personality rather than to his teachings that Mr. Gandhi owes his\r\nimmense influence with the people. It is a very different influence from\r\nthat of Mr. Tilak, to whom he is sometimes, but quite wrongly, compared.\r\nMr. Tilak belonged by birth to a powerful Deccani Brahman caste with\r\nhereditary traditions of rulership. He was a man of considerable\r\nSanscrit learning whose researches into the ancient lore of Hinduism\r\ncommanded respectful attention amongst European as well as Indian\r\nscholars. Whatever one may think of his politics and of his political\r\nmethods, he was an astute politician skilled in all the ways of\r\npolitical opportunism. Mr. Gandhi is none of these things. He is not a\r\nBrahman, but of the humbler _Bania_ caste; he does not come from the\r\nDeccan, but from Gujarat, a much less distinguished part of the Bombay\r\nPresidency. He does not claim to be anything but a man of the people. He\r\nlooks small and fragile and his features are homely. He lives in the\r\nsimplest native way, eating simple native food which he is said to\r\nprepare with his own hands, and dresses in the simplest native clothes\r\nfrom his own spinning-wheel. His private life is unimpeachable--the only\r\npoint indeed in which Mr. Tilak resembled him. Though he lays no claim\r\nto Sanscrit erudition, his speeches are replete with references to Hindu\r\nmythology and scripture, but they usually reflect the gentler, and not\r\nthe more terrific, aspects of Hinduism. He blurts out the truth as he\r\nconceives it with as little regard for the feelings or prejudices of his\r\nsupporters as for those of his opponents. He will tell the most orthodox\r\nBrahman audience at Poona that if they want to be the leaders of the\r\nnation they must give up their worldly notions of caste ascendancy and\r\ntheir harsh enforcement of \"untouchability\"; or he will lecture a\r\nyouthful Bengalee audience, intensely jealous of their own language,\r\nupon their shameful ignorance of Hindi, which he believes to be the\r\nfuture language of India and of _Swaraj_. No one could suspect him of\r\nhaving an axe of his own to grind. He is beyond argument, because his\r\nconscience tells him he is right and his conscience must be right, and\r\nthe people believe that he is right, and that his conscience must be\r\nright because he is a _Mahatma_, and as such outside and above caste.\r\nHis influence over the Indian Mahomedan cannot be so deep-rooted, and\r\nthe ancient antagonism between them and the Hindus still endures amongst\r\nthe masses on both sides; but it is of some significance that his warm\r\nespousal of the grievances which large and perhaps growing numbers of\r\nthem have been induced to read into the Turkish peace terms, has led\r\nsome of his most enthusiastic Mahomedan supporters to bestow upon him\r\nthe designation of _Wali_ or Vicegerent which is sometimes used to\r\nconnote religious leadership.\r\n\r\nNo leader has ever dominated any meeting of the old Indian National\r\nCongress as absolutely as Mr. Gandhi dominated last Christmas at Nagpur\r\nthe 20,000 delegates from all parts of India who persisted in calling\r\nthemselves the Indian National Congress, though between them and the\r\noriginal Congress founders few links have survived, and the chief\r\nbusiness of the session was to repudiate the old Congress profession of\r\nloyalty to the British connection as the fundamental article of its\r\ncreed, and to eliminate the reference hitherto retained, with the\r\nconsent even of the Extremists, to India's participation on equal terms\r\nwith the other members of the Empire in all its rights and\r\nresponsibilities. The resolution moved and carried at Nagpur stated\r\nbluntly that \"the object of the Indian National Congress is the\r\nattainment of _Swaraj_ by the people of India by all legitimate and\r\npeaceful means.\" Many of the members would have left out the last words\r\nwhich were intended to ease the scruples of the more weak-kneed\r\nbrethren. But Mr. Jinna, a Mahomedan Extremist from Bombay, whose legal\r\nmind in spite of all his bitterness does not blink the cold light of\r\nreason, warned his audience that India could not achieve complete\r\nindependence by violent means without wading through rivers of blood.\r\nMr. Gandhi himself intimated that India did not \"want to end the British\r\nconnection at all costs unconditionally,\" but he declared it to be\r\n\"derogatory to national dignity to think of the permanence of the\r\nBritish connection at any cost, and it was impossible to accept its\r\ncontinuance in the presence of the grievous wrongs done by the British\r\nGovernment and its refusal to acknowledge or redress them.\" He explained\r\nthat the resolution of which he was the mover could be accepted equally\r\nby \"those who believe that by retaining the British connection we can\r\npurify ourselves and purify the British people, and those who have no\r\nsuch belief.\" He concluded on a more minatory note: \"The British people\r\nwill have to beware that if they do not want to do justice, it will be\r\nthe bounden duty of every Indian to destroy the Empire\"--which Mr.\r\nMahomed Ali, however, with less diplomacy, declared to be already dead\r\nand buried.\r\n\r\nThat the \"Non-co-operation\" programme was reaffirmed at Nagpur except in\r\nregard to the propaganda amongst schoolboys as differentiated from\r\nstudents, and that threats were uttered of extending passive resistance\r\nto the non-payment of taxes and more especially of the land tax, were\r\nnot matters to cause much surprise to those who had measured the sharply\r\ninclined plane down which \"Non-co-operation\" was moving. But one hardly\r\nsees how Mr. Gandhi can reconcile the racial hatred which was the\r\nkey-note of all the proceedings with his favourite doctrine of _Ahimsa_.\r\nHe has, however, himself, on one occasion, openly referred to a time\r\nwhen legions of Indians may be ready to leap to the sword for _Swaraj_,\r\nand though his appeal is to an inner moral force which he declares to be\r\nunconquerable, he does not always disguise from himself or from his\r\nfollowers the bloodshed which the exercise of that moral force may\r\ninvolve. In an article in support of the \"Non-co-operation\" movement in\r\nhis organ _Young India_ the following pregnant passage occurs:\r\n\r\n     For me, I say with Cardinal Newman: \"I do not ask to see the\r\n     distant scene; one step enough for me.\" The movement is essentially\r\n     religious. The business of every God-fearing man is to dissociate\r\n     himself from evil in total disregard of consequences. He must have\r\n     faith in a good deed producing only a good result; that, in my\r\n     opinion, is the Ghita doctrine of work without attachment. God does\r\n     not permit man to peep into the future. He follows truth, although\r\n     the following of it may endanger life. He knows that it is better\r\n     to die in the way of God than to live in the way of Satan.\r\n     Therefore, whoever is satisfied that this Government represents the\r\n     activity of Satan has no choice left to him but to dissociate\r\n     himself from it.\r\n\r\nAre there any limits to the disastrous lengths to which a people may not\r\nbe carried away by one who combines to such ends and in such fashion\r\nreligious and political leadership?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSIDE-LIGHTS ON THE ELECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn probably the last of seventeen visits to India spread over some forty\r\nyears, I landed after three years' absence in Bombay early in November\r\n1920, on the eve of the first elections for the new popular assemblies\r\ncreated by the Act of 1919.\r\n\r\nMunicipal elections there had been in India for a long time past, and\r\nelections for the Councils since 1909, but on a very restricted\r\nfranchise or by indirect processes. To provide a real measure of popular\r\nrepresentation, and even to secure the usefulness of the reforms as a\r\nmeans of political education for the Indian people, the franchise was\r\nnow placed on as broad a basis as possible, whilst in mapping out the\r\nconstituencies the principle of separate representation for particular\r\nraces and creeds and special interests had to be taken into account. The\r\nterritorial basis prevailed largely, and rural and urban constituencies\r\ncorresponded roughly to county and borough constituencies in this\r\ncountry, but besides the \"general constituencies\" for all qualified\r\nelectors indiscriminately, \"special constituencies\" had to be created\r\nwherever required for \"community\" representation, whether of Mahomedans,\r\nor, in the Punjab, of Sikhs, or, in Madras, of non-Brahmans, or, in the\r\nlarge cities, of Europeans and of Eurasians, besides still more\r\nspecialised constituencies for the representation of land-holders,\r\nuniversities, commerce, and industries. There was no female suffrage,\r\nand no plural vote. No elector could vote both in a \"general\r\nconstituency\" and in a \"special\" one. The qualifications laid down for\r\nthe franchise were of a very modest character. Illiteracy was no bar, as\r\nto have made it so in a country where barely 10 per cent of the adult\r\nmales attain to the slender standard of literacy adopted for census\r\npurposes would have reduced the electorate to very insignificant\r\nproportions, and many Indians who cannot read or write have often quite\r\nas shrewd a knowledge of affairs as those who can. The franchise varied\r\nin slight details from province to province, but generally speaking was\r\nbased on a property qualification measured by payment of land revenue or\r\nof income-tax or of municipal rates. Military service counted as a\r\nspecial qualification. Under these regulations about 6,200,000 electors\r\nwere registered, or nearly 2-3/4 per cent of the total population\r\nthroughout India under direct British administration, excluding the\r\nareas to which the Act of 1919 was not to apply.\r\n\r\nThe regulations, however, merely supplied the rough framework; the task\r\nof compiling the lists of qualified electors devolved upon the\r\nGovernment officers and special election commissions appointed _ad hoc_\r\nthroughout the country, and to the much-abused Civil Service mainly\r\nbelongs the credit of having made it possible to hold the elections\r\nwithin less than a year of the passing of the Act. In the Bombay\r\nPresidency, for instance, where I had my first opportunity of seeing the\r\nnew electoral system at work, the electoral rolls finally included some\r\n550,000 electors out of a population of about 20,000,000 of widely\r\ndifferent races and creeds, speaking three absolutely different\r\nlanguages. Even more laborious than the compiling of voters' lists was\r\nthe task of explaining to the vast majority of voters what the vote\r\nmeant, why they ought to use it, and how they had to record it. At many\r\npolling stations ballot-boxes were provided of different colours or\r\nshowing different symbols--a horse, a flag, a cart, a lion,\r\netc.--adopted by candidates to enable the voter who could not read their\r\nnames to drop his ballot ticket into the right box without asking\r\nquestions apt to jeopardise the secrecy of the ballot.\r\n\r\nMany voters instinctively distrusted the privilege suddenly thrust on\r\nthem, and scented in it some trap laid by Government, perhaps for\r\nextracting fresh taxation, or worse. Many more remained wholly\r\nindifferent and saw no reason for putting themselves to the slightest\r\ntrouble in a matter with which they could not see that they had any\r\npersonal concern. Except in large centres, the candidates themselves\r\noften did very little to disarm distrust or to combat indifference.\r\nThere was little or no electioneering of the kind with which we are\r\nfamiliar; and when once \"Non-co-operation\" led to the withdrawal of\r\nExtremist candidates, there was generally no serious line of political\r\ncleavage between the others, who, especially in the rural districts,\r\nwhere their neighbours already knew all about them, were content to rely\r\non their local influence and personal reputation to carry them through.\r\n\r\nThe battle, in fact, was not fought out chiefly at the polls. It was\r\nwaged very fiercely in the press and on the platform between those who\r\nwere bent on paralysing the reforms as the malevolent conception of a\r\n\"Satanic\" Government and those who were determined to bring them to\r\nfruition, not indeed in blind support of Government, but as a means of\r\nexercising constitutional pressure on the Government. Mr. Gandhi\r\ncertainly succeeded not only in dissuading his immediate followers but\r\nin frightening a good many respectable citizens who have no heart for\r\nmilitant politics from coming forward as candidates. Could he have made\r\n\"Non-co-operation\" universally effective, there would have been no\r\ncandidates and no nominations, no elections and no councils. But in this\r\nhe failed, as some of the more worldly Extremists foresaw who obeyed him\r\nin this matter with reluctance. In the Bombay Presidency, Gokhale,\r\nthough dead, had a large share in the victory of the old principles for\r\nwhich he had stood when there had been little will to co-operate on the\r\npart either of Government or of the majority of Western-educated\r\nIndians. For none fought the battle of the Moderates more steadfastly\r\nand faced the rowdiness of the \"Non-co-operationists\" more fearlessly\r\nthan Mr. Srinivasa Sastri, who had succeeded him as the head of his\r\n\"Servants of India\" Society, and Professor Paranjpe, who had long been\r\nclosely associated with him in educational work at the Ferguson College\r\nin Poona. Enough Moderates were found to stick to their colours in\r\npractically every constituency, and they secured their seats, in the\r\nabsence of Extremist nominations, without contest, or after submitting\r\ntheir not very acute political differences to the arbitrament of the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nNowhere had the Extremists developed their plan of campaign on more\r\ncomprehensive lines than in those great United Provinces of Agra and\r\nOudh, which with their huge and dense population of over forty-eight\r\nmillions under one provincial government form the largest and in some\r\nrespects the most important administrative unit in British India. It was\r\nwithin the area which it now covers that the Mutiny broke out and, with\r\nthe exception of Delhi itself, was mainly confined and fought out. The\r\nbitter memories of that period have not yet wholly vanished. It contains\r\na larger proportion than any other province of historic cities--Agra,\r\nLucknow, Cawnpore, Muttra, Jhansi, Benares, Allahabad, some of them\r\nstill the nerve centres of Hinduism and of Islam. The Mahomedans form\r\nonly a minority of about one-sixth of the population, but their\r\ninfluence must not be measured merely by numbers, for one of the\r\ndistinctive features of the United Provinces is the survival of a great\r\nlanded aristocracy in which the Mahomedans are largely represented.\r\nNowhere else, indeed, is the land still held in such an overwhelming\r\nproportion by great landlords, or the rights of the humble tillers of\r\nthe soil more precarious.\r\n\r\nThe Extremists were quick to exploit the various fields of agitation\r\nwhich those peculiar conditions provide. They even launched the forces\r\nof \"Non-co-operation\" against the two Indian universities only founded\r\nwithin the last few years, in deference to the demands of the Indians\r\nthemselves, on frankly denominational lines, in derogation of the very\r\nprinciple of undenominational education that we had upheld in all other\r\nIndian universities. It is one of the many strange anomalies of\r\nGandhiism that it should have elected to concentrate its wrecking policy\r\non the very universities in which Islam and Hinduism respectively have\r\nbeen conceded a closer preserve than anywhere else for the training of\r\nIndian youths in the spirit of the two great national religions of\r\nIndia. The joint efforts of the Hindu saint and of his chief Mahomedan\r\nhenchmen, the brothers Ali, failed to take either the Hindu or the\r\nMahomedan stronghold by storm. Mr. Gandhi, indeed, showed some\r\nreluctance to press his attack upon the Hindu university at Benares with\r\nanything like the same vigour with which he backed up Mahomed and\r\nShaukat Ali's raid on the Mahomedan university at Aligurh, and from so\r\nmarked a contrast many Mahomedans might have been expected to draw very\r\nobvious conclusions.\r\n\r\nMore insidious, and perhaps more dangerous, was the organised attempt of\r\nthe Extremists to get hold of the agricultural masses through the\r\nwidespread discontent, by no means of recent date, due to the peculiar\r\nconditions of land tenure in these provinces. In an essentially\r\nagricultural country such as India still is, and must probably always\r\nremain, agrarian questions are amongst the most difficult and\r\ncomplicated with which British rule has had to deal. For they present\r\nthemselves in the different provinces in forms as diverse as the past\r\nhistory and local conditions of each province, long before it was\r\nbrought under British administration, had combined to make them. Whereas\r\nin the Bombay Presidency, for instance, land is chiefly held by small\r\nlandlords and peasant proprietors, it was held in Agra and Oudh before\r\nthey became British by a great landed aristocracy whose rights, like\r\nall established rights, it was a principle of British policy to respect,\r\nand the _talukdars_ of Oudh and the _zemindars_ of Agra stood for the\r\nmost part very loyally by the British _Raj_ during the Mutiny, and have\r\ncontinued to stand by Government in many difficult if not equally\r\ncritical moments since then.\r\n\r\nThe relationships, varying almost _ad infinitum_ between landlords and\r\ntenants and sub-tenants, have created marked differences which still\r\nexist very widely in the two divisions of the United Provinces. In Agra,\r\nabout half the tenants possess at least occupancy rights, but only a\r\nvery small percentage in Oudh enjoy even that measure of protection.\r\nThere have been successive endeavours to improve the position of the\r\ntillers of the soil by benevolent legislation. But worse even than the\r\nprecarious nature of the tenures are the many forms of arbitrary\r\nexaction to which bad landlords can subject their peasants without any\r\ndefinite breach of the law. Often landlords who want to build a new\r\nhouse or send a son to England or buy a new motor simply levy an extra\r\nanna in the rupee on their rent-rolls which the wretched tenants dare\r\nnot refuse to pay. As in many other matters, the ancient institution of\r\ncaste, which is still the corner-stone of the whole Indian social\r\nstructure, introduces yet another disturbing factor. For tenants and\r\nsub-tenants who belong to the depressed castes are exposed to much\r\nharsher treatment at the hands of their superior landlords than those\r\nwho are privileged to belong to less down-trodden castes. Even the best\r\nlandlords who show some real consideration for their people are actuated\r\nrather by a natural kindliness of disposition than by any conscious\r\nsense of duty or recognition of the special responsibilities that attach\r\nto their high position. Government has for some time past realised the\r\nnecessity of dealing with these questions on broader lines, but when the\r\nreforms scheme first took substance, legislation was, not unreasonably,\r\npostponed until the new Councils met, though the subject is not one of\r\nthose transferred under the Act to Indian ministers.\r\n\r\nAgrarian questions, moreover, are very intimately connected with the\r\nlarger question of land revenue, in regard to which there are signs of a\r\nconsiderable change in the attitude of the politically-minded classes,\r\nor at least of the Moderate section. For a long time the lawyer element,\r\nalways very strong in the Indian National Congress, was not particularly\r\nkeen to see it take up agrarian questions which would have probably\r\nestranged a good many fat clients, and some, though perhaps fewer,\r\npolitical supporters, amongst the land-owning classes. The old Congress\r\nplatform was, moreover, drawn up by and for the _intelligentsia_ of the\r\ntowns, who had little in common with the great rural population of\r\nIndia; and in so far as it professed to champion also the agricultural\r\ninterests of the country, it preferred to concentrate its attacks on the\r\ngeneral system of Indian land revenue and to press for its revision on\r\nthe lines of the \"permanent settlement\" in Bengal--not so much perhaps\r\non account of any intrinsic merits of that \"settlement,\" as because it\r\nwas identified with the province which was then regarded as in the van\r\nof Indian political progress and enlightenment. The \"permanent\r\nsettlement\" in Bengal, effected more than a century and a quarter ago by\r\nLord Cornwallis under a complete misapprehension, as was afterwards\r\nrealised, of the position of the Bengalee _zemindars_, determined once\r\nand for all the proportion of land revenue which Government was entitled\r\nto collect in the province, instead of leaving it, as in other parts of\r\nIndia it is still left, to be varied from time to time after periodical\r\ninquiry into the constantly varying yield and value of the land. The\r\nresult in Bengal has been highly satisfactory from the point of view of\r\nthe large land-owners whose property has appreciated enormously with the\r\ngeneral growth of prosperity during a long period, unprecedented in its\r\nearlier annals, of internal and external peace. It has been less\r\nsatisfactory to the tenants with inferior and infinitely subdivided\r\ninterests who have shared very little in the increased wealth of their\r\nsuperior landlords, and nowhere else has sub-infeudation been carried to\r\nsuch extravagant lengths. But for the State, above all, the results have\r\nbeen singularly unfortunate, as it has debarred itself from taking toll\r\nof the unearned increment that has been constantly accruing to the\r\n_zemindars_.\r\n\r\nSo long as the National Congress saw little or no hope of securing the\r\ntransfer of any substantial share in the governance of the country to\r\nIndian shoulders, it could afford to indulge in wholesale criticism of\r\nGovernment finance and to propose sweeping changes without stopping to\r\nconsider ways and means or to weigh the ultimate effects upon the\r\nrevenue of the State, and it was easy for it to court popularity by\r\ninveighing against the land tax and advocating the extension of the\r\n\"permanent settlement\" to the whole of India as a sovereign panacea. But\r\nsober Indian politicians have begun to look farther ahead and to reckon\r\nwith the costs of the many popular reforms which Indian Ministers will\r\nbe expected to carry through in the new Councils. Mr. Gandhi and his\r\nfollowers, who are determined if possible to wreck them, are deterred by\r\nno such considerations, and the non-payment of the land tax, which must\r\nremain the backbone of Indian revenue, already figures in their\r\nprogramme of \"Non-co-operation,\" of which the avowed object is to\r\nparalyse Government and render British rule impossible without any\r\nresort to the methods of violence they profess to deprecate. It can\r\nhardly fail to prove a fairly popular cry, for there is no more\r\nunpalatable form of co-operation with Government all the world over than\r\nthe payment of taxes, and the Extremists combine this part of their\r\npropaganda with more specialised efforts to capture the confidence of\r\nthe particular classes amongst the peasantry who have rent and tenure\r\ngrievances by warmly espousing their cause against the landlords and\r\ninciting them to organised resistance. They not only stimulate thereby\r\na general feeling of unrest and discontent, but they actually carry the\r\nwar to the very doors of the great land-owning class which has hitherto\r\nbeen least accessible to revolutionary influences.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the special features of the \"Non-co-operation\" campaign\r\nin the United Provinces, and Mr. Gandhi himself arrived on the scene to\r\nlend it the full weight of his personal influence on the very eve of the\r\nelections. How extraordinary is the influence of his mesmeric\r\npersonality and style of oratory I realised when I drove out on the day\r\nof the elections into a district outside Allahabad where he had himself\r\naddressed on the previous afternoon a vast crowd of twenty thousand\r\npeasants. It was about noon, and only a few creaking bullock-carts and\r\n\"the footfall mute of the slow camel\"--neither of them suggestive of a\r\nhotly contested election--disturbed the drowsy peace which even in the\r\ncoolest season of the year in Upper India falls on the open country when\r\nthe sun pours down out of the cloudless sky. Here at a roadside shrine a\r\ngroup of brightly dressed village women were trying to attract the\r\nattention of a favourite god by ringing the little temple bell. There\r\nsome brown-skinned youngsters were driving their flock of goats and\r\nsheep into the leafy shelter of the trees. But the fields, now bare of\r\ncrops, were lifeless, and the scattered hamlets mostly fast asleep.\r\nAbout fifteen miles out we reached the big village of Soraon--almost a\r\nsmall township--in which there seemed equally little to suggest that\r\nthis was the red-letter day in the history of modern India that was to\r\ninitiate her people into the great art of self-government. Still the\r\nsmall court-house, we found, had been swept and garnished for use as a\r\npolling station. Two small groups of people stood listlessly outside the\r\nbuilding, the candidates' agents on the one side of the entrance, and on\r\nthe other the _patwaris_--the village scribes who keep the official land\r\nrecords--brought in from the different villages to attest the signatures\r\nand thumbmarks of the voters. Inside, the presiding officer with his\r\nassistants sat at his table with the freshly printed electoral roll in\r\nfront of him and the voting paper to be handed to each voter as he\r\npassed into the inner sanctuary in which the ballot-boxes awaited him.\r\nBut voters there were none. From eight in the morning till past twelve\r\nnot a single voter had presented himself out of over 1200 assigned to\r\nthis polling station, nor did a single one present himself in the course\r\nof the whole day.\r\n\r\nNowhere else, however, was the boycott so effective, and throughout the\r\nprovince a full third of the qualified electors recorded their\r\nvotes--not a bad percentage under such novel conditions and in the face\r\nof such a determined effort to wreck the elections. The land-owning\r\nclass secured the representation to which its hereditary influence\r\nunquestionably entitles it, but it has held so much aloof from modern\r\neducation that with some notable exceptions it contributes numbers\r\nrather than capacity to the Council. With forty-four members belonging\r\nto the legal profession out of a total of one hundred members this\r\nProvincial Council, like most others, is doubtless somewhat overstocked\r\nwith lawyers. But upon no other profession has Mr. Gandhi urged more\r\nstrongly the duty of \"Non-co-operation,\" and that, after having been for\r\nyears conspicuous for political disaffection, it should have rallied so\r\ngenerally in support of the reforms shows how great is the change they\r\nhave wrought amongst the Western-educated classes. Nowhere in the United\r\nProvinces was the electoral battle so fierce as in the town of Jhansi,\r\nwhere Mr. Chintamani, once the irreconcilable editor of the Allahabad\r\n_Leader_, came out at the head of a large poll, though in order to\r\ndefeat him the \"Non-co-operationists\" sacrificed their principles and\r\nput up and supported with their own votes an obscure candidate by whose\r\nelection they hoped to bring the new Council into contempt.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding feature of the elections in Bengal was the striking\r\nevidence afforded of a return to political sanity in a province which, a\r\ndozen years ago, was the chief political storm-centre in India. Many of\r\nthe same leaders who, formerly, at least dallied with lawlessness during\r\nthe violent agitation that followed the Partition of Bengal now came\r\nforward openly as champions of constitutional progress on the lines of\r\nthe new reforms and as candidates for the new Councils. They knew what\r\nall their own attempts to make a _Swadeshi_ boycott really effective by\r\ndeveloping \"national\" industries and substituting \"national\" products\r\nand \"national\" trade agencies for foreign ones had ended in. They\r\nremembered the failure of the \"national\" schools and colleges which were\r\nto have supplanted Government schools and colleges. They realised that a\r\ndangerous propaganda which had involved hundreds of immature youths in a\r\nnetwork of criminal conspiracies had tended to the subversion of every\r\nprinciple of authority, at the expense of the parent at least as much as\r\nof good government and public peace. When the famous Pronouncement of\r\nAugust 20, 1917, opened up for India the prospect of ultimate\r\nself-government within the Empire, and the recommendations of the\r\nMontagu-Chelmsford Report finally took shape in a new Government of\r\nIndia Act, there was found a solid body of public opinion in Bengal\r\nwhich had been taught by actual and very costly experience not to throw\r\naway the substance for the shadow. The most influential perhaps amongst\r\nthe Extremists during the Anti-Partition campaign was Mr. Arabindo\r\nGhose, who, like Mr. Gandhi, had studied in England and with great\r\ndistinction. Though, unlike Mr. Gandhi, he never indulged in wholesale\r\ndenunciations of Western civilisation, his newspaper, the _Yugantar_,\r\nwas a daily trumpet-call to revolt against British rule, and he himself\r\nnarrowly escaped conviction on a charge of bomb-making. Yet as far back\r\nas 1910, from his place of retirement in Pondicherry, he issued after\r\nthe Morley-Minto reforms had been promulgated a significant message to\r\nhis fellow-countrymen advising them to accept partial _Swaraj_ as a\r\nmeans to ensure complete _Swaraj_, and amongst the literature that\r\nhelped to defeat \"Non-co-operation\" in Bengal, one of the most striking\r\npamphlets was one entitled \"Gandhi or Arabindo?\" in which a very fervent\r\ndisciple and collaborator of the latter in the most fiery days of the\r\n_Yugantar_ argued with great force the case for co-operation with\r\nGovernment against \"Non-co-operation\" as now preached by Mr. Gandhi.\r\nOnly less remarkable has been the conversion of many other old Bengalee\r\nleaders, including the veteran Sir Surendranath Banerjee, who never,\r\nhowever, went quite to the same lengths of extremism.\r\n\r\nDuring the electoral campaign Mr. Gandhi could still find large\r\naudiences, not all consisting of excitable students, to acclaim him or\r\nto listen open-mouthed to his ceaseless flow of eloquence. But the\r\nelectors went to the polls and voted for the candidates against whom he\r\nand his followers had fulminated, and, in the rural districts\r\nespecially, election meetings often refused to listen to any elaborate\r\npolitical dissertations, and wanted only to hear what the candidates\r\nwere prepared to do for elementary education, sanitation, schools,\r\nroads, etc. So the Bengal elections too resulted in the return, often by\r\nrelatively large bodies of voters, of members pledged and competent to\r\nco-operate with Government. The _Khilafat_ agitation, accompanied in\r\nBengal as everywhere else by aggressive religious intimidation, affected\r\nthe polling in some of the Mahomedan constituencies. But during the\r\nAnti-Partition campaign Mahomedans and Hindus had been in opposite\r\ncamps, whereas Mr. Gandhi was now making a strong and to some extent\r\nsuccessful bid for Mahomedan support by endorsing the Mahomedan\r\ngrievance. So the Mahomedan change of front merely emphasised\r\n\"Non-co-operation's\" defeat in Bengal.\r\n\r\nEqually hopeful were the signs of a better understanding and of the\r\nrevival of a spirit of friendly co-operation between Indians and\r\nEnglishmen in Calcutta, hitherto regarded, not quite without reason, as\r\na stronghold of reactionary European conservatism, especially amongst\r\nthe non-official community. It can hardly be denied that, except where\r\nofficial relations brought them into contact--and not always\r\nthere--Europeans and Indians have lived too much in separate water-tight\r\ncompartments until each has ceased to see anything but the beam in the\r\nother's eye. In Calcutta they have been far more rarely drawn together\r\nin commercial and industrial co-operation, and they have rubbed up less\r\nfrequently against each other in healthy competition than, for instance,\r\nin Bombay. It is one of the most promising features of the new reforms\r\nthat the Europeans, who have hitherto taken very little interest in\r\nanything that was not directly connected with their own business or\r\ntheir own amusements, have been at last roused to play the part which it\r\nis their duty as well as their right to play in the political life of\r\nthe country, and the men who have been returned to sit in the new\r\nCouncils as the representatives of the European community seem to\r\nrealise fully, the importance of the task that is before them in giving\r\na practical example of what the helpful co-operation of Europeans with\r\nIndians can do to promote the healthy political life of the country.\r\n\r\nIn social service there is an equally large field of co-operation of\r\nwhich Calcutta has also provided an interesting illustration. In no\r\nother city in India are University students, of whom there are nearly as\r\nmany--some 26,000--at the one university of Calcutta as in all the\r\nuniversities of Great Britain put together, thrown so much on their own\r\nresources without any guidance or control. The bulk of them may never\r\ncome in contact even with European professors, let alone with the\r\nEuropean community in general. What opportunities have they of forming\r\nany opinion for themselves of what our civilisation stands for, except\r\npossibly through the medium of cheap cinemas in which its worst and most\r\nvulgar features are thrust before them? Bengalee youths are\r\nextraordinarily quick to respond to the best European influence when it\r\nhas once established contact with them. Some teachers do secure a\r\nstrong personal hold upon them, most of all in the missionary and other\r\nhostels where they live under the same roof with them, take part in\r\ntheir games as well as in their studies, and encourage them to express\r\ntheir own opinions freely and fearlessly. There relations of mutual\r\nfriendship and confidence grow up and endure. In this respect the\r\nY.M.C.A., in which Indian Christians act in close co-operation with\r\nbroad-minded Englishmen, has done admirable work, and none better and\r\nwith more definite and immediate results than when Government turned to\r\nthem for assistance last year in the difficult situation created by the\r\nroyal amnesty which required the immediate liberation of nearly a\r\nthousand young Bengalees who, having been more or less concerned in\r\nconspiracies and dacoities during the troublous years before the war,\r\nhad been interned after its outbreak under administrative orders. In\r\nmany cases they had broken with their families, who were not inclined to\r\ntake them back. Many had no means of earning a livelihood. To let them\r\nloose upon the world without any provision for them would have been to\r\ndrive them to desperation. The Y.M.C.A. stepped into the breach. They\r\nwere given the use of an internment camp which German war _détenus_ had\r\nvacated, and with the help of Mr. B.C. Chatterjee, who was well known to\r\nthat particular class of Indians for having constantly appeared as\r\ncounsel for the defendants in the innumerable political prosecutions of\r\nthe preceding decade, and had himself formed an Indian Committee for a\r\nsimilar purpose, they induced a large number of these young fellows to\r\ncome to them. They were at first rather distrustful, but Mr.\r\nChatterjee's political past and the warm-hearted sympathy of Mr. Rahu,\r\nan Indian Y.M.C.A. worker who was placed in charge of the hostel, soon\r\ndisarmed their suspicions. They learnt to appraise at their real value\r\nthe malicious rumours set afoot to prejudice them against their new\r\nfriends, and began to respond cordially to a generous treatment,\r\nphysical and moral, which was so unlike all that they had heard about\r\nWestern methods. They were given food and lodging, newspapers,\r\nmagazines, and books, and, when necessary, medical advice and care. They\r\nhad opportunities of learning a trade and securing employment as well as\r\nfacilities for indoor and outdoor recreation, and carefully planned\r\nsocial gatherings helped to restore their self-respect and confidence.\r\nTo their credit be it said, their conduct was unexceptionable, and not a\r\nsingle complaint was received with regard to any of those who thus found\r\na new start in life. One could well credit the assurance that they were\r\nall as much opposed to any reversion to \"Non-co-operation\" as Sir\r\nSurendranath Banerjee himself.\r\n\r\nMuch must always depend upon the example set by those in authority not\r\nonly as administrators but as the natural leaders of both European and\r\nIndian society. Lord Ronaldshay, whose appointment as Governor of Bengal\r\nwas not at first very well received by the politically minded Indians in\r\nCalcutta, has succeeded by patient effort in convincing them that they\r\nhave a genuine as well as a candid friend in him, and even his social\r\npopularity is due not merely to the generosity of his hospitality but to\r\nthe keen interest he takes, amongst other things, in the renascence of\r\nIndian art in which Bengal has taken the lead. There is amongst\r\nEuropeans in India a good deal of Philistine contempt for all Indian\r\nforms of culture, and Indians are surprised and grateful when Governors\r\nlike Lord Ronaldshay, and his predecessor, Lord Carmichael, frankly\r\nacknowledge that whilst Indian painting and Indian music are ruled by\r\nother canons than those of the West, they pursue none the less high\r\nideals along different paths. What Indians look for too often in vain\r\nfrom Europeans is any hearty attempt either to understand them or to\r\nmake them understand us. The influence which Lord Ronaldshay had\r\nacquired by such forms of co-operation with the Indian mind stood him\r\nand the Bengal Provincial Council in good stead when he had on one\r\noccasion to appeal to it to reconsider its hasty refusal of a grant in\r\nwhich it would have been impossible for Government to acquiesce, lest he\r\nshould be driven to override it by the exercise of the statutory powers\r\nvested in him. He gave it to be understood that, if they became\r\nfrequent, such conflicts of opinion between him and the Council would\r\nput an end to his usefulness either to the Government or to the\r\nPresidency, and he would feel justified in demanding his release from\r\nresponsibilities he would no longer be able satisfactorily to discharge.\r\nThe Council was wise enough to take the hint and not to risk losing a\r\nGovernor who had done so much to earn the confidence of Bengal, and by\r\ncorrecting an error of judgment, due chiefly to inexperience, it\r\nconfirmed the victory which had been won over \"Non-co-operation\" at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nEven in the storm-tossed Punjab the new Provincial Council made a better\r\nstart than might have been expected from the temper of Lahore and the\r\nother large centres still brooding over the bitter memories of 1919. In\r\nthe Punjab and in the neighbouring North-West Frontier Province,\r\nformerly itself part of the Punjab--but excluded from the operation of\r\nthe new Government of India Act and therefore lying outside this\r\nsurvey--the _Khilafat_ agitation has gone deeper than probably in any\r\nother part of India amongst large and very backward Mahomedan\r\npopulations. Yet upon the Punjab itself so cruel a lesson has not been\r\nlost as that taught to thousands of unfortunate Mahomedan peasants in\r\nthe Frontier Province who were persuaded to give up their lands and trek\r\ninto Afghanistan to seek the blessings of Mahomedan rule, and came back\r\nstarved and plundered from their ill-starred exodus undertaken for the\r\nsake of Islam. In Lahore and in the other chief urban constituencies\r\n\"Non-co-operation,\" with its usual methods of combined persuasion and\r\nintimidation, was so far successful that not 5 per cent of the electors\r\nwent to the poll. In some of the Mahomedan rural constituencies the\r\nattendances at the polls were, on the other hand, fairly large,\r\nespecially in those where the influence of old conservative families was\r\nstill paramount. Altogether the Punjab Provincial Council is perhaps\r\nless representative of the whole electorate than in any other province\r\nin India. Some official ingenuity had been displayed in grouping remote\r\ntowns together without any regard for geography, in order to prevent\r\ntownsmen undesirably addicted to advanced political views from standing\r\nas candidates for the rural constituencies in which many of the smaller\r\ntowns would otherwise have been naturally merged. This was a last effort\r\nbased on the old belief that the population of the Punjab could be\r\ndivided into goats and sheep, the goats being the \"disloyal\" townsmen\r\nand the sheep being the \"loyal\" peasantry. There may have been substance\r\nin that belief before 1919, but how little there is in it now has been\r\nshown by the large majority who, in an assembly in which it is just the\r\nrural constituencies that are most effectively represented, passed a\r\nResolution for the remission of the fine imposed on Amritsar to punish\r\nthe disorders in that city, already amply punished, they considered, at\r\nJallianwala. The presence in the new Government of Mr. Harkishen Lal,\r\nhimself condemned two years ago under martial law to transportation for\r\nlife and treated for months as a common criminal, has done more than\r\nanything else perhaps to restore public confidence. He was elected to\r\nthe Council, not by political firebrands, but by a sober constituency\r\nspecially constituted to represent the Punjab Industries, and in\r\ncourageously choosing him to be one of his new Ministers, the Governor,\r\nSir Edward MacLagan, gave a striking demonstration, of which the effect\r\nhas not been confined to the Punjab, of the profound change that has\r\nbeen wrought in the attitude of the official world towards the\r\npolitically minded classes.\r\n\r\nAn appalling incident last spring showed how quick the fierce races of\r\nNorthern India are to burst into violent feuds amongst themselves for\r\nwhich no responsibility can be imputed to their alien rulers. The\r\nSikhs, though less numerous than the Hindus and the Mahomedans, form an\r\nextremely influential community in the Punjab, which was the cradle and\r\nalways has been the stronghold of their religion, and was only a century\r\nago the seat of their political and military power. Not many years ago,\r\nhowever, Sikhism, which began in Moghul times as a revolt against the\r\nsocial and religious trammels of Hinduism as well as against Mahomedan\r\ndomination, seemed to be tending steadily towards resorption into the\r\nHindu system. Its temples, most of them richly endowed, had passed out\r\nof the control of the community, to whom they in theory belonged, into\r\nthe possession of lukewarm Mahunts, or incumbents, many of them half\r\nHinduised and most of them more concerned with the temporal advantages\r\nthan with the religious duties of their office. Even in the days of the\r\nmilitant Sikh Confederacy under Ranjit Singh, upon whom religion sat\r\nrather lightly, there was a growing trend towards laxity of belief and\r\npractice, which continued to spread after the British annexation of the\r\nPunjab had broken the political power of the Sikhs. Strange to say, the\r\nold customs of pure Sikhism survived nowhere so immune from decay as in\r\nthe Sikh regiments of our Indian Army. But with the growth of Indian\r\nNationalism, which often manifested itself at first in a revival of\r\nlocal and racial patriotism, there arose amongst the Sikhs a vigorous\r\nreform movement which aimed at rebuilding their nationhood on the solid\r\nfoundations of the faith originally preached by their ten Gurus, or\r\nreligious teachers, and the strict observance of the peculiar customs\r\nthat were the badge of their faith. The first important step was the\r\nopening of the Khalsa College for Sikhs at Amritsar in 1892, which did\r\nnot, however, fulfil its real purpose until it was gradually emancipated\r\nfrom Government control. A religious Diwan, or assembly, was constituted\r\nat Lahore, to which local bodies were affiliated, with the object of\r\npreaching purity of religion and promoting the abolition of caste\r\ndistinctions and other Hindu influences that had crept back into\r\nSikhism.\r\n\r\nIn its essence a puritan movement, there was unquestionably a\r\nnationalist side to it which tended to render it suspect in the eyes of\r\nmany Punjab officials, and these suspicions were heightened by the\r\n_Gadr_ conspiracy fomented in the second year of the war by a number of\r\nSikhs, who returned from Canada bitterly estranged from British rule by\r\nthe anti-Asiatic policy of the Dominion and still more by the fiery\r\neloquence of Indian revolutionaries in German pay. But against the\r\ndisloyalty of a small section must be weighed the loyal war services of\r\nthe vast majority of Sikhs, and the Punjab Government proudly boasted at\r\nthe time that there were 80,000 Sikhs serving in the army, a proportion\r\nfar higher than in the case of any other community. It was doubtless\r\npartly in recognition of such war services that in the reforms scheme\r\nthey were given the benefit of \"community\" representation in the new\r\nCouncils on the same lines as the Mahomedans. But with a tenacious\r\nmemory of the language used years ago by Lord Minto in reply to\r\nMahomedan representations, they still complain that the historical\r\nimportance and actual influence of their community have not received\r\nnearly as full a measure of consideration. Unfortunately, bitterness was\r\nrevived by the large number of Sikhs amongst General Dyer's victims at\r\nJallianwala, most of them, according to the Sikh version, innocent\r\ncountry-folk, who had come into Amritsar on that day because it happened\r\nto be a Sikh religious holiday, and had merely strayed into the Bagh out\r\nof harmless and ignorant curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe puritan movement struck a dangerous course when it addressed itself\r\nto the recovery of the Sikh shrines which it held to have passed into\r\nthe possession of unorthodox and corrupt Mahunts, faithless both to\r\ntheir religious and temporal trust. Considerable success was achieved by\r\nthe exercise, it was affirmed, of mere moral pressure, though not\r\nperhaps always without a display or threat of material pressure behind\r\nit in the event of moral pressure proving inadequate. Amongst others,\r\nthe incumbent of the Golden Temple at Amritsar, the most sacred of all\r\nSikh shrines, was constrained to make a public confession of his\r\nwrongdoings and resign his office into the hands of a Reformers'\r\nCommittee. Next to Amritsar in wealth and sanctity came Nankhanda Saheb\r\nwith a Mahunt to whom the Reformers imputed all kinds of enormities. A\r\ngreat popular demonstration against him had been organised for March 5,\r\nand some 150 Sikhs had gone out to make arrangements for sheltering and\r\nfeeding several thousands in the immediate vicinity of the shrine. The\r\nMahunt had already scented danger and he clearly believed in taking the\r\noffensive. He collected some fifty Pathan cut-throats as a Praetorian\r\nguard for the temple, and also, for a purpose which was soon to\r\ntranspire, a very large store of petrol. When the advance party of\r\nreformers entered the shrine to perform their morning devotions the\r\ngates were closed upon them and over 100 were butchered, and their\r\ncorpses so effectively soaked in oil and burned that when the District\r\nCommissioner and a detachment of troops arrived post-haste on the scene,\r\nthe victims could scarcely be counted except by the number of charred\r\nskulls.\r\n\r\nThere was a universal thrill of horror and fury, and passions rose so\r\nhigh that Government found itself suddenly confronted with a situation\r\nwhich at once put to a severe test the capacity of the new regime to\r\ndeal with emergencies endangering law and order. That Indian Ministers\r\nnow shared in the responsibility of government, and that there was a\r\npopular assembly to undertake legislation for composing the differences\r\nbetween the conflicting sections of the Sikh community, helped at least\r\nas much to avert still graver troubles as the object-lesson which the\r\nNankhanda Saheb tragedy afforded to thoughtful Punjabees of all creeds.\r\nThe massacre carried out by a mere handful of Pathans was a grim\r\nreminder of the dangers to which the Punjab would be the first to be\r\nexposed if the hasty severance of the British connection for which Mr.\r\nGandhi is clamouring were to leave it defenceless against the flood of\r\nlawless savagery that would at once pour down, as so often before in\r\nIndian history, from the wild fastnesses of the North-West Frontier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCROSS CURRENTS IN SOUTHERN INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elections in the Southern Provinces presented a somewhat different\r\npicture though the defeat of \"Non-co-operation\" was equally complete.\r\nThe Nerbudda river has been from times immemorial a great dividing line,\r\nclimatic, racial, and often political, between Northern and Southern\r\nIndia. It still is so. For, whilst with a few relatively unimportant\r\nexceptions the whole of British India--save Burma, which, except from an\r\nadministrative point of view, is not India at all--has been brought with\r\nperhaps excessive uniformity within the scope of the new constitutional\r\nreforms, many conditions in the Central Provinces and in the great\r\nPresidency of Madras differ widely from those prevailing in the other\r\nmajor provinces north of the Nerbudda, and the actual failure of\r\n\"Non-co-operation\" to enforce its boycott of the elections was less\r\nnoteworthy than some other features in the new situation. In the Central\r\nProvinces the elections themselves were fought out on much the same\r\nlines as in the north and with very similar results, if allowance is\r\nmade for the intellectual backwardness of the province. Political\r\nactivity and agitation had been confined in the past mainly to Nagpur,\r\nthe capital, and to the western districts, in which a large Mahratta\r\nelement predominates especially amongst the better-educated classes.\r\nMost of Mr. Tilak's former followers there had joined the\r\n\"Non-co-operation\" movement, and their rigid abstention from the\r\nelections left the doors of the Provincial Council wide open for the\r\nrepresentation of more sober Indian opinion. The Extremists showed their\r\ncontempt for the new assembly by putting up one or two \"freak\"\r\ncandidates in breach of the boycott they were preaching, and actually\r\ngot in a _dhobi_, or laundryman, at Jubbulpur. But the elections were\r\novershadowed by the preparations for the Nagpur Congress, which was to\r\nbe the great Gandhi counterblast to the Reforms, and the Extremists, who\r\npoured into the province from the neighbouring Bombay Presidency,\r\nconcentrated their efforts on the creation of an atmosphere of general\r\nunrest favourable to the new line of campaign upon which the rump of the\r\nold Indian National Congress was about to enter with the open\r\nrenunciation of the fundamental article of its original creed--loyalty\r\nto the British connection.\r\n\r\nIt seems one of the strangest of the many anomalies with which the\r\nIndian situation teems that the Central Provinces should have been\r\nchosen of all others as the scene for a great spectacular demonstration\r\nof revolt against the state of \"slavery\" to which Indians have been\r\nreduced by a \"Satanic\" alien rule. It is one of the precepts of Mr.\r\nGandhi's gospel of \"Non-co-operation,\" though doubtless only as a\r\ncounsel of perfection, that Indian husbands and wives must cease to\r\nbring \"slave\" children into the world until India has attained _Swaraj_.\r\nYet in the Central Provinces a larger proportion of Indian children than\r\nin any other province are born every year to a state of degradation much\r\nmore closely akin to slavery, which is not imposed upon them by any\r\nalien rulers, but by the ancient traditions of those of their own race\r\nand creed whose interest it is to perpetuate at the expense of their\r\nless fortunate fellow-countrymen the most cruel form of caste tyranny.\r\nOf the total population of the Central Provinces, which numbered some\r\nsixteen millions at the last Census in 1911, one-fifth belong to that\r\norder of humanity which stands so low in the eyes of Hindus that it is\r\nunworthy to be reckoned as possessing any caste at all. These no-castes\r\nstand at the very foot of the social ladder of Hinduism, and in theory\r\nat least they can never hope to climb even on to its lowest rungs,\r\nthough in practice the most stringent laws can be gradually circumvented\r\nwith the help of needy Brahmans or will yield to the pressure of\r\nchanging economic conditions. They are \"untouchable,\" _i.e._ that any\r\nphysical contact with them involves defilement of which the caste Hindu\r\ncan only cleanse himself by ritual ablutions and other forms of\r\nceremonial purification. Go into a village which is partially inhabited\r\nby these unfortunate people, mostly called Mahars in that part of India,\r\nand you will find that they are forbidden even to draw water from any\r\nbut their own wells, as by drawing it from wells used by caste Hindus\r\nthey would render them impure. In the larger urban schools under\r\nGovernment control British laws, which recognise no caste distinctions,\r\nenforce the admission of Mahar boys, some of whom do extremely well. But\r\nin a village school you will often see the poor little \"untouchables,\"\r\nif admitted at all, relegated to mats on the outside verandah, where\r\nthey may pick up such scraps of teaching as they can. The Government\r\ninspector of schools may remonstrate, but he knows that few teachers\r\nwill make any serious attempt to mend matters, and that if they did the\r\ncaste-boys would be withdrawn by their indignant parents.\r\n\r\nWhen I was touring a few years ago in the Central Provinces with a\r\nBritish commissioner, who was carrying on an inquiry into certain\r\ngrievances of the peasantry in connection with irrigation, the villagers\r\nfrom the more remote villages were frequently collected along the road\r\nto tell their story, and they brought with them their land-records.\r\nThese the \"untouchables\" had to lay on the ground at the feet of the\r\nBrahman subordinate, who would have been defiled had he taken them\r\nstraight out of their hands, and only after they had withdrawn a few\r\npaces did he condescend to pick up the books and verify them before\r\npassing them on to his British superior. The latter, on the other hand,\r\nthough the representative, according to Congress orators, of a \"Satanic\"\r\nGovernment that has reduced Indians to \"slavery,\" never hesitated to\r\nquestion the poor \"untouchables\" closely and good-humouredly, not merely\r\nabout the particular matter at issue, but about the condition of their\r\ncrops or the health of their village, and sometimes gave a friendly pat\r\non the back to the youngsters who accompanied their elders, whilst the\r\nBrahman stood by in stony and disgusted silence.\r\n\r\nThese caste discriminations doubtless originated in remote ages when the\r\nAryan conquerors from the north gradually subdued the aboriginal\r\nDravidian populations. The \"untouchables\" are mostly remnants of that\r\npopulation, some of them still very primitive jungle folk whom the\r\nCensus classes as \"animists,\" or nature-worshippers, _i.e._ they still\r\nworship trees and stones and the spirits that are supposed to dwell in\r\nthem. But they tend gradually to include in their worship some of the\r\ngods and goddesses of the Hindu Pantheon, especially those who are\r\ncredited with power to avert the worst scourges to which the people\r\nhappen to be subject. Under a sacred roadside tree I have seen in one\r\nplace a rude stone, roughly shaped to represent the Goddess of\r\nSmall-pox, and alongside of it a clay image of a tiger that had killed a\r\nman on that very spot, set up in the hope of averting further\r\nmanifestations of its wrath, and also of appeasing the dead man's soul\r\nso that he might remain quietly within the tiger and become a kindly\r\nprotector to the village. The appropriation of Hindu deities is usually\r\nthe first step towards their absorption into the Hindu social structure.\r\nOthers, the more progressive, have settled down as cultivators, a few\r\noccasionally becoming quite considerable land-owners. Others, again,\r\nhave taken to weaving and to petty trade. Under British rule they have\r\nprogressed all along the line. A Mahar regiment has been raised,\r\nofficered by Mahomedans from the north, as no Hindu would think of\r\nserving with \"untouchables,\" and though Hindu sepoys must not be\r\nbrought into proximity with it, it has always behaved very creditably.\r\nSome Mahars are now well educated, and in favour of two of them the\r\nGovernor of the Central Provinces has exercised the right conferred upon\r\nhim to nominate a certain number of members to the Provincial\r\nLegislative Council in order to give some representation to communities\r\ntoo backward to secure any for themselves under the existing franchise.\r\n\r\nOne of the best results of British governance and of Western education\r\nhas been to stimulate even amongst the \"untouchables\" a new sense of\r\nself-respect and self-reliance and a wholesome desire to emerge from the\r\ndegradation to which the custom of centuries has condemned them. It is\r\namongst them that of late years Christian and even Mahomedan\r\nmissionaries have found all over India their most fruitful field, and in\r\nsome provinces mass-movements to Christianity have taken place, which\r\nare admittedly due in the first place to a desire for social\r\nemancipation, but will steadily lead, if properly handled, to moral and\r\nreligious advancement. One of the great problems now before the\r\nmissionary societies of all Christian denominations is how these tens of\r\nthousands of converts can be taught and trained, and it is of great\r\npromise for the future that a Commission of Inquiry composed of British\r\nand American and Indian Christian missionaries has recently issued a\r\nreport on Village Education in India which has approached this problem,\r\namongst others, with a broad-minded appreciation of its economic and\r\nsocial as well as purely religious aspects.\r\n\r\nIs it surprising that when the Indian National Congress, that has\r\nhitherto done nothing for them beyond embodying in its programme vague\r\nexpressions of sympathy, is agitating for the severance of the British\r\nconnection, and Extremist orators perambulate the country to preach a\r\nboycott of British officials, the Mahars should have sent in petitions\r\nimploring the Governor not to abandon them or surrender the power which\r\nhas alone done something to raise them out of the slough of despond? Mr.\r\nGandhi, however, who would be a great social reformer had he not\r\npreferred to plunge into a dangerous political agitation, is not himself\r\nblind to such an awful blot as \"untouchability\" has made on Hindu\r\ncivilisation, and some of his followers, prompted perhaps less than he\r\nis himself by a generous reforming spirit, have not been slow to see\r\nwhat abundant materials lie ready to their hand in these vast masses,\r\nprofoundly ignorant and superstitious, if they can only be drawn into\r\nthe turbid stream of \"Non-co-operation\" by some novel and ingenious\r\nappeal to their fears or to their appetites.\r\n\r\nIn the Madras Presidency, never swept to the same degree as Bengal or\r\nBombay by the waves of political unrest, the electoral struggle assumed\r\na form, peculiar to Southern Indian conditions, in which\r\n\"Non-co-operation\" entered very little. For Southern India has its own\r\nlife-history which differentiates it in many respects from other parts\r\nof India, and in none more so than in the survival of the Brahman's\r\nancient ascendancy, until recently almost unchallenged in this\r\nstronghold of Hinduism.\r\n\r\nMostly of the primitive Dravidian stock that inhabited the peninsula\r\nbefore the great Aryan inflow from the north, and still speaking\r\nDravidian languages, the people of Southern India have preserved in its\r\nmost archaic form the social system of Hinduism which the Aryan\r\nconquerors, probably never more than a small minority, imposed upon them\r\nby the relative superiority of their civilisation quite as much as by\r\nforce of arms. Of a much fairer complexion, the Aryans became the ruling\r\n\"white\" race of those days, and to preserve their racial prestige they\r\nenforced the most rigid laws for the differentiation of caste--which\r\noriginally meant colour. The Brahmans, being the law-givers, naturally\r\nframed laws to secure the pre-eminence of their own caste, and to the\r\npresent day, for instance, in the more remote parts of Southern India,\r\nmen of the lower castes may be seen retiring hastily from the road at\r\nhis approach, lest they should pollute the air he breathes by coming\r\nwithin a forbidden distance of him.\r\n\r\nIn Southern India, where Buddhist influence never secured any firm\r\nfooting, Hinduism had its golden age during the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, whilst the tide of Mahomedan invasion was pouring in\r\nsuccessive waves into Northern and Central India. The last and greatest\r\nof the Hindu kingdoms of Southern India did not succumb to the sword of\r\nIslam till 1565, and the splendid ruins of Vijianagar bear out, if we\r\nmake allowance for oriental hyperbole, the contemporary testimony of a\r\nPersian Ambassador that \"the pupil of the eye has never seen a place\r\nlike it and the ear of intelligence has never been informed that there\r\nexisted anything to equal it in the whole world.\" The Moslem conquerors\r\nlaid Vijianagar low. But, by the curious irony of fortune, it was from a\r\ndescendant of its royal house, some remnants of which escaped\r\ndestruction, that the British, by whom Mahomedan domination was to be in\r\nturn overthrown, received their first grant of land on the Carnatic\r\ncoast close to where Madras now stands.\r\n\r\nMahomedan domination came so late to Southern India and lasted for such\r\na brief period that it never disturbed, even to the small extent that it\r\ndid in Northern India, the social stratifications of Hinduism, which\r\nhave equally withstood there more than anywhere else the subtler\r\npressure of Western civilisation under British rule. Take, for instance,\r\na small town like Tirupati, only a few miles from Chatnagiri, where the\r\nRajahs, whose forebears made that momentous grant to Francis Day a\r\nlittle less than three centuries ago, still live in modest state. Were\r\nTirupati still ruled by the Vijianagar kings in all their splendour, it\r\ncould hardly present a better-preserved picture of ancient Hindu life.\r\nAt the foot of a steep range of hills crowned with venerable temples\r\nwhose sanctity has from times immemorial attracted a constant stream of\r\npilgrims, and possessing some famous temples of its own, it is\r\nessentially a Brahman town, and lives almost entirely by ministering, at\r\nmore or less extortionate rates, to the material and spiritual needs of\r\npilgrims, averaging about a thousand a day in ordinary times and scores\r\nof thousands at the special festival seasons, on their way to and from\r\nthe sacred hill-top. There are whole streets of lodgings for their use,\r\nconsisting chiefly of small bare cubicles, and rows of shops at which\r\nthey can purchase their simple vegetarian food and innumerable religious\r\ntrifles as mementoes of their pilgrimage. When I approached Tirupati,\r\nearly in the morning, a few groups of pilgrims were already on their way\r\nto the hill-sanctuaries and peasants were starting work on the temple\r\nlands outside the town. Sacred monkeys gambolled about the trees and\r\nstill more sacred cows had begun to exercise their daily privilege of\r\nbrowsing for food wherever their fancy leads them, even amongst the\r\nvegetables exposed for sale in the public market-places. The Brahmans\r\nthemselves were still engaged in performing their elaborate morning\r\ndevotions and ablutions, but the members of their household had already\r\nswept the approach to their low, one-storied, flat-roofed houses and\r\nstencilled on the threshold with white liquid chalk the geomantic\r\npatterns, finished off with scattered marigolds, which keep away the\r\nevil spirits. The Brahman quarters surround the temples, of which of\r\ncourse only the outer courtyards are accessible to other than high-caste\r\nHindus. The low-caste \"untouchables,\" who do the menial work of the\r\ntown, live strictly segregated in their own quarter, which consists only\r\nof mud huts and even flimsier shelters of platted palm-leaves and\r\nbamboos. The whole town wore an air of leisured superiority as if\r\nconscious that there can be no need for special effort when the gods\r\nbring pilgrims to provide for the wants of its \"twice-born\" inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThere are scores of other Tirupatis in which the Brahman still reigns\r\nsupreme by virtue of his _quasi_-sacerdotal caste. But in the public\r\nlife of Southern India, as British rule has moulded it, he has owed a\r\npre-eminence only recently disputed to a monopoly of Western education\r\nin modern times almost as complete as the monopoly which he enjoyed of\r\nHindu learning and culture before the advent of the British. As soon as\r\nhe saw that the British _Raj_ threatened no curtailment of his\r\nhereditary supremacy in the religious and social world of Hinduism, he\r\nwas quick to profit by all the material advantages which the country as\r\na whole derived from a new era of public security and peace. He realised\r\nat once that Western education might open up for him opportunities of\r\nmaking himself almost as indispensable, if on a somewhat humbler scale,\r\nto the alien rulers of India as he had formerly made himself to the\r\nindigenous rulers in the land. Thus the Brahmans acquired from the first\r\na virtual monopoly of all the subordinate public services in the Madras\r\nPresidency and, as time went on, of all the higher posts gradually\r\nthrown open to Indians. They crowded also into all the new liberal\r\nprofessions fostered by Western education, and, above all, into the\r\nlegal profession for which they showed, as most Indians do, a very\r\nspecial aptitude. But, like all monopolists, they were tempted to abuse\r\ntheir monopoly, the more so as they regarded it merely as a legitimate\r\nadaptation to the new conditions imported by British rule of the ancient\r\nprivileges always vested in their caste. They resented any attempt on\r\nthe part of Hindus belonging to inferior castes to follow in their\r\nfootsteps along the new paths of Western learning and to qualify for a\r\nshare of employment in the public services, for which under the British\r\ndispensation all Indians are entitled to compete on equal terms\r\nirrespective of all caste discriminations. The non-Brahmans were slow to\r\nstart, and when they did start, they had to contend with the jealous\r\nopposition of the Brahmans, who combined, as Hindu castes know how to\r\ncombine, against unwelcome intruders into a profitable field of which\r\nthey had secured early possession. When the Public Services Commission\r\nwas in Madras eight years ago, we heard many bitter complaints from\r\nnon-Brahmans that, whenever one of them did succeed in getting an\r\nappointment under Government, the Brahmans with whom or under whom he\r\nhad to work would at once unite to drive him out, either by making his\r\nlife intolerable or by turning against him the European superior to\r\nwhose ear they had easy access. For it is one of the weaknesses of an\r\nalien bureaucracy that, in regard to routine work at least, its weaker\r\nmembers are apt to be far too much in the hands of their native\r\nassistants. The Brahmans later on formed the bulk of the new\r\nWestern-educated and \"politically-minded\" class, and the Madrasee\r\nBrahmans played a considerable part in the Indian National Congress\r\nbefore it broke away from its constitutional moorings.\r\n\r\nThe non-Brahmans, nevertheless, under the leadership of such resolute\r\nmen as the late Dr. Nair, fought their way steadily to the front, and,\r\nbeing of course in a large majority, they had only to organise in order\r\nto make full use of the opportunity which a relatively democratic\r\nfranchise afforded them for the first time at the recent elections. They\r\ncan hardly themselves have foreseen how great their opportunity was, for\r\nthey regarded the reforms at first with deep suspicion as calculated\r\nmerely to transfer substantive power from a British to a Brahman\r\nbureaucracy, and so deep was their dread of Brahman ascendancy even in\r\nthe new Councils that they clamoured to the very end for a much larger\r\nnumber of seats than the sixteen that were ultimately reserved as\r\n\"communal\" seats for non-Brahman electorates. They never needed such a\r\nreservation, for they actually carried the day in so many of the\r\n\"general\" constituencies that out of ninety-eight elected members of the\r\nnew Provincial Council only fourteen are Brahmans, and it is the\r\nBrahmans now who complain, not without reason, that their representation\r\nfalls short of their legitimate influence in the State, and are already\r\ndemanding a reservation of \"communal\" seats for their own caste in\r\nfuture. Lord Willingdon, as a constitutional Governor, chose from the\r\nnon-Brahman majority in the Council all the three Indian Ministers who\r\nform part of the new Provincial Government and preside over the\r\n\"transferred\" departments. This is the most startling transformation\r\nscene which any of the Provincial elections has produced. The\r\nnon-Brahmans have got the chance which they have long claimed. If they\r\nrise to the occasion, deal with the Brahmans more fairly than the latter\r\ndealt with them, and, remembering the struggle they have had for their\r\nown emancipation, help the \"untouchables\" to rise in their turn out of\r\nthe state of degradation to which centuries of Brahman domination have\r\ncondemned them, the reforms may prove to have been perhaps as important\r\na landmark in the moral regeneration of Hindu society as in the\r\ndevelopment of the Indian body politic. For, though it would be unfair\r\nto forget that the rigidity of the great caste system probably alone\r\nsaved Hindu society from complete disintegration during centuries of\r\ninternal anarchy and foreign invasions, its survival would be fatal now\r\nto the advancement of India on new lines of democratic progress. In any\r\ncase the triumph of the non-Brahmans is an unmistakable blow to\r\n\"Non-co-operation.\" Their one grievance against British rule has\r\nhitherto been that it tolerated Brahman ascendancy and refused to\r\nco-operate with them in their passionate struggle against it. But now\r\nthere is nothing to damp their zeal or deter them from co-operating with\r\nGovernment in securing the permanent success of the reforms to which, as\r\nthey have to admit in spite of their former suspicions, they owe a\r\nmeasure of political advancement that far exceeds all their\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\nIn Southern as well as in Northern India the failure of the\r\nNon-co-operationists' frontal attack on the reforms was beyond dispute.\r\nThey were resolved to kill them in the womb by laying an interdict upon\r\nthe elections to the new popular assemblies. No candidate, Mr. Gandhi\r\nhad pronounced, was to enter for election, no elector was to record his\r\nvote. At a moment when the elections were already in progress and should\r\nhave at least tempered his optimism, he himself assured me that the\r\nresults as a whole would yet afford a most splendid demonstration of the\r\nstern temper of the people that would never trust and would never accept\r\nthe mockery of reforms proceeding from a \"Satanic\" Government. He was\r\ndeaf to my suggestion that, even if the temper of the Indian people was\r\nsuch as he believed it to be, it would have been demonstrated in a\r\nmanner far more intelligible to the political mind of the West had his\r\nfollowers taken part in the elections, and, after sweeping the board in\r\naccordance with his anticipations, had then placed their demands,\r\nwhatever they might be, on record before the world, declaring at the\r\nsame time that, unless they were fully granted, they would walk out of\r\nevery Council Chamber in India and bring down the whole edifice of\r\nreforms, which would then indeed have been hopelessly shattered. Things,\r\non the contrary, went quite differently. In defiance of Mr. Gandhi,\r\ncandidates came forward in almost every constituency, elections were\r\nheld everywhere, and except for a few insignificant disturbances created\r\nby his followers they were held in peaceful and orderly fashion. There\r\nwere indeed numerous and in some places very large abstentions. That\r\nmany of those who kept away from the polls were convinced\r\n\"Non-co-operationists\" cannot be denied, but no more can it be denied\r\nthat many kept away from fear, not altogether unjustified by the event,\r\nof actual violence or of the more insidious forms of intimidation which\r\nsocial and religious pressure assumes with particularly deadly effect in\r\nIndia. Reputable members, including a large proportion of the leaders\r\nwho had fought for years past the battle of India's political\r\nadvancement, took their seats in the Provincial Councils and in the\r\nAll-India Legislature at Delhi. They represented, not unfairly on the\r\nwhole, all classes and creeds and communities, and even all schools of\r\npolitical thought, except, of course, the Extremists, who by their own\r\ndefault remained unrepresented. That the Extremists, whose influence\r\ncannot be ignored, should have remained unrepresented is not a matter\r\nentirely for congratulation, for the complete exclusion, even when\r\nself-inflicted, of any important political party must tend to weaken the\r\nauthority of a popular Assembly. At the same time, it may be doubted\r\nwhether the abstention of \"Non-co-operationists\" has deprived the Indian\r\nCouncils of more than a very few individuals whose ability and\r\ncharacter, apart from their political opinions, would have given them\r\nany great weight. The splendid demonstration which Mr. Gandhi had\r\ncontemplated fell completely flat because an overwhelming proportion of\r\nthose to whom he directed his appeal refused to endorse his view that\r\nthe great constitutional changes of which the creation of popular\r\nAssemblies was the corner-stone were merely a snare and a delusion, and\r\nto his cry of \"Non-co-operation\" they opposed an emphatic affirmation of\r\ntheir belief that the salvation of India lay in co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH OF AN INDIAN PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly twelve years ago Lord Morley, with all his advanced liberalism and\r\nhis broad sympathy for Indian aspirations, could not conceive the\r\npossibility of introducing Parliamentary institutions into India in his\r\ntime or for generations to come. He would assuredly have had to revise\r\nhis opinion could he have attended the first session of the Indian\r\nLegislative Assembly. In form its proceedings were not unworthy of a\r\ngreat Parliamentary Assembly. The speeches sometimes rose to a high\r\nlevel of eloquence all the more noteworthy in that English was not the\r\nmother tongue of those who delivered them. They were, as a rule, sober\r\nand dignified, and if all members did not at once abandon a habit much\r\nfavoured in the old Councils of putting long strings of questions and\r\nmoving impracticable resolutions in sonorous harangues, often prepared\r\nfor them by outside hacks, their own colleagues soon taught them that\r\nsuch methods were no longer likely to pay even for purposes of\r\nadvertisement. The majority quickly acquired a knack of suppressing\r\nwind-bags and bores quietly and effectively. The Act of 1919 reserved to\r\nGovernment the appointment of the President of the Assembly for the\r\nfirst four years, after which he will be chosen by the Assembly itself.\r\nNot even the House of Commons could treat the Chair with more unfailing\r\ndeference than the Assembly showed to Mr. A.F. Whyte, who brought with\r\nhim the prestige of Westminster traditions and experience to which he\r\nfrom time to time appealed aptly and successfully, and the Assembly\r\nappreciated the tact as well as the firmness with which he discharged\r\nhis novel duties. A gentle reminder of what was the usual practice in\r\nthe House of Commons was never lost on Indian members whose inexperience\r\noccasionally failed to realise the Parliamentary implications of the\r\nprocedure adopted by them, but was always ready to accept guidance that\r\nderived its authority from the wisdom of the Mother of Parliaments.\r\n\r\nBut the qualities shown by the Assembly transcended mere matters of\r\nform. Mr. Whyte bore testimony at the close of the session to debates\r\n\"well worthy to stand by the side of the best debates in the Imperial\r\nParliament.\" It was no empty compliment, for they revealed the makings\r\nof real statesmanship, and the circumstances in which the Indian\r\nLegislature met for the first time to give collective expression to the\r\nfeelings of the people of India, called for statesmanship. The\r\nKing-Emperor's message impressed them with a sense of the great\r\nresponsibilities and great opportunities arising for them out of the\r\nfar-reaching rights conferred upon them. The personal appeal with which\r\nthe Duke of Connaught accompanied the delivery of the Royal message went\r\nfar to dispel \"the shadow of Amritsar,\" which had, in his own apt\r\nphrase, \"lengthened over the face of India\" and threatened even to\r\ndarken their own path. For on no subject had Indian feeling been more\r\nunanimous during the elections all over the country than in regard to\r\nthe Punjab tragedy. None had been more persistently exploited by the\r\n\"Non-co-operationists\" to point their jibes at the \"slave-mentality\" of\r\ncandidates and electors who were merely the willing dupes of a \"Satanic\"\r\nGovernment. On no subject did the Assembly feel itself under a greater\r\nobligation to give expression to the unanimous sentiments of the people\r\nit represented--all the greater indeed in that opportunity of expression\r\nhad been denied to the old Legislative Council. It was the acid test to\r\nwhich the sincerity and the whole value of the reforms were put. The\r\natmosphere of the Assembly was never again so tense as when the crucial\r\ndebate was opened by one of the ablest of the younger members of the\r\nModerate party, Mr. Jamnadas Dwarkadas, from Bombay, on the\r\nadministration of martial law in the Punjab in 1919. He asked the\r\nGovernment (1) to declare its adhesion to the principle of equal\r\npartnership for Indian and European in the British Empire; (2) to\r\nexpress regret that martial law in the Punjab violated this fundamental\r\nprinciple; (3) to administer deterrent punishment to officers guilty of\r\nan improper exercise of their powers including the withdrawal of their\r\npensions; (4) to assure itself that adequate compensation is awarded to\r\nthose who lost their relatives at the Jallianwala Bagh and elsewhere.\r\nThe speaker moved his Resolution with great firmness and power but also\r\nwith great self-restraint. Most of the Indian speeches in support of it\r\nwere conceived in much the same spirit, though now and again one got a\r\nglimpse of angrier passions just beneath the surface. Happily the\r\nGovernment of India responded for the first time with the frankness and\r\ngenerosity which, had it displayed them in a much earlier stage in its\r\nhandling of the Punjab troubles, would have averted many of the worst\r\nconsequences. By reprobating, either implicitly or explicitly, the worst\r\nabuses of martial law the Home member, Sir William Vincent, the\r\nCommander-in-chief, Lord Rawlinson, and Sir Godfrey Fell on behalf of\r\nthe army administration, succeeded in persuading the Assembly that not\r\nonly were methods of humiliation and terrorism absolutely repugnant to\r\nall traditions of British rule, but that the censure and punishment\r\nalready inflicted upon officers and officials were in reality far more\r\nserious and effective than the Indian mind had been wont to believe.\r\nIndian members were asked to realise that for a British officer a broken\r\ncareer is virtually the end of life, and Sir Godfrey Fell had no need to\r\nmention General Dyer's name when he said, \"As it was put to me the other\r\nday by a very distinguished general officer, to leave the army in these\r\ncircumstances would be to many officers a disgrace worse than death.\"\r\nGovernment finally accepted the Resolution as it had been moved with the\r\nexception of the third clause asking for further punishment--a question\r\nwhich it was not prepared nor in a position to reopen. With the eager\r\napproval of a great many of his Indian colleagues the mover withdrew\r\nthat clause and the rest of the Resolution was passed unanimously and,\r\nbe it noted, with the support of every European member of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was thus cleared before the Assembly approached another\r\nand only less delicate question. Some time before the Budget disclosed\r\nthe heavy military expenditure to be defrayed out of Indian revenues,\r\nthe recommendations of the Committee appointed under the presidency of\r\nLord Esher to inquire into the administration and organisation of the\r\narmy in India had caused widespread alarm. There were peculiar\r\ncircumstances connected with the Committee's Report which were\r\ncalculated to excite Indian suspicion. The first part, which laid down\r\nthe general principles in regard to organisation and administration, was\r\ndrawn up in London and received the approval of the Secretary of State\r\nfor India before the British members of the Committee proceeded to\r\nIndia, where their Indian colleagues for the first time joined them,\r\nwhilst the President, Lord Esher, himself never went to India at all. To\r\ncarry out these principles the Report stated that \"the centre of gravity\r\nof probable military operations has shifted from West to East. In the\r\nfuture we must contemplate the possibility of our armies operating in\r\nthe Middle East based partially in India and partially at home.... India\r\nhas now been admitted into partnership with the Empire, and the Indian\r\nArmy has fought alongside of troops from other parts of the Empire in\r\nevery theatre of war. Its responsibilities have thus been greatly\r\nwidened, and it can no longer be regarded as a local force whose sphere\r\nof activity is limited to India and the surrounding frontier\r\nterritories. It must rather be treated as a part of the Imperial Army\r\nready to serve in any part of the world.\" Indians interpreted the Report\r\nas an attempt on the part of the British War Office to throw upon the\r\nIndian Exchequer the cost of a larger army than would be required merely\r\nfor Indian defence whilst keeping it under its own control for\r\nemployment at the discretion of British Ministers far beyond the\r\nfrontiers of India. Official assurances were given both in India and at\r\nhome that an exaggerated construction had been placed on the meaning of\r\nthe Report, to which, moreover, neither the British Government nor the\r\nGovernment of India was officially committed, and that in any case\r\nIndian troops would not be required to serve outside India except with\r\nthe consent of the Government of India. These assurances did not prevent\r\nthe Assembly from passing two Resolutions in which it embodied its\r\nstrong protests. The second part of the Report, containing practical\r\nrecommendations for the reorganisation of the Indian Army, and alone\r\nbased on the results of the inquiry actually conducted in India, was far\r\nless criticised.\r\n\r\nThe army estimates themselves would have been enough to cause dismay\r\neven if the estimates of other departments, upon which the Indian public\r\nlooks with more favour, had not clearly been pruned down with more than\r\nusual parsimony to meet the large increase in military expenditure. But\r\nLord Rawlinson, who had done his utmost to reduce them to the extreme\r\nlimit of safety as he conceived it in existing circumstances, wisely\r\ndecided to take the Assembly as far as possible into his confidence, and\r\nto explain the requirements of the military situation not only from his\r\nseat on the Government bench but in private conferences, at which\r\nmembers were freely invited to meet him and his advisers. If he did not\r\naltogether convince them, he gave them food for reflection at a time\r\nwhen not only our own North-West Frontier but the whole of Central Asia\r\nis still in a state of turmoil, Persia a very doubtful quantity, and the\r\nAmeer of Afghanistan far more eager to sign a treaty of alliance with\r\nSoviet Russia than to bring to a friendly conclusion the long-drawn\r\nnegotiations which the Government of India has sent the head of its\r\nforeign department to conduct at Kabul. The appointment of a Committee\r\nto visit the North-West Frontier and to study the situation on the spot\r\nwas admirably calculated to carry the practical education of Indian\r\nlegislators a long step farther. In regard to other matters, too,\r\nGovernment gave and gained time for reflection by referring them, before\r\ncommitting itself to any definite pronouncement of policy, to special\r\ncommittees in which points at issue could be thrashed out much more\r\neffectively and with less heat than if only discussed in full house.\r\n\r\nNothing, however, could alter the awkward fact that Government had been\r\ncompelled to confront the Legislative Assembly at its first session with\r\na Budget showing a deficit and making calls upon the Indian tax-payer\r\nabsolutely unprecedented in the annals of British-Indian State finance.\r\nThe deficit amounted to nearly 19 crores of rupees on a Budget of 130\r\ncrores,[3] and the Financial Member, Mr. Hailey, who had only recently\r\nsucceeded to the financial department, had to admit that the deficit\r\ncould only be met by increased taxation. That the estimates of the\r\nprevious year had been so largely exceeded was due beyond dispute to the\r\ngrowth of military expenditure, which, for the current financial year,\r\nhas been put down at 62 crores, or very nearly half the total\r\nexpenditure for which provision has to be made. This Budget, moreover,\r\nnot only came at a time of general economic depression, but coincided\r\nwith the operation of the new financial arrangements between the\r\nProvinces and the Government of India, which have deprived the latter of\r\nthe facilities it had formerly for mitigating its own financial\r\nnecessities by adjusting to them the doles paid out of the Central\r\nExchequer to the several Provincial Exchequers. Under the new system\r\nvarious revenues have been definitely allocated to the Provincial\r\nGovernments for their own free disposal, and in return they have to make\r\nfixed annual contributions to the Central Exchequer. These contributions\r\nare in no case to be subject to increase in the future, but on the\r\ncontrary to be reduced gradually and to cease at the earliest possible\r\nmoment compatible with the irreducible requirements of the Government of\r\nIndia. The Act of 1919, it is true, transfers to the Indian Legislature\r\nno direct or complete statutory control over revenue and expenditure,\r\nand powers are still vested in the Government of India to override the\r\nAssembly in cases of emergency and to enact supplies which it refuses if\r\nthe Governor-General in Council certifies them to be essential to the\r\npeace, tranquillity, and interests of India. But the fact that there was\r\na deficit which could only be met by increased taxation offered\r\nexceptional opportunities which might easily have been used for\r\nembarrassing obstruction by a young and immature chamber naturally\r\nconcerned for its own popularity. Even a direct conflict between the\r\nGovernment and the Assembly might not have been impossible, and the\r\nconsequences would have been lamentable. For if the Government of India\r\nhad been driven to use its statutory powers to impose taxation and\r\nsecure supplies in opposition to the Legislature during its very first\r\nsession, all the hopes of friendly co-operation based on the new\r\nconstitution would have been wrecked far more disastrously and\r\npermanently than by any \"Non-co-operation\" movement. The Legislative\r\nAssembly was wise enough to exercise its rights with sufficient\r\ninsistence to show that it was conscious of them, but never to strain\r\nthem. It did not refrain from criticism of almost every department in\r\nturn or from motions to reduce the official estimates for them. Many of\r\nthe criticisms were sound, and some of the reductions were accepted by\r\nGovernment. Mr. Hailey handled a delicate situation with unfailing\r\npatience and skill. Even in regard to new taxation he endeavoured to\r\nmeet, as far as the exigencies of the Budget allowed, the objections of\r\nthe Assembly to such increases as, for instance, higher postal rates,\r\nwhich press most heavily on the least well-to-do classes. Nothing,\r\nhowever, helped him so much to get his Budget through without a serious\r\nconflict as the decision of the Government to seek in an increase of the\r\nimport duties over two-thirds of the new revenue to be raised to meet\r\nthe deficit. For there Government took up common ground with Indian\r\nopinion on fiscal matters and carried into effect the principle laid\r\ndown by the Select Joint Committee on the Reforms Bill, and endorsed by\r\nthe Secretary of State, that the Government of India must be granted the\r\nsame liberty to devise Indian tariff arrangements on a consideration of\r\nIndian interests as all other self-governing parts of the Empire enjoy.\r\nIf the Assembly did not see altogether eye to eye with Government as to\r\nthe necessity for all this increased expenditure and increased taxation,\r\nits objections were at least mitigated by a form of increased taxation\r\nin which it saw the first step towards fiscal autonomy. In this as in\r\nevery other question with which the Legislature had to deal, the\r\nGovernment of India showed its willingness to accept as far as possible\r\nthe guidance of Indian opinion and to act as a national Indian\r\nGovernment, and not merely as the supreme executive authority under the\r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOn those terms the Assembly was prepared to take into account the\r\ndifficulties and responsibilities inherited by Government from past\r\npolicies from which no sudden departure was possible, or desired even,\r\nby responsible Indians who recognise the present limitations of their\r\nexperience as well as of their rights. Government and Legislature\r\ntherefore parted in mutual goodwill and with increased confidence in the\r\nvalue of the new policy of co-operation. But the Legislature has only\r\njust commenced to realise the extent of its powers, expressed and\r\nimplied. The latter stretch almost immeasurably farther than the\r\nformer. Indian-elected members form a large majority in the Legislative\r\nAssembly, which has already so largely overshadowed the Council of State\r\nthat it will probably be difficult for the upper house to exercise over\r\nthe more popular chamber the corrective influence originally\r\ncontemplated. The Government of India, of course, retains its great\r\nstatutory powers, but these could hardly be exercised again in\r\nuncompromising opposition to the opinion of the majority of the Assembly\r\nnow that out of eight members of the Viceroy's Executive Council, which,\r\nwith him, forms the Government of India, no less than three are Indians,\r\nwho would presumably be often more amenable than their British\r\ncolleagues to the pressure of Indian opinion. Under the Act of 1919 the\r\nGovernment of India is not responsible to the Assembly. That may come in\r\na later stage, it has not come yet. But one may rest already assured\r\nthat only in extreme cases, and if the majority shows itself far more\r\nirresponsible than it has yet given the slightest reason to fear, is\r\nGovernment likely to risk a cleavage between British and Indian members\r\nof the Viceroy's Executive Council, or to rely on the fact that no vote\r\nof the Assembly can remove it from office, to provoke or face a conflict\r\nof which the consequences would extend far beyond the walls of the\r\nLegislature. This is a powerful lever of which Indians may quickly learn\r\nthe use.\r\n\r\nIn another important direction the first session of the Legislature bore\r\nout Sir Thomas Munro's view, expressed, as we have already seen, a\r\nhundred years ago, that in India as elsewhere liberal treatment will be\r\nfound the most effectual way of elevating the character of the people.\r\nNothing perhaps has tended more to alienate the sympathies of Englishmen\r\nfrom the political aspirations which the founders of the Indian National\r\nCongress were bent upon promoting than the subordination of social to\r\npolitical reforms. There remained always some distinguished Indians who\r\nensued both--notably Mr. Gokhale, who founded the society of \"the\r\nServants of India,\" dedicated chiefly to social reform, of which the\r\nbeneficent activities have expanded steadily throughout a decade of\r\npolitical turmoil. His mantle fell on no unworthy shoulders, and it is a\r\ngood omen that his chief disciple, Mr. Srinivasa Sastri, has become the\r\nleader of the Moderate party in the Council of State, as well as one of\r\nthe Indian representatives at the recent Imperial Conference in London.\r\nA similar spirit informs the numerous associations that have addressed\r\nthemselves, though with perhaps less success so far, to the more glaring\r\nevils of the Hindu religious social system, such as infant marriage, the\r\nprohibition of re-marriage of widows, the rigidity of caste laws in\r\nregard to inter-caste marriage, and to intercourse between the different\r\ncastes even at meals. Many interesting experiments have been made by\r\nIndians for infusing into education a new moral tone and discipline on\r\nIndian lines, and it is due to Indian effort no less than to the\r\nencouragement of Government that female education has begun to bridge\r\nover the intellectual gulf that tended to separate more and more the men\r\nand the women of the Western-educated classes. In Madras, to quote only\r\none instance, there is to-day a high school for girls--almost\r\nunthinkable two decades ago and only opened ten years ago--in which\r\nhigh-caste Brahman girls live under the same roof and are taught in the\r\nsame class-rooms as not only Hindu girls of the non-Brahman castes, but\r\nMahomedan and native Christian and Eurasian girls from all parts of the\r\nPresidency, and the only real difficulty now experienced is in the\r\ntraditional matter of food, and it is circumvented, if not overcome, by\r\nproviding seven different kitchens and seven different messes.\r\n\r\nThe last attempt on the part of the Government to promote social reforms\r\nby way of legislation was Lord Lansdowne's \"Age of Consent\" Bill thirty\r\nyears ago, and though it was carried through in spite of the violent\r\nopposition of Hindu orthodoxy, which then brought Mr. Tilak into public\r\nlife as its leader, an alien Government pledged to complete neutrality\r\nin social and religious matters shrank after that unpleasant experience\r\nfrom assuming the lead in such matters without having at least the\r\npreponderating bulk of Indian opinion behind it. Not the least\r\nnoteworthy event of the first session of the Indian Legislature was the\r\nintroduction by Dr. Gour, a Hindu member from the Central Provinces, of\r\na private Bill legalising civil marriage which British Indian law so far\r\nrecognises only between a Christian and a non-Christian, though the\r\nIndian States of Baroda and Indore have legalised them for all their\r\nsubjects. Sir Henry Maine wished to move, as far back as 1868, in this\r\ndirection when he was Law Member of the Government of India, but to meet\r\neven then a fierce orthodox opposition the provisions of the Bill\r\nfinally enacted in 1872 were so whittled down as to make it practically\r\nuseless, and it was almost nullified when it came up for interpretation\r\nby the Privy Council. The question does in fact involve many material as\r\nwell as social and religious considerations, as matters of personal law\r\nare largely governed by ancient custom in the different communities, and\r\nthe point at issue was whether it is possible for a Hindu to cease to be\r\nsubject to Hindu law. More recent attempts to make civil marriage lawful\r\nhave failed hopelessly. Dr. Gour has had the courage to appeal to the\r\nmore liberal spirit for which the new reforms stand, and he defended his\r\nBill, which is only a permissive Bill, on the grounds that any measure\r\ncalculated to break down the ancient barriers between races and creeds\r\nand communities must tend to strengthen the sense of national solidarity\r\nof which the new Indian Legislature is the expression. It remains yet to\r\nbe seen what will be the fate of his Bill, but its introduction is in\r\nitself not one of the least hopeful signs of the times.\r\n\r\nIf one turns from the Government of India to the new Provincial\r\nGovernments and Councils the outlook is, on the whole, not less\r\nencouraging. The statutory powers of the Provincial Councils are more\r\ndefinite and can be brought more directly to bear upon Government, but\r\nthey are not likely to be exercised in any extravagant fashion until\r\ntime has shown how Indian Ministers discharge their responsibilities to\r\nthe Councils and how the two wings of the new Provincial Governments\r\nwork together. In fact, the policy, wisely adopted by Provincial\r\nGovernors, of treating the two wings of their Government as equally\r\nassociated with them in a common task of governance, has robbed the\r\ndistinction between \"reserved\" and \"transferred\" subjects, if not of all\r\nreality, at any rate of the invidious appearance of discrimination which\r\nmight otherwise have attached to the word \"dyarchy.\" As one Provincial\r\nGovernor remarked to me, \"We are in reality skipping the dyarchy stage.\"\r\nIndian Ministers, kept fully informed and drawn into consultation on all\r\nsubjects, are learning to understand the difficulties of government and\r\nadministration of which, as outside critics, they had little notion, and\r\nto value the experience and knowledge which their European colleagues\r\nand subordinates freely place at their disposal, whilst the latter\r\nbenefit both from hearing the Indian point of view and from having to\r\nexplain and justify their own. Economic depression and financial\r\nstringency cannot, however, but react unfavourably upon the new system\r\nin the Provinces as well as at Delhi, for all the more practical reforms\r\nin which the ordinary Indian elector, whether politically minded or\r\notherwise, is most closely interested, and for which he has been looking\r\nto the new Provincial Councils, require money, and a great deal of\r\nmoney. There is a universal demand for more elementary schools, more\r\nroad-making, more sanitation, a more strenuous fight against malaria, a\r\ngreater extension of local government and village councils' activities,\r\nand the demand cannot be met except by more expenditure. The Indian\r\nMinisters and Indian members of the Provincial Councils have to face\r\nunpopularity whether by postponing much-needed reforms or by imposing\r\nnew taxation in order to carry them out. A great many of the best men\r\nhave naturally been attracted to Delhi, but though the proceedings in\r\nthe Provincial Councils have more frequently betrayed impatience and\r\ninexperience, and sometimes required the monitory intervention of the\r\nGovernor, they have played on the whole creditably the important part\r\nallotted to them in this great constitutional experiment.\r\n\r\nIt is far less easy to appraise the value of the attempt which has been\r\nmade at the same time to bring that large part of India which lies\r\noutside the sphere of direct British administration into closer touch\r\nwith it by the creation of a Chamber of Princes, which will at least sit\r\nunder the same roof with the Council of State and the Legislative\r\nAssembly in the great hall of Parliament to be erected in New Delhi. The\r\nmoment when the Government of India is departing from its autocratic\r\ntraditions and transferring a large part of its powers throughout\r\nBritish India into the hands of representative assemblies which are to\r\npave the way towards the democratic goal of responsible government,\r\nseems scarcely well chosen for the creation of a Chamber which must give\r\ngreater cohesion, and potentially greater power to resist the spirit of\r\nthe age, to a body of ruling Princes and Chiefs who all stand in varying\r\ndegrees for archaic forms of despotic government and whose peoples have\r\nfor the most part stood hitherto entirely outside the political life of\r\nBritish India.\r\n\r\nThe Native States, as they are commonly called, scattered over nearly\r\nthe whole length and breadth of the Indian Empire, cover altogether more\r\nthan a third of its total area and include nearly a quarter of its total\r\npopulation. Some of them can compare in size and wealth with the smaller\r\nStates of Europe. Some are but insignificant specks on the map. Great\r\nand small, there are several hundreds of them. Their relations with the\r\nParamount Power, which have been not inaptly described as those of\r\nsubordinate alliance, are governed by treaties and engagements of which\r\nthe terms are not altogether uniform. The essence is in all cases the\r\nmaintenance of their administrative autonomy under their own dynastic\r\nrulers whose hereditary rights and privileges are permanently guaranteed\r\nto them, subject to their loyalty to the British Crown and to reasonably\r\ngood government. The Princes and Chiefs who rule over them--some well, a\r\nfew rather badly, most of them perhaps indifferently; some Hindus, some\r\nMahomedans; some still very conservative and almost mediaeval, some on\r\ngenuinely progressive lines; some with a mere veneer of European\r\nmodernity--are all equally jealous of their rights and their dignity.\r\nThe Native States cannot, however, live wholly in water-tight\r\ncompartments. They must be more or less directly affected by what goes\r\non in British India just across their own often very artificial\r\nboundaries. Their material interests are too closely bound up with those\r\nof their British-Indian neighbours. In many matters, _e.g._ railways,\r\nposts, telegraphs, irrigation, etc., they are in a great measure\r\ndependent upon, and must fall into line with, British India. Their\r\npeoples--even those who do not go to British India for their education\r\nor for larger opportunities of livelihood--are being slowly influenced\r\nby the currents of thought which flow in from British India.\r\n\r\nPolitical unrest cannot always or permanently be halted at their\r\nfrontier, though His Exalted Highness the Nizam of Hyderabad, whose ways\r\nare still largely those of the Moghuls, has not hesitated, albeit\r\nhimself a Mahomedan Prince, to proscribe all _Khilafat_ agitation within\r\nhis territory. The Extremist Press has already very frequently denounced\r\nruling Princes and Chiefs as obstacles to the democratic evolution of a\r\n_Swaraj_ India which will have to be removed, and if the Nagpur Congress\r\npronounced against extending its propaganda to the Native States, it did\r\nso only \"for the present\" and on grounds of pure and avowed expediency.\r\nApart from the menace of Indian Extremism, there must obviously be a\r\nfundamental conflict of ideals between ruling Chiefs bent on preserving\r\ntheir independent political entity and the aspirations towards national\r\nunity entertained by the moderate Indian Nationalists whose influence is\r\nsure to predominate over all the old traditions of Indian governance if\r\nthe new reforms are successful. Some Princes are wise enough to swim\r\nwith the current and have introduced rudimentary councils and\r\nrepresentative assemblies which at any rate provide a modern façade for\r\ntheir own patriarchal systems of government. But all are more or less\r\nconscious that their own position is being profoundly modified by\r\nconstitutional changes in British India, which must, and indeed are\r\nintended to, alter the very character of the Government representing the\r\nParamount Power to whose authority they owe their own survival since the\r\nbeginning of British rule. Their survival has indeed always been an\r\nanomaly, though hitherto, on the whole, equally creditable to the\r\nBritish _Raj_ that preserved them from extinction in the old days of\r\nstress and storm and to the rulers who have justified British\r\nstatesmanship by their fine loyalty. But in a democratised and\r\nself-governing India it might easily become a much more palpable\r\nanomaly.\r\n\r\nHow was this new situation to be dealt with? Some of the ruling Princes\r\nand Chiefs whose views appear to have prevailed with the Secretary of\r\nState and the Government of India, came to the conclusion that they\r\nshould combine together and try to secure as a body a recognised\r\nposition from which their collective influence might be brought more\r\neffectively to bear upon the Government of India, whatever its new\r\norientation may ultimately be under the influence of popular assemblies\r\nin British India. Some, doubtless, believed that once in such a position\r\nthey would be able to oppose a more effective because more united front\r\nto interference from whatever quarter in the internal affairs of their\r\nStates. Circumstances favoured their scheme for the loyalty displayed by\r\nall the Native States, and the distinguished services rendered in person\r\nby not a few Chiefs inclined Government to meet their wishes without\r\nprobing them too closely, and in the first place to relax the control\r\nhitherto exercised by its political officers on the spot--often, it must\r\nbe confessed, on rather petty and irritating lines. The leading Princes\r\nwere encouraged to come to Delhi during the winter season, and those who\r\nfavoured a policy of closer combination amongst themselves were those\r\nwho responded most freely to these official promptings. Conversations\r\nsoon assumed the shape of informal conferences, and, later on, of formal\r\nconferences convened and presided over by the Viceroy. The hidden value\r\nof these conferences must have been far greater than would appear from\r\nthe somewhat trivial record of the subjects under discussion, for it is\r\nout of these conferences that the new Chamber of Princes has been\r\nevolved as a permanent consultative body for the consideration of\r\nquestions affecting the Native States generally, or of common concern to\r\nthem and to British India and to the Empire generally.\r\n\r\nThe conception is in itself by no means novel and appeals to many upon\r\nwhom the picturesqueness and conservative stability of the Native States\r\nexercise a strong attraction. It can be traced back at least as far as\r\nLord Lytton's Viceroyalty over forty years ago, and the steadily growing\r\nrecognition of the important part which the Native States play in the\r\nIndian Empire culminated during the war in the appointment of an Indian\r\nPrince to represent them specially at the Imperial War Conferences held\r\nin London during the war, and again, after the war was over, at the\r\nParis Peace Conference.\r\n\r\nBut the creation of a Chamber of Princes at this particular juncture\r\nraises very difficult issues. In the first place, though it has been\r\nengineered with great skill and energy by a small group of very\r\ndistinguished Princes, mostly Rajput, it is viewed with deep suspicion\r\nby other chiefs who, not being Rajputs, scent in it a scheme for\r\npromoting Rajput ascendancy, and it has received no support at all from\r\nother and more powerful Princes such as the Nizam of Hyderabad, the\r\nGaikwar of Baroda, the Maharajah of Mysore. Some have always held aloof\r\nfrom the Delhi Conferences and have intimated plainly that they have no\r\ndesire to see any alteration introduced into their treaty relationships\r\nwith the Paramount Power. Without their participation no Chamber of\r\nPrinces can pull its full weight, and even if most of them considered\r\nthemselves bound out of loyalty to the Sovereign to attend an inaugural\r\nceremony performed by the Duke of Connaught in the name of the\r\nKing-Emperor himself, it would be premature to infer that their\r\nopposition has been permanently overcome. The Supreme Government has of\r\ncourse reiterated the pledges already embodied in the treaties that\r\nthere shall be no interference with the ancient rights and privileges of\r\nthe Native States and their rulers, but its eminent right to interfere\r\nin cases of extreme urgency has not and cannot be surrendered. It has\r\nbeen exercised very rarely, and only when administration and government\r\nhave fallen flagrantly short of certain standards, established by usage\r\nand generally understood and accepted, which it is perhaps easier to\r\ndescribe negatively than positively. Misrule cannot be tolerated when it\r\namounts to a public scandal or takes the form of criminal acts. The\r\nwhole question has always bristled with difficulties, and still does.\r\nThe tendency, since Lord Curzon's time, has been to relax the control of\r\nthe Supreme Government even in matters of slighter moment on which it\r\nhad been accustomed to tender advice not always distinguishable from\r\ncommands. That some of the Native States, and not the least powerful,\r\nare badly governed is of common notoriety. But if the Supreme Government\r\nhas been sometimes inclined to turn a blind eye in such cases, and even\r\nto forget that it has moral obligations towards the subjects as well as\r\ntowards the rulers of the Native States, it has been free hitherto to\r\nobey considerations of political expediency which may conceivably not\r\nweigh so much in the future. For the same forces that have obtained the\r\nsurrender of the autocratic principle in British India, may demand with\r\nequal insistency its surrender throughout the Native States. Should the\r\nmore irresponsible chiefs rely on the solidarity of a Chamber of Princes\r\nto secure for them greater immunity than ever from the just consequences\r\nof misgovernment, they would merely hasten a conflict which undoubtedly\r\nmost of their caste have begun to dread between their own archaic\r\nmethods and the democratic spirit which the Government of India Act of\r\n1919 has quickened in British India.\r\n\r\nThere are many other thorny points. Obviously there could be no room for\r\nall the seven or eight hundred ruling chiefs, great and small, in any\r\nassembly reasonably constituted to represent the Native States. Nor have\r\nthey ever enjoyed any uniform status or received any uniform treatment.\r\nSome of them, the most important, have maintained direct relations with\r\nthe Government of India; the majority only indirect relations through\r\nthe Provincial Governments within whose sphere their territories are\r\nsituated. The creation of the Chamber of Princes has necessitated a new\r\nclassification of major and minor States, the former entitled to direct,\r\nthe latter only to indirect representation, which has naturally caused a\r\nvast amount of jealousy and heartburning. Another consequence still\r\nunder discussion is the substitution in most cases of direct relations\r\nwith the Government of India for those in which the smaller Native\r\nStates now stand to provincial governments. Such transfer must involve\r\ninnumerable difficulties and complications, especially in a Presidency\r\nlike Bombay, within whose boundaries there are over 300 Native States\r\ninextricably bound up with it by common interests and even by common\r\nadministrative needs. Many of them are at first sight inclined to\r\nwelcome such a transfer as enhancing their prestige; some of them,\r\nremembering the old saying that \"Delhi is a long way off,\" hope that it\r\nwill lessen the prospect of outside interference in their own\r\nadministration, however bad it may be or become. But these are hardly\r\narguments to justify a transfer which can only import a new element of\r\nconfusion into an already sufficiently confused situation.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Princes was opened with all the glitter of oriental pomp\r\nand magnificence, but it only held a few meetings and the proceedings\r\nwere veiled in secrecy. Only enough transpired to show that personal\r\njealousies and clan rivalries were rife even at that early stage. Its\r\nvery constitution denies it the assistance for which the Indian Councils\r\nand the Indian Ministers have been wise enough to look from the\r\nco-operation with them of British elements, whose authority in\r\ngovernment and administration is still maintained by statute and so far\r\nundisputed. To the Chamber of Princes the Viceroy alone is in a position\r\nto give guidance, and to shape that illustrious assembly to useful\r\npurposes is one of the many difficult tasks in front of Lord Reading.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] At the \"stabilised\" rate of exchange a crore, or ten million\r\nrupees = one million gold pounds sterling. One hundred lacs make a\r\ncrore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nECONOMIC FACTORS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the war has wrought great changes in the political life of India, in\r\nits status within the Empire and in its constitutional relations with\r\nthe United Kingdom, it has produced equally important changes in its\r\neconomic situation and outlook. The Montagu-Chelmsford Report had not\r\nfailed to note how largely economic factors entered into the political\r\nsituation which the Secretary of State and the Viceroy were primarily\r\nconcerned to study. India is, and probably must always remain,\r\nessentially an agricultural country, and its economics must always\r\nsuffer from the exceptionally unstable conditions to which, except\r\nwithin the relatively small areas available for irrigation, dependence\r\nupon a precarious rainfall condemns even the most industrious\r\nagricultural population. Many circumstances had combined to retard the\r\ndevelopment of its vast natural resources and the growth of modern\r\nmanufacturing industries. Few British administrators during the last\r\nhalf-century had realised their importance as Lord Dalhousie had done\r\nbefore the Mutiny, until Lord Curzon created a special department of\r\ncommerce and industry in the Government of India. The politically minded\r\nclasses, whose education had not trained them to deal with such\r\nquestions, were apt to lose themselves in such blind alleys as the\r\n\"doctrine of drain.\" But as they perceived how largely dependent India\r\nwas on foreign countries for manufactured goods, whilst her own\r\ndomestic industries had been to a great extent crushed in hopeless\r\ncompetition with the products of the much more highly organised and\r\nequipped industries of European countries, they rushed to the conclusion\r\nthat an industrial revival might be promoted by a crude boycott of\r\nforeign imported goods which would at the same time serve as a\r\nmanifestation of their political discontent. The _Swadeshi_ movement\r\nfailed, as it was bound to fail. But failure intensified the suspicion\r\nthat, as India's foreign trade was chiefly with the United Kingdom, her\r\nindustrial backwardness was deliberately encouraged in the interests of\r\nBritish manufactures, and it was not altogether unjustified by the\r\nmaintenance of the excise duty on locally manufactured cotton goods,\r\nwhich protected the interests of Lancashire in the one industrial field\r\nin which Indian enterprise had achieved greatest success. The\r\nintroduction of an annual Industrial Conference in connection with the\r\nIndian National Congress was the first organised attempt of the\r\npolitically minded classes to link up with politics a movement towards\r\nindustrial independence. It assumed increased bitterness with the\r\ndisastrous failures of Indian banks started on \"national\" lines in\r\nBombay and the Punjab. The cry for fiscal freedom and protection grew\r\nwidespread and insistent before the war broke out. Then, under the\r\npressure of war necessities, the Government of India explored, as it had\r\nnever done before, the whole field of India's natural resources and of\r\nthe development of Indian industries. At the same time an opportunity\r\narose for a group of Indian \"merchant-venturers\"--to use the term in its\r\nfine old Elizabethan sense--who had set themselves to give the lead to\r\ntheir countrymen, to show what Indian enterprise was capable of\r\nachieving. What it has already achieved deserves to be studied as the\r\nmost pregnant illustration of what the future may hold in reserve.\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat chastening reflection that the creation of the one\r\ngreat metallurgical industry in India has been due not to British but to\r\nIndian capital and enterprise, assisted in the earliest and most\r\ncritical stages not by British but by American skill, and that, had it\r\nnot been created when it was, our Syrian and Mesopotamian campaigns\r\ncould never have been fought to their victorious issue, as Jamsheedpur\r\nproduced and could alone at that juncture supply the rails for the\r\nconstruction of the railways essential to the rapid success of those\r\ngreat military operations. Equally chastening is the reflection that\r\nfrom its very inception less than twenty years ago, the pioneers of this\r\nvast undertaking had constantly to reckon with the indifference and\r\ninertia of Anglo-Indian officialdom, and with the almost solitary\r\nexceptions of Sir Thomas Holland, then at the head of the Geological\r\nSurvey, and Sir Benjamin Robertson, afterwards Chief Commissioner of the\r\nCentral Provinces where the first but unavailing explorations were made,\r\nseldom received more than a minimum of countenance and assistance. Not\r\ntill Messrs. Tata's American prospectors had explored this region did\r\nthe Government of India realise that untold mineral wealth lay there\r\nwithin 150 miles of Calcutta, almost on the surface of the soil, and not\r\nuntil the pressure of the Great War and the inability of India to draw\r\nany longer upon British industry for the most vital supplies compelled\r\nthem to turn to Jamsheedpur do they seem to have at all appreciated what\r\nan enterprise that owed little or nothing to them meant to India and the\r\nEmpire. When the war was over, Lord Chelmsford paid a visit to\r\nJamsheedpur and generously acknowledged that debt. \"I can hardly\r\nimagine,\" said the Viceroy, \"what we should have done if the Tata\r\nCompany had not been able to give us steel rails which have provided not\r\nonly for Mesopotamia, but for Egypt, Palestine, and East Africa.\" One\r\nmay therefore hope that the lesson of the war will not be forgotten, and\r\nthat Sir Thomas Holland, who has now exchanged the Munitions Board for\r\nthe portfolio of Industry, will prevent a relapse into the old\r\ntraditions of aloofness now that the war pressure is over.\r\n\r\nThe cotton-mills of Bombay, the jute-mills of Calcutta, the goldfields\r\nof Mysore each contribute their own remarkable chapter to the story of\r\nBritish industrial enterprise in India, but none can compare in point of\r\nromance with the story of the iron and steel industry of Jamsheedpur. It\r\nneed only be very briefly recalled. In 1902 Mr. Jamsheedji Tata, a\r\nveteran of the great Parsee community of Bombay and one of the founders\r\nof the Bombay cotton industry, visited the United States. His active\r\nmind had already for some time been busy with the idea of starting a\r\nmetallurgic industry in India, and he had received in the course of\r\nconversation with Lord George Hamilton, then Secretary of State for\r\nIndia, about the only encouragement he ever did receive in England. He\r\nfared better in America. In New York he called with a letter of\r\nintroduction from Lord Avebury on Mr. C. Page Perin, an eminent mining\r\nengineer, who was at once impressed both with his visitor and with the\r\nschemes which he unfolded, though they were still quite visionary. Mr.\r\nPerin, who is still the consulting engineer of the Tata Company, agreed\r\nto send a party of American prospectors, and followed them in 1904 to\r\nIndia. Long was the search and many the hardships undergone, and Mr.\r\nJamsheedji Tata himself passed away before he could see the fulfilment\r\nof his dream. But Sir Dorab Tata proved himself not unworthy to follow\r\nin his footsteps, and when an area hitherto almost unknown and\r\nunexplored had been definitely located, combining in an extraordinary\r\ndegree the primary requisites of adequate coalfields, vast ore deposits\r\nof great wealth, a sufficient water supply, a suitable site for a large\r\nindustrial town with good railway communication though still badly\r\nneeding development, he and a small group of his Bombay friends tried to\r\nfind in London the financial support which they imagined would hardly be\r\ndenied to an enterprise of such immense importance for our Indian\r\nEmpire. But they failed. It was then that, largely on the advice of Sir\r\nGeorge Clarke, now Lord Sydenham, who was then Governor of\r\nBombay--whose great services to the economic advancement of India and to\r\nIndian technical education latter-day politicians are too apt to\r\nforget--they appealed to their own fellow-countrymen for the capital\r\nneeded. Never had such an appeal been made, but the response was\r\nimmediate and ample. The Tata Iron and Steel Works Company was launched\r\nas an Indian Company, and to the present day all the hard cash required\r\nhas come out of Indian pockets. In 1908 the first clearance was effected\r\nin what had hitherto been a barren stretch of scrub-jungle sparsely\r\ninhabited by aboriginal Sonthals, one of the most primitive of Indian\r\nraces, and in 1910 the first works, erected by an American firm, were\r\ncompleted and started. As far as the production of pig-iron was\r\nconcerned success was immediate, but many difficulties had to be\r\novercome in the manufacture of steel which had never before been\r\nattempted in a tropical climate. These too, however, had been surmounted\r\nby the end of 1913 in the nick of time to meet the heavy demands and\r\nimmense strain of the Great War, towards the end of which Government\r\ntook as much as 97 per cent of the steel output and obtained it from the\r\nCompany at less than a quarter of the price that it would have commanded\r\nin the Indian open market.\r\n\r\nTo-day, just twelve years after the first stake was driven into the\r\nground, Jamsheedpur is already a town of close on 100,000 inhabitants,\r\npleasantly situated on rising ground between a considerable river which\r\nflows down sometimes during the rainy season in a devastating torrent\r\nfrom the lofty plateau of Chota Nagpur into the Bay of Bengal and a\r\nminor affluent whose waters mingle with it close by. The climate is dry\r\nand therefore healthy, though the shade temperature rises in hot weather\r\nto 116, and a finely scarped range of hills over 3500 feet high provides\r\nwithin easy distance the makings of a small hill station as a refuge,\r\nespecially valuable for women and children, from the worst heat of the\r\ntorrid season. During the \"cold\" weather, when the thermometer falls to\r\nbetween 40° and 50° at night, there can be no more delightful climate in\r\nthe world. The war gave a tremendous impetus to the Company's operations\r\nand stimulated the rapid expansion of the works on a far larger scale\r\nthan had ever been anticipated, until they now need not fear comparison\r\nwith some of the largest and best-equipped works of the same kind in the\r\nWest. No doubt is entertained as to the demand for the enormous output\r\nfrom such a plant. Nor is it contemplated that it will meet anything\r\nlike the full needs of India, which are growing apace. Before the war\r\nIndia imported annually about 1,000,000 tons of steel products, of which\r\nGermany furnished a large and increasing percentage direct or through\r\nBelgium. Equally little room is there to question the continued supply\r\nof either coal or ore. The life of the coal mines which the Tata Company\r\npossess within one hundred miles of their works is estimated at two\r\nhundred years, and they form only a very small portion of the great\r\ncarboniferous area known as the Gondwana measures. They produce the best\r\ncoking coal in India, and though much inferior as such to most British\r\ncoal mines, against this disadvantage can be set off the much greater\r\nrichness of the iron ore deposits, carrying between 60 and 67 per cent\r\nof metallic iron. These non-titaniferous deposits are practically\r\ninexhaustible, and those at present used are within forty to fifty miles\r\nof Jamsheedpur. This favoured region supplies also most of the fluxes\r\nrequired for the manufacture of steel, and even clays for firebricks.\r\n\r\nOf equal promise for the future prosperity of India is the force of\r\nattraction which Jamsheedpur is exercising on other kindred or\r\nsubsidiary industries which are establishing themselves in large\r\nnumbers, and with Indian as well as European capital behind them,\r\nthroughout the same region.\r\n\r\nTo keep pace with the growth of the population which such huge and rapid\r\nextensions involve is no easy task, and the Tatas aim at making\r\nJamsheedpur a model industrial town not unworthy of the high standard\r\nwhich they have reached in their works. It is to an Englishman, a son of\r\nthe late Archbishop Temple, formerly in the Public Works Department,\r\nthat the task has been entrusted. The Company own twenty-seven square\r\nmiles of land, which is none too little for a town that already has\r\nnearly 100,000 and may in the near future have a quarter of a million\r\ninhabitants. Fortunately the lie of the land, which is undulating and\r\nrises gradually from the level of the river beds, adapts itself both to\r\naesthetic and sanitary town-planning. There is plenty of scope for\r\nlaying out round the existing nucleus a number of new and separate\r\nquarters in which suitable provision can be made for the needs of\r\ndifferent classes of Europeans and Indians, and for applying new\r\nscientific principles which should secure for all, including especially\r\nthe children, the light and air so much needed in a large industrial\r\ncentre. Many, too, are the novel problems arising out of the governance\r\nof a great heterogeneous community in a town which, though within the\r\nBritish Indian province of Behar and Orissa, is in many respects\r\nautonomous; and to another Englishman, Mr. Gordhays, who has for the\r\npurpose retired from the Indian Civil Service, Messrs. Tata have\r\nentrusted this equally responsible task.\r\n\r\nHow soon such a vital undertaking can be Indian-run as well as\r\nIndian-owned is a question upon the answer to which the future of India\r\nin the economic sphere depends as much as upon the success or failure of\r\nthe new Councils in the sphere of political advancement.\r\n\r\nThe operations of a steel and iron foundry call for high scientific\r\nattainments, grit, and the power to control large bodies of labour. In\r\naddition to these qualities others are required at Jamsheedpur to deal\r\nwith the many physical and social problems which the rapid growth of a\r\nvery heterogeneous population and its harmonious and healthy governance\r\npresent. What augury can be drawn for the future from the results\r\nalready achieved? The board of directors, with whom the ultimate\r\nresponsibility rests, has always been exclusively Indian. But, being\r\nsane business men, they realised from the first that they must for some\r\ntime rely on Western management, Western technical knowledge, and even\r\nto some extent on Western skilled labour. Having met with little\r\nencouragement in British official quarters in India, or in British\r\nunofficial quarters in England, they turned in the first place to\r\nAmerica. Many Americans occupy responsible posts in the works. The\r\nerection of the first plant was committed to Americans. The Indian\r\ndirectors never attempted to exclude Englishmen from their employ, nor\r\ndid they hesitate to have recourse to British industry when it could\r\nbest supply their needs. To keep the balance even they turned before the\r\nwar to Germany also. Much of the machinery was purchased from German\r\nfirms, who, like the Americans and the British, sent out their own\r\nparties to set up and work the plant which they supplied. In August 1914\r\nthe Germans numbered 250. But they were soon eliminated, and their\r\nplaces for the most part filled by Englishmen, the smelters from\r\nMiddlesbrough importing not only their fine Yorkshire physique and\r\ndialect, but their Trade Union ideas.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, Government, both in Delhi and in London, were constantly\r\npressing for an increased output, which meant a large extension of the\r\nworks; and as nothing could be obtained from England or brought out\r\nexcept at extreme risk from submarines, large orders for new plant for\r\nthe extensions now in progress had therefore to be placed in America.\r\nThe total number of covenanted employees of the Company to-day is 137,\r\nof whom ninety-three are English and forty-four American, and there are\r\nin addition sixty locally employed Europeans. The number of Indians\r\nemployed is about 44,500. Nearly half the population of Jamsheedpur is\r\ndirectly employed by the Company, and almost the whole owes its means of\r\nlivelihood to it in less direct forms. It comprises Indians of many\r\nraces and creeds and castes and tongues. There are Bengalees and\r\nMadrasees of the educated classes, some of them Brahmans, who are\r\nchiefly engaged in clerical, technical, and managerial work. There are\r\nrougher Pathans and Punjabee Mahomedans, as well as Sikhs, who take more\r\nreadily to heavy skilled manual labour. There are artisans and small\r\ntraders and shopkeepers from all parts of India, and even a few picked\r\ncarpenters from China as pattern-makers. The bulk of the unskilled\r\nlabour is drawn from the Sonthal aboriginal population, industrious,\r\ndocile, and cheerful as a rule, but abysmally ignorant and credulous,\r\nand liable to sudden gusts of emotion and passion.\r\n\r\nThe question of the employment of Indians on the actual processes of\r\nmanufacture is largely a question of technical and physical training,\r\nand it has not been lost sight of in Jamsheedpur. Schools have been\r\nstarted for the education of the Indian children, and though in a\r\ncommunity still largely composed of people who are themselves young, the\r\nnumber of children of a school-going age is necessarily small, a\r\nsecondary school under a Bengalee graduate in science, who was himself\r\noriginally trained in Rabindranath Tagore's remarkable school at Bolpur,\r\nalready has over 140 boys, and a training institute for higher technical\r\nstudies is to follow in due course. Nor are the adult men and women\r\nneglected, for social welfare in all its aspects plays an important part\r\nin the life of Jamsheedpur.\r\n\r\nAs to the actual employment of Indians, nowhere has the principle been\r\nmore carefully applied that Europeans--a term which in this connection\r\nmust be taken to include Americans--are only to be employed when and so\r\nlong as no Indian can be found competent to perform the particular work\r\nrequired. The proportion of Europeans to Indians works out to-day\r\napproximately as 1 to 230, but this figure is in itself somewhat\r\nmisleading. Out of the total of 197 Europeans, no fewer than\r\nseventy-five are the highly skilled mechanics who are still absolutely\r\nindispensable as supervisors at the steel-smelting furnaces and the\r\nrolling-mills. Work of this kind requires a powerful physique, long\r\nexperience, and plenty of pluck. One has only to look at the muscular,\r\nhard-bitten Americans and Englishmen who stand round the furnaces to see\r\nthat they represent a type of humanity which in India is still extremely\r\nrare. The Company have tried eighteen Indians, carefully selected, but\r\nonly three have stayed. The up-country races, physically more promising,\r\nlack the training. It will take, it is believed, twenty-five years to\r\nbring on Indians who can be trusted to replace Europeans in these\r\narduous jobs.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the steel-smelting furnaces there are only forty\r\nEuropean supervisors to 2000 Indian workmen, and in the rolling-mills\r\nonly thirty-five to 2200. In other departments much more rapid progress\r\nhas been achieved, and the results are already remarkable. Indians do\r\nexcellent work as machinists, cranemen, electricians, etc., and even in\r\nthe rolling-mills they do all the manual work. The best of them make\r\nreliable gangers and foremen. In the blast furnaces there are only eight\r\nEuropeans to 1600 Indians, in the mechanical department only six to\r\n3000, and in the traffic department only one to 1500. In two other\r\nimportant departments it has been already found possible to place an\r\nIndian in full charge. One of these is the electrical department, which\r\nrequires unquestionably high scientific capacity. Another is the coke\r\novens, on which 2000 Indians are employed under the sole charge of an\r\nIndian who seemed to me to represent an almost new and very interesting\r\ntype--a young Bengalee of good family, nephew to Sir Krishna Gupta, who\r\nwas recently a member of the Secretary of State's Council in Whitehall.\r\nHe had studied at Harvard, had worked afterwards right through the mill,\r\nand had acquired the habit of organised command, which is still rare\r\namongst Indians. If Jamsheedpur may be not inaptly regarded as a\r\nmicrocosm of India, in which the capacity of Indians for self-government\r\nin a wider sense than any merely political experiment connotes is being\r\nsubjected to the closest and most severe test, it assuredly holds forth\r\nhigh promise for the future.\r\n\r\nYet at the very time when the future of Indian industries seemed to be\r\nat last almost assured, and largely thanks to Indian enterprise, it was\r\ngravely compromised by the miserable breakdown of the most important of\r\nall the services on which the very life of industry depends. The Indian\r\nrailways proved altogether incapable of meeting the new demands made\r\nupon them. Even in the essential matter of coal supplies, though the\r\noutput of the Indian coal mines suffices for present requirements, huge\r\ndumps of coal accumulated round the mines and could not be moved owing\r\nto the lack of rolling-stock and to the general inadequacy of the\r\nexisting railway system. The breakdown may have been due in the first\r\nplace to the rapid deterioration of rolling-stock and permanent way that\r\ncould not be made good during the war, and has not been made good yet,\r\nbut the real causes must be traced much farther back to the parsimonious\r\nand short-sighted railway policy of the Government of India for years\r\npast. Apart from the economic consequences, it is particularly\r\nunfortunate, even from the political point of view, that such a\r\nrevelation of inefficiency should have occurred in a field which has\r\nbeen hitherto most jealously preserved for British enterprise, and just\r\nin the very sphere of Western activity which has appealed most strongly\r\nto Indians of all classes.\r\n\r\nOf all the Western inventions which we have brought to India, the\r\nrailway is certainly the most popular, perhaps because the modern love\r\nof travel has developed largely out of the ancient practice, still\r\ncontinued, of pilgrimages _en masse_ to popular shrines, near and far.\r\nDuring the great days when the worship of Juganath reaches its climax\r\nand half a million pilgrims pour into Puri from all parts of India, the\r\nterminus of the branch-line from the Calcutta-Madras railway is busier\r\nthan Epsom Downs station on Derby Day. A big Indian railway station--the\r\nHowrah terminus in Calcutta, the Victoria Terminus in Bombay, the\r\nCentral Station in Delhi--is in itself at all times a microcosm of\r\nIndia. It is never empty, never silent by day or by night. It is always\r\nalive, always crowded, always full of Indian sounds and smells. It is a\r\ncamping ground not only for those who are actually going to travel but\r\nalso for those who merely come to give their friends a send-off or to\r\ngreet them on arrival. No Indian of any position can be allowed to\r\ndepart or to arrive without a party of friends to garland him with\r\nflowers, generally the crude yellow \"temple\" marigolds. The ordinary\r\nIndian to whom time is of little value cares nothing for time-tables. He\r\ngoes to the station when he feels moved to do so, and waits there\r\npatiently for the next train that will take him to his destination or\r\nbring the friends he wants to meet. He does not in the least mind\r\nwaiting for two, three, or four hours--sometimes in more remote parts of\r\nthe country for the best part of twelve or even of twenty-four hours.\r\nOnly the Europeans and a few Western-educated Indians who have learnt\r\nbusiness habits ever think of \"catching\" a train. So the Indian railway\r\nstation has a constant and generally dense floating population that\r\nsquat in the day-time in separate groups, men, women, and children\r\ntogether, according to their caste, hugging the slender bundles which\r\nconstitute their luggage, chattering and arguing, shouting and\r\nquarrelling, as their mood may be, but on the whole wonderfully\r\ngood-humoured and patient. At night they stretch themselves out full\r\nlength on the ground, drawing their scanty garments well over their\r\nheads and leaving their legs and feet exposed, or, if the air is chilly\r\nand they possess a blanket, rolling themselves up in it tightly like so\r\nmany shrouded corpses in long and serried rows, till the shriek of an\r\nincoming train arouses them. Then, whether it be their train or not,\r\nthere is a din of yelling voices, a frenzied rush up and down the\r\nplatform, and, even before those who want to get out have had time to\r\nalight, a headlong scramble for places--as often as not in the wrong\r\ncarriages and always apparently in those that are already crammed full,\r\nas the Indian is essentially gregarious--and out again with fearful\r\nshouts and shrill cries if a bundle has gone astray, or an agitated\r\nmother has mislaid her child, or a traveller discovers at the last\r\nmoment that it is not after all the train he wants. In nine cases out of\r\nten there is really no need for such frantic hurry. Even express trains\r\ntake their time about it whenever they do stop, and ordinary trains have\r\na reputation for slowness and unpunctuality to which they seldom fail to\r\nlive up. But, as if to make up for the long hours of patient waiting,\r\nthe struggling and the shouting go on _crescendo_ till the train is at\r\nlast under way again. For, besides the actual passengers coming and\r\ngoing, the platforms are alive with hawkers of all sorts who minister to\r\ntheir clamorous needs--sellers of newspapers and of cigarettes and of\r\nthe betel-nut which dyes the chewer's mouth red, of sweetmeats and\r\nrefreshments suited to the different castes and creeds, Mahomedan\r\nwater-carriers from whom alone their co-religionists will take water to\r\nfill their drinking-vessels, and Brahman water-carriers who can in like\r\nmanner alone pour out water for Hindus of all castes. And all have their\r\nown peculiar cries, discordant but insistent.\r\n\r\nWho that has passed at night through one of the great junctions on the\r\nUpper Indian railways, say Saharampur or Umballa or Delhi, can ever\r\nforget such sounds and sights of pandemonium? Or who would care to miss\r\nduring the daylight hours the open window on to the kaleidoscopic scenes\r\nof Indian life at every halt? Here a turbaned Rajput chief with his\r\nwhiskers fiercely twirled back under his ears descends from the train to\r\nbe greeted and garlanded by a throng of expectant retainers who look as\r\nif they had stepped straight out of an old Moghul picture. Or a fat and\r\nprosperous Mahomedan _zemindar_ in a gold-embroidered velvet coat and\r\npatent-leather boots struts along the platform convoying his fluttering\r\nhousehold of heavily veiled ladies, all a-twitter with excitement, to\r\nthe _purdah_ carriage specially reserved for them. Or a band of\r\nmendicant ascetics, their almost naked bodies smeared all over with\r\nfresh ashes and the trident of Shiva painted on their foreheads, return\r\nwith well-filled begging-bowls from some favourite shrine. Or an excited\r\ncrowd, all wearing the little white Gandhi cap, rend the air with shouts\r\nof _Mahatma Gandhi-ki jai!_ in honour of some travelling apostle of\r\n\"Non-co-operation.\" And all over India the swarm of humbler travellers,\r\nwho lend their own note of varied colour even to the smallest way-side\r\nstations, seems to increase every year, whether one crosses the vast\r\ndrab plains of Upper India or climbs the steep face of the Western Ghats\r\non to the sun-scorched plateau of the Deccan, or is unmercifully jolted\r\nthrough the gentler and more verdant landscapes of Southern India.\r\n\r\nOne change, however, since pre-war days none can fail to mark.\r\nTravelling is far less comfortable. Trains are fewer and far more\r\ncrowded. The rolling-stock is war-worn and dilapidated, for it could not\r\nbe renewed during the war, as, although a great deal of railway material\r\ncan be produced in Indian workshops, some absolutely essential parts\r\nhave always been imported from England--as many Indians believe for the\r\npurpose of subordinating Indian railways to the industrial interests of\r\nGreat Britain. Even the permanent way has deteriorated. But the mere\r\ndiscomfort inflicted upon travellers is a small matter, and it is\r\nchiefly on grounds of racial feeling that Indians are beginning to cry\r\nout against the many outward and visible forms of discrimination in\r\nfavour of European travellers. What the most moderate and thoughtful\r\nIndians are concerned about is the futility of talking of the\r\ndevelopment of Indian industries and the starting of new ones when\r\nrailroads and rolling-stock can no longer handle even the existing\r\ntraffic or move the essential raw materials. The problem brought to the\r\nfront by the grave crisis through which the Indian railway system is now\r\npassing is neither new nor accidental. It is the outcome of antiquated\r\nmethods of railway administration and finance, of which it was possible\r\nto disguise the defects so long as they were not subjected to any\r\nsearching strain. The war provided that strain, and the system showed,\r\nit must be admitted, wonderful endurance under it so long as the war\r\nlasted. But since the end of the war it has betrayed such grave symptoms\r\nof imminent collapse that Government have been compelled to appoint an\r\nindependent Committee of Inquiry, with a fair proportion of Indian\r\nmembers on it, which with a man like Sir William Acworth as Chairman\r\nwill, it may be hoped, not be content merely to pass judgment upon it,\r\nbut will be able also to point to a better way in the future. The\r\nevidence produced before the Committee furnishes ample material for a\r\nscathing indictment of the system.\r\n\r\nThere are altogether only some 35,000 miles of railroad in India to-day,\r\nor about as much as before the war in European Russia, the most backward\r\nof all European countries, whose population was little more than a third\r\nof that of India. The Government of India may claim that this is a\r\nmagnificent return for the £380,000,000 of capital expenditure that\r\nthese railways represent to-day in its books, and that the profits which\r\nthey have yielded for the last twenty years with steadily increasing\r\nabundance to the State show the money to have been well invested. But\r\nhow if these results have been achieved only by a short-sighted and\r\nnarrow-minded policy which sacrificed the future to the present?\r\n\r\nOf the Indian railways some are owned and worked by the State, some are\r\nowned by the State and worked by companies, some are owned and worked by\r\ncompanies under contracts with the State. The companies that own and\r\nwork their own lines are for the most part domiciled in England, and the\r\nevidence already taken before the Committee shows how little power is\r\nleft by the London Boards to the local agents who manage them, and how\r\noften the interests of the public and of the country appear to be\r\nsubordinated to the narrow view taken at home of the companies' own\r\ninterests. But however flagrant the special shortcomings of the\r\ncompany-owned railways may be, the root of the evil common to all lies\r\nin the policy laid down by and for the Government of India, in whom the\r\nsupreme control has always been vested as a professedly necessary\r\nconsequence of the financial guarantees given by the State and the right\r\nof ultimate purchase reserved to it. That control, which has passed\r\nthrough many different incarnations in the course of the last\r\nhalf-century, has been exercised since 1905 by a Railway Board of three\r\nmembers outside of, but subordinate to, the Government of India. It is\r\nrepresented in the Viceroy's Executive Council by the Member for\r\nCommerce and Industry, but its real master and the ultimate authority in\r\nall matters of railway policy is and always has been the Finance Member\r\nof the Government of India, who in turn has to adapt himself to the\r\nexigencies of Whitehall. The Finance Member, who lays down the annual\r\namount that can be allocated to railway expenditure out of revenue, cuts\r\nthe cloth of the Railway Board in accordance not so much with the needs\r\nof the railways themselves as with the requirements of his annual\r\nbudget. For when the yield of the Indian railways began to constitute an\r\nimportant source of Government revenue, the Finance Member, instead of\r\ndevoting it to the equipment and expansion of railways, however\r\nessential to the future prosperity of the country, was easily prevailed\r\nupon to regard it, in part at least, as a convenient lucky-bag to draw\r\nupon, especially in difficult times, for meeting the demands of other\r\ndepartments, and especially of the Army Department, always the most\r\ninsatiable of all. In the same way, however clear a case could be made\r\nout from the point of view of the railways for capital expenditure to be\r\nmet by raising loans at home or in India, the decision was not based so\r\nmuch on the intrinsic merits of such an operation as on the immediate\r\neffect it was likely to have on the British or Indian money market in\r\nrespect of other financial operations with which the Secretary of State\r\nwas saddled. The result has been that before the war the Indian railways\r\nwere kept on the shortest possible commons, and that having been\r\ninevitably starved during the war, without any reserves to fall back\r\nupon, they are clamouring to-day for financial assistance for the mere\r\nupkeep of open lines and the renewal of rolling-stock, without which\r\nthey are threatened with complete paralysis, whilst the Government of\r\nIndia, confronted on the one hand with the categorical imperative of the\r\nEsher Committee and the fantastic extravagance of the Army Department\r\nsince the Afghan war, and on the other with the appalling losses already\r\nincurred in consequence of Whitehall's currency and exchange policy, has\r\nnever been in a worse position to give such assistance.\r\n\r\nThe keen searchlight of the war has been turned effectively on many weak\r\npoints in the government and administration of India besides railway\r\npolicy, and the Indian currency and exchange policy stands out now as\r\none of the most disturbing factors in the economic situation.\r\n\r\nIndia played her part in the war, and played it well, but she was never\r\ncalled upon to bear any crushing share in its financial burdens. The\r\nIndian Legislature unanimously and spontaneously granted £100,000,000 in\r\n1917 towards Imperial war expenditure, and another £140,000,000 of\r\nIndian money went into the two Indian war loans and issues of Treasury\r\nnotes. But the increase in India's actual military expenditure during\r\nthe war was small, as the Imperial Exchequer continued to bear all the\r\nextra cost of the Indian forces employed outside India, and the last\r\nIndian war budget, 1918-19, showed an excess of only about £23,000,000\r\nover the last pre-war budget, 1913-14--an increase easily met by\r\nrelatively small additional taxation. Moreover, the Indian export trade,\r\nafter a temporary set-back on the first outbreak of hostilities,\r\nreceived a tremendous impetus from the pressing demand for Indian\r\nproduce at rapidly increasing prices, and the lucrative development of\r\nmany new as well as old industries and of natural resources too long\r\nneglected. The balance of trade which before the war had generally been\r\nslightly against India then shifted rapidly, and the scale turned\r\nheavily in her favour till the end of the war. The total value of the\r\nsupplies of all sorts, foodstuffs, raw materials, and manufactured\r\nproducts, sent out from India to other parts of the British Empire and\r\nto Allied countries has been estimated at some £250,000,000.\r\n\r\nFor India as a whole the war years were fat years, though the wealth\r\npoured into the country was, as usual, very unevenly distributed, and\r\nsome sections of the population were very hard hit by the tremendous\r\nrise in the cost of living. Lean years were bound to come in India as\r\nelsewhere when the war was over. But the reaction would hardly have led\r\nto such a serious crisis had it not been for complications which have\r\narisen out of the peculiarities of a unique exchange and currency\r\nsystem. This system presumes a gold standard, but it is in reality a\r\ngold exchange system by which, in the absence of an Indian gold\r\ncurrency, the exchange as between the Indian silver rupee and the\r\nBritish gold sovereign has to be kept at the gold point of the legally\r\nestablished rate of the rupee to the sovereign by delicately balanced\r\noperations directed from Whitehall. These consist in the sale of\r\n\"Council bills\" at gold point by the Secretary of State for India when\r\nthe balance of trade is in favour of India, and in the sale of \"Reverse\r\nCouncils\" at gold point by the Government of India when the balance of\r\ntrade is against India.\r\n\r\nThe system worked fairly well until the second year of the war, when the\r\nbalance of trade turned in favour of India and soon assumed\r\nunprecedented proportions. The enormous Indian exports could not be paid\r\nfor in goods, as the Allied countries had neither goods nor freight\r\navailable for maintaining their own export trade. Nor could they be\r\npaid for in bullion, as gold and silver were taken under rigid control.\r\nNor could internal borrowings in India (though the success of the Indian\r\nwar loans was a phenomenon hitherto undreamt of) suffice to finance the\r\nexpenditure incurred in India on behalf of the Imperial Government. The\r\nGovernment of India made very large purchases of silver, which combined\r\nwith the stimulated world-demand to drive the price of the white metal\r\nup to inordinate levels, and to keep pace with this rise and avoid an\r\nintolerable loss on the coining of rupees the rate of exchange--_i.e._\r\nthe rate at which the Secretary of State sells \"Council bills\" in\r\nLondon--was raised until it actually reached 2s. 5d. for the rupee. To\r\nmeet the balance of Imperial expenditure in India the Government of\r\nIndia issued currency notes against London Treasury bills.\r\n\r\nThe result of these operations was that at the end of the war the funds\r\nstanding to the credit of the Government of India in London had been\r\nswollen to the unprecedented figure of £106,000,000, a large proportion\r\nof which had to be paid back to India when, with the cessation of the\r\nabnormal conditions induced by the war, the balance of trade turned\r\nagainst her, and the rate of exchange had been raised from the legal\r\nstandard of sixteenpence to the rupee to 2s. 5d. The very important\r\nquestion then arose of the future legal ratio of the rupee to the\r\nsovereign or the £1 sterling. A Committee was appointed to advise the\r\nSecretary of State as to the best means of securing fixity of exchange\r\nunder the new conditions; it took evidence in London during the year\r\n1919 and reported towards the end of the year. A majority of the\r\nCommittee recommended that the rupee should be linked with the gold\r\nsovereign and not with the £1 sterling, which had become divorced from\r\ngold under the pressure of war finance, and that the legally established\r\nratio of 1s. 4d. or fifteen rupees to the sovereign should be raised to\r\n2s., _i.e._ ten rupees to the sovereign. The Secretary of State accepted\r\nthe recommendations of the majority of the Committee, and in February\r\n1920 steps were taken to establish the new ratio regardless of the fact\r\nthat signs were indubitably discerned in the previous month showing that\r\nthe economic current had turned against India. The rupee was to be\r\n\"stabilised\" at 2s. gold. The only dissentient voice in the Currency\r\nCommittee had been that of the one Indian member, a Bombay bullion\r\nbroker, Mr. D. Merwanji Dalal, who probably had more practical knowledge\r\nand experience of the problem than all the ten signatories of the\r\nMajority Report, and he had pleaded in vain for the retention of the old\r\nratio of fifteen rupees to the sovereign. The event was soon to\r\ndemonstrate his sagacity. The Secretary of State in order to establish\r\nthe new ratio sold \"Reverse Councils\" at rates from 2s. 11d. downwards.\r\nThe attempt failed egregiously, for the rupee fell steadily, and has now\r\nfallen to and under 1s. 4d. The money represented by the Indian balances\r\nwith the Secretary of State had been put down in London at 1s. 4d.\r\nupwards, and India had to pay at the rate of 2s. 11d. downwards to get\r\nit back. The difference between the two rates represents, it is\r\ncalculated, a loss to the Indian tax-payer of thirty-five crores of\r\nrupees, or £35,000,000 at the \"stabilised\" rate ordained by Government.\r\n\r\nBut the actual loss to India on these exchange transactions is not the\r\nworst outcome of these conjuring tricks, as they have been\r\ncontemptuously called by Indian critics of Whitehall. Faith both in the\r\nomnipotence and in the honesty of Government was by no means extinct in\r\nIndian business circles, and when Government undertook to \"stabilise\"\r\nthe rupee at 2s. gold Indian merchants assumed that Government could and\r\nwould do what it said it was going to do. Their stocks of imported goods\r\nhad been completely depleted during the war, and prosperity had bred, as\r\nusual, a spirit of excessive optimism. Enormous orders for cotton\r\npiece-goods and other British manufactures were placed in England on the\r\nbasis of a 2s. rupee just when prices there had soared to their\r\ndizziest heights. By the time the British manufacturers had fulfilled\r\ntheir contracts and the goods were delivered in India, not only had the\r\nrupee fallen headlong but prices too had declined, and the Indian\r\nimporter found that he had made both ways a terribly bad bargain, of\r\nwhich in many cases he could not possibly fulfil his share. There was\r\n£15,000,000 worth of Manchester piece-goods alone lying in India at one\r\ntime last winter on board the ships that brought them out or in the\r\ndocks. Of these the Indian importer simply refused to take delivery,\r\nbecause to do so would have meant ruin, as, what with the depreciation\r\nof the rupee and the fall in market prices, they seldom represented\r\none-half, sometimes not a quarter, of the cost to him, if he took them\r\nup. It was useless to preach to him about the sanctity of contract, for\r\nhad not Government itself, he declared, set the example of a gross\r\nbreach of contract by undertaking and then failing to \"stabilise\" its\r\nown rupee currency? Government pleaded that it had given no undertaking\r\nthat could be construed as a contract, but the Indian retorted that the\r\nGovernment's word had been hitherto held as good as its bond, and Indian\r\nExtremists found only too ready hearers when they imputed the exchange\r\npolicy of Whitehall not so much to mere incompetence as to unholy\r\ninfluences behind Whitehall which robbed India in order to fill British\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nA wiser spirit ultimately prevailed, and merchants and buyers came\r\ntogether and agreed to compromise, and large stocks were gradually\r\ncleared. If this year's monsoon is followed by good harvests, and the\r\nEuropean markets recover something of their former activity, Indian\r\ntrade will be gradually restored to more normal conditions. But the\r\nordeal which it has passed through will have taught some enduring\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nRemembering, too, the large profits which London firms used to make on\r\nsilver purchases for the Government of India, and the enormous Indian\r\nbalances kept in London in pre-war times which were supposed to be\r\nessential to the maintenance of Indian credit but were still more\r\nclearly of great convenience for London bankers who had the use of them,\r\nIndians who are by no means Extremists ask themselves not unreasonably\r\nwhy, instead of leaving the ordinary laws of supply and demand to work\r\nthrough the ordinary channels of financial and commercial enterprise,\r\nthe Secretary of State should persist in carrying on big financial\r\noperations connected with the adjustment of the balance of trade or any\r\npurpose other than his official requirements in regard to what are known\r\nas \"home charges,\" _i.e._ payments to be made in England on account of\r\nthe Government of India.\r\n\r\nThat the effects of the present system as it has worked recently have\r\nbeen deplorable from a political as well as from an economic point of\r\nview is shown by the large number of recruits made by Mr. Gandhi from\r\nwhat one might have regarded as the most unlikely classes. Indian\r\nmerchants whose interests would seem to be bound up with the maintenance\r\nof order and public tranquillity, Bombay _Banias_ and Calcutta\r\n_Marwaris_, have thrown themselves into the \"Non-co-operation\" movement\r\nout of sheer bitterness and loss of confidence in British good faith,\r\nboycotting British imported goods and supplying a large part of the\r\nfunds without which even a Mahatma cannot carry on a prolonged political\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSHOALS AND ROCKS AHEAD\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless the economic situation improves again with a rapidity beyond even\r\nsanguine expectations, Government will have to lay before the Indian\r\nLegislature next winter a budget scarcely less unpleasant than the last\r\none. Even if expenditure does not outrun the estimates, revenue can\r\nhardly fail to fall short of them. Mr. Hailey, with perhaps forced\r\noptimism, seems to have reckoned upon taxation old and new continuing to\r\nyield at much the same rate during a year which began and is likely to\r\nend in great depression as during the preceding year, a great part of\r\nwhich had been a \"boom\" year. In the same way he budgeted on a 1s. 8d.\r\nrupee, though the rate of exchange for the rupee was then under, and has\r\nonly quite recently[4] risen above, 1s. 4d. This means an inevitable and\r\nconsiderable loss to the Government of India on all the home charges\r\nwhich it has to remit to London. Another deficit to be met by another\r\nincrease of taxation would be a strain upon the Assembly far more trying\r\nthan that to which this year's Budget subjected it. Indian opinion will\r\npress for further steps towards complete fiscal autonomy. Scarcely a\r\nsingle Indian is a convinced free trader. In the old Indian National\r\nCongress the desire not to estrange the sympathies of the Liberal party\r\nin England, and the lack of interest then taken by Indian politicians in\r\neconomic questions, kept the issue somewhat in the background until the\r\nExtremists raised it in the form of _Swadeshi_ and in an attempt to\r\norganise a boycott of British imported goods. The immense development of\r\nIndian industries during the war has made protection once more a very\r\nlive issue, for if that development is arrested or languishes as the\r\nresult of the general economic situation, the louder will be the demand\r\nfor protection. Even the outcry at first raised last winter in\r\nLancashire against the increase of the Indian import duties as an\r\nintolerable blow to British textile industries, though at once firmly\r\nchecked by the Secretary of State, provoked enough irritation in India\r\nto show how deeply engrained is the suspicion that, from the days of the\r\nEast India Company onward, the industrial and commercial interests of\r\nIndia have always been deliberately or instinctively sacrificed to those\r\nof Great Britain. Indians regard complete fiscal autonomy as one of the\r\nfirst steps towards the fulfilment of the pledge of self-government, and\r\nindeed as the logical consequence of the recommendation already made by\r\nthe Joint Select Committee of both Houses of Parliament. To believe that\r\nin such matters the Government of India would now place itself in\r\nopposition to the views of the Indian Legislature is to ignore the whole\r\nspirit of the constitutional changes.\r\n\r\nTo the economic factors that react unfavourably upon a difficult\r\npolitical situation must be added the growth of labour troubles, which\r\nExtremist agitators know how to exploit to the utmost even when they do\r\nnot actually foment them. Strikes are as common to-day in India as they\r\nare in England, and the epidemic has sometimes spread from industrial\r\nworkers to those employed by municipalities and by the State. There have\r\nbeen strikes not only in the big cotton mills and jute mills and other\r\nlarge manufacturing industries, but also amongst postmen, and amongst\r\nrailwaymen on State as well as on private-owned lines, amongst tram-car\r\ndrivers and conductors, and even amongst city scavengers. Lightning\r\nstrikes without any notice are of growing frequency. Some are\r\nshort-lived, others very obstinate, dragging on for weeks and months.\r\nSome are grotesquely frivolous, others by no means lack justification or\r\nexcuse. Intimidation often not unaccompanied by violent assaults on\r\nnon-strikers is an ugly feature common to most of them. They sometimes\r\nlead to very serious riots and bloodshed. They have played a prominent\r\npart in the worst disorders of the last few years. Nowhere have they\r\nassumed at times a more threatening shape than in the Bombay Presidency,\r\nfor in the cotton mills of Bombay itself and of the Ahmedabad district,\r\nwhich employ over 200,000 hands, are collected the largest\r\nagglomerations of factory workers in India.\r\n\r\nLabour troubles were bound to come with the introduction of Western\r\nmethods of industrial development and Western machinery. It has led, and\r\nvery rapidly, to a demand for labour which the urban population could\r\nnot supply. But the wages soon attracted immigrants from the more or\r\nless distant countryside, where at certain seasons of the year there is\r\nlittle work to be done on the land. It became the custom for an\r\nincreasingly large number of rural districts to send their men into the\r\ntowns, where they worked for a few months. Then they went away after\r\nthey had put by a little money and came back again when they had\r\nexhausted their hoard. These migrations became more and more regular and\r\non a larger scale as the demand for labour increased, and they\r\nconstitute to-day the feature which radically differentiates the problem\r\nof Indian labour from that of British labour. There has not yet grown up\r\nin India an industrial population permanently rooted in the towns. It is\r\nstill largely migratory, returning from time to time for more or less\r\nlengthy periods to field-work in the villages, which remain the real\r\nhome. The Indian factory operative has not yet ceased to be a man of the\r\ncountry rather than of the town. Hence perhaps the conditions under\r\nwhich he is sometimes content to live whilst he is working in a town--in\r\nBombay, for instance, for the most part in huge overcrowded blocks,\r\nknown as _chawls_, ill lighted, ill ventilated, in a foul atmosphere and\r\nunspeakable dirt--may seem to him less intolerable as he can look\r\nforward to exchanging them again some day for the light and air which\r\nsurround even the most squalid village hovels. If there were reason to\r\nbelieve that improved housing conditions such as are now assured to\r\nBombay by the huge city improvement schemes which, under Sir George\r\nLloyd's energetic impulse, are expanding the limits and transforming\r\nalmost beyond recognition the appearance of the most congested quarters\r\nof the most congested of modern Indian cities, or even that increased\r\nwages would substantially affect the temper of Indian labour, one might\r\nlook forward to the future in this respect with less apprehension. But\r\nin Bombay labour troubles have been scarcely less rife in the best- than\r\nin the worst-conducted mills. In Calcutta the British jute-mill owners\r\nhave set a splendid example to Indian employers of labour, and the\r\nmill-hands, now largely imported from other provinces, not only work\r\nunder the best possible conditions of light and air, but are housed in\r\nspacious quarters specially built for them, well ventilated and\r\nscientifically drained, with playing-fields and elementary schools for\r\nthe swarms of children who certainly look healthy and well-fed and\r\nhappy. The Birmingham mills in Madras are recognised to be, from the\r\nsame point of view, second to none in the world. But the most humane and\r\ngenerous employers--whether European or Indian--are as liable as the\r\nmost grasping and callous to see their workers suddenly carried away by\r\na great wave of unreasoning discontent and passion.\r\n\r\nThe greater the general unrest amongst these excitable and terribly\r\nignorant masses, the more urgent is the need for the establishment of\r\nsome effective means of determining the social and economic justice of\r\nthe claims of labour, as well as for the adjustment of actual conflicts\r\nby bringing employers and employed together in a friendly atmosphere. A\r\nreal organisation of labour in its own sphere of interests and the\r\nconstitution of responsible trades unions would probably go far to\r\nprevent labour from turning for encouragement and support to agitators\r\nwho have never been workers themselves, who have no personal knowledge\r\nof its processes or of its needs, and who exploit its discontent,\r\nreasonable or unreasonable, for purposes as disastrous, if fulfilled, to\r\nits permanent interests as to those of the employers and of the whole\r\ncommunity. A Congress which called itself the first \"All-India Trades\r\nUnion Congress\" met this year in Bombay. The present organisation of\r\nlabour in India can hardly be said to justify the title it assumed, and\r\nin answer to a deputation which waited on the Governor, Sir George Lloyd\r\nexpressed a legitimate desire for more information than was contained in\r\nits high-flown address as to the status of these unions, their method of\r\nformation, their constitution, their system of ballot and election, and\r\nthe actual experience in the several trades of those who claimed to\r\nrepresent them. That information was not and could not be furnished,\r\nbecause the ninety-two Trades Unions alleged to have been represented\r\nare at present little more than embryonic. Their spokesmen have not\r\nrisen to the leadership of labour out of its own ranks by superior\r\nindustry and knowledge. Their organisation has not been a spontaneous\r\ngrowth from within, but artificially promoted from without. The vast\r\nmajority of unskilled workers are illiterate, and even amongst ordinary\r\nskilled labour the level of education is still extremely low. The actual\r\nworkers are therefore quite unable to organise, or even to think out the\r\nsimplest labour problems for themselves, and they easily become the\r\ndupes and tools of outsiders--frequently lawyers or professional\r\npoliticians--who are not always disinterested sympathisers, but more\r\noften stimulate and exploit grievances which may in themselves be\r\nlegitimate for purposes which have little to do with the real interests\r\nof labour.\r\n\r\nThe economic causes of the growing frequency of strikes during recent\r\nyears have not yet been all explored, and Sir George Lloyd responded to\r\na crying need when, in his reply to the deputation, he announced that\r\nthe Bombay Government was about to establish a Labour Bureau under a\r\ncompetent official from the British Board of Trade to advise it in the\r\ninterests of labour. One of the greatest difficulties in dealing with\r\nindustrial disputes in India is, the Governor rightly observed, the\r\nabsence of all trustworthy materials for forming an accurate judgment on\r\nthe actual cost of living for the working man, and the ever fluctuating\r\nrelations between the wages he receives and the expenditure he has to\r\nincur even for the mere necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nWith a two-and three-fold appreciation, during and especially since the\r\nwar, in the cost both of the cotton stuffs which the working man needs\r\neven for his scanty apparel and of the foodstuffs which constitute his\r\nmeagre fare, discontent grew steadily more acute, and wages, though more\r\nthan once enhanced, did not always keep pace with that appreciation. If\r\nin circumstances, often of undoubted hardship, labour had been\r\nsufficiently equipped to state its own case, or had found disinterested\r\nfriends to state it clearly and temperately, it would have been easier\r\nto admit that economic causes sufficed, in some cases at least, to\r\nexplain, and perhaps even to justify, the increasing use of the strike\r\nweapon. But there is unhappily very abundant evidence to show that\r\nstrikes would not have been so frequent, so precipitate, and so\r\ntumultuous, had not political agitation at least contributed to foment\r\nthem as part of a scheme for promoting a general upheaval. The\r\nExtremists, who, with few exceptions, have no part or lot in labour,\r\neither as employers or as workers, began to carry on in Mr. Tilak's days\r\namongst the mill-hands of Bombay an active propaganda which originally\r\nhad little to do with labour. The mill-hands played an evil part in the\r\nworst excesses committed during the outbreak in and around Ahmedabad in\r\nApril 1919, and twice within the last two years they have seriously\r\nthreatened the peace of Bombay itself and held up for weeks together the\r\nnormal life of the great city, necessitating the employment of large\r\nmilitary forces to overawe them, and to avert through the exercise of\r\ndisciplined forbearance collisions with which the police alone would\r\nhave been unable to cope, and which, when once started, could probably\r\nhave been quelled only at the cost of considerable bloodshed. Mr. Gandhi\r\nhas a great personal hold over the factory workers, especially in\r\nWestern India. Sometimes he uses it to restrain them, sometimes, though\r\none may hope less deliberately, he works dangerously on their emotions.\r\nHis influence when he preaches temperance to them on temperate lines may\r\nbe all to the good, and except that, when he denounces tea also, because\r\nit is tainted with Western capitalism, he is waging war against a\r\npopular substitute for spirits, one need not quarrel with the solemn\r\nprocessions of mill-hands proceeding to a favourite shrine to break a\r\nsymbolical teapot in the presence of the deity as a pledge of\r\nrenunciation. But not all Mr. Gandhi's followers can be credited with\r\nhis earnest sympathies for labour, largely inspired by his detestation\r\nof a \"machine age,\" and he himself lapses into language that seems to\r\npreach more rigid abstention from drink than from violence.\r\n\r\nFactory legislation has never been neglected in India, though until\r\nrecently the chief impulse has had to proceed from Government itself. A\r\ngreat increase of public interest has taken place in the last years, and\r\nin India perhaps even more than anywhere else the activity in this\r\nrespect of the League of Nations and of the International Labour Office\r\nhas elicited prompt and vigorous response. The Secretary of State has\r\ncreated at the India Office a new department for dealing with labour and\r\nindustry. India has had her own representation at international labour\r\nconferences, and the Government of India is now engaged on a new Factory\r\nAct in accordance with the draft covenants and recommendations of the\r\nWashington Conference. Indeed in some directions the Bill is in advance\r\nof Washington. The statutory definition of a child presents special\r\ndifficulties in India, where physical development is more precocious\r\nthan in Western countries, but, instead of making the general limit of\r\nage for juvenile work lower, the Bill proposes to raise it not to\r\nfourteen but to fifteen years, whilst still permitting the employment of\r\nyounger children on special and very stringent conditions. Provisions\r\nare also made for securing longer daily intervals during the working\r\nhours as well as a weekly holiday. Further legislation will be\r\nintroduced for the benefit of industrial workers, more particularly as\r\nregards Trade Union rights and compensation for accidents. But however\r\nexcellent such measures may be, only the spread of education and the\r\nbetter organisation with it of labour itself can be expected to give any\r\nreal stability to large struggling masses invested by the new economic\r\nforces that have sprung so rapidly into existence with tremendous powers\r\nfor mischief, but with no individual or collective sense of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nBut the most dangerous rocks ahead are the questions which directly or\r\nindirectly raise the racial issue. Even during the first session of the\r\nIndian Legislature it could be seen underlying the attitude of Indian\r\nmembers towards military expenditure, and military expenditure, not\r\nlikely to diminish, will be a sore subject again when the next budget is\r\nintroduced at Delhi. If one looks merely at the growth of such\r\nexpenditure, the enormously increased cost of the British Army which, in\r\nrespect of the British forces serving in India, falls upon the Indian\r\nexchequer, furnishes Indians with a specious plea for reducing the\r\nnumber of British troops as a measure of mere economy. But even if one\r\ncould concede the Indian argument that, in a contented India marching\r\ntowards self-government under the new constitution, there can no longer\r\nbe the same necessity for large British garrisons to guarantee the\r\nsafety of British rule, any considerable reduction of the proportion of\r\nBritish to Indian forces in India would disturb the foundations of our\r\nown military organisation in peace time, based for the last fifty years\r\non a certain fixed proportion of British regulars serving at home and\r\nabroad. That an Indian territorial army would, on paper at least, be\r\nless costly is beyond dispute, and if ultimately officered entirely or\r\nalmost entirely by Indians, it would meet the Indian demand for a\r\nmilitary career for those of the educated classes who regard themselves\r\nnow as shut out in practice from the profession of arms. That demand\r\ncannot be met merely by the granting of British commissions to a few\r\nIndian officers, which is already raising many difficult regimental\r\nproblems not easily grasped by Indians familiar only with the civil\r\nadministration. The difficulties do not arise so much out of objections\r\ntaken by the British officers, however repugnant still is to most of\r\nthem the idea of ever having to take orders from an Indian superior\r\nofficer, as out of the feelings, even if they be mere prejudices, of the\r\nexisting class of native officers and of the rank and file who belong to\r\nthe old and have no liking for the new India. Most of the politically\r\nminded Indians are beginning, too, to measure the demands made upon\r\nIndia for her military contribution to the needs of the Empire by those\r\nthat are made upon the self-governing Dominions. \"We are quite willing,\"\r\nthey say, \"to bear our share of the military burdens of the Empire as\r\nequal partners in it, and\"--as some at any rate add--\"we recognise that\r\nin view of our geographical position, which lays us almost alone amongst\r\nthe Dominions open to the dangers of invasion on our land frontiers, we\r\nrequire a larger army for our own defence. But even taking that into\r\naccount, as well as our inability at present to make any contribution in\r\nkind to the naval defence of the Empire, can we be expected to submit to\r\nmilitary expenditure absorbing almost half our revenues? Can you point\r\nto a single Dominion that is asked to make an annual sacrifice\r\ncomparable to that? Are we not at least entitled to claim that the\r\nIndian tax-payer's money should not be spent merely on the maintenance\r\nof British garrisons that are here to-day and gone to-morrow, and of an\r\nIndian army that is so constituted as to lack all the essentials of a\r\nnational army, but should go to the building up of an army really worthy\r\nto take its place on equal terms when India attains to self-government\r\nwith the other armies of a commonwealth of free nations?\"\r\n\r\nThe racial issue dominates in a far graver form the whole question of\r\nthe status and treatment of Indians in the Dominions and Crown Colonies.\r\nFor there it enters a much larger field which extends far beyond India.\r\nIn India so far, in speaking of the racial issue, Indians and Europeans\r\nalike have hitherto had in mind chiefly the relations between the ruling\r\nand the subject race. When the rulers all belong to one race and come\r\nfrom a far distant country not to settle permanently but chiefly to\r\nmaintain, each one in his own sphere and during his appointed time, the\r\ncontinuity of rulership over millions of subjects of another and very\r\ndifferent race with a different civilisation, an additional element of\r\ndiscord is introduced into their relations. But since Great Britain\r\nachieved dominion over India the main issue between rulers and ruled has\r\nbeen how far on the one hand British rulers should devolve on to their\r\nIndian subjects a share in the government and administration of the\r\ncountry, and how far on the other hand their Indian subjects could\r\nhasten such devolution by various forms of pressure. Whatever part any\r\npurely racial antagonism may have played in the controversy, the British\r\nrulers of India have at least since 1833, and still more since the\r\nQueen's Proclamation in 1858, debarred themselves from basing on racial\r\ndifferences their refusal or reluctance to meet the growing aspirations\r\nof their Indian subjects. They have been content to plead the political\r\nimmaturity of the Indian people and the lack of individual\r\nqualifications amongst all but a few Indians, and even these\r\ndisabilities they had deliberately undertaken and expressed their\r\nanxiety to remove by the introduction of Western education. Neither\r\ncolour nor descent, it was specifically declared, were to constitute\r\nany barrier. It is quite otherwise with the question of the right of\r\nIndians to immigrate into other parts of the Empire, and of the measure\r\nof rights they are to enjoy as settlers there. It brings us face to face\r\nwith the racial issue pure and simple and in its widest aspects. There\r\nis an open and declared conflict between the claims of the Dominions to\r\nexclude or to restrict the rights of Indian settlers on grounds of\r\ncolour and descent for the avowed purpose of maintaining the paramount\r\nascendancy of one race over another, and the claims put forward by\r\nIndians as British subjects to have access to all parts of the Empire\r\nand to possess the same rights as other British subjects already enjoy\r\nthere. Some of the arguments employed to justify the attitude of the\r\nDominions allege inferior social standards of Indian life, but behind\r\nthem and quite undisguised is the supreme argument that Indians belong\r\nto a coloured race and, in consequence, have no interests or rights that\r\ncan possibly prevail against those of a superior white race.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the issue and the resentment which it has caused in\r\nIndia are, it is true, out of all proportion to the actual number of\r\nIndians who have immigrated into other parts of the Empire. The Indians\r\nare not a migratory people. Mostly engaged in agriculture, they cling,\r\nas peasants are apt to do all over the world, to their own bit of land\r\nand familiar surroundings. It is difficult even to induce them to move\r\nfrom one part of India to another, and, intensely conservative in their\r\nhabits and outlook, with no horizon wider than their own village, they\r\ngenerally prefer, even under the stress of economic pressure, the ills\r\nthey know of. But that does not affect the issue raised in the most\r\nacute and naked form in some of the States now forming the South African\r\nUnion. To Mr. Gandhi's experiences and struggles in Natal and the\r\nTransvaal can be traced back, as I have already shown, a great deal of\r\nthe bitterness which has now led him to denounce British rule as\r\n\"Satanic.\" It is only about fifty years ago that Indians began to go\r\nacross to South Africa, when the Government of Natal with the consent\r\nand assistance of the Government of India sought to engage Indians to\r\nwork as indentured labourers on sugar and tea plantations. In 1911, the\r\nyear of the last census, the number of Indians in the Union was about\r\n150,000, and, immigration having been since then checked and finally\r\nstopped, they cannot have increased by more than 10 per cent during the\r\nlast decade. Of the total in 1911, 133,000 were in Natal, 11,000 in the\r\nTransvaal, and 7000 in the Cape, with barely 100 in the Orange Free\r\nState. The proportion of Indians to the total European population of the\r\nUnion, which was then about 1,400,000, was therefore only just over one\r\nto ten. But they had not remained merely indentured labourers as at the\r\nbeginning. When their labour contracts expired many settled in the\r\ncountry, acquiring small plots of land as their own or becoming petty\r\ntraders, artisans, etc., and, being frugal and hard-working and of a\r\nhigher type than the Kaffir and other natives, they throve as a whole.\r\nThe white population, who had found them at first very useful, began to\r\nsee in them either dangerous competitors or an undesirable element\r\ncalculated to complicate the social problems in a country in which the\r\nEuropean formed anyhow but a small minority face to face with 6,000,000\r\nnatives. Both the old Boer Government in the Transvaal and the Colonial\r\nGovernment of Natal set to work to curtail by legislative enactments and\r\nlocal regulations the rights which Indians had been at first allowed to\r\nenjoy, and to assimilate their treatment to that of the lowest and most\r\nbackward natives. The Indians were systematically subjected to the\r\ndisabilities and indignities against which Mr. Gandhi for the first time\r\nled them to organise a violent agitation and finally to offer passive\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nThe agreement arrived at between General Smuts and Mr. Gandhi in 1914\r\nwas in the nature of a compromise which gave the Indians some relief\r\nwithout conceding the principle of equal rights, and it only brought the\r\nlong struggle to a temporary close. The old sore was reopened with the\r\nAsiatics' Trading and Land Act of 1919, which, the Indians contend,\r\nwantonly violated both the terms and the spirit of the 1914 settlement\r\nand which Europeans have declared to be \"necessary in the interests of a\r\nwhite population.\" The chief grievances of the Indians are the denial of\r\nrepresentation and franchise (except in Cape Colony), their segregation\r\nwithin appointed areas, and the curtailment of their \"inherent right to\r\ntrade.\" Some Europeans would fain deny that colour prejudice affects\r\ntheir view of the problem, which they regard as essentially eugenic and\r\neconomic. As far as the mixture of races is concerned the European's\r\nobjections to it should be readily understood by the Indians, whose own\r\ncaste laws are as rigidly directed as any in the world against the\r\ndrawbacks of miscegenation. The European, however, has legislated not to\r\nprevent mixed marriages but to arrest the general depression of the\r\nstandards of life--low wages, a lower standard of skill in skilled\r\ntrades, and low housing conditions which, he alleges, have resulted from\r\nthe unrestricted influx of a large coloured population into the\r\ntowns--and he uses the term \"coloured\" to include the Indians. With\r\nregard to the restrictions of trade licences he deduces the necessity\r\nfor them from the economic effects of unrestricted competition which has\r\nled, he declares, to the bankruptcy of European firms, to their\r\ndisplacement in the same premises by Indians, and to the depreciation of\r\nEuropean property. But, the Indian replies, if Indians have thriven in\r\nSouth Africa in the past it is because they work harder and live more\r\nfrugally, and if they flourish more especially as traders it is because\r\nEuropeans, finding it to their interest to trade with them, have been\r\ntheir best customers. Apart from the material ruin which South African\r\nlegislation has brought upon many Indians, what they most deeply resent\r\nis unquestionably its specifically racial character. They may suffer\r\nfewer personal disabilities as to travelling on railways and in\r\ntram-cars and walking on street pavements than they did a few years\r\nago, when very special precautions had to be taken to prevent such a\r\ndistinguished Indian as Mr. Gokhale being exposed to them during his\r\nvisit to South Africa. But they still suffer, they complain, under the\r\nsupreme indignity of racial discrimination with which South African\r\nlegislation is openly stamped. Repatriation could only take place slowly\r\neven if the cost of compensation, which no fair-minded European could\r\nthen reasonably deny, were not in itself an almost insurmountable\r\nobstacle. From the merely practical point of view the question therefore\r\nis now reduced to the discovery of a _modus vivendi_ for the Indian\r\ncommunity now in South Africa, and it would be very near a solution if\r\nlegislation to secure the economic and eugenic standards on which the\r\nAfrikander lays so much stress were so framed as to apply to the whole\r\npopulation, even should it in practice bear more heavily on the Indian\r\nthan on the European, if the former less frequently rose to the required\r\nstandards. A similar solution would remove the sense of grievance\r\narising out of the denial of the franchise in Natal and the Transvaal,\r\nof which the injustice seems to Indians to be merely heightened by the\r\nfact that it has been given to them in Cape Colony, where they form a\r\nmuch smaller minority. But there is no sign that the temper of the South\r\nAfrican Union, in which British and Dutch are united on no issue more\r\nfirmly than on this one, will abate its claim to treat the Indians\r\nwithin its borders as an inferior race that has no rights to be weighed\r\nagainst the interests, real or assumed, of the superior white race.\r\n\r\nThe Government of India has never questioned the reality of Indian\r\ngrievances in South Africa. In 1903, shortly after the Boer war, Lord\r\nCurzon strongly urged the British Government to enforce their redress in\r\nthe Transvaal whilst it was still governed as a Crown Colony. At the end\r\nof 1913, when the struggle was most acute, Lord Hardinge expressed his\r\nsympathy with a frankness and warmth which fluttered Ministerial\r\ndovecots both at home and in the Union. Since then Indian troops have\r\nfought during the war side by side with South African troops, and the\r\nrepresentatives of India have sat in the War and Peace Councils of the\r\nEmpire side by side with Ministers of the South African Union. So long\r\nas South African legislation bears the impress of racial discrimination\r\nthe Government of India is bound to maintain its opposition to it, and\r\nthe more fully it voices Indian opinion under the new constitution, the\r\nmore emphatic its opposition must be.\r\n\r\nIn other Dominions the Indian question is much less acute, as there has\r\nnever been anything like the same amount of Indian immigration, and it\r\nis now practically stopped. But it must be remembered that it was the\r\nreturn to India of a large number of Sikhs who were refused permission\r\nto land in British Columbia that was the signal for grave disorders in\r\nthe Punjab in the second year of the war. And not so long ago the Aga\r\nKhan, as well known in London as in India, had to give up visiting\r\nAustralia in view of the many humiliating formalities to which as an\r\nAsiatic he would have been subjected before being allowed to land there.\r\nIt is surely not beyond the resources of statesmanship to devise at\r\nleast a scheme by which Indians of good repute who wish to travel for\r\npurposes of business or study, or for the mere satisfaction of a\r\nlegitimate curiosity to see other parts of the Empire, should be free to\r\ndo so without any restraints on the score of race. The attitude of the\r\nother Dominions seems certainly to be at present far less uncompromising\r\nthan that of the South African Union, and one may look forward with some\r\nconfidence to an agreement by which the rights of Indians already\r\nsettled in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada will obtain sufficient\r\nrecognition to satisfy Indian self-respect.\r\n\r\nThe Indian question is not, however, confined to the Dominions. It is\r\nunfortunately in some of the Crown Colonies that it has recently assumed\r\nan even more serious aspect than in South Africa, inasmuch as in the\r\nCrown Colonies the British Government is directly responsible for the\r\ntreatment of Indians, whilst only indirectly in a Dominion, where the\r\nprimary responsibility rests with the Dominion Government. The question\r\nof Indian indentured labour in Fiji, British Guiana, and some other\r\nsmaller colonies is of lesser importance, though Indians have been\r\ndeeply moved by stories of ill-treatment inflicted upon them by European\r\nplanters, and indenture itself is held nowadays to connote a state\r\nalmost of servitude incompatible with Indian national self-respect.\r\nThere the Government of India has a remedy in its own hands. It can\r\nstop, and is stopping, the export of Indian labour to those colonies.\r\nFar graver is the situation that has only recently been created for\r\nIndians in the Crown Colony of East Africa, known since the war as\r\nKenia. Indians were settled in that part of Africa even before British\r\nauthority was ever established there, and Mr. Churchill, now Secretary\r\nof State for the Colonies, himself admitted some years ago, after his\r\ntravels in that part of the world, that without the Indians the country\r\nwould never have reached its present stage of development and\r\nprosperity. Whilst if in the case of a self-governing Dominion the\r\nBritish Government can at least urge, as an excuse for its acquiescence\r\nin the disabilities imposed upon Indians, that it cannot override the\r\nconstitutionally expressed will of the Dominion people, it can plead no\r\nsuch excuse where a Crown Colony is concerned over which its authority\r\nis absolute and final. This is indeed the point on which the Government\r\nof India laid stress last winter in a long and closely reasoned despatch\r\nelaborating the view already formally enunciated by the Viceroy that in\r\na Crown Colony Indians have a constitutional right to equality of status\r\nwith all other British subjects. That right has, it is contended, been\r\nviolated in Kenia in regard more especially to the three major questions\r\nof franchise, segregation, and land ownership. At the very moment when,\r\nin India, elected assemblies have been created under a new constitution\r\non the broadest possible franchise, the Legislative Council of Kenia,\r\nwith a population of 35,000 Indians and only 11,000 Europeans, is so\r\nconstituted that it has only two Indian members out of fourteen, whilst\r\nof the remaining twelve, eleven are European and one represents the very\r\nbackward Arab community. Land ownership in the uplands has been reserved\r\nexclusively for Europeans on the plea that the climate of the lowlands\r\nto which the Indians are relegated is more suitable for them than for\r\nEuropeans. Yet the climatic argument is itself disregarded when, even in\r\nthe lowlands, racial segregation is enforced in areas reserved there too\r\nfor Europeans alone. The representations of the Government of India have\r\ncommanded the attention they deserve, and the Colonial Office has sent\r\nout instructions to the Kenia authorities to suspend all segregation\r\nmeasures. The whole question will, one may hope, be reopened and settled\r\non a new basis of justice for Indians. The British settlers will surely\r\nthemselves recognise, on further consideration, that their interests\r\ncannot be allowed to override the far larger obligations of Great\r\nBritain to the people of India.\r\n\r\nThe question of the treatment of Indians in the Crown Colonies is one\r\nthat has to be settled between the British Government and the Government\r\nof India, and it could not therefore come before the Imperial\r\nCabinet--or Conference--recently attended by the Prime Ministers of all\r\nthe Dominions assembled in London. But in regard to that question in the\r\nDominions, Mr. Srinivasa Sastri, one of India's representatives, laid\r\ndown in their presence firmly and plainly the principle on which all\r\nIndians are at one:\r\n\r\n     There is no conviction more strongly in our minds than this, that a\r\n     full enjoyment of citizenship within the British Empire applies not\r\n     only to the United Kingdom but to every self-governing Dominion\r\n     within its compass. We have already agreed to a subtraction from\r\n     the integrity of the rights by the compromise of 1918 to which my\r\n     predecessor, Lord Sinha, was a party--that each Dominion and each\r\n     self-governing part of the Empire should be free to regulate the\r\n     composition of its population by suitable immigration laws. On that\r\n     compromise there is no intention whatever to go back, but we plead\r\n     on behalf of those who are already fully domiciled in the various\r\n     self-governing Dominions according to the laws under which those\r\n     Dominions are governed--to these peoples there is no reason\r\n     whatever to deny the full rights of citizenship--it is for them\r\n     that we plead, where they are lawfully settled, that they must be\r\n     admitted into the general body of citizenship, and no deduction\r\n     must be made from the rights that other British subjects enjoy.\r\n\r\nIn commending the matter to his audience for earnest consideration and\r\nsatisfactory settlement, Mr. Srinivasa Sastri spoke with the added\r\nauthority of his position as a member of the Indian Legislature and one\r\nof the ablest leaders of the Moderate party. \"It is,\" he said, \"of the\r\nmost urgent and pressing importance that we should be able to carry back\r\na message of hope and of good cheer.\" He will have to report to the\r\nLegislature on his mission when he returns to India, and no part of his\r\nreport will be looked for with more anxiety or more closely scrutinised.\r\n\r\nIndians have already demonstrated their willingness to recognise\r\naccomplished facts and to accept in practice any reasonable settlement\r\nwhich does not strike fatally at the principle laid down by Mr.\r\nSrinivasa Sastri, not only on behalf of his fellow-countrymen, but in\r\nthe name of the Government of India, which here again has acted as a\r\nnational Indian Government. South Africa, it may be, will nevertheless\r\npersist in subordinating to a narrow conception of her own interests the\r\nhigher interests of Imperial unity, which, if it ever ceased to include\r\nIndia, would assuredly be a much poorer thing. It is all the more\r\nessential that if India's faith in the Empire is not to be, perhaps\r\nirretrievably, shaken, South Africa should remain, in her refusal to\r\nhonour the pledge of partnership given to India on behalf of the whole\r\nEmpire, a solitary exception amongst the self-governing Dominions, and\r\nthat the United Kingdom, whose responsibility to India is most directly\r\ninvolved, should insist that the pledge be redeemed to the full in the\r\nCrown Colonies which are under the immediate and direct control of the\r\nImperial Government.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] August 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE INCLINED PLANE OF GANDHIISM\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have persistently derided the \"Non-co-operation\" movement and\r\nannounced its imminent collapse have been scarcely less wide of the mark\r\nthan Mr. Gandhi himself when he began to predict that it would bring\r\n_Swaraj_ to India by a date, not always quite the same, but always less\r\nthan a year distant. The original programme of \"Non-co-operation\" has\r\nhitherto failed egregiously. Only very few lawyers have abandoned their\r\npractice in \"Satanic\" law-courts at his behest, still fewer Indians have\r\nsurrendered the distinctions conferred on them by Government. A\r\nmischievous ferment has been introduced once more into Indian schools\r\nand colleges. Some youths have foolishly wrecked their own future, or\r\nseen it wrecked for them, by attempts to boycott and obstruct the\r\nexaminations on which their career so often depends. But neither have\r\nMr. Gandhi and his followers destroyed the schools and colleges against\r\nwhich they have waged war, nor created in anything more than embryo, and\r\nin extremely few places, the \"national\" schools and colleges that were\r\nto take their place. Even Rabindranath Tagore, whose poetic imagination\r\nwas at first fired by Mr. Gandhi's appeal to renounce the title of\r\nknighthood awarded to him in recognition of his literary genius, has had\r\nenough practical experience of education, as he himself has conceived\r\nand carried it into execution on his own quite original lines, to be\r\ndriven at last to admit that Indian youths are asked to bring their\r\npatriotic offering of sacrifice, \"not to a fuller education, but to\r\nnon-education.\" With his craving for metaphysical accuracy of\r\nexpression, he has even denounced the \"no\" of \"Non-co-operation\" as \"in\r\nits passive moral form asceticism, and in its active moral form\r\nviolence.\" The conclusion wrung from his reluctant idealism is one at\r\nwhich the large majority of sober-minded Indians arrived long before the\r\npoet. They gave effect to it as voters at the elections in defiance of\r\nMr. Gandhi's boycott, and their representatives gave effect to it in the\r\nlegislatures which Mr. Gandhi no less vainly boycotted.\r\n\r\nYet in spite of Mr. Gandhi's repeated failures \"Non-co-operation\" is not\r\ndead. It has a widespread organisation, with committees in every town\r\nand emissaries particularly active in the large villages and in many\r\nrural districts. It had the enthusiastic support at Nagpur of the large\r\nassemblage that still retains the name, but little else, of the old\r\nIndian National Congress. It does not lack funds, for Mr. Gandhi\r\nprofesses to have gathered in the crore of rupees which he asked for\r\nwithin the appointed twelvemonth. It controls a large part of the Indian\r\nPress, though mostly of the less reputable type, more vituperative and\r\nmendacious, in spite of all Indian Press laws, than anything conceived\r\nof in this country where there are no Press laws. Mr. Gandhi himself\r\ngoes on preaching \"Non-co-operation\" with unabated conviction and\r\nunresting energy, the same picture always of physical frailty and\r\nunconquerable spirit, travelling all over the country in crowded\r\nthird-class carriages, worshipped by huge crowds that hang on his\r\nsainted lips--and pausing only in his feverish campaign to spend a short\r\nweek at Simla in daily conference with Lord Reading. That the new\r\nViceroy should have thought it advisable almost immediately after his\r\narrival in India to hold such prolonged intercourse with Mr. Gandhi is\r\nthe best proof that the Mahatma is no mere dreamer whose influence is\r\nevanescent, but a power to be reckoned with. The Simla interviews did\r\nnot seem to have been entirely fruitless when Mr. Gandhi extracted from\r\nhis chief Mahomedan lieutenants, the brothers Ali, a disavowal, however\r\nhalf-hearted, of any intention to incite to violence in certain speeches\r\ndelivered by them for which they would otherwise have had to be\r\nprosecuted. It looked as if he had made a more effective stand than on\r\nother occasions against the importation of violence into\r\n\"Non-co-operation,\" and proved the reality of the influence which he is\r\nbelieved to have all along exercised to curb his Mahomedan followers who\r\ndo not share his disbelief in violence. But Simla only deflected him for\r\na short time from his dangerous course.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of this strange movement nothing is more mysterious than\r\nthe hold which Mr. Gandhi has over Mahomedans as well as Hindus, though\r\nthe wrongs of Turkey, which are ever in his mouth, touch only very\r\nremotely the great mass of Indian Mahomedans, whilst the old antagonism\r\nof the two communities is still simmering and bubbling and apt to boil\r\nover on the slightest provocation. Collisions are most frequent during\r\nreligious festivals, especially if they happen to be held by both\r\ncommunities at the same time. The chief stone of offence for Hindus is\r\nthe sacrifice of cows, the most sacred to them of all animals, without\r\nwhich the Mahomedans consider their great annual festival of _Bakar-Id_\r\ncannot be complete. Mahomedans, on the other hand, to whom musical\r\ninstruments as an accompaniment to religious worship are abhorrent, are\r\noften driven wild when Hindu processions pass with their bands playing\r\nin front of a mosque. Only four years ago, when the compact between the\r\nNational Congress and the Moslem League was still quite fresh, riots\r\nbroke out simultaneously during the _Bakar-Id_ over a great part of the\r\nPatna district, which were only suppressed after a large tract of some\r\nforty miles square had passed into the hands of the Hindu mobs, when a\r\nconsiderable military force reached the scenes of turmoil and disorder,\r\nfor the like of which, according to the Government Resolution, it was\r\nnecessary to go back over a period of sixty years to the days of the\r\ngreat Mutiny. It would be of little purpose to enumerate many other\r\ninstances of disorders on a lesser scale that have occurred since then\r\nin connection with cow-killing. When staying for a few days last winter\r\nin Nellore, a small town in the Madras Presidency, _i.e._ in a part of\r\nIndia noted for its quietude, I had a pertinent illustration of the\r\noften trivial but none the less dangerous forms that the persistent\r\nanimosity between Hindus and Mahomedans can assume. In Nellore, itself a\r\nvery sleepy hollow, the Mahomedans are not quite in such a hopelessly\r\nsmall minority as they generally are in Southern India, for they number\r\nabout 6000 out of 30,000 inhabitants. The few \"Non-co-operationists\" in\r\nthe place, Hindu and Mahomedan, professed to have formed a\r\n\"Reconciliation Committee\" to prevent their co-religionists from flying\r\nat each other's throats. Their efforts were not, however, sufficient to\r\nrelieve the local authorities from the necessity of putting some of the\r\npolice on special service for the protection of respectable Hindu\r\ntraders of the same caste as Mr. Gandhi himself in their daily comings\r\nand goings through certain quarters of the city against the more unruly\r\nof their Mahomedan fellow-citizens. The usual bad feeling had been\r\nexacerbated by an affray, already the best part of a year old, when one\r\nof the Hindu processions from the four great temples of the city\r\nperversely altered its accustomed route and passed down the streets\r\nleading to the chief mosque with bands defiantly playing, and a party of\r\nMahomedans lying in wait for them rushed out and assaulted them with\r\nbrick-bats, until they were dispersed by a few rifle-shots from the\r\npolice. Apart from such major provocation, each side indulges in minor\r\npin-pricks that keep up a constant irritation. It is an old custom at\r\nboth Hindu and Mahomedan festivals for youths to dress up as tigers and\r\nlions, who add an element of terror to the pageant by roaring to order.\r\nOf late years each community has tried to deny to the other the right\r\nto introduce this element of frightfulness into its processions, and\r\nthese harmless wild beasts have frequently been made to repent of their\r\ndisguise with bruised bodies and broken heads. In one large village in\r\nthe Nellore district serious trouble arose over an attempt on the part\r\nof the Mahomedans to halt their procession for the purpose of\r\ndistributing \"jaggery\" water in close proximity to an enclosure set\r\napart by the Hindus for the nuptials of their god and goddess at an\r\nannual marriage festival, and the _Taluk_ magistrate had to issue a\r\nformal order, enforced by policemen on special duty, forbidding the\r\nMahomedans to place the objectionable pot of water within twenty feet of\r\nthe wedding enclosure. In all such cases both sides appeal promptly for\r\nhelp to the authorities, and one of the chief and not least wearisome of\r\nthe British administrator's tasks is to be for ever on the watch in\r\norder if possible to avert, by timely suasion and measures of\r\nprecaution, the serious trouble that may at any moment arise out of\r\ntrifles which to the European mind must seem grotesquely insignificant.\r\nIndians themselves admit that it is an even more difficult task for\r\nthem, as Indian-born officials must almost always belong to one or other\r\nof the two communities, and their impartiality be therefore congenitally\r\nsuspect to one side or the other.\r\n\r\nThere can be no worthier purpose for either government or public men or\r\nprivate individuals to pursue than a real reconciliation between two\r\ngreat communities estranged, not only by fundamentally different\r\nreligious beliefs and traditions, but by enduring memories of\r\ncentury-long conflicts and of the very often oppressive domination of\r\nMahomedan rulers over conquered Hindu peoples held down in spite of\r\ntheir numerical superiority by the sheer weight of superior force. There\r\nmay have been Englishmen who, believing in the shallow maxim _Divide ut\r\nimperes_, have relied on that estrangement to fortify British rule; but\r\nsuch has never been the principle of British policy. It has constantly\r\nsought, on the contrary, to prevent and suppress as far as possible\r\ndisorders which, whenever they break out afresh, inevitably revive and\r\nquicken the ancient antagonism, and to attenuate it, slowly but\r\nsteadily, by the exercise of even-handed justice and the pacifying\r\ninfluences of education and the rule of law.\r\n\r\nHas the alliance between Mr. Gandhi and the Ali brothers or the fusion\r\nbetween the Congress and League Extremists, Hindu and Mahomedan, proved\r\nmore effective? How far down has this Hindu and Mahomedan fraternisation\r\nreally reached that is based above all on common hatred of a \"Satanic\"\r\nGovernment? How far has it even temporarily checked the instinctive\r\ntendency of the masses in both communities to break away from their\r\nallies and go for each other rather than for that common enemy against\r\nwhom \"Non-co-operation\" bids them combine? Frequent outbreaks continue\r\nto reveal from time to time the _ignes cineri suppositos doloso_. They\r\nmostly follow the same course. _Khilafat_ agitators terrorise the\r\nlaw-abiding population, extorting subscriptions for _Khilafat_ funds,\r\ncompelling shopkeepers to close their shops for _Khilafat_\r\ndemonstrations, and so forth, until they are driven to appeal to the\r\nauthorities for protection. Then an attempt is made to arrest some of\r\nthe ringleaders or to disarm the _Khilafat_ \"volunteers,\" who, when they\r\nhave no more modern weapons, know how to use their _lathis_ or heavy\r\niron-tipped staves with often deadly effect. Rioting starts on a large\r\nscale to the cry of \"Religion! Religion!\" the small local police force\r\nis helpless, and very soon the whole fury of the Mahomedan mob turns\r\nagainst the Hindus, as at Malegaon, in the Bombay Presidency, where they\r\nset a Hindu temple on fire and threw into the flames the body of an\r\nunfortunate Hindu sub-inspector of police who had been vainly attempting\r\nto save a Hindu quarter from arson. Troops are hurried up from the\r\nnearest military station, and usually as soon as they appear order is\r\nrestored with the employment of a minimum amount of force. Numerous\r\narrests are made, and a few of the local firebrands are ultimately\r\nprosecuted and convicted. But at \"Non-co-operation\" headquarters the\r\n_Khilafat_ propaganda goes on undisturbed, and all the appearances of\r\nHindu-Mahomedan unity are ostentatiously kept up. Mr. Mahomed Ali\r\npreaches to Hindus as well as to Mahomedans that it will be their duty\r\nto give the Ameer of Afghanistan every assistance in their power when he\r\ndescends with his armies to rescue India from her foreign oppressors. An\r\nAll-India _Khilafat_ Conference announces that, if the British\r\nGovernment fights openly or secretly against the Turkish Nationalists at\r\nAngora, the Indian National Congress will proclaim the Republic of India\r\nat its next session, and meanwhile declares it unlawful for any\r\nMahomedan to serve in the Indian army, since a \"Satanic\" Government may\r\nat any moment use it to fight against Mustafa Kemal's forces at Angora.\r\nIt is impossible to believe that on such lines \"Non-co-operation\" can\r\nbring Mahomedans and Hindus permanently together, or can drag the bulk\r\nof the sober and conservative Mahomedan community away from its solid\r\nmoorings, but the effect of such appeals to the turbulent and fanatical\r\nelements, more numerous and more easily roused amongst Mahomedans than\r\namongst Hindus, spreads and grows with the impunity conceded to them.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the Hindus may be on the whole less prone to\r\nviolence than the Mahomedans, with whom the sword is still the symbol of\r\ntheir faith, the grave agrarian disturbances which have twice this year\r\nresulted from the \"Non-co-operation\" campaign in the United Provinces,\r\nand other disorders of a similar kind on a less serious scale in other\r\nprovinces, show that Hindus too are not proof against temptations to\r\nviolence. Mr. Gandhi may go on preaching non-violence, and he may\r\nhimself still disapprove of violence and refuse to believe that his\r\nteachings, as interpreted at least by many of his followers, are as\r\ncertain to produce violence as the night is to produce darkness; but\r\nthat \"Non-co-operation\" more and more frequently spells violence is\r\nbeyond dispute, and more and more faint-hearted--to put it very\r\nmildly--are his reprobations of violence.\r\n\r\nThe most threatening feature of the \"Non-co-operation\" movement, now\r\nthat it has failed so completely in its appeal to the better and more\r\neducated classes, is that it is concentrating all its energies on the\r\nignorant and excitable masses. If one takes a long view of India's\r\nprogress under the new dispensation, it may well be a source of\r\nsatisfaction and encouragement that the insane lengths to which\r\n\"Non-co-operation\" has gone have served at least to drive in a deep\r\nwedge between the Moderates and the Extremists. But in the immediate\r\nfuture \"Non-co-operation\" may prove not less but more formidable\r\nbecause, except with a few eccentrics, it has lost whatever hold it may\r\nhave had for a time on the politically minded _intelligentsia_, and\r\nfeels, therefore, no longer under any restraint in addressing itself to\r\nhungry appetites and primitive passions amongst the backward Hindu\r\nmasses as well as amongst Mahomedans. That it has not appealed to them\r\nin vain there are increasingly ominous indications in such wanton\r\ndestruction as the firing of immense areas of forest in the Kumoon\r\ndistrict of the United Provinces. For the gods to be worshipped in fear\r\nand trembling are the gods that revel in, and can only be placated by,\r\ndestruction. Wherever there are local discontents--and such there must\r\nalways be in a vast country and amongst vast populations that too often\r\nhave a hard struggle for bare existence--\"Non-co-operation\" is at once\r\non the spot to envenom the sores. Economic conditions aggravated by the\r\ngreat rise in prices for all the necessaries of life since the Great War\r\npress heavily on the most helpless classes. The vitality of the whole\r\npopulation has been depressed for years past by the ravages of the\r\nplague, now fortunately much abated, which have carried off about eight\r\nmillion lives within the last two decades, and by the still more\r\nappalling ravages of two epidemics of influenza which in 1918 within\r\none twelvemonth carried off some six or seven millions of lives, mostly\r\nin their very best years, and left many more millions of lives either\r\nolder or younger wretchedly enfeebled. Add to all this the many direct\r\nand indirect reactions of the general unrest which in so many different\r\nforms has spread over the whole face of the globe, and of the particular\r\nforms of political unrest which have kept India in periodical ferment\r\nsince 1905, constantly fed by violent speeches and by a still more\r\nviolent vernacular press. All these discontents \"Non-co-operation\" has\r\nset itself to link up to a common purpose by inflaming racial hatred,\r\nstirred as never since the Mutiny by the story, bad enough in itself and\r\nunscrupulously distorted and exaggerated, of the events in the Punjab\r\nwhich has been for two years the trump card of the Extremists, with an\r\nadditional appeal to the religious fanaticism of the Mahomedans in the\r\nalleged wrong done to their faith by the Turkish peace terms.\r\nConsciously and unconsciously Mr. Gandhi has lent his saintly\r\ncountenance to all these menacing features of the \"Non-co-operation\"\r\nmovement, and given them a religious sanction which captures many who\r\nwould not have succumbed but for their faith in a Mahatma who can do and\r\nsay no wrong.\r\n\r\nOne of the weapons of \"Non-co-operation\" which Mr. Gandhi has lately\r\nsharpened up is the boycott of British imported goods, now reiterated\r\nand clearly defined in relation first of all to British textiles. Not\r\nonly must the Indian wear nothing but home-spun cotton cloth, but the\r\nIndian importer must cease to do any business with British firms, and\r\nIndian mills must forgo their profits in order to help the boycott. Mr.\r\nGandhi has inaugurated the boycott by presiding over huge sacrificial\r\nbonfires of imported cloth on the seashore at Bombay, amidst the\r\nacclamations of vast crowds all wearing the little \"Gandhi\" white cap\r\nwhich is the badge of \"Non-co-operation.\" This is the same mad form of\r\n_Swadeshi_ that Mr. Tilak preached over twenty years ago in the Deccan,\r\nand the Anti-Partition agitators over fifteen years ago in Bengal. It\r\nfailed in both cases. Is it less likely to fail to-day when post-war\r\neconomic conditions both in England and in India militate still more\r\nstrongly against its success, however much it may for a time appeal to\r\nIndian sentiment and to the disgust of Indian traders with Government's\r\ncurrency and exchange policy? Mr. Gandhi admitted it was impracticable\r\nunless carried out in the spirit of religious self-sacrifice for the\r\nMotherland, which impelled him even to veto the suggestion made by some\r\nof his own followers that the existing stocks of imported cloth, instead\r\nof being burnt, should be given away in charity to the poor. He may\r\nhimself really dream of an India from whose face the busy cities built\r\nup by European enterprise, and the railways, the telegraphs, and every\r\nother symbol of a Satanic civilisation shall have disappeared, and\r\nIndians shall all be content to lead in their own primitive villages the\r\nsimplest of simple lives clad only in the produce of their handlooms,\r\nfed only on the fruits of their own fields, and governed only by their\r\nown _panchayats_ in accordance with Vedic precepts and under the\r\nprotection of their favourite gods. But how many Extremists who shelter\r\nbehind his name are not already speculating on the failure of the\r\n_Swadeshi_ movement to which their dupes are committed, in order that\r\nwhen disillusionment comes it shall add to the area of popular\r\ndiscontent in which racial hatred is most easily sown? Non-payment of\r\ntaxes is another of the weapons which \"Non-co-operation\" has threatened\r\nto use, and it includes non-payment of the land-tax which would directly\r\nincite the whole agricultural population to lawlessness, and an attack\r\nupon excise revenue which in the shape of a temperance movement, in\r\nitself perfectly commendable, has already led to many cases of\r\nindefensible violence, chiefly in the urban industrial centres. He has\r\nnot yet committed himself openly to \"civil disobedience\" on the scale\r\nfor which many Extremists are already clamouring, but he has started on\r\nan inclined plane along which he may not have the power, or even the\r\nwill, to arrest his descent. Much will depend on this year's monsoon. If\r\nthe rains are good and the harvests abundant, the peasants, relieved for\r\nthe time from the pressure of the economic struggle, will be less\r\ninclined to take--even at his behest--the risk of refusing payment of\r\ntaxes. Should there unfortunately be another bad season following on\r\nlast year's partial failure,[5] the temptation may prove irresistible if\r\nreinforced by the religious exaltation which Mr. Gandhi knows so well\r\nhow to call forth. Deep down, too, there is always the latent antagonism\r\nof all the irreconcilable elements in an ancient civilisation of which\r\nBritish rule no more than Mahomedan domination, and in still earlier\r\ntimes the spiritual revolt of Buddhism, has shaken the hold upon the\r\nHindu masses.\r\n\r\nBy a strange fatality the confidence of the inarticulate millions upon\r\nwhich we have hitherto prided ourselves has been turned into bitterness\r\nand hatred hitherto unknown amongst large sections of them at the very\r\nmoment when we have for the first time regained in a large measure the\r\nconfidence of the _intelligentsia_, and we have to reckon with the\r\npossibility of popular disturbances which may call for strong action\r\njust when on broad grounds of policy any resort to force must be\r\nspecially undesirable. One of the retributions which always overtake\r\nsuch mistakes in the manner of employing force as were made two years\r\nago in the Punjab is that the actual employment of force, however\r\nlegitimate, becomes discredited. The Government of India realises--and\r\nno one probably more fully than Lord Reading after his visit to\r\nAmritsar--that with the Punjab fresh in their memories, even Indian\r\nModerates must require very strong evidence before they give any willing\r\nsupport to the employment of force, even if circumstances arise to make\r\nit inevitable for the mere maintenance of public order which no\r\ngovernment can allow to be wantonly imperilled. Such evidence is\r\naccumulating only too fast. When the time comes for action, the\r\nexistence of a responsible body of Indian opinion, constitutionally\r\norganised, and constitutionally represented in the new Legislatures,\r\nwill give Government the moral backing and the moral courage which\r\nfailed it with disastrous results in 1919.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to see a man of Mr. Gandhi's immense power for good drifting\r\ninto such deep waters. Mr. Gokhale, who had given him his enthusiastic\r\nsupport in South Africa, warned him on his return to India that methods\r\nof agitation and passive resistance which were permissible there under\r\ngreat provocation, and had been used by him with considerable success,\r\nwould be quite unwarranted in India where they would only lead to\r\ndisaster. Mr. Gokhale died soon afterwards and Mr. Gandhi has\r\ndisregarded his advice. At times he has given signs of profound\r\ndiscouragement and talked of retiring to the Himalayas to spend the rest\r\nof his days in meditation, as pious Hindus not infrequently do. At times\r\nin a more worldly mood he seems to be playing for a crown of martyrdom,\r\nand he was perhaps bidding for it when soon after a series of interviews\r\nwith the Viceroy, conducted on both sides with perfect courtesy, he\r\nreplied to the official announcement of the impending visit of the\r\nPrince of Wales to India by proclaiming it to be the duty of Indians to\r\nboycott the heir to the Throne in the same way in which he had exhorted\r\nthem last winter to boycott the Duke of Connaught. He must certainly\r\nhave been bidding for it when in the course of a raging and tearing\r\ntemperance campaign in Bombay he declared, it seems, that liquor shops\r\nmust be closed even if it cost rivers of blood. Government has so far\r\nwisely shrunk from adding to his halo as a saint that of a \"confessor\r\nand martyr.\" But he may yet force Government's hands.[6] For there must\r\nbe limits to the impunity granted even to a Mahatma who professes and\r\npreaches the doctrine of _Ahimsa_, but whose footsteps are dogged by\r\nviolence which is the negation of _Ahimsa_.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Later reports promise a far better monsoon than was at first\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n[6] Whilst these pages are going through the press, reports are coming\r\nin of a Moplah rising on the Malabar coast, far more ominous than any\r\nof the disturbances already referred to in this chapter. The Moplahs\r\nare an extremely backward and unruly race, with an infusion of Arab\r\nblood, always notorious for their fierce Mahomedan fanaticism, wrought\r\nup to a white heat by a recent visit from the two Mahomedan firebrands\r\nof \"Non-co-operation.\" The murder of Europeans, the burning and\r\nlooting of Government buildings, the tearing up of railways and\r\ntelegraphs, recall the worst excesses committed by Indian mobs two\r\nyears ago in the Punjab. But on this occasion there has been no\r\nMahomedan-Hindu fraternisation. The Moplahs have vented their\r\n_Khilafat_ fury equally upon the helpless Hindu populations of the\r\nwhole district, who have been slaughtered and plundered or forcibly\r\nconverted to Islam as in the earliest days of Mahomedan domination.\r\nHindu members of the Legislative Assembly, realising that their\r\nco-religionists owe their safety only to the military forces which are\r\nbeing rushed up by a Satanic Government to arrest a campaign of sheer\r\nmurder and rapine, may well ask, as Mr. Jamnadas Dwarkadas has just\r\ndone, how long such men as Mahomed and Shaukat Ali are to be allowed\r\nto go on preaching the doctrines which the Moplahs have so effectively\r\ncarried into practice. However local this outbreak may remain, it is\r\nonly another and a more sinister symptom of the widespread upheaval\r\nagainst all constituted authority into which \"Non-co-operation\" has\r\ndegenerated under the leadership of Mr. Gandhi and his Mahomedan\r\nallies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN PROBLEM A WORLD PROBLEM\r\n\r\n\r\nA great constitutional experiment, of which the expressed purpose is to\r\nbring a self-governing India into full and equal partnership with all\r\nother parts of the British Empire, has been courageously launched in\r\ndeep waters still only partially explored, and it has resisted the first\r\nonslaught of a singular combination of malignant forces. It is too early\r\nyet to speak with absolute assurance of its enduring success. For\r\nsuccess must depend upon many factors outside India as well as within.\r\nAll that can be said with confidence is that it has made a far more\r\npromising start than might have been looked for even in less\r\nunfavourable circumstances, and many Englishmen, and Indians also, who\r\ndisliked and distrusted the reforms and would have preferred to stand in\r\nthe old ways, are coming round to the belief that in their success lies\r\nthe best and possibly the one real hope for the future. Faith is\r\nnaturally strongest in those who see in the experiment the natural and\r\nlogical corollary of that even bolder experiment initiated nearly a\r\nhundred years ago when we introduced Western education in India. That\r\nwas the great turning-point in the history of British rule. We had gone\r\nto India with no purpose of seeking dominion, but circumstances had\r\nforced dominion upon us. With dominion had come the recognition of the\r\ngreat responsibilities which it involved, and having imposed upon India\r\nour own rule of law we imposed it also upon the agencies through which\r\nwe then exercised dominion--a self-denying ordinance for ourselves, for\r\nIndians a pledge of justice. Dominion pure and simple made room for\r\ndominion regarded as a great trust. But when we introduced Western\r\neducation, we placed upon our trusteeship a new and wider construction.\r\nWe invited Indians to enter into intellectual partnership with our own\r\ncivilisation, and for the purpose, admitted at the time but afterwards\r\nsometimes forgotten, of training them to a share in the responsibilities\r\nof Indian government and administration. Many Englishmen from that\r\nmoment contemplated intellectual partnership as the means to political\r\npartnership as the end. That was indeed--nearly a century before Mr.\r\nAsquith coined the phrase--\"the new angle of vision.\" The Mutiny\r\ndistorted it, and it remained obscured when the great experiment was\r\nfound to result, like all human experiments, in the production of some\r\nevil as well as of much good. If the tares may have been sometimes more\r\nconspicuous than the wheat, we should ask ourselves whether our own lack\r\nof vigilance and forethought did not contribute to the luxuriant growth\r\nof tares in a soil naturally congenial to them. After many hesitations,\r\nand some tentative and half-hearted steps, we at length recognised that\r\nintellectual partnership however imperfect must lead towards a closer\r\npolitical partnership. It became, indeed, impossible for us to refuse to\r\ndo so without being untrue to the principles that had governed not only\r\nour own national evolution long before the war, but all our declared war\r\naims and all our appeals, which never went unheeded, to Indian loyalty\r\nand co-operation during the war.\r\n\r\nThe experiment can only succeed if it secures the steadfast and hearty\r\nextension to new purposes of the co-operation between British and\r\nIndians to which the British connection with India has owed from the\r\nvery beginning, as I have tried to show, its chief strength and its best\r\nresults. One may feel confident that amongst the British in India there\r\nwill be few to deny their co-operation, though scepticism and prejudice\r\nmay die hard and social relations may prove even harder to harmonise\r\nthan political relations. The new Constitution was inaugurated under\r\nLord Chelmsford's Viceroyalty. If he perhaps failed, especially at\r\ncertain gravely critical moments, to rise above a somewhat narrow and\r\nunimaginative conception of his functions as the supreme depositary of\r\nBritish authority in India, and was too apt to regard himself always as\r\nmerely _primus inter pares_ in a governing body, peculiarly liable from\r\nits constitution to hesitate and procrastinate even in emergencies\r\nrequiring prompt decision, Lord Chelmsford was as upright, honourable,\r\nand courageous an English gentleman as this country has ever sent out as\r\nViceroy, and India will always gratefully associate his name with the\r\nreforms which have opened up a new era in her history. His place has now\r\nbeen taken by another Viceroy, Lord Reading, whose appointment at a time\r\nwhen so many Indians were smarting under a deep sense of injustice has\r\nbeen all the more heartily welcomed as, apart from many other\r\nqualifications, he went out to India with the special prestige of a\r\ngreat justiciary who had exchanged for the Viceroyalty the exalted post\r\nof Lord Chief Justice of England. Lord Reading's own liberalism is a\r\nsufficient guarantee that he will apply himself with all his approved\r\nability to the carrying out of the new reforms. But, if anything more\r\nhad been needed, the revised Instrument of Instructions under Royal Sign\r\nManual which he took out with him for his guidance prescribed both for\r\nthe Government of India and for the Provincial Governments the utmost\r\nrestraint, \"unless grave reason to the contrary appears,\" in any\r\nexercise of the emergency powers still vested in them in opposition to\r\nthe policy and wishes of the Indian representative assemblies. \"For,\r\nabove all things,\" His Majesty concluded, \"it is Our will and pleasure\r\nthat the plans laid by Our Parliament for the progressive realisation of\r\nresponsible government in British India may come to fruition, to the end\r\nthat British India may attain its due place among Our Dominions.\"\r\n\r\nThat in carrying out those instructions Lord Reading will be able to\r\nrely on the full support of the British members of his own Executive\r\nCouncil and of the Provincial Governments the most practical proof has\r\nbeen already given in the wise and conciliatory attitude displayed by\r\nthem during the first session of the new Legislatures in Delhi and in\r\nthe Provinces, in marked contrast to the sense of impregnable authority\r\ntoo often made manifest when autocratic power was still entrenched\r\nbehind official majorities voting to order. To the credit of the public\r\nservices, and not least of the Indian Civil Service, I should add that,\r\nif I may venture to judge by the great majority of those I know best,\r\nthere is now a genuine desire to make the reforms a success, however\r\napprehensive some of them may have formerly been. The change\r\nunquestionably often involves considerable sacrifices of power, and even\r\nsometimes power for good, as well as of old traditions and prejudices,\r\nand such sacrifices come hardest to those whose habits of life and mind\r\nare already set, but they are worth making. It is far easier for the\r\nyounger men who have more recently joined to realise that their\r\nopportunities of service to India and to the Empire will, if anything,\r\nbe greater than before, though they will call for somewhat different\r\nqualities, as their influence will now depend more upon capacity to\r\npersuade than to give orders. To the non-official British communities\r\nthe European-elected members of the new Assemblies have already given an\r\nadmirable lead by the cordiality of their personal relations with their\r\nIndian colleagues, as well as by such public manifestations of goodwill\r\nand sound judgment as their unanimous vote in support of the Indian\r\nresolution on Amritsar in the Legislative Assembly. One of the greatest\r\nobstacles to fruitful co-operation is racial aloofness, even amongst the\r\nbest-disposed Indians and Europeans, and every Englishman can on his own\r\naccount and within his own sphere do something to overcome it.\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Duke of Connaught last winter to India for the express\r\npurpose of representing the King-Emperor at the opening of the new\r\nCouncils in the three great Presidencies, and of delivering a Royal\r\nMessage of unprecedented import to the new Indian Legislature in the\r\nImperial capital, bore perhaps its happiest fruits in the personal\r\nappeal, prompted by his old love and knowledge of the Indian people, in\r\nwhich he sought to dispel \"the shadow of Amritsar\" that had \"lengthened\r\nover the face of India,\" and did in fact do much to dispel it. The\r\nPrince of Wales is to follow this winter not only in the Duke's recent\r\nfootsteps, but, as heir to the Throne, in the footsteps of his royal\r\nfather and grandfather. Even if opinions are divided as to the political\r\nexpediency of his visit before the clouds that still overhang the Indian\r\nhorizon have been dispelled, we may rest assured that his personal\r\nqualities will win for him too the affection and reverence which the\r\nIndian people are traditionally and instinctively inclined to give to\r\nthose whom the gods have invested with the heaven-born attributes of\r\nkingship.\r\n\r\nThat Indian co-operation will not fail us if we persevere in ensuing it,\r\nnot only in the letter of the great Statute of 1919 but in the spirit of\r\nthe King-Emperor's messages to his Indian people, is an assumption which\r\nthere is much to justify us in making. But, for the present, it cannot\r\nbe much more than an assumption. In support of it we can rely not only,\r\none may hope, on the continued support of large if inarticulate masses,\r\nand of the old conservative interests that have been content to stand\r\naloof from all political agitation, but also on the fine rally of the\r\ngreat majority of the politically minded classes in India whom\r\nintellectual partnership has to some extent prepared for political\r\npartnership. They still form, unfortunately, but a very small numerical\r\nminority. But their influence cannot be measured by mere numbers. If it\r\ngrew in the past even when we were showing more impatience than\r\nsympathy with its aspirations, it may be expected to grow still more\r\nrapidly in future under new conditions that give it more recognition and\r\nmore encouragement. In all countries the impulse to progress has always\r\nproceeded from small minorities, and in India the small but active\r\nminority from which it has proceeded has been essentially of our own\r\nmaking, since it owes to us all its conceptions of political freedom and\r\nnational unity and the very language in which it has learnt to express\r\nthem. Out of the ancient world of India we have raised a new Indian\r\nmiddle class, with one foot perhaps still lingering in Indian\r\ncivilisation but with the other certainly planted in Western\r\ncivilisation. It has long claimed that its leaders were fit to be the\r\nleaders of a nation. We have now conceded that claim. It rests with\r\nthose leaders to make it good. They have already given proofs of both\r\npolitical wisdom and courage; for it is they who bore the brunt of the\r\nbattle against the wreckers of the new Constitution during the elections\r\nand won it, and it is they who, forming the majority in the new\r\nassemblies, have shown sagacity and moderation in the exercise of their\r\nnew rights and the discharge of their new responsibilities as the means\r\nto closer co-operation between Indians and British. But the opposing\r\nforces arrayed against co-operation, as I have shown in the previous\r\nchapter, are still formidable. They assume many different shapes. They\r\nexploit many different forms of popular discontent. If they have failed\r\nto lay hold of the better and more educated classes, they have captured\r\nin some parts at least the masses that were never before anti-British.\r\nThey have inflamed the racial hatred which untoward incidents helped to\r\nstir up. In Mr. Gandhi they have found a strangely potent leader who\r\nappeals to the religious emotions of both Hindus and Mahomedans to shake\r\nthemselves free from the degrading yoke of an alien civilisation, and\r\nimplores them to return to the ancient and better ways of India's own\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nIt is just there that Mr. Gandhi strikes a responsive chord in many\r\nthoughtful Indians who repudiate him as a political leader. For their\r\nfaith in either the material or moral superiority of Western\r\ncivilisation is, one must admit, far less general and deep-seated than\r\nit still was only a generation ago. The emergence of Japan and her\r\nsweeping victories on land and water over the great European power that\r\ntried to humble her dealt the first heavy blow at their belief in the\r\nmaterial superiority of the West. Just as severely shaken is their\r\nbelief in its moral superiority, even with many whose loyalty to the\r\nBritish cause never wavered during the Great War and who still pride\r\nthemselves on India's share in its final victory, when they see how the\r\nworld of Western civilisation has been reft asunder by four years of\r\nfrightful conflict which drenched all Europe with blood and left half of\r\nit at least plunged in black ruin. We have preached to Indians, not\r\nuntruly, but with an insistence that seems to them now more than ever to\r\nsavour of self-righteousness, that our superior civilisation redeemed\r\nthem out of the anarchy and strife which devastated India before British\r\nrule brought her peace and order and justice. Now they ask themselves\r\nhow it comes, then, that the Western civilisation which they are told to\r\nthank for their own salvation has not saved Europe itself from the chaos\r\nwhich has overtaken it to-day. Still more searching are the questions\r\nthat they ask when they see the great powers that have been fortunate\r\nenough to emerge victorious from the struggle still postulating the\r\nsuperiority of Western civilisation as sufficient grounds for denying to\r\nother races who do not share it or have only recently come under its\r\ninfluence the right to equal treatment. Their gorge rises most of all\r\nwhen Western civilisation actually bases its claim to superiority not on\r\nethical but on racial grounds, and nations that profess to be followers\r\nof Christ, Himself of Asiatic birth and descent, carve out the world\r\nwhich He died to save--not for the benefit of one race alone--into\r\nwater-tight compartments, from some of which the Asiatic is to be\r\nexcluded by a colour-bar, but to all of which the white man is to have\r\naccess for such purposes and by such means as he himself deems right. If\r\nthe British Empire stands for a merely racial civilisation of which the\r\nbenefit is reserved for the white man only, what, they ask, is the value\r\nof a promise of partnership in it when Indians are _ipso facto_ racially\r\ndisqualified from partnership?\r\n\r\nThere lies the rub. The argument may have been stated in an extreme\r\nform, but it has to be faced, for it goes home to many Indians who would\r\nnot be moved by Mr. Gandhi's cruder abuse of a \"Satanic\" civilisation.\r\nThe overshadowing danger, and not in India alone, may be to-morrow, if\r\nnot already to-day, that of a racial conflict. Is there any other way to\r\navert it than by a frank recognition of racial equality in the sense of\r\nequality of rightful opportunity for both races, Asiatic and European?\r\nIt is only in that sense that racial equality, like the equality already\r\nrecognised of all men born to our common British nationhood, can have\r\nany meaning. For in the strict sense of the word no two men are born\r\nequal, either physically or intellectually, any more than there is\r\ncomplete equality in the family and social surroundings in which they\r\nare brought up. All that the citizens of the freest countries are\r\nentitled to claim is that there shall be no denial of right to them on\r\nthe score of birth to equal opportunities for bringing their own\r\nindividual qualities by their own effort to the largest possible\r\nfruition within the lawful limits prescribed to prevent injury being\r\ndone to others or to the community at large. Does not the same hold good\r\nfor nations and for races? The principle of equality thus understood\r\nmust clearly prevail between Asiatics and Europeans in India, for all\r\nracial discrimination between them has long been ruled out by our own\r\nstatutes, and now more than ever by a Constitution which calls India to\r\npartnership in the British Empire. It is, however, one thing to lay down\r\na principle, and another to put it consistently into practice. There\r\nare questions in front of us in India which it will be difficult to\r\nsolve if Indians and Englishmen approach them in a spirit of racial\r\nantagonism. They should not be insoluble if approached on the lines of\r\nequal opportunity for both races. Other and still more difficult\r\nquestions are likely to produce divergencies of views and interests\r\nbetween India and other parts of the Empire, including the United\r\nKingdom itself. The questions that affect the status and rights of\r\nIndians in the Dominions and Colonies go to the root of racial\r\ndiscrimination. When such questions arise their solution, in a sense\r\nthat will give even the barest and most undeniably legitimate\r\nsatisfaction to Indian views and Indian interests, will not be achieved\r\nmerely through the co-operation of the Government of India, or of every\r\nEnglishman, official or non-official, in India, however heartily these\r\nmay identify themselves with Indian views and Indian interest. Their\r\nsolution will rest with the British people all over the Empire. Will the\r\nBritish Government and the Dominion Governments and the free peoples\r\nbehind them approach all questions in which India is concerned in the\r\nsame spirit which they have already learnt to bring to bear upon\r\nquestions in which not India but other partners of the Empire are\r\nconcerned? Will they be prepared to approach them in the same spirit in\r\nwhich India was welcomed in times of stress and storm to the War\r\nCouncils and Peace Councils of the Empire? That spirit was the spirit of\r\nequal partnership in a common danger, of co-operation on equal terms in\r\na common struggle, of equal opportunities of sacrifice in common. It was\r\nnobly conceived in the womb of war. Will it have died with the war? Or\r\nwill it survive and be extended to the discussion of Imperial questions\r\nalready preoccupying the Indian mind in which competitive rather than\r\ncommon interests will have to be reckoned with--fiscal questions,\r\nquestions relating to India's share in the defence of the Empire and of\r\nIndia's right to develop and control her own military and perhaps some\r\nday her own naval forces, questions affecting the common rights of\r\nBritish citizenship and the organic constitution of the Empire?\r\nObviously in none of these questions can India expect her views and\r\ninterests always to prevail. What she claims is that her voice be heard\r\nand listened to, not as that of an inferior supplicating for boons but\r\nwith the deference and the desire for an agreed settlement by mutual\r\nconsent to which the promise of equal partnership already, she holds,\r\nentitles her. That claim she will press, too, in questions affecting the\r\nstatus and rights of her people in the Dominions and in the Colonies\r\nwith the insistence born of a new sense of nationhood which has\r\nintensified a much older race-consciousness. Heavy will be the\r\nresponsibility of those within the Empire who meet her with an\r\nuncompromising assertion of the white man's superior rights and\r\ninterests as the _suprema lex et suprema salus Imperii_.\r\n\r\nIt is not, indeed, the future of India alone that is at stake. If we\r\nlook beyond India to the rest of the great continent of Asia, and beyond\r\nour own Empire to the great American Republic with which we have so much\r\nin common, recognition or denial of racial equality lies close beneath\r\nthe surface where burning questions still threaten the world with war.\r\nThe British people have made in India the first bold attempt to rob the\r\nissue of its worst sting. If we persevere and can succeed we shall not\r\nonly strengthen immeasurably the foundations of our far-flung Empire,\r\nbut we shall enable it to play an immeasurably useful part in averting a\r\nworld danger. For the British Empire with its Western and Eastern\r\naspects, with its great Western democracies and its oriental peoples,\r\nmore advanced than and as gifted as any Asiatic people, seems to-day to\r\nbe providentially so constituted that it may act more effectively than\r\nany other power as a link between the great Asiatic and the great\r\nWestern powers of Europe and America, between the races and the\r\ncivilisations which they represent.\r\n\r\nWe may restore in India, and through India all over Asia, a new and\r\nreinvigorated faith in the British Empire's mission, if we do not shrink\r\nfrom putting into practice in our dealings with her the principle of\r\npartnership in rights and duties on which our Imperial Commonwealth of\r\nNations has been built up. We have enshrined that principle in the new\r\nconstitutional charter we have of our own free will bestowed upon India.\r\nBut if we pay only half-hearted homage to it, and our own people,\r\nwhether at home, or in other parts of the Empire, or in India itself,\r\nwhether statesmen or soldiers, or administrators or merchants, succumb\r\nto the temptation of trying still to combine with it in practice a\r\ndisingenuous survival of the old idea of domination of one race over\r\nanother, after we have so solemnly repudiated it, we shall drift the\r\nmore rapidly and disastrously on to the quicksands of racial strife and\r\nchronic disorder which, though they may fail to overthrow British rule,\r\nwould steadily weaken, and perhaps paralyse, its power for good that is\r\nafter all its one enduring justification. If, on the other hand, we\r\nfulfil that which we have always recognised, and to-day with renewed\r\nclearness of vision, to be our mission in India, by reconciling the best\r\nelements in Indian civilisation and our own, and if we can convert our\r\ncommonwealth of free British nations into a commonwealth of free Western\r\nand Eastern nations on a basis of real equality, we shall set an example\r\nof no less value to others than will be to ourselves our own\r\nachievement. The failure in its latest and most crucial stage of the\r\ngreat adventure upon which we entered three centuries ago, not, let us\r\nfor the moment assume, through lack of Indian co-operation or of the\r\ndesire on the part of the British in India to co-operate with Indians,\r\nbut through the inability of the British people as a whole and\r\nthroughout the Empire to rise to so great an opportunity, would react\r\nfar beyond the confines of India. The tide of racial hatred which may\r\nyet be stemmed would rise and perhaps not only undermine the present\r\nfabric of our Empire, but strew East and West with the wreckage of\r\ndisappointed hopes and embittered animosities.\r\n\r\nThere are some who hold that the British Empire has made its last if\r\nmost glorious effort in the Great War, and that in it Western\r\ncivilisation proclaimed itself bankrupt and committed suicide. That\r\ncannot be. The cause for which the British people fought and made such\r\nappalling sacrifices was not unworthy of them or of our civilisation.\r\nHeavy clouds hang over the future and obscure the paths of the nations.\r\nBut in India, where East and West meet as nowhere else, Britain has\r\nlighted a beacon which, if she keep it burning, will show to both the\r\nway of escape from a more disastrous conflict than that from which the\r\nWest has just emerged battered and bleeding--a conflict not between\r\nnations but between races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbyssinian victory over Italians, 112\r\n\r\nAcworth, Sir William, 260\r\n\r\nAdawa, battle of, 112\r\n\r\nAfghan invasions, 3, 61-2\r\n\r\nAga Khan, the, 136, 282\r\n\r\nAge of Consent Bill, 1891, 95-6, 113, 236\r\n\r\nAgra and Oudh, _see_ United Provinces\r\n\r\nAgrarian questions, Indian, 197-201\r\n\r\n_Ahimsa_, doctrine of, 170, 175, 188, 192, 298\r\n\r\nAhmed Shah Durani, 61\r\n\r\nAhmed Shahi dynasty, 53, 54\r\n\r\nAhmedabad, 50, 53-5; outbreak in, 176-7, 273\r\n\r\nAhmednagar, 50\r\n\r\nAjatasatni, King, 28\r\n\r\nAkbar, Emperor, 3, 5, 51, 53, 56, 57-61\r\n\r\nAla-ud-Din Khilji, 48\r\n\r\nAlai Darwazah, the, 48\r\n\r\nAlexander the Great's invasion, 27, 28, 33\r\n\r\nAli brothers, the, Mahomed and Shaukat, 140, 188-9, 191, 197, 288, 291,\r\n297 _n_.\r\n\r\nAligurh, Mahomedan College at, 135-6, 197\r\n\r\nAllahabad outbreak, 177\r\n\r\nAll-India Moslem League, 136, 138, 145, 147, 173\r\n\r\nAll-India Trades Congress, 272\r\n\r\nAltamsh, 36, 47\r\n\r\nAmericans in Tata Company, 248, 253\r\n\r\nAmritsar: outbreak, 175-6, 183;\r\n  Jallianwala Bagh, 177-9, 211;\r\n  British Government's despatch, 180-82;\r\n  Duke of Connaught on, 228, 303;\r\n  Resolutions on, 209, 228-30, 302\r\n\r\nAnnexation policy of Dalhousie, 81\r\n\r\nArya Somaj, 95\r\n\r\nAryan races, 15, 22, 31, 35;\r\n  social system, 22-3, 42-3, 217, 219\r\n\r\nAsiatics' Trading and Land Act (South Africa), 281\r\n\r\nAsoka, King, 2, 27, 29-32, 35\r\n\r\nAsquith, Rt.
