Ex. Doc.\r\n1st Session.                 No. 2.\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATING,\r\n\r\n_In compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 12th instant,\r\ninformation in relation to the States of the Union lately in rebellion,\r\naccompanied by a report of Carl Schurz on the States of South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana; also a report of Lieutenant\r\nGeneral Grant, on the same subject_.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 19, 1865.--Read and ordered to be printed, with the reports of\r\nCarl Schurz and Lieutenant General Grant.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution adopted by the Senate on the 12th instant, I\r\nhave the honor to state, that the rebellion waged by a portion of the\r\npeople against the properly constituted authorities of the government\r\nof the United States has been suppressed; that the United States are\r\nin possession of every State in which the insurrection existed; and\r\nthat, as far as could be done, the courts of the United States have\r\nbeen restored, post offices re-established, and steps taken to put\r\ninto effective operation the revenue laws of the country.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the measures instituted by the Executive, with the\r\nview of inducing a resumption of the functions of the States\r\ncomprehended in the inquiry of the Senate, the people in North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nArkansas, and Tennessee, have reorganized their respective State\r\ngovernments, and \"are yielding obedience to the laws and government of\r\nthe United States,\" with more willingness and greater promptitude than,\r\nunder the circumstances, could reasonably have been anticipated. The\r\nproposed amendment to the Constitution, providing for the abolition of\r\nslavery forever within the limits of the country, has been ratified by\r\neach one of those States, with the exception of Mississippi, from which\r\nno official information has yet been received; and in nearly all of\r\nthem measures have been adopted or are now pending to confer upon\r\nfreedmen rights and privileges which are essential to their comfort,\r\nprotection, and security. In Florida and Texas the people are making\r\ncommendable progress in restoring their State governments, and no doubt\r\nis entertained that they will at an early period be in a condition to\r\nresume all of their practical relations with the federal government.\r\n\r\nIn \"that portion of the Union lately in rebellion\" the aspect of affairs\r\nis more promising than, in view of all the circumstances, could well have\r\nbeen expected. The people throughout the entire south evince a laudable\r\ndesire to renew their allegiance to the government, and to repair the\r\ndevastations of war by a prompt and cheerful return to peaceful pursuits.\r\nAn abiding faith is entertained that their actions will conform to their\r\nprofessions, and that, in acknowledging the supremacy of the Constitution\r\nand the laws of the United States, their loyalty will be unreservedly\r\ngiven to the government, whose leniency they cannot fail to appreciate,\r\nand whose fostering care will soon restore them to a condition of\r\nprosperity. It is true, that in some of the States the demoralizing\r\neffects of war are to be seen in occasional disorders, but these are local\r\nin character, not frequent in occurrence, and are rapidly disappearing as\r\nthe authority of civil law is extended and sustained. Perplexing questions\r\nwere naturally to be expected from the great and sudden change in the\r\nrelations between the two races, but systems are gradually developing\r\nthemselves under which the freedman will receive the protection to which\r\nhe is justly entitled, and, by means of his labor, make himself a useful\r\nand independent member of the community in which he has his home. From all\r\nthe information in my possession, and from that which I have recently\r\nderived from the most reliable authority, I am induced to cherish the\r\nbelief that sectional animosity is surely and rapidly merging itself\r\ninto a spirit of nationality, and that representation, connected with\r\na properly adjusted system of taxation, will result in a harmonious\r\nrestoration of the relations of the States to the national Union.\r\n\r\nThe report of Carl Schurz is herewith transmitted, as requested by the\r\nSenate. No reports from the honorable John Covode have been received by\r\nthe President. The attention of the Senate is invited to the accompanying\r\nreport of Lieutenant General Grant, who recently made a tour of inspection\r\nthrough several of the States whose inhabitants participated in the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nANDREW JOHNSON\r\n\r\nWashington, D.C., _December_ 18, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF CARL SCHURZ ON THE STATES OF SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, ALABAMA,\r\nMISSISSIPPI, AND LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\nSir: When you did me the honor of selecting me for a mission to the States\r\nlately in rebellion, for the purpose of inquiring into the existing\r\ncondition of things, of laying before you whatever information of\r\nimportance I might gather, and of suggesting to you such measures as my\r\nobservations would lead me to believe advisable, I accepted the trust with\r\na profound sense of the responsibility connected with the performance of\r\nthe task. The views I entertained at the time, I had communicated to you\r\nin frequent letters and conversations. I would not have accepted the\r\nmission, had I not felt that whatever preconceived opinions I might carry\r\nwith me to the south, I should be ready to abandon or modify, as my\r\nperception of facts and circumstances might command their abandonment or\r\nmodification. You informed me that your \"policy of reconstruction\" was\r\nmerely experimental, and that you would change it if the experiment did\r\nnot lead to satisfactory results. To aid you in forming your conclusions\r\nupon this point I understood to be the object of my mission, and this\r\nunderstanding was in perfect accordance with the written instructions I\r\nreceived through the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThese instructions confined my mission to the States of South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and the department of the Gulf. I informed\r\nyou, before leaving the north, that I could not well devote more than\r\nthree months to the duties imposed upon me, and that space of time proved\r\nsufficient for me to visit all the States above enumerated, except Texas.\r\nI landed at Hilton Head, South Carolina, on July 15, visited Beaufort,\r\nCharleston, Orangeburg, and Columbia, returned to Charleston and Hilton\r\nHead; thence I went to Savannah, traversed the State of Georgia, visiting\r\nAugusta, Atlanta, Macon, Milledgeville, and Columbus; went through\r\nAlabama, by way of Opelika, Montgomery, Selma, and Demopolis, and through\r\nMississippi, by way of Meridian, Jackson, and Vicksburg; then descended\r\nthe Mississippi to New Orleans, touching at Natchez; from New Orleans I\r\nvisited Mobile, Alabama, and the Teche country, in Louisiana, and then\r\nspent again some days at Natchez and Vicksburg, on my way to the north.\r\nThese are the outlines of my journey.\r\n\r\nBefore laying the results of my observations before you, it is proper that\r\nI should state the _modus operandi_ by which I obtained information and\r\nformed my conclusions. Wherever I went I sought interviews with persons\r\nwho might be presumed to represent the opinions, or to have influence\r\nupon the conduct, of their neighbors; I had thus frequent meetings with\r\nindividuals belonging to the different classes of society from the highest\r\nto the lowest; in the cities as well as on the roads and steamboats I had\r\nmany opportunities to converse not only with inhabitants of the adjacent\r\ncountry, but with persons coming from districts which I was not able to\r\nvisit; and finally I compared the impressions thus received with the\r\nexperience of the military and civil officers of the government stationed\r\nin that country, as well as of other reliable Union men to whom a longer\r\nresidence on the spot and a more varied intercourse with the people had\r\ngiven better facilities of local observation than my circumstances\r\npermitted me to enjoy. When practicable I procured statements of their\r\nviews and experience in writing as well as copies of official or private\r\nreports they had received from their subordinates or other persons. It was\r\nnot expected of me that I should take formal testimony, and, indeed, such\r\nan operation would have required more time than I was able to devote to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMy facilities for obtaining information were not equally extensive in the\r\ndifferent States I visited. As they naturally depended somewhat upon the\r\ntime the military had had to occupy and explore the country, as well as\r\nupon the progressive development of things generally, they improved from\r\nday to day as I went on, and were best in the States I visited last. It is\r\nowing to this circumstance that I cannot give as detailed an account of\r\nthe condition of things in South Carolina and Georgia as I am able to give\r\nwith regard to Louisiana and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nInstead of describing the experiences of my journey in chronological\r\norder, which would lead to endless repetitions and a confused mingling\r\nof the different subjects under consideration, I propose to arrange my\r\nobservations under different heads according to the subject matter. It\r\nis true, not all that can be said of the people of one State will apply\r\nwith equal force to the people of another; but it will be easy to make\r\nthe necessary distinctions when in the course of this report they become\r\nof any importance. I beg to be understood when using, for the sake of\r\nbrevity, the term \"the southern people,\" as meaning only the people of\r\nthe States I have visited.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THINGS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the popular spirit in the south since the close of\r\nthe war two well-marked periods can be distinguished. The first commences\r\nwith the sudden collapse of the confederacy and the dispersion of its\r\narmies, and the second with the first proclamation indicating the\r\n\"reconstruction policy\" of the government. Of the first period I can state\r\nthe characteristic features only from the accounts I received, partly from\r\nUnionists who were then living in the south, partly from persons that had\r\nparticipated in the rebellion. When the news of Lee's and Johnston's\r\nsurrenders burst upon the southern country the general consternation was\r\nextreme. People held their breath, indulging in the wildest apprehensions\r\nas to what was now to come. Men who had occupied positions under the\r\nconfederate government, or were otherwise compromised in the rebellion,\r\nrun before the federal columns as they advanced and spread out to occupy\r\nthe country, from village to village, from plantation to plantation,\r\nhardly knowing whether they wanted to escape or not. Others remained at\r\ntheir homes yielding themselves up to their fate. Prominent Unionists told\r\nme that persons who for four years had scorned to recognize them on the\r\nstreet approached them with smiling faces and both hands extended. Men of\r\nstanding in the political world expressed serious doubts as to whether the\r\nrebel States would ever again occupy their position as States in the\r\nUnion, or be governed as conquered provinces. The public mind was so\r\ndespondent that if readmission at some future time under whatever\r\nconditions had been promised, it would then have been looked upon as a\r\nfavor. The most uncompromising rebels prepared for leaving the country.\r\nThe masses remained in a state of fearful expectancy.\r\n\r\nThis applies especially to those parts of the country which were within\r\nimmediate reach of our armies or had previously been touched by the war.\r\nWhere Union soldiers had never been seen and none were near, people were\r\nat first hardly aware of the magnitude of the catastrophe, and strove to\r\ncontinue in their old ways of living.\r\n\r\nSuch was, according to the accounts I received, the character of that\r\nfirst period. The worst apprehensions were gradually relieved as day after\r\nday went by without bringing the disasters and inflictions which had been\r\nvaguely anticipated, until at last the appearance of the North Carolina\r\nproclamation substituted new hopes for them. The development of this\r\nsecond period I was called upon to observe on the spot, and it forms the\r\nmain subject of this report.\r\n\r\nRETURNING LOYALTY.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that in the States south of Tennessee and North\r\nCarolina the number of white Unionists who during the war actively aided\r\nthe government, or at least openly professed their attachment to the cause\r\nof the Union, was very small. In none of those States were they strong\r\nenough to exercise any decisive influence upon the action of the people,\r\nnot even in Louisiana, unless vigorously supported by the power of the\r\ngeneral government. But the white people at large being, under certain\r\nconditions, charged with taking the preliminaries of \"reconstruction\" into\r\ntheir hands, the success of the experiment depends upon the spirit and\r\nattitude of those who either attached themselves to the secession cause\r\nfrom the beginning, or, entertaining originally opposite views, at least\r\nfollowed its fortunes from the time that their States had declared their\r\nseparation from the Union.\r\n\r\nThe first southern men of this class with whom I came into contact\r\nimmediately after my arrival in South Carolina expressed their\r\nsentiments almost literally in the following language: \"We acknowledge\r\nourselves beaten, and we are ready to submit to the results of the war.\r\nThe war has practically decided that no State shall secede and that the\r\nslaves are emancipated. We cannot be expected at once to give up our\r\nprinciples and convictions of right, but we accept facts as they are,\r\nand desire to be reinstated as soon as possible in the enjoyment and\r\nexercise of our political rights.\" This declaration was repeated to me\r\nhundreds of times in every State I visited, with some variations of\r\nlanguage, according to the different ways of thinking or the frankness\r\nor reserve of the different speakers. Some said nothing of adhering to\r\ntheir old principles and convictions of right; others still argued\r\nagainst the constitutionality of coercion and of the emancipation\r\nproclamation; others expressed their determination to become good\r\ncitizens, in strong language, and urged with equal emphasis the\r\nnecessity of their home institutions being at once left to their own\r\ncontrol; others would go so far as to say they were glad that the war\r\nwas ended, and they had never had any confidence in the confederacy;\r\nothers protested that they had been opposed to secession until their\r\nStates went out, and then yielded to the current of events; some would\r\ngive me to understand that they had always been good Union men at heart,\r\nand rejoiced that the war had terminated in favor of the national cause,\r\nbut in most cases such a sentiment was expressed only in a whisper;\r\nothers again would grumblingly insist upon the restoration of their\r\n\"rights,\" as if they had done no wrong, and indicated plainly that they\r\nwould submit only to what they could not resist and as long as they\r\ncould not resist it. Such were the definitions of \"returning loyalty\" I\r\nreceived from the mouths of a large number of individuals intelligent\r\nenough to appreciate the meaning of the expressions they used. I found a\r\ngreat many whose manner of speaking showed that they did not understand\r\nthe circumstances under which they lived, and had no settled opinions at\r\nall except on matters immediately touching their nearest interests.\r\n\r\nUpon the ground of these declarations, and other evidence gathered in the\r\ncourse of my observations, I may group the southern people into four\r\nclasses, each of which exercises an influence upon the development of\r\nthings in that section:\r\n\r\n1. Those who, although having yielded submission to the national\r\ngovernment only when obliged to do so, have a clear perception of the\r\nirreversible changes produced by the war, and honestly endeavor to\r\naccommodate themselves to the new order of things. Many of them are not\r\nfree from traditional prejudice but open to conviction, and may be\r\nexpected to act in good faith whatever they do. This class is composed, in\r\nits majority, of persons of mature age--planters, merchants, and\r\nprofessional men; some of them are active in the reconstruction movement,\r\nbut boldness and energy are, with a few individual exceptions, not among\r\ntheir distinguishing qualities.\r\n\r\n2. Those whose principal object is to have the States without delay\r\nrestored to their position and influence in the Union and the people of\r\nthe States to the absolute control of their home concerns. They are ready,\r\nin order to attain that object, to make any ostensible concession that\r\nwill not prevent them from arranging things to suit their taste as soon as\r\nthat object is attained. This class comprises a considerable number,\r\nprobably a large majority, of the professional politicians who are\r\nextremely active in the reconstruction movement. They are loud in their\r\npraise of the President's reconstruction policy, and clamorous for the\r\nwithdrawal of the federal troops and the abolition of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau.\r\n\r\n3. The incorrigibles, who still indulge in the swagger which was so\r\ncustomary before and during the war, and still hope for a time when the\r\nsouthern confederacy will achieve its independence. This class consists\r\nmostly of young men, and comprises the loiterers of the towns and the\r\nidlers of the country. They persecute Union men and negroes whenever they\r\ncan do so with impunity, insist clamorously upon their \"rights,\" and are\r\nextremely impatient of the presence of the federal soldiers. A good many\r\nof them have taken the oaths of allegiance and amnesty, and associated\r\nthemselves with the second class in their political operations. This\r\nelement is by no means unimportant; it is strong in numbers, deals in\r\nbrave talk, addresses itself directly and incessantly to the passions and\r\nprejudices of the masses, and commands the admiration of the women.\r\n\r\n4. The multitude of people who have no definite ideas about the\r\ncircumstances under which they live and about the course they have to\r\nfollow; whose intellects are weak, but whose prejudices and impulses are\r\nstrong, and who are apt to be carried along by those who know how to\r\nappeal to the latter.\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon the relative strength and influence of these classes.\r\nIn the course of this report you will find statements of facts which may\r\nfurnish a basis for an estimate. But whatever their differences may be,\r\non one point they are agreed: further resistance to the power of the\r\nnational government is useless, and submission to its authority a matter\r\nof necessity. It is true, the right of secession in theory is still\r\nbelieved in by most of those who formerly believed in it; some are still\r\nentertaining a vague hope of seeing it realized at some future time, but\r\nall give it up as a practical impossibility for the present. All\r\nmovements in favor of separation from the Union have, therefore, been\r\npractically abandoned, and resistance to our military forces, on that\r\nscore, has ceased. The demonstrations of hostility to the troops and\r\nother agents of the government, which are still occurring in some\r\nlocalities, and of which I shall speak hereafter, spring from another\r\nclass of motives. This kind of loyalty, however, which is produced by the\r\nirresistible pressure of force, and consists merely in the non-commission\r\nof acts of rebellion, is of a negative character, and might, as such,\r\nhardly be considered independent of circumstances and contingencies.\r\n\r\nOATH-TAKING.\r\n\r\nA demonstration of \"returning loyalty\" of a more positive character is the\r\ntaking of the oaths of allegiance and amnesty prescribed by the general\r\ngovernment. At first the number of persons who availed themselves of the\r\nopportunities offered for abjuring their adhesion to the cause of the\r\nrebellion was not very large, but it increased considerably when the\r\nobtaining of a pardon and the right of voting were made dependent upon\r\nthe previous performance of that act. Persons falling under any of the\r\nexceptions of the amnesty proclamation made haste to avert the impending\r\ndanger; and politicians used every means of persuasion to induce people to\r\nswell the number of voters by clearing themselves of all disabilities. The\r\ngreat argument that this was necessary to the end of reconstructing their\r\nState governments, and of regaining the control of their home affairs and\r\ntheir influence in the Union, was copiously enlarged upon in the letters\r\nand speeches of prominent individuals, which are before the country and\r\nneed no further comment. In some cases the taking of the oath was publicly\r\nrecommended in newspapers and addresses with sneering remarks, and I have\r\nlistened to many private conversations in which it was treated with\r\ncontempt and ridicule. While it was not generally looked upon in the\r\nState I visited as a very serious matter, except as to the benefits and\r\nprivileges it confers, I have no doubt that a great many persons took it\r\nfully conscious of the obligations it imposes, and honestly intending to\r\nfulfil them.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate number of those who thus had qualified themselves for voting\r\nprevious to the election for the State conventions was not as large as\r\nmight have been expected. The vote obtained at these elections was\r\ngenerally reported as very light--in some localities surprisingly so. It\r\nwould, perhaps, be worth while for the government to order up reports\r\nabout the number of oaths administered by the officers authorized to do\r\nso, previous to the elections for the State conventions; such reports\r\nwould serve to indicate how large a proportion of the people participated\r\nin the reconstruction movement at that time, and to what extent the masses\r\nwere represented in the conventions.\r\n\r\nOf those who have not yet taken the oath of allegiance, most belong to the\r\nclass of indifferent people who \"do not care one way or the other.\" There\r\nare still some individuals who find the oath to be a confession of defeat\r\nand a declaration of submission too humiliating and too repugnant to their\r\nfeelings. It is to be expected that the former will gradually overcome\r\ntheir apathy, and the latter their sensitiveness, and that, at a not\r\nremote day, all will have qualified themselves, in point of form, to\r\nresume the right of citizenship. On the whole, it may be said that the\r\nvalue of the oaths taken in the southern States is neither above nor below\r\nthe value of the political oaths taken in other countries. A historical\r\nexamination of the subject of political oaths will lead to the conclusion\r\nthat they can be very serviceable in certain emergencies and for certain\r\nobjects, but that they have never insured the stability of a government,\r\nand never improved the morals of a people.\r\n\r\nFEELING TOWARDS THE SOLDIERS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nA more substantial evidence of \"returning loyalty\" would be a favorable\r\nchange of feeling with regard to the government's friends and agents, and\r\nthe people of the loyal States generally. I mentioned above that all\r\norganized attacks upon our military forces stationed in the south have\r\nceased; but there are still localities where it is unsafe for a man\r\nwearing the federal uniform or known as an officer of the government to be\r\nabroad outside of the immediate reach of our garrisons. The shooting of\r\nsingle soldiers and government couriers was not unfrequently reported\r\nwhile I was in the south, and even as late as the middle of September,\r\nMajor Miller, assistant adjutant general of the commissioner of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau in Alabama, while on an inspecting tour in the southern\r\ncounties of that State, found it difficult to prevent a collision between\r\nthe menacing populace and his escort. His wagon-master was brutally\r\nmurdered while remaining but a short distance behind the command. The\r\nmurders of agents of the Freedmen's Bureau have been noticed in the public\r\npapers. These, and similar occurrences, however, may be looked upon as\r\nisolated cases, and ought to be charged, perhaps, only to the account of\r\nthe lawless persons who committed them.\r\n\r\nBut no instance has come to my notice in which the people of a city or a\r\nrural district cordially fraternized with the army. Here and there the\r\nsoldiers were welcomed as protectors against apprehended dangers; but\r\ngeneral exhibitions of cordiality on the part of the population I have not\r\nheard of. There are, indeed, honorable individual exceptions to this rule.\r\nMany persons, mostly belonging to the first of the four classes above\r\nenumerated, are honestly striving to soften down the bitter feelings and\r\ntraditional antipathies of their neighbors; others, who are acting more\r\nupon motives of policy than inclination, maintain pleasant relations with\r\nthe officers of the government. But, upon the whole, the soldier of the\r\nUnion is still looked upon as a stranger, an intruder--as the \"Yankee,\"\r\n\"the enemy.\" It would be superfluous to enumerate instances of insult\r\noffered to our soldiers, and even to officers high in command; the\r\nexistence and intensity of this aversion is too well known to those who\r\nhave served or are now serving in the south to require proof. In this\r\nmatter the exceptions were, when I was there, not numerous enough to\r\naffect the rule. In the documents accompanying this report you will find\r\nallusions confirming this statement. I would invite special attention to\r\nthe letter of General Kirby Smith, (accompanying document No. 9.)\r\n\r\nThis feeling of aversion and resentment with regard to our soldiers may,\r\nperhaps, be called natural. The animosities inflamed by a four years' war,\r\nand its distressing incidents, cannot be easily overcome. But they extend\r\nbeyond the limits of the army, to the people of the north. I have read in\r\nsouthern papers bitter complaints about the unfriendly spirit exhibited by\r\nthe northern people--complaints not unfrequently flavored with an\r\nadmixture of vigorous vituperation. But, as far as my experience goes, the\r\n\"unfriendly spirit\" exhibited in the north is all mildness and affection\r\ncompared with the popular temper which in the south vents itself in a\r\nvariety of ways and on all possible occasions. No observing northern man\r\ncan come into contact with the different classes composing southern\r\nsociety without noticing it. He may be received in social circles with\r\ngreat politeness, even with apparent cordiality; but soon he will become\r\naware that, although he may be esteemed as a man, he is detested as a\r\n\"Yankee,\" and, as the conversation becomes a little more confidential and\r\nthrows off ordinary restraint, he is not unfrequently told so; the word\r\n\"Yankee\" still signifies to them those traits of character which the\r\nsouthern press has been so long in the habit of attributing to the\r\nnorthern people; and whenever they look around them upon the traces of the\r\nwar, they see in them, not the consequences of their own folly, but the\r\nevidences of \"Yankee wickedness.\" In making these general statements, I\r\nbeg to be understood as always excluding the individual exceptions above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means surprising that prejudices and resentments, which for\r\nyears were so assiduously cultivated and so violently inflamed, should not\r\nhave been turned into affection by a defeat; nor are they likely to\r\ndisappear as long as the southern people continue to brood over their\r\nlosses and misfortunes. They will gradually subside when those who\r\nentertain them cut resolutely loose from the past and embark in a career\r\nof new activity on a common field with those whom they have so long\r\nconsidered their enemies. Of this I shall say more in another part of this\r\nreport. But while we are certainly inclined to put upon such things the\r\nmost charitable construction, it remains nevertheless true, that as long\r\nas these feelings exist in their present strength, they will hinder the\r\ngrowth of that reliable kind of loyalty which springs from the heart and\r\nclings to the country in good and evil fortune.\r\n\r\nSITUATION OF UNIONISTS.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a promising indication of returning loyalty if the old,\r\nconsistent, uncompromising Unionists of the south, and those northern men\r\nwho during the war settled down there to contribute to the prosperity of\r\nthe country with their capital and enterprise, had received that measure\r\nof consideration to which their identification with the new order of\r\nthings entitled them. It would seem natural that the victory of the\r\nnational cause should have given those who during the struggle had\r\nremained the firm friends of the Union, a higher standing in society and\r\nan enlarged political influence. This appears to have been the case during\r\nthat \"first period\" of anxious uncertainty when known Unionists were\r\nlooked up to as men whose protection and favor might be of high value. At\r\nleast it appears to have been so in some individual instances. But the\r\nclose of that \"first period\" changed the aspect of things.\r\n\r\nIt struck me soon after my arrival in the south that the known\r\nUnionists--I mean those who during the war had been to a certain extent\r\nidentified with the national cause--were not in communion with the leading\r\nsocial and political circles; and the further my observations extended the\r\nclearer it became to me that their existence in the south was of a rather\r\nprecarious nature. Already in Charleston my attention was called to the\r\ncurrent talk among the people, that, when they had the control of things\r\nonce more in their own hands and were no longer restrained by the presence\r\nof \"Yankee\" soldiers, men of Dr. Mackey's stamp would not be permitted to\r\nlive there. At first I did not attach much importance to such reports; but\r\nas I proceeded through the country, I heard the same thing so frequently\r\nrepeated, at so many different places, and by so many different persons,\r\nthat I could no longer look upon the apprehensions expressed to me by\r\nUnionists as entirely groundless. I found the same opinion entertained by\r\nmost of our military commanders. Even Governor Sharkey, in the course of a\r\nconversation I had with him in the presence of Major General Osterhaus,\r\nadmitted that, if our troops were then withdrawn, the lives of northern\r\nmen in Mississippi would not be safe. To show that such anticipations were\r\nnot extravagant, I would refer to the letter addressed to me by General\r\nOsterhaus. (Accompanying document No. 10.) He states that he was compelled\r\nto withdraw the garrison from Attala county, Mississippi, the regiment to\r\nwhich that garrison belonged being mustered out, and that when the troops\r\nhad been taken away, four murders occurred, two of white Union men, and\r\ntwo of negroes. (He informed me subsequently that the perpetrators were in\r\ncustody.) He goes on to say: \"There is no doubt whatever that the state of\r\naffairs would be intolerable for all Union men, all recent immigrants from\r\nthe north, and all negroes, the moment the protection of the United States\r\ntroops were withdrawn.\" General Osterhaus informed me of another murder of\r\na Union man by a gang of lawless persons, in Jackson, about the end of\r\nJune. General Slocum, in his order prohibiting the organization of the\r\nState militia in Mississippi, speaks of the \"outrages committed against\r\nnorthern men, government couriers, and negroes.\" (Accompanying document\r\nNo. 12.) He communicated to me an official report from Lieutenant Colonel\r\nYorke, commanding at Port Gibson, to General Davidson, pointing in the\r\nsame direction. General Canby stated to me that he was obliged to disband\r\nand prohibit certain patrol organizations in Louisiana because they\r\nindulged in the gratification of private vengeance. Lieutenant Hickney,\r\nassistant commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau, at Shreveport, Louisiana,\r\nin a report addressed to Assistant Commissioner Conway, says: \"The life of\r\na northern man who is true to his country and the spirit and genius of its\r\ninstitutions, and frankly enunciates his principles, is not secure where\r\nthere is not a military force to protect him.\" (Accompanying document No.\r\n32.) Mr. William King, a citizen of Georgia, well known in that State,\r\nstated to me in conversation: \"There are a great many bad characters in\r\nthe country, who would make it for some time unsafe for known Union people\r\nand northerners who may settle down here to live in this country without\r\nthe protection of the military.\" The affair of Scottsborough, in the\r\nmilitary district of northern Alabama, where a sheriff arrested and\r\nattempted to bring to trial for murder Union soldiers who had served\r\nagainst the guerillas in that part of the country, an attempt which was\r\nfrustrated only by the prompt interference of the district commander, has\r\nbecome generally known through the newspapers. (Accompanying document No.\r\n19.) It is not improbable that many cases similar to those above mentioned\r\nhave occurred in other parts of the south without coming to the notice of\r\nthe authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is true these are mere isolated cases, for which it would be wrong to\r\nhold anybody responsible who was not connected with them; but it is also\r\ntrue that the apprehensions so widely spread among the Unionists and\r\nnorthern men were based upon the spirit exhibited by the people among whom\r\nthey lived. I found a good many thinking of removing themselves and their\r\nfamilies to the northern States, and if our troops should be soon\r\nwithdrawn the exodus will probably become quite extensive unless things\r\nmeanwhile change for the better.\r\n\r\nASPECT OF THE POLITICAL FIELD.\r\n\r\nThe status of this class of Unionists in the political field corresponds\r\nwith what I have said above. In this respect I have observed practical\r\nresults more closely in Mississippi than in any other State. I had already\r\nleft South Carolina and Georgia when the elections for the State\r\nconventions took place. Of Alabama, I saw only Mobile after the election.\r\nIn Louisiana, a convention, a legislature, and a State government had\r\nalready been elected, during and under the influence of the war, and I\r\nleft before the nominating party conventions were held; but I was in\r\nMississippi immediately after the adjournment of the State convention, and\r\nwhile the canvass preparatory to the election of the legislature and of\r\nthe State and county officers was going on. Events have since sufficiently\r\ndeveloped themselves in the other States to permit us to judge how far\r\nMississippi can be regarded as a representative of the rest. Besides, I\r\nfound the general spirit animating the people to be essentially the same\r\nin all the States above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe election for the State convention in Mississippi was, according to the\r\naccounts I have received, not preceded by a very vigorous and searching\r\ncanvass of the views and principles of the candidates. As I stated before,\r\nthe vote was very far from being full, and in most cases the members were\r\nelected not upon strictly defined party issues, but upon their individual\r\nmerits as to character, intelligence, and standing in society. Only in a\r\nfew places the contest between rival candidates was somewhat animated. It\r\nwas probably the same in Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi convention was, in its majority, composed of men belonging\r\nto the first two of the four classes above mentioned. There were several\r\nUnion men in it of the inoffensive, compromising kind--men who had been\r\nopposed to secession in the beginning, and had abstained from taking a\r\nprominent part in the rebellion unless obliged to do so, but who had, at\r\nleast, readily acquiesced in what was going on. But there was, as far as I\r\nhave been able to ascertain, only one man there who, like the Unionists of\r\nEast Tennessee, had offered active resistance to the rebel authorities.\r\nThis was Mr. Crawford, of Jones county; he was elected by the poor people\r\nof that region, his old followers, as their acknowledged leader, and his\r\nmay justly be looked upon as an exceptional case. How he looked upon his\r\nsituation appears from a speech he delivered in that convention, and\r\nespecially from the amended version of it placed into my hands by a\r\ntrustworthy gentleman of my acquaintance who had listened to its delivery.\r\n(Accompanying document No. 13.) But several instances have come to my\r\nknowledge, in which Union men of a sterner cast than those described as\r\nacquiescing compromisers were defeated in the election, and, aside from\r\nMr. Crawford's case, none in which they succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe impulses by which voters were actuated in making their choice appeared\r\nmore clearly in the canvass for State officers, Congressmen, and members\r\nof the legislature, when the antecedents and political views of candidates\r\nwere more closely scrutinized and a warmer contest took place. The\r\npopulation of those places in the south which have been longest in the\r\npossession of our armies is generally the most accommodating as to the\r\nnew order of things; at least the better elements are there in greater\r\nrelative strength. A Union meeting at Vicksburg may, therefore, be\r\nproduced as a not unfavorable exponent of Mississippi Unionism. Among the\r\ndocuments attached to this report you will find three speeches delivered\r\nbefore such a meeting--one by Mr. Richard Cooper, candidate for the\r\nattorney generalship of the State; one by Hon. Sylvanus Evans, candidate\r\nfor Congress; and one by Colonel Partridge, candidate for a seat in the\r\nlegislature. (Accompanying document No. 14.) The speakers represented\r\nthemselves as Union men, and I have learned nothing about them that would\r\ncast suspicion upon the sincerity of their declarations as far as they go;\r\nbut all there qualified their Unionism by the same important statement.\r\nMr. Cooper: \"In 1850 I opposed an attempt to break up the United States\r\ngovernment, and in 1860 I did the same. I travelled in Alabama and\r\nMississippi to oppose the measure. (Applause.) But after the State did\r\nsecede, I did all in my power to sustain it.\" (Heavy applause.) Mr. Evans:\r\n\"In 1861 I was a delegate from Lauderdale county to the State convention,\r\nthen and in 1860 being opposed to the act of secession, and fought against\r\nit with all my powers. But when the State had seceded, I went with it as a\r\nmatter of duty, and I sustained it until the day of the surrender with all\r\nmy body and heart and mind.\" (Great applause.) Colonel Partridge: \"He was\r\na Union man before the war and a soldier in the war. He had performed his\r\nduty as a private and an officer on the battle-field and on the staff.\"\r\n\r\nThese speeches, fair specimens of a majority of those delivered by the\r\nbetter class of politicians before the better class of audiences, furnish\r\nan indication of the kind of Unionism which, by candidates, is considered\r\npalatable to the people of that region. And candidates are generally good\r\njudges as to what style of argument is best calculated to captivate the\r\npopular mind. In some isolated localities there may be some chance of\r\nsuccess for a candidate who, proclaiming himself a Union man, is not able\r\nto add, \"but after the State had seceded I did all in my power to sustain\r\nit,\" although such localities are certainly scarce and difficult to find.\r\n\r\nIt is not so difficult to find places in which a different style of\r\nargument is considered most serviceable. Your attention is respectfully\r\ninvited to a card addressed to the voters of the sixth judicial district\r\nof Mississippi by Mr. John T. Hogan, candidate for the office of district\r\nattorney. (Accompanying document No. 15.) When, at the commencement of the\r\nwar, Kentucky resolved to remain in the Union, Mr. Hogan, so he informs\r\nthe constituency, was a citizen of Kentucky; because Kentucky refused to\r\nleave the Union Mr. Hogan left Kentucky. He went to Mississippi, joined\r\nthe rebel army, and was wounded in battle; and because he left his native\r\nState to fight against the Union, \"therefore,\" Mr. Hogan tells his\r\nMississippian constituency, \"he cannot feel that he is an alien in their\r\nmidst, and, with something of confidence in the result, appeals to them\r\nfor their suffrages.\" Such is Mr. Hogan's estimate of the loyalty of the\r\nsixth judicial district of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nA candidate relying for success upon nothing but his identification with\r\nthe rebellion might be considered as an extreme case. But, in fact, Mr.\r\nHogan only speaks out bluntly what other candidates wrap up in lengthy\r\nqualifications. It is needless to accumulate specimens. I am sure no\r\nMississippian will deny that if a candidate there based his claims upon\r\nthe ground of his having left Mississippi when the State seceded, in order\r\nto fight for the Union, his pretensions would be treated as a piece of\r\nimpudence. I feel warranted in saying that Unionism absolutely untinctured\r\nby any connexion with, or at least acquiescence in the rebellion, would\r\nhave but little chance of political preferment anywhere, unless favored by\r\nvery extraordinary circumstances; while men who, during the war, followed\r\nthe example of the Union leaders of East Tennessee, would in most places\r\nhave to depend upon the protection of our military forces for safety,\r\nwhile nowhere within the range of my observation would they, under present\r\ncircumstances, be considered eligible to any position of trust, honor, or\r\ninfluence, unless it be in the county of Jones, as long as the bayonets of\r\nthe United States are still there.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of which in the preceding remarks I have endeavored to\r\nindicate the character and direction, appeared to prevail in all the\r\nStates that came under my observation with equal force, some isolated\r\nlocalities excepted. None of the provisional governments adopted the\r\npolicy followed by the late \"military government\" of Tennessee: to select\r\nin every locality the most reliable and most capable Union men for the\r\npurpose of placing into their hands the positions of official influence.\r\nThose who had held the local offices before and during the rebellion were\r\ngenerally reappointed, and hardly any discrimination made. If such\r\nwholesale re-appointments were the only thing that could be done in a\r\nhurry, it may be asked whether the hurry was necessary. Even in Louisiana,\r\nwhere a State government was organized during the war and under the\r\ninfluence of the sentiments which radiated from the camps and headquarters\r\nof the Union army, and where there is a Union element far stronger than in\r\nany other of the States I visited, even there, men who have aided the\r\nrebellion by word and act are crowding into places of trust and power.\r\nGovernor Wells, when he was elected lieutenant governor of Louisiana, was\r\nlooked upon and voted for as a thorough Unionist; but hardly had he the\r\npatronage of the State government in his hands, when he was carried along\r\nby the seemingly irresistible current. Even members of the \"Conservative\r\nUnion party,\" and friends of Governor Wells, expressed their\r\ndissatisfaction with the remarkable \"liberality\" with which he placed men\r\ninto official positions who had hardly returned from the rebel army, or\r\nsome other place where they had taken refuge to avoid living under the\r\nflag of the United States. The apprehension was natural that such elements\r\nwould soon obtain a power and influence which the governor would not be\r\nable to control even if he wished. Taking these things into consideration,\r\nthe re-nomination of Governor Wells for the governorship can certainly not\r\nbe called a victory of that Union sentiment to which he owed his first\r\nelection. While I was in New Orleans an occurrence took place which may be\r\nquoted as an illustration of the sweep of what I might call the\r\n_reactionary movement_. When General Shepley was military governor of\r\nLouisiana, under General Butler's regime, a school board was appointed for\r\nthe purpose of reorganizing the public schools of New Orleans. A corps of\r\nloyal teachers was appointed, and the education of the children was\r\nconducted with a view to make them loyal citizens. The national airs were\r\nfrequently sung in the schools, and other exercises introduced, calculated\r\nto impregnate the youthful minds of the pupils with affection for their\r\ncountry. It appears that this feature of the public schools was\r\ndistasteful to that class of people with whose feelings they did not\r\naccord.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Kennedy, acting mayor of New Orleans, early in September last,\r\ndisbanded the school board which so far had conducted the educational\r\naffairs of the city, and appointed a new one. The composition of this new\r\nschool board was such as to induce General Canby to suspend its functions\r\nuntil he could inquire into the loyalty of its members. The report of the\r\nofficer intrusted with the investigation is among the documents annexed\r\nhereto. (Accompanying document No. 16.) It shows that a large majority of\r\nthe members had sympathized with the rebellion, and aided the confederate\r\ngovernment in a variety of ways. But as no evidence was elicited proving\r\nthe members legally incapable of holding office, General Canby considered\r\nhimself obliged to remove the prohibition, and the new school board\r\nentered upon its functions.\r\n\r\nWithout offering any comment of my own, I annex an editorial taken from\r\nthe \"New Orleans Times,\" of September 12, evidently written in defence of\r\nthe measure. (Accompanying document No. 17.) Its real substance, stripped\r\nof all circumlocutions, can be expressed in a few words: \"The schools of\r\nNew Orleans have been institutions so intensely and demonstratively loyal\r\nas to become unpopular with those of our fellow-citizens to whom such\r\ndemonstrations are distasteful, and they must be brought back under\r\n'popular control' so as to make them cease to be obnoxious in that\r\nparticular.\" It was generally understood, when the new school board was\r\nappointed, that a Mr. Rodgers was to be made superintendent of public\r\nschools. In Major Lowell's report to General Canby (Accompanying document\r\nNo. 16) this Mr. Rodgers figures as follows: \"Mr. Rodgers, the candidate\r\nfor the position of superintendent of public schools, held the same office\r\nat the commencement of the war. His conduct at that time was imbued with\r\nextreme bitterness and hate towards the United States, and, in his\r\ncapacity as superintendent, he introduced the 'Bonnie Blue Flag' and other\r\nrebel songs into the exercises of the schools under his charge. In\r\nhistories and other books where the initials 'U.S.' occurred he had the\r\nsame erased, and 'C.S.' substituted. He used all means in his power to\r\nimbue the minds of the youth intrusted to his care with hate and malignity\r\ntowards the Union. He has just returned from the late confederacy, where\r\nhe has resided during the war. At the time he left the city to join the\r\narmy he left his property in the care of one Finley, who claims to be a\r\nBritish subject, but held the position of sergeant in a confederate\r\nregiment of militia.\" No sooner was the above-mentioned prohibition by\r\nGeneral Canby removed when Mr. Rodgers was actually appointed, and he now\r\npresides over the educational interests of New Orleans. There is something\r\nlike system in such proceedings.\r\n\r\nSimilar occurrences, such as the filling with rebel officers of\r\nprofessorships in the Military Institute of Louisiana, where formerly\r\nGeneral Sherman held a position, have already become known to the country,\r\nand it is unnecessary to go into further details. Many cases of this\r\ndescription are not of much importance in themselves, but serve as\r\nsignificant indications of the tendency of things in the south.\r\n\r\nIt is easily understood that, under such circumstances, Unionists of the\r\nconsistent, uncompromising kind do not play an enviable part. It is a sad\r\nfact that the victory of the national arms has, to a great extent,\r\nresulted in something like a political ostracism of the most loyal men in\r\nthat part of the country. More than once have I heard some of them\r\ncomplain of having been taunted by late rebels with their ill fortune; and\r\nit is, indeed, melancholy for them to reflect that, if they had yielded to\r\nthe current of public sentiment in the rebel States instead of resisting\r\nit, their present situation and prospects would be much more pleasing. Nor\r\nis such a reflection calculated to encourage them, or others, to follow a\r\nsimilar course if similar emergencies should again arise.\r\n\r\nWHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.\r\n\r\nWhile the generosity and toleration shown by the government to the people\r\nlately in rebellion has not met with a corresponding generosity shown by\r\nthose people to the government's friends, it has brought forth some\r\nresults which, if properly developed, will become of value. It has\r\nfacilitated the re-establishment of the forms of civil government, and led\r\nmany of those who had been active in the rebellion to take part in the act\r\nof bringing back the States to their constitutional relations; and if\r\nnothing else were necessary than the mere putting in operation of the mere\r\nmachinery of government in point of form, and not also the acceptance of\r\nthe results of the war and their development in point of spirit, these\r\nresults, although as yet incomplete, might be called a satisfactory\r\nadvance in the right direction. There is, at present, no danger of another\r\ninsurrection against the authority of the United States on a large scale,\r\nand the people are willing to reconstruct their State governments, and to\r\nsend their senators and representatives to Congress.\r\n\r\nBut as to the moral value of these results, we must not indulge in any\r\ndelusions. There are two principal points to which I beg to call your\r\nattention. In the first place, the rapid return to power and influence of\r\nso many of those who but recently were engaged in a bitter war against the\r\nUnion, has had one effect which was certainly not originally contemplated\r\nby the government. Treason does, under existing circumstances, not appear\r\nodious in the south. The people are not impressed with any sense of its\r\ncriminality. And, secondly, there is, as yet, among the southern people an\r\n_utter absence of national feeling_. I made it a business, while in the\r\nsouth, to watch the symptoms of \"returning loyalty\" as they appeared not\r\nonly in private conversation, but in the public press and in the speeches\r\ndelivered and the resolutions passed at Union meetings. Hardly ever was\r\nthere an expression of hearty attachment to the great republic, or an\r\nappeal to the impulses of patriotism; but whenever submission to the\r\nnational authority was declared and advocated, it was almost uniformly\r\nplaced upon two principal grounds: That, under present circumstances, the\r\nsouthern people could \"do no better;\" and then that submission was the\r\nonly means by which they could rid themselves of the federal soldiers and\r\nobtain once more control of their own affairs. Some of the speakers may\r\nhave been inspired by higher motives, but upon these two arguments they\r\nhad principally to rely whenever they wanted to make an impression upon\r\nthe popular mind. If any exception is to be made to this rule it is\r\nLouisiana, in whose metropolis a different spirit was cultivated for some\r\ntime; but even there, the return in mass of those who followed the\r\nfortunes of the confederate flag during the war does not appear to have a\r\nfavorable influence upon the growth of that sentiment. (See Gen. Canby's\r\nletter, accompanying document No. 8.) While admitting that, at present, we\r\nhave perhaps no right to expect anything better than this\r\nsubmission--loyalty which springs from necessity and calculation--I do not\r\nconsider it safe for the government to base expectations upon it, which\r\nthe manner in which it manifests itself does not justify.\r\n\r\nThe reorganization of civil government is relieving the military, to a\r\ngreat extent, of its police duties and judicial functions; but at the time\r\nI left the south it was still very far from showing a satisfactory\r\nefficiency in the maintenance of order and security.--In many districts\r\nrobbing and plundering was going on with perfect impunity; the roads were\r\ninfested by bands of highwaymen; numerous assaults occurred, and several\r\nstage lines were considered unsafe. The statements of Major General Woods,\r\nBrigadier General Kilby Smith and Colonel Gilchrist, (accompanying\r\ndocuments Nos. 11, 9 and 18,) give a terrible picture of the state of\r\nthings in the localities they refer to. It is stated that civil officers\r\nare either unwilling or unable to enforce the laws; that one man does not\r\ndare to testify against another for fear of being murdered, and that the\r\nbetter elements of society are kept down by lawless characters under a\r\nsystem of terrorism. From my own observation I know that these things are\r\nnot confined to the districts mentioned in the documents above referred\r\nto. Both the governors of Alabama and Mississippi complained of it in\r\nofficial proclamations. Cotton, horse and cattle stealing was going on in\r\nall the States I visited on an extensive scale. Such a state of\r\ndemoralization would call for extraordinary measures in any country, and\r\nit is difficult to conceive how, in the face of the inefficiency of the\r\ncivil authorities, the removal of the troops can be thought of.\r\n\r\nIn speaking above of the improbability of an insurrectionary movement on a\r\nlarge scale, I did not mean to say that I considered resistance in detail\r\nto the execution of the laws of Congress and the measures of the\r\ngovernment impossible. Of all subjects connected with the negro question I\r\nshall speak in another part of this report. But there is another matter\r\nclaiming the attention and foresight of the government. It is well known\r\nthat the levying of taxes for the payment of the interest on our national\r\ndebt is, and will continue to be, very unpopular in the south. It is true,\r\nno striking demonstrations have as yet been made of any decided\r\nunwillingness on the part of the people to contribute to the discharge of\r\nour national obligations. But most of the conversations I had with\r\nsoutherners upon this subject led me to apprehend that they, politicians\r\nand people, are rather inclined to ask money of the government as\r\ncompensation for their emancipated slaves, for the rebuilding of the\r\nlevees on the Mississippi, and various kinds of damage done by our armies\r\nfor military purposes, than, as the current expression is, to \"help paying\r\nthe expenses of the whipping they have received.\" In fact, there are\r\nabundant indications in newspaper articles, public speeches, and\r\nelectioneering documents of candidates, which render it eminently probable\r\nthat on the claim of compensation for their emancipated slaves the\r\nsouthern States, as soon as readmitted to representation in Congress, will\r\nbe almost a unit. In the Mississippi convention the idea was broached by\r\nMr. Potter, in an elaborate speech, to have the late slave States relieved\r\nfrom taxation \"for years to come,\" in consideration of \"debt due them\" for\r\nthe emancipated slaves; and this plea I have frequently heard advocated in\r\nprivate conversations. I need not go into details as to the efforts made\r\nin some of the southern States in favor of the assumption by those States\r\nof their debts contracted during the rebellion. It may be assumed with\r\ncertainty that those who want to have the southern people, poor as they\r\nare, taxed for the payment of rebel debts, do not mean to have them taxed\r\nfor the purpose of meeting our national obligations. But whatever devices\r\nmay be resorted to, present indications justify the apprehension that the\r\nenforcement of our revenue laws will meet with a refractory spirit, and\r\nmay require sterner measures than the mere sending of revenue officers\r\ninto that part of the country.\r\n\r\nI have annexed to this report numerous letters addressed to me by\r\ngentlemen whose views on the loyalty of the southern people and kindred\r\ntopics, formed as they are upon an extended observation and long\r\nexperience, are entitled to consideration. (Letter of General Gillmore,\r\naccompanying document No. 1; letter of Dr. Mackey, No. 2; letter of Mr.\r\nSawyer, No. 3; letter of General Hatch, No. 4; letter of Mr. Pilsbury, No.\r\n5; statement of General Steedman, No. 6; letter of General Croxton, No. 7;\r\nletter of General Canby, No. 8; letter of General Kirby Smith, No. 9, &c.)\r\nIn these papers a variety of opinions is expressed, some to a certain\r\nextent sanguine, others based upon a less favorable experience. I offer\r\nthem to you, without exception, as they came to me. Many of the gentlemen\r\nwho wrote them have never been in any way connected with party politics,\r\nand their utterances may be looked upon as coming from unbiassed and\r\nimpartial observers.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO QUESTION--FIRST ASPECTS.\r\n\r\nThe principal cause of that want of national spirit which has existed in\r\nthe south so long, and at last gave birth to the rebellion, was, that the\r\nsouthern people cherished, cultivated, idolized their peculiar interests\r\nand institutions in preference to those which they had in common with the\r\nrest of the American people. Hence the importance of the negro question as\r\nan integral part of the question of union in general, and the question of\r\nreconstruction in particular.\r\n\r\nWhen the war came to a close, the labor system of the south was already\r\nmuch disturbed. During the progress of military operations large numbers\r\nof slaves had left their masters and followed the columns of our armies;\r\nothers had taken refuge in our camps; many thousands had enlisted in the\r\nservice of the national government. Extensive settlements of negroes had\r\nbeen formed along the seaboard and the banks of the Mississippi, under the\r\nsupervision of army officers and treasury agents, and the government was\r\nfeeding the colored refugees, who could not be advantageously employed, in\r\nthe so-called contraband camps. Many slaves had also been removed by their\r\nmasters, as our armies penetrated the country, either to Texas or to the\r\ninterior of Georgia and Alabama. Thus a considerable portion of the\r\nlaboring force had been withdrawn from its former employments. But a\r\nmajority of the slaves remained on the plantations to which they belonged,\r\nespecially in those parts of the country which were not touched by the\r\nwar, and where, consequently, the emancipation proclamation was not\r\nenforced by the military power. Although not ignorant of the stake they\r\nhad in the result of the contest, the patient bondmen waited quietly for\r\nthe development of things. But as soon as the struggle was finally\r\ndecided, and our forces were scattered about in detachments to occupy the\r\ncountry, the so far unmoved masses began to stir. The report went among\r\nthem that their liberation was no longer a mere contingency, but a fixed\r\nfact. Large numbers of colored people left the plantations; many flocked\r\nto our military posts and camps to obtain the certainty of their freedom,\r\nand others walked away merely for the purpose of leaving the places on\r\nwhich they had been held in slavery, and because they could now go with\r\nimpunity. Still others, and their number was by no means inconsiderable,\r\nremained with their former masters and continued their work on the field,\r\nbut under new and as yet unsettled conditions, and under the agitating\r\ninfluence of a feeling of restlessness. In some localities, however, where\r\nour troops had not yet penetrated and where no military post was within\r\nreach, planters endeavored and partially succeeded in maintaining between\r\nthemselves and the negroes the relation of master and slave, partly by\r\nconcealing from them the great changes that had taken place, and partly by\r\nterrorizing them into submission to their behests. But aside from these\r\nexceptions, the country found itself thrown into that confusion which is\r\nnaturally inseparable from a change so great and so sudden. The white\r\npeople were afraid of the negroes, and the negroes did not trust the white\r\npeople; the military power of the national government stood there, and was\r\nlooked up to, as the protector of both.\r\n\r\nUpon this power devolved the task to bring order into that chaos. But the\r\norder to be introduced was a new order, of which neither the late masters\r\nnor the late slaves had an adequate conception. All the elements of\r\nsociety being afloat, the difficulties were immense. The military officers\r\nand agents of the Freedmen's Bureau, to whom the negroes applied for\r\nadvice and guidance, either procured them such employment as could be\r\nfound, or persuaded them to return to their plantations and to continue in\r\nthe cultivation of the crops, promising them that their liberty, rights,\r\nand interests should be protected. Upon the planters they urged the\r\nnecessity of making fair and equitable contracts with the freedmen,\r\nadmonishing them to treat their laborers as free men ought to be treated.\r\nThese efforts met with such success as the difficulties surrounding the\r\nproblem permitted to expect. Large numbers of negroes went back to the\r\nfields, according to the advice they had received, but considerable\r\naccumulations still remained in and around the towns and along the\r\nseaboard, where there was no adequate amount of profitable employment for\r\nthem. The making and approving of contracts progressed as rapidly as the\r\nsmall number of officers engaged in that line of duty made it possible,\r\nbut not rapidly in proportion to the vast amount of work to be\r\naccomplished. The business experience of many of the officers was but\r\nlimited; here and there experiments were tried which had to be given up.\r\nIn numerous cases contracts were made and then broken, either by the\r\nemployers or the laborers, and the officers in charge were overwhelmed\r\nwith complaints from both sides. While many planters wanted to have the\r\nlaborers who had left them back on their plantations, others drove those\r\nthat had remained away, and thus increased the number of the unemployed.\r\nMoreover, the great change had burst upon the country in the midst of the\r\nagricultural labor season when the crops that were in the ground required\r\nsteady work to make them produce a satisfactory yield, and the\r\ninterruption of labor, which could not but be very extensive, caused\r\nconsiderable damage. In one word, the efforts made could not prevent or\r\nremedy, in so short a time, the serious disorders which are always\r\nconnected with a period of precipitous transition, and which, although\r\nnatural, are exceedingly embarrassing to those who have to deal with them.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the social problem in the south, if left to the free\r\naction of the southern people, will depend upon two things: 1, upon the\r\nideas entertained by the whites, the \"ruling class,\" of the problem, and\r\nthe manner in which they act upon their ideas; and 2, upon the capacity\r\nand conduct of the colored people.\r\n\r\nOPTIONS OF THE WHITES.\r\n\r\nThat the result of the free labor experiment made under circumstances so\r\nextremely unfavorable should at once be a perfect success, no reasonable\r\nperson would expect. Nevertheless, a large majority of the southern men\r\nwith whom I came into contact announced their opinions with so positive an\r\nassurance as to produce the impression that their minds were fully made\r\nup. In at least nineteen cases of twenty the reply I received to my\r\ninquiry about their views on the new system was uniformly this: \"You\r\ncannot make the negro work, without physical compulsion.\" I heard this\r\nhundreds of times, heard it wherever I went, heard it in nearly the same\r\nwords from so many different persons, that at last I came to the\r\nconclusion that this is the prevailing sentiment among the southern\r\npeople. There are exceptions to this rule, but, as far as my information\r\nextends, far from enough to affect the rule. In the accompanying documents\r\nyou will find an abundance of proof in support of this statement. There is\r\nhardly a paper relative to the negro question annexed to this report which\r\ndoes not, in some direct or indirect way, corroborate it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the disorders necessarily growing out of the transition\r\nstate continually furnished food for argument. I found but few people who\r\nwere willing to make due allowance for the adverse influence of\r\nexceptional circumstances. By a large majority of those I came in contact\r\nwith, and they mostly belonged to the more intelligent class, every\r\nirregularity that occurred was directly charged against the system of free\r\nlabor. If negroes walked away from the plantations, it was conclusive\r\nproof of the incorrigible instability of the negro, and the\r\nimpracticability of free negro labor. If some individual negroes violated\r\nthe terms of their contract, it proved unanswerably that no negro had, or\r\never would have, a just conception of the binding force of a contract, and\r\nthat this system of free negro labor was bound to be a failure. If some\r\nnegroes shirked, or did not perform their task with sufficient alacrity,\r\nit was produced as irrefutable evidence to show that physical compulsion\r\nwas actually indispensable to make the negro work. If negroes, idlers or\r\nrefugees crawling about the towns, applied to the authorities for\r\nsubsistence, it was quoted as incontestably establishing the point that\r\nthe negro was too improvident to take care of himself, and must\r\nnecessarily be consigned to the care of a master. I heard a Georgia\r\nplanter argue most seriously that one of his negroes had shown himself\r\ncertainly unfit for freedom because he impudently refused to submit to a\r\nwhipping. I frequently went into an argument with those putting forth such\r\ngeneral assertions, quoting instances in which negro laborers were working\r\nfaithfully, and to the entire satisfaction of their employers, as the\r\nemployers themselves had informed me. In a majority of cases the reply was\r\nthat we northern people did not understand the negro, but that they (the\r\nsoutherners) did; that as to the particular instances I quoted I was\r\nprobably mistaken; that I had not closely investigated the cases, or had\r\nbeen deceived by my informants; that they _knew_ the negro would not work\r\nwithout compulsion, and that nobody could make them believe he would.\r\nArguments like these naturally finished such discussions. It frequently\r\nstruck me that persons who conversed about every other subject calmly and\r\nsensibly would lose their temper as soon as the negro question was\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF SUCH OPINIONS, AND GENERAL TREATMENT OF THE NEGRO.\r\n\r\nA belief, conviction, or prejudice, or whatever you may call it, so widely\r\nspread and apparently so deeply rooted as this, that the negro will not\r\nwork without physical compulsion, is certainly calculated to have a very\r\nserious influence upon the conduct of the people entertaining it. It\r\nnaturally produced a desire to preserve slavery in its original form as\r\nmuch and as long as possible--and you may, perhaps, remember the admission\r\nmade by one of the provisional governors, over two months after the close\r\nof the war, that the people of his State still indulged in a lingering\r\nhope slavery might yet be preserved--or to introduce into the new system\r\nthat element of physical compulsion which would make the negro work.\r\nEfforts were, indeed, made to hold the negro in his old state of\r\nsubjection, especially in such localities where our military forces had\r\nnot yet penetrated, or where the country was not garrisoned in detail.\r\nHere and there planters succeeded for a limited period to keep their\r\nformer slaves in ignorance, or at least doubt, about their new rights; but\r\nthe main agency employed for that purpose was force and intimidation. In\r\nmany instances negroes who walked away from the plantations, or were found\r\nupon the roads, were shot or otherwise severely punished, which was\r\ncalculated to produce the impression among those remaining with their\r\nmasters that an attempt to escape from slavery would result in certain\r\ndestruction. A large proportion of the many acts of violence committed is\r\nundoubtedly attributable to this motive. The documents attached to this\r\nreport abound in testimony to this effect. For the sake of illustration I\r\nwill give some instances:\r\n\r\nBrigadier General Fessenden reported to Major General Gillmore from\r\nWinnsboro, South Carolina, July 19, as follows: \"The spirit of the people,\r\nespecially in those districts not subject to the salutary influence of\r\nGeneral Sherman's army, is that of concealed and, in some instances, of\r\nopen hostility, though there are some who strive with honorable good faith\r\nto promote a thorough reconciliation between the government and their\r\npeople. A spirit of bitterness and persecution manifests itself towards\r\nthe negroes. They are shot and abused outside the immediate protection of\r\nour forces _by men who announce their determination to take the law into\r\ntheir own hands, in defiance of our authority_. To protect the negro and\r\npunish these still rebellious individuals it will be necessary to have\r\nthis country pretty thickly settled with soldiers.\" I received similar\r\nverbal reports from other parts of South Carolina. To show the hopes still\r\nindulged in by some, I may mention that one of the sub-district\r\ncommanders, as he himself informed me, knew planters within the limits of\r\nhis command who had made contracts with their former slaves _avowedly_ for\r\nthe object of keeping them together on their plantations, so that they\r\nmight have them near at hand, and thus more easily reduce them to their\r\nformer condition, when, after the restoration of the civil power, the\r\n\"unconstitutional emancipation proclamation\" would be set aside.\r\n\r\nCases in which negroes were kept on the plantations, either by ruse or\r\nviolence, were frequent enough in South Carolina and Georgia to call forth\r\nfrom General Saxton a circular threatening planters who persisted in this\r\npractice with loss of their property, and from Major General Steedman,\r\ncommander of the department of Georgia, an order bearing upon the same\r\nsubject. At Atlanta, Georgia, I had an opportunity to examine some cases\r\nof the nature above described myself. While I was there, 9th and 10th of\r\nAugust, several negroes came into town with bullet and buckshot wounds in\r\ntheir bodies. From their statements, which, however, were only\r\ncorroborating information previously received, it appeared that the\r\nreckless and restless characters of that region had combined to keep the\r\nnegroes where they belonged. Several freedmen were shot in the attempt to\r\nescape, others succeeded in eluding the vigilance of their persecutors;\r\nlarge numbers, terrified by what they saw and heard, quietly remained\r\nunder the restraint imposed upon them, waiting for better opportunities.\r\nThe commander of the sub-district and post informed me that bands of\r\nguerillas were prowling about within a few miles of the city, making it\r\ndangerous for soldiers and freedmen to show themselves outside of the\r\nimmediate reach of the garrison, and that but a few days previous to my\r\narrival a small squad of men he had sent out to serve an order upon a\r\nplanter, concerning the treatment of freedmen, had been driven back by an\r\narmed band of over twenty men, headed by an individual in the uniform of a\r\nrebel officer.\r\n\r\nAs our troops in Georgia were at that time mostly concentrated at a number\r\nof central points, and not scattered over the State in small detachments,\r\nbut little information was obtained of what was going on in the interior\r\nof the country. A similar system was followed in Alabama, but enough has\r\nbecome known to indicate the condition of things in localities not\r\nimmediately under the eye of the military. In that State the efforts made\r\nto hold the negro in a state of subjection appear to have been of a\r\nparticularly atrocious nature. Rumors to that effect which reached me at\r\nMontgomery induced me to make inquiries at the post hospital. The records\r\nof that institution showed a number of rather startling cases which had\r\noccurred immediately after the close of the war, and some of a more recent\r\ndate; all of which proved that negroes leaving the plantations, and found\r\non the roads, were exposed to the savagest treatment. An extract from the\r\nrecords of the hospital is appended, (accompanying document No. 20;) also\r\na statement signed by the provost marshal at Selma, Alabama, Major J.P.\r\nHouston, (accompanying document No. 21.) He says: \"There have come to my\r\nnotice officially twelve cases, in which I am morally certain the trials\r\nhave not been had yet, that negroes were killed by whites. In a majority\r\nof cases the provocation consisted in the negroes' trying to come to town\r\nor to return to the plantation after having been sent away. The cases\r\nabove enumerated, I am convinced, are but a small part of those that have\r\nactually been perpetrated.\" In a report to General Swayne, assistant\r\ncommissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau, in Alabama, communicated to me by\r\nthe general, Captain Poillon, agent of the bureau at Mobile, says of the\r\ncondition of things in the southwestern part of the State, July 29: \"There\r\nare regular patrols posted on the rivers, who board some of the boats;\r\nafter the boats leave they hang, shoot, or drown the victims they may find\r\non them, and all those found on the roads or coming down the rivers are\r\nalmost invariably murdered. The bewildered and terrified freedmen know not\r\nwhat to do--to leave is death; to remain is to suffer the increased burden\r\nimposed upon them by the cruel taskmaster, whose only interest is their\r\nlabor, wrung from them by every device an inhuman ingenuity can devise;\r\nhence the lash and murder is resorted to to intimidate those whom fear of\r\nan awful death alone cause to remain, while patrols, negro dogs and spies,\r\ndisguised as Yankees, keep constant guard over these unfortunate people.\"\r\nIn a letter addressed to myself, September 9, Captain Poillon says:\r\n\"Organized patrols, with negro hounds, keep guard over the thoroughfares;\r\nbands of lawless robbers traverse the country, and the unfortunate who\r\nattempts to escape, or he who returns for his wife or child, is waylaid or\r\npursued with hounds, and shot or hung.\" (Accompanying document No. 22.)\r\n\r\nIn Mississippi I received information of a similar character. I would\r\nrespectfully invite your attention to two letters--one by Colonel Hayne,\r\n1st Texas cavalry, and one by Colonel Brinkerhoff--giving interesting\r\ndescriptions of the condition of the freedmen, and the spirit of the\r\nwhites shortly after the close of the war. (Accompanying documents Nos. 23\r\nand 24.) Lieutenant Colonel P.J. Yorke, post commander at port Gibson,\r\nMississippi, reported to General Davidson, on August 26, that a \"county\r\npatrol\" had been organized by citizens of his sub-district, which, for\r\nreasons given, he had been obliged to disband; one of these reasons was,\r\nin his own language, that: \"The company was formed out of what they called\r\npicked men, _i.e._, those only who had been actually engaged in the war,\r\nand were known as strong disunionists. The negroes in the sections of\r\ncountry these men controlled were kept in the most abject slavery, and\r\ntreated in every way contrary to the requirements of General Orders No.\r\n129, from the War Department.\" (Accompanying document No. 25.) As late as\r\nSeptember 29, Captain J.H. Weber, agent of the Freedmen's Bureau, reported\r\nto Colonel Thomas, assistant commissioner of the bureau, in the State of\r\nMississippi, as follows: \"In many cases negroes who left their homes\r\nduring the war, and have been within our military lines, and having\r\nprovided homes here for their families, going back to get their wives and\r\nchildren, have been driven off, and told that they could not have them. In\r\nseveral cases guards have been sent to aid people in getting their\r\nfamilies; in many others it has been impracticable, as the distance was\r\ntoo great. In portions of the northern part of this district the colored\r\npeople are kept in slavery still. The white people tell them that they\r\nwere free during the war, but the war is now over, and they must go to\r\nwork again as before. The reports from sub-commissioners nearest that\r\nlocality show that the blacks are in a much worse state than ever before,\r\nthe able-bodied being kept at work under the lash, and the young and\r\ninfirm driven off to care for themselves. As to protection from the civil\r\nauthorities, there is no such thing outside of this city.\" (Accompanying\r\ndocument No. 26.)\r\n\r\nThe conviction, however, that slavery in the old form cannot be maintained\r\nhas forced itself upon the minds of many of those who ardently desired its\r\npreservation. But while the necessity of a new system was recognized as\r\nfar as the right of property in the individual negro is concerned, many\r\nattempts were made to introduce into that new system the element of\r\nphysical compulsion, which, as above stated, is so generally considered\r\nindispensable. This was done by simply adhering, as to the treatment of\r\nthe laborers, as much as possible to the traditions of the old system,\r\neven where the relations between employers and laborers had been fixed by\r\ncontract. The practice of corporal punishment was still continued to a\r\ngreat extent, although, perhaps, not in so regular a manner as it was\r\npracticed in times gone by. It is hardly necessary to quote any\r\ndocumentary evidence on this point; the papers appended to this report are\r\nfull of testimony corroborating the statement. The habit is so inveterate\r\nwith a great many persons as to render, on the least provocation, the\r\nimpulse to whip a negro almost irresistible. It will continue to be so\r\nuntil the southern people will have learned, so as never to forget it,\r\nthat a black man has rights which a white man is bound to respect.\r\n\r\nHere I will insert some remarks on the general treatment of the blacks as\r\na class, from the whites as a class. It is not on the plantations and at\r\nthe hands of the planters themselves that the negroes have to suffer the\r\ngreatest hardships. Not only the former slaveholders, but the\r\nnon-slaveholding whites, who, even previous to the war, seemed to be more\r\nardent in their pro-slavery feelings than the planters themselves, are\r\npossessed by a singularly bitter and vindictive feeling against the\r\ncolored race since the negro has ceased to be property. The pecuniary\r\nvalue which the individual negro formerly represented having disappeared,\r\nthe maiming and killing of colored men seems to be looked upon by many as\r\none of those venial offences which must be forgiven to the outraged\r\nfeelings of a wronged and robbed people. Besides, the services rendered by\r\nthe negro to the national cause during the war, which make him an object\r\nof special interest to the loyal people, make him an object of particular\r\nvindictiveness to those whose hearts were set upon the success of the\r\nrebellion. The number of murders and assaults perpetrated upon negroes is\r\nvery great; we can form only an approximative estimate of what is going on\r\nin those parts of the south which are not closely garrisoned, and from\r\nwhich no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes\r\nof our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only\r\nmention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one negro was stabbed\r\nwith fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom\r\ndied. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat\r\nevidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with\r\ntheir lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the\r\nnumber of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain\r\nperiod of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is\r\nnot confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.\r\nSeveral \"gentlemen of standing\" have been tried before military\r\ncommissions for such offences.\r\n\r\nThese statements are naturally not intended to apply to all the\r\nindividuals composing the southern people. There are certainly many\r\nplanters who, before the rebellion, treated their slaves with kindness,\r\nand who now continue to treat them as free laborers in the same manner.\r\nThere are now undoubtedly many plantations in the south on which the\r\nrelations between employers and employees are based upon mutual good will.\r\nThere are certainly many people there who entertain the best wishes for\r\nthe welfare of the negro race, and who not only never participated in any\r\nacts of violence, but who heartily disapprove them. I have no doubt, a\r\nlarge majority can, _as to actual participation_--not, however, as to the\r\nbitter spirit--I offer a good plea of not guilty. But however large or\r\nsmall a number of people may be guilty of complicity in such acts of\r\npersecution, those who are opposed to them have certainly not shown\r\nthemselves strong enough to restrain those who perpetrate or favor them.\r\nSo far, the _spirit of persecution_ has shown itself so strong as to make\r\nthe protection of the freedman by the military arm of the government in\r\nmany localities necessary--in almost all, desirable. It must not be\r\nforgotten that in a community a majority of whose members is peaceably\r\ndisposed, but not willing or not able to enforce peace and order, a\r\ncomparatively small number of bold and lawless men can determine the\r\ncharacter of the whole. The rebellion itself, in some of the southern\r\nStates, furnished a striking illustration of this truth.\r\n\r\nGENERAL IDEAS AND SCHEMES OF WHITES CONCERNING THE FREEDMEN.\r\n\r\nSome of the planters with whom I had occasion to converse expressed their\r\ndetermination to adopt the course which best accords with the spirit of\r\nfree labor, to make the negro work by offering him fair inducements, to\r\nstimulate his ambition, and to extend to him those means of intellectual\r\nand moral improvement which are best calculated to make him an\r\nintelligent, reliable and efficient free laborer and a good and useful\r\ncitizen. Those who expressed such ideas were almost invariably professed\r\nUnion men, and far above the average in point of mental ability and\r\nculture. I found a very few instances of original secessionists also\r\nmanifesting a willingness to give the free-labor experiment a fair trial.\r\nI can represent the sentiments of this small class in no better way than\r\nby quoting the language used by an Alabama judge in a conversation with\r\nme. \"I am one of the most thoroughly whipped men in the south,\" said he;\r\n\"I am a genuine old secessionist, and I believe now, as I always did, we\r\nhad the constitutional right to secede. But the war has settled that\r\nmatter, and it is all over now. As to this thing of free negro labor, I do\r\nnot believe in it, but I will give it a fair trial. I have a plantation\r\nand am going to make contracts with my hands, and then I want a real\r\nYankee to run the machine for me; not one of your New Yorkers or\r\nPennsylvanians, but the genuine article from Massachusetts or Vermont--one\r\nwho can not only farm, but sing psalms and pray, and teach school--a real\r\nabolitionist, who believes in the thing just as I don't believe in it. If\r\nhe does not succeed, I shall consider it proof conclusive that you are\r\nwrong and I am right.\"\r\n\r\nI regret to say that views and intentions so reasonable I found confined\r\nto a small minority. Aside from the assumption that the negro will not\r\nwork without physical compulsion, there appears to be another popular\r\nnotion prevalent in the south, which stands as no less serious an obstacle\r\nin the way of a successful solution of the problem. It is that the negro\r\nexists for the special object of raising cotton, rice and sugar _for the\r\nwhites_, and that it is illegitimate for him to indulge, like other\r\npeople, in the pursuit of his own happiness in his own way. Although it is\r\nadmitted that he has ceased to be the property of a master, it is not\r\nadmitted that he has a right to become his own master. As Colonel Thomas,\r\nassistant commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau in Mississippi, in a\r\nletter addressed to me, very pungently expresses it: \"The whites esteem\r\nthe blacks their property by natural right, and, however much they may\r\nadmit that the relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by the\r\nwar and by the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have an\r\ningrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at large,\r\nand whenever opportunity serves, they treat the colored people just as\r\ntheir profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\" (Accompanying document No.\r\n27.) An ingrained feeling like this is apt to bring forth that sort of\r\nclass legislation which produces laws to govern one class with no other\r\nview than to benefit another. This tendency can be distinctly traced in\r\nthe various schemes for regulating labor which here and there see the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the emancipation of the slaves, when the general\r\nconfusion was most perplexing, the prevalent desire among the whites\r\nseemed to be, if they could not retain their negroes as slaves, to get rid\r\nof them entirely. Wild speculations were indulged in, how to remove the\r\ncolored population at once and to import white laborers to fill its place;\r\nhow to obtain a sufficient supply of coolies, &c., &c. Even at the present\r\nmoment the removal of the freedmen is strongly advocated by those who have\r\nthe traditional horror of a free negro, and in some sections, especially\r\nwhere the soil is more adapted to the cultivation of cereals than the\r\nraising of the staples, planters appear to be inclined to drive the\r\nnegroes away, at least from their plantations. I was informed by a\r\nprominent South Carolinian in July, that the planters in certain\r\nlocalities in the northwestern part of his State had been on the point of\r\ndoing so, but better counsel had been made to prevail upon them; and\r\nColonel Robinson, 97th United States Colored Infantry, who had been sent\r\nout to several counties in southern Alabama to administer the amnesty\r\noath, reported a general disposition among the planters of that region to\r\n\"set the colored people who had cultivated their crops during the summer,\r\nadrift as soon as the crops would be secured, and not to permit the negro\r\nto remain upon any footing of equality with the white man in that\r\ncountry.\" (Accompanying document No. 28.) The disposition to drive away\r\nall the negroes from the plantations was undoubtedly confined to a few\r\ndistricts; and as far as the scheme of wholesale deportation is concerned,\r\npractical men became aware, that if they wanted to have any labor done, it\r\nwould have been bad policy to move away the laborers they now have before\r\nothers were there to fill their places. All these devices promising at\r\nbest only distant relief, and free negro labor being the only thing in\r\nimmediate prospect, many ingenious heads set about to solve the problem,\r\nhow to make free labor compulsory by permanent regulations.\r\n\r\nShortly after the close of the war some South Carolina planters tried to\r\nsolve this problem by introducing into the contracts provisions leaving\r\nonly a small share of the crops to the freedmen, subject to all sorts of\r\nconstructive charges, and then binding them to work off the indebtedness\r\nthey might incur. It being to a great extent in the power of the employer\r\nto keep the laborer in debt to him, the employer might thus obtain a\r\npermanent hold upon the person of the laborer. It was something like the\r\nsystem of peonage existing in Mexico. When these contracts were submitted\r\nto the military authorities for ratification, General Hatch, commanding at\r\nCharleston, at once issued an order prohibiting such arrangements. I had\r\nan opportunity to examine one of these contracts, and found it drawn up\r\nwith much care, and evidently with a knowledge of the full bearings of the\r\nprovisions so inserted.\r\n\r\nAppended to this report is a memorandum of a conversation I had with Mr.\r\nW. King, of Georgia, a gentleman of good political sentiments and\r\nundoubtedly benevolent intentions. He recommends a kind of guardianship to\r\nbe exercised by the employer over the freedman. He is a fair\r\nrepresentative, not of the completely unprejudiced, but of the more\r\nliberal-minded class of planters, and his sayings show in what direction\r\neven those who are not actuated by any spirit of bitterness against the\r\nnegro, seek a way out of their perplexities. (Accompanying document No.\r\n29.)\r\n\r\nI annex also two documents submitted to Mr. Benjamin F. Flanders, special\r\ntreasury agent at New Orleans, who then had the management of freedmen's\r\naffairs in Louisiana, in November and December, 1864. They are not of a\r\nrecent date, but may be taken as true representations of the ideas and\r\nsentiments entertained by large numbers to-day. The first (accompanying\r\ndocument No. 30) contains \"suggestions on the wants of planters before\r\nembarking their capital in the cultivation of staple crops,\" and was\r\nsubmitted by a committee to a meeting of planters at New Orleans, November\r\n21, 1864. It speaks for itself. The others (accompanying document No. 31)\r\nis a letter addressed to Mr. Flanders by Mr. T. Gibson, a Louisiana\r\nplanter, who is well known in New Orleans as professing much affection for\r\nthe negro. It commences with the assertion that he \"has no prejudices to\r\novercome, and would do the black all the good in his power,\" and winds up\r\nwith a postscript strongly insisting upon the necessity of corporal\r\npunishment, the \"great desideratum in obtaining labor from free blacks\r\nbeing _its enforcement_.\"\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe motives and spirit bringing forth such ideas found a still clearer\r\nexpression in some attempted municipal regulations. In no State within the\r\nrange of my observation had, at the time of my visit, so much progress\r\nbeen made in the reorganization of local government as in Louisiana. In\r\nmost of the parishes the parish authorities had exercised their functions\r\nfor some time; in others the organization was less complete. Governor\r\nWells informed me that he had filled the parish offices with men\r\nrecommended to him by the people of the parishes, and it is fair to assume\r\nthat in most cases the appointees represented the views and sentiments of\r\nthe ruling class. Some of the local authorities so appointed furnished us\r\nan indication of the principles upon which they thought it best to\r\nregulate free labor within their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nMr. W.B. Stickney, agent of the Freedmen's Bureau at Shreveport,\r\nLouisiana, reported to the assistant commissioner of the bureau in\r\nLouisiana as follows: \"August 1.--The following is a literal copy of a\r\ndocument brought to this office by a colored man, which is conclusive\r\nevidence that there are those who still claim the negro as their property:\r\n\r\n\"'This boy Calvin has permit to hire to whom he pleases, but I shall hold\r\nhim as my property until set free by Congress. July 7, 1865. (Signed.)\r\nE.V. TULLY.'\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the above also made its appearance in another form, in the\r\naction of the police board of the parish of Bossier, which was an attempt\r\nto revive at once the old slave laws, and to prevent the freedmen from\r\nobtaining employment (away) from their former masters. The gist of the\r\nenactment alluded to is contained in the paragraph directing the officers\r\non patrol duty \"to arrest and take up all idle and vagrant persons running\r\nat large without employment and carry them before the proper authorities,\r\nto be dealt with as the law directs.\" A regulation like this certainly\r\nwould make it difficult for freedmen to leave their former masters for the\r\npurpose of seeking employment elsewhere. The matter was submitted to\r\nBrevet Major General Hawkins, commanding western district of Louisiana,\r\nwho issued an order prohibiting the parish police forces from arresting\r\nfreedmen unless for positive offence against the law.\r\n\r\nClearer and more significant was the ordnance passed by the police board\r\nof the town of Opelousas, Louisiana. (Accompanying document No. 34.) It\r\ndeserves careful perusal. Among a number of regulations applying\r\nexclusively to the negro, and depriving him of all liberty of locomotion,\r\nthe following striking provisions are found:\r\n\r\nSection 3. No negro or freedman shall be permitted to rent or keep a house\r\nwithin the limits of the town _under any circumstances_, and any one thus\r\noffending shall be ejected and _compelled to find an employer_ or leave\r\nthe town within twenty-four hours. The lessor or furnisher of the house\r\nleased or kept as above shall pay a fine of ten dollars for each offence.\r\n\r\nSection 4. No negro or freedman shall reside within the limits of the town\r\nof Opelousas _who is not in the regular service of some white person or\r\nformer owner_.\r\n\r\nSection 8. No freedman shall sell, barter or exchange, any articles of\r\nmerchandise or traffic within the limits of Opelousas without permission\r\nin writing from his employer, or the mayor, or president of the board.\r\n\r\nThis ordinance was at first approved by a lieutenant colonel of the United\r\nStates forces having local command there, and it is worthy of note that\r\nthereupon the infection spread at once, and similar ordinances were\r\nentertained by the police boards of the town of Franklin and of the parish\r\nof St. Landry. (Accompanying document No. 35). The parish ordinance of St.\r\nLandry differs from the town ordinances of Opelousas and Franklin in\r\nseveral points, and wherever there is any difference, it is in the\r\ndirection of greater severity. It imposes heavier fines and penalties\r\nthroughout, and provides, in addition, for a system of corporal\r\npunishment. It is also ordained \"that the aforesaid penalties shall be\r\n_summarily enforced_, and that it shall be the duty of the _captain or\r\nchief of patrol_ to see that the aforesaid ordinances are promptly\r\nexecuted.\" While the town ordinances provide that a negro who does not\r\nfind an employer shall be compelled to leave the town, the parish or\r\ncounty ordinance knows nothing of letting the negro go, but simply\r\n_compels_ him to find an employer. Finally, it is ordained \"that it shall\r\nbe the duty of every _citizen_ to act as a police officer for the\r\ndetection of offences and the apprehension of offenders, who shall be\r\nimmediately handed over to the proper captain or chief of patrol.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true, an \"organization of free labor\" upon this plan would not be\r\nexactly the re-establishment of slavery in its old form, but as for the\r\npractical working of the system with regard to the welfare of the\r\nfreedman, the difference would only be for the worse. The negro is not\r\nonly not permitted to be idle, but he is positively prohibited from\r\nworking or carrying on a business for himself; he is _compelled_ to be in\r\nthe \"regular service\" of a white man, and if he has no employer he is\r\n_compelled_ to find one. It requires only a simple understanding among the\r\nemployers, and the negro is just as much bound to his employer \"for better\r\nand for worse\" as he was when slavery existed in the old form. If he\r\nshould attempt to leave his employer on account of non-payment of wages or\r\nbad treatment he is _compelled_ to find another one; and if no other will\r\ntake him he will be _compelled_ to return to him from whom he wanted to\r\nescape. The employers, under such circumstances, are naturally at liberty\r\nto arrange the matter of compensation according to their tastes, for the\r\nnegro will be compelled to be in the regular service of an employer,\r\nwhether he receives wages or not. The negro may be permitted by his\r\nemployer \"to hire his own time,\" for in the spirit and intent of the\r\nordinance his time never properly belongs to him. But even the old system\r\nof slavery was more liberal in this respect, for such \"permission to hire\r\nhis own time\" \"shall never extend over seven days at any one time.\" (Sec.\r\n4.) The sections providing for the \"_summary_\" enforcement of the\r\npenalties and placing their infliction into the hands of the \"chief of\r\npatrol\"--which, by the way, throws some light upon the objects for which\r\nthe militia is to be reorganized--place the freedmen under a sort of\r\npermanent martial law, while the provision investing every white man with\r\nthe power and authority of a police officer as against every black man\r\nsubjects them to the control even of those individuals who in other\r\ncommunities are thought hardly fit to control themselves. On the whole,\r\nthis piece of legislation is a striking embodiment of the idea that\r\nalthough the former owner has lost his individual right of property in the\r\nformer slave, \"the blacks at large belong to the whites at large.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the \"organization of free labor\" ordained by officials appointed\r\nby Governor Wells, and these ordinances were passed while both the\r\nemancipation proclamation and a provision in the new constitution of\r\nLouisiana abolishing slavery in that State forever were recognized as\r\nbeing in full force. It is needless to say that as soon as these\r\nproceedings came to the knowledge of the Freedmen's Bureau and the\r\ndepartment commander they were promptly overruled. But Governor Wells did\r\nnot remove the police boards that had thus attempted to revive slavery in\r\na new form.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to the negro's controlling his own labor, carrying on\r\nbusiness independently on his own account--in one word, working for his\r\nown benefit--showed itself in a variety of ways. Here and there municipal\r\nregulations were gotten up heavily taxing or otherwise impeding those\r\ntrades and employments in which colored people are most likely to engage.\r\nAs an illustration, I annex an ordinance passed by the common council of\r\nVicksburg, (accompanying document No. 36,) together with a letter from\r\nColonel Thomas, in which he says: \"You will see by the city ordinance that\r\na drayman, or hackman, must file a bond of five hundred dollars, in\r\naddition to paying for his license. The mayor requires that the bondsmen\r\nmust be freeholders. The laws of this State do not, and never did, allow a\r\nnegro to own land or hold property; the white citizens refuse to sign any\r\nbonds for the freedmen. The white citizens and authorities say that it is\r\nfor their interest to drive out all independent negro labor; that the\r\nfreedmen must hire to white men if they want to do this kind of work.\" I\r\nfound several instances of a similar character in the course of my\r\nobservations, of which I neglected to procure the documentary evidence.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that these are mere isolated cases; and so they are. But\r\nthey are the local outcroppings of a spirit which I found to prevail\r\neverywhere. If there is any difference, it is in the degree of its\r\nintensity and the impatience or boldness with which it manifests itself.\r\nOf the agencies which so far restrained it from venturing more general\r\ndemonstrations I shall speak in another part of this report.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION OF THE FREEDMEN.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that all those who sincerely desire to make the freedman a\r\nfreeman in the true sense of the word, must also be in favor of so\r\neducating him as to make him clearly understand and appreciate the\r\nposition he is to occupy in life, with all its rights and corresponding\r\nduties, and to impart to him all the knowledge necessary for enabling him\r\nto become an intelligent co-operator in the general movements of society.\r\nAs popular education is the true ground upon which the efficiency and the\r\nsuccesses of free-labor society grow, no man who rejects the former can be\r\naccounted a consistent friend of the latter. It is also evident that the\r\neducation of the negro, to become general and effective after the full\r\nrestoration of local government in the south, must be protected and\r\npromoted as an integral part of the educational systems of the States.\r\n\r\nI made it a special point in most of the conversations I had with southern\r\nmen to inquire into their views with regard to this subject. I found,\r\nindeed, some gentlemen of thought and liberal ideas who readily\r\nacknowledged the necessity of providing for the education of the colored\r\npeople, and who declared themselves willing to co-operate to that end to\r\nthe extent of their influence. Some planters thought of establishing\r\nschools on their estates, and others would have been glad to see measures\r\ntaken to that effect by the people of the neighborhoods in which they\r\nlived. But whenever I asked the question whether it might be hoped that\r\nthe legislatures of their States or their county authorities would make\r\nprovisions for negro education, I never received an affirmative, and only\r\nin two or three instances feebly encouraging answers. At last I was forced\r\nto the conclusion that, aside from a small number of honorable exceptions,\r\nthe popular prejudice is almost as bitterly set against the negro's having\r\nthe advantage of education as it was when the negro was a slave. There may\r\nbe an improvement in that respect, but it would prove only how universal\r\nthe prejudice was in former days. Hundreds of times I heard the old\r\nassertion repeated, that \"learning will spoil the nigger for work,\" and\r\nthat \"negro education will be the ruin of the south.\" Another most\r\nsingular notion still holds a potent sway over the minds of the masses--it\r\nis, that the elevation of the blacks will be the degradation of the\r\nwhites. They do not understand yet that the continual contact with an\r\nignorant and degraded population must necessarily lower the mental and\r\nmoral tone of the other classes of society. This they might have learned\r\nfrom actual experience, as we in the north have been taught, also by\r\nactual experience, that the education of the lower orders is the only\r\nreliable basis of the civilization as well as of the prosperity of a\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of the prejudice prevailing in the southern States is that\r\ncolored schools can be established and carried on with safety only under\r\nthe protection of our military forces, and that where the latter are\r\nwithdrawn the former have to go with them. There may be a few localities\r\nforming exceptions, but their number is certainly very small. I annex a\r\nfew papers bearing upon this subject. One is a letter addressed to me by\r\nChaplain Joseph Warren, superintendent of education under the Freedmen's\r\nBureau in Mississippi. (Accompanying document No. 37.) The long and\r\nextensive experience of the writer gives the views he expresses more than\r\nordinary weight. After describing the general spirit of opposition to the\r\neducation of the negroes exhibited in Mississippi, and enumerating the\r\nreasons assigned for it, he says: \"In view of these things I have no doubt\r\nbut that, if our protection be withdrawn, negro education will be hindered\r\nin every possible way, including obstructions by fraud and violence. I\r\nhave not the smallest expectation that, with the State authorities in full\r\npower, a northern citizen would be protected in the exercise of his\r\nconstitutional right to teach and preach to the colored people, and shall\r\nlook for a renewal of the fearful scenes in which northerners were\r\nwhipped, tarred and feathered, warned off, and murdered, before the war.\"\r\nThe letter gives many details in support of this conclusion, and is in\r\nevery respect worth perusing.\r\n\r\nIn the letter of General Kirby Smith (Accompanying document No. 9) occurs\r\nthe following statement referring to the condition of things in Mobile,\r\nAlabama: \"Threats were made to destroy all school-houses in which colored\r\nchildren were taught, and in two instances they were fired. The same\r\nthreats were made against all churches in which colored people assembled\r\nto worship, and one of them burned. Continued threats of assassination\r\nwere made against the colored preachers, and one of them is now under\r\nspecial guard by order of Major General Woods.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Louisiana General Canby received a petition, signed by a\r\nnumber of prominent citizens of New Orleans, praying him \"to annul Order\r\nNo. 38, which authorizes a board of officers to levy a tax on the\r\ntaxpayers of the parish of Orleans to defray the expense of educating the\r\nfreedmen.\" The reasons given for making this request are as follows: \"Most\r\nof those who have lost their slaves by the rebellion, and whose lands are\r\nin the course of confiscation, being thus deprived of the means of raising\r\ncorn for their hungry children, have not anything left wherewith to pay\r\nsuch a tax. The order in question, they consider, violates that sacred\r\nprinciple which requires taxation to be equal throughout the United\r\nStates. _If the freedmen are to be educated at public expense, let it be\r\ndone from the treasury of the United States_.\" (Accompanying document No.\r\n38.) Many of the signers of this petition, who wanted to be relieved of\r\nthe school tax on the ground of poverty, were counted among the wealthy\r\nmen of New Orleans, and they forgot to state that the free colored element\r\nof Louisiana, which represents a capital of at least thirteen millions and\r\npays a not inconsiderable proportion of the taxes, contributes at the same\r\ntime for the support of the schools for whites, from which their children\r\nare excluded. I would also invite attention to some statements concerning\r\nthis matter contained in the memorandum of my conversation with Mr. King,\r\nof Georgia. (Accompanying document No. 29.)\r\n\r\nWhile travelling in the south I found in the newspapers an account of an\r\ninterview between General Howard and some gentlemen from Mississippi, in\r\nwhich a Dr. Murdoch, from Columbus, Mississippi, figured somewhat\r\nconspicuously. He was reported to have described public sentiment in\r\nMississippi as quite loyal, and especially in favor of giving the colored\r\nrace a good education. I inquired at the Freedmen's Bureau whether\r\nanything was known there of a feeling so favorable to negro education\r\namong Dr. Murdoch's neighbors. The information I received is contained in\r\na letter from the assistant commissioner, Colonel Thomas. (Accompanying\r\ndocument No. 39.) It appears that the feeling of Dr. Murdoch's neighbors\r\nat Columbus was not only not in favor of negro education, but that,\r\naccording to the report of the agent of the Freedmen's Bureau at that\r\nplace, \"the citizens of the town are so prejudiced against the negroes\r\nthat they are opposed to all efforts being made for their education or\r\nelevation;\" that \"the people will not give rooms or allow the children of\r\ntheir hired freedmen to attend the schools,\" and that the citizens of the\r\nplace have written a letter to the officers, saying \"that they would\r\nrespectfully ask that no freedmen's schools be established under the\r\nauspices of the bureau, as it would tend to disturb the present labor\r\nsystem, and take from the fields labor that is so necessary to restore the\r\nwealth of the State.\" It seems Dr. Murdoch's neighbors do not form an\r\nexception to the general rule. In this connexion I may add that several\r\ninstances have come to my notice of statements about the condition of\r\nthings in the late rebel States, being set afloat by southerners visiting\r\nthe north, which would not bear close investigation. The reason, probably,\r\nis that gentlemen are attributing their own good intentions to the rest of\r\ntheir people with too great a liberality.\r\n\r\nHaving thus given my experience and impressions with regard to the spirit\r\nactuating the southern people concerning the freedman and the free-labor\r\nproblem, and before inquiring into their prospective action, I beg leave\r\nto submit a few remarks on the conduct of the negro.\r\n\r\nTHE FREEDMAN.\r\n\r\nThe first southern men with whom I came into contact after my arrival at\r\nCharleston designated the general conduct of the emancipated slaves as\r\nsurprisingly good. Some went even so far as to call it admirable. The\r\nconnexion in which they used these laudatory terms was this: A great many\r\ncolored people while in slavery had undoubtedly suffered much hardship\r\nand submitted to great wrongs, partly inseparably connected with\r\nthe condition of servitude, and partly aggravated by the individual\r\nwilfulness and cruelty of their masters and overseers. They were suddenly\r\nset free; and not only that: their masters but a short time ago almost\r\nomnipotent on their domains, found themselves, after their defeat in the\r\nwar, all at once face to face with their former slaves as a conquered and\r\npowerless class. Never was the temptation to indulge in acts of vengeance\r\nfor wrongs suffered more strongly presented than to the colored people of\r\nthe south; but no instance of such individual revenge was then on record,\r\nnor have I since heard of any case of violence that could be traced\r\nto such motives. The transition of the southern negro from slavery to\r\nfreedom was untarnished by any deeds of blood, and the apprehension so\r\nextensively entertained and so pathetically declaimed upon by many, that\r\nthe sudden and general emancipation of the slaves would at once result in\r\n\"all the horrors of St. Domingo,\" proved utterly groundless. This was the\r\nfirst impression I received after my arrival in the south, and I received\r\nit from the mouths of late slaveholders. Nor do I think the praise was\r\nunjustly bestowed. In this respect the emancipated slaves of the south\r\ncan challenge comparison with any race long held in servitude and\r\nsuddenly set free. As to the dangers of the future, I shall speak of them\r\nin another connexion.\r\n\r\nBut at that point the unqualified praise stopped and the complaints began:\r\nthe negroes would not work; they left their plantations and went wandering\r\nfrom place to place, stealing by the way; they preferred a life of\r\nidleness and vagrancy to that of honest and industrious labor; they either\r\ndid not show any willingness to enter into contracts, or, if they did,\r\nshowed a stronger disposition to break them than to keep them; they were\r\nbecoming insubordinate and insolent to their former owners; they indulged\r\nin extravagant ideas about their rights and relied upon the government to\r\nsupport them without work; in one word, they had no conception of the\r\nrights freedom gave, and of the obligations freedom imposed upon them.\r\nThese complaints I heard repeated with endless variations wherever I went.\r\nNor were they made without some show of reason. I will review them one\r\nafter another.\r\n\r\n_Unwillingness to work_.--That there are among the negroes a good many\r\nconstitutionally lazy individuals is certainly true. The propensity to\r\nidleness seems to be rather strongly developed in the south generally,\r\nwithout being confined to any particular race. It is also true that the\r\nalacrity negroes put into their work depends in a majority of cases upon\r\ncertain combinations of circumstances. It is asserted that the negroes\r\nhave a prejudice against working in the cultivation of cotton, rice, and\r\nsugar. Although this prejudice, probably arising from the fact that the\r\ncotton, rice, and sugar fields remind the former slave of the worst\r\nexperiences of his past life, exists to some extent, it has not made the\r\nfreedmen now on the plantations unwilling to cultivate such crops as the\r\nplanters may have seen fit to raise. A few cases of refusal may have\r\noccurred. But there is another fact of which I have become satisfied in\r\nthe course of my observations, and which is of great significance: while\r\nmost of the old slaveholders complain of the laziness and instability of\r\ntheir negro laborers, the northern men engaged in planting, with whom I\r\nhave come into contact, almost uniformly speak of their negro laborers\r\nwith satisfaction, and these northern men almost exclusively devote\r\nthemselves to the cultivation of cotton. A good many southern planters, in\r\nview of the fact, expressed to me their intention to engage northern men\r\nfor the management of their plantations. This circumstance would seem to\r\nprove that under certain conditions the negro may be expected to work\r\nwell. There are two reasons by which it may be explained: first, that a\r\nnorthern man knows from actual experience what free labor is, and\r\nunderstands its management, which the late slaveholder, still clinging to\r\nthe traditions of the old system, does not; and then, that the negro has\r\nmore confidence in a northern man than in his former master. When a\r\nnorthern man discovers among his laboring force an individual that does\r\nnot do his duty, his first impulse is to discharge him, and he acts\r\naccordingly. When a late slaveholder discovers such an individual among\r\nhis laborers, his first impulse is to whip him, and he is very apt to suit\r\nthe act to the impulse. Ill treatment is a doubtful encouragement for free\r\nlaborers, and it proves more apt to drive those that are still at work\r\naway than to make the plantation attractive to others. But if the reasons\r\nabove stated are sufficient to explain why the negroes work better for\r\nnorthern than for southern men, it will follow that a general improvement\r\nwill take place as soon as the latter fulfil the same conditions--that is,\r\nas soon as southern men learn what free labor is and how to manage it in\r\naccordance with its principles, and as soon as they succeed in gaining the\r\nconfidence of the colored people.\r\n\r\nIn the reports of officers of the Freedmen's Bureau, among the documents\r\nannexed to this, you will find frequent repetitions of the statement that\r\nthe negro generally works well where he is decently treated and well\r\ncompensated. Nor do the officers of the Freedmen's Bureau alone think and\r\nsay so. Southern men, who were experimenting in the right direction,\r\nexpressed to me their opinion to the same effect. Some of them told me\r\nthat the negroes on their plantations worked \"as well as ever,\" or even\r\n\"far better than they had expected.\" It is true the number of planters who\r\nmade that admission was small, but it nearly corresponded with the number\r\nof those who, according to their own statements, gave free negro labor a\r\nperfectly fair trial, while all those who prefaced everything they said\r\nwith the assertion that \"the negro will not work without physical\r\ncompulsion,\" could find no end to their complaints. There are undoubtedly\r\nnegroes who will not do well under the best circumstances, just as there\r\nare others who will do well under the worst.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this report I have already set forth the exceptional\r\ndifficulties weighing upon the free-labor experiment in the south during\r\nthis period of transition. The sudden leap from slavery to freedom is an\r\nexciting event in a man's life, and somewhat calculated to disturb his\r\nequanimity for a moment. People are on such occasions disposed to indulge\r\nthemselves a little. It would have shown much more wisdom in the negroes\r\nif all of them had quietly gone to work again the next day. But it is not\r\nreasonable to expect the negroes to possess more wisdom than other races\r\nwould exhibit under the same circumstances. Besides, the willingness to\r\nwork depends, with whites as well as blacks, somewhat upon the nature of\r\nthe inducements held out, and the unsatisfactory regulation of the matter\r\nof wages has certainly something to do with the instability of negro labor\r\nwhich is complained of. Northern men engaged in planting almost uniformly\r\npay wages in money, while southern planters, almost uniformly, have\r\ncontracted with their laborers for a share in the crop. In many instances\r\nthe shares are allotted between employers and laborers with great\r\nfairness; but in others the share promised to the laborers is so small as\r\nto leave them in the end very little or nothing. Moreover, the crops in\r\nthe south looked generally very unpromising from the beginning, which\r\nnaturally reduced the value falling to the lot of the laborer. I have\r\nheard a good many freedmen complain that, taking all things into\r\nconsideration, they really did not know what they were working for except\r\nfood, which in many instances was bad and scanty; and such complaints were\r\nfrequently well founded. In a large number of cases the planters were not\r\nto blame for this; they had no available pecuniary means, and in many\r\nlocalities found it difficult to procure provisions. But these unfavorable\r\ncircumstances, combined with the want of confidence in northern men, were\r\nwell calculated to have an influence upon the conduct of the negro as a\r\nlaborer.\r\n\r\nI have heard it said that money is no inducement which will make a negro\r\nwork. It is certain that many of them, immediately after emancipation, had\r\nbut a crude conception of the value of money and the uses it can be put\r\nto. It may, however, be stated as the general rule, that whenever they are\r\nat liberty to choose between wages in money and a share in the crop, they\r\nwill choose the former and work better. Many cases of negroes engaged in\r\nlittle industrial pursuits came to my notice, in which they showed\r\nconsiderable aptness not only for gaining money, but also for saving and\r\njudiciously employing it. Some were even surprisingly successful. I\r\nvisited some of the plantations divided up among freedmen and cultivated\r\nby them independently without the supervision of white men. In some\r\ninstances I found very good crops and indications of general thrift and\r\ngood management; in others the corn and cotton crops were in a neglected\r\nand unpromising state. The excuse made was in most cases that they had\r\nobtained possession of the ground too late in the season, and that, until\r\nthe regular crops could be harvested, they were obliged to devote much of\r\ntheir time to the raising and sale of vegetables, watermelons, &c., for\r\nthe purpose of making a living in the meantime.\r\n\r\nOn the whole I feel warranted in making the following statement: Many\r\nfreedmen--not single individuals, but whole \"plantation gangs\"--are\r\nworking well; others do not. The difference in their efficiency coincides\r\nin a great measure with a certain difference in the conditions under which\r\nthey live. The conclusion lies near, that if the conditions under which\r\nthey work well become general, their efficiency as free laborers will\r\nbecome general also, aside from individual exceptions. Certain it is, that\r\nby far the larger portion of the work done in the south is done by\r\nfreedmen.\r\n\r\n_Vagrancy_.--Large numbers of colored people left the plantations as soon\r\nas they became aware that they could do so with impunity. That they could\r\nso leave their former masters was for them the first test of the reality\r\nof their freedom. A great many flocked to the military posts and towns to\r\nobtain from the \"Yankees\" reliable information as to their new rights.\r\nOthers were afraid lest by staying on the plantations where they had been\r\nheld as slaves they might again endanger their freedom. Still others went\r\nto the cities, thinking that there the sweets of liberty could best be\r\nenjoyed. In some places they crowded together in large numbers, causing\r\nserious inconvenience. But a great many, probably a very large majority,\r\nremained on the plantations and made contracts with their former masters.\r\nThe military authorities, and especially the agents of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, succeeded by continued exertions in returning most of those who\r\nwere adrift to the plantations, or in finding other employment for them.\r\nAfter the first rush was over the number of vagrants grew visibly less.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that where the Freedmen's Bureau is best organized\r\nthere is least vagrancy among the negroes. Here and there they show\r\nconsiderable restlessness, partly owing to local, partly to general\r\ncauses. Among the former, bad treatment is probably the most\r\nprominent; among the latter, a feeling of distrust, uneasiness,\r\nanxiety about their future, which arises from their present unsettled\r\ncondition. It is true, some are going from place to place because they\r\nare fond of it. The statistics of the Freedmen's Bureau show that the\r\nwhole number of colored people supported by the government since the\r\nclose of the war was remarkably small and continually decreasing.\r\nThis seems to show that the southern negro, when thrown out of his\r\naccustomed employment, possesses considerable ability to support\r\nhimself. It is possible, however, that in consequence of short crops,\r\nthe destitution of the country, and other disturbing influences, there\r\nmay be more restlessness among the negroes next winter than there\r\nis at present. Where the results of this year's labor were very\r\nunsatisfactory, there will be a floating about of the population when\r\nthe contracts of this year expire. It is to be expected, however, that\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau will be able to remedy evils of that kind. Other\r\nemancipatory movements, for instance the abolition of serfdom in\r\nRussia, have resulted in little or no vagrancy; but it must not be\r\nforgotten that the emancipated serfs were speedily endowed with the\r\nownership of land, which gave them a permanent moral and material\r\ninterest in the soil upon which they lived. A similar measure would do\r\nmore to stop negro vagrancy in the south than the severest penal laws.\r\nIn every country the number of vagrants stands in proportion to the\r\nnumber of people who have no permanent local interests, unless\r\naugmented by exceptional cases, such as war or famine.\r\n\r\n_Contracts_.--Freedmen frequently show great disinclination to make\r\ncontracts with their former masters. They are afraid lest in signing a\r\npaper they sign away their freedom, and in this respect they are\r\ndistrustful of most southern men. It generally requires personal\r\nassurances from a United States officer to make them feel safe. But the\r\nadvice of such an officer is almost uniformly followed. In this manner an\r\nimmense number of contracts has been made, and it is daily increasing. A\r\nnorthern man has no difficulty in making contracts, and but little in\r\nenforcing them. The complaints of southern men that the contracts are not\r\nwell observed by the freedmen are in many instances well founded. The same\r\ncan be said of the complaints of freedmen with regard to the planters. The\r\nnegro, fresh from slavery, has naturally but a crude idea of the binding\r\nforce of a written agreement, and it is galling to many of the planters to\r\nstand in such relations as a contract establishes to those who formerly\r\nwere their slaves. I was, however, informed by officers of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, and by planters also, that things were improving in that respect.\r\nContracts will be more readily entered into and more strictly kept as soon\r\nas the intimate relations between labor and compensation are better\r\nunderstood and appreciated on both sides.\r\n\r\n_Insolence and insubordination_.--The new spirit which emancipation has\r\nawakened in the colored people has undoubtedly developed itself in some\r\nindividuals, especially young men, to an offensive degree. Hence cases of\r\ninsolence on the part of freedmen occur. But such occurrences are\r\ncomparatively rare. On the whole, the conduct of the colored people is far\r\nmore submissive than anybody had a right to expect. The acts of violence\r\nperpetrated by freedmen against white persons do not stand in any\r\nproportion to those committed by whites against negroes. Every such\r\noccurrence is sure to be noticed in the southern papers and we have heard\r\nof but very few.\r\n\r\nWhen Southern people speak of the insolence of the negro, they generally\r\nmean something which persons who never lived under the system of slavery\r\nare not apt to appreciate. It is but very rarely what would be called\r\ninsolence among equals. But, as an old planter said to me, \"our people\r\ncannot realize yet that the negro is free.\" A negro is called insolent\r\nwhenever his conduct varies in any manner from what a southern man was\r\naccustomed to when slavery existed.\r\n\r\nThe complaints made about the insubordination of the negro laborers on\r\nplantations have to be taken with the same allowance. There have been, no\r\ndoubt, many cases in which freedmen showed a refractory spirit, where\r\norders were disobeyed, and instructions disregarded. There have been some\r\ninstances of positive resistance. But when inquiring into particulars, I\r\nfound not unfrequently that the employer had adhered too strictly to his\r\nold way of doing things. I hardly heard any such complaints from Northern\r\nmen. I have heard planters complain very earnestly of the insubordinate\r\nspirit of their colored laborers because they remonstrated against the\r\npractice of corporeal punishment. This was looked upon as a symptom of an\r\nimpending insurrection. A great many things are regarded in the old slave\r\nStates as acts of insubordination on the part of the laborer which, in the\r\nfree States, would be taken as perfectly natural and harmless. The fact\r\nis, a good many planters are at present more nervously jealous of their\r\nauthority than before, while the freedmen are not always inclined to\r\nforget that they are free men.\r\n\r\n_Extravagant notions_.--In many localities I found an impression\r\nprevailing among the negroes that some great change was going to take\r\nplace about Christmas. Feeling uneasy in their present condition, they\r\nindulged in the expectation that government intended to make some further\r\nprovision for their future welfare, especially by ordering distributions\r\nof land among them. To counteract this expectation, which had a tendency\r\nto interfere seriously with the making of contracts for the next season,\r\nit was considered necessary to send military officers, and especially\r\nagents of the Freedmen's Bureau, among them, who, by administering sound\r\nadvice and spreading correct information, would induce them to suit their\r\nconduct to their actual circumstances. While in the south I heard of many\r\ninstances in which this measure had the desired effect, and it is to be\r\nexpected that the effect was uniformly good wherever judicious officers\r\nwere so employed.\r\n\r\nImpressions like the above are very apt to spread among the negroes, for\r\nthe reason that they ardently desire to become freeholders. In the\r\nindependent possession of landed property they see the consummation of\r\ntheir deliverance. However mistaken their notions may be in other\r\nrespects, it must be admitted that this instinct is correct.\r\n\r\n_Relations between the two races_.--There are whites in the south who\r\nprofess great kindness for the negro. Many of them are, no doubt, sincere\r\nin what they say. But as to the feelings of the masses, it is hardly\r\nnecessary to add anything to what I have already stated. I have heard it\r\nasserted that the negroes also cherish feelings of hostility to the\r\nwhites. Taking this as a general assertion, I am satisfied that it is\r\nincorrect. The negroes do not trust their late masters because they do not\r\nfeel their freedom sufficiently assured. Many of them may harbor feelings\r\nof resentment towards those who now ill-treat and persecute them, but as\r\nthey practiced no revenge after their emancipation for wrongs suffered\r\nwhile in slavery, so their present resentments are likely to cease as soon\r\nas the persecution ceases. If the persecution and the denial of their\r\nrights as freemen continue, the resentments growing out of them will\r\ncontinue and spread. The negro is constitutionally docile and eminently\r\ngood-natured. Instances of the most touching attachment of freedmen to\r\ntheir old masters and mistresses have come to my notice. To a white man\r\nwhom they believe to be sincerely their friend they cling with greater\r\naffection even than to one of their own race. By some northern speculators\r\ntheir confidence has been sadly abused. Nevertheless, the trust they place\r\nin persons coming from the north, or in any way connected with the\r\ngovernment, is most childlike and unbounded. There may be individual\r\nexceptions, but I am sure they are not numerous. Those who enjoy their\r\nconfidence enjoy also their affection. Centuries of slavery have not been\r\nsufficient to make them the enemies of the white race. If in the future a\r\nfeeling of mutual hostility should develop itself between the races, it\r\nwill probably not be the fault of those who have shown such an\r\ninexhaustible patience under the most adverse and trying circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn some places that I visited I found apprehensions entertained by whites\r\nof impending negro insurrections. Whenever our military commanders found\r\nit expedient to subject the statements made to that effect by whites to\r\nclose investigation, they uniformly found them unwarranted by fact. In\r\nmany instances there were just reasons for supposing that such\r\napprehensions were industriously spread for the purpose of serving as an\r\nexcuse for further persecution. In the papers annexed to this report you\r\nwill find testimony supporting this statement. The negro is easily led; he\r\nis always inclined to follow the advice of those he trusts. I do,\r\ntherefore, not consider a negro insurrection probable as long as the\r\nfreedmen are under the direct protection of the government, and may hope\r\nto see their grievances redressed without resorting to the extreme means\r\nof self-protection. There would, perhaps, be danger of insurrections if\r\nthe government should withdraw its protection from them, and if, against\r\nan attempt on the part of the whites to reduce them to something like\r\ntheir former condition, they should find themselves thrown back upon their\r\nown resources. Of this contingency I shall speak below.\r\n\r\n_Education_.--That the negroes should have come out of slavery as an\r\nignorant class is not surprising when we consider that it was a penal\r\noffence to teach them while they were in slavery; but their eager desire\r\nto learn, and the alacrity and success with which they avail themselves of\r\nevery facility offered to them in that respect, has become a matter of\r\nnotoriety. The statistics of the Freedmen's Bureau show to what extent\r\nsuch facilities have been offered and what results have been attained. As\r\nfar as my information goes, these results are most encouraging for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nPROSPECTIVE--THE REACTIONARY TENDENCY.\r\n\r\nI stated above that, in my opinion, the solution of the social problem in\r\nthe south did not depend upon the capacity and conduct of the negro alone,\r\nbut in the same measure upon the ideas and feelings entertained and acted\r\nupon by the whites. What their ideas and feelings were while under my\r\nobservation, and how they affected the contact of the two races, I have\r\nalready set forth. The question arises, what policy will be adopted by the\r\n\"ruling class\" when all restraint imposed upon them by the military power\r\nof the national government is withdrawn, and they are left free to\r\nregulate matters according to their own tastes? It would be presumptuous\r\nto speak of the future with absolute certainty; but it may safely be\r\nassumed that the same causes will always tend to produce the same effects.\r\nAs long as a majority of the southern people believe that \"the negro will\r\nnot work without physical compulsion,\" and that \"the blacks at large\r\nbelong to the whites at large,\" that belief will tend to produce a system\r\nof coercion, the enforcement of which will be aided by the hostile feeling\r\nagainst the negro now prevailing among the whites, and by the general\r\nspirit of violence which in the south was fostered by the influence\r\nslavery exercised upon the popular character. It is, indeed, not probable\r\nthat a general attempt will be made to restore slavery in its old form, on\r\naccount of the barriers which such an attempt would find in its way; but\r\nthere are systems intermediate between slavery as it formerly existed in\r\nthe south, and free labor as it exists in the north, but more nearly\r\nrelated to the former than to the latter, _the introduction of which will\r\nbe attempted_. I have already noticed some movements in that direction,\r\nwhich were made under the very eyes of our military authorities, and of\r\nwhich the Opelousas and St. Landry ordinances were the most significant.\r\nOther things of more recent date, such as the new negro code submitted by\r\na committee to the legislature of South Carolina, are before the country.\r\nThey have all the same tendency, because they all spring from the same\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that evidence has been given of a contrary spirit by\r\nthe State conventions which passed ordinances abolishing slavery in their\r\nStates, and making it obligatory upon the legislatures to enact laws for\r\nthe protection of the freedmen. While acknowledging the fact, I deem it\r\ndangerous to be led by it into any delusions. As to the motives upon which\r\nthey acted when abolishing slavery, and their understanding of the\r\nbearings of such an act, we may safely accept the standard they have set\r\nup for themselves. When speaking of popular demonstrations in the south in\r\nfavor of submission to the government, I stated that the principal and\r\nalmost the only argument used was, that they found themselves in a\r\nsituation in which \"they could do no better.\" It was the same thing with\r\nregard to the abolition of slavery; wherever abolition was publicly\r\nadvocated, whether in popular meetings or in State conventions, it was on\r\nthe ground of necessity--not unfrequently with the significant addition\r\nthat, as soon as they had once more control of their own State affairs,\r\nthey could settle the labor question to suit themselves, whatever they\r\nmight have to submit to for the present. Not only did I find this to be\r\nthe common talk among the people, but the same sentiment was openly avowed\r\nby public men in speech and print. Some declarations of that kind, made by\r\nmen of great prominence, have passed into the newspapers and are\r\nundoubtedly known to you. I append to this report a specimen,\r\n(accompanying document, No. 40,) not as something particularly remarkable,\r\nbut in order to represent the current sentiment as expressed in the\r\nlanguage of a candidate for a seat in the State convention of Mississippi.\r\nIt is a card addressed to the voters of Wilkinson county, Mississippi, by\r\nGeneral W.L. Brandon. The general complains of having been called \"an\r\nunconditional, immediate emancipationist--an abolitionist.\" He indignantly\r\nrepels the charge and avows himself a good pro-slavery man. \"But,\r\nfellow-citizens,\" says he, \"what I may in common with you have to submit\r\nto, is a very different thing. Slavery has been taken from us; the power\r\nthat has already practically abolished it threatens totally and forever to\r\nabolish it. _But does it follow that I am in favor of this thing? By no\r\nmeans_. My honest conviction is, we must accept the situation as it is,\r\n_until we can get control once more of our own State affairs. We cannot do\r\notherwise and get our place again in the Union, and occupy a position,\r\nexert an influence that will protect us against greater evils which\r\nthreaten us_. I must, as any other man who votes or holds an office, submit\r\n_for the time_ to evils I cannot remedy.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Brandon was elected on that platform, and in the convention voted\r\nfor the ordinance abolishing slavery, and imposing upon the legislature\r\nthe duty to pass laws for the protection of the freedmen. And General\r\nBrandon is certainly looked upon in Mississippi as an honorable man, and\r\nan honest politician. What he will vote for when his people have got once\r\nmore control of their own State affairs, and his State has regained its\r\nposition and influence in the Union, it is needless to ask. I repeat, his\r\ncase is not an isolated one. He has only put in print what, as my\r\nobservations lead me to believe, a majority of the people say even in more\r\nemphatic language; and the deliberations of several legislatures in that\r\npart of the country show what it means. I deem it unnecessary to go into\r\nfurther particulars.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the convention of Mississippi--and the\r\nconventions of other States have followed its example--imposed upon\r\nsubsequent legislatures the obligation not only to pass laws for the\r\nprotection of the freedmen in person and property, but also _to guard\r\nagainst the dangers arising from sudden emancipation_. This language is\r\nnot without significance; not the blessings of a full development of free\r\nlabor, but only the dangers of emancipation are spoken of. It will be\r\nobserved that this clause is so vaguely worded as to authorize the\r\nlegislatures to place any restriction they may see fit upon the\r\nemancipated negro, in perfect consistency with the amended State\r\nconstitutions; for it rests with them to define what the dangers of sudden\r\nemancipation consist in, and what measures may be required to guard\r\nagainst them. It is true, the clause does not authorize the legislatures\r\nto re-establish slavery in the old form; but they may pass whatever laws\r\nthey see fit, stopping short only one step of what may strictly be defined\r\nas \"slavery.\" Peonage of the Mexican pattern, or serfdom of some European\r\npattern, may under that clause be considered admissible; and looking at\r\nthe legislative attempts already made, especially the labor code now under\r\nconsideration in the legislature of South Carolina, it appears not only\r\npossible, but eminently probable, that the laws which will be passed to\r\nguard against the dangers arising from emancipation will be directed\r\nagainst the spirit of emancipation itself.\r\n\r\nA more tangible evidence of good intentions would seem to have been\r\nfurnished by the admission of negro testimony in the courts of justice,\r\nwhich has been conceded in some of the southern States, at least in point\r\nof form. This being a matter of vital interest to the colored man, I\r\ninquired into the feelings of people concerning it with particular care.\r\nAt first I found hardly any southern man that favored it. Even persons of\r\nsome liberality of mind saw seemingly insurmountable objections. The\r\nappearance of a general order issued by General Swayne in Alabama, which\r\nmade it optional for the civil authorities either to admit negro testimony\r\nin the State courts or to have all cases in which colored people were\r\nconcerned tried by officers of the bureau or military commissions, seemed\r\nto be the signal for a change of position on the part of the politicians.\r\nA great many of them, seeing a chance for getting rid of the jurisdiction\r\nof the Freedmen's Bureau, dropped their opposition somewhat suddenly and\r\nendeavored to make the admission of negro testimony in the State courts\r\npalatable to the masses by assuring them that at all events it would rest\r\nwith the judges and juries to determine in each case before them whether\r\nthe testimony of negro witnesses was worth anything or not. One of the\r\nspeeches delivered at Vicksburg, already referred to in another connexion,\r\nand a card published by a candidate for office, (accompanying document No.\r\n14,) furnish specimens of that line of argument.\r\n\r\nIn my despatch from Montgomery, Alabama, I suggested to you that\r\ninstructions be issued making it part of the duty of agents of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau to appear in the State courts as the freedmen's next\r\nfriend, and to forward reports of the proceedings had in the principal\r\ncases to the headquarters of the bureau. In this manner it would have been\r\npossible to ascertain to what extent the admission of negro testimony\r\nsecured to the colored man justice in the State courts. As the plan does\r\nnot seem to have been adopted, we must form our conclusions from evidence\r\nless complete. Among the annexed documents there are several statements\r\nconcerning its results, made by gentlemen whose business it was to\r\nobserve. I would invite your attention to the letters of Captain Paillon,\r\nagent of the Freedmen's Bureau at Mobile; Major Reynolds, assistant\r\ncommissioner of the bureau at Natchez; and Colonel Thomas, assistant\r\ncommissioner for the State of Mississippi. (Accompanying documents Nos. 41\r\nand 27.) The opinions expressed in these papers are uniformly unfavorable.\r\nIt is to be hoped that at other places better results have been attained.\r\nBut I may state that even by prominent southern men, who were anxious to\r\nhave the jurisdiction of the State courts extended over the freedmen, the\r\nadmission was made to me that the testimony of a negro would have but\r\nlittle weight with a southern jury. I frequently asked the question, \"Do\r\nyou think a jury of your people would be apt to find a planter who has\r\nwhipped one of his negro laborers guilty of assault and battery?\" The\r\nanswer almost invariably was, \"You must make some allowance for the\r\nprejudices of our people.\"\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the laws excluding negro testimony from the courts\r\nwill be repealed in all the States lately in rebellion if it is believed\r\nthat a satisfactory arrangement of this matter may in any way facilitate\r\nthe \"readmission\" of the States, but I apprehend such arrangements will\r\nhardly be sufficient to secure to the colored man impartial justice as\r\nlong as the feelings of the whites are against him and they think that his\r\nrights are less entitled to respect than their own. More potent certainly\r\nthan the laws of a country are the opinions of right and wrong entertained\r\nby its people. When the spirit of a law is in conflict with such opinions,\r\nthere is but little prospect of its being faithfully put in execution,\r\nespecially where those who hold such opinions are the same who have to\r\nadminister the laws.\r\n\r\nThe facility with which southern politicians acquiesce in the admission of\r\nnegro testimony is not surprising when we consider that the practical\r\nmanagement of the matter will rest with their own people. I found them\r\nless accommodating with regard to \"constitutional amendment.\" Nine-tenths\r\nof the intelligent men with whom I had any conversation upon that subject\r\nexpressed their willingness to ratify the first section, abolishing\r\nslavery throughout the United States, but not the second section,\r\nempowering Congress \"to enforce the foregoing by appropriate legislation.\"\r\nI feel warranted in saying that, while I was in the south, this was\r\nthe prevailing sentiment. Nevertheless, I deem it probable that the\r\n\"constitutional amendment\" will be ratified by every State legislature,\r\nprovided the government insists upon such ratification as a _conditio sine\r\nqua non_ of readmission. It is instructive to observe how powerful and\r\nimmediate an effect the announcement of such a condition by the government\r\nproduces in southern conventions and legislatures. It would be idle to\r\nassume, however, that a telegraphic despatch, while it may beat down all\r\nparliamentary opposition to this or that measure, will at the same time\r\nobliterate the prejudices of the people; nor will it prevent those\r\nprejudices from making themselves seriously felt in the future. It will\r\nrequire measures of a more practical character to prevent the dangers\r\nwhich, as everybody that reads the signs of the times must see, are now\r\nimpending.\r\n\r\nTHE MILITIA.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to say that the southern people intend to retrace the steps\r\nthey have made as soon as they have resumed control of their State\r\naffairs. Although they regret the abolition of slavery, they certainly do\r\nnot intend to re-establish it in its old form. Although they are at heart\r\nopposed to the admission of negro testimony in the courts of justice, they\r\nprobably will not re-enact the laws excluding it. But while accepting the\r\n\"abolition of slavery,\" they think that some species of serfdom, peonage,\r\nor some other form of compulsory labor is not slavery, and may be\r\nintroduced without a violation of their pledge. Although formally\r\nadmitting negro testimony, they think that negro testimony will be taken\r\npractically for what they themselves consider it \"worth.\" What particular\r\nshape the reactionary movement will assume it is at present unnecessary to\r\ninquire. There are a hundred ways of framing apprenticeship, vagrancy, or\r\ncontract laws, which will serve the purpose. Even the mere reorganization\r\nof the militia upon the old footing will go far towards accomplishing the\r\nobject. To this point I beg leave to invite your special attention.\r\n\r\nThe people of the southern States show great anxiety to have their militia\r\nreorganized, and in some instances permission has been given. In the case\r\nof Mississippi I gave you my reasons for opposing the measure under\r\nexisting circumstances. They were, first, that county patrols had already\r\nbeen in existence, and had to be disbanded on account of their open\r\nhostility to Union people and freedmen. (See Colonel Yorke's report,\r\naccompanying document No. 25.) Second, that the governor proposed to arm\r\nthe people upon the ground that the inhabitants refused to assist the\r\nmilitary authorities in the suppression of crime, and that the call was\r\naddressed, not to the loyal citizens of the United States, but expressly\r\nto the \"young men who had so distinguished themselves for gallantry\" in\r\nthe rebel service. (See correspondence between Governor Sharkey and\r\nGeneral Osterhaus, accompanying document No. 42.) And third, because the\r\nState was still under martial law, and the existence of organized and\r\narmed bodies not under the control of the military commander was\r\ninconsistent with that state of things.\r\n\r\nBut there are other more general points of view from which this question\r\nmust be looked at in order to be appreciated in its most important\r\nbearings. I may state, without fear of contradiction, that, in every case,\r\nwhere permission was asked for reorganizing the militia, the privilege or\r\nduty of serving in that armed organization was intended to be confined to\r\nthe whites. In the conversations I had with southern men about this\r\nmatter, the idea of admitting colored people to the privilege of bearing\r\narms as a part of the militia was uniformly treated by them as a thing not\r\nto be thought of. The militia, whenever organized, will thus be composed\r\nof men belonging to one class, to the total exclusion of another. This\r\nconcentration of organized physical power in the hands of one class will\r\nnecessarily tend, and is undoubtedly designed, to give that class absolute\r\nphysical control of the other. The specific purpose for which the militia\r\nis to be reorganized appears clearly from the uses it was put to whenever\r\na local organization was effected. It is the restoration of the old patrol\r\nsystem which was one of the characteristic features of the regime of\r\nslavery. The services which such patrols are expected to perform consist\r\nin maintaining what southern people understand to be the order of society.\r\nIndications are given in several of the accompanying documents. Among\r\nothers, the St. Landry and Bossier ordinances define with some precision\r\nwhat the authority and duties of the \"chief patrols\" are to be. The\r\nmilitia, organized for the distinct purpose of enforcing the authority of\r\nthe whites over the blacks, is in itself practically sufficient to\r\nestablish and enforce a system of compulsory labor without there being any\r\nexplicit laws for it; and, being sustained and encouraged by public\r\nopinion, the chief and members of \"county patrols\" are not likely to be\r\nover-nice in the construction of their orders. This is not a mere\r\nsupposition, but an opinion based upon experience already gathered. As I\r\nstated above, the reorganization of the county patrol system upon the\r\nbasis here described will result in the establishment of a sort of\r\npermanent martial law over the negro.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, not even necessary that the reaction against that result\r\nof the war, which consists in emancipation, should manifest itself by very\r\nobnoxious legislative enactments, just as in some of the slave States\r\nslavery did not exist by virtue of the State constitution. It may be\r\npractically accomplished, and is, in fact, practically accomplished\r\nwhenever the freed man is not protected by the federal authorities,\r\nwithout displaying its character and aims upon the statute book.\r\n\r\nNEGRO INSURRECTIONS AND ANARCHY.\r\n\r\nThat in times like ours, and in a country like this, a reaction in favor\r\nof compulsory labor cannot be ultimately successful, is as certain as it\r\nwas that slavery could not last forever. But a movement in that direction\r\ncan prevent much good that might be accomplished, and produce much evil\r\nthat might be avoided. Not only will such a movement seriously interfere\r\nwith all efforts to organize an efficient system of free labor, and thus\r\nvery materially retard the return of prosperity in the south, but it may\r\nbring on a crisis as dangerous and destructive as the war of the rebellion\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nI stated above that I did not deem a negro insurrection probable as long\r\nas the freedmen were assured of the direct protection of the national\r\ngovernment. Whenever they are in trouble, they raise their eyes up to that\r\npower, and although they may suffer, yet, as long as that power is visibly\r\npresent, they continue to hope. But when State authority in the south is\r\nfully restored, the federal forces withdrawn, and the Freedmen's Bureau\r\nabolished, the colored man will find himself turned over to the mercies of\r\nthose whom he does not trust. If then an attempt, is made to strip him\r\nagain of those rights which he justly thought he possessed, he will be apt\r\nto feel that he can hope for no redress unless he procure it himself. If\r\never the negro is capable of rising, he will rise then. Men who never\r\nstruck a blow for the purpose of gaining their liberty, when they were\r\nslaves, are apt to strike when, their liberty once gained, they see it\r\nagain in danger. However great the patience and submissiveness of the\r\ncolored race may be, it cannot be presumed that its active participation\r\nin a war against the very men with whom it again stands face to face, has\r\nremained entirely without influence upon its spirit.\r\n\r\nWhat a general insurrection of the negroes would result in, whether it\r\nwould be easy or difficult to suppress it, whether the struggle would be\r\nlong or short, what race would suffer most, are questions which will not\r\nbe asked by those who understand the problem to be, not how to suppress a\r\nnegro insurrection, but how to prevent it. Certain it is, it would inflict\r\nterrible calamities upon both whites and blacks, and present to the world\r\nthe spectacle of atrocities which ought to be foreign to civilized\r\nnations. The negro, in his ordinary state, is docile and good-natured; but\r\nwhen once engaged in a bloody business, it is difficult to say how far his\r\nhot impulses would carry him; and as to the southern whites, the barbarous\r\nscenes the country has witnessed since the close of the rebellion,\r\nindicate the temper with which they would fight the negro as an insurgent.\r\nIt would be a war of extermination, revolting in its incidents, and with\r\nruin and desolation in its train. There may be different means by which it\r\ncan be prevented, but there is only one certain of effect: it is, that the\r\nprovocations be avoided which may call it forth.\r\n\r\nBut even if it be prevented by other means, it is not the only danger\r\nwhich a reactionary movement will bring upon the south. Nothing renders\r\nsociety more restless than a social revolution but half accomplished. It\r\nnaturally tends to develop its logical consequences, but is hindered by\r\nadverse agencies which work in another direction; nor can it return to the\r\npoint from which it started. There are, then, continual vibrations and\r\nfluctuations between two opposites which keep society in the nervous\r\nuneasiness and excitement growing from the lingering strife between the\r\nantagonistic tendencies. All classes of society are intensely dissatisfied\r\nwith things as they are. General explosions may be prevented, but they are\r\nalways imminent. This state of uncertainty impedes all successful working\r\nof the social forces; people, instead of devoting themselves with\r\nconfidence and steadiness to solid pursuits, are apt to live from hand to\r\nmouth, or to indulge in fitful experiments; capital ventures out but with\r\ngreat timity; the lawless elements of the community take advantage of the\r\ngeneral confusion and dissatisfaction, and society drifts into anarchy.\r\nThere is probably at the present moment no country in the civilized world\r\nwhich contains such an accumulation of anarchical elements as the south.\r\nThe strife of the antagonistic tendencies here described is aggravated by\r\nthe passions inflamed and the general impoverishment brought about by a\r\nlong and exhaustive war, and the south will have to suffer the evils of\r\nanarchical disorder until means are found to effect a final settlement of\r\nthe labor question in accordance with the logic of the great revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE PROBLEM.--DIFFICULTIES AND REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nIn seeking remedies for such disorders, we ought to keep in view, above\r\nall, the nature of the problem which is to be solved. As to what is\r\ncommonly termed \"reconstruction,\" it is not only the political machinery\r\nof the States and their constitutional relations to the general\r\ngovernment, but the whole organism of southern society that must be\r\nreconstructed, or rather constructed anew, so as to bring it in harmony\r\nwith the rest of American society. The difficulties of this task are not\r\nto be considered overcome when the people of the south take the oath of\r\nallegiance and elect governors and legislatures and members of Congress,\r\nand militia captains. That this would be done had become Certain as soon\r\nas the surrenders of the southern armies had made further resistance\r\nimpossible, and nothing in the world was left, even to the most\r\nuncompromising rebel, but to submit or to emigrate. It was also natural\r\nthat they should avail themselves of every chance offered them to resume\r\ncontrol of their home affairs and to regain their influence in the Union.\r\nBut this can hardly be called the first step towards the solution of the\r\ntrue problem, and it is a fair question to ask, whether the hasty\r\ngratification of their desire to resume such control would not create new\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\nThe true nature of the difficulties of the situation is this: The general\r\ngovernment of the republic has, by proclaiming the emancipation of the\r\nslaves, commenced a great social revolution in the south, but has, as yet,\r\nnot completed it. Only the negative part of it is accomplished. The slaves\r\nare emancipated in point of form, but free labor has not yet been put in\r\nthe place of slavery in point of fact. And now, in the midst of this\r\ncritical period of transition, the power which originated the revolution\r\nis expected to turn over its whole future development to another power\r\nwhich from the beginning was hostile to it and has never yet entered into\r\nits spirit, leaving the class in whose favor it was made completely\r\nwithout power to protect itself and to take an influential part in that\r\ndevelopment. The history of the world will be searched in vain for a\r\nproceeding similar to this which did not lead either to a rapid and\r\nviolent reaction, or to the most serious trouble and civil disorder. It\r\ncannot be said that the conduct of the southern people since the close of\r\nthe war has exhibited such extraordinary wisdom and self-abnegation as to\r\nmake them an exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nIn my despatches from the south I repeatedly expressed the opinion that\r\nthe people were not yet in a frame of mind to legislate calmly and\r\nunderstandingly upon the subject of free negro labor. And this I reported\r\nto be the opinion of some of our most prominent military commanders and\r\nother observing men. It is, indeed, difficult to imagine circumstances\r\nmore unfavorable for the development of a calm and unprejudiced public\r\nopinion than those under which the southern people are at present\r\nlaboring. The war has not only defeated their political aspirations, but\r\nit has broken up their whole social organization. When the rebellion was\r\nput down they found themselves not only conquered in a political and\r\nmilitary sense, but economically ruined. The planters, who represented the\r\nwealth of the southern country, are partly laboring under the severest\r\nembarrassments, partly reduced to absolute poverty. Many who are stripped\r\nof all available means, and have nothing but their land, cross their arms\r\nin gloomy despondency, incapable of rising to a manly resolution. Others,\r\nwho still possess means, are at a loss how to use them, as their old way\r\nof doing things is, by the abolition of slavery, rendered impracticable,\r\nat least where the military arm of the government has enforced\r\nemancipation. Others are still trying to go on in the old way, and that\r\nold way is in fact the only one they understand, and in which they have\r\nany confidence. Only a minority is trying to adopt the new order of\r\nthings. A large number of the plantations, probably a considerable\r\nmajority of the more valuable estates, is under heavy mortgages, and the\r\nowners know that, unless they retrieve their fortunes in a comparatively\r\nshort space of time, their property will pass out of their hands. Almost\r\nall are, to some extent, embarrassed. The nervous anxiety which such a\r\nstate of things produces extends also to those classes of society which,\r\nalthough not composed of planters, were always in close business connexion\r\nwith the planting interest, and there was hardly a branch of commerce or\r\nindustry in the south which was not directly or indirectly so connected.\r\nBesides, the southern soldiers, when returning from the war, did not, like\r\nthe northern soldiers, find a prosperous community which merely waited for\r\ntheir arrival to give them remunerative employment. They found, many of\r\nthem, their homesteads destroyed, their farms devastated, their families\r\nin distress; and those that were less unfortunate found, at all events, an\r\nimpoverished and exhausted community which had but little to offer them.\r\nThus a great many have been thrown upon the world to shift as best they\r\ncan. They must do something honest or dishonest, and must do it soon, to\r\nmake a living, and their prospects are, at present, not very bright. Thus\r\nthat nervous anxiety to hastily repair broken fortunes, and to prevent\r\nstill greater ruin and distress, embraces nearly all classes, and imprints\r\nupon all the movements of the social body a morbid character.\r\n\r\nIn which direction will these people be most apt to turn their eyes?\r\nLeaving the prejudice of race out of the question, from early youth they\r\nhave been acquainted with but one system of labor, and with that one\r\nsystem they have been in the habit of identifying all their interests.\r\nThey know of no way to help themselves but the one they are accustomed to.\r\nAnother system of labor is presented to them, which, however, owing to\r\ncircumstances which they do not appreciate, appears at first in an\r\nunpromising light. To try it they consider an experiment which they cannot\r\nafford to make while their wants are urgent. They have not reasoned calmly\r\nenough to convince themselves that the trial must be made. It is, indeed,\r\nnot wonderful that, under such circumstances, they should study, not how\r\nto introduce and develop free labor, but how to avoid its introduction,\r\nand how to return as much and as quickly as possible to something like the\r\nold order of things. Nor is it wonderful that such studies should find an\r\nexpression in their attempts at legislation. But the circumstance that\r\nthis tendency is natural does not render it less dangerous and\r\nobjectionable. The practical question presents itself: Is the immediate\r\nrestoration of the late rebel States to absolute self-control so necessary\r\nthat it must be done even at the risk of endangering one of the great\r\nresults of the war, and of bringing on in those States insurrection or\r\nanarchy, or would it not be better to postpone that restoration until such\r\ndangers are passed? If, as long as the change from slavery to free labor\r\nis known to the southern people only by its destructive results, these\r\npeople must be expected to throw obstacles in its way, would it not seem\r\nnecessary that the movement of social \"reconstruction\" be kept in the\r\nright channel by the hand of the power which originated the change, until\r\nthat change can have disclosed some of its beneficial effects?\r\n\r\nIt is certain that every success of free negro labor will augment the\r\nnumber of its friends, and disarm some of the prejudices and assumptions\r\nof its opponents. I am convinced one good harvest made by unadulterated\r\nfree labor in the south would have a far better effect than all the oaths\r\nthat have been taken, and all the ordinances that have as yet been passed\r\nby southern conventions. But how can such a result be attained? The facts\r\nenumerated in this report, as well as the news we receive from the south\r\nfrom day to day, must make it evident to every unbiased observer that\r\nunadulterated free labor cannot be had at present, unless the national\r\ngovernment holds its protective and controlling hand over it. It appears,\r\nalso, that the more efficient this protection of free labor against all\r\ndisturbing and reactionary influences, the sooner may such a satisfactory\r\nresult be looked for. One reason why the southern people are so slow in\r\naccommodating themselves to the new order of things is, that they\r\nconfidently expect soon to be permitted to regulate matters according to\r\ntheir own notions. Every concession made to them by the government has\r\nbeen taken as an encouragement to persevere in this hope, and,\r\nunfortunately for them, this hope is nourished by influences from other\r\nparts of the country. Hence their anxiety to have their State governments\r\nrestored _at once_, to have the troops withdrawn, and the Freedmen's\r\nBureau abolished, although a good many discerning men know well that, in\r\nview of the lawless spirit still prevailing, it would be far better for\r\nthem to have the general order of society firmly maintained by the federal\r\npower until things have arrived at a final settlement. Had, from the\r\nbeginning, the conviction been forced upon them that the adulteration of\r\nthe new order of things by the admixture of elements belonging to the\r\nsystem of slavery would under no circumstances be permitted, a much larger\r\nnumber would have launched their energies into the new channel, and,\r\nseeing that they could do \"no better,\" faithfully co-operated with the\r\ngovernment. It is hope which fixes them in their perverse notions. That\r\nhope nourished or fully gratified, they will persevere in the same\r\ndirection. That hope destroyed, a great many will, by the force of\r\nnecessity, at once accommodate themselves to the logic of the change. If,\r\ntherefore, the national government firmly and unequivocally announces its\r\npolicy not to give up the control of the free-labor reform until it is\r\nfinally accomplished, the progress of that reform will undoubtedly be far\r\nmore rapid and far less difficult than it will be if the attitude of the\r\ngovernment is such as to permit contrary hopes to be indulged in.\r\n\r\nThe machinery by which the government has so far exercised its protection\r\nof the negro and of free labor in the south--the Freedmen's Bureau--is\r\nvery unpopular in that part of the country, as every institution placed\r\nthere as a barrier to reactionary aspirations would be. That abuses were\r\ncommitted with the management of freedmen's affairs; that some of the\r\nofficers of the bureau were men of more enthusiasm than discretion, and in\r\nmany cases went beyond their authority: all this is certainly true. But,\r\nwhile the southern people are always ready to expatiate upon the\r\nshortcomings of the Freedmen's Bureau, they are not so ready to recognize\r\nthe services it has rendered. I feel warranted in saying that not half of\r\nthe labor that has been done in the south this year, or will be done there\r\nnext year, would have been or would be done but for the exertions of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau. The confusion and disorder of the transition period\r\nwould have been infinitely greater had not an agency interfered which\r\npossessed the confidence of the emancipated slaves; which could disabuse\r\nthem of any extravagant notions and expectations and be trusted; which\r\ncould administer to them good advice and be voluntarily obeyed. No other\r\nagency, except one placed there by the national government, could have\r\nwielded that moral power whose interposition was so necessary to prevent\r\nsouthern society from falling at once into the chaos of a general\r\ncollision between its different elements. That the success achieved by the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau is as yet very incomplete cannot be disputed. A more\r\nperfect organization and a more carefully selected personnel may be\r\ndesirable; but it is doubtful whether a more suitable machinery can be\r\ndevised to secure to free labor in the south that protection against\r\ndisturbing influences which the nature of the situation still imperatively\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION.\r\n\r\nA temporary continuation of national control in the southern States would\r\nalso have a most beneficial effect as regards the immigration of northern\r\npeople and Europeans into that country; and such immigration would, in its\r\nturn, contribute much to the solution of the labor problem. Nothing is\r\nmore desirable for the south than the importation of new men and new\r\nideas. One of the greatest drawbacks under which the southern people are\r\nlaboring is, that for fifty years they have been in no sympathetic\r\ncommunion with the progressive ideas of the times. While professing to be\r\nin favor of free trade, they adopted and enforced a system of prohibition,\r\nas far as those ideas were concerned, which was in conflict with their\r\ncherished institution of slavery; and, as almost all the progressive ideas\r\nof our days were in conflict with slavery, the prohibition was sweeping.\r\nIt had one peculiar effect, which we also notice with some Asiatic nations\r\nwhich follow a similar course. The southern people honestly maintained and\r\nbelieved, not only that as a people they were highly civilized, but that\r\ntheir civilization was the highest that could be attained, and ought to\r\nserve as a model to other nations the world over. The more enlightened\r\nindividuals among them felt sometimes a vague impression of the barrenness\r\nof their mental life, and the barbarous peculiarities of their social\r\norganization; but very few ever dared to investigate and to expose the\r\ntrue cause of these evils. Thus the people were so wrapt up in\r\nself-admiration as to be inaccessible to the voice even of the\r\nbest-intentioned criticism. Hence the delusion they indulged in as to the\r\nabsolute superiority of their race--a delusion which, in spite of the\r\nsevere test it has lately undergone, is not yet given up; and will, as\r\nevery traveller in the south can testify from experience, sometimes\r\nexpress itself in singular manifestations. This spirit, which for so long\r\na time has kept the southern people back while the world besides was\r\nmoving, is even at this moment still standing as a serious obstacle in the\r\nway of progress.\r\n\r\nNothing can, therefore, be more desirable than that the contact between\r\nthe southern people and the outside world should be as strong and intimate\r\nas possible; and in no better way can this end be subserved than by\r\nimmigration in mass. Of the economical benefits which such immigration\r\nwould confer upon the owners of the soil it is hardly necessary to speak.\r\n\r\nImmigration wants encouragement. As far as this encouragement consists in\r\nthe promise of material advantage, it is already given. There are large\r\ndistricts in the south in which an industrious and enterprising man, with\r\nsome capital, and acting upon correct principles, cannot fail to\r\naccumulate large gains in a comparatively short time, as long as the\r\nprices of the staples do not fall below what they may reasonably be\r\nexpected to be for some time to come. A northern man has, besides, the\r\nadvantage of being served by the laboring population of that region with\r\ngreater willingness.\r\n\r\nBut among the principal requisites for the success of the immigrant are\r\npersonal security and a settled condition of things. Personal security is\r\nhonestly promised by the thinking men of the south; but another question\r\nis, whether the promise and good intentions of the thinking men will be\r\nsufficient to restrain and control the populace, whose animosity against\r\n\"Yankee interlopers\" is only second to their hostile feeling against the\r\nnegro. If the military forces of the government should be soon and\r\ncompletely withdrawn, I see reasons to fear that in many localities\r\nimmigrants would enjoy the necessary security only when settling down\r\ntogether in numbers strong enough to provide for their own protection. On\r\nthe whole, no better encouragement can be given to immigration, as far as\r\nindividual security is concerned, than the assurance that the national\r\ngovernment will be near to protect them until such protection is no longer\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nThe south needs capital. But capital is notoriously timid and averse to\r\nrisk itself, not only where there actually is trouble, but where there is\r\nserious and continual danger of trouble. Capitalists will be apt to\r\nconsider--and they are by no means wrong in doing so--that no safe\r\ninvestments can be made in the south as long as southern society is liable\r\nto be convulsed by anarchical disorders. No greater encouragement can,\r\ntherefore, be given to capital to transfer itself to the south than the\r\nassurance that the government will continue to control the development of\r\nthe new social system in the late rebel States until such dangers are\r\naverted by a final settlement of things upon a thorough free-labor basis.\r\n\r\nHow long the national government should continue that control depends upon\r\ncontingencies. It ought to cease as soon as its objects are attained; and\r\nits objects will be attained sooner and with less difficulty if nobody is\r\npermitted to indulge in the delusion that it will cease _before_ they are\r\nattained. This is one of the cases in which a determined policy can\r\naccomplish much, while a half-way policy is liable to spoil things already\r\naccomplished. The continuance of the national control in the south,\r\nalthough it may be for a short period only, will cause some inconvenience\r\nand expense; but if thereby destructive collisions and anarchical\r\ndisorders can be prevented, justice secured to all men, and the return of\r\npeace and prosperity to all parts of this country hastened, it will be a\r\npaying investment. For the future of the republic, it is far less\r\nimportant that this business of reconstruction be done quickly than that\r\nit be well done. The matter well taken in hand, there is reason for hope\r\nthat it will be well done, and quickly too. In days like these great\r\nchanges are apt to operate themselves rapidly. At present the southern\r\npeople assume that free negro labor will not work, and therefore they are\r\nnot inclined to give it a fair trial. As soon as they find out that they\r\nmust give it a fair trial, and that their whole future power and\r\nprosperity depend upon its success, they will also find out that it will\r\nwork, at least far better than they have anticipated. Then their hostility\r\nto it will gradually disappear. This great result accomplished, posterity\r\nwill not find fault with this administration for having delayed complete\r\n\"reconstruction\" one, two, or more years.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am not called upon to discuss in this report the constitutional\r\naspects of this question, I may be pardoned for one remark. The\r\ninterference of the national government in the local concerns of the\r\nStates lately in rebellion is argued against by many as inconsistent with\r\nthe spirit of our federal institutions. Nothing is more foreign to my ways\r\nof thinking in political matters than a fondness for centralization or\r\nmilitary government. Nobody can value the blessings of local\r\nself-government more highly than I do. But we are living under exceptional\r\ncircumstances which require us, above all, to look at things from a\r\npractical point of view; and I believe it will prove far more dangerous\r\nfor the integrity of local self-government if the national control in the\r\nsouth be discontinued--while by discontinuing it too soon, it may be\r\nrendered necessary again in the future--than if it be continued, when by\r\ncontinuing it but a limited time all such future necessity may be\r\nobviated. At present these acts of interference are but a part of that\r\nexceptional policy brought forth by the necessities into which the\r\nrebellion has plunged us. Although there will be some modifications in the\r\nrelations between the States and the national government, yet these acts\r\nof direct interference in the details of State concerns will pass away\r\nwith the exceptional circumstances which called them forth. But if the\r\nsocial revolution in the south be now abandoned in an unfinished state,\r\nand at some future period produce events provoking new and repeated acts\r\nof direct practical interference--and the contingency would by no means be\r\nunlikely to arise--such new and repeated acts would not pass over without\r\nmost seriously affecting the political organism of the republic.\r\n\r\nNEGRO SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the interference of the national authority in the home\r\nconcerns of the southern States would be rendered less necessary, and the\r\nwhole problem of political and social reconstruction be much simplified,\r\nif, while the masses lately arrayed against the government are permitted\r\nto vote, the large majority of those who were always loyal, and are\r\nnaturally anxious to see the free labor problem successfully solved, were\r\nnot excluded from all influence upon legislation. In all questions\r\nconcerning the Union, the national debt, and the future social\r\norganization of the south, the feelings of the colored man are naturally\r\nin sympathy with the views and aims of the national government. While the\r\nsouthern white fought against the Union, the negro did all he could to aid\r\nit; while the southern white sees in the national government his\r\nconqueror, the negro sees in it his protector; while the white owes to the\r\nnational debt his defeat, the negro owes to it his deliverance; while the\r\nwhite considers himself robbed and ruined by the emancipation of the\r\nslaves, the negro finds in it the assurance of future prosperity and\r\nhappiness. In all the important issues the negro would be led by natural\r\nimpulse to forward the ends of the government, and by making his\r\ninfluence, as part of the voting body, tell upon the legislation of the\r\nStates, render the interference of the national authority less necessary.\r\n\r\nAs the most difficult of the pending questions are intimately connected\r\nwith the status of the negro in southern society, it is obvious that a\r\ncorrect solution can be more easily obtained if he has a voice in the\r\nmatter. In the right to vote he would find the best permanent protection\r\nagainst oppressive class-legislation, as well as against individual\r\npersecution. The relations between the white and black races, even if\r\nimproved by the gradual wearing off of the present animosities, are likely\r\nto remain long under the troubling influence of prejudice. It is a\r\nnotorious fact that the rights of a man of some political power are far\r\nless exposed to violation than those of one who is, in matters of public\r\ninterest, completely subject to the will of others. A voter is a man of\r\ninfluence; small as that influence may be in the single individual, it\r\nbecomes larger when that individual belongs to a numerous class of voters\r\nwho are ready to make common cause with him for the protection of his\r\nrights. Such an individual is an object of interest to the political\r\nparties that desire to have the benefit of his ballot. It is true, the\r\nbringing face to face at the ballot-box of the white and black races may\r\nhere and there lead to an outbreak of feeling, and the first trials ought\r\ncertainly to be made while the national power is still there to prevent or\r\nrepress disturbances; but the practice once successfully inaugurated under\r\nthe protection of that power, it would probably be more apt than anything\r\nelse to obliterate old antagonisms, especially if the colored\r\npeople--which is probable, as soon as their own rights are sufficiently\r\nsecured--divide their votes between the different political parties.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the extension of the franchise to the colored people upon\r\nthe development of free labor and upon the security of human rights in the\r\nsouth being the principal object in view, the objections raised on the\r\nground of the ignorance of the freedmen become unimportant. Practical\r\nliberty is a good school, and, besides, if any qualification can be found,\r\napplicable to both races, which does not interfere with the attainment of\r\nthe main object, such qualification would in that respect be\r\nunobjectionable. But it is idle to say that it will be time to speak of\r\nnegro suffrage when the whole colored race will be educated, for the\r\nballot may be necessary to him to secure his education. It is also idle to\r\nsay that ignorance is the principal ground upon which southern men object\r\nto negro suffrage, for if it were, that numerous class of colored people\r\nin Louisiana who are as highly educated, as intelligent, and as wealthy as\r\nany corresponding class of whites, would have been enfranchised long ago.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that the negro would be but a voting machine in the\r\nhand of his employer. On this point opinions seem to differ. I have heard\r\nit said in the south that the freedmen are more likely to be influenced by\r\ntheir schoolmasters and preachers. But even if we suppose the employer to\r\ncontrol to a certain extent the negro laborer's vote, two things are to be\r\ntaken into consideration: 1. The class of employers, of landed\r\nproprietors, will in a few years be very different from what it was\r\nheretofore in consequence of the general breaking up, a great many of the\r\nold slaveholders will be obliged to give up their lands and new men will\r\nstep into their places; and 2. The employer will hardly control the vote\r\nof the negro laborer so far as to make him vote against his own liberty.\r\nThe beneficial effect of an extension of suffrage does not always depend\r\nupon the intelligence with which the newly admitted voters exercise their\r\nright, but sometimes upon the circumstances in which they are placed; and\r\nthe circumstances in which the freedmen of the south are placed are such\r\nthat, when they only vote for their own liberty and rights, they vote for\r\nthe rights of free labor, for the success of an immediate important\r\nreform, for the prosperity of the country, and for the general interests\r\nof mankind. If, therefore, in order to control the colored vote, the\r\nemployer, or whoever he may be, is first obliged to concede to the\r\nfreedman the great point of his own rights as a man and a free laborer,\r\nthe great social reform is completed, the most difficult problem is\r\nsolved, and all other questions it will be comparatively easy to settle.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the matter of negro suffrage I deemed it my duty to confine\r\nmyself strictly to the practical aspects of the subject. I have,\r\ntherefore, not touched its moral merits nor discussed the question whether\r\nthe national government is competent to enlarge the elective franchise in\r\nthe States lately in rebellion by its own act; I deem it proper, however,\r\nto offer a few remarks on the assertion frequently put forth, that the\r\nfranchise is likely to be extended to the colored man by the voluntary\r\naction of the southern whites themselves. My observation leads me to a\r\ncontrary opinion. Aside from a very few enlightened men, I found but one\r\nclass of people in favor of the enfranchisement of the blacks: it was the\r\nclass of Unionists who found themselves politically ostracised and looked\r\nupon the enfranchisement of the loyal negroes as the salvation of the\r\nwhole loyal element. But their numbers and influence are sadly\r\ninsufficient to secure such a result. The masses are strongly opposed to\r\ncolored suffrage; anybody that dares to advocate it is stigmatized as a\r\ndangerous fanatic; nor do I deem it probable that in the ordinary course\r\nof things prejudices will wear off to such an extent as to make it a\r\npopular measure. Outside of Louisiana only one gentleman who occupied a\r\nprominent political position in the south expressed to me an opinion\r\nfavorable to it. He declared himself ready to vote for an amendment to the\r\nconstitution of his State bestowing the right of suffrage upon all male\r\ncitizens without distinction of color who could furnish evidence of their\r\nability to read and write, without, however, disfranchising those who are\r\nnow voters and are not able to fulfil that condition. This gentleman is\r\nnow a member of one of the State conventions, but I presume he will not\r\nrisk his political standing in the south by moving such an amendment in\r\nthat body.\r\n\r\nThe only manner in which, in my opinion, the southern people can be\r\ninduced to grant to the freedman some measure of self-protecting power in\r\nthe form of suffrage, is to make it a condition precedent to\r\n\"readmission.\"\r\n\r\nDEPORTATION OF THE FREEDMEN.\r\n\r\nI have to notice one pretended remedy for the disorders now agitating the\r\nsouth, which seems to have become the favorite plan of some prominent\r\npublic men. It is that the whole colored population of the south should be\r\ntransported to some place where they could live completely separated from\r\nthe whites. It is hardly necessary to discuss, not only the question of\r\nright and justice, but the difficulties and expense necessarily attending\r\nthe deportation of nearly four millions of people. But it may be asked,\r\nwhat would become of the industry of the south for many years, if the bulk\r\nof its laboring population were taken away? The south stands in need of an\r\nincrease and not of a diminution of its laboring force to repair the\r\nlosses and disasters of the last four years. Much is said of importing\r\nEuropean laborers and northern men; this is the favorite idea of many\r\nplanters who want such immigrants to work on their plantations. But they\r\nforget that European and northern men will not come to the south to serve\r\nas hired hands on the plantations, but to acquire property for themselves,\r\nand that even if the whole European immigration at the rate of 200,000 a\r\nyear were turned into the south, leaving not a single man for the north\r\nand west, it would require between fifteen and twenty years to fill the\r\nvacuum caused by the deportation of the freedmen. Aside from this, the\r\ninflux of northern men or Europeans will not diminish the demand for hired\r\nnegro labor; it will, on the contrary, increase it. As Europeans and\r\nnorthern people come in, not only vast quantities of land will pass from\r\nthe hands of their former owners into those of the immigrants, but a large\r\narea of new land will be brought under cultivation; and as the area of\r\ncultivation expands, hired labor, such as furnished by the colored people,\r\nwill be demanded in large quantities. The deportation of the labor so\r\ndemanded would, therefore, be a very serious injury to the economical\r\ninterests of the south, and if an attempt were made, this effect would\r\nsoon be felt.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a question worthy of consideration whether it would not be\r\nwise to offer attractive inducements and facilities for the voluntary\r\nmigration of freedmen to some suitable district on the line of the Pacific\r\nrailroad. It would answer a double object: 1. It would aid in the\r\nconstruction of that road, and 2. If this migration be effected on a large\r\nscale it would cause a drain upon the laboring force of the south; it\r\nwould make the people affected by that drain feel the value of the\r\nfreedmen's labor, and show them the necessity of keeping that labor at\r\nhome by treating the laborer well, and by offering him inducements as fair\r\nas can be offered elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the efficiency of such expedients may be, the true problem\r\nremains, not how to remove the colored man from his present field of\r\nlabor, but how to make him, where he is, a true freeman and an intelligent\r\nand useful citizen. The means are simple: protection by the government\r\nuntil his political and social status enables him to protect himself,\r\noffering to his legitimate ambition the stimulant of a perfectly fair\r\nchance in life, and granting to him the rights which in every just\r\norganization of society are coupled with corresponding duties.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nI may sum up all I have said in a few words. If nothing were necessary but\r\nto restore the machinery of government in the States lately in rebellion\r\nin point of form, the movements made to that end by the people of the\r\nsouth might be considered satisfactory. But if it is required that the\r\nsouthern people should also accommodate themselves to the results of the\r\nwar in point of spirit, those movements fall far short of what must be\r\ninsisted upon.\r\n\r\nThe loyalty of the masses and most of the leaders of the southern people,\r\nconsists in submission to necessity. There is, except in individual\r\ninstances, an entire absence of that national spirit which forms the basis\r\nof true loyalty and patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of the slaves is submitted to only in so far as chattel\r\nslavery in the old form could not be kept up. But although the freedman is\r\nno longer considered the property of the individual master, he is\r\nconsidered the slave of society, and all independent State legislation\r\nwill share the tendency to make him such. The ordinances abolishing\r\nslavery passed by the conventions under the pressure of circumstances,\r\nwill not be looked upon as barring the establishment of a new form of\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\nPractical attempts on the part of the southern people to deprive the negro\r\nof his rights as a freeman may result in bloody collisions, and will\r\ncertainly plunge southern society into restless fluctuations and\r\nanarchical confusion. Such evils can be prevented only by continuing the\r\ncontrol of the national government in the States lately in rebellion until\r\nfree labor is fully developed and firmly established, and the advantages\r\nand blessings of the new order of things have disclosed themselves. This\r\ndesirable result will be hastened by a firm declaration on the part of the\r\ngovernment, that national control in the south will not cease until such\r\nresults are secured. Only in this way can that security be established in\r\nthe south which will render numerous immigration possible, and such\r\nimmigration would materially aid a favorable development of things.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the problem would be very much facilitated by enabling all\r\nthe loyal and free-labor elements in the south to exercise a healthy\r\ninfluence upon legislation. It will hardly be possible to secure the\r\nfreedman against oppressive class legislation and private persecution,\r\nunless he be endowed with a certain measure of political power.\r\n\r\nAs to the future peace and harmony of the Union, it is of the highest\r\nimportance that the people lately in rebellion be not permitted to build\r\nup another \"peculiar institution\" whose spirit is in conflict with the\r\nfundamental principles of our political system; for as long as they\r\ncherish interests peculiar to them in preference to those they have in\r\ncommon with the rest of the American people, their loyalty to the Union\r\nwill always be uncertain.\r\n\r\nI desire not to be understood as saying that there are no well-meaning men\r\namong those who were compromised in the rebellion. There are many, but\r\nneither their number nor their influence is strong enough to control the\r\nmanifest tendency of the popular spirit. There are great reasons for hope\r\nthat a determined policy on the part of the national government will\r\nproduce innumerable and valuable conversions. This consideration counsels\r\nlenity as to persons, such as is demanded by the humane and enlightened\r\nspirit of our times, and vigor and firmness in the carrying out of\r\nprinciples, such as is demanded by the national sense of justice and the\r\nexigencies of our situation.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this report I desire to say that I have conscientiously\r\nendeavored to see things as they were, and to represent them as I saw\r\nthem: I have been careful not to use stronger language than was warranted\r\nby the thoughts I intended to express. A comparison of the tenor of the\r\nannexed documents with that of my report, will convince you that I have\r\nstudiously avoided overstatements. Certain legislative attempts at present\r\nmade in the south, and especially in South Carolina, seem to be more than\r\njustifying the apprehensions I have expressed.\r\n\r\nConscious though I am of having used my best endeavors to draw, from what\r\nI saw and learned, correct general conclusions, yet I am far from placing\r\ntoo great a trust in my own judgment, when interests of such magnitude are\r\nat stake. I know that this report is incomplete, although as complete as\r\nan observation of a few months could enable me to make it. Additional\r\nfacts might be elicited, calculated to throw new light upon the subject.\r\nAlthough I see no reason for believing that things have changed for the\r\nbetter since I left for the south, yet such may be the case. Admitting all\r\nthese possibilities, I would entreat you to take no irretraceable step\r\ntowards relieving the States lately in rebellion from all national\r\ncontrol, until such favorable changes are clearly and unmistakably\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nTo that end, and by virtue of the permission you honored me with when\r\nsending me out to communicate to you freely and unreservedly my views as\r\nto measures of policy proper to be adopted, I would now respectfully\r\nsuggest that you advise Congress to send one or more \"investigating\r\ncommittees\" into the southern States, to inquire for themselves into the\r\nactual condition of things, before final action is taken upon the\r\nreadmission of such States to their representation in the legislative\r\nbranch of the government, and the withdrawal of the national control from\r\nthat section of the country.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nCARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency ANDREW JOHNSON,\r\n_President of the United States_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS ACCOMPANYING THE REPORT OF MAJOR GENERAL CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF SOUTH CAROLINA,\r\n\r\n_Hilton Head, S.C., July_ 27, 1865.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: I have received your letter of the 17th instant, from\r\nCharleston, propounding to me three questions, as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. Do you think that there are a number of _bona fide_ loyal persons\r\nin this State large enough to warrant the early establishment of civil\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\n2d. Do you think that the white population of South Carolina, if restored\r\nto the possession of political power in this State, would carry out the\r\nspirit of the emancipation proclamation, and go to work in a _bona fide_\r\nmanner to organize free labor?\r\n\r\n3d. What measures do you think necessary to insure such a result in this\r\nState?\r\n\r\nThe first of these questions I am forced to answer in the negative,\r\nprovided that white persons only are referred to in the expression \"_bona\r\nfide loyal persons_,\" and provided that \"the early establishment of civil\r\ngovernment\" means the early withdrawal of the general control of affairs\r\nfrom the United States authorities.\r\n\r\nTo the second question, I answer that I do not think that the white\r\ninhabitants of South Carolina, if left to themselves, are yet prepared\r\nto carry out the spirit of the emancipation proclamation; neither do I\r\nthink that they would organize free labor upon any plan that would be\r\nof advantage to both whites and blacks until the mutual distrust and\r\nprejudice now existing between the races are in a measure removed.\r\n\r\nTo the third question I answer, that, in order to secure the carrying out\r\nof the \"spirit of the emancipation proclamation,\" and the organization of\r\nreally free labor in good faith, it appears to me necessary that the\r\nmilitary, or some other authority derived from the national government,\r\nshould retain a supervisory control over the civil affairs in this State\r\nuntil the next season's crops are harvested and secured.\r\n\r\nThe reasons which have dictated my replies I shall notice quite briefly.\r\n\r\nLoyalty in South Carolina--such loyalty as is secured by the taking of the\r\namnesty oath and by the reception of Executive clemency--does not approach\r\nthe standard of loyalty in the north. It is not the golden fruit of\r\nconviction, but the stern and unpromising result of necessity, arising\r\nfrom unsuccessful insurrection. The white population of the State accept\r\nthe condition which has been imposed upon them, simply because there is no\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\nThey entered upon the war in the spring of 1861 and arrayed themselves on\r\nthe side of treason with a unanimity of purpose and a malignity of feeling\r\nnot equalled by that displayed in any other State.\r\n\r\nThe individual exceptions to this rule were too few in numbers and were\r\npossessed of too little power to be taken into account at all. Although\r\nthe overt treason then inaugurated has been overcome by superior force,\r\nfew will claim that it has been transformed into loyalty toward the\r\nnational government. I am clearly of the opinion that it has not, and that\r\ntime and experience will be necessary to effect such a change.\r\n\r\nAll intelligent whites admit that the \"abolition of slavery\" and the\r\n\"impracticability of secession\" are the plain and unmistakable verdicts of\r\nthe war. Their convictions as yet go no further. Their preference for the\r\n\"divine institution,\" and their intellectual belief in the right of a\r\nState to secede, are as much articles of faith in their creed at the\r\npresent moment as they were on the day when the ordinance of secession was\r\nunanimously adopted. When the rebel armies ceased to exist, and there was\r\nno longer any force that could be invoked for waging war against the\r\nnation, the insurgents accepted that fact simply as proof of the\r\nimpossibility of their establishing an independent government. This\r\nsentiment was almost immediately followed by a general desire to save as\r\nmuch property as possible from the general wreck. To this state of the\r\npublic mind, which succeeded the surrender of the rebel armies with\r\nnoteworthy rapidity, I am forced to attribute the prevailing willingness\r\nand desire of the people to \"return\" to their allegiance, and resume the\r\navocations of peace.\r\n\r\nI do not regard this condition of things as at all discouraging. It is,\r\nindeed, better than I expected to see or dared to hope for in so short a\r\ntime. One good result of it is, that guerilla warfare, which was so very\r\ngenerally apprehended, has never been resorted to in this State. There was\r\na sudden and general change from a state of war to a state of peace, and,\r\nwith the exception of frequent individual conflicts, mostly between the\r\nwhites and blacks, and often, it is true, resulting in loss of life, that\r\npeace has rarely been disturbed.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a peace resulting from a cool and dispassionate appeal to\r\nreason, and not from any convictions of right or wrong; it has its origin\r\nin the head, and not in the heart. Impotency and policy gave it birth, and\r\nimpotency, policy and hope keep it alive. It is not inspired by any higher\r\nmotives than these, and higher motives could hardly be expected to follow\r\nimmediately in the footsteps of armed insurrection. The hopes of the\r\npeople are fixed, as a matter of course, upon the President. The whites\r\nhope and expect to recover the preponderating influence which they have\r\nlost by the war, and which has been temporarily replaced by the military\r\nauthority throughout the State, and they receive with general satisfaction\r\nthe appointment of Mr. Perry as provisional governor of the State, and\r\nregard it as a step toward their restoration to civil and political power.\r\nEven those men who have taken the lead during the war, not only in the\r\nheartiness and liberality of their support of the rebel cause, but also in\r\nthe bitterness of their denunciation of the national government and the\r\nloyal people of the northern States, express themselves as entirely\r\nsatisfied with the shape which events are taking.\r\n\r\nThe colored population, on the contrary, or that portion of it which\r\nmoulds the feelings and directs the passions of the mass, look with\r\ngrowing suspicion upon this state of affairs, and entertain the most\r\nlively apprehensions with regard to their future welfare. They have no\r\nfears of being returned to slavery, having the most implicit faith in our\r\nassurance of its abolition for all time to come, but they think they see\r\nthe power which has held the lash over them through many generations again\r\nbeing restored to their former masters, and they are impressed with a\r\ngreater or less degree of alarm.\r\n\r\nThus the \"irrepressible conflict,\" the antagonism of interest, thought,\r\nand sentiment between the races is perpetuated. The immediate resumption\r\nby the whites of the civil and political power of the State would have a\r\ntendency to augment this evil. At the present time all differences between\r\nthe whites and blacks, but more especially those growing out of agreements\r\nfor compensated labor, are promptly and willingly referred to the nearest\r\nmilitary authority for adjustment; the whites well knowing that simple\r\njustice will be administered, and the blacks inspired by the belief that\r\nwe are their friends. This plan works smoothly and satisfactorily. Many of\r\nthe labor contracts upon the largest plantations have been made with\r\nspecial reference to the planting and harvesting of the next year's crops;\r\nothers expire with the present year. The immediate restoration of the\r\ncivil power by removing military restraint from those planters who are not\r\nentirely sincere in their allegiance, and have not made their pledges and\r\nespecially their labor contracts in good faith, and by withdrawing from\r\nthe blacks that source of protection to which alone they look for justice\r\nwith any degree of confidence, would, by engendering new suspicions, and\r\nnew prejudices between the races, work disadvantageously to both in a\r\npecuniary sense, while the successful solution of the important question\r\nof free black labor would be embarrassed, deferred, and possibly defeated,\r\ninasmuch as it would be placed thereby in the hands of men who are\r\navowedly suspicious of the negro, and have no confidence in his fitness\r\nfor freedom, or his willingness to work; who regard the abolition of\r\nslavery as a great sectional calamity, and who, under the semblance and\r\neven the protection of the law, and without violating the letter of the\r\nemancipation proclamation, would have it in their power to impose burdens\r\nupon the negro race scarcely less irksome than those from which it has\r\ntheoretically escaped. Indeed, the ordinary vagrancy and apprenticeship\r\nlaws now in force in some of the New England States (slightly modified\r\nperhaps) could be so administered and enforced upon the blacks in South\r\nCarolina as to keep them in practical slavery. They could, while bearing\r\nthe name of freeman, be legally subjected to all the oppressive features\r\nof serfdom, peonage, and feudalism combined, without possessing the right\r\nto claim, much less the power to exact, any of the prerogatives and\r\namenities belonging to either of those systems of human bondage. All this\r\ncould be done without violating the letter of the emancipation\r\nproclamation; no argument is necessary to prove that it would be a total\r\nsubmission of its spirit. Even upon the presumption that the whites, when\r\nagain clothed with civil authority, would be influenced by a sincere\r\ndesire to enforce the emancipation proclamation, and organize free labor\r\nupon a wise and just basis, it would seem injudicious to intrust them with\r\nunlimited power, which might be wielded to the injury of both races until\r\nthe prejudices and animosities which generated the rebellion and gave it\r\nlife and vigor have had time to subside. Few men have any clear conception\r\nof what the general good at the present time requires in the way of State\r\nlegislation. A thousand vague theories are floating upon the public mind.\r\n\r\nThe evils which we would have to fear from an immediate re-establishment\r\nof civil government would be not only hasty and ignorant but excessive\r\nlegislation. While there may be wide differences of opinion as to which is\r\nthe greater of these two evils _per se_, I am free to express my belief\r\nthat one or the other of them would be very likely to follow the immediate\r\nrestoration of civil government, and that it would be not only injudicious\r\nin itself but productive of prospective harm, to whites as well as blacks,\r\nto place the former in a position where a community of feeling, the\r\npromptings of traditional teachings, and the instincts of self-interest\r\nand self-preservation, would so strongly tempt them to make a choice. I\r\nbelieve that a respectable majority of the most intelligent whites would\r\ncordially aid any policy calculated, in their opinion, to secure the\r\ngreatest good of the greatest number, blacks included, but I do not regard\r\nthem as yet in a condition to exercise an unbiassed judgment in this\r\nmatter. Inasmuch as very few of them are yet ready to admit the\r\npracticability of ameliorating the condition of the black race to any\r\nconsiderable extent, they would not be likely at the present time to\r\ndevise a wise system of free black labor. Neither would they be zealous\r\nand hopeful co-laborers in such a system if desired by others.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the contract system which has been inaugurated by the\r\nmilitary authorities throughout the State as working smoothly and\r\nsatisfactorily. This statement should, of course, be taken with some\r\nlimitation. It was inaugurated as an expedient under the pressure of\r\nstringent necessity at a time when labor was in a greatly disorganized\r\nstate, and there was manifest danger that the crops, already planted,\r\nwould be lost for want of cultivation. Many of the negroes, but more\r\nespecially the able-bodied ones and those possessing no strong family\r\nties, had, under the novel impulses of freedom, left the plantation where\r\nthey had been laboring through the planting season, and flocked to the\r\nnearest military post, becoming a useless and expensive burden upon our\r\nhands. Very many plantations, under extensive cultivation, were entirely\r\nabandoned. At places remote from military posts, and that had never been\r\nvisited by our troops, this exodus did not take place so extensively or to\r\na degree threatening a very general loss of crops. The negroes were\r\nretained partly through ignorance or uncertainty of their rights and\r\npartly through fear of their former masters and the severe discipline\r\nunlawfully enforced by them.\r\n\r\nUnder the assurance that they were free, that they would be protected in\r\nthe enjoyment of their freedom and the fruits of their labor, but would\r\nnot be supported in idleness by the government so long as labor could be\r\nprocured, the flow of negroes into the towns and military posts was\r\nstopped, and most of them already accumulated there were induced to return\r\nto the plantations and resume work under contracts to be approved and\r\nenforced by the military authorities. Both planters and negroes very\r\ngenerally, and apparently quite willingly, fell into this plan as the\r\nbest that could be improvised. Although there have been many instances\r\nof violation of contracts, (more frequently, I think, by the black than by\r\nthe white,) and although the plan possesses many defects, and is not\r\ncalculated to develop all the advantages and benefits of a wise free-labor\r\nsystem. I am not prepared to recommend any material modification of it, or\r\nanything to replace it, at least for several months to come.\r\n\r\nFor reasons already suggested I believe that the restoration of civil\r\npower that would take the control of this question out of the hands of the\r\nUnited States authorities (whether exercised through the military\r\nauthorities or through the Freedmen's Bureau) would, instead of removing\r\nexisting evils, be almost certain to augment them.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nQ.A. GILLMORE,\r\n_Major General_.\r\n\r\nGeneral CARL SCHURZ, _Charleston, S.C._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 4.\r\n\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, _July_ 25, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: Since handing you my letter of yesterday I have read a speech\r\nreported to have been delivered in Greenville, South Carolina, on the 3d\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nI have judged of Mr. Perry by reports of others, but as I now have an\r\nopportunity from his own lips of knowing his opinions, I must request that\r\nyou will cross out that portion of my letter referring to him.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN P. HATCH,\r\n_Brevet Major General, Commanding_.\r\n\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF CHARLESTON,\r\n\r\n_Charleston, South Carolina, July_ 24, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: In answer to your question as to the disposition of the people\r\nbeing such as to justify their speedy return to the control of political\r\npower, I would say no.\r\n\r\nMany portions of the State have not yet been visited by our troops, and in\r\nother parts not long enough occupied to encourage the formation of a new\r\nparty, disposed to throw off the old party rulers, who, after thirty years\r\npreaching sedition, succeeded in carrying their point and forcing the\r\npeople into rebellion.\r\n\r\nWere elections to be held now, the old leaders already organized would\r\ncarry everything by the force of their organization. I would say delay\r\naction, pardon only such as the governor can recommend, and let him only\r\nrecommend such as he feels confident will support the views of the\r\ngovernment. Men who supported nullification in thirty-two, and have upheld\r\nthe doctrine of States' rights since, should not be pardoned; they cannot\r\nlearn new ways. I have read with care the published proceedings of every\r\npublic meeting held in this State, and have observed that not one single\r\nresolution has yet been passed in which the absolute freedom of the\r\ncolored man was recognized, or the doctrine of the right of secession\r\ndisavowed. Why is this? Because the old leaders have managed the meetings,\r\nand they cannot see that a new order of things exists. They still hope to\r\nobtain control of the State, and then to pass laws with reference to the\r\ncolored people which shall virtually re-establish slavery; and although\r\nthey look upon secession as at present hopeless, a future war may enable\r\nthem to again raise the standard.\r\n\r\nYou ask what signs do they show of a disposition to educate the blacks for\r\nthe new position they are to occupy? This is a question that has so far\r\nbeen but little discussed. No education, except as to their religious\r\nduties, was formerly allowed, and this only to make them contented in\r\ntheir position of servitude. Whilst thoroughly instructed in the\r\ninjunction, \"servants obey your masters,\" adultery was not only winked at,\r\nbut, unfortunately, in too many cases practically recommended. A few\r\ngentlemen have said to me that they were willing to have the blacks taught\r\nto read and write, but little interest appears to be felt on the subject.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the benefit to be derived by the general government by\r\ndelaying the formation for the present of a State government, I will be\r\nbrief. It will discourage the old leaders who are anxious to seize\r\nimmediately the reins of power. It will, by allowing time for discussion,\r\ngive the people an opportunity to become acquainted with subjects they\r\nhave heretofore trusted to their leaders. Wherever our troops go,\r\ndiscussion follows, and it would be best that the people should not commit\r\nthemselves to a line of policy, they have not had time to examine and\r\ndecide upon coolly. It will give the young men ambitious of rising\r\nopportunity for organizing on a new platform a party which, assisted by\r\nthe government, can quiet forever the questions which have made the State\r\nof South Carolina a thorn in the side of the Union. These young men, many\r\nof whom have served in the army, take a practical view of their present\r\ncondition that the old stay-at-homes cannot be brought to understand. Give\r\nthem time and support and they will do the work required of them. Their\r\nlong absence has made it necessary to become acquainted with the people;\r\nbut they will be listened to as men who have honestly fought in a cause\r\nwhich has failed, and will be respected for as honestly coming out in\r\nsupport of the now only reasonable chance of a peaceful government for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhere our troops have been the longest time stationed we have the most\r\nfriends; and were the people thoroughly convinced that the government\r\n(until they have shown a disposition to unite heartily in its support) is\r\ndetermined not to give them a State government, the change would go on\r\nmuch more rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe selection of Governor Perry was most fortunate. I know of no other man\r\nin South Carolina who could have filled the position.\r\n\r\nI remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJNO. P. HATCH,\r\n_Brevet Major General Commanding_.\r\n\r\nGeneral CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 5.\r\n\r\nCharleston, S.C., _July_ 24, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: In compliance with your verbal request, made at our interview\r\nthis a.m., to express to you my opinions and impressions regarding the\r\nstatus of the people of South Carolina, and of such others of the\r\ninsurrectionary States with whom I have come in contact, respecting a\r\nreturn to their allegiance to the federal government, and a willingness on\r\ntheir part to sustain and support the same in its efforts to restore and\r\naccomplish the actual union of the States, and also their probable\r\nadhesion to the several acts and proclamations which have been enacted and\r\npromulgated by the legislative and executive branches of the government, I\r\nbeg to reply, that, as an officer of one of the departments, I have been\r\nenabled by constant intercourse with large numbers of this people to form\r\nan approximate estimate of the nature of their loyalty, and also to gain a\r\nknowledge of the prejudices which remain with them towards the forces,\r\nmilitary and political, which have prevailed against them after the\r\nstruggle of the last four years, and established the integrity and power\r\nof the republic.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said upon the abstract question of voluntary or forcible\r\nState secession, the defeat of the insurrectionary forces has been so\r\nperfect and complete, that the most defiant have already avowed their\r\nallegiance to the national government. The first experience of the\r\ninsurgents is a complete submission, followed by a promise to abstain from\r\nall further acts of rebellion--in fact, the nucleus of their loyalty is\r\nnecessity, while perhaps some with still a sentiment of loyalty in their\r\nhearts for the old flag turn back, like the prodigal, with tearful eyes,\r\nwasted means, and exhausted energies.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there can be but few loyal men in the State of South\r\nCarolina who, through evil and good report, have withstood the wiles of\r\nsecession. South Carolina has been sown broadcast for the last thirty\r\nyears with every conceivable form of literature which taught her children\r\nthe divine right of State sovereignty, carrying with it all its\r\naccompanying evils. The sovereign State of South Carolina in her imperial\r\nmajesty looked down upon the republic itself, and only through a grand\r\ncondescension, remained to supervise and balance the power which, when not\r\ncontrolling, she had sworn to destroy. The works of Calhoun were the\r\nnecessary companion of every man of culture and education. They were by no\r\nmeans confined to the libraries of the economist and politician. When the\r\nnational troops pillaged the houses and deserted buildings of Charleston,\r\nthe streets were strewn with the pamphlets, sermons and essays of\r\npoliticians, clergymen, and belles-lettres scholars, all promulgating,\r\naccording to the ability and tastes of their several authors, the rights\r\nof the sovereign State. No public occasion passed by which did not witness\r\nan assertion of these rights, and the gauntlet of defiance was ever upon\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nIt is the loyalty of such a people that we have to consider. As a people\r\nthe South Carolinians are brave and generous in certain directions. In\r\ntheir cities there is great culture, and many of the citizens are persons\r\nof refinement, education and taste. The educated classes are well versed\r\nin the history of our country, and many have an intimate knowledge of the\r\nvaried story of political parties. But from the lowest to the highest\r\nclasses of the white population there is an instinctive dread of the negro\r\nand an utter abhorrence of any doctrine which argues an ultimate\r\nimprovement of his condition beyond that of the merest chattel laborer.\r\n\r\nThe first proposition made by the southerner on all occasions of\r\ndiscussion is, that the emancipation proclamation of the President was a\r\ngrievous error from every point of view; that in the settlement of the\r\nvarious questions arising from the insurrection, the national government\r\nassumes a responsibility which belongs to the several States, and now that\r\nthe supremacy of the general government is established, and the prospect\r\nof a resuscitation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, or simple assertion of\r\nthe legislative and executive powers of the separate States, a lingering\r\nhope yet remains with many, that although African slavery is abolished,\r\nthe States may yet so legislate as to place the negro in a state of actual\r\npeonage and submission to the will of the employer. Therefore, we have\r\ncombined with a forced and tardy loyalty a lingering hope that such State\r\nlegislation can be resorted to as will restore the former slave to, as\r\nnearly as possible, the condition of involuntary servitude. And the\r\nquestion naturally arises, how long must we wait for a higher and purer\r\nexpression of fealty to the Union, and for a more intelligent and just\r\nappreciation of the question of free colored, labor which the results of\r\nthe contest have forced upon us?\r\n\r\nI am satisfied, that while no efforts must be spared to instil into the\r\nminds of the freedmen the necessity of patient labor and endeavor, and a\r\npractical knowledge of the responsibilities of their new condition, by a\r\njudicious system of education, the white southerner is really the most\r\ninteresting pupil, and we must all feel a solicitude for his\r\nenlightenment.\r\n\r\nThe principles of liberty have been working for a number of years in our\r\nrepublic, and have secured various great political results. Latterly they\r\nhave worked with wonderful and rapid effect, and it has ever been by aid\r\nof all the forces of education and enlightened commerce between man and\r\nman that the progress of true freedom has been hastened and made secure.\r\nWhen the southern planter sees it demonstrated beyond a doubt that the\r\nfree labor of the black man, properly remunerated, conduces to his\r\npecuniary interests, at that moment he will accept the situation, and not\r\nbefore, unless it is forced upon him; therefore, it is the white\r\nsoutherner that must be educated into a realization of his responsibility\r\nin the settlement of these questions, and by a systematic and judicious\r\neducation of the freedman a citizen will gradually be developed; and the\r\ntwo classes, finding their interests mutual, will soon settle the now\r\nvexed question of suffrage. I am firmly of opinion that the government\r\ncannot afford to relax its hold upon these States until a loyal press,\r\nrepresenting the views of the government, shall disseminate its sentiments\r\nbroadcast all over this southern land; and when all the avenues and\r\nchannels of communication shall have been opened, and the policy of the\r\ngovernment shall be more easily ascertained and promulgated, and the\r\nStates, or the citizens thereof in sufficient numbers, shall have avowed\r\nby word and act their acceptance of the new order of things, we may then\r\nsafely consider the expediency of surrendering to each State legislature\r\nthe duty of framing its necessary constitution and code, and all other\r\nadjuncts of civil government. If the form of our government were\r\nmonarchical, we might be more sanguine of the success of any proposed\r\nmeasure of amnesty, because of the immediate power of the government to\r\nsuppress summarily any disorder arising from too great leniency; but to\r\ndelegate to the States themselves the quelling of the tumult which they\r\nhave themselves raised, is, to say the least, a doubtful experiment. Many\r\nthinking Carolinians have said that they preferred that the government\r\nshould first itself demonstrate the system of free labor, to such an\r\nextent that the planter would gladly avail himself of the system and carry\r\nit on to its completion.\r\n\r\nThe presence of a strong military force is still needed in the State of\r\nSouth Carolina to maintain order, and to see that the national laws are\r\nrespected, as well as to enforce such municipal regulations as the\r\noccasion demands. For such service, officers of sound, practical sense\r\nshould be chosen--men whose appreciation of strict justice both to\r\nemployer and employee would compensate even for a lack of mere skilful\r\nmilitary knowledge; men without the mean prejudices which are the bane of\r\nsome who wear the insignia of the national service.\r\n\r\nI believe that affairs in South Carolina are yet in a very crude state;\r\nthat outrages are being practiced upon the negro which the military arm\r\nshould prevent. Doubtless many stories are fabricated or exaggerated, but\r\na calm and candid citizen of Charleston has said: \"Is it wonderful that\r\nthis should be so; that men whose slaves have come at their call, but now\r\ndemur, hesitate, and perhaps refuse labor or demand certain wages\r\ntherefor--that such men, smarting under their losses and defeats, should\r\nvent their spite upon a race slipping from their power and asserting their\r\nnewly acquired rights? Is abuse not a natural result?\" But time,\r\nenlightenment, and the strenuous efforts of the government can prevent\r\nmuch of this.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, convinced that the education of the white and black must\r\ngo hand in hand together until the system of free labor is so absolutely\r\ndemonstrated that the interest of the employer will be found in the\r\nintelligence, the well-being, and the comfort of the employed. I believe\r\nthat the great sources of benevolence at the north should still flood this\r\nsouthern land with its bounty--that the national government should\r\nencourage each State to receive all the implements of labor, education and\r\ncomfort which a generous people can bestow, not merely for the benefit of\r\nthe black freedman, but for the disenthralled white who has grovelled in\r\nthe darkness of a past age, and who has been, perhaps, the innocent\r\noppressor of a people he may yet serve, and with them enter into the\r\nenjoyment of a more glorious freedom than either have ever conceived.\r\n\r\nWith sentiments of respect and esteem, I beg to remain, general, your\r\nobedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN H. PILSBURY,\r\n_Deputy Supervising and Assistant Special Agent Treasury Department_.\r\n\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ, &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 6.\r\n\r\n_VIEWS EXPRESSED BY MAJOR GENERAL STEEDMAN IN CONVERSATION WITH CARL\r\nSCHURZ_.\r\n\r\nAugusta, Georgia, _August_ 7, 1864.\r\n\r\nI have been in command of this department only a month, and can,\r\ntherefore, not pretend to have as perfect a knowledge of the condition of\r\naffairs, and the sentiments of the people of Georgia, as I may have after\r\nlonger experience. But observations so far made lead me to the following\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\nThe people of this State, with only a few individual exceptions, are\r\nsubmissive but not loyal.\r\n\r\nIf intrusted with political power at this time they will in all\r\nprobability use it as much as possible to escape from the legitimate\r\nresults of the war. Their political principles, as well as their views on\r\nthe slavery question, are the same as before the war, and all that can be\r\nexpected of them is that they will submit to actual necessities from which\r\nthere is no escape.\r\n\r\nThe State is quiet, in so far as there is no organised guerilla warfare.\r\nConflicts between whites and blacks are not unfrequent, and in many\r\ninstances result in bloodshed.\r\n\r\nAs to the labor question, I believe that the planters of this region have\r\nabsolutely no conception of what free labor is. I consider them entirely\r\nincapable of legislating understandingly upon the subject at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe organization of labor in this State, especially in the interior, has\r\nso far, in most cases, been left to the planters and freedmen themselves,\r\nthe organization of the Freedmen's Bureau being as yet quite imperfect. A\r\ngreat many contracts have been made between planters and freedmen, some of\r\nwhich were approved by the military authorities and some were not.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wilde, the principal agent of the Freedmen's Bureau in this State,\r\nis, in my opinion, entirely unfit for the discharge of the duties\r\nincumbent upon him. He displays much vigor where it is not wanted, and\r\nshows but very little judgment where it is wanted. Until the Freedmen's\r\nBureau will be sufficiently organized in this State I deem it necessary to\r\ntemporarily intrust the provost marshals, now being stationed all over the\r\nState, one to every four counties, with the discharge of its functions,\r\nespecially as concerns the making of contracts and the adjustment of\r\ndifficulties between whites and blacks.\r\n\r\nI deem it impracticable to refer such difficulties for adjustment to such\r\ncivil courts as can at present be organized in this State. It would be\r\nlike leaving each party to decide the case for itself, and would\r\nundoubtedly at once result in a free fight. It will be so until the people\r\nof this State have a more accurate idea of the rights of the freedmen. The\r\nmilitary power is, in my opinion, the only tribunal which, under existing\r\ncircumstances, can decide difficulties between whites and blacks to the\r\nsatisfaction of both parties and can make its decisions respected.\r\n\r\nAs for the restoration of civil power in this State, I apprehend it cannot\r\nbe done without leading to the necessity of frequent interference on the\r\npart of the military until the sentiments of the people of Georgia have\r\nundergone a very great change.\r\n\r\nThis memorandum was read to General Steedman by me and he authorized me\r\nto submit it in this form to the President.\r\n\r\nC. SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 7.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLUMBUS,\r\n\r\n_Macon, Georgia, August_ 14, 1885.\r\n\r\nGeneral: There are no loyal people in Georgia, except the negroes; nor are\r\nthere any considerable number who would under any circumstances offer\r\narmed resistance to the national authority. An officer, without arms or\r\nescort, could arrest any man in the State. But, while their submission is\r\nthus complete and universal, it is not a matter of choice, but a stern\r\nnecessity which they deplore.\r\n\r\nIf allowed they will readily reorganize their State government and\r\nadminister it upon correct principles, except in matters pertaining to\r\ntheir former slaves. On this subject they admit the abolition of the\r\ninstitution, and will so frame their constitution, hoping thereby to\r\nprocure their recognition as a State government, when they will at once,\r\nby legislation, reduce the freedmen to a condition worse than slavery. Yet\r\nwhile they will not recognize the rights of their former slaves\r\nthemselves, they will submit to its full recognition by the national\r\ngovernment, which can do just as it pleases and no resistance will be\r\noffered. My own clear opinion is, it will have to do everything that may\r\nbe necessary to secure real practical freedom to the former slaves.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances at present are chiefly due, I think, to the swarm of\r\nvagrants thrown upon society by the disbanding of the rebel armies and the\r\nemancipation of the slaves at a season of the year when it is difficult\r\nfor those who seek to find employment.\r\n\r\nAfter the 1st of January I apprehend no trouble, as the culture of the\r\nnext crop will absorb all the labor of the country. In the interim a great\r\ndeal of care and diligence will be required. Hence I recommend the\r\nimportance of sending men of energy and business capacity to manage the\r\naffairs of the Freedmen's Bureau.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN T. CROXTON,\r\n_Brigadier General United States_.\r\n\r\nGeneral CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 8.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,\r\n\r\n_New Orleans, June_ 20, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to transmit for your consideration a copy of the\r\ncorrespondence between the governor of Louisiana and myself touching the\r\nrelations between the State and the military authorities in this\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe instructions upon this subject are, and probably designedly,\r\nindefinite. They indicate, however, the acceptance by the President of the\r\nconstitution of the State, adopted in September, 1864, as the means of\r\nre-establishing civil government in the State and the recognition of the\r\ngovernor as his agent in accomplishing this work. The same principle gives\r\nvalidity to such of the State laws as are not in conflict with this\r\nconstitution, or repealed by congressional legislation, or abrogated by\r\nthe President's proclamation or orders issued during the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThis leaves many questions undetermined, except so far as they are settled\r\nby the law of nations and the laws of war, so far as my authority extends.\r\nI will turn over all such questions to the State government; and in cases\r\nthat do not come within the legitimate authority of a military commander,\r\nwill report them for such action as his excellency the President, or the\r\nWar Department, may think proper to adopt.\r\n\r\nI have had a very free conference with the governor upon this subject, and\r\nI believe that he concurs with me that the course I have indicated in the\r\ncorrespondence with him is not only the legal but the only course that\r\nwill avoid the appeals to the local courts by interested or designing men,\r\nwhich are now dividing those who profess to be working for the same\r\nobject--the re-establishment of civil authority throughout the State.\r\n\r\nThen, in addition, many questions, in which the interests of the\r\ngovernment are directly involved, or in which the relations of the general\r\ngovernment to the States, as affected by the rebellion, are left unsettled\r\nby any adequate legislation. I do not think it will be wise to commit any\r\nof these questions, either directly or indirectly, to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe State or other local courts, and will not so commit them unless\r\ninstructed to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that in the varied and complicated questions that will\r\ncome up there may be differences of opinion between the governor and\r\nmyself, but there shall be no discord of action, and I will give to his\r\nefforts the fullest support in my power.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir,\r\n\r\nE.R.S.

DES ANGES,\r\n_Major, A.A.G._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF LOUISIANA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_New Orleans, June_ 10, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: There is a class of officers holding and exercising the duties of\r\ncivil officers in this State who claim to hold their right to the same by\r\nvirtue of deriving their appointment from military authority exercised\r\neither by General Shepley as military governor, or Michael Hahn, and in\r\nsome cases by Major General Banks, commander of the department of the\r\nGulf. These men resist my power to remove on the ground that I am not\r\nclothed with military power, although the offices they fill are strictly\r\ncivil offices, and the power of appointing to the same to fill vacancies\r\n(which constructively exist until the office is filled according to law)\r\nis one of my prerogatives as civil governor. To dispossess these men by\r\nlegal process involves delay and trouble. Many of the persons so holding\r\noffice are obnoxious to the charges of official misconduct and of\r\nobstructing my efforts to re-establish civil government.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose, therefore, of settling the question, and relieving the\r\ncivil government of the State from the obstructions to its progress caused\r\nby the opposition of these men, I would respectfully suggest to you,\r\ngeneral, the expediency of your issuing an order revoking all appointments\r\nmade by military or semi-military authority to civil offices in this State\r\nprior to the 4th of March, 1865, the date on which I assumed the duties of\r\ngovernor. I fix that date because it is only since that period the\r\ngovernor has been confined to strictly civil powers, and what military\r\npower has been exercised since in appointments to office has been from\r\nnecessity and was unavoidable.\r\n\r\nI throw out these suggestions, general, for your consideration. On my\r\nrecent visit to the capital I had full and free conversation with\r\nPresident Johnson on the subject of reorganizing civil government in\r\nLouisiana, and while deprecating the interference of military power in\r\ncivil government beyond the point of actual necessity, yet he fully\r\nappreciated the difficulties of my position, and assured me that I should\r\nbe sustained by him in all necessary and legal measures to organize and\r\nuphold civil government.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, &c.,\r\n\r\nJ. MADISON WELLS,\r\n_Governor of Louisiana_.\r\n\r\nMajor General E.R.S. CANBY, _Commanding Department of the Gulf_.\r\n\r\nOfficial copy:\r\n\r\nR. DES ANGES,\r\n_Major, A.A.G._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,\r\n\r\n_New Orleans, June_ 19, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of\r\nthe 10th instant, asking me to revoke all appointments made by military or\r\nsemi-military authority to civil offices in the State prior to the 4th of\r\nMarch, 1865.\r\n\r\nI have given this subject the attention and serious consideration which\r\nits importance demands, and I find it complicated not only with the\r\nprivate and public interests of the people and State of Louisiana, but\r\nalso with the direct interests of the government of the United States, or\r\nwith the obligations imposed upon the government by the condition of the\r\ncountry or by the antecedent exercise of lawful military authority. To the\r\nextent that these considerations obtain they are controlling\r\nconsiderations, and I cannot find that I have any authority to delegate\r\nthe duties devolved upon me by my official position, or to evade the\r\nresponsibilities which it imposes. I venture the suggestion, also, that\r\nthe evils complained of, and which are so apparent and painful to all who\r\nare interested in the restoration of civil authority, will scarcely be\r\nobtained by the course you recommend, but will, in my judgment, give rise\r\nto complications that will embarrass not only the State but the general\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAll officers who hold their offices by the tenure of military appointment\r\nare subject to military authority and control, and will not be permitted\r\nto interfere in any manner whatever with the exercise of functions that\r\nhave been committed to you as governor of Louisiana. If they are obnoxious\r\nto the charge of misconduct in office, or of obstructing you in your\r\nefforts to re-establish civil government, they will, upon your\r\nrecommendation, be removed. If, under the constitution and laws of the\r\nState, the power of appointment resides in the governor, my duty will be\r\nended by vacating the appointment. If the office is elective, the military\r\nappointment will be cancelled so soon as the successor is elected and\r\nqualified. In the alternative cases the removal will be made, and\r\nsuccessors recommended by you, and against whom there are no disqualifying\r\ncharges, will be appointed.\r\n\r\nThis, in my judgment, is the only course which will remove all legal\r\nobjections, or even legal quibbles.\r\n\r\nI desire to divest myself as soon as possible of all questions of civil\r\nadministration, and will separate, as soon and as far as I can, all such\r\nquestions from those that are purely military in their character, and\r\ncommit them to the care of the proper officers of the civil government.\r\n\r\nSome of these questions are complicated in their character, and involve\r\nnot only private and public interests, but the faith of the national\r\ngovernment; originating in the legal exercise of military authority, they\r\ncan only be determined by the same authority.\r\n\r\nThere is another consideration, not directly but incidentally involved in\r\nthe subject of your communication, to which I have the honor to invite\r\nyour attention. The results of the past four years have worked many\r\nchanges both as to institutions and individuals within the insurrectionary\r\nStates, giving to some of the interests involved an absolutely national\r\ncharacter, and in others leaving the relations between the general\r\ngovernment and the States undetermined. So far as Congress has legislated\r\nupon these subjects, it has placed them under the direct control of the\r\ngeneral government, and under the laws of nations and laws of war the same\r\nprinciple applies to the other subject. Until Congress has legislated upon\r\nthis subject, or until Executive authority sanctions it, no questions of\r\nthis character will be committed to the jurisdiction of the local courts.\r\n\r\nI make these suggestions to you for the reason that I have already found a\r\nstrong disposition in some sections of the country to forestall the action\r\nof the general government by bringing these subjects more or less directly\r\nunder the control of the local courts; and I have neither the authority\r\nnor the disposition to establish precedents that may possibly embarrass\r\nthe future action of the government.\r\n\r\nI take this occasion to assure your excellency of my hearty co-operation\r\nin your efforts to re-establish civil government, and in any measures that\r\nmay be undertaken for the benefit of the State or people of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nI shall be happy at all times to confer with you upon any of these\r\nsubjects, and to give you, whenever necessary, any assistance that you may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nE.R.S.

I desire to state that\r\nyour views and suggestions, as regards your duty and proper course of\r\naction in the premises, are entirely satisfactory to me. For the care you\r\nhave bestowed on the subject, and the earnest disposition you evince to do\r\nall in your power to promote the interests of civil government in this\r\nunfortunate State, by co-operating with and sustaining me in all\r\nlegitimate measures to that end, I beg to return you, not only my own\r\nthanks, but I feel authorized to speak for the great mass of our\r\nfellow-citizens, and to include them in the same category.\r\n\r\nWith high respect, I subscribe myself, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ. MADISON WELLS,\r\n_Governor of Louisiana_.\r\n\r\nMajor General E.R.S. CANBY,\r\n_Commanding Department of the Gulf_.\r\n\r\nOfficial copy:\r\n\r\nR. DES ANGES,\r\n_Major, A.A.G._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF LOUISIANA,\r\n\r\n_New Orleans, September_ 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: In compliance with your request, I have the honor to submit some\r\nremarks upon the civil government of Louisiana, and its relation to the\r\nmilitary administration of this department. These relations are more\r\nanomalous and complicated, probably, than in any other insurrectionary\r\nState, and it will be useful in considering these questions to bear in\r\nmind the changes that have occurred since the occupation of this city by\r\nthe Union forces. These are, briefly--\r\n\r\n1. The military administration of the commander of the department of the\r\nGulf, Major General Butler.\r\n\r\n2. The military government, of which Brigadier General Shepley was the\r\nexecutive, by appointment of the President.\r\n\r\n3. The provisional government, of which the Hon. M. Hahn was the executive,\r\nby appointment of the President, upon nomination by the people at an\r\nelection held under military authority.\r\n\r\n4. The constitutional government, organized under the constitution adopted\r\nby the convention in July, 1864, and ratified by the people at an election\r\nheld in September of that year. Of this government the Hon. J.M. Wells is\r\nthe present executive.\r\n\r\nThis government has not yet been recognized by Congress, and its relation\r\nto the military authority of the department has never been clearly\r\ndefined. Being restrained by constitutional limitations, its powers are\r\nnecessarily imperfect, and it is frequently necessary to supplant them by\r\nmilitary authority. Many of the civil officers still hold their positions\r\nby the tenure of military appointments holding over until elections can be\r\nheld under the constitution. These appointments may be vacated by the\r\ncommander of the department, and, if under the constitution the power of\r\nappointment reside in the governor, be filled by him: if it does not, the\r\nappointment must be filled by the military commander. Very few removals\r\nand no appointments have been made by me during my command of the\r\ndepartment; but the governor has been advised that all persons holding\r\noffice by the tenure of military appointment were subject to military\r\nsupervision and control, and would not be permitted to interfere in the\r\nduties committed to him by the President of restoring \"civil authority in\r\nthe State of Louisiana;\" that upon his recommendation, and for _cause_,\r\nsuch officers would be removed; and if the power of appointment was not\r\nunder the constitution vested in him, the appointment would be made by the\r\ndepartment commander, if, upon his recommendation, there was no\r\ndisqualifying exception.\r\n\r\nThe instructions to the military commanders, in relation to the previous\r\ngovernments, were general, and I believe explicit; but, as their\r\napplication passed away with the existence of these governments, it is not\r\nnecessary to refer to them here. Those that relate to the constitutional\r\ngovernment are very brief, so far, at least, as they have reached me. In a\r\nconfidential communication from his excellency to the late President, in\r\nwhich he deprecated, in strong terms, any military interferences, and\r\nexpressed very freely his own views and wishes, he concluded by saying\r\nthat \"the military must be judge and master so long as the necessity for\r\nthe military remains;\" and, in my instructions from the War Department, of\r\nMay 28, 1865, the Secretary of War says: \"The President directs me to\r\nexpress his wish that the military authorities render all proper\r\nassistance to the civil authorities in control in the State of Louisiana,\r\nand not to interfere with its action further than it may be necessary for\r\nthe peace and security of the department.\"\r\n\r\nThese directions and wishes have been conclusive, and I have given to the\r\ncivil authorities whatever support and assistance they required, and have\r\nabstained from any interference with questions of civil or local State\r\nadministration, except when it was necessary to protect the freedmen in\r\ntheir newly acquired rights, and to prevent the local courts from assuming\r\njurisdiction in cases where, of law and of right, the jurisdiction belongs\r\ninclusively to the United States courts or United States authorities. With\r\nthe appointments made by the governor I have no right to interfere unless\r\nthe appointees are disqualified by coming under some one of the exceptions\r\nmade by the President in his proclamation of May 29, 1865, or, (as in one\r\nor two instances that have occurred,) in the case of double appointments\r\nto the same office, when a conflict might endanger the peace and security\r\nof the department.\r\n\r\nMy personal and official intercourse with the governor has been of the\r\nmost cordial character. I have had no reason to distrust his wish and\r\nintention to carry out the views of the President. I do distrust both the\r\nloyalty and the honesty (political) of some of his advisers, and I look\r\nwith apprehension upon many of the appointments made under these\r\ninfluences during the past two months. The feeling and temper of that part\r\nof the population of Louisiana which was actively engaged in or\r\nsympathized with the rebellion have also materially changed within that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe political and commercial combinations against the north are gaining\r\nin strength and confidence every day. Political, sectional, and local\r\nquestions, that I had hoped were buried with the dead of the past four\r\nyears, are revived. Independent sovereignty, State rights, and\r\nnullification, where the power to nullify is revoked, are openly\r\ndiscussed. It may be that these are only ordinary political discussions,\r\nand that I attach undue importance to them from the fact that I have never\r\nbefore been so intimately in contact with them; but, to my judgment, they\r\nindicate very clearly that it will not be wise or prudent to commit any\r\nquestion involving the paramount supremacy of the government of the United\r\nStates to the States that have been in insurrection until the whole\r\nsubject of restoration has been definitively and satisfactorily adjusted.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject I think it proper to invite your attention to\r\nthe position of a part of the colored population of this State. By the\r\nPresident's proclamation of January 1, 1863, certain parishes in this\r\nState (thirteen in number) were excepted from its provisions--the\r\ncondition of the negroes as to slavery remaining unchanged until they\r\nwere emancipated by the constitution of 1864. If this constitution should\r\nbe rejected (the State of Louisiana not admitted under it) the legal\r\ncondition of these people will be that of slavery until this defect can\r\nbe cured by future action.\r\n\r\nThe government of the city of New Orleans, although administered by\r\ncitizens, derives its authority from military orders, and its offices\r\nhave always been under the supervision and control of the commander of the\r\ndepartment, or of the military governor of the State. The present mayor\r\nwas appointed by Major General Hurlbut, removed by Major General Banks,\r\nand reinstated by myself. Under the constitution and laws of the State\r\nthe principal city offices are elective, but the time has not yet been\r\nreached when an election for these offices should be held. Although\r\nstanding in very different relations from the State government, I have\r\nthought it proper to apply the same rule, and have not interfered with\r\nits administration except so far as might be necessary to protect the\r\ninterests of the government, or to prevent the appointment to offices of\r\npersons excepted by the President's proclamation.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nED. R.S. CANBY,\r\n_Major General, Commanding_.\r\n\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ\r\n_United States Volunteers, New Orleans_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 9.\r\n\r\n_STATEMENT OF GENERAL THOMAS KILBY SMITH_.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans, _September_ 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nI have been in command of the southern district of Alabama since the\r\ncommencement of General Canby's expedition against Mobile, and have been\r\nin command of the district and post of Mobile, with headquarters at\r\nMobile, from June until the 25th of August, and relinquished command of\r\nthe post on September 4. During my sojourn I have become familiar with the\r\ncharacter and temper of the people of all of southern Alabama.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that with the exception of a small minority, the people\r\nof Mobile and southern Alabama are disloyal in their sentiments and\r\nhostile to what they call the United States, and that a great many of them\r\nare still inspired with a hope that at some future time the \"confederacy,\"\r\nas they style it, will be restored to independence.\r\n\r\nIn corroboration of this assertion, I might state that in conversation\r\nwith me Bishop Wilmer, of the diocese of Alabama, (Episcopal), stated that\r\nto be his belief; that when I urged upon him the propriety of restoring to\r\nthe litany of his church that prayer which includes the prayer for the\r\nPresident of the United States, the whole of which he had ordered his\r\nrectors to expunge, he refused, first, upon the ground that he could not\r\npray for a continuance of martial law; and secondly, that he would\r\nstultify himself in the event of Alabama and the southern confederacy\r\nregaining their independence. This was on the 17th of June. This man\r\nexercises a widespread influence in the State, and his sentiments are\r\nthose of a large proportion of what is called the better class of people,\r\nand particularly the women. Hence the representatives of the United States\r\nflag are barely tolerated. They are not welcome among the people in any\r\nclasses of society. There is always a smothered hatred of the uniform and\r\nthe flag. Nor is this confined to the military, but extends to all classes\r\nwho, representing northern interests, seek advancement in trade, commerce,\r\nand the liberal professions, or who, coming from the North, propose to\r\nlocate in the South.\r\n\r\nThe men who compose the convention do, in my opinion, not represent the\r\npeople of Alabama, because the people had no voice in their election.\r\nI speak with assurance on this subject, because I have witnessed the\r\nproceedings in my district. I do not desire to reflect upon the personnel\r\nof the delegation from Mobile, which is composed of clever and honorable\r\nmen, but whatever may be their political course, they will not act as the\r\ntrue representatives of the sentiments and feelings of the people.\r\n\r\nI desire in this connexion to refer to the statements of Captain Poillon,\r\nwhich you have submitted to me, and to indorse the entire truthfulness\r\nthereof. I have known Captain Poillon intimately, and have been intimately\r\nacquainted with the proceedings of the Freedmen's Bureau. Many of the\r\nfacts stated by Captain Poillon I know of my own personal knowledge, and\r\nall I have examined into and believe.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July I permitted in Mobile a procession of the freedmen,\r\nthe only class of people in Mobile who craved of me the privilege of\r\ncelebrating the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Six\r\nthousand well-dressed and orderly colored people, escorted by two\r\nregiments of colored troops, paraded the streets, assembled in the public\r\nsquares, and were addressed in patriotic speeches by orators of their own\r\nrace and color. These orators counselled them to labor and to wait. This\r\nprocession and these orations were the signal for a storm of abuse upon\r\nthe military and the freedmen and their friends, fulminated from the\r\nstreet corners by the then mayor of the city and his common council and in\r\nthe daily newspapers, and was the signal for the hirelings of the former\r\nslave power to hound down, persecute, and destroy the industrious and\r\ninoffensive negro. These men were found for the most part in the police of\r\nthe city, acting under the direction of the mayor, R.H. Hough, since\r\nremoved. The enormities committed by these policemen were fearful. Within\r\nmy own knowledge colored girls seized upon the streets had to take their\r\nchoice between submitting to outrage on the part of the policemen or\r\nincarceration in the guard-house. These men, having mostly been negro\r\ndrivers and professional negro whippers, were fitting tools for the work\r\nin hand. Threats of and attempts at assassination were made against\r\nmyself. Threats were made to destroy all school-houses in which colored\r\nchildren were taught, and in two instances they were fired. The same\r\nthreats were made against all churches in which colored people assembled\r\nto worship, and one of them burned. Continued threats of assassination\r\nwere made against the colored preachers, and one of them is now under\r\nspecial guard by order of Major General Wood. When Mayor Hough was\r\nappealed to by this man for protection, he was heard to say that no one\r\nconnected with the procession of the 4th of July need to come into his\r\ncourt, and that their complaints would not be considered. Although Mayor\r\nHough has been removed, a large majority of these policemen are still in\r\noffice. Mayor Forsyth has promised to reform this matter. It is proper to\r\nstate that he was put in office by order of Governor Parsons, having twice\r\nbeen beaten at popular elections for the mayoralty by Mr. Hough. This\r\ngives an indication of what will result when the office will again be\r\nfilled by a popular election.\r\n\r\nThe freedmen and colored people of Mobile are, as a general thing,\r\norderly, quiet, industrious, and well dressed, with an earnest desire to\r\nlearn and to fit themselves for their new status. My last report from the\r\nschool commissioners of the colored schools of Mobile, made on the 28th of\r\nJuly, showed 986 pupils in daily attendance. They give no cause for the\r\nwholesale charges made against them of insurrection, lawlessness, and\r\nhostility against their former masters or the whites generally. On the\r\ncontrary, they are perfectly docile and amenable to the laws, and their\r\nleaders and popular teachers of their own color continually counsel them\r\nto industry and effort to secure their living in an honorable way. They\r\nhad collected from themselves up to the 1st of August upwards of $5,000\r\nfor their own eleemosynary institutions, and I know of many noble\r\ninstances where the former slave has devoted the proceeds of his own\r\nindustry to the maintenance of his former master or mistress in distress.\r\nYet, in the face of these facts, one of the most intelligent and high-bred\r\nladies of Mobile, having had silver plate stolen from her more than two\r\nyears ago, and having, upon affidavit, secured the incarceration of two\r\nof her former slaves whom she suspected of the theft, came to me in my\r\nofficial capacity, and asked my order to have them whipped and tortured\r\ninto a confession of the crime charged and the participants in it. This\r\nlady was surprised when I informed her that the days of the rack and the\r\nthumbscrew were passed, and, though pious, well bred, and a member of\r\nthe church, thought it a hardship that a negro might not be whipped or\r\ntortured till he would confess what he _might_ know about a robbery,\r\nalthough not even a _prima facie_ case existed against him, or that sort\r\nof evidence that would induce a grand jury to indict. I offer this as an\r\ninstance of the feeling that exists in all classes against the negro, and\r\ntheir inability to realize that he is a free man and entitled to the\r\nrights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nWith regard to municipal law in the State of Alabama, its administration\r\nis a farce. The ministers of the law themselves are too often desperadoes\r\nand engaged in the perpetration of the very crime they are sent forth to\r\nprohibit or to punish. Without the aid of the bayonets of the United\r\nStates Alabama is an anarchy. The best men of Alabama have either shed\r\ntheir blood in the late war, emigrated, or become wholly incapacitated by\r\ntheir former action from now taking part in the government of the State.\r\nThe more sensible portion of the people tremble at the idea of the\r\nmilitary force being eliminated, for, whatever may be their hatred of\r\nthe United States soldier, in him they find their safety.\r\n\r\nIt has not been my lot to command to any great extent colored troops. I\r\nhave had ample opportunity, however, of observing them in Tennessee,\r\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, and, comparing them with white\r\ntroops, I unhesitatingly say that they make as good soldiers. The two\r\ncolored regiments under my command in Mobile were noted for their\r\ndiscipline and perfection of drill, and between those troops and the\r\ncitizens of Mobile no trouble arose until after the proclamation of the\r\nprovisional governor, when it became necessary to arm them going to and\r\nfrom their fatigue duty, because they were hustled from the sidewalk by\r\ninfuriated citizens, who, carrying out the principles enunciated by Mayor\r\nHough and the common council and the newspapers heretofore alluded to,\r\nsought to incite mob. I have said that a great deal of the trouble alluded\r\nto in the government of the State has arisen since the appointment and\r\nproclamation of the provisional governor. The people of Alabama then\r\nbelieved they were relieved from coercion of the United States and\r\nrestored to State government, and that having rid themselves of the\r\nbayonets, they might assume the reins, which they attempted to do in the\r\nmanner above described. When I speak of the people I mean the masses,\r\nthose that we call the populace. There are thinking, intelligent men in\r\nAlabama, as elsewhere, who understand and appreciate the true condition of\r\naffairs. But these men, for the most part, are timid and retiring,\r\nunwilling to take the lead, and even when subjected to outrage, robbery,\r\nand pillage by their fellow-citizens, refrain from testifying, and prefer\r\nto put up with the indignity rather than incur an unpopularity that may\r\ncost their lives. Hence there is danger of the mob spirit running riot and\r\nrampant through the land, only kept under by our forces.\r\n\r\nThat there are organized bands throughout the country who, as guerillas or\r\nbanditti, now still keep up their organization, with a view to further\r\ntroubles in a larger arena, I have no doubt, though, of course, I have no\r\npositive testimony. But this I know, that agents in Mobile have been\r\nemployed to transmit ammunition in large packages to the interior. One man\r\nby the name of Dieterich is now incarcerated in the military prison at\r\nMobile charged with this offence. A detective was sent to purchase powder\r\nof him, who represented himself to be a guerilla, and that he proposed to\r\ntake it out to his band. He bought $25 worth the first, and $25 worth the\r\nsecond day, and made a contract for larger quantities. Deputations of\r\ncitizens waited upon me from time to time to advise me that these bands\r\nwere in being, and that they were in imminent peril upon their avowing\r\ntheir intentions to take the oath of allegiance, or evincing in any other\r\nway their loyalty to the government; and yet these men, while they claimed\r\nthe protection of the military, were unwilling to reveal the names of the\r\nconspirators. I have seen General Wood's statement, which is true in all\r\nparticulars so far as my own observation goes, and I have had even far\r\nbetter opportunities than General Wood of knowing the character of the\r\npeople he now protects, and while protecting, is ignored socially and\r\ndamned politically; for it is a noticeable fact that, after a sojourn in\r\nMobile of upwards of six weeks in command of the State, during part of\r\nwhich time he was ill and suffering, he received but one call socially out\r\nof a community heretofore considered one of the most opulent, refined, and\r\nhospitable of all the maritime cities of the South, the favorite home of\r\nthe officers of the army and the navy in by-gone days; and that one call\r\nfrom General Longstreet, who was simply in transitu.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS KILBY SMITH,\r\n_Brigadier General United States Volunteers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 10.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\r\n_Jackson, Mississippi, August_ 27, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: The northern district of Mississippi embraces that portion of the\r\nState north of southern boundary lines of Clark, Jasper, Smith, Simpson,\r\nand Hinds counties, except the six counties (Warren, Yazoo, Issaquena,\r\nWashington, Sunflower, and Bolivar) constituting the western district.\r\n\r\nThe entire railroad system of the State is within my district, and\r\nalthough these lines of communication were seriously injured during the\r\nwar, steps are being taken everywhere to repair them as fast as means can\r\nbe procured. The break of thirty-five miles on the Southern (Vicksburg\r\nMendrain) railroad, between Big Black and Jackson, is, by authority of the\r\ndepartment commander, being repaired by my troops, and will be ready for\r\noperation in a few days.\r\n\r\nThe thirty-six counties under my military control constitute the richest\r\nportion of the State, the soil being the most available for agricultural\r\npurposes, cotton (Upland) being the great staple, while in the eastern\r\ncounties, in the valley of the upper Tombigbee, corn was grown very\r\nextensively, the largest proportion of the usual demand in the State for\r\nthis cereal being supplied from that section.\r\n\r\nThe war and its consequences have laid waste nearly all the old fields,\r\nonly a few acres were cultivated this year to raise sufficient corn for\r\nthe immediate use of the respective families and the small amount of stock\r\nthey succeeded in retaining after the many raids and campaigns which took\r\nplace in the State of Mississippi. Even these attempts will only prove\r\npartially successful, for, although the final suppression of the rebellion\r\nwas evident for the past two years, the collapse which followed the\r\nsurrender of the rebel armies brought with it all the consequences of an\r\nunforeseen surprise. The people had in no way provided for this\r\ncontingency, and of course became very restive, when all property which\r\nthey had so long been accustomed to look upon as their own suddenly\r\nassumed a doubtful character. Their \"slaves\" began to wander off and left\r\ntheir masters, and those growing crops, which could only be matured and\r\ngathered by the labor of the former slaves. For the first time the people\r\nsaw and appreciated the extreme poverty into which they were thrown by the\r\nconsequences of the rebellion, and it will hardly surprise any one\r\nfamiliar with human nature, that people in good standing before the war\r\nshould resort to all kinds of schemes, even disresputable ones, to retrieve\r\ntheir broken fortunes.\r\n\r\nTheft and every species of crime became matters of every-day occurrence.\r\nThe large amount of government cotton in all parts of the State proved a\r\nwelcome objective point for every description of lawlessness. Absent\r\nowners of cotton were looked upon by these people as public enemies and\r\nbecame the victims of their (mostly illegal) speculations during the\r\nrebellion. This state of affairs continued for some time in all portions\r\nof the district not occupied by United States troops, and were in most\r\ninstances accompanied by outrages and even murder perpetrated on the\r\npersons of the late \"slaves.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as a sufficient number of troops could be brought into the\r\ndistrict, I placed garrisons at such points as would, as far as my means\r\npermitted, give me control of almost every county. By the adoption of this\r\nsystem I succeeded in preventing this wholesale system of thieving, and a\r\nportion of the stolen goods was recovered and returned to the owners,\r\nwhile the outrages on negroes and Union men sensibly diminished.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the occupation until a recent period only five (5)\r\ncases of murder or attempted murder occurred in my whole district, and I\r\nhad no apprehension but what I would be able to stop the recurrence of\r\nsuch crimes effectually. The troops at my disposal were, however, sadly\r\nreduced by the recent muster-out of cavalry and infantry regiments.\r\n\r\nAttala and Holmes counties were, on my arrival, the theatre of the\r\ngreatest outrages; the interior of these counties was garrisoned by\r\ncavalry detachments, which communicated with the infantry posts along the\r\nrailroad, and they (the cavalry) were most effective in preventing crime\r\nand arresting malefactors, thus affording the much needed protection to\r\npeaceable inhabitants. The cavalry garrisons, however, were withdrawn\r\nabout two (2) weeks ago for muster-out, and since that time four (4)\r\nmurders, two of white Union men and two of negroes, have been reported to\r\nme from Attala county. The infantry garrisons along the railroad are\r\nactively endeavoring to effect the arrest of the suspected parties, but\r\nthe chances of success are exceedingly doubtful, as only mounted troops\r\ncan be successfully used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that the state of affairs would be intolerable\r\nfor all Union men, all recent immigrants from the north; and all negroes,\r\nthe moment the protection of the United States troops was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn support of this opinion permit me to make a few remarks about the\r\ncitizens. Although the people, as a general thing, are very anxious for\r\npeace, and for the restoration of law and order, they hardly realize the\r\ngreat social change brought about by the war. They all know that slavery,\r\nin the form in which it existed before the war, and in which they idolized\r\nit, is at an end; but these former slave owners are very loth to realize\r\nthe new relative positions of employer and employee, and all kinds of plans\r\nfor \"new systems of labor\" are under constant discussion. The principal\r\nfeature of all plans proposed is that the labor of the nominally freedmen\r\nshould be secured to their old masters without risk of interruption or\r\nchange. This desire is very natural in an agricultural community, which\r\nhas been left for generations in the undisturbed enjoyment of all the\r\ncomforts and independent luxuries induced by a system where the laborer\r\nand not the labor was a marketable commodity. It is, however, just as\r\nnatural that those most interested should differ essentially with the\r\nslaveholder on that point. They naturally claim that they (the laborers)\r\nhave by the war and its consequences gained the right to hire out their\r\nlabor to whomsoever they please, and to change their relations so as to\r\ninsure for themselves the best possible remuneration. The defenders and\r\nprotectors of this last position are principally the agents of the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau and the co-operating military forces, and of course they\r\nare not liked. Their decisions and rules are looked upon by former\r\nslaveholders, and late rebels generally, as the commands of a usurper and\r\na tyrant, and they will continue to be so regarded until a general\r\nresumption of agricultural pursuits shall have brought about a practical\r\nsolution o this much vexed question, which, \"in abstracts,\" is rather\r\nperplexing. I think that if each party is compelled to remain within the\r\nbounds of justice and equity by the presence of a neutral force, _i.e._\r\nUnited States troops, one year's experience will assign to both employers\r\nand employees their respective relative positions.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this most desirable end is attained, and the labor of the\r\nsouthern States regenerated on a real free labor basis, and thus brought\r\ninto harmony with the other portions of the Union, the exclusive and\r\npeculiar notions of the southern gentlemen, so much at variance with the\r\nviews of the North, will have no longer any cause to exist, and the\r\nsouthern people will be glad to recognize the American nationality without\r\nreserve, and without the sectional limitation of geographical linos.\r\n\r\nI desire to affirm that loyalty and patriotism have not as yet gained any\r\nsolid foundation among the white population of the States, and such cannot\r\nbe expected until the relations between employers and laborers have become\r\na fixed and acknowledged fact; then, and not before, will a feeling of\r\ncontentment and loyalty replace the now prevalent bitterness and\r\nrecriminations.\r\n\r\nThe taking of the amnesty oath has not changed the late rebels (and there\r\nare hardly any white people here who have not been rebels) into loyal\r\ncitizens. It was considered and looked upon as an act of expediency and\r\nnecessity to enable them to build their shattered and broken fortunes up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe elevating feeling of true patriotism will return with the smile of\r\nprosperity, and it should be the duty of all men to co-operate together in\r\nsecuring that end. This can only be done by securing for the black race\r\nalso a state of prosperity. This race, which at present furnishes the only\r\nlabor in the State, must be prevented from becoming a wandering and\r\nrestless people, and they must be taught to become steady citizens. This\r\nwill best be accomplished by guaranteeing them the right to acquire\r\nproperty and to become freeholders, with protection in the undisturbed\r\npossession of their property. This and a general system of education will\r\nwork a quicker and more satisfactory change than the most stringent police\r\nregulations could ever achieve.\r\n\r\nAt present the occupancy of the State by the United States troops is the\r\nonly safeguard for the preservation of peace between the different\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nI am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nP. JOS. OSTERHAUS,\r\n_Major General U.S. Vols_.\r\n\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ, _Present_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 11.\r\n\r\n_STATEMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL CHARLES R. WOODS, COMMANDING DEPARTMENT OF\r\nALABAMA_.\r\n\r\nMobile, Ala., _September_ 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nI do not interfere with civil affairs at all, unless called upon by the\r\ngovernor of the State to assist the civil authorities. There are troops\r\nwithin reach of every county ready to respond to the call of the civil\r\nauthorities, but there are some counties where the sheriffs and other\r\nofficers of the law appear to be afraid to execute their warrants, even\r\nwith the aid of my troops, because the protection the troops might give\r\nthem is liable to be withdrawn as soon as the duties for which they are\r\ncalled upon are fulfilled, although the troops are continually ready to\r\naid them at short notice.\r\n\r\nIn many of the counties, where there are no garrisons stationed, the civil\r\nauthorities are unable or unwilling to carry out the laws. One case has\r\ncome to my official notice where persons had been arrested on the\r\ncomplaint of citizens living in the country, for stealing, marauding, &c.,\r\nbut when called upon to come down to testify, the complainants declared\r\nthat they did not know anything about the matter. There being no\r\ntestimony, the accused parties had to be released. One of those who, by\r\nthe offenders, was supposed to have made complaint, was, shortly after the\r\nrelease of the accused, found with his throat cut. It appears that in that\r\nlocality the lawless element predominates, and keeps the rest of the\r\ncommunity in fear of having their houses burnt, and of losing their lives.\r\nThe case mentioned happened in Washington county, about forty miles from\r\nthis city, up the Alabama river. There is a garrison of four companies at\r\nMount Vernon arsenal, not far from that place, which at all times are\r\nready to render aid to the civil authorities.\r\n\r\nI have sent a detachment of troops with an officer of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau into Clark, Washington, Choctaw, and Marengo counties to\r\ninvestigate the reports of harsh treatment of the negroes that had come\r\ninto the Freedmen's Bureau.\r\n\r\nCotton-stealing is going on quite generally, and on a large scale,\r\nwherever there is any cotton, and the civil authorities have completely\r\nfailed in stopping it. It has been reported to me by citizens that armed\r\nbands attack and drive away the watchmen, load the cotton upon wagons, and\r\nthus haul it away. No case has come to my knowledge in which such\r\noffenders have been brought to punishment. Horse, mule, and cattle\r\nstealing is likewise going on on a large scale.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with instructions from General Thomas, I have issued orders\r\nto arrest, and try by military commission, all citizens who are charged\r\nwith stealing government horses, mules, or other property. No such cases\r\nhad been taken cognizance of by civil authorities within my knowledge.\r\n\r\nAs to the treatment of negroes by whites, I would refer to the reports of\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau.\r\n\r\nI sent out officers to every point in the State designated by the\r\ngovernor, on an average at least two officers to a county, for the purpose\r\nof administering the amnesty oath, but owing to a misapprehension on the\r\npart of the people, but few were taken before these officers until the\r\ngovernor's second proclamation came out, requiring them to do so, when the\r\noath was administered to a great many.\r\n\r\nI have found myself compelled to give one of the papers appearing in this\r\ncity (the Mobile Daily News) a warning, on account of its publishing\r\nsensational articles about impending negro insurrections, believing that\r\nthey are gotten up without any foundation at all, for the purpose of\r\nkeeping up an excitement.\r\n\r\nCHAS. R. WOODS,\r\n_Brevet Major General, Commanding Department of Alabama_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 12.\r\n\r\n[General Orders No. 22.]\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\r\n_Vicksburg, Miss., August_ 24, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe attention of district commanders is called to a proclamation of the\r\nprovisional governor of the State of Mississippi, of the 19th instant,\r\nwhich provides for the organization of a military force in each county of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nWhile the general government deems it necessary to maintain its authority\r\nhere by armed forces, it is important that the powers and duties of the\r\nofficers commanding should be clearly defined.\r\n\r\nThe State of Mississippi was one of the first that engaged in the recent\r\nrebellion. For more than four years all her energies have been devoted to\r\na war upon our government. At length, from exhaustion, she has been\r\ncompelled to lay down her arms; but no orders have as yet been received by\r\nthe military authorities on duty here, indicating that the State has been\r\nrelieved from the hostile position which she voluntarily assumed towards\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe general government, earnestly desiring to restore the State to its\r\nformer position, has appointed a provisional governor, with power to call\r\na convention for the accomplishment of that purpose. Upon the military\r\nforces devolve the duties of preserving order, and of executing the laws\r\nof Congress and the orders of the War Department. The orders defining the\r\nrights and privileges to be secured to freedmen meet with opposition in\r\nmany parts of the State, and the duties devolving upon military officers,\r\nin the execution of these orders, are often of a delicate nature. It has\r\ncertainly been the desire of the department commander, and, so far as he\r\nhas observed, of all officers on duty in the State, to execute these\r\norders in a spirit of conciliation and forbearance, and, while obeying\r\nimplicitly all instructions of the President and the War Department, to\r\nmake military rule as little odious as possible to the people. While the\r\nmilitary authorities have acted in this spirit, and have been as\r\nsuccessful as could have been anticipated, the provisional governor has\r\nthought proper, without consultation with the department commander or with\r\nany other officer of the United States on duty here, to organize and arm a\r\nforce in every county, urging the \"young men of the State who have so\r\ndistinguished themselves for gallantry\" to respond promptly to his call,\r\nmeaning, thereby, that class of men who have as yet scarcely laid down the\r\narms with which they have been opposing our government. Such force, if\r\norganized as proposed, is to be independent of the military authority now\r\npresent, and superior in strength to the United States forces on duty in\r\nthe State. To permit the young men, who have so distinguished themselves,\r\nto be armed and organized independently of United States military officers\r\non duty here, and to allow them to operate in counties now garrisoned by\r\ncolored troops, filled, as many of these men are, not only with prejudice\r\nagainst those troops and against the execution of the orders relative to\r\nfreedmen, but even against our government itself, would bring about a\r\ncollision at once, and increase in a ten-fold degree the difficulties that\r\nnow beset the people. It is to be hoped that the day will soon come when\r\nthe young men called upon by Governor Sharkey and the colored men now\r\nserving the United States will zealously co-operate for the preservation\r\nof order and the promotion of the interests of the State and nation. It\r\nwill be gratifying to the friends of the colored race to have the\r\nassurance in an official proclamation from the provisional governor, that\r\nthe day has already arrived when the experiment can be safely attempted.\r\nBut as the questions on which these two classes will be called to\r\nco-operate are those with regard to which there would undoubtedly be some\r\ndifference of opinion, particularly as to the construction of certain laws\r\nrelative to freedmen, the commanding general prefers to postpone the trial\r\nfor the present. It is the earnest desire of all military officers, as it\r\nmust be of every good citizen, to hasten the day when the troops can with\r\nsafety be withdrawn from this State, and the people be left to execute\r\ntheir own laws, but this will not be hastened by arming at this time the\r\nyoung men of the State.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of the provisional governor is based on the supposed\r\nnecessity of increasing the military forces in the State to prevent the\r\ncommission of crime by bad men. It is a remarkable fact that most of the\r\noutrages have been committed against northern men, government couriers,\r\nand colored people. Southern citizens have been halted by these outlaws,\r\nbut at once released and informed that they had been stopped by mistake;\r\nand these citizens have refused to give information as to the parties by\r\nwhom they were halted, although frankly acknowledging that they knew them.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sharkey, in a communication written after his call for the\r\norganization of militia forces was made, setting forth the necessity for\r\nsuch organization, states that the people are unwilling to give\r\ninformation to the United States military authorities which will lead to\r\nthe detection of these outlaws, and suggests as a remedy for these evils\r\nthe arming of the very people who refuse to give such information.\r\n\r\nA better plan will be to disarm all such citizens, and make it for their\r\ninterest to aid those who have been sent here to restore order and\r\npreserve peace.\r\n\r\n_It is therefore ordered_, that district commanders give notice at once to\r\nall persons within their respective districts that no military\r\norganizations, except those under the control of the United States\r\nauthorities, will be permitted within their respective commands, and that\r\nif any attempt is made to organize after such notice, those engaged in it\r\nwill be arrested. Whenever any outrages are committed upon either citizens\r\nor soldiers, the commander of the post nearest the point at which the\r\noffence is committed will report the fact at once to the district\r\ncommander, who will forthwith send as strong a force to the locality as\r\ncan be spared. The officer in command of such force will at once disarm\r\nevery citizen within ten miles of the place where the offence was\r\ncommitted. If any citizen, possessing information which would lead to the\r\ncapture of the outlaws, refuses to impart the same, he will be arrested\r\nand held for trial. The troops will be quartered on his premises, and he\r\nbe compelled to provide for the support of men and animals. These villains\r\ncan be arrested, unless they receive encouragement from some portion of\r\nthe community in which they operate; and such communities must be held\r\nresponsible for their acts, and must be made to realize the inevitable\r\nconsequences of countenancing such outrages.\r\n\r\nBy order of Major General SLOCUM:\r\n\r\nJ.

Sylvanus Evans and Richard Cooper, candidates for\r\nCongress and attorney general, Vicksburg, September_ 19, 1865.\r\n\r\nPursuant to a call published in our yesterday's issue, a large number of\r\ncitizens assembled at Apollo Hall last evening to listen to addresses from\r\nprominent candidates for office at the ensuing election.\r\n\r\nShortly after 8 o'clock Hon. A. Burwell introduced Hon. Richard Cooper to\r\nthe meeting, who addressed them as follows:\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF MR. COOPER.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens: I present myself before you to-night as a candidate for\r\nthe office of attorney general. I have not before spoken in public since\r\nannouncing myself, relying wholly upon my friends and past record. I have\r\nresided in this State twenty-nine years, and have for twelve years been a\r\nprosecuting attorney.\r\n\r\nSoon after announcing myself I found I had an opponent, and I concluded to\r\naccompany my friend, Judge Evans, to Vicksburg, merely to make myself\r\nknown, not intending to make a speech.\r\n\r\nI was born in Georgia. The first vote I ever cast was with the old-line\r\nWhig party. [Applause.] In 1850 I opposed an attempt to break up the\r\nUnited States government, and in, 1860 I did the same thing. I travelled\r\nin Alabama and Mississippi to oppose the measure. [Applause.] But after\r\nthe State did secede I did all in my power to sustain it. [Heavy\r\napplause.] I never entered the army, having held a civil office, and was\r\nadvised by my friends that I could do more good in that way than by\r\nentering the service. I believed in secession while it lasted, but am now\r\nas good a Union man as exists, and am in favor of breaking down old\r\nbarriers, and making harmony and peace prevail.\r\n\r\nI was a delegate to the State convention lately in session at Jackson, and\r\nhope the legislature will carry out the suggestions of the convention. I\r\nbelieve the negro is entitled to the claims of a freeman, now that he is\r\nmade free, and I hope he will have them secured to him. I am thankful that\r\nMississippi has the right of jurisdiction, and I hope she will always have\r\nit. The office I am a candidate for is not a political, but strictly a\r\njudicial office. If elected I shall use my utmost endeavors to promote the\r\ninterests of the State and country.\r\n\r\nHon. Sylvanus Evans was then introduced to the audience by Mr. Cooper, who\r\nspoke substantially as follows:\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF JUDGE EVANS.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS OF WARREN COUNTY: I am grateful to meet you here this\r\nevening, although a stranger to most of you. Here you must judge of my\r\nstanding, and I hope you will pardon me while I attempt to explain my\r\nposition to you. I came to Mississippi in 1837, and moved to Lauderdale\r\ncounty in 1839; by profession, in early life, a blacksmith, latterly a\r\nlawyer, practicing in eastern Mississippi; to some extent a politician,\r\nalways believing in the policy of the old-line Whigs, and always acting\r\nwith them. In 1851 I was a delegate from Lauderdale county to the State\r\nconvention, then, as in 1860, being opposed to the act of secession, and\r\nfought against it with all my powers. But after the State had seceded I\r\nwent with it as a matter of duty, and I sustained it until the day of the\r\nsurrender with all my body and heart and mind. [Great applause.] I\r\nbelieved that the majority of the people did not know what was to come,\r\nbut, blending their interests with mine, I could not, with honor, keep\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nWe are now emerging; now daylight is dawning upon us. But whether peace\r\nand prosperity shall return in its fulness is now a question with the\r\npeople. I am a candidate before you for the United States Congress. Let me\r\nsay to you, as wise men, that unless the people and the legislature do\r\ntheir duty, it is useless to send me or any one else to Washington, as we\r\ncannot there obtain seats in Congress.\r\n\r\nMy opponent, Mr. West, was nominated at Jackson by a lot of unauthorized\r\ndelegates, which nomination was, in my judgment, of no account. Were your\r\ndelegates from this county authorized to nominate candidates for Congress?\r\nOurs were not. I am before the people at the urgent request of many\r\nfriends; not by any nomination made at Jackson.\r\n\r\nI heartily approve of the action of the convention. But this action will\r\nbe useless unless the legislature you elect meet and build the structure\r\nupon the foundation laid by the convention. The convention did not abolish\r\nslavery. The result of four and a half years of struggle determined\r\nwhether it was abolished by the bayonet or by legislation. It remains for\r\nyou to show by your action whether this was done to rid the State of\r\nbayonets, or to obtain your representation in Washington. It is not enough\r\nto say the negro is free. The convention requires the legislature to adopt\r\nsuch laws as will protect the negro in his rights of person and property.\r\n\r\nWe are not willing that the negro shall testify in our courts. We all\r\nrevolt at it, and it is natural that we should do so; but we must allow it\r\nas one of the requisites of our admission to our original standing in the\r\nUnion. To-day the negro is as competent a witness in our State as the\r\nwhite man, made so by the action of the convention. The credibility of the\r\nwitness is to be determined by the jurors and justices. If you refuse his\r\ntestimony, as is being done, the result will be the military courts and\r\nFreedmen's Bureau will take it up, and jurisdiction is lost, and those who\r\nbest know the negro will be denied the privilege of passing judgment upon\r\nit, and those who know him least are often more in favor of his testimony\r\nthan yours. I am opposed to negro testimony, but by the constitution it is\r\nadmitted. (The speaker was here interrupted by an inquiry by one of the\r\naudience: \"Has this constitution been ratified by the people, and has the\r\nold constitution been abolished?\" To which Mr. Evans replied: The people\r\ndid not have an opportunity to ratify it. The convention did not see fit\r\nto submit it to them, and its action in the matter is final.)\r\n\r\nSlavery was destroyed eternally before the convention met, by the last\r\nfour years of struggle. The convention only indorsed it, because it could\r\ndo nothing else. I consider that convention the most important ever held\r\non this continent--the determination of the war pending upon its action,\r\nand its great influence upon our southern sister States. The unanimity of\r\nthe convention was unparalleled: the result of which has met with\r\nuniversal approval.\r\n\r\nThe only objectors to its action is the radicalism of the north, which\r\nthinks it should have conferred universal suffrage on the freedmen.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to send any one to Washington to gain admission to the\r\nCongress of the United States unless the legislature carries out the\r\ndictations of the convention for the protection of the freedmen's rights\r\nand property, and let them have access to the courts of justice.\r\n\r\nDo you not desire to get rid of the Freedmen's Bureau and the bayonets and\r\nmeet the President half way in his policy of reconstruction? If you do, be\r\ncareful and send men to the legislature who will carry out this point, and\r\nthereby enable your congressmen to obtain their seats, and not have to\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe speaker was here again interrupted by Mr. John Vallandigham, who\r\nwished to inform the gentleman and all present that there were no\r\nsecessionists now.\r\n\r\n(The speaker requested not to be interrupted again.) [Great applause.] I\r\nam no demagogue. Supposing you fail to meet the President in his policy,\r\nwhat will be the result? The convention has done its duty. It remains for\r\nyou to elect men to the next legislature who will secure to the freedman\r\nhis right. There are large republican majorities in the United States\r\nCongress. The northern press, denouncing the President's policy, are\r\nassuming that Congress has the right to dictate to you who shall be your\r\nrulers. The result of the large majorities will be to give the right of\r\nsuffrage to every man in the State, and the negroes will elect officers to\r\ngovern you.\r\n\r\nThe President and the conservative element of the north are determined\r\nthat the negro shall be placed where nature places him, in spite of the\r\nfanatics.\r\n\r\nWe can only make free labor profitable by giving the negro justice and a\r\nright at the courts.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to accept the fact that our slaves stand as freedmen, and that\r\nwe have no more right to direct them. It is hard to realize, but let us\r\nlook at it as it is, and act accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour country is laid desolate, your farms have been ravished and\r\nimpoverished by the war. Vicksburg, the city of hills, everywhere bears\r\nmarks of war. The Mississippi valley is desolate. You have been deprived\r\nof your property in the negro, your houses burned and destroyed.\r\n\r\nWe can meet the President and the conservative element of the north by a\r\nsimple act of legislation, and it becomes us as a country-loving people to\r\nlook well to the candidates for the legislature. If they fail to take the\r\nnecessary step, the result will be that the Freedmen's Bureau and bayonets\r\nwill remain with us until they do.\r\n\r\nAlthough somewhat ignorant of the proceeding of the federal Congress, if\r\nelected I shall try to promote the especial interests of this State. I\r\nshall urge that the United States government owe it as a duty to the State\r\nof Mississippi to repair her levees; her people are so impoverished by the\r\nwar that they cannot stand the taxation necessary to rebuild them. I\r\nbelieve it to be the duty of the general government to appropriate money\r\nto assist the people to improve their railroads, rivers, and assist in\r\nlike new enterprises.\r\n\r\nAnother important question, that of labor, I believe can only be settled\r\nby legislation. I believe it to be for the interests of the people of the\r\nsouth to have the vagrant freedmen removed, as they are the cause of\r\ncontinued strife and tumult.\r\n\r\nI am sure we do not want the scenes of St. Domingo and Hayti repeated in\r\nour midst. I believe such will be the case if they are not removed. If\r\nelected, I shall urge upon the general government the duty of colonizing\r\nthe negroes; it being the duty of the government to do this, as we are\r\ndeprived of that amount of property, and the negroes should be removed\r\nwhere they can be distinct and by themselves. It is impossible for the two\r\nclasses to exist equal together, for we would always be liable to\r\noutbreaks and bloodshed. We must either educate them or abolish them, for\r\nthey know but little more now than to lie all day in the sun and think\r\nsome one will look out for them. Though free, they cannot yet understand\r\nwhat freedom is, and in many cases it is an injury rather than a benefit.\r\nIt would be better to have white labor than to try and retain the black.\r\n\r\nAnother important point--a great debt has been contracted by the federal\r\ngovernment. The south cannot pay a proportion of that debt. I am opposed\r\nto repudiation, but am in favor of relieving the south of the internal\r\nrevenue tax.\r\n\r\nMy opponent, Mr. West, contends that Mississippi must pay her taxes up to\r\n1865. I do not think so; and this is the only issue between us. I deny\r\nthat the government has a right to levy such a tax, and contend that the\r\ngovernment cannot impose a tax upon a State unless that State participates\r\nin the accumulation of that debt. At the time this debt was contracted we\r\nwere recognized as belligerents, and not liable to a share of the debt\r\nthen contracted for. That back tax can only be collected by a special act\r\nof Congress, and, if elected, I shall oppose any such act.\r\n\r\nMr. West proposed an amendment in favor of secession into the State\r\nsenate, while I was opposed to it. I always contended that slavery would\r\ndie with secession, while Mr. West said it was the only remedy. But I do\r\nnot consider this any time to talk of secession, but rather bury all such\r\nin oblivion, and talk of the best way to restore peace.\r\n\r\nIn many instances those who opposed secession the most were the first to\r\nenter the army and fight most valiantly. (Applause.) I believe it to be\r\nour duty to forget all this and attend to present issues.\r\n\r\nIt is time the war was over, and it is time that the results of the war\r\nwere settled, and those are to be settled by the actions of the people\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nDetermine for yourselves whether or not the President does not offer terms\r\nthat should suit any of us; is he not trying to stay the tide of\r\nfanaticism at the north that would overwhelm us? Has he not shown it in\r\nour own State in the appointment of our military governor? No man in the\r\nState could have been appointed to give more general satisfaction than\r\nW.L. Sharkey, an able, straightforward, just man.\r\n\r\nThe President, in his speech to the southern delegation, assures them that\r\nhe is determined to stay the tremendous tide of the fanatics of the north,\r\nand that suffrage to the negro shall not be forced upon the people of the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nIf elected, I will heartily co-operate with the President in his policy of\r\nreconstruction, for I am bitterly opposed to conferring the right of\r\nsuffrage upon the negro. I believe it to be the right of the States to\r\nsettle that matter.\r\n\r\nThe radicals of the north now contend that they have a right to confer the\r\nright of suffrage on the negro, and we must at this hour support the\r\nPresident in approving that idea; if not, he will be overpowered, and that\r\nwill be the result.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if honored with an election I pledge myself to exert every\r\nenergy in my power in behalf of the State and district.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the remarks of Judge Evans, loud and repeated calls\r\nfor Colonel Patridge brought that gentleman to his feet. He was received\r\nwith much applause, which was somewhat protracted, showing the favor in\r\nwhich he was held by the audience. Upon rising and attempting to speak\r\nfrom his place on the floor, loud and urgent calls demanded that he should\r\ntake the stand. Colonel Patridge replied that he would not take the stand\r\nuntil he met his competitor there.\r\n\r\nREMARKS OF COLONEL PATRIDGE.\r\n\r\nHe said that as a public journalist he had gone in and out before this\r\npeople for many years. His views were as well known as those of any man\r\nwho ever approached the people, asking their suffrage. He was a union man\r\nbefore the war, and a soldier in the war. He had performed his duty as a\r\nprivate and an officer, on the battle field and on the staff. At the close\r\nof the struggle, terminating as it had in our overthrow, he had used his\r\nentire exertions to speedily restore Mississippi to her former relations\r\nwith the federal government. The convention had done this, in entire\r\naccordance with the views he had entertained, and if elected to the\r\nlegislature, he should finish the work in the same spirit, and carry out\r\nfully the policy of the convention.\r\n\r\nSo far as the question of admitting the testimony of negroes into our\r\ncourts was concerned, he expressed no opinion upon it, as a separate\r\nquestion. He had as many prejudices as other southern men. But in his\r\npublic acts he had always endeavored to discard prejudice. He looked to\r\nthe happiness and welfare of the people. But there was one phase of the\r\nnegro testimony question which was settled. The negro was already regarded\r\nas a competent witness. He alluded to the cases which, by an act of\r\nCongress, came under the jurisdiction of the Freedmen's Bureau. The\r\nquestion was not whether their testimony should be received or not. It was\r\nalready received. The question was whether, in receiving it, it shall be\r\nreceived before our own civil magistrates or juries, or before the provost\r\nmarshals of the Freedmen's Bureau. He had no hesitation in expressing\r\nhimself in favor of the former. He was opposed to all systems of\r\nrepudiation, whether styled stay laws, bankrupt laws, or insolvent acts,\r\nand in general was in favor of placing Mississippi in the front rank of\r\nStates. He desired to see our congressmen admitted at the next session,\r\nand to that end would do all in his power to promote the policy of\r\nPresident Johnson for the rehabilitation which it was understood was the\r\nultimatum. His remarks, which were exceedingly well received, were\r\ncontinued for fifteen or twenty minutes, at the close of which he\r\nannounced himself ready to meet his competitor, whom he spoke of in high\r\nterms, at any time to discuss the momentous issues devolving upon the next\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 15.\r\n\r\n_To the voters of the sixth judicial district, composed of the counties of\r\nLowndes, Oktibbeha, Noxubee, Neshoba, Kemper, and Winston_:\r\n\r\nUntil the spring of 1861 I was a citizen of Kentucky, but my native State\r\nhaving elected to abide by the fortunes of the Union in the tremendous\r\nstruggle that has lately terminated, while all my sympathies and instincts\r\nbound me to the southern people, I assumed new relations so far as\r\ncitizenship was concerned, and for the last three years have been a\r\nresident of Mississippi. I entered the army as a private soldier, and\r\nuntil the end of the conflict sustained, what I knew in the beginning to\r\nbe, a desperate and doubtful cause. I went down in battle, never to rise\r\nup again a sound man, upon the frontier of this broad abounding land of\r\nyours. I therefore cannot feel that I am an alien in your midst, and, with\r\nsomething of confidence as to the result, appeal to you for your suffrages\r\nfor the office of district attorney. I am as fully identified with the\r\ninterests of Mississippi as it is possible for any one to be, and in my\r\nhumble way, will strive as earnestly as any one to restore her lost\r\nfranchises and lost prosperity. In former years I held in Kentucky a\r\nposition similar to the one I now seek at your hands, and I hope that I\r\nviolate no rule of propriety in saying that I deem myself equal to its\r\nduties and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nRespectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJNO. T. HOGAN.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Owing to the fact that I have but little acquaintance with the\r\npeople of the sixth district, outside of the county of Lowndes, I will\r\naddress them at different points so soon as I can prepare and publish a\r\nlist of appointments.\r\n\r\nJ.T.H.\r\n\r\nColumbus, _Mississippi, August_ 26, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 16.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF LOUISIANA, OFFICE OF PROVOST MARSHAL GENERAL,\r\n\r\n_New Orleans, La., September_ 12, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: In the matter of the investigation ordered to be made in relation\r\nto the loyalty of certain members of the board of public schools of this\r\ncity, I have the honor to report as follows:\r\n\r\nThomas Sloo, in his capacity as president of the \"Sun Mutual Insurance\r\nCompany,\" subscribed fifty thousand dollars towards the confederate loan.\r\n\r\nJohn I. Adams, a prominent and influential merchant, left this city\r\nimmediately on the arrival of the federal forces, and did not return until\r\nthe final overthrow of the rebellion. He presented a piece of ordnance,\r\nmanufactured at his own expense, to the \"Washington Artillery,\" to be used\r\nagainst the government of the United States. He also was a subscriber to\r\nthe rebel loan.\r\n\r\nGlendy Burke and George Ruleff, the former at one time a prominent\r\npolitician, the latter a wealthy merchant, sent their sons into the\r\nconfederacy, while they remained at home, refusing to assist in any way in\r\nthe reorganization of the State government, and showing their contempt for\r\nthe United States government and its constituted authorities. Their\r\nconduct was far from being loyal and patriotic; associating only with the\r\navowed enemies of the government.\r\n\r\nEdwin L. Jewell, editor and proprietor of the \"Star\" newspaper, is not a\r\ncitizen of New Orleans. Previous to the rebellion he was a resident of the\r\nparish of Point Coupee, where he edited a newspaper, noted only for its\r\nbitter and violent opposition to the government and the strong and ardent\r\nmanner in which it enunciated the principles of secession. He has only\r\nlately arrived here, and has not resided in the city for a sufficient\r\nlength of time to entitle him to the rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nDavid McCoard is classed with those whose conduct throughout the war has\r\nbeen intent only in misrepresenting the government and treating its\r\nrepresentatives with contumely.\r\n\r\nDr. Alfred Perry has served four years in the confederate army. Comment is\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Keep, Viavant, Turpise, Toyes, Holliday, Bear, Walsh, Moore and\r\nDucongel, all contributed more or less in money and influence towards\r\nestablishing a government hostile and inimical to the United States.\r\n\r\nDr. Holliday was at one time acting as surgeon in a rebel camp. (Moore.)\r\n\r\nMr. Rodgers, the candidate for the position of superintendent of public\r\nschools, held the same office at the commencement of the war. His conduct\r\nat that time was imbued with extreme bitterness and hate towards the\r\nUnited States, and in his capacity as superintendent he introduced the\r\n\"Bonnie Blue Flag\" and other rebel songs into the exercises of the schools\r\nunder his charge. In histories and other books, where the initials \"U.S.\"\r\noccurred, he had the same erased and \"C.S.\" substituted. He used all means\r\nin his power to imbue the minds of the youths intrusted to his care with\r\nhate and malignity towards the Union. He has just returned from the late\r\nconfederacy, where he has resided during the war. At the time he left the\r\ncity to join the rebel army he left his property in the care of one\r\nFinley, who claims to be a British subject, but held the position of\r\nsergeant in a confederate regiment of militia.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nCHAS. W. LOWELL,\r\n_Major 80th United States Colored Infantry and Provost Marshal General_.\r\n\r\nMajor General E.R.S. CANBY,\r\n_Commanding Department_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 17.\r\n\r\n[From the New Orleans Times, September 12, 1865.]\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nTo the citizens of New Orleans our public schools have long been a\r\ncherished and peculiar interest. They have been regarded with pride,\r\nfostered with peculiar care, and looked up to as a source of future\r\ngreatness. In their first organization, Samuel J. Peters, and those who\r\nacted with him, had to contend against the popular prejudices of the day,\r\nfor parental pride--sometimes stronger than common sense--was shocked at\r\nthe thought of an educational establishment in which the children of all\r\nclasses of citizens met on a common level, and the difference between free\r\nschools and charity schools was not very readily discerned. Those\r\nprejudices, however, wore gradually away, and the free schools increased\r\nin numbers and efficiency till they were regarded by rich and poor with\r\nequal interest. Pride withdrew its frown and put on a patronizing smile.\r\nThe children of the cavalier sat beside those of the roundhead, and\r\nheterogeneous differences of race were extinguished by a homogeneous\r\nfellowship.\r\n\r\nFor years previous to the war our public schools occupied a high position.\r\nNo political or sectarian dogmas were taught. In politics and religion\r\nchildren naturally incline to the opinions of their parents, and it is\r\nwell that they do so; for if the reverse were the case, there would be\r\nmany divided households, which, under existing arrangements, are\r\nharmonious and happy. The teachers taught those branches only which are\r\nset down in the educational programme, and the knowledge they imparted was\r\nnecessary, not only for the appreciation but for the preservation of our\r\nfree form of government. It is true that schoolmasters, like other people,\r\nhave their own notions of right and wrong--their own political and\r\nreligious opinions--but we speak what we know when we state that up to the\r\ntime of the rebellion no attempt was made to give the minds of the pupils\r\nin the public schools of New Orleans either a political or religious bias.\r\nSome incline to the opinion that the duties of the educational trust would\r\nhave been more effectively performed had patriotic politics been made a\r\nprominent branch of study; but to such a course innumerable objections\r\nwould have arisen. Patriotism does not always wear the same mantle, or\r\npoint in the same direction. It accommodates itself to the peculiarities\r\nof different countries and forms of government. Sometimes it is a holy\r\nprinciple--sometimes a mere party catchword with no more real meaning than\r\ncan be attached to the echo of an echo.\r\n\r\nAfter the city was redeemed from rebel rule an earnest effort was made to\r\ninclude loyalty among the branches of our popular education, and tests\r\nwere applied with perhaps an unnecessary degree of rigor. For this the\r\nexcited state of public opinion, arising from the civil strife which then\r\nprevailed, was the sole excuse. Some seeds of bitterness were\r\nunfortunately sown. The antagonism of parents were repeated and\r\nintensified in the children, and love of country proved weak when compared\r\nwith hatred of the rebels. Such enthusiastic displays, such hoistings of\r\nflags, such singings of patriotic songs were never known before. This made\r\nthe children very loyal, but exceedingly revengeful and unchildlike. The\r\ndivine advice, \"love your enemy,\" they would have pronounced the height of\r\nmadness, if not wickedness. In short, they were introduced before their\r\ntime into the arena of political perplexities. For all this the teacher\r\nwas perhaps not very much to blame. He was swept on by a current which he\r\ncould not resist even if he would. A \"higher law,\" irresponsible at the\r\ntime, and backed up by the persuasive bayonet, was an authority which\r\nbrooked no resistance. He merely obeyed orders and earned his daily bread.\r\nUnder these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that the public\r\nschools lost a portion of their previous popularity, and, notwithstanding\r\nthe diminished financial resources of our citizens, private schools\r\nmultiplied among them beyond all precedent.\r\n\r\nAn effort is now made to get the schools once more under popular control,\r\nand render them what they were originally intended to be--mere educational\r\ninstitutions. To this end a school board has been appointed, but as soon\r\nas it undertook to act it was met, as to certain members, by a question of\r\nloyalty, raised, in all probability, by some interested party, who, being\r\nwithout offence himself, thought proper to fling a few stones at his\r\noffending neighbors. If there be any disloyalty in the board we trust that\r\nit will be speedily purged thereof, but, knowing most of the members, we\r\ngreatly doubt that any such bill of indictment can be sustained. At any\r\nrate, a week has elapsed since the charge was made, and we imagine it will\r\nbe disposed of before the meeting takes place, which was appointed for\r\nto-morrow evening.\r\n\r\nOne of our contemporaries, in his edition of yesterday evening, states, on\r\nthe strength of a positive assurance, \"that his excellency J. Madison\r\nWells has been appointed provisional governor of Louisiana;\" that his\r\ncommission is here awaiting his acceptance, and that he \"will probably\r\norder an election for members of a constitutional convention\" soon after\r\nhe returns to the city. If this proves so, it will create quite a stir in\r\nthe political world hereabout. At the bare mention of \"constitutional\r\nconvention\" a shudder involuntary creeps over us, visions of bankrupt\r\ntreasuries present themselves, new species of taxation to frighten our\r\npatient but impoverished people, and a general \"brandy and cigar\"\r\nsaturnalia for our disinterested and immensely patriotic politicians. But\r\nof this we suppose we need have no fear. The funds are deficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 18.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS SUB-DISTRICT OF JACKSON,\r\n\r\n_Jackson, Mississippi, September_ 17, 1865.\r\n\r\nMajor: I would respectfully make the following report as to what I saw and\r\nlearned by conversing with officers and citizens during my recent visit to\r\nthe northwest part of this sub-district, particularly in Holmes county.\r\nThe only garrison at present in the county is at Goodman, situated on the\r\nrailroad, sixteen miles from Lexington, the county seat, which place I\r\nvisited. Of the male population of the county I would estimate that not\r\nmore than one-tenth of the whites and one-fourth the blacks seemed to have\r\nany employment or business of any kind; universal idleness seemed to be\r\nthe rule, and work the exception, and but few of those at work seemed to\r\nbe doing so with any spirit, as though they had any idea of accomplishing\r\nanything---just putting the time in. One-half of the male population can\r\nbe met upon the road any day, and the travelling at night is much more\r\nthan would be expected. In a common country road, probably thirty persons\r\npassed in a night on horseback. As to the character of the persons met by\r\nday or night many of them would be called suspicious, being supplied with\r\narms, which they often take pains to display, riding United States and\r\nConfederate States horses and mules, government saddles and bridles, which\r\nit is useless to try to take away, as they have no difficulty in proving\r\nthem to be theirs by the evidence of some comrade with whom they\r\nreciprocate in kind. They boast of Jeff. Davis and President Johnson, try\r\nin every way to show their contempt for the Yankee, boast of the number\r\nthey have killed; &c. They want it understood that they are not\r\nwhipped--simply overpowered. They have no visible means of support, and\r\nthe impression is that they are living off the proceeds of government\r\ncotton and stock, and quite frequently of private property---generally\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nThe negroes complain that these same \"gallant young men\" make a practice\r\nof robbing them of such trifles as knives, tobacco, combs, &c. If any\r\nresistance is made, death is pretty sure to be the result; or if the poor\r\nnegro is so unfortunate as to appear to recognize his persecutors, he can\r\nthen expect nothing less. Negroes are often shot, as it appears, just out\r\nof wanton cruelty, for no reason at all that any one can imagine. The\r\nolder and more respected class of white men seem to deplore the condition\r\nof things; think, however, that there is no way to stop it, except to let\r\nit have its own course; say such occurrences, though not so frequent, were\r\nby no means uncommon before the war. In conversing with such as were the\r\nleaders in politics and society before the war, and the leaders in the\r\nrebellion, one is reminded of their often-repeated assertions that the\r\nnegro cannot take care of himself; capital must own labor, &c., &c. They\r\nhave preached it, talked it, spoken it so long, that free labor would be a\r\nfailure in the south, (and especially negro labor,) that it seems they\r\nhave made themselves believe it, and very many act as though they were\r\nbound to make it so, if it was not going to be the natural result. Some,\r\nnow their crops are gathered, drive off all the hands they do not want,\r\nwithout any compensation for their summer's work except food and clothing.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the negroes act just like children, roving around the\r\ncountry, caring nothing for the future, not even knowing one day what they\r\nare to eat the next. They also seem to think that in their present\r\ncondition as freemen their former masters and present employers should\r\naddress them in a more respectful manner than formerly. This the whites\r\nrefuse to accede to, but persist in still treating them as niggers, giving\r\nthem orders in the same austere manner as of old. In one day's travel I\r\npassed by different places where five colored men had been murdered during\r\nthe five days just passed, and as many wounded. In one place it appears\r\nthat one man was taken out of bed and killed because, as the neighbors\r\nsay, he was a preacher, though they none of them contend that he had ever\r\ntaught any doctrine or said anything against the peace and welfare of the\r\nneighborhood; but nearly all approve the act. Three men were engaged in\r\nit, and finding some colored men were witnesses to the transaction, they\r\nkilled two of them and left all three together. At another place a party\r\nof men, women, and children were collected together at a plantation, with\r\nthe consent of the owner, and were having a dance, when a squad of about\r\ntwelve rode up and, without any warning of any kind, commenced firing at\r\nthem, killing one and wounding several. It is of course known by the white\r\npersons in the vicinity who these murderers are, but no effort is made to\r\narrest them. The negroes say they have recognized a number of them, and\r\nsay most all lived near by. I found no one that thought there was anything\r\nobjectionable about this particular meeting, but nearly all objected to\r\nthe practice of their gathering together; think it gives them extravagant\r\nideas of liberty, has a tendency to make them insubordinate, &c. Another\r\nplace a colored man was killed--supposed to have been shot for a small\r\namount of money he happened to have with him; no clue to the murderers.\r\nAnother place within one-fourth of a mile of Lexington, a colored man was\r\nshot through the head on the public road, (was not yet dead,) and his\r\npockets rifled of the few cents he had; also his knife. Over in Attala\r\ncounty I learned that not long since two white men, (merchants,) while\r\nsitting in their store, were both instantly killed, as is supposed,\r\nbecause they were finding out too much about where their stolen cotton had\r\ngone to.\r\n\r\nWhen returning, near Canton I was informed by the commanding officer of\r\nthe post that recently, near by, a colored boy was met by a couple of\r\nthese \"honorable young men\" of the south, and his hands tied, was shot,\r\nhis throat cut, and his ears cut off. No one has been able to ascribe any\r\nreason for it, as he was a very quiet, inoffensive lad. Two persons have\r\nbeen arrested for the deed. When arraigned by the civil authorities they\r\nwere acquitted, as no white witnesses were knowing to the murder, and\r\ncolored witnesses were not permitted to testify; but they were again\r\narrested by the captain commanding the post, add forwarded for trial by\r\nmilitary commission. All, both black and white, are afraid to give\r\nevidence against any one. They say in some instances that they would like\r\nto see the rascals get their just deserts; but if they were instrumental\r\nin bringing it about they would have to move to a military post for\r\nsafety, and when the troops are withdrawn they would have to go also. An\r\ninsurrection among the colored people is quite a subject of conversation\r\namong the whites, and they appear to fear it will develop itself in a\r\ngeneral uprising and massacre about the 1st of January next. I do not\r\nconsider there are any grounds for their suspicions, and believe it arises\r\nfrom their troubled consciences, which are accusing them of the many cruel\r\nacts perpetrated against their former slaves, and these barbarities are\r\ncontinued by some for the purpose of still keeping them under subjection.\r\nIn some places there will evidently be a scarcity of food the coming\r\nwinter, and white and black, as the season for foraging has passed, will\r\nsoon have to get assistance or starve, as they seem determined not to\r\nwork. I did not find among those I talked with one person who was in favor\r\nof organizing militia as contemplated in the governor's proclamation. Some\r\nthought it might be of service if it was composed of the right kind of\r\nmen, but they know it would be composed of just a lot of roving fellows,\r\nthe very ones who now most need watching. Militia finds favor only with\r\nthe politicians, who are much in want of a hobby to ride, bar-room\r\nloafers, who think it would give their present calling a little more\r\nrespectability, and the rambling fellows who would like some show of\r\nauthority to cover up their robberies, with probably a few men who\r\nhonestly believe it would be composed of better material.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the classes above described, a large majority would be\r\nin favor of the United States forces remaining in the State. I am of the\r\nopinion that a large amount of good might be done, if good speakers would\r\ntravel around the country and explain to the freedmen what their rights\r\nare, what their duties are, and to the planters what the government\r\nexpects of them and wishes them to do. A better understanding of this\r\nmatter would be of advantage to all concerned. In conclusion I would\r\nrespectfully state that I find myself unable in many instances to arrest\r\nparties accused of crime, for the reason no horses or mules can be\r\nobtained to mount soldiers sent in pursuit, and on account of the scarcity\r\nof officers in the command to take charge of squads.\r\n\r\nI am, major, very respectfully, &c.,\r\n\r\nCHARLES H.

The trial was to take place before the probate judge, of\r\nJackson county, no regular courts being held at that time. I sent an order\r\nto the sheriff to release the prisoners. I also sent an order to the judge\r\nbefore whom the trial was to take place to suspend action in their cases.\r\nAt the same time I reported the case to General Thomas, commander of the\r\nmilitary division of the Tennessee, and asked for instructions. I received\r\nanswer that my action was approved. A few days afterwards it was reported\r\nto me that the sheriff refused to obey the order, and had used the most\r\ndisrespectful language against the military authorities of the United\r\nStates. I ordered his arrest, but about the same time I received orders to\r\nmuster out all white regiments in my district, and my own regiment being\r\namong them, I relinquished command of the district. I deem the lives of\r\nsouthern men that have served in the United States army unsafe when they\r\nreturn to their homes. As to the feeling of the people in that section of\r\nthe country, the majority at this day are as bitter enemies of the United\r\nStates government as they were during the war.\r\n\r\nGeneral, I have the honor to remain your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.

She had followed Wilson's column\r\ntowards Macon two or three days, and when returning camped near the road,\r\nand while asleep a white man by the name of Ferguson, or Foster, an\r\noverseer, came upon her and cut her ears off. This happened in April,\r\nabout thirty miles east of Montgomery.\r\n\r\n2. Mary Steel, one side of her head scalped; died. She was with Nancy.\r\n\r\n3. Jacob Steel, both ears cut off; was with the same party.\r\n\r\n4. Amanda Steel, ears cut off; was with the same party.\r\n\r\n5. Washington Booth, shot in the back, near Montgomery, while returning\r\nfrom his work, May 1. He was shot by William Harris, of Pine Level, thirty\r\nmiles from here, without any provocation.\r\n\r\n6. Sutton Jones, beard and chin cut off. He belonged to Nancy's party, and\r\nwas maimed by the same man.\r\n\r\n7. About six colored people were treated at this hospital who were shot by\r\npersons in ambuscade during the months of June and July. Their names\r\ncannot be found in a hasty review of the record.\r\n\r\n8. Robert, servant of Colonel Hough, was stabbed while at his house by a\r\nman wearing in part the garb of a confederate soldier; died on the 26th of\r\nJune, in this hospital, about seven days after having been stabbed.\r\n\r\n9.

In a majority of cases the provocation consisted in the\r\nnegroes trying to come to town, or to return to the plantation after\r\nhaving been sent away. These cases are in part as follows:\r\n\r\nWilson H. Gordon, convicted by military commission of having shot and\r\ndrowned a negro, May 14, 1865.\r\n\r\nSamuel Smiley, charged with having shot one negro and wounded another,\r\nacquitted on proof of an alibi. It is certain, however, that one negro was\r\nshot and another wounded, as stated. Trial occurred in June.\r\n\r\nThree negroes were killed in the southern part of Dallas county; it is\r\nsupposed by the Vaughn family. I tried twice to arrest them, but they\r\nescaped into the woods.\r\n\r\nMr. Alexander, Perry county, shot a negro for being around his quarters at\r\na late hour. He went into his house with a gun and claimed to have shot\r\nthe negro accidentally. The fact is, the negro is dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Dermott, Perry county, started with a negro to Selma, having a rope\r\naround the negro's neck. He was seen dragging him in that way, but\r\nreturned home before he could have reached Selma. He did not report at\r\nSelma, and the negro has never since been heard of. The neighbors declare\r\ntheir belief that the negro was killed by him. This was about the 10th of\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\nMr. Higginbotham, and Threadgill, charged with killing a negro in Wilcox\r\ncounty, whose body was found in the woods, came to my notice the first\r\nweek of August.\r\n\r\nA negro was killed on Mr. Brown's place, about nine miles from Selma, on\r\nthe 20th of August. Nothing further is known of it. Mr. Brown himself\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nA negro was killed in the calaboose of the city of Selma, by being beaten\r\nwith a heavy club; also, by being tied up by the thumbs, clear of the\r\nfloor, for three hours, and by further gross abuse, lasting more than a\r\nweek, until he died.\r\n\r\nI can further state, that within the limits of my official observation\r\ncrime is rampant; that life is insecure as well as property; that the\r\ncountry is filled with desperadoes and banditti who rob and plunder on\r\nevery side, and that the county is emphatically in a condition of anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe cases of crime above enumerated, I am convinced, are but a small part\r\nof those that have actually been perpetrated.\r\n\r\nI am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.P. HOUSTON,\r\n_Major 5th Minnesota, and Provost Marshal U.S. forces at Selma, Alabama_.\r\n\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 22.\r\n\r\nFREEDMEN'S BUREAU,\r\n\r\n_Mobile, September_ 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: In compliance with your request I have the honor to report the state\r\nof affairs as connected with the freedmen in this city and the counties of\r\nWashington, Monroe, Clark, Choctaw and Baldwin.\r\n\r\nThe civil authorities in this city have accepted General Swayne's order\r\nNo. 7, (herewith enclosed,) but the spirit of the order is not complied\r\nwith, and complaints of injustice and criminal partiality in the mayor's\r\ncourt have been frequently made at this office, and particularly when Mr.\r\nMorton presides there is no justice rendered to the freedmen. Little or no\r\nbusiness is done before other magistrates, as the colored people are\r\naware, from experience, that their oath is a mere farce and their\r\ntestimony against a white man has no weight; consequently all complaints\r\nof the colored people come before this bureau.\r\n\r\nI have by special order of General Swayne designated one of the justices\r\nof the peace, Mr. T. Starr, who adjudicates cases of debt, and in matters\r\nwhere both parties are of color he has so far given satisfaction, but the\r\nprejudice so universal against colored people here is already beginning to\r\naffect his decisions.\r\n\r\nThe civil police department of this city is decidedly hostile to color,\r\nand the daily acts of persecution in this city are manifest in the number\r\nof arrests and false imprisonment made where no shadow of criminality\r\nexists, while gangs of idle rebel soldiers and other dissolute rowdies\r\ninsult, rob, and assault the helpless freedmen with impunity.\r\n\r\nAll hopes of equity and justice through the civil organization of this\r\ncity is barred; prejudice and a vindictive hatred to color is universal\r\nhere; it increases intensely, and the only capacity in which the negro\r\nwill be tolerated is that of slave.\r\n\r\nThe fever of excitement, distrust, and animosity, is kept alive by\r\nincendiary and lying reports in the papers, and false representations of\r\nrebel detectives. The alarm is constantly abroad that the negroes are\r\ngoing to rise; this is utterly without foundation. The freedmen will not\r\nrise, though docile and submissive to every abuse that is heaped upon them\r\nin this city. If they are ragged and dirty, they are spurned as outcasts;\r\nif genteel and respectable, they are insulted as presumptive; if\r\nintelligent, they are incendiary; and their humble worship of God is\r\nconstrued as a designing plot to rise against the citizens who oppress\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that General Swayne's good intentions are nugatory from the\r\nwant of faith on the part of those to whom he intrusted his order.\r\n\r\nThese men have been recipients of office for years. Old associations,\r\ncustoms and prejudices, the pressure of public opinion, and the undying\r\nhostility to federal innovation, all conspire gainst impartiality to\r\ncolor. Such is the state of affairs in this city.\r\n\r\nIn the counties of this district above named there is no right of the\r\nnegro which the white man respects; all is anarchy and confusion; a reign\r\nof terror exists, and the life of the freedmen is at the mercy of any\r\nvillain whose hatred or caprice incites to murder. Organized patrols with\r\nnegro hounds keep guard over the thoroughfares, bands of lawless robbers\r\ntraverse the country, and the unfortunate who attempts escape, or he who\r\nreturns for his wife or child, is waylaid or pursued with hounds, and shot\r\nor hung. Laborers on the plantations are forced to remain and toil without\r\nhope of remuneration. Others have made the crop and are now driven off to\r\nreach Mobile or starve; scarcely any of them have rags enough to cover\r\nthem. Many who still labor are denied any meat, and whenever they are\r\ntreated with humanity it is an isolated exception. Ragged, maimed, and\r\ndiseased, these miserable outcasts seek their only refuge, the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, and their simple tale of suffering and woe calls loudly on the\r\nmighty arm of our government for the protection promised them.\r\n\r\nThese people are industrious. They do not refuse to work; on the contrary,\r\nthey labor for the smallest pittance and plainest food, and are too often\r\ndriven off deprived of the small compensation they labored for.\r\n\r\nThe report of rations issued to destitute citizens on August 1, 1865, was\r\n3,570 persons. Owing to the numerous impostures by those who had means of\r\nsupport, I erased the names of a large number and the list now stands\r\n1,742 persons who are recipients of government alms. Of this number, 95\r\nper cent. are rebels who have participated in some manner in this\r\nrebellion. Number of rations issued to destitute colored people is simply\r\nsix (6).\r\n\r\nThe report of the freedmen's colony of this district to this date is (12)\r\ntwelve men, (71) seventy-one women, and (88) eighty-eight children, and\r\nsick in hospital (105) one hundred and five; total (276) two hundred and\r\nseventy-six. Of this number many have been driven off of plantations as\r\nhelpless, while many of their grown children are forcibly retained to hard\r\nlabor for their masters.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.A. POILLON,\r\n_Captain, Assistant Superintendent freedmen, refugees, abandoned\r\nlands, &c._\r\n\r\nGeneral CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFreedmen's Bureau, _July_ 29, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to report some testimony I have received of the\r\nmurders and barbarities committed on the freedmen in Clark, Choctaw,\r\nWashington and Marengo counties, also the Alabama and Bigbee rivers.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of April, two freedmen were hung in Clark county.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the eleventh of May, a freedman named Alfred was taken\r\nfrom his bed by his master and others and was hung, and his body still\r\nhangs to the limb.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of June, two colored soldiers (at a house in Washington\r\ncounty) showed their papers and were permitted to remain all night. In the\r\nmorning the planter called them out and shot one dead, wounded the other,\r\nand then with the assistance of his brother (and their negro dogs) they\r\npursued the one who had escaped. He ran about three miles and found a\r\nrefuge in a white man's house, who informed the pursuers that he had\r\npassed. The soldier was finally got across the river, but has not been\r\nheard of since.\r\n\r\nAt Bladen Springs, (or rather, six miles from there,) a freedman was\r\nchained to a pine tree and _burned to death_.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks after, and fifteen miles from Bladen, another freedman was\r\nburned to death.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of May, fifteen miles south of Bladen, a freedman was\r\nshot _outside_ of the planter's premises and the body dragged into the\r\nstable, to make it appear he had shot him in the act of stealing.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of June, six miles west of Bladen, a freedman was hung.\r\nHis body is still hanging.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of May, three freedmen were coming down the Bigbee river in\r\na skiff, when two of them were shot; the other escaped to the other shore.\r\n\r\nAt Magnolia Bluff (Bigbee river) a freedman (named George) was ordered out\r\nof his cabin to be whipped; he started to run, when the men (three of\r\nthem) set their dogs (five of them) on him, and one of the men rode up to\r\nGeorge and struck him to the earth with a loaded whip. Two of them dragged\r\nhim back by the heels, while the dogs were lacerating his face and body.\r\nThey then placed a stick across his neck, and while one stood on it the\r\nothers beat him until life was nearly extinct.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of May, near ---- landing, in Choctaw county, a freedman\r\nwas hung; and about the same time, near the same neighborhood, a planter\r\nshot a freedman, (who was talking to one of his servants,) and dragged his\r\nbody into his garden to conceal it.\r\n\r\nA preacher (near Bladen Springs) states in the _pulpit_ that the roads in\r\nChoctaw county stunk with the dead bodies of servants that had fled from\r\ntheir masters.\r\n\r\nThe people about Bladen _declare_ that _no negro_ shall live in the county\r\nunless he remains with his _master_ and is as obedient as heretofore.\r\n\r\nIn Clark county, about the first of June, a freedman was shot through the\r\nheart; his body lies unburied.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of May, a planter hung his servant (a woman) in presence of\r\nall the neighborhood. Said planter had _killed_ this woman's husband three\r\nweeks before. This occurred at Suggsville, Clark county.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of April, two women were caught near a certain plantation\r\nin Clark county and hung; their bodies are still suspended.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July, two freedmen were taken off the steamer Commodore\r\nFerrand, tied and hung; then taken down, their heads cut off and their\r\nbodies thrown in the river.\r\n\r\nJuly 11, two men took a woman off the same boat and threw her in the\r\nriver. This woman had a coop, with some chickens. They threw all in\r\ntogether, and told her to go to the damned Yankees. The woman was drowned.\r\n\r\nThere are regular patrols posted on the rivers, who board some of the\r\nboats; after the boats leave they hang, shoot or drown the victims they\r\nmay find on them, and all those found on the roads or coming down the\r\nriver are most invariably _murdered_.\r\n\r\nThis is only a few of the murders that are committed on the helpless and\r\nunprotected freedmen of the above-named counties.\r\n\r\nAll the cases I have mentioned are _authentic_, and _numerous_ witnesses\r\nwill testify to all I have reported. _Murder with his ghastly train stalks\r\nabroad at noonday and revels in undisputed carnage_, while the bewildered\r\nand terrified freedmen know not what to do. To leave is death; to remain\r\nis to suffer the increased burden imposed on them by the cruel taskmaster,\r\nwhose only interest is their labor _wrung_ from them by every device an\r\ninhuman ingenuity can devise. Hence the lash and murder are resorted to to\r\nintimidate those whom fear of an awful death _alone_ causes to remain,\r\nwhile patrols, negro dogs, and spies (disguised as Yankees) keep\r\n_constant_ guard over these unfortunate people.\r\n\r\nI was in Washington county in the latter part of June, and there learned\r\nthere was a disposition to _coerce_ the labor of these people on\r\nplantations where they had always been abused. I was alone, and\r\nconsequently could not go where my presence was most required, but I\r\nlearned enough then to convince me there were many grievances which\r\nrequired military power to redress. Since my return I have been attentive\r\nto the recital of the horrors which these people suffer, and have\r\ncarefully perused their statements, which receive corroborate testimony.\r\n\r\nI have been careful in authenticity, and very much that has been related\r\nto me I have declined accepting as testimony, although I believe its\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe history of all these cases, besides others, I have in full, with all\r\ntheir horrible particulars.\r\n\r\nBelieving, sir, you required the earliest intelligence in this matter, I\r\nconcluded not to await your arrival.\r\n\r\nWith much respect, I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.A. POILLON,\r\n_Captain and Ass't. Sup't. Freedmen_.\r\n\r\nBrig. Gen. SWAYNE.\r\n\r\nA true copy of the original deposited in this office.\r\n\r\nCHARLES A. MILLER,\r\n_Major and A.A.A. General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 23.\r\n\r\nVicksburg, Mississippi, _July_ 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nCaptain: I have the honor to report that, in compliance with Special\r\nOrders No. 5, Headquarters Sub-district Southwest Mississippi, I proceeded\r\nto the counties of Madison, Holmes, and Yazoo, but that I did not reach\r\nIssaquena from the fact that the country between Yazoo City and that\r\ncounty has been so overflowed as to render the roads impassable.\r\n\r\nI found a provost marshal of freedmen at Yazoo City--Lieutenant Fortu, who\r\nseemed to understand his duties well, and to have performed them\r\nsatisfactorily. There was no officer of the bureau in either of the other\r\ncounties. The whole country is in a state of social and political anarchy,\r\nand especially upon the subject of the freedom of the negroes, but very\r\nfew who understand their rights and duties.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that officers of the bureau should be sent\r\nto all the counties of the State to supervise the question of labor, and\r\nto insure the gathering of the growing crop, which, if lost, will produce\r\nthe greatest suffering. In no case ought a citizen of the locality be\r\nappointed to manage the affairs of the freedmen: first, because these men\r\nwill wish to stand well with their neighbors and cannot do justice to the\r\nnegro; and secondly, because the negroes only know these men as oppressors\r\nof their race, and will have no confidence in their acts. The officers of\r\nthe bureau should be especially charged to impress upon the freedmen the\r\nsacredness of the family relation and the duty of parents to take care of\r\ntheir children, and of the aged and infirm of their race. Where a man and\r\nwoman have lived together as husband and wife, the relation should be\r\ndeclared legitimate, and all parties, after contracting such relations,\r\nshould be compelled to legal marriage by severe laws against concubinage.\r\nWhere parents have deserted their children, they should be compelled to\r\nreturn and care for them; otherwise there will be great suffering among\r\nthe women and children, for many of the planters who have lost the male\r\nhands from their places threaten to turn off the women and children, who\r\nwill become a burden to the community. The two evils against which the\r\nofficers will have to contend are cruelty on the part of the employer, and\r\nshirking on the part of the negroes. Every planter with whom I have talked\r\npremised his statements with the assertion that \"a nigger won't work\r\nwithout whipping.\" I know that this is not true of the negroes as a body\r\nheretofore. A fair trial should be made of free labor by preventing a\r\nresort to the lash. It is true that there will be a large number of\r\nnegroes who will shirk labor; and where they persistently refuse\r\ncompliance with their contracts, I would respectfully suggest that such\r\nturbulent negroes be placed upon public works, such as rebuilding the\r\nlevees and railroads of the State, where they can be compelled to labor,\r\nand where their labor will be of benefit to the community at large.\r\n\r\nIt will be difficult for the employers to pay their laborers quarterly, as\r\nrequired by present orders. Money can only be realized yearly on a cotton\r\ncrop, because to make such a crop requires an entire year's work in\r\nplanting, picking, ginning, and sending to market. The lien upon the crop\r\nsecures the laborer his pay at the end of the year, for which he can\r\nafford to wait, as all the necessaries of life are furnished by the\r\nplanter, who could not pay quarterly except at a great sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe present orders recommend that the freedmen remain with their former\r\nmasters so long as they are kindly treated. This, as a temporary policy,\r\nis the best that could be adopted, but I very much doubt its propriety as\r\na permanent policy. It will tend to rebuild the fallen fortunes of the\r\nslaveholders, and re-establish the old system of class legislation, thus\r\nthrowing the political power of the country back into the hands of this\r\nclass, who love slavery and hate freedom and republican government. It\r\nwould, in my opinion, be much wiser to diffuse this free labor among the\r\nlaboring people of the country, who can sympathize with the laborer, and\r\ntreat him with humanity.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that great care be taken in the selection of officers of\r\nthe bureau to be sent to the various counties. The revolution of the whole\r\nsystem of labor has been so sudden and radical as to require great caution\r\nand prudence on the part of the officers charged with the care of the\r\nfreedmen. They should be able to discuss the question of free labor as a\r\nmatter of political economy, and by reason and good arguments induce the\r\nemployers to give the system a fair and honest trial.\r\n\r\nNowhere that I have been do the people generally realise the fact that the\r\nnegro is free. The day I arrived at Jackson _en route_ for Canton, both\r\nthe newspapers at that place published leading editorials, taking the\r\nground that the emancipation proclamation was unconstitutional, and\r\ntherefore void; that whilst the negro who entered the army _might_ be\r\nfree, yet those who availed themselves not of the proclamation were still\r\nslaves, and that it was a question for the State whether or not to adopt a\r\nsystem of gradual emancipation. These seem to be the views of the people\r\ngenerally, and they expressed great desire \"to get rid of these\r\ngarrisons,\" when they hope \"to have things their own way.\" And should the\r\ncare and protection of the nation be taken away from the freedmen, these\r\npeople will have their own way, and will practically re-establish slavery,\r\nmore grinding and despotic than of old.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted:\r\n\r\nJ.L.

He left the State in 1862,\r\nand went to New Orleans, where he received a commission to raise a\r\nregiment of Texas troops.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL THOMAS,\r\n_Colonel_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 24.\r\n\r\nRAILROAD, _Camp near Clinton, Miss., July_ 8, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: I am induced by the suffering I daily see and hear of among colored\r\npeople to address you this communication. I am located with my command\r\nfour miles west of Clinton, Hines county, on the railroad. A great many\r\ncolored people, on their way to and from Vicksburg and other distant\r\npoints, pass by my camp. As a rule, they are hungry, naked, foot-sore, and\r\nheartless, aliens in their native land, homeless, and friendless. They are\r\nwandering up and down the country, rapidly becoming vagabonds and thieves\r\nfrom both necessity and inclination. Their late owners, I am led to\r\nbelieve, have entered into a tacit arrangement to refuse labor, food or\r\ndrink, in all cases, to those who have been soldiers, as well as to those\r\nwho have belonged to plantations within the State; in the latter case,\r\noften ordering them back peremptorily to their \"masters.\"\r\n\r\nOne planter said in my hearing lately, \"These niggers will all be slaves\r\nagain in twelve months. You have nothing but Lincoln proclamations to make\r\nthem free.\" Another said, \"No white labor shall ever reclaim my cotton\r\nfields.\" Another said, \"Emigration has been the curse of the country; it\r\nmust be prevented here. This soil must be held by its present owners and\r\ntheir descendants.\" Another said, \"The constitutional amendment, if\r\nsuccessful, will be carried before the Supreme Court before its execution\r\ncan be certain, and we hope much from that court!\"\r\n\r\nThese expressions I have listened to at different times, and only repeat\r\nthem here in order that I may make the point clear that there is already a\r\nsecret rebel, anti-emigration, pro-slavery party formed or forming in this\r\nState, whose present policy appears to be to labor assiduously for a\r\nrestoration of the old system of slavery, or a system of apprenticeship,\r\nor some manner of involuntary servitude, on the plea of recompense for\r\nloss of slaves on the one hand, and, on the other, to counterbalance the\r\ninfluence of Yankee schools and the labor-hiring system as much as\r\npossible by oppression and cruelty. I hear that negroes are frequently\r\ndriven from plantations where they either belong, or have hired, on slight\r\nprovocation, and are as frequently offered violence on applying for\r\nemployment. Dogs are sometimes set upon them when they approach houses for\r\nwater. Others have been met, on the highway by white men they never saw\r\nbefore, and beaten with clubs and canes, without offering either\r\nprovocation or resistance. I see negroes almost every day, of both sexes,\r\nand almost all ages, who have subsisted for many hours on berries, often\r\nwandering they know not where, begging for food, drink, and employment.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me or any officer I have the pleasure of an\r\nacquaintance with to afford these people relief. Neither can I advise\r\nthem, for I am not aware that any provisions have been, or are to be made\r\nto reach such cases. The evil is not decreasing, but, on the contrary, as\r\nthe season advances, is increasing.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore entertained the opinion that the negroes flocked into\r\nthe cities from all parts of the country; but a few weeks' experience at\r\nthis station has changed my views on the subject, and I am now led to\r\nbelieve that those who have done so comprise comparatively a very small\r\npart of the whole, and are almost entirely composed of those belonging to\r\nplantations adjoining the towns. However, those who did go to the cities\r\nhave been well cared for in comparison with those who have remained in the\r\ncountry. A small proportion of the latter class are well situated, either\r\nas necessary house-servants, body-servants, or favorites by inclination,\r\nas mistresses, or by necessity or duty, as each master may have been\r\ninduced to regard long and faithful service or ties of consanguinity.\r\nThroughout the entire country, from Vicksburg to the capital of the State,\r\nthere is but little corn growing. The manner of cultivating is very\r\nprimitive, and the yield will be exceedingly small. I estimate that in\r\nthis country fully one-half of the white population, and a greater\r\nproportion of the colored people, will be necessitated either to emigrate,\r\nbuy food, beg it, or starve. The negro has no means to buy, and begging\r\nwill not avail him anything. He will then be compelled to emigrate, which,\r\nin his case, is usually equivalent to turning vagabond, or, induced by his\r\nnecessities, resort to organized banding to steal, rob, and plunder. I am\r\nat a loss to know why the government has not adopted some system for the\r\nimmediate relief and protection of this oppressed and suffering people,\r\nwhose late social changes have conduced so much to their present unhappy\r\ncondition, and made every officer in the United States army an agent to\r\ncarry out its provisions. Were I employed to do so, I should seize the\r\nlargest rebel plantation in this and every other county in the State,\r\npartition it in lots of suitable size for the support of a family--say ten\r\nacres each--erect mills and cotton gins, encourage them to build houses\r\nand cultivate the soil, give them warrants for the land, issue rations to\r\nthe truly needy, loan them seed, stock, and farming utensils for a year or\r\ntwo, and trust the result to \"Yankee schools\" and the industry of a then\r\ntruly free and proverbially happy people. Some other system might be\r\nbetter; few could be more simple in the execution, and in my opinion\r\nbetter calculated to \"save a race\" now floating about in a contentious sea\r\nwithout hope or haven.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nH.R.

I apprehend you are laboring under a mistake in\r\nregard to the character of this organization. I had express authority\r\nfrom the President himself to organize the militia if I thought it\r\nnecessary to keep order in the country. This I did not do, but authorized\r\nthe organization of patrol guards or county police, for the purpose of\r\nsuppressing crime, and for arresting offenders. This organization is\r\ntherefore part of the civil organization of the State, as much so as\r\nsheriff, constable, and justices of the peace, and I claim the right to\r\nuse this organization for these purposes, and hope you will revoke your\r\norder.\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L.

Clark, was by their own acknowledgment in the habit of\r\npatrolling the roads in this section of the country, and ordering any one\r\nthey came across to halt. If this was not promptly done, they were ordered\r\nto fire upon them. In this way one negro woman was wounded, and Union men\r\nand negroes were afraid to be out of their houses after dark. The company\r\nwas formed out of what they called picked men, _i.e._, those only who\r\nhad been actively engaged in the war, and were known to be strong\r\ndisunionists.\r\n\r\nThe negroes in the section of the country these men controlled were kept\r\nin the most abject state of slavery, and treated in every way contrary to\r\nthe requirements of General Orders No. 129 from the War Department, a copy\r\nof which order was issued by me to C.B. Clark.\r\n\r\nHoping, general, to receive instructions as to the manner in which I shall\r\nregulate my action,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nP.

OF MISS.,\r\n\r\n_Vicksburg, Miss., September_ 28, 1865.\r\n\r\nColonel: I beg leave to call your attention to some of the difficulties we\r\nare still obliged to contend with, and some of the abuses still inflicted\r\nupon the freedmen, resulting from the prejudices which are still far from\r\nbeing eradicated. In the immediate vicinity of our military posts, and in\r\nlocations that can readily be reached by the officers of this bureau, the\r\ncitizens are wary of abusing the blacks; they are so because this bureau\r\nhas arrested and punished people committing such offences; and the manner\r\nin which such cases have been dealt with has shown people that abuse and\r\nimposition will not be tolerated, and that such offences are sure to be\r\npunished in accordance with the enormity of the crime. But in remote\r\nlocalities, those that cannot well be reached by officers of the bureau,\r\nthe blacks are as badly treated as ever; colored people often report\r\nthemselves to the sub-commissioners with bruised heads and lacerated\r\nbacks, and ask for redress, protection, to be permitted to live at their\r\nformer homes, and some assurance that they will not be treated in a like\r\nmanner again if they return. But nothing can be done if their homes happen\r\nto be twenty or thirty miles from any office that will protect them. A\r\ngreat many have thus learned that there is no protection for them, and\r\nquietly submit to anything that may be required of them, or, as is more\r\nfrequently the case, they leave such places and crowd about the places\r\nwhere they can be protected.\r\n\r\nA girl about twelve years of age, certainly too young to commit any\r\nserious offence, lies in No. 1 hospital now with her back perfectly raw,\r\nthe results of a paddling administered by her former owner. Any number of\r\nsuch cases could easily be cited. In many cases negroes who left their\r\nhomes during the war, and have been within our military lines, and have\r\nprovided homes here for their families, going back to get their wives or\r\nchildren, have been driven off and told they could not have them. In\r\nseveral cases guards have been sent to aid people in getting their\r\nfamilies, in many others it has been impracticable, as the distance was\r\ntoo great. In portions of the northern part of this district the colored\r\npeople are kept in SLAVERY still. The white people tell them that they\r\nwere free during the war, but the war is now over, and they must go to\r\nwork again as before. The reports from sub-commissioners nearest that\r\nlocality show that the blacks are in a much worse state than ever before,\r\nthe able-bodied being kept at work under the lash, and the young and\r\ninfirm driven off to care for themselves.\r\n\r\nAs to protection from the civil authorities, there is no such thing\r\noutside of this city. There is not a justice of the peace or any other\r\ncivil officer in the district, eight (8) counties, of which I have charge,\r\nthat will listen to a complaint from a negro; and in the city, since the\r\nadjudication of these cases has been turned over to the mayor, the abuse\r\nof and impositions upon negroes are increasing very visibly, for the\r\nreason that very little, if any, attention is paid to any complaint of a\r\nnegro against a white person. Negro testimony is admitted, but, judging\r\nfrom some of the decisions, it would seem that it carries very little\r\nweight. In several cases black witnesses have been refused on the ground\r\nthat the testimony on the opposite side, white, could not be controverted,\r\nand it was useless to bring in black witnesses against it. I enclose an\r\naffidavit taken on one such case. In the mayor's court, cases in which it\r\nis practicable to impose a fine and thereby replenish the city treasury,\r\nare taken up invariably, but cases where the parties have no money are\r\nvery apt to pass unnoticed. One more point, and a serious one, too, for\r\nthe colored people, is, that in the collection of debts, and a great many\r\nof a similar class of cases that are not taken cognizance of in the\r\nmayor's court, they have to go through a regular civil process,\r\nnecessitating the feeing of lawyers, &c., which is quite a burden on a\r\npeople whose means are limited. These cases have all formerly been handled\r\nby an officer of this bureau, and without any expense to the parties for\r\nfees, &c.\r\n\r\nThe prejudices of the citizens are very strong against the negro; he is\r\nconsidered to be deserving of the same treatment a mule gets, in many\r\ncases not as kind, as it is unprofitable to kill or maim a mule, but the\r\nbreaking of the neck of the free negro is nobody's loss; and unless there\r\nis some means for meting out justice to these people that is surer and\r\nmore impartial than these civil justice's courts, run by men whose minds\r\nare prejudiced and bitter against the negro, I would recommend, as an act\r\nof humanity, that the negroes be made slaves again.\r\n\r\nI am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJ.H.

Governor Parsons, of Alabama, approved of the\r\narrangement, and urged the State officials to comply with the condition,\r\nand thus do away with the necessity for military courts in connexion with\r\nfreedmen affairs. I have no doubt I could have induced the governor of\r\nMississippi to take the same action had I thought it the policy of the\r\ngovernment. I was under the impression that General Swayne had made a\r\nmistake, and that he would defeat the very objects for which the bureau\r\nwas laboring. I thought the citizens were not to be trusted with freedmen\r\naffairs until they had given some strong evidence that they were prepared\r\nto accept the great change in the condition of the freedmen. I had not the\r\nleast idea that such a limited control as General Swayne now has would\r\naccomplish what the authorities desired. The protection he gives freedmen\r\nunder his order is so limited, and will fall so far short of what the\r\nfreedmen have a right to expect, that I did not think of bringing the\r\nmatter before the government. Late orders and instructions from the\r\nPresident convince me that I was mistaken, and that the trial is to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nI have issued an order in accordance with these instructions, which I\r\nappend:\r\n\r\n[General Orders No. 8.]\r\n\r\nBUREAU REFUGEES, FREEDMEN, AND ABANDONED LANDS, _Office Ass't.\r\nCommissioner for State of Miss., Vicksburg, Miss., September_ 20, 1865.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from Circular No. 5, current series, Bureau\r\nRefugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, and General Orders No. 10,\r\ncurrent series, headquarters department of Mississippi, in reference to\r\nthe same, are hereby republished for the guidance of officers of this\r\nbureau:\r\n\r\n[\"Circular No. 5.]\r\n\r\n\"WAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n\"_Bureau Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, Washington, May_ 30,\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n\"RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR ASSISTANT COMMISSIONERS.\r\n\r\n\"VII. In all places where there is an interruption of civil law, or in\r\nwhich local courts, by reason of old codes, in violation of the freedom\r\nguaranteed by the proclamation of the President and laws of Congress,\r\ndisregard the negro's right to justice before the laws, in not allowing\r\nhim to give testimony, the control of all subjects relating to refugees\r\nand freedmen being committed to this bureau, the assistant commissioners\r\nwill adjudicate, either themselves or through officers of their\r\nappointment, all difficulties arising between negroes and whites or\r\nIndians, except those in military service, so far as recognizable by\r\nmilitary authority, and not taken cognizance of by the other tribunals,\r\ncivil or military, of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"O.O.

This order, (Circular No. 5, paragraph VII, Bureau Refugees,\r\nFreedmen, and Abandoned Lands,) however, must not be so construed as to\r\ngive the colored man immunities not accorded to other persons. If he is\r\ncharged with the violation of any law of the State, or an ordinance of any\r\ncity, for which offence the same penalty is imposed upon white persons as\r\nupon black, and if courts grant to him the same privileges as are accorded\r\nto white men, no interference on the part of the military authorities will\r\nbe permitted. Several instances have recently been reported in which\r\nmilitary officers, claiming to act under the authority of the order above\r\nmentioned, have taken from the custody of the civil authorities negroes\r\narrested for theft and other misdemeanors, even in cases where the courts\r\nwere willing to concede to them the same privileges as are granted to\r\nwhite persons. These officers have not been governed by the spirit of the\r\norder. The object of the government is not to screen this class from just\r\npunishment--not to encourage in them the idea that they can be guilty of\r\ncrime and escape its penalties, but simply to secure to them the rights of\r\nfreemen, holding them, at the same time, subject to the same laws by which\r\nother classes are governed.\r\n\r\n\"By order of Major General Slocum:\r\n\r\n\"J. WARREN MILLER,\r\n\"_Assistant Adjutant General_.\"\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this order, where the judicial officers and magistrates\r\nof the provisional government of this State will take for their mode of\r\nprocedure the laws now in force in this State, except so far as those laws\r\nmake a distinction on account of color, and allow the negroes the same\r\nrights and privileges as are accorded to white men before their courts,\r\nofficers of this bureau will not interfere with such tribunals, but give\r\nthem every assistance possible in the discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\nIn cities or counties where mayors, judicial officers, and magistrates\r\nwill assume the duties of the administration of justice to the freedmen,\r\nin accordance with paragraph VII, Circular No. 5, issued from the Bureau\r\nof Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, and approved by the President,\r\nand will signify their willingness to comply with this request by a\r\nwritten acceptance addressed to the assistant commissioner for the State,\r\nno freedmen courts will be established, and those that may now be in\r\nexistence in such localities will be closed.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the officers of this bureau will heartily co-operate\r\nwith the State officials in establishing law and order, end that all\r\nconflict of authority and jurisdiction will be avoided.\r\n\r\nBy order of Colonel Samuel Thomas, assistant commissioner Freedmen's\r\nBureau for State of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nSTUART ELDRIDGE,\r\n_Lieutenant, Acting Assistant Adjutant General_.\r\n\r\nI have written to Governor Sharkey, and explained to him how this order\r\ncan be put in force in this State, and will do all I can to secure its\r\nsuccess, and to aid the civil authorities to discharge their duties. I\r\npresume the legislature of this State, which is to meet in October, will\r\ntake up this matter immediately, and arrange some plan by which the State\r\nauthorities can take complete charge of freedmen affairs, and relieve the\r\nofficers of this bureau. There is a jealousy of United States officers\r\nexisting among the State officials that makes it disagreeable to perform\r\nany duty which is liable to conflict with their authority.\r\n\r\nWhen General Howard's Circular No. 5 was issued, I thought it was the\r\nintention that military courts should be established for the purpose of\r\ntaking the administration of justice among the freedmen out of the hands\r\nof their old masters, and placing it under the control of their friends\r\nfor a short time--until the citizens of the south were reconciled to the\r\nchange, and until their feeling of hatred for their former slaves had\r\nabated; that a complete restoration of rights, privileges, and property\r\nwas to come after a period of probation, in which they should give some\r\nevidence of their changed feelings. I have thought much on this subject,\r\nhave watched the development of feeling among the southern people, and am\r\nsatisfied that the time for such a restoration has not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nThe order of General Swayne and the proclamation of General Parsons are\r\nunexceptionable in form. If justice to the freedmen can be secured by the\r\nmeans indicated in these documents, and if the process be not too\r\nexpensive, and if ruinous delays be not allowed, then, it may be, all this\r\nmovement will be good. But it seems to me that so delicate a matter cannot\r\nbe smoothly managed in the present temper of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nI am aware that it is the policy of the government; that we must trust\r\nthese people some time; that the establishment of the Freedman's Bureau is\r\n(as soon as martial law is withdrawn) a violation of the spirit both of\r\nthe State and federal constitutions; that the officers of the bureau have\r\nno interest in common with the white citizens of the State, and that the\r\nbureau is an immense expense to the general government, which should be\r\nabolished as soon as compatible with the public interest.\r\n\r\nYet, I feel that we are in honor bound to secure to the helpless people we\r\nhave liberated a \"republican form of government,\" and that we betray our\r\ntrust when we hand these freed people over to their old masters to be\r\npersecuted and forced to live and work according to their peculiar\r\nsouthern ideas. It seems to me that we are forgetting the helpless and\r\npoor in our desire to assist our subjugated enemies, and that we are more\r\ndesirous of showing ourselves to be a great and magnanimous nation than of\r\nprotecting the people who have assisted us by arms, and who turned the\r\nscale of battle in our favor. We certainly commit a wrong, if, while\r\nrestoring these communities to all their former privileges as States, we\r\nsacrifice one jot or tittle of the rights and liberties of the freedmen.\r\n\r\nThe mayor of this city has had complete charge of all municipal affairs\r\nsince the issue of General Slocum's Order 10, (quoted in the order I have\r\nbefore given.) He has been compelled to admit negro testimony by the\r\nprovisions of that order. In cases that come before him, when it is\r\nnecessary to admit it he goes through the form of receiving it, but I have\r\nyet to hear of one instance where such evidence affected his decision. The\r\ntestimony of one white man outweighs (practically) that of any dozen\r\nfreedmen.\r\n\r\nThe admission of negro testimony will never secure the freedmen justice\r\nbefore the courts of this State as long as that testimony is considered\r\nvalueless by the judges and juries who hear it. It is of no consequence\r\nwhat the law may be if the majority be not inclined to have it executed. A\r\nnegro might bring a suit before a magistrate and have colored witnesses\r\nexamined in his behalf, according to provisions of general orders and\r\nUnited States law, and yet the prejudices of the community render it\r\nimpossible for him to procure justice. The judge would claim the right to\r\ndecide whether the testimony was credible, and among the neighbors that\r\nwould surround him, in many places, he would be bold, indeed, if he\r\nbelieved the sworn evidence of a negro when confronted by the simple\r\nassertion or opposed even to the interest of a white man. I recently heard\r\na circle of Mississippians conversing on this subject. Their conclusion\r\nwas, that they would make no objection to the admission of negro\r\ntestimony, because \"no southern man would believe a nigger if he had the\r\ndammed impudence to testify contrary to the statement of a white man.\" I\r\nverily believe that in many places a colored man would refuse, from fear\r\nof death, to make a complaint against a white man before a State tribunal\r\nif there were no efficient military protection at hand.\r\n\r\nWherever I go--the street, the shop, the house, the hotel, or the\r\nsteamboat--I hear the people talk in such a way as to indicate that they\r\nare yet unable to conceive of the negro as possessing any rights at all.\r\nMen who are honorable in their dealings with their white neighbors will\r\ncheat a negro without feeling a single twinge of their honor. To kill a\r\nnegro they do not deem murder; to debauch a negro woman they do not think\r\nfornication; to take the property away from a negro they do not consider\r\nrobbery. The people boast that when they get freedmen affairs in their own\r\nhands, to use their own classic expression, \"the niggers will catch hell.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason of all this is simple and manifest. The whites esteem the\r\nblacks their property by natural right, and however much they may admit\r\nthat the individual relations of masters and slaves have been destroyed by\r\nthe war and by the President's emancipation proclamation, they still have\r\nan ingrained feeling that the blacks at large belong to the whites at\r\nlarge, and whenever opportunity serves they treat the colored people just\r\nas their profit, caprice or passion may dictate.\r\n\r\nJustice from tribunals made up among such people is impossible. Here and\r\nthere is a fair and just man. One in a hundred, perhaps, sees the good\r\npolicy of justice; but these are so few that they will not, at present,\r\nguide public sentiment. Other States may, in this matter, be in advance of\r\nMississippi; I suspect they are. If justice is possible, I feel sure they\r\nare.\r\n\r\nI fear such tribunals would be very expensive for the poor freedmen. Fees\r\nare heavy in this State. Unless they can get justice inexpensively, we\r\nmight as well deny them all remedy before courts at once. Indeed, I think\r\nthat would be rather more merciful than the arrangement proposed, as they\r\nwould then trust nobody, and would be less defrauded. Long delays in the\r\ncourse of procedure would be ruinous to most of them. How could a freedman\r\nappeal a suit for wages, or respond adequately to an appeal, when he is\r\nstarving for want of the very wages which are withheld from him?\r\n\r\nIt may be claimed that officers of the bureau can watch such cases and see\r\nthat justice is done the freedman. I say they cannot do it. Political\r\npower is against him, and will destroy any officer who fearlessly does his\r\nduty in this way. He will be charged with interference with the civil\r\nauthority, with violating some constitution or some code; his acts will be\r\nso twisted and contorted before they reach Washington, that he will get\r\nnothing for his pains but censure and dismissal.\r\n\r\nI can say without fear of contradiction, that there has not occurred one\r\ninstance of interference with civil authorities on the part of military\r\nofficers in this State, unless they saw first that every law of justice\r\nwas violated to such an extent as to arouse the indignation of any man\r\nborn in a country where human beings have an equal right to justice before\r\nthe tribunals of the land. Yet, if I am not mistaken, there is a growing\r\nimpression, supported by this same political power in the south, that the\r\nofficers in this State are tyrannical, meddlesome, and disposed to thwart\r\nthe faithful efforts of the noble white people to reorganize the State.\r\n\r\nMany delegations of the citizens of this State have visited Washington for\r\nthe purpose of getting their property returned, or of obtaining some other\r\nfavor. They, in order to accomplish their desire, represent the feeling of\r\ntheir friends at home as very cordially disposed toward the United States\r\ngovernment, and say that they all acquiesce in the freedom of the negroes.\r\nA little examination into the condition of affairs in this State will show\r\nthat this is not the case, and that what the people do is only done in\r\norder that they may be restored to power so as to change the direction in\r\nwhich affairs are tending. I am afraid the profuse loyalty of the\r\ndelegations to Washington is being taken as the sentiment of the masses,\r\nand is directing legislation and policy.\r\n\r\nIt is idle to talk about these people working out this negro problem.\r\nPeople who will not admit that it is best, or even right, to educate the\r\nfreedmen, are not the proper persons to be intrusted with the\r\nadministration of justice to them. I have no hesitation in saying, that if\r\nthe question of educating the colored people were to-day submitted to the\r\nwhites of this State, they would vote against it in a body. Nine-tenths of\r\nthe educated and refined class, who are supposed to have higher and nobler\r\nfeelings, would vote against it.\r\n\r\nI have been called on by persons of this class, and asked to suppress the\r\nreligious meetings among the colored people because they made so much\r\nnoise! When I remonstrate with them and talk of religious freedom, and of\r\nthe right of all to worship God in the manner most suited to their\r\nconvictions of right, these gentlemen hold up their hands in horror at the\r\nidea. What would magistrates selected from these people do in reference to\r\nsuch complaints? Suppress the meeting, of course.\r\n\r\nA similar and much stronger prejudice exists against the establishment of\r\nschools for the negro's benefit. If federal bayonets were to-day removed\r\nfrom our midst, not a colored school would be permitted in the State. The\r\nteachers, perhaps, would not be tarred and feathered and hung, as they\r\nwould have been in old times, but ways and means innumerable would present\r\nthemselves by which to drive them out.\r\n\r\nThe white citizens both of Vicksburg and Natchez have requested me not to\r\nestablish freedmen schools inside their city limits, yet over one-half the\r\npopulation of these cities is composed of freed people--the class who are\r\ndoing the work, toiling all day in the sun, while the white employers are\r\nreaping the benefit of their labor through superior knowledge, and are\r\noccupying their elegant leisure by talking and writing constantly about\r\nthe demoralization of negro labor--that the negro won't work, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is nonsense to talk so much about plans for getting the negroes to\r\nwork. They do now and always have done, all the physical labor of the\r\nsouth, and if treated as they should be by their government, (which is so\r\nanxious to be magnanimous to the white people of this country, who never\r\ndid work and never will,) they will continue to do so. Who are the workmen\r\nin these fields? Who are hauling the cotton to market, driving hacks and\r\ndrays in the cities, repairing streets and railroads, cutting timber, and\r\nin every place raising the hum of industry? The freedmen, not the rebel\r\nsoldiery. The southern white men, true to their instincts and training,\r\nare going to Mexico or Brazil, or talk of importing labor in the shape of\r\nCoolies, Irishmen--anything--anything to avoid work, any way to keep from\r\nputting their own shoulders to the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe mass of the freedmen can and will support themselves by labor. They\r\nneed nothing but justice before the courts of the land, impartial judges\r\nand juries, to encourage them in well-doing, or punish them for the\r\nviolation of just laws, a chance to own the land and property they can\r\nhonestly obtain, the free exercise of their right to worship God and\r\neducate themselves, and--let them alone.\r\n\r\nThe delegates to Washington think that it is their duty, peculiarly, to\r\nsee the President and arrange the affairs of the negro. Why don't they\r\nattend to their own business, or make arrangements for the working of the\r\ndisbanded rebel army in the cotton fields and workshops of the south?\r\nThere are to-day as many houseless, homeless, poor, wandering, idle white\r\nmen here as there are negroes in the same condition, yet no arrangements\r\nare made for their working. All the trickery, chicanery and political\r\npower possible are being brought to bear on the poor negro, to make him do\r\nthe hard labor for the whites, as in days of old.\r\n\r\nTo this end the mass of the people are instinctively working. They\r\nsteadily refuse to sell or lease lands to black men. Colored mechanics of\r\nthis city, who have made several thousand dollars during the last two\r\nyears, find it impossible to buy even land enough to put up a house on,\r\nyet white men can purchase any amount of land. The whites know that if\r\nnegroes are not allowed to acquire property or become landholders, they\r\nmust ultimately return to plantation labor, and work for wages that will\r\nbarely support themselves and families, and they feel that this kind of\r\nslavery will be better than none at all.\r\n\r\nPeople who will do these things, after such a war, and so much misery,\r\nwhile federal bayonets are yet around them, are not to be intrusted with\r\nthe education and development of a, race of slaves just liberated.\r\n\r\nI have made this letter longer than it should have been, and may have\r\ntaxed your patience, yet I do not see how I could have said less, and\r\nexpressed my views on the subject.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL THOMAS,\r\nColonel, Assistant Commissioner B.R.F. and A.L.\r\nfor Mississippi and N.E. Louisiana.\r\n\r\nGeneral CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 28.\r\n\r\nMobile, Alabama, _September_ 9, 1865.\r\n\r\nColonel George D. Robinson, 97th United States colored troops, states as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nI was sent out to Connecuh, Covington, Coffee, Dale, and Henry counties,\r\nto administer the amnesty oath. I was at Covington myself, having officers\r\nunder my orders stationed in the other four counties. I travelled through\r\nConnecuh and Covington; about the other counties I have reports from my\r\nofficers. A general disposition was found among the planters to set the\r\ncolored people who had cultivated their crops during the summer adrift as\r\nsoon as the crops would be secured, and not to permit the negro to remain\r\nupon any footing of equality with the white man in that country.\r\n\r\nIn none of the above-named counties I heard of a justice of the peace or\r\nother magistrate discharging the duties of an agent of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau, nor did I hear of any of them willing to do so. I deem it\r\nnecessary that some officers be sent out there to attend to the interests\r\nof the freedmen, in order to avoid the trouble and confusion which is\r\nalmost certain to ensue unless the matter is attended to and regulated.\r\n\r\nI returned from Covington yesterday, September 8.\r\n\r\nGEO. D. ROBINSON,\r\n_Colonel 97th United States Infantry_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 29.\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM OF A CONVERSATION BETWEEN WILLIAM KING, ESQ., OF SAVANNAH, AND\r\nCARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\nSavannah, July 31, 1865.\r\n\r\nQuestion by Mr. Schurz. What are the ideas of the people in this State as\r\nto the future organization of your labor system?\r\n\r\nAnswer. It is generally conceded that slavery is dead, but it is believed\r\nthat the negro will not work unless compelled to. Money is no inducement\r\nthat will incite him to work. He works for comfort, that is, he wants to\r\ngain something and then enjoy it immediately afterwards. He has no idea of\r\nthe binding force of a contract, and it is questionable whether he ever\r\nwill have.\r\n\r\nQuestion. So you consider the contract system, as it is now introduced\r\nhere and there, a failure.\r\n\r\nAnswer. In a number of cases that I know of it is a failure. The negroes\r\nare not doing the work they have contracted for. I know other cases in\r\nwhich they have remained with their former masters, work well, and produce\r\nfair crops.\r\n\r\nQuestion. In what manner, then, can, in your opinion, the free-labor\r\nsystem be made to work here?\r\n\r\nAnswer. The negro must be kept in a state of tutelage, like a minor. For\r\ninstance, he may be permitted to freely choose the master for whom he\r\nwants to work; he may bind himself for a year, and, for all practical\r\npurposes, the master must act as his guardian.\r\n\r\nQuestion. You think, then, something more is necessary than a mere\r\ncontract system by which the negro is only held to fulfil his contract?\r\n\r\nAnswer. Yes. The negro ought to be held in the position of a ward.\r\n\r\nQuestion. Do you not think the negro ought to be educated, and do you\r\nbelieve the people of this State would tax themselves for the purpose of\r\nestablishing a general system of education?\r\n\r\nAnswer. I think it would be well to have the negro educated, but I do not\r\nthink the people of this State would tax themselves for such a purpose.\r\nThe people are too poor and have too many other things to take care of. We\r\nhave to look for that to the people of the North. The North having freed\r\nthe negroes, ought to see to it that they be elevated. Besides, the poor\r\nwhites are not in favor of general education at all. They are themselves\r\nvery ignorant, and look upon education as something dangerous. For them we\r\nmust have a system of compulsory education, or we cannot get them to send\r\ntheir children to school. A good many of the Hardshell Baptists among them\r\nlook upon school-teachers as the emissaries of the devil.\r\n\r\nQuestion. How far do you think the people of this State would be prepared\r\nto grant the negro equality before the law? Would they, for instance, give\r\nhim the right to testify in courts of justice against white men?\r\n\r\nAnswer. I think not. It is generally believed that the negro has no idea\r\nof the sanctity of an oath.\r\n\r\nQuestion. Do you not think such disabilities would place the negro under\r\nsuch disadvantage in the race of life as to deprive him of a fair chance?\r\n\r\nAnswer. This is the dilemma, in my opinion: either we admit the negro's\r\ntestimony in courts of justice, and then our highest interests are placed\r\nat the mercy of a class of people who cannot be relied on when testifying\r\nunder oath; or we deny the negro that right, and then he will not be in a\r\nposition to properly defend his own interests, and will be a downtrodden,\r\nmiserable creature.\r\n\r\nQuestion. Do you not think vagrancy laws and police regulations might be\r\nenacted, equally applicable to whites and blacks, which might obviate most\r\nof the difficulties you suggest as arising from the unwillingness of the\r\nnegro to work?\r\n\r\nAnswer. Perhaps they might; but the whites would not agree to that. The\r\npoor whites hate and are jealous of the negro, and the politicians will\r\ntry and please the whites so as to get their votes.\r\n\r\nQuestion. Do you think it would be advisable to withdraw our military\r\nforces from the State if the civil government be restored at an early\r\ndate?\r\n\r\nAnswer. It would not be safe. There are a great many bad characters in the\r\ncountry who would make it for some time unsafe for known Union people, and\r\nfor northerners who may settle down here, to live in this country without\r\nthe protection of the military. The mere presence of garrisons will\r\nprevent much mischief. The presence of the military is also necessary to\r\nmaintain the peace between the whites and blacks, and it will be necessary\r\nuntil their relations are settled upon a permanent and satisfactory basis.\r\n\r\nThis memorandum was read by me to Mr. King and approved by him as a\r\ncorrect reproduction of the views he had expressed.\r\n\r\nC. SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 30.\r\n\r\n_What the planter wants before he embarks his capital and time in the\r\nattempt to cultivate another crop.--Suggestions submitted by a committee\r\nat a meeting of planters, November 24, 1864_.\r\n\r\n_First_.--Above all, he wants an undoubted guarantee that the labor and\r\nteams, corn and hay, with which he begins the cultivation of another crop\r\nshall be secured to him for at least twelve months. From past experience,\r\nwe know that, to be reliable, this guarantee must come from the government\r\nat Washington.\r\n\r\n_Second_.--Some mode of compelling laborers to perform ten (10) hours of\r\nfaithful labor in each twenty-four hours, (Sundays excepted,) and strict\r\nobedience of all orders. This may be partially attained by a graduated\r\nsystem of fines, deduction of time or wages, deduction of rations of all\r\nkinds in proportion to time lost, rigidly enforced. But in obstinate cases\r\nit can only be done by corporal punishments, such as are inflicted in the\r\narmy and navy of the United States. In light cases of disobedience of\r\norders and non-performance of duty the employer should impose fines, &c.\r\nThe corporal punishment should be inflicted by officers appointed by the\r\nsuperintendent of \"colored labor,\" who might, from time to time, visit\r\neach plantation in a parish, and ascertain whether the laborer was\r\nsatisfied with his treatment, and whether he performed his part of the\r\ncontract, and thus the officer would qualify himself by his own\r\ninformation to correct any abuse that might exist, and award equal justice\r\nto each party. The plan of sending off refractory laborers to work on\r\ngovernment plantations is worse than useless. A planter always plants as\r\nmuch land as he believes he has labor to cultivate efficiently, neither\r\nmore nor less. If less, a portion of his laborers are idle a part of their\r\ntime; if more, his crops must suffer from the want of proper cultivation.\r\nIf the laborers do not work faithfully, and their work is not judiciously\r\ndirected, either from want of skill on the part of him who directs the\r\nlabor, or from the refusal or failure of the laborers from any cause to do\r\nthe work as it ought to be done, the crops must suffer. If, then, a\r\nportion of labor necessary to cultivate a certain amount of land is\r\nabstracted by sending it to work anywhere else, the crop must fail in\r\nproportion to the amount of labor abstracted. It must therefore be\r\napparent to all that the amount of prompt, faithful, and well-directed\r\nlabor, necessary to cultivate a given quantity of land efficiently, must\r\nbe available at all times, when the cultivator deems it necessary, or the\r\ncrops must necessarily, to a greater or less extent, prove a failure.\r\n\r\n_Third_.--The rate of wages should be fixed--above which no one should be\r\nallowed to go. There should be at least four classes of hands, both male\r\nand female. If the laborer should be furnished, as this year, 1864, with\r\nclothing, shoes, rations, houses, wood, medicine, &c., the planter cannot\r\nafford to pay any more wages than this year, and to some hands not so\r\nmuch. Wages should not be paid oftener than once a quarter. As long as a\r\nnegro has a dime in his pocket he will go every Saturday to some store or\r\ntown. Besides, if the men have money once a month they are constantly\r\ncorrupting the women, who will not work because they expect to get money\r\nof the men. If the laborers are to pay for all their supplies, some think\r\nhigher wages could be paid; but it would be necessary to require the negro\r\nto supply himself with at least two suits of clothes, one pair of shoes, a\r\nhat, and four pounds of pork or bacon, one peck of corn meal a week,\r\nvegetables at least twice a week, for a first-class hand. The laborer\r\nshould pay for his medicine, medical attendance, nursing, &c.; also, house\r\nrent, $5 a month, water included; wood at $2 a cord in the tree, or $4 a\r\ncord cut and delivered. Instead of money, each employer should be required\r\nto pay once a week in tickets issued and signed by himself or agent, not\r\ntransferable to any one off the premises of him who issues them,\r\nredeemable by the issuer quarterly in current funds, and to be received by\r\nhim in the purchase of goods, provisions, &c., which he sold at current\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_.--A law to punish most severely any one who endeavors, by\r\noffering higher wages, gifts, perquisites, &c., &c., to induce a negro to\r\nleave his employer before the expiration of the term for which he has\r\nengaged to labor without the consent of said employer.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_.--Wages to be quarterly. One-half to be retained to the end of the\r\nyear, unless it is found that more than half is required to maintain a man\r\nand his family.\r\n\r\n_Sixth_.--Lost time to be deducted from wages daily; fines to be charged\r\ndaily; rations, of all kinds, to be docked in proportion to the time lost\r\nduring the week, if rations are to be supplied.\r\n\r\n_Seventh_.--Fines to be imposed for disobedience of any orders.\r\n\r\n_Eighth_.--During sugar-making the laborer should be required to work at\r\nnight as well as during the day. For night-work he might be allowed double\r\nwages for the time he works.\r\n\r\n_Ninth_.--The negroes should not be allowed to go from one plantation to\r\nanother without the written permit of their employer, nor should they be\r\nallowed to go to any town or store without written permission.\r\n\r\n_Tenth_.--That the laborers should be required to have their meals cooked\r\nin a common kitchen by the plantation cooks, as heretofore. At present\r\neach family cook for themselves. If there be twenty-five houses on a\r\nplantation worked by one hundred hands, there are lighted, three times\r\nevery day, winter and summer, for the purpose of cooking, twenty-five (25)\r\nfires, instead of one or two, which are quite as many as are necessary. To\r\nattend these twenty-five fires there must be twenty-five cooks. The\r\nextravagance in wood and the loss of time by this mode must be apparent to\r\nall. Making the negroes pay for the wood they burn, and for fencing lumber\r\nof any kind, would have a tendency to stop this extravagant mode of doing\r\nbusiness. They should also be fined heavily or suffer some kind of\r\ncorporal punishment for burning staves, hoop-poles, shingles, plank,\r\nspokes, &c., which they now constantly do.\r\n\r\n_Eleventh_.--None but regularly ordained ministers should be allowed to\r\npreach. At present on every plantation there are a number of preachers.\r\nFrequent meetings are held at night, continuing from 7 or 8 p.m. until\r\n1 or 2 o'clock a.m. The day after one of these long meetings many of\r\nthe laborers are unfit to labor; neither are the morals of the negroes\r\nimproved by these late meetings, nor the health. The night meetings should\r\nbreak up at 10 p.m., and there should be but one a week on a plantation.\r\nSome of the preachers privately promulgate the most immoral doctrines.\r\n\r\n_Twelfth_.--A police guard or patrol should be established under the\r\ncontrol of the superintendent of free labor, whose duty it shall be, under\r\ntheir officers, to enforce the rules and regulations that the\r\nsuperintendent of free labor may think best to adopt for the government of\r\nthe laborers and their families on plantations and in private families.\r\n\r\n_Thirteenth_.--The laborers are at present extremely careless of the\r\nteams, carts, wagons, gear, tools, and material of all kinds put in their\r\npossession, and should therefore be held accountable for the same. Parents\r\nshould be held liable for things stolen or destroyed by their children not\r\nover twelve years of age.\r\n\r\n_Fourteenth_.--Foremen should be fined whenever they fail to report any of\r\nthe laborers under them who disobey orders of any kind. The foreman at the\r\nstable should be required especially to report neglect or ill treatment of\r\nteams by their drivers, and he should be held liable for all tools and\r\nhalters, &c., put in the stable.\r\n\r\n_Fifteenth_.--The unauthorized purchase of clothing or other property by\r\nlaborers, or others domesticated on plantations, should be severely\r\npunished, and so should the sale by laborers or others domesticated on\r\nplantations of plantation products without a written permission be\r\npunished by fine, imprisonment, and obstinate cases by corporal\r\npunishment. The sale or furnishing of intoxicating liquor of any kind to\r\nlaborers or others domesticated on plantations should be severely\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n_Sixteenth_.--The possession of arms or other dangerous weapons without\r\nauthority should be punished by fine or imprisonment and the arms\r\nforfeited.\r\n\r\n_Seventeenth_.--No one, white or colored, with or without passes, should\r\nhave authority to go into a quarter without permission of the proprietor\r\nof said quarter. Should any insist upon going in, or be found in a quarter\r\nwithout permission of the proprietor, he should be arrested at once by the\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\n_Eighteenth_.--Fighting and quarrelling should be prohibited under severe\r\npenalties, especially husbands whipping their wives.\r\n\r\n_Nineteenth_.--Laborers and all other persons domesticated on plantations\r\nor elsewhere should be required to be respectful in tone, manner, and\r\nlanguage to their employers, and proprietors of the plantations or places\r\non which they reside, or be fined and imprisoned.\r\n\r\n_Twentieth_.--The whole study, aim, and object of the negro laborer now is\r\nhow to avoid work and yet have a claim for wages, rations, clothes, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 31.\r\n\r\nOAK FOREST, NEAR TIGERVILLE STATION,\r\n\r\n_N.O. and O. Railroad, December_ 1, 1864.\r\n\r\nDear Sir: The earnest desire you have manifested to make the negro laborer\r\nunder the new order of things successful, makes me the more disposed to\r\noffer every assistance in my power to that end. I have no prejudices to\r\novercome; I would do the blacks all the good in my power consistently with\r\ntheir welfare and the welfare of the country; I owe them no ill will, but\r\nI am well satisfied that it will demand the highest skill and the largest\r\nexperience combined to make the new system work successfully, when\r\nhitherto all others, including our own two years' experience, have\r\nsignally failed. No namby-pamby measures will do. We may have more psalm\r\nsinging, more night preaching, greater excesses in the outward\r\nmanifestation of religion, but depend upon it there will be less true\r\nmorality, less order, less truthfulness, less honest industry. It is not\r\nthe experiment of a few only, or of a day, but of an _institution_, if\r\nanything, for millions; the mixing in industrial association of separate\r\nraces hitherto distinct; of systems fundamentally changed and not of mere\r\nindividuals, and the man who does not rise to the height of the great\r\nargument fails before he starts. It is not to listen to babblers, to\r\n_professional_ philanthropists, to quacks and demagogues: it demands a\r\nmanly, masculine, vigorous exercise of executive power, adapted to the\r\ncircumstances of the case. Nobody is absolutely free, white or black. I\r\nhave been a slave all my life; you have been the same. We were subject to\r\ndiscipline from childhood, and the negro as well, and must continue to be\r\nsubject to wholesome restraints all of us.\r\n\r\nIt is well to consider that the measures of the government have rendered\r\nlabor scarce. It would be safe to say there is not _half a supply_; that\r\nevery sort of inducement will be held out to get labor away from present\r\nsituations; that the inclination of all who are unincumbered is, to get to\r\nthe city and its neighborhood. Every planter has some already there,\r\nliving most unprofitably. I have half a dozen, some under the agreement of\r\nthe present year. Concentration is the order of the day, and none but\r\nthose who can command the largest sum of money will be able to carry on\r\nplantations with any hope of success. I take leave to add some\r\nsuggestions, believing you will receive them with the same friendly spirit\r\nin which they are offered. I am still surrounded by my own servants, and\r\nwould like to see the system so ordered that they would still find it to\r\ntheir advantage to remain in their present comfortable homes.\r\n\r\nWages, rules, and regulations should be fixed and uniform: nothing left to\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nA penalty should be inflicted on every employer who deviates from the\r\nestablished rates, _maximum_ rates.\r\n\r\nNo field crops should be raised by hired laborers. The evils attending\r\nthis are numerous and insurmountable.\r\n\r\nWages should be extremely moderate on account of the unsteadiness of labor\r\nand exceeding uncertainty of crops of all sorts, but especially of cane\r\nand cotton.\r\n\r\nCooking for hands should be confined absolutely to one kitchen, and a\r\ncharge made for all wood taken to their houses; a certain supply should be\r\nallowed, and no additional quantity permitted at any price: otherwise no\r\nplantation can long stand the enormous, wasteful consumption of fuel.\r\n\r\nAll necessary expenditures for the blacks, old as well as young, should be\r\nborne by themselves. White laborers are all liable to such charges, and\r\nwhy not wasteful and improvident blacks? They should be early taught the\r\nvalue of what they consume as well as the other costs of living.\r\n\r\nAbout keeping stock the rule should be absolute.\r\n\r\nNo travelling about, day or night, without a written sanction from the\r\nproper person. The violation of this order by a commanding officer has\r\nbrought the small-pox on my place and already eight grown hands have died\r\nwith it, and there are not less than twenty invalids besides: this is one\r\nof the evils.\r\n\r\nMedicine and professional attendance a charge to the patient, as well as\r\nall educational arrangements.\r\n\r\nEvery ploughman or woman, and teamster, to be obliged to feed and curry\r\nhis or her team once at least every day.\r\n\r\nPayments beyond proper and prescribed supplies to be small, the smaller\r\nthe better, and still better if withheld till the crop is made and saved;\r\nbut settlements by tickets should be made weekly. (A share in the crop is\r\nthe best for both parties.) I do not perceive the utility of \"home\r\ncolonies;\" they belong to the class of _theories_ more than anything else.\r\nFamilies should be kept together and at the \"homes\" to which they have\r\nbeen accustomed, if possible, and _made_ to support themselves, all who\r\nare able to do so. At present there are many who will not do this because\r\nthey are made a charge on the master or employer. Vagrants should be\r\npunished; _work is a necessity_. But I only put down a few particulars to\r\n_impress_ upon your mind as they occur to me.\r\n\r\nI know the difficult task you have undertaken. You have a giant to manage,\r\nand you will have to exercise a giant's strength. You have no less than to\r\nrevise the teachings of all past history. You have to accomplish what has\r\nnever been accomplished before. Neither in the east nor in the west has\r\nthe African been found to work voluntarily; but the experiment is to be\r\ntried anew in this country, and I shall lend my assistance, whatever it\r\nis, to help on in the road to success, if that be possible. I have tried\r\nit two years under the military without success, or the prospect of it.\r\nIf, however, I can in any way assist you to gain the meed of success, both\r\nmy own interest and my kind feelings towards you combine to prompt me to\r\nrenewed efforts in the cause.\r\n\r\nI remain, very respectfully and truly, yours,\r\n\r\nT. GIBSON.\r\n\r\nHon. B.F. FLANDERS.\r\n\r\nP.S.--The great desideratum in obtaining labor from free blacks is its\r\n_enforcement_. How is this to be done? Formerly the known authority\r\npossessed by the master over the slave, prevented in a great degree the\r\nexercise of it. The knowledge now, on the part of the blacks, that the\r\nmilitary authority has forbidden any authority over them, increases the\r\nvery necessity of the power which is forbidden. This is palpable to any\r\none who sees with an experienced eye for a day. There can necessarily be\r\nno order, day or night, no fidelity, no morality, no industry. _It is so_,\r\nspeculate and theorize as we may. I wish it were different; it is a great\r\npity to witness these deplorable effects.\r\n\r\nDisease is scattered broadcast; my own stock has been for some time\r\nconsumed, except a few milch cows. The sugar from the sugar-houses has\r\nbeen sold in quantities in every direction. The cotton of one plantation\r\nhas been sold to the extent of half the crop to a white man, and only by\r\nthe merest accident discovered in time to be detected. My neighbor's hogs\r\nhave been taken from the pen, killed and brought home for consumption; his\r\ncattle the same. These things are within my knowledge by the merest\r\naccident, but there is absolutely no remedy, because their testimony is as\r\ngood, if not better than mine, and this they know perfectly well. In a\r\ncase of sugar-selling, I had the oath of a disinterested white man to the\r\nfact, and the black and white man identified by the witness. When this\r\nwitness was through with his testimony, the negro man, the interested\r\nparty, _the accused himself_, was called up by the provost marshal, and of\r\ncourse he swore himself innocent, and so he was _cleared_. In the case of\r\nthe cotton not a negro can be brought to confess, notwithstanding the\r\nconfession of the white man and the surrender of the cotton. How, then,\r\ncan good order, good morals and honest industry be maintained when\r\nimmunity from punishment is patent to their understandings?\r\n\r\nI know no remedy adequate to the circumstances but an always present power\r\nto enforce law and order, and this now requires the constant presence of\r\nthe bayonet. Which is the best, a regular military government, or the\r\nquiet, humane exercise of just so much authority as the case demands, by\r\nthe master, who has every motive, human and divine, to exercise humanity\r\nand protect his slave from injustice and injury?\r\n\r\nThe past, or rather the present year, we had nothing but blank orders, and\r\nthese are of no avail whatever without enforcement; and this brings us\r\nback to the starting-point again, and the bayonet again, and so it is to\r\nthe end of the chapter. Moral suasion will not do for whites who have had\r\nfreedom as an inheritance, and education within their reach. How then can\r\nit be expected that he who has been predestined by the Almighty to be a\r\nservant of servants all the days of his life, shall be capable of at once\r\nrising to motives of human conduct higher than those possessed by the\r\nwhite man?\r\n\r\nAll that my reason teaches and the experience I have had, and the history\r\nI have read, bring me to the same conclusion: you must utterly fail unless\r\nyou add the stimulus of _corporal punishment_ to the admonitions of the\r\nlaw; but as this would be somewhat inconsistent with the freedom which our\r\nsolons have decreed, I must only confess my inability to prescribe the\r\northodox remedies according to the received dogmas from the inspired\r\nsources of knowledge at the north above all the lessons I have learned\r\nheretofore, and entirely above everything I expect to learn hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 32.\r\n\r\nFREEDMEN'S BUREAU,\r\n\r\n_Shreveport, La., August_ 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: At the date of my last monthly report, (July 2d,) the free-labor\r\nsystem in western Louisiana was an experiment. No contracts between the\r\nplanters and freedmen had then been entered into, and the difficulties to\r\nbe met with and overcome by the contracting parties were new to each. The\r\nherculean task of removing the objections which the freedmen offered to\r\nsigning a \"contract,\" and of eradicating the prejudice existing among the\r\nplanters against countenancing the employment upon their plantations as\r\nfree men of those whom they had so long and firmly held in bondage,\r\ndevolved upon the agents of the bureau.\r\n\r\nThe objection presented by the freedmen consisted chiefly in the fact that\r\nthey had _no confidence whatever_ in the word of their \"old masters.\" Said\r\nthey, in substance, \"We cannot trust the power that has never accorded us\r\nany privileges. Our former oppressors show by their actions that they\r\nwould sooner retard than advance our prosperity.\" While in nine cases out\r\nof ten the freedmen eagerly and readily acceded to fair terms for their\r\nlabor when the matter was explained by a government agent, exactly in the\r\nsame ratio did they refuse to listen to any proposition made by the\r\nplanter alone.\r\n\r\nTheir readiness to comprehend their situation and to enter into an\r\nagreement to work when enlightened by an agent of the bureau, or, in\r\nexceptional cases, when the planters sought in a kind and philanthropic\r\nspirit to explain to them their relations to society and the government,\r\nis conclusive proof that the disposition to be idle formed no part of the\r\nreason for their refusing to contract with their former masters.\r\n\r\nWith these facts in view, it will be readily perceived that the only\r\nfeasible mode of success was to send agents into the country to visit\r\nevery plantation. This was undertaken; but with no funds to procure the\r\nservices of assistants, and with the difficulty of obtaining the right\r\nclass of men for these positions from the army, the progress made has not\r\nbeen as rapid or the work as effectual as it would have been under more\r\nfavorable circumstances. Partial returns have been received, as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom Bienville parish        248 contracts.\r\n \"   Bossier parish           14    \"\r\n \"   Caddo parish            172    \"\r\n \"   DeSoto parish           246    \"\r\n \"   Marion county, Texas    206    \"\r\n                             ---\r\nTotal received               886    \"\r\n                             ===\r\n\r\nReturns are yet to be received from the parishes of Claiborne,\r\nNatchitoches, Winn and Sabine, and from Harrison county, Texas. These will\r\nall be given in by the 15th inst., and I shall then be able to determine\r\nthe exact number employed upon each plantation and laboring under the new\r\nsystem. Regarding the average number employed upon each plantation in the\r\nparish of Caddo as a basis for an estimate, the returned rolls will foot\r\nup a list of 7,088 names, and the whole number of freedmen contracted with\r\nduring the month of July in the district under my supervision will not\r\nprobably exceed 20,000, or fall short of 15,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the month a sufficient length of time has elapsed to render\r\njudgment to a certain extent upon the workings of the new system. That it\r\nhas not satisfied a majority of the planters is a conclusion which, from\r\ntheir disposition at first, was evident would be arrived at. That the\r\nfreedmen have accepted the arrangements devised by the government for\r\ntheir protection so readily and have worked so faithfully, is a matter\r\nfor congratulation.\r\n\r\nThe planters at first expected that, though the power to \"control\" the\r\npersons of the laborers had been torn from them by the stern requirements\r\nof war, the agents of the bureau would, through the military, confine the\r\nnegro to their plantations and compel him to labor for them. In this way\r\nit was thought that the same _regime_ as pursued in times of slavery could\r\nbe kept up, and it was this idea which prompted a planter, noted for his\r\nfrankness, to remark \"that the people of the south desired the government\r\nto continue this supervision for a term of years.\" Finding that their\r\nideas of the policy of the government were erroneous, and that they could\r\nnot exercise this \"controlling power\" either directly or indirectly, and\r\nthat the freedman was to be placed, as nearly as the circumstances\r\nsurrounding his situation would permit, upon the same grounds as the white\r\nlaborer, it is but a logical sequence that the planters should be\r\ndisappointed and dissatisfied with the work performed by the freedmen.\r\n\r\nIn this place it may be well to notice that the country is yet in a very\r\nunsettled condition. After a four years' war which has sapped it of all\r\nits resources, and after a life-long servitude for a hard taskmaster, the\r\nnegro is liberated from bondage, and he finds the people of the country in\r\nno condition to offer him the most advantageous terms for his services.\r\nThis, with the natural desire experienced by all mankind for a period of\r\nrepose after that of incessant and forced labor, is one of the causes\r\nwhich have contributed to render the freedmen negligent and inconstant at\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nReports are constantly brought to this office by the negroes from the\r\ninterior that freedmen have been kidnapped and summarily disposed of.\r\nThese obtain circulation and credence among all classes, and, whether true\r\nor not, operate disadvantageously to the interests of both the planters\r\nand the freedmen.\r\n\r\nAgain, the threat of shooting the laborers, so frequently made by the\r\nplanters, is very unwise, and usually has the effect of causing a general\r\nstampede from the plantation where the threat was made. The fact that the\r\nbody of a negro was seen hanging from a tree in Texas, near the Louisiana\r\nline; and of the murder in cold blood, in the northern part of the parish\r\nof Caddo, of Mary, a colored woman, by John Johnson, the son of the\r\nproprietor of the plantation where the woman worked; and that instances\r\nhave repeatedly occurred similar to a case presented at my office, where\r\nan old man had received a blow over his head with a shillalah one inch\r\nin diameter, which was so severe as to snap the stick asunder; and also\r\nthe fracturing of the skull and the breaking of the arm of a helpless,\r\ninoffensive colored woman by a vindictive planter in the parish of\r\nNatchitoches; and the statement of one of my agents, who says that \"upon\r\nhalf the plantations the freedmen are not well clothed and their rations\r\nare scanty;\" and of another who has visited every plantation in ward\r\nNo. --, parish of ----, who reports at the close of the month as follows:\r\n\"The freedmen in my ward are very poorly clothed and fed, although no\r\nparticular complaints have been made as yet;\" should all be taken into\r\nconsideration in arriving at conclusions in regard to the disposition of\r\nthe freedmen to work, and before judgment is rendered upon the complaints\r\nof the major portion of the planters; and it is also useless to disguise\r\nthe fact that among the freedmen, as among all classes of people, there\r\nare many ill-disposed as well as idle persons, and a few of these upon\r\neach plantation create dissatisfaction among the others.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the complaints of the planters and the above-named facts,\r\nthe existence of which would cause a disturbance among any class of\r\nlaborers in the world, the majority of the planters have been eager to\r\ncontract with their former slaves, for the reason that after their\r\nplantations had been visited by an agent of the government, and an\r\nagreement had been made upon the prescribed forms, the freedmen worked\r\nbetter than before. This is a matter of significance, and its bearing is\r\nreadily seen. Having noticed the disapprobation of the larger portion of\r\nthe planting community, and the causes which led to their complaints, I\r\ndesire to call your attention in this connexion to the report of one of\r\nmy most experienced agents. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In all cases have the employees given satisfaction where their former\r\nmasters are at all reasonable. I would mention the case of Jacob Hoss as\r\nan example: he contracted with his former slaves in the latter part of May\r\nfor one-fourth of all his crops; they have been steady and industrious,\r\nand have decidedly the finest cotton and corn in the district.\" Mr. Hoss\r\nhas 200 acres of cotton, 400 of corn, and 8 of potatoes. Your attention is\r\nalso solicited to the testimony of the _liberal few_ who have taken the\r\namnesty oath with the intention to keep it. One says: \"The freedmen in my\r\nneighborhood are laboring well where they are well paid.\" Another, a large\r\nland proprietor, states that \"he could not ask his hands to work better.\"\r\nThe same gentleman also states that \"he would not have the freedmen upon\r\nhis plantation made slaves again if he could.\"\r\n\r\nThe testimony is concurrent that, where liberal wages are paid and the\r\nfreedmen are kindly treated, no difficulty is experienced with them, and\r\nthat they labor honestly and industriously. The complaints which have been\r\npresented at the office for consideration are very nearly in a direct\r\nratio of the two classes, but the wrongs of the freedmen are by far the\r\nmost aggravated, as they suffer in almost every conceivable way. It has\r\nbeen necessary to fine and assess damages upon several planters for\r\nbeating their laborers, and also to punish several freedmen for violating\r\ntheir contracts and for other misdemeanors. The following is a literal\r\ncopy of a document brought to this office by a colored man, which is\r\nconclusive evidence that there _are_ those who still claim the negro as\r\ntheir property:\r\n\r\n\"This boy Calvin has permit to hire to whome he please, but I shall hold\r\nhim as my propperty untill set Free by Congress.\r\n\r\n\"July the 7, 1865. E.V. TULLY.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the above also made its appearance in another form in the\r\naction of the police jury of the parish of Bossier, which was an attempt\r\nto revive at once the old slave laws, and to prevent the freedmen from\r\nobtaining employment from the plantations of their former masters. The\r\ngist of the enactment alluded to is contained in the paragraph directing\r\nthe officers on patrol duty \"to arrest and take up all idle and vagrant\r\npersons running at large without employment, and carry them before the\r\nproper authority, to be dealt with as the law directs.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as this matter came under the observation of the bureau, the facts\r\nin the case were represented to Brevet Major General J.P. Hawkins,\r\ncommanding western district of Louisiana, and at the same time a request\r\nwas made that the restrictions imposed upon the freedmen in this section\r\nby General Orders No. 24, headquarters northern division of Louisiana, be\r\nrevoked; and the general issued an order, dated July 31, which removes the\r\nsaid restrictions, and prohibits the parish police juries, established by\r\nthe civil authorities, from arresting freedmen unless for positive offence\r\nagainst the law. This breaks down the last barrier to the enjoyment of\r\nliberty by the freedmen in western Louisiana, and I feel highly gratified\r\nthat it has been accomplished without referring it to higher authorities,\r\nas our mail facilities are so irregular that at least two months would\r\nhave been consumed by the operation.\r\n\r\nUpon the 10th of July the freedmen's hospital was opened for the reception\r\nof patients, and enclosed please find a copy of the hospital report for\r\nJuly, marked 1. This is a necessary as well as a charitable institution,\r\nas the city authorities have as yet taken no measures to provide for the\r\nindigent sick.\r\n\r\nSince the establishment of the bureau here, it has been found necessary to\r\nissue rations to freedmen, as follows:\r\n\r\nTo citizen employees                          46\r\nTo helpless and infirm                      236\r\nTo sick and hospital attendants           1,169\r\n                                          -----\r\nTotal issued                              1,451\r\n                                          =====\r\n\r\nThe number fed by the government to-day is as follows:\r\n\r\nMen                                           7\r\nWomen                                         6\r\nChildren                                     10\r\n                                             --\r\nTotal number infirm and helpless rationed    23\r\n\r\nNumber sick at hospital                      40\r\nNumber hospital attendants                   24\r\nNumber citizen employees rationed              1\r\n                                             --\r\nTotal number supplied with rations           88\r\n                                             ==\r\n\r\nNone but the helpless and infirm and sick have been fed at the expense\r\nof the government, and these only in cases of absolute necessity. Many\r\nplanters who abandoned their homes on the Mississippi and carried away\r\ntheir slaves to Texas have returned to this city, and with a coolness\r\namounting to audacity have demanded transportation for their former\r\nslaves to various points from the mouth of the Red river to Lake\r\nProvidence. Finding that the officers of the government would not oblige\r\nthem in this particular, they left behind the aged and infirm to provide\r\nfor themselves as best they could. This and the abuses on plantations\r\nhave caused the principal suffering among the freedmen, and have brought\r\nmany to the city who otherwise would have remained upon the plantation,\r\nbut, all things being considered, comparatively few have congregated\r\nabout town. There has been such a demand for day labor in the city that I\r\nhave deemed it a false philanthropy to feed those who temporarily sought\r\nrefuge from oppression.\r\n\r\nThe permanent residents are orderly and industrious, and desire very much\r\nto have schools established for their children. I cannot here refrain\r\nfrom mentioning the fact that the presence of negroes in town possessing\r\nfree papers is extremely disagreeable to the citizens.\r\n\r\nThe tax collected of planters has thus far been sufficient to defray\r\noffice and printing expenses. The hire of a surgeon and nurses for the\r\nhospital, amounting in July to $204.46, is the only bill which it is\r\nnecessary to refer to you for payment. All the property and money which\r\nhas come into my hands on account of the bureau has been accounted for to\r\nthe proper departments, according to regulations.\r\n\r\nBy Special Orders No. 140, dated at headquarters northern division of\r\nLouisiana, June 21, 1865, Chaplain Thomas Callahan, 48th United States\r\ncolored infantry, was assigned to duty with me as my assistant, and he\r\nhas had charge of the department of complaints. He is a very capable and\r\nefficient officer, and his services are very valuable to the bureau.\r\n\r\nAgain, I have occasion to return acknowledgments to Brigadier General\r\nJ.C. Veatch for his cordial assistance in aiding me to carry out the\r\nmeasures of the bureau, and also to Colonel Crandal and Lieutenant\r\nColonel McLaughlin, post commandants, for valuable aid; and to Brevet\r\nMajor General J.P. Hawkins we are indebted for that which makes the\r\ncolored man in reality a _free_ man.\r\n\r\nBelieving that with proper management and kind treatment the freedmen in\r\nwestern Louisiana will be found to be as industrious as laborers in other\r\nsections of the country,\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.B. STICKNEY,\r\n_Lieutenant and Assistant Superintendent Freedmen_.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS W. CONWAY,\r\n_Assistant Commissioner Bureau of Freedmen. &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 33.\r\n\r\nFREEDMEN'S BUREAU,\r\n\r\n_Shreveport, Louisiana, August_ 26, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: I have the honor to report, in accordance with orders, that in the\r\ndistrict under my supervision, comprising eight parishes in Louisiana and\r\ntwo counties in Texas, and an area of about 13,764 square miles, 3,105\r\ncontracts have been made, and 27,830 laborers enrolled since the first\r\nof July. The work of making contracts is now nearly completed, but the\r\nreturns for the month of August from the officers acting in the different\r\nparishes have not as yet been received. From the data already collected\r\nit will be safe to estimate the whole number of laborers working under\r\nthe contract system in the district at not less than 32,000, 25,000 of\r\nwhom are in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe experience of two months has demonstrated the fact that the negro will\r\nwork well when he is well paid and kindly treated; and another principle\r\nin the nature of the contracting parties has been equally as clearly\r\nelucidated, _i.e_., the planters are disposed to pay the freedmen the\r\nleast possible sum for their labor, and that for much compensation the\r\nfreedmen make an offset by making as little as possible. To acknowledge\r\nthe right of the negro to freedom, and to regard him as a free man\r\nentitled to the benefits of his labor and to all the privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizenship, is to throw aside the dogmas for which the\r\nsouth have been contending for the last thirty years, and seems to be too\r\ngreat a stride for the people to take at once, and too unpalatable a truth\r\nfor the aristocratic planter to comprehend, without the interposition of\r\nthe stern logic of the bayonet in the hands of a colored soldier. Duty to\r\nmy government compels me to report the following well-authenticated facts:\r\n\r\n1. Nineteen-twentieths of the planters have no disposition to pay the\r\nnegro well or treat him well.\r\n\r\n2. In the same proportion the planting aristocracy proffers obedience to\r\nthe government, and at the same time do all in their power to make\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n3. The planters evince a disposition to throw all the helpless and infirm\r\nfreedmen upon the hands of the government possible, in order to embarrass\r\nus and compel us to return them to slavery again.\r\n\r\n4. A majority of the planters desire to prevent the success of the\r\nfree-labor system, that they may force Congress to revive slavery, or,\r\nwhat is more, a system of peonage.\r\n\r\n5. The belief is general among the planters that without some means of\r\n\"controlling\" the persons of the laborers they cannot succeed; and for\r\nthis reason they desire to have the military force removed, and the\r\nprivilege of enacting such laws as will enable them to retain this power.\r\n\r\n6. To defraud, oppress, and maltreat the freedmen seems to be the\r\nprinciple governing the action of more than half of those who make\r\ncontracts with them.\r\n\r\n7. The lives of the freedmen are frequently threatened, and murders are\r\nnot of uncommon occurrence.\r\n\r\n8. The life of a northern man who is true to his country and the spirit\r\nand genius of its institutions, and frankly enunciates his principles, is\r\nnot secure where there is not a military force to protect him.\r\n\r\nAbout the 15th of July Corporal J.M. Wallace, of company B, forty-seventh\r\nIndiana Veteran volunteer infantry, was on duty with this bureau, and\r\nengaged in making contracts upon Red river, in the parish of Caddo. He\r\nvisited Mr. Daniel's plantation, and, as it is stated, started for Mr.\r\nWhite's place, but never reached it. Being absent unaccountably, a\r\nsergeant and a detail of four men were sent to look him up, but could\r\nfind no trace of him. Without doubt he was murdered. He was a young man\r\nof unexceptionable habits and character, and was highly esteemed by the\r\nofficers of his regiment. The circumstances of the case are such as to\r\nlead to the belief that the planters in the vicinity connived at his\r\ndeath. Captain Hoke, another agent of the bureau, was stopped by a\r\nhighwayman within eight miles of Shreveport. One of my assistants reports\r\nas follows: \"In the northern part of this parish (Cuddo) there are men\r\narmed and banded to resist the law.\" These facts prove that the presence\r\nof a military force is needed in every parish. Instead of the present\r\nsystem of districts, I would recommend that the officer for each parish\r\nreport direct to headquarters at New Orleans for instructions, and that\r\neach officer be furnished with at least twenty men, ten of whom should be\r\nmounted. I apprehend that at the commencement of the next year the\r\nplanters will endeavor to load us down with the aged and infirm, and\r\nthose with large families. To meet this and other difficulties that\r\nmay arise, I recommend that at least five thousand acres of land be\r\nconfiscated in every parish, and an opportunity given the freedmen to\r\nrent or purchase the land, and that every facility be afforded planters\r\nin the lower part of the State to obtain laborers from western Louisiana.\r\nAnother remedy has been suggested, and as it meets with my approval I\r\nquote the recommendations of the officer in his own words: \"Let the white\r\ntroops on duty in this department be mustered out; they are greatly\r\ndissatisfied with remaining in the service after the close of the war;\r\nlet black troops be mustered in their stead. In urging this matter, I\r\nsuggest that the government has the first right to the services of the\r\nfreedmen, and he needs the discipline of the army to develop his manhood\r\nand self-reliance. Such a course of recruiting black soldiers will act\r\nas a powerful restraint upon the abuses practiced by the planters on\r\nthe freedmen, and will also compel the payment of better wages. If the\r\nplanter wishes the services of a shrewd, enterprising freedman, he\r\nmust out-bid the government. Lastly, the country needs the soldiers.\r\nPoliticians may say what they may; western Louisiana is no more loyal\r\nnow than when the State adopted the ordinance of secession.\"\r\n\r\nThe statistics given at the commencement prove that we have experienced\r\nless difficulty with the freedmen than could have been expected. At times\r\nit has been necessary to adopt stringent measures to stem the tide of\r\nfreedmen that seemed to be setting in toward Shreveport, and many of them\r\nhave such vague ideas of the moral obligations of a contract that it has\r\nbeen necessary to strengthen them by imprisonment and hard labor; but the\r\ngreat and insuperable difficulty which meets us at every step is, _that\r\nthe planters and the freedmen have no confidence in and respect for each\r\nother_. The planters inform us that they are the best friends of the\r\nnegro, but the freedmen fail to see the matter in that light. I am well\r\nassured that as a general rule the old planters and overseers can never\r\nsucceed with the freedmen; that there must be an entire change in either\r\nlaborers or proprietors before the country will again be prosperous. The\r\nplan of renting lands to the freedmen, as proposed by a few planters, I\r\nam of the opinion will prove very profitable to both parties. While, as a\r\ngeneral rule, there is constant difficulty between the freedmen and their\r\nold masters and overseers, my agents and northern men have no trouble\r\nwith them; and should the planters employ practical farmers from the\r\nnorth as business managers, it seems to be well demonstrated that the\r\nfree-labor system, as it now is, with but slight modifications, would be\r\na grand success. In this connexion I cannot refrain from noticing the\r\nassertion of a southern politician to the effect \"that were the freedmen\r\nenfranchised, nine out of ten of them would vote for their old masters,\"\r\nwhich assertion every freedman will pronounce a wilful and malignant\r\nfalsehood.\r\n\r\nThe country is full of arms, and their use upon the freedmen is so\r\nfrequent, and the general disposition of the people such, that I would\r\nstrongly recommend, as a measure to secure the safety of life and\r\nproperty, that all classes of arms be taken from the citizens, not to be\r\nreturned until an entirely different disposition is evinced.\r\n\r\nThe system to be made binding for the next year should be published as\r\nearly as the 15th of October, and the matter of contracting be commenced\r\nas soon thereafter as the parties desire to do so. I would respectfully\r\nsuggest the propriety for calling of such statistical matter upon the\r\nback of the contract as will enable the officer in charge of the\r\neducational interests to determine the whole number of freedmen residing\r\nin the different parishes, and also the number of children of school age.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of schools will be met by the most venomous opposition,\r\nand a military force will be required to protect the teacher and scholars\r\nfrom insult and injury unless the tone of public sentiment improves very\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nThe civil authorities, so far as my knowledge extends, are not willing to\r\ngrant the freedmen the rights to which their freedom entitles them. In\r\nfact it became necessary, as will be seen by a former report, for the\r\nmilitary authorities to interfere to prevent their being virulently\r\noppressed. In consequence of this I have kept an officer constantly on\r\nduty adjusting the difficulties arising between the whites and negroes,\r\nbut important cases have been referred to the military authorities.\r\n\r\nChaplain Thomas Callahan, the officer referred to above, in his last\r\nreport says:\r\n\r\n\"To many of the planters the idea of a negro's testimony being as good as\r\na white man's is very unpleasant, and occasional attempts are made to\r\nbully and browbeat a colored witness upon the stand. The attempt is never\r\nmade twice. Once I pitted a lawyer against a negro witness, held the\r\nparties on the cross-examination, and the lawyer was badly beaten. Some\r\nof the freedmen can conduct a case with uncommon shrewdness.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot urge upon your attention too strongly the importance of keeping\r\nan officer in every parish and of providing him with a sufficient guard\r\nto command respect and enforce obedience to the laws. The presence of a\r\nmilitary force, with judicious and discreet officers to command it, is\r\nthe only means of securing to the freedmen their rights and of giving\r\nproper security to life and property.\r\n\r\nWith many thanks for that encouragement which has supported and cheered\r\nme through every difficulty, I have the honor to be, with much respect,\r\nyour most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.B.

You will see that\r\nnegroes who sell vegetables, cakes, &c., on the street are required to\r\npay ten dollars ($10) per month for the privilege of doing so.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the workings of this ordinance I will give you an actual\r\noccurrence in this city.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago an old negro man named Henderson, crippled with\r\nover-work, about seventy years of age, was sent to me for support by the\r\nmilitary authorities. I issued him rations for himself and wife, an old\r\nnegro woman, incapable of doing anything but care for herself. I\r\ncontinued this till about January 1, 1865, when the old man came to me\r\nand informed me that if I would allow him to sell apples and cakes to the\r\nsoldiers on a corner of the street near my office, under a large tree\r\nthat grew there, he thought he could care for himself and make enough to\r\nsupport himself and wife. I immediately gave him permission and an order\r\nto protect him. I had but little faith in his being able to do it, as he\r\nwas compelled to go on crutches and was bent nearly double, owing to a\r\nsevere whipping his old master had given him some years ago.\r\n\r\nHe commenced his work, and, much to my surprise, made enough to support\r\nhimself, and asked for no more assistance from me.\r\n\r\nWhen the city authorities took charge of the city matters the marshal of\r\nthe city ordered him to pay the ten dollars per month for the privilege\r\nof supporting himself or desist from such trade.\r\n\r\nThe old man told him that all his profits would not amount to ten dollars\r\nper month, and that in some months he did not make that amount of sales,\r\nbut, as Colonel Thomas provided him with a place to live, he could barely\r\nsupport himself by such trade. The marshal of the city informed him that\r\nthe tax must be paid by all, and that Colonel Thomas could take care of\r\nhim, as it was his duty to do so.\r\n\r\nThe old man came to my office and told me the whole affair. I wrote a\r\nletter to the mayor setting forth the whole case, and that the collection\r\nof this tax on such old cripples would compel me to support them, as they\r\ncould not pay the city ten dollars per month and make their support. In\r\nfact, ten dollars per month is the common wages for negro labor. The\r\nmayor refused to allow the negro to continue his sales, and I was\r\ncompelled to take charge of him. I would have refused to allow the city\r\nauthorities to interrupt him had it not been for General Orders No. 10,\r\nfrom headquarters department of Mississippi, allowing the mayor to take\r\ncharge of such matters.\r\n\r\nYou will see by the city ordinance that a drayman or hackman must file a\r\nbond of five hundred dollars in addition to paying for his license. The\r\nmayor requires that the bondsmen shall be freeholders. The laws of this\r\nState do not, and never did, allow a negro to own land or hold property.\r\nThe white citizens refuse to sign any bonds for the freedmen.\r\n\r\nThe white citizens and authorities say that it is for their interest to\r\ndrive out all independent negro labor; that the freedmen must hire to\r\nwhite men if they wish to do this kind of work.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL THOMAS,\r\n\r\n_Colonel, Assistant Commissioner Freedmen's Bureau, State of Mississippi_.\r\n\r\nMajor General C.

RANDOLPH, _Mayor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 37.\r\n\r\nFREEDMEN'S BUREAU, STATE OF MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\r\n_Office State Superintendent of Education,\r\n\r\nVicksburg, Miss., September_ 28, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: At the request of Colonel Thomas, I beg your attention to a few\r\nconsiderations touching the turning over of the care of the freedmen in\r\nMississippi to the State authorities, so far as the transfer bears upon\r\nthe religious and educational privileges of the colored people. Perhaps\r\nno one who has been less engaged in caring for the education and the\r\nmoral interests of these people can fully appreciate the facts that I\r\nintend to lay before you, or understand them as having the intensity of\r\nmeaning that I see in them.\r\n\r\nI have seen a good deal of the people of Mississippi, and have purposely\r\nsounded them as to their feelings with regard to the effort to educate\r\nthe blacks. The general feeling is that of strong opposition to it. Only\r\none person resident in Mississippi before the rebellion has expressed\r\nhimself to me as in favor of it, and he did not propose to do anything to\r\naid it; and, to show how much his favor was worth, he said he regretted\r\nthat he was not able to prevent the negroes from having shouting\r\nmeetings, and that he would keep them from going off the plantation to\r\nmeeting now if he could, as he formerly did. Aside from this gentleman,\r\nevery native Mississippian and Irishman with whom I have conversed\r\nopposes the instruction of freedmen. Some disguise their opposition by\r\naffected contemptuous disbelief of the negro's capacity. All the facts\r\nthat we can give them, however rich and suggestive, are received with\r\nsneering incredulity and the assurance that they know the negroes better\r\nthan we do. A little persistence in giving this class of men facts\r\ndisproving their assertions usually makes them angry, and leads them to\r\ndeclare that if the negroes can learn, the greater the damage that will\r\nbe done them, for the education will do them no good, and will spoil\r\nthem. Others take this last-mentioned ground at first, and say that a\r\nlearned negro is a nuisance; for, while he is ignorant, stupid, and\r\nloutish, he may be compelled to labor; but as soon as he comes to know\r\nsomething the white people cannot make so profitable use of him.\r\n\r\nSome manifest great spite when this subject is mentioned. They say we are\r\ntrying to make the negro equal with them. Many do not hesitate to say\r\nthat he ought to be kept uneducated in order that he may not be superior\r\nto ignorant white men.\r\n\r\nI have discovered that many object to the negro women's being educated\r\nlest they should be led to respect themselves, and not so easily be made\r\nthe instruments of the white man's lust.\r\n\r\nThe people of Vicksburg have asked Colonel Thomas to prevent the\r\nestablishment of colored schools within the city--they would probably\r\nsay, to preserve the peace of the city; but I feel sure it is because the\r\nsight of them gives pain. And if their removal ever becomes necessary to\r\nthe peace of a place, the fact will illustrate public feeling\r\nsufficiently.\r\n\r\nI have heard more than one person say that he would kill a colored\r\nteacher if he ever saw one.\r\n\r\nThe children of a community generally express the public feeling, and we\r\nmay usually learn from them what the feeling is, even when the parents,\r\nfrom prudence, seek to conceal it. Children often exaggerate, but they\r\nget their bias at home. The children of Mississippi throw stones at\r\ncolored scholars, and are only restrained by fear from mobbing colored\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nMy memorandum book contains such information as to points in the interior\r\nof the State as I can gather from officers, and from any reliable source,\r\nto guide me in locating teachers. Some of these memoranda are: \"Garrison\r\nwithdrawn; school impossible.\" \"No resident federal officer; a teacher\r\ncould not be protected.\" \"People much prejudiced; protection cannot be\r\nguaranteed.\" Such things are said in regard to every place not under\r\nnorthern protection. I think I do not overstate in saying that I do not\r\nknow a single northern man in Mississippi who supposes a colored school\r\npossible where there is no federal sword or bayonet. Some northern men do\r\nnot regret this fact, perhaps; and this makes their testimony on this\r\npoint more valuable.\r\n\r\nWhite churches recover their houses of worship which the blacks helped to\r\nbuild, and which they have repaired extensively during the last two\r\nyears, and remorselessly turn the blacks out without any regard to their\r\nrights in equity, their feelings, or their religious interests.\r\n\r\nI may state here that there is such a general expression of contempt for\r\nnegro religion, and such a desire to suppress it, if possible, that it\r\nseems as if the whites thought it a piece of terrible impertinence for\r\nthe blacks to worship the same God that we do. The white people also\r\nfear, or affect to fear, that opposition to their plans, and even\r\ninsurrection, will be hatched at the meetings of colored people. The\r\nNemesis of slavery still holds her whip over them. From this source arise\r\nthe occasional reports of intended insurrections; and these reports are\r\nintended, often, to cause the prevention of meetings, at which the\r\ncolored people may consult together, and convey information important to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn view of all these things, I have no doubt but that, if our protection\r\nbe withdrawn, negro education will be hindered in every possible way,\r\nincluding obstruction by fraud and violence. I have not the smallest\r\nexpectation that, with the State authorities in full power, a northern\r\ncitizen would be protected in the exercise of his constitutional right to\r\nteach and preach to the colored people; and shall look for a renewal of\r\nthe fearful scenes, in which northerners were whipped, tarred and\r\nfeathered, warned off, and murdered, before the war.\r\n\r\nI meant to make this letter shorter, but could not. I hope I need not\r\nassure you, general, that I am not conscious that any part of the above\r\ncomes of enmity to the south. I certainly should rejoice to see my\r\nopinion of the state of feeling in Mississippi falsified by patent facts.\r\n\r\nI have the honer to be, general, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOSEPH WARREN,\r\n_Chaplain, State Superintendent of Education_.\r\n\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 39.\r\n\r\nOFFICE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER BUREAU REFUGEES, FREEDMEN AND ABANDONED\r\nLANDS FOR STATE OF MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\r\n_Vicksburg, Mississippi, September 30, 1865_.\r\n\r\nGeneral: I see by the papers of a late date that Dr. Murdoch, of\r\nColumbus, Mississippi, has made a speech at General Howard's office, in\r\nwhich he makes strong promises of the hearty co-operation of his\r\nfellow-citizens in the education of the freedmen in the State.\r\n\r\nThe officer of this bureau at that place, Captain Hubbard, writes that\r\n\"the citizens of the place are so prejudiced against the negroes that\r\nthey are opposed to all efforts being made for their education or\r\nelevation; that the people will not give rooms, or allow the children of\r\ntheir hired freedmen to attend the schools; that the citizens of the\r\nplace have written a letter to the officer saying that they would\r\nrespectfully ask that no freedmen schools be established under the\r\nauspices of the bureau, as it would tend to disturb the present labor\r\nsystem, and take from the field labor that is so necessary to restore the\r\nwealth of the State.\" This is signed by half a dozen citizens purporting\r\nto represent the people, and certainly gives us a different idea of the\r\ncase from that stated by Dr. Murdoch.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nSAMUEL THOMAS,\r\n_Colonel, Assistant Commissioner for Mississippi_.\r\n\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 40.\r\n\r\n_To the Voters of Wilkinson county_:\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens: When I consented, some days ago, to be a candidate for\r\nthe State convention, I confess that, with some of my personal friends, I\r\nwas vain enough to believe that I was sufficiently well known to the\r\npeople of Wilkinson county to make it unnecessary for me to publish my\r\npolitical creed. But, to my surprise, it is rumored, to the prejudice of\r\nmy humble claim upon your suffrage, that I am an \"_unconditional,\r\nimmediate emancipationist--an abolitionist_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the freedom of casual, friendly conversation, it is certainly not\r\nunreasonable that I may, as any other man, be misunderstood. I cannot\r\nthink any of my fellow-citizens capable of misrepresenting me purposely.\r\nBut certain it is I am misunderstood if any man believes me to favor the\r\npolicy that wrongs and impoverishes my country. It does occur to me,\r\nfellow-citizens, that the _charity_, at least, if not the good sense of\r\nthose who know me, would contradict any such insinuation. True, I only\r\nclaim to have done my duty, but my record for the last four years, I\r\ntrust, is sufficient proof of my fidelity to the interests of the south\r\nand all her institutions. Can any man believe me now in favor of, and\r\nready to advocate, the abolition of an institution for which I have\r\ncontended so long, and which I am as fully persuaded to-day, as ever, was\r\nthe true status of the negro? Surely not.\r\n\r\nBut, fellow-citizens,--what I may, in common with you all, have to submit\r\nto, is a very different thing. Slavery has been taken from us. The power\r\nthat has already practically abolished the institution threatens totally\r\nand forever to abolish it. But does it follow that I am in favor of this\r\nthing? By no means. And, certainly, you who know me will not demand of me\r\nany further assurance than my antecedents afford that I will, as your\r\nrepresentative, should you elect me, \"do all and secure all\" I could for\r\nthe best interest of the State, and the rights and interests of a free\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI have thought, and have said, and do now repeat, that my honest\r\nconviction is, we must accept the situation as it is until we can get\r\ncontrol once more of our own State affairs. We cannot do otherwise and\r\nget our place again in the Union, and occupy a position, exert an\r\ninfluence, that will protect us against further and greater evils which\r\nthreaten us. I must, as any other man who votes or holds an office,\r\nsubmit, for the time, to evils I cannot remedy.\r\n\r\nI want it distinctly understood that _I do not run on \"Mr. Burruss's\r\nplatform,\" or any other man's, save my own_.\r\n\r\nShould you send me to the convention I will go committed, as I think an\r\nhonest man can only commit himself, i. e., according to my best judgment,\r\nand with an intention to guard all the blessings we now enjoy, to the\r\nextent of my ability, exert myself, as I have said, to secure all I can\r\nfor the interest of our State. If I cannot be trusted, then choose some\r\nother man, who may have shown himself hitherto, and is now, more truly\r\nyour friend, and who is, in your judgment, more capable of representing\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nW.L. BRANDON.\r\n\r\nWilkinson County, _August_ 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 41.\r\n\r\nOFFICE ACTING ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER BUREAU FREEDMEN, &c., FOR SOUTHERN\r\nDISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\r\n_Natchez, Miss., September_ 25, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: In obedience to your request, I have the honor to submit the\r\nfollowing as the result of my observations during the past year among\r\nfreedmen:\r\n\r\nThe opinion and feeling among the negroes throughout this district,\r\ncomprising the counties of Claiborne, Copiah, Lawrence, Covington, Jones,\r\nWayne, Jefferson, Franklin, Pike, Marion, Perry, Greene, Adams,\r\nWilkinson, Amite, Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson, and Concordia and\r\nTeusas parishes, Louisiana, are almost unanimous on one point, viz: they\r\nwill remain this year on their old places for a support, and such\r\nremuneration as the crop raised can give them, but next year they will\r\nleave and make other arrangements. They say that they have tried their\r\nold masters, know what they require, and how they will be treated, and\r\nthat, as they are now free, they will try some other place and some other\r\nway of working. They take this view not because they are tired of work,\r\nor because they want to be idle, but because they are free, and want to\r\nfind out in what their freedom consists.\r\n\r\nTo contend with the results of this opinion will be the great work flung\r\nupon the hands of some one next year. And not only will they have to see\r\nthat the laborers are properly settled, but they must provide for the\r\ncrippled, the helpless and the children. The planters cannot be made to\r\nsupport those who are too feeble to give any return, and who only remain\r\nbecause they are too old or too young to get away. What, then, is to\r\nbecome of them?\r\n\r\nAs to those who can labor, there will be no difficulty--the demand for\r\nlaborers will far exceed the supply. The great trouble will be to keep\r\nthe negro in the State, and to provide assistance for those who are\r\nunable to take care of themselves. Another want to be provided for is\r\nthat of education. If we are to have good, industrious, and law-abiding\r\npeople, we must provide some means for their education. It is intended to\r\nplace a teacher in every town in which schools can be established and\r\nprotected. From conversations with intelligent citizens, whom I feel\r\nassured, represent the feelings of a large class of people, I think that\r\nfor some time the equality of negroes and whites before the law, as\r\nregards testimony, will be merely an equality in name.\r\n\r\nCitizens say that their legislature may, and probably will, make laws\r\nreceiving the testimony of negroes in all cases, as a means of inducing\r\nthe government to re-admit them to a full exercise of their State\r\njurisdiction and representation, but that no southern jury can ever be\r\nfound that, when it comes to a case where twenty negroes testify one way,\r\nand two white men testify the other, will not decide in favor of the\r\nwhite, and virtually throw out the negro testimony. Of course this matter\r\nof testimony will settle itself with time, and a negro's word obtain the\r\nsame credit from his individual character as among whites, for the\r\nwhites, having cases that they are dependent upon negro testimony for,\r\nwill in the course of time be brought by their own interests to take and\r\ndemand the full benefit of the law; but for some time, although legally\r\nadmitted, it will in fact be excluded.\r\n\r\nThe report of Captain Warren Peck, a copy of which I have the honor to\r\nenclose, gives a very fair view of what the result would be, were the\r\nofficers of this bureau removed.\r\n\r\nWhen I took charge here I found a perfect state of terror among whites\r\nand blacks; but now that officers are thickly distributed over the\r\ndistrict, complaints are few, and the laborers are well, and, so far as\r\npossible, comfortably fixed for this year. Out of a negro population of\r\nover 75,000, only 649 receive rations from the government as destitutes.\r\n\r\nI feel no hesitation in saying that it is imperatively necessary to give\r\nthe system of free labor a fair trial, and to secure to the freedmen all\r\nthe benefits contemplated by the emancipation proclamation; that officers\r\nor agents should be retained whose duty it is to look after the interests\r\nof this large class of people, and see that they are gradually accustomed\r\nto manage their own business and protect their own interests.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient\r\nservant,\r\n\r\nGEORGE D. REYNOLDS,\r\n_Major 6th United States Colored Heavy Artillery, and Acting Assistant\r\nComm. Bureau of Freedmen, &c., Southern Dist. of Mississippi_.\r\n\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 42.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\r\n_Jackson, Miss., August_ 21, 1865.\r\n\r\nCaptain: I have the honor to enclose copies of a notice to form companies\r\nin this and a neighboring county, and of my letter to Governor Sharkey in\r\nreference to this matter. In a discussion which I had with the governor\r\nhe told me that it was his intention to raise a company of militia in\r\nevery county of the State, in accordance with the militia law of\r\nMississippi, mainly for the purpose of suppressing any acts of violence\r\nwhich the negroes may attempt to commit during next winter. I called the\r\nattention of the governor to the fact that the docket, until this day,\r\nexhibits only the name of white criminals, and that all information\r\nproves that almost all the cases of robbery, murder, &c., were brought in\r\nconnexion with young men in the country lately returned from military\r\nservice--just the very same men who, in all probability, would join the\r\nintended meetings to form companies of militia.\r\n\r\nThe result of the organization of such companies, while the State is\r\noccupied by United States troops, mostly colored, cannot be doubted--the\r\nheterogeneous element must clash and bring about a state of affairs which\r\ncertainly would prove detrimental to the peace and best interests of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sharkey tells me that he has applied to President Johnson for\r\nauthority to raise the militia, and that he would inform me of any\r\ndecision he may receive from Washington; in the mean time I consider it\r\nmy duty to take action as communicated in my letter, and respectfully\r\nrequest the approval of the major general commanding department. Very\r\nrespectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nP. JOS. OSTERHAUS,\r\n_Major General Volunteers_.\r\n\r\nCaptain J. WARREN MILLER, _A.A.

General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE, _Jackson, Miss., August_ 19, 1865.\r\n\r\nInformation having reached me that parties of bad men have banded\r\ntogether in different parts of the State for the purpose of robbing and\r\nplundering, and for violating the law in various ways, and that outrages\r\nof various kinds are being perpetrated, and the military authorities of\r\nthe United States being insufficient to protect the people throughout the\r\nentire State, I do therefore call upon the people, and especially on such\r\nas are liable to perform military duty, and are familiar with military\r\ndiscipline, to organize volunteer companies in each county in the State,\r\nif practicable, at least one company of cavalry and one of infantry, as\r\nspeedily as possible, for the detection of criminals, the prevention of\r\ncrime, and the preservation of good order. And I urge upon these\r\ncompanies, when formed, that they will be vigilant in the discharge of\r\nthese duties. These companies will be organized under the law in relation\r\nto volunteer companies as contained in the Revised Code, and the\r\namendment thereto, passed on the 10th of February, 1860, except that as\r\nsoon as the proper number shall volunteer, the election for officers may\r\ntake place immediately and without further order, and commissions will be\r\nissued as soon as returns are received, and the election may be held by\r\nany justice of the peace. I most earnestly call upon the young men of the\r\nState, who have so distinguished themselves for gallantry, to respond\r\npromptly to this call, which is made in behalf of a suffering people.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty, as I hope it will be the pleasure, of these\r\ncompanies to pursue and apprehend all offenders against law, and by\r\nvigilance to prevent crime, to aid the civil authorities, and to\r\ncontribute all in their power to the restoration of good order in the\r\ncommunity. Arms will be procured, if possible, for such as may not have\r\nthem, but I would advise an immediate organization with such arms as can\r\nbe procured.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the great seal of State affixed.\r\n\r\nW.L. SHARKEY,\r\n_Provisional Governor of Mississippi_.\r\n\r\nBy the Governor:\r\n\r\nJOHN H. ECHOLS,\r\n_Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\r\n_Jackson, Miss., August_ 22, 1865.\r\n\r\nCaptain: I have the honor to enclose copy of a letter received from\r\nGovernor Sharkey in reply to my communication of yesterday, copy of which\r\nwas sent you by last courier. The governor's proclamation, raising troops\r\nin the whole State, changes the status of things, as it no longer belongs\r\nto the limits of my district, but to the department; and, consequently, I\r\ndesist from all further action in the matter until your instructions have\r\ncome to hand.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the robberies, I will state that not a single _regular_\r\nstage, between Big Black and Jackson, has been earnestly interfered with;\r\nthey were permitted to run, without molestation, while the \"robbers\"\r\noperated against a Massachusetts schoolmaster, some darkies, and the\r\ngovernment messengers; not a house was entered in the vicinity of the\r\nfield of operations, not an inhabitant robbed. All \"home institutions\"\r\nare apparently safe. The inference is natural that these highway men are\r\nguerillas in the true sense of the word, and are waging a war against the\r\n\"invaders.\" The governor admits, very candidly, that he knows that the\r\npeople are reluctant to give aid to me by imparting information. Several\r\npersons who were halted by the \"robbers,\" but released with the excuse\r\nthat they were stopped by mistake, refused flatly to give any name, of\r\nthe party they were stopped by, but declared to know them.\r\n\r\nYou know, captain, that certain parties have importuned the governor,\r\nfrom the beginning, to raise the militia; and, as there was no cause for\r\nsuch a measure before, it probably was thought expedient to get up some\r\ncause for the desired purpose. Now we have the \"robberies\"--they are very\r\none-sided and extraordinary--but they furnished the cause so badly\r\nwanted. The governor is confident that a few squads of young men, armed\r\nwith fowling-pieces and the omnipresent revolvers, can suppress all\r\nirregularities, which the utmost vigilance and constant exertion of a\r\nlarge number of United States troops failed to suppress!\r\n\r\nI must state yet that the parties arrested under suspicion of\r\nparticipating in the described robberies are young men lately connected\r\nwith the rebel army. There is no doubt on my mind that the young men \"who\r\nsteal the despatches from our messengers\" will become good members of the\r\nintended militia.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nP.

General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS NORTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\r\n_Jackson, Miss., August_ 21, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: A notice appears in yesterday's paper, over the signature of Lamar\r\nFontaine, calling on the young men of Hinds and Madison counties to meet\r\nat Cooper Wells and at Livingstone, respectively, on the 22d and 24th\r\ninstant, for the purpose of organizing companies and electing officers.\r\n\r\nThe notice creates the impression that some kind of military organization\r\nis intended, and in that event I would beg leave to call your attention\r\nto the fact that the State of Mississippi is under occupation, and that\r\nmartial law is still in force, and that no military organizations can be\r\ntolerated which are not under the control of the United States officers.\r\nI am, therefore, in duty bound and compelled to prevent and prohibit all\r\nmilitary organization not recognized as a portion of the United States\r\nforces, unless they are formed under special authority of the War\r\nDepartment, or the major general commanding the department of\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nI can assure your excellency that the number of troops in the counties of\r\nHinds and Madison is amply sufficient to give the civil authorities all\r\nthe assistance they may possibly need, and the means at my disposal are\r\namply sufficient to stop all crime, provided the civil authorities will\r\nco-operate sincerely with the military commanders, and furnish\r\ninformation promptly and voluntarily, as the public peace and safety\r\nrequire them to do.\r\n\r\nI respectfully request that you will communicate the tenor of this\r\ncommunication to Mr. Fontaine.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, with great esteem, your excellency's obedient servant,\r\n\r\nP.

GORDON,\r\nA.A.G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE, _Jackson, Miss., August_ 22, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\ncommunication of yesterday, in which you call my attention to the fact\r\nthat the State of Mississippi is still under military occupation, and\r\nthat martial law is still in force, and that no military organizations\r\ncan be tolerated which are not under the control of United States\r\nofficers; and you add that you will feel bound to prevent such\r\norganizations, and you also assure me that you have sufficient troops in\r\nthe counties of Hinds and Madison to aid the civil authorities. This last\r\nremark was made by you with reference to a particular organization which\r\nhas been proposed in those counties. I have, however, issued a general\r\norder on this subject, a copy of which I hand you, regretting that you\r\nhave felt yourself compelled to take this view of the subject, and I know\r\nyou are prompted by a sense of duty. I beg to remind you that for twelve\r\nor fifteen consecutive nights passengers travelling in the stage between\r\nhere and Vicksburg have been robbed, and these things have occurred\r\nwithin twelve or fifteen miles of your own headquarters. I would not be\r\nunderstood as reflecting in the slightest degree on you. I know you have\r\nevery desire to prevent such occurrences, and will use every means in\r\nyour power to do so, and to arrest the culprits. I know, too, that the\r\npeople are reluctant to give you aid by imparting information to you,\r\nbut, in addition to these robberies, information daily reaches me of the\r\nperpetration of outrages, committed in various ways in distant parts of\r\nthe--State where you have no military force. The people are calling on me\r\nfor protection, which I cannot give them under existing circumstances,\r\nand it was to give them relief that the military organizations have been\r\nordered. If further justification be necessary, I may add in the last\r\ninterview I had with the President, in speaking of anticipated troubles,\r\nhe distinctly stated to me that I could organize the militia if it should\r\nbecome necessary. I think the necessity is now manifest, and therefore\r\nclaim the authority of the President of the United States for my action.\r\nIt was precisely under this authority that in my proclamation of the 1st\r\nof July I called upon the people in unprotected counties to organize for\r\ntheir security. I will also state that the President has been apprised of\r\nwhat I am doing in this respect, and when he shall change his\r\ninstructions I will, of course, yield obedience; but until he shall do\r\nso, I shall feel it to be my duty to carry out the line of policy I have\r\nadopted. I need scarcely assure you, general, that this is not in any\r\nsense a hostile demonstration, and feel quite sure no evil can result\r\nfrom it. Mississippi has spoken too plainly in her convention to leave\r\nany doubt about her future purposes.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, with great respect, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.L.

Kiley and son, in Newton county, in this State, for\r\nsimply remonstrating against whipping her son. Lucinda, a colored woman,\r\nin Yalobusha county, was stripped naked, tied to a tree, and severely\r\nwhipped by three men, names unknown. In the county of Holmes, between the\r\n5th and 15th days of September, 1865, five negroes were murdered; names\r\nof the perpetrators unknown. In Simpson county, about the 1st of August,\r\na father and his two sons cruelly whipped and abused a colored woman in\r\ntheir employ. Near Lauderdale Springs, Castwell Eads, a citizen, by his\r\nown statement, shot and wounded a colored man for simply refusing to obey\r\nhis command, _halt_! while he was running from him after being cruelly\r\nwhipped. In Smith county, S.S. Catchings, a citizen, followed a colored\r\nman, who had left his plantation, overtook him, knocked him down, and\r\nbeat him brutally.\r\n\r\nThese are all the cases of which I have detailed accounts, none but\r\ngeneral reports having yet been received from the agents. These indicate\r\nthat cruelty is frequently practiced.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nE.S. DONALDSON,\r\n_Lieutenant Colonel, Acting Assistant Commissioner_.\r\n\r\nMajor W.A. GORDON,\r\n_Assistant Adjutant General_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 44.\r\n\r\nSavannah, Ga., _August_ 1, 1865.\r\n\r\nGeneral: In answer to your question with regard to free labor at the\r\nSouth, and particularly the way in which the contract system is viewed by\r\npersons who were formerly slaveholders, I would state that these persons\r\naccept the present condition of affairs as an alternative forced upon\r\nthem, believing still that the emancipation of their slaves was a great\r\nblunder, and that slavery is the only system by which the colored laborer\r\ncan be made profitable to his employer.\r\n\r\nWithin this district the plantation contracts now in force were entered\r\ninto just subsequent to the arrival of the army, and when it was\r\nimpossible for planters to undertake the care of their plantations. The\r\nnegroes, therefore, planted for themselves, promising the owner a fair\r\nproportion of the crop as rent for the use of the land.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the matter comes up in a different shape. Owners have\r\nreturned, and it is necessary to make arrangements for the next season.\r\nMost of them complain and find fault with the government, and remain\r\ninactive. So long as the military form prevails they seem to submit and\r\nto conform to present requirements, but at heart they are unfriendly.\r\nSome few, however, ask of us what we are going to do with the negro, and\r\nwhat provision will be made with regard to labor. There is nothing in\r\ntheir conduct that betokens sympathy with our movements, or a desire to\r\nco-operate with us earnestly in our work. The rebel spirit is as bitter\r\nas ever in the minds of the southern people. To return to the old customs\r\nis now their effort, and step by step they would take us back to where we\r\nwere when the war broke out. They will contract with the freedmen, not\r\nbecause they prefer to, but because they are obliged to, and so long as\r\nthe authority of the United States is present for the protection of all\r\nparties, and to compel a faithful performance, the agreement will be\r\ncarried out; but should the army be withdrawn, the freedmen would\r\nvirtually be reduced to slavery, and freedom-loving men would find a\r\nsouthern residence unsafe.\r\n\r\nI think the negro is disposed to fulfil his contract, and in cases where\r\nit has seemed otherwise, the other party has often been at fault.\r\n\r\nWhile I have met a few planters who seem to realize that emancipation is\r\na fixed fact, and that they must make the most of present circumstances,\r\nby resorting to the only means by which labor can now be obtained, (the\r\ncontract system,) I have found scarcely one who will enter into the\r\nmatter with any kind of sympathy, or with either the belief or the hope\r\nthat our plans will eventually succeed, for they feel keenly that the\r\nsuccess of those plans will prove the foolishness of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe coming year will produce a change of opinion at the South, I think,\r\nif by thorough supervision we secure protection to free labor.\r\n\r\nI am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nA.P. KETCHUM.\r\nMajor General CARL SCHURZ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF GENERAL GRANT CONCERNING AFFAIRS AT THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\nHEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n_Washington, D.C., December_ 18, 1865.\r\n\r\nSir: In reply to your note of the 16th instant, requesting a report from\r\nme giving such information as I may be possessed of coming within the\r\nscope of the inquiries made by the Senate of the United States in their\r\nresolution of the 12th instant, I have the honor to submit the following:\r\n\r\nWith your approval, and also that of the honorable Secretary of War, I\r\nleft Washington city on the 27th of last month for the purpose of making\r\na tour of inspection through some of the southern States, or States\r\nlately in rebellion, and to see what changes were necessary to be made in\r\nthe disposition of the military forces of the country; how these forces\r\ncould be reduced and expenses curtailed, &c.; and to learn, as far as\r\npossible, the feelings and intentions of the citizens of those States\r\ntowards the general government.\r\n\r\nThe State of Virginia being so accessible to Washington city, and\r\ninformation from this quarter, therefore, being readily obtained, I\r\nhastened through the State without conversing or meeting with any of its\r\ncitizens. In Raleigh, North Carolina, I spent one day; in Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, two days; Savannah and Augusta, Georgia, each one day.\r\nBoth in travelling and whilst stopping I saw much and conversed freely\r\nwith the citizens of those States as well as with officers of the army\r\nwho have been stationed among them. The following are the conclusions\r\ncome to by me.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the mass of thinking men of the south accept the\r\npresent situation of affairs in good faith. The questions which have\r\nheretofore divided the sentiment of the people of the two\r\nsections--slavery and State rights, or the right of a State to secede\r\nfrom the Union--they regard as having been settled forever by the highest\r\ntribunal--arms--that man can resort to. I was pleased to learn from the\r\nleading men whom I met that they not only accepted the decision arrived\r\nat as final, but, now that the smoke of battle has cleared away and time\r\nhas been given for reflection, that this decision has been a fortunate\r\none for the whole country, they receiving like benefits from it with\r\nthose who opposed them in the field and in council.\r\n\r\nFour years of war, during which law was executed only at the point of the\r\nbayonet throughout the States in rebellion, have left the people possibly\r\nin a condition not to yield that ready obedience to civil authority the\r\nAmerican people have generally been in the habit of yielding. This would\r\nrender the presence of small garrisons throughout those States necessary\r\nuntil such time as labor returns to its proper channel, and civil\r\nauthority is fully established. I did not meet any one, either those\r\nholding places under the government or citizens of the southern States,\r\nwho think it practicable to withdraw the military from the south at\r\npresent. The white and the black mutually require the protection of the\r\ngeneral government.\r\n\r\nThere is stick universal acquiescence in the authority of the general\r\ngovernment throughout the portions of country visited by me, that the\r\nmere presence of a military force, without regard to numbers, is\r\nsufficient to maintain order. The good of the country, and economy,\r\nrequire that the force kept in the interior, where there are many\r\nfreedmen, (elsewhere in the southern States than at forts upon the\r\nseacoast no force is necessary,) should all be white troops. The reasons\r\nfor this are obvious without mentioning many of them. The presence of\r\nblack troops, lately slaves, demoralizes labor, both by their advice and\r\nby furnishing in their camps a resort for the freedmen for long distances\r\naround. White troops generally excite no opposition, and therefore a\r\nsmall number of them can maintain order in a given district. Colored\r\ntroops must be kept in bodies sufficient to defend themselves. It is not\r\nthe thinking men who would use violence towards any class of troops sent\r\namong them by the general government, but the ignorant in some places\r\nmight; and the late slave seems to be imbued with the idea that the\r\nproperty of his late master should, by right, belong to him, or at least\r\nshould have no protection from the colored soldier. There is danger of\r\ncollisions being brought on by such causes.\r\n\r\nMy observations lead me to the conclusion that the citizens of the\r\nsouthern States are anxious to return to self-government, within the\r\nUnion, as soon as possible; that whilst reconstructing they want and\r\nrequire protection from the government; that they are in earnest in\r\nwishing to do what they think is required by the government, not\r\nhumiliating to them as citizens, and that if such a course were pointed\r\nout they would pursue it in good faith. It is to be regretted that there\r\ncannot be a greater commingling, at this time, between the citizens of\r\nthe two sections, and particularly of those intrusted with the law-making\r\npower.\r\n\r\nI did not give the operations of the Freedmen's Bureau that attention I\r\nwould have done if more time had been at my disposal. Conversations on\r\nthe subject, however, with officers connected with the bureau, lead me to\r\nthink that, in some of the States, its affairs have not been conducted\r\nwith good judgment or economy, and that the belief, widely spread among\r\nthe freedmen of the southern States, that the lands of their former\r\nowners will, at least in part, be divided among them, has come from the\r\nagents of this bureau. This belief is seriously interfering with the\r\nwillingness of the freedmen to make contracts for the coming year. In\r\nsome form the Freedmen's Bureau is an absolute necessity until civil law\r\nis established and enforced, securing to the freedmen their rights and\r\nfull protection. At present, however, it is independent of the military\r\nestablishment of the country, and seems to be operated by the different\r\nagents of the bureau according to their individual notions. Everywhere\r\nGeneral Howard, the able head of the bureau, made friends by the just and\r\nfair instructions and advice he gave; but the complaint in South Carolina\r\nwas that when he left, things went on as before. Many, perhaps the\r\nmajority, of the agents of the Freedmen's Bureau advise the freedmen that\r\nby their own industry they must expect to live. To this end they endeavor\r\nto secure employment for them, and to see that both contracting parties\r\ncomply with their engagements. In some instances, I am sorry to say, the\r\nfreedman's mind does not seem to be disabused of the idea that a freedman\r\nhas the right to live without care or provision for the future. The\r\neffect of the belief in division of lands is idleness and accumulation in\r\ncamps, towns, and cities. In such cases I think it will be found that\r\nvice and disease will tend to the extermination or great reduction of the\r\ncolored race. It cannot be expected that the opinions held by men at the\r\nsouth for years can be changed in a day, and therefore the freedmen\r\nrequire, for a few years, not only laws to protect them, but the\r\nfostering care of those who will give them good counsel, and on whom\r\nthey rely.\r\n\r\nThe Freedmen's Bureau being separated from the military establishment of\r\nthe country, requires all the expense of a separate organization. One\r\ndoes not necessarily know what the other is doing, or what orders they\r\nare acting under. It seems to me this could be corrected by regarding\r\nevery officer on duty with troops in the southern States as an agent\r\nof the Freedmen's Bureau, and then have all orders from the head of\r\nthe bureau sent through department commanders. This would create a\r\nresponsibility that would secure uniformity of action throughout all the\r\nsouth; would insure the orders and instructions from the head of the\r\nbureau being carried out, and would relieve from duty and pay a large\r\nnumber of employees of the government.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nU.S. GRANT,\r\n_Lieutenant General_.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency ANDREW JOHNSON,\r\n_President of the United States_.",
