With the exception of the style, this report is written\r\nexactly the way I would have written it had I been officially asked\r\nto do so while I was chief of the Air Force's project for\r\ninvestigating UFO reports--Project Blue Book.\r\n\r\nIn many instances I have left out the names of the people who\r\nreported seeing UFO's, or the names of certain people who were\r\nassociated with the project, just as I would have done in an official\r\nreport. For the same reason I have changed the locale in which some\r\nof the UFO sightings occurred. This is especially true in chapter\r\nfifteen, the story of how some of our atomic scientists detected\r\nradiation whenever UFO's were reported near their \"UFO-detection\r\nstations.\" This policy of not identifying the \"source,\" to borrow a\r\nterm from military intelligence, is insisted on by the Air Force so\r\nthat the people who have co-operated with them will not get any\r\nunwanted publicity. Names are considered to be \"classified\r\ninformation.\"\r\n\r\nBut the greatest care has been taken to make sure that the omission\r\nof names and changes in locale has in no way altered the basic facts\r\nbecause this report is based on the facts--all of the facts--nothing\r\nof significance has been left out.\r\n\r\nIt was only after considerable deliberation that I put this report\r\ntogether, because it had to be told accurately, with no holds barred.\r\nI finally decided to do it for two reasons. First, there is world-\r\nwide interest in flying saucers; people want to know the facts. But\r\nmore often than not these facts have been obscured by secrecy and\r\nconfusion, a situation that has led to wild speculation on one end of\r\nthe scale and an almost dangerously blas? attitude on the other. It\r\nis only when all of the facts are laid out that a correct evaluation\r\ncan be made.\r\n\r\nSecond, after spending two years investigating and analyzing UFO\r\nreports, after talking to the people who have seen UFO's--\r\nindustrialists, pilots, engineers, generals, and just the plain man-\r\non-the-street, and after discussing the subject with many very\r\ncapable scientists, I felt that I was in a position to be able to put\r\ntogether the complete account of the Air Force's struggle with the\r\nflying saucer.\r\n\r\nThe report has been difficult to write because it involves something\r\nthat doesn't officially exist. It is well known that ever since the\r\nfirst flying saucer was reported in June 1947 the Air Force has\r\nofficially said that there is no proof that such a thing as an\r\ninterplanetary spaceship exists. But what is not well known is that\r\nthis conclusion is far from being unanimous among the military and\r\ntheir scientific advisers because of the one word, _proof_; so the\r\nUFO investigations continue.\r\n\r\nThe hassle over the word \"proof\" boils down to one question: What\r\nconstitutes proof? Does a UFO have to land at the River Entrance to\r\nthe Pentagon, near the Joint Chiefs of Staff offices? Or is it proof\r\nwhen a ground radar station detects a UFO, sends a jet to intercept\r\nit, the jet pilot sees it, and locks on with his radar, only to have\r\nthe UFO streak away at a phenomenal speed? Is it proof when a jet\r\npilot fires at a UFO and sticks to his story even under the threat of\r\ncourt-martial? Does this constitute proof?\r\n\r\nThe at times hotly debated answer to this question may be the answer\r\nto the question, \"Do the UFO's really exist?\"\r\n\r\nI'll give you the facts--all of the facts--you decide.\r\n\r\n_July_ _1955_, E. J. RUPPELT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\nProject Blue Book and the UFO Story\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1952 a United States Air Force F-86 jet interceptor\r\nshot at a flying saucer.\r\n\r\nThis fact, like so many others that make up the full flying saucer\r\nstory, has never before been told.\r\n\r\nI know the full story about flying saucers and I know that it has\r\nnever before been told because I organized and was chief of the Air\r\nForce's Project Blue Book, the special project set up to investigate\r\nand analyze unidentified flying object, or UFO, reports. (UFO is the\r\nofficial term that I created to replace the words \"flying saucers.\")\r\n\r\nThere is a fighter base in the United States which I used to visit\r\nfrequently because, during 1951, 1952, and 1953, it got more than its\r\nshare of good UFO reports.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer of the fighter group, a full colonel and\r\ncommand pilot, believed that UFO's were real. The colonel believed in\r\nUFO's because he had a lot of faith in his pilots--and they had\r\nchased UFO's in their F-86's. He had seen UFO's on the scopes of his\r\nradar sets, and he knew radar.\r\n\r\nThe colonel's intelligence officer, a captain, didn't exactly\r\nbelieve that UFO's were real, but he did think that they warranted\r\ncareful investigation. The logic the intelligence officer used in\r\ninvestigating UFO reports--and in getting answers to many of them--\r\nmade me wish many times that he worked for me on Project Blue Book.\r\n\r\nOne day the intelligence officer called me at my base in Dayton,\r\nOhio. He wanted to know if I was planning to make a trip his way\r\nsoon. When I told him I expected to be in his area in about a week,\r\nhe asked me to be sure to look him up. There was no special hurry, he\r\nadded, but he had something very interesting to show me.\r\n\r\nWhen we got wind of a good story, Project Blue Book liked to start\r\nworking on it at once, so I asked the intelligence officer to tell me\r\nwhat he had. But nothing doing. He didn't want to discuss it over the\r\nphone. He even vetoed the idea of putting it into a secret wire. Such\r\nextreme caution really stopped me, because anything can be coded and\r\nput in a wire.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Dayton about a week later I decided to go straight to\r\nthe fighter base, planning to arrive there in midmorning. But while I\r\nwas changing airlines my reservations got fouled up, and I was faced\r\nwith waiting until evening to get to the base. I called the\r\nintelligence officer and told him about the mix-up. He told me to\r\nhang on right there and he would fly over and pick me up in a T-33 jet.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we were in the air, on the return trip, I called the\r\nintelligence officer on the interphone and asked him what was going\r\non. What did he have? Why all the mystery? He tried to tell me, but\r\nthe interphone wasn't working too well and I couldn't understand what\r\nhe was saying. Finally he told me to wait until we returned to his\r\noffice and I could read the report myself.\r\n\r\nReport! If he had a UFO report why hadn't he sent it in to Project\r\nBlue Book as he usually did?\r\n\r\nWe landed at the fighter base, checked in our parachutes, Mae Wests,\r\nand helmets, and drove over to his office. There were several other\r\npeople in the office, and they greeted me with the usual question,\r\n\"What's new on the flying saucer front?\" I talked with them for a\r\nwhile, but was getting impatient to find out what was on the\r\nintelligence officer's mind. I was just about to ask him about the\r\nmysterious report when he took me to one side and quietly asked me\r\nnot to mention it until everybody had gone.\r\n\r\nOnce we were alone, the intelligence officer shut the door, went\r\nover to his safe, and dug out a big, thick report. It was the\r\nstandard Air Force reporting form that is used for all intelligence\r\nreports, including UFO reports. The intelligence officer told me that\r\nthis was the only existing copy. He said that he had been told to\r\ndestroy all copies, but had saved one for me to read.\r\n\r\nWith great curiosity, I took the report and started to read. What\r\n_had_ happened at this fighter base?\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock in the morning, one day a few weeks before, a\r\nradar near the base had picked up an unidentified target. It was an\r\nodd target in that it came in very fast--about 700 miles per hour--\r\nand then slowed down to about 100 miles per hour. The radar showed\r\nthat it was located northeast of the airfield, over a sparsely\r\nsettled area.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the radar station didn't have any height-finding\r\nequipment. The operators knew the direction of the target and its\r\ndistance from the station but they didn't know its altitude. They\r\nreported the target, and two F-86's were scrambled.\r\n\r\nThe radar picked up the F-86's soon after they were airborne, and\r\nhad begun to direct them into the target when the target started to\r\nfade on the radarscope. At the time several of the operators thought\r\nthat this fade was caused by the target's losing altitude rapidly and\r\ngetting below the radar's beam. Some of the other operators thought\r\nthat it was a high-flying target and that it was fading just because\r\nit was so high.\r\n\r\nIn the debate which followed, the proponents of the high-flying\r\ntheory won out, and the F-86's were told to go up to 40,000 feet. But\r\nbefore the aircraft could get to that altitude, the target had been\r\ncompletely lost on the radarscope.\r\n\r\nThe F-86's continued to search the area at 40,000 feet, but could\r\nsee nothing. After a few minutes the aircraft ground controller\r\ncalled the F-86's and told one to come down to 20,000 feet, the other\r\nto 5,000 feet, and continue the search. The two jets made a quick\r\nletdown, with one pilot stopping at 20,000 feet and the other heading\r\nfor the deck.\r\n\r\nThe second pilot, who was going down to 5,000 feet, was just\r\nbeginning to pull out when he noticed a flash below and ahead of him.\r\nHe flattened out his dive a little and headed toward the spot where\r\nhe had seen the light. As he closed on the spot he suddenly noticed\r\nwhat he first thought was a weather balloon. A few seconds later he\r\nrealized that it couldn't be a balloon because it was staying ahead\r\nof him. Quite an achievement for a balloon, since he had built up a\r\nlot of speed in his dive and now was flying almost straight and level\r\nat 3,000 feet and was traveling \"at the Mach.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the pilot pushed the nose of the F-86 down and started after\r\nthe object. He closed fairly fast, until he came to within an\r\nestimated 1,000 yards. Now he could get a good look at the object.\r\nAlthough it had looked like a balloon from above, a closer view\r\nshowed that it was definitely round and flat--saucer-shaped. The\r\npilot described it as being \"like a doughnut without a hole.\"\r\n\r\nAs his rate of closure began to drop off, the pilot knew that the\r\nobject was picking up speed. But he pulled in behind it and started\r\nto follow. Now he was right on the deck.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the pilot began to get a little worried. What should\r\nhe do? He tried to call his buddy, who was flying above him somewhere\r\nin the area at 20,000 feet. He called two or three times but could\r\nget no answer. Next he tried to call the ground controller but he was\r\ntoo low for his radio to carry that far. Once more he tried his buddy\r\nat 20,000 feet, but again no luck.\r\n\r\nBy now he had been following the object for about two minutes and\r\nduring this time had closed the gap between them to approximately 500\r\nyards. But this was only momentary. Suddenly the object began to pull\r\naway, slowly at first, then faster. The pilot, realizing that he\r\ncouldn't catch _it_, wondered what to do next.\r\n\r\nWhen the object traveled out about 1,000 yards, the pilot suddenly\r\nmade up his mind--he did the only thing that he could do to stop the\r\nUFO. It was like a David about to do battle with a Goliath, but he\r\nhad to take a chance. Quickly charging his guns, he started shooting.\r\n. . . A moment later the object pulled up into a climb and in a few\r\nseconds it was gone. The pilot climbed to 10,000 feet, called the\r\nother F-86, and now was able to contact his buddy. They joined up and\r\nwent back to their base.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had landed and parked, the F-86 pilot went into\r\noperations to tell his story to his squadron commander. The mere fact\r\nthat he had fired his guns was enough to require a detailed report,\r\nas a matter of routine. But the circumstances under which the guns\r\nactually were fired created a major disturbance at the fighter base\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nAfter the squadron commander had heard his pilot's story, he called\r\nthe group commander, the colonel, and the intelligence officer. They\r\nheard the pilot's story.\r\n\r\nFor some obscure reason there was a \"personality clash,\" the\r\nintelligence officer's term, between the pilot and the squadron\r\ncommander. This was obvious, according to the report I was reading,\r\nbecause the squadron commander immediately began to tear the story\r\napart and accuse the pilot of \"cracking up,\" or of just \"shooting his\r\nguns for the hell of it and using the wild story as a cover-up.\"\r\n\r\nOther pilots in the squadron, friends of the accused pilot--\r\nincluding the intelligence officer and a flight surgeon--were called\r\nin to \"testify.\" All of these men were aware of the fact that in\r\ncertain instances a pilot can \"flip\" for no good reason, but none of\r\nthem said that he had noticed any symptoms of mental crack-up in the\r\nunhappy pilot.\r\n\r\nNone, except the squadron commander. He kept pounding home his idea--\r\nthat the pilot was \"psycho\"--and used a few examples of what the\r\nreport called \"minor incidents\" to justify his stand.\r\n\r\nFinally the pilot who had been flying with the \"accused\" man was\r\ncalled in. He said that he had been monitoring the tactical radio\r\nchannel but that he hadn't heard any calls from his buddy's low-\r\nflying F-86. The squadron commander triumphantly jumped on this\r\npoint, but the accused pilot tended to refute it by admitting he was\r\nso jumpy that he might not have been on the right channel. But when\r\nhe was asked if he had checked or changed channels after he had lost\r\nthe object and before he had finally contacted the other F-86, he\r\ncouldn't remember.\r\n\r\nSo ended the pilot's story and his interrogation.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence officer wrote up his report of a UFO sighting, but\r\nat the last minute, just before sending it, he was told to hold it\r\nback. He was a little unhappy about this turn of events, so he went\r\nin to see why the group commander had decided to delay sending the\r\nreport to Project Blue Book.\r\n\r\nThey talked over the possible reactions to the report. If it went\r\nout it would cause a lot of excitement, maybe unnecessarily. Yet, if\r\nthe pilot actually had seen what he claimed, it was vitally important\r\nto get the report in to ATIC immediately. The group commander said\r\nthat he would made his decision after a talk with his executive\r\nofficer. They decided not to send the report and ordered it destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished reading, the intelligence officer's first comment\r\nwas, \"What do you think?\"\r\n\r\nSince the evaluation of the report seemed to hinge upon conflicts\r\nbetween personalities I didn't know, I could venture no opinion,\r\nexcept that the incident made up the most fascinating UFO report I'd\r\never seen. So I batted the intelligence officer's question back to him.\r\n\r\n\"I know the people involved,\" he replied, \"and I don't think the\r\npilot was nuts. I can't give you the report, because Colonel ------\r\ntold me to destroy it. But I did think you should know about it.\"\r\nLater he burned the report.\r\n\r\nThe problems involved in this report are typical. There are certain\r\ndefinite facts that can be gleaned from it; the pilot did see\r\nsomething and he did shoot at something, but no matter how thoroughly\r\nyou investigate the incident that something can never be positively\r\nidentified. It might have been a hallucination or it might have been\r\nsome vehicle from outer space; no one will ever know. It was a UFO.\r\n\r\nThe UFO story started soon after June 24, 1947, when newspapers all\r\nover the United States carried the first flying saucer report. The\r\nstory told how nine very bright, disk-shaped objects were seen by\r\nKenneth Arnold, a Boise, Idaho, businessman, while he was flying his\r\nprivate plane near Mount Rainier, in the state of Washington. With\r\njournalistic license, reporters converted Arnold's description of the\r\nindividual motion of each of the objects--like \"a saucer skipping\r\nacross water\"--into \"flying saucer,\" a name for the objects\r\nthemselves. In the eight years that have passed since Arnold's\r\nmemorable sighting, the term has become so common that it is now in\r\nWebster's Dictionary and is known today in most languages in the world.\r\n\r\nFor a while after the Arnold sighting the term \"flying saucer\" was\r\nused to describe all disk-shaped objects that were seen flashing\r\nthrough the sky at fantastic speeds. Before long, reports were made\r\nof objects other than disks, and these were also called flying\r\nsaucers. Today the words are popularly applied to anything seen in\r\nthe sky that cannot be identified as a common, everyday object.\r\n\r\nThus a flying saucer can be a formation of lights, a single light, a\r\nsphere, or any other shape; and it can be any color. Performance-wise,\r\nflying saucers can hover, go fast or slow, go high or low, turn 90-\r\ndegree corners, or disappear almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\nObviously the term \"flying saucer\" is misleading when applied to\r\nobjects of every conceivable shape and performance. For this reason\r\nthe military prefers the more general, if less colorful, name:\r\nunidentified flying objects. UFO (pronounced Yoo-foe) for short.\r\n\r\nOfficially the military uses the term \"flying saucer\" on only two\r\noccasions. First in an explanatory sense, as when briefing people who\r\nare unacquainted with the term \"UFO\": \"UFO--you know--flying\r\nsaucers.\" And second in a derogatory sense, for purposes of ridicule,\r\nas when it is observed, \"He says he saw a flying saucer.\"\r\n\r\nThis second form of usage is the exclusive property of those persons\r\nwho positively know that all UFO's are nonsense. Fortunately, for the\r\nsake of good manners if for no other reason, the ranks of this\r\nknowing category are constantly dwindling. One by one these people\r\ndrop out, starting with the instant they see their first UFO.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after the first UFO was seen on June 24, 1947, the Air\r\nForce established a project to investigate and analyze all UFO\r\nreports. The attitude toward this task varied from a state of near\r\npanic, early in the life of the project, to that of complete contempt\r\nfor anyone who even mentioned the words \"flying saucer.\"\r\n\r\nThis contemptuous attitude toward \"flying saucer nuts\" prevailed\r\nfrom mid-1949 to mid-1950. During that interval many of the people\r\nwho were, or had been, associated with the project believed that the\r\npublic was suffering from \"war nerves.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in 1950 the project, for all practical purposes, was closed\r\nout; at least it rated only minimum effort. Those in power now\r\nreasoned that if you didn't mention the words \"flying saucers\" the\r\npeople would forget them and the saucers would go away. But this\r\nreasoning was false, for instead of vanishing, the UFO reports got\r\nbetter and better.\r\n\r\nAirline pilots, military pilots, generals, scientists, and dozens of\r\nother people were reporting UFO's, and in greater detail than in\r\nreports of the past. Radars, which were being built for air defense,\r\nbegan to pick up some very unusual targets, thus lending technical\r\ncorroboration to the unsubstantiated claims of human observers.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the continuing accumulation of more impressive UFO\r\nreports, official interest stirred. Early in 1951 verbal orders came\r\ndown from Major General Charles P. Cabell, then Director of\r\nIntelligence for Headquarters, U.S. Air Force, to make a study\r\nreviewing the UFO situation for Air Force Headquarters.\r\n\r\nI had been back in the Air Force about six months when this\r\nhappened. During the second world war I had been a B-29 bombardier\r\nand radar operator. I went to India, China, and later to the Pacific,\r\nwith the original B-29 wing. I flew two DCF's, and some Air Medals'\r\nworth of missions, got out of the Air Force after the war, and went\r\nback to college. To keep my reserve status while I was in school, I\r\nflew as a navigator in an Air Force Reserve Troop Carrier Wing.\r\n\r\nNot long after I received my degree in aeronautical engineering, the\r\nKorean War started, and I went back on active duty. I was assigned to\r\nthe Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force\r\nBase, in Dayton, Ohio. ATIC is responsible for keeping track of all\r\nforeign aircraft and guided missiles. ATIC also had the UFO project.\r\n\r\nI had just finished organizing a new intelligence group when General\r\nCabell's order to review past UFO reports came down. Lieutenant\r\nColonel Rosengarten, who received the order at ATIC, called me in and\r\nwanted to know if I'd take the job of making the review. I accepted.\r\n\r\nWhen the review was finished, I went to the Pentagon and presented\r\nmy findings to Major General Samford, who had replaced General Cabell\r\nas Director of Intelligence.\r\n\r\nATIC soon got the word to set up a completely new project for the\r\ninvestigation and analysis of UFO reports. Since I had made the\r\nreview of past UFO reports I was the expert, and I got the new job.\r\nIt was given the code name Project Blue Book, and I was in charge of\r\nit until late in 1953. During this time members of my staff and I\r\ntraveled close to half a million miles. We investigated dozens of UFO\r\nreports, and read and analyzed several thousand more. These included\r\nevery report ever received by the Air Force.\r\n\r\nFor the size of the task involved Project Blue Book was always\r\nunderstaffed, even though I did have ten people on my regular staff\r\nplus many paid consultants representing every field of science. All\r\nof us on Project Blue Book had Top Secret security clearances so that\r\nsecurity was no block in our investigations. Behind this organization\r\nwas a reporting network made up of every Air Force base intelligence\r\nofficer and every Air Force radar station in the world, and the Air\r\nDefense Command's Ground Observer Corps. This reporting net sent\r\nProject Blue Book reports on every conceivable type of UFO, by every\r\nconceivable type of person.\r\n\r\nWhat did these people actually see when they reported that they had\r\nobserved a UFO? Putting aside truly unidentifiable flying objects for\r\nthe present, this question has several answers.\r\n\r\nIn many instances it has been positively proved that people have\r\nreported balloons, airplanes, stars, and many other common objects as\r\nUFO's. The people who make such reports don't recognize these common\r\nobjects because something in their surroundings temporarily assumes\r\nan unfamiliar appearance.\r\n\r\nUnusual lighting conditions are a common cause of such illusions. A\r\nballoon will glow like a \"ball of fire\" just at sunset. Or an\r\nairplane that is not visible to the naked eye suddenly starts to\r\nreflect the sun's rays and appears to be a \"silver ball.\" Pilots in F-\r\n94 jet interceptors chase Venus in the daytime and fight with\r\nballoons at night, and people in Los Angeles see weird lights.\r\n\r\nOn October 8, 1954, many Los Angeles newspapers and newscasters\r\ncarried an item about a group of flying saucers, bright lights,\r\nflying in a V formation. The lights had been seen from many locations\r\nover Southern California. Pilots saw them while bringing their\r\nairplanes into Los Angeles International Airport, Air Force pilots\r\nflying out of Long Beach saw them, two CBS reporters in Hollywood\r\ngave an eyewitness account, and countless people called police and\r\ncivil defense officials. All of them excitedly reported lights they\r\ncould not identify. The next day the Air Force identified the UFO's;\r\nthey were Air Force airplanes, KC-97 aerial tankers, refueling B-47\r\njet bombers in flight. The reason for the weird effect that startled\r\nso many Southern Californians was that when the refueling is taking\r\nplace a floodlight on the bottom of the tanker airplane lights up the\r\nbomber that is being refueled. The airplanes were flying high, and\r\nslowly, so no sound was heard; only the bright floodlights could be\r\nseen. Since most people, even other pilots, have never seen a night\r\naerial refueling operation and could not identify the odd lights they\r\nsaw, the lights became UFO's.\r\n\r\nIn other instances common everyday objects look like UFO's because\r\nof some odd quirk in the human mind. A star or planet that has been\r\nin the sky every day of the observer's life suddenly \"takes off at\r\nhigh speed on a highly erratic flight path.\" Or a vapor trail from a\r\nhigh-flying jet--seen a hundred times before by the observer--becomes\r\na flying saucer.\r\n\r\nSome psychologists explain such aberrations as being akin to the\r\ncrowd behavior mechanism at work in the \"bobby-sox craze.\" Teen-agers\r\ndon't know why they squeal and swoon when their current fetish sways\r\nand croons. Yet everybody else is squealing, so they squeal too.\r\nMaybe that great comedian, Jimmy Durante, has the answer: \"Everybody\r\nwants to get into the act.\" I am convinced that a certain percentage\r\nof UFO reports come from people who see flying saucers because others\r\nreport seeing them.\r\n\r\nBut this \"will to see\" may have deeper roots, almost religious\r\nimplications, for some people. Consciously or unconsciously, they\r\nwant UFO's to be real and to come from outer space. These\r\nindividuals, frightened perhaps by threats of atomic destruction, or\r\nlesser fears--who knows what--act as if nothing that men can do can\r\nsave the earth. Instead, they seek salvation from outer space, on the\r\nforlorn premise that flying saucer men, by their very existence, are\r\nwiser and more advanced than we. Such people may reason that a race\r\nof men capable of interplanetary travel have lived well into, or\r\nthrough, an atomic age. They have survived and they can tell us their\r\nsecret of survival. Maybe the threat of an atomic war unified their\r\nplanet and allowed them to divert their war effort to one of social\r\nand technical advancement. To such people a searchlight on a cloud or\r\na bright star is an interplanetary spaceship.\r\n\r\nIf all the UFO reports that the Air Force has received in the past\r\neight years could be put in this \"psychological quirk\" category,\r\nProject Blue Book would never have been organized. It is another\r\nclass of reports that causes the Air Force to remain interested in\r\nUFO's. This class of reports are called \"Unknowns.\"\r\n\r\nIn determining the identity of a UFO, the project based its method\r\nof operation on a well-known psychological premise. This premise is\r\nthat to get a reaction from one of the senses there must be a\r\nstimulus. If you think you see a UFO you must have seen something.\r\nPure hallucinations are extremely rare.\r\n\r\nFor anything flying in the air the stimulus could be anything that\r\nis normally seen in the air. Balloons, airplanes, and astronomical\r\nbodies are the commoner stimuli. Birds and insects are common also,\r\nbut usually are seen at such close range that they are nearly always\r\nrecognized. Infrequently observed things, such as sundogs, mirages,\r\nhuge fireballs, and a host of other unusual flying objects, are also\r\nknown stimuli.\r\n\r\nOn Project Blue Book our problem was to identify these stimuli. We\r\nhad methods for checking the location, at any time, of every balloon\r\nlaunched anywhere in the United States. To a certain degree the same\r\nwas true for airplanes. The UFO observer's estimate of where the\r\nobject was located in the sky helped us to identify astronomical\r\nbodies. Huge files of UFO characteristics, along with up-to-the-\r\nminute weather data, and advice from specialists, permitted us to\r\nidentify such things as sun-dogs, paper caught in updrafts, huge\r\nmeteors, etc.\r\n\r\nThis determination of the stimuli that triggered UFO sightings,\r\nwhile not an insurmountable task, was a long, tedious process. The\r\nidentification of known objects was routine, and caused no\r\nexcitement. The excitement and serious interest occurred when we\r\nreceived UFO reports in which the observer was reliable and the\r\nstimuli could not be identified. These were the reports that\r\nchallenged the project and caused me to spend hours briefing top U.S.\r\nofficials. These were the reports that we called \"Unknowns.\"\r\n\r\nOf the several thousand UFO reports that the Air Force has received\r\nsince 1947, some 15 to 20 per cent fall into this category called\r\nunknown. This means that the observer was not affected by any\r\ndeterminable psychological quirks and that after exhaustive\r\ninvestigation the object that was reported could not be identified.\r\nTo be classed as an unknown, a UFO report also had to be \"good,\"\r\nmeaning that it had to come from a competent observer and had to\r\ncontain a reasonable amount of data.\r\n\r\nReports are often seen in the newspapers that say: \"Mrs. Henry\r\nJones, of 5464 South Elm, said that 10:00A.M. she was shaking her\r\ndust mop out of the bedroom window when she saw a flying saucer\"; or\r\n\"Henry Armstrong was driving between Grundy Center and Rienbeck last\r\nnight when he saw a light. Henry thinks it was a flying saucer.\" This\r\nis not a good UFO report.\r\n\r\nThis type of UFO report, if it was received by Project Blue Book,\r\nwas stamped \"Insufficient Data for Evaluation\" and dropped into the\r\ndead file, where it became a mere statistic.\r\n\r\nNext to the \"Insufficient Data\" file was a file marked \"C.P.\" This\r\nmeant crackpot. Into this file went all reports from people who had\r\ntalked with flying saucer crews, who had inspected flying saucers\r\nthat had landed in the United States, who had ridden in flying\r\nsaucers, or who were members of flying saucer crews. By Project Blue\r\nBook standards, these were not \"good\" UFO reports either.\r\n\r\nBut here is a \"good\" UFO report with an \"unknown\" conclusion:\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 1952, two Air Force colonels, flying a B-25, took off\r\nfrom Hamilton Air Force Base, near San Francisco, for Colorado\r\nSprings, Colorado. The day was clear, not a cloud in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe colonels had crossed the Sierra Nevada between Sacramento and\r\nReno and were flying east at 11,000 feet on \"Green 3,\" the aerial\r\nhighway to Salt Lake City. At 3:40P.M. they were over the Carson Sink\r\narea of Nevada, when one of the colonels noticed three objects ahead\r\nof them and a little to their right. The objects looked like three F-\r\n86's flying a tight V formation. If they were F-86's they should have\r\nbeen lower, according to civil air regulations, but on a clear day\r\nsome pilots don't watch their altitude too closely.\r\n\r\nIn a matter of seconds the three aircraft were close enough to the B-\r\n25 to be clearly seen. They were not F-86's. They were three bright\r\nsilver, delta wing craft with no tails and no pilot's canopies. The\r\nonly thing that broke the sharply defined, clean upper surface of the\r\ntriangular wing was a definite ridge that ran from the nose to the\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nIn another second the three deltas made a slight left bank and shot\r\nby the B-25 at terrific speed. The colonels estimated that the speed\r\nwas at least three times that of an F-86. They got a good look at the\r\nthree deltas as the unusual craft passed within 400 to 800 yards of\r\nthe B-25.\r\n\r\nWhen they landed at Colorado Springs, the two colonels called the\r\nintelligence people at Air Defense Command Headquarters to make a UFO\r\nreport. The suggestion was offered that they might have seen three F-\r\n86's. The colonels promptly replied that if the objects had been F-\r\n86's they would have easily been recognized as such. The colonels\r\nknew what F-86's looked like.\r\n\r\nAir Defense Command relayed the report to Project Blue Book. An\r\ninvestigation was started at once.\r\n\r\nFlight Service, which clears all military aircraft flights, was\r\ncontacted and asked about the location of aircraft near the Carson\r\nSink area at 3:40P.M. They had no record of the presence of aircraft\r\nin that area.\r\n\r\nSince the colonels had mentioned delta wing aircraft, and both the\r\nAir Force and the Navy had a few of this type, we double-checked. The\r\nNavy's deltas were all on the east coast, at least all of the silver\r\nones were. A few deltas painted the traditional navy blue were on the\r\nwest coast, but not near Carson Sink. The Air Force's one delta was\r\ntemporarily grounded.\r\n\r\nSince balloons once in a while can appear to have an odd shape, all\r\nballoon flights were checked for both standard weather balloons and\r\nthe big 100-foot-diameter research balloons. Nothing was found.\r\n\r\nA quick check on the two colonels revealed that both of them were\r\ncommand pilots and that each had several thousand hours of flying\r\ntime. They were stationed at the Pentagon. Their highly classified\r\nassignments were such that they would be in a position to recognize\r\n_anything_ that the United States knows to be flying anywhere in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBoth men had friends who had \"seen flying saucers\" at some time, but\r\nboth had openly voiced their skepticism. Now, from what the colonels\r\nsaid when they were interviewed after landing at Colorado Springs,\r\nthey had changed their opinions.\r\n\r\nNobody knows what the two colonels saw over Carson Sink. However, it\r\nis always possible to speculate. Maybe they just thought they were\r\nclose enough to the three objects to see them plainly. The objects\r\nmight have been three F-86's: maybe Flight Service lost the records.\r\nIt could be that the three F-86's had taken off to fly in the local\r\narea of their base but had decided to do some illegal sight-seeing.\r\nFlight Service would have no record of a flight like this. Maybe both\r\nof the colonels had hallucinations.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain mathematical probability that any one of the\r\nabove speculative answers is correct--correct for this one case. If\r\nyou try this type of speculation on hundreds of sightings with\r\n\"unknown\" answers, the probability that the speculative answers are\r\ncorrect rapidly approaches zero.\r\n\r\nMaybe the colonels actually did see what they thought they did, a\r\ntype of craft completely foreign to them.\r\n\r\nAnother good UFO report provides an incident in which there is\r\nhardly room for any speculation of this type. The conclusion is more\r\nsimply, \"Unknown,\" period.\r\n\r\nOn January 20, 1952, at seven-twenty in the evening, two master\r\nsergeants, both intelligence specialists, were walking down a street\r\non the Fairchild Air Force Base, close to Spokane, Washington.\r\n\r\nSuddenly both men noticed a large, bluish-white, spherical-shaped\r\nobject approaching from the east. They stopped and watched the object\r\ncarefully, because several of these UFO's had been reported by pilots\r\nfrom the air base over the past few months. The sergeants had written\r\nup the reports on these earlier sightings.\r\n\r\nThe object was traveling at a moderately fast speed on a horizontal\r\npath. As it passed to the north of their position and disappeared in\r\nthe west, the sergeants noted that it had a long blue tail. At no\r\ntime did they hear any sound. They noted certain landmarks that the\r\nobject had crossed and estimated the time taken in passing these\r\nlandmarks. The next day they went out and measured the angles between\r\nthese landmarks in order to include them in their report.\r\n\r\nWhen we got the report at ATIC, our first reaction was that the\r\nmaster sergeants had seen a large meteor. From the evidence I had\r\nwritten off, as meteors, all previous similar UFO reports from this\r\nair base.\r\n\r\nThe sergeants' report, however, contained one bit of information\r\nthat completely changed the previous picture. At the time of the\r\nsighting there had been a solid 6,000-foot-thick overcast at 4,700\r\nfeet. And meteors don't go that low.\r\n\r\nA few quick calculations gave a rather fantastic answer. If the\r\nobject was just at the base of the clouds it would have been 10,000\r\nfeet from the two observers and traveling 1,400 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nBut regardless of the speed, the story was still fantastic. The\r\nobject was no jet airplane because there was no sound. It was not a\r\nsearchlight because there were none on the air base. It was not an\r\nautomobile spotlight because a spotlight will not produce the type of\r\nlight the sergeants described. As a double check, however, both men\r\nwere questioned on this point. They stated firmly that they had seen\r\nhundreds of searchlights and spotlights playing on clouds, and that\r\nthis was not what they saw.\r\n\r\nBeyond these limited possibilities the sergeants' UFO discourages\r\nfruitful speculation. The object remains unidentified.\r\n\r\nThe UFO reports made by the two colonels and the two master\r\nsergeants are typical of hundreds of other good UFO reports which\r\ncarry the verdict, \"Conclusion unknown.\"\r\n\r\nSome of these UFO reports have been publicized, but many have not.\r\nVery little information pertaining to UFO's was withheld from the\r\npress--if the press knew of the occurrence of specific sightings. Our\r\npolicy on releasing information was to answer only direct questions\r\nfrom the press. If the press didn't know about a given UFO incident,\r\nthey naturally couldn't ask questions about it. Consequently such\r\nstories were never released. In other instances, when the particulars\r\nof a UFO sighting were released, they were only the bare facts about\r\nwhat was reported. Any additional information that might have been\r\ndeveloped during later investigations and analyses was not released.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of interest in UFO's and the interest shows no\r\nsigns of diminishing. Since the first flying saucer skipped across\r\nthe sky in the summer of 1947, thousands of words on this subject\r\nhave appeared in every newspaper and most magazines in the United\r\nStates. During a six-month period in 1952 alone 148 of the nation's\r\nleading newspapers carried a total of over 16,000 items about flying\r\nsaucers.\r\n\r\nDuring July 1952 reports of flying saucers sighted over Washington,\r\nD.C., cheated the Democratic National Convention out of precious\r\nheadline space.\r\n\r\nThe subject of flying saucers, which has generated more unscientific\r\nbehavior than any other topic of modern times, has been debated at\r\nthe meetings of professional scientific societies, causing scientific\r\ntempers to flare where unemotional objectivity is supposed to reign\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nYet these thousands of written words and millions of spoken words--\r\nall attesting to the general interest--have generated more heat than\r\nlight. Out of this avalanche of print and talk, the full, factual,\r\ntrue story of UFO's has emerged only on rare occasions. The general\r\npublic, for its interest in UFO's, has been paid off in misinformation.\r\n\r\nMany civilian groups must have sensed this, for while I was chief of\r\nProject Blue Book I had dozens of requests to speak on the subject of\r\nUFO's. These civilian requests had to be turned down because of\r\nsecurity regulations.\r\n\r\nI did give many official briefings, however, behind closed doors, to\r\ncertain groups associated with the government--all of them upon\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nThe subject of UFO's was added to a regular series of intelligence\r\nbriefings given to students at the Air Force's Command and Staff\r\nSchool, and to classes at the Air Force's Intelligence School.\r\n\r\nI gave briefings to the technical staff at the Atomic Energy\r\nCommission's Los Alamos laboratory, where the first atomic bomb was\r\nbuilt. The theater where this briefing took place wouldn't hold all\r\nof the people who tried to get in, so the briefing was recorded and\r\nreplayed many times. The same thing happened at AEC's Sandia Base,\r\nnear Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nMany groups in the Pentagon and the Office of Naval Research\r\nrequested UFO briefings. Civilian groups, made up of some of the\r\nnation's top scientists and industrialists, and formed to study\r\nspecial military problems, worked in a UFO briefing. Top Air Force\r\ncommanders were given periodic briefings.\r\n\r\nEvery briefing I gave was followed by a discussion that lasted\r\nanywhere from one to four hours.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, Project Blue Book published a classified\r\nmonthly report on UFO activity. Requests to be put on distribution\r\nfor this report were so numerous that the distribution had to be\r\nrestricted to major Air Force Command Headquarters.\r\n\r\nThis interest was not caused by any revolutionary information that\r\nwas revealed in the briefings or reports. It stemmed only from a\r\ndesire to get the facts about an interesting subject.\r\n\r\nMany aspects of the UFO problem were covered in these official\r\nbriefings. I would give details of many of the better reports we\r\nreceived, our conclusions about them, and how those conclusions were\r\nreached. If we had identified a UFO, the audience was told how the\r\nidentification was made. If we concluded that the answer to a UFO\r\nsighting was \"Unknown,\" the audience learned why we were convinced it\r\nwas unknown.\r\n\r\nAmong the better sightings that were described fully to interested\r\ngovernment groups were: the complete story of the Lubbock Lights,\r\nincluding the possible sighting of the same V-shaped light formations\r\nat other locations on the same night; the story of a group of\r\nscientists who detected mysterious nuclear radiation when UFO's were\r\nsighted; and all of the facts behind such famous cases as the Mantell\r\nIncident, the Florida scoutmaster who was burned by a \"flying\r\nsaucer,\" and headline-capturing sightings at Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nI showed them what few photographs we had, the majority of which\r\neveryone has seen, since they have been widely published in magazines\r\nand newspapers. Our collection of photographs was always a\r\ndisappointment as far as positive proof was concerned because, in a\r\nsense, if you've seen one you've seen them all. We had no clear\r\npictures of a saucer, just an assortment of blurs, blotches, and\r\nstreaks of light.\r\n\r\nThe briefings included a description of how Project Blue Book\r\noperated and a survey of the results of the many studies that were\r\nmade of the mass of UFO data we had collected. Also covered were our\r\ninterviews with a dozen North American astronomers, the story of the\r\nunexplained green fireballs of New Mexico, and an account of how a\r\ncommittee of six distinguished United States scientists spent many\r\nhours attempting to answer the question, \"Are the UFO's from outer\r\nspace?\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the general public was never able to hear these\r\nbriefings. For a long time, contrary to present thinking in military\r\ncircles, I have believed that the public also is entitled to know the\r\ndetails of what was covered in these briefings (less, of course, the\r\nfew items pertaining to radar that were classified \"Secret,\" and the\r\nnames of certain people). But withholding these will not alter the\r\nfacts in any way.\r\n\r\nA lot has already been written on the subject of UFO's, but none of\r\nit presents the true, complete story. Previous forays into the UFO\r\nfield have been based on inadequate information and have been warped\r\nto fit the personal biases of the individual writers. Well meaning\r\nthough these authors may be, the degree to which their books have\r\nmisinformed the public is incalculable.\r\n\r\nIt is high time that we let the people know.\r\n\r\nThe following chapters present the true and complete UFO story,\r\nbased on what I learned about UFO's while I was chief of Project Blue\r\nBook, the Air Force's project for the investigation and analysis of\r\nUFO reports. Here is the same information that I gave to Secretary of\r\nthe Air Force, Thomas K. Finletter, to the Air Force commanders, to\r\nscientists and industrialists. This is what the Air Force knows about\r\nunidentified flying objects.\r\n\r\nYou may not agree with some of the official ideas or conclusions--\r\nneither did a lot of people I briefed--but this is the story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nThe Era of Confusion Begins\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1947, the chief of the Air Technical Intelligence\r\nCenter, one of the Air Force's most highly specialized intelligence\r\nunits, sent a letter to the Commanding General of the then Army Air\r\nForces.\r\n\r\nThe letter was in answer to the Commanding General's verbal request\r\nto make a preliminary study of the reports of unidentified flying\r\nobjects. The letter said that after a preliminary study of UFO\r\nreports, ATIC concluded that, to quote from the letter, \"the reported\r\nphenomena were real.\" The letter strongly urged that a permanent\r\nproject be established at ATIC to investigate and analyze future UFO\r\nreports. It requested a priority for the project, a registered code\r\nname, and an over-all security classification. ATICs request was\r\ngranted and Project Sign, the forerunner of Project Grudge and\r\nProject Blue Book, was launched. It was given a 2A priority, 1A being\r\nthe highest priority an Air Force project could have. With this the\r\nAir Force dipped into the most prolonged and widespread controversy\r\nit has ever, or may ever, encounter. The Air Force grabbed the\r\nproverbial bear by the tail and to this day it hasn't been able to\r\nlet loose.\r\n\r\nThe letter to the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces from the\r\nchief of ATIC had used the word \"phenomena.\" History has shown that\r\nthis was not a too well-chosen word. But on September 23, 1947, when\r\nthe letter was written, ATICs intelligence specialists were confident\r\nthat within a few months or a year they would have the answer to the\r\nquestion, \"What are UFO's?\" The question, \"Do UFO's exist?\" was never\r\nmentioned. The only problem that confronted the people at ATIC was,\r\n\"Were the UFO's of Russian or interplanetary origin?\" Either case\r\ncalled for a serious, secrecy-shrouded project. Only top people at\r\nATIC were assigned to Project Sign.\r\n\r\nAlthough a formal project for UFO investigation wasn't set up until\r\nSeptember 1947, the Air Force had been vitally interested in UFO\r\nreports ever since June 24, 1947, the day Kenneth Arnold made the\r\noriginal UFO report.\r\n\r\nAs Arnold's story of what he saw that day has been handed down by\r\nthe bards of saucerism, the true facts have been warped, twisted, and\r\nchanged. Even some points in Arnold's own account of his sighting as\r\npublished in his book, _The_ _Coming_ _of_ _the_ _Saucers_, do not\r\njibe with what the official files say he told the Air Force in 1947.\r\nSince this incident was the original UFO sighting, I used to get many\r\ninquiries about it from the press and at briefings. To get the true\r\nand accurate story of what did happen to Kenneth Arnold on June 24,\r\n1947, I had to go back through old newspaper files, official reports,\r\nand talk to people who had worked on Project Sign. By cross-checking\r\nthese data and talking to people who had heard Arnold tell about his\r\nUFO sighting soon after it happened, I finally came up with what I\r\nbelieve is the accurate story.\r\n\r\nArnold had taken off from Chehalis, Washington, intending to fly to\r\nYakima, Washington. About 3:00P.M. he arrived in the vicinity of\r\nMount Rainier. There was a Marine Corps C-46 transport plane lost in\r\nthe Mount Rainier area, so Arnold decided to fly around awhile and\r\nlook for it. He was looking down at the ground when suddenly he\r\nnoticed a series of bright flashes off to his left. He looked for the\r\nsource of the flashes and saw a string of nine very bright disk-\r\nshaped objects, which he estimated to be 45 to 50 feet in length.\r\nThey were traveling from north to south across the nose of his\r\nairplane. They were flying in a reversed echelon (i.e., lead object\r\nhigh with the rest stepped down), and as they flew along they weaved\r\nin and out between the mountain peaks, once passing behind one of the\r\npeaks. Each individual object had a skipping motion described by\r\nArnold as a \"saucer skipping across water.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the objects were in sight, Arnold had clocked\r\ntheir speed. He had marked his position and their position on the map\r\nand again noted the time. When he landed he sketched in the flight\r\npath that the objects had flown and computed their speed, almost\r\n1,700 miles per hour. He estimated that they had been 20 to 25 miles\r\naway and had traveled 47 miles in 102 seconds.\r\n\r\nI found that there was a lot of speculation on this report. Two\r\nfactions at ATIC had joined up behind two lines of reasoning. One\r\nside said that Arnold had seen plain, everyday jet airplanes flying\r\nin formation. This side's argument was based on the physical\r\nlimitations of the human eye, visual acuity, the eye's ability to see\r\na small, distant object. Tests, they showed, had proved that a person\r\nwith normal vision can't \"see\" an object that subtends an angle of\r\nless than 0.2 second of arc. For example, a basketball can't be seen\r\nat a distance of several miles but if you move the basketball closer\r\nand closer, at some point you will be able to see it. At this point\r\nthe angle between the top and bottom of the ball and your eye will be\r\nabout 0.2 of a second of arc. This was applied to Arnold's sighting.\r\nThe \"Arnold-saw-airplanes\" faction maintained that since Arnold said\r\nthat the objects were 45 to 50 feet long they would have had to be\r\nmuch closer than he had estimated or he couldn't even have seen them\r\nat all. Since they were much closer than he estimated, Arnold's timed\r\nspeed was all wrong and instead of going 1,700 miles per hour the\r\nobjects were traveling at a speed closer to 400 miles per hour, the\r\nspeed of a jet. There was no reason to believe they weren't jets. The\r\njets appeared to have a skipping motion because Arnold had looked at\r\nthem through layers of warm and cold air, like heat waves coming from\r\na hot pavement that cause an object to shimmer.\r\n\r\nThe other side didn't buy this idea at all. They based their\r\nargument on the fact that Arnold knew where the objects were when he\r\ntimed them.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he was an old mountain pilot and was as familiar with the\r\narea around the Cascade Mountains as he was with his own living room.\r\nTo cinch this point the fact that the objects had passed _behind_ a\r\nmountain peak was brought up. This positively established the\r\ndistance the objects were from Arnold and confirmed his calculated\r\n1,700-miles-per-hour speed. Besides, no airplane can weave in and out\r\nbetween mountain peaks in the short time that Arnold was watching\r\nthem. The visual acuity factor only strengthened the \"Arnold-saw-a-\r\nflying-saucer\" faction's theory that what he'd seen was a spaceship.\r\nIf he could see the objects 20 to 25 miles away, they must have been\r\nabout 210 feet long instead of the poorly estimated 45 to 50 feet.\r\n\r\nIn 1947 this was a fantastic story, but now it is just another UFO\r\nreport marked \"Unknown.\" It is typical in that if the facts are\r\naccurate, if Arnold actually did see the UFO's go _behind_ a mountain\r\npeak, and if he knew his exact position at the time, the UFO problem\r\ncannot be lightly sloughed off; but there are always \"ifs\" in UFO\r\nreports. This is the type of report that led Major General John A.\r\nSamford, Director of Intelligence for Headquarters, Air Force, to\r\nmake the following comment during a press conference in July 1952:\r\n\"However, there have remained a percentage of this total [of all UFO\r\nreports received by the Air Force], about 20 per cent of the reports,\r\nthat have come from credible observers of relatively incredible\r\nthings. We keep on being concerned about them.\"\r\n\r\nIn warping, twisting, and changing the Arnold incident, the writers\r\nof saucer lore haven't been content to confine themselves to the\r\nincident itself; they have dragged in the crashed Marine Corps' C-46.\r\nThey intimate that the same flying saucers that Arnold saw shot down\r\nthe C-46, grabbed up the bodies of the passengers and crew, and now\r\nhave them pickled at the University of Venus Medical School. As proof\r\nthey apply the same illogical reasoning that they apply to most\r\neverything. The military never released photos of the bodies of the\r\ndead men, therefore there were no bodies. There were photographs and\r\nthere were bodies. In consideration of the families of air crewmen\r\nand passengers, photos of air crashes showing dead bodies are never\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nArnold himself seems to be the reason for a lot of the excitement\r\nthat heralded flying saucers. Stories of odd incidents that occur in\r\nthis world are continually being reported by newspapers, but never on\r\nthe scale of the first UFO report. Occasional stories of the\r\n\"Himalayan snowmen,\" or the \"Malayan monsters,\" rate only a few\r\ninches or a column on the back pages of newspapers. Arnold's story,\r\nif it didn't make the headlines, at least made the front page. I had\r\nthe reason for this explained to me one day when I was investigating\r\na series of UFO reports in California in the spring of 1952.\r\n\r\nI was making my headquarters at an air base where a fighter-bomber\r\nwing was stationed. Through a mutual friend I met one of the fighter-\r\nbomber pilots who had known Arnold. In civilian life the pilot was a\r\nnewspaper reporter and had worked on the original Arnold story. He\r\ntold me that when the story first broke all the newspaper editors in\r\nthe area were thoroughly convinced that the incident was a hoax, and\r\nthat they intended to write the story as such. The more they dug into\r\nthe facts, however, and into Arnold's reputation, the more it\r\nappeared that he was telling the truth. Besides having an\r\nunquestionable character, he was an excellent mountain pilot, and\r\nmountain pilots are a breed of men who know every nook and cranny of\r\nthe mountains in their area. The most fantastic part of Arnold's\r\nstory had been the 1,700-miles-per-hour speed computed from Arnold's\r\ntiming the objects between two landmarks. \"When Arnold told us how he\r\ncomputed the speed,\" my chance acquaintance told me, \"we all put a\r\nlot of faith in his story.\" He went on to say that when the editors\r\nfound out that they were wrong about the hoax, they did a complete\r\nabout-face, and were very much impressed by the story. This\r\nenthusiasm spread, and since the Air Force so quickly denied\r\nownership of the objects, all of the facts built up into a story so\r\nunique that papers all over the world gave it front-page space.\r\n\r\nThere was an old theory that maybe Arnold had seen wind whipping\r\nsnow along the mountain ridges, so I asked about this. I got a flat\r\n\"Impossible.\" My expert on the early Arnold era said, \"I've lived in\r\nthe Pacific Northwest many years and have flown in the area for\r\nhundreds of hours. It's impossible to get powder snow low in the\r\nmountains in June. Personally, I believe Arnold saw some kind of\r\naircraft and they weren't from this earth.\" He went on to tell me\r\nabout two other very similar sightings that had happened the day\r\nafter Arnold saw the nine disks. He knew the people who made these\r\nsightings and said that they weren't the kind to go off \"half\r\ncocked.\" He offered to get a T-6 and fly me up to Boise to talk to\r\nthem since they had never made a report to the military, but I had to\r\nreturn to Dayton so I declined.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days of Arnold's sighting, others began to come in. On\r\nJune 28 an Air Force pilot in an F-51 was flying near Lake Mead,\r\nNevada, when he saw a formation of five or six circular objects off\r\nhis right wing. This was about three-fifteen in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThat night at nine-twenty, four Air Force officers, two pilots, and\r\ntwo intelligence officers from Maxwell AFB in Montgomery, Alabama,\r\nsaw a bright light traveling across the sky. It was first seen just\r\nabove the horizon, and as it traveled toward the observers it\r\n\"zigzagged,\" with bursts of high speed. When it was directly overhead\r\nit made a sharp 90-degree turn and was lost from view as it traveled\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nOther reports came in. In Milwaukee a lady saw ten go over her house\r\n\"like blue blazes,\" heading south. A school bus driver in Clarion,\r\nIowa, saw an object streak across the sky. In a few seconds twelve\r\nmore followed the first one. White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico\r\nchalked up the first of the many sightings that this location would\r\nproduce when several people riding in an automobile saw a pulsating\r\nlight travel from horizon to horizon in thirty seconds. A Chicago\r\nhousewife saw one \"with legs.\"\r\n\r\nThe week of July 4, 1947, set a record for reports that was not\r\nbroken until 1952. The center of activity was the Portland, Oregon,\r\narea. At 11:00A.M. a carload of people driving near Redmond saw four\r\ndisk-shaped objects streaking past Mount Jefferson. At 1:05P.M. a\r\npoliceman was in the parking lot behind the Portland City Police\r\nHeadquarters when he noticed some pigeons suddenly began to flutter\r\naround as if they were scared. He looked up and saw five large disk-\r\nshaped objects, two going south and three going east. They were\r\ntraveling at a high rate of speed and seemed to be oscillating about\r\ntheir lateral axis. Minutes later two other policemen, both ex-\r\npilots, reported three of the same things flying in trail. Before\r\nlong the harbor patrol called into headquarters. A crew of four\r\npatrolmen had seen three to six of the disks, \"shaped like chrome hub\r\ncaps,\" traveling very fast. They also oscillated as they flew. Then\r\nthe citizens of Portland began to see them. A man saw one going east\r\nand two going north. At four-thirty a woman called in and had just\r\nseen one that looked like \"a new dime flipping around.\" Another man\r\nreported two, one going southeast, one northeast. From Milwaukie,\r\nOregon, three were reported going northwest. In Vancouver,\r\nWashington, sheriff's deputies saw twenty to thirty.\r\n\r\nThe first photo was taken on July 4 in Seattle. After much publicity\r\nit turned out to be a weather balloon.\r\n\r\nThat night a United Airlines crew flying near Emmett, Idaho, saw\r\nfive. The pilot's report read:\r\n\r\nFive \"somethings,\" which were thin and smooth on the bottom and\r\nrough-appearing on top, were seen silhouetted against the sunset\r\nshortly after the plane took off from Boise at 8:04P.M. We saw them\r\nclearly. We followed them in a northeasterly direction for about 45\r\nmiles. They finally disappeared. We were unable to tell whether they\r\noutsped us or disintegrated. We can't say whether they were\r\n\"smearlike,\" oval, or anything else but whatever they were they were\r\nnot aircraft, clouds or smoke.\r\n\r\nCivilians did not have a corner on the market. On July 6 a staff\r\nsergeant in Birmingham, Alabama, saw several \"dim, glowing lights\"\r\nspeeding across the sky and photographed one of them. Also on the\r\nsixth the crew of an Air Force B-25 saw a bright, disk-shaped object\r\n\"low at nine o'clock.\" This is one of the few reports of an object\r\nlower than the aircraft. At Fairfield-Suisun AFB in California a\r\npilot saw something travel three quarters of the way across the sky\r\nin a few seconds. It, too, was oscillating on its lateral axis.\r\n\r\nAccording to the old hands at ATIC, the first sighting that really\r\nmade the Air Force take a deep interest in UFO's occurred on July 8\r\nat Muroc Air Base (now Edwards AFB), the supersecret Air Force test\r\ncenter in the Mojave Desert of California. At 10:10A.M. a test pilot\r\nwas running up the engine of the then new XP-84 in preparation for a\r\ntest flight. He happened to look up and to the north he saw what\r\nfirst appeared to be a weather balloon traveling in a westerly\r\ndirection. After watching it a few seconds, he changed his mind. He\r\nhad been briefed on the high-altitude winds, and the object he saw\r\nwas going against the wind. Had it been the size of a normal\r\naircraft, the test pilot estimated that it would have been at 10,000\r\nto 12,000 feet and traveling 200 to 225 miles per hour. He described\r\nthe object as being spherically shaped and yellowish white in color.\r\n\r\nTen minutes before this several other officers and airmen had seen\r\nthree objects. They were similar except they had more of a silver\r\ncolor. They were also heading in a westerly direction.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later a crew of technicians on Rogers Dry Lake, adjacent\r\nto Muroc Air Base, observed another UFO. Their report went as follows:\r\n\r\nOn the 8 July 1947 at 11:50 we were sitting in an observation truck\r\nlocated in Area #3, Rogers Dry Lake. We were gazing upward toward a\r\nformation of two P-82's and an A-26 aircraft flying at 20,000 feet.\r\nThey were preparing to carry out a seat-ejection experiment. We\r\nobserved a round object, white aluminum color, which at first\r\nresembled a parachute canopy. Our first impression was that a\r\npremature ejection of the seat and dummy had occurred but this was\r\nnot the case. The object was lower than 20,000 feet, and was falling\r\nat three times the rate observed for the test parachute, which\r\nejected thirty seconds after we first saw the object. As the object\r\nfell it drifted slightly north of due west against the prevailing\r\nwind. The speed, horizontal motion, could not be determined, but it\r\nappeared to be slower than the maximum velocity F-80 aircraft.\r\n\r\nAs this object descended through a low enough level to permit\r\nobservation of its lateral silhouette, it presented a distinct oval-\r\nshaped outline, with two projections on the upper surface which might\r\nhave been thick fins or nobs. These crossed each other at intervals,\r\nsuggesting either rotation or oscillation of slow type.\r\n\r\nNo smoke, flames, propeller arcs, engine noise, or other plausible\r\nor visible means of propulsion were noted. The color was silver,\r\nresembling an aluminum-painted fabric, and did not appear as dense as\r\na parachute canopy.\r\n\r\nWhen the object dropped to a level such that it came into line of\r\nvision of the mountain tops, it was lost to the vision of the\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the object was in sight about 90 seconds. Of\r\nthe five people sitting in the observation truck, four observed this\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe following is our opinion about this object:\r\n\r\nIt was man-made, as evidenced by the outline and functional\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nSeeing this was not a hallucination or other fancies of sense.\r\n\r\nExactly four hours later the pilot of an F-51 was flying at 20,000\r\nfeet about 40 miles south of Muroc Air Base when he sighted a \"flat\r\nobject of a light-reflecting nature.\" He reported that it had no\r\nvertical fin or wings. When he first saw it, the object was above him\r\nand he tried to climb up to it, but his F-51 would not climb high\r\nenough. All air bases in the area were contacted but they had no\r\naircraft in the area.\r\n\r\nBy the end of July 1947 the UFO security lid was down tight. The few\r\nmembers of the press who did inquire about what the Air Force was\r\ndoing got the same treatment that you would get today if you inquired\r\nabout the number of thermonuclear weapons stock-piled in the U.S.'s\r\natomic arsenal. No one, outside of a few high-ranking officers in the\r\nPentagon, knew what the people in the barbed-wire enclosed Quonset\r\nhuts that housed the Air Technical Intelligence Center were thinking\r\nor doing.\r\n\r\nThe memos and correspondence that Project Blue Book inherited from\r\nthe old UFO projects told the story of the early flying saucer era.\r\nThese memos and pieces of correspondence showed that the UFO\r\nsituation was considered to be serious; in fact, very serious. The\r\npaper work of that period also indicated the confusion that\r\nsurrounded the investigation; confusion almost to the point of panic.\r\nThe brass wanted an answer, quickly, and people were taking off in\r\nall directions. Everyone's theory was as good as the next and each\r\nperson with any weight at ATIC was plugging and investigating his own\r\ntheory. The ideas as to the origin of the UFO's fell into two main\r\ncategories, earthly and non-earthly. In the earthly category the\r\nRussians led, with the U.S. Navy and their XF-5-U-1, the \"Flying\r\nFlapjack,\" pulling a not too close second. The desire to cover all\r\nleads was graphically pointed up to be a personal handwritten note I\r\nfound in a file. It was from ATIC's chief to a civilian intelligence\r\nspecialist. It said, \"Are you positive that the Navy junked the XF-5-\r\nU-1 project?\" The non-earthly category ran the gamut of theories,\r\nwith space animals trailing interplanetary craft about the same\r\ndistance the Navy was behind the Russians.\r\n\r\nThis confused speculating lasted only a few weeks. Then the\r\ninvestigation narrowed down to the Soviets and took off on a much\r\nmore methodical course of action.\r\n\r\nWhen World War II ended, the Germans had several radical types of\r\naircraft and guided missiles under development. The majority of these\r\nprojects were in the most preliminary stages but they were the only\r\nknown craft that could even approach the performance of the objects\r\nreported by UFO observers. Like the Allies, after World War II the\r\nSoviets had obtained complete sets of data on the latest German\r\ndevelopments. This, coupled with rumors that the Soviets were\r\nfrantically developing the German ideas, caused no small degree of\r\nalarm. As more UFO's were observed near the Air Force's Muroc Test\r\nCenter, the Army's White Sands Proving Ground, and atomic bomb\r\nplants, ATIC's efforts became more concentrated.\r\n\r\nWires were sent to intelligence agents in Germany requesting that\r\nthey find out exactly how much progress had been made on the various\r\nGerman projects.\r\n\r\nThe last possibility, of course, was that the Soviets had discovered\r\nsome completely new aerodynamic concept that would give saucer\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nWhile ATIC technical analysts were scouring the United States for\r\ndata on the German projects and the intelligence agents in Germany\r\nwere seeking out the data they had been asked for, UFO reports\r\ncontinued to flood the country. The Pacific Northwest still led with\r\nthe most sightings, but every state in the Union was reporting a few\r\nflying saucers.\r\n\r\nAt first there was no co-ordinated effort to collect data on the UFO\r\nreports. Leads would come from radio reports or newspaper items.\r\nMilitary intelligence agencies outside of ATIC were hesitant to\r\ninvestigate on their own initiative because, as is so typical of the\r\nmilitary, they lacked specific orders. When no orders were\r\nforthcoming, they took this to mean that the military had no interest\r\nin the UFO's. But before long this placid attitude changed, and\r\nchanged drastically. Classified orders came down to investigate _all_\r\nUFO sightings. Get every detail and send it direct to ATIC at Wright\r\nField. The order carried no explanation as to why the information was\r\nwanted. This lack of an explanation and the fact that the information\r\nwas to be sent directly to a high-powered intelligence group within\r\nAir Force Headquarters stirred the imagination of every potential\r\ncloak-and-dagger man in the military intelligence system.\r\nIntelligence people in the field who had previously been free with\r\nopinions now clammed up tight.\r\n\r\nThe era of confusion was progressing.\r\n\r\nEarly statements to the press, which shaped the opinion of the\r\npublic, didn't reduce the confusion factor. While ATIC was grimly\r\nexpending maximum effort in a serious study, \"certain high-placed\r\nofficials\" were officially chuckling at the mention of UFO's.\r\n\r\nIn July 1947 an International News Service wire story quoted the\r\npublic relations officer at Wright Field as saying, \"So far we\r\nhaven't found anything to confirm that saucers exist. We don't think\r\nthey are guided missiles.\" He went on to say, \"As things are now,\r\nthey appear to be either a phenomenon or a figment of somebody's\r\nimagination.\"\r\n\r\nA few weeks later a lieutenant colonel who was Assistant to the\r\nChief of Staff of the Fourth Air Force was widely quoted as saying,\r\n\"There is no basis for belief in flying saucers in the Tacoma area\r\n[referring to a UFO sighting in the area of Tacoma, Washington], or\r\nany other area.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"experts,\" in their stories of saucer lore, have said that these\r\nbrush-offs of the UFO sightings were intentional smoke screens to\r\ncover the facts by adding confusion. This is not true; it was merely\r\na lack of coordination. But had the Air Force tried to throw up a\r\nscreen of confusion, they couldn't have done a better job.\r\n\r\nWhen the lieutenant colonel from the Fourth Air Force made his\r\nwidely publicized denunciation of saucer believers he specifically\r\nmentioned a UFO report from the Tacoma, Washington, area.\r\n\r\nThe report of the investigation of this incident, the Maury Island\r\nMystery, was one of the most detailed reports of the early UFO era.\r\nThe report that we had in our files had been pieced together by Air\r\nForce Intelligence and other agencies because the two intelligence\r\nofficers who started the investigation couldn't finish it. They were\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nFor the Air Force the story started on July 31, 1947, when\r\nLieutenant Frank Brown, an intelligence agent at Hamilton AFB,\r\nCalifornia, received a long-distance phone call. The caller was a man\r\nwhom 111 call Simpson, who had met Brown when Brown investigated an\r\nearlier UFO sighting, and he had a hot lead on another UFO incident.\r\nHe had just talked to two Tacoma Harbor patrolmen. One of them had\r\nseen six UFO's hover over his patrol boat and spew out chunks of odd\r\nmetal. Simpson had some of the pieces of the metal.\r\n\r\nThe story sounded good to Lieutenant Brown, so he reported it to his\r\nchief. His chief OK'd a trip and within an hour Lieutenant Brown and\r\nCaptain Davidson were flying to Tacoma in an Air Force B-25. When\r\nthey arrived they met Simpson and an airline pilot friend of his in\r\nSimpson's hotel room. After the usual round of introductions Simpson\r\ntold Brown and Davidson that he had received a letter from a Chicago\r\npublisher asking him, Simpson, to investigate this case. The\r\npublisher had paid him $200 and wanted an exclusive on the story, but\r\nthings were getting too hot, Simpson wanted the military to take over.\r\n\r\nSimpson went on to say that he had heard about the experience off\r\nMaury Island but that he wanted Brown and Davidson to hear it\r\nfirsthand. He had called the two harbor patrolmen and they were on\r\ntheir way to the hotel. They arrived and they told their story.\r\n\r\nI'll call these two men Jackson and Richards although these aren't\r\ntheir real names. In June 1947, Jackson said, his crew, his son, and\r\nthe son's dog were on his patrol boat patrolling near Maury Island,\r\nan island in Puget Sound, about 3 miles from Tacoma. It was a gray\r\nday, with a solid cloud deck down at about 2,500 feet. Suddenly\r\neveryone on the boat noticed six \"doughnut-shaped\" objects, just\r\nunder the clouds, headed toward the boat. They came closer and\r\ncloser, and when they were about 500 feet over the boat they stopped.\r\nOne of the doughnut-shaped objects seemed to be in trouble as the\r\nother five were hovering around it. They were close, and everybody\r\ngot a good look. The UFO's were about 100 feet in diameter, with the\r\n\"hole in the doughnut\" being about 25 feet in diameter. They were a\r\nsilver color and made absolutely no noise. Each object had large\r\nportholes around the edge.\r\n\r\nAs the five UFO's circled the sixth, Jackson recalled, one of them\r\ncame in and appeared to make contact with the disabled craft. The two\r\nobjects maintained contact for a few minutes, then began to separate.\r\nWhile this was going on, Jackson was taking photos. Just as they\r\nbegan to separate, there was a dull \"thud\" and the next second the\r\nUFO began to spew out sheets of very light metal from the hole in the\r\ncenter. As these were fluttering to the water, the UFO began to throw\r\nout a harder, rocklike material. Some of it landed on the beach of\r\nMaury Island. Jackson took his crew and headed toward the beach of\r\nMaury Island, but not before the boat was damaged, his son's arm had\r\nbeen injured, and the dog killed. As they reached the island they\r\nlooked up and saw that the UFO's were leaving the area at high speed.\r\nThe harbor patrolman went on to tell how he scooped up several chunks\r\nof the metal from the beach and boarded the patrol boat. He tried to\r\nuse his radio to summon aid, but for some unusual reason the\r\ninterference was so bad he couldn't even call the three miles to his\r\nheadquarters in Tacoma. When they docked at Tacoma, Jackson got first\r\naid for his son and then reported to his superior officer, Richards,\r\nwho, Jackson added to his story, didn't believe the tale. He didn't\r\nbelieve it until he went out to the island himself and saw the metal.\r\n\r\nJackson's trouble wasn't over. The next morning a mysterious visitor\r\ntold Jackson to forget what he'd seen.\r\n\r\nLater that same day the photos were developed. They showed the six\r\nobjects, but the film was badly spotted and fogged, as if the film\r\nhad been exposed to some kind of radiation.\r\n\r\nThen Simpson told about his brush with mysterious callers. He said\r\nthat Jackson was not alone as far as mysterious callers were\r\nconcerned, the Tacoma newspapers had been getting calls from an\r\nanonymous tipster telling exactly what was going on in Simpson's\r\nhotel room. This was a very curious situation because no one except\r\nSimpson, the airline pilot, and the two harbor patrolmen knew what\r\nwas taking place. The room had even been thoroughly searched for\r\nhidden microphones.\r\n\r\nThat is the way the story stood a few hours after Lieutenant Brown\r\nand Captain Davidson arrived in Tacoma.\r\n\r\nAfter asking Jackson and Richards a few questions, the two\r\nintelligence agents left, reluctant even to take any of the\r\nfragments. As some writers who have since written about this incident\r\nhave said, Brown and Davidson seemed to be anxious to leave and\r\nafraid to touch the fragments of the UFO, as if they knew something\r\nmore about them. The two officers went to McChord AFB, near Tacoma,\r\nwhere their B-25 was parked, held a conference with the intelligence\r\nofficer at McChord, and took off for their home base, Hamilton. When\r\nthey left McChord they had a good idea as to the identity of the\r\nUFO's. Fortunately they told the McChord intelligence officer what\r\nthey had determined from their interview.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours the two officers were dead. The B-25 crashed near\r\nKelso, Washington. The crew chief and a passenger had parachuted to\r\nsafety. The newspapers hinted that the airplane was sabotaged and\r\nthat it was carrying highly classified material. Authorities at\r\nMcChord AFB confirmed this latter point, the airplane was carrying\r\nclassified material.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the newspaper publicity on the crash died down, and\r\nthe Maury Island Mystery was never publicly solved.\r\n\r\nLater reports say that the two harbor patrolmen mysteriously\r\ndisappeared soon after the fatal crash.\r\n\r\nThey should have disappeared, into Puget Sound. The whole Maury\r\nIsland Mystery was a hoax. The first, possibly the second-best, and\r\nthe dirtiest hoax in the UFO history. One passage in the detailed\r\nofficial report of the Maury Island Mystery says:\r\n\r\nBoth ------ (the two harbor patrolmen) admitted that the rock\r\nfragments had nothing to do with flying saucers. The whole thing was\r\na hoax. They had sent in the rock fragments [to a magazine publisher]\r\nas a joke. ------ One of the patrolmen wrote to ------ [the\r\npublisher] stating that the rock could have been part of a flying\r\nsaucer. He had said the rock came from a flying saucer because that's\r\nwhat ------ [the publisher] wanted him to say.\r\n\r\nThe publisher, mentioned above, who, one of the two hoaxers said,\r\nwanted him to say that the rock fragments had come from a flying\r\nsaucer, is the same one who paid the man I called Simpson $200 to\r\ninvestigate the case.\r\n\r\nThe report goes on to explain more details of the incident. Neither\r\none of the two men could ever produce the photos. They \"misplaced\"\r\nthem, they said. One of them, I forget which, was the mysterious\r\ninformer who called the newspapers to report the conversations that\r\nwere going on in the hotel room. Jackson's mysterious visitor didn't\r\nexist. Neither of the men was a harbor patrolman, they merely owned a\r\ncouple of beat-up old boats that they used to salvage floating lumber\r\nfrom Puget Sound. The airplane crash was one of those unfortunate\r\nthings. An engine caught on fire, burned off, and just before the two\r\npilots could get out, the wing and tail tore off, making it\r\nimpossible for them to escape. The two dead officers from Hamilton\r\nAFB smelled a hoax, accounting for their short interview and\r\nhesitancy in bothering to take the \"fragments.\" They confirmed their\r\nconvictions when they talked to the intelligence officer at McChord.\r\nIt had already been established, through an informer, that the\r\nfragments were what Brown and Davidson thought, slag. The classified\r\nmaterial on the B-25 was a file of reports the two officers offered\r\nto take back to Hamilton and had nothing to do with the Maury Island\r\nMystery, or better, the Maury Island Hoax.\r\n\r\nSimpson and his airline pilot friend weren't told about the hoax for\r\none reason. As soon as it was discovered that they had been \"taken,\"\r\nthoroughly, and were not a party to the hoax, no one wanted to\r\nembarrass them.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the writers of saucer lore have played this sighting\r\nto the hilt, pointing out as their main premise the fact that the\r\nstory must be true because the government never openly exposed or\r\nprosecuted either of the two hoaxers. This is a logical premise, but\r\na false one. The reason for the thorough investigation of the Maury\r\nIsland Hoax was that the government had thought seriously of\r\nprosecuting the men. At the last minute it was decided, after talking\r\nto the two men, that the hoax was a harmless joke that had\r\nmushroomed, and that the loss of two lives and a B-25 could not be\r\ndirectly blamed on the two men. The story wasn't even printed because\r\nat the time of the incident, even though in this case the press knew\r\nabout it, the facts were classed as evidence. By the time the facts\r\nwere released they were yesterday's news. And nothing is deader than\r\nyesterday's news.\r\n\r\nAs 1947 drew to a close, the Air Force's Project Sign had outgrown\r\nits initial panic and had settled down to a routine operation. Every\r\nintelligence report dealing with the Germans' World War II\r\naeronautical research had been studied to find out if the Russians\r\ncould have developed any of the late German designs into flying\r\nsaucers. Aerodynamicists at ATIC and at Wright Field's Aircraft\r\nLaboratory computed the maximum performance that could be expected\r\nfrom the German designs. The designers of the aircraft themselves\r\nwere contacted. \"Could the Russians develop a flying saucer from\r\ntheir designs?\" The answer was, \"No, there was no conceivable way any\r\naircraft could perform that would match the reported maneuvers of the\r\nUFO's.\" The Air Force's Aeromedical Laboratory concurred. If the\r\naircraft could be built, the human body couldn't stand the violent\r\nmaneuvers that were reported. The aircraft-structures people seconded\r\nthis, no material known could stand the loads of the reported\r\nmaneuvers and heat of the high speeds.\r\n\r\nStill convinced that the UFO's were real objects, the people at ATIC\r\nbegan to change their thinking. Those who were convinced that the\r\nUFO's were of Soviet origin now began to eye outer space, not because\r\nthere was any evidence that the UFO's did come from outer space but\r\nbecause they were convinced that UFO's existed and only some unknown\r\nrace with a highly developed state of technology could build such\r\nvehicles. As far as the effect on the human body was concerned, why\r\ncouldn't these people, whoever they might be, stand these horrible\r\nmaneuver forces? Why judge them by earthly standards? I found a memo\r\nto this effect was in the old Project Sign files.\r\n\r\nProject Sign ended 1947 with a new problem. How do you collect\r\ninterplanetary intelligence? During World War II the organization\r\nthat was ATIC's forerunner, the Air Materiel Command's secret \"T-2,\"\r\nhad developed highly effective means of wringing out every possible\r\nbit of information about the technical aspects of enemy aircraft.\r\nATIC knew these methods, but how could this be applied to spaceships?\r\nThe problem was tackled with organized confusion.\r\n\r\nIf the confusion in the minds of Air Force people was organized the\r\nconfusion in the minds of the public was not. Publicized statements\r\nregarding the UFO were conflicting.\r\n\r\nA widely printed newspaper release, quoting an unnamed Air Force\r\nofficial in the Pentagon, said:\r\n\r\nThe \"flying saucers\" are one of three things:\r\n\r\nSolar reflections on low-hanging clouds.\r\n\r\nSmall meteors that break up, their crystals catching the rays of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nIcing conditions could have formed large hailstones and they might\r\nhave    flattened out and glided.\r\n\r\nA follow-up, which quoted several scientists, said in essence that\r\nthe unnamed Air Force official was crazy. Nobody even heard of\r\ncrystallized meteors, or huge, flat hailstones, and the solar-\r\nreflection theory was absurd.\r\n\r\n_Life_, _Time_, _Newsweek_, and many other news magazines carried\r\narticles about the UFO's. Some were written with tongue in cheek,\r\nothers were not. All the articles mentioned the Air Force's mass-\r\nhysterical induced hallucinations. But a Veterans' Administration\r\npsychiatrist publicly pooh-poohed this. \"Too many people are seeing\r\nthings,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was widely suggested that all the UFO's were meteors. Two Chicago\r\nastronomers queered this. Dr. Gerard Kuiper, director of the\r\nUniversity of Chicago observatory, was quoted as flatly saying the\r\nUFO's couldn't be meteors. \"They are probably man-made,\" he told the\r\nAssociated Press. Dr. Oliver Lee, director of Northwestern\r\nUniversity's observatory, agreed with Dr. Kuiper and he threw in an\r\nadditional confusion factor that had been in the back of many\r\npeople's minds. Maybe they were our own aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe government had been denying that UFO's belonged to the U.S. from\r\nthe first, but Dr. Vannevar Bush, the world-famous scientist, and Dr.\r\nMerle Tuve, inventor of the proximity fuse, added their weight.\r\n\"Impossible,\" they said.\r\n\r\nAll of this time unnamed Air Force officials were disclaiming\r\nserious interest in the UFO subject. Yet every time a newspaper\r\nreporter went out to interview a person who had seen a UFO,\r\nintelligence agents had already been flown in, gotten the detailed\r\nstory complete with sketches of the UFO, and sped back to their base\r\nto send the report to Project Sign. Many people had supposedly been\r\n\"warned\" not to talk too much. The Air Force was mighty interested in\r\nhallucinations.\r\n\r\nThus 1947 ended with various-sized question marks in the mind of the\r\npublic. If you followed flying saucers closely the question mark was\r\nbig, if you just noted the UFO story titles in the papers it was\r\nsmaller, but it was there and it was growing. Probably none of the\r\npeople, military or civilian, who had made the public statements were\r\nat all qualified to do so but they had done it, their comments had\r\nbeen printed, and their comments had been read. Their comments formed\r\nthe question mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nThe Classics\r\n\r\n1948 was only one hour and twenty-five minutes old when a gentleman\r\nfrom Abilene, Texas, made the first UFO report of the year. What he\r\nsaw, \"a fan-shaped glow\" in the sky, was insignificant as far as UFO\r\nreports go, but it ushered in a year that was to bring feverish\r\nactivity to Project Sign.\r\n\r\nWith the Soviets practically eliminated as a UFO source, the idea of\r\ninterplanetary spaceships was becoming more popular. During 1948 the\r\npeople in ATIC were openly discussing the possibility of\r\ninterplanetary visitors without others tapping their heads and\r\nlooking smug. During 1948 the novelty of UFO's had worn off for the\r\npress and every John and Jane Doe who saw one didn't make the front\r\npages as in 1947. Editors were becoming hardened, only a few of the\r\nbest reports got any space. Only \"The Classics\" rated headlines. \"The\r\nClassics\" were three historic reports that were the highlights of\r\n1948. They are called \"The Classics,\" a name given them by the\r\nProject Blue Book staff, because: (1) they are classic examples of\r\nhow the true facts of a UFO report can be twisted and warped by some\r\nwriters to prove their point, (2) they are the most highly publicized\r\nreports of this early era of the UFO's, and (3) they \"proved\" to\r\nATIC's intelligence specialists that UFO's were real.\r\n\r\nThe apparent lack of interest in UFO reports by the press was not a\r\ntrue indication of the situation. I later found out, from talking to\r\nwriters, that all during 1948 the interest in UFO's was running high.\r\nThe Air Force Press Desk in the Pentagon was continually being asked\r\nwhat progress was being made in the UFO investigation. The answer\r\nwas, \"Give us time. This job can't be done in a week.\" The press\r\nrespected this and was giving them time. But every writer worth his\r\nsalt has contacts, those \"usually reliable sources\" you read about,\r\nand these contacts were talking. All during 1948 contacts in the\r\nPentagon were telling how UFO reports were rolling in at the rate of\r\nseveral per day and how ATIC UFO investigation teams were flying out\r\nof Dayton to investigate them. They were telling how another Air\r\nForce investigative organization had been called in to lighten ATIC's\r\nload and allow ATIC to concentrate on the analysis of the reports.\r\nThe writers knew this was true because they had crossed paths with\r\nthese men whom they had mistakenly identified as FBI agents. The FBI\r\nwas never officially interested in UFO sightings. The writers'\r\ncontacts in the airline industry told about the UFO talk from V.P.'s\r\ndown to the ramp boys. Dozens of good, solid, reliable, experienced\r\nairline pilots were seeing UFO's. All of this led to one conclusion:\r\nwhatever the Air Force had to say, when it was ready to talk, would\r\nbe newsworthy. But the Air Force wasn't ready to talk.\r\n\r\nProject Sign personnel were just getting settled down to work after\r\nthe New Year's holiday when the \"ghost rockets\" came back to the\r\nScandinavian countries of Europe. Air attaches in Sweden, Denmark,\r\nand Norway fired wires to ATIC telling about the reports. Wires went\r\nback asking for more information.\r\n\r\nThe \"ghost rockets,\" so tagged by the newspapers, had first been\r\nseen in the summer of 1946, a year before the first UFO sighting in\r\nthe U.S. There were many different descriptions for the reported\r\nobjects. They were usually seen in the hours of darkness and almost\r\nalways traveling at extremely high speeds. They were shaped like a\r\nball or projectile, were a bright green, white, red, or yellow and\r\nsometimes made sounds. Like their American cousins, they were always\r\nso far away that no details could be seen. For no good reason, other\r\nthan speculation and circulation, the newspapers had soon begun to\r\nrefer authoritatively to these \"ghost rockets\" as guided missiles,\r\nand implied that they were from Russia. Peenemunde, the great German\r\nmissile development center and birthplace of the V-l and V-2 guided\r\nmissiles, came in for its share of suspicion since it was held by the\r\nRussians. By the end of the summer of 1946 the reports were\r\nwidespread, coming from Denmark, Norway, Spain, Greece, French\r\nMorocco, Portugal, and Turkey. In 1947, after no definite conclusions\r\nas to identity of the \"rockets\" had been established, the reports\r\ndied out. Now in early January 1948 they broke out again. But Project\r\nSign personnel were too busy to worry about European UFO reports,\r\nthey were busy at home. A National Guard pilot had just been killed\r\nchasing a UFO.\r\n\r\nOn January 7 all of the late papers in the U.S. carried headlines\r\nsimilar to those in the Louisville _Courier_: \"F-51 and Capt. Mantell\r\nDestroyed Chasing Flying Saucer.\" This was Volume I of \"The\r\nClassics,\" the Mantell Incident.\r\n\r\nAt one-fifteen on that afternoon the control tower operators at\r\nGodman AFB, outside Louisville, Kentucky, received a telephone call\r\nfrom the Kentucky State Highway Patrol. The patrol wanted to know if\r\nGodman Tower knew anything about any unusual aircraft in the\r\nvicinity. Several people from Maysville, Kentucky, a small town 80\r\nmiles east of Louisville, had reported seeing a strange aircraft.\r\nGodman knew that they had nothing in the vicinity so they called\r\nFlight Service at Wright-Patterson AFB. In a few minutes Flight\r\nService called back. Their air Traffic control board showed no\r\nflights in the area. About twenty minutes later the state police\r\ncalled again. This time people from the towns of Owensboro and\r\nIrvington, Kentucky, west of Louisville, were reporting a strange\r\ncraft. The report from these two towns was a little more complete.\r\nThe townspeople had described the object to the state police as being\r\n\"circular, about 250 to 300 feet in diameter,\" and moving westward at\r\na \"pretty good clip.\" Godman Tower checked Flight Service again.\r\nNothing. All this time the tower operators had been looking for the\r\nreported object. They theorized that since the UFO had had to pass\r\nnorth of Godman to get from Maysville to Owensboro it might come back.\r\n\r\nAt one forty-five they saw it, or something like it. Later, in his\r\nofficial report, the assistant tower operator said that he had seen\r\nthe object for several minutes before he called his chiefs attention\r\nto it. He said that he had been reluctant to \"make a flying saucer\r\nreport.\" As soon as the two men in the tower had assured themselves\r\nthat the UFO they saw was not an airplane or a weather balloon, they\r\ncalled Flight Operations. They wanted the operations officer to see\r\nthe UFO. Before long word of the sighting had gotten around to key\r\npersonnel on the base, and several officers, besides the base\r\noperations officer and the base intelligence officer, were in the\r\ntower. All of them looked at the UFO through the tower's 6 x 50\r\nbinoculars and decided they couldn't identify it. About this time\r\nColonel Hix, the base commander, arrived. He looked and he was\r\nbaffled. At two-thirty, they reported, they were discussing what\r\nshould be done when four F-51's came into view, approaching the base\r\nfrom the south.\r\n\r\nThe tower called the flight leader, Captain Mantell, and asked him\r\nto take a look at the object and try to identify it. One F-51 in the\r\nflight was running low on fuel, so he asked permission to go on to\r\nhis base. Mantell took his two remaining wing men, made a turn, and\r\nstarted after the UFO. The people in Godman Tower were directing him\r\nas none of the pilots could see the object at this time. They gave\r\nMantell an initial heading toward the south and the flight was last\r\nseen heading in the general direction of the UFO.\r\n\r\nBy the time the F-51's had climbed to 10,000 feet, the two wing men\r\nlater reported, Mantell had pulled out ahead of them and they could\r\njust barely see him. At two forty-five Mantell called the tower and\r\nsaid, \"I see something above and ahead of me and I'm still climbing.\"\r\nAll the people in the tower heard Mantell say this and they heard one\r\nof the wing men call back and ask, \"What the hell are we looking\r\nfor?\" The tower immediately called Mantell and asked him for a\r\ndescription of what he saw. Odd as it may seem, no one can remember\r\nexactly what he answered. Saucer historians have credited him with\r\nsaying, \"I've sighted the thing. It looks metallic and it's\r\ntremendous in size. . . . Now it's starting to climb.\" Then in a few\r\nseconds he is supposed to have called and said, \"It's above me and\r\nI'm gaining on it. I'm going to 20,000 feet.\" Everyone in the tower\r\nagreed on this one last bit of the transmission, \"I'm going to 20,000\r\nfeet,\" but didn't agree on the first part, about the UFO's being\r\nmetallic and tremendous.\r\n\r\nThe two wing men were now at 15,000 feet and trying frantically to\r\ncall Mantell. He had climbed far above them by this time and was out\r\nof sight. Since none of them had any oxygen they were worried about\r\nMantell. Their calls were not answered. Mantell never talked to\r\nanyone again. The two wing men leveled off at 15,000 feet, made\r\nanother fruitless effort to call Mantell, and started to come back\r\ndown. As they passed Godman Tower on their way to their base, one of\r\nthem said something to the effect that all he had seen was a\r\nreflection on his canopy.\r\n\r\nWhen they landed at their base, Standiford Field, just north of\r\nGodman, one pilot had his F-51 refueled and serviced with oxygen, and\r\ntook off to search the area again. He didn't see anything.\r\n\r\nAt three-fifty the tower lost sight of the UFO. A few minutes later\r\nthey got word that Mantell had crashed and was dead.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours later, at 7:20P.M., airfield towers all over the\r\nMidwest sent in frantic reports of another UFO. In all about a dozen\r\nairfield towers reported the UFO as being low on the southwestern\r\nhorizon and disappearing after about twenty minutes. The writers of\r\nsaucer lore say this UFO was what Mantell was chasing when he died;\r\nthe Air Force says _this_ UFO was Venus.\r\n\r\nThe people on Project Sign worked fast on the Mantell Incident.\r\nContemplating a flood of queries from the press as soon as they heard\r\nabout the crash, they realized that they had to get a quick answer.\r\nVenus had been the target of a chase by an Air Force F-51 several\r\nweeks before and there were similarities between this sighting and\r\nthe Mantell Incident. So almost before the rescue crews had reached\r\nthe crash, the word \"Venus\" went out. This satisfied the editors, and\r\nso it stood for about a year; Mantell had unfortunately been killed\r\ntrying to reach the planet Venus.\r\n\r\nTo the press, the nonchalant, offhand manner with which the sighting\r\nwas written off by the Air Force public relations officer showed\r\ngreat confidence in the conclusion, Venus, but behind the barbed-wire\r\nfence that encircled ATIC the nonchalant attitude didn't exist among\r\nthe intelligence analysts. One man had already left for Louisville\r\nand the rest were doing some tall speculating. The story about the\r\ntower-to-air talk. \"It looks metallic and it's tremendous in size,\"\r\nspread fast. Rumor had it that the tower had carried on a running\r\nconversation with the pilots and that there was more information than\r\nwas so far known. Rumor also had it that this conversation had been\r\nrecorded. Unfortunately neither of these rumors was true.\r\n\r\nOver a period of several weeks the file on the Mantell Incident grew\r\nin size until it was the most thoroughly investigated sighting of\r\nthat time, at least the file was the thickest.\r\n\r\nAbout a year later the Air Force released its official report on the\r\nincident. To use a trite term, it was a masterpiece in the art of\r\n\"weasel wording.\" It said that the UFO might have been Venus or it\r\ncould have been a balloon. Maybe two balloons. It probably was Venus\r\nexcept that this is doubtful because Venus was too dim to be seen in\r\nthe afternoon. This jolted writers who had been following the UFO\r\nstory. Only a few weeks before, _The_ _Saturday_ _Evening_ _Post_ had\r\npublished a two-part story entitled \"What You Can Believe about\r\nFlying Saucers.\" The story had official sanction and had quoted the\r\nVenus theory as a positive solution. To clear up the situation,\r\nseveral writers were allowed to interview a major in the Pentagon,\r\nwho was the Air Force's Pentagon \"expert\" on UFO's. The major was\r\nasked directly about the conclusion of the Mantell Incident, and he\r\nflatly stated that it was Venus. The writers pointed out the official\r\nAir Force analysis. The major's answer was, \"They checked again and\r\nit was Venus.\" He didn't know who \"they\" were, where they had\r\nchecked, or what they had checked, but it was Venus. The writers then\r\nasked, \"If there was a later report they had made why wasn't it used\r\nas a conclusion?\" \"Was it available?\" The answer to the last question\r\nwas \"No,\" and the lid snapped back down. This interview gave the\r\ndefinite impression that the Air Force was unsuccessfully trying to\r\ncover up some very important information, using Venus as a front.\r\nNothing excites a newspaper or magazine writer more than to think he\r\nhas stumbled onto a big story and that someone is trying to cover it\r\nup. Many writers thought this after the interview with the major, and\r\nmany still think it. You can't really blame them, either.\r\n\r\nIn early 1952 I got a telephone call on ATIC's direct line to the\r\nPentagon. It was a colonel in the Director of Intelligence's office.\r\nThe Office of Public Information had been getting a number of queries\r\nabout all of the confusion over the Mantell Incident. What was the\r\nanswer?\r\n\r\nI dug out the file. In 1949 all of the original material on the\r\nincident had been microfilmed, but something had been spilled on the\r\nfilm. Many sections were so badly faded they were illegible. As I had\r\nto do with many of the older sightings that were now history, I\r\ncollected what I could from the file, filling in the blanks by\r\ntalking to people who had been at ATIC during the early UFO era. Many\r\nof these people were still around, \"Red\" Honnacker, George Towles, Al\r\nDeyarmond, Nick Post, and many others. Most of them were civilians,\r\nthe military had been transferred out by this time.\r\n\r\nSome of the press clippings in the file mentioned the Pentagon major\r\nand his concrete proof of Venus. I couldn't find this concrete proof\r\nin the file so I asked around about the major. The major, I found,\r\nwas an officer in the Pentagon who had at one time written a short\r\nintelligence summary about UFO's. He had never been stationed at\r\nATIC, nor was he especially well versed on the UFO problem. When the\r\nword of the press conference regarding the Mantell Incident came\r\ndown, a UFO expert was needed. The major, because of his short\r\nintelligence summary on UFO's, became the \"expert.\" He had evidently\r\nconjured up \"they\" and \"their later report\" to support his Venus\r\nanswer because the writers at the press conference had him in a\r\ncorner. I looked farther.\r\n\r\nFortunately the man who had done the most extensive work on the\r\nincident, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, head of the Ohio State University\r\nAstronomy Department, could be contacted. I called Dr. Hynek and\r\narranged to meet him the next day.\r\n\r\nDr. Hynek was one of the most impressive scientists I met while\r\nworking on the UFO project, and I met a good many. He didn't do two\r\nthings that some of them did: give you the answer before he knew the\r\nquestion; or immediately begin to expound on his accomplishments in\r\nthe field of science. I arrived at Ohio State just before lunch, and\r\nDr. Hynek invited me to eat with him at the faculty club. He wanted\r\nto refer to some notes he had on the Mantell Incident and they were\r\nin his office, so we discussed UFO's in general during lunch.\r\n\r\nBack in his office he started to review the Mantell Incident. He had\r\nbeen responsible for the weasel-worded report that the Air Force\r\nreleased in late 1949, and he apologized for it. Had he known that it\r\nwas going to cause so much confusion, he said, he would have been\r\nmore specific. He thought the incident was a dead issue. The reason\r\nthat Venus had been such a strong suspect was that it was in almost\r\nthe same spot in the sky as the UFO. Dr. Hynek referred to his notes\r\nand told me that at 3:00P.M., Venus had been south southwest of\r\nGodman and 33 degrees above the southern horizon. At 3:00P.M. the\r\npeople in the tower estimated the UFO to be southwest of Godman and\r\nat an elevation of about 45 degrees. Allowing for human error in\r\nestimating directions and angles, this was close. I agreed. There was\r\none big flaw in the theory, however. Venus wasn't bright enough to be\r\nseen. He had computed the brilliance of the planet, and on the day in\r\nquestion it was only six times as bright as the surrounding sky. Then\r\nhe explained what this meant. Six times may sound like a lot, but it\r\nisn't. When you start looking for a pinpoint of light only six times\r\nas bright as the surrounding sky, it's almost impossible to find it,\r\neven on a clear day.\r\n\r\nDr. Hynek said that he didn't think that the UFO was Venus.\r\n\r\nI later found out that although it was a relatively clear day there\r\nwas considerable haze.\r\n\r\nI asked him about some of the other possibilities. He repeated the\r\nballoon, canopy-reflection, and sundog theories but he refused to\r\ncomment on them since, as he said, he was an astrophysicist and would\r\ncare to comment only on the astrophysical aspects of the sightings.\r\n\r\nI drove back to Dayton convinced that the UFO wasn't Venus. Dr.\r\nHynek had said Venus would have been a pinpoint of light. The people\r\nin the tower had been positive of their descriptions, their\r\nstatements brought that out. They couldn't agree on a description,\r\nthey called the UFO \"a parachute,\" \"an ice cream cone tipped with\r\nred,\" \"round and white,\" \"huge and silver or metallic,\" \"a small\r\nwhite object,\" \"one fourth the size of the full moon,\" but all the\r\ndescriptions plainly indicated a large object. None of the\r\ndescriptions could even vaguely be called a pinpoint of light.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of a definite shape seemed to eliminate the sundog\r\ntheory too. Sundogs, or parhelia, as they are technically known, are\r\ncaused by ice particles reflecting a diffused light. This would not\r\ngive a sharp outline. I also recalled two instances where Air Force\r\npilots had chased sundogs. In both instances when the aircraft began\r\nto climb, the sundog disappeared. This was because the angle of\r\nreflection changed as the airplane climbed several thousand feet.\r\nThese sundog-caused UFO's also had fuzzy edges.\r\n\r\nI had always heard a lot of wild speculation about the condition of\r\nMantell's crashed F-51, so I wired for a copy of the accident report.\r\nIt arrived several days after my visit with Dr. Hynek. The report\r\nsaid that the F-51 had lost a wing due to excessive speed in a dive\r\nafter Mantell had \"blacked out\" due to the lack of oxygen. Mantell's\r\nbody had not burned, not disintegrated, and was not full of holes;\r\nthe wreck was not radioactive, nor was it magnetized.\r\n\r\nOne very important and pertinent question remained. Why did Mantell,\r\nan experienced pilot, try to go to 20,000 feet when he didn't even\r\nhave an oxygen mask? If he had run out of oxygen, it would have been\r\ndifferent Every pilot and crewman has it pounded into him, \"Do not,\r\nunder any circumstances, go above 15,000 feet without oxygen.\" In\r\nhigh-altitude indoctrination during World War II, I made several\r\ntrips up to 30,000 feet in a pressure chamber. To demonstrate anoxia\r\nwe would leave our oxygen masks off until we became dizzy. A few of\r\nthe more hardy souls could get to 15,000 feet, but nobody ever got\r\nover 17,000. Possibly Mantell thought he could climb up to 20,000 in\r\na hurry and get back down before he got anoxia and blacked out, but\r\nthis would be a foolish chance. This point was covered in the\r\nsighting report. A long-time friend of Mantell's went on record as\r\nsaying that he'd flown with him several years and knew him\r\npersonally. He couldn't conceive of Mantell's even thinking about\r\ndisregarding his lack of oxygen. Mantell was one of the most cautious\r\npilots he knew. \"The only thing I can think,\" he commented, \"was that\r\nhe was after something that he believed to be more important than his\r\nlife or his family.\"\r\n\r\nMy next step was to try to find out what Mantell's wing men had seen\r\nor thought but this was a blind alley. All of this evidence was in\r\nthe ruined portion of the microfilm, even their names were missing.\r\nThe only reference I could find to them was a vague passage\r\nindicating they hadn't seen anything.\r\n\r\nI concentrated on the canopy-reflection theory. It is widely\r\nbelieved that many flying saucers appear to pilots who are actually\r\nchasing a reflection on their canopy. I checked over all the reports\r\nwe had on file. I couldn't find one that had been written off for\r\nthis reason. I dug back into my own flying experience and talked to a\r\ndozen pilots. All of us had momentarily been startled by a reflection\r\non the aircraft's canopy or wing, but in a second or two it had been\r\nobvious that it was a reflection. Mantell chased the object for at\r\nleast fifteen to twenty minutes, and it is inconceivable that he\r\nwouldn't realize in that length of time that he was chasing a\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nAbout the only theory left to check was that the object might have\r\nbeen one of the big, 100-foot-diameter, \"skyhook\" balloons. I\r\nrechecked the descriptions of the UFO made by the people in the\r\ntower. The first man to sight the object called it a parachute;\r\nothers said ice cream cone, round, etc. All of these descriptions fit\r\na balloon. Buried deep in the file were two more references to\r\nballoons that I had previously missed. Not long after the object had\r\ndisappeared from view at Godman AFB, a man from Madisonville,\r\nKentucky, called Flight Service in Dayton. He had seen an object\r\ntraveling southeast. He had looked at it through a telescope and it\r\nwas a balloon. At four forty-five an astronomer living north of\r\nNashville, Tennessee, called in. He had also seen a UFO, looked at it\r\nthrough a telescope, and it was a balloon.\r\n\r\nIn the thousands of words of testimony and evidence taken on the\r\nMantell Incident this was the only reference to balloons. I had\r\npurposely not paid too much attention to this possibility because I\r\nwas sure that it had been thoroughly checked back in 1948. Now I\r\nwasn't sure.\r\n\r\nI talked with one of the people who had been in on the Mantell\r\ninvestigation. The possibility of a balloon's causing the sighting\r\nhad been mentioned but hadn't been followed up for two reasons.\r\nNumber one was that everybody at ATIC was convinced that the object\r\nMantell was after was a spaceship and that this was the only course\r\nthey had pursued. When the sighting grew older and no spaceship proof\r\ncould be found, everybody jumped on the Venus band wagon, as this\r\ntheory had \"already been established.\" It was an easy way out. The\r\nsecond reason was that a quick check had been made on weather\r\nballoons and none were in the area. The big skyhook balloon project\r\nwas highly classified at that time, and since they were all convinced\r\nthat the object was of interplanetary origin (a minority wanted to\r\ngive the Russians credit), they didn't want to bother to buck the red\r\ntape of security to get data on skyhook flights.\r\n\r\nThe group who supervise the contracts for all the skyhook research\r\nflights for the Air Force are located at Wright Field, so I called\r\nthem. They had no records on flights in 1948 but they did think that\r\nthe big balloons were being launched from Clinton County AFB in\r\nsouthern Ohio at that time. They offered to get the records of the\r\nwinds on January 7 and see what flight path a balloon launched in\r\nsouthwestern Ohio would have taken. In a few days they had the data\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the times of the first sightings, from the towns\r\noutside Louisville, were not exact but it was possible to partially\r\nreconstruct the sequence of events. The winds were such that a\r\nskyhook balloon launched from Clinton County AFB could be seen from\r\nthe town east of Godman AFB, the town from which the first UFO was\r\nreported to the Kentucky State Police. It is not unusual to be able\r\nto see a large balloon for 50 to 60 miles. The balloon could have\r\ntraveled west for a while, climbing as it moved with the strong east\r\nwinds that were blowing that day and picking up speed as the winds\r\ngot stronger at altitude. In twenty minutes it could have been in a\r\nposition where it could be seen from Owensboro and Irvington,\r\nKentucky, the two towns west of Godman. The second reports to the\r\nstate police had come from these two towns. Still climbing, the\r\nballoon would have reached a level where a strong wind was blowing in\r\na southerly direction. The jet-stream winds were not being plotted in\r\n1948 but the weather chart shows strong indications of a southerly\r\nbend in the jet stream for this day. Jet stream or not, the balloon\r\nwould have moved rapidly south, still climbing. At a point somewhere\r\nsouth or southwest of Godman it would have climbed through the\r\nsoutherly-moving winds to a calm belt at about 60,000 feet. At this\r\nlevel it would slowly drift south or southeast. A skyhook balloon can\r\nbe seen at 60,000.\r\n\r\nWhen first seen by the people in Godman Tower, the UFO was south of\r\nthe air base. It was relatively close and looked \"like a parachute,\"\r\nwhich a balloon does. During the two hours that it was in sight, the\r\nobservers reported that it seemed to hover, yet each observer\r\nestimated the time he looked at the object through the binoculars and\r\ntimewise the descriptions ran \"huge,\" \"small,\" \"one fourth the size\r\nof a full moon,\" \"one tenth the size of a full moon.\" Whatever the\r\nUFO was, it was slowly moving away. As the balloon continued to drift\r\nin a southerly direction it would have picked up stronger winds, and\r\ncould have easily been seen by the astronomers in Madisonville,\r\nKentucky, and north of Nashville an hour after it disappeared from\r\nview at Godman.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the archives of the Air Force or the Navy there are\r\nrecords that will show whether or not a balloon was launched from\r\nClinton County AFB, Ohio, on January 7, 1948. I never could find\r\nthese records. People who were working with the early skyhook\r\nprojects \"remember\" operating out of Clinton County AFB in 1947 but\r\nrefuse to be pinned down to a January 7 flight. Maybe, they said.\r\n\r\nThe Mantell Incident is the same old UFO jigsaw puzzle. By assuming\r\nthe shape of one piece, a balloon launched from southwestern Ohio,\r\nthe whole picture neatly falls together. It shows a huge balloon that\r\nCaptain Thomas Mantell died trying to reach. He didn't know that he\r\nwas chasing a balloon because he had never heard of a huge, 100-foot-\r\ndiameter skyhook balloon, let alone seen one. Leave out the one piece\r\nof the jigsaw puzzle and the picture is a UFO, \"metallic and\r\ntremendous in size.\"\r\n\r\nIt _could_ have been a balloon. This is the answer I phoned back to\r\nthe Pentagon.\r\n\r\nDuring January and February of 1948 the reports of \"ghost rockets\"\r\ncontinued to come from air attaches in foreign countries near the\r\nBaltic Sea. People in North Jutland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and\r\nGermany reported \"balls of fire traveling slowly across the sky.\" The\r\nreports were very sketchy and incomplete, most of them accounts from\r\nnewspapers. In a few days the UFO's were being seen all over Europe\r\nand South America. Foreign reports hit a peak in the latter part of\r\nFebruary and U.S. newspapers began to pick up the stories.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish Defense Staff supposedly conducted a comprehensive study\r\nof the incidents and concluded that they were all explainable in\r\nterms of astronomical phenomena. Since this was UFO history, I made\r\nseveral attempts to get some detailed and official information on\r\nthis report and the sightings, but I was never successful.\r\n\r\nThe ghost rockets left in March, as mysteriously as they had arrived.\r\n\r\nAll during the spring of 1948 good reports continued to come in.\r\nSome were just run-of-the-mill but a large percentage of them were\r\ngood, coming from people whose reliability couldn't be questioned.\r\nFor example, three scientists reported that for thirty seconds they\r\nhad watched a round object streak across the sky in a highly erratic\r\nflight path near the Army's secret White Sands Proving Ground. And on\r\nMay 28 the crew of an Air Force C-47 had three UFO's barrel in from\r\n\"twelve o'clock high\" to buzz their transport.\r\n\r\nOn July 21 a curious report was received from the Netherlands. The\r\nday before several persons reported seeing a UFO through high broken\r\nclouds over The Hague. The object was rocket-shaped, with two rows of\r\nwindows along the side. It was a poor report, very sketchy and\r\nincomplete, and it probably would have been forgotten except that\r\nfour nights later a similar UFO almost collided with an Eastern\r\nAirlines DC-3. This near collision is Volume II of \"The Classics.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 24, 1948, an Eastern Airlines DC-3 took off\r\nfrom Houston, Texas. It was on a scheduled trip to Atlanta, with\r\nintermediate stops in between. The pilots were Clarence S. Chiles and\r\nJohn B. Whitted. At about 2:45 A.M., when the flight was 20 miles\r\nsouthwest of Montgomery, the captain, Chiles, saw a light dead ahead\r\nand closing fast. His first reaction, he later reported to an ATIC\r\ninvestigation team, was that it was a jet, but in an instant he\r\nrealized that even a jet couldn't close as fast as this light was\r\nclosing. Chiles said he reached over, gave Whitted, the other pilot,\r\na quick tap on the arm, and pointed. The UFO was now almost on top of\r\nthem. Chiles racked the DC-3 into a tight left turn. Just as the UFO\r\nflashed by about 700 feet to the right, the DC-3 hit turbulent air.\r\nWhitted looked back just as the UFO pulled up in a steep climb.\r\n\r\nBoth the pilots had gotten a good look at the UFO and were able to\r\ngive a good description to the Air Force intelligence people. It was\r\na B-29 fuselage. The underside had a \"deep blue glow.\" There were\r\n\"two rows of windows from which bright lights glowed,\" and a \"50-foot\r\ntrail of orange-red flame\" shot out the back.\r\n\r\nOnly one passenger was looking out of the window at the time. The\r\nATIC investigators talked to him. He said he saw a \"strange, eerie\r\nstreak of light, very intense,\" but that was all, no details. He said\r\nthat it all happened before he could adjust his eyes to the darkness.\r\n\r\nMinutes later a crew chief at Robins Air Force Base in Macon,\r\nGeorgia, reported seeing an extremely bright light pass overhead,\r\ntraveling at a high speed. A few days later another report from the\r\nnight of July 24 came in. A pilot, flying near the Virginia-North\r\nCarolina state line, reported that he had seen a \"bright shooting\r\nstar\" in the direction of Montgomery, Alabama, at about the exact\r\ntime the Eastern Airlines DC-3 was \"buzzed.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the old timers at ATIC, this report shook them worse\r\nthan the Mantell Incident. This was the first time two reliable\r\nsources had been really close enough to anything resembling a UFO to\r\nget a good look and live to tell about it. A quick check on a map\r\nshowed that the UFO that nearly collided with the airliner would have\r\npassed almost over Macon, Georgia, after passing the DC-3. It had\r\nbeen turning toward Macon when last seen. The story of the crew chief\r\nat Robins AFB, 200 miles away, seemed to confirm the sighting, not to\r\nmention the report from near the Virginia-North Carolina state line.\r\n\r\nIn intelligence, if you have something to say about some vital\r\nproblem you write a report that is known as an \"Estimate of the\r\nSituation.\" A few days after the DC-3 was buzzed, the people at ATIC\r\ndecided that the time had arrived to make an Estimate of the\r\nSituation. The situation was the UFO's; the estimate was that they\r\nwere interplanetary!\r\n\r\nIt was a rather thick document with a black cover and it was printed\r\non legal-sized paper. Stamped across the front were the words TOP\r\nSECRET.\r\n\r\nIt contained the Air Force's analysis of many of the incidents I\r\nhave told you about plus many similar ones. All of them had come from\r\nscientists, pilots, and other equally credible observers, and each\r\none was an unknown.\r\n\r\nThe document pointed out that the reports hadn't actually started\r\nwith the Arnold Incident. Belated reports from a weather observer in\r\nRichmond, Virginia, who observed a \"silver disk\" through his\r\ntheodolite telescope; an F-47 pilot and three pilots in his formation\r\nwho saw a \"silver flying wing,\" and the English \"ghost airplanes\"\r\nthat had been picked up on radar early in 1947 proved this point.\r\nAlthough reports on them were not received until after the Arnold\r\nsighting, these incidents all had taken place earlier.\r\n\r\nWhen the estimate was completed, typed, and approved, it started up\r\nthrough channels to higher-command echelons. It drew considerable\r\ncomment but no one stopped it on its way up.\r\n\r\nA matter of days after the Estimate of the Situation was signed,\r\nsealed, and sent on its way, the third big sighting of 1948, Volume\r\nIII of \"The Classics,\" took place. The date was October 1, and the\r\nplace was Fargo, North Dakota; it was the famous Gorman Incident, in\r\nwhich a pilot fought a \"duel of death\" with a UFO.\r\n\r\nThe pilot was George F. Gorman, a twenty-five-year-old second\r\nlieutenant in the North Dakota Air National Guard.\r\n\r\nIt was eight-thirty in the evening and Gorman was coming into Fargo\r\nfrom a cross-country flight. He flew around Fargo for a while and\r\nabout nine o'clock decided to land. He called the control tower for\r\nlanding instructions and was told that a Piper Cub was in the area.\r\nHe saw the Cub below him. All of a sudden what appeared to be the\r\ntaillight of another airplane passed him on his right. He called the\r\ntower and complained but they assured him that no other aircraft\r\nexcept the Cub were in the area. Gorman could still see the light so\r\nhe decided to find out what it was. He pushed the F-51 over into a\r\nturn and cut in toward the light. He could plainly see the Cub\r\noutlined against the city lights below, but he could see no outline\r\nof a body near the mysterious light. He gave the '51 more power and\r\nclosed to within a 1,000 yards, close enough to estimate that the\r\nlight was 6 to 8 inches in diameter, was sharply outlined, and was\r\nblinking on and off. Suddenly the light became steady as it\r\napparently put on power; it pulled into a sharp left bank and made a\r\npass at the tower. The light zoomed up with the F-51 in hot pursuit.\r\nAt 7,000 feet it made a turn. Gorman followed and tried to cut inside\r\nthe light's turn to get closer to it but he couldn't do it. The light\r\nmade another turn, and this time the '51 closed on a collision\r\ncourse. The UFO appeared to try to ram the '51, and Gorman had to\r\ndive to get out of the way. The UFO passed over the '51's canopy with\r\nonly a few feet to spare. Again both the F-51 and the object turned\r\nand closed on each other head on, and again the pilot had to dive out\r\nto prevent a collision. All of a sudden the light began to climb and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\"I had the distinct impression that its maneuvers were controlled by\r\nthought or reason,\" Gorman later told ATIC investigators.\r\n\r\nFour other observers at Fargo partially corroborated his story, an\r\noculist, Dr. A. D. Cannon, the Cub's pilot, and his passenger, Einar\r\nNeilson. They saw a light \"moving fast,\" but did not witness all the\r\nmaneuvers that Gorman reported. Two CAA employees on the ground saw a\r\nlight move over the field once.\r\n\r\nProject Sign investigators rushed to Fargo. They had wired ahead to\r\nground the plane. They wanted to check it over before it flew again.\r\nWhen they arrived, only a matter of hours after the incident, they\r\nwent over the airplane, from the prop spinner to the rudder trim tab,\r\nwith a Geiger counter. A chart in the official report shows where\r\nevery Geiger counter reading was taken. For comparison they took\r\nreadings on a similar airplane that hadn't been flown for several\r\ndays. Gorman's airplane was more radioactive. They rushed around, got\r\nsworn statements from the tower operators and oculist, and flew back\r\nto Dayton.\r\n\r\nIn the file on the Gorman Incident I found an old memo reporting the\r\nmeeting that was held upon the ATIC team's return from Fargo. The\r\nmemo concluded that some weird things were taking place.\r\n\r\nThe historians of the UFO agree. Donald Keyhoe, a retired Marine\r\nCorps major and a professional writer, author of _The_ _Flying_\r\n_Saucers_ _Are_ _Real_ and _Flying_ _Saucers_ _from_ _Outer_ _Space_,\r\nneedles the Air Force about the Gorman Incident, pointing out how,\r\nafter feebly hinting that the light could have been a lighted weather\r\nballoon, they dropped it like a hot UFO. Some person by the name of\r\nWilkins, in an equally authoritative book, says that the Gorman\r\nIncident \"stumped\" the Air Force. Other assorted historians point out\r\nthat normally the UFO's are peaceful, Gorman and Mantell just got too\r\ninquisitive, \"they\" just weren't ready to be observed closely. If the\r\nAir Force hadn't slapped down the security lid, these writers might\r\nnot have reached this conclusion. There have been other and more\r\nlurid \"duels of death.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 21, 1952, at 10:58P.M., a Ground Observer Corps spotter\r\nreported that a slow-moving craft was nearing the AEC's Oak Ridge\r\nLaboratory, an area so secret that it is prohibited to aircraft. The\r\nspotter called the light into his filter center and the filter center\r\nrelayed the message to the ground control intercept radar. They had a\r\ntarget. But before they could do more than confirm the GOC spotter's\r\nreport, the target faded from the radarscope.\r\n\r\nAn F-47 aircraft on combat air patrol in the area was vectored in\r\nvisually, spotted a light, and closed on it. They \"fought\" from\r\n10,000 to 27,000 feet, and several times the object made what seemed\r\nto be ramming attacks. The light was described as white, 6 to 8\r\ninches in diameter, and blinking until it put on power. The pilot\r\ncould see no silhouette around the light. The similarity to the Fargo\r\ncase was striking.\r\n\r\nOn the night of December 10, 1952, near another atomic installation,\r\nthe Hanford plant in Washington, the pilot and radar observer of a\r\npatrolling F-94 spotted a light while flying at 26,000 feet. The crew\r\ncalled their ground control station and were told that no planes were\r\nknown to be in the area. They closed on the object and saw a large,\r\nround, white \"thing\" with a dim reddish light coming from two\r\n\"windows.\" They lost visual contact, but got a radar lock-on. They\r\nreported that when they attempted to close on it again it would\r\nreverse direction and dive away. Several times the plane altered\r\ncourse itself because collision seemed imminent.\r\n\r\nIn each of these instances, as well as in the case narrated next,\r\nthe sources of the stories were trained airmen with excellent\r\nreputations. They were sincerely baffled by what they had seen. They\r\nhad no conceivable motive for falsifying or \"dressing up\" their\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nThe other dogfight occurred September 24, 1952, between a Navy pilot\r\nof a TBM and a light over Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe pilot had just finished making some practice passes for night\r\nfighters when he spotted an orange light to the east of his plane. He\r\nchecked on aircraft in the area, learned that the object was\r\nunidentified, and started after it. Here is his report, written\r\nimmediately after he landed:\r\n\r\nAs it [the light] approached the city from the east it started a\r\nleft turn. I started to intercept. During the first part of the chase\r\nthe closest I got to the light was 8 to 10 miles. At this time it\r\nappeared to be as large as an SNJ and had a greenish tail that looked\r\nto be five to six times as long as the light's diameter. This tail\r\nwas seen several times in the next 10 minutes in periods of from 5 to\r\n30 seconds each. As I reached 10,000 feet it appeared to be at 15,000\r\nfeet and in a left turn. It took 40 degrees of bank to keep the nose\r\nof my plane on the light. At this time I estimated the light to be in\r\na 10-to-15-mile orbit.\r\n\r\nAt 12,000 feet I stopped climbing, but the light was still climbing\r\nfaster than I was. I then reversed my turn from left to right and the\r\nlight also reversed. As I was not gaining distance, I held a steady\r\ncourse south trying to estimate a perpendicular between the light and\r\nmyself. The light was moving north, so I turned north. As I turned,\r\nthe light appeared to move west, then south over the base. I again\r\ntried to intercept but the light appeared to climb rapidly at a 60-\r\ndegree angle. It climbed to 35,000 feet, then started a rapid descent.\r\n\r\nPrior to this, while the light was still at approximately 15,000\r\nfeet, I deliberately placed it between the moon and myself three\r\ntimes to try to identify a solid body. I and my two crewmen all had a\r\ngood view of the light as it passed the moon. We could see no solid\r\nbody. We considered the fact that it might be an aerologist's\r\nballoon, but we did not see a silhouette. Also, we would have rapidly\r\ncaught up with and passed a balloon.\r\n\r\nDuring its descent, the light appeared to slow down at about 10,000\r\nfeet, at which time I made three runs on it. Two were on a 90-degree\r\ncollision course, and the light traveled at tremendous speed across\r\nmy bow. On the third run I was so close that the light blanked out\r\nthe airfield below me. Suddenly it started a dive and I followed,\r\nlosing it at 1,500 feet.\r\n\r\nIn _this_ incident the UFO _was_ a balloon.\r\n\r\nThe following night a lighted balloon was sent up and the pilot was\r\nordered up to compare his experiences. He duplicated his dogfight--\r\nillusions and all. The Navy furnished us with a long analysis of the\r\naffair, explaining how the pilot had been fooled.\r\n\r\nIn the case involving the ground observer and the F-47 near the\r\natomic installation, we plotted the winds and calculated that a\r\nlighted balloon was right at the spot where the pilot encountered the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn the other instance, the \"white object with two windows,\" we found\r\nthat a skyhook balloon had been plotted at the exact site of the\r\n\"battle.\"\r\n\r\nGorman fought a lighted balloon too. An analysis of the sighting by\r\nthe Air Weather Service sent to ATIC in a letter dated January 24,\r\n1949, proved it. The radioactive F-51 was decontaminated by a memo\r\nfrom a Wright Field laboratory explaining that a recently flown\r\nairplane will be more radioactive than one that has been on the\r\nground for several days. An airplane at 20,000 to 30,000 feet picks\r\nup more cosmic rays than one shielded by the earth's ever present haze.\r\n\r\nWhy can't experienced pilots recognize a balloon when they see one?\r\nIf they are flying at night, odd things can happen to their vision.\r\nThere is the problem of vertigo as well as disorientation brought on\r\nby flying without points of reference. Night fighters have told\r\ndozens of stories of being fooled by lights.\r\n\r\nOne night during World War II we had just dumped a load of bombs on\r\na target when a \"night fighter\" started to make a pass at us.\r\nEveryone in the cockpit saw the fighter's red-hot exhaust stack as he\r\nbore down on us. I cut loose with six caliber-.50 machine guns.\r\nFortunately I missed the \"night fighter\"--if I'd have shot it I'd\r\nhave fouled up the astronomers but good because the \"night fighter\"\r\nwas Venus.\r\n\r\nWhile the people on Project Sign were pondering over Lieutenant\r\nGorman's dogfight with the UFO--at the time they weren't even\r\nconsidering the balloon angle--the Top Secret Estimate of the\r\nSituation was working its way up into the higher echelons of the Air\r\nForce. It got to the late General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, then Chief of\r\nStaff, before it was batted back down. The general wouldn't buy\r\ninterplanetary vehicles. The report lacked proof. A group from ATIC\r\nwent to the Pentagon to bolster their position but had no luck, the\r\nChief of Staff just couldn't be convinced.\r\n\r\nThe estimate died a quick death. Some months later it was completely\r\ndeclassified and relegated to the incinerator. A few copies, one of\r\nwhich I saw, were kept as mementos of the golden days of the UFO's.\r\n\r\nThe top Air Force command's refusal to buy the interplanetary theory\r\ndidn't have any immediate effect upon the morale of Project Sign\r\nbecause the reports were getting better.\r\n\r\nA belated report that is more of a collectors' item than a good UFO\r\nsighting came into ATIC in the fall of 1948. It was from Moscow.\r\nSomeone, I could never find out exactly who, reported a huge \"smudge-\r\nlike\" object in the sky.\r\n\r\nThen radar came into the picture. For months the anti-saucer\r\nfactions had been pointing their fingers at the lack of radar\r\nreports, saying, \"If they exist, why don't they show up on\r\nradarscopes?\" When they showed up on radarscopes, the UFO won some\r\nconverts.\r\n\r\nOn October 15 an F-61, a World War II \"Black Widow\" night fighter,\r\nwas on patrol over Japan when it picked up an unidentified target on\r\nits radar. The target was flying between 5,000 and 6,000 feet and\r\ntraveling about 200 miles per hour. When the F-61 tried to intercept\r\nit would get to within 12,000 feet of the UFO only to have it\r\naccelerate to an estimated 1,200 miles per hour, leaving the F-61 far\r\nbehind before slowing down again. The F-61 crew made six attempts to\r\nclose on the UFO. On one pass, the crew said, they did get close\r\nenough to see its silhouette. It was 20 to 30 feet long and looked\r\n\"like a rifle bullet.\"\r\n\r\nToward the end of November a wire came into Project Sign from\r\nGermany. It was the first report where a UFO was seen and\r\nsimultaneously picked up on radar. This type of report, the first of\r\nmany to come, is one of the better types of UFO reports. The wire said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 2200 hours, local time, 23 November 1948, Capt. ------ saw an\r\nobject in the air directly east of this base. It was at an unknown\r\naltitude. It looked like a reddish star and was moving in a southerly\r\ndirection across Munich, turning slightly to the southwest then the\r\nsoutheast. The speed could have been between 200 to 600 mph, the\r\nactual speed could not be estimated, not knowing the height. Capt. ---\r\n--- called base operations and they called the radar station. Radar\r\nreported that they had seen nothing on their scope but would check\r\nagain. Radar then called operations to report that they did have a\r\ntarget at 27,000 feet, some 30 miles south of Munich, traveling at\r\n900 mph. Capt. ------ reported that the object that he saw was now in\r\nthat area. A few minutes later radar called again to say that the\r\ntarget had climbed to 50,000 feet, and was circling 40 miles south of\r\nMunich.\r\n\r\nCapt. ------ is an experienced pilot now flying F-80's and is\r\nconsidered to be completely reliable. The sighting was verified by\r\nCapt. ------ , also an F-80 pilot.\r\n\r\nThe possibility that this was a balloon was checked but the answer\r\nfrom Air Weather Service was \"not a balloon.\" No aircraft were in the\r\narea. Nothing we know of, except possibly experimental aircraft,\r\nwhich are not in Germany, can climb 23,000 feet in a matter of\r\nminutes and travel 900 miles per hour.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1948, Project Sign had received several hundred UFO\r\nreports. Of these, 167 had been saved as good reports. About three\r\ndozen were \"Unknown.\" Even though the UFO reports were getting better\r\nand more numerous, the enthusiasm over the interplanetary idea was\r\ncooling off. The same people who had fought to go to Godman AFB to\r\ntalk to Colonel Hix and his UFO observers in January now had to be\r\nprodded when a sighting needed investigating. More and more work was\r\nbeing pushed off onto the other investigative organization that was\r\nhelping ATIC. The kickback on the Top Secret Estimate of the\r\nSituation was beginning to dampen a lot of enthusiasms. It was\r\ndefinitely a bear market for UFO's.\r\n\r\nA bull market was on the way, however. Early 1949 was to bring\r\n\"little lights\" and green fireballs.\r\n\r\nThe \"little lights\" were UFO's, but the green fireballs were real.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR\r\n\r\nGreen Fireballs, Project Twinkle, Little Lights, and Grudge\r\n\r\nAt exactly midnight on September 18, 1954, my telephone rang. It was\r\nJim Phalen, a friend of mine from the Long Beach _Press-Telegram_,\r\nand he had a \"good flying saucer report,\" hot off the wires. He read\r\nit to me. The lead line was: \"Thousands of people saw a huge fireball\r\nlight up dark New Mexico skies tonight.\"\r\n\r\nThe story went on to tell about how a \"blinding green\" fireball the\r\nsize of a full moon had silently streaked southeast across Colorado\r\nand northern New Mexico at eight-forty that night. Thousands of\r\npeople had seen the fireball. It had passed right over a crowded\r\nfootball stadium at Santa Fe, New Mexico, and people in Denver said\r\nit \"turned night into day.\" The crew of a TWA airliner flying into\r\nAlbuquerque from Amarillo, Texas, saw it. Every police and newspaper\r\nswitchboard in the two-state area was jammed with calls.\r\n\r\nOne of the calls was from a man inquiring if anything unusual had\r\nhappened recently. When he was informed about the mysterious fireball\r\nhe heaved an audible sigh of relief, \"Thanks,\" he said, \"I was afraid\r\nI'd gotten some bad bourbon.\" And he hung up.\r\n\r\nDr. Lincoln La Paz, world-famous authority on meteorites and head of\r\nthe University of New Mexico's Institute of Meteoritics, apparently\r\ntook the occurrence calmly. The wire story said he had told a\r\nreporter that he would plot its course, try to determine where it\r\nlanded, and go out and try to find it. \"But,\" he said, \"I don't\r\nexpect to find anything.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Jim Phalen had read the rest of the report he asked, \"What was\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds to me like the green fireballs are back,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil are green fireballs?\"\r\n\r\nWhat the devil _are_ green fireballs? I'd like to know. So would a\r\nlot of other people.\r\n\r\nThe green fireballs streaked into UFO history late in November 1948,\r\nwhen people around Albuquerque, New Mexico, began to report seeing\r\nmysterious \"green flares\" at night. The first reports mentioned only\r\na \"green streak in the sky,\" low on the horizon. From the description\r\nthe Air Force Intelligence people at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque and\r\nthe Project Sign people at ATIC wrote the objects off as flares.\r\nAfter all, thousands of GI's had probably been discharged with a\r\nduffel bag full of \"liberated\" Very pistols and flares.\r\n\r\nBut as days passed the reports got better. They seemed to indicate\r\nthat the \"flares\" were getting larger and more people were reporting\r\nseeing them. It was doubtful if this \"growth\" was psychological\r\nbecause there had been no publicity--so the Air Force decided to\r\nreconsider the \"flare\" answer. They were in the process of doing this\r\non the night of December 5, 1948, a memorable night in the green\r\nfireball chapter of UFO history.\r\n\r\nAt 9:27P.M. on December 5, an Air Force C-47 transport was flying at\r\n18,000 feet 10 miles east of Albuquerque. The pilot was a Captain\r\nGoede. Suddenly the crew, Captain Goede, his co-pilot, and his\r\nengineer were startled by a green ball of fire flashing across the\r\nsky ahead of them. It looked something like a huge meteor except that\r\nit was a bright green color and it didn't arch downward, as meteors\r\nusually do. The green-colored ball of fire had started low, from near\r\nthe eastern slopes of the Sandia Mountains, arched upward a little,\r\nthen seemed to level out. And it was too big for a meteor, at least\r\nit was larger than any meteor that anyone in the C-47 had ever seen\r\nbefore. After a hasty discussion the crew decided that they'd better\r\ntell somebody about it, especially since they had seen an identical\r\nobject twenty-two minutes before near Las Vegas, New Mexico.\r\n\r\nCaptain Goede picked up his microphone and called the control tower\r\nat Kirtland AFB and reported what he and his crew had seen. The tower\r\nrelayed the message to the local intelligence people.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the captain of Pioneer Airlines Flight 63 called\r\nKirtland Tower. At 9:35P.M. he had also seen a green ball of fire\r\njust east of Las Vegas, New Mexico. He was on his way to Albuquerque\r\nand would make a full report when he landed.\r\n\r\nWhen he taxied his DC-3 up to the passenger ramp at Kirtland a few\r\nminutes later, several intelligence officers were waiting for him. He\r\nreported that at 9:35P.M. he was on a westerly heading, approaching\r\nLas Vegas from the east, when he and his co-pilot saw what they first\r\nthought was a \"shooting star.\" It was ahead and a little above them.\r\nBut, the captain said, it took them only a split second to realize\r\nthat whatever they saw was too low and had too flat a trajectory to\r\nbe a meteor. As they watched, the object seemed to approach their\r\nairplane head on, changing color from orange red to green. As it\r\nbecame bigger and bigger, the captain said, he thought sure it was\r\ngoing to collide with them so he racked the DC-3 up in a tight turn.\r\nAs the green ball of fire got abreast of them it began to fall toward\r\nthe ground, getting dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared. Just\r\nbefore he swerved the DC-3, the fireball was as big, or bigger, than\r\na full moon.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence officers asked a few more questions and went back\r\nto their office. More reports, which had been phoned in from all over\r\nnorthern New Mexico, were waiting for them. By morning a full-fledged\r\ninvestigation was under way.\r\n\r\nNo matter what these green fireballs were, the military was getting\r\na little edgy. They might be common meteorites, psychologically\r\nenlarged flares, or true UFO's, but whatever they were they were\r\nplaying around in one of the most sensitive security areas in the\r\nUnited States. Within 100 miles of Albuquerque were two installations\r\nthat were the backbone of the atomic bomb program, Los Alamos and\r\nSandia Base. Scattered throughout the countryside were other\r\ninstallations vital to the defense of the U.S.: radar stations,\r\nfighter-interceptor bases, and the other mysterious areas that had\r\nbeen blocked off by high chain-link fences.\r\n\r\nSince the green fireballs bore some resemblance to meteors or\r\nmeteorites, the Kirtland intelligence officers called in Dr. Lincoln\r\nLa Paz.\r\n\r\nDr. La Paz said that he would be glad to help, so the officers\r\nexplained the strange series of events to him. True, he said, the\r\ndescription of the fireballs did sound as if they might be meteorites\r\n--except for a few points. One way to be sure was to try to plot the\r\nflight path of the green fireballs the same way he had so\r\nsuccessfully plotted the flight path of meteorites in the past. From\r\nthis flight path he could determine where they would have hit the\r\nearth--if they were meteorites. They would search this area, and if\r\nthey found parts of a meteorite they would have the answer to the\r\ngreen fireball riddle.\r\n\r\nThe fireball activity on the night of December 5 was made to order\r\nfor plotting flight paths. The good reports of that night included\r\ncarefully noted locations, the directions in which the green objects\r\nwere seen, their heights above the horizon, and the times when they\r\nwere observed. So early the next morning Dr. La Paz and a crew of\r\nintelligence officers were scouring northern New Mexico. They started\r\nout by talking to the people who had made reports but soon found out\r\nthat dozens of other people had also seen the fireballs. By closely\r\nchecking the time of the observations, they determined that eight\r\nseparate fireballs had been seen. One was evidently more spectacular\r\nand was seen by the most people. Everyone in northern New Mexico had\r\nseen it going from west to east, so Dr. La Paz and his crew worked\r\neastward across New Mexico to the west border of Texas, talking to\r\ndozens of people. After many sleepless hours they finally plotted\r\nwhere it should have struck the earth. They searched the area but\r\nfound nothing. They went back over the area time and time again--\r\nnothing. As Dr. La Paz later told me, this was the first time that he\r\nseriously doubted the green fireballs were meteorites.\r\n\r\nWithin a few more days the fireballs were appearing almost nightly.\r\nThe intelligence officers from Kirtland decided that maybe they could\r\nget a good look at one of them, so on the night of December 8 two\r\nofficers took off in an airplane just before dark and began to cruise\r\naround north of Albuquerque. They had a carefully worked out plan\r\nwhere each man would observe certain details if they saw one of the\r\ngreen fireballs. At 6:33P.M. they saw one. This is their report:\r\n\r\nAt 6:33P.M. while flying at an indicated altitude of 11,500 feet, a\r\nstrange phenomenon was observed. Exact position of the aircraft at\r\ntime of the observation was 20 miles east of the Las Vegas, N.M.,\r\nradio range station. The aircraft was on a compass course of 90\r\ndegrees. Capt. ------ was pilot and I was acting as copilot. I first\r\nobserved the object and a split second later the pilot saw it. It was\r\n2,000 feet higher than the plane, and was approaching the plane at a\r\nrapid rate of speed from 30 degrees to the left of our course. The\r\nobject was similar in appearance to a burning green flare, the kind\r\nthat is commonly used in the Air Force. However, the light was much\r\nmore intense and the object appeared considerably larger than a\r\nnormal flare. The trajectory of the object, when first sighted, was\r\nalmost flat and parallel to the earth. The phenomenon lasted about 2\r\nseconds. At the end of this time the object seemed to begin to burn\r\nout and the trajectory then dropped off rapidly. The phenomenon was\r\nof such intensity as to be visible from the very moment it ignited.\r\n\r\nBack at Wright-Patterson AFB, ATIC was getting a blow-by-blow\r\naccount of the fireball activity but they were taking no direct part\r\nin the investigation. Their main interest was to review all incoming\r\nUFO reports and see if the green fireball reports were actually\r\nunique to the Albuquerque area. They were. Although a good many UFO\r\nreports were coming in from other parts of the U.S., none fit the\r\ndescription of the green fireballs.\r\n\r\nAll during December 1948 and January 1949 the green fireballs\r\ncontinued to invade the New Mexico skies. Everyone, including the\r\nintelligence officers at Kirtland AFB, Air Defense Command people,\r\nDr. La Paz, and some of the most distinguished scientists at Los\r\nAlamos had seen at least one.\r\n\r\nIn mid-February 1949 a conference was called at Los Alamos to\r\ndetermine what should be done to further pursue the investigation.\r\nThe Air Force, Project Sign, the intelligence people at Kirtland, and\r\nother interested parties had done everything they could think of and\r\nstill no answer.\r\n\r\nSuch notable scientists as Dr. Joseph Kaplan, a world-renowned\r\nauthority on the physics of the upper atmosphere, Dr. Edward Teller,\r\nof H-bomb fame, and of course Dr. La Paz, attended, along with a lot\r\nof military brass and scientists from Los Alamos.\r\n\r\nThis was one conference where there was no need to discuss whether\r\nor not this special type of UFO, the green fireball, existed. Almost\r\neveryone at the meeting had seen one. The purpose of the conference\r\nwas to decide whether the fireballs were natural or man-made and how\r\nto find out more about them.\r\n\r\nAs happens in any conference, opinions were divided. Some people\r\nthought the green fireballs were natural fireballs. The proponents of\r\nthe natural meteor, or meteorite, theory presented facts that they\r\nhad dug out of astronomical journals. Greenish-colored meteors,\r\nalthough not common, had been observed on many occasions. The flat\r\ntrajectory, which seemed to be so important in proving that the green\r\nfireballs were extraterrestrial, was also nothing new. When viewed\r\nfrom certain angles, a meteor can appear to have a flat trajectory.\r\nThe reason that so many had been seen during December of 1948 and\r\nJanuary of 1949 was that the weather had been unusually clear all\r\nover the Southwest during this period.\r\n\r\nDr. La Paz led the group who believed that the green fireballs were\r\nnot meteors or meteorites. His argument was derived from the facts\r\nthat he had gained after many days of research and working with Air\r\nForce intelligence teams. He stuck to the points that (1) the\r\ntrajectory was too flat, (2) the color was too green, and (3) he\r\ncouldn't locate any fragments even though he had found the spots\r\nwhere they should have hit the earth if they were meteorites.\r\n\r\nPeople who were at that meeting have told me that Dr. La Paz's\r\ntheory was very interesting and that each point was carefully\r\nconsidered. But evidently it wasn't conclusive enough because when\r\nthe conference broke up, after two days, it was decided that the\r\ngreen fireballs were a natural phenomenon of some kind. It was\r\nrecommended that this phase of the UFO investigation be given to the\r\nAir Force's Cambridge Research Laboratory, since it is the function\r\nof this group to study natural phenomena, and that Cambridge set up a\r\nproject to attempt to photograph the green fireballs and measure\r\ntheir speed, altitude, and size.\r\n\r\nIn the late summer of 1949, Cambridge established Project Twinkle to\r\nsolve the mystery. The project called for establishing three\r\ncinetheodolite stations near White Sands, New Mexico. A\r\ncinetheodolite is similar to a 35-mm. movie camera except when you\r\ntake a photograph of an object you also get a photograph of three\r\ndials that show the time the photo was taken, the azimuth angle, and\r\nthe elevation angle of the camera. If two or more cameras photograph\r\nthe same object, it is possible to obtain a very accurate measurement\r\nof the photographed object's altitude, speed, and size.\r\n\r\nProject Twinkle was a bust. Absolutely nothing was photographed. Of\r\nthe three cameras that were planned for the project, only one was\r\navailable. This one camera was continually being moved from place to\r\nplace. If several reports came from a certain area, the camera crew\r\nwould load up their equipment and move to that area, always arriving\r\ntoo late. Any duck hunter can tell you that this is the wrong tactic;\r\nif you want to shoot any ducks pick a good place and stay put, let\r\nthe ducks come to you.\r\n\r\nThe people trying to operate Project Twinkle were having financial\r\nand morale trouble. To do a good job they needed more and better\r\nequipment and more people, but Air Force budget cuts precluded this.\r\nMoral support was free but they didn't get this either.\r\n\r\nWhen the Korean War started, Project Twinkle silently died, along\r\nwith official interest in green fireballs.\r\n\r\nWhen I organized Project Blue Book in the summer of 1951 I'd never\r\nheard of a green fireball. We had a few files marked \"Los Alamos\r\nConference,\" \"Fireballs,\" \"Project Twinkle,\" etc., but I didn't pay\r\nany attention to them.\r\n\r\nThen one day I was at a meeting in Los Angeles with several other\r\nofficers from ATIC, and was introduced to Dr. Joseph Kaplan. When he\r\nfound we were from ATIC, his first question was, \"What ever happened\r\nto the green fireballs?\" None of us had ever heard of them, so he\r\nquickly gave us the story. He and I ended up discussing green\r\nfireballs. He mentioned Dr. La Paz and his opinion that the green\r\nfireballs might be man-made, and although he respected La Paz's\r\nprofessional ability, he just wasn't convinced. But he did strongly\r\nurge me to get in touch with Dr. La Paz and hear his side of the story.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to ATIC I spent several days digging into our\r\ncollection of green fireball reports. All of these reports covered a\r\nperiod from early December 1948 to 1949. As far as Blue Book's files\r\nwere concerned, there hadn't been a green fireball report for a year\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\nI read over the report on Project Twinkle and the few notes we had\r\non the Los Alamos Conference, and decided that the next time I went\r\nto Albuquerque I'd contact Dr. La Paz. I did go to Albuquerque\r\nseveral times but my visits were always short and I was always in a\r\nhurry so I didn't get to see him.\r\n\r\nIt was six or eight months later before the subject of green\r\nfireballs came up again. I was eating lunch with a group of people at\r\nthe AEC's Los Alamos Laboratory when one of the group mentioned the\r\nmysterious kelly-green balls of fire. The strictly unofficial bull-\r\nsession-type discussion that followed took up the entire lunch hour\r\nand several hours of the afternoon. It was an interesting discussion\r\nbecause these people, all scientists and technicians from the lab,\r\nhad a few educated guesses as to what they might be. All of them had\r\nseen a green fireball, some of them had seen several.\r\n\r\nOne of the men, a private pilot, had encountered a fireball one\r\nnight while he was flying his Navion north of Santa Fe and he had a\r\nvivid way of explaining what he'd seen. \"Take a soft ball and paint\r\nit with some kind of fluorescent paint that will glow a bright green\r\nin the dark,\" I remember his saying, \"then have someone take the ball\r\nout about 100 feet in front of you and about 10 feet above you. Have\r\nhim throw the ball right at your face, as hard as he can throw it.\r\nThat's what a green fireball looks like.\"\r\n\r\nThe speculation about what the green fireballs were ran through the\r\nusual spectrum of answers, a new type of natural phenomenon, a secret\r\nU.S. development, and psychologically enlarged meteors. When the\r\npossibility of the green fireballs' being associated with\r\ninterplanetary vehicles came up, the whole group got serious. They\r\nhad been doing a lot of thinking about this, they said, and they had\r\na theory.\r\n\r\nThe green fireballs, they theorized, could be some type of unmanned\r\ntest vehicle that was being projected into our atmosphere from a\r\n\"spaceship\" hovering several hundred miles above the earth. Two years\r\nago I would have been amazed to hear a group of reputable scientists\r\nmake such a startling statement. Now, however, I took it as a matter\r\nof course. I'd heard the same type of statement many times before\r\nfrom equally qualified groups.\r\n\r\nTurn the tables, they said, suppose that we are going to try to go\r\nto a far planet. There would be three phases to the trip: out through\r\nthe earth's atmosphere, through space, and the re-entry into the\r\natmosphere of the planet we're planning to land on. The first two\r\nphases would admittedly present formidable problems, but the last\r\nphase, the re-entry phase, would be the most critical. Coming in from\r\nouter space, the craft would, for all practical purposes, be similar\r\nto a meteorite except that it would be powered and not free-falling.\r\nYou would have myriad problems associated with aerodynamic heating,\r\nhigh aerodynamic loadings, and very probably a host of other problems\r\nthat no one can now conceive of. Certain of these problems could be\r\npartially solved by laboratory experimentation, but nothing can\r\nreplace flight testing, and the results obtained by flight tests in\r\nour atmosphere would not be valid in another type of atmosphere. The\r\nmost logical way to overcome this difficulty would be to build our\r\ninterplanetary vehicle, go to the planet that we were interested in\r\nlanding on, and hover several hundred miles up. From this altitude we\r\ncould send instrumented test vehicles down to the planet. If we\r\ndidn't want the inhabitants of the planet, if it were inhabited, to\r\nknow what we were doing we could put destruction devices in the test\r\nvehicle, or arrange the test so that the test vehicles would just\r\nplain burn up at a certain point due to aerodynamic heating.\r\n\r\nThey continued, each man injecting his ideas.\r\n\r\nMaybe the green fireballs are test vehicles--somebody else's. The\r\nregular UFO reports might be explained by the fact that the manned\r\nvehicles were venturing down to within 100,000 or 200,000 feet of the\r\nearth, or to the altitude at which atmosphere re-entry begins to get\r\ncritical.\r\n\r\nI had to go down to the airstrip to get a CARCO Airlines plane back\r\nto Albuquerque so I didn't have time to ask a lot of questions that\r\ncame into my mind. I did get to make one comment. From the\r\nconversations, I assumed that these people didn't think the green\r\nfireballs were any kind of a natural phenomenon. Not exactly, they\r\nsaid, but so far the evidence that said they were a natural\r\nphenomenon was vastly outweighed by the evidence that said they\r\nweren't.\r\n\r\nDuring the kidney-jolting trip down the valley from Los Alamos to\r\nAlbuquerque in one of the CARCO Airlines' Bonanzas, I decided that\r\nI'd stay over an extra day and talk to Dr. La Paz.\r\n\r\nHe knew every detail there was to know about the green fireballs. He\r\nconfirmed my findings, that the genuine green fireballs were no\r\nlonger being seen. He said that he'd received hundreds of reports,\r\nespecially after he'd written several articles about the mysterious\r\nfireballs, but that all of the reported objects were just greenish-\r\ncolored, common, everyday meteors.\r\n\r\nDr. La Paz said that some people, including Dr. Joseph Kaplan and\r\nDr. Edward Teller, thought that the green fireballs were natural\r\nmeteors. He didn't think so, however, for several reasons. First the\r\ncolor was so much different. To illustrate his point, Dr. La Paz\r\nopened his desk drawer and took out a well-worn chart of the color\r\nspectrum. He checked off two shades of green; one a pale, almost\r\nyellowish green and the other a much more distinct vivid green. He\r\npointed to the bright green and told me that this was the color of\r\nthe green fireballs. He'd taken this chart with him when he went out\r\nto talk to people who had seen the green fireballs and everyone had\r\npicked this one color. The pale green, he explained, was the color\r\nreported in the cases of documented green meteors.\r\n\r\nThen there were other points of dissimilarity between a meteor and\r\nthe green fireballs. The trajectory of the fireballs was too flat.\r\nDr. La Paz explained that a meteor doesn't necessarily have to arch\r\ndown across the sky, its trajectory can appear to be flat, but not as\r\nflat as that of the green fireballs. Then there was the size. Almost\r\nalways such descriptive words as \"terrifying,\" \"as big as the moon,\"\r\nand \"blinding\" had been used to describe the fireballs. Meteors just\r\naren't this big and bright.\r\n\r\nNo--Dr. La Paz didn't think that they were meteors.\r\n\r\nDr. La Paz didn't believe that they were meteorites either.\r\n\r\nA meteorite is accompanied by sound and shock waves that break\r\nwindows and stampede cattle. Yet in every case of a green fireball\r\nsighting the observers reported that they did not hear any sound.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest mystery of all was the fact that no particles of a\r\ngreen fireball had ever been found. If they were meteorites, Dr. La\r\nPaz was positive that he would have found one. He'd missed very few\r\ntimes in the cases of known meteorites. He pulled a map out of his\r\nfile to show me what he meant. It was a map that he had used to plot\r\nthe spot where a meteorite had hit the earth. I believe it was in\r\nKansas. The map had been prepared from information he had obtained\r\nfrom dozens of people who had seen the meteorite come flaming toward\r\nthe earth. At each spot where an observer was standing he'd drawn in\r\nthe observer's line of sight to the meteorite. From the dozens of\r\nobservers he had obtained dozens of lines of sight. The lines all\r\nconverged to give Dr. La Paz a plot of the meteorite's downward\r\ntrajectory. Then he had been able to plot the spot where it had\r\nstruck the earth. He and his crew went to the marked area, probed the\r\nground with long steel poles, and found the meteorite.\r\n\r\nThis was just one case that he showed me. He had records of many\r\nmore similar successful expeditions in his file.\r\n\r\nThen he showed me some other maps. The plotted lines looked\r\nidentical to the ones on the map I'd just seen. Dr. La Paz had used\r\nthe same techniques on these plots and had marked an area where he\r\nwanted to search. He had searched the area many times but he had\r\nnever found anything.\r\n\r\nThese were plots of the path of a green fireball.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. La Paz had finished, I had one last question, \"What do you\r\nthink they are?\"\r\n\r\nHe weighed the question for a few seconds--then he said that all he\r\ncared to say was that he didn't think that they were a natural\r\nphenomenon. He thought that maybe someday one would hit the earth and\r\nthe mystery would be solved. He hoped that they were a natural\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nAfter my talk with Dr. La Paz I can well understand his apparent\r\ncalmness on the night of September 18, 1954, when the newspaper\r\nreporter called him to find out if he planned to investigate this\r\nlatest green fireball report. He was speaking from experience, not\r\nindifference, when he said, \"But I don't expect to find anything.\"\r\n\r\nIf the green fireballs are back, I hope that Dr. La Paz gets an\r\nanswer this time.\r\n\r\nThe story of the UFO now goes back to late January 1949, the time\r\nwhen the Air Force was in the midst of the green fireball mystery. In\r\nanother part of the country another odd series of events was taking\r\nplace. The center of activity was a highly secret area that can't be\r\nnamed, and the recipient of the UFO's, which were formations of\r\nlittle lights, was the U.S. Army.\r\n\r\nThe series of incidents started when military patrols who were\r\nprotecting the area began to report seeing formations of lights\r\nflying through the night sky. At first the lights were reported every\r\nthree or four nights, but inside of two weeks the frequency had\r\nstepped up. Before long they were a nightly occurrence. Some patrols\r\nreported that they had seen three or four formations in one night.\r\nThe sightings weren't restricted to the men on patrol. One night,\r\njust at dusk, during retreat, the entire garrison watched a formation\r\npass directly over the post parade ground.\r\n\r\nAs usual with UFO reports, the descriptions of the lights varied but\r\nthe majority of the observers reported a V formation of three lights.\r\nAs the formation moved through the sky, the lights changed in color\r\nfrom a bluish white to orange and back to bluish white. This color\r\ncycle took about two seconds. The lights usually traveled from west\r\nto east and made no sound. They didn't streak across the sky like a\r\nmeteor, but they were \"going faster than a jet.\" The lights were \"a\r\nlittle bigger than the biggest star.\" Once in a while the GI's would\r\nget binoculars on them but they couldn't see any more details. The\r\nlights just looked bigger.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the first sighting, reports of the little lights\r\nwere being sent to the Air Force through Army Intelligence channels.\r\nThe reports were getting to ATIC, but the green fireball activity was\r\ntaking top billing and no comments went back to the Army about their\r\nlittle lights. According to an Army G-2 major to whom I talked in the\r\nPentagon, this silence was taken to mean that no action, other than\r\nsending in reports, was necessary on the part of the Army.\r\n\r\nBut after about two weeks of nightly sightings and no apparent\r\naction by the Air Force, the commander of the installation decided to\r\ntake the initiative and set a trap. His staff worked out a plan in\r\nrecord time. Special UFO patrols would be sent out into the security\r\narea and they would be furnished with sighting equipment. This could\r\nbe the equipment that they normally used for fire control. Each\r\npatrol would be sent to a specific location and would set up a\r\ncommand post. Operating out of the command post, at points where the\r\nsky could be observed, would be sighting teams. Each team had\r\nsighting equipment to measure the elevation and azimuth angle of the\r\nUFO. Four men were to be on each team, an instrument man, a timer, a\r\nrecorder, and a radio operator. All the UFO patrols would be assigned\r\nspecial radio frequencies.\r\n\r\nThe operating procedure would be that when one sighting team spotted\r\na UFO the radio operator would call out his team's location, the\r\nlocation of the UFO in the sky, and the direction it was going. All\r\nof the other teams from his patrol would thus know when to look for\r\nthe UFO and begin to sight on it. While the radio man was reporting,\r\nthe instrument man on the team would line up the UFO and begin to\r\ncall out the angles of elevation and azimuth. The timer would call\r\nout the time; the recorder would write all of this down. The command\r\npost, upon hearing the report of the UFO, would call the next patrol\r\nand tell them. They too would try to pick it up.\r\n\r\nHere was an excellent opportunity to get some concrete data on at\r\nleast one type of UFO. It was something that should have been done\r\nfrom the start. Speeds, altitudes, and sizes that are estimated just\r\nby looking at a UFO are miserably inaccurate. But if you could\r\naccurately establish that some type of object was traveling 30,000\r\nmiles an hour--or even 3,000 miles an hour--through our atmosphere,\r\nthe UFO story would be the biggest story since the Creation.\r\n\r\nThe plan seemed foolproof and had the full support of every man who\r\nwas to participate. For the first time in history every GI wanted to\r\nget on the patrols. The plan was quickly written up as a field order,\r\napproved, and mimeographed. Since the Air Force had the prime\r\nresponsibility for the UFO investigation, it was decided that the\r\nplan should be quickly co-ordinated with the Air Force, so a copy was\r\nrushed to them. Time was critical because every group of nightly\r\nreports might be the last. Everything was ready to roll the minute\r\nthe Air Force said \"Go.\"\r\n\r\nThe Air Force didn't O.K. the plan. I don't know where the plan was\r\nkilled, or who killed it, but it was killed. Its death caused two\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\nMany people thought that the plan was killed so that too many people\r\nwouldn't find out the truth about UFO's. Others thought somebody was\r\njust plain stupid. Neither was true. The answer was simply that the\r\nofficial attitude toward UFO's had drastically changed in the past\r\nfew months. They didn't exist, they couldn't exist. It was the belief\r\nat ATIC that the one last mystery, the green fireballs, had been\r\nsolved a few days before at Los Alamos. The fireballs were meteors\r\nand Project Twinkle would prove it. Any further investigation by the\r\nArmy would be a waste of time and effort.\r\n\r\nThis drastic change in official attitude is as difficult to explain\r\nas it was difficult for many people who knew what was going on inside\r\nProject Sign to believe. I use the words \"official attitude\" because\r\nat this time UFO's had become as controversial a subject as they are\r\ntoday. All through intelligence circles people had chosen sides and\r\nthe two UFO factions that exist today were born.\r\n\r\nOn one side was the faction that still believed in flying saucers.\r\nThese people, come hell or high water, were hanging on to their\r\noriginal ideas. Some thought that the UFO's were interplanetary\r\nspaceships. Others weren't quite as bold and just believed that a\r\ngood deal more should be known about the UFO's before they were so\r\ncompletely written off. These people weren't a bunch of nuts or\r\ncrackpots either. They ranged down through the ranks from generals\r\nand top-grade civilians. On the outside their views were backed up by\r\ncivilian scientists.\r\n\r\nOn the other side were those who didn't believe in flying saucers.\r\nAt one time many of them had been believers. When the UFO reports\r\nwere pouring in back in 1947 and 1948, they were just as sure that\r\nthe UFO's were real as the people they were now scoffing at. But they\r\nhad changed their minds. Some of them had changed their minds because\r\nthey had seriously studied the UFO reports and just couldn't see any\r\nevidence that the UFO's were real. But many of them could see the \"I\r\ndon't believe\" band wagon pulling out in front and just jumped on.\r\n\r\nThis change in the operating policy of the UFO project was so\r\npronounced that I, like so many other people, wondered if there was a\r\nhidden reason for the change. Was it actually an attempt to go\r\nunderground--to make the project more secretive? Was it an effort to\r\ncover up the fact that UFO's were proven to be interplanetary and\r\nthat this should be withheld from the public at all cost to prevent a\r\nmass panic? The UFO files are full of references to the near mass\r\npanic of October 30, 1938, when Orson Welles presented his now famous\r\n\"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast.\r\n\r\nThis period of \"mind changing\" bothered me. Here were people\r\ndeciding that there was nothing to this UFO business right at a time\r\nwhen the reports seemed to be getting better. From what I could see,\r\nif there was any mind changing to be done it should have been the\r\nother way, skeptics should have been changing to believers.\r\n\r\nMaybe I was just playing the front man to a big cover-up. I didn't\r\nlike it because if somebody up above me knew that UFO's were really\r\nspacecraft, I could make a big fool out of myself if the truth came\r\nout. I checked into this thoroughly. I spent a lot of time talking to\r\npeople who had worked on Project Grudge.\r\n\r\nThe anti-saucer faction was born because of an old psychological\r\ntrait, people don't like to be losers. To be a loser makes one feel\r\ninferior and incompetent. On September 23, 1947, when the chief of\r\nATIC sent a letter to the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces\r\nstating that UFO's were real, intelligence committed themselves. They\r\nhad to prove it. They tried for a year and a half with no success.\r\nOfficers on top began to get anxious and the press began to get\r\nanxious. They wanted an answer. Intelligence had tried one answer,\r\nthe then Top Secret Estimate of the Situation that \"proved\" that\r\nUFO's were real, but it was kicked back. The people on the UFO\r\nproject began to think maybe the brass didn't consider them too sharp\r\nso they tried a new hypothesis: UFO's don't exist. In no time they\r\nfound that this was easier to prove and it got recognition. Before if\r\nan especially interesting UFO report came in and the Pentagon wanted\r\nan answer, all they'd get was an \"It could be real but we can't prove\r\nit.\" Now such a request got a quick, snappy \"It was a balloon,\" and\r\nfeathers were stuck in caps from ATIC up to the Pentagon. Everybody\r\nfelt fine.\r\n\r\nIn early 1949 the term \"new look\" was well known. The new look in\r\nwomen's fashions was the lower hemlines, in automobiles it was longer\r\nlines. In UFO circles the new look was cuss 'em.\r\n\r\nThe new look in UFO's was officially acknowledged on February 11,\r\n1949, when an order was written that changed the name of the UFO\r\nproject from Project Sign to Project Grudge. The order was supposedly\r\nwritten because the classified name, Project Sign, had been\r\ncompromised. This was always my official answer to any questions\r\nabout the name change. I'd go further and say that the names of the\r\nprojects, first Sign, then Grudge, had no significance. This wasn't\r\ntrue, they did have significance, a lot of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE\r\n\r\nThe Dark Ages\r\n\r\nThe order of February 11, 1949, that changed the name of Project\r\nSign to Project Grudge had not directed any change in the operating\r\npolicy of the project. It had, in fact, pointed out that the project\r\nwas to continue to investigate and evaluate reports of sightings of\r\nunidentified flying objects. In doing this, standard intelligence\r\nprocedures would be used. This normally means the _unbiased_\r\n_evaluation_ of intelligence data. But it doesn't take a great deal\r\nof study of the old UFO files to see that standard intelligence\r\nprocedures were no longer being used by Project Grudge. Everything\r\nwas being evaluated on the premise that UFO's couldn't exist. No\r\nmatter what you see or hear, don't believe it.\r\n\r\nNew people took over Project Grudge. ATIC's top intelligence\r\nspecialists who had been so eager to work on Project Sign were no\r\nlonger working on Project Grudge. Some of them had drastically and\r\nhurriedly changed their minds about UFO's when they thought that the\r\nPentagon was no longer sympathetic to the UFO cause. They were now\r\ndirecting their talents toward more socially acceptable projects.\r\nOther charter members of Project Sign had been \"purged.\" These were\r\nthe people who had refused to change their original opinions about\r\nUFO's.\r\n\r\nWith the new name and the new personnel came the new objective, get\r\nrid of the UFO's. It was never specified this way in writing but it\r\ndidn't take much effort to see that this was the goal of Project\r\nGrudge. This unwritten objective was reflected in every memo, report,\r\nand directive.\r\n\r\nTo reach their objective Project Grudge launched into a campaign\r\nthat opened a new age in the history of the UFO. If a comparative age\r\nin world history can be chosen, the Dark Ages would be most\r\nappropriate. Webster's Dictionary defines the Dark Ages as a period\r\nof \"intellectual stagnation.\"\r\n\r\nTo one who is intimately familiar with UFO history it is clear that\r\nProject Grudge had a two-phase program of UFO annihilation. The first\r\nphase consisted of explaining every UFO report. The second phase was\r\nto tell the public how the Air Force had solved all the sightings.\r\nThis, Project Grudge reasoned, would put an end to UFO reports.\r\n\r\nPhase one had been started by the people of Project Sign. They\r\nrealized that a great many reports were caused by people seeing\r\nballoons or such astronomical bodies as planets, meteors, or stars.\r\nThey also realized that before they could get to the heart of the UFO\r\nproblems they had to sift out this type of report. To do this they\r\nhad called on outside help. Air Weather Service had been asked to\r\nscreen the reports and check those that sounded like balloons against\r\ntheir records of balloon flights. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, distinguished\r\nastrophysicist and head of Ohio State University's Astronomy\r\nDepartment, had been given a contract to sort out those reports that\r\ncould be blamed on stars, planets, meteors, etc. By early March the\r\nAir Weather Service and Dr. Hynek had some positive identifications.\r\nAccording to the old records, with these solutions and those that\r\nSign and Grudge had already found, about 50 per cent of the reported\r\nUFO's could now be positively identified as hoaxes, balloons,\r\nplanets, sundogs, etc. It was now time to start phase two, the\r\npublicity campaign.\r\n\r\nFor many months reporters and writers had been trying to reach\r\nbehind the security wall and get the UFO story from the horse's\r\nmouth, but no luck. Some of them were still trying but they were\r\nhaving no success because they were making the mistake of letting it\r\nslip that they didn't believe that airline pilots, military pilots,\r\nscientists, and just all around solid citizens were having\r\n\"hallucinations,\" perpetrating \"hoaxes,\" or being deceived by the\r\n\"misidentification of common objects.\" The people of Project Grudge\r\nweren't looking for this type of writer, they wanted a writer who\r\nwould listen to them and write their story. As a public relations\r\nofficer later told me, \"We had a devil of a time. All of the writers\r\nwho were after saucer stories had made their own investigations of\r\nsightings and we couldn't convince them they were wrong.\"\r\n\r\nBefore long, however, the right man came along. He was Sidney\r\nShallet, a writer for _The_ _Saturday_ _Evening_ _Post_. He seemed to\r\nhave the prerequisites that were desired, so his visit to ATIC was\r\ncleared through the Pentagon. Harry Haberer, a crack Air Force public\r\nrelations man, was assigned the job of seeing that Shallet got his\r\nstory. I have heard many times, from both military personnel and\r\ncivilians, that the Air Force told Shallet exactly what to say in his\r\narticle--play down the UFO's--don't write anything that even hints\r\nthat there might be something foreign in our skies. I don't believe\r\nthat this is the case. I think that he just wrote the UFO story as it\r\nwas told to him, told to him by Project Grudge.\r\n\r\nShallet's article, which appeared in two parts in the April 30 and\r\nMay 7, 1949, issues of _The_ _Saturday_ _Evening_ _Post_, is\r\nimportant in the history of the UFO and in understanding the UFO\r\nproblem because it had considerable effect on public opinion. Many\r\npeople had, with varying degrees of interest, been wondering about\r\nthe UFO's for over a year and a half. Very few had any definite\r\nopinions one way or the other. The feeling seemed to be that the Air\r\nForce is working on the problem and when they get the answer we'll\r\nknow. There had been a few brief, ambiguous press releases from the\r\nAir Force but these meant nothing. Consequently when Shallet's\r\narticle appeared in the _Post_ it was widely read. It contained\r\nfacts, and the facts had come from Air Force Intelligence. This was\r\nthe Air Force officially reporting on UFO's for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe article was typical of the many flying saucer stories that were\r\nto follow in the later years of UFO history, all written from\r\nmaterial obtained from the Air Force. Shallet's article casually\r\nadmitted that a few UFO sightings couldn't be explained, but the\r\nreader didn't have much chance to think about this fact because 99\r\nper cent of the story was devoted to the anti-saucer side of the\r\nproblem. It was the typical negative approach. I know that the\r\nnegative approach is typical of the way that material is handed out\r\nby the Air Force because I was continually being told to \"tell them\r\nabout the sighting reports we've solved--don't mention the unknowns.\"\r\nI was never ordered to tell this, but it was a strong suggestion and\r\nin the military when higher headquarters suggests, you do.\r\n\r\nShallet's article started out by psychologically conditioning the\r\nreader by using such phrases as \"the great flying saucer scare,\"\r\n\"rich, full-blown screwiness,\" \"fearsome freaks,\" and so forth. By\r\nthe time the reader gets to the meat of the article he feels like a\r\nrich, full-blown jerk for ever even thinking about UFO's.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out how the \"furor\" about UFO reports got so great that\r\nthe Air Force was \"forced\" to investigate the reports reluctantly. He\r\ndidn't mention that two months after the first UFO report ATIC had\r\nasked for Project Sign since they believed that UFO's did exist. Nor\r\ndid it mention the once Top Secret Estimate of the Situation that\r\nalso concluded that UFO's were real. In no way did the article\r\nreflect the excitement and anxiety of the age of Project Sign when\r\nsecret conferences preceded and followed every trip to investigate a\r\nUFO report. This was the Air Force being \"forced\" into reluctantly\r\ninvestigating the UFO reports.\r\n\r\nLaced through the story were the details of several UFO sightings;\r\nsome new and some old, as far as the public was concerned. The\r\noriginal UFO report by Kenneth Arnold couldn't be explained. Arnold,\r\nhowever, had sold his story to _Fate_ magazine and in the same issue\r\nof _Fate_ were stories with such titles as \"Behind the Etheric Veil\"\r\nand \"Invisible Beings Walk the Earth,\" suggesting that Arnold's story\r\nmight fall into the same category. The sightings where the Air Force\r\nhad the answer had detailed explanations. The ones that were unknowns\r\nwere mentioned, but only in passing.\r\n\r\nMany famous names were quoted. The late General Hoyt S. Vanden-berg,\r\nthen Chief of Staff of the Air Force, had seen a flying saucer but it\r\nwas just a reflection on the windshield of his B-17. General Lauris\r\nNorstad's UFO was a reflection of a star on a cloud, and General\r\nCurtis E. Le May found out that one out of six UFO's was a balloon;\r\nColonel McCoy, then chief of ATIC, had seen lots of UFO's. All were\r\nreflections from distant airplanes. In other words, nobody who is\r\nanybody in the Air Force believes in flying saucers.\r\n\r\nFigures in the top echelons of the military had spoken.\r\n\r\nA few hoaxes and crackpot reports rounded out Mr. Shallet's article.\r\n\r\nThe reaction to the article wasn't what the Air Force and ATIC\r\nexpected. They had thought that the public would read the article and\r\ntoss it, and all thoughts of UFO's, into the trash can. But they\r\ndidn't. Within a few days the frequency of UFO reports hit an all-\r\ntime high. People, both military and civilian, evidently didn't much\r\ncare what Generals Vandenberg, Norstad, Le May, or Colonel McCoy\r\nthought; they didn't believe what they were seeing were\r\nhallucinations, reflections, or balloons. What they were seeing were\r\nUFO's, whatever UFO's might be.\r\n\r\nI heard many times from ex-Project Grudge people that Shallet had\r\n\"crossed\" them, he'd vaguely mentioned that there might be a case for\r\nthe UFO. This made him pro-saucer.\r\n\r\nA few days after the last installment of the _Post_ article the Air\r\nForce gave out a long and detailed press release completely debunking\r\nUFO's, but this had no effect. It only seemed to add to the confusion.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that Shallet's article accomplished was to plant a\r\nseed of doubt in many people's minds. Was the Air Force telling the\r\ntruth about UFO's? The public and a large percentage of the military\r\ndidn't know what was going on behind ATIC's barbed-wire fence but\r\nthey did know that a lot of reliable people had seen UFO's. Airline\r\npilots are considered responsible people--airline pilots had seen\r\nUFO's. Experienced military pilots and ground officers are\r\nresponsible people--they'd seen UFO's. Scientists, doctors, lawyers,\r\nmerchants, and plain old Joe Doakes had seen UFO's, and their friends\r\nknew that they were responsible people. Somehow these facts and the\r\ntone of the _Post_ article didn't quite jibe, and when things don't\r\njibe, people get suspicious.\r\n\r\nIn those people who had a good idea of what was going on behind\r\nATIC's barbed wire, the newspaper reporters and writers with the\r\n\"usually reliable sources,\" the _Post_ article planted a bigger seed\r\nof doubt. Why the sudden change in policy they wondered? If UFO's\r\nwere so serious a few months ago, why the sudden debunking? Maybe\r\nShallet's story was a put-up job for the Air Force. Maybe the\r\nsecurity had been tightened. Their sources of information were\r\nreporting that many people in the military did not quite buy the\r\nShallet article. The seed of doubt began to grow, and some of these\r\nwriters began to start \"independent investigations\" to get the \"true\"\r\nstory. Research takes time, so during the summer and fall of 1949\r\nthere wasn't much apparent UFO activity.\r\n\r\nAs the writers began to poke around for their own facts, Project\r\nGrudge lapsed more and more into a period of almost complete\r\ninactivity. Good UFO reports continued to come in at the rate of\r\nabout ten per month but they weren't being verified or investigated.\r\nMost of them were being discarded. There are few, if any, UFO reports\r\nfor the middle and latter part of 1949 in the ATIC files. Only the\r\nlogbook, showing incoming reports, gives any idea of the activity of\r\nthis period. The meager effort that was being made was going into a\r\nreport that evaluated old UFO reports, those received prior to the\r\nspring of 1949. Project Grudge _thought_ that they were writing a\r\nfinal report on the UFO's.\r\n\r\nFrom the small bits of correspondence and memos that were in the\r\nATIC files, it was apparent that Project Grudge thought that the UFO\r\nwas on its way out. Any writers inquiring about UFO activity were\r\nreferred to the debunking press release given out just after the\r\n_Post_ article had been published. There was no more to say. Project\r\nGrudge thought they were winning the UFO battle; the writers thought\r\nthat they were covering up a terrific news story--the story that the\r\nAir Force knew what flying saucers were and weren't telling.\r\n\r\nBy late fall 1949 the material for several UFO stories had been\r\ncollected by writers who had been traveling all over the United\r\nStates talking to people who had seen UFO's. By early winter the\r\nmaterial had been worked up into UFO stories. In December the presses\r\nbegan to roll. _True_ magazine \"scooped\" the world with their story\r\nthat UFO's were from outer space.\r\n\r\nThe _True_ article, entitled, \"The Flying Saucers Are Real,\" was\r\nwritten by Donald Keyhoe. The article opened with a hard punch. In\r\nthe first paragraph Keyhoe concluded that after eight months of\r\nextensive research he had found evidence that the earth was being\r\nclosely scrutinized by intelligent beings. Their vehicles were the so-\r\ncalled flying saucers. Then he proceeded to prove his point. His\r\nargument was built around the three classics: the Mantell, the Chiles-\r\nWhitted, and the Gorman incidents. He took each sighting, detailed\r\nthe \"facts,\" ripped the official Air Force conclusions to shreds, and\r\npresented his own analysis. He threw in a varied assortment of\r\ntechnical facts that gave the article a distinct, authoritative\r\nflavor. This, combined with the fact that _True_ had the name for\r\nprinting the truth, hit the reading public like an 8-inch howitzer.\r\nHours after it appeared in subscribers' mailboxes and on the\r\nnewsstands, radio and TV commentators and newspapers were giving it a\r\nbig play. UFO's were back in business, to stay. True was in business\r\ntoo. It is rumored among magazine publishers that Don Keyhoe's\r\narticle in _True_ was one of the most widely read and widely\r\ndiscussed magazine articles in history.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force had inadvertently helped Keyhoe--in fact, they made\r\nhis story a success. He and several other writers had contacted the\r\nAir Force asking for information for their magazine articles. But,\r\nknowing that the articles were pro-saucer, the writers were\r\nunceremoniously sloughed off. Keyhoe carried his fight right to the\r\ntop, to General Sory Smith, Director of the Office of Public\r\nInformation, but still no dice--the Air Force wasn't divulging any\r\nmore than they had already told. Keyhoe construed this to mean tight\r\nsecurity, the tightest type of security. Keyhoe had one more\r\napproach, however. He was an ex-Annapolis graduate, and among his\r\nclassmates were such people as Admiral Delmar Fahrney, then a top\r\nfigure in the Navy guided missile program and Admiral Calvin Bolster,\r\nthe Director of the Office of Naval Research. He went to see them but\r\nthey couldn't help him. He _knew_ that this meant the real UFO story\r\nwas big and that it could be only one thing--interplanetary\r\nspaceships or earthly weapons--and his contacts denied they were\r\nearthly weapons. He played this security angle in his _True_ article\r\nand in a later book, and it gave the story the needed punch.\r\n\r\nBut the Air Force wasn't trying to cover up. It was just that they\r\ndidn't want Keyhoe or any other saucer fans in their hair. They\r\ncouldn't be bothered. They didn't believe in flying saucers and\r\ncouldn't feature anybody else believing. Believing, to the people in\r\nATIC in 1949, meant even raising the possibility that there might be\r\nsomething to the reports.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force had a plan to counter the Keyhoe article, or any other\r\nstory that might appear. The plan originated at ATIC. It called for a\r\ngeneral officer to hold a short press conference, flash his stars,\r\nand speak the magic words \"hoaxes, hallucinations, and the\r\nmisidentification of known objects,\" _True_, Keyhoe and the rest\r\nwould go broke trying to peddle their magazines. The _True_ article\r\ndid come out, the general spoke, the public laughed, and Keyhoe and\r\n_True_ got rich. Only the other magazines that had planned to run UFO\r\nstories, and that were scooped by _True_, lost out. Their stories\r\nwere killed--they would have been an anti-climax to Keyhoe's potboiler.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force's short press conference was followed by a press\r\nrelease. On December 27, 1949, it was announced that Project Grudge\r\nhad been closed out and the final report on UFO's would be released\r\nto the press in a few days. When it was released it caused widespread\r\ninterest because, supposedly, this was all that the Air Force knew\r\nabout UFO's. Once again, instead of throwing large amounts of cold\r\nwater on the UFO's, it only caused more confusion.\r\n\r\nThe report was officially titled \"Unidentified Flying Objects--\r\nProject Grudge,\" Technical Report No. 102-AC-49/15-100. But it was\r\nwidely referred to as the Grudge Report.\r\n\r\nThe Grudge Report was a typical military report. There was the body\r\nof the report, which contained the short discussion, conclusions, and\r\nrecommendations. Then there were several appendixes that were\r\nsupposed to substantiate the conclusions and recommendations made in\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\nOne of the appendixes was the final report of Dr. J. Allen Hynek,\r\nProject Grudge's contract astronomer. Dr. Hynek and his staff had\r\nstudied 237 of the best UFO reports. They had spent several months\r\nanalyzing each report. By searching through astronomical journals and\r\nchecking the location of various celestial bodies, they found that\r\nsome UFO's could be explained. Of the 237 reports he and his staff\r\nexamined, 32 per cent could be explained astronomically.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force Air Weather Service and the Air Force Cambridge\r\nResearch Laboratory had sifted the reports for UFO's that might have\r\nbeen balloons. These two organizations had data on the flights of\r\nboth the regular weather balloons and the huge, high-flying skyhooks.\r\nThey wrote off 12 per cent of the 237 UFO reports under study as\r\nballoons.\r\n\r\nThis left 56 per cent still unknown. By weeding out the hoaxes, the\r\nreports that were too nebulous to evaluate, and reports that could\r\nwell be misidentified airplanes, Project Grudge disposed of another\r\n33 per cent of the reports. This left 23 per cent that fell in the\r\n\"unknown\" category.\r\n\r\nThere were more appendixes. The Rand Corporation, one of the most\r\nunpublicized yet highly competent contractors to the Air Force,\r\nlooked over the reports and made the statement, \"We have found\r\nnothing which would seriously controvert simple rational explanations\r\nof the various phenomena in terms of balloons, conventional aircraft,\r\nplanets, meteors, bits of paper, optical illusions, practical jokers,\r\npsychopathological reporters, and the like.\" But Rand's comment\r\ndidn't help a great deal because they didn't come up with any\r\nsolutions to any of the 23 per cent unknown.\r\n\r\nThe Psychology Branch of the Air Force's Aeromedical Laboratory took\r\na pass at the psychological angles. They said, \"there are sufficient\r\npsychological explanations for the reports of unidentified objects to\r\nprovide plausible explanations for reports not otherwise\r\nexplainable.\" They pointed out that some people have \"spots in front\r\nof their eyes\" due to minute solid particles that float about in the\r\nfluids of the eye and cast shadows on the retina. Then they pointed\r\nout that some people are just plain nuts. Many people who read the\r\nGrudge Report took these two points to mean that all UFO observers\r\neither had spots in front of their eyes or were nuts. They broke the\r\nreports down statistically. The people who wrote the report found\r\nthat over 70 per cent of the people making sightings reported a light-\r\ncolored object. (This I doubt, but that's what the report said.) They\r\nsaid a big point of these reports of light-colored objects was that\r\nany high-flying object will appear to be dark against the sky. For\r\nthis reason the UFO's couldn't be real.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the next time you are outdoors and see a bomber go\r\nover at high altitude you look at it closely. Unless it's painted a\r\ndark color it won't look dark.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Weather Bureau wrote an extremely comprehensive and\r\ninteresting report on all types of lightning. It was included in the\r\nGrudge Report but contained a note: \"None of the recorded incidents\r\nappear to have been lightning.\"\r\n\r\nThere was one last appendix. It was entitled \"Summary of the\r\nEvaluation of Remaining Reports.\" What the title meant was, We have\r\n23 per cent of the reports that we can't explain but we have to\r\nexplain them because we don't believe in flying saucers. This\r\nappendix contributed greatly to the usage of the analogy to the Dark\r\nAges, the age of \"intellectual stagnation.\"\r\n\r\nThis appendix was important--it was the meat of the whole report.\r\nEvery UFO sighting had been carefully checked, and those with answers\r\nhad been sifted out. Then the ones listed in \"Summary of the\r\nEvaluation of Remaining Reports\" should be the best UFO reports--the\r\nones with no answers.\r\n\r\nThis was the appendix that the newsmen grabbed at when the Grudge\r\nReport was released. It contained the big story. But if you'll check\r\nback through old newspaper files you will hardly find a mention of\r\nthe Grudge Report.\r\n\r\nI was told that reporters just didn't believe it when I tried to\r\nfind out why the Grudge Report hadn't been mentioned in the\r\nnewspapers. I got the story from a newspaper correspondent in\r\nWashington whom I came to know pretty well and who kept me filled in\r\non the latest UFO scuttlebutt being passed around the Washington\r\npress circles. He was one of those humans who had a brain like a\r\nfiling cabinet; he could remember everything about everything. UFO's\r\nwere a hobby of his. He remembered when the Grudge Report came out;\r\nin fact, he'd managed to get a copy of his own. He said the report\r\nhad been quite impressive, but only in its ambiguousness, illogical\r\nreasoning, and very apparent effort to write off all UFO reports at\r\nany cost. He, personally, thought that it was a poor attempt to put\r\nout a \"fake\" report, full of misleading information, to cover up the\r\nreal story. Others, he told me, just plainly and simply didn't know\r\nwhat to think--they were confused.\r\n\r\nAnd they had every right to be confused.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the way that many of the better reports of the 1947-\r\n49 period were \"evaluated\" let's take the report of a pilot who\r\ntangled with a UFO near Washington, D.C., on the night of November\r\n18, 1948.\r\n\r\nAt about 9:45 EST I noticed a light moving generally north to south\r\nover Andrews AFB. It appeared to be one continuous, glowing white\r\nlight. I thought it was an aircraft with only one landing light so I\r\nmoved in closer to check, as I wanted to get into the landing\r\npattern. I was well above landing traffic altitude at this time. As I\r\nneared the light I noticed that it was not another airplane. Just\r\nthen it began to take violent evasive action so I tried to close on\r\nit. I made first contact at 2,700 feet over the field. I switched my\r\nnavigation lights on and off but got no answer so I went in closer--\r\nbut the light quickly flew up and over my airplane. I then tried to\r\nclose again but the light turned. I tried to turn inside of its turn\r\nand, at the same time, get the light between the moon and me, but\r\neven with my flaps lowered I couldn't turn inside the light. I never\r\ndid manage to get into a position where the light was silhouetted\r\nagainst the moon.\r\n\r\nI chased the light up and down and around for about 10 minutes, then\r\nas a last resort I made a pass and turned on my landing lights. Just\r\nbefore the object made a final tight turn and headed for the coast I\r\nsaw that it was a dark gray oval-shaped object, smaller than my T-6.\r\nI couldn't tell if the light was on the object or if the whole object\r\nhad been glowing.\r\n\r\nTwo officers and a crew chief, a master sergeant, completely\r\ncorroborated the pilot's report. They had been standing on the flight\r\nline and had witnessed the entire incident.\r\n\r\nThe Air Weather Service, who had been called in as experts on\r\nweather balloons, read this report. They said, \"Definitely not a\r\nballoon.\" Dr. Hynek said, \"No astronomical explanation.\" It wasn't\r\nanother airplane and it wasn't a hallucination.\r\n\r\nBut Project Grudge had an answer, it _was_ a weather balloon. There\r\nwas no explanation as to why they had so glibly reversed the decision\r\nof the Air Weather Service.\r\n\r\nThere was an answer for every report.\r\n\r\nFrom the 600 pages of appendixes, discussions of the appendixes, and\r\ncareful studies of UFO reports, it was concluded that:\r\n\r\nEvaluation of reports of unidentified flying objects constitute no\r\ndirect threat to the national security of the United States.\r\n\r\nReports of unidentified flying objects are the result of:\r\n\r\nA mild form of mass hysteria or \"war nerves.\"\r\n\r\nIndividuals who fabricate such reports to perpetrate a hoax or seek\r\npublicity.\r\n\r\nPsychopathological persons.\r\n\r\nMisidentification of various conventional objects.\r\n\r\nIt was recommended that Project Grudge be \"reduced in scope\" and\r\nthat only \"those reports clearly indicating realistic technical\r\napplications\" be sent to Grudge. There was a note below these\r\nrecommendations. It said, \"It is readily apparent that further study\r\nalong present lines would only confirm the findings presented herein.\"\r\n\r\nSomebody read the note and concurred because with the completion and\r\napproval of the Grudge Report, Project Grudge folded. People could\r\nrant and rave, see flying saucers, pink elephants, sea serpents, or\r\nHarvey, but it was no concern of ATIC's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX\r\n\r\nThe Presses Roll--The Air Force Shrugs\r\n\r\nThe Grudge Report was supposedly not for general distribution. A few\r\ncopies were sent to the Air Force Press Desk in the Pentagon and\r\nreporters and writers could come in and read it. But a good many\r\ncopies did get into circulation. The Air Force Press Room wasn't the\r\nbest place to sit and study a 600-page report, and a quick glance at\r\nthe report showed that it required some study--if no more than to\r\nfind out what the authors were trying to prove--so several dozen\r\ncopies got into circulation. I know that these \"liberated\" copies of\r\nthe Grudge Report had been thoroughly studied because nearly every\r\nwriter who came to ATIC during the time that I was in charge of\r\nProject Blue Book carried a copy.\r\n\r\nSince the press had some questions about the motives behind\r\nreleasing the Grudge Report, it received very little publicity while\r\nthe writers put out feelers. Consequently in early 1950 you didn't\r\nread much about flying saucers.\r\n\r\nEvidently certain people in the Air Force thought this lull in\r\npublicity meant that the UFO's had finally died because Project\r\nGrudge was junked. All the project files, hundreds of pounds of\r\nreports, memos, photos, sketches, and other assorted bits of paper\r\nwere unceremoniously yanked out of their filing cabinets, tied up\r\nwith string, and chucked into an old storage case. I would guess that\r\nmany reports ended up as \"souvenirs\" because a year later, when I\r\nexhumed these files, there were a lot of reports missing.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the official Air Force UFO project had one last post-\r\ndeath muscular spasm. The last bundle of reports had just landed on\r\ntop of the pile in the storage case when ATIC received a letter from\r\nthe Director of Intelligence of the Air Force. In official language\r\nit said, \"What gives?\" There had been no order to end Project Grudge.\r\nThe answer went back that Project Grudge had not been disbanded; the\r\nproject functions had been transferred and it was no longer a\r\n\"special\" project. From now on UFO reports would be processed through\r\nnormal intelligence channels along with other intelligence reports.\r\n\r\nTo show good faith ATIC requested permission to issue a new Air\r\nForce-wide bulletin which was duly mimeographed and disseminated. In\r\nessence it said that Air Force Headquarters had directed ATIC to\r\ncontinue to collect and evaluate reports of unidentified flying\r\nobjects. It went on to explain that most UFO reports were trash. It\r\npointed out the findings of the Grudge Report in such strong language\r\nthat by the time the recipient of the bulletin had finished reading\r\nit, he would be ashamed to send in a report. To cinch the deal the\r\nbulletins must have been disseminated only to troops in Outer\r\nMongolia because I never found anyone in the field who had ever\r\nreceived a copy.\r\n\r\nAs the Air Force UFO-investigating activity dropped to nil, the\r\npress activity skyrocketed to a new peak. A dozen people took off to\r\ndig up their own UFO stories and to draw their own conclusions.\r\n\r\nAfter a quiet January, _True_ again clobbered the reading public.\r\nThis time it was a story in the March 1950 issue and it was entitled,\r\n\"How Scientists Tracked Flying Saucers.\" It was written by none other\r\nthan the man who was at that time in charge of a team of Navy\r\nscientists at the super hush-hush guided missile test and development\r\narea, White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. He was Commander R. B.\r\nMcLaughlin, an Annapolis graduate and a Regular Navy officer. His\r\nstory had been cleared by the military and was in absolute, 180-\r\ndegree, direct contradiction to every press release that had been\r\nmade by the military in the past two years. Not only did the\r\ncommander believe that he had proved that UFO's were real but that he\r\nknew what they were. \"I am convinced,\" he wrote in the _True_\r\narticle, \"that it,\" referring to a UFO he had seen at White Sands,\r\n\"was a flying saucer, and further, that these disks are spaceships\r\nfrom another planet, operated by animate, intelligent beings.\"\r\n\r\nOn several occasions during 1948 and 1949, McLaughlin or his crew at\r\nthe White Sands Proving Ground had made good UFO sightings. The best\r\none was made on April 24, 1949, when the commander's crew of\r\nengineers, scientists, and technicians were getting ready to launch\r\none of the huge 100-foot-diameter skyhook balloons. It was 10:30A.M.\r\non an absolutely clear Sunday morning. Prior to the launching, the\r\ncrew had sent up a small weather balloon to check the winds at lower\r\nlevels. One man was watching the balloon through a theodolite, an\r\ninstrument similar to a surveyor's transit built around a 25-power\r\ntelescope, one man was holding a stop watch, and a third had a\r\nclipboard to record the measured data. The crew had tracked the\r\nballoon to about 10,000 feet when one of them suddenly shouted and\r\npointed off to the left. The whole crew looked at the part of the sky\r\nwhere the man was excitedly pointing, and there was a UFO. \"It didn't\r\nappear to be large,\" one of the scientists later said, \"but it was\r\nplainly visible. It was easy to see that it was elliptical in shape\r\nand had a 'whitish-silver color.'\" After taking a split second to\r\nrealize what they were looking at, one of the men swung the\r\ntheodolite around to pick up the object, and the timer reset his stop\r\nwatch. For sixty seconds they tracked the UFO as it moved toward the\r\neast. In about fifty-five seconds it had dropped from an angle of\r\nelevation of 45 degrees to 25 degrees, then it zoomed upward and in a\r\nfew seconds it was out of sight. The crew heard no sound and the New\r\nMexico desert was so calm that day that they could have heard \"a\r\nwhisper a mile away.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they reduced the data they had collected, McLaughlin and crew\r\nfound out that the UFO had been traveling 4 degrees per second. At\r\none time during the observed portion of its flight, the UFO had\r\npassed in front of a range of mountains that were visible to the\r\nobservers. Using this as a check point, they estimated the size of\r\nthe UFO to be 40 feet wide and 100 feet long, and they computed that\r\nthe UFO had been at an altitude of 296,000 feet, or _56_ miles, when\r\nthey had first seen it, and that it was traveling 7 miles per second.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't the only UFO sighting made by White Sands scientists. On\r\nApril 5, 1948, another team watched a UFO for several minutes as it\r\nstreaked across the afternoon sky in a series of violent maneuvers.\r\nThe disk-shaped object was about a fifth the size of a full moon.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the crew of a C-47 that was tracking a skyhook\r\nballoon saw two similar UFO's come loping in from just above the\r\nhorizon, circle the balloon, which was flying at just under 90,000\r\nfeet, and rapidly leave. When the balloon was recovered it was ripped.\r\n\r\nI knew the two pilots of the C-47; both of them now believe in\r\nflying saucers. And they aren't alone; so do the people of the\r\nAeronautical Division of General Mills who launch and track the big\r\nskyhook balloons. These scientists and engineers all have seen UFO's\r\nand they aren't their own balloons. I was almost tossed out of the\r\nGeneral Mills offices into a cold January Minneapolis snowstorm for\r\nsuggesting such a thing--but that comes later in our history of the\r\nUFO.\r\n\r\nI don't know what these people saw. There has been a lot of interest\r\ngenerated by these sightings because of the extremely high\r\nqualifications and caliber of the observers. There is some legitimate\r\ndoubt as to the accuracy of the speed and altitude figures that\r\nMcLaughlin's crew arrived at from the data they measured with their\r\ntheodolite. This doesn't mean much, however. Even if they were off by\r\na factor of 100 per cent, the speeds and altitudes would be\r\nfantastic, and besides they looked at the UFO through a 25-power\r\ntelescope and swore that it was a flat, oval-shaped object. Balloons,\r\nbirds, and airplanes aren't flat and oval-shaped.\r\n\r\nAstrophysicist Dr. Donald Menzel, in a book entitled _Flying_\r\n_Saucers_, says they saw a refracted image of their own balloon\r\ncaused by an atmospheric phenomenon. Maybe he is right, but the\r\nGeneral Mills people don't believe it. And their disagreement is\r\nbacked up by years of practical experience with the atmosphere, its\r\ntricks and its illusions.\r\n\r\nWhen the March issue of _True_ magazine carrying Commander\r\nMcLaughlin's story about how the White Sands Scientists had tracked\r\nUFO's reached the public, it stirred up a hornets' nest. Donald\r\nKeyhoe's article in the January _True_ had converted many people but\r\nthere were still a few heathens. The fact that government scientists\r\nhad seen UFO's, and were admitting it, took care of a large\r\npercentage of these heathens. More and more people were believing in\r\nflying saucers.\r\n\r\nThe Navy had no comment to make about the sightings, but they did\r\ncomment on McLaughlin. It seems that several months before, at the\r\nsuggestion of a group of scientists at White Sands, McLaughlin had\r\ncarefully written up the details of the sightings and forwarded them\r\nto Washington. The report contained no personal opinions, just facts.\r\nThe comments on McLaughlin's report had been wired back to White\r\nSands from Washington and they were, \"What are you drinking out\r\nthere?\" A very intelligent answer--and it came from an admiral in the\r\nNavy's guided missile program.\r\n\r\nBy the time his story was published, McLaughlin was no longer at\r\nWhite Sands; he was at sea on the destroyer _Bristol_. Maybe he\r\nanswered the admiral's wire.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force had no comment to make on McLaughlin's story. People\r\nat ATIC just shrugged and smiled as they walked by the remains of\r\nProject Grudge, and continued to \"process UFO reports through regular\r\nintelligence channels.\"\r\n\r\nIn early 1950 the UFO's moved down to Mexico. The newspapers were\r\nfull of reports. Tourists were bringing back more saucer stories than\r\nhand-tooled, genuine leather purses. _Time_ reported that pickpockets\r\nwere doing a fabulous business working the sky-gazing crowds that\r\ngathered when a _plativolo_ was seen. Mexico's Department of National\r\nDefense reported that there had been some good reports but that the\r\nstories of finding crashed saucers weren't true.\r\n\r\nOn March 8 one of the best UFO sightings of 1950 took place right\r\nover ATIC.\r\n\r\nAbout midmorning on this date a TWA airliner was coming in to land\r\nat the Dayton Municipal Airport. As the pilot circled to get into the\r\ntraffic pattern, he and his copilot saw a bright light hovering off\r\nto the southeast. The pilot called the tower operators at the airport\r\nto tell them about the light, but before he could say anything, the\r\ntower operators told him they were looking at it too. They had called\r\nthe operations office of the Ohio Air National Guard, which was\r\nlocated at the airport, and while the tower operators were talking,\r\nan Air Guard pilot was running toward an F-51, dragging his\r\nparachute, helmet, and oxygen mask.\r\n\r\nI knew the pilot, and he later told me, \"I wanted to find out once\r\nand for all what these screwy flying saucer reports were all about.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the F-51 was warming up, the tower operators called ATIC and\r\ntold them about the UFO and where to look to see it. The people at\r\nATIC rushed out and there it was--an extremely bright light, much\r\nbrighter and larger than a star. Whatever it was, it was high because\r\nevery once in a while it would be blanked out by the thick, high,\r\nscattered clouds that were in the area. While the group of people\r\nwere standing in front of ATIC watching the light, somebody ran in\r\nand called the radar lab at Wright Field to see if they had any radar\r\n\"on the air.\" The people in the lab said that they didn't have, but\r\nthey could get operational in a hurry. They said they would search\r\nsoutheast of the field with their radar and suggested that ATIC send\r\nsome people over. By the time the ATIC people arrived at the radar\r\nlab the radar was on the air and had a target in the same position as\r\nthe light that everyone was looking at. The radar was also picking up\r\nthe Air Guard F-51 and an F-51 that had been scrambled from Wright-\r\nPatterson. The pilots of the Air Guard '51 and the Wright-Patterson\r\n'51 could both see the UFO, and they were going after it. The master\r\nsergeant who was operating the radar called the F-51's on the radio,\r\ngot them together and started to vector them toward the target. As\r\nthe two airplanes climbed they kept up a continual conversation with\r\nthe radar operator to make sure they were all after the same thing.\r\nFor several minutes they could clearly see the UFO, but when they\r\nreached about 15,000 feet, the clouds moved in and they lost it. The\r\npilots made a quick decision; since radar showed that they were\r\ngetting closer to the target, they decided to spread out to keep from\r\ncolliding with one another and to go up through the clouds. They went\r\non instruments and in a few seconds they were in the cloud. It was\r\nmuch worse than they'd expected; the cloud was thick, and the\r\nairplanes were icing up fast. An F-51 is far from being a good\r\ninstrument ship, but they stayed in their climb until radar called\r\nand said that they were close to the target; in fact, almost on it.\r\nThe pilots had another hurried radio conference and decided that\r\nsince the weather was so bad they'd better come down. If a UFO, or\r\nsomething, was in the clouds, they'd hit it before they could see it.\r\nSo they made a wise decision; they dropped the noses of their\r\nairplanes and dove back down into the clear. They circled awhile but\r\nthe clouds didn't break. In a few minutes the master sergeant on the\r\nradar reported that the target was fading fast. The F-51's went in\r\nand landed.\r\n\r\nWhen the target faded on the radar, some of the people went outside\r\nto visually look for the UFO, but it was obscured by clouds, and the\r\nclouds stayed for an hour. When it finally did clear for a few\r\nminutes, the UFO was gone.\r\n\r\nA conference was held at ATIC that afternoon. It included Roy James,\r\nATIC's electronics specialist and expert on radar UFO's. Roy had been\r\nover at the radar lab and had seen the UFO on the scope but neither\r\nthe F-51 pilots nor the master sergeant who operated the radar were\r\nat the conference. The records show that at this meeting a unanimous\r\ndecision was reached as to the identity of the UFO's. The bright\r\nlight was Venus since Venus was in the southeast during midmorning on\r\nMarch 8, 1950, and the radar return was caused by the ice-laden cloud\r\nthat the F-51 pilots had encountered. Ice-laden clouds can cause a\r\nradar return. The group of intelligence specialists at the meeting\r\ndecided that this was further proved by the fact that as the F-51's\r\napproached the center of the cloud their radar return appeared to\r\napproach the UFO target on the radarscope. They were near the UFO and\r\nnear ice, so the UFO must have been ice.\r\n\r\nThe case was closed.\r\n\r\nI had read the report of this sighting but I hadn't paid too much\r\nattention to it because it had been \"solved.\" But one day almost two\r\nyears later I got a telephone call at my office at Project Blue Book.\r\nIt was a master sergeant, the master sergeant who had been operating\r\nthe radar at the lab. He'd just heard that the Air Force was again\r\nseriously investigating UFO's and he wanted to see what had been said\r\nabout the Dayton Incident. He came over, read the report, and\r\nviolently disagreed with what had been decided upon as the answer. He\r\nsaid that he'd been working with radar before World War II; he'd\r\nhelped with the operational tests on the first microwave warning\r\nradars developed early in the war by a group headed by Dr. Luis\r\nAlvarez. He said that what he saw on that radarscope was no ice\r\ncloud; it was some type of aircraft. He'd seen every conceivable type\r\nof weather target on radar, he told me; thunderstorms, ice-laden\r\nclouds, targets caused by temperature inversions, and the works. They\r\nall had similar characteristics--the target was \"fuzzy\" and varied in\r\nintensity. But in this case the target was a good, solid return and\r\nhe was convinced that it was caused by a good, solid object. And\r\nbesides, he said, when the target began to fade on his scope he had\r\nraised the tilt of the antenna and the target came back, indicating\r\nthat whatever it was, it was climbing. Ice-laden clouds don't climb,\r\nhe commented rather bitterly.\r\n\r\nNor did the pilot of one of the F-51's agree with the ATIC analysis.\r\nThe pilot who had been leading the two-ship flight of F-51's on that\r\nday told me that what he saw was no planet. While he and his wing man\r\nwere climbing, and before the clouds obscured it, they both got a\r\ngood look at the UFO, and it was getting bigger and more distinct all\r\nthe time. As they climbed, the light began to take on a shape; it was\r\ndefinitely round. And if it had been Venus it should have been in the\r\nsame part of the sky the next day, but the pilot said that he'd\r\nlooked and it wasn't there. The ATIC report doesn't mention this point.\r\n\r\nI remember asking him a second time what the UFO looked like; he\r\nsaid, \"huge and metallic\"--shades of the Mantell Incident.\r\n\r\nThe Dayton Incident didn't get much of a play from the press because\r\nofficially it wasn't an unknown and there's nothing intriguing about\r\nan ice cloud and Venus. There were UFO reports in the newspapers,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nOne story that was widely printed was about a sighting at the naval\r\nair station at Dallas, Texas. Just before noon on March 16, Chief\r\nPetty Officer Charles Lewis saw a disk-shaped UFO come streaking\r\nacross the sky and buzz a high-flying B-36. Lewis first saw the UFO\r\ncoming in from the north, lower than the B-36; then he saw it pull up\r\nto the big bomber as it got closer. It hovered under the B-36 for an\r\ninstant, then it went speeding off and disappeared. When the press\r\ninquired about the incident, Captain M. A. Nation, commander of the\r\nair station, vouched for his chief and added that the base tower\r\noperators had seen and reported a UFO to him about ten days before.\r\n\r\nThis story didn't run long because the next day a bigger one broke\r\nwhen the sky over the little town of Farmington, New Mexico, about\r\n170 miles northwest of Albuquerque, was literally invaded by UFO's.\r\nEvery major newspaper carried the story. The UFO's had apparently\r\nbeen congregating over the four corners area for two days because\r\nseveral people had reported seeing UFO's on March 15 and 16. But the\r\nseventeenth was the big day, every saucer this side of Polaris must\r\nhave made a successful rendezvous over Farmington, because on that\r\nday most of the town's 3,600 citizens saw the mass fly-by. The first\r\nreports were made at 10:15A.M.; then for an hour the air was full of\r\nflying saucers. Estimates of the number varied from a conservative\r\n500 to \"thousands.\" Most all the observers said the UFO's were saucer-\r\nshaped, traveled at almost unbelievable speeds, and didn't seem to\r\nhave any set flight path. They would dart in and out and seemed to\r\navoid collisions only by inches. There was no doubt that they weren't\r\nhallucinations because the mayor, the local newspaper staff, ex-\r\npilots, the highway patrol, and every type of person who makes up a\r\ncommunity of 3,600 saw them.\r\n\r\nI've talked to several people who were in Farmington and saw this\r\nnow famous UFO display of St. Patrick's Day, 1950. I've heard dozens\r\nof explanations--cotton blowing in the wind, bugs' wings reflecting\r\nsunlight, a hoax to put Farmington on the map, and real honest-to-\r\ngoodness flying saucers. One explanation was never publicized,\r\nhowever, and if there is an explanation, it is the best. Under\r\ncertain conditions of extreme cold, probably 50 to 60 degrees below\r\nzero, the plastic bag of a skyhook balloon will get very brittle, and\r\nwill take on the characteristics of a huge light bulb. If a sudden\r\ngust of wind or some other disturbance hits the balloon, it will\r\nshatter into a thousand pieces. As these pieces of plastic float down\r\nand are carried along by the wind, they could look like thousands of\r\nflying saucers.\r\n\r\nOn St. Patrick's Day a skyhook balloon launched from Holloman AFB,\r\nadjacent to the White Sands Proving Ground, did burst near\r\nFarmington, and it was cold enough at 60,000 feet to make the balloon\r\nbrittle. True, the people at Farmington never found any pieces of\r\nplastic, but the small pieces of plastic are literally as light as\r\nfeathers and could have floated far beyond the city.\r\n\r\nThe next day, on March 18, the Air Force, prodded by the press,\r\nshrugged and said, \"There's nothing to it,\" but they had no\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n_True_ magazine came through for a third time when their April\r\nissue, which was published during the latter part of March 1950,\r\ncarried a roundup of UFO photos. They offered seven photos as proof\r\nthat UFO's existed. It didn't take a photo-interpretation expert to\r\ntell that all seven could well be of doubtful lineage, nevertheless\r\nthe collection of photos added fuel to the already smoldering fire.\r\nThe U.S. public was hearing a lot about flying saucers and all of it\r\nwas on the pro side. For somebody who didn't believe in the things,\r\nthe public thought that the Air Force was being mighty quiet.\r\n\r\nThe subject took on added interest on the night of March 26, when a\r\nfamous news commentator said the UFO's were from Russia.\r\n\r\nThe next night Henry J. Taylor, in a broadcast from Dallas, Texas,\r\nsaid that the UFO's were Uncle Sam's own. He couldn't tell all he\r\nknew, but a flying saucer had been found on the beach near Galveston,\r\nTexas. It had USAF markings.\r\n\r\nTwo nights later a Los Angeles television station cut into a regular\r\nprogram with a special news flash; later in the evening the announcer\r\nsaid they would show the first photos of the real thing, our\r\nmilitary's flying saucer. The photos turned out to be of the Navy XF-\r\n5-U, a World War II experimental aircraft that never flew.\r\n\r\nThe public was now thoroughly confused.\r\n\r\nBy now the words \"flying saucer\" were being batted around by every\r\nnewspaper reporter, radio and TV newscaster, comedian, and man on the\r\nstreet. Some of the comments weren't complimentary, but as Theorem I\r\nof the publicity racket goes, \"It doesn't make any difference what's\r\nsaid as long as the name's spelled right.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in April the publication that is highly revered by so many,\r\n_U.S._ _News_ _and_ _World_ _Report_, threw in their lot. The UFO's\r\nbelonged to the Navy. Up popped the old non-flying XF-5-U again.\r\n\r\nEvents drifted back to normal when Edward R. Murrow made UFO's the\r\nsubject of one of his TV documentaries. He took his viewers around\r\nthe U.S., talked to Kenneth Arnold, of original UFO fame, by phone\r\nand got the story of Captain Mantell's death from a reporter \"who was\r\nthere.\" Sandwiched in between accounts of actual UFO sightings were\r\nthe pro and con opinions of top Washington brass, scientists, and the\r\nman on the street.\r\n\r\nEven the staid New York _Times_, which had until now stayed out of\r\nUFO controversy, broke down and ran an editorial entitled, \"Those\r\nFlying Saucers--Are They or Aren't They?\"\r\n\r\nAll of this activity did little to shock the military out of their\r\ndogma. They admitted that the UFO investigation really hadn't been\r\ndiscontinued. \"Any substantial reports of any unusual aerial\r\nphenomena would be processed through normal intelligence channels,\"\r\nthey told the press.\r\n\r\nEver since July 4, 1947, ten days after the first flying saucer\r\nreport, airline pilots had been reporting that they had seen UFO's.\r\nBut the reports weren't frequent--maybe one every few months. In the\r\nspring of 1950 this changed, however, and the airline pilots began to\r\nmake more and more reports--good reports. The reports went to ATIC\r\nbut they didn't receive much attention. In a few instances there was\r\na semblance of an investigation but it was halfhearted. The reports\r\nreached the newspapers too, and here they received a great deal more\r\nattention. The reports were investigated, and the stories checked and\r\nrechecked. When airline crews began to turn in one UFO report after\r\nanother, it was difficult to believe the old \"hoax, hallucination,\r\nand misidentification of known objects\" routine. In April, May, and\r\nJune of 1950 there were over thirty-five good reports from airline\r\ncrews.\r\n\r\nOne of these was a report from a Chicago and Southern crew who were\r\nflying a DC-3 from Memphis to Little Rock, Arkansas, on the night of\r\nMarch 31. It was an exceptionally clear night, no clouds or haze, a\r\nwonderful night to fly. At exactly nine twenty-nine by the cockpit\r\nclock the pilot, a Jack Adams, noticed a white light off to his left.\r\nThe copilot, G. W. Anderson, was looking at the chart but out of the\r\ncorner of his eye he saw the pilot lean forward and look out the\r\nwindow, so he looked out too. He saw the light just as the pilot\r\nsaid, \"What's that?\"\r\n\r\nThe copilot's answer was classic: \"No, not one of those things.\"\r\n\r\nBoth pilots had only recently voiced their opinions regarding the\r\nflying saucers and they weren't complimentary.\r\n\r\nAs they watched the UFO, it passed across the nose of their DC-3 and\r\nthey got a fairly good look at it. Neither the pilot nor the copilot\r\nwas positive of the object's shape because it was \"shadowy\" but they\r\nassumed it was disk-shaped because of the circular arrangement of\r\neight or ten \"portholes,\" each one glowing from a strong bluish-white\r\nlight that seemed to come from the inside of whatever it was that\r\nthey saw. The UFO also had a blinking white light on top, a fact that\r\nled many people to speculate that this UFO was another airliner. But\r\nthis idea was quashed when it was announced that there were no other\r\nairliners in the area. The crew of the DC-3, when questioned on this\r\npossibility, were definite in their answers. If it had been another\r\nairplane, they could have read the number, seen the passengers, and\r\ndarn near reached out and slugged the pilot for getting so close to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAbout a month later, over northern Indiana, TWA treated all the\r\npassengers of one of their DC-3 nights to a view of a UFO that looked\r\nlike a \"big glob of molten metal.\"\r\n\r\nThe official answer for this incident is that the huge orange-red\r\nUFO was nothing more than the light from the many northern Indiana\r\nblast furnaces reflecting a haze layer. Could be, but the pilots say\r\nno.\r\n\r\nThere were similar sightings in North Korea two years later--and\r\nFEAF Bomber Command had caused a shortage of blast furnaces in North\r\nKorea.\r\n\r\nUFO sightings by airline pilots always interested me as much as any\r\ntype of sighting. Pilots in general should be competent observers\r\nsimply because they spend a large part of their lives looking around\r\nthe sky. And pilots do look; one of the first things an aviation\r\ncadet is taught is to \"Keep your head on a swivel\"; in other words,\r\nkeep looking around the sky. Of all the pilots, the airline pilots\r\nare the cream of this group of good observers. Possibly some second\r\nlieutenant just out of flying school could be confused by some\r\nunusual formation of ground lights, a meteor, or a star, but airline\r\npilots have flown thousands of hours or they wouldn't be sitting in\r\nthe left seat of an airliner, and they should be familiar with a host\r\nof unusual sights.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon in February 1953 I had an opportunity to further my\r\nstudy of UFO sightings by airline pilots. I had been out at Air\r\nDefense Command Headquarters in Colorado Springs and was flying back\r\nEast on a United Airlines DC-6. There weren't many passengers on the\r\nairplane that afternoon but, as usual, the captain came strolling\r\nback through the cabin to chat. When he got to me he sat down in the\r\nnext seat. We talked a few minutes; then I asked him what he knew\r\nabout flying saucers. He sort of laughed and said that a dozen people\r\na week asked that question, but when I told him who I was and why I\r\nwas interested, his attitude changed. He said that he'd never seen a\r\nUFO but he knew a lot of pilots on United who had. One man, he told\r\nme, had seen one several years ago. He'd reported it but he had been\r\nsloughed off like the rest. But he was so convinced that he'd seen\r\nsomething unusual that he'd gone out and bought a Leica camera with a\r\n105-mm. telephoto lens, learned how to use it, and now he carried it\r\nreligiously during his flights.\r\n\r\nThere was a lull in the conversation, then the captain said, \"Do you\r\nreally want to get an opinion about flying saucers?\"\r\n\r\nI said I did.\r\n\r\n\"O.K.,\" I remember his saying, \"how much of a layover do you have in\r\nChicago?\"\r\n\r\nI had about two hours.\r\n\r\n\"All right, as soon as we get to Chicago I'll meet you at\r\nCaffarello's, across the street from the terminal building. I'll see\r\nwho else is in and I'll bring them along.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked him and he went back up front.\r\n\r\nI waited around the bar at Caffarello's for an hour. I'd just about\r\ndecided that he wasn't going to make it and that I'd better get back\r\nto catch my flight to Dayton when he and three other pilots came in.\r\nWe got a big booth in the coffee shop because he'd called three more\r\noff-duty pilots who lived in Chicago and they were coming over too. I\r\ndon't remember any of the men's names because I didn't make any\r\nattempt to. This was just an informal bull session and not an\r\nofficial interrogation, but I really got the scoop on what airline\r\npilots think about UFO's.\r\n\r\nFirst of all they didn't pull any punches about what they thought\r\nabout the Air Force and its investigation of UFO reports. One of the\r\nmen got right down to the point: \"If I saw a flying saucer flying\r\nwing-tip formation with me and could see little men waving--even if\r\nmy whole load of passengers saw it--I wouldn't report it to the Air\r\nForce.\"\r\n\r\nAnother man cut in, \"Remember the thing Jack Adams said he saw down\r\nby Memphis?\"\r\n\r\nI said I did.\r\n\r\n\"He reported that to the Air Force and some red-hot character met\r\nhim in Memphis on his next trip. He talked to Adams a few minutes and\r\nthen told him that he'd seen a meteor. Adams felt like a fool. Hell,\r\nI know Jack Adams well and he's the most conservative guy I know. If\r\nhe said he saw something with glowing portholes, he saw something\r\nwith glowing portholes--and it wasn't a meteor.\"\r\n\r\nEven though I didn't remember the pilots' names I'll never forget\r\ntheir comments. They didn't like the way the Air Force had handled\r\nUFO reports and I was the Air Force's \"Mr. Flying Saucer.\" As quickly\r\nas one of the pilots would set me up and bat me down, the next one\r\ngrabbed me off the floor and took his turn. But I couldn't complain\r\ntoo much; I'd asked for it. I think that this group of seven pilots\r\npretty much represented the feelings of a lot of the airline pilots.\r\nThey weren't wide-eyed space fans, but they and their fellow pilots\r\nhad seen something and whatever they'd seen weren't hallucinations,\r\nmass hysteria, balloons, or meteors.\r\n\r\nThree of the men at the Caffarello conference had seen UFO's or, to\r\nuse their terminology, they had seen something they couldn't identify\r\nas a known object. Two of these men had seen odd lights closely\r\nfollowing their airplanes at night. Both had checked and double-\r\nchecked with CAA, but no other aircraft was in the area. Both\r\nadmitted, however, that they hadn't seen enough to class what they'd\r\nseen as good UFO sighting. But the third man had a lulu.\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly, this pilot was flying for TWA. One day in\r\nMarch 1952 he, his copilot, and a third person who was either a pilot\r\ndeadheading home or another crew member, I don't recall which, were\r\nflying a C-54 cargo airplane from Chicago to Kansas City. At about\r\n2:30P.M. the pilot was checking in with the CAA radio at Kirksville,\r\nMissouri, flying 500 feet on top of a solid overcast. While he was\r\ntalking he glanced out at his No. 2 engine, which had been losing\r\noil. Directly in line with it, and a few degrees above, he saw a\r\nsilvery, disk-shaped object. It was too far out to get a really good\r\nlook at it, yet it was close enough to be able definitely to make out\r\nthe shape.\r\n\r\nThe UFO held its relative position with the C-54 for five or six\r\nminutes; then the pilot decided to do a little on-the-spot\r\ninvestigating himself. He started a gradual turn toward the UFO and\r\nfor about thirty seconds he was getting closer, but then the UFO\r\nbegan to make a left turn. It had apparently slowed down because they\r\nwere still closing on it.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the copilot decided that the UFO was a balloon; it\r\njust looked as if the UFO was turning. The pilot agreed halfway--and\r\nsince the company wasn't paying them to intercept balloons, they got\r\nback on their course to Kansas City. They flew on for a few more\r\nminutes with \"the darn thing\" still off to their left. If it was a\r\nballoon, they should be leaving it behind, the pilot recalled\r\nthinking to himself; if they made a 45-degree right turn, the\r\n\"balloon\" shouldn't stay off the left wing; it should drop 'way\r\nbehind. So they made a 45-degree right turn, and although the\r\n\"balloon\" dropped back a little bit, it didn't drop back far enough\r\nto be a balloon. It seemed to put on speed to try to make a turn\r\noutside of the C-54's turn. The pilot continued on around until he'd\r\nmade a tight 360-degree turn, and the UFO had followed, staying\r\noutside. They could not judge its speed, not knowing how far away it\r\nwas, but to follow even a C-54 around in a 360-degree turn and to\r\nstay outside all of the time takes a mighty speedy object.\r\n\r\nThis shot the balloon theory right in the head. After the 360-degree\r\nturn the UFO seemed to be gradually losing altitude because it was\r\ngetting below the level of the wings. The pilot decided to get a\r\nbetter look. He asked for full power on all four engines, climbed\r\nseveral thousand feet, and again turned into the UFO. He put the C-54\r\nin a long glide, headed directly toward it. As they closed in, the\r\nUFO seemed to lose altitude a little faster and \"sank\" into the top\r\nof the overcast. Just as the C-54 flashed across the spot where the\r\nUFO had disappeared, the crew saw it rise up out of the overcast off\r\ntheir right wing and begin to climb so fast that in several seconds\r\nit was out of sight.\r\n\r\nBoth the pilot and copilot wanted to stay around and look for it but\r\nNo. 2 engine had started to act up soon after they had put on full\r\npower for the climb, and they decided that they'd better get into\r\nKansas City.\r\n\r\nI missed my Dayton flight but I heard a good UFO story.\r\n\r\nWhat had the two pilots and their passenger seen? We kicked it\r\naround plenty that afternoon. It was no balloon. It wasn't another\r\nairplane because when the pilot called Kirksville Radio he'd asked if\r\nthere were any airplanes in the area. It might possibly have been a\r\nreflection of some kind except that when it \"sank\" into the overcast\r\nthe pilot said it looked like something sinking into an overcast--it\r\njust didn't disappear as a reflection would. Then there was the\r\nsudden reappearance off the right wing. These are the types of things\r\nyou just can't explain.\r\n\r\nWhat did the pilots think it was? Three were sold that the UFO's\r\nwere interplanetary spacecraft, one man was convinced that they were\r\nsome U.S. \"secret weapon,\" and three of the men just shook their\r\nheads. So did I. We all agreed on one thing--this pilot had seen\r\nsomething and it was something highly unusual.\r\n\r\nThe meeting broke up about 9:00P.M. I'd gotten the personal and very\r\ncandid opinion of seven airline captains, and the opinions of half a\r\nhundred more airline pilots had been quoted. I'd learned that the\r\nUFO's are discussed often. I'd learned that many airline pilots take\r\nUFO sightings very seriously. I learned that some believe they are\r\ninterplanetary, some think they're a U.S. weapon, and many just don't\r\nknow. But very few are laughing off the good sightings.\r\n\r\nBy May 1950 the flying saucer business had hit a new all-time peak.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force didn't take any side, they just shrugged. There was no\r\nattempt to investigate and explain the various sightings. Maybe this\r\nwas because someone was afraid the answer would be \"Unknown.\" Or\r\nmaybe it was because a few key officers thought that the eagles or\r\nstars on their shoulders made them leaders of all men. If they didn't\r\nbelieve in flying saucers and said so, it would be like calming the\r\nstormy Sea of Galilee. \"It's all a bunch of damned nonsense,\" an Air\r\nForce colonel who was controlling the UFO investigation said.\r\n\"There's no such thing as a flying saucer.\" He went on to say that\r\nall people who saw flying saucers were jokers, crackpots, or\r\npublicity hounds. Then he gave the airline pilots who'd been\r\nreporting UFO's a reprieve. \"They were just fatigued,\" he said. \"What\r\nthey thought were spaceships were windshield reflections.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the unbiased processing of UFO reports through normal\r\nintelligence channels.\r\n\r\nBut the U.S. public evidently had more faith in the \"crackpot\"\r\nscientists who were spending millions of the public's dollars at the\r\nWhite Sands Proving Grounds, in the \"publicity-mad\" military pilots,\r\nand the \"tired, old\" airline pilots, because in a nationwide poll it\r\nwas found that only 6 per cent of the country's 150,697,361 people\r\nagreed with the colonel and said, \"There aren't such things.\"\r\n\r\nNinety-four per cent had different ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon Rumbles\r\n\r\nOn June 25, 1950, the North Korean armies swept down across the 38th\r\nparallel and the Korean War was on--the UFO was no longer a news\r\nitem. But the lady, or gentleman, who first said, \"Out of sight is\r\nout of mind,\" had never reckoned with the UFO.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 1950, the UFO's were back in the news. On that day\r\nit was revealed, via a book entitled _Behind_ _the_ _Flying_\r\n_Saucers_, that government scientists had recovered and analyzed\r\nthree different models of flying saucers. And they were fantastic--\r\njust like the book. They were made of an unknown super-duper metal\r\nand they were manned by little blue uniformed men who ate\r\nconcentrated food and drank heavy water. The author of the book,\r\nFrank Scully, had gotten the story directly from a millionaire\r\noilman, Silas Newton. Newton had in turn heard the story from an\r\nemployee of his, a mysterious \"Dr. Gee,\" one of the government\r\nscientists who had helped analyze the crashed saucers.\r\n\r\nThe story made news, Newton and \"Dr. Gee\" made fame, and Scully made\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nA little over two years later Newton and the man who was reportedly\r\nthe mysterious \"Dr. Gee\" again made the news. The Denver district\r\nattorney's office had looked into the pair's oil business and found\r\nthat the pockets they were trying to tap didn't contain oil.\r\nAccording to the December 6, 1952, issue of the _Saturday_ _Review_,\r\nthe D.A. had charged the two men with a $50,000 con game. One of\r\ntheir $800,000 electronic devices for their oil explorations turned\r\nout to be a $4.00 piece of war surplus junk.\r\n\r\nAnother book came out in the fall of 1950 when Donald Keyhoe\r\nexpanded his original UFO story that had first appeared in the\r\nJanuary 1950 issue of _True_ magazine. Next to Scully's book Keyhoe's\r\nbook was tame, but it convinced more people. Keyhoe had based his\r\nconjecture on fact, and his facts were correct, even if the\r\nconjecture wasn't.\r\n\r\nNeither the seesaw advances and retreats of the United Nations\r\ntroops in Korea nor the two flying saucer books seemed to have any\r\neffect on the number of UFO reports logged into ATIC, however. By\r\nofficial count, seventy-seven came in the first half of 1950 and\r\nseventy-five during the latter half. The actual count could have been\r\nmore because in 1950, UFO reports were about as popular as sand in\r\nspinach, and I would guess that at least a few wound up in the\r\n\"circular file.\"\r\n\r\nIn early January 1951 I was recalled to active duty and assigned to\r\nAir Technical Intelligence Center as an intelligence officer. I had\r\nbeen at ATIC only eight and a half hours when I first heard the words\r\n\"flying saucer\" officially used. I had never paid a great deal of\r\nattention to flying saucer reports but I had read a few--especially\r\nthose that had been made by pilots. I'd managed to collect some 2,000\r\nhours of flying time and had seen many odd things in the air, but I'd\r\nalways been able to figure out what they were in a few seconds. I was\r\nconvinced that if a pilot, or any crew member of an airplane, said\r\nthat he'd seen something that he couldn't identify he meant it--it\r\nwasn't a hallucination. But I wasn't convinced that flying saucers\r\nwere spaceships.\r\n\r\nMy interest in UFO's picked up in a hurry when I learned that ATIC\r\nwas the government agency that was responsible for the UFO project.\r\nAnd I was really impressed when I found out that the person who sat\r\nthree desks down and one over from mine was in charge of the whole\r\nUFO show. So when I came to work on my second morning at ATIC and\r\nheard the words \"flying saucer report\" being talked about and saw a\r\ngroup of people standing around the chief of the UFO project's desk I\r\nabout sprung an eardrum listening to what they had to say. It seemed\r\nto be a big deal--except that most of them were laughing. It must be\r\na report of hoax or hallucination, I remember thinking to myself, but\r\nI listened as one of the group told the others about the report.\r\n\r\nThe night before a Mid-Continent Airlines DC-3 was taxiing out to\r\ntake off from the airport at Sioux City, Iowa, when the airport\r\ncontrol tower operators noticed a bright bluish-white light in the\r\nwest. The tower operators, thinking that it was another airplane,\r\ncalled the pilot of the DC-3 and told him to be careful since there\r\nwas another airplane approaching the field. As the DC-3 lined up to\r\ntake off, both the pilots of the airliner and the tower operators saw\r\nthe light moving in, but since it was still some distance away the DC-\r\n3 was given permission to take off. As it rolled down the runway\r\ngetting up speed, both the pilot and the copilot were busy, so they\r\ndidn't see the light approaching. But the tower operators did, and as\r\nsoon as the DC-3 was airborne, they called and told the pilot to be\r\ncareful. The copilot said that he saw the light and was watching it.\r\nJust then the tower got a call from another airplane that was\r\nrequesting landing instructions and the operators looked away from\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nIn the DC-3 the pilot and copilot had also looked away from the\r\nlight for a few seconds. When they looked back, the bluish-white\r\nlight had apparently closed in because it was much brighter and it\r\nwas dead ahead. In a split second it closed in and flashed by their\r\nright wing--so close that both pilots thought that they would collide\r\nwith it. When it passed the DC-3, the pilots saw more than a light--\r\nthey saw a huge object that looked like the \"fuselage of a B-29.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the copilot had recovered he looked out his side window to see\r\nif he could see the UFO and there it was, flying formation with them.\r\nHe yelled at the pilot, who leaned over and looked just in time to\r\nsee the UFO disappear.\r\n\r\nThe second look confirmed the Mid-Continent crew's first impression--\r\nthe object looked like a B-29 without wings. They saw nothing more,\r\nonly a big \"shadowy shape\" and the bluish-white light--no windows, no\r\nexhaust.\r\n\r\nThe tower had missed the incident because they were landing the\r\nother airplane and the pilot and the copilot didn't have time to call\r\nthem and tell them about what was going on. All the tower operators\r\ncould say was that seconds after the UFO had disappeared the light\r\nthat they had seen was gone.\r\n\r\nWhen the airliner landed in Omaha, the crew filed a report that was\r\nforwarded to the Air Force. But this wasn't the only report that was\r\nfiled; a full colonel from military intelligence had been a passenger\r\non the DC-3. He'd seen the UFO too, and he was mighty impressed.\r\n\r\nI thought that this was an interesting report and I wondered what\r\nthe official reaction would be. The official reaction was a great\r\nbig, deep belly laugh.\r\n\r\nThis puzzled me because I'd read that the Air Force was seriously\r\ninvestigating all UFO reports.\r\n\r\nI continued to eavesdrop on the discussions about the report all day\r\nsince the UFO expert was about to \"investigate\" the incident. He sent\r\nout a wire to Flight Service and found that there was a B-36\r\nsomewhere in the area of Sioux City at the time of the sighting, and\r\nfrom what I could gather he was trying to blame the sighting on the B-\r\n36. When Washington called to get the results of the analysis of the\r\nsighting, they must have gotten the B-36 treatment because the case\r\nwas closed.\r\n\r\nI'd only been at ATIC two days and I certainly didn't class myself\r\nas an intelligence expert, but it didn't take an expert to see that a\r\nB-36, even one piloted by an experienced idiot, could not do what the\r\nUFO had done--buzz a DC-3 that was in an airport traffic pattern.\r\n\r\nI didn't know it at the time but a similar event had occurred the\r\nyear before. On the night of May 29, 1950, the crew of an American\r\nAirlines DC-6 had just taken off from Washington National Airport,\r\nand they were about seven miles west of Mount Vernon when the copilot\r\nsuddenly looked out and yelled, \"Watch it--watch it.\" The pilot and\r\nthe engineer looked out to see a bluish-white light closing in on\r\nthem from dead ahead. The pilot racked the DC-6 up in a tight right\r\nturn while the UFO passed by on the left \"from eleven to seven\r\no'clock\" and a little higher than the airliner. During this time the\r\nUFO passed between the full moon and DC-6 and the crew could see the\r\ndark silhouette of a \"wingless B-29.\" Its length was about half the\r\ndiameter of the full moon, and it had a blue flame shooting out the\r\ntail end.\r\n\r\nSeconds after the UFO had passed by the DC-6, the copilot looked out\r\nand there it was again, apparently flying formation off their right\r\nwing. Then in a flash of blue flame it was gone--streaking out ahead\r\nof the airliner and making a left turn toward the coast.\r\n\r\nThe pilot of the DC-6, who made the report, had better than 15,000\r\nhours' flying time.\r\n\r\nI didn't hear anything about UFO's, or flying saucers, as they were\r\nthen known, for several weeks but I kept them in mind and one day I\r\nasked one of the old hands at ATIC about them--specifically I wanted\r\nto know about the Sioux City Incident. Why had it been sloughed off\r\nso lightly? His answer was typical of the official policy at that\r\ntime. \"One of these days all of these crazy pilots will kill\r\nthemselves, the crazy people on the ground will be locked up, and\r\nthere won't be any more flying saucer reports.\"\r\n\r\nBut after I knew the people at ATIC a little better, I found that\r\nbeing anti-saucer wasn't a unanimous feeling. Some of the\r\nintelligence officers took the UFO reports seriously. One man, who\r\nhad been on Project Sign since it was organized back in 1947, was\r\nconvinced that the UFO's were interplanetary spaceships. He had\r\nquestioned the people in the control tower at Godman AFB when Captain\r\nMantell was killed chasing the UFO, and he had spent hours talking to\r\nthe crew of the DC-3 that was buzzed near Montgomery, Alabama, by a\r\n\"cigar-shaped UFO that spouted blue flame.\" In essence, he knew UFO\r\nhistory from _A_ _to_ _Z_ because he had \"been there.\"\r\n\r\nI think that it was this controversial thinking that first aroused\r\nmy interest in the subject of UFO's and led me to try to sound out a\r\nfew more people.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that stood out to me, being unindoctrinated in the\r\nways of UFO lore, was the schizophrenic approach so many people at\r\nATIC took. On the surface they sided with the belly-laughers on any\r\nsaucer issue, but if you were alone with them and started to ridicule\r\nthe subject, they defended it or at least took an active interest. I\r\nlearned this one day after I'd been at ATIC about a month.\r\n\r\nA belated UFO report had come in from Africa. One of my friends was\r\nreading it, so I asked him if I could take a look at it when he had\r\nfinished. In a few minutes he handed it to me.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished with the report I tossed it back on my friend's\r\ndesk, with some comment about the whole world's being nuts. I got a\r\nreaction I didn't expect; he wasn't so sure the whole world was nuts--\r\nmaybe the nuts were at ATIC. \"What's the deal?\" I asked him. \"Have\r\nthey really thoroughly checked out every report and found that\r\nthere's nothing to any of them?\"\r\n\r\nHe told me that he didn't think so, he'd been at ATIC a long time.\r\nHe hadn't ever worked on the UFO project, but he had seen many of\r\ntheir reports and knew what they were doing. He just plain didn't buy\r\na lot of their explanations. \"And I'm not the only one who thinks\r\nthis,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"Then why all of the big show of power against the UFO reports?\" I\r\nremember asking him.\r\n\r\n\"The powers-that-be are anti-flying saucer,\" he answered about half\r\nbitterly, \"and to stay in favor it behooves one to follow suit.\"\r\n\r\nAs of February 1951 this was the UFO project.\r\n\r\nThe words \"flying saucer\" didn't come up again for a month or two.\r\nI'd forgotten all about the two words and was deeply engrossed in\r\nmaking an analysis of the performance of the Mig-15. The Mig had just\r\nbegun to show up in Korea, and finding out more about it was a hot\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nThen the words \"flying saucer\" drifted across the room once more.\r\nBut this time instead of belly laughter there was a note of hysteria.\r\n\r\nIt seems that a writer from _Life_ magazine was doing some research\r\non UFO's and rumor had it that _Life_ was thinking about doing a\r\nfeature article. The writer had gone to the Office of Public\r\nInformation in the Pentagon and had inquired about the current status\r\nof Project Grudge. To accommodate the writer, the OPI had sent a wire\r\nout to ATIC: What is the status of Project Grudge?\r\n\r\nBack went a snappy reply: Everything is under control; each new\r\nreport is being thoroughly analyzed by our experts; our vast files of\r\nreports are in tiptop shape; and in general things are hunky-dunky.\r\nAll UFO reports are hoaxes, hallucinations, and the misidentification\r\nof known objects.\r\n\r\nAnother wire from Washington: Fine, Mr. Bob Ginna of _Life_ is\r\nleaving for Dayton. He wants to check some reports.\r\n\r\nBedlam in the raw.\r\n\r\nOther magazines had printed UFO stories, and other reporters had\r\nvisited ATIC, but they had always stayed in the offices of the top\r\nbrass. For some reason the name _Life_, the prospects of a feature\r\nstory, and the feeling that this Bob Ginna was going to ask questions\r\ncaused sweat to flow at ATIC.\r\n\r\nGinna arrived and the ATIC UFO \"expert\" talked to him. Ginna later\r\ntold me about the meeting. He had a long list of questions about\r\nreports that had been made over the past four years and every time he\r\nasked a question, the \"expert\" would go tearing out of the room to\r\ntry to find the file that had the answer. I remember that day people\r\nspent a lot of time ripping open bundles of files and pawing through\r\nthem like a bunch of gophers. Many times, \"I'm sorry, that's\r\nclassified,\" got ATIC out of a tight spot.\r\n\r\nGinna, I can assure you, was not at all impressed by the\r\n\"efficiently operating UFO project.\" People weren't buying the hoax,\r\nhallucination, and misidentification stories quite as readily as the\r\nAir Force believed.\r\n\r\nWhere it started or who started it I don't know, but about two\r\nmonths after the visit from _Life's_ representative the official\r\ninterest in UFO's began to pick up. Lieutenant Jerry Cummings, who\r\nhad recently been recalled to active duty, took over the project.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Cummings is the type of person who when given a job to do\r\ndoes it. In a few weeks the operation of the UFO project had improved\r\nconsiderably. But the project was still operating under political,\r\neconomic, and manpower difficulties. Cummings' desk was right across\r\nfrom mine, so I began to get a UFO indoctrination via bull sessions.\r\nWhenever Jerry found a good report in the pile--and all he had to\r\nstart with was a pile of papers and files--he'd toss it over for me\r\nto read.\r\n\r\nSome of the reports were unimpressive, I remember. But a few were\r\njust the opposite. Two that I remember Jerry's showing me made me\r\nwonder how the UFO's could be sloughed off so lightly. The two\r\nreports involved movies taken by Air Force technicians at White Sands\r\nProving Ground in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe guided missile test range at White Sands is fully instrumented\r\nto track high, fast-moving objects--the guided missiles. Located over\r\nan area of many square miles there are camera stations equipped with\r\ncinetheodolite cameras and linked together by a telephone system.\r\n\r\nOn April 27, 1950, a guided missile had been fired, and as it roared\r\nup into the stratosphere and fell back to earth, the camera crews had\r\nrecorded its flight. All the crews had started to unload their\r\ncameras when one of them spotted an object streaking across the sky.\r\nBy April 1950 every person at White Sands was UFO-conscious, so one\r\nmember of the camera crew grabbed a telephone headset, alerted the\r\nother crews, and told them to get pictures. Unfortunately only one\r\ncamera had film in it, the rest had already been unloaded, and before\r\nthey could reload, the UFO was gone. The photos from the one station\r\nshowed only a smudgy dark object. About all the film proved was that\r\nsomething was in the air and whatever it was, it was moving.\r\n\r\nAlerted by this first chance to get a UFO to \"run a measured\r\ncourse,\" the camera crews agreed to keep a sharper lookout. They also\r\ngot the official O.K. to \"shoot\" a UFO if one appeared.\r\n\r\nAlmost exactly a month later another UFO did appear, or at least at\r\nthe time the camera crews thought that it was _a_ UFO. This time the\r\ncrews were ready--when the call went out over the telephone net that\r\na UFO had been spotted, all of the crews scanned the sky. Two of the\r\ncrews saw it and shot several feet of film as the shiny, bright\r\nobject streaked across the sky.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the missile tests were completed, the camera crews rushed\r\ntheir film to the processing lab and then took it to the Data\r\nReduction Group. But once again the UFO had eluded man because there\r\nwere apparently two or more UFO's in the sky and each camera station\r\nhad photographed a separate one. The data were no good for\r\ntriangulation.\r\n\r\nThe records at ATIC didn't contain the analysis of these films but\r\nthey did mention the Data Reduction Group at White Sands. So when I\r\nlater took over the UFO investigation I made several calls in an\r\neffort to run down the actual film and the analysis. The files at\r\nWhite Sands, like all files, evidently weren't very good, because the\r\noriginal reports were gone. I did contact a major who was very co-\r\noperative and offered to try to find the people who had worked on the\r\nanalysis of the film. His report, after talking to two men who had\r\ndone the analysis, was what I'd expected--nothing concrete except\r\nthat the UFO's were unknowns. He did say that by putting a correction\r\nfactor in the data gathered by the two cameras they were able to\r\narrive at a rough estimate of speed, altitude, and size. The UFO was\r\n\"higher than 40,000 feet, traveling over 2,000 miles per hour, and it\r\nwas over 300 feet in diameter.\" He cautioned me, however, that these\r\nfigures were only estimates, based on the possibly erroneous\r\ncorrection factor; therefore they weren't proof of anything--except\r\nthat something was in the air.\r\n\r\nThe people at White Sands continued to be on the alert for UFO's\r\nwhile the camera stations were in operation because they realized\r\nthat if the flight path of a UFO could be accurately plotted and\r\ntimed it could be positively identified. But no more UFO's showed up.\r\n\r\nOne day Lieutenant Cummings came over to my desk and dropped a stack\r\nof reports in front of me. \"All radar reports,\" he said, \"and I'm\r\ngetting more and more of them every day.\"\r\n\r\nRadar reports, I knew, had always been a controversial point in UFO\r\nhistory, and if more and more radar reports were coming in, there was\r\nno doubt that an already controversial issue was going to be\r\ncompounded.\r\n\r\nTo understand why there is always some disagreement whenever a\r\nflying saucer is picked up on radar, it is necessary to know a little\r\nbit about how radar operates.\r\n\r\nBasically radar is nothing but a piece of electronic equipment that\r\n\"shouts\" out a radio wave and \"listens\" for the echo. By \"knowing\"\r\nhow fast the radio, or radar, wave travels and from which direction\r\nthe echo is coming, the radar tells the direction and distance of the\r\nobject that is causing the echo. Any \"solid\" object like an airplane,\r\nbird, ship, or even a moisture-laden cloud can cause a radar echo.\r\nWhen the echo comes back to the radar set, the radar operator doesn't\r\nhave to listen for it and time it because this is all done for him by\r\nthe radar set and he sees the \"answer\" on his radarscope--a kind of a\r\nround TV screen. What the radar operator sees is a bright dot, called\r\na \"blip\" or a \"return.\" The location of the return on the scope tells\r\nhim the location of the object that was causing the echo. As the\r\nobject moves through the sky, the radar operator sees a series of\r\nbright dots on his scope that make a track. On some radar sets the\r\naltitude of the target, the object causing the echo, can also be\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions the path that the radar waves take as they\r\ntravel through the air is known. Normal conditions are when the\r\ntemperature and relative humidity of the air decrease with an\r\nincrease in altitude. But sometimes a condition will occur where at\r\nsome level, instead of the temperature and/or relative humidity\r\ndecreasing with altitude, it will begin to increase. This layer of\r\nwarm, moist air is known as an inversion layer, and it can do all\r\nkinds of crazy things to a radar wave. It can cause part of the radar\r\nwave to travel in a big arc and actually pick up the ground many\r\nmiles away. Or it can cause the wave to bend down just enough to pick\r\nup trucks, cars, houses, or anything that has a surface perpendicular\r\nto the ground level.\r\n\r\nOne would immediately think that since the ground or a house isn't\r\nmoving, and a car or truck is moving only 40, 50, or 60 miles an\r\nhour, a radar operator should be able to pick these objects out from\r\na fast-moving target. But it isn't as simple as that. The inversion\r\nlayer shimmers and moves, and one second the radar may be picking up\r\nthe ground or a truck in one spot and the next second it may be\r\npicking up something in a different spot. This causes a series of\r\nreturns on the scope and can give the illusion of extremely fast or\r\nslow speeds.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the effects of an inversion layer on radar.\r\nSome of the effects are well known, but others aren't. The 3rd\r\nWeather Group at Air Defense Command Headquarters in Colorado Springs\r\nhas done a lot of work on the effects of weather on radar, and they\r\nhave developed mathematical formulas for telling how favorable\r\nweather conditions are for \"anomalous propagation,\" the two-bit words\r\nfor false radar targets caused by weather.\r\n\r\nThe first problem in analyzing reports of UFO's being picked up on\r\nradar is to determine if the weather conditions are right to give\r\nanomalous propagation. This can be determined by putting weather data\r\ninto a formula. If they are, then it is necessary to determine\r\nwhether the radar targets were real or caused by the weather. This is\r\nthe difficult job. In most cases the only answer is the appearance of\r\nthe target on the radar-scope. Many times a weather target will be a\r\nfuzzy and indistinct spot on the scope while a real target, an\r\nairplane for example, will be bright and sharp. This question of\r\nwhether a target looked real is the cause of the majority of the\r\narguments about radar-detected UFO's because it is up to the judgment\r\nof the radar operator as to what the target looked like. And whenever\r\nhuman judgment is involved in a decision, there is plenty of room for\r\nan argument.\r\n\r\nAll during the early summer of 1951 Lieutenant Cummings \"fought the\r\nsyndicate\" trying to make the UFO respectable. All the time I was\r\ncontinuing to get my indoctrination. Then one day with the speed of a\r\nshotgun wedding, the long-overdue respectability arrived. The date\r\nwas September 12, 1951, and the exact time was 3:04P.M.\r\n\r\nOn this date and time a teletype machine at Wright-Patterson AFB\r\nbegan to chatter out a message. Thirty-six inches of paper rolled out\r\nof the machine before the operator ripped off the copy, stamped it\r\nOperational Immediate, and gave it to a special messenger to deliver\r\nto ATIC. Lieutenant Cummings got the message. The report was from the\r\nArmy Signal Corps radar center at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and it\r\nwas red-hot.\r\n\r\nThe incident had started two days before, on September 10, at\r\n11:10A.M., when a student operator was giving a demonstration to a\r\ngroup of visiting brass at the radar school. He demonstrated the set\r\nunder manual operation for a while, picking up local air traffic,\r\nthen he announced that he would demonstrate automatic tracking, in\r\nwhich the set is put on a target and follows it without help from the\r\noperator. The set could track objects flying at jet speeds.\r\n\r\nThe operator spotted an object about 12,000 yards southeast of the\r\nstation, flying low toward the north. He tried to switch the set to\r\nautomatic tracking. He failed, tried again, failed again. He turned\r\nto his audience of VIPs, embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"It's going too fast for the set,\" he said. \"That means it's going\r\nfaster than a jet!\"\r\n\r\nA lot of very important eyebrows lifted. What flies faster than a jet?\r\n\r\nThe object was in range for three minutes and the operator kept\r\ntrying, without success, to get into automatic track. The target\r\nfinally went off the scope, leaving the red-faced operator talking to\r\nhimself. The radar technicians at Fort Monmouth had checked the\r\nweather--there wasn't the slightest indication of an inversion layer.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five minutes later the pilot of a T-33 jet trainer, carrying\r\nan Air Force major as passenger and flying 20,000 feet over Point\r\nPleasant, New Jersey, spotted a dull silver, disklike object far\r\nbelow him. He described it as 30 to 50 feet in diameter and as\r\ndescending toward Sandy Hook from an altitude of a mile or so. He\r\nbanked the T-33 over and started down after it. As he shot down, he\r\nreported, the object stopped its descent, hovered, then sped south,\r\nmade a 120-degree turn, and vanished out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe Fort Monmouth Incident then switched back to the radar group. At\r\n3:15P.M. they got an excited, almost frantic call from headquarters\r\nto pick up a target high and to the north--which was where the first\r\n\"faster-than-a-jet\" object had vanished--and to pick it up in a\r\nhurry. They got a fix on it and reported that it was traveling slowly\r\nat 93,000 feet. They also could see it visually as a silver speck.\r\n\r\nWhat flies 18 miles above the earth?\r\n\r\nThe next morning two radar sets picked up another target that\r\ncouldn't be tracked automatically. It would climb, level off, climb\r\nagain, go into a dive. When it climbed it went almost straight up.\r\n\r\nThe two-day sensation ended that afternoon when the radar tracked\r\nanother unidentified slow-moving object and tracked it for several\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nA copy of the message had also gone to Washington. Before Jerry\r\ncould digest the thirty-six inches of facts, ATIC's new chief,\r\nColonel Frank Dunn, got a phone call. It came from the office of the\r\nDirector of Intelligence of the Air Force, Major General (now\r\nLieutenant General) C. P. Cabell. General Cabell wanted somebody from\r\nATIC to get to New Jersey--fast--and find out what was going on. As\r\nsoon as the reports had been thoroughly investigated, the general\r\nsaid that he wanted a complete personal report. Nothing expedites\r\nlike a telephone call from a general officer, so in a matter of hours\r\nLieutenant Cummings and Lieutenant Colonel N. R. Rosengarten were on\r\nan airliner, New Jersey-bound.\r\n\r\nThe two officers worked around the clock interrogating the radar\r\noperators, their instructors, and the technicians at Fort Monmouth.\r\nThe pilot who had chased the UFO in the T-33 trainer and his\r\npassenger were flown to New York, and they talked to Cummings and\r\nRosengarten. All other radar stations in the area were checked, but\r\ntheir radars hadn't picked up anything unusual.\r\n\r\nAt about 4:00A.M. the second morning after they had arrived, the\r\ninvestigation was completed, Cummings later told. He and Lieutenant\r\nColonel Rosengarten couldn't get an airliner out of New York in time\r\nto get them to the Pentagon by 10:00A.M., the time that had been set\r\nup for their report, so they chartered an airplane and flew to the\r\ncapital to brief the general.\r\n\r\nGeneral Cabell presided over the meeting, and it was attended by his\r\nentire staff plus Lieutenant Cummings, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nRosengarten, and a special representative from Republic Aircraft\r\nCorporation. The man from Republic supposedly represented a group of\r\ntop U.S. industrialists and scientists who thought that there should\r\nbe a lot more sensible answers coming from the Air Force regarding\r\nthe UFO's. The man was at the meeting at the personal request of a\r\ngeneral officer.\r\n\r\nEvery word of the two-hour meeting was recorded on a wire recorder.\r\nThe recording was so hot that it was later destroyed, but not before\r\nI had heard it several times. I can't tell everything that was said\r\nbut, to be conservative, it didn't exactly follow the tone of the\r\nofficial Air Force releases--many of the people present at the\r\nmeeting weren't as convinced that the \"hoax, hallucination, and\r\nmisidentification\" answer was\r\n\r\nThe first thing the general wanted to know was, \"Who in hell has\r\nbeen giving me these reports that every decent flying saucer sighting\r\nis being investigated?\"\r\n\r\nThen others picked up the questioning.\r\n\r\n\"What happened to those two reports that General ------ sent in from\r\nSaudi Arabia? He saw those two flying saucers himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who released this big report, anyway?\" another person added,\r\npicking up a copy of the Grudge Report and slamming it back down on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Cummings and Lieutenant Colonel Rosengarten came back to\r\nATIC with orders to set up a new project and report back to General\r\nCabell when it was ready to go. But Cummings didn't get a chance to\r\ndo much work on the new revitalized Project Grudge--it was to keep\r\nthe old name--because in a few days he was a civilian. He'd been\r\nreleased from active duty because he was needed back at Cal Tech,\r\nwhere he'd been working on an important government project before his\r\nrecall to active duty.\r\n\r\nThe day after Cummings got his separation orders, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nRosengarten called me into his office. The colonel was chief of the\r\nAircraft and Missiles branch and one of his many responsibilities was\r\nProject Grudge. He said that he knew that I was busy as group leader\r\nof my regular group but, if he gave me enough people, could I take\r\nProject Grudge? All he wanted me to do was to get it straightened out\r\nand operating; then I could go back to trying to outguess the\r\nRussians. He threw in a few comments about the good job I'd done\r\nstraightening out other fouled-up projects. Good old \"Rosy.\" With my\r\nego sufficiently inflated, I said yes.\r\n\r\nOn many later occasions, when I'd land at home in Dayton just long\r\nenough for a clean clothes resupply, or when the telephone would ring\r\nat 2:00A.M. to report a new \"hot\" sighting and wake up the baby, Mrs.\r\nRuppelt and I have soundly cussed my ego.\r\n\r\nI had had the project only a few days when a minor flurry of good\r\nUFO reports started. It wasn't supposed to happen because the day\r\nafter I'd taken over Project Grudge I'd met the ex-UFO \"expert\" in\r\nthe hall and he'd nearly doubled up with laughter as he said\r\nsomething about getting stuck with Project Grudge. He predicted that\r\nI wouldn't get a report until the newspapers began to play up flying\r\nsaucers again. \"It's all mass hysteria,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe first hysterical report of the flurry came from the Air Defense\r\nCommand. On September 23, 1951, at seven fifty-five in the morning,\r\ntwo F-86's on an early patrol were approaching Long Beach,\r\nCalifornia, coming in on the west leg of the Long Beach Radio range.\r\nAll of a sudden the flight leader called his ground controller--high\r\nat twelve o'clock he and his wing man saw an object. It was in a\r\ngradual turn to its left, and it wasn't another airplane. The ground\r\ncontroller checked his radars but they had nothing, so the ground\r\ncontroller called the leader of the F-86's back and told him to go\r\nafter the object and try to identify it. The two airplanes started to\r\nclimb.\r\n\r\nBy this time the UFO had crossed over them but it was still in a\r\nturn and was coming back. Several times they tried to intercept, but\r\nthey could never climb up to it. Once in a while, when they'd appear\r\nto be getting close, the UFO would lazily move out of range by\r\nclimbing slightly. All the time it kept orbiting to the left in a\r\nbig, wide circle. After about ten minutes the flight leader told the\r\nground controller, who had been getting a running account of the\r\nunsuccessful intercept, that their fuel was low and that they'd have\r\nto break off soon. They'd gotten a fairly good look at the UFO, the\r\nflight leader told the ground controller, and it appeared to be a\r\nsilver airplane with highly swept-back wings. The controller\r\nacknowledged the message and said that he was scrambling all his\r\nalert airplanes from George AFB. Could the two F-86's stay in the\r\narea a few more minutes? They stayed and in a few minutes four more F-\r\n86's arrived. They saw the UFO immediately and took over.\r\n\r\nThe two F-86's with nearly dry tanks went back to George AFB.\r\n\r\nFor thirty more minutes the newly arrived F-86's worked in pairs\r\ntrying to get up to the UFO's altitude, which they estimated to be\r\n55,000 feet, but they couldn't make it. All the time the UFO kept\r\nslowly circling and speeding up only when the F-86's seemed to get\r\ntoo close. Then they began to run out of fuel and asked for\r\npermission to break off the intercept.\r\n\r\nBy this time one remaining F-86 had been alerted and was airborne\r\ntoward Long Beach. He passed the four homeward-bound F-86's as he was\r\ngoing in, but by the time he arrived over Long Beach the UFO was gone.\r\n\r\nAll the pilots except one reported a \"silver airplane with highly\r\nswept-back wings.\" One pilot said the UFO looked round and silver to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe report ended with a comment by the local intelligence officer.\r\nHe'd called Edwards AFB, the big Air Force test base north of Los\r\nAngeles, but they had nothing in the air. The officer concluded that\r\nthe UFO was no airplane. In 1951 nothing we had would fly higher than\r\nthe F-86.\r\n\r\nThis was a good report and I decided to dig in. First I had some\r\nmore questions I wanted to ask the pilots. I was just in the process\r\nof formulating this set of questions when three better reports came\r\nin. They automatically got a higher priority than the Long Beach\r\nIncident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT\r\n\r\nThe Lubbock Lights, Unabridged\r\n\r\nWhen four college professors, a geologist, a chemist, a physicist,\r\nand a petroleum engineer, report seeing the same UFO's on fourteen\r\ndifferent occasions, the event can be classified as, at least,\r\nunusual. Add the facts that hundreds of other people saw these UFO's\r\nand that they were photographed, and the story gets even better. Add\r\na few more facts--that these UFO's were picked up on radar and that a\r\nfew people got a close look at one of them, and the story begins to\r\nconvince even the most ardent skeptics.\r\n\r\nThis was the situation the day the reports of the Lubbock Lights\r\narrived at ATIC. Actually the Lubbock Lights, as Project Blue Book\r\ncalls them, involved many widespread reports. Some of these incidents\r\nare known to the public, but the ones that added the emphasis and\r\nintrigue to the case and caused hundreds of hours of time to be spent\r\nanalyzing the reports have not been told before. We collected all of\r\nthese reports under the one title because there appeared to be a tie-\r\nin between them.\r\n\r\nThe first word of the sightings reached ATIC late in September 1951,\r\nwhen the mail girl dropped letters into my \"in\" basket. One of the\r\nletters was from Albuquerque, New Mexico, one was from a small town\r\nin Washington State, where I knew an Air Defense Command radar\r\nstation was located, and the other from Reese AFB at Lubbock, Texas.\r\n\r\nI opened the Albuquerque letter first. It was a report from 34th Air\r\nDefense at Kirtland AFB. The report said that on the evening of\r\nAugust 25, 1951, an employee of the Atomic Energy Commission's\r\nsupersecret Sandia Corporation and his wife had seen a UFO. About\r\ndusk they were sitting in the back yard of their home on the\r\noutskirts of Albuquerque. They were gazing at the night sky,\r\ncommenting on how beautiful it was, when both of them were startled\r\nat the sight of a huge airplane flying swiftly and silently over\r\ntheir home. The airplane had been in sight only a few seconds but\r\nthey had gotten a good look at it because it was so low. They\r\nestimated 800 to 1,000 feet. It was the shape of a \"flying wing\" and\r\none and a half times the size of a B-36. The wing was sharply swept\r\nback, almost like a V. Both the husband and wife had seen B-36's over\r\ntheir home many times. They couldn't see the color of the UFO but\r\nthey did notice that there were dark bands running across the wing\r\nfrom front to back. On the aft edge of the wings there were six to\r\neight pairs of soft, glowing, bluish lights. The aircraft had passed\r\nover their house from north to south.\r\n\r\nThe report went on to say that an investigation had been made\r\nimmediately. Since the object might have been a conventional\r\nairplane, air traffic was checked. A commercial airlines\r\nConstellation was 50 miles west of Albuquerque and an Air Force B-25\r\nwas south of the city, but there had been nothing over Albuquerque\r\nthat evening. The man's background was checked. He had a \"Q\" security\r\nclearance. This summed up his character, oddballs don't get \"Q\"\r\nclearances. No one else had reported the UFO, but this could be\r\nexplained by the fact the AEC employee and his wife lived in such a\r\nlocation that anything passing over their home from north to south\r\nwouldn't pass over or near very many other houses. A sketch of the\r\nUFO was enclosed in the report.\r\n\r\nI picked up the letter from Lubbock next. It was a thick report, and\r\nfrom the photographs that were attached, it looked interesting. I\r\nthumbed through it and stopped at the photos. The first thing that\r\nstruck me was the similarity between these photos and the report I'd\r\njust read. They showed a series of lights in a V shape, very similar\r\nto those described as being on the aft edge of the \"flying wing\" that\r\nwas reported from Albuquerque. This was something unique, so I read\r\nthe report in detail.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 25, 1951, about 9:20P.M., just twenty minutes\r\nafter the Albuquerque sighting, four college professors from Texas\r\nTechnological College at Lubbock had observed a formation of soft,\r\nglowing, bluish-green lights pass over their home. Several hours\r\nlater they saw a similar group of lights and in the next two weeks\r\nthey saw at least ten more. On August 31 an amateur photographer had\r\ntaken five photos of the lights. Also on the thirty-first two ladies\r\nhad seen a large \"aluminum-colored,\" \"pear-shaped\" object hovering\r\nnear a road north of Lubbock. The report went into the details of\r\nthese sightings and enclosed a set of the photos that had been taken.\r\n\r\nThis report, in itself, was a good UFO report, but the similarity to\r\nthe Albuquerque sighting, both in the description of the object and\r\nthe time that it was seen, was truly amazing.\r\n\r\nI almost overlooked the report from the radar station because it was\r\nfairly short. It said that early on the morning of August 26, only a\r\nfew hours after the Lubbock sighting, two different radars had shown\r\na target traveling 900 miles per hour at 13,000 feet on a\r\nnorthwesterly heading. The target had been observed for six minutes\r\nand an F-86 jet interceptor had been scrambled but by the time the F-\r\n86 had climbed into the air the target was gone. The last paragraph\r\nin the report was rather curt and to the point. It was apparently in\r\nanticipation of the comments the report would draw. It said that the\r\ntarget was not caused by weather. The officer in charge of the radar\r\nstation and several members of his crew had been operating radar for\r\nseven years and they could recognize a weather target. This target\r\nwas real.\r\n\r\nI quickly took out a map of the United States and drew in a course\r\nline between Lubbock and the radar station. A UFO flying between\r\nthese two points would be on a northwesterly heading and the times it\r\nwas seen at the two places gave it a speed of roughly 900 miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThis was by far the best combination of UFO reports I'd ever read\r\nand I'd read every one in the Air Force's files.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did after reading the reports was to rush a set of\r\nthe Lubbock photos to the intelligence officer of the 34th Air\r\nDivision in Albuquerque. I asked him to show the photos to the AEC\r\nemployee and his wife without telling them what they were. I\r\nrequested an answer by wire. Later the next day I received my answer:\r\n\"Observers immediately said that this is what they saw on the night\r\nof 25 August. Details by airmail.\" The details were a sketch the man\r\nand his wife had made of a wing around the photo of the Lubbock\r\nLights. The number of lights in the photo and the number of lights\r\nthe two observers had seen on the wing didn't tally, but they\r\nexplained this by saying that they could have been wrong in their\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nThe next day I flew to Lubbock to see if I could find an answer to\r\nall of these mysterious happenings.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Lubbock about 5:00P.M. and contacted the intelligence\r\nofficer at Reese AFB. He knew that I was on my way and had already\r\nset up a meeting with the four professors. Right after dinner we met\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf a group had been hand-picked to observe a UFO, we couldn't have\r\npicked a more technically qualified group of people. They were:\r\n\r\nDr. W. I. Robinson, Professor of Geology.\r\n\r\nDr. A. G. Oberg, Professor of Chemical Engineering.\r\n\r\nProfessor W. L. Ducker, Head of the Petroleum Engineering Department.\r\n\r\nDr. George, Professor of Physics.\r\n\r\nThis is their story:\r\n\r\nOn the evening of August 25 the four men were sitting in Dr.\r\nRobinson's back yard. They were discussing micrometeorites and\r\ndrinking tea. They jokingly stressed this point. At nine-twenty a\r\nformation of lights streaked across the sky directly over their\r\nheads. It all happened so fast that none of them had a chance to get\r\na good look. One of the men mentioned that he had always admonished\r\nhis students for not being more observant; now he was in that spot.\r\nHe and his colleagues realized they could remember only a few details\r\nof what they had seen. The lights were a weird bluish-green color and\r\nthey were in a semicircular formation. They estimated that there were\r\nfrom fifteen to thirty separate lights and that they were moving from\r\nnorth to south. Their one wish at this time was that the lights would\r\nreappear. They did; about an hour later the lights went over again.\r\nThis time the professors were a little better prepared. With the\r\ninitial shock worn off, they had time to get a better look. The\r\ndetails they had remembered from the first flight checked. There was\r\none difference; in this flight the lights were not in any orderly\r\nformation, they were just in a group.\r\n\r\nThe professors reasoned that if the UFO's appeared twice they might\r\ncome back. Come back they did. The next night and apparently many\r\ntimes later, as the professors made twelve more observations during\r\nthe next few weeks. For these later sightings they added two more\r\npeople to their observing team.\r\n\r\nBeing methodical, as college professors are, they made every attempt\r\nto get a good set of data. They measured the angle through which the\r\nobjects traveled and timed them. The several flights they checked\r\ntraveled through 90 degrees of sky in three seconds, or 30 degrees\r\nper second. The lights usually suddenly appeared 45 degrees above the\r\nnorthern horizon, and abruptly went out 45 degrees above the southern\r\nhorizon. They always traveled in this north-to-south direction.\r\nOutside of the first flight, in which the objects were in a roughly\r\nsemicircular formation, in none of the rest of the flights did they\r\nnote any regular pattern. Two or three flights were often seen in one\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThey had tried to measure the altitude, with no success. First they\r\ntried to compare the lights to the height of clouds but the clouds\r\nwere never near the lights, or vice versa. Next they tried a more\r\nelaborate scheme. They measured off a base line perpendicular to the\r\nobjects' usual flight path. Friends of the professors made up two\r\nteams. Each of the two teams was equipped with elevation-measuring\r\ndevices, and one team was stationed at each end of the base line. The\r\ntwo teams were linked together by two-way radios. If they sighted the\r\nobjects they would track and time them, thus getting the speed and\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately neither team ever saw the lights. But the lights never\r\nseemed to want to run the course. The wives of some of the watchers\r\nclaimed to have seen them from their homes in the city. This later\r\nproved to be a clue.\r\n\r\nThe professors were not the sole observers of the mysterious lights.\r\nFor two weeks hundreds of other people for miles around Lubbock\r\nreported that they saw the same lights. The professors checked many\r\nof these reports against the times of the flights they had seen and\r\nrecorded, and many checked out close. They attempted to question\r\nthese observers as to the length of time they had seen the lights and\r\nangles at which they had seen them, but the professors learned what I\r\nalready knew, people are poor observers.\r\n\r\nNaturally there has been much discussion among the professors and\r\ntheir friends as to the nature of the lights. A few simple\r\nmathematical calculations showed that if the lights were very high\r\nthey would be traveling very fast. The possibility that they were\r\nsome natural phenomena was, of course, discussed and seriously\r\nconsidered. The professors did a lot of thinking and research and\r\ndecided that if they were natural phenomena they were something\r\naltogether new. Dr. George, who has since died, studied the phenomena\r\nof the night sky during his years as a professor at the University of\r\nAlaska, and he had never seen or heard of anything like this before.\r\n\r\nThis was the professors' story. It was early in the morning when we\r\nreturned to Reese AFB. I sat up a few more hours unsuccessfully\r\ntrying to figure out what they had seen.\r\n\r\nThe next day I again met the intelligence officer and we went to\r\ntalk to Carl Hart, Jr., the amateur photographer who had taken the\r\npictures of the lights. Hart was a freshman at Texas Tech. His story\r\nwas that on the night of August 31 he was lying in his bed in an\r\nupstairs room of the Hart home. He, like everyone else in Lubbock,\r\nhad heard about the lights but he had never seen them. It was a warm\r\nnight and his bed was pushed over next to an open window. He was\r\nlooking out at the clear night sky, and had been in bed about a half\r\nhour, when he saw a formation of the lights appear in the north,\r\ncross an open patch of sky, and disappear over his house. Knowing\r\nthat the lights might reappear as they had done in the past, he\r\ngrabbed his loaded Kodak 35, set the lens and shutter at f 3.5 and\r\none tenth of a second, and went out into the middle of the back yard.\r\nBefore long his vigil was rewarded when the lights made a second\r\npass. He got two pictures. A third formation went over a few minutes\r\nlater and he got three more pictures. The next morning bright and\r\nearly Hart said he took the roll of unexposed film to a friend who\r\nran a photo-finishing shop. He explained that he did all of his film\r\nprocessing in this friend's lab. He told the friend about the\r\npictures and they quickly developed them.\r\n\r\nI stopped Hart at this point and asked why he didn't get more\r\nexcited about what could be the biggest news photos of the century.\r\nHe said that the lights had appeared to be so dim that he was sure he\r\ndidn't have anything on the negatives; had he thought that he did\r\nhave some good pictures he would have awakened his friend to develop\r\nthe negatives right away.\r\n\r\nWhen he developed the negatives and saw that they showed an image,\r\nhis friend suggested that he call the newspaper. At first the paper\r\nwasn't interested but then they decided to run the photos. I later\r\nfound out that they had done some checking of their own.\r\n\r\nWe went with Hart into his back yard to re-enact what had taken\r\nplace. He described the lights as being the same dull, glowing bluish-\r\ngreen color as those seen by the professors. The formation was\r\ndifferent, however. The lights Hart saw were always flying in a\r\nperfect V. He traced the path from where they appeared over some\r\ntrees in the north, through an open patch of sky over the back yard,\r\nto a point where they disappeared over the house. From the flight\r\npath he pointed out, the lights had crossed about 120 degrees of open\r\nsky in four seconds. This 30-degree-per-second angular velocity\r\ncorresponded to the professors' measured angular velocity.\r\n\r\nWe made arrangements to borrow Hart's negatives, thanked him for his\r\ninformation, and left.\r\n\r\nArmed with a list of names of other observers of the mysterious\r\nlights, the intelligence officer and I started out to try to get a\r\ncross-section account of the other UFO sightings in the Lubbock area.\r\nAll the stories about the UFO's were the same; various types of\r\nformations of dull bluish-green lights, generally moving north to\r\nsouth. A few people had variations. One lady saw a flying Venetian\r\nblind and another a flying double boiler. One point of interest was\r\nthat very few claimed to have seen the lights before reading the\r\nprofessors' story in the paper, but this could get back to the old\r\nquestion, \"Do people look up if they have no reason to do so?\"\r\n\r\nWe talked to observers in nearby towns. Their stories were the same.\r\nTwo of them, tower operators at an airport, reported that they had\r\nseen the lights on several occasions.\r\n\r\nIt was in one of these outlying towns, Lamesa, that we talked to an\r\nold gentleman, about eighty years old, who gave us a good lead. He\r\nhad seen the lights and he had identified them. Ever since he had\r\nread the story in the papers he had been looking. One evening he and\r\nhis wife were in their yard looking for the lights. All of a sudden\r\ntwo or three appeared. They were in view for several seconds, then\r\nthey were gone. In a few minutes the lights did a repeat performance.\r\nThe man admitted he had been scared. He broke off his story of the\r\nlights and launched into his background as a native Texan, with range\r\nwars, Indians, and stagecoaches under his belt. What he was trying to\r\npoint out was that despite the range wars, Indians, and stagecoaches,\r\nhe had been scared. His wife had been scared too. We had some\r\ndifficulty getting back to the lights but we finally made it. The\r\nthird time they came around, he said, one of the lights emitted a\r\nsound. It said, \"Plover.\" The old gentleman had immediately\r\nidentified it as a plover, a water bird about the size of a quail.\r\nLater that night, and on several other occasions, they had seen the\r\nsame thing. After a few more hair-raising but interesting stories of\r\nthe old west Texas, we left.\r\n\r\nOur next stop was the federal game warden's office in Lubbock. We\r\ngot the low-down on plovers. We explained our interest and the warden\r\nwas very helpful. He had been around west Texas all of his life so he\r\nwas familiar with wildlife. The oily white breast of a plover could\r\neasily reflect light, but plovers usually didn't travel in more than\r\npairs, or three at the most. He had never seen or heard of them\r\ntraveling in a flock of fifteen to thirty but, of course, this wasn't\r\nimpossible. Ducks, yes, but probably not plovers. He did say that for\r\nsome unknown reason there were more than the usual number of plovers\r\nin the area that fall.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to get the negatives that Hart had lent us back to the\r\nphoto lab at Wright Field, but I had one more call to make. I wanted\r\nto talk to the two ladies who had seen a strange object hovering near\r\ntheir car, but I also wanted to write my report before I left\r\nLubbock. Two Air Force special investigators from Reese AFB offered\r\nto talk to the ladies, so I stayed at the air base and finished my\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThat night when the investigators came back, I got the story. They\r\nhad spent the whole day talking to the ladies and doing a little\r\ndiscreet checking into their backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThe two ladies, a mother and her daughter, had left their home in\r\nMatador, Texas, 70 miles northeast of Lubbock, about twelve-thirty\r\nP.M. on August 31. They were driving along in their car when they\r\nsuddenly noticed \"a pear-shaped\" object about 150 yards ahead of\r\nthem. It was just off the side of the road, about 120 feet in the\r\nair. It was drifting slowly to the east, \"less than the speed\r\nrequired to take off in a Cub airplane.\" They drove on down the road\r\nabout 50 more yards, stopped, and got out of the car. The object,\r\nwhich they estimated to be the size of a B-29 fuselage, was still\r\ndrifting along slowly. There was no sign of any exhaust blast and\r\nthey heard no noise, but they did see a \"porthole\" in the side of the\r\nobject. In a few seconds the object began to pick up speed and\r\nrapidly climb out of sight. As it climbed it seemed to have a tight\r\nspiraling motion.\r\n\r\nThe investigation showed that the two ladies were \"solid citizens,\"\r\nwith absolutely no talents, or reasons, for fabricating such a story.\r\nThe daughter was fairly familiar with aircraft. Her husband was an\r\nAir Force officer then in Korea, and she had been living near air\r\nbases for several years. The ladies had said that the object was\r\n\"drifting\" to the east, which possibly indicated that it was moving\r\nwith the wind, but on further investigation it was found that it was\r\nmoving _into_ the wind.\r\n\r\nThe two investigators had worked all day and hadn't come up with the\r\nslightest indication of an answer.\r\n\r\nThis added the final section to my now voluminous report on the\r\nLubbock affair.\r\n\r\nThe next morning as I rode to the airport to catch an airliner back\r\nto Dayton I tried to put the whole puzzle together. It was hard to\r\nbelieve that all Fd heard was real. Did a huge flying wing pass over\r\nAlbuquerque and travel 250 miles to Lubbock in about fifteen minutes?\r\nThis would be about 900 miles per hour. Did the radar station in\r\nWashington pick up the same thing? I'd checked the distances on the\r\nbig wall map in flight operations just before leaving Reese AFB. It\r\nwas 1,300 miles from Lubbock to the radar site. From talking to\r\npeople, we decided that the lights were apparently still around\r\nLubbock at 11:20P.M. and the radar picked them up just after\r\nmidnight. They would have had to be traveling about 780 miles per\r\nhour. This was fairly close to the 900-mile-per-hour speed clocked by\r\nthe two radars. The photos of the Lubbock Lights checked with the\r\ndescription of what the AEC employee and his wife had seen in\r\nAlbuquerque. Nobody in Lubbock, however, had reported seeing a\r\n\"flying wing\" with lights. All of this was swimming around in my mind\r\nwhen I stepped out of the staff car at the Lubbock airport.\r\n\r\nMy plane had already landed so I checked in at the ticket counter,\r\npicked up a morning paper, and ran out and got into the airplane. I\r\nsat down next to a man wearing a Stetson hat and cowboy boots. I soon\r\nfound out he was a retired rancher from Lubbock.\r\n\r\nOn the front page of the paper was an account of a large meteor that\r\nhad flashed across New Mexico, west Texas, and Oklahoma the night\r\nbefore. According to the newspaper account, it was very spectacular\r\nand had startled a good many people in Lubbock. I was interested in\r\nthe story because I had seen this meteor. It was a spectacular sight\r\nand I could easily understand how such things could be called UFO's.\r\nMy seat partner must have noticed that I was reading the story of the\r\nmeteor because he commented that a friend of his, the man who had\r\nbrought him to the airport, had seen it. We talked about the meteor.\r\nThis led to a discussion of other odd happenings and left a perfect\r\nopening for him to bring up the Lubbock Lights. He asked me if I'd\r\nheard about them. I said that I had heard a few vague stories. I\r\nhoped that this would stave off any detailed accounts of stories I\r\nhad been saturated with during the past five days, but it didn't. I\r\nheard all the details all over again.\r\n\r\nAs he talked on, I settled back in my seat waiting for a certain\r\nthing to happen. Pretty soon it came. The rancher hesitated and the\r\ntone of his voice changed to a half-proud, half-apologetic tone. I'd\r\nheard this transition many times in the past few months; he was going\r\nto tell about the UFO that he had seen. He was going to tell how he\r\nhad seen the bluish-green lights. I was wrong; what he said knocked\r\nme out of my boredom.\r\n\r\nThe same night that the college professors had seen their formation\r\nof lights his wife had seen something. Nobody in Lubbock knew about\r\nthe story, not even their friends. He didn't want anyone to think he\r\nand his wife were \"crazy.\" He was telling me only because I was a\r\nstranger. Just after dark his wife had gone outdoors to take some\r\nsheets off the clothesline. He was inside the house reading the\r\npaper. Suddenly his wife had rushed into the house, as he told the\r\nstory, \"as white as the sheets she was carrying.\" As close as he\r\ncould remember, he said, this was about ten minutes before the\r\nprofessors made their first sighting. He stopped at this point to\r\ntell me about his wife, she wasn't prone to be \"flighty\" and she\r\n\"never made up tales.\" This character qualification was also standard\r\nfor UFO storytellers. The reason his wife was so upset was that she\r\nhad seen a large object glide swiftly and silently over the house.\r\nShe said it looked like \"an airplane without a body.\" On the back\r\nedge of the wing were pairs of glowing bluish lights. The Albuquerque\r\nsighting! He said he didn't have any idea what his wife had seen but\r\nhe thought that it was an interesting story.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ an interesting story. It hit me right between the eyes. I\r\nknew the rancher and his wife couldn't have possibly heard the\r\nAlbuquerque couple's story, only they and a few Air Force people knew\r\nabout it. The chances of two identical stories being made up were\r\ninfinitesimal, especially since neither of them fitted the standard\r\nLubbock Light description. I wondered how many other people in\r\nLubbock, Albuquerque, or anywhere in the Southwest had seen a similar\r\nUFO during this period and hesitated to mention it.\r\n\r\nI tried to get a few more facts from the rancher but he'd told me\r\nall he knew. At Dallas I boarded an airliner to Dayton and he went on\r\nto Baton Rouge, never knowing what he'd added to the story of the\r\nLubbock Lights.\r\n\r\nOn the way to Dayton I figured out a plan of attack on the thousands\r\nof words of notes I'd taken. The best thing to do, I decided, was to\r\ntreat each sighting in the Lubbock Light series as a separate\r\nincident. All of them seemed to be dependent upon each other for\r\nimportance. If the objects that were reported in several of the\r\nincidents could be identified, the rest would merely become average\r\nUFO reports. The photographs taken by Carl Hart, Jr., became number\r\none on the agenda.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I reached Dayton I took Hart's negatives to the Photo\r\nReconnaissance Laboratory at Wright Field. This laboratory, staffed\r\nby the Air Force's top photography experts, did all of our analysis\r\nof photographs. They went right to work on the negatives and soon had\r\na report.\r\n\r\nThere had originally been five negatives, but when we asked to\r\nborrow them Hart could only produce four. The negatives were badly\r\nscratched and dirty because so many people had handled them, so it\r\nwas difficult to tell the actual photographic images from the dust\r\nspots and scratches. The first thing that the lab did was to look at\r\neach spot on the negatives to see if it was an actual photographic\r\nimage. They found that the photos showed an inverted V formation of\r\nlights. In each photo the individual image of a light was badly\r\nblurred due to motion of the camera, but by careful scrutiny of each\r\nblurred image they were able to determine that the original lights\r\nthat Hart had photographed were circular, near pinpoint sources of\r\nlight. Like a bright star, or a distant light bulb. Next they made\r\nenlargements from the negatives and carefully plotted the position of\r\neach light in the formation.\r\n\r\nIn each photograph the individual lights in the formation shifted\r\nposition according to a definite pattern.\r\n\r\nOne additional factor that was brought out in the report was that\r\nalthough the photos were taken on a clear night no images of the\r\nstars could be found in the background. This proved one thing, the\r\nlights, which were overexposed in the photograph, were a great deal\r\nbrighter than the stars, or the lights affected the film more than\r\nthe light from the stars.\r\n\r\nThis was all that the photos showed. It was impossible to determine\r\nthe size of each image of the group, speed, or altitude.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to try to duplicate what Hart said he had done. I\r\nenlisted the aid of several friends and we tried to photograph a\r\nmoving light. When we were talking to Hart in Lubbock, he had taken\r\nus to his back yard, where he had shot the pictures. He had traced\r\nthe flight path of fights across the sky. We had him estimate the\r\nspeed by following an imaginary flight of lights across the sky. It\r\ncame out to about four seconds. We had a camera identical to the one\r\nthat Hart had used and set up a light to move at the same speed as\r\nthe UFO's had flown. We tried to take photographs. In four seconds we\r\ncould get only two poor shots. These were badly blurred, much worse\r\nthan Hart's, due to the one-tenth-of-a-second shutter speed. We\r\nrepeated our experiment several times, each time with the same\r\nresults. This made a lot of people doubt the authenticity of Hart's\r\nphotos.\r\n\r\nWith the completed photo lab report in my hands, I was still without\r\nan answer. The report was interesting but didn't prove anything. All\r\nI could do was to get opinions from as qualified sources as I could\r\nfind. A physiologist at the Aeromedical Laboratory knocked out the\r\ntiming theory immediately by saying that if Hart had been excited he\r\ncould have easily taken three photos in four seconds if we could get\r\ntwo in four seconds in our experiment. Several professional\r\nphotographers, one of them a top _Life_ photographer, said that if\r\nHart was familiar with his camera and was familiar with panning\r\naction shots, his photos would have shown much less blur than ours. I\r\nrecalled what I heard about Hart's having photographed sporting\r\nevents for the Lubbock newspaper. This would have called for a good\r\npanning technique.\r\n\r\nThe photographs didn't tally with the description of the lights that\r\nthe professors had seen; in fact, they were firmly convinced that\r\nthey were of \"home manufacture.\" The professors had reported soft,\r\nglowing lights yet the photos showed what should have been extremely\r\nbright lights. Hart reported a perfect formation while the\r\nprofessors, except for the first flight, reported an unorderly group.\r\nThere was no way to explain this disagreement in the arrangement of\r\nthe lights. Of course, it wasn't impossible that on the night that\r\nHart saw the lights they were flying in a V formation. The first time\r\nthe professors saw them they were flying in a semicircle.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the lights was difficult to explain. Again I went\r\nto the people in the Photo Reconnaissance Laboratory. I asked them if\r\nthere was any possible situation that could cause this. They said\r\nyes. An intensely bright light source which had a color far over in\r\nthe red end of the spectrum, bordering on infrared, could do it. The\r\neye is not sensitive to such a light, it could appear dim to the eye\r\nyet be \"bright\" to the film. I asked them what kind of a light source\r\nwould cause this. There were several things, if you want to\r\nspeculate, they said, extremely high temperatures for one. But this\r\nwas as far as they would go. We have nothing in this world that flies\r\nthat appears dim to the eye yet will show bright on film, they said.\r\n\r\nThis ended the investigation of the photographs, and the\r\ninvestigation ended at a blank wall. My official conclusion, which\r\nwas later given to the press, was that \"The photos were never proven\r\nto be a hoax but neither were they proven to be genuine.\" There is no\r\ndefinite answer.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis of the investigation was now switched to the\r\nprofessors' sighting. The meager amount of data that they had\r\ngathered seemed to be accurate but it was inconclusive as far as\r\ngetting a definite answer was concerned. They had measured two\r\nthings, how much of the sky the objects had crossed in a certain time\r\nand the angle from one side of the formation to the other. These\r\nfigures didn't mean a great deal, however, since the altitude at\r\nwhich the formation of lights was flying was unknown. If you assumed\r\nthat the objects were flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet you could\r\neasily compute that they were traveling about 3,600 miles per hour,\r\nor five to six times the speed of sound. The formation would have\r\nbeen about 1,750 feet wide. If each light was a separate object it\r\ncould have been in the neighborhood of 100 feet in diameter. These\r\nfigures were only a guess since nobody knew if the lights were at,\r\nabove, or below 10,000 feet. If they had been higher they would have\r\nbeen going faster and have been larger. If lower than 10,000 feet,\r\nslower and smaller.\r\n\r\nThe only solid lead that had developed while the Reese AFB\r\nintelligence officer and I were investigating the professors'\r\nsightings was that the UFO's were birds reflecting the city lights;\r\nspecifically plover. The old cowboy from Lamesa had described\r\nsomething identical to what the professors described and they were\r\nplover. Secondly, whenever the professors left the vicinity of their\r\nhomes to look for the lights they didn't see them, yet their wives,\r\nwho stayed at home, did see them. If the \"lights\" were birds they\r\nwould be flying low and couldn't be seen from more than a few hundred\r\nfeet. While in Lubbock I'd noticed several main boulevards lighted\r\nwith the bluish mercury vapor lights. I called the intelligence\r\nofficer at Reese AFB and he airmailed me a city map of Lubbock with\r\nthe mercury-vapor-lighted streets marked. The place where the\r\nprofessors had made their observations was close to one of these\r\nstreets. The big hitch in this theory was that people living miles\r\nfrom a mercury-vapor-lighted boulevard had also reported the lights.\r\nHow many of these sightings were due to the power of suggestion and\r\nhow many were authentic I didn't know. If I could have found out, it\r\nwould have been possible to plot the sightings in Lubbock, and if\r\nthey were all located close to the lighted boulevards, birds would be\r\nan answer. This, however, it was impossible to do.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the lights didn't make any perceivable sound seemed as\r\nif it might be a clue. Birds or light phenomena wouldn't make any\r\nsound, but how about some object of appreciable size traveling at or\r\nabove the speed of sound? Jet airplanes don't fly as fast as the\r\nspeed of sound but they make a horrible roar. Artillery shells, which\r\nare going much faster than aircraft, whine as they go through the\r\nair. I knew that a great deal of the noise from a jet is due to the\r\nheated air rushing out of the tail pipe, but I didn't know exactly\r\nhow much of the noise this caused. If a jet airplane with a silent\r\nengine could be built, how much noise would it make? How far could it\r\nbe heard? To get the answer I contacted National Advisory Committee\r\nfor Aeronautics Laboratory at Langley AFB, a government agency which\r\nspecializes in aeronautical research. They didn't know. Neither they\r\nnor anybody else had ever done any research on this question. Their\r\nopinion was that such an aircraft could not be heard 5,000 or 10,000\r\nfeet away. Aerodynamicists at Wright Field's Aircraft Laboratory\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nI called the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratories at Aberdeen\r\nProving Grounds, Maryland, to find out why artillery shells whine.\r\nThese people develop and test all kinds of shells so they would have\r\nan answer if anybody did. They said that the majority of the whine of\r\nan artillery shell is probably caused by the flat back end of the\r\nshell. If a perfectly streamlined shell could be used it would not\r\nhave any perceivable whine.\r\n\r\nWhat I found out, or didn't find out, about the sound of an object\r\nmoving at several times the speed of sound was typical of nearly\r\nevery question that came up regarding UFO's. We were working in a\r\nfield where there were no definite answers to questions. In some\r\ninstances we were getting into fields far advanced above the then\r\npresent levels of research. In other instances we were getting into\r\nfields where no research had been done at all. It made the problem of\r\nUFO analysis one of getting opinions. All we could do was hope the\r\nopinions we were getting were the best.\r\n\r\nMy attempts to reach a definite conclusion as to what the professors\r\nhad seen met another blank wall. I had no more success than I'd had\r\ntrying to reach a conclusion on the authenticity of the photographs.\r\n\r\nA thorough analysis of the reports of the flying wings seen by the\r\nretired rancher's wife in Lubbock and the AEC employee and his wife\r\nin Albuquerque was made. The story from the two ladies who saw the\r\naluminum-colored pear-shaped object hovering near the road near\r\nMatador, Texas, was studied, checked, and rechecked. Another blank\r\nwall on all three of these sightings.\r\n\r\nBy the time I got around to working on the report from the radar\r\nstation in Washington State, the data of the weather conditions that\r\nexisted on the night of the sighting had arrived. I turned the\r\nincident folder over to the electronics specialists at ATIC. They\r\nmade the analysis and determined that the targets were caused by\r\nweather, although it was a borderline case. They further surmised\r\nthat since the targets had been picked up on two radars, if I checked\r\nI'd find out that the two targets looked different on the two\r\nradarscopes. This is a characteristic of a weather target picked up\r\non radars operating on different frequencies. I did check. I called\r\nthe radar station and talked to the captain who was in charge of the\r\ncrew the night the target had been picked up.\r\n\r\nThe target looked the same on both scopes. This was one of the\r\nreasons it had been reported, the captain told me. If the target\r\nhadn't been the same on both scopes, he wouldn't have made the report\r\nsince he would have thought he had a weather target. He asked me what\r\nATIC thought about the sighting. I said that Captain James thought it\r\nwas weather. Just before the long-distance wires between Dayton and\r\nWashington melted, I caught some comment about people sitting in\r\nswivel chairs miles from the closest radarscope. . . . I took it that\r\nhe didn't agree the target was caused by weather. But that's the way\r\nit officially stands today.\r\n\r\nAlthough the case of the Lubbock Lights is officially dead, its\r\nmemory lingers on. There have never been any more reliable reports of\r\n\"flying wings\" but lights somewhat similar to those seen by the\r\nprofessors have been reported. In about 70 per cent of these cases\r\nthey were proved to be birds reflecting city lights.\r\n\r\nThe known elements of the case, the professors' sightings and the\r\nphotos, have been dragged back and forth across every type of paper\r\nupon which written material appears, from the cheapest, coarsest pulp\r\nto the slick _Life_ pages. Saucer addicts have studied and offered\r\nthe case as all-conclusive proof, with photos, that UFO's are\r\ninterplanetary. Dr. Donald Menzel of Harvard studied the case and\r\nripped the sightings to shreds in _Look_, _Time_, and his book,\r\n_Flying_ _Saucers_, with the theory that the professors were merely\r\nlooking at refracted city lights. But none of these people even had\r\naccess to the full report. This is the first time it has ever been\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nThe only other people outside Project Blue Book who have studied the\r\ncomplete case of the Lubbock Lights were a group who, due to their\r\nassociations with the government, had complete access to our files.\r\nAnd these people were not pulp writers or wide-eyed fanatics, they\r\nwere scientists--rocket experts, nuclear physicists, and intelligence\r\nexperts. They had banded together to study our UFO reports because\r\nthey were convinced that some of the UFO's that were being reported\r\nwere interplanetary spaceships and the Lubbock series was one of\r\nthese reports. The fact that the formations of lights were in\r\ndifferent shapes didn't bother them; in fact, it convinced them all\r\nthe more that their ideas of how a spaceship might operate were\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThis group of scientists believed that the spaceships, or at least\r\nthe part of the spaceship that came relatively close to the earth,\r\nwould have to have a highly swept-back wing configuration. And they\r\nbelieved that for propulsion and control the craft had a series of\r\nsmall jet orifices all around its edge. Various combinations of these\r\nsmall jets would be turned on to get various flight attitudes. The\r\nlights that the various observers saw differed in arrangement because\r\nthe craft was flying in different flight attitudes.\r\n\r\n(Three years later the Canadian Government announced that this was\r\nexactly the way that they had planned to control the flying saucer\r\nthat they were trying to build. They had to give up their plans for\r\nthe development of the saucer-like craft, but now the project has\r\nbeen taken over by the U.S. Air Force.)\r\n\r\nThis is the complete story of the Lubbock Lights as it is carried in\r\nthe Air Force files, one of the most interesting and most\r\ncontroversial collection of UFO sightings ever to be reported to\r\nProject Blue Book. Officially all of the sightings, except the UFO\r\nthat was picked up on radar, are unknowns.\r\n\r\nPersonally I thought that the professors' lights might have been\r\nsome kind of birds reflecting the light from mercury-vapor street\r\nlights, but I was wrong. They weren't birds, they weren't refracted\r\nlight, but they weren't spaceships. The lights that the professors\r\nsaw--the backbone of the Lubbock Light series--have been positively\r\nidentified as a very commonplace and easily explainable natural\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nIt is very unfortunate that I can't divulge exactly the way the\r\nanswer was found because it is an interesting story of how a\r\nscientist set up complete instrumentation to track down the lights\r\nand how he spent several months testing theory after theory until he\r\nfinally hit upon the answer. Telling the story would lead to his\r\nidentity and, in exchange for his story, I promised the man complete\r\nanonymity. But he fully convinced me that he had the answer, and\r\nafter having heard hundreds of explanations of UFO's, I don't\r\nconvince easily.\r\n\r\nWith the most important phase of the Lubbock Lights \"solved\"--the\r\nsightings by the professors--the other phases become only good UFO\r\nreports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE\r\n\r\nThe New Project Grudge\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Lubbock, Lieutenant Henry Metscher, who was helping\r\nme on Project Grudge, had been sorting out the many bits and pieces\r\nof information that Lieutenant Jerry Cummings and Lieutenant Colonel\r\nRosengarten had brought back from Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and he\r\nhad the answers.\r\n\r\nThe UFO that the student radar operator had assumed to be traveling\r\nat a terrific speed because he couldn't lock on to it turned out to\r\nbe a 400-mile-an-hour conventional airplane. He'd just gotten fouled\r\nup on his procedures for putting the radar set on automatic tracking.\r\nThe sighting by the two officers in the T-33 jet fell apart when\r\nMetscher showed how they'd seen a balloon.\r\n\r\nThe second radar sighting of the series also turned out to be a\r\nballoon. The frantic phone call from headquarters requesting a\r\nreading on the object's altitude was to settle a bet. Some officers\r\nin headquarters had seen the balloon launched and were betting on how\r\nhigh it was.\r\n\r\nThe second day's radar sightings were caused by another balloon and\r\nweather--both enhanced by the firm conviction that there were some\r\nmighty queer goings on over Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe success with the Fort Monmouth Incident had gone to our heads\r\nand we were convinced that with a little diligent digging we'd be\r\nknocking off saucers like an ace skeet-shooter. With all the\r\nconfidence in the world, I attacked the Long Beach Incident, which\r\nI'd had to drop to go to Lubbock, Texas. But if saucers could laugh,\r\nthey were probably zipping through the stratosphere chuckling to\r\nthemselves, because there was no neat solution to this one.\r\n\r\nIn the original report of how the six F-86's chased the high-flying\r\nUFO over Long Beach, the intelligence officer who made the report had\r\nsaid that he'd checked all aircraft flights, therefore this wasn't\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\nThe UFO could have been a balloon, so I sent a wire to the Air Force\r\nweather detachment at the Long Beach Municipal Airport. I wanted the\r\ntrack of any balloon that was in the air at 7:55A.M. on September 23,\r\n1951. While I was waiting for the answers to my two wires, Lieutenant\r\nMetscher and I began to sort out old UFO reports. It was a big job\r\nbecause back in 1949, when the old Project Grudge had been disbanded,\r\nthe files had just been dumped into storage bins. Hank and I now had\r\nfour filing case drawers full of a heterogeneous mass of UFO reports,\r\nletters, copies of letters, and memos.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't get to do much sorting because the mail girl brought in\r\na copy of a wire that had just arrived. It was a report of a UFO\r\nsighting at Terre Haute, Indiana. I read it and told Metscher that\r\nI'd quickly whip out an answer and get back to helping him sort. But\r\nit didn't prove to be that easy.\r\n\r\nThe report from Terre Haute said that on October 9, a CAA employee\r\nat Hulman Municipal Airport had observed a silvery UFO. Three minutes\r\nlater a pilot, flying east of Terre Haute, had seen a similar object.\r\nThe report lacked many details but a few phone calls filled me in on\r\nthe complete story.\r\n\r\nAt 1:43P.M. on the ninth a CAA employee at the airport was walking\r\nacross the ramp in front of the administration building. He happened\r\nto glance up at the sky--why, he didn't know--and out of the corner\r\nof his eye he caught a flash of light on the southeastern horizon. He\r\nstopped and looked at the sky where the flash of light had been but\r\nhe couldn't see anything. He was just about to walk on when he\r\nnoticed what he described as \"a pinpoint\" of light in the same spot\r\nwhere he'd seen the flash. In a second or two the \"pinpoint\" grew\r\nlarger and it was obvious to the CAA man that something was\r\napproaching the airport at a terrific speed. As he watched, the\r\nobject grew larger and larger until it flashed directly overhead and\r\ndisappeared to the northwest. The CAA man said it all happened so\r\nfast and he was so amazed that he hadn't called anybody to come out\r\nof the nearby hangar and watch the UFO. But when he'd calmed down he\r\nremembered a few facts. The UFO had been in sight for about fifteen\r\nseconds and during this time it had passed from horizon to horizon.\r\nIt was shaped like a \"flattened tennis ball,\" was a bright silver\r\ncolor, and when it was directly overhead it was \"the size of a 50-\r\ncent piece held at arm's length.\"\r\n\r\nBut this wasn't all there was to the report. A matter of minutes\r\nafter the sighting a pilot radioed Terre Haute that he had seen a\r\nUFO. He was flying from Greencastle, Indiana, to Paris, Illinois,\r\nwhen just east of Paris he'd looked back and to his left. There,\r\nlevel with his airplane and fairly close, was a large silvery object,\r\n\"like a flattened orange,\" hanging motionless in the sky. He looked\r\nat it a few seconds, then hauled his plane around in a tight left\r\nbank. He headed directly toward the UFO, but it suddenly began to\r\npick up speed and shot off toward the northeast. The time, by the\r\nclock on his instrument panel, was 1:45P.M.--just two minutes after\r\nthe sighting at Terre Haute.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished calling I got an aeronautical chart out of the file\r\nand plotted the points of the sighting. The CAA employee had seen the\r\nUFO disappear over the northwestern horizon. The pilot had been\r\nflying from Greencastle, Indiana, to Paris, Illinois, so he'd have\r\nbeen flying on a heading of just a little less than 270 degrees, or\r\nalmost straight west. He was just east of Paris when he'd first seen\r\nthe UFO, and since he said that he'd looked back and to his left, the\r\nspot where he saw the UFO would be right at a spot where the CAA man\r\nhad seen his UFO disappear. Both observers had checked their watches\r\nwith radio time just after the sightings, so there couldn't be more\r\nthan a few seconds' discrepancy. All I could conclude was that both\r\nhad seen the same UFO.\r\n\r\nI checked the path of every balloon in the Midwest. I checked the\r\nweather--it was a clear, cloudless day; I had the two observers'\r\nbackgrounds checked and I even checked for air traffic, although I\r\nknew the UFO wasn't an airplane. I researched the University of\r\nDayton library for everything on daylight meteors, but this was no\r\ngood. From the description the CAA employee gave, what he'd seen had\r\nbeen a clear-cut, distinct, flattened sphere, with no smoke trail, no\r\nsparks and no tail. A daylight meteor, so low as to be described as\r\n\"a 50-cent piece held at arm's length,\" would have had a smoke trail,\r\nsparks, and would have made a roar that would have jolted the Sphinx.\r\nThis one was quiet. Besides, no daylight meteor stops long enough to\r\nlet an airplane turn into it.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Unknown.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the data from the Long Beach Incident came in and I\r\nstarted to put it together. A weather balloon had been launched from\r\nthe Long Beach Airport, and it was in the vicinity where the six F-\r\n86's had made their unsuccessful attempt to intercept a UFO. I\r\nplotted out the path of the balloon, the reported path of the UFO,\r\nand the flight paths of the F-86's. The paths of the balloon and the\r\nF-86's were accurate, I knew, because the balloon was being tracked\r\nby radio fixes and the F-86's had been tracked by radar. At only one\r\npoint did the paths of the balloon, UFO, and F-86's coincide. When\r\nthe first two F-86's made their initial visual contact with the UFO\r\nthey were looking almost directly at the balloon. But from then on,\r\neven by altering the courses of the F-86's, I couldn't prove a thing.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the weather observers from Long Beach said that during\r\nthe period that the intercept was taking place they had gone outside\r\nand looked at their balloon; it was an exceptionally clear day and\r\nthey could see it at unusually high altitudes. They didn't see any F-\r\n86's around it. And one stronger point, the balloon had burst about\r\nten minutes before the F-86's lost sight of the UFO.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Metscher took over and, riding on his Fort Monmouth\r\nvictory, tried to show how the pilots had seen the balloon. He got\r\nthe same thing I did--nothing.\r\n\r\nOn October 27, 1951, the new Project Grudge was officially\r\nestablished. I'd written the necessary letters and had received the\r\nnecessary endorsements. I'd estimated, itemized, and justified direct\r\ncosts and manpower. I'd conferred, inferred, and referred, and now I\r\nhad the money to operate. The next step was to pile up all this paper\r\nwork as an aerial barrier, let the saucers crash into it, and fall\r\njust outside the door.\r\n\r\nI was given a very flexible operating policy for Project Grudge\r\nbecause no one knew the best way to track down UFO's. I had only one\r\nrestriction and that was that I wouldn't have my people spending time\r\ndoing a lot of wild speculating. Our job would be to analyze each and\r\nevery UFO report and try to find what we believed to be an honest,\r\nunbiased answer. If we could not identify the reported object as\r\nbeing a balloon, meteor, planet, or one of half a hundred other\r\ncommon things that are sometimes called UFO's, we would mark the\r\nfolder \"Unknown\" and file it in a special file. At some later date,\r\nwhen we built up enough of these \"Unknown\" reports, we'd study them.\r\n\r\nAs long as I was chief of the UFO project, this was our basic rule.\r\nIf anyone became anti-flying saucer and was no longer capable of\r\nmaking an unbiased evaluation of a report, out he went. Conversely\r\nanyone who became a believer was through. We were too busy during the\r\ninitial phases of the project to speculate as to whether the unknowns\r\nwere spaceships, space monsters, Soviet weapons, or ethereal visions.\r\n\r\nI had to let three people go for being too pro or too con.\r\n\r\nBy the latter part of November 1951 I knew most of what had taken\r\nplace in prior UFO projects and what I expected to do. The people in\r\nProject Sign and the old Project Grudge had made many mistakes. I\r\nstudied these mistakes and profited by them. I could see that my\r\npredecessors had had a rough job. Mine would be a little bit easier\r\nbecause of the pioneering they had done.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Metscher and I had sorted out all of the pre-1951 files,\r\nrefiled them, studied them, and outlined the future course of the new\r\nProject Grudge.\r\n\r\nWhen Lieut. Colonel Rosengarten and Lieutenant Cummings had been at\r\nthe Pentagon briefing Major General Cabell on the Fort Monmouth\r\nincidents, the general had told them to report back when the new\r\nproject was formed and ready to go. We were ready to go, but before\r\ntaking my ideas to the Pentagon, I thought it might be wise to try\r\nthem out on a few other people to get their reaction. Colonel Frank\r\nDunn, then chief of ATIC, liked this idea. We had many well-known\r\nscientists and engineers who periodically visited ATIC as\r\nconsultants, and Colonel Dunn suggested that these people's opinions\r\nand comments would be valuable. For the next two weeks every visitor\r\nto ATIC who had a reputation as a scientist, engineer, or scholar got\r\na UFO briefing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the names of these people cannot be revealed because I\r\npromised them complete anonymity. But the list reads like a page from\r\n_Great_ _Men_ _of_ _Science_.\r\n\r\nAltogether nine people visited the project during this trial period.\r\nOf the nine, two thought the Air Force was wasting its time, one\r\ncould be called indifferent, and six were very enthusiastic over the\r\nproject. This was a shock to me. I had expected reactions that ranged\r\nfrom an extremely cold absolute zero to a mild twenty below. Instead\r\nI found out that UFO's were being freely and seriously discussed in\r\nscientific circles. The majority of the visitors thought that the Air\r\nForce had goofed on previous projects and were very happy to find out\r\nthat the project was being re-established. All of the visitors, even\r\nthe two who thought we were wasting our time, had good suggestions on\r\nwhat to do. All of them offered their services at any future time\r\nwhen they might be needed. Several of these people became very good\r\nfriends and valuable consultants later on.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks before Christmas, in 1951, Colonel Dunn and I went\r\nto the Pentagon to give my report. Major General John A. Samford had\r\nreplaced Major General Cabell as Director of Intelligence, but\r\nGeneral Samford must have been told about the UFO situation because\r\nhe was familiar with the general aspects of the problem. He had\r\nappointed his Assistant for Production, Brigadier General W. M.\r\nGarland, to ride herd on the project for him.\r\n\r\nColonel Dunn briefly outlined to General Samford what we planned to\r\ndo. He explained our basic policy, that of setting aside the unknowns\r\nand not speculating on them, and he told how the scientists visiting\r\nATIC had liked the plans for the new Project Grudge.\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion about the Air Force's and ATIC's\r\nresponsibility for the UFO reports. General Garland stated, and it\r\nwas later confirmed in writing, that the Air Force was solely\r\nresponsible for investigating and evaluating all UFO reports. Within\r\nthe Air Force, ATIC was the responsible agency. This in turn meant\r\nthat Project Grudge was responsible for all UFO reports made by any\r\nbranch of the military service. I started my briefing by telling\r\nGeneral Samford and his staff about the present UFO situation.\r\n\r\nThe UFO reports had never stopped coming in since they had first\r\nstarted in June 1947. There was some correlation between publicity\r\nand the number of sightings, but it was not an established fact that\r\nreports came in only when the press was playing up UFO's. Just within\r\nthe past few months the number of good reports had increased sharply\r\nand there had been no publicity.\r\n\r\nUFO's were seen more frequently around areas vital to the defense of\r\nthe United States. The Los Alamos-Albuquerque area, Oak Ridge, and\r\nWhite Sands Proving Ground rated high. Port areas, Strategic Air\r\nCommand bases, and industrial areas ranked next. UFO's had been\r\nreported from every state in the Union and from every foreign\r\ncountry. The U.S. did not have a monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of the UFO reports was interesting. Every July there\r\nwas a sudden increase in the number of reports and July was always\r\nthe peak month of the year. Just before Christmas there was usually a\r\nminor peak.\r\n\r\nThe Grudge Report had not been the solution to the UFO problem. It\r\nwas true that a large percentage of the reports were due to the \"mis-\r\nidentification of known objects\"; people were seeing balloons,\r\nairplanes, planets, but this was not the final answer. There were a\r\nfew hoaxes, hallucinations, publicity-seekers, and fatigued pilots,\r\nbut reports from these people constituted less than 1 per cent of the\r\ntotal. Left over was a residue of very good and very \"unexplainable\"\r\nUFO sightings that were classified as unknown.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the reports was getting better, I told the officers;\r\nthey contained more details that could be used for analysis and the\r\ndetails were more precise and accurate. But still they left much to\r\nbe desired.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the nine scientists and engineers who had reviewed the\r\nUFO material at ATIC had made one strong point: we should give top\r\npriority to getting reasonably accurate measurements of the speed,\r\naltitude, and size of reported UFO's. This would serve two purposes.\r\nFirst, it would make it easy to sort out reports of common things,\r\nsuch as balloons, airplanes, etc. Second, and more important, if we\r\ncould get even one fairly accurate measurement that showed that some\r\nobject was traveling through the atmosphere at high speed, and that\r\nit wasn't a meteor, the UFO riddle would be much easier to solve.\r\n\r\nI had worked out a plan to get some measured data, and I presented\r\nit to the group for their comments.\r\n\r\nI felt sure that before long the press would get wind of the Air\r\nForce's renewed effort to identify UFO's. When this happened, instead\r\nof being mysterious about the whole thing, we would freely admit the\r\nexistence of the new project, explain the situation thoroughly and\r\nexactly as it was, and say that all UFO reports made to the Air Force\r\nwould be given careful consideration. In this way we would encourage\r\nmore people to report what they were seeing and we might get some\r\ngood data.\r\n\r\nTo further explain my point, I drew a sketch on a blackboard.\r\nSuppose that a UFO is reported over a fair-sized city. Now we may get\r\none or two reports, and these reports may be rather sketchy. This\r\ndoes us no good--all we can conclude is that somebody saw something\r\nthat he couldn't identify. But suppose fifty people from all over the\r\ncity report the UFO. Then it would be profitable for us to go out and\r\ntalk to these people, find out the time they saw the UFO, and where\r\nthey saw it (the direction and height above the horizon). Then we\r\nmight be able to use these data, work out a triangulation problem,\r\nand get a fairly accurate measurement of speed, altitude, and size.\r\n\r\nRadar, of course, will give an accurate measurement of speed and\r\naltitude, I pointed out, but radar is not infallible. There is always\r\nthe problem of weather. To get accurate radar data on a UFO, it is\r\nalways necessary to prove that it wasn't weather that was causing the\r\ntarget. Radar is valuable, and we wanted radar reports, I said, but\r\nthey should be considered only as a parallel effort and shouldn't\r\ntake the place of visual sightings.\r\n\r\nIn winding up my briefing, I again stressed the point that, as of\r\nthe end of 1951--the date of this briefing--there was no positive\r\nproof that any craft foreign to our knowledge existed. All\r\nrecommendations for the reorganization of Project Grudge were based\r\nsolely upon the fact that there were many incredible reports of UFO's\r\nfrom many very reliable people. But they were still just flying\r\nsaucer reports and couldn't be considered scientific proof.\r\n\r\nEveryone present at the meeting agreed--each had read or had been\r\nbriefed on these incredible reports. In fact, two of the people\r\npresent had seen UFO's.\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting adjourned, Colonel Dunn had one last question. He\r\nknew the answer, but he wanted it confirmed. \"Does the United States\r\nhave a secret weapon that is being reported as a UFO?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was a flat \"No.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few days I was notified that my plan had been given the green\r\nlight. I already had the plan written up in the form of a staff study\r\nso I sent it through channels for formal approval.\r\n\r\nIt had been obvious right from the start of the reorganization of\r\nProject Grudge that there would be questions that no one on my staff\r\nwas technically competent to answer. To have a fully staffed project,\r\nI'd need an astronomer, a physicist, a chemist, a mathematician, a\r\npsychologist, and probably a dozen other specialists. It was, of\r\ncourse, impossible to have all of these people on my staff, so I\r\ndecided to do the next best thing. I would set up a contract with\r\nsome research organization who already had such people on their\r\nstaff; then I would call on them whenever their services were needed.\r\n\r\nI soon found a place that was interested in such a contract, and the\r\nday after Christmas, Colonel S. H. Kirkland, of Colonel Dunn's staff,\r\nand I left Dayton for a two-day conference with these people to\r\noutline what we wanted. Their organization cannot be identified by\r\nname because they are doing other highly secret work for the\r\ngovernment. I'll call them Project Bear.\r\n\r\nProject Bear is a large, well-known research organization in the\r\nMidwest. The several hundred engineers and scientists who make up\r\ntheir staff run from experts on soils to nuclear physicists. They\r\nwould make these people available to me to assist Project Grudge on\r\nany problem that might arise from a UFO report. They did not have a\r\nstaff astronomer or psychologist, but they agreed to get them for us\r\non a subcontract basis. Besides providing experts in every field of\r\nscience, they would make two studies for us; a study of how much a\r\nperson can be expected to see and remember from a UFO sighting, and a\r\nstatistical study of UFO reports. The end product of the study of the\r\npowers of observation of a UFO observer would be an interrogation form.\r\n\r\nEver since the Air Force had been in the UFO business, attempts had\r\nbeen made to construct a form that a person who had seen a UFO could\r\nfill out. Many types had been tried but all of them had major\r\ndisadvantages. Project Bear, working with the psychology department\r\nof a university, would study all of the previous questionnaires,\r\nalong with actual UFO reports, and try to come up with as near a\r\nperfect interrogation form as possible. The idea was to make the form\r\nsimple and yet extract as much and as accurate data as possible from\r\nthe observer.\r\n\r\nThe second study that Project Bear would undertake would be a\r\nstatistical study of all UFO reports. Since 1947 the Air Force had\r\ncollected about 650 reports, but if our plan to encourage UFO reports\r\nworked out the way we expected this number could increase tenfold. To\r\nhandle this volume of reports, Project Bear said that they would set\r\nup a complete UFO file on IBM punch cards. Then if we wanted any bit\r\nof information from the files, it would be a matter of punching a few\r\nbuttons on an IBM card-sorting machine, and the files would be sorted\r\nelectronically in a few seconds. Approximately a hundred items\r\npertaining to a UFO report would be put on each card. These items\r\nincluded everything from the time the UFO was seen to its position in\r\nthe sky and the observer's personality. The items punched on the\r\ncards would correspond to the items on the questionnaires that\r\nProject Bear was going to develop.\r\n\r\nBesides giving us a rapid method of sorting data, this IBM file\r\nwould give us a modus operandi file. Our MO file would be similar to\r\nthe MO files used by police departments to file the methods of\r\noperations of a criminal. Thus when we received a report we could put\r\nthe characteristics of the reported UFO on an IBM punch card, put it\r\ninto the IBM machine, and compare it with the characteristics of\r\nother sightings that had known solutions. The answer might be that\r\nout of the one hundred items on the card, ninety-five were identical\r\nto previous UFO reports that ducks were flying over a city at night\r\nreflecting the city's lights.\r\n\r\nOn the way home from the meeting Colonel Kirkland and I were both\r\nwell satisfied with the assistance we believed Project Bear could\r\ngive to Project Grudge.\r\n\r\nIn a few days I again left ATIC, this time for Air Defense Command\r\nHeadquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I wanted to find out how\r\nwilling ADC was to help us and what they could do. When I arrived I\r\ngot a thorough briefing on the operations of ADC and the promise that\r\nthey would do anything they could to help solve the UFO riddle.\r\n\r\nAll of this co-operation was something that I hadn't expected. I'd\r\nbeen warned by the people who had worked on Project Sign and the old\r\nProject Grudge that everybody hated the word UFO--I'd have to fight\r\nfor everything I asked for. But once again they were wrong. The\r\nscientists who visited ATIC, General Samford, Project Bear, and now\r\nAir Defense Command couldn't have been more co-operative. I was\r\nbecoming aware that there was much wider concern about UFO reports\r\nthan I'd ever realized before.\r\n\r\nWhile I traveled around the United States getting the project set\r\nup, UFO reports continued to come in and all of them were good. One\r\nseries of reports was especially good, and they came from a group of\r\npeople who had had a great deal of experience watching things in the\r\nsky--the people who launch the big skyhook balloons for General\r\nMills, Inc. The reports of what the General Mills people had seen\r\nwhile they were tracking their balloons covered a period of over a\r\nyear. They had just sent them in because they had heard that Project\r\nGrudge was being reorganized and was taking a different view on UFO\r\nreports. They, like so many other reliable observers, had been\r\ndisgusted with the previous Air Force attitude toward UFO reports,\r\nand they had refused to send in any reports. I decided that these\r\npeople might be a good source of information, and I wanted to get\r\nfurther details on their reports, so I got orders to go to\r\nMinneapolis. A scientist from Project Bear went with me. We arrived\r\non January 14, 1952, in the middle of a cold wave and a blizzard.\r\n\r\nThe Aeronautical Division of General Mills, Inc., of Wheaties and\r\nBetty Crocker fame, had launched and tracked every skyhook balloon\r\nthat had been launched prior to mid-1952. They knew what their\r\nballoons looked like under all lighting conditions and they also knew\r\nmeteorology, aerodynamics, astronomy, and they knew UFO's. I talked\r\nto these people for the better part of a full day, and every time I\r\ntried to infer that there might be some natural explanation for the\r\nUFO's I just about found myself in a fresh snowdrift.\r\n\r\nWhat made these people so sure that UFO's existed? In the first\r\nplace, they had seen many of them. One man told me that one tracking\r\ncrew had seen so many that the sight of a UFO no longer even\r\nespecially interested them. And the things that they saw couldn't be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nFor example: On January 16, 1951, two people from General Mills and\r\nfour people from Artesia, New Mexico, were watching a skyhook balloon\r\nfrom the Artesia airport. They had been watching the balloon off and\r\non for about an hour when one of the group saw two tiny specks on the\r\nhorizon, off to the northwest. He pointed them out to the others\r\nbecause two airplanes were expected into the airport, and he thought\r\nthat these might be the airplanes. But as they watched, the two\r\nspecks began to move in fast, and within a few seconds the observers\r\ncould see that \"the airplanes\" were actually two round, dull white\r\nobjects flying in close formation. The two objects continued to come\r\nin and headed straight toward the balloon. When they reached the\r\nballoon they circled it once and flew off to the northwest, where\r\nthey disappeared over the horizon. As the two UFO's circled the\r\nballoon, they tipped on edge and the observers saw that they were\r\ndisk-shaped.\r\n\r\nWhen the two UFO's were near the balloon, the observers also had a\r\nchance to compare the size of the UFO's with the size of the balloon.\r\nIf the UFO's were as close to the balloon as they appeared to be they\r\nwould have been 60 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nAfter my visit to General Mills, Inc., I couldn't help remembering a\r\nmagazine article I'd read about a year before. It said that there was\r\nnot a single reliable UFO report that couldn't be attributed to a\r\nskyhook balloon.\r\n\r\nI'd been back at ATIC only a few days when I found myself packing up\r\nto leave again. This time it was for New York. A high-priority wire\r\nhad come into ATIC describing how a Navy pilot had chased a UFO over\r\nMitchel AFB, on Long Island. It was a good report.\r\n\r\nI remember the trip to New York because my train passed through\r\nElizabeth, New Jersey, early in the morning, and I could see the\r\nfires caused by an American Airlines Convair that had crashed. This\r\nwas the second of the three tragic Elizabeth, New Jersey, crashes.\r\n\r\nThe morning before, on January 21, a Navy pilot had taken off from\r\nMitchel in a TBM. He was a lieutenant commander, had flown in World\r\nWar II, and was now an engineer at the Navy Special Devices Center on\r\nLong Island. At nine-fifty he had cleared the traffic pattern and was\r\nat about 2,500 feet, circling around the airfield. He was southeast\r\nof the field when he first noticed an object below him and \"about\r\nthree runway lengths off the end of Runway 30.\" The object looked\r\nlike the top of a parachute canopy, he told me; it was white and he\r\nthought he could see the wedges or panels. He said that he thought\r\nthat it was moving across the ground a little bit too fast to be\r\ndrifting with wind, but he was sure that somebody had bailed out and\r\nthat he was looking at the top of his parachute. He was just ready to\r\ncall the tower when he suddenly realized that this \"parachute\" was\r\ndrifting across the wind. He had just taken off from Runway 30 and\r\nknew which direction the wind was blowing.\r\n\r\nAs he watched, the object, whatever it was (by now he no longer\r\nthought that it was a parachute), began to gradually climb, so he\r\nstarted to climb, he said, staying above and off to the right of the\r\nobject. When the UFO started to make a left turn, he followed and\r\ntried to cut inside, but he overshot and passed over it. It continued\r\nto turn and gain speed, so he dropped the nose of the TBM, put on\r\nmore power, and pulled in behind the object, which was now level with\r\nhim. In a matter of seconds the UFO made a 180-degree turn and\r\nstarted to make a big swing around the northern edge of Mitchel AFB.\r\nThe pilot tried to follow, but the UFO had begun to accelerate\r\nrapidly, and since a TBM leaves much to be desired on the speed end,\r\nhe was getting farther and farther behind. But he did try to follow\r\nit as long as he could. As he made a wide turn around the northern\r\nedge of the airfield he saw that the UFO was now turning south. He\r\nracked the TBM up into a tight left turn to follow, but in a few\r\nseconds the UFO had disappeared. When he last saw it, it had crossed\r\nthe Long Island coast line near Freeport and it was heading out to sea.\r\n\r\nWhen he finished his account of the chase, I asked the commander\r\nsome specific questions about the UFO. He said that just after he'd\r\ndecided that the UFO was not a parachute it appeared to be at an\r\naltitude of about 200 to 300 feet over a residential section. From\r\nthe time it took it to cover a city block, he'd estimated that it was\r\ntraveling about 300 miles an hour. Even when he pulled in behind the\r\nobject and got a good look, it still looked like a parachute canopy--\r\ndome-shaped--white--and it had a dark undersurface. It had been in\r\nsight two and a half minutes.\r\n\r\nHe had called the control tower at Mitchel during the chase, he told\r\nme, but only to ask if any balloons had been launched. He thought\r\nthat he might be seeing a balloon. The tower had told him that there\r\nwas a balloon in the area.\r\n\r\nThen the commander took out an aeronautical chart and drew in his\r\nflight path and the apparent path of the UFO for me. I think that he\r\ndrew it accurately because he had been continually watching landmarks\r\nas he'd chased the UFO and was very careful as he drew the sketches\r\non the map.\r\n\r\nI checked with the weather detachment at Mitchel and they said that\r\nthey had released a balloon. They had released it at nine-fifty and\r\nfrom a point southeast of the airfield. I got a plot of its path.\r\nJust as in the Long Beach Incident, where the six F-86's tried to\r\nintercept the UFO, the balloon was almost exactly in line with the\r\nspot where the UFO was first seen, but then any proof you might\r\nattempt falls apart. If the pilot knew where he was, and had plotted\r\nhis flight path even semi-accurately, he was never over the balloon.\r\nYet he was over the UFO. He came within less than 2,000 feet of the\r\nUFO when he passed over it; yet he couldn't recognize it as a balloon\r\neven though he thought it might be a balloon since the tower had just\r\ntold him that there was one in the area. He said that he followed the\r\nUFO around the north edge of the airfield. Yet the balloon, after it\r\nwas launched southeast of the field, continued on a southeast course\r\nand never passed north of the airfield.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest argument against the object's being a balloon was\r\nthe fact that the pilot pulled in behind it; it was directly off the\r\nnose of his airplane, and although he followed it for more than a\r\nminute, it pulled away from him. Once you line up an airplane on a\r\nballoon and go straight toward it you will catch it in a matter of\r\nseconds, even in the slowest airplane. There have been dogfights with\r\nUFO's where the UFO's turned out to be balloons, but the pilots\r\nalways reported that the UFO \"made a pass\" at them. In other words,\r\nthey rapidly caught up with the balloon and passed it. I questioned\r\nthis pilot over and over on this one point, and he was positive that\r\nhe had followed directly behind the UFO for over a minute and all the\r\ntime it was pulling away from him.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most typical UFO reports we had in our files. It\r\nis typical because no matter how you argue there isn't any definite\r\nanswer. If you want to argue that the pilot didn't know where he was\r\nduring the chase--that he was 3 or 4 miles from where he thought he\r\nwas--that he never did fly around the northern edge of the field and\r\nget in behind the UFO--then the UFO could have been a balloon.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to believe that the pilot knew where he was all\r\nduring the chase, and he did have several thousand hours of flying\r\ntime, then all you can conclude is that the UFO was an unknown.\r\n\r\nI think the pilot summed up the situation very aptly when he told me, \"I\r\ndon't know what it was, but I've never seen anything like it before or\r\nsince--maybe it was a spaceship.\"\r\n\r\nI went back to Dayton stumped--maybe it was a spaceship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN\r\n\r\nProject Blue Book and the Big Build-Up\r\n\r\nJust twenty minutes after midnight on January 22, 1952, nineteen and\r\na half hours after the Navy lieutenant commander had chased the UFO\r\nnear Mitchel AFB, another incident involving an airplane and\r\nsomething unknown was developing in Alaska. In contrast with the\r\nunusually balmy weather in New York, the temperature in Alaska that\r\nnight, according to the detailed account of the incident we received\r\nat ATIC, was a miserable 47 degrees below zero. The action was\r\nunfolding at one of our northernmost radar outposts in Alaska. This\r\noutpost was similar to those you may have seen in pictures, a\r\ncollection of low, sprawling buildings grouped around the observatory-\r\n-like domes that house the antennae of the most modern radar in the\r\nworld. The entire collection of buildings and domes are one color,\r\nsolid white, from the plastering of ice and snow. The picture that\r\nthe outpost makes could be described as fascinating, something out of\r\na Walt Disney fantasy--but talk to somebody who's been there--it's\r\nmiserable.\r\n\r\nAt 0020, twenty minutes after midnight, an airman watching one of\r\nthe outpost's radarscopes saw a target appear. It looked like an\r\nairplane because it showed up as a bright, distinct spot. But it was\r\nunusual because it was northeast of the radar site, and very few\r\nairplanes ever flew over this area. Off to the northeast of the\r\nstation there was nothing but ice, snow, and maybe a few Eskimos\r\nuntil you got to Russia. Occasionally a B-50 weather reconnaissance\r\nplane ventured into the area, but a quick check of the records showed\r\nthat none was there on this night.\r\n\r\nBy the time the radar crew had gotten three good plots of the\r\ntarget, they all knew that it was something unusual--it was at 23,000\r\nfeet and traveling 1,500 miles an hour. The duty controller, an Air\r\nForce captain, was quickly called; he made a fast check of the\r\ntargets that had now been put on the plotting board and called to a\r\njet fighter-interceptor base for a scramble.\r\n\r\nThe fighter base, located about 100 miles south of the radar site,\r\nacknowledged the captain's call and in a matter of minutes an F-94\r\njet was climbing out toward the north.\r\n\r\nWhile the F-94 was heading north, the radar crew at the outpost\r\nwatched the unidentified target. The bright dots that marked its path\r\nhad moved straight across the radarscope, passing within about 50\r\nmiles of the site. It was still traveling about 1,500 miles an hour.\r\nThe radar had also picked up the F-94 and was directing it toward its\r\ntarget when suddenly the unidentified target slowed down, stopped,\r\nand reversed its course. Now it was heading directly toward the radar\r\nstation. When it was within about 30 miles of the station, the radar\r\noperator switched his set to a shorter range and lost both the F-94\r\nand the unidentified target.\r\n\r\nWhile the radar operator was trying to pick up the target again, the\r\nF-94 arrived in the area. The ground controller told the pilot that\r\nthey had lost the target and asked him to cruise around the area to\r\nsee if he and his radar operator could pick up anything on the F-94's\r\nradar. The pilot said he would but that he was having a little\r\ndifficulty, was low on fuel, and would have to get back to his base\r\nsoon. The ground controller acknowledged the pilot's message, and\r\ncalled back to the air base telling them to scramble a second F-94.\r\n\r\nThe first F-94 continued to search the area while the ground radar\r\ntried to pick up the target but neither could find it.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the second F-94 was coming in, so the ground radar\r\nswitched back to long range. In a minute they had both of the F-94's\r\nand the unidentified target on their scope. The ground controller\r\ncalled the second F-94 and began to vector him into the target.\r\n\r\nThe first F-94 returned to its base.\r\n\r\nAs both the second F-94 and the target approached the radar site,\r\nthe operator again switched to short range and again he lost the jet\r\nand the target. He switched back to long range, but by now they were\r\ntoo close to the radar site and he couldn't pick up either one.\r\n\r\nThe pilot continued on toward where the unidentified target should\r\nhave been. Suddenly the F-94 radar operator reported a weak target\r\noff to the right at 28,000 feet. They climbed into it but it faded\r\nbefore they could make contact.\r\n\r\nThe pilot swung the F-94 around for another pass, and this time the\r\nradar operator reported a strong return. As they closed in, the F-\r\n94's radar showed that the target was now almost stationary, just\r\nbarely moving. The F-94 continued on, but the target seemed to make a\r\nsudden dive and they lost it. The pilot of the jet interceptor\r\ncontinued to search the area but couldn't find anything. As the F-94\r\nmoved away from the radar station, it was again picked up on the\r\nground radar, but the unidentified target was gone.\r\n\r\nA third F-94 had been scrambled, and in the meantime its crew took\r\nover the search. They flew around for about ten minutes without\r\ndetecting any targets on their radar. They were making one last pass\r\nalmost directly over the radar station when the radar operator in the\r\nback seat of the F-94 yelled over the interphone that he had a target\r\non his scope. The pilot called ground radar, but by this time both\r\nthe F-94 and the unidentified target were again too close to the\r\nradar station and they couldn't be picked up. The F-94 closed in\r\nuntil it was within 200 yards of the target; then the pilot pulled\r\nup, afraid he might collide with whatever was out in the night sky\r\nahead of him. He made another pass, and another, but each time the\r\nbright spot on the radar operator's scope just stayed in one spot as\r\nif something were defiantly sitting out in front of the F-94 daring\r\nthe pilot to close in. The pilot didn't take the dare. On each pass\r\nhe broke off at 200 yards.\r\n\r\nThe F-94 crew made a fourth pass and got a weak return, but it was\r\nsoon lost as the target seemed to speed away. Ground radar also got a\r\nbrief return, but in a matter of seconds they too lost the target as\r\nit streaked out of range on a westerly heading.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the first thing I did when I read this report was to check\r\nthe weather. But there was no weather report for this area that was\r\ndetailed enough to tell whether a weather inversion could have caused\r\nthe radar targets.\r\n\r\nBut I took the report over to Captain Roy James, anyway, in hopes\r\nthat he might be able to find a clue that would identify the UFO.\r\n\r\nCaptain James was the chief of the radar section at ATIC. He and his\r\npeople analyzed all our reports where radar picked up UFO's. Roy had\r\nbeen familiar with radar for many years, having set up one of the\r\nfirst stations in Florida during World War II, and later he took the\r\nfirst aircraft control and warning squadron to Saipan. Besides\r\nworrying about keeping his radar operating, he had to worry about the\r\nJaps' shooting holes in his antennae.\r\n\r\nCaptain James decided that this Alaskan sighting I'd just shown him\r\nwas caused by some kind of freak weather. He based his analysis on\r\nthe fact that the unknown target had disappeared each time the ground\r\nradar had been switched to short range. This, he pointed out, is an\r\nindication that the radar was picking up some kind of a target that\r\nwas caused by weather. The same weather that caused the ground radar\r\nto act up must have caused false targets on the F-94's radar too, he\r\ncontinued. After all, they had closed to within 200 yards of what\r\nthey were supposedly picking up; it was a clear moonlight night, yet\r\nthe crews of the F-94's hadn't seen a thing.\r\n\r\nTaking a clue from the law profession, he quoted a precedent. About\r\na year before over Oak Ridge, Tennessee, an F-82 interceptor had\r\nnearly flown into the ground three times as the pilot attempted to\r\nfollow a target that his radar operator was picking up. There was a\r\nstrong inversion that night, and although the target appeared as if\r\nit were flying in the air, it was actually a ground target.\r\n\r\nSince Captain James was the chief of the radar section and he had\r\nsaid \"Weather,\" weather was the official conclusion on the report.\r\nBut reports of UFO's' being picked up on radar are controversial, and\r\nsome of the people didn't agree with James's conclusion.\r\n\r\nA month or two after we'd received the report, I was out in Colorado\r\nSprings at Air Defense Command Headquarters. I was eating lunch in\r\nthe officers' club when I saw an officer from the radar operations\r\nsection at ADC. He asked me to stop by his office when I had a spare\r\nminute, and I said that I would. He said that it was important.\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of the afternoon before I saw him and found out\r\nwhat he wanted. He had been in Alaska on TDY when the UFO had been\r\npicked up at the outpost radar site. In fact, he had made a trip to\r\nboth the radar site and the interceptor base just two days after the\r\nsighting, and he had talked about the sighting with the people who\r\nhad seen the UFO on the radar. He wanted to know what we thought\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nWhen I told him that the sighting had been written off as weather, I\r\nremember that he got a funny look on his face and said, \"Weather!\r\nWhat are you guys trying to pull, anyway?\"\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that he didn't agree with our conclusion. I was\r\ninterested in learning what this man thought because I knew that he\r\nwas one of ADC's ace radar trouble shooters and that he traveled all\r\nover the world, on loan from ADC, to work out problems with radars.\r\n\r\n\"From the description of what the targets looked like on the\r\nradarscopes, good, strong, bright images, I can't believe that they\r\nwere caused by weather,\" he told me.\r\n\r\nThen he went on to back up his argument by pointing out that when\r\nthe ground radar was switched to short range both the F-94 and the\r\nunknown target disappeared. If just the unknown target had\r\ndisappeared, then it could have been weather. But since both\r\ndisappeared, very probably the radar set wasn't working on short\r\nranges for some reason. Next he pointed out that if there was a\r\ntemperature inversion, which is highly unlikely in northern Alaska,\r\nthe same inversion that would affect the ground radar wouldn't be\r\npresent at 25,000 feet or above.\r\n\r\nI told him about the report from Oak Ridge that Captain James had\r\nused as an example, but he didn't buy this comparison. At Oak Ridge,\r\nhe pointed out, that F-82 was at only 4,000 feet. He didn't know how\r\nthe F-94's could get to within 200 yards of an object without seeing\r\nit, unless the object was painted a dull black.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"I can't believe that those radar targets were caused\r\nby weather. I'd be much more inclined to believe that they were\r\nsomething real, something that we just don't know about.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the early spring of 1952 reports of radar sightings increased\r\nrapidly. Most of them came from the Air Defense Command, but a few\r\ncame from other agencies. One day, soon after the Alaskan Incident, I\r\ngot a telephone call from the chief of one of the sections of a\r\ncivilian experimental radar laboratory in New York State. The people\r\nin this lab were working on the development of the latest types of\r\nradar. Several times recently, while testing radars, they had\r\ndetected unidentified targets. To quote my caller, \"Some damn odd\r\nthings are happening that are beginning to worry me.\" He went on to\r\ntell how the people in his lab had checked their radars, the weather,\r\nand everything else they could think of, but they could find\r\nabsolutely nothing to account for the targets; they could only\r\nconclude that they were real. I promised him that his information\r\nwould get to the right people if he'd put it in a letter and send it\r\nto ATIC. In about a week the letter arrived--hand-carried by no less\r\nthan a general. The general, who was from Headquarters, Air Materiel\r\nCommand, had been in New York at the radar laboratory, and he had\r\nheard about the UFO reports. He had personally checked into them\r\nbecause he knew that the people at the lab were some of the sharpest\r\nradar engineers in the world. When he found out that these people had\r\nalready contacted us and had prepared a report for us, he offered to\r\nhand-carry it to Wright-Patterson.\r\n\r\nI can't divulge how high these targets were flying or how fast they\r\nwere going because it would give an indication of the performance of\r\nour latest radar, which is classified Secret. I can say, however,\r\nthat they were flying mighty high and mighty fast.\r\n\r\nI turned the letter over to ATIC's electronics branch, and they\r\npromised to take immediate action. They did, and really fouled it up.\r\nThe person who received the report in the electronics branch was one\r\nof the old veterans of Projects Sign and Grudge. He knew all about\r\nUFO's. He got on the phone, called the radar lab, and told the chief\r\n(a man who possibly wrote all of the textbooks this person had used\r\nin college) all about how a weather inversion can cause false targets\r\non weather. He was gracious enough to tell the chief of the radar lab\r\nto call if he had any more \"trouble.\"\r\n\r\nWe never heard from them again. Maybe they found out what their\r\ntargets were. Or maybe they joined ranks with the airline pilot who\r\ntold me that if a flying saucer flew wing tip to wing tip formation\r\nwith him, he'd never tell the Air Force.\r\n\r\nIn early February I made another trip to Air Defense Command\r\nHeadquarters in Colorado Springs. This time it was to present a\r\ndefinite plan of how ADC could assist ATIC in getting better data on\r\nUFO's. I briefed General Benjamin W. Chidlaw, then the Commanding\r\nGeneral of the Air Defense Command, and his staff, telling them about\r\nour plan. They agreed with it in principle and suggested that I work\r\nout the details with the Director of Intelligence for ADC, Brigadier\r\nGeneral W. M. Burgess. General Burgess designated Major Verne\r\nSadowski of his staff to be the ADC liaison officer with Project\r\nGrudge.\r\n\r\nThis briefing started a long period of close co-operation between\r\nProject Grudge and ADC, and it was a pleasure to work with these\r\npeople. In all of my travels around the government, visiting and\r\nconferring with dozens of agencies, I never had the pleasure of\r\nworking with or seeing a more smoothly operating and efficient\r\norganization than the Air Defense Command. General Chidlaw and\r\nGeneral Burgess, along with the rest of the staff at ADC, were truly\r\ngreat officers. None of them were believers in flying saucers, but\r\nthey recognized the fact that UFO reports were a problem that must be\r\nconsidered. With technological progress what it is today, you can't\r\nafford to have _anything_ in the air that you can't identify, be it\r\nballoons, meteors, planets or flying saucers.\r\n\r\nThe plan that ADC agreed to was very simple. They agreed to issue a\r\ndirective to all of their units explaining the UFO situation and\r\ntelling specifically what to do in case one was detected. All radar\r\nunits equipped with radarscope cameras would be required to take\r\nscope photos of targets that fell into the UFO category--targets that\r\nwere not airplanes or known weather phenomena. These photos, along\r\nwith a completed technical questionnaire that would be made up at\r\nATIC by Captain Roy James, would be forwarded to Project Grudge.\r\n\r\nThe Air Defense Command UFO directive would also clarify the\r\nscrambling of fighters to intercept a UFO. Since it is the policy of\r\nthe Air Defense Command to establish the identity of any unidentified\r\ntarget, there were no _special_ orders issued for scrambling fighters\r\nto try to identify reported UFO's. A UFO was something unknown and\r\nautomatically called for a scramble. However, there had been some\r\nhesitancy on the part of controllers to send airplanes up whenever\r\nradar picked up a target that obviously was not an airplane. The\r\ndirective merely pointed out to the controllers that it was within\r\nthe scope of existing regulations to scramble on radar targets that\r\nwere plotted as traveling too fast or too slow to be conventional\r\nairplanes. The decision to scramble fighters was still up to the\r\nindividual controller, however, and scrambling on UFO's would be a\r\nsecond or third priority.\r\n\r\nThe Air Defense Command UFO directive did not mention shooting at a\r\nUFO. This question came up during our planning meeting at Colorado\r\nSprings, but, like the authority to scramble, the authority to shoot\r\nat anything in the air had been established long ago. Every ADC pilot\r\nknows the rules for engagement, the rules that tell him when he can\r\nshoot the loaded guns that he always carries. If anything in the air\r\nover the United States commits any act that is covered by the rules\r\nfor engagement, the pilot has the authority to open fire.\r\n\r\nThe third thing that ADC would do would be to integrate the Ground\r\nObserver Corps into the UFO reporting net. As a second priority, the\r\nGOC would report UFO's--first priority would still be reporting\r\naircraft.\r\n\r\nEver since the new Project Grudge had been organized, we hadn't had\r\nto deal with any large-scale publicity about UFO's. Occasionally\r\nsomeone would bring in a local item from some newspaper about a UFO\r\nsighting, but the sightings never rated more than an inch or two\r\ncolumn space. But on February 19, 1952, the calm was broken by the\r\nstory of how a huge ball of fire paced two B-29's in Korea. The story\r\ndidn't start a rash of reports as the story of the first UFO sighting\r\ndid in June 1947, but it was significant in that it started a slow\r\nbuild-up of publicity that was far to surpass anything in the past.\r\n\r\nThis Korean sighting also added to the growing official interest in\r\nWashington. Almost every day I was getting one or two telephone calls\r\nfrom some branch of the government, and I was going to Washington at\r\nleast once every two weeks. I was beginning to spend as much time\r\ntelling people what was going on as I was doing anything about it.\r\nThe answer was to get somebody in the Directorate of Intelligence in\r\nthe Pentagon to act as a liaison officer. I could keep this person\r\ninformed and he could handle the \"branch office\" in Washington.\r\nColonel Dunn bought this idea, and Major Dewey J. Fournet got the\r\nadditional duty of manager of the Pentagon branch. In the future all\r\nPentagon inquiries went to Major Fournet, and if he couldn't answer\r\nthem he would call me. The arrangement was excellent because Major\r\nFournet took a very serious interest in UFO's and could always be\r\ncounted on to do a good job.\r\n\r\nSometime in February 1952 I had a visit from two Royal Canadian Air\r\nForce officers. For some time, I learned, Canada had been getting her\r\nshare of UFO reports. One of the latest ones, and the one that\r\nprompted the visit by the RCAF officers, occurred at North Bay,\r\nOntario, about 250 miles north of Buffalo, New York. On two occasions\r\nan orange-red disk had been seen from a new jet fighter base in the\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe Canadians wanted to know how we operated. I gave them the\r\ndetails of how we were currently operating and how we hoped to\r\noperate in the future, as soon as the procedures that were now in the\r\nplanning stages could be put into operation. We agreed to try to set\r\nup channels so that we could exchange information and tie in the\r\nproject they planned to establish with Project Grudge.\r\n\r\nOur plans for continuing liaison didn't materialize, but through\r\nother RCAF intelligence officers I found out that their plans for an\r\nRCAF-sponsored project failed. A quasi-official UFO project was set\r\nup soon after this, however, and its objective was to use instruments\r\nto detect objects coming into the earth's atmosphere. In 1954 the\r\nproject was closed down because during the two years of operation\r\nthey hadn't officially detected any UFO's. My sources of information\r\nstressed the word \"officially.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the time that I was chief of the UFO project, the visitors\r\nwho passed through my office closely resembled the international\r\nbrigade. Most of the visits were unofficial in the sense that the\r\nofficers came to ATIC on other business, but in many instances the\r\nother business was just an excuse to come out to Dayton to get filled\r\nin on the UFO story. Two RAF intelligence officers who were in the\r\nU.S. on a classified mission brought six single-spaced typed pages of\r\nquestions they and their friends wanted answered. On many occasions\r\nAir Force intelligence officers who were stationed in England,\r\nFrance, and Germany, and who returned to the U.S. on business, took\r\nback stacks of unclassified flying saucer stories. One civilian\r\nintelligence agent who frequently traveled between the U.S. and\r\nEurope also acted as the unofficial courier for a German group--\r\ntransporting hot newspaper and magazine articles about UFO's that I'd\r\ncollected. In return I received the latest information on European\r\nsightings--sightings that never were released and that we never\r\nreceived at ATIC through official channels.\r\n\r\nEver since the fateful day when Lieutenant Jerry Cummings dropped\r\nhis horn-rimmed glasses down on his nose, tipped his head forward,\r\npeered at Major General Cabell over his glasses and, acting not at\r\nall like a first lieutenant, said that the UFO investigation was all\r\nfouled up, Project Grudge had been gaining prestige. Lieutenant\r\nColonel Rosengarten's promise that I'd be on the project for only a\r\nfew months went the way of all military promises. By March 1952,\r\nProject Grudge was no longer just a project within a group; we had\r\nbecome a separate organization, with the formal title of the Aerial\r\nPhenomena Group. Soon after this step-up in the chain of command the\r\nproject code name was changed to Blue Book. The word \"Grudge\" was no\r\nlonger applicable. For those people who like to try to read a hidden\r\nmeaning into a name, I'll say that the code name Blue Book was\r\nderived from the title given to college tests. Both the tests and the\r\nproject had an abundance of equally confusing questions.\r\n\r\nProject Blue Book had been made a separate group because of the\r\nsteadily increasing number of reports we were receiving. The average\r\nhad jumped from about ten a month to twenty a month since December\r\n1951. In March of 1952 the reports slacked off a little, but April\r\nwas a big month. In April we received ninety-nine reports.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, Colonel S. H. Kirkland and I went to Los Angeles on\r\nbusiness. Before we left ATIC we had made arrangements to attend a\r\nmeeting of the Civilian Saucer Investigators, a now defunct\r\norganization that was very active in 1952.\r\n\r\nThey turned out to be a well-meaning but Don Quixote-type group of\r\nindividuals. As soon as they outlined their plans for attempting to\r\nsolve the UFO riddle, it was obvious that they would fail. Project\r\nBlue Book had the entire Air Force, money, and enthusiasm behind it\r\nand we weren't getting any answers yet. All this group had was the\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the evening wasn't the Civilian Saucer\r\nInvestigators, however; it was getting a chance to read Ginna's UFO\r\narticle in an advance copy of _Life_ magazine that the organization\r\nhad obtained--the article written from the material Bob Ginna had\r\nbeen researching for over a year. Colonel Kirkwood took one long look\r\nat the article, sidled up to me, and said, \"We'd better get back to\r\nDayton quick; you're going to be busy.\" The next morning at dawn I\r\nwas sound asleep on a United Airlines DC-6, Dayton-bound.\r\n\r\nThe _Life_ article undoubtedly threw a harder punch at the American\r\npublic than any other UFO article ever written. The title alone,\r\n\"Have We Visitors from Outer Space?\" was enough. Other very reputable\r\nmagazines, such as True, had said it before, but coming from _Life_,\r\nit was different. _Life_ didn't say that the UFO's were from outer\r\nspace; it just said maybe. But to back up this \"maybe,\" it had quotes\r\nfrom some famous people. Dr. Walther Riedel, who played an important\r\npart in the development of the German V-2 missile and is presently\r\nthe director of rocket engine research for North American Aviation\r\nCorporation, said he believed that the UFO's were from outer space.\r\nDr. Maurice Biot, one of the world's leading aerodynamicists, backed\r\nhim up.\r\n\r\nBut the most important thing about the _Life_ article was the\r\nquestion in the minds of so many readers: \"Why was it written?\"\r\n_Life_ doesn't go blasting off on flights of space fancy without a\r\ngood reason. Some of the readers saw a clue in the author's comments\r\nthat the hierarchy of the Air Force was now taking a serious look at\r\nUFO reports. \"Did the Air Force prompt _Life_ to write the article?\"\r\nwas the question that many people asked themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Dayton, newspapermen were beating down the door.\r\nThe official answer to the _Life_ article was released through the\r\nOffice of Public Information in the Pentagon: \"The article is\r\nfactual, but _Life's_ conclusions are their own.\" In answer to any\r\nquestions about the article's being Air Force-inspired, my weasel-\r\nworded answer was that we had furnished _Life_ with some raw data on\r\nspecific sightings.\r\n\r\nMy answer was purposely weasel-worded because I knew that the Air\r\nForce had unofficially inspired the _Life_ article. The \"maybe\r\nthey're interplanetary\" with the \"maybe\" bordering on \"they are\" was\r\nthe personal opinion of several very high-ranking officers in the\r\nPentagon--so high that their personal opinion was almost policy. I\r\nknew the men and I knew that one of them, a general, had passed his\r\nopinions on to Bob Ginna.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the _Life_ article did not cause a flood of reports.\r\nThe day after the article appeared we got nine sightings, which was\r\nunusual, but the next day they dropped off again.\r\n\r\nThe number of reports did take a sharp rise a few days later,\r\nhowever. The cause was the distribution of an order that completed\r\nthe transformation of the UFO from a bastard son to the family heir.\r\nThe piece of paper that made Project Blue Book legitimate was Air\r\nForce Letter 200-5, Subject: Unidentified Flying Objects. The letter,\r\nwhich was duly signed and sealed by the Secretary of the Air Force,\r\nin essence stated that UFO's were not a joke, that the Air Force was\r\nmaking a serious study of the problem, and that Project Blue Book was\r\nresponsible for the study. The letter stated that the commander of\r\nevery Air Force installation was responsible for forwarding all UFO\r\nreports to ATIC by wire, with a copy to the Pentagon. Then a more\r\ndetailed report would be sent by airmail. Most important of all, it\r\ngave Project Blue Book the authority to directly contact any Air\r\nForce unit in the United States without going through any chain of\r\ncommand. This was almost unheard of in the Air Force and gave our\r\nproject a lot of prestige.\r\n\r\nThe new reporting procedures established by the Air Force letter\r\ngreatly aided our investigation because it allowed us to start\r\ninvestigating the better reports before they cooled off. But it also\r\nhad its disadvantages. It authorized the sender to use whatever\r\npriority he thought the message warranted. Some things are slow in\r\nthe military, but a priority message is not one of them. When it\r\ncomes into the message center, it is delivered to the addressee\r\nimmediately, and for some reason, all messages reporting UFO's seemed\r\nto arrive between midnight and 4:00A.M. I was considered the\r\naddressee on all UFO reports. To complicate matters, the messages\r\nwere usually classified and I would have to go out to the air base\r\nand personally sign for them.\r\n\r\nOne such message came in about 4:30A.M. on May 8, 1952. It was from\r\na CAA radio station in Jacksonville, Florida, and had been forwarded\r\nover the Flight Service teletype net. I received the usual telephone\r\ncall from the teletype room at Wright-Patterson, I think I got\r\ndressed, and I went out and picked up the message. As I signed for it\r\nI remember the night man in the teletype room said, \"This is a lulu,\r\nCaptain.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a lulu. About one o'clock that morning a Pan-American\r\nairlines DC-4 was flying south toward Puerto Rico. A few hours after\r\nit had left New York City it was out over the Atlantic Ocean, about\r\n600 miles off Jacksonville, Florida, flying at 8,000 feet. It was a\r\npitch-black night; a high overcast even cut out the glow from the\r\nstars. The pilot and copilot were awake but really weren't\r\nconcentrating on looking for other aircraft because they had just\r\npassed into the San Juan Oceanic Control Area and they had been\r\nadvised by radio that there were no other airplanes in the area. The\r\ncopilot was turning around to look at number four engine when he\r\nnoticed a light up ahead. It looked like the taillight of another\r\nairplane. He watched it closely for a few seconds since no other\r\nairplanes were supposed to be in the area. He glanced out at number\r\nfour engine for a few seconds, looked back, and he saw that the light\r\nwas in about the same position as when he'd first seen it. Then he\r\nlooked down at the prop controls, synchronized the engines, and\r\nlooked up again. In the few seconds that he had glanced away from the\r\nlight, it had moved to the right so that it was now directly ahead of\r\nthe DC-4, and it had increased in size. The copilot reached over and\r\nslapped the pilot on the shoulder and pointed. Just at that instant\r\nthe light began to get bigger and bigger until it was \"ten times the\r\nsize of a landing light of an airplane.\" It continued to close in and\r\nwith a flash it streaked by the DC-4's left wing. Before the crew\r\ncould react and say anything, two more smaller balls of fire flashed\r\nby. Both pilots later said that they sat in their seats for several\r\nseconds with sweat trickling down their backs.\r\n\r\nIt was one of these two pilots who later said, \"Were you ever\r\ntraveling along the highway about 70 miles an hour at night, have the\r\ncar that you were meeting suddenly swerve over into your lane and\r\nthen cut back so that you just miss it by inches? You know the sort\r\nof sick, empty feeling you get when it's all over? That's just the\r\nway we felt.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the crew recovered from the shock, the pilot picked up\r\nhis mike, called Jacksonville Radio, and told them about the\r\nincident. Minutes later we had the report. The next afternoon\r\nLieutenant Kerry Rothstien, who had replaced Lieutenant Metscher on\r\nthe project, was on his way to New York to meet the pilots when they\r\nreturned from Puerto Rico.\r\n\r\nWhen Kerry talked to the two pilots, they couldn't add a great deal\r\nto their original story. Their final comment was the one we all had\r\nheard so many times, \"I always thought these people who reported\r\nflying saucers were crazy, but now I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Lieutenant Rothstien returned to Dayton he triple-checked with\r\nthe CAA for aircraft in the area--but there were none. Could there\r\nhave been airplanes in the area that CAA didn't know about? The\r\nanswer was almost a flat \"No.\" No one would fly 600 miles off the\r\ncoast without filing a flight plan; if he got into trouble or went\r\ndown, the Coast Guard or Air Rescue Service would have no idea where\r\nto look.\r\n\r\nKerry was given the same negative answer when he checked on surface\r\nshipping.\r\n\r\nThe last possibility was that the UFO's were meteors, but several\r\npoints in the pilots' story ruled these out. First, there was a solid\r\novercast at about 18,000 feet. No meteor cruises along straight and\r\nlevel below 18,000 feet. Second, on only rare occasions have meteors\r\nbeen seen traveling three in trail. The chances of seeing such a\r\nphenomenon are well over one in a billion.\r\n\r\nSome people have guessed that some kind of an atmospheric phenomenon\r\ncan form a \"wall of air\" ahead of an airplane that will act as a\r\nmirror and that lights seen at night by pilots are nothing more than\r\nthe reflection of the airplane's own lights. This could be true in\r\nsome cases, but to have a reflection you must have a light to\r\nreflect. There are no lights on an airplane that even approach being\r\n\"ten times the size of a landing light.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was it? I know a colonel who says it was the same thing that\r\nthe two Eastern Airlines' pilots, Clarence Chiles and John Whitted,\r\nsaw near Montgomery, Alabama, on July 24, 1948, and he thinks that\r\nChiles and Whitted saw a spaceship.\r\n\r\nReports for the month of April set an all-time high. These were all\r\nreports that came from military installations. In addition, we\r\nreceived possibly two hundred letters reporting UFO's, but we were so\r\nbusy all we could do was file them for future reference.\r\n\r\nIn May 1952 I'd been out to George AFB in California investigating a\r\nseries of sightings and was on my way home. I remember the flight to\r\nDayton because the weather was bad all the way. I didn't want to miss\r\nmy connecting flight in Chicago, or get grounded, because I had\r\nfaithfully promised my wife that we would go out to dinner the night\r\nthat I returned to Dayton. I'd called her from Los Angeles to tell\r\nher that I was coming in, and she had found a baby sitter and had\r\ndinner reservations. I hadn't been home more than about two days a\r\nweek for the past three months, and she was looking forward to going\r\nout for the evening.\r\n\r\nI reached Dayton about midmorning and went right out to the base.\r\nWhen I arrived at the office, my secretary was gone but there was a\r\nbig note on my desk: \"Call Colonel Dunn as soon as you get in.\"\r\n\r\nI called Colonel Dunn; then I called my wife and told her to cancel\r\nthe baby sitter, cancel the dinner reservations, and pack my other\r\nbag. I had to go to Washington.\r\n\r\nWhile I'd been in California, Colonel Dunn had received a call from\r\nGeneral Samford's office. It seems that a few nights before, one of\r\nthe top people in the Central Intelligence Agency was having a lawn\r\nparty at his home just outside Alexandria, Virginia. A number of\r\nnotable personages were in attendance and they had seen a flying\r\nsaucer. The report had been passed down to Air Force intelligence,\r\nand due to the quality of the brass involved, it was \"suggested\" that\r\nI get to Washington on the double and talk to the host of the party.\r\nI was at his office before 5:00P.M. and got his report.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock in the evening he and two other people were\r\nstanding near the edge of his yard talking; he happened to be facing\r\nsouth, looking off across the countryside. He digressed a bit from\r\nhis story to explain that his home is on a hilltop in the country,\r\nand when looking south, he had a view of the entire countryside.\r\nWhile he was talking to the two other people he noticed a light\r\napproaching from the west. He had assumed it was an airplane and had\r\ncasually watched it, but when the light got fairly close, the CIA man\r\nsaid that he suddenly realized there wasn't any sound associated with\r\nit. If it were an airplane it would have been close enough for him to\r\nhear even above the hum of the guests' conversations. He had actually\r\nquit talking and was looking at the light when it stopped for an\r\ninstant and began to climb almost vertically. He said something to\r\nthe other guests, and they looked up just in time to see the light\r\nfinish its climb, stop, and level out. They all watched it travel\r\nlevel for a few seconds, then go into a nearly vertical dive, level\r\nout, and streak off to the east.\r\n\r\nMost everyone at the party had seen the light before it disappeared,\r\nand within minutes several friendly arguments as to what it was had\r\ndeveloped, I was told. One person thought it was a lighted balloon,\r\nand a retired general thought it was an airplane. To settle the\r\narguments, they had made a few telephone calls. I might add that\r\nthese people were such that the mention of their names on a telephone\r\ngot quick results. Radar in the Washington area said that there had\r\nbeen no airplanes flying west to east south of Alexandria in the past\r\nhour. The weather station at Bolling AFB said that there were no\r\nballoons in the area, but as a double check the weather people looked\r\nat their records of high-altitude winds. It couldn't have been a\r\nballoon because none of the winds up to 65,000 feet were blowing from\r\nwest to east--and to be able to see a light on a balloon, it has to\r\nbe well below 65,000 feet; the man from CIA told me that they had\r\neven considered the possibility that the UFO was a meteor and that\r\nthe \"jump\" had been due to some kind of an atmospheric distortion.\r\nBut the light had been in sight too long to be a meteor. He added\r\nthat an army chaplain and two teetotaler guests had also seen the\r\nlight jump.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't much left for me to do when I finished talking to the\r\nman. He and his guests had already made all of the checks that I'd\r\nhave made. All I could do was go back to Dayton, write up his report,\r\nand stamp it \"Unknown.\"\r\n\r\nBack in March, when it had become apparent that the press was\r\nreviving its interest in UFO's, I had suggested that Project Blue\r\nBook subscribe to a newspaper clipping service. Such a service could\r\nprovide several things. First, it would show us exactly how much\r\npublicity the UFO's were getting and what was being said, and it\r\nwould give us the feel of the situation. Then it would also provide a\r\nlot of data for our files. In many cases the newspapers got reports\r\nthat didn't go to the Air Force. Newspaper reporters rival any\r\nintelligence officer when it comes to digging up facts, and there was\r\nalways the possibility that they would uncover and print something\r\nwe'd missed. This was especially true in the few cases of hoaxes that\r\nalways accompany UFO publicity. Last, it would provide us with\r\nmaterial on which to base a study of the effect of newspaper\r\npublicity upon the number and type of UFO reports.\r\n\r\nColonel Dunn liked the idea of the clipping service, and it went\r\ninto effect soon after the first publicity had appeared. Every three\r\nor four days we would get an envelope full of clippings. In March the\r\nclipping service was sending the clippings to us in letter-sized\r\nenvelopes. The envelopes were thin--maybe there would be a dozen or\r\nso clippings in each one. Then they began to get thicker and thicker,\r\nuntil the people who were doing the clipping switched to using manila\r\nenvelopes. Then the manila envelopes began to get thicker and\r\nthicker. By May we were up to old shoe boxes. The majority of the\r\nnewspaper stories in the shoe boxes were based on material that had\r\ncome from ATIC.\r\n\r\nAll of these inquiries from the press were adding to Blue Book's\r\nwork load and to my problems. Normally a military unit such as ATIC\r\nhas its own public information officer, but we had none so I was it.\r\nI was being quoted quite freely in the press and was repeatedly being\r\nsnarled at by someone in the Pentagon. It was almost a daily\r\noccurrence to have people from the \"puzzle palace\" call and\r\nindignantly ask, \"Why did you tell them that?\" They usually referred\r\nto some bit of information that somebody didn't think should have\r\nbeen released. I finally gave up and complained to Colonel Dunn. I\r\nsuggested that any contacts with the press be made through the Office\r\nof Public Information in the Pentagon. These people were trained and\r\npaid to do this job; I wasn't. Colonel Dunn heartily agreed because\r\nevery time I got chewed out he at least got a dirty look.\r\n\r\nColonel Dunn called General Samford's office and they brought in\r\nGeneral Sory Smith of the Department of Defense, Office of Public\r\nInformation. General Smith appointed a civilian on the Air Force\r\nPress Desk, Al Chop, to handle all inquiries from the press. The plan\r\nwas that Al would try to get his answers from Major Dewey Fournet,\r\nBlue Book's liaison officer in the Pentagon, and if Dewey didn't have\r\nthe answer, Al had permission to call me.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement worked out fine because Al Chop had been through\r\nprevious UFO publicity battles when he was in the Office of Public\r\nInformation at Wright Field.\r\n\r\nThe interest in the UFO's that was shown by the press in May was\r\nsurpassed only by the interest of the Pentagon. Starting in May, I\r\ngave on the average of one briefing in Washington every two weeks,\r\nand there was always a full house. From the tone of the official\r\ncomments to the public about UFO's, it would indicate that there\r\nwasn't a great deal of interest, but nothing could be further from\r\nthe truth. People say a lot of things behind a door bearing a sign\r\nthat reads \"Secret Briefing in Progress.\"\r\n\r\nAfter one of the briefings a colonel (who is now a brigadier\r\ngeneral) presented a plan that called for using several flights of F-\r\n94C jet interceptors for the specific purpose of trying to get some\r\ngood photographs of UFO's. The flight that he proposed would be an\r\noperational unit with six aircraft--two would be on constant alert.\r\nThe F-94C's, then the hottest operational jet we had, would be\r\nstripped of all combat gear to give them peak performance, and they\r\nwould carry a special camera in the nose. The squadrons would be\r\nlocated at places in the United States where UFO's were most\r\nfrequently seen.\r\n\r\nThe plan progressed to the point of estimating how soon enough\r\nairplanes for two flights could be stripped, how soon special cameras\r\ncould be built, and whether or not two specific Air Force bases in\r\nthe U.S. could support the units.\r\n\r\nFinally the colonel's plan was shelved, but not because he was\r\nconsidered to be crazy. After considerable study and debate at high\r\ncommand level, it was decided that twelve F-94C's couldn't be spared\r\nfor the job and it would have been ineffective to use fewer airplanes.\r\n\r\nThe consideration that the colonel's plan received was an indication\r\nof how some of the military people felt about the importance of\r\nfinding out exactly what the UFO's really were. And in the\r\ndiscussions the words \"interplanetary craft\" came up more than once.\r\n\r\nRequests for briefings came even from the highest figure in the Air\r\nForce, Thomas K. Finletter, then the Secretary for Air. On May 8,\r\n1952, Lieutenant Colonel R. J. Taylor of Colonel Dunn's staff and I\r\npresented an hour-long briefing to Secretary Finletter and his staff.\r\nHe listened intently and asked several questions about specific\r\nsightings when the briefing was finished. If he was at all worried\r\nabout the UFO's he certainly didn't show it. His only comment was,\r\n\"You're doing a fine job, Captain. It must be interesting. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThen he made the following statement for the press:\r\n\r\n\"No concrete evidence has yet reached us either to prove or disprove\r\nthe existence of the so-called flying saucers. There remain, however,\r\na number of sightings that the Air Force investigators have been\r\nunable to explain. As long as this is true, the Air Force will\r\ncontinue to study flying saucer reports.\"\r\n\r\nIn May 1952, Project Blue Book received seventy-nine UFO reports\r\ncompared to ninety-nine in April. It looked as if we'd passed the\r\npeak and were now on the downhill side. The 178 reports of the past\r\ntwo months, not counting the thousand or so letters that we'd\r\nreceived directly from the public, had piled up a sizable backlog\r\nsince we'd had time to investigate and analyze only the better\r\nreports. During June we planned to clear out the backlog, and then we\r\ncould relax.\r\n\r\nBut never underestimate the power of a UFO. In June the big flap hit\r\n--they began to deliver clippings in big cardboard cartons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\r\n\r\nThe Big Flap\r\n\r\nIn early June 1952, Project Blue Book was operating according to the\r\noperational plan that had been set up in January 1952. It had taken\r\nsix months to put the plan into effect, and to a person who has never\r\nbeen indoctrinated into the ways of the military, this may seem like\r\na long time. But consult your nearest government worker and you'll\r\nfind that it was about par for the red tape course.\r\n\r\nWe had learned early in the project that about 60 per cent of the\r\nreported UFO's were actually balloons, airplanes, or astronomical\r\nbodies viewed under unusual conditions, so our operational plan was\r\nset up to quickly weed out this type of report. This would give us\r\nmore time to concentrate on the unknown cases.\r\n\r\nTo weed out reports in which balloons, airplanes, and astronomical\r\nbodies were reported as UFO's, we utilized a flow of data that\r\ncontinually poured into Project Blue Book. We received position\r\nreports on all flights of the big skyhook balloons and, by merely\r\npicking up the telephone, we could get the details about the flight\r\nof any other research balloon or regularly scheduled weather balloon\r\nin the United States. The location of aircraft in an area where a UFO\r\nhad been reported was usually checked by the intelligence officer who\r\nmade the report, but we double-checked his findings by requesting the\r\nlocation of flights from CAA and military air bases. Astronomical\r\nalmanacs and journals, star charts, and data that we got from\r\nobservatories furnished us with clues to UFO's that might be\r\nastronomical bodies. All of our investigations in this category of\r\nreport were double-checked by Project Bear's astronomer.\r\n\r\nThen we had our newspaper clipping file, which gave us many clues.\r\nHydrographic bulletins and Notams (notices to airmen), published by\r\nthe government, sometimes gave us other clues. Every six hours we\r\nreceived a complete set of weather data. A dozen or more other\r\nsources of data that might shed some light on a reported UFO were\r\ncontinually being studied.\r\n\r\nTo get all this information on balloons, aircraft, astronomical\r\nbodies, and what have you, I had to co-ordinate Project Blue Book's\r\noperational plan with the Air Force's Air Weather Service, Flight\r\nService, Research and Development Command, and Air Defense Command\r\nwith the Navy's Office of Naval Research, and the aerology branch of\r\nthe Bureau of Aeronautics; and with the Civil Aeronautics\r\nAdministration, Bureau of Standards, several astronomical\r\nobservatories, and our own Project Bear. Our entire operational plan\r\nwas similar to a Model A Ford I had while I was in high school--just\r\nabout the time you would get one part working, another part would\r\nbreak down.\r\n\r\nWhen a report came through our screening process and still had the\r\n\"Unknown\" tag on it, it went to the MO file, where we checked its\r\ncharacteristics against other reports. For example, on May 25 we had\r\na report from Randolph AFB, Texas. It went through the screening\r\nprocess and came out \"Unknown\"; it wasn't a balloon, airplane, or\r\nastronomical body. So then it went to the MO file. It was a flock of\r\nducks reflecting the city lights. We knew that the Texas UFO's were\r\nducks because our MO file showed that we had an identical report from\r\nMoorhead, Minnesota, and the UFO's at Moorhead were ducks.\r\n\r\nRadar reports that came into Blue Book went to the radar specialists\r\nof ATIC's electronics branch.\r\n\r\nSifting through reams of data in search of the answers to the many\r\nreports that were pouring in each week required many hours of\r\novertime work, but when a report came out with the final conclusion,\r\n\"Unknown,\" we were sure that it was unknown.\r\n\r\nTo operate Project Blue Book, I had four officers, two airmen, and\r\ntwo civilians on my permanent staff. In addition, there were three\r\nscientists employed full time on Project Bear, along with several\r\nothers who worked part time. In the Pentagon, Major Fournet, who had\r\ntaken on the Blue Book liaison job as an extra duty, was now spending\r\nfull time on it. If you add to this the number of intelligence\r\nofficers all over the world who were making preliminary\r\ninvestigations and interviewing UFO observers, Project Blue Book was\r\na sizable effort.\r\n\r\nOnly the best reports we received could be personally investigated\r\nin the field by Project Blue Book personnel. The vast majority of the\r\nreports had to be evaluated on the basis of what the intelligence\r\nofficer who had written the report had been able to uncover, or what\r\ndata we could get by telephone or by mailing out a questionnaire. Our\r\ninstructions for \"what to do before the Blue Book man arrives,\" which\r\nhad been printed in many service publications, were beginning to pay\r\noff and the reports were continually getting more detailed.\r\n\r\nThe questionnaire we were using in June 1952 was the one that had\r\nrecently been developed by Project Bear. Project Bear, along with\r\npsychologists from a midwestern university, had worked on it for five\r\nmonths. Many test models had been tried before it reached its final\r\nform--the standard questionnaire that Blue Book is using today.\r\n\r\nIt ran eight pages and had sixty-eight questions which were booby-\r\ntrapped in a couple of places to give us a cross check on the\r\nreliability of the reporter as an observer. We received quite a few\r\nquestionnaires answered in such a way that it was obvious that the\r\nobserver was drawing heavily on his imagination.\r\n\r\nFrom this standard questionnaire the project worked up two more\r\nspecialized types. One dealt with radar sightings of UFO's, the other\r\nwith sightings made from airplanes.\r\n\r\nIn Air Force terminology a \"flap\" is a condition, or situation, or\r\nstate of being of a group of people characterized by an advanced\r\ndegree of confusion that has not quite yet reached panic proportions.\r\nIt can be brought on by any number of things, including the\r\nunexpected visit of an inspecting general, a major administrative\r\nreorganization, the arrival of a hot piece of intelligence\r\ninformation, or the dramatic entrance of a well-stacked female into\r\nan officers' club bar.\r\n\r\nIn early June 1952 the Air Force was unknowingly in the initial\r\nstages of a flap--a flying saucer flap--_the_ flying saucer flap of\r\n1952. The situation had never been duplicated before, and it hasn't\r\nbeen duplicated since. All records for the number of UFO reports were\r\nnot just broken, they were disintegrated. In 1948, 167 UFO reports\r\nhad come into ATIC; this was considered a big year. In June 1952 we\r\nreceived 149. During the four years the Air Force had been in the UFO\r\nbusiness, 615 reports had been collected. During the \"Big Flap\" our\r\nincoming-message log showed 717 reports.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who had anything to do with flying saucers, the summer of\r\n1952 was just one big swirl of UFO reports, hurried trips, midnight\r\ntelephone calls, reports to the Pentagon, press interviews, and very\r\nlittle sleep.\r\n\r\nIf you can pin down a date that the Big Flap started, it would\r\nprobably be about June 1.\r\n\r\nIt was also on June 1 that we received a good report of a UFO that\r\nhad been picked up on radar. June 1 was a Sunday, but I'd been at the\r\noffice all day getting ready to go to Los Alamos the next day. About\r\n5:00P.M. the telephone rang and the operator told me that I had a\r\nlong-distance call from California. My caller was the chief of a\r\nradar test section for Hughes Aircraft Company in Los Angeles, and he\r\nwas very excited about a UFO he had to report.\r\n\r\nThat morning he and his test crew had been checking out a new late-\r\nmodel radar to get it ready for some tests they planned to run early\r\nMonday morning. To see if their set was functioning properly, they\r\nhad been tracking jets in the Los Angeles area. About midmorning, the\r\nHughes test engineer told me, the jet traffic had begun to drop off,\r\nand they were about ready to close down their operation when one of\r\nthe crew picked up a slow-moving target coming across the San Gabriel\r\nMountains north of Los Angeles. He tracked the target for a few\r\nminutes and, from the speed and altitude, decided that it was a DC-3.\r\nIt was at 11,000 feet and traveling about 180 miles an hour toward\r\nSanta Monica. The operator was about ready to yell at the other crew\r\nmembers to shut off the set when he noticed something mighty odd--\r\nthere was a big gap between the last and the rest of the regularly\r\nspaced bright spots on the radarscope. The man on the scope called\r\nthe rest of the crew in because DC-3's just don't triple their speed.\r\nThey watched the target as it made a turn and started to climb over\r\nLos Angeles. They plotted one, two, three, and then four points\r\nduring the target's climb; then one of the crew grabbed a slide rule.\r\nWhatever it was, it was climbing 35,000 feet per minute and traveling\r\nabout 550 miles an hour in the process. Then as they watched the\r\nscope, the target leveled out for a few seconds, went into a high-\r\nspeed dive, and again leveled out at 55,000 feet. When they lost the\r\ntarget, it was heading southeast somewhere near Riverside, California.\r\n\r\nDuring the sighting my caller told me that when the UFO was only\r\nabout ten miles from the radar site two of the crew had gone outside\r\nbut they couldn't see anything. But, he explained, even the high-\r\nflying jets that they had been tracking hadn't been leaving vapor\r\ntrails.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I asked when the Hughes test engineer finished his\r\nstory was if the radar set had been working properly. He said that as\r\nsoon as the UFO had left the scope they had run every possible check\r\non the radar and it was O.K.\r\n\r\nI was just about to ask my caller if the target might not have been\r\nsome experimental airplane from Edwards AFB when he second-guessed\r\nme. He said that after sitting around looking at each other for about\r\na minute, someone suggested that they call Edwards. They did, and\r\nEdwards' flight operations told them that they had nothing in the area.\r\n\r\nI asked him about the weather. The target didn't look like a weather\r\ntarget was the answer, but just to be sure, the test crew had\r\nchecked. One of his men was an electronics-weather specialist whom he\r\nhad hired because of his knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of radar\r\nunder certain weather conditions. This man had looked into the\r\nweather angle. He had gotten the latest weather data and checked it,\r\nbut there wasn't the slightest indication of an inversion or any\r\nother weather that would cause a false target.\r\n\r\nJust before I hung up I asked the man what he thought he and his\r\ncrew had picked up, and once again I got the same old answer:\r\n\"Yesterday at this time any of us would have argued for hours that\r\nflying saucers were a bunch of nonsense but now, regardless of what\r\nyou'll say about what we saw, it was something damned real.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked the man for calling and hung up. We couldn't make any more\r\nof an analysis of this report than had already been made, it was\r\nanother unknown.\r\n\r\nI went over to the MO file and pulled out the stack of cards behind\r\nthe tab \"High-Speed Climb.\" There must have been at least a hundred\r\ncards, each one representing a UFO report in which the reported\r\nobject made a high-speed climb. But this was the first time radar had\r\ntracked a UFO during a climb.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of June, Project Blue Book took another jump\r\nup on the organizational chart. A year before the UFO project had\r\nconsisted of one officer. It had risen from the one-man operation to\r\na project within a group, then to a group, and now it was a section.\r\nNeither Project Sign nor the old Project Grudge had been higher than\r\nthe project-within-a-group level. The chief of a group normally calls\r\nfor a lieutenant colonel, and since I was just a captain this caused\r\nsome consternation in the ranks. There was some talk about putting\r\nLieutenant Colonel Ray Taylor of Colonel Dunn's staff in charge.\r\nColonel Taylor was very much interested in UFO's; he had handled some\r\nof the press contacts prior to turning this function over to the\r\nPentagon and had gone along with me on briefings, so he knew\r\nsomething about the project. But in the end Colonel Donald Bower, who\r\nwas my division chief, decided rank be damned, and I stayed on as\r\nchief of Project Blue Book.\r\n\r\nThe location within the organizational chart is always indicative of\r\nthe importance placed on a project. In June 1952 the Air Force was\r\ntaking the UFO problem seriously. One of the reasons was that there\r\nwere a lot of good UFO reports coming in from Korea. Fighter pilots\r\nreported seeing silver-colored spheres or disks on several occasions,\r\nand radar in Japan, Okinawa, and in Korea had tracked unidentified\r\ntargets.\r\n\r\nIn June our situation map, on which we kept a plot of all of our\r\nsightings, began to show an ever so slight trend toward reports\r\nbeginning to bunch up on the east coast. We discussed this build-up,\r\nbut we couldn't seem to find any explainable reason for it so we\r\ndecided that we'd better pay special attention to reports coming from\r\nthe eastern states.\r\n\r\nI had this build-up of reports in mind one Sunday night, June 15 to\r\nbe exact, when the OD at ATIC called me at home and said that we were\r\ngetting a lot of reports from Virginia. Each report by itself wasn't\r\ntoo good, the OD told me, but together they seemed to mean something.\r\nHe suggested that I come out and take a look at them--so I did.\r\n\r\nIndividually they weren't too good, but when I lined them up\r\nchronologically and plotted them on a map they took the form of a hot\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nAt 3:40P.M. a woman at Unionville, Virginia, had reported a \"very\r\nshiny object\" at high altitude.\r\n\r\nAt 4:20P.M. the operators of the CAA radio facility at Gordonsville,\r\nVirginia, had reported that they saw a \"round, shiny object.\" It was\r\nsoutheast of their station, or directly south of Unionville.\r\n\r\nAt 4:25P.M. the crew of an airliner northwest of Richmond, Virginia,\r\nreported a \"silver sphere at eleven o'clock high.\"\r\n\r\nAt 4:43P.M. a Marine pilot in a jet tried to intercept a \"round\r\nshiny sphere\" south of Gordonsville.\r\n\r\nAt 5:43P.M. an Air Force T-33 jet tried to intercept a \"shiny\r\nsphere\" south of Gordonsville. He got above 35,000 feet and the UFO\r\nwas still far above him.\r\n\r\nAt 7:35P.M. many people in Blackstone, Virginia, about 80 miles\r\nsouth of Gordonsville, reported it. It was a \"round, shiny object\r\nwith a golden glow\" moving from north to south. By this time radio\r\ncommentators in central Virginia were giving a running account of the\r\nUFO's progress.\r\n\r\nAt 7:59P.M. the people in the CAA radio facility at Blackstone saw it.\r\n\r\nAt 8:00P.M. jets arrived from Langley AFB to attempt to intercept\r\nit, but at 8:05P.M. it disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis was a good report because it was the first time we ever\r\nreceived a series of reports on the same object, and there was no\r\ndoubt that all these people had reported the same object. Whatever it\r\nwas, it wasn't moving too fast, because it had traveled only about 90\r\nmiles in four hours and twenty-five minutes. I was about ready to\r\ngive up until morning and go home when my wife called. The local\r\nAssociated Press man had called our home and she assumed that it was\r\nabout this sighting. She had just said that I was out so he might not\r\ncall the base. I decided that I'd better keep working so I'd have the\r\nanswer in time to keep the story out of the papers. A report like\r\nthis could cause some excitement.\r\n\r\nThe UFO obviously wasn't a planet because it was moving from north\r\nto south, and it was too slow to be an airplane. I called the balloon-\r\nplotting center at Lowry AFB, where the tracks of the big skyhook\r\nballoons are plotted, but the only big balloons in the air were in\r\nthe western United States, and they were all accounted for.\r\n\r\nIt might have been a weather balloon. The wind charts showed that\r\nthe high-altitude winds were blowing in different directions at\r\ndifferent altitudes above 35,000 feet, so there was no one flow of\r\nair that could have brought a balloon in from a certain area, and I\r\nknew that the UFO had to be higher than 35,000 feet because the T-33\r\njet had been this high and the UFO was still above it. The only thing\r\nto do was to check with all of the weather stations in the area. I\r\ncalled Richmond, Roanoke, several places in the vicinity of\r\nWashington, D.C., and four or five other weather stations, but all of\r\ntheir balloons were accounted for and none had been anywhere close to\r\nthe central part of Virginia.\r\n\r\nA balloon can travel only so far, so there was no sense in checking\r\nstations too far away from where the people had seen the UFO, but I\r\ntook a chance and called Norfolk; Charleston, West Virginia; Altoona,\r\nPennsylvania; and other stations within a 150-mile radius of\r\nGordonsville and Blackstone. Nothing.\r\n\r\nI still thought it might be a balloon, so I started to call more\r\nstations. At Pittsburgh I hit a lead. Their radiosonde balloon had\r\ngone up to about 60,000 feet and evidently had sprung a slow leak\r\nbecause it had leveled off at that altitude. Normally balloons go up\r\ntill they burst at 80,000 or 90,000 feet. The weather forecaster at\r\nPittsburgh said that their records showed they had lost contact with\r\nthe balloon when it was about 60 miles southeast of their station. He\r\nsaid that the winds at 60,000 feet were constant, so it shouldn't be\r\ntoo difficult to figure out where the balloon went after they had\r\nlost it. Things must be dull in Pittsburgh at 2:00 a.m. on Monday\r\nmornings, because he offered to plot the course that the balloon\r\nprobably took and call me back.\r\n\r\nIn about twenty minutes I got my call. It probably was their\r\nballoon, the forecaster said. Above 50,000 feet there was a strong\r\nflow of air southeast from Pittsburgh, and this fed into a stronger\r\nsoutherly flow that was paralleling the Atlantic coast just east of\r\nthe Appalachian Mountains. The balloon would have floated along in\r\nthis flow of air like a log floating down a river. As close as he\r\ncould estimate, he said, the balloon would arrive in the Gordonsville-\r\nBlackstone area in the late afternoon or early evening. This was just\r\nabout the time the UFO had arrived.\r\n\r\n\"Probably a balloon\" was a good enough answer for me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at 8:00A.M., Al Chop called from the Pentagon to\r\ntell me that people were crawling all over his desk wanting to know\r\nabout a sighting in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe reports continued to come in. At Walnut Lake, Michigan, a group\r\nof people with binoculars watched a \"soft white light\" go back and\r\nforth across the western sky for nearly an hour. A UFO \"paced\" an Air\r\nForce B-25 for thirty minutes in California. Both of these happened\r\non June 18, and although we checked and rechecked them, they came out\r\nas unknowns.\r\n\r\nOn June 19 radar at Goose AFB in Newfoundland picked up some odd\r\ntargets. The targets came across the scope, suddenly enlarged, and\r\nthen became smaller again. One unofficial comment was that the object\r\nwas flat or disk-shaped, and that the radar target had gotten bigger\r\nbecause the disk had banked in flight to present a greater reflecting\r\nsurface. ATIC's official comment was weather.\r\n\r\nGoose AFB was famous for unusual reports. In early UFO history\r\nsomeone had taken a very unusual colored photo of a \"split cloud.\"\r\nThe photographer had seen a huge ball of fire streak down through the\r\nsky and pass through a high layer of stratus clouds. As the fireball\r\npassed through the cloud it cut out a perfect swath. The conclusion\r\nwas that the fireball was a meteor, but the case is still one of the\r\nmost interesting in the file because of the photograph.\r\n\r\nThen in early 1952 there was another good report from this area. It\r\nwas an unknown.\r\n\r\nThe incident started when the pilot of an Air Force C-54 transport\r\nradioed Goose AFB and said that at 10:42P.M. a large fireball had\r\nbuzzed his airplane. It had come in from behind the C-54, and nobody\r\nhad seen it until it was just off the left wing. The fireball was so\r\nbig that the pilot said it looked as if it was only a few hundred\r\nfeet away. The C-54 was 200 miles southwest, coming into Goose AFB\r\nfrom Westover AFB, Massachusetts, when the incident occurred. The\r\nbase officer-of-the-day, who was also a pilot, happened to be in the\r\nflight operations office at Goose when the message came in and he\r\noverheard the report. He stepped outside, walked over to his command\r\ncar, and told his driver about the radio message, so the driver got\r\nout and both of them looked toward the south. They searched the\r\nhorizon for a few seconds; then suddenly they saw a light closing in\r\nfrom the southwest. Within a second, it was near the airfield. It had\r\nincreased in size till it was as big as a \"golf ball at arm's\r\nlength,\" and it looked like a big ball of fire. It was so low that\r\nboth the OD and his driver dove under the command car because they\r\nwere sure it was going to hit the airfield. When they turned and\r\nlooked up they saw the fireball make a 90-degree turn over the\r\nairfield and disappear into the northwest. The time was 10:47P.M.\r\n\r\nThe control tower operators saw the fireball too, but didn't agree\r\nwith the OD and his driver on how low it was. They did think that it\r\nhad made a 90-degree turn and they didn't think that it was a meteor.\r\nIn the years they'd been in towers they'd seen hundreds of meteors,\r\nbut they'd never seen anything like this, they reported.\r\n\r\nAnd reports continued to pour into Project Blue Book. It was now not\r\nuncommon to get ten or eleven wires in one day. If the letters\r\nreporting UFO sightings were counted, the total would rise to twenty\r\nor thirty a day. The majority of the reports that came in by wire\r\ncould be classified as being good. They were reports made by reliable\r\npeople and they were full of details. Some were reports of balloons,\r\nairplanes, etc., but the percentage of unknowns hovered right around\r\n22 per cent.\r\n\r\nTo describe and analyze each report, or even the unknowns, would\r\nrequire a book the size of an unabridged dictionary, so I am covering\r\nonly the best and most representative cases.\r\n\r\nOne day in mid-June, Colonel Dunn called me. He was leaving for\r\nWashington and he wanted me to come in the next day to give a\r\nbriefing at a meeting. By this time I was taking these briefings as a\r\nmatter of course. We usually gave the briefings to General Garland\r\nand a general from the Research and Development Board, who passed the\r\ninformation on to General Samford, the Director of Intelligence. But\r\nthis time General Samford, some of the members of his staff, two Navy\r\ncaptains from the Office of Naval Intelligence, and some people I\r\ncan't name were at the briefing.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Washington, Major Fournet told me that the purpose of\r\nthe meetings, and my briefing, was to try to find out if there was any\r\nsignificance to the almost alarming increase in UFO reports over the\r\npast few weeks. By the time that everyone had finished signing into the\r\nbriefing room in the restricted area of the fourth-floor \"B\" ring of the\r\nPentagon, it was about 9:15A.M. I started my briefing as soon as\r\neveryone was seated.\r\n\r\nI reviewed the last month's UFO activities; then I briefly went over\r\nthe more outstanding \"Unknown\" UFO reports and pointed out how they\r\nwere increasing in number--breaking all previous records. I also\r\npointed out that even though the UFO subject was getting a lot of\r\npublicity, it wasn't the scare-type publicity that had accompanied\r\nthe earlier flaps--in fact, much of the present publicity was anti-\r\nsaucer.\r\n\r\nThen I went on to say that even though the reports we were getting\r\nwere detailed and contained a great deal of good data, we still had\r\nno proof the UFO's were anything real. We could, I said, prove that\r\nall UFO reports were merely the misinterpretation of known objects\r\n_if_ we made a few assumptions.\r\n\r\nAt this point one of the colonels on General Samford's staff stopped\r\nme. \"Isn't it true,\" he asked, \"that if you make a few positive\r\nassumptions instead of negative assumptions you can just as easily\r\nprove that the UFO's are interplanetary spaceships? Why, when you\r\nhave to make an assumption to get an answer to a report, do you\r\nalways pick the assumption that proves the UFO's don't exist?\"\r\n\r\nYou could almost hear the colonel add, \"O.K., so now I've said it.\"\r\n\r\nFor several months the belief that Project Blue Book was taking a\r\nnegative attitude and the fact that the UFO's could be interplanetary\r\nspaceships had been growing in the Pentagon, but these ideas were\r\nusually discussed only in the privacy of offices with doors that\r\nwould close tight.\r\n\r\nNo one said anything, so the colonel who had broken the ice plunged\r\nin. He used the sighting from Goose AFB, where the fireball had\r\nbuzzed the C-54 and sent the OD and his driver belly-whopping under\r\nthe command car as an example. The colonel pointed out that even\r\nthough we had labeled the report \"Unknown\" it wasn't accepted as\r\nproof. He wanted to know why.\r\n\r\nI said that our philosophy was that the fireball could have been two\r\nmeteors: one that buzzed the C-54 and another that streaked across\r\nthe airfield at Goose AFB. Granted a meteor doesn't come within feet\r\nof an airplane or make a 90-degree turn, but these could have been\r\noptical illusions of some kind. The crew of the C-54, the OD, his\r\ndriver, and the tower operators didn't recognize the UFO's as meteors\r\nbecause they were used to seeing the normal \"shooting stars\" that are\r\nmost commonly seen.\r\n\r\nBut the colonel had some more questions. \"What are the chances of\r\nhaving two extremely spectacular meteors in the same area, traveling\r\nthe same direction, only five minutes apart?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't know the exact mathematical probability, but it was rather\r\nsmall, I had to admit.\r\n\r\nThen he asked, \"What kind of an optical illusion would cause a\r\nmeteor to appear to make a 90-degree turn?\"\r\n\r\nI had asked our Project Bear astronomer this same question, and he\r\ncouldn't answer it either. So the only answer I could give the\r\ncolonel was, \"I don't know.\" I felt as if I were on a witness stand\r\nbeing cross-examined, and that is exactly where I was, because the\r\ncolonel cut loose.\r\n\r\n\"Why not assume a point that is more easily proved?\" he asked. \"Why\r\nnot assume that the C-54 crew, the OD, his driver, and the tower\r\noperators did know what they were talking about? Maybe they had seen\r\nspectacular meteors during the hundreds of hours that they had flown\r\nat night and the many nights that they had been on duty in the tower.\r\nMaybe the ball of fire had made a 90-degree turn. Maybe it was some\r\nkind of an intelligently controlled craft that had streaked northeast\r\nacross the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Quebec Province at 2,400 miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\"Why not just simply believe that most people know what they saw?\"\r\nthe colonel said with no small amount of sarcasm in his voice.\r\n\r\nThis last comment started a lively discussion, and I was able to\r\nretreat. The colonel had been right in a sense--we were being\r\nconservative, but maybe this was the right way to be. In any\r\nscientific investigation you always assume that you don't have enough\r\nproof until you get a positive answer. I don't think that we had a\r\npositive answer--yet.\r\n\r\nThe colonel's comments split the group, and a hot exchange of ideas,\r\npros and cons, and insinuations that some people were imitating\r\nostriches to keep from facing the truth followed.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the meeting was a directive to take further steps to\r\nobtain positive identification of the UFO's. Our original idea of\r\nattempting to get several separate reports from one sighting so we\r\ncould use triangulation to measure speed, altitude, and size wasn't\r\nworking out. We had given the idea enough publicity, but reports\r\nwhere triangulation could be used were few and far between. Mr. or\r\nMrs. Average Citizen just doesn't look up at the sky unless he or she\r\nsees a flash of light or hears a sound. Then even if he or she does\r\nlook up and sees a UFO, it is very seldom that the report ever gets\r\nto Project Blue Book. I think that it would be safe to say that Blue\r\nBook only heard about 10 per cent of the UFO's that were seen in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting I went back to ATIC, and the next day Colonel Don\r\nBower and I left for the west coast to talk to some people about how\r\nto get better UFO data. We brought back the idea of using an\r\nextremely long focal-length camera equipped with a diffraction grating.\r\n\r\nThe cameras would be placed at various locations throughout the\r\nUnited States where UFO's were most frequently seen. We hoped that\r\nphotos of the UFO's taken through the diffraction gratings would give\r\nus some proof one way or the other.\r\n\r\nThe diffraction gratings we planned to use over the lenses of the\r\ncameras were the same thing as prisms; they would split up the light\r\nfrom the UFO into its component parts so that we could study it and\r\ndetermine whether it was a meteor, an airplane, or balloon reflecting\r\nsunlight, etc. Or we might be able to prove that the photographed UFO\r\nwas a craft completely foreign to our knowledge.\r\n\r\nA red-hot, A-l priority was placed on the camera project, and a\r\nsection at ATIC that developed special equipment took over the job of\r\nobtaining the cameras, or, if necessary, having them designed and\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nBut the UFO's weren't waiting around till they could be\r\nphotographed. Every day the tempo and confusion were increasing a\r\nlittle more.\r\n\r\nBy the end of June it was very noticeable that most of the better\r\nreports were coming from the eastern United States. In Massachusetts,\r\nNew Jersey, and Maryland jet fighters had been scrambled almost\r\nnightly for a week. On three occasions radar-equipped F-94's had\r\nlocked on aerial targets only to have the lock-on broken by the\r\napparent violent maneuvers of the target.\r\n\r\nBy the end of June there was also a lull in the newspaper publicity\r\nabout the UFO's. The forthcoming political conventions had wiped out\r\nany mention of flying saucers. But on July 1 there was a sudden\r\noutbreak of good reports. The first one came from Boston; then they\r\nworked down the coast.\r\n\r\nAbout seven twenty-five on the morning of July 1 two F-94's were\r\nscrambled to intercept a UFO that a Ground Observer Corps spotter\r\nreported was traveling southwest across Boston. Radar couldn't pick\r\nit up so the two airplanes were just vectored into the general area.\r\nThe F-94's searched the area but couldn't see anything. We got the\r\nreport at ATIC and would have tossed it out if it hadn't been for\r\nother reports from the Boston area at that same time.\r\n\r\nOne of these reports came from a man and his wife at Lynn,\r\nMassachusetts, nine miles northeast of Boston. At seven-thirty they\r\nhad noticed the two vapor trails from the climbing jet interceptors.\r\nThey looked around the sky to find out if they could see what the\r\njets were after and off to the west they saw a bright silver \"cigar-\r\nshaped object about six times as long as it was wide\" traveling\r\nsouthwest across Boston. It appeared to be traveling just a little\r\nfaster than the two jets. As they watched they saw that an identical\r\nUFO was following the first one some distance back. The UFO's weren't\r\nleaving vapor trails but, as the man mentioned in his report, this\r\ndidn't mean anything because you can get above the vapor trail level.\r\nAnd the two UFO's appeared to be at a very high altitude. The two\r\nobservers watched as the two F-94's searched back and forth far below\r\nthe UFO's.\r\n\r\nThen there was another report, also made at seven-thirty. An Air\r\nForce captain was just leaving his home in Bedford, about 15 miles\r\nnorthwest of Boston and straight west of Lynn, when he saw the two\r\njets. In his report he said that he, too, had looked around the sky\r\nto see if he could see what they were trying to intercept when off to\r\nthe east he saw a \"silvery cigar-shaped object\" traveling south. His\r\ndescription of what he observed was almost identical to what the\r\ncouple in Lynn reported except that he saw only one UFO.\r\n\r\nWhen we received the report, I wanted to send someone up to Boston\r\nimmediately in the hope of getting more data from the civilian couple\r\nand the Air Force captain; this seemed to be a tailor-made case for\r\ntriangulation. But by July 1 we were completely snowed under with\r\nreports, and there just wasn't anybody to send. Then, to complicate\r\nmatters, other reports came in later in the day.\r\n\r\nJust two hours after the sighting in the Boston area Fort Monmouth,\r\nNew Jersey, popped back into UFO history. At nine-thirty in the\r\nmorning twelve student radar operators and three instructors were\r\ntracking nine jets on an SCR 584 radar set when two UFO targets\r\nappeared on the scope. The two targets came in from the northeast at\r\na slow speed, much slower than the jets that were being tracked,\r\nhovered near Fort Monmouth at 50,000 feet for about five minutes, and\r\nthen took off in a \"terrific burst of speed\" to the southwest.\r\n\r\nWhen the targets first appeared, some of the class went outside with\r\nan instructor, and after searching the sky for about a minute, they\r\nsaw two shiny objects in the same location as the radar showed the\r\ntwo unidentified targets to be. They watched the two UFO's for\r\nseveral minutes and saw them go zipping off to the southwest at\r\nexactly the same time that the two radar targets moved off the scope\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nWe had plotted these reports, the ones from Boston and the one from\r\nFort Monmouth, on a map, and without injecting any imagination or\r\nwild assumptions, it looked as if two \"somethings\" had come down\r\nacross Boston on a southwesterly heading, crossed Long Island,\r\nhovered for a few minutes over the Army's secret laboratories at Fort\r\nMonmouth, then proceeded toward Washington. In a way we half expected\r\nto get a report from Washington. Our expectations were rewarded\r\nbecause in a few hours a report arrived from that city.\r\n\r\nA physics professor at George Washington University reported a\r\n\"dull, gray, smoky-colored\" object which hovered north northwest of\r\nWashington for about eight minutes. Every once in a while, the\r\nprofessor reported, it would move through an arc of about 15 degrees\r\nto the right or left, but it always returned to its original\r\nposition. While he was watching the UFO he took a 25-cent piece out\r\nof his pocket and held it at arm's length so that he could compare\r\nits size to that of the UFO. The UFO was about half the diameter of\r\nthe quarter. When he first saw the UFO, it was about 30 to 40 degrees\r\nabove the horizon, but during the eight minutes it was in sight it\r\nsteadily dropped lower and lower until buildings in downtown\r\nWashington blocked off the view.\r\n\r\nBesides being an \"Unknown,\" this report was exceptionally\r\ninteresting to us because the sighting was made from the center of\r\ndowntown Washington, D.C. The professor reported that he had noticed\r\nthe UFO when he saw people all along the street looking up in the air\r\nand pointing. He estimated that at least 500 people were looking at\r\nit, yet his was the only report we received. This seemed to\r\nsubstantiate our theory that people are very hesitant to report UFO's\r\nto the Air Force. But they evidently do tell the newspapers because\r\nlater on we picked up a short account of the sighting in the\r\nWashington papers. It merely said that hundreds of calls had been\r\nreceived from people reporting a UFO.\r\n\r\nWhen reports were pouring in at the rate of twenty or thirty a day,\r\nwe were glad that people were hesitant to report UFO's, but when we\r\nwere trying to find the answer to a really knotty sighting we always\r\nwished that more people had reported it. The old adage of having your\r\ncake and eating it, too, held even for the UFO.\r\n\r\nTechnically no one in Washington, besides, of course, Major General\r\nSamford and his superiors, had anything to do with making policy\r\ndecisions about the operation of Project Blue Book or the handling of\r\nthe UFO situation in general. Nevertheless, everyone was trying to\r\nget into the act. The split in opinions on what to do about the\r\nrising tide of UFO reports, the split that first came out in the open\r\nat General Samford's briefing, was widening every day. One group was\r\ngetting dead-serious about the situation. They thought we now had\r\nplenty of evidence to back up an official statement that the UFO's\r\nwere something real and, to be specific, not something from this\r\nearth. This group wanted Project Blue Book to quit spending time\r\ninvestigating reports from the standpoint of trying to determine if\r\nthe observer of a UFO had actually seen something foreign to our\r\nknowledge and start assuming that he or she had. They wanted me to\r\naim my investigation at trying to find out more about the UFO. Along\r\nwith this switch in operating policy, they wanted to clamp down on\r\nthe release of information. They thought that the security\r\nclassification of the project should go up to Top Secret until we had\r\nall of the answers, then the information should be released to the\r\npublic. The investigation of UFO's along these lines should be a\r\nmaximum effort, they thought, and their plans called for lining up\r\nmany top scientists to devote their full time to the project. Someone\r\nonce said that enthusiasm is infectious, and he was right. The\r\nenthusiasm of this group took a firm hold in the Pentagon, at Air\r\nDefense Command Headquarters, on the Research and Development Board,\r\nand many other agencies throughout the government. But General\r\nSamford was still giving the orders, and he said to continue to\r\noperate just as we had--keeping an open mind to any ideas.\r\n\r\nAfter the minor flurry of reports on July 1 we had a short breathing\r\nspell and found time to clean up a sizable backlog of reports. People\r\nwere still seeing UFO's but the frequency of the sighting curve was\r\ndropping steadily. During the first few days of July we were getting\r\nonly two or three good reports a day.\r\n\r\nOn July 5 the crew of a non-scheduled airliner made page two of many\r\nnewspapers by reporting a UFO over the AEC's supersecret Hanford,\r\nWashington, installation. It was a skyhook balloon. On the twelfth a\r\nhuge meteor sliced across Indiana, southern Illinois, and Missouri\r\nthat netted us twenty or thirty reports. Even before they had stopped\r\ncoming in, we had confirmation from our astronomer that the UFO was a\r\nmeteor.\r\n\r\nBut forty-two minutes later there was a sighting in Chicago that\r\nwasn't so easily explained.\r\n\r\nAccording to our weather records, on the night of July 12 it was hot\r\nin Chicago. At nine forty-two there were at least 400 people at\r\nMontrose Beach trying to beat the heat. Many of them were lying down\r\nlooking at the stars, so that they saw the UFO as it came in from the\r\nwest northwest, made a 180-degree turn directly over their heads, and\r\ndisappeared over the horizon. It was a \"large red light with small\r\nwhite lights on the side,\" most of the people reported. Some of them\r\nsaid that it changed to a single yellow light as it made its turn. It\r\nwas in sight about five minutes, and during this time no one reported\r\nhearing any sound.\r\n\r\nOne of the people at the beach was the weather officer from O'Hare\r\nInternational Airport, an Air Force captain. He immediately called\r\nO'Hare. They checked on balloon flights and with radar, but both were\r\nnegative; radar said that there had been no aircraft in the area of\r\nMontrose Beach for several hours.\r\n\r\nI sent an investigator to Chicago, and although he came back with a\r\nlot of data on the sighting, it didn't add up to be anything known.\r\n\r\nThe next day Dayton had its first UFO sighting in a long time when a\r\nMr. Roy T. Ellis, president of the Rubber Seal Products Company, and\r\nmany other people, reported a teardrop-shaped object that hovered\r\nover Dayton for several minutes about midnight. This sighting had an\r\ninteresting twist because two years later I was in Dayton and stopped\r\nin at ATIC to see a friend who is one of the technical advisers at\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nNaturally the conversation got around to the subject of UFO's, and\r\nhe asked me if I remembered this specific sighting. I did, so he went\r\non to say that he and his wife had seen this UFO that night but they\r\nhad never told anybody. He was very serious when he admitted that he\r\nhad no idea what it could have been. Now I'd heard this statement a\r\nthousand times before from other people, but coming from this person,\r\nit was really something because he was as anti-saucer as anyone I\r\nknew. Then he added, \"From that time on I didn't think your saucer\r\nreporters were as crazy as I used to think they were.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dayton sighting also created quite a stir in the press. In\r\nconjunction with the sighting, the Dayton Daily _Journal_ had\r\ninterviewed Colonel Richard H. Magee, the Dayton-Oakwood civil\r\ndefense director; they wanted to know what he thought about the\r\nUFO's. The colonel's answer made news: \"There's something flying\r\naround in our skies and we wish we knew what it was.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the story broke in other papers, the colonel's affiliation with\r\ncivil defense wasn't mentioned, and he became merely \"a colonel from\r\nDayton.\" Dayton was quickly construed by the public to mean Wright-\r\nPatterson AFB and specifically ATIC. Some people in the Pentagon\r\nscreamed while others gleefully clapped their hands. The gleeful\r\nhandclaps were from those people who wanted the UFO's to be socially\r\nrecognized, and they believed that if they couldn't talk their ideas\r\ninto being they might be able to force them in with the help of this\r\ntype of publicity.\r\n\r\nThe temporary lull in reporting that Project Blue Book had\r\nexperienced in early July proved to be only the calm before the\r\nstorm. By mid-July we were getting about twenty reports a day plus\r\nfrantic calls from intelligence officers all over the United States\r\nas every Air Force installation in the U.S. was being swamped with\r\nreports. We told the intelligence officers to send in the ones that\r\nsounded the best.\r\n\r\nThe build-up in UFO reports wasn't limited to the United States--\r\nevery day we would receive reports from our air attaches in other\r\ncountries. England and France led the field, with the South American\r\ncountries running a close third. Needless to say, we didn't\r\ninvestigate or evaluate foreign reports because we had our hands full\r\nright at home.\r\n\r\nMost of us were putting in fourteen hours a day, six days a week. It\r\nwasn't at all uncommon for Lieutenant Andy Flues, Bob Olsson, or\r\nKerry Rothstien, my investigators, to get their sleep on an airliner\r\ngoing out or coming back from an investigation. TWA airliners out of\r\nDayton were more like home than home. But we hadn't seen anything yet.\r\n\r\nAll the reports that were coming in were good ones, ones with no\r\nanswers. Unknowns were running about 40 percent. Rumors persist that\r\nin mid-July 1952 the Air Force was braced for an expected invasion by\r\nflying saucers. Had these rumormongers been at ATIC in mid-July they\r\nwould have thought that the invasion was already in full swing. And\r\nthey would have thought that one of the beachheads for the invasion\r\nwas Patrick AFB, the Air Force's Guided Missile Long-Range Proving\r\nGround on the east coast of Florida.\r\n\r\nOn the night of July 18, at ten forty-five, two officers were\r\nstanding in front of base operations at Patrick when they noticed a\r\nlight at about a 45-degree angle from the horizon and off to the\r\nwest. It was an amber color and \"quite a bit brighter than a star.\"\r\nBoth officers had heard flying saucer stories, and both thought the\r\nlight was a balloon. But, to be comedians, they called to several\r\nmore officers and airmen inside the operations office and told them\r\nto come out and \"see the flying saucer.\" The people came out and\r\nlooked. A few were surprised and took the mysterious light seriously,\r\nat the expense of considerable laughter from the rest of the group.\r\nThe discussion about the light grew livelier and bets that it was a\r\nballoon were placed. In the meantime the light had drifted over the\r\nbase, had stopped for about a minute, turned, and was now heading\r\nnorth. To settle the bet, one of the officers stepped into the base\r\nweather office to find out about the balloon. Yes, one was in the air\r\nand being tracked by radar, he was told. The weather officer said\r\nthat he would call to find out exactly where it was. He called and\r\nfound out that the weather balloon was being tracked due west of the\r\nbase and that the light had gone out about ten minutes before. The\r\nofficer went back outside to find that what was first thought to be a\r\nballoon was now straight north of the field and still lighted. To add\r\nto the confusion, a second amber light had appeared in the west about\r\n20 degrees lower than where the first one was initially seen, and it\r\nwas also heading north but at a much greater speed. In a few seconds\r\nthe first light stopped and started moving back south over the base.\r\n\r\nWhile the group of officers and airmen were watching the two lights,\r\nthe people from the weather office came out to tell the UFO observers\r\nthat the balloon was still traveling straight west. They were just in\r\ntime to see a third light come tearing across the sky, directly\r\noverhead, from west to east. A weatherman went inside and called the\r\nballoon-tracking crew again--their balloon was still far to the west\r\nof the base.\r\n\r\nInside of fifteen minutes two more amber lights came in from the\r\nwest, crossed the base, made a 180-degree turn over the ocean, and\r\ncame back over the observers.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the melee a radar set had been turned on but it\r\ncouldn't pick up any targets. This did, however, eliminate the\r\npossibility of the lights' being aircraft. They weren't stray\r\nballoons either, because the winds at all altitudes were blowing in a\r\nwesterly direction. They obviously weren't meteors. They weren't\r\nsearchlights on a haze layer because there was no weather conducive\r\nto forming a haze layer and there were no searchlights. They could\r\nhave been some type of natural phenomenon, if one desires to take the\r\nnegative approach. Or, if you take the positive approach, they could\r\nhave been spaceships.\r\n\r\nThe next night radar at Washington National Airport picked up UFO's\r\nand one of the most highly publicized sightings of UFO history was in\r\nthe making. It marked the beginning of the end of the Big Flap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE\r\n\r\nThe Washington Merry-Go-Round\r\n\r\nNo flying saucer report in the history of the UFO ever won more\r\nworld acclaim than the Washington National Sightings.\r\n\r\nWhen radars at the Washington National Airport and at Andrews AFB,\r\nboth close to the nation's capital, picked up UFO's, the sightings\r\nbeat the Democratic National Convention out of headline space. They\r\ncreated such a furor that I had inquiries from the office of the\r\nPresident of the United States and from the press in London, Ottawa,\r\nand Mexico City. A junior-sized riot was only narrowly averted in the\r\nlobby of the Roger Smith Hotel in Washington when I refused to tell\r\nU.S. newspaper reporters what I knew about the sightings.\r\n\r\nBesides being the most highly publicized UFO sightings in the Air\r\nForce annals, they were also the most monumentally fouled-up messes\r\nthat repose in the files. Although the Air Force said that the\r\nincident had been fully investigated, the Civil Aeronautics Authority\r\nwrote a formal report on the sightings, and numerous magazine writers\r\nstudied them, the complete story has never fully been told. The pros\r\nhave been left out of the con accounts, and the cons were neatly\r\noverlooked by the pro writers.\r\n\r\nFor a year after the twin sightings we were still putting little\r\npieces in the puzzle.\r\n\r\nIn some aspects the Washington National Sightings could be classed\r\nas a surprise--we used this as an excuse when things got fouled up--\r\nbut in other ways they weren't. A few days prior to the incident a\r\nscientist, from an agency that I can't name, and I were talking about\r\nthe build-up of reports along the east coast of the United States. We\r\ntalked for about two hours, and I was ready to leave when he said\r\nthat he had one last comment to make--a prediction. From his study of\r\nthe UFO reports that he was getting from Air Force Headquarters, and\r\nfrom discussions with his colleagues, he said that he thought that we\r\nwere sitting right on top of a big keg full of loaded flying saucers.\r\n\"Within the next few days,\" he told me, and I remember that he\r\npunctuated his slow, deliberate remarks by hitting the desk with his\r\nfist, \"they're going to blow up and you're going to have the\r\ngranddaddy of all UFO sightings. The sighting will occur in\r\nWashington or New York,\" he predicted, \"probably Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThe trend in the UFO reports that this scientist based his\r\nprediction on hadn't gone unnoticed. We on Project Blue Book had seen\r\nit, and so had the people in the Pentagon; we all had talked about it.\r\n\r\nOn July 10 the crew of a National Airlines plane reported a light\r\n\"too bright to be a lighted balloon and too slow to be a big meteor\"\r\nwhile they were flying south at 2,000 feet near Quantico, Virginia,\r\njust south of Washington.\r\n\r\nOn July 13 another airliner crew reported that when they were 60\r\nmiles southwest of Washington, at 11,000 feet, they saw a light below\r\nthem. It came up to their level, hovered off to the left for several\r\nminutes, and then it took off in a fast, steep climb when the pilot\r\nturned on his landing lights.\r\n\r\nOn July 14 the crew of a Pan American airliner en route from New\r\nYork to Miami reported eight UFO's near Newport News, Virginia, about\r\n130 miles south of Washington.\r\n\r\nTwo nights later there was another sighting in exactly the same area\r\nbut from the ground. At 9:00P.M. a high-ranking civilian scientist\r\nfrom the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Laboratory at\r\nLangley AFB and another man were standing near the ocean looking\r\nsouth over Hampton Roads when they saw two amber-colored lights,\r\n\"much too large to be aircraft lights,\" off to their right, silently\r\ntraveling north. Just before the two lights got abreast of the two\r\nmen they made a 180-degree turn and started back toward the spot\r\nwhere they had first been seen. As they turned, the two lights seemed\r\nto \"jockey for position in the formation.\" About this time a third\r\nlight came out of the west and joined the first two; then as the\r\nthree UFO's climbed out of the area toward the south, several more\r\nlights joined the formation. The entire episode had lasted only three\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe only possible solution to the sighting was that the two men had\r\nseen airplanes. We investigated this report and found that there were\r\nseveral B-26's from Langley AFB in the area at the time of the\r\nsighting, but none of the B-26 pilots remembered being over Hampton\r\nRoads. In fact, all of them had generally stayed well south of\r\nNorfolk until about 10:30P.M. because of thunderstorm activity\r\nnorthwest of Langley. Then there were other factors--the observers\r\nheard no sound and they were away from all city noises, aircraft\r\ndon't carry just one or two amber lights, and the distance between\r\nthe two lights was such that had they been on an airplane the\r\nairplane would have been huge or very close to the observers. And\r\nlast, but not least, the man from the National Advisory Committee for\r\nAeronautics was a very famous aerodynamicist and of such professional\r\nstature that if he said the lights weren't airplanes they weren't.\r\n\r\nThis then was the big build-up to the first Washington national\r\nsighting and the reason why my friend predicted that the Air Force\r\nwas sitting on a big powder keg of loaded flying saucers.\r\n\r\nWhen the keg blew the best laid schemes of the mice and men at ATIC,\r\nthey went the way best laid schemes are supposed to. The first one of\r\nthe highly publicized Washington national sightings started,\r\naccording to the CAA's logbook at the airport, at 11:40P.M. on the\r\nnight of July 19 when two radars at National Airport picked up eight\r\nunidentified targets east and south of Andrews AFB. The targets\r\nweren't airplanes because they would loaf along at 100 to 130 miles\r\nan hour then suddenly accelerate to \"fantastically high speeds\" and\r\nleave the area. During the night the crews of several airliners saw\r\nmysterious lights in the same locations that the radars showed the\r\ntargets; tower operators also saw lights, and jet fighters were\r\nbrought in.\r\n\r\nBut nobody bothered to tell Air Force Intelligence about the\r\nsighting. When reporters began to call intelligence and ask about the\r\nbig sighting behind the headlines, INTERCEPTORS CHASE FLYING SAUCERS\r\nOVER WASHINGTON, D.C., they were told that no one had ever heard of\r\nsuch a sighting. In the next edition the headlines were supplemented\r\nby, AIR FORCE WONT TALK.\r\n\r\nThus intelligence was notified about the first Washington national\r\nsighting.\r\n\r\nI heard about the sighting about ten o'clock Monday morning when\r\nColonel Donald Bower and I got off an airliner from Dayton and I\r\nbought a newspaper in the lobby of the Washington National Airport\r\nTerminal Building. I called the Pentagon from the airport and talked\r\nto Major Dewey Fournet, but all he knew was what he'd read in the\r\npapers. He told me that he had called the intelligence officer at\r\nBolling AFB and that he was making an investigation. We would get a\r\npreliminary official report by noon.\r\n\r\nIt was about 1:00P.M. when Major Fournet called me and said that the\r\nintelligence officer from Bolling was in his office with the\r\npreliminary report on the sightings. I found Colonel Bower, we went\r\nup to Major Fournet's office and listened to the intelligence\r\nofficer's briefing.\r\n\r\nThe officer started by telling us about the location of the radars\r\ninvolved in the incident. Washington National Airport, which is\r\nlocated about three miles south of the heart of the city, had two\r\nradars. One was a long-range radar in the Air Route Traffic Control\r\nsection. This radar had 100-mile range and was used to control all\r\nair traffic approaching Washington. It was known as the ARTC radar.\r\nThe control tower at National Airport had a shorter-range radar that\r\nit used to control aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the airport.\r\nBolling AFB, he said, was located just east of National Airport,\r\nacross the Potomac River. Ten miles farther east, in almost a direct\r\nline with National and Bolling, was Andrews AFB. It also had a short-\r\nrange radar. All of these airfields were linked together by an\r\nintercom system.\r\n\r\nThen the intelligence officer went on to tell about the sighting.\r\n\r\nWhen a new shift took over at the ARTC radar room at National\r\nAirport, the air traffic was light so only one man was watching the\r\nradarscope. The senior traffic controller and the six other traffic\r\ncontrollers on the shift were out of the room at eleven-forty, when\r\nthe man watching the radarscope noticed a group of seven targets\r\nappear. From their position on the scope he knew that they were just\r\neast and a little south of Andrews AFB. In a way the targets looked\r\nlike a formation of slow airplanes, but no formations were due in the\r\narea. As he watched, the targets loafed along at 100 to 130 miles an\r\nhour; then in an apparent sudden burst of speed two of them streaked\r\nout of radar range. These were no airplanes, the man thought, so he\r\nlet out a yell for the senior controller. The senior controller took\r\none look at the scope and called in two more of the men. They all\r\nagreed that these were no airplanes. The targets could be caused by a\r\nmalfunction in the radar, they thought, so a technician was called in\r\n--the set was in perfect working order.\r\n\r\nThe senior controller then called the control tower at National\r\nAirport; they reported that they also had unidentified targets on\r\ntheir scopes, so did Andrews. And both of the other radars reported\r\nthe same slow speeds followed by a sudden burst of speed. One target\r\nwas clocked at 7,000 miles an hour. By now the targets had moved into\r\nevery sector of the scope and had flown through the prohibited flying\r\nareas over the White House and the Capitol.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the night the targets passed close to\r\ncommercial airliners in the area and on two occasions the pilots of\r\nthe airliners saw lights that they couldn't identify, and the lights\r\nwere in the same spots where the radar showed UFO's to be. Other\r\npilots to whom the ARTC radar men talked on the radio didn't see\r\nanything odd, at least that's what they said, but the senior\r\ncontroller knew airline pilots and knew that they were very reluctant\r\nto report UFO's.\r\n\r\nThe first sighting of a light by an airline pilot took place shortly\r\nafter midnight, when an ARTC controller called the pilot of a Capital\r\nAirlines flight just taking off from National. The controller asked\r\nthe pilot to keep watch for unusual lights--or anything. Soon after\r\nthe pilot cleared the traffic pattern, and while ARTC was still in\r\ncontact with him, he suddenly yelled, \"There's one--off to the right--\r\nand there it goes.\" The controller had been watching the scope, and a\r\ntarget that had been off to the right of the Capitaliner was gone.\r\n\r\nDuring the next fourteen minutes this pilot reported six more\r\nidentical lights.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours later another pilot, approaching National Airport\r\nfrom the south, excitedly called the control tower to report that a\r\nlight was following him at \"eight o'clock level.\" The tower checked\r\ntheir radar-scope and there was a target behind and to the left of\r\nthe airliner. The ARTC radar also had the airliner and the UFO\r\ntarget. The UFO tagged along behind and to the left of the airliner\r\nuntil it was within four miles of touchdown on the runway. When the\r\npilot reported the light was leaving, the two radarscopes showed that\r\nthe target was pulling away from the airliner.\r\n\r\nOnce during the night all three radars, the two at Washington and\r\nthe one at Andrews AFB, picked up a target three miles north of the\r\nRiverdale Radio beacon, north of Washington. For thirty seconds the\r\nthree radar operators compared notes about the target over the\r\nintercom, then suddenly the target was gone--and it left all three\r\nradarscopes simultaneously.\r\n\r\nBut the clincher came in the wee hours of the morning, when an ARTC\r\ntraffic controller called the control tower at Andrews AFB and told\r\nthe tower operators that ARTC had a target just south of their tower,\r\ndirectly over the Andrews Radio range station. The tower operators\r\nlooked and there was a \"huge fiery-orange sphere\" hovering in the sky\r\ndirectly over their range station.\r\n\r\nNot too long after this excitement had started, in fact just after\r\nthe technician had checked the radar and found that the targets\r\nweren't caused by a radar malfunction, ARTC had called for Air Force\r\ninterceptors to come in and look around. But they didn't show, and\r\nfinally ARTC called again--then again. Finally, just about daylight,\r\nan F-94 arrived, but by that time the targets were gone. The F-94\r\ncrew searched the area for a few minutes but they couldn't find\r\nanything unusual so they returned to their base.\r\n\r\nSo ended phase one of the Washington National Sightings.\r\n\r\nThe Bolling AFB intelligence officer said he would write up the\r\ncomplete report and forward it to ATIC.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon things bustled in the Pentagon. Down on the first\r\nfloor Al Chop was doing his best to stave off the press while up on\r\nthe fourth floor intelligence officers were holding some serious\r\nconferences. There was talk of temperature inversions and the false\r\ntargets they could cause; but the consensus was that a good radar\r\noperator could spot inversion-caused targets, and the traffic\r\ncontrollers who operated the radar at Washington National Airport\r\nweren't just out of radar school. Every day the lives of thousands of\r\npeople depended upon their interpretation of the radar targets they\r\nsaw on their scopes. And you don't get a job like this unless you've\r\nspent a good many years watching a luminous line paint targets on a\r\ngood many radarscopes. Targets caused by inversions aren't rare--in\r\nthe years that these men had been working with radar they had\r\nundoubtedly seen every kind of target, real or false, that radar can\r\ndetect. They had told the Bolling AFB intelligence officer that the\r\ntargets they saw were caused by the radar waves' bouncing off a hard,\r\nsolid object. The Air Force radar operator at Andrews backed them up;\r\nso did two veteran airline pilots who saw lights right where the\r\nradar showed a UFO to be.\r\n\r\nThen on top of all this there were the reports from the Washington\r\narea during the previous two weeks--all good--all from airline pilots\r\nor equally reliable people.\r\n\r\nTo say the least, the sighting at Washington National was a jolt.\r\n\r\nBesides trying to figure out what the Washington National UFO's\r\nwere, we had the problem of what to tell the press. They were now\r\nbeginning to put on a squeeze by threatening to call a congressman--\r\nand nothing chills blood faster in the military. They wanted some\r\nkind of an official statement and they wanted it soon. Some people in\r\nintelligence wanted to say just, \"We don't know,\" but others held out\r\nfor a more thorough investigation. I happened to be in this latter\r\ncategory. Many times in the past I had seen what first seemed to be a\r\ngood UFO report completely fall apart under a thorough investigation.\r\nI was for stalling the press and working all night if necessary to go\r\ninto every aspect of the sighting. But to go along with the theme of\r\nthe Washington National Sightings--confusion--there was a lot of talk\r\nbut no action and the afternoon passed with no further investigation.\r\n\r\nFinally about 4:00P.M. it was decided that the press, who still\r\nwanted an official comment, would get an official \"No comment\" and\r\nthat I would stay in Washington and make a more detailed investigation.\r\n\r\nI called Lieutenant Andy Flues, who was in charge of Project Blue\r\nBook while I was gone, to tell him that I was staying over and I\r\nfound out that they were in a de luxe flap back in Dayton. Reports\r\nwere pouring out of the teletype machines at the rate of thirty a day\r\nand many were as good, if not better, than the Washington incident. I\r\ntalked this over with Colonel Bower and we decided that even though\r\nthings were popping back at ATIC the Washington sighting, from the\r\nstandpoint of national interest, was more important.\r\n\r\nFeeling like a national martyr because I planned to work all night\r\nif necessary, I laid the course of my investigation. I would go to\r\nWashington National Airport, Andrews AFB, airlines offices, the\r\nweather bureau, and a half dozen other places scattered all over the\r\ncapital city. I called the transportation section at the Pentagon to\r\nget a staff car but it took me only seconds to find out that the\r\nregulations said no staff cars except for senior colonels or\r\ngenerals. Colonel Bower tried--same thing. General Samford and\r\nGeneral Garland were gone, so I couldn't get them to try to pressure\r\na staff car out of the hillbilly who was dispatching vehicles. I went\r\ndown to the finance office--could I rent a car and charge it as\r\ntravel expense? No--city buses are available. But I didn't know the\r\nbus system and it would take me hours to get to all the places I had\r\nto visit, I pleaded. You can take a cab if you want to pay for it out\r\nof your per diem was the answer. Nine dollars a day per diem and I\r\nshould pay for a hotel room, meals, and taxi fares all over the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. Besides, the lady in finance told me, my travel\r\norders to Washington covered only a visit to the Pentagon. In\r\naddition, she said, I was supposed to be on my way back to Dayton\r\nright now, and if I didn't go through all the red tape of getting the\r\norders amended I couldn't collect any per diem and technically I'd be\r\nAWOL. I couldn't talk to the finance officer, the lady informed me,\r\nbecause he always left at 4:30 to avoid the traffic and it was now\r\nexactly five o'clock and she was quitting.\r\n\r\nAt five-one I decided that if saucers were buzzing Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue in formation I couldn't care less. I called Colonel Bower,\r\nexplained my troubles, and said that I was through. He concurred, and\r\nI caught the next airliner to Dayton.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned I dropped in to see Captain Roy James in the radar\r\nbranch and told him about the sighting. He said that he thought it\r\nsounded as if the radar targets had been caused by weather but since\r\nhe didn't have the finer details he naturally couldn't make any\r\ndefinite evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe good UFO reports that Lieutenant Flues had told me about when I\r\ncalled him from Washington had tripled in number before I got around\r\nto looking at them. Our daily take had risen to forty a day, and\r\nabout a third of them were classified as unknowns.\r\n\r\nMore amber-red fights like those seen on July 18 had been observed\r\nover the Guided Missile Long-Range Proving Ground at Patrick AFB,\r\nFlorida. In Uvalde, Texas, a UFO described as \"a large, round, silver\r\nobject that spun on its vertical axis\" was seen to cross 100 degrees\r\nof afternoon sky in forty-eight seconds. During part of its flight it\r\npassed between two towering cumulus clouds. At Los Alamos and\r\nHolyoke, Massachusetts, jets had chased UFO's. In both cases the\r\nUFO's had been lost as they turned into the sun.\r\n\r\nIn two night encounters, one in New Jersey and one in Massachusetts,\r\nF-94's tried unsuccessfully to intercept unidentified lights reported\r\nby the Ground Observer Corps. In both cases the pilots of the radar-\r\nnosed jet interceptors saw a light; they closed in and their radar\r\noperators got a lock-on. But the lock-ons were broken in a few\r\nseconds, in both cases, as the light apparently took violent evasive\r\nmaneuvers.\r\n\r\nCopies of these and other reports were going to the Pentagon, and I\r\nwas constantly on the phone or having teleconferences with Major\r\nFournet.\r\n\r\nWhen the second Washington National Sighting came along, almost a\r\nweek to the hour from the first one, by a stroke of luck things\r\nweren't too fouled up. The method of reporting the sighting didn't\r\nexactly follow the official reporting procedures that are set forth\r\nin Air Force Letter 200-5, dated 5 April 1952, Subject: Reporting of\r\nUnidentified Flying Objects--but it worked.\r\n\r\nI first heard about the sighting about ten o'clock in the evening\r\nwhen I received a telephone call from Bob Ginna, _Life_ magazine's\r\nUFO expert. He had gotten the word from _Life's_ Washington News\r\nBureau and wanted a statement about what the Air Force planned to do.\r\nI decided that instead of giving a mysterious \"no comment\" I would\r\ntell the truth: \"I have no idea what the Air Force is doing; in all\r\nprobability it's doing nothing.\" When he hung up, I called the\r\nintelligence duty officer in the Pentagon and I was correct,\r\nintelligence hadn't heard about the sighting. I asked the duty\r\nofficer to call Major Fournet and ask him if he would go out to the\r\nairport, which was only two or three miles from his home. When he got\r\nthe call from the duty officer Major Fournet called Lieutenant\r\nHolcomb; they drove to the ARTC radar room at National Airport and\r\nfound Al Chop already there. So at this performance the UFO's had an\r\nofficial audience; Al Chop, Major Dewey Fournet, and Lieutenant\r\nHolcomb, a Navy electronics specialist assigned to the Air Force\r\nDirectorate of Intelligence, all saw the radar targets and heard the\r\nradio conversations as jets tried to intercept the UFO's.\r\n\r\nBeing in Dayton, 380 miles away, there wasn't much that I could do,\r\nbut I did call Captain Roy James thinking possibly he might want to\r\ntalk on the phone to the people who were watching the UFO's on the\r\nradarscopes. But Captain James has a powerful dislike for UFO's--\r\nespecially on Saturday night.\r\n\r\nAbout five o'clock Sunday morning Major Fournet called and told me\r\nthe story of the second sighting at Washington National Airport:\r\n\r\nAbout 10:30P.M. on July 26 the same radar operators who had seen the\r\nUFO's the week before picked up several of the same slow-moving\r\ntargets. This time the mysterious craft, if that is what they were,\r\nwere spread out in an arc around Washington from Herndon, Virginia,\r\nto Andrews AFB. This time there was no hesitation in following the\r\ntargets. The minute they appeared on the big 24-inch radarscope one\r\nof the controllers placed a plastic marker representing an\r\nunidentified target near each blip on the scope. When all the targets\r\nhad been carefully marked, one of the controllers called the tower\r\nand the radar station at Andrews AFB--they also had the unknown\r\ntargets.\r\n\r\nBy 11:30P.M. four or five of the targets were continually being\r\ntracked at all times, so once again a call went out for jet\r\ninterceptors. Once again there was some delay, but by midnight two F-\r\n94's from New Castle County AFB were airborne and headed south. The\r\nreporters and photographers were asked to leave the radar room on the\r\npretext that classified radio frequencies and procedures were being\r\nused in vectoring the interceptors. All civilian air traffic was\r\ncleared out of the area and the jets moved in.\r\n\r\nWhen I later found out that the press had been dismissed on the\r\ngrounds that the procedures used in an intercept were classified, I\r\nknew that this was absurd because any ham radio operator worth his\r\nsalt could build equipment and listen in on any intercept. The real\r\nreason for the press dismissal, I learned, was that not a few people\r\nin the radar room were positive that this night would be the big\r\nnight in UFO history--the night when a pilot would close in on and\r\nget a good look at a UFO--and they didn't want the press to be in on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut just as the two '94's arrived in the area the targets\r\ndisappeared from the radarscopes. The two jets were vectored into the\r\nareas where the radar had shown the last target plots, but even\r\nthough the visibility was excellent they could see nothing. The two\r\nairplanes stayed around a few minutes more, made a systematic search\r\nof the area, but since they still couldn't see anything or pick up\r\nanything on their radars they returned to their base.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the F-94's left the Washington area, the\r\nunidentified targets were back on the radarscopes in that same area.\r\n\r\nWhat neither Major Fournet nor I knew at this time was that a few\r\nminutes after the targets left the radarscopes in Washington people\r\nin the area around Langley AFB near Newport News, Virginia, began to\r\ncall Langley Tower to report that they were looking at weird bright\r\nlights that were \"rotating and giving off alternating colors.\" A few\r\nminutes after the calls began to come in, the tower operators\r\nthemselves saw the same or a similar light and they called for an\r\ninterceptor.\r\n\r\nAn F-94 in the area was contacted and visually vectored to the light\r\nby the tower operators. The F-94 saw the light and started toward it,\r\nbut suddenly it went out, \"like somebody turning off a light bulb.\"\r\nThe F-94 crew continued their run and soon got a radar lock-on, but\r\nit was broken in a few seconds as the target apparently sped away.\r\nThe fighter stayed in the area for several more minutes and got two\r\nmore lock-ons, only to have them also broken after a few seconds.\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the F-94 over Newport News had the last lock-on\r\nbroken, the targets came back on the scopes at Washington National.\r\n\r\nWith the targets back at Washington the traffic controller again\r\ncalled Air Defense Command, and once again two F-94's roared south\r\ntoward Washington. This time the targets stayed on the radarscopes\r\nwhen the airplanes arrived.\r\n\r\nThe controllers vectored the jets toward group after group of\r\ntargets, but each time, before the jets could get close enough to see\r\nanything more than just a light, the targets had sped away. Then one\r\nstayed put. The pilot saw a light right where the ARTC radar said a\r\ntarget was located; he cut in the F-94's afterburner and went after\r\nit, but just like the light that the F-94 had chased near Langley\r\nAFB, this one also disappeared. All during the chase the radar\r\noperator in the F-94 was trying to get the target on his set but he\r\nhad no luck.\r\n\r\nAfter staying in the area about twenty minutes, the jets began to\r\nrun low on fuel and returned to their base. Minutes later it began to\r\nget light, and when the sun came up all the targets were gone.\r\n\r\nEarly Sunday morning, in an interview with the press, the Korean\r\nveteran who piloted the F-94, Lieutenant William Patterson, said:\r\n\r\nI tried to make contact with the bogies below 1,000 feet, but they\r\n[the radar controllers] vectored us around. I saw several bright\r\nlights. I was at my maximum speed, but even then I had no closing\r\nspeed. I ceased chasing them because I saw no chance of overtaking\r\nthem. I was vectored into new objects. Later I chased a single bright\r\nlight which I estimated about 10 miles away. I lost visual contact\r\nwith it about 2 miles.\r\n\r\nWhen Major Fournet finished telling me about the night's activity,\r\nmy first question was, \"How about the radar targets--could they have\r\nbeen caused by weather?\"\r\n\r\nI knew that Lieutenant Holcomb was a sharp electronics man and that\r\nMajor Fournet, although no electronics specialist, was a crackerjack\r\nengineer, so their opinion meant a lot.\r\n\r\nDewey said that everybody in the radar room was convinced that the\r\ntargets were very probably caused by solid metallic objects. There\r\nhad been weather targets on the scope too, he said, but these were\r\ncommon to the Washington area and the controllers were paying no\r\nattention to them.\r\n\r\nAnd this something solid could poke along at 100 miles an hour or\r\noutdistance a jet, I thought to myself.\r\n\r\nI didn't ask Dewey any more because he'd been up all night and\r\nwanted to get to bed.\r\n\r\nMonday morning Major Ed Gregory, another intelligence officer at\r\nATIC, and I left for Washington, but our flight was delayed in Dayton\r\nso we didn't arrive until late afternoon. On the way through the\r\nterminal building to get a cab downtown, I picked up the evening\r\npapers. Every headline was about the UFO's:\r\n\r\nFIERY OBJECTS OUTRUN JETS OVER CAPITAL--INVESTIGATION VEILED IN\r\nSECRECY FOLLOWING VAIN CHASE\r\n\r\nJETS ALERTED FOR SAUCERS--INTERCEPTORS CHASE LIGHTS IN D.C. SKIES\r\n\r\nEXPERT HERE TO PUSH STUDY AS OBJECTS IN SKIES REPORTED AGAIN\r\n\r\nI jokingly commented about wondering who the expert was. In a half\r\nhour I found out--I was. When Major Gregory and I walked into the\r\nlobby of the Roger Smith Hotel to check in, reporters and\r\nphotographers rose from the easy chairs and divans like a covey of\r\nquail. They wanted my secrets, but I wasn't going to tell nor would I\r\npose for pictures while I wasn't telling anything. Newspaper\r\nreporters are a determined lot, but Greg ran interference and we\r\nreached the elevator without even a \"no comment.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day was one of confusion. After the first Washington\r\nsighting the prevailing air in the section of the Pentagon's fourth\r\nfloor, which is occupied by Air Force Intelligence, could be\r\ndescribed as excitement, but this day it was confusion. There was a\r\nmaximum of talk and a minimum of action. Everyone agreed that both\r\nsightings should be thoroughly investigated, but nobody did anything.\r\nMajor Fournet and I spent the entire morning \"just leaving\" for\r\nsomewhere to investigate \"something.\" Every time we would start to\r\nleave, something more pressing would come up.\r\n\r\nAbout 10:00A.M. the President's air aide, Brigadier General Landry,\r\ncalled intelligence at President Truman's request to find out what\r\nwas going on. Somehow I got the call. I told General Landry that the\r\nradar target could have been caused by weather but that we had no\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nTo add to the already confused situation, new UFO reports were\r\ncoming in hourly. We kept them quiet mainly because we weren't able\r\nto investigate them right away, or even confirm the facts. And we\r\nwanted to confirm the facts because some of the reports, even though\r\nthey were from military sources, were difficult to believe.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Washington sightings in only a very few of the many\r\ninstances in which radar had picked up UFO targets had the targets\r\nthemselves supposedly been seen visually. Radar experts had\r\ncontinually pointed out this fact to us as an indication that maybe\r\nall of the radar targets were caused by freak weather conditions. \"If\r\npeople had just seen a light, or an object, near where the radar\r\nshowed the UFO target to be, you would have a lot more to worry\r\nabout,\" radar technicians had told me many times.\r\n\r\nNow people were seeing the same targets that the radars were picking\r\nup, and not just at Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the same night as the second Washington sighting we had a really\r\ngood report from California. An ADC radar had picked up an\r\nunidentified target and an F-94C had been scrambled. The radar\r\nvectored the jet interceptor into the target, the radar operator in\r\nthe '94 locked-on to it, and as the airplane closed in the pilot and\r\nRO saw that they were headed directly toward a large, yellowish-\r\norange light. For several minutes they played tag with the UFO. Both\r\nthe radar on the ground and the radar in the F-94 showed that as soon\r\nas the airplane would get almost within gunnery range of the UFO it\r\nwould suddenly pull away at a terrific speed. Then in a minute or two\r\nit would slow down enough to let the F-94 catch it again.\r\n\r\nWhen I talked to the F-94 crew on the phone, the pilot said that\r\nthey felt as if this were just a big aerial cat-and-mouse game--and\r\nthey didn't like it--at any moment they thought the cat might have\r\npounced.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this was an unknown.\r\n\r\nAbout midmorning on Tuesday, July 29th, Major General John Samford\r\nsent word down that he would hold a press conference that afternoon\r\nin an attempt to straighten out the UFO situation with the press.\r\n\r\nDonald Keyhoe reports on the press conference and the events leading\r\nup to it in detail in his book, _Flying_ _Saucers_ _from_ _Outer_\r\n_Space_. He indicates that before the conference started, General\r\nSamford sat behind his big walnut desk in Room 3A138 in the Pentagon\r\nand battled with his conscience. Should he tell the public \"the real\r\ntruth\"--that our skies are loaded with spaceships? No, the public\r\nmight panic. The only answer would be to debunk the UFO's.\r\n\r\nThis bit of reporting makes Major Keyhoe the greatest journalist in\r\nhistory. This beats wire tapping. He reads minds. And not only that,\r\nhe can read them right through the walls of the Pentagon. But I'm\r\nglad that Keyhoe was able to read the General's mind and that he\r\nwrote the true and accurate facts about what he was really thinking\r\nbecause I spent quite a bit of time talking to the General that day\r\nand he sure fooled me. I had no idea he was worried about what he\r\nshould tell the public.\r\n\r\nWhen the press conference, which was the largest and longest the Air\r\nForce had held since World War II, convened at 4:00P.M., General\r\nSamford made an honest effort to straighten out the Washington\r\nNational Sightings, but the cards were stacked against him before he\r\nstarted. He had to hedge on many answers to questions from the press\r\nbecause he didn't know the answers. This hedging gave the impression\r\nthat he was trying to cover up something more than just the fact that\r\nhis people had fouled up in not fully investigating the sightings.\r\nThen he had brought in Captain Roy James from ATIC to handle all the\r\nqueries about radar. James didn't do any better because he'd just\r\narrived in Washington that morning and didn't know very much more\r\nabout the sightings than he'd read in the papers. Major Dewey Fournet\r\nand Lieutenant Holcomb, who had been at the airport during the\r\nsightings, were extremely conspicuous by their absence, especially\r\nsince it was common knowledge among the press that they weren't\r\nconvinced the UFO's picked up on radars were weather targets.\r\n\r\nBut somehow out of this chaotic situation came exactly the result\r\nthat was intended--the press got off our backs. Captain James's\r\nanswers about the possibility of the radar targets' being caused by\r\ntemperature inversions had been construed by the press to mean that\r\nthis was the Air Force's answer, even though today the twin sightings\r\nare still carried as unknowns.\r\n\r\nThe next morning headlines from Bangor to Bogota read:\r\n\r\nAIR FORCE DEBUNKS SAUCERS AS JUST NATURAL PHENOMENA\r\n\r\nThe Washington National Sightings proved one thing, something that\r\nmany of us already knew: in order to forestall any more trouble\r\nsimilar to what we'd just been through we always had to get all of\r\nthe facts and not try to hide them. A great deal of the press's\r\ninterest was caused by the Air Force's reluctance to give out any\r\ninformation, and the reluctance on the part of the Air Force was\r\ncaused by simply not having gone out to find the answers.\r\n\r\nBut had someone gone out and made a more thorough investigation a\r\nfew big questions would have popped up and taken some of the intrigue\r\nout of the two reports. It took me a year to put the question marks\r\ntogether because I just picked up the information as I happened to\r\nrun across it, but it could have been collected in a day of\r\nconcentrated effort.\r\n\r\nThere was some doubt about the visual sighting of the \"large fiery-\r\norange-colored sphere\" that the tower operators at Andrews AFB saw\r\nwhen the radar operators at National Airport told them they had a\r\ntarget over the Andrews Radio range station. When the tower operators\r\nwere later interrogated they completely changed their story and said\r\nthat what they saw was merely a star. They said that on the night of\r\nthe sighting they \"had been excited.\" (According to astronomical\r\ncharts, there were no exceptionally bright stars where the UFO was\r\nseen over the range station, however. And I heard from a good source\r\nthat the tower men had been \"persuaded\" a bit.)\r\n\r\nThen the pilot of the F-94C changed his mind even after he'd given\r\nthe press and later told me his story about vainly trying to\r\nintercept unidentified lights. In an official report he says that all\r\nhe saw was a ground light reflecting off a layer of haze.\r\n\r\nAnother question mark arose about the lights that the airline pilots\r\nsaw. Months after the sighting I heard from one of the pilots whom\r\nthe ARTC controllers called to learn if he could see a UFO. This\r\nman's background was also impressive, he had been flying in and out\r\nof Washington since 1936. This is what he had to say:\r\n\r\nThe most outstanding incident happened just after a take-off one\r\nnight from Washington National. The tower man advised us that there\r\nwas a UFO ahead of us on the take-off path and asked if we would aid\r\nin tracking it down. We were given headings to follow and shortly we\r\nwere advised that we had passed the UFO and would be given a new\r\nheading. None of us in the cockpit had seen anything unusual. Several\r\nruns were made; each time the tower man advised us we were passing\r\nthe UFO we noticed that we were over one certain section of the\r\nPotomac River, just east of Alexandria. Finally we were asked to\r\nvisually check the terrain below for anything which might cause such\r\nan illusion. We looked and the only object we could see where the\r\nradar had a target turned out to be the Wilson Lines moonlight\r\nsteamboat trip to Mount Vernon. Whether there was an altitude gimmick\r\non the radar unit at the time I do not know but the radar was sure as\r\nhell picking up the steamboat.\r\n\r\nThe pilot went on to say that there is such a conglomeration of\r\nlights around the Washington area that no matter where you look you\r\nsee a \"mysterious light.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was another point: although the radars at Washington\r\nNational and Andrews overlap, and many of the targets appeared in the\r\noverlap area, only once did the three radars simultaneously pick up a\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nThe investigation brought out a few more points on the pro side too.\r\nWe found out that the UFO's frequently visited Washington. On May 23\r\nfifty targets had been tracked from 8:00 p.m. till midnight. They\r\nwere back on the Wednesday night between the two famous Saturday-\r\nnight sightings, the following Sunday night, and again the night of\r\nthe press conference; then during August they were seen eight more\r\ntimes. On several occasions military and civilian pilots saw lights\r\nexactly where the radar showed the UFO's to be.\r\n\r\nOn each night that there was a sighting there was a temperature\r\ninversion but it was never strong enough to affect the radar the way\r\ninversions normally do. On each occasion I checked the strength of\r\nthe inversion according to the methods used by the Air Defense\r\nCommand Weather Forecast Center.\r\n\r\nThen there was another interesting fact: hardly a night passed in\r\nJune, July, and August in 1952 that there wasn't an inversion in\r\nWashington, yet the slow-moving, \"solid\" radar targets appeared on\r\nonly a few nights.\r\n\r\nBut the one big factor on the pro side of the question is the people\r\ninvolved--good radar men--men who deal in human lives. Each day they\r\nuse their radar to bring thousands of people into Washington National\r\nAirport and with a responsibility like this they should know a real\r\ntarget from a weather target.\r\n\r\nSo the Washington National Airport Sightings are still unknowns.\r\n\r\nHad the press been aware of some of the other UFO activity in the\r\nUnited States during this period, the Washington sightings might not\r\nhave been the center of interest. True, they could be classed as good\r\nreports but they were not the best that we were getting. In fact,\r\nless than six hours after the ladies and gentlemen of the press said\r\n\"Thank you\" to General Samford for his press conference, and before\r\nthe UFO's could read the newspapers and find out that they were\r\nnatural phenomena, one of them came down across the Canadian border\r\ninto Michigan. The incident that occurred that night was one of those\r\nthat even the most ardent skeptic would have difficulty explaining.\r\nI've heard a lot of them try and I've heard them all fail.\r\n\r\nAt nine-forty on the evening of the twenty-ninth an Air Defense\r\nCommand radar station in central Michigan started to get plots on a\r\ntarget that was coming straight south across Saginaw Bay on Lake\r\nHuron at 625 miles an hour. A quick check of flight plans on file\r\nshowed that it was an unidentified target.\r\n\r\nThree F-94's were in the area just northeast of the radar station,\r\nso the ground controller called one of the F-94's and told the pilot\r\nto intercept the unidentified target. The F-94 pilot started climbing\r\nout of the practice area on an intercept heading that the ground\r\ncontroller gave him. When the F-94 was at 20,000 feet, the ground\r\ncontroller told the pilot to turn to the right and he would be on the\r\ntarget. The pilot started to bring the F-94 around and at that\r\ninstant both he and the radar operator in the back seat saw that they\r\nwere turning toward a large bluish-white light, \"many times larger\r\nthan a star.\" In the next second or two the light \"took on a reddish\r\ntinge, and slowly began to get smaller, as if it were moving away.\"\r\nJust then the ground controller called and said that he still had\r\nboth the F-94 and the unidentified target on his scope and that the\r\ntarget had just made a tight 180-degree turn. The turn was too tight\r\nfor a jet, and at the speed the target was traveling it would have to\r\nbe a jet if it were an airplane. Now the target was heading back\r\nnorth. The F-94 pilot gave the engine full power and cut in the\r\nafterburner to give chase. The radar operator in the back seat got a\r\ngood radar lock-on. Later he said, \"It was just as solid a lock-on as\r\nyou get from a B-36.\" The object was at 4 miles range and the F-94\r\nwas closing slowly. For thirty seconds they held the lock-on; then,\r\njust as the ground controller was telling the pilot that he was\r\nclosing in, the light became brighter and the object pulled away to\r\nbreak the lock-on. Without breaking his transmission, the ground\r\ncontroller asked if the radar operator still had the lock-on because\r\non the scope the distance between two blips had almost doubled in one\r\nsweep of the antenna. This indicated that the unknown target had\r\nalmost doubled its speed in a matter of seconds.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes the ground radar followed the chase. At times the\r\nunidentified target would slow down and the F-94 would start to close\r\nthe gap, but always, just as the F-94 was getting within radar range,\r\nthe target would put on a sudden burst of speed and pull away from\r\nthe pursuing jet. The speed of the UFO--for by this time all\r\nconcerned had decided that was what it was--couldn't be measured too\r\naccurately because its bursts of speed were of such short duration;\r\nbut on several occasions the UFO traveled about 4 miles in one ten-\r\nsecond sweep of the antenna, or about 1,400 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe F-94 was getting low on fuel, and the pilot had to break off the\r\nchase a minute or two before the UFO got out of range of the ground\r\nradar. The last few plots on the UFO weren't too good but it looked\r\nas if the target slowed down to 200 to 300 miles an hour as soon as\r\nthe F-94 turned around.\r\n\r\nWhat was it? It obviously wasn't a balloon or a meteor. It might\r\nhave been another airplane except that in 1952 there was nothing\r\nflying, except a few experimental airplanes that were far from\r\nMichigan, that could so easily outdistance an F-94. Then there was\r\nthe fact that radar clocked it at 1,400 miles an hour. The F-94 was\r\nheading straight for the star Capella, which is low on the horizon\r\nand is very brilliant, but what about the radar contacts? Some people\r\nsaid \"Weather targets,\" but the chances of a weather target's making\r\na 180-degree turn just as an airplane turns into it, giving a radar\r\nlock-on, then changing speed to stay just out of range of the\r\nairplane's radar, and then slowing down when the airplane leaves is\r\nas close to nil as you can get.\r\n\r\nWhat was it? A lot of people I knew were absolutely convinced this\r\nreport was the key--the final proof. Even if all of the thousands of\r\nother UFO reports could be discarded on a technicality, this one\r\ncouldn't be. These people believed that this report in itself was\r\nproof enough to officially accept the fact that UFO's were\r\ninterplanetary spaceships. And when some people refused to believe\r\neven this report, the frustration was actually pitiful to see.\r\n\r\nAs the end of July approached, there was a group of officers in\r\nintelligence fighting hard to get the UFO \"recognized.\" At ATIC,\r\nProject Blue Book was still trying to be impartial--but sometimes it\r\nwas difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\r\n\r\nHoax or Horror?\r\n\r\nTo the military and the public who weren't intimately associated\r\nwith the higher levels of Air Force Intelligence during the summer of\r\n1952--and few were--General Samford's press conference seemed to\r\nindicate the peak in official interest in flying saucers. It did take\r\nthe pressure off Project Blue Book--reports dropped from fifty per\r\nday to ten a day inside of a week--but behind the scenes the press\r\nconference was only the signal for an all-out drive to find out more\r\nabout the UFO. Work on the special cameras continued on a high-\r\npriority basis, and General Samford directed us to enlist the aid of\r\ntop-ranking scientists.\r\n\r\nDuring the past four months we had collected some 750 comparatively\r\nwell-documented reports, and we hoped that something in these reports\r\nmight give us a good lead on the UFO. My orders were to tell the\r\nscientists to whom we talked that the Air Force was officially still\r\nvery much interested in the UFO and that their assistance, even if it\r\nwas only in giving us ideas and comments on the reports, was badly\r\nneeded. Although the statement of the problem was worded much more\r\nloosely, in essence it was, \"Do the UFO reports we have collected\r\nindicate that the earth is being visited by a people from another\r\nplanet?\"\r\n\r\nSuch questions had been asked of the scientists before, but not in\r\nsuch a serious vein.\r\n\r\nThen a secondary program was to be started, one of \"educating\" the\r\nmilitary. The old idea that UFO reports would die out when the thrill\r\nwore off had long been discarded. We all knew that UFO reports would\r\ncontinue to come in and that in order to properly evaluate them we\r\nhad to have every shred of evidence. The Big Flap had shown us that\r\nour chances of getting a definite answer on a sighting was directly\r\nproportional to the quality of the information we received from the\r\nintelligence officers in the field.\r\n\r\nBut soon after the press conference we began to get wires from\r\nintelligence officers saying they had interpreted the newspaper\r\naccounts of General Samford's press conference to mean that we were\r\nno longer interested in UFO reports. A few other intelligence\r\nofficers had evidently also misinterpreted the general's remarks\r\nbecause their reports of excellent sightings were sloppy and\r\nincomplete. All of this was bad, so to forestall any misconceived\r\nideas about the future of the Air Force's UFO project, summaries of\r\nGeneral Samford's press conference were distributed to intelligence\r\nofficers. General Samford had outlined the future of the UFO project\r\nwhen he'd said:\r\n\r\n\"So our present course of action is to continue on this problem with\r\nthe best of our ability, giving it the attention that we feel it very\r\ndefinitely warrants. We will give it adequate attention, but not\r\nfrantic attention.\"\r\n\r\nThe summary of the press conference straightened things out to some\r\nextent and our flow of reports got back to normal.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to start enlisting the aid of scientists, as General\r\nSamford had directed, but before this could be done we had a backlog\r\nof UFO reports that had to be evaluated. During July we had been\r\nswamped and had picked off only the best ones. Some of the reports we\r\nwere working on during August had simple answers, but many were\r\nunknowns. There was one report that was of special interest because\r\nit was an excellent example of how a UFO report can at first appear\r\nto be absolutely unsoluble then suddenly fall apart under thorough\r\ninvestigation. It also points up the fact that our investigation and\r\nanalysis were thorough and that when we finally stamped a report\r\n\"Unknown\" it was unknown. We weren't infallible but we didn't often\r\nlet a clue slip by.\r\n\r\nAt exactly ten forty-five on the morning of August 1, 1952, an ADC\r\nradar near Bellefontaine, Ohio, picked up a high-speed unidentified\r\ntarget moving southwest, just north of Dayton. Two F-86's from the\r\n97th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Wright-Patterson were scrambled\r\nand in a few minutes they were climbing out toward where the radar\r\nshowed the UFO to be. The radar didn't have any height-finding\r\nequipment so all that the ground controller at the radar site could\r\ndo was to get the two F-86's over or under the target, and then they\r\nwould have to find it visually.\r\n\r\nWhen the two airplanes reached 30,000 feet, the ground controller\r\ncalled them and told them that they were almost on the target, which\r\nwas still continuing its southwesterly course at about 525 miles an\r\nhour. In a few seconds the ground controller called back and told the\r\nlead pilot that the targets of his airplane and the UFO had blended\r\non the radar-scope and that the pilot would have to make a visual\r\nsearch; this was as close in as radar could get him. Then the radar\r\nbroke down and went off the air.\r\n\r\nBut at almost that exact second the lead pilot looked up and there\r\nin the clear blue sky several thousand feet above him was a silver-\r\ncolored sphere. The lead pilot pointed it out to his wing man and\r\nboth of them started to climb. They went to their maximum altitude\r\nbut they couldn't reach the UFO. After ten minutes of unsuccessful\r\nattempts to identify the huge silver sphere or disk--because at times\r\nit looked like a disk--one of the pilots hauled the nose of his F-86\r\nup in a stall and exposed several feet of gun camera film. Just as he\r\ndid this the warning light on his radar gun sight blinked on,\r\nindicating that something solid was in front of him--he wasn't\r\nphotographing a sundog, hallucination, or refracted light.\r\n\r\nThe two pilots broke off the intercept and started back to Wright-\r\nPatterson when they suddenly realized that they were still northwest\r\nof the base, in almost the same location they had been when they\r\nstarted the intercept ten minutes before. The UFO had evidently\r\nslowed down from the speed that the radar had measured, 525 miles an\r\nhour, until it was hovering almost completely motionless.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the pilots were on the ground, the magazine of film from\r\nthe gun camera was rushed to the photo lab and developed. The photos\r\nshowed only a round, indistinct blob--no details--but they were proof\r\nthat some type of unidentified flying object had been in the air\r\nnorth of Dayton.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Andy Flues was assigned to this one. He checked the\r\nlocations of balloons and found out that a 20-foot-diameter\r\nradiosonde weather balloon from Wright-Patterson had been very near\r\nthe area when the unsuccessful intercept took place, but the balloon\r\nwasn't traveling 525 miles an hour and it couldn't be picked up by\r\nthe ground radar, so he investigated further. The UFO couldn't have\r\nbeen another airplane because airplanes don't hover in one spot and\r\nit was no atmospheric phenomenon. Andy wrote it off as an unknown but\r\nit still bothered him; that balloon in the area was mighty\r\nsuspicious. He talked to the two pilots a half dozen times and spent\r\na day at the radar site at Bellefontaine before he reversed his\r\n\"Unknown\" decision and came up with the answer.\r\n\r\nThe unidentified target that the radar had tracked across Ohio was a\r\nlow-flying jet. The jet was unidentified because there was a mix-up\r\nand the radar station didn't get its flight plan. Andy checked and\r\nfound that a jet out of Cleveland had landed at Memphis at about\r\neleven-forty. At ten forty-five this jet would have been north of\r\nDayton on a southwesterly heading. When the ground controller blended\r\nthe targets of the two F-86's into the unidentified target, they were\r\nat 30,000 feet and were looking for the target at their altitude or\r\nhigher so they missed the low-flying jet--but they did see the\r\nballoon. Since the radar went out just as the pilots saw the balloon,\r\nthe ground controller couldn't see that the unidentified target he'd\r\nbeen watching was continuing on to the southwest. The pilots didn't\r\nbother to look around any more once they'd spotted the balloon\r\nbecause they thought they had the target in sight.\r\n\r\nThe only part of the sighting that still wasn't explained was the\r\nradar pickup on the F-86's gun sight. Lieutenant Flues checked\r\naround, did a little experimenting, and found out that the small\r\ntransmitter box on a radiosonde balloon will give an indication on\r\nthe radar used in F-86 gun sights.\r\n\r\nTo get a final bit of proof, Lieutenant Flues took the gun camera\r\nphotos to the photo lab. The two F-86's had been at about 40,000 feet\r\nwhen the photos were taken and the 20-foot balloon was at about\r\n70,000 feet. Andy's question to the photo lab was, \"How big should a\r\n20-foot balloon appear on a frame of 16-mm. movie film when the\r\nballoon is 30,000 feet away?\"\r\n\r\nThe people in the photo lab made a few calculations and measurements\r\nand came up with the answer, \"A 20-foot balloon photographed from\r\n30,000 feet away would be the same size as the UFO in the gun camera\r\nphotos.\"\r\n\r\nBy the middle of August, Project Blue Book was back to normal.\r\nLieutenant Flues's Coca-Cola consumption had dropped from twenty\r\nbottles a day in mid-July to his normal five. We were all getting a\r\ngood night's sleep and it was now a rare occasion when my home\r\ntelephone would ring in the middle of the night to report a new UFO.\r\n\r\nBut then on the morning of August 20 I was happily taking a shower,\r\ngetting ready to go to work, when one of these rare occasions\r\noccurred and the phone rang--it was the ATIC OD. An operational\r\nimmediate wire had just come in for Blue Book. He had gone over to\r\nthe message center and gotten it. He thought that it was important\r\nand wanted me to come right out. For some reason he didn't want to\r\nread it over the phone, although it was not classified. I decided\r\nthat if he said so I should come out, so I left in a hurry.\r\n\r\nThe wire was from the intelligence officer at an air base in\r\nFlorida. The previous night a scoutmaster and three boy scouts had\r\nseen a UFO. The scoutmaster had been burned when he approached too\r\nclose to the UFO. The wire went on to give a few sketchy details and\r\nstate that the scoutmaster was a \"solid citizen.\"\r\n\r\nI immediately put in a long-distance call to the intelligence\r\nofficer. He confirmed the data in the wire. He had talked briefly to\r\nthe scoutmaster on the phone and from all he could gather it was no\r\nhoax. The local police had been contacted and they verified the story\r\nand the fact of the burns. I asked the intelligence officer to\r\ncontact the scoutmaster and ask if he would submit to a physical\r\nexamination immediately. I could imagine the rumors that could start\r\nabout the scoutmaster's condition, and I wanted proof. The report\r\nsounded good, so I told the intelligence officer I'd get down to see\r\nhim as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI immediately called Colonel Dunn, then chief at ATIC, and gave him\r\na brief rundown. He agreed that I should go down to Florida as soon\r\nas possible and offered to try to get an Air Force B-25, which would\r\nsave time over the airlines.\r\n\r\nI told Bob Olsson to borrow a Geiger counter at Wright Field, then\r\ncheck out a camera. I called my wife and asked her to pack a few\r\nclothes and bring them out to me. Bob got the equipment, ran home and\r\npacked a bag, and in two hours he and I and our two pilots, Captain\r\nBill Hoey and Captain David Douglas, were on our way to Florida to\r\ninvestigate one of the weirdest UFO reports that I came up against.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, the intelligence officer arranged for the\r\nscoutmaster to come out to the air base. The latter knew we were\r\ncoming, so he arrived at the base in a few minutes. He was a very\r\npleasant chap, in his early thirties, not at all talkative but\r\napparently willing to co-operate.\r\n\r\nWhile he was giving us a brief personal history, I had the immediate\r\nimpression that he was telling the truth. He'd lived in Florida all\r\nof his life. He'd gone to a private military prep school, had some\r\ncollege, and then had joined the Marines. He told us that he had been\r\nin the Pacific most of the war and repeated some rather hairy stories\r\nof what he'd been through. After the war he'd worked as an auto\r\nmechanic, then gone to Georgia for a while to work in a turpentine\r\nplant. After returning to Florida, he opened a gas station, but some\r\nhard luck had forced him to sell out. He was now working as a clerk\r\nin a hardware store. Some months back a local church had decided to\r\norganize a boy scout troop and he had offered to be the scoutmaster.\r\n\r\nOn the night before the weekly scout meeting had broken up early. He\r\nsaid that he had offered to give four of the boys a ride home. He had\r\nlet one of the boys out when the conversation turned to a stock car\r\nrace that was to take place soon. They talked about the condition of\r\nthe track. It had been raining frequently, and they wondered if the\r\ntrack was flooded, so they drove out to look at it. Then they started\r\nsouth toward a nearby town to take another of the boys home. They\r\ntook a black-top road about 10 miles inland from the heavily traveled\r\ncoastal highway that passes through sparsely settled areas of scrub\r\npine and palmetto thickets.\r\n\r\nThey were riding along when the scoutmaster said that he noticed a\r\nlight off to his left in the pines. He slowed down and asked the boys\r\nif they'd seen it; none of them had. He started to drive on, when he\r\nsaw the lights again. This time all of the boys saw them too, so he\r\nstopped. He said that he wanted to go back into the woods to see what\r\nwas going on, but that the boys were afraid to stay alone. Again he\r\nstarted to drive on, but in a few seconds decided he had to go back.\r\nSo he turned the car around, went back, and parked beside the road at\r\na point just opposite where he'd seen the lights.\r\n\r\nI stopped him at this point to find out a little bit more about why\r\nhe'd decided to go back. People normally didn't go running off into\r\npalmetto thickets infested with rattlesnakes at night. He had a\r\nlogical answer. The lights looked like an airplane crashing into the\r\nwoods some distance away. He didn't believe that was what he saw, but\r\nthe thought that this could be a possibility bothered him. After all,\r\nhe had said, he was a scoutmaster, and if somebody was in trouble,\r\nhis conscience would have bothered him the rest of his life if he\r\nhadn't investigated and it had been somebody in need of help.\r\n\r\nA fifteen-minute radio program had just started, and he told the\r\nboys that he was going to go into the woods, and that if he wasn't\r\nback by the time the program ended they should run down the road to a\r\nfarmhouse that they had passed and get help. He got out and started\r\ndirectly into the woods, wearing a faded denim billed cap and\r\ncarrying machete and two flashlights. One of the lights was a spare\r\nhe carried in his back pocket.\r\n\r\nHe had traveled about 50 yards off the road when he ran into a\r\npalmetto thicket, so he stopped and looked for a clear path. But\r\nfinding none, he started pushing his way through the waist-high\r\ntangle of brush.\r\n\r\nWhen he stopped, he recalled later, he had first become aware of an\r\nodd odor. He couldn't exactly describe it to us, except to say that\r\nit was \"sharp\" or \"pungent.\" It was very faint, actually more like a\r\nsubconscious awareness at first. Another sensation he recalled after\r\nthe incident was a very slight difference in temperature, hardly\r\nperceivable, like walking by a brick building in the evening after\r\nthe sun has set. He hadn't thought anything about either the odor or\r\nthe heat at the time but later, when they became important, he\r\nremembered them.\r\n\r\nPaying no attention to these sensations then, he pushed on through\r\nthe brush, looking up occasionally to check the north star, so that\r\nhe could keep traveling straight east. After struggling through about\r\n30 yards of palmetto undergrowth, he noticed a change in the shadows\r\nahead of him and stopped to shine the flashlight farther ahead of him\r\nto find out if he was walking into a clearing or into one of the many\r\nponds that dot that particular Florida area. It was a clearing.\r\n\r\nThe boy scouts in the car had been watching the scoutmaster's\r\nprogress since they could see his light bobbing around. Occasionally\r\nhe would shine it up at a tree or across the landscape for an\r\ninstant, so they knew where he was in relation to the trees and\r\nthickets. They saw him stop at the edge of the open, shadowed area\r\nand shine his light ahead of him.\r\n\r\nThe scoutmaster then told us that when he stopped this second time\r\nhe first became consciously aware of the odor and the heat. Both\r\nbecame much more noticeable as he stepped into the clearing. In fact,\r\nthe heat became almost unbearable or, as he put it, \"oppressively\r\nmoist, making it hard to breathe.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked a few more paces and suddenly got a horrible feeling that\r\nsomebody was watching him. He took another step, stopped, and looked\r\nup to find the north star. But he couldn't see the north star, or any\r\nstars. Then he suddenly saw that almost the whole sky was blanked out\r\nby a large dark shape about 30 feet above him.\r\n\r\nHe said that he had stood in this position for several seconds, or\r\nminutes--he didn't know how long--because now the feeling of being\r\nwatched had overcome any power of reasoning he had. He managed to\r\nstep back a few paces, and apparently got out from under the object,\r\nbecause he could see the edge of it silhouetted against the sky.\r\n\r\nAs he backed up, he said, the air became much cooler and fresher,\r\nhelping him to think more clearly. He shone his light up at the edge\r\nof the object and got a quick but good look. It was circular-shaped\r\nand slightly concave on the bottom. The surface was smooth and a\r\ngrayish color. He pointed to a gray linoleum-topped desk in the\r\nintelligence officer's room. \"Just like that,\" he said. The upper\r\npart had a dome in the middle, like a turret. The edge of the saucer-\r\nshaped object was thick and had vanes spaced about every foot, like\r\nbuckets on a turbine wheel. Between each vane was a small opening,\r\nlike a nozzle.\r\n\r\nThe next reaction that the scoutmaster recalled was one of fury. He\r\nwanted to harm or destroy whatever it was that he saw. All he had was\r\na machete, but he wanted to try to jump up and strike at whatever he\r\nwas looking at. No sooner did he get this idea than he noticed the\r\nshadows on the turret change ever so slightly and heard a sound,\r\n\"like the opening of a well-oiled safe door.\" He froze where he stood\r\nand noticed a small ball of red fire begin to drift toward him. As it\r\nfloated down it expanded into a cloud of red mist. He dropped his\r\nfight and machete, and put his arms over his face. As the mist\r\nenveloped him, he passed out.\r\n\r\nThe boy scouts, in the car, estimated that their scoutmaster had\r\nbeen gone about five minutes when they saw him stop at the edge of\r\nthe clearing, then walk on in. They saw him stop seconds later,\r\nhesitate a few more seconds, then shine the light up in the air. They\r\nthought he was just looking at the trees again. The next thing they\r\nsaid they saw was a big red ball of fire engulfing him. They saw him\r\nfall, so they spilled out of the car and took off down the road\r\ntoward the farmhouse.\r\n\r\nThe farmer and his wife had a little difficulty getting the story\r\nout of the boys, they were so excited. All they could get was\r\nsomething about the boys' scoutmaster being in trouble down the road.\r\nThe farmer called the Florida State Highway Patrol, who relayed the\r\nmessage to the county sheriff's office. In a few minutes a deputy\r\nsheriff and the local constable arrived. They picked up the scouts\r\nand drove to where their car was parked.\r\n\r\nThe scoutmaster had no idea of how long he had been unconscious. He\r\nvaguely remembered leaning against a tree, the feeling of wet, dew-\r\ncovered grass, and suddenly regaining his consciousness. His first\r\nreaction was to get out to the highway, so he started to run. About\r\nhalfway through the palmetto thicket he saw a car stop on the\r\nhighway. He ran toward it and found the deputy and constable with the\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nHe was so excited he could hardly get his story told coherently.\r\nLater the deputy said that in all his years as a law-enforcement\r\nofficer he had never seen anyone as scared as the scoutmaster was as\r\nhe came up out of the ditch beside the road and walked into the glare\r\nof the headlights. As soon as he'd told his story, they all went back\r\ninto the woods, picking their way around the palmetto thicket. The\r\nfirst thing they noticed was the flashlight, still burning, in a\r\nclump of grass. Next to it was a place where the grass was flattened\r\ndown, as if a person had been lying there. They looked around for the\r\nextra light that the scoutmaster had been carrying, but it was gone.\r\nLater searches for this missing flashlight were equally fruitless.\r\nThey marked the spot where the crushed grass was located and left.\r\nThe constable took the boy scouts home and the scoutmaster followed\r\nthe deputy to the sheriff's office. On the way to town the\r\nscoutmaster said he first noticed that his arms and face burned. When\r\nhe arrived at the sheriff's office, he found that his arms, face, and\r\ncap _were_ burned. The deputy called the Air Force.\r\n\r\nThere were six people listening to his story. Bob Olsson, the two\r\npilots, the intelligence officer, his sergeant, and I. We each had\r\npreviously agreed to pick one insignificant detail from the story and\r\nthen re-question the scoutmaster when he had finished. Our theory was\r\nthat if he had made up the story he would either repeat the details\r\nperfectly or not remember what he'd said. I'd used this many times\r\nbefore, and it was a good indicator of a lie. He passed the test with\r\nflying colors. His story sounded good to all of us.\r\n\r\nWe talked for about another hour, discussing the event and his\r\nbackground. He kept asking, \"What did I see?\"--evidently thinking\r\nthat I knew. He said that the newspapers were after him, since the\r\nsheriff's office had inadvertently leaked the story, but that he had\r\nbeen stalling them off pending our arrival. I told him it was Air\r\nForce policy to allow people to say anything they wanted to about a\r\nUFO sighting. We had never muzzled anyone; it was his choice. With\r\nthat, we thanked him, arranged to pick up the cap and machete to take\r\nback to Dayton, and sent him home in a staff car.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was getting late, but I wanted to talk to the flight\r\nsurgeon who had examined the man that morning. The intelligence\r\nofficer found him at the hospital and he said he would be right over.\r\nHis report was very thorough. The only thing he could find out of the\r\nordinary were minor burns on his arms and the back of his hands.\r\nThere were also indications that the inside of his nostrils might be\r\nburned. The degree of burn could be compared to a light sunburn. The\r\nhair had also been singed, indicating a flash heat.\r\n\r\nThe flight surgeon had no idea how this specifically could have\r\nhappened. It could have even been done with a cigarette lighter, and\r\nhe took his lighter and singed a small area of his arm to\r\ndemonstrate. He had been asked only to make a physical check, so that\r\nis what he'd done, but he did offer a suggestion. Check his Marine\r\nrecords; something didn't ring true. I didn't quite agree; the story\r\nsounded good to me.\r\n\r\nThe next morning my crew from ATIC, three people from the\r\nintelligence office, and the two law officers went out to where the\r\nincident had taken place. We found the spot where somebody had\r\napparently been lying and the scoutmaster's path through the thicket.\r\nWe checked the area with a Geiger counter, as a precautionary\r\nmeasure, not expecting to find anything; we didn't. We went over the\r\narea inch by inch, hoping to find a burned match with which a flare\r\nor fireworks could have been lighted, drippings from a flare, or\r\nanything that shouldn't have been in a deserted area of woods. We\r\nlooked at the trees; they hadn't been hit by lightning. The blades of\r\ngrass under which the UFO supposedly hovered were not burned. We\r\nfound nothing to contradict the story. We took a few photos of the\r\narea and went back to town. On the way back we talked to the\r\nconstable and the deputy. All they could do was to confirm what we'd\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nWe talked to the farmer and his wife, but they couldn't help. The\r\nfew facts that the boy scouts had given them before they had a chance\r\nto talk to their scoutmaster correlated with his story. We talked to\r\nthe scoutmaster's employer and some of his friends; he was a fine\r\nperson. We questioned people who might have been in a position to\r\nalso observe something; they saw nothing. The local citizens had a\r\ndozen theories, and we thoroughly checked each one.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't been struck by lightning. He hadn't run across a still.\r\nThere was no indication that he'd surprised a gang of illegal turtle\r\nbutcherers, smugglers, or bootleggers. There was no indication of\r\nmarsh gas or swamp fire. The mysterious blue lights in the area\r\nturned out to be a farmer arc-welding at night. The other flying\r\nsaucers were the landing lights of airplanes landing at a nearby\r\nairport.\r\n\r\nTo be very honest, we were trying to prove that this was a hoax, but\r\nwere having absolutely no success. Every new lead we dug up pointed\r\nto the same thing, a true story.\r\n\r\nWe finished our work on a Friday night and planned to leave early\r\nSaturday morning. Bob Olsson and I planned to fly back on a\r\ncommercial airliner, as the B-25 was grounded for maintenance. Just\r\nafter dinner that night I got a call from the sheriff's office. It\r\nwas from a deputy I had talked to, not the one who met the\r\nscoutmaster coming out of the woods, but another one, who had been\r\nvery interested in the incident. He had been doing a little\r\nindependent checking and found that our singed UFO observer's\r\nbackground was not as clean as he led one to believe. He had been\r\nbooted out of the Marines after a few months for being AWOL and\r\nstealing an automobile, and had spent some time in a federal\r\nreformatory in Chillicothe, Ohio. The deputy pointed out that this\r\nfact alone meant nothing but that he thought I might be interested in\r\nit. I agreed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, early, I was awakened by a phone call from the\r\nintelligence officer. The morning paper carried the UFO story on the\r\nfront page. It quoted the scoutmaster as saying that \"high brass\"\r\nfrom Washington had questioned him late into the night. There was no\r\n\"high brass,\" just four captains, a second lieutenant, and a\r\nsergeant. He knew we were from Dayton because we had discussed who we\r\nwere and where we were stationed. The newspaper story went on to say\r\nthat \"he, the scoutmaster, and the Air Force knew what he'd seen but\r\nhe couldn't tell--it would create a national panic.\" He'd also hired\r\na press agent. I could understand the \"high brass from the Pentagon\"\r\nas literary license by the press, but this \"national panic\" pitch was\r\ntoo much. I had just about decided to give up on this incident and\r\nwrite it off as \"Unknown\" until this happened. From all appearances,\r\nour scoutmaster was going to make a fast buck on his experience. Just\r\nbefore leaving for Dayton, I called Major Dewey Fournet in the\r\nPentagon and asked him to do some checking.\r\n\r\nMonday morning the machete went to the materials lab at Wright-\r\nPatterson. The question we asked was, \"Is there anything unusual\r\nabout this machete? Is it magnetized? Is it radioactive? Has it been\r\nheated?\" No knife was ever tested so thoroughly for so many things.\r\nAs in using a Geiger counter to check the area over which the UFO had\r\nhovered in the Florida woods, our idea was to investigate every\r\npossible aspect of the sighting. They found nothing, just a plain,\r\nunmagnetized, unradioactive, unheated, common, everyday knife.\r\n\r\nThe cap was sent to a laboratory in Washington, D.C., along with the\r\nscoutmaster's story. Our question here was, \"Does the cap in any way\r\n(burns, chemicals, etc.) substantiate or refute the story?\"\r\n\r\nI thought that we'd collected all the items that could be analyzed\r\nin a lab until somebody thought of one I'd missed, the most obvious\r\nof them all--soil and grass samples from under the spot where the UFO\r\nhad hovered. We'd had samples, but in the last-minute rush to get\r\nback to Dayton they had been left in Florida. I called Florida and\r\nthey were shipped to Dayton and turned over to an agronomy lab for\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the week I received a report on our ex-Marine's\r\nmilitary and reformatory records. They confirmed a few suspicions and\r\nadded new facts. They were not complimentary. The discrepancy between\r\nwhat we'd heard about the scoutmaster while we were in Florida and\r\nthe records was considered a major factor. I decided that we should\r\ngo back to Florida and try to resolve this discrepancy.\r\n\r\nSince it was hurricane season, we had to wait a few days, then sneak\r\nback between two hurricanes. We contacted a dozen people in the city\r\nwhere the scoutmaster lived. All of them had known him for some time.\r\nWe traced him from his early boyhood to the time of the sighting. To\r\nbe sure that the people we talked to were reliable, we checked on\r\nthem. The specific things we found out cannot be told since they were\r\ngiven to us in confidence, but we were convinced that the whole\r\nincident was a hoax.\r\n\r\nWe didn't talk to the scoutmaster again but we did talk to all the\r\nboy scouts one night at their scout meeting, and they retold how they\r\nhad seen their scoutmaster knocked down by the ball of fire. The\r\nnight before, we had gone out to the area of the sighting and, under\r\napproximately the same lighting conditions as existed on the night of\r\nthe sighting, had re-enacted the scene--especially the part where the\r\nboy scouts saw their scoutmaster fall, covered with red fire. We\r\nfound that not even by standing _on_ _top_ _of_ _the_ _car_ could you\r\nsee a person silhouetted in the clearing where the scoutmaster\r\nsupposedly fell. The rest of their stories fell apart to some extent\r\ntoo. They were not as positive of details as they had been previously.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to Dayton, the report on the cap had come back. The\r\npattern of the scorch showed that the hat was flat when it was\r\nscorched, but the burned holes--the lab found some minute holes we\r\nhad missed--had very probably been made by an electrical spark. This\r\nwas all the lab could find.\r\n\r\nDuring our previous visit we repeatedly asked the question, \"Was the\r\nhat burned before you went into the woods?\" and, \"Had the cap been\r\nironed?\" We had received the same answers each time: \"The hat was not\r\nburned because we [the boy scouts] were playing with it at the scout\r\nmeeting and would have noticed the burns,\" and, \"The cap was new; it\r\nhad not been washed or ironed.\" It is rumored that the cap was never\r\nreturned because it was proof of the authenticity of the sighting.\r\nThe hat wasn't returned simply because the scoutmaster said that he\r\ndidn't want it back. No secrets, no intrigue; it's as simple as that.\r\n\r\nEveryone who was familiar with the incident, except a few people in\r\nthe Pentagon, were convinced that this was a hoax until the lab\r\ncalled me about the grass samples we'd sent in. \"How did the roots\r\nget charred?\" Roots charred? I didn't even know what my caller was\r\ntalking about. He explained that when they'd examined the grass they\r\nhad knocked the dirt and sand off the roots of the grass clumps and\r\nfound them charred. The blades of grass themselves were not damaged;\r\nthey had never been heated, except on the extreme tips of the longer\r\nblades. These had evidently been bending over touching the ground and\r\nwere also charred. The lab had duplicated the charring and had found\r\nthat by placing live grass clumps in a pan of sand and dirt and\r\nheating it to about 300 degrees F. over a gas burner the charring\r\ncould be duplicated. How it was actually done outside the lab they\r\ncouldn't even guess.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we got the lab report, we checked a few possibilities\r\nourselves. There were no hot underground springs to heat the earth,\r\nno chemicals in the soil, not a thing we found could explain it. The\r\nonly way it could have been faked would have been to heat the earth\r\nfrom underneath to 300 degrees F., and how do you do this without\r\nusing big and cumbersome equipment and disturbing the ground? You\r\ncan't. Only a few people handled the grass specimens: the lab, the\r\nintelligence officer in Florida, and I. The lab wouldn't do it as a\r\njoke, then write an official report, and I didn't do it. This leaves\r\nthe intelligence officer; I'm positive that he wouldn't do it. There\r\nmay be a single answer everyone is overlooking, but as of now the\r\ncharred grass roots from Florida are still a mystery.\r\n\r\nWriting an official report on this incident was difficult. On one\r\nside of the ledger was a huge mass of circumstantial evidence very\r\nheavily weighted against the scoutmaster's story being true. On our\r\nsecond trip to Florida, Lieutenant Olsson and I heard story after\r\nstory about the man's aptitude for dreaming up tall tales. One man\r\ntold us, \"If he told me the sun was shining, I'd look up to make\r\nsure.\" There were parts of his story and those of the boy scouts that\r\ndidn't quite mesh. None of us ever believed the boy scouts were in on\r\nthe hoax. They were undoubtedly so impressed by the story that they\r\nimagined a few things they didn't actually see. The scoutmaster's\r\nburns weren't proof of anything; the flight surgeon had duplicated\r\nthese by burning his own arm with a cigarette lighter. But we didn't\r\nmake step one in proving the incident to be a hoax. We thought up\r\ndozens of ways that the man could have set up the hoax but couldn't\r\nprove one.\r\n\r\nIn the scoutmaster's favor were the two pieces of physical evidence\r\nwe couldn't explain, the holes burned in the cap and the charred\r\ngrass roots.\r\n\r\nThe deputy sheriff who had first told me about the scoutmaster's\r\nMarine and prison record had also said, \"Maybe this is the one time\r\nin his life he's telling the truth, but I doubt it.\"\r\n\r\nSo did we; we wrote off the incident as a hoax. The best hoax in UFO\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nMany people have asked why we didn't give the scoutmaster a lie\r\ndetector test. We seriously considered it and consulted some experts\r\nin this field. They advised against it. In some definite types of\r\ncases the lie detector will not give valid results. This, they\r\nthought, was one of those cases. Had we done it and had he passed on\r\nthe faulty results, the publicity would have been a headache.\r\n\r\nThere is one way to explain the charred grass roots, the burned cap,\r\nand a few other aspects of the incident. It's pure speculation; I\r\ndon't believe that it is the answer, yet it is interesting. Since the\r\nblades of the grass were not damaged and the ground had not been\r\ndisturbed, this one way is the only way (nobody has thought of any\r\nother way) the soil could have been heated. It could have been done\r\nby induction heating.\r\n\r\nTo quote from a section entitled \"Induction Heating\" from an\r\nelectrical engineering textbook:\r\n\r\nA rod of solid metal or any electrical conductor, when subjected to\r\nan alternating magnetic field, has electromotive forces set up in it.\r\nThese electromotive forces cause what are known as \"eddy currents.\" A\r\nrise in temperature results from \"eddy currents.\"\r\n\r\nInduction heating is a common method of melting metals in a foundry.\r\n\r\nReplace the \"rod of solid metal\" mentioned above with damp sand, an\r\nelectrical conductor, and assume that a something that was generating\r\na powerful alternating magnetic field was hovering over the ground,\r\nand you can explain how the grass roots were charred. To get an\r\nalternating magnetic field, some type of electrical equipment was\r\nneeded. Electricity--electrical sparks--the holes burned in the cap\r\n\"by electric sparks.\"\r\n\r\nUFO propulsion comes into the picture when one remembers Dr.\r\nEinstein's unified field theory, concerning the relationship between\r\nelectro-magnetism and gravitation.\r\n\r\nIf this alternating magnetic field can heat metal, why didn't\r\neverything the scoutmaster had that was metal get hot enough to burn\r\nhim? He had a flashlight, machete, coins in his pocket, etc. The\r\nanswer--he wasn't under the UFO for more than a few seconds. He said\r\nthat when he stopped to really look at it he had backed away from\r\nunder it. He did feel some heat, possibly radiating from the ground.\r\n\r\nTo further pursue this line of speculation, the scoutmaster\r\nrepeatedly mentioned the unusual odor near the UFO. He described it\r\nas being \"sharp\" or \"pungent.\" Ozone gas is \"sharp\" or \"pungent.\" To\r\nquote from a chemistry book, \"Ozone is prepared by passing air\r\nbetween two plates which are charged at a high electrical potential.\"\r\nElectrical equipment again. Breathing too high a concentration of\r\nozone gas will also cause you to lose consciousness.\r\n\r\nI used to try out this induction heating theory on people to get\r\ntheir reaction. I tried it out one day on a scientist from Rand. He\r\npractically leaped at the idea. I laughed when I explained that I\r\nthought this theory just _happened_ to tie together the unanswered\r\naspects of the incident in Florida and was not the answer; he was\r\nslightly perturbed. \"What do you want?\" he said. \"Does a UFO have to\r\ncome in and land on your desk at ATIC?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\r\n\r\nDigesting the Data\r\n\r\nIt was soon after we had written a finis to the Case of the\r\nScoutmaster that I went into Washington to give another briefing on\r\nthe latest UFO developments. Several reports had come in during early\r\nAugust that had been read with a good deal of interest in the\r\nmilitary and other governmental agencies. By late August 1952 several\r\ngroups in Washington were following the UFO situation very closely.\r\n\r\nThe sighting that had stirred everyone up came from Haneda AFB, now\r\nTokyo International Airport, in Japan. Since the sighting came from\r\noutside the U.S., we couldn't go out and investigate it, but the\r\nintelligence officers in the Far East Air Force had done a good job,\r\nso we had the complete story of this startling account of an\r\nencounter with a UFO. Only a few minor questions had been unanswered,\r\nand a quick wire to FEAF brought back these missing data. Normally it\r\ntook up to three months to get routine questions back and forth, but\r\nthis time the exchange of wires took only a matter of hours.\r\n\r\nSeveral months after the sighting I talked to one of the FEAF\r\nintelligence officers who had investigated it, and in his estimation\r\nit was one of the best to come out of the Far East.\r\n\r\nThe first people to see the UFO were two control tower operators who\r\nwere walking across the ramp at the air base heading toward the tower\r\nto start the midnight shift. They were about a half hour early so\r\nthey weren't in any big hurry to get up into the tower--at least not\r\nuntil they saw a large brilliant light off to the northeast over\r\nTokyo Bay. They stopped to look at the light for a few seconds\r\nthinking that it might be an exceptionally brilliant star, but both\r\nmen had spent many lonely nights in a control tower when they had\r\nnothing to look at except stars and they had never seen anything this\r\nbright before. Besides, the light was moving. The two men had lined\r\nit up with the corner of a hangar and could see that it was\r\ncontinually moving closer and drifting a little off to the right.\r\n\r\nIn a minute they had run across the ramp, up the several hundred\r\nsteps to the tower, and were looking at the light through 7x50\r\nbinoculars. Both of the men, and the two tower operators whom they\r\nwere relieving, got a good look at the UFO. The light was circular in\r\nshape and had a constant brilliance. It appeared to be the upper\r\nportion of a large, round, dark shape which was about four times the\r\ndiameter of the light itself. As they watched, the UFO moved in\r\ncloser, or at least it appeared to be getting closer because it\r\nbecame more distinct. When it moved in, the men could see a second\r\nand dimmer light on the lower edge of the dark, shadowy portion.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the UFO had moved off to the east, getting dimmer\r\nand dimmer as it disappeared. The four tower men kept watching the\r\neastern sky, and suddenly the light began to reappear. It stayed in\r\nsight a few seconds, was gone again, and then for the third time it\r\ncame back, heading toward the air base.\r\n\r\nThis time one of the tower operators picked up a microphone, called\r\nthe pilot of a C-54 that was crossing Tokyo Bay, and asked if he\r\ncould see the light. The pilot didn't see anything unusual.\r\n\r\nAt 11:45P.M., according to the logbook in the tower, one of the\r\noperators called a nearby radar site and asked if they had an\r\nunidentified target on their scopes. They did.\r\n\r\nThe FEAF intelligence officers who investigated the sighting made a\r\nspecial effort to try to find out if the radar's unidentified target\r\nand the light were the same object. They deduced that they were\r\nsince, when the tower operators and the radar operators compared\r\nnotes over the telephone, the light and the radar target were in the\r\nsame location and were moving in the same direction.\r\n\r\nFor about five minutes the radar tracked the UFO as it cut back and\r\nforth across the central part of Tokyo Bay, sometimes traveling so\r\nslowly that it almost hovered and then speeding up to 300 miles an\r\nhour. All of this time the tower operators were watching the light\r\nthrough binoculars. Several times when the UFO approached the radar\r\nstation--once it came within 10 miles--a radar operator went outside\r\nto find out if he could see the light but no one at the radar site\r\never saw it. Back at the air base the tower operators had called\r\nother people and they saw the light. Later on the tower man said that\r\nhe had the distinct feeling that the light was highly directional,\r\nlike a spotlight.\r\n\r\nSome of the people who were watching thought that the UFO might be a\r\nlighted balloon; so, for the sake of comparison, a lighted weather\r\nballoon was released. But the light on the balloon was much more\r\n\"yellowish\" than the UFO and in a matter of seconds it had traveled\r\nfar enough away that the light was no longer visible. This gave the\r\nobservers a chance to compare the size of the balloon and the size of\r\nthe dark, shadowy part of the UFO. Had the UFO been 10 miles away it\r\nwould have been 50 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThree minutes after midnight an F-94 scrambled from nearby Johnson\r\nAFB came into the area. The ground controller sent the F-94 south of\r\nYokohama, up Tokyo Bay, and brought him in \"behind\" the UFO. The\r\nsecond that the ground controller had the F-94 pilot lined up and\r\ntold him that he was in line for a radar run, the radar operator in\r\nthe rear seat of the F-94 called out that he had a lock-on. His\r\ntarget was at 6,000 yards, 10 degrees to the right and 10 degrees\r\nbelow the F-94. The lock-on was held for ninety seconds as the ground\r\ncontroller watched both the UFO and the F-94 make a turn and come\r\ntoward the ground radar site. Just as the target entered the \"ground\r\nclutter\"--the permanent and solid target near the radar station\r\ncaused by the radar beam's striking the ground--the lock-on was\r\nbroken. The target seemed to pull away swiftly from the jet\r\ninterceptor. At almost this exact instant the tower operators\r\nreported that they had lost visual contact with the UFO. The tower\r\ncalled the F-94 and asked if they had seen anything visually during\r\nthe chase--they hadn't. The F-94 crew stayed in the area ten or\r\nfifteen more minutes but couldn't see anything or pick up any more\r\ntargets on their radar.\r\n\r\nSoon after the F-94 left the area, both the ground radar and the\r\ntower operators picked up the UFO again. In about two minutes radar\r\ncalled the tower to say that their target had just \"broken into three\r\npieces\" and that the three \"pieces,\" spaced about a quarter of a mile\r\napart, were leaving the area, going northeast. Seconds later tower\r\noperators lost sight of the light.\r\n\r\nThe FEAF intelligence officers had checked every possible angle but\r\nthey could offer nothing to account for the sighting.\r\n\r\nThere were lots of opinions, weather targets for example, but once\r\nagain the chances of a weather target's being in exactly the same\r\ndirection as a bright star and having the star appear to move with\r\nthe false radar target aren't too likely--to say the least. And then\r\nthe same type of thing had happened twice before inside of a month's\r\ntime, once in California and once in Michigan.\r\n\r\nAs one of the men at the briefing I gave said, \"It's incredible, and\r\nI can't believe it, but those boys in FEAF are in a war--they're\r\nveterans--and by damn, I think they know what they're talking about\r\nwhen they say they've never seen anything like this before.\"\r\n\r\nI could go into a long discourse on the possible explanations for\r\nthis sighting; I heard many, but in the end there would be only one\r\npositive answer--the UFO could not be identified as something we knew\r\nabout. It could have been an interplanetary spaceship. Many people\r\nthought this was the answer and were all for sticking their necks out\r\nand establishing a category of conclusions for UFO reports and\r\nlabeling it spacecraft. But the majority ruled, and a UFO remained an\r\n_unidentified_ flying object.\r\n\r\nOn my next trip to the Pentagon I spent the whole day talking to\r\nMajor Dewey Fournet and two of his bosses, Colonel W. A. Adams and\r\nColonel Weldon Smith, about the UFO subject in general. One of the\r\nthings we talked about was a new approach to the UFO problem--that of\r\ntrying to prove that the motion of a UFO as it flew through the air\r\nwas intelligently controlled.\r\n\r\nI don't know who would get credit for originating the idea of trying\r\nto analyze the motion of the UFO's. It was one of those kinds of\r\nideas that are passed around, with everyone adding a few\r\nmodifications. We'd been talking about making a study of this idea\r\nfor a long time, but we hadn't had many reports to work with; but\r\nnow, with the mass of data that we had accumulated in June and July\r\nand August, the prospects of such a study looked promising.\r\n\r\nThe basic aim of the study would be to learn whether the motion of\r\nthe reported UFO's was random or ordered. Random motion is an\r\nunordered, helter-skelter motion very similar to a swarm of gnats or\r\nflies milling around. There is no apparent pattern or purpose to\r\ntheir flight paths. But take, for example, swallows flying around a\r\nchimney--they wheel, dart, and dip, but if you watch them closely,\r\nthey have a definite pattern in their movements--an ordered motion.\r\nThe definite pattern is intelligently controlled because they are\r\ncatching bugs or getting in line to go down the chimney.\r\n\r\nBy the fall of 1952 we had a considerable number of well-documented\r\nreports in which the UFO's made a series of maneuvers. If we could\r\nprove that these maneuvers were not random, but ordered, it would be\r\nproof that the UFO's were things that were intelligently controlled.\r\n\r\nDuring our discussion Major Fournet brought up two reports in which\r\nthe UFO seemed to know what it was doing and wasn't just aimlessly\r\ndarting around. One of these was the recent sighting from Haneda AFB,\r\nJapan, and the other was the incident that happened on the night of\r\nJuly 29, when an F-94 attempted to intercept a UFO over eastern\r\nMichigan. In both cases radar had established the track of the UFO.\r\n\r\nIn the Haneda Incident, according to the sketch of the UFO's track,\r\neach turn the UFO made was constant and the straight \"legs\" between\r\nthe turns were about the same length. The sketch of the UFO's flight\r\npath as it moved back and forth over Tokyo Bay reminded me very much\r\nof the \"crisscross\" search patterns we used to fly during World War\r\nII when we were searching for the crew of a ditched airplane. The\r\nonly time the UFO seriously deviated from this pattern was when the F-\r\n94 got on its tail.\r\n\r\nThe Michigan sighting was even better, however. In this case there\r\nwas a definite reason for every move that the UFO made. It made a 180-\r\ndegree turn because the F-94 was closing on it head on. It\r\nalternately increased and decreased its speed, but every time it did\r\nthis it was because the F-94 was closing in and it evidently put on\r\nspeed to pull out ahead far enough to get out of range of the F-94's\r\nradar. To say that this motion was random and that it was just a\r\ncoincidence that the UFO made the 180-degree turn when the F-94\r\nclosed in head on and that it was just a coincidence that the UFO\r\nspeeded up every time the F-94 began to get within radar range is\r\npushing the chance of coincidence pretty hard.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the motion analysis study sounded interesting to me, but\r\nwe were so busy on Project Blue Book we didn't have time to do it. So\r\nMajor Fournet offered to look into it further and I promised him all\r\nthe help we could give him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime my people in Project Blue Book were contacting\r\nvarious scientists in the U.S., and indirectly in Europe, telling\r\nthem about our data, and collecting opinions. We did this in two\r\nways. In the United States we briefed various scientific meetings and\r\ngroups. To get the word to the other countries, we enlisted the\r\ngratis aid of scientists who were planning to attend conferences or\r\nmeetings in Europe. We would brief these European-bound scientists on\r\nall of the aspects of the UFO problem so they could informally\r\ndiscuss the problem with their European colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe one thing about these briefings that never failed to amaze me,\r\nalthough it happened time and time again, was the interest in UFO's\r\nwithin scientific circles. As soon as the word spread that Project\r\nBlue Book was giving official briefings to groups with the proper\r\nsecurity clearances, we had no trouble in getting scientists to swap\r\nfree advice for a briefing. I might add that we briefed only groups\r\nwho were engaged in government work and who had the proper security\r\nclearances solely because we could discuss any government project\r\nthat might be of help to us in pinning down the UFO. Our briefings\r\nweren't just squeezed in either; in many instances we would arrive at\r\na place to find that a whole day had been set aside to talk about\r\nUFO's. And never once did I meet anyone who laughed off the whole\r\nsubject of flying saucers even though publicly these same people had\r\njovially sloughed off the press with answers of \"hallucinations,\"\r\n\"absurd,\" or \"a waste of time and money.\" They weren't wild-eyed fans\r\nbut they were certainly interested.\r\n\r\nColonel S. H. Kirkland and I once spent a whole day briefing and\r\ntalking to the Beacon Hill Group, the code name for a collection of\r\nsome of the world's leading scientists and industrialists. This\r\ngroup, formed to consider and analyze the toughest of military\r\nproblems, took a very serious interest in our project and gave much\r\ngood advice. At Los Alamos and again at Sandia Base our briefings\r\nwere given in auditoriums to standing room only crowds. In addition I\r\ngave my briefings at National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics\r\nlaboratories, at Air Research and Development centers, at Office of\r\nNaval Research facilities and at the Air Force University. Then we\r\nbriefed special groups of scientists.\r\n\r\nNormally scientists are a cautious lot and stick close to proven\r\nfacts, keeping their personal opinions confined to small groups of\r\nfriends, but when they know that there is a sign on a door that says\r\n\"Classified Briefing in Progress,\" inhibitions collapse like the\r\ntheories that explain all the UFO's away. People say just what they\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nI could jazz up this part of the UFO story as so many other\r\nhistorians of the UFO have and say that Dr. So-and-So believes that\r\nthe reported flying saucers are from outer space or that Dr. Whositz\r\nis firmly convinced that Mars is inhabited. I talked to plenty of Dr.\r\nSo-and-So's who believed that flying saucers were real and who were\r\nabsolutely convinced that other planets or bodies in the universe\r\nwere inhabited, but we were looking for proven facts and not just\r\npersonal opinions.\r\n\r\nHowever, some of the questions we asked the scientists had to be\r\nanswered by personal opinions because the exact answers didn't exist.\r\nWhen such questions came up, about all we could do was to try to get\r\nthe largest and most representative cross section of personal\r\nopinions upon which to base our decisions. In this category of\r\nquestions probably the most frequently discussed was the possibility\r\nthat other celestial bodies in the universe were populated with\r\nintelligent beings. The exact answer to this is that no one knows.\r\nBut the consensus was that it wouldn't be at all surprising.\r\n\r\nAll the briefings we were giving added to our work load because UFO\r\nreports were still coming in in record amounts. The lack of newspaper\r\npublicity after the Washington sightings had had some effect because\r\nthe number of reports dropped from nearly 500 in July to 175 in\r\nAugust, but this was still far above the normal average of twenty to\r\nthirty reports a month.\r\n\r\nSeptember 1952 started out with a rush, and for a while it looked as\r\nif UFO sightings were on the upswing again. For some reason, we never\r\ncould determine why, we suddenly began to get reports from all over\r\nthe southeastern United States. Every morning, for about a week or\r\ntwo, we'd have a half dozen or so new reports. Georgia and Alabama\r\nled the field. Many of the reports came from people in the vicinity\r\nof the then new super-hush-hush Atomic Energy Commission facility at\r\nSavannah River, Georgia. And many were coming from the port city of\r\nMobile, Alabama. Our first thought, when the reports began to pour\r\nin, was that the newspapers in these areas were possibly stirring\r\nthings up with scare stories, but our newspaper clipping service\r\ncovered the majority of the southern papers, and although we kept\r\nlooking for publicity, none showed up. In fact, the papers only\r\nbarely mentioned one or two of the sightings. As they came in, each\r\nof the sighting reports went through our identification process; they\r\nwere checked against all balloon flights, aircraft flights, celestial\r\nbodies, and the MO file, but more than half of them came out as\r\nunknowns.\r\n\r\nWhen the reports first began to come in, I had called the\r\nintelligence officers at all of the major military installations in\r\nthe Southeast unsuccessfully trying to find out if they could shed\r\nany light on the cause of the sightings. One man, the man who was\r\nresponsible for UFO reports made to Brookley AFB, just outside of\r\nMobile, Alabama, took a dim view of all of the proceedings. \"They're\r\nall nuts,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later his story changed. It seems that one night, about\r\nthe fourth night in a row that UFO's had been reported near Mobile,\r\nthis man and several of his assistants decided to try to see these\r\nfamous UFO's; about 10:00P.M., the time that the UFO's were usually\r\nreported, they were gathered around the telephone in the man's office\r\nat Brookley AFB. Soon a report came in. The first question that the\r\ninvestigator who answered the phone asked was, \"Can you still see it?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was \"Yes,\" so the officer took off to see the UFO.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened twice more, and two more officers left for\r\ndifferent locations. The fourth time the phone rang the call was from\r\nthe base radar station. They were picking up a UFO on radar, so the\r\nboss himself took off. He saw the UFO in air out over Mobile Bay and\r\nhe saw the return of the UFO on the radarscope.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he called me at ATIC and for over an hour he told\r\nme what had happened. Never have I talked to four more ardent flying\r\nsaucer believers.\r\n\r\nWe did quite a bit of work on the combination radar-visual sighting\r\nat Brookley. First of all, radar-visual sightings were the best type\r\nof UFO sightings we received. There are no explanations for how radar\r\ncan pick up a UFO target that is being watched visually at the same\r\ntime. Maybe I should have said there are no proven explanations on\r\nhow this can happen, because, like everything else associated with\r\nthe UFO, there was a theory. During the Washington National Sightings\r\nseveral people proposed the idea that the same temperature-inversion\r\nlayer that was causing the radar beam to bend down and pick up a\r\nground target was causing the target to appear to be in the air. They\r\nwent on to say that we couldn't get a radar-visual sighting unless\r\nthe ground target was a truck, car, house, or something else that was\r\nlighted and could be seen at a great distance. The second reason the\r\nBrookley AFB sighting was so interesting was that it knocked this\r\ntheory cold.\r\n\r\nThe radar at Brookley AFB was so located that part of the area that\r\nit scanned was over Mobile Bay. It was in this area that the UFO was\r\ndetected. We thought of the theory that the same inversion layer that\r\nbent the radar beam also caused the target to appear to be in the\r\nair, and we began to do a little checking. There was a slight\r\ninversion but, according to our calculations, it wasn't enough to\r\naffect the radar. More important was the fact that in the area where\r\nthe target appeared there were no targets to pick up--let alone\r\nlighted targets. We checked and rechecked and found that at the time\r\nof the sighting there were no ships, buoys, or anything else that\r\nwould give a radar return in the area of Mobile Bay in which we were\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nAlthough this sighting wasn't as glamorous as some we had, it was\r\nhighly significant because it was possible to show that the UFO\r\ncouldn't have been a lighted surface target.\r\n\r\nWhile we were investigating the sighting we talked to several\r\nelectronics specialists about our radar-visual sightings. One of the\r\nmost frequent comments we heard was, \"Why do all of these radar-\r\nvisual sightings occur at night?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was simple: they don't. On August 1, just before dawn, an\r\nADC radar station outside of Yaak, Montana, on the extreme northern\r\nborder of the United States, picked up a UFO. The report was very\r\nsimilar to the sighting at Brookley except it happened in the\r\ndaylight and, instead of seeing a light, the crew at the radar\r\nstation saw a \"dark, cigar-shaped object\" right where the radar had\r\nthe UFO pinpointed.\r\n\r\nWhat these people saw is a mystery to this day.\r\n\r\nLate in September I made a trip out to Headquarters, ADC to brief\r\nGeneral Chidlaw and his staff on the past few months' UFO activity.\r\n\r\nOur plans for periodic briefings, which we had originally set up\r\nwith ADC, had suffered a bit in the summer because we were all busy\r\nelsewhere. They were still giving us the fullest co-operation, but we\r\nhadn't been keeping them as thoroughly read in as we would have liked\r\nto. I'd finished the briefing and was eating lunch at the officers'\r\nclub with Major Verne Sadowski, Project Blue Book's liaison officer\r\nin ADC Intelligence, and several other officers. I had a hunch that\r\nsomething was bothering these people. Then finally Major Sadowski\r\nsaid, \"Look, Rupe, are you giving us the straight story on these\r\nUFO's?\"\r\n\r\nI thought he meant that I was trying to spice things up a little, so\r\nI said that since he had copies of most of our reports and had read\r\nthem, he should know that I was giving them the facts straight across\r\nthe board.\r\n\r\nThen one of the other officers at the table cut in, \"That's just the\r\npoint, we do have the reports and we have read them. None of us can\r\nunderstand why Intelligence is so hesitant to accept the fact that\r\nsomething we just don't know about is flying around in our skies--\r\nunless you are trying to cover up something big.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone at the table put in his ideas. One radar man said that he'd\r\nlooked over several dozen radar reports and that his conclusion was\r\nthat the UFO's couldn't be anything but interplanetary spaceships. He\r\nstarted to give his reasons when another radar man leaped into the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThis man said that he'd read every radar report, too, and that there\r\nwasn't one that couldn't be explained as a weather phenomenon--even\r\nthe radar-visual sightings. In fact, he wasn't even convinced that we\r\nhad ever gotten such a thing as radar-visual sighting. He wanted to\r\nsee proof that an object that was seen visually was the same object\r\nthat the radar had picked up. Did we have it?\r\n\r\nI got back into the discussion at this point with the answer. No, we\r\ndidn't have proof if you want to get technical about the degree of\r\nproof needed. But we did have reports where the radar and visual\r\nbearings of the UFO coincided almost exactly. Then we had a few\r\nreports where airplanes had followed the UFO's and the maneuvers of\r\nthe UFO that the pilot reported were the same as the maneuvers of the\r\nUFO that was being tracked by radar.\r\n\r\nA lieutenant colonel who had been sitting quietly by interjected a\r\nwell-chosen comment. \"It seems the difficulty that Project Blue Book\r\nfaces is what to accept and what not to accept as proof.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel had hit the proverbial nail on its proverbial head.\r\n\r\nThen he went on, \"Everyone has a different idea of what proof really\r\nis. Some people think we should accept a new model of an airplane\r\nafter only five or ten hours of flight testing. This is enough proof\r\nfor them that the airplane will fly. But others wouldn't be happy\r\nunless it was flight-tested for five or ten years. These people have\r\nset an unreasonably high value on the word 'proof.' The answer is\r\nsomewhere in between these two extremes.\"\r\n\r\nBut where is this point when it comes to UFO's?\r\n\r\nThere was about a thirty-second pause for thought after the\r\ncolonel's little speech. Then someone asked, \"What about these recent\r\nsightings at Mainbrace?\"\r\n\r\nIn late September 1952 the NATO naval forces had held maneuvers off\r\nthe coast of Europe; they were called Operation Mainbrace. Before\r\nthey had started someone in the Pentagon had half seriously mentioned\r\nthat Naval Intelligence should keep an eye open for UFO's, but no one\r\nreally expected the UFO's to show up. Nevertheless, once again the\r\nUFO's were their old unpredictable selves--they were there.\r\n\r\nOn September 20, a U.S. newspaper reporter aboard an aircraft\r\ncarrier in the North Sea was photographing a carrier take-off in\r\ncolor when he happened to look back down the flight deck and saw a\r\ngroup of pilots and flight deck crew watching something in the sky.\r\nHe went back to look and there was a silver sphere moving across the\r\nsky just behind the fleet of ships. The object appeared to be large,\r\nplenty large enough to show up in a photo, so the reporter shot\r\nseveral pictures. They were developed right  away and turned out to\r\nbe excellent. He had gotten the superstructure of the carrier in each\r\none and, judging by the size of the object in each successive photo,\r\none could see that it was moving rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence officers aboard the carrier studied the photos. The\r\nobject looked like a balloon. From its size it was apparent that if\r\nit were a balloon, it would have been launched from one of the ships,\r\nso the word went out on the TBS radio: \"Who launched a balloon?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer came back on the TBS: \"Nobody.\"\r\n\r\nNaval Intelligence double-checked, triple-checked and quadruple-\r\nchecked every ship near the carrier but they could find no one who\r\nhad launched the UFO.\r\n\r\nWe kept after the Navy. The pilots and the flight deck crew who saw\r\nthe UFO had mixed feelings--some were sure that the UFO was a balloon\r\nwhile others were just as sure that it couldn't have been. It was\r\ntraveling too fast, and although it resembled a balloon in some ways\r\nit was far from being identical to the hundreds of balloons that the\r\ncrew had seen the aerologists launch.\r\n\r\nWe probably wouldn't have tried so hard to get a definite answer to\r\nthe Mainbrace photos if it hadn't been for the events that took place\r\nduring the rest of the operation, I explained to the group of ADC\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe day after the photos had been taken six RAF pilots flying a\r\nformation of jet fighters over the North Sea saw something coming\r\nfrom the direction of the Mainbrace fleet. It was a shiny, spherical\r\nobject, and they couldn't recognize it as anything \"friendly\" so they\r\ntook after it. But in a minute or two they lost it. When they neared\r\ntheir base, one of the pilots looked back and saw that the UFO was\r\nnow following him. He turned but the UFO also turned, and again it\r\noutdistanced the Meteor in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nThen on the third consecutive day a UFO showed up near the fleet,\r\nthis time over Topcliffe Aerodrome in England. A pilot in a Meteor\r\nwas scrambled and managed to get his jet fairly close to the UFO,\r\nclose enough to see that the object was \"round, silvery, and white\"\r\nand seemed to \"rotate around its vertical axis and sort of wobble.\"\r\nBut before he could close in to get a really good look it was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was these sightings, I was told by an RAF exchange intelligence\r\nofficer in the Pentagon, that caused the RAF to officially recognize\r\nthe UFO.\r\n\r\nBy the time I'd finished telling about the Mainbrace Sightings, it\r\nwas after the lunch hour in the club and we were getting some get-the-\r\nhell-out-of-here looks from the waiters, who wanted to clean up the\r\ndining room. But before I could suggest that we leave, Major Sadowski\r\nrepeated his  original question--the one that started the whole\r\ndiscussion--\"Are you holding out on us?\"\r\n\r\nI gave him an unqualified \"No.\" We wanted more positive proof, and\r\nuntil we had it, UFO's would remain unidentified flying objects and\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal shaking of heads illustrated some of the group's\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nWe had plans for getting more positive proof, however, and I said\r\nthat just as soon as we returned to Major Sadowski's office I'd tell\r\nthem what we contemplated doing.\r\n\r\nWe moved out onto the sidewalk in front of the club and, after\r\ndiscussing a few more sightings, went back into the security area to\r\nSadowski's office and I laid out our plans.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in November or December the U.S. was going to shoot\r\nthe first H-bomb during Project Ivy. Although this was Top Secret at\r\nthe time, it was about the most poorly kept secret in history--\r\neverybody seemed to know all about it. Some people in the Pentagon\r\nhad the idea that there were beings, earthly or otherwise, who might\r\nbe interested in our activities in the Pacific, as they seemed to be\r\nin Operation Mainbrace. Consequently Project Blue Book had been\r\ndirected to get transportation to the test area to set up a reporting\r\nnet, brief people on how to report, and analyze their reports on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Project Blue Book was working on plans for an extensive\r\nsystem to track UFO's by instruments. Brigadier General Garland, who\r\nhad been General Samford's Deputy Director for Production and who had\r\nbeen riding herd on the UFO project for General Samford, was now\r\nchief at ATIC, having replaced Colonel Dunn, who went to the Air War\r\nCollege. General Garland had long been in favor of trying to get some\r\nconcrete information, either positive or negative, about the UFO's.\r\nThis planned tracking system would replace the defraction grid\r\ncameras that were still being developed at ATIC.\r\n\r\nThirdly, as soon as we could we were planning to gather together a\r\ngroup of scientists and let them spend a full week or two studying\r\nthe UFO problem.\r\n\r\nWhen I left ADC, Major Sadowski and crew were satisfied that we\r\nweren't just sitting around twiddling our UFO reports.\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of 1952 reports continued to drop off steadily. By\r\nDecember we were down to the normal average of thirty per month, with\r\nabout 20 per cent of these falling into the \"Unknown\" category.\r\n\r\nOur proposed trip to the Pacific to watch for UFO's during the H-\r\nbomb test was canceled at the last minute because we couldn't get\r\nspace on an airplane. But the crews of Navy and Air Force security\r\nforces who did go out to the tests were thoroughly briefed to look\r\nfor UFO's, and they were given the procedures on how to track and\r\nreport them. Back at Dayton we stood by to make quick analysis of any\r\nreports that might come in--none came. Nothing that fell into the UFO\r\ncategory was seen during the entire Project Ivy series of atomic shots.\r\n\r\nBy December work on the planning phase of our instrumentation\r\nprogram was completed. During the two months we had been working on\r\nit we had considered everything from giving Ground Observer Corps\r\nspotters simple wooden tracking devices to building special radars\r\nand cameras. We had talked over our problems with the people at\r\nWright Field who knew about missile-tracking equipment, and we had\r\nconsulted the camera technicians at the Air Force Aerial\r\nReconnaissance Laboratory. Astronomers explained their equipment and\r\nthe techniques to use, and we went to Rome, New York, and Boston to\r\nenlist the aid of the people who develop the Air Force's electronic\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nOur final plan called for visual spotting stations to be established\r\nall over northern New Mexico. We'd picked this test location because\r\nnorthern New Mexico still consistently produced more reports than any\r\nother area in the U.S. These visual spotting stations would be\r\nequipped with a sighting device similar to a gun sight on a bomber.\r\nAll the operator would have to do would be to follow the UFO with the\r\ntracking device, and the exact time and the UFO's azimuth and\r\nelevation angles would be automatically recorded. The visual spotting\r\nstations would all be tied together with an interphone system, so\r\nthat as soon as the tracker at one station saw something he could\r\nalert the other spotters in the area. If two stations tracked the\r\nsame object, we could immediately compute its speed and altitude.\r\n\r\nThis visual spotting net would be tied into the existing radar\r\ndefense net in the Albuquerque-Los Alamos area. At each radar site we\r\nproposed that a long focal-length camera be synchronized to the\r\nturning radar antenna, so that any time the operator saw a target he\r\ncould press a button and photograph the portion of the sky exactly\r\nwhere the radar said a UFO was located. These cameras would actually\r\nbe astronomical telescopes, so that even the smallest light or object\r\ncould be photographed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this photography system we proposed that a number of\r\nsets of instruments be set out around the area. Each set would\r\ncontain instruments to measure nuclear radiation, any disturbances in\r\nthe earth's magnetic field, and the passage of a body that was giving\r\noff heat. The instruments would continually be sending their\r\ninformation to a central \"UFO command post,\" which would also get\r\nreports directly from the radars and the visual spotting stations.\r\n\r\nThis instrumentation plan would cost about $250,000 because we\r\nplanned to use as much surplus equipment as possible and tie it into\r\nexisting communications systems, where they already existed. After\r\nthe setup was established, it would cost about $25,000 a year to\r\noperate. At first glance this seemed like a lot of money, but when we\r\nfigured out how much the UFO project had cost the Air Force in the\r\npast and how much it would probably cost in the future, the price\r\ndidn't seem too bad--especially if we could solve the UFO problem\r\nonce and for all.\r\n\r\nThe powers-that-be at ATIC O.K.'d the plan in December and it went\r\nto Washington, where it would have to be approved by General Samford\r\nbefore it went to ADC and then back to the Pentagon for higher Air\r\nForce official blessing. From all indications it looked as if we\r\nwould get the necessary blessings.\r\n\r\nBut the majority of the effort at Project Blue Book during the fall\r\nof 1952 had gone toward collecting together all of the bits and\r\npieces of data that we had accumulated over the past year and a half.\r\nWe had sorted out the best of the \"Unknowns\" and made studies of\r\ncertain aspects of the UFO problem, so that when we could assemble a\r\npanel of scientists to review the data we could give them the over-\r\nall picture, not just a basketful of parts.\r\n\r\nEveryone who knew about the proposed panel meeting was eager to get\r\nstarted because everyone was interested in knowing what this panel\r\nwould have to say. Although the group of scientists wouldn't be\r\nempowered to make the final decision, their recommendations were to\r\ngo to the President if they decided that the UFO's were real. And any\r\nrecommendations made by the group of names we planned to assemble\r\nwould carry a lot of weight.\r\n\r\nIn the Pentagon and at ATIC book was being made on what their\r\nrecommendations would be. When I put my money down, the odds were 5\r\nto 3 in favor of the UFO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\r\n\r\nThe Radiation Story\r\n\r\nThe idea for gathering together a group of scientists, to whom we\r\nreferred as our \"panel of experts,\" had been conceived early in 1952--\r\nas soon as serious talk about the possibility that the UFO's might be\r\ninterplanetary spaceships had taken hold in both military and\r\nscientific circles. In fact, when Project Grudge was reorganized in\r\nthe summer of 1951 the idea had been mentioned, and this was the main\r\nreason that our charter had said we were to be only a fact-finding\r\ngroup. The people on previous UFO projects had gone off on tangents\r\nof speculation about the identity of the UFO's; they first declared\r\nthat they were spacecraft, then later, in a complete about-face, they\r\ntook the whole UFO problem as one big belly laugh. Both approaches\r\nhad gotten the Air Force into trouble. Why they did this I don't\r\nknow, because from the start we realized that no one at ATIC, in the\r\nAir Force, or in the whole military establishment was qualified to\r\ngive a final yes or no answer to the UFO problem. Giving a final\r\nanswer would require a serious decision--probably one of the most\r\nserious since the beginning of man.\r\n\r\nDuring 1952 many highly qualified engineers and scientists had\r\nvisited Project Blue Book and had spent a day or two going over our\r\nreports. Some were very much impressed with the reports--some had all\r\nthe answers.\r\n\r\nBut all of the scientists who read our reports readily admitted that\r\neven though they may have thought that the reports did or did not\r\nindicate visitors from outer space, they would want to give the\r\nsubject a good deal more study before they ever committed themselves\r\nin writing. Consequently the people's opinions, although they were\r\nvaluable, didn't give us enough to base a decision upon. We still\r\nneeded a group to study our material thoroughly and give us written\r\nconclusions and recommendations which could be sent to the President\r\nif necessary.\r\n\r\nOur panel of experts was to consist of six or eight of the top\r\nscientists in the United States. We fully realized that even the Air\r\nForce didn't have enough \"pull\" just to ask all of these people to\r\ndrop the important work they were engaged in and spend a week or two\r\nstudying our reports. Nor did we want to do it this way; we wanted to\r\nbe sure that we had something worth while before asking for their\r\nvaluable time. So, working through other government agencies, we\r\norganized a preliminary review panel of four people. All of them were\r\ncompetent scientists and we knew their reputations were such that if\r\nthey recommended that a certain top scientist sit on a panel to\r\nreview our material he would do it.\r\n\r\nIn late November 1952 the preliminary review panel met at ATIC for\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting ended, the group unanimously recommended that a\r\n\"higher court\" be formed to review the case of the UFO. In an hour\r\ntheir recommendation was accepted by higher Air Force authorities,\r\nand the men proceeded to recommend the members for our proposed\r\npanel. They picked six men who had reputations as being both\r\npractical and theoretical scientists and who were known to have no\r\nbiased opinions regarding the UFO's.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the panel, which would be held in Washington, was\r\ntentatively scheduled for late December or early January--depending\r\nupon when all of the scientists who had been asked to attend would be\r\nfree. At Project Blue Book activity went into high gear as we made\r\npreparations for the meeting. But before we were very far along our\r\npreparations were temporarily sidetracked--I got a lead on the facts\r\nbehind a rumor. Normally we didn't pay attention to rumors, but this\r\none was in a different class.\r\n\r\nEver since the Air Force had become interested in UFO reports, the\r\ncomment of those who had been requested to look them over and give a\r\nprofessional opinion was that we lacked the type of data \"you could\r\nget your teeth into.\" In even our best reports we had to rely upon\r\nwhat someone had seen. I'd been told many times that if we had even\r\none piece of information that was substantiated by some kind of\r\nrecorded proof--a set of cinetheodolite movies of a UFO, a spectrum\r\nphotograph, or any other kind of instrumented data that one could sit\r\ndown and study--we would have no difficulty getting almost any\r\nscientist in the world interested in actively helping us find the\r\nanswer to the UFO riddle.\r\n\r\nThe rumor that caused me to temporarily halt our preparations for\r\nthe high-level conference involved data that we might be able to get\r\nour teeth into.\r\n\r\nThis is the way it went.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1949, at some unspecified place in the United States,\r\na group of scientists had set up equipment to measure background\r\nradiation, the small amount of harmless radiation that is always\r\npresent in our atmosphere. This natural radiation varies to a certain\r\ndegree, but will never increase by any appreciable amount unless\r\nthere is a good reason.\r\n\r\nAccording to the rumor, two of the scientists at the unnamed place\r\nwere watching the equipment one day when, for no apparent reason, a\r\nsudden increase of radiation was indicated. The radiation remained\r\nhigh for a few seconds, then dropped back to normal. The increase\r\nover normal was not sufficient to be dangerous, but it definitely was\r\nunusual. All indications pointed to equipment malfunction as the most\r\nprobable explanation. A quick check revealed no obvious trouble with\r\nthe gear, and the two scientists were about to start a more detailed\r\ncheck when a third member of the radiation crew came rushing into the\r\nlab.\r\n\r\nBefore they could tell the newcomer about the unexplained radiation\r\nthey had just picked up, he blurted out a story of his own. He had\r\ndriven to a nearby town, and on his return trip, as he approached the\r\nresearch lab, something in the sky suddenly caught his eye. High in\r\nthe cloudless blue he saw three silvery objects moving in a V\r\nformation. They appeared to be spherical in shape, but he wasn't\r\nsure. The first fact that had hit him was that the objects were\r\ntraveling too fast to be conventional aircraft. He jammed on the\r\nbrakes, stopped his car, and shut off the engine. No sound. All he\r\ncould hear was the quiet whir of a generator in the research lab. In\r\na few seconds the objects had disappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nAfter the first two scientists had briefed their excited colleague\r\non the unusual radiation they had detected, the three men asked each\r\nother the $64 question: Was there any connection between the two\r\nincidents? Had the UFO's caused the excessive radiation?\r\n\r\nThey checked the time. Knowing almost exactly when the instruments\r\nhad registered the increased radiation, they checked on how long it\r\ntook to drive to the lab from the point where the three silver\r\nobjects had been seen. The times correlated within a minute or two.\r\nThe three men proceeded to check their radiation equipment\r\nthoroughly. Nothing was wrong.\r\n\r\nThe rumor stopped here. Nothing that I or anyone else on Project\r\nBlue Book could find out shed any further light on the source of the\r\nstory. People associated with projects similar to the research lab\r\nthat was mentioned in the rumor were sought out and questioned. Many\r\nof them had heard the story, but no one could add any new details.\r\nThe three unknown scientists, at the unnamed lab, in an unknown part\r\nof the United States, might as well never have existed. Maybe they\r\nhadn't.\r\n\r\nAlmost a year after I had first heard the UFO-radiation story I got\r\na long-distance call from a friend on the west coast. I had seen him\r\nseveral months before, at which time I told him about this curious\r\nrumor and expressed my wish to find out how authentic it was. Now, on\r\nthe phone, he told me he had just been in contact with two people he\r\nknew and they had the whole story. He said they would be in Los\r\nAngeles the following night and would like very much to talk to me.\r\n\r\nI hated to fly clear to the west coast on what might be a wild-goose\r\nchase, but I did. I couldn't afford to run the risk of losing an\r\nopportunity to turn that old recurrent rumor into fact.\r\n\r\nTwenty hours later I met the two people at the Hollywood Roosevelt\r\nHotel. We talked for several hours that night, and I got the details\r\non the rumor and a lot more that I hadn't bargained for. Both of my\r\ninformants were physicists working for the Atomic Energy Commission,\r\nand were recognized in their fields. They wanted no publicity and I\r\npromised them that they would get none. One of the men knew all the\r\ndetails behind the rumor, and did most of the talking. To keep my\r\npromise of no publicity, I'll call him the \"scientist.\"\r\n\r\nThe rumor version of the UFO-radiation story that had been kicking\r\naround in Air Force and scientific circles for so long had been\r\ncorrect in detail but it was by no means complete. The scientist said\r\nthat after the initial sighting had taken place word was spread at\r\nthe research lab that the next time the instruments registered\r\nabnormal amounts of radiation, some of the personnel were to go\r\noutside immediately and look for some object in the sky.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after the first incident a repetition did occur.\r\nWhile excessive radiation was registering on the instruments in the\r\nlab, a lone dark object was seen streaking across the sky. Again the\r\ninstruments were checked but, as before, no malfunction was found.\r\n\r\nAfter this second sighting, according to the scientist, an\r\ninvestigation was started at the laboratory. The people who made the\r\nvisual observations weren't sure that the object they had seen\r\ncouldn't have been an airplane. Someone thought that perhaps some\r\ntype of radar equipment in the airplane, if that's what the object\r\nwas, might have affected the radiation-detection equipment. So\r\narrangements were made to fly all types of aircraft over the area\r\nwith their radar in operation. Nothing unusual happened. All possible\r\ntypes of airborne research equipment were traced during similar\r\nflights in the hope that some special equipment not normally carried\r\nin aircraft would be found to have caused the jump in radiation. But\r\nnothing out of the ordinary occurred during these tests either.\r\n\r\nIt was tentatively concluded, the scientist continued, that the\r\nabnormally high radiation readings were \"officially\" due to some\r\nfreakish equipment malfunction and that the objects sighted visually\r\nwere birds or airplanes. A report to this effect was made to military\r\nauthorities, but since the conclusion stated that no flying saucers\r\nwere involved, the report went into some unknown file. Project Blue\r\nBook never got it.\r\n\r\nShortly after the second UFO-radiation episode the research group\r\nfinished its work. It was at this time that the scientist had first\r\nbecome aware of the incidents he related to me. A friend of his, one\r\nof the men involved in the sightings, had sent the details in a letter.\r\n\r\nAs the story of the sightings spread it was widely discussed in\r\nscientific circles, with the result that the conclusion, an equipment\r\nmalfunction, began to be more seriously questioned. Among the\r\nscientists who felt that further investigation of such phenomena was\r\nin order, were the man to whom I was talking and some of the people\r\nwho had made the original sightings.\r\n\r\nAbout a year later the scientist and these original investigators\r\nwere working together. They decided to make a few more tests, on\r\ntheir own time, but with radiation-detection equipment so designed\r\nthat the possibility of malfunction would be almost nil. They formed\r\na group of people who were interested in the project, and on evenings\r\nand weekends assembled and set up their equipment in an abandoned\r\nbuilding on a small mountain peak. To insure privacy and to avoid\r\narousing undue interest among people not in on the project, the\r\nscientist and his colleagues told everyone that they had formed a\r\nmineral club. The \"mineral club\" deception covered their weekend\r\nexpeditions because \"rock hounds\" are notorious for their addiction\r\nto scrambling around on mountains in search for specimens.\r\n\r\nThe equipment that the group had installed in the abandoned building\r\nwas designed to be self-operating. Geiger tubes were arranged in a\r\npattern so that some idea as to the direction of the radiation source\r\ncould be obtained. During the original sightings the equipment-\r\nmalfunction factor could not be definitely established or refuted\r\nbecause certain critical data had not been measured.\r\n\r\nTo get data on visual sightings, the \"mineral club\" had to rely on\r\nthe flying saucer grapevine, which exists at every major scientific\r\nlaboratory in the country.\r\n\r\nBy late summer of 1950 they were in business. For the next three\r\nmonths the scientist and his group kept their radiation equipment\r\noperating twenty-four hours a day, but the tapes showed nothing\r\nexcept the usual background activity. The saucer grapevine reported\r\nsightings in the general area of the tests, but none close to the\r\ninstrumented mountaintop.\r\n\r\nThe trip to the instrument shack, which had to be made every two\r\ndays to change tapes, began to get tiresome for the \"rock hounds,\"\r\nand there was some talk of discontinuing the watch.\r\n\r\nBut persistence paid off. Early in December, about ten o'clock in\r\nthe morning, the grapevine reported sightings of a silvery, circular-\r\nshaped object near the instrument shack. The UFO was seen by several\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"rock hounds\" checked the recording tapes in the shack they\r\nfound that several of the Geiger tubes had been triggered at\r\n10:17A.M. The registered radiation increase was about 100 times\r\ngreater than the normal background activity.\r\n\r\nThree more times during the next two months the \"mineral club's\"\r\nequipment recorded abnormal radiation on occasions when the grapevine\r\nreported visual sightings of UFO's. One of the visual sightings was\r\nsubstantiated by radar.\r\n\r\nAfter these incidents the \"mineral club\" kept its instruments in\r\noperation until June 1951, but nothing more was recorded. And,\r\ncuriously enough, during this period while the radiation level\r\nremained normal, the visual sightings in the area dropped off too.\r\nThe \"mineral club\" decided to concentrate on determining the\r\nsignificance of the data they had obtained.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the scientist and the group made a detailed study of\r\ntheir mountaintop findings. They had friends working on many research\r\nprojects throughout the United States and managed to visit and confer\r\nwith them while on business trips. They investigated the possibility\r\nof unusual sunspot activity, but sunspots had been normal during the\r\nbrief periods of high radiation. To clinch the elimination of\r\nsunspots as a cause, their record tapes showed no burst of radiation\r\nwhen sunspot activity had been abnormal.\r\n\r\nThe \"rock hounds\" checked every possible research project that might\r\nhave produced some stray radiation for their instruments to pick up.\r\nThey found nothing. They checked and rechecked their instruments, but\r\ncould find no factor that might have induced false readings. They let\r\nother scientists in on their findings, hoping that these outsiders\r\nmight be able to put their fingers on errors that had been overlooked.\r\n\r\nNow, more than a year after the occurrence of the mysterious\r\nincidents that they had recorded, a year spent in analyzing their\r\ndata, the \"rock hounds\" had no answer.\r\n\r\nBy the best scientific tests that they had been able to apply, the\r\nvisual sightings and the high radiation had taken place more or less\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nIntriguing ideas are hard to kill, and this one had more than one\r\nlife, possibly because of the element of mystery which surrounds the\r\nsubject of flying saucers. But the scientific mind thrives on taking\r\nthe mystery out of unexplained events, so it is not surprising that\r\nthe investigation went on.\r\n\r\nAccording to my friend the scientist, a few people outside the\r\nlaboratory where the \"rock hounds\" worked were told about the\r\nactivities of the \"mineral club,\" and they started radiation-\r\ndetection groups of their own.\r\n\r\nFor instance, two graduate astronomy students from a southwestern\r\nuniversity started a similar watch, on a modest scale, using a\r\nmodified standard Geiger counter as their detection unit. They did\r\nnot build a recorder into their equipment, however, and consequently\r\nwere forced to man their equipment continuously, which naturally cut\r\ndown the time they were in operation. On two occasions they\r\nreportedly detected a burst of high radiation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the veracity of the two astronomers was not doubted, the\r\nscientist felt that the accuracy of their readings was poor because\r\nof the rather low quality of their equipment.\r\n\r\nThe scientist then told me about a far more impressive effort to\r\nverify or disprove the findings of the \"mineral club.\" Word of the\r\n\"rock hounds\" and their work had also spread to a large laboratory in\r\nthe East. An Air Force colonel, on duty at the lab, told the story to\r\nsome of his friends, and they decided to look personally into the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nFortunately these people were in a wonderful spot to make such an\r\ninvestigation. At their laboratory an extensive survey of the\r\nsurrounding area was being made. An elaborate system of radiation-\r\ndetection equipment had been set up for a radius of 100 miles around\r\nthe lab. In addition, the defenses of the area included a radar net.\r\n\r\nThanks to the flashing of silver eagles, the colonel's group got\r\npermission to check the records of the radiation-survey station and\r\nto look over the logs of the radar stations. They found instances\r\nwhere, during the same period of time that radiation in the area had\r\nbeen much higher than normal, radar had had a UFO on the scope. These\r\nevents had occurred during the period from January 1951 until about\r\nJune 1951.\r\n\r\nUpon learning of the tentative but encouraging findings that the\r\ncolonel's group had dug out of their past records, people on both the\r\nradiation-survey crews and at the radar sites became interested in co-\r\noperating for further investigation. A tie-in with the local saucer\r\ngrapevine established a three-way check.\r\n\r\nOne evening in July, just before sunset, two of the colonel's group\r\nwere driving home from the laboratory. As they sped along the highway\r\nthey noticed two cars stopped ahead of them. The occupants were\r\nstanding beside the road, looking at something in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe two scientists stopped, got out of their car, and scanned the\r\nsky too. Low on the eastern horizon they saw a bright circular object\r\nmoving slowly north. They watched it for a while, took a few notes,\r\nthen drove back to the lab.\r\n\r\nSome interesting news awaited them there. Radar had picked up an\r\nunidentified target near the spot where the scientists in the car had\r\nseen the UFO, and it had been traveling north. A fighter had been\r\nscrambled, but when it got into the proper area, the radar target was\r\noff the scope. The pilot glimpsed something that looked like the\r\nreported UFO, but before he could check further he had to turn into\r\nthe sun to get on an interception course, and he lost the object.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed before the radiation reports from all stations\r\ncould be collected. When the reports did come in they showed that\r\nstations east of the laboratory, on an approximate line with the\r\nradar track, had shown the highest increase in radiation. Stations\r\nwest of the lab showed nothing.\r\n\r\nThe possible significance of this well-covered incident spurred the\r\ncolonel's group to extend and refine their activities. Their idea was\r\nto build a radiation-detection instrument in an empty wing tank and\r\nhang the tank on an F-47. Then when a UFO was reported they would fly\r\na search pattern in the area and try to establish whether or not a\r\ncertain sector of the sky was more radioactive than other sectors.\r\nAlso, they proposed to build a highly directional detector for the F-\r\n47 and attempt actually to track a UFO.\r\n\r\nThe design of such equipment was started, but many delays occurred.\r\nBefore the colonel's group could get any of the equipment built, some\r\nof the members left the lab for other jobs, and the colonel, who\r\nsparked the operation, was himself transferred elsewhere. The entire\r\neffort collapsed.\r\n\r\nThe scientist was not surprised that I hadn't heard the story of the\r\ncolonel's group. All the people involved, he said, had kept it quiet\r\nin order to avoid ridicule. The scientist added that he would be glad\r\nto give me all the data he had on the sightings of his \"mineral\r\nclub,\" and he told me where to get the information about the two\r\nastronomers and the colonel's group.\r\n\r\nArmed with the scientist's notes and recorder tapes, I left for my\r\noffice at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton.\r\n\r\nWith the blessings of my chief, I started to run down the rest of\r\nthe radiation information. The data we had, especially that from the\r\nscientist's \"mineral club,\" had been thoroughly analyzed, but we\r\nthought that since we now had access to more general data something\r\nnew and more significant might be found.\r\n\r\nFirst I contacted the government agency for which all of the people\r\ninvolved in these investigations had been working, the scientists who\r\nrecorded the original incident, the scientist and his \"mineral club,\"\r\nthe colonel's group, and the rest.\r\n\r\nThe people in the agency were very co-operative but stressed the\r\nfact that the activities I was investigating were strictly the\r\nextracurricular affairs of the scientists involved, had no official\r\nsanction, and should not be tied in with the agency in any way,\r\nshape, or form. This closed-door reaction was typical of how the\r\nwords \"flying saucer\" seem to scare some people.\r\n\r\nThey did help me locate the report on the original incident,\r\nhowever, and since it seemed to be the only existing copy, I arranged\r\nto borrow it. About this same time we located the two graduate\r\nastronomy students in New Mexico. Both now had their Ph.D.'s and held\r\nresponsible jobs on highly classified projects. They repeated their\r\nstory, which I had first heard from the scientist, but had kept no\r\nrecord of their activities.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, just before dawn on a Sunday morning, they were on\r\nthe roof, making some meteorological observations. One of them was\r\nlistening to the Geiger counter when he detected a definite increase\r\nin the clicking.\r\n\r\nJust as the frequency of the clicks reached its highest peak--almost\r\na steady buzz--a large fireball, described by them as \"spectacular,\"\r\nflashed across the sky. Both of the observers had seen several of the\r\ngreen fireballs and said that this object was similar in all respects\r\nexcept that the color was a brilliant blue-white.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of the fireball, the counter once more\r\nsettled down to a steady click per second. They added that once\r\nbefore they had detected a similar increase in the frequency of the\r\nclicks but had seen nothing in the sky.\r\n\r\nIn telling their story, both astronomers stressed the point that\r\ntheir data were open to a great deal of criticism, mainly because of\r\nthe limited instrumentation they had used. We agreed. Still their\r\nwork tended to support the findings of the more elaborate and\r\nsystematic radiation investigations.\r\n\r\nThe gods who watch over the UFO project were smiling about this\r\ntime, because one morning I got a call from a colonel on Wright-\r\nPatterson Air Force Base. He was going to be in our area that morning\r\nand planned to stop in to see me.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in a few minutes and turned out to be none other than the\r\ncolonel who had headed the group which had investigated UFO's and\r\nradiation at the eastern laboratory. He repeated his story. It was\r\nthe same as I had heard from the scientist, with a few insignificant\r\nchanges. The colonel had no records of his group's operations, but\r\nknew who had them. He promised to get a wire off to the person\r\nimmediately, which he did.\r\n\r\nThe answer was a bit disappointing. During the intervening months\r\nthe data had been scattered out among the members of the colonel's\r\ngroup, and when the group broke up, so did its collection of records.\r\n\r\nSo all we had to fall back on was the colonel's word, but since he\r\nnow was heading a top-priority project at Wright, it would be\r\ndifficult not to believe him.\r\n\r\nAfter obtaining the colonel's story, we collected all available data\r\nconcerning known incidents in which there seemed to be a correlation\r\nbetween the visual sighting of UFO's and the presence of excess\r\natomic radiation in the area of the sightings.\r\n\r\nThere was one last thing to do. I wanted to take the dates and times\r\nof all the reported radiation increases and check them against all\r\nsources of UFO reports. This project would take a lot of leg work and\r\ndigging, but I felt that it would offer the most positive and\r\ncomplete evidence we could assemble as to whether or not a\r\ncorrelation existed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we dug into our files, ADC radar logs, press wire\r\nservice files, newspaper morgues in the sighting area, and the files\r\nof individuals who collect data on saucers. Whenever we found a\r\nvisual report that correlated with a radiation peak we checked it\r\nagainst weather conditions, balloon tracks, astronomical reports, etc.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the data had all been assembled, I arranged for a group\r\nof Air Force consultants to look it over. I got the same old answer--\r\nthe data still aren't good enough. The men were very much interested\r\nin the reports, but when it came time to putting their comments on\r\npaper they said, \"Not enough conclusive evidence.\" If in some way the\r\nUFO's could have been photographed at the same time that the\r\nradiation detectors were going wild, it would have been a different\r\nstory, they later told me, but with the data I had for them this was\r\nthe only answer they could give. No one could explain the sudden\r\nbursts of radiation, but there was no proof that they were associated\r\nwith UFO's.\r\n\r\nThe board's ruling wrote finish to this investigation. I informed\r\nthe colonel, and he didn't like the decision. Later I passed through\r\nthe city where the scientist was working. I stopped over a few hours\r\nto brief him on the board's decision. He shook his head in disbelief.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that both the colonel and the scientist\r\nreacted in the same way. We're not fools--we were there--we saw it--\r\nthey didn't. What do they want for proof?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\r\n\r\nThe Hierarchy Ponders\r\n\r\nBy early January 1953 the scientists who were to be members of our\r\npanel of experts had been contacted and had agreed to sit in judgment\r\nof the UFO. In turn, we agreed to give them every detail about the UFO.\r\n\r\nWe had our best reports for them to read, and we were going to show\r\nthem the two movies that some intelligence officers considered as the\r\n\"positive proof\"--the Tremonton Movie and the Montana Movie.\r\n\r\nWhen this high court convened on the morning of January 12, the\r\nfirst thing it received was its orders; one of three verdicts would\r\nbe acceptable:\r\n\r\nAll UFO reports are explainable as known objects or natural\r\nphenomena; therefore the investigation should be permanently\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\nThe UFO reports do not contain enough data upon which to base a\r\nfinal conclusion. Project Blue Book should be continued in hopes of\r\nobtaining better data.\r\n\r\nThe UFO's are interplanetary spacecraft.\r\n\r\nThe written verdict, the group was told, would be given to the\r\nNational Security Council, a council made up of the directors of all\r\nU.S. intelligence agencies, and thence it would go to the President\r\nof the United States--if they should decide that the UFO's were\r\ninterplanetary spacecraft.\r\n\r\nBecause of military regulations, the names of the panel members,\r\nlike the names of so many other people associated with the UFO story,\r\ncannot be revealed. Two of the men had made names for themselves as\r\npractical physicists--they could transform the highest theory for\r\npractical uses. One of these men had developed the radar that pulled\r\nus out of a big hole at the beginning of World War II, and the other\r\nhad been one of the fathers of the H-bomb. Another of the panel\r\nmembers is now the chief civilian adviser to one of our top military\r\ncommanders, and another was an astronomer whose unpublished fight to\r\nget the UFO recognized is respected throughout scientific circles.\r\nThere was a man who is noted for his highly theoretical physics and\r\nmathematics, and another who had pioneered operations research during\r\nWorld War II. The sixth member of the panel had been honored by the\r\nAmerican Rocket Society and the International Astronautical\r\nFederation for his work in moving space travel from the Buck Rogers\r\nrealm to the point of near reality and who is now a rocket expert.\r\n\r\nIt was an impressive collection of top scientific talent.\r\n\r\nDuring the first two days of the meeting I reviewed our findings for\r\nthe scientists. Since June 1947, when the first UFO report had been\r\nmade, ATIC had analyzed 1,593 UFO reports. About 4,400 had actually\r\nbeen received, but all except 1,593 had been immediately rejected for\r\nanalysis. From our studies, we estimated that ATIC received reports\r\nof only 10 per cent of the UFO sightings that were made in the United\r\nStates, therefore in five and a half years something like 44,000 UFO\r\nsightings had been made.\r\n\r\nOf the 1,593 reports that had been analyzed by Project Blue Book,\r\nand we had studied and evaluated every report in the Air Force files,\r\nwe had been able to explain a great many. The actual breakdown was\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n_Balloons_.....................18.51%\r\n\r\nKnown        1.57\r\nProbable     4.99\r\nPossible    11.95\r\n            18.51\r\n\r\n_Aircraft_.....................11.76%\r\n\r\nKnown        0.98\r\nProbable     7.74\r\nPossible     3.04\r\n            11.76\r\n\r\n_Astronomical_ _Bodies_........14.20%\r\n\r\nKnown        2.79\r\nProbable     4.01\r\nPossible     7.40\r\n            14.20\r\n\r\n_Other_ ........................4.21%\r\n\r\nSearchlights on clouds, birds, blowing paper, inversions,\r\nreflections, etc.\r\n\r\n_Hoaxes_........................1.66%\r\n\r\n_Insufficient_ _data_..........22.72%\r\n\r\n(In addition to those initially eliminated)\r\n\r\n_Unknowns_.....................26.94%\r\n\r\nBy using the terms \"Known,\" \"Probable,\" and \"Possible,\" we were able\r\nto differentiate how positive we were of our conclusions. But even in\r\nthe \"Possible\" cases we were, in our own minds, sure that we had\r\nidentified the reported UFO.\r\n\r\nAnd who made these reports? Pilots and air crews made 17.1 per cent\r\nfrom the air. Scientists and engineers made 5.7 per cent, airport\r\ncontrol tower operators made an even 1.0 per cent of the reports, and\r\n12.5 per cent of the total were radar reports. The remaining 63.7 per\r\ncent were made by military and civilian observers in general.\r\n\r\nThe reports that we were interested in were the 26.94 per cent or\r\n429 \"Unknowns,\" so we had studied them in great detail. We studied\r\nthe reported colors of the UFO's, the shapes, the directions they\r\nwere traveling, the times of day they were observed, and many more\r\ndetails, but we could find no significant pattern or trends. We did\r\nfind that the most often reported shape was elliptical and that the\r\nmost often reported color was white or \"metallic.\" About the same\r\nnumber of UFO's were reported as being seen in daytime as at night,\r\nand the direction of travel equally covered the sixteen cardinal\r\nheadings of the compass.\r\n\r\nSeventy per cent of the \"Unknowns\" had been seen visually from the\r\nair; 12 per cent had been seen visually from the ground; 10 per cent\r\nhad been picked up by ground or airborne radar; and 8 per cent were\r\ncombination visual-radar sightings.\r\n\r\nIn the over-all total of 1,593 sightings women made two reports for\r\nevery one made by a man, but in the \"Unknowns\" the men beat out women\r\nten to one.\r\n\r\nThere were two other factors we could never resolve, the frequency\r\nof the sightings and their geographical distribution. Since the first\r\nflurry of reports in July of 1947, each July brought a definite peak\r\nin reports; then a definite secondary peak occurred just before each\r\nChristmas. We plotted these peaks in sightings against high tides,\r\nworld-wide atomic tests, the positions of the moon and planets, the\r\ngeneral cloudiness over the United States, and a dozen and one other\r\nthings, but we could never say what caused more people to see UFO's\r\nat certain times of the year.\r\n\r\nThen the UFO's were habitually reported from areas around\r\n\"technically interesting\" places like our atomic energy\r\ninstallations, harbors, and critical manufacturing areas. Our studies\r\nshowed that such vital military areas as Strategic Air Command and\r\nAir Defense Command bases, some A-bomb storage areas, and large\r\nmilitary depots actually produced fewer reports than could be\r\nexpected from a given area in the United States. Large population\r\ncenters devoid of any major \"technically interesting\" facilities also\r\nproduced few reports.\r\n\r\nAccording to the laws of normal distribution, if UFO's are not\r\nintelligently controlled vehicles, the distribution of reports should\r\nhave been similar to the distribution of population in the United\r\nStates--it wasn't.\r\n\r\nOur study of the geographical locations of sightings also covered\r\nother countries. The U.S. by no means had a curb on the UFO market.\r\n\r\nIn all of our \"Unknown\" reports we never found one measurement of\r\nsize, speed, or altitude that could be considered to be even fairly\r\naccurate. We could say only that some of the UFO's had been traveling\r\npretty fast.\r\n\r\nAs far as radar was concerned, we had reports of fantastic speeds--\r\nup to 50,000 miles an hour--but in all of these instances there was\r\nsome doubt as to exactly what caused the target. The highest speeds\r\nreported for our combination radar-visual sightings, which we\r\nconsidered to be the best type of sighting in our files, were 700 to\r\n800 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nWe had never picked up any \"hardware\"--any whole saucers, pieces, or\r\nparts--that couldn't be readily identified as being something very\r\nearthly. We had a contract with a materials-testing laboratory, and\r\nthey would analyze any piece of material that we found or was sent to\r\nus. The tar-covered marble, aluminum broom handle, cow manure, slag,\r\npieces of plastic balloon, and the what-have-you that we did receive\r\nand analyze only served to give the people in our material lab some\r\npractice and added nothing but laughs to the UFO project.\r\n\r\nThe same went for the reports of \"contacts\" with spacemen. Since\r\n1952 a dozen or so people have claimed that they have talked to or\r\nridden with the crews of flying saucers. They offer affidavits,\r\npieces of material, photographs, and other bits and pieces of junk as\r\nproof. We investigated some of these reports and could find\r\nabsolutely no fact behind the stories.\r\n\r\nWe had a hundred or so photos of flying saucers, both stills and\r\nmovies. Many were fakes--some so expert that it took careful study by\r\nphoto interpreters to show how the photos had been faked. Some were\r\nthe crudest of fakes, automobile hub caps thrown into the air,\r\nhomemade saucers suspended by threads, and just plain retouched\r\nnegatives. The rest of the still photos had been sent in by well-\r\nmeaning citizens who couldn't recognize a light flare of flaw in the\r\nnegative, or who had chanced to get an excellent photo of a sundog or\r\nmirage.\r\n\r\nBut the movies that were sent in to us were different. In the first\r\nplace, it takes an expert with elaborate equipment to fake a movie.\r\nWe had or knew about four strips of movie film that fell into the\r\n\"Unknown\" category. Two were the cinetheodolite movies that had been\r\ntaken at White Sands Proving Ground in April and May of 1950, one was\r\nthe Montana Movie and the last was the Tremonton Movie. These latter\r\ntwo had been subjected to thousands of hours of analysis, and since\r\nwe planned to give the panel of scientists more thorough reports on\r\nthem on Friday, I skipped over their details and went to the next\r\npoint I wanted to cover--theories.\r\n\r\nPeriodically throughout the history of the UFO people have come up\r\nwith widely publicized theories to explain all UFO reports. The one\r\nthat received the most publicity was the one offered by Dr. Donald\r\nMenzel of Harvard University. Dr. Menzel, writing in _Time_, _Look_,\r\nand later in his _Flying_ _Saucers_, claimed that all UFO reports\r\ncould be explained as various types of light phenomena. We studied\r\nthis theory thoroughly because it did seem to have merit. Project\r\nBear's physicists studied it. ATIC's scientific consultants studied\r\nit and discussed it with several  leading European physicists whose\r\nspecialty was atmospheric physics. In general the comments that\r\nProject Blue Book received were, \"He's given the subject some thought\r\nbut his explanations are not the panacea.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there were other widely publicized theories. One man said that\r\nthey were all skyhook balloons, but we knew the flight path of every\r\nskyhook balloon and they were seldom reported as UFO's. Their little\r\nbrothers, the weather balloons, caused us a great deal more trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Army Engineers took a crack at solving the UFO problem by making\r\nan announcement that a scientist in one of their laboratories had\r\nduplicated a flying saucer in his laboratory. Major Dewey Fournet\r\nchecked into this one. It had all started out as a joke, but it was\r\npicked up as fact and the scientist was stuck with it. He gained some\r\npublicity but lost prestige because other scientists wondered just\r\nhow competent the man really was to try to pass off such an answer.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the unsolicited assistance of theorists didn't help us a\r\nbit, I told the panel members. Some of them were evidently familiar\r\nwith the theories because they nodded their heads in agreement.\r\n\r\nThe next topic I covered in my briefing was a question that came up\r\nquite frequently in discussions of the UFO: Did UFO reports actually\r\nstart in 1947? We had spent a great deal of time trying to resolve\r\nthis question. Old newspaper files, journals, and books that we found\r\nin the Library of Congress contained many reports of odd things being\r\nseen in the sky as far back as the Biblical times. The old Negro\r\nspiritual says, \"Ezekiel saw a wheel 'way up in the middle of the\r\nair.\" We couldn't substantiate Ezekiel's sighting because many of the\r\nvery old reports of odd things observed in the sky could be explained\r\nas natural phenomena that weren't fully understood in those days.\r\n\r\nThe first documented reports of sightings similar to the UFO\r\nsightings as we know them today appeared in the newspapers of 1896.\r\nIn fact, the series of sightings that occurred in that year and the\r\nnext had many points of similarity with the reports of today.\r\n\r\nThe sightings started in the San Francisco Bay area on the evening\r\nof November 22, 1896, when hundreds of people going home from work\r\nsaw a large, dark, \"cigar-shaped object with stubby wings\" traveling\r\nnorthwest across Oakland.\r\n\r\nWithin hours after the mystery craft had disappeared over what is\r\nnow the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, the stories of people\r\nin other northern California towns began to come in on the telegraph\r\nwires. The citizens of Santa Rosa, Sacramento, Chico, and Red Bluff--\r\nseveral thousand of them--saw it.\r\n\r\nI tried to find out if the people in these outlying communities saw\r\nthe UFO before they heard the news from the San Francisco area or\r\nafterward, but trying to run down the details of a fifty-six-year-old\r\nUFO report is almost hopeless. Once while I was on a trip to Hamilton\r\nAFB I called the offices of the San Francisco _Chronicle_ and they\r\nput me in touch with a retired employee who had worked on a San\r\nFrancisco paper in 1896. I called the old gentleman on the phone and\r\ntalked to him for a long time. He had been a copy boy at the time and\r\nremembered the incident, but time had canceled out the details. He\r\ndid tell me that he, the editor of the paper, and the news staff had\r\nseen \"the ship,\" as he referred to the UFO. His story, even though it\r\nwas fifty-six years old, smacked of others I'd heard when he said\r\nthat no one at the newspaper ever told anyone what they had seen;\r\nthey didn't want people to think that they were \"crazy.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 30 the mystery ship was back over the San Francisco area\r\nand those people who had maintained that people were being fooled by\r\na wag in a balloon became believers when the object was seen moving\r\ninto the wind.\r\n\r\nFor four months reports came in from villages, cities, and farms in\r\nthe West; then the Midwest, as the airship \"moved eastward.\" In early\r\nApril of 1897 people in Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Wisconsin,\r\nMinnesota, and Illinois reported seeing it. On April 10 it was\r\nreported to be over Chicago. Reports continued to come in to the\r\nnewspapers until about April 20; then it, or stories about it, were\r\ngone. Literally thousands of people had seen it before the last\r\nreport clicked in over the telegraph wires.\r\n\r\nA study of the hundreds of newspaper accounts of this sighting that\r\nrocked the world in the late 1890's was interesting because the same\r\ncontroversies that arose then exist now. Those who hadn't seen the\r\nstubby-winged, cigar-shaped \"craft\" said, \"Phooey,\" or the nineteenth-\r\ncentury version thereof. Those who had seen it were almost ready to\r\ndo battle to uphold their integrity. Some astronomers loudly yelled,\r\n\"Venus,\" \"Jupiter,\" and \"Alpha Orionis\" while others said, \"We saw\r\nit.\" Thomas Edison, _the_ man of science of the day, disclaimed any\r\nknowledge of the mystery craft. \"I prefer to devote my time to\r\nobjects of commercial value,\" he told a New York _Herald_ reporter.\r\n\"At best airships would only be toys.\"\r\n\r\nThomas--you goofed on that prediction.\r\n\r\nI had one more important point to cover before I finished my\r\nbriefing and opened the meeting to a general question-and-answer\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year and a half we had had several astronomers visit\r\nProject Blue Book, and they were not at all hesitant to give us their\r\nopinions but they didn't care to say much about what their colleagues\r\nwere thinking, although they did indicate that they were thinking. We\r\ndecided that the opinions and comments of astronomers would be of\r\nvalue, so late in 1952 we took a poll. We asked an astronomer, whom\r\nwe knew to be unbiased about the UFO problem and who knew every\r\noutstanding astronomer in the United States, to take a trip and talk\r\nto his friends. We asked him not to make a point of asking about the\r\nUFO but just to work the subject into a friendly conversation. This\r\nway we hoped to get a completely frank opinion. To protect his fellow\r\nastronomers, our astronomer gave them all code names and he kept the\r\nkey to the code.\r\n\r\nThe report we received expressed the detailed opinions of forty-five\r\nrecognized authorities. Their opinions varied from that of Dr. C, who\r\nregarded the UFO project as a \"silly waste of money to investigate an\r\neven sillier subject,\" to Dr. L, who has spent a great deal of his\r\nown valuable time personally investigating UFO reports because he\r\nbelieves that they are something \"real.\" Of the forty-five\r\nastronomers who were interviewed, 36 per cent were not at all\r\ninterested in the UFO reports, 41 per cent were interested to the\r\npoint of offering their services if they were ever needed, and 23 per\r\ncent thought that the UFO's were a much more serious problem than\r\nmost people recognized.\r\n\r\nNone of the astronomers, even during a friendly discussion, admitted\r\nthat he thought the UFO's could be interplanetary vehicles. All of\r\nthose who were interested would only go so far as to say, \"We don't\r\nknow what they are, but they're something real.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years I have heard it said that if the UFO's\r\nwere really \"solid objects\" our astronomers would have seen them. Our\r\nstudy shed some light on this point--astronomers have seen UFO's.\r\nNone of them has ever seen or photographed anything resembling a UFO\r\nthrough his telescope, but 11 per cent of the forty-five men had seen\r\nsomething that they couldn't explain. Although, technically speaking,\r\nthese sightings were no better than hundreds of others in our files\r\nas far as details were concerned, they were good because of the\r\ncaliber of the observer. Astronomers know what is in the sky.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that out of the representative cross\r\nsection of astronomers, five of them, or 11 per cent, had sighted\r\nUFO's. For a given group of people this is well above average. To\r\ncheck this point, the astronomer who was making our study picked\r\nninety people at random--people he met while traveling--and got them\r\ninto a conversation about flying saucers. These people were his\r\n\"control group,\" to borrow a term from the psychologists. Although\r\nthe percentage of people who were interested in UFO's was higher for\r\nthe control group than for the group of astronomers, only 41 per cent\r\nof the astronomers were interested while 86 per cent of the control\r\ngroup were interested; 11 per cent of the astronomers had seen UFO's,\r\nwhile only about 1 per cent of the control group had seen one. This\r\nseemed to indicate that as a group astronomers see many more UFO's\r\nthan the average citizen.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished my briefing, it was too late to start the question-\r\nand-answer session, so the first day's meeting adjourned. But\r\npromptly at nine o'clock the next morning the group was again\r\ngathered, and from the looks of the list of questions some of them\r\nhad, they must have been thinking about UFO's all night.\r\n\r\nOne of the first questions was about the results of photography\r\ntaken by the pairs of huge \"meteorite patrol\" cameras that are\r\nlocated in several places throughout North America. Did they ever\r\nphotograph a UFO? The cameras, which are in operation almost every\r\nclear night, can photograph very dim lights, and once a light is\r\nphotographed its speed and altitude can be very accurately\r\nestablished. If there were any objects giving off light as they flew\r\nthrough our atmosphere, there is a chance that these cameras might\r\nhave photographed them. But they hadn't.\r\n\r\nAt first this seemed to be an important piece of evidence and we had\r\njust about racked this fact up as a definite score against the UFO\r\nwhen we did a little checking. If the UFO had been flying at an\r\naltitude of 100 miles, the chances of its being picked up by the\r\ncameras would be good, but the chances of photographing something\r\nflying any lower would be less.\r\n\r\nThis may account for the fact that while our \"inquiring astronomer\"\r\nwas at the meteorite patrol camera sites, he talked to an astronomer\r\nwho had seen a UFO while operating one of the patrol cameras.\r\n\r\nMany people have asked why our astronomers haven't seen anything\r\nthrough their big telescopes. They are focused light-years away and\r\ntheir field of vision is so narrow that even if UFO's did exist and\r\nlittered the atmosphere they wouldn't be seen.\r\n\r\nAnother question the panel had was about Orson Welles' famous _War_\r\n_of_ _the_ _Worlds_ broadcast of October 1938, which caused thousands\r\nof people to panic. Had we studied this to see if there were any\r\nsimilarities between it and the current UFO reporting?\r\n\r\nWe had.\r\n\r\nOur psychologist looked into the matter and gave us an opinion--to\r\nmake a complete study and get a positive answer would require an\r\neffort that would dwarf the entire UFO project. But he did have a few\r\ncomments. There were many documented cases in which a series of\r\ninnocent circumstances triggered by the broadcast had caused people\r\nto completely lose all sense of good judgment--to panic. There were\r\nsome similar reports in our UFO files.\r\n\r\nBut we had many reports in which people reported UFO's and obviously\r\nhadn't panicked. Reports from pilots who had seen mysterious lights\r\nat night and, thinking that they might be a cockpit reflection, had\r\nturned off all their cockpit lights. Or the pilots who turned and\r\nrolled their airplanes to see if they could change the angle of\r\nreflection and get rid of the UFO. Or those pilots who climbed and\r\ndove thousands of feet and then leveled out to see if the UFO would\r\nchange its relative position to the airplane. Or the amateur\r\nastronomer who made an excellent sighting and before he reluctantly\r\nreported it as a UFO had talked to a half dozen professional\r\nastronomers and physicists in hopes of finding an explanation. All of\r\nthese people were thinking clearly, questioning themselves as to what\r\nthe sightings could be; then trying to answer their questions. These\r\npeople weren't panicked.\r\n\r\nThe question-and-answer period went on for a full day as the\r\nscientists dug into the details of the general facts I had given them\r\nin my briefing.\r\n\r\nThe following day and a half was devoted to reviewing and discussing\r\nfifty of our best sighting reports that we had classed as \"Unknowns.\"\r\n\r\nThe next item on the agenda, when the panel had finished absorbing\r\nall of the details of the fifty selected top reports, was a review of\r\na very hot and very highly controversial study. It was based on the\r\nidea that Major Dewey Fournet and I had talked about several months\r\nbefore--an analysis of the motions of the reported UFO's in an\r\nattempt to determine whether they were intelligently controlled. The\r\nstudy was hot because it wasn't official and the reason it wasn't\r\nofficial was because it was so hot. It concluded that the UFO's were\r\ninterplanetary spaceships. The report had circulated around high\r\ncommand levels of intelligence and it had been read with a good deal\r\nof interest. But even though some officers at command levels just a\r\nnotch below General Samford bought it, the space behind the words\r\n\"Approved by\" was blank--no one would stick his neck out and\r\nofficially send it to the top.\r\n\r\nDewey Fournet, who had completed his tour of active duty in the Air\r\nForce and was now a civilian, was called from Houston, Texas, to tell\r\nthe scientists about the study since he had worked very closely with\r\nthe group that had prepared it.\r\n\r\nThe study covered several hundred of our most detailed UFO reports.\r\nBy a very critical process of elimination, based on the motion of the\r\nreported UFO's, Fournet told the panel how he and any previous\r\nanalysis by Project Blue Book had been disregarded and how those\r\nreports that could have been caused by any one of the many dozen\r\nknown objects--balloons, airplanes, astronomical bodies, etc., were\r\nsifted out. This sifting took quite a toll, and the study ended up\r\nwith only ten or twenty reports that fell into the \"Unknown\"\r\ncategory. Since such critical methods of evaluation had been used,\r\nthese few reports proved beyond a doubt that the UFO's were\r\nintelligently controlled by persons with brains equal to or far\r\nsurpassing ours.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the study, Fournet explained, was to find out where\r\nthey came from. \"Earthlings\" were eliminated, leaving the final\r\nanswer--spacemen.\r\n\r\nBoth Dewey and I had been somewhat worried about how the panel would\r\nreact to a study with such definite conclusions. But when he finished\r\nhis presentation, it was obvious from the tone of the questioning\r\nthat the men were giving the conclusions serious thought. Fournet's\r\nexcellent reputation was well known.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning we presented the feature attractions of the\r\nsession, the Tremonton Movie and the Montana Movie. These two bits of\r\nevidence represented the best photos of UFO's that Project Blue Book\r\nhad to offer. The scientists knew about them, especially the\r\nTremonton Movie, because since late July they had been the subject of\r\nmany closed-door conferences. Generals, admirals, and GS-16's had\r\nseen them at \"command performances,\" and they had been flown to Kelly\r\nAFB in Texas to be shown to a conference of intelligence officers\r\nfrom all over the world. Two of the country's best military photo\r\nlaboratories, the Air Force lab at Wright Field and the Navy's lab at\r\nAnacostia, Maryland, had spent many hours trying to prove that the\r\nUFO's were balloons, airplanes, or stray light reflections, but they\r\nfailed--the UFO's were true unknowns. The possibility that the movie\r\nhad been faked was considered but quickly rejected because only a\r\nHollywood studio with elaborate equipment could do such a job and the\r\npeople who filmed the movies didn't have this kind of equipment.\r\n\r\nThe Montana Movie had been taken on August 15, 1950, by Nick\r\nMariana, the manager of the Great Falls baseball team. It showed two\r\nlarge bright lights flying across the blue sky in an echelon\r\nformation. There were no clouds in the movie to give an indication of\r\nthe UFO's speed, but at one time they passed behind a water tower.\r\nThe lights didn't show any detail; they appeared to be large circular\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nMariana had sent his movies to the Air Force back in 1950, but in\r\n1950 there was no interest in the UFO so, after a quick viewing,\r\nProject Grudge had written them off as \"the reflections from two F-94\r\njet fighters that were in the area.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1952, at the request of the Pentagon, I reopened the\r\ninvestigation of the Montana Movie. Working through an intelligence\r\nofficer at the Great Falls AFB, I had Mariana reinterrogated and\r\nobtained a copy of his movie, which I sent to the photo lab.\r\n\r\nWhen the photo lab got the movie, they had a little something to\r\nwork with because the two UFO's had passed behind a reference point,\r\nthe water tower. Their calculations quickly confirmed that the\r\nobjects were not birds, balloons, or meteors. Balloons drift with the\r\nwind and the wind was not blowing in the direction that the two UFO's\r\nwere traveling. No exact speeds could be measured, but the lab could\r\ndetermine that the lights were traveling too fast to be birds and too\r\nslow to be meteors.\r\n\r\nThis left airplanes as the only answer. The intelligence officer at\r\nGreat Falls had dug through huge stacks of files and found that only\r\ntwo airplanes, two F-94's, were near the city during the sighting and\r\nthat they had landed about two minutes afterwards. Both Mariana and\r\nhis secretary, who had also seen the UFO's, had said that the two\r\njets had appeared in another part of the sky only a minute or two\r\nafter the two UFO's had disappeared in the southeast. This in itself\r\nwould eliminate the jets as candidates for the UFO's, but we wanted\r\nto double-check. The two circular lights didn't look like F-94's, but\r\nanyone who has done any flying can tell you that an airplane so far\r\naway that it can't be seen can suddenly catch the sun's rays and make\r\na brilliant flash.\r\n\r\nFirst we studied the flight paths of the two F-94's. We knew the\r\nlanding pattern that was being used on the day of the sighting, and\r\nwe knew when the two F-94's landed. The two jets just weren't\r\nanywhere close to where the two UFO's had been. Next we studied each\r\nindividual light and both appeared to be too steady to be reflections.\r\n\r\nWe drew a blank on the Montana Movie--it was an unknown.\r\n\r\nWe also drew a blank on the Tremonton Movie, a movie that had been\r\ntaken by a Navy Chief Photographer, Warrant Officer Delbert C.\r\nNewhouse, on July 2, 1952.\r\n\r\nOur report on the incident showed that Newhouse, his wife, and their\r\ntwo children were driving to Oakland, California, from the east coast\r\non this eventful day. They had just passed through Tremonton, Utah, a\r\ntown north of Salt Lake City, and had traveled about 7 miles on U.S.\r\nHighway 30S when Mrs. Newhouse noticed a group of objects in the sky.\r\nShe pointed them out to her husband; he looked, pulled over to the\r\nside of the road, stopped the car, and jumped out to get a better\r\nlook. He didn't have to look very long to realize that something\r\nhighly unusual was taking place because in his twenty-one years in\r\nthe Navy and 2,000 hours' flying time as an aerial photographer, he'd\r\nnever seen anything like this. About a dozen shiny disklike objects\r\nwere \"milling around the sky in a rough formation.\"\r\n\r\nNewhouse had his movie camera so he turned the turret around to a 3-\r\ninch telephoto lens and started to photograph the UFO's. He held the\r\ncamera still and took several feet of film, getting all of the bright\r\nobjects in one photo. All of the UFO's had stayed in a compact group\r\nfrom the time the Newhouse family had first seen them, but just\r\nbefore they disappeared over the western horizon one of them left the\r\nmain group and headed east. Newhouse swung his camera around and took\r\nseveral shots of it, holding his camera steady and letting the UFO\r\npass through the field of view before it disappeared in the east.\r\n\r\nWhen I received the Tremonton films I took them right over to the\r\nWright Field photo lab, along with the Montana Movie, and the photo\r\ntechnicians and I ran them twenty or thirty times. The two movies\r\nwere similar in that in both of them the objects appeared to be large\r\ncircular lights--in neither one could you see any detail. But, unlike\r\nthe Montana Movie, the lights in the Tremonton Movie would fade out,\r\nthen come back in again. This fading immediately suggested airplanes\r\nreflecting light, but the roar of a king-sized dogfight could have\r\nbeen heard for miles and the Newhouse family had heard no sound. We\r\ncalled in several fighter pilots and they watched the UFO's circling\r\nand darting in and out in the cloudless blue sky. Their unqualified\r\ncomment was that no airplane could do what the UFO's were doing.\r\n\r\nBalloons came under suspicion, but the lab eliminated them just as\r\nquickly by studying the kind of a reflection given off by a balloon--\r\nit is a steady reflection since a balloon is spherical. Then, to\r\nfurther scuttle the balloon theory, clusters of balloons are tied\r\ntogether and don't mill around. Of course, the lone UFO that took off\r\nto the east by itself was the biggest argument against balloons.\r\n\r\nNewhouse told an intelligence officer from the Western Air Defense\r\nForces that he had held his camera still and let this single UFO fly\r\nthrough the field of view, so the people in the lab measured its\r\nangular velocity. Unfortunately there were no clouds in the sky, nor\r\nwas he able to include any of the ground in the pictures, so our\r\nestimates of angular velocity had to be made assuming that the\r\nphotographer held his camera still. Had the lone UFO been 10 miles\r\naway it would have been traveling several thousand miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAfter studying the movies for several weeks, the Air Force photo lab\r\nat Wright Field gave up. All they had to say was, \"We don't know what\r\nthey are but they aren't airplanes or balloons, and we don't think\r\nthey are birds.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the lab had been working on the movies at Wright Field, Major\r\nFournet had been talking to the Navy photo people at Anacostia; they\r\nthought they had some good ideas on how to analyze the movies, so as\r\nsoon as we were through with them I sent them to Major Fournet and he\r\ntook them over to the Navy lab.\r\n\r\nThe Navy lab spent about two months studying the films and had just\r\ncompleted their analysis. The men who had done the work were on hand\r\nto brief the panel of scientists on their analysis after the panel\r\nhad seen the movies.\r\n\r\nWe darkened the room and I would imagine that we ran each film ten\r\ntimes before every panel member was satisfied that he had seen and\r\ncould remember all of the details. We ran both films together so that\r\nthe men could compare them.\r\n\r\nThe Navy analysts didn't use the words \"interplanetary spacecraft\"\r\nwhen they told of their conclusions, but they did say that the UFO's\r\nwere intelligently controlled vehicles and that they weren't\r\nairplanes or birds. They had arrived at this conclusion by making a\r\nframe-by-frame study of the motion of the lights and the changes in\r\nthe lights' intensity.\r\n\r\nWhen the Navy people had finished with their presentation, the\r\nscientists had questions. None of the panel members were trying to\r\nfind fault with the work the Navy people had done, but they weren't\r\ngoing to accept the study until they had meticulously searched for\r\nevery loophole. Then they found one.\r\n\r\nIn measuring the brilliance of the lights, the photo analysts had\r\nused an instrument called a densitometer. The astronomer on the panel\r\nknew all about measuring the density of an extremely small\r\nphotographic image with a densitometer because he did it all the time\r\nin his studies of the stars. And the astronomer didn't think that the\r\nNavy analysts had used the correct technique in making their\r\nmeasurements. This didn't necessarily mean that their data were all\r\nwrong, but it did mean that they should recheck their work.\r\n\r\nWhen the discussion of the Navy's report ended, one of the\r\nscientists asked to see the Tremonton Movie again; so I had the\r\nprojectionists run it several more times. The man said that he\r\nthought the UFO's could be sea gulls soaring on a thermal current. He\r\nlived in Berkeley and said that he'd seen gulls high in the air over\r\nSan Francisco Bay. We had thought of this possibility several months\r\nbefore because the area around the Great Salt Lake is inhabited by\r\nlarge white gulls. But the speed of the lone UFO as it left the main\r\ngroup had eliminated the gulls. I pointed this out to the physicist.\r\nHis answer was that the Navy warrant officer might have thought he\r\nhad held the camera steady, but he could have \"panned with the\r\naction\" unconsciously. This would throw all of our computations 'way\r\noff. I agreed with this, but I couldn't agree that they were sea gulls.\r\n\r\nBut several months later I was in San Francisco waiting for an\r\nairliner to Los Angeles and I watched gulls soaring in a cloudless\r\nsky. They were \"riding a thermal,\" and they were so high that you\r\ncouldn't see them until they banked just a certain way; then they\r\nappeared to be a bright white  flash, much larger than one would\r\nexpect from sea gulls. There was a strong resemblance to the UFO's in\r\nthe Tremonton Movie. But I'm not sure that this is the answer.\r\n\r\nThe presentation of the two movies ended Project Blue Book's part of\r\nthe meeting. In five days we had given the panel of scientists every\r\npertinent detail in the history of the UFO, and it was up to them to\r\ntell us if they were real--some type of vehicle flying through our\r\natmosphere. If they were real, then they would have to be spacecraft\r\nbecause no one at the meeting gave a second thought to the\r\npossibility that the UFO's might be a supersecret U.S. aircraft or a\r\nSoviet development. The scientists knew everything that was going on\r\nin the U.S. and they knew that no country in the world had developed\r\ntheir technology far enough to build a craft that would perform as\r\nthe UFO's were reported to do. In addition, we were spending billions\r\nof dollars on the research and development and the procurement of\r\nairplanes that were just nudging the speed of sound. It would be\r\nabsurd to think that these billions were being spent to cover the\r\nexistence of a UFO-type weapon. And it would be equally absurd to\r\nthink that the British, French, Russians or any other country could\r\nbe far enough ahead of us to have a UFO.\r\n\r\nThe scientists spent the next two days pondering a conclusion. They\r\nreread reports and looked at the two movies again and again, they\r\ncalled other scientists to double-check certain ideas that they had,\r\nand they discussed the problem among themselves. Then they wrote out\r\ntheir conclusions and each man signed the document. The first\r\nparagraph said:\r\n\r\nWe as a group do not believe that it is impossible for some other\r\ncelestial body to be inhabited by intelligent creatures. Nor is it\r\nimpossible that these creatures could have reached such a state of\r\ndevelopment that they could visit the earth. However, there is\r\nnothing in all of the so-called \"flying saucer\" reports that we have\r\nread that would indicate that this is taking place.\r\n\r\nThe Tremonton Movie had been rejected as proof but the panel did\r\nleave the door open a crack when they suggested that the Navy photo\r\nlab redo their study. But the Navy lab never rechecked their report,\r\nand it was over a year later before new data came to light.\r\n\r\nAfter I got out of the Air Force I met Newhouse and talked to him\r\nfor two hours. I've talked to many people who have reported UFO's,\r\nbut few impressed me as much as Newhouse. I learned that when he and\r\nhis family first saw the UFO's they were close to the car, much\r\ncloser than when he took the movie. To use Newhouse's own words, \"If\r\nthey had been the size of a B-29 they would have been at 10,000 feet\r\naltitude.\" And the Navy man and his family had taken a good look at\r\nthe objects--they looked like \"two pie pans, one inverted on the top\r\nof the other!\" He didn't just _think_ the UFO's were disk-shaped; he\r\n_knew_ that they were; he had plainly seen them. I asked him why he\r\nhadn't told this to the intelligence officer who interrogated him. He\r\nsaid that he had. Then I remembered that I'd sent the intelligence\r\nofficer a list of questions I wanted Newhouse to answer. The question\r\n\"What did the UFO's look like?\" wasn't one of them because when you\r\nhave a picture of something you don't normally ask what it looks\r\nlike. Why the intelligence officer didn't pass this information on to\r\nus I'll never know.\r\n\r\nThe Montana Movie was rejected by the panel as positive proof\r\nbecause even though the two observers said that the jets were in\r\nanother part of the sky when they saw the UFO's and our study backed\r\nthem up, there was still a chance that the two UFO's could have been\r\nthe two jets. We couldn't prove the UFO's were the jets, but neither\r\ncould we prove they weren't.\r\n\r\nThe controversial study of the UFO's' motions that Major Fournet had\r\npresented was discarded. All of the panel agreed that if there had\r\nbeen some permanent record of the motion of the UFO's, a photograph\r\nof a UFO's flight path or a photograph of a UFO's track on a\r\nradarscope, they could have given the study much more weight. But in\r\nevery one of the ten or twenty reports that were offered as proof\r\nthat the UFO's were intelligently controlled, the motions were only\r\nthose that the observer had seen. And the human eye and mind are not\r\naccurate recorders. How many different stories do you get when a\r\ngroup of people watch two cars collide at an intersection?\r\n\r\nEach of the fifty of our best sightings that we gave the scientists\r\nto study had some kind of a loophole. In many cases the loopholes\r\nwere extremely small, but scientific evaluation has no room for even\r\nthe smallest of loopholes and we had asked for a scientific evaluation.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished commenting on the reports, the scientists\r\npointed out the seriousness of the decision they had been asked to\r\nmake. They said that they had tried hard to be objective and not to\r\nbe picayunish, but actually all we had was circumstantial evidence.\r\nGood circumstantial evidence, to be sure, but we had nothing\r\nconcrete, no hardware, no photos showing any detail of a UFO, no\r\nmeasured speeds, altitudes, or sizes--nothing in the way of good,\r\nhard, cold, scientific facts. To stake the future course of millions\r\nof lives on a decision based upon circumstantial evidence would be\r\none of the gravest mistakes in the history of the world.\r\n\r\nIn their conclusions they touched upon the possibility that the\r\nUFO's might be some type of new or yet undiscovered natural\r\nphenomenon. They explained that they hadn't given this too much\r\ncredence; however, if the UFO's were a new natural phenomenon, the\r\nreports of their general appearance should follow a definite pattern--\r\nthe UFO reports didn't.\r\n\r\nThis ended the section of the panel's report that covered their\r\nconclusions. The next section was entitled, \"Recommendations.\" I\r\nfully expected that they would recommend that we as least reduce the\r\nactivities of Project Blue Book if not cancel it entirely. I didn't\r\nlike this one bit because I was firmly convinced that we didn't have\r\nthe final answer. We needed more and better proof before a final yes\r\nor no could be given.\r\n\r\nThe panel didn't recommend that the activities of Blue Book be cut\r\nback, and they didn't recommend that it be dropped. They recommended\r\nthat it be expanded. Too many of the reports had been made by\r\ncredible observers, the report said, people who should know what\r\nthey're looking at--people who think things out carefully. Data that\r\nwas out of the circumstantial-evidence class was badly needed. And\r\nthe panel must have been at least partially convinced that an\r\nexpanded effort would prove something interesting because the\r\nexpansion they recommended would require a considerable sum of money.\r\nThe investigative force of Project Blue Book should be quadrupled in\r\nsize, they wrote, and it should be staffed by specially trained\r\nexperts in the fields of electronics, meteorology, photography,\r\nphysics, and other fields of science pertinent to UFO investigations.\r\nEvery effort should be made to set up instruments in locations where\r\nUFO sightings are frequent, so that data could be measured and\r\nrecorded during a sighting. In other locations around the country\r\nmilitary and civilian scientists should be alerted and instructed to\r\nuse every piece of available equipment that could be used to track\r\nUFO's.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, they said that the American public should be told every\r\ndetail of every phase of the UFO investigation--the details of the\r\nsightings, the official conclusions, and why the conclusions were\r\nmade. This would serve a double purpose; it would dispel any of the\r\nmystery that security breeds and it would keep the Air Force on the\r\nball--sloppy investigations and analyses would never occur.\r\n\r\nWhen the panel's conclusions were made known in the government, they\r\nmet with mixed reactions. Some people were satisfied, but others\r\nweren't. Even the opinions of a group of the country's top scientists\r\ncouldn't overcome the controversy that had dogged the UFO for five\r\nyears. Some of those who didn't like the decision had sat in on the\r\nUFO's trial as spectators and they felt that the \"jury\" was\r\ndefinitely prejudiced-- afraid to stick their necks out. They could\r\nsee no reason to continue to assume that the UFO's weren't\r\ninterplanetary vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\r\n\r\nWhat Are UFO's?\r\n\r\nWhile the scientists were in Washington, D.C., pondering over the\r\nUFO, the UFO's weren't just sitting idly by waiting to find out what\r\nthey were--they were out doing a little \"lobbying\" for the cause--\r\nkeeping the interest stirred up.\r\n\r\nAnd they were doing a good job, too.\r\n\r\nIt was just a few minutes before midnight on January 28, 1953, when\r\na message flashed into Wright-Patterson for Project Blue Book. It was\r\nsent \"Operational Immediate,\" so it had priority handling; I was\r\nreading it by 12:30A.M. A pilot had chased a UFO.\r\n\r\nThe report didn't have many details but it did sound good. It gave\r\nthe pilot's name and said that he could be reached at Moody AFB. I\r\nput in a long-distance call, found the pilot, and flipped on my\r\nrecorder so that I could get his story word for word.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he had been flying an F-86 on a \"round-robin\"\r\nnavigation flight from Moody AFB to Lawson AFB to Robins AFB, then\r\nback to Moody--all in Georgia. At exactly nine thirty-five he was at\r\n6,000 feet, heading toward Lawson AFB on the first leg of his flight.\r\nHe remembered that he had just looked down and had seen the lights of\r\nAlbany, Georgia; then he'd looked up again and seen this bright white\r\nlight at \"ten o'clock high.\" It was an unusually bright light, and he\r\nsaid that he thought this was why it was so noticeable among the\r\nstars. He flew on for a few minutes watching it as he passed over\r\nAlbany. He decided that it must be an extremely bright star or\r\nanother airplane--except it just didn't look right. It had too much\r\nof a definitely circular shape.\r\n\r\nIt was a nice night to fly and he had to get in so much time anyway,\r\nso he thought he'd try to get a little closer to it. If it was an\r\nairplane, chances were he could close in and if it was a star, he\r\nshould be able to climb up to 30,000 feet and the light shouldn't\r\nchange its relative position. He checked his oxygen supply, increased\r\nthe r.p.m. of the engine, and started to climb. In three or four\r\nminutes it was obvious that he was getting above the light, and he\r\nwatched it; it had moved in relation to the  stars. It must be an\r\nairplane then, he'd decided--an airplane so far away that he couldn't\r\nsee its red and green wing tip lights.\r\n\r\nSince he'd gone this far, he decided that he'd get closer and make\r\nsure it _was_ an airplane; so he dropped the nose of the F-86 and\r\nstarted down. As the needle on the machmeter nudged the red line, he\r\nsaw that he was getting closer because the light was getting bigger,\r\nbut still he couldn't see any lights other than the one big white\r\none. Then it wasn't white any longer; it was changing color. In about\r\na two-second cycle it changed from white to red, then back to white\r\nagain. It went through this cycle two or three times, and then before\r\nhe could realize what was going on, he told me, the light changed in\r\nshape to a perfect triangle. Then it split into two triangles, one\r\nabove the other. By this time he had leveled off and wasn't closing\r\nin any more. In a flash the whole thing was gone. He used the old\r\nstandard description for a disappearing UFO: \"It was just like\r\nsomeone turning off a light--it's there, then it's gone.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him what he thought he'd seen. He'd thought about flying\r\nsaucers, he said, but he \"just couldn't swallow those stories.\" He\r\nthought he had a case of vertigo and the more he thought about it,\r\nthe surer he was that this was the answer. He'd felt pretty foolish,\r\nhe told me, and he was glad that he was alone.\r\n\r\nUp ahead he saw the sprawling lights of Fort Benning and Lawson AFB,\r\nhis turning point on the flight, and he'd started to turn but then\r\nhe'd checked his fuel. The climb had used up quite a bit, so he\r\nchanged his mind about going to Robins AFB and started straight back\r\nto Moody.\r\n\r\nHe called in to the ground station to change his flight plan, but\r\nbefore he could say anything the ground radio operator asked him if\r\nhe'd seen a mysterious light.\r\n\r\nWell--he'd seen a light.\r\n\r\nThen the ground operator proceeded to tell him that the UFO chase\r\nhad been watched on radar. First the radar had the UFO target on the\r\nscope, and it was a UFO because it was traveling much too slowly to\r\nbe an airplane. Then the radar operators saw the F-86 approach,\r\nclimb, and make a shallow dive toward the UFO. At first the F-86 had\r\nclosed in on the UFO, but then the UFO had speeded up just enough to\r\nmaintain a comfortable lead. This went on for two or three minutes;\r\nthen it had moved off the scope at a terrific speed. The radar site\r\nhad tried to call him, the ground station told the F-86 pilot, but\r\nthey couldn't raise him so the message had to be relayed through the\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nRack up two more points for the UFO--another unknown and another\r\nconfirmed believer.\r\n\r\nTwo or three weeks after the meeting of the panel of scientists in\r\nWashington I received word that Project Blue Book would follow the\r\nrecommendations that the panel had made. I was to start implementing\r\nthe plan right away. Our proposal for setting up instruments had gone\r\nto the Pentagon weeks before, so that was already taken care of. We\r\nneeded more people, so I drew up a new organizational cable that\r\ncalled for more investigators and analysts and sent it through to\r\nATIC's personnel section.\r\n\r\nAbout this time in the history of the UFO the first of a series of\r\nsnags came up. The scientists had strongly recommended that we hold\r\nnothing back--give the public everything. Accordingly, when the press\r\ngot wind of the Tremonton Movie, which up until this time had been a\r\nclosely guarded secret, I agreed to release it for the newsmen to\r\nsee. I wrote a press release which was O.K.'d by General Garland,\r\nthen the chief of ATIC, and sent it to the Pentagon. It told what the\r\npanel had said about the movies, \"until proved otherwise there is no\r\nreason why the UFO's couldn't have been sea gulls.\" Then the release\r\nwent on to say that we weren't sure exactly what the UFO's were, the\r\nsea gull theory was only an opinion. When the Pentagon got the draft\r\nof the release they screamed, \"No!\" No movie for the press and no\r\npress release. The sea gull theory was too weak, and we had a new\r\npublicity policy as of now--don't say anything.\r\n\r\nThis policy, incidentally, is still in effect. The January 7, 1955,\r\nissue of the _Air_ _Force_ _Information_ _Services_ _Letter_ said, in\r\nessence, people in the Air Force are talking too much about UFO's--\r\nshut up. The old theory that if you ignore them they'll go away is\r\nagain being followed.\r\n\r\nInside of a month the UFO project took a few more hard jolts. In\r\nDecember of 1952 I'd asked for a transfer. I'd agreed to stay on as\r\nchief of Blue Book until the end of February so that a replacement\r\ncould be obtained and be broken in. But no replacement showed up. And\r\nnone showed up when Lieutenant Rothstien's tour of active duty ended,\r\nwhen Lieutenant Andy Flues transferred to the Alaskan Air Command, or\r\nwhen others left. When I left the UFO project for a two-month tour of\r\ntemporary duty in Denver, Lieutenant Bob Olsson took over as chief.\r\nHis staff consisted of Airman First Class Max Futch. Both men were\r\nold veterans of the UFO campaign of '52, but two people can do only\r\nso much.\r\n\r\nWhen I came back to ATIC in July 1953 and took over another job,\r\nLieutenant Olsson was just getting out of the Air Force and Al/c\r\nFutch was now it. He said that he felt like the President of\r\nAntarctica on a non-expedition year. In a few days I again had\r\nProject Blue Book, as an additional duty this time, and I had orders\r\nto \"build it up.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I had been gone, our instrumentation plan had been rejected.\r\nHigher headquarters had decided against establishing a net of manned\r\ntracking stations, astronomical cameras tied in with radars, and our\r\nother proposed instrumentation. General Garland had argued long and\r\nhard for the plan, but he'd lost. It was decided that the cameras\r\nwith diffraction gratings over the lenses, the cameras that had been\r\nunder development for a year, would suffice.\r\n\r\nThe camera program had started out as a top-priority project, but it\r\nhad lost momentum fast when we'd tested these widely publicized\r\ninstruments and found that they wouldn't satisfactorily photograph a\r\nmillion-candle power flare at 450 yards. The cameras themselves were\r\nall right, but in combination with the gratings, they were no good.\r\nHowever, Lieutenant Olsson had been told to send them out, so he sent\r\nthem out.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that I did when I returned to Project Blue Book was\r\nto go over the reports that had come in while I was away. There were\r\nseveral good reports but only one that was exceptional. It had taken\r\nplace at Luke AFB, Arizona, the Air Force's advanced fighter-bomber\r\nschool that is named after the famous \"balloon buster\" of World War\r\nI, Lieutenant Frank Luke, Jr. It was a sighting that produced some\r\nvery interesting photographs.\r\n\r\nThere were only a few high cirrus clouds in the sky late on the\r\nmorning of March 3 when a pilot took off from Luke in an F-84 jet to\r\nlog some time. He had been flying F-51's in Korea and had recently\r\nstarted to check out in the jets. He took off, cleared the traffic\r\npattern, and started climbing toward Blythe Radio, about 130 miles\r\nwest of Luke. He'd climbed for several minutes and had just picked up\r\nthe coded letters BLH that identified Blythe Radio when he looked up\r\nthrough the corner glass in the front part of his canopy--high at\r\nabout two o'clock he saw what he thought was an airplane angling\r\nacross his course from left to right leaving a long, thin vapor\r\ntrail. He glanced down at his altimeter and saw that he was at 23,000\r\nfeet. The object that was leaving the vapor trail must really be\r\nhigh, he remembered thinking, because he couldn't see any airplane at\r\nthe head of it. He altered his course a few degrees to the right so\r\nthat he could follow the trail and increased his rate of climb.\r\nBefore long he could tell that he was gaining on the object, or\r\nwhatever was leaving the vapor trail, because he was under the\r\ncentral part of it. But he still couldn't see any object. This was\r\nodd, he thought, because vapor trails don't just happen; something\r\nhas to leave them. His altimeter had ticked off another 12,000 feet\r\nand he was now at 35,000. He kept on climbing, but soon the '84 began\r\nto mush; it was as high as it would go. The pilot dropped down 1,000\r\nfeet and continued on--now he was below the front of the trail, but\r\nstill no airplane. This bothered him too. Nothing that we have flies\r\nover 55,000 feet except a few experimental airplanes like the D-558\r\nor those of the \"X\" series, and they don't stray far from Edwards AFB\r\nin California. He couldn't be more than 15,000 feet from the front of\r\nthe trail, and you can recognize any kind of an airplane 15,000 feet\r\naway in the clear air of the substratosphere. He looked and he looked\r\nand he looked. He rocked the F-84 back and forth thinking maybe he\r\nhad a flaw in the plexiglass of the canopy that was blinking out the\r\nairplane, but still no airplane. Whatever it was, it was darn high or\r\ndarn small. It was moving about 300 miles an hour because he had to\r\npull off power and \"S\" to stay under it.\r\n\r\nHe was beginning to get low on fuel about this time so he hauled up\r\nthe nose of the jet, took about 30 feet of gun camera film, and\r\nstarted down. When he landed and told his story, the film was quickly\r\nprocessed and rushed to the projection room. It showed a weird, thin,\r\nforked vapor trail--but no airplane.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Olsson and Airman Futch had worked this one over\r\nthoroughly. The photo lab confirmed that the trail was definitely a\r\nvapor trail, not a freak cloud formation. But Air Force Flight\r\nService said, \"No other airplanes in the area,\" and so did Air\r\nDefense Command, because minutes after the F-84 pilot broke off\r\ncontact, the \"object\" had passed into an ADIZ--Air Defense\r\nIdentification Zone--and radar had shown nothing.\r\n\r\nThere was one last possibility: Blue Book's astronomer said that the\r\nphotos looked exactly like a meteor's smoke trail. But there was one\r\nhitch: the pilot was positive that the head of the vapor trail was\r\nmoving at about 300 miles an hour. He didn't know exactly how much\r\nground he'd covered, but when he first picked up Blythe Radio he was\r\non Green 5 airway, about 30 miles west of his base, and when he'd\r\ngiven up the chase he'd gotten another radio bearing, and he was now\r\nalmost up to Needles Radio, 70 miles north of Blythe. He could see a\r\nlake, Lake Mojave, in the distance.\r\n\r\nCould a high-altitude jet-stream wind have been blowing the smoke\r\ncloud? Futch had checked this--no. The winds above 20,000 feet were\r\nthe usual westerlies and the jet stream was far to the north.\r\n\r\nSeveral months later I talked to a captain who had been at Luke when\r\nthis sighting occurred. He knew the F-84 pilot and he'd heard him\r\ntell his story in great detail. I won't say that he was a confirmed\r\nbeliever, but he was interested. \"I never thought much about these\r\nreports before,\" he said, \"but I know this guy well. He's not nuts.\r\nWhat do you think he saw?\"\r\n\r\nI don't know what he saw. Maybe he didn't travel as far as he\r\nthought he did. If he didn't, then I'd guess that he saw a meteor's\r\nsmoke trail. But if he did know that he'd covered some 80 miles\r\nduring the chase, I'd say that he saw a UFO--a real one. And I find\r\nit hard to believe that pilots don't know what they're doing.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1953, UFO reports dropped off considerably.\r\nDuring May, June, and July of 1952 we'd received 637 good reports.\r\nDuring the same months in 1953 we received only seventy-six. We had\r\nbeen waiting for the magic month of July to roll around again because\r\nevery July there had been the sudden and unexplained peak in\r\nreporting; we wanted to know if it would happen again. It didn't--\r\nonly twenty-one reports came in, to make July the lowest month of the\r\nyear. But July did bring new developments.\r\n\r\nProject Blue Book got a badly needed shot in the arm when an\r\nunpublicized but highly important change took place: another\r\nintelligence agency began to take over all field investigations.\r\n\r\nEver since I'd returned to the project, the orders had been to build\r\nit up--get more people--do what the panel recommended. But when I'd\r\nasked for more people, all I got was a polite \"So sorry.\" So, I did\r\nthe next best thing and tried to find some organization already in\r\nbeing which could and would help us. I happened to be expounding my\r\ntroubles one day at Air Defense Command Headquarters while I was\r\nbriefing General Burgess, ADC's Director of Intelligence, and he told\r\nme about his 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron, a specialized\r\nintelligence unit that had recently become operational. Maybe it\r\ncould help--he'd see what he could work out, he told me.\r\n\r\nNow in the military all commitments to do something carry an almost\r\nstandard time factor. \"I'll expedite it,\" means nothing will happen\r\nfor at least two weeks. \"I'll do it right away,\" means from a month\r\nto six weeks. An answer like, \"I'll see what I can work out,\"\r\nrequires writing a memo that explains what the person was going to\r\nsee if he could work out and sealing it in a time capsule for\r\npreservation so that when the answer finally does come through the\r\nfuture generation that receives it will know how it all started. But\r\nI underestimated the efficiency of the Air Defense Command. Inside of\r\ntwo weeks General Burgess had called General Garland, they'd\r\ndiscussed the problem, and I was back in Colorado Springs setting up\r\na program with Colonel White's 4602nd.\r\n\r\nThe 4602nd's primary function is to interrogate captured enemy\r\nairmen during wartime; in peacetime all that they can do is\r\nparticipate in simulated problems. Investigating UFO reports would\r\nsupplement these problems and add a factor of realism that would be\r\ninvaluable in their training. The 4602nd had field teams spread out\r\nall over the United States, and these teams could travel anywhere by\r\nairplane, helicopter, canoe, jeep, or skis on a minute's notice. The\r\nfield teams had already established a working contact with the\r\nhighway patrols, sheriffs' offices, police, and the other military in\r\ntheir respective areas, so they were in an excellent position to\r\ncollect facts about a UFO report. Each member of the field teams had\r\nbeen especially chosen and trained in the art of interrogation, and\r\neach team had a technical specialist. We couldn't have asked for a\r\nbetter ally.\r\n\r\nProject Blue Book was once more back in business. Until the formal\r\npaper work went through, our plan was that whenever a UFO report\r\nworth investigating came in we would call the 4602nd and they would\r\nget a team out right away. The team would make a thorough\r\ninvestigation and wire us their report. If the answer came back\r\n\"Unknown,\" we would study the details of the sighting and, with the\r\nhelp of Project Bear, try to find the answer.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the final plans had been made with the 4602nd, I\r\nagain bade farewell to Project Blue Book. In a simple ceremony on the\r\npoop deck of one of the flying saucers that I frequently have been\r\naccused of capturing, before a formation of the three-foot-tall green\r\nmen that I have equally as frequently been accused of keeping\r\nprisoner, I turned my command over to Al/c Max Futch and walked out\r\nthe door into civilian life with separation orders in hand.\r\n\r\nThe UFO's must have known that I was leaving because the day I found\r\nout that officers with my specialty, technical intelligence, were no\r\nlonger on the critical list and that I could soon get out of the\r\nservice, they really put on a show. The show they put on is still the\r\nbest UFO report in the Air Force files.\r\n\r\nI first heard about the sighting about two o'clock on the morning of\r\nAugust 13, 1953, when Max Futch called me from ATIC. A few minutes\r\nbefore a wire had come in carrying a priority just under that\r\nreserved for flashing the word the U.S. has been attacked. Max had\r\nbeen called over to ATIC by the OD to see the report, and he thought\r\nthat I should see it. I was a little hesitant to get dressed and go\r\nout to the base, so I asked Max what he thought about the report. His\r\nclassic answer will go down in UFO history, \"Captain,\" Max said in\r\nhis slow, pure Louisiana drawl, \"you know that for a year I've read\r\nevery flying saucer report that's come in and that I never really\r\nbelieved in the things.\" Then he hesitated and added, so fast that I\r\ncould hardly understand him, \"But you should read _this_ wire.\" The\r\nspeed with which he uttered this last statement was in itself enough\r\nto convince me. When Max talked fast, something was important.\r\n\r\nA half hour later I was at ATIC--just in time to get a call from the\r\nPentagon. Someone else had gotten out of bed to read his copy of the\r\nwire. I used the emergency orders that I always kept in my desk and\r\ncaught the first airliner out of Dayton to Rapid City, South Dakota.\r\nI didn't call the 4602nd because I wanted to investigate this one\r\npersonally. I talked to everyone involved in the incident and pieced\r\ntogether an amazing story.\r\n\r\nShortly after dark on the night of the twelfth, the Air Defense\r\nCommand radar station at Ellsworth AFB, just east of Rapid City, had\r\nreceived a call from the local Ground Observer Corps filter center. A\r\nlady spotter at Black Hawk, about 10 miles west of Ellsworth, had\r\nreported an extremely bright light low on the horizon, off to the\r\nnortheast. The radar had been scanning an area to the west, working a\r\njet fighter in some practice patrols, but when they got the report\r\nthey moved the sector scan to the northeast quadrant. There was a\r\ntarget exactly where the lady reported the light to be. The warrant\r\nofficer, who was the duty controller for the night, told me that he'd\r\nstudied the target for several minutes. He knew how weather could\r\naffect radar but this target was \"well defined, solid, and bright.\"\r\nIt seemed to be moving, but very slowly. He called for an altitude\r\nreading, and the man on the height-finding radar checked his scope.\r\nHe also had the target--it was at 16,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe warrant officer picked up the phone and asked the filter center\r\nto connect him with the spotter. They did, and the two people\r\ncompared notes on the UFO's position for several minutes. But right\r\nin the middle of a sentence the lady suddenly stopped and excitedly\r\nsaid, \"It's starting to move--it's moving southwest toward Rapid.\"\r\n\r\nThe controller looked down at his scope and the target was beginning\r\nto pick up speed and move southwest. He yelled at two of his men to\r\nrun outside and take a look. In a second or two one of them shouted\r\nback that they could both see a large bluish-white light moving\r\ntoward Rapid City. The controller looked down at his scope--the\r\ntarget was moving toward Rapid City. As all three parties watched the\r\nlight and kept up a steady cross conversation of the description, the\r\nUFO swiftly made a wide sweep around Rapid City and returned to its\r\noriginal position in the sky.\r\n\r\nA master sergeant who had seen and heard the happenings told me that\r\nin all his years of duty--combat radar operations in both Europe and\r\nKorea--he'd never been so completely awed by anything. When the\r\nwarrant officer had yelled down at him and asked him what he thought\r\nthey should do, he'd just stood there. \"After all,\" he told me, \"what\r\nin hell could we do--they're bigger than all of us.\"\r\n\r\nBut the warrant officer did do something. He called to the F-84\r\npilot he had on combat air patrol west of the base and told him to\r\nget ready for an intercept. He brought the pilot around south of the\r\nbase and gave him a course correction that would take him right into\r\nthe light, which was still at 16,000 feet. By this time the pilot had\r\nit spotted. He made the turn, and when he closed to within about 3\r\nmiles of the target, it began to move. The controller saw it begin to\r\nmove, the spotter saw it begin to move and the pilot saw it begin to\r\nmove--all at the same time. There was now no doubt that all of them\r\nwere watching the same object.\r\n\r\nOnce it began to move, the UFO picked up speed fast and started to\r\nclimb, heading north, but the F-84 was right on its tail. The pilot\r\nwould notice that the light was getting brighter, and he'd call the\r\ncontroller to tell him about it. But the controller's answer would\r\nalways be the same, \"Roger, we can see it on the scope.\"\r\n\r\nThere was always a limit as to how near the jet could get, however.\r\nThe controller told me that it was just as if the UFO had some kind\r\nof an automatic warning radar linked to its power supply. When\r\nsomething got too close to it, it would automatically pick up speed\r\nand pull away. The separation distance always remained about 3 miles.\r\n\r\nThe chase continued on north--out of sight of the lights of Rapid\r\nCity and the base--into some very black night.\r\n\r\nWhen the UFO and the F-84 got about 120 miles to the north, the\r\npilot checked his fuel; he had to come back. And when I talked to\r\nhim, he said he was damn glad that he was running out of fuel because\r\nbeing out over some mighty desolate country alone with a UFO can\r\ncause some worry.\r\n\r\nBoth the UFO and the F-84 had gone off the scope, but in a few\r\nminutes the jet was back on, heading for home. Then 10 or 15 miles\r\nbehind it was the UFO target also coming back.\r\n\r\nWhile the UFO and the F-84 were returning to the base--the F-84 was\r\nplanning to land--the controller received a call from the jet\r\ninterceptor squadron on the base. The alert pilots at the squadron\r\nhad heard the conversations on their radio and didn't believe it.\r\n\"Who's nuts up there?\" was the comment that passed over the wire from\r\nthe pilots to the radar people. There was an F-84 on the line ready\r\nto scramble, the man on the phone said, and one of the pilots, a\r\nWorld War II and Korean veteran, wanted to go up and see a flying\r\nsaucer. The controller said, \"O.K., go.\"\r\n\r\nIn a minute or two the F-84 was airborne and the controller was\r\nworking him toward the light. The pilot saw it right away and closed\r\nin. Again the light began to climb out, this time more toward the\r\nnortheast. The pilot also began to climb, and before long the light,\r\nwhich at first had been about 30 degrees above his horizontal line of\r\nsight, was now below him. He nosed the '84 down to pick up speed, but\r\nit was the same old story--as soon as he'd get within 3 miles of the\r\nUFO, it would put on a burst of speed and stay out ahead.\r\n\r\nEven though the pilot could see the light and hear the ground\r\ncontroller telling him that he was above it, and alternately gaining\r\non it or dropping back, he still couldn't believe it--there must be a\r\nsimple explanation. He turned off all of his lights--it wasn't a\r\nreflection from any of the airplane's lights because there it was. A\r\nreflection from a ground light, maybe. He rolled the airplane--the\r\nposition of the light didn't change. A star--he picked out three\r\nbright stars near the light and watched carefully. The UFO moved in\r\nrelation to the three stars. Well, he thought to himself, if it's a\r\nreal object out there, my radar should pick it up too; so he flipped\r\non his radar-ranging gunsight. In a few seconds the red light on his\r\nsight blinked on--something real and solid was in front of him. Then\r\nhe was scared. When I talked to him, he readily admitted that he'd\r\nbeen scared. He'd met MD 109's, FW 190's and ME 262's over Germany\r\nand he'd met MIG-15's over Korea but the large, bright, bluish-white\r\nlight had scared him--he asked the controller if he could break off\r\nthe intercept.\r\n\r\nThis time the light didn't come back.\r\n\r\nWhen the UFO went off the scope it was headed toward Fargo, North\r\nDakota, so the controller called the Fargo filter center. \"Had they\r\nhad any reports of unidentified lights?\" he asked. They hadn't.\r\n\r\nBut in a few minutes a call came back. Spotter posts on a southwest-\r\nnortheast line a few miles west of Fargo had reported a fast-moving,\r\nbright bluish-white light.\r\n\r\nThis was an unknown--the best.\r\n\r\nThe sighting was thoroughly investigated, and I could devote pages\r\nof detail on how we looked into every facet of the incident; but it\r\nwill suffice to say that in every facet we looked into we saw\r\nnothing. Nothing but a big question mark asking what was it.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Project Blue Book and the Air Force I severed all\r\nofficial associations with the UFO. But the UFO is like hard drink;\r\nyou always seem to drift back to it. People I've met, people at work,\r\nand friends of friends are continually asking about the subject. In\r\nthe past few months the circulation manager of a large Los Angeles\r\nnewspaper, one of Douglas Aircraft Company's top scientists, a man\r\nwho is guiding the future development of the supersecret Atlas\r\nintercontinental guided missile, a movie star, and a German rocket\r\nexpert have called me and wanted to get together to talk about UFO's.\r\nSome of them had seen one.\r\n\r\nI have kept up with the activity of the UFO and Project Blue Book\r\nover the past two years through friends who are still in\r\nintelligence. Before Max Futch got out of the Air Force and went back\r\nto law school he wrote to me quite often and a part of his letters\r\nwere always devoted to the latest about the UFO's.\r\n\r\nThen I make frequent business trips to ATIC, and I always stop in to\r\nsee Captain Charles Hardin, who is now in charge of Blue Book, for a\r\n\"What's new?\" I always go to ATIC with the proper security clearances\r\nso I'm sure I get a straight answer to my question.\r\n\r\nSince I left ATIC, the UFO's haven't gone away and neither has the\r\ninterest. There hasn't been too much about them in the newspapers\r\nbecause of the present Air Force policy of silence, but they're with\r\nus. That the interest is still with us is attested to by the fact\r\nthat in late 1953 Donald Keyhoe's book about UFO's, _Flying_\r\n_Saucers_ _from_ _Outer_ _Space_, immediately appeared on best seller\r\nlists. The book was based on a few of our good UFO reports that were\r\nreleased to the press. To say that the book is factual depends\r\nentirely upon how one uses the word. The details of the specific UFO\r\nsightings that he credits to the Air Force are factual, but in his\r\ninterpretations of the incidents he blasts way out into the wild blue\r\nyonder.\r\n\r\nDuring the past two years the bulk of the UFO activity has taken\r\nplace in Europe. I might add here that I have never seen any recent\r\nofficial UFO reports or studies from other countries; all of my\r\ninformation about the European Flap came from friends. But when these\r\nfriends are in the intelligence branches of the U.S. Air Force, the\r\nRAF, and the Royal Netherlands Air Force, the data can be considered\r\nat least good.\r\n\r\nThe European Flap started in the summer of 1953, when reports began\r\nto pop up in England and France. Quality-wise these first reports\r\nweren't too good, however. But then, like a few reports that occurred\r\nearly in the stateside Big Flap of 1952, sightings began to drift in\r\nthat packed a bit of a jolt. Reports came in that had been made by\r\npersonal friends of the brass in the British and French Air Forces.\r\nThen some of the brass saw them. Corners of mouths started down.\r\n\r\nIn September several radar sites in the London area picked up\r\nunidentified targets streaking across the city at altitudes of from\r\n44,000 to 68,000 feet. The crews who saw the targets said, \"Not\r\nweather,\" and some of these crews had been through the bloody Battle\r\nof Britain. They knew their radar.\r\n\r\nIn October the crew of a British European Airways airliner reported\r\nthat a \"strange aerial object\" had paced their twin-engined\r\nElizabethan for thirty minutes. Then on November 3, about two-thirty\r\nin the afternoon, radar in the London area again picked up targets.\r\nThis time two Vampire jets were scrambled and the pilots saw a\r\n\"strange aerial object.\" The men at the radar site saw it too;\r\nthrough their telescope it looked like a \"flat, white-coloured tennis\r\nball.\"\r\n\r\nThe flap continued into 1954. In January those people who officially\r\nkeep track of the UFO's pricked up their ears when the report of two\r\nSwedish airline pilots came in. The pilots had gotten a good look\r\nbefore the UFO had streaked into a cloud bank. It looked like a\r\ndiscus with a hump in the middle.\r\n\r\nOn through the spring reports poured out of every country in Europe.\r\nSome were bad, some were good.\r\n\r\nOn July 3, 1954, at eight-fifteen in the morning, the captain, the\r\nofficers and 463 passengers on a Dutch ocean liner watched a\r\n\"greenish-colored, saucer-shaped object about half the size of a full\r\nmoon\" as it sped across the sky and disappeared into a patch of high\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nThere was one fully documented and substantiated case of a \"landing\"\r\nduring the flap. On August 25 two young ladies in Mosjoen, Norway,\r\nmade every major newspaper in the world when they encountered a\r\n\"saucer-man.\" They said that they were picking berries when suddenly\r\na dark man, with long shaggy hair, stepped out from behind some\r\nbushes. He was friendly; he stepped right up to them and started to\r\ntalk rapidly. The two young ladies could understand English but they\r\ncouldn't understand him. At first they were frightened, but his smile\r\nsoon \"disarmed\" them. He drew a few pictures of flying saucers and\r\npointed up in the sky. \"He was obviously trying to make a point,\" one\r\nof the young ladies said.\r\n\r\nA few days later it was discovered that the man from \"outer space\"\r\nwas a lost USAF helicopter pilot who was flying with NATO forces in\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nAs I've always said, \"Ya gotta watch those Air Force pilots--\r\nespecially those shaggy-haired ones from Brooklyn.\"\r\n\r\nThe reporting spread to Italy, where thousands of people in Rome saw\r\na strange cigar-shaped object hang over the city for forty minutes.\r\nNewspapers claimed that Italian Air Force radar had the UFO on their\r\nscopes, but as far as I could determine, this was never officially\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\nIn December a photograph of two UFO's over Taormina, Sicily,\r\nappeared in many newspapers. The picture showed three men standing on\r\na bridge, with a fourth running up with a camera. All were intently\r\nwatching two disk-shaped objects. The photo looked good, but there\r\nwas one flaw, the men weren't looking at the UFO's; they were looking\r\noff to the right of them. I'm inclined to agree with Captain Hardin\r\nof Blue Book--the photographer just fouled up on his double exposure.\r\n\r\nSightings spread across southern Europe, and at the end of October,\r\nthe Yugoslav Government expressed official interest. Belgrade\r\nnewspapers said that a \"thoughtful inquiry\" would be set up, since\r\nreports had come from \"control tower operators, weather stations and\r\nhundreds of farmers.\" But the part of the statement that swung the\r\nmost weight was, \"Scientists in astronomical observatories have seen\r\nthese strange objects with their own eyes.\"\r\n\r\nDuring 1954 and the early part of 1955 my friends in Europe tried to\r\nkeep me up-to-date on all of the better reports, but this soon\r\napproached a full-time job. Airline pilots saw them, radar picked\r\nthem up, and military pilots chased them. The press took sides, and\r\nthe controversy that had plagued the U.S. since 1947 bloomed forth in\r\nall its confusion.\r\n\r\nAn ex-Air Chief Marshal in the RAF, Lord Dowding, went to bat for\r\nthe UFO's. The Netherlands Air Chief of Staff said they can't be.\r\nHerman Oberth, the father of the German rocket development, said that\r\nthe UFO's were definitely interplanetary vehicles.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium a senator put the screws on the Secretary of Defense--he\r\nwanted an answer. The Secretary of Defense questioned the idea that\r\nthe saucers were \"real\" and said that the military wasn't officially\r\ninterested. In France a member of parliament received a different\r\nanswer--the French military was interested. The French General Staff\r\nhad set up a committee to study UFO reports.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, Clare Boothe Luce, American Ambassador to Italy, said that\r\nshe had seen a UFO and had no idea what it could be.\r\n\r\nHalfway around the world, in Australia, the UFO's were busy too. At\r\nCanberra Airport the pilot of an RAAF Hawker Sea Fury and a ground\r\nradar station teamed up to get enough data to make an excellent radar-\r\nvisual report.\r\n\r\nIn early 1955 the flap began to die down about as rapidly as it had\r\nflared up, but it had left its mark--many more believers. Even the\r\nhighly respected British aviation magazine, _Aeroplane_, had\r\nsomething to say. One of the editors took a long, hard look at the\r\nover-all UFO picture and concluded, \"Really, old chaps--I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nProbably the most unique part of the whole European Flap was the\r\nfact that the Iron Curtain countries were having their own private\r\nflap. The first indications came in October 1954, when Rumanian\r\nnewspapers blamed the United States for launching a drive to induce a\r\n\"flying saucer psychosis\" in their country. The next month the\r\nHungarian Government hauled an \"expert\" up in front of the microphone\r\nso that he could explain to the populace that UFO's don't really\r\nexist because, \"all 'flying saucer' reports originate in the\r\nbourgeois countries, where they are invented by the capitalist\r\nwarmongers with a view to drawing the people's attention away from\r\ntheir economic difficulties.\"\r\n\r\nNext the U.S.S.R. itself took up the cry along the same lines when\r\nthe voice of the Soviet Army, the newspaper _Red_ _Star_, denounced\r\nthe UFO's as, you guessed it, capitalist propaganda.\r\n\r\nIn 1955 the UFO's were still there because the day before the all-\r\nimportant May Day celebration, a day when the Soviet radio and TV are\r\nnormally crammed with programs plugging the glory of Mother Russia to\r\nget the peasants in the mood for the next day, a member of the Soviet\r\nAcademy of Sciences had to get on the air to calm the people's fears.\r\nHe left out Wall Street and Dulles this time--UFO's just don't exist.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to note that during the whole Iron Curtain Flap,\r\nnot one sighting or complimentary comment about the UFO's was made\r\nover the radio or in the newspapers; yet the flap continued. The\r\nreports were obviously being passed on by word of mouth. This fact\r\nseems to negate the theory that if the newspaper reporters and\r\nnewscasters would give up the UFO's would go away. The people in\r\nRussia were obviously seeing something.\r\n\r\nWhile the European Flap was in progress, the UFO's weren't entirely\r\nneglecting the United States. The number of reports that were coming\r\ninto Project Blue Book were below average, but there were reports.\r\nMany of them would definitely be classed as good, but the best was a\r\nreport from a photo reconnaissance B-29 crew that encountered a UFO\r\nalmost over Dayton.\r\n\r\nAbout 11:00A.M. on May 24, 1954, an RB-29 equipped with some new\r\naerial cameras took off from Wright Field, one of the two airfields\r\nthat make up Wright-Patterson AFB, and headed toward the Air Force's\r\nphotographic test range in Indiana. At exactly twelve noon they were\r\nat 16,000 feet, flying west, about 15 miles northwest of Dayton. A\r\nmajor, a photo officer, was in the nose seat of the '29. All of the\r\ngun sights and the bombsight in the nose had been taken out, so it\r\nwas like sitting in a large picture window--except you just can't get\r\nthis kind of a view anyplace else. The major was enjoying it. He was\r\nleaning forward, looking down, when he saw an extremely bright\r\ncircular-shaped object under and a little behind the airplane. It was\r\nso bright that it seemed to have a mirror finish. He couldn't tell\r\nhow far below him it was but he was sure that it wasn't any higher\r\nthan 6,000 feet above the ground, and it was traveling fast, faster\r\nthan the B-29. It took only about six seconds to cross a section of\r\nland, which meant that it was going about 600 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe major called the crew and told them about the UFO, but neither\r\nthe pilot nor the copilot could see it because it was now directly\r\nunder the B-29. The pilot was just in the process of telling him that\r\nhe was crazy when one of the scanners in an aft blister called in; he\r\nand the other scanner could also see the UFO.\r\n\r\nBeing a photo ship, the RB-29 had cameras--loaded cameras--so the\r\nlogical thing to do would be to take a picture, but during a UFO\r\nsighting logic sometimes gets shoved into the background. In this\r\ncase, however, it didn't, and the major reached down, punched the\r\nbutton on the intervalometer, and the big vertical camera in the aft\r\nsection of the airplane clicked off a photo before the UFO sped away.\r\n\r\nThe photo showed a circular-shaped blob of light exactly as the\r\nmajor had described it to the RB-29 crew. It didn't show any details\r\nof the UFO because the UFO was too bright; it was completely\r\noverexposed on the negative. The circular shape wasn't sharp either;\r\nit had fuzzy edges, but this could have been due to two things: its\r\nextreme brightness, or the fact that it was high, close to the RB-29,\r\nand out of focus. There was no way of telling exactly how high it was\r\nbut if it were at 6,000 feet, as the major estimated, it would have\r\nbeen about 125 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nWorking with people from the photo lab at Wright-Patterson, Captain\r\nHardin from Project Blue Book carried out one of the most complete\r\ninvestigations in UFO history. They checked aircraft flights,\r\nrephotographed the area from high and low altitude to see if they\r\ncould pick up something on the ground that could have been reflecting\r\nlight, and made a minute ground search of the area. They found\r\nabsolutely nothing that could explain the round blob of light, and\r\nthe incident went down as an unknown.\r\n\r\nLike all good \"Unknown\" UFO reports, there are as many opinions as\r\nto what the bright blob of light could have been as there are people\r\nwho've seen the photo. \"Some kind of light phenomenon\" is the\r\nfrequent opinion of those who don't believe. They point out that\r\nthere is no shadow of any kind of a circular object showing on the\r\nground--no shadow, nothing \"solid.\" But if you care to take the time\r\nyou can show that if the object, assuming that this is what it was,\r\nwas above 4,000 feet the shadow would fall out of the picture.\r\n\r\nThen all you get is a blank look from the light phenomenon theorists.\r\n\r\nWith the sighting from the RB-29 and the photograph, all of the\r\nother UFO reports that Blue Book has collected and all of those that\r\ncame out of the European Flap, the big question--the key question--\r\nis: What have the last two years of UFO activity brought out? Have\r\nthere been any important developments?\r\n\r\nSome good reports have come in and the Air Force is sitting on them.\r\nDuring 1954 they received some 450 reports, and once again July was\r\nthe peak month. In the first half of 1955 they had 189. But I can\r\nassure you that these reports add nothing more as far as proof is\r\nconcerned. The quality of the reports has improved, but they still\r\noffer nothing more than the same circumstantial evidence that we\r\npresented to the panel of scientists in early 1953. There have been\r\nno reports in which the speed or altitude of a UFO has been measured,\r\nthere have been no reliable photographs that show any details of a\r\nUFO, and there is no hardware. There is still no real proof.\r\n\r\nSo a public statement that was made in 1952 still holds true: \"The\r\n_possibility_ of the existence of interplanetary craft has never been\r\ndenied by the Air Force, _but_ UFO reports offer absolutely no\r\nauthentic evidence that such interplanetary spacecraft do exist.\"\r\n\r\nBut with the UFO, what is lacking in proof is always made up for in\r\nopinions. To get a qualified opinion, I wrote to a friend, Frederick\r\nC. Durant. Mr. Durant, who is presently the director of a large Army\r\nOrdnance test station, is also a past president of the American\r\nRocket Society and president of the International Astronautical\r\nFederation. For those who are not familiar with these organizations,\r\nthe American Rocket Society is an organization established to promote\r\ninterest and research in space flight and lists as its members\r\npractically every prominent scientist and engineer in the\r\nprofessional fields allied to aeronautics. The International\r\nAstronautical Federation is a world-wide federation of such societies.\r\n\r\nMr. Durant has spent many hours studying UFO reports in the Project\r\nBlue Book files and many more hours discussing them with scientists\r\nthe world over--scientists who are doing research and formulating the\r\nplans for space flight. I asked him what he'd heard about the UFO's\r\nduring the past several years and what he thought about them. This\r\nwas his reply:\r\n\r\nThis past summer at the Annual Congress of the IAF at Innsbruck, as\r\nwell as previous Congresses (Zurich, 1953, Stuttgart, 1952, and\r\nLondon, 1951), none of the delegates representing the rocket and\r\nspace flight societies of all the countries involved had strong\r\nfeelings on the subject of saucers. Their attitude was essentially\r\nthe same as professional members of the American Rocket Society in\r\nthis country. In other words, there appear to be no confirmed saucer\r\nfans in the hierarchy of the professional societies.\r\n\r\nI continue to follow the subject of UFO's primarily because of my\r\nbeing requested for comment on the interplanetary flight aspects. My\r\npersonal feelings have not changed in the past four years, although I\r\ncontinue to keep an objective outlook.\r\n\r\nThere are many other prominent scientists in the world whom I met\r\nwhile I was chief of Project Blue Book who, I'm sure, would give the\r\nsame answer--they've not been able to find any proof, but they\r\ncontinue to keep an objective outlook. There are just enough big\r\nquestion marks sprinkled through the reports to keep their outlook\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\nI know that there are many other scientists in the world who,\r\nalthough they haven't studied the Air Force's UFO files, would limit\r\ntheir comment to a large laugh followed by an \"It can't be.\" But \"It\r\ncan't be's\" are dangerous, if for no other reason than history has\r\nproved them so.\r\n\r\nNot more than a hundred years ago two members of the French Academy\r\nof Sciences were unseated because they supported the idea that\r\n\"stones had fallen from the sky.\" Other distinguished members of the\r\nFrench Academy examined the stones, \"It can't be--stones don't fall\r\nfrom the sky,\" or words to that effect. \"These are common rocks that\r\nhave been struck by lightning.\"\r\n\r\nToday we know that the \"stones from the sky\" were meteorites.\r\n\r\nNot more than fifty years ago Dr. Simon Newcomb, a world-famous\r\nastronomer and the first American since Benjamin Franklin to be made\r\nan associate of the Institute of France, the hierarchy of the world\r\nscience, said, \"It can't be.\" Then he went on to explain that flight\r\nwithout gas bags would require the discovery of some new material or\r\na new force in nature.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time Rear Admiral George W. Melville, then Chief\r\nEngineer for the U.S. Navy, said that attempts to fly heavier-than-\r\nair vehicles was absurd.\r\n\r\nJust a little over ten years ago there was another \"it can't be.\" Ex-\r\nPresident Harry S. Truman recalls in the first volume of the Truman\r\n_Memoirs_ what Admiral William D. Leahy, then Chief of Staff to the\r\nPresident, had to say about the atomic bomb. \"That is the biggest\r\nfool thing we have ever done,\" he is quoted as saying. \"The bomb will\r\nnever go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't believe that \"it can't be.\" I wouldn't class\r\nmyself as a \"believer,\" exactly, because I've seen too many UFO\r\nreports that first appeared to be unexplainable fall to pieces when\r\nthey were thoroughly investigated. But every time I begin to get\r\nskeptical I think of the other reports, the many reports made by\r\nexperienced pilots and radar operators, scientists, and other people\r\nwho know what they're looking at. These reports were thoroughly\r\ninvestigated and they are still unknowns. Of these reports, the radar-\r\nvisual sightings are the most convincing. When a ground radar picks\r\nup a UFO target and a ground observer sees a light where the radar\r\ntarget is located, then a jet interceptor is scrambled to intercept\r\nthe UFO and the pilot also sees the light and gets a radar lock-on\r\nonly to have the UFO almost impudently outdistance him, there is no\r\nsimple answer. We have no aircraft on this earth that can at will so\r\nhandily outdistance our latest jets.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force is still actively engaged in investigating UFO\r\nreports, although during the past six months there have been definite\r\nindications that there is a movement afoot to get Project Blue Book\r\nto swing back to the old Project Grudge philosophy of analyzing UFO\r\nreports--write them all off, regardless. But good UFO reports cannot\r\nbe written off with such answers as fatigued pilots seeing a balloon\r\nor star; \"green\" radar operators with _only_ fifteen years'\r\nexperience watching temperature inversion caused blips on their\r\nradarscopes; or \"a mild form of mass hysteria or war nerves.\" Using\r\nanswers like these, or similar ones, to explain the UFO reports is an\r\nexpedient method of getting the percentage of unknowns down to zero,\r\nbut it is no more valid than turning the hands of a clock ahead to\r\nmake time pass faster. Twice before the riddle of the UFO has been\r\n\"solved,\" only to have the reports increase in both quantity and\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't want to hazard a guess as to what the final outcome of\r\nthe UFO investigation will be, but I am sure that within a few years\r\nthere will be a proven answer. The earth satellite program, which was\r\nrecently announced, research progress in the fields of electronics,\r\nnuclear physics, astronomy, and a dozen other branches of the\r\nsciences will furnish data that will be useful to the UFO\r\ninvestigators. Methods of investigating and analyzing UFO reports\r\nhave improved a hundredfold since 1947 and they are continuing to be\r\nimproved by the diligent work of Captain Charles Hardin, the present\r\nchief of Project Blue Book, his staff, and the 4602nd Air\r\nIntelligence Squadron. Slowly but surely these people are working\r\ncloser to the answer--closer to the proof.\r\n\r\nMaybe the final proven answer will be that all of the UFO's that\r\nhave been reported are merely misidentified known objects. Or maybe\r\nthe many pilots, radar specialists, generals, industrialists,\r\nscientists, and the man on the street who have told me, \"I wouldn't\r\nhave believed it either if I hadn't seen it myself,\" knew what they\r\nwere talking about. Maybe the earth is being visited by\r\ninterplanetary spaceships.\r\n\r\nOnly time will tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\r\n\r\nAnd They're Still Flying\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note:  The following three chapters were added to the\r\nsecond edition text in 1960.]\r\n\r\nFour years have passed since the first seventeen chapters of this\r\nbook were written. During this period hundreds of unidentified flying\r\nobjects have been seen and reported to the Air Force. Pilots, with\r\nthousands of hours of flying time are still reporting them; radar\r\noperators, experts in  their field, are still tracking them; and\r\ncrews on the missile test ranges are photographing them.\r\n\r\nUFO's are not just a fad.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force's Project Blue Book is still very active. Not a week\r\npasses that one of the many teams of its nation wide investigation\r\nnet is not in the field investigating a new UFO report.\r\n\r\nTo pick up the history of the UFO the best place to start is\r\nCincinnati, Ohio, in the late summer of 1955. For some unknown\r\nreason, one of those mysterious factors of the UFO, reports from this\r\nHamilton County city suddenly began to pick up. Mass hysteria, the\r\nold crutch, wasn't a factor because neither the press, the radio nor\r\nTV was even mentioning the words \"flying saucer.\"\r\n\r\nThe reports weren't much in terms of quality. Some lady would see a\r\n\"bobbing white light\"; or a man, putting his car away, would see a\r\n\"star jump.\" These reports, usually passed on to the Air Force\r\nthrough the Air Defense Command's Ground Observer Corps, merely went\r\non the UFO plotting board as a statistic.\r\n\r\nBut before long, in a matter of a week or two, the mass of reports\r\nbegan to draw some official attention because the Ground Observer\r\nCorps spotters themselves began to make UFO reports. At times during\r\nthe middle of August the telephone lines from the GOC observation\r\nposts in Hamilton County (greater Cincinnati) to the filter center in\r\nColumbus would be jammed. Now, even the most cynical Air Force types\r\nwere be-grudgingly raising their eyebrows. These GOC observers were\r\nabout as close to \"experts\" as you can get. Many had spent hundreds\r\nof hours scanning the skies since the GOC went into the operation in\r\n1952 to close the gaps in our radar net. Many held awards for\r\nmeritorious service. They weren't crackpots.\r\n\r\nBut still the cynics held out. This was really nothing new. The\r\nProject Blue Book files were full of similar incidents. In 1947 there\r\nhad been a rash of reports from the Pacific Northwest; in 1948 there\r\nhad been a similar outbreak at Edwards Air Force Base, the\r\nsupersecret test center in the Mojave Desert of California; in 1949\r\nthe sightings centered in the midwest. None had panned out to be\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThen came the clincher.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 23rd, shortly before midnight, reports of a\r\nUFO began to come in from the Mt. Healthy GOC observation post\r\nnorthwest of Cincinnati. Almost simultaneously, Air Defense Command\r\nradar picked up a target in that area. A minute or two later the\r\nForestville and Loveland GOC posts, also in Hamilton County, made\r\nsightings. Now, three UFO's, described as brilliant white spheres,\r\nswinging in a pendulum-like motion, were on the ADC plotting boards-\r\nconfirmed by radar. All pretext of ignoring the UFO's was dropped and\r\nat 11:58P.M., F-84's of the Ohio Air National Guard were scrambled.\r\nThey were over Cincinnati at 12:10A.M. and made contact. Boring in at\r\n20,000 feet, at 100% power, they closed but the UFO's left them as if\r\nthey were standing still.\r\n\r\nThe battle in the Cincinnati sector was on.\r\n\r\nAlmost every night more UFO's were reported by the GOC. Attempts\r\nwere made to scramble interceptors but there were no more radar\r\ncontacts and a jet interceptor without ground guidance is worthless.\r\n\r\nAt the height of this activity it was decided that more information\r\nwas needed by the Air Defense Command. Maybe from a mass of data\r\nsomething, some kind of clue, could be sifted out. The answer:\r\nestablish a special UFO reporting post. The man to operate this post\r\nwas tailor-made.\r\n\r\nOn September 9, Major Hugh McKenzie of the Columbus Filter Center\r\ncontacted Leonard H. Stringfield in Cincinnati. Stringfield, besides\r\nbeing a very public minded citizen, was also known as a level-headed\r\n\"saucer expert.\" Sooner or later, usually sooner, he heard about\r\nevery UFO sighting in Hamilton County. He was given a code, \"Foxtrot\r\nKilo 3-0 Blue,\" which provided him with an open telephone line to the\r\nADC Filter Center in Columbus. He was in business but he didn't have\r\nto build up a clientele--it was there.\r\n\r\nFor the next few months Stringfield did yeoman duty as Cincinnati's\r\none-man UFO center by sifting out the wheat from the chaff and\r\npassing the wheat on to the Air Force. As he told me the other day,\r\nhalf his nights were spent in his backyard clad in shorts and\r\nbinoculars. Fortunately his neighbors were broad-minded and the UFO's\r\npicked relatively warm nights to appear.\r\n\r\nMost of the reports Stringfield received were duds. He lost track of\r\nthe number. The green, red, blue, gold and white; discs, triangles,\r\nsquares and footballs which hovered, streaked, zigzagged and jerked,\r\nturned out to be Venus, Jupiter, Arcturus and an occasional jet. A\r\nfiery orange satellite which hovered for hours turned out to be the\r\nNorth Star viewed through a cheap telescope, and the \"whole formation\r\nof space ships\" were the Pleiades.\r\n\r\nThen it happened again.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 23rd Stringfield's telephone rang. It was\r\nCharles Deininger at the Mt. Healthy GOC post. They had a UFO in\r\nsight off to the east. Could Stringfield see it? He grabbed his\r\nextension phone and ran outdoors. There, off to the east, were two,\r\nlarge, low flying lights. One of the lights was a glowing green and\r\nthe other yellow. They were moving north.\r\n\r\n\"Airplane!\"\r\n\r\nThis was Stringfield's first reaction but during World War II he had\r\nmade the long trek up the Pacific with the famous Fifth Air Force and\r\nhe immediately realized that if it was an airplane it would have to\r\nbe very close because of the large distance between the lights. And,\r\nas a clincher, no sound came through the still night.\r\n\r\nHe dialed the long distance operator and said the magic words, \"This\r\nis Foxtrot Kilo Three Dash Zero Blue.\" Seconds later he was talking\r\nto the duty sergeant at the Columbus Filter Center. A few more\r\nseconds and the sergeant had his story.\r\n\r\nAnother jet was scrambled and this time Stringfield, via a\r\nradiotelephone hookup to the airplane, gave the pilot a vector.\r\nStringfield heard the jet closing in but since it was a one-way\r\ncircuit he couldn't hear the pilot's comments.\r\n\r\nOnce again the UFO took off.\r\n\r\nThis was a fitting climax for the Cincinnati flap. As suddenly as it\r\nbegan it quit and from the mass of data that was collected the Air\r\nForce got zero information.\r\n\r\nIn the mystery league the UFO's were still ahead.\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority of the UFO activity during the last half of\r\n1955 and early 1956 centered in the Cincinnati area there were other\r\ngood reports.\r\n\r\nNear Banning, California, on November 25, 1955, Gene Miller, manager\r\nof the Banning Municipal Airport and Dr. Leslie Ward, a physician,\r\nwere paced by a \"globe of white light which suddenly backed up in\r\nmidair,\" while in Miller's airplane. It was the same old story:\r\nMiller was an experienced pilot, a former Air Force instructor and\r\nair freight pilot with several thousand hours flying time.\r\n\r\nCommercial pilots came in for more than their share of the sightings\r\nin 1956.\r\n\r\nOn January 22, UFO investigators talked to the crew of a Pan\r\nAmerican airliner. That night, at 8:30P.M., the Houston to Miami DC-\r\n7B had been \"abeam\" of New Orleans, out over the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nThere was a partial moon shining through small wisps of high cirrus\r\nclouds but generally it was a clear night. The captain of the flight\r\nwas back in the cabin chatting with the passengers; the co-pilot and\r\nengineer were alone on the flight deck. The engineer had moved up\r\nfrom his control panel and was sitting beside the co-pilot.\r\n\r\nAt 8:30 it was time for a radio position report and the co-pilot,\r\nTom Tompkins, leaned down to set up a new frequency on the radio\r\ncontrols. Robert Mueller, the engineer, was on watch for other\r\naircraft. It was ten, maybe twenty seconds after Tompkins leaned down\r\nthat Mueller just barely perceived a pinpoint of moving light off to\r\nhis right. Even before his thought processes could tell him it might\r\nbe another airplane the light began to grow in size. Within a short\r\nsix seconds it streaked across the nose of the airliner, coming out\r\nof the Gulf and disappearing inland over Mississippi or Alabama.\r\nTompkins, the co-pilot, never saw it because Mueller was too\r\nastounded to even utter a sound.\r\n\r\nBut Mueller had a good look. The body of the object was shaped like\r\na bullet and gave off a \"pale, luminescent blue glow.\" The stubby\r\ntail, or exhaust, was marked by \"spurts of yellow flame or light.\"\r\n\r\nThe size? Mueller, like any experienced observer, had no idea since\r\nhe didn't know how far away it was. But, it was big!\r\n\r\nOne sentence, dangling at the bottom of the report was one I'd seen\r\nmany, many times before: \"Mr. Mueller _was_ a complete skeptic\r\nregarding UFO reports.\"\r\n\r\nDuring 1956 there was a rumor--I heard it many times--that the Air\r\nForce had entered into a grand conspiracy with the U.S. news media to\r\n\"stamp out the UFO.\" The common people of the world, the rumor had\r\nit, were not yet psychologically conditioned to learn that we had\r\nbeen visited by superior beings. By not ever mentioning the words\r\n\"unidentified flying object\" the public would forget and go on their\r\nmerry, stupid way. I heard this rumor so often, in fact, that I began\r\nto wonder myself. But a few dollars invested in Martinis for old\r\nbuddies in the Kittyhawk Room of the Biltmore Hotel in Dayton, or the\r\nMen's bar in the Statler Hotel in Washington, produces a lot of\r\nstraight and reliable information--much better than you get through\r\nofficial channels. There was no \"silence\" order I learned, only the\r\nsame old routine. If the files at ATIC were opened to the public it\r\nwould take a staff of a dozen people to handle all the inquiries.\r\n\r\nSecondly, many of the inquiries come from saucer screwballs and\r\nthese people are like a hypochondriac at the doctor's; nothing will\r\nmake them believe the diagnosis unless it is what they came in to\r\nhear. And there are plenty of saucer screwballs.\r\n\r\nOne officer summed it up neatly when he told me, \"It isn't the UFO's\r\nthat give us the trouble, it's the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a double check I called several newspaper editors the other day\r\nand asked, \"Why don't you print more UFO stories?\" The answers were\r\nsimple, it's the old \"dog bites man\" bit--ninety-nine per cent have\r\nno news value any more.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 1956, the man bit the dog.\r\n\r\nA string of UFO sightings in Pueblo, Colorado, hit the front pages\r\nof newspapers across the United States. Starting on the night of May\r\n5th, for six nights, the citizens of Pueblo, including the Ground\r\nObserver Corps, saw UFO's zip over their community. As usual there\r\nwere various descriptions but everyone agreed \"they'd never seen\r\nanything like it before.\"\r\n\r\nOn the sixth night, the Air Force sent in an investigator and he saw\r\nthem. Between the hours of 9:00P.M. and midnight he saw six groups of\r\ntriangular shaped objects that glowed \"with a dull fluorescence,\r\nfaint but bright enough to see.\" They passed from horizon to horizon\r\nin six seconds.\r\n\r\nThe next day this investigator was called back to Colorado Springs,\r\nhis base, and a fresh team was sent to Pueblo.\r\n\r\nThe man _really_ chomped down on the dog in July and the UFO\r\n_really_ made headlines.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was because a fellow newspaper editor was involved, along\r\nwith the Kansas Highway Patrol, the Navy and the Air Force. Or, maybe\r\nit was simply because it was a good UFO sighting.\r\n\r\nAbout the time Miss Iowa was being judged Miss USA in the 1956 Miss\r\nUniverse Pageant at Long Beach, the city editor of _Arkansas_ _City_\r\n_Daily_ _Traveler_, and a trooper of the Kansas State Highway Patrol\r\nwere sitting in a patrol cruiser in Arkansas City. It was a hot and\r\nmuggy night. Occasionally the radio in the cruiser would come to\r\nlife. An accident near Salina. A drunk driving south from Topeka.\r\nAnother accident near Wichita. But generally South Central Kansas was\r\ndead. The newspaper editor was about ready to go home--it was 10\r\no'clock--when the small talk he and the trooper had been making was\r\nbrought to an abrupt finale by three high pitched beeps from the\r\ncruiser's radio. An important \"all cars bulletin\" was coming. Twenty-\r\nfive years as a newspaperman had trained the editor to always be on\r\nthe alert for a story so he reached down and turned up the volume.\r\nWithin seconds he had his story.\r\n\r\n\"The Hutchinson Naval Air Station is picking up an unidentified\r\ntarget on their radar,\" the voice of the dispatcher said, with as\r\nmuch of an excited tone as a police dispatcher can have. \"Take a look.\"\r\n\r\nThen the dispatcher went on to say that the target was moving in a\r\nsemi-circular area that reached out from 50 to 75 miles east of\r\nHutchinson. A B-47 from McConnell AFB at Wichita was in the area,\r\nsearching. The last fix on the object showed it to be near Emporia,\r\nin Marion County.\r\n\r\nThe two men in the patrol cruiser looked at each other for a second\r\nor two. Like all newspaper editors, this man had had his bellyful of\r\nflying saucer reports--but this was a little different.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go out and look,\" he said, fully doubting that they would see\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nThey drove to a hill in the north part of the city where they could\r\nget a good view of the sky and parked. In a few minutes an Arkansas\r\nCity police car joined them.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear night except for a few wispy clouds scattered across\r\nthe north sky.\r\n\r\nThey waited, they looked and they saw.\r\n\r\nShortly before midnight, off to the north, appeared \"a brilliantly\r\nlighted, teardrop shaped, blob of light.\" \"Prongs, or streams of\r\nbright light, sprayed downward from the blob toward the earth.\" It\r\nwas big, about the size of a 200 watt light bulb.\r\n\r\nAs the group of men silently watched, the weird light continued to\r\ndrift and for many minutes it moved vertically and horizontally over\r\na wide area of the sky. Then it faded away.\r\n\r\nAs one of the men later told me, \"I was glad to see it go; I was\r\npooped.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning literally hundreds of people spent hours\r\nconjecturing and describing. After all these years of talk they'd\r\nactually seen one. Several photos, showing the big blob of light,\r\nwere shown around, and two fishermen readily admitted they'd packed\r\nup their poles and tackle boxes and headed home when they saw it.\r\n\r\nEditor Coyne summed up the feeling of hundreds of Kansans when he\r\nsaid: \"I have tended to discount the stories about flying objects,\r\nbut, brother, I am now a believer.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was it? First of all it was confusion. Early the next morning\r\nAir Force investigators flooded the area asking _the_ questions:\r\n\"What size was it in comparison to a key or a dime?\" \"Would it\r\ncompare in size to a light bulb?\" \"Was there any noise?\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as they left, the military tersely announced that no radar\r\nhad picked up any target and no B-47's had been sent out. Then they\r\npulled the plugs on the incoming phone lines. The confusion mounted\r\nwhen newsmen tapped their private sources and learned that a B-47\r\n_had_ been sent into the area.\r\n\r\nA few days later the Air Force told the Kansans what they'd seen:\r\nThe reflection from burning waste gas torches in a local oil field.\r\n\r\nThis was greeted with the Kansan version of the Bronx Cheer.\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred fifty-six was a big year for Project Blue Book.\r\nAccording to an old friend, Captain George Gregory, who was then\r\nChief of Blue Book, they received 778 reports. And through a lot of\r\nsleepless nights they were able to \"solve\" 97.8% of them. Only 17\r\nremained \"unknowns.\"\r\n\r\nDigging through the reports for 1956, outside of the ones already\r\nmentioned, there were few real good ones.\r\n\r\nIn Banning, California, Ground Observer Corps spotters watched a\r\n\"balloon-like object make three rectangular circuits around the\r\ntown.\" In Plymouth, New Hampshire, two GOC spotters reported \"a\r\nbright yellow object which left a trail, similar to a jet, moving\r\nslowly at a very high altitude.\" At Rosebury, Oregon, State Police\r\nreceived many reports of \"funny green and red lights\" moving slowly\r\naround a television transmitter tower. And in Hartford, Connecticut,\r\ntwo amateur astronomers, looking at Saturn through a 4-inch\r\ntelescope, were distracted by a bright light. Turning their telescope\r\non it they observed a \"large, whitish yellow light, shaped like a ten\r\ngallon hat.\" Many other people evidently saw the same UFO because the\r\nlocal newspaper said, \"reports have been pouring in.\"\r\n\r\nIn Miami, a Pan American Airlines radar operator tracked a UFO at\r\nspeeds up to 4000 miles an hour. Five of his skeptical fellow radar\r\noperators watched and were confirmed.\r\n\r\nAt Moneymore, Northern Ireland, a \"level-headed and God fearing\"\r\ncitizen and his wife captured an 18-inch saucer by putting a headlock\r\non it. They started to the local police station, but put the saucer\r\ndown to climb over a hedge, and it went whirling off to the\r\nhinterlands of space.\r\n\r\nThe 27th Air Defense Division that guards the vast aircraft and\r\nmissile centers of Southern California was alerted on the night of\r\nSeptember 9. In rapid succession, a Western Airlines pilot making an\r\napproach to Los Angeles International Airport, the Ground Observer\r\nCorps, and numerous Los Angeles citizens called in a white light\r\nmoving slowly across the Los Angeles basin. When the big defense\r\nradars on San Clemente Island picked up an unknown target in the same\r\narea that the light was being reported two F-89 jet interceptors were\r\nscrambled but saw nothing.\r\n\r\nA few days later investigators learned that a $27.65 weather balloon\r\nhad caused the many thousand dollars' worth of excitement.\r\n\r\nThe matter of scrambling interceptors has been a sore point with the\r\nUFO business for a long time. Many people believe that the mere fact\r\nthe Air Force will send up two, three, or even four aircraft that\r\ncost $2000 an hour to fly is proof positive that the Air Force\r\ndoesn't believe its own story that UFO's don't exist.\r\n\r\nThe official answer you'll get, if you ask the Air Force, is that\r\nthey scramble against _any_ unknown target as a matter of defense.\r\nBut over coffee you get a different answer. They write the UFO\r\nscrambles off as training cost. Each pilot has to get so much flying\r\ntime and simulating intercepts against an unidentified light is more\r\ninteresting than merely \"burning holes in the air.\"\r\n\r\nIf appropriations are ever cut to the point where training must be\r\ncurtailed, and Heaven forbid, there will be no more scrambles after\r\nflying saucers.\r\n\r\nAnd the colonel who told me this was emphatic.\r\n\r\nThe year 1957 was heralded in by a startling announcement which\r\nended a long dry spell of UFO news.\r\n\r\nAt a press conference in Washington, D.C., Retired Admiral Delmer S.\r\nFahrney made a statement. Newspapers across the country carried it\r\ncomplete, or in part, and people read the statement with interest\r\nbecause Admiral Fahrney is well known as a sensible and knowledgeable\r\nman. He had fought for and built up the Navy's guided missile program\r\nback in the days when people who talked of ballistic missiles and\r\nsatellites _had_ to fight for their beliefs.\r\n\r\nFirst, Admiral Fahrney announced that a non-profit organization, the\r\nNational Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) had\r\nbeen established to investigate UFO reports. He would be chairman of\r\nthe board of governors and his board would consist of such potent\r\nnames as:\r\n\r\nRetired Vice Admiral R. H. Hillenkoetter, for two years the director\r\nof the supersecret Central Intelligence Agency.\r\n\r\nRetired Lieutenant General P. A. del Valle, ex-commanding general of\r\nthe famous First Marine Division.\r\n\r\nRetired Rear Admiral Herbert B. Knowles, noted submariner of World\r\nWar II.\r\n\r\nThen Admiral Fahrney read a statement regarding the policies of\r\nNICAP. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Reliable reports indicate that there are objects coming into our\r\natmosphere at very high speeds . . . No agency in this country or\r\nRussia is able to duplicate at this time the speeds and accelerations\r\nwhich radars and observers indicate these flying objects are able to\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n\"There are signs that an intelligence directs these objects because\r\nof the way they fly. The way they change position in formations would\r\nindicate that their motion is directed. The Air Force is collecting\r\nfactual data on which to base an opinion, but time is required to\r\nsift and correlate the material.\r\n\r\n\"As long as such unidentified objects continue to navigate through\r\nthe earth's atmosphere, there is an urgent need to know the facts.\r\nMany observers have ceased to report their findings to the Air Force\r\nbecause of the seeming frustration--that is, all information going\r\nin, and none coming out. It is in this area that NICAP may find its\r\ngreatest mission.\r\n\r\n\"We are in a position to screen independently all UFO information\r\ncoming in from our filter groups.\r\n\r\n\"General Albert C. Wedemeyer will serve the Committee as Evaluations\r\nAdviser and complete analyses will be arranged through leading\r\nscientists. After careful evaluation, we shall release our findings\r\nto the public.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDonald Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps Major, and author of three top\r\nseller UFO books, was appointed director. The mere fact that another\r\ncivilian UFO investigative group was being born was neither news nor\r\nUFO history because since 1947 well over a hundred such organizations\r\nhad been formed. Many still exist; many flopped. But none deserve the\r\nniche in UFO history that does NICAP. NICAP had power and it raised a\r\nstorm that took months to calm down.\r\n\r\nNICAP got off to a fast start. Dues were pegged at $7.50 a year,\r\nwhich included a subscription to the very interesting magazine _The_\r\n_UFO_ _Investigator_, and the operation went into high gear.\r\n\r\nWith such names as Fahrney, Wedemeyer, Hillenkoetter, Del Valle and\r\nKnowles for prestige, and Keyhoe for intrigue, saucer fans all over\r\nthe United States packaged up their seven-fifty and mailed it to\r\nheadquarters. Each, in turn, became a \"listening post\" and an\r\n\"investigator.\"\r\n\r\nKeyhoe set up a Panel of Special Advisors, all saucer fans, to\r\n\"impartially evaluate\" the UFO reports ferreted out by the \"listening\r\nposts,\" based on facts uncovered by the \"investigators.\"\r\n\r\nEven though the \"leading scientists\" Fahrney mentioned in his\r\nstatement never materialized NICAP was cocked, primed, and ready.\r\n\r\nTo get things off to a gala start Keyhoe, as director of NICAP,\r\nwrote to the Air Force and set out NICAP's Eight Point Plan. In\r\nessence this plan suggested (some say demanded) that the Air Force\r\nlet NICAP ride herd on Project Blue Book.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, NICAP wanted its Panel of Special Advisors to review\r\nand concur with all of the conclusions on the thousands of UFO\r\nreports that the Air Force had in its files.\r\n\r\nThis went over like a worm in the punch bowl.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the Air Force didn't feel it was necessary to review\r\nits files. Secondly, they knew NICAP. If every balloon, planet,\r\nairplane, and bird that caused a UFO report hadn't been captured and\r\na signed confession wrung out, the UFO would be a visitor from outer\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force decided to ignore NICAP.\r\n\r\nBut NICAP wouldn't be ignored. They bombarded everyone from the\r\nSecretary of the Air Force on down with telephone calls, telegrams\r\nand letters.\r\n\r\nStill the Air Force remained silent.\r\n\r\nThen NICAP headquarters called in the troops and members from all\r\ncorners of the nation cut loose. The barrage of mail broke the log\r\njam and just enough information to constitute an answer dribbled out\r\nof the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.\r\n\r\nBut this didn't satisfy Keyhoe or his UFO hungry NICAPions. They\r\nwanted blood and that blood had to taste like spaceships or they\r\nwouldn't be happy. The cudgel they picked up next was powerful.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force had said that there was nothing classified about\r\nProject Blue Book yet NICAP hadn't seen every blessed scrap of paper\r\nin the Air Force UFO files. This was unwarranted censorship!\r\n\r\nWhile Congress was right in the middle of such important and crucial\r\nproblems as foreign policy, atomic disarmament, racketeering,\r\nintegration and a dozen and one other problems, NICAP began to\r\nbedevil every senator and representative who was polite enough to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\nIt's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease and in November 1957,\r\nthe United States Senate Committee on Government Operations began an\r\ninquiry concerning UFO's.\r\n\r\nI gave my testimony and so did others who had been associated with\r\nProject Blue Book.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later the inquiry was dropped.\r\n\r\nBut NICAP had made its name. Of all of the thorns that have been\r\npounded into the UFO side of the Air Force, NICAP drove theirs the\r\ndeepest.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this mess Admiral Fahrney, General Wedemeyer and\r\nGeneral del Valle, politely, and quietly, resigned from NICAP's board\r\nof governors.\r\n\r\nNeither the loss of these famous names nor the defeat at the hands\r\nof the Air Force has stopped NICAP. They continue to forge ahead,\r\nundaunted.\r\n\r\nIn many UFO incidents they have actually uncovered additional, and\r\nsometimes interesting, information.\r\n\r\nNICAP Director Don Keyhoe has taken a beating, being accused of\r\nprofiteering, trying to make headlines, and other minor social\r\ncrimes. But personally I doubt this. Keyhoe is simply convinced that\r\nUFO's are from outer space and he's a dedicated man.\r\n\r\nWhile the big NICAP-Air Force battle was going on the UFO's were not\r\nwaiting to see who won. They were still flying.\r\n\r\nAt Ellington AFB, Texas, a Ground Observer Corps team spotted a UFO\r\nand passed it on to a radar crew. Although the radar crew couldn't\r\npick it up on their sets they saw it visually. The lieutenant in\r\ncharge told investigators how it crossed from horizon to horizon in\r\n45 seconds.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, several passengers on a New York to San Juan, Porto Rico\r\nairliner were injured when the pilot pulled the big DC-6 up sharply\r\nto miss a \"large, greenish white, clearly circular-shaped object\"\r\nwhich was on a collision course with the plane. The pilots of several\r\nother airliners in the same airway confirmed the sighting.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later jet interceptors were scrambled over Los Angeles to\r\nlook for a UFO.\r\n\r\nAccording to the records, the first report of the brilliant and\r\nmysterious, flashing, red light came from a man in the east part of\r\nPasadena. But his report was quickly lost in the shuffle as more and\r\nmore calls began to come in. As the flashing light crossed the Los\r\nAngeles Basin from southeast to northwest hundreds of people saw it.\r\nTraffic was tied up on the Rose Parade famous Colorado Boulevard as\r\ndrivers stopped their cars to get out and look. As it neared the Air\r\nDefense Command Filter Center in Pasadena the filter center\r\npersonnel, those that could be spared, went out and looked. They saw\r\nit. Police switchboards lit up a solid red as it crossed the San\r\nGabriel Valley.\r\n\r\nNear midnight a CAA radar picked up unidentified targets near the\r\nOxnard AFB, at Oxnard, California (northwest of Los Angeles), and at\r\nalmost that identical time people on the airbase saw the light\r\n\r\nThis did it, and two powerful jets, equipped with all weather radar,\r\ncame screaming into the area.\r\n\r\nBut it was the same old story--no contact--the UFO was gone.\r\n\r\nThe midwest was visited on the morning of May 23rd, when five\r\nobservers in Kansas City saw four silver, disc-shaped objects flying\r\nin formation at extremely high speed. At one point during their\r\nflight two of the objects broke formation and veered off but soon\r\nrejoined. It took the objects only four minutes to cross the sky.\r\n\r\nThere were other reports during the first half of 1957, 250 of them\r\nto be exact, and many could be classified as \"good.\" But they were\r\nnothing compared to those that were to come.\r\n\r\nOn November 3, 1957, a rash of sightings broke out in Texas and they\r\nhad a brand new twist. To do things up right the powers that guide\r\nthe UFO picked the town of Levelland only 27 miles west of Lubbock,\r\nthe home of the now traditional \"Lubbock Lights.\"\r\n\r\nIt was with a tug of nostalgia that I read about these reports\r\nbecause five years before, almost to the day, Lubbock had plunged the\r\nAir Force, and me, into the UFO mystery on a grand scale.\r\n\r\nAccording to the best interpretation of the maze of conflicting\r\nstories, facts and rumors about these famous sightings the only\r\npositive fact is that there were scattered storm clouds across West\r\nTexas on the night of November 4, 1957. This was unusual for November\r\nand everyone in the community was just a little edgy.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the evening, at least early for West Texas on a\r\nSaturday night, when Pedro Saucedo, a farm worker, and his friend Joe\r\nSalaz, started out in Saucedo's truck toward Pettit, ten miles\r\nnorthwest of Level-land. They had just turned off State Highway 116\r\nand were heading north on a country road when the two men saw a flash\r\nof light in an adjacent field. Saucedo, a Korean War Veteran, and\r\nSalaz didn't pay much attention to the light at first. They only\r\nnoticed that it was coming closer. \"It seemed to be paralleling us\r\nand edging a little closer all the time,\" Saucedo later recalled.\r\nStill neither man paid any attention to the light. They drove on,\r\nSaucedo watching the road and Salaz talking.\r\n\r\nThen it hit.\r\n\r\nThe first signal of something wrong was when the truck's headlights\r\nwent out; then the engine stopped. Before Saucedo could hit the\r\nstarter again he glanced over his left shoulder. A huge ball of fire\r\nwas \"rapidly drifting\" toward the truck. Without a second's\r\nhesitation Saucedo did what the Korean War had taught him to do when\r\nin doubt, he shoved open the car door and hit the dirt.\r\n\r\nSalaz just sat.\r\n\r\n\"The 'Thing' passed directly over my truck with a great sound and\r\nrush of wind,\" Saucedo later told County Sheriff Weir Clem, after\r\nhe'd started his truck and had driven back to Levelland. \"It sounded\r\nlike thunder and my truck rocked from the blast. I felt a lot of heat.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Thing,\" which disappeared across the prairie, looked like a\r\n\"fiery tornado.\"\r\n\r\nFive years before and a little east of where Saucedo and Salaz were\r\n\"buzzed\" I had talked to two women who described almost an identical\r\nUFO. And it remains \"unknown\" to this day.\r\n\r\nIn Levelland, the two men's story would have been enough to keep\r\nSheriff Clem busy for the rest of the night but between the hours of\r\n8:15P.M. and midnight on the 2nd the \"Levelland Thing\" struck five\r\nmore times.\r\n\r\nJames D. Long, a Waco truck driver, came upon \"it\" four miles west\r\nof Levelland and fainted as it roared over his truck. Ronald Martin,\r\nanother truck driver, was stopped east of Levelland, as was Newell\r\nWright, a Texas Tech student. Jim Wheeler, Jose Alvarez and Frank\r\nWilliams added their stories to the melee.\r\n\r\nAll of those who had been attacked told Sheriff Clem a similar\r\nstory: \"The 'Thing' was shaped something like an egg standing on end.\r\nIt was fiery red, more like a red neon light. It was about 200 feet\r\nlong and was about 200 feet in the air. When it came close to cars\r\nthe engines would stop and the lights would go out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everyone,\" Sheriff Clem said, \"seemed very excited.\"\r\n\r\nThat night everyone in West Texas saw UFO's. Sheriff Clem saw a\r\nbrilliant light in the distance. Highway patrolmen Lee Hargrove and\r\nFloyd Cavin reported similar brilliant lights at the same time but\r\nfrom a different location. The control tower operators at the\r\nAmarillo Airport, to the north, saw a \"blue, gaseous object which\r\nmoved swiftly and left an amber trail.\"\r\n\r\nThere were dozens more. It was a memorable Saturday night in\r\nLevelland.\r\n\r\nBut unbeknown to Sheriff Clem or the residents of West Texas, they\r\nweren't alone on the visitor's list.\r\n\r\nAt 2:30A.M. on Sunday morning, only a few hours after the \"Thing\"\r\nraised havoc around Levelland, an army military police patrol was\r\ncruising the supersecret White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nHere is their report as they gave it to Air Force UFO investigators:\r\n\r\n\"At approximately 0230, 3 November 1957, Source, together with PFC\r\n------, were on a routine patrol of the up range area of the White\r\nSands Proving Ground when Source noticed a 'very bright' object high\r\nin the sky. This object slowly descended to an altitude estimated to\r\nbe approximately 50 yards where it remained motionless for about 3\r\nminutes, then it descended to the ground where the light went out.\r\nThe object was not blurred or fuzzy, emitted no vapor or smoke. The\r\nobject was in view for about 10 minutes, and Source estimated that it\r\nwas approximately 2 or 3 miles away. It was estimated to be between\r\n75 and 100 yards in diameter and shaped like an egg. Source stated\r\nthat it was as large as a grapefruit held at arm's length. The\r\nweather was cold, drizzling and windy, and Source stated no stars\r\nwere visible. After the light went out Source and PFC ------\r\ncontinued north to the STALLION SITE CAMP and reported the incident\r\nto the Sergeant of the Guard who returned to the area but failed to\r\nfind anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe flap was on.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 4th, the \"Levelland Thing\" struck again near the\r\nWhite Sands Proving Ground. James Stokes, a 20-year Navy veteran, and\r\nan electronics engineer, had the engine of his new Mercury stopped as\r\n\"a brilliant, egg-shaped\" object made a pass at the highway. As it\r\nwent over, Stokes said, \"it felt like the radiation of a giant sun\r\nlamp.\"\r\n\r\nStokes said there were ten other carloads of people stopped but if\r\nthis is true no one ever found out who they were.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force wrote off Stokes' story as, \"Hoax, presumably\r\nsuggested by the Levelland, Texas, reports.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe the Air Force didn't believe James Stokes but when the Coast\r\nGuard Cutter _Seabago_ radioed in their report from the Gulf of\r\nMexico wheels began to turn--fast.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday morning, the 5th, the _Seabago_ was about 200 miles south\r\nof the mouth of the Mississippi River on a northerly heading. At\r\n5:10A.M. her radar picked up a target off to the left at a distance\r\nof about 14 miles. This was really nothing unusual because they were\r\nunder heavily traveled air lanes.\r\n\r\nThe early morning watch is always rough and as the small group of\r\nofficers and men in the Combat Information Center quietly watched the\r\ntarget, with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm, it moved south, made a\r\nturn, and headed back to the north again. A few of the men noticed\r\nthat the turn looked \"a little different,\" but this early in the\r\nmorning they didn't give it much thought.\r\n\r\nAt 5:14 the target went off the scope to the north.\r\n\r\nAt 5:16 it was back and the lassitude was instantly gone. Now the\r\ntarget was 22 miles _south_ of the ship. No one in the CIC had to\r\ndraw a picture. Something, in two minutes, had disappeared off the\r\nscope to the north, made a big swing around the ship, out of radar\r\nrange, and had swung in from the south!\r\n\r\nWord went up to the lookouts. They tensed up and began to scan the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe radar contacts continued.\r\n\r\nThis second contact, south of the ship, was held for two full\r\nminutes as the target moved out from 22 to 55 miles. Then it faded.\r\n\r\nAt 5:20 the target was back but now it was _north_ of the ship\r\nagain, and it was hovering!\r\n\r\nAgain the lookouts were called. Could they see anything now? Their\r\n\"No\" answers didn't hold for long because seconds later their terse\r\nreports began to come into the CIC. A \"brilliant light, like a\r\nplanet\" was streaking across the northwest sky about 30 degrees above\r\nthe horizon. Unfortunately the radar had lost contact for a moment\r\nwhen the visual report came in.\r\n\r\nAt 5:37 the target disappeared from the scopes and was gone for good.\r\n\r\nThe _Seabago_ Case was ended but the UFO's continued to fly.\r\n\r\nReports continued to come into the Air Force and a lot of\r\ninvestigators lost a lot of sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next day at 3:50P.M. the C.O. of an Air Force weather detachment\r\nat Long Beach, California, and twelve airmen watched six saucer-\r\nshaped UFO's streak along _under_ the bases of a 7000 foot high cloud\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, also in Long Beach, officers and men at the Los\r\nAlamitos Naval Air Station saw UFO's almost continuously between the\r\nhours of 6:05 and 7:25P.M.\r\n\r\nLong Beach police reported \"well over a hundred calls\" during this\r\nsame period.\r\n\r\nDuring November and December of 1957 it was a situation of you name\r\nthe city and there was a UFO report from there. Trying to sift them\r\nout and put them in a book would be like sorting out a plateful of\r\nspaghetti. And if you succeeded you would have a document the size of\r\nthe New York City telephone directory.\r\n\r\nMost of the reports were explained.\r\n\r\nThe Levelland, Texas, sightings were written off as \"St. Elmo's\r\nFire.\" The military police at the White Sands Proving Ground saw the\r\nmoon through broken clouds and the crew of the Coast Guard ship\r\n_Seabago_ were actually tracking several separate aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe 1957 flap was as great as the previous record breaking 1952\r\nflap. During 1957 the Air Force received 1178 UFO reports. Of these,\r\nonly 20 were placed on the \"unknown\" list.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to 1957, the first months of 1958 were a doldrums.\r\nReports drifted in at a leisurely pace and the Air Force UFO\r\ninvestigating teams, blooded during the avalanche of 1957, picked off\r\nsolutions like knocking off clay pipes in a shooting gallery.\r\n\r\nIn Los Angeles, a few clear nights drove the Air Defense Command\r\nnuts. People could actually see the sky and the sight of so many\r\nstars frightened them.\r\n\r\nUnusual atmospherics in Georgia made stars jump and radars go crazy;\r\nand a balloon, hanging over Chicago at dusk, cost the taxpayers\r\nanother several thousand dollars but the pilots made their flight pay.\r\n\r\nA statement by Dr. Carl Jung, renowned Swiss psychologist, was\r\nwidely publicized in July 1958. Dr. Jung was quoted as saying, in a\r\nletter to a U.S. saucer club, \"UFO's are real.\" When Dr. Jung read\r\nwhat he was supposed to have written the Alps rang with screams of\r\n\"misquote.\"\r\n\r\nNo one got excited until the early morning of September 29th.\r\n\r\nShortly before dawn on that day a confusing mess of reports began to\r\npour into the Air Force. Some came from the Washington, D.C., area.\r\nPeople right in NICAP's backyard told of seeing a \"large, round,\r\nfiery object\" shoot across the sky from southeast to northwest. A few\r\nexcited observers, all from the country northwest of Washington, \"had\r\nseen it land\" and even as they telephoned in their reports they could\r\nsee it glowing behind a neighbor's barn.\r\n\r\nOther reports, also of a \"huge, round, fiery object,\" came in from\r\nsuch places as Pittsburgh, Somerset, and Bedford, all in\r\nPennsylvania; and Hagerstown and Frederick in Maryland. To add to the\r\nconfusion, people in Pennsylvania reported seeing three objects\r\n\"flying in formation.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the dust settled Air Force investigators took the first step in\r\nthe solution of any UFO report. They plotted the sightings on a map,\r\nand collated the directions of flight, descriptions and times of\r\nobservation. It was obvious that the object had moved along a line\r\nbetween Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh. It was traveling about 7000\r\nmiles an hour and everyone had obviously seen the same object. By the\r\ntime it had passed into Pennsylvania it had split into three objects.\r\n\r\nBut the hooker was the reported landings northeast of Washington.\r\nToo many people had reported a glow on the ground to write this\r\nfactor off even though an investigator, dispatched to the scene\r\nshortly after dawn, had found nothing in the way of evidence.\r\n\r\nOne possibility was that some unknown object had streaked across the\r\nsky, landed and then took off again.\r\n\r\nCould be, but it wasn't.\r\n\r\nThe next night the case broke. The glow from the landing was a\r\nbright floodlight on a barn. No one had ever really noticed it before\r\nuntil the object passed nearby.\r\n\r\nA few days later the object itself was identified. From the many\r\nidentical descriptions Project Blue Book's astrophysicist pinned it\r\ndown as a large meteor. The meteor had broken up near the end of its\r\nflight to produce the illusion of three objects flying in formation.\r\n\r\nOf all the 590 UFO reports the Air Force received in 1958, probably\r\nthe weirdest was solved before it was ever reported.\r\n\r\nAbout four o'clock on the afternoon of October 2, 1958, three men\r\nwere standing in a group, talking, outside a tungsten mill at Danby,\r\nCalifornia, right in the heart of the Mojave Desert The men had been\r\ntalking for about five minutes when one of them, who happened to be\r\nfacing the northwest, stopped right in the middle of a sentence and\r\npointed. The other two men looked and to their astonishment saw a\r\nbrilliant glow of light. It was so close to the horizon that it was\r\ndifficult to tell if it was on the horizon or in the air just above it.\r\n\r\nAt first the men ignored the light but as it persisted they became\r\nmore interested. They'd all heard \"flying saucer\" stories and, they\r\nlater admitted, this possibility entered their minds.\r\n\r\nAs they watched they speculated. It could be something natural but\r\nall of them had been around this area for months and they'd never\r\nseen this light before. About the time they decided to get a\r\ntelescope and take a closer look the light suddenly faded.\r\n\r\nAll the next day the men kept glancing off toward the northwest as\r\nthey worked but the clear blue sky was blank. Then, at 4:00P.M., the\r\nlight was back. This time they had a telescope.\r\n\r\nAll the men took turns looking at the object and all agreed that it\r\nwas about 15 feet long, 5 feet high and solid. It looked like the sun\r\nreflecting off shiny metal. It was about four miles away, they\r\nestimated, and almost exactly on the horizon.\r\n\r\nNow the men's curiosity was thoroughly whetted. Martian spaceship or\r\nwhatever, they were going after it. But a several-hour search of the\r\narea produced nothing. And, as soon as they left the mill they lost\r\nsight of the object.\r\n\r\nDarkness brought the search to a halt.\r\n\r\nThe next day at 4:00P.M. a crowd had gathered and the UFO kept its\r\nappointment. Again the men studied the object and tension ran high.\r\n\r\nSomeone had resurrected the stories of UFO's landing in the desert.\r\nAt the time they'd sounded absurd but now, standing there looking at\r\na UFO, it was different.\r\n\r\nA party of men were all ready to jeep out into the desert to make\r\nanother search when one of them made a discovery. There were guy\r\nwires coming out of the UFO and running down into the trees. Other\r\npeople looked. And then the solution hit like a fireball.\r\n\r\nExactly in line with the UFO, and ten miles away, not four, was a\r\nset of antennas for the California State Highway Patrol radio. The\r\nsun's rays were reflecting from these antennas. They'd never seen\r\nthis before because on only a few days during the year was the sun at\r\nexactly the right angle to produce the reflection.\r\n\r\nThe men were right. In a few days the Danby UFO left and it never\r\ncame back.\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred fifty-eight was not a record year for UFO's. The\r\n590 reports received didn't stack up to the 1178 for 1957, or the 778\r\nfor 1956, or the 918 for 1952. But a new record was set when the\r\npercentage of unknowns was pared down to a new low. During 1958 only\r\n9/10 of one per cent of the reports, or 5 reports, were classified as\r\n\"unknown.\"\r\n\r\nMore manpower, better techniques, and just plain old experience has\r\nallowed the Air Force to continually lower the percentage of\r\n\"unknowns\" from 20%, while I was in charge of Project Blue Book, to\r\nless than 1%, today.\r\n\r\nNo story of the UFO would be complete without describing one of\r\nthese unknowns, so here's one exactly as it came out of the Project\r\nBlue Book files:\r\n\r\n\"On 31 October 1958, this Center received a TWX reporting an UFO\r\nnear Lock Raven Dam. A request for a detailed investigation was sent\r\nto the nearest Air Force Base. The following is a summary of the\r\nincident and subsequent investigation:\r\n\r\n\"Two civilians were driving around near Lock Raven Dam on the\r\nevening of 26 October 1958. When they rounded a curve about 200 to\r\n300 yards from a bridge they saw what appeared to be a large, flat,\r\negg shaped object hovering about 100 to 150 feet above the bridge\r\nsuperstructure. They slowed their car and when they got to within 75\r\nor 80 feet of the bridge their engine quit and their lights went out.\r\nThe driver immediately stepped on the brakes and stopped the car.\r\nAttempts were made to start the car and when this was unsuccessful\r\nthey became frightened and got out of the car. They put the car\r\nbetween them and the object and watched for approximately 30 to 45\r\nseconds. The object then seemed to flash a brilliant white light and\r\nboth men felt heat on their faces. Then there was heard a loud noise\r\nand the object began rising vertically. The object became very bright\r\nwhile rising and its shape could not be seen as it rose. It\r\ndisappeared in five to ten seconds.\r\n\r\n\"After the object disappeared, the car was started and they turned\r\nit around and drove to where a phone was located and contacted the\r\nTowson Police Department. Two patrolmen were sent to meet them. The\r\ntwo men told the patrolmen of their experience. The witnesses then\r\nnoticed a burning sensation on their faces and became concerned about\r\npossible radiation burns. They went to a Baltimore Hospital for an\r\nexamination. Both witnesses were advised by the doctor that they had\r\nno reason for concern.\r\n\r\n\"An extensive investigation was made concerning this incident.\r\nHowever, no valid conclusion could be made as to the possible nature\r\nof the sighting and it remains unidentified.\"\r\n\r\nSo ended 1958 and in its final tally of sightings for the year\r\nProject Blue Book added a new space age touch--earth satellites had\r\naccounted for eleven UFO reports.\r\n\r\nNineteen hundred fifty-nine came in with a good one. We used to call\r\nthese reports \"Ground-air-visual-radar\" sightings and they make\r\ninteresting reading.\r\n\r\nAt Duluth, Minnesota, in March, it's dark by five o'clock in the\r\nevening. It's cold. The temperature hovers around zero and it's so\r\nclear you have a feeling you can almost reach up and touch the stars.\r\n\r\nIt was this kind of a night on March 13, 1959, and as the officers\r\nand men of the Air Defense Command fighter squadron at the Duluth\r\nMunicipal Airport moved, they shuffled along slowly because the heavy\r\nparkas and arctic clothing they wore were heavy.\r\n\r\nThen came the UFO report and things speeded up.\r\n\r\nAt 5:20P.M., exactly, the operations officer noted the time, word\r\ncame in over the comm line that someone had sighted an unidentified\r\nflying object off to the north. Word flashed around the squadron and\r\nas people rushed out of buildings to look they were joined by those\r\nalready outside.\r\n\r\nAnd there it was: big, round and bright, and it was moving at high\r\nspeed. Some observers thought it was \"greenish,\" others \"reddish,\"\r\nbut it was something and it was there.\r\n\r\nThe bearing was 300 degrees from the base.\r\n\r\nIt was an awesome sight and it became even more awesome when a quick\r\ncall to an adjacent radar site brought back the word that they had\r\njust picked up a target on a bearing of 300 degrees from the air\r\nbase. They were tracking it and taking scope photos.\r\n\r\nIn the alert hangar, the two pilots standing the alert had been\r\nlistening to a running account of the sighting so when the scramble\r\nbell rang they took off for their airplanes like a couple of sprinters.\r\n\r\nAs the two big alert hangar doors swung up the whining screech of\r\nthe jet starters, followed by thunder of the engines, filled the\r\nairfield. The atmosphere around the Duluth Municipal Airport was\r\nclosely akin to Santa Anita the instant the starting gates open.\r\n\r\nI've been around when jet interceptors scramble and you can twang\r\nthe tension with your finger.\r\n\r\nAs the people on the ground watched they could first see the flame\r\nof the jet's afterburner disappear into the night. Then the jet's\r\nnavigation lights faded out on a bearing of 300 degrees.\r\n\r\nAt the radar site they still had the target and there were many\r\nexcited people watching the big pale, orange scopes as two little\r\nbright points of light began to close on a bigger blob of light.\r\n\r\nThen the pilots gave the \"Tally-ho\"--they were in visual contact.\r\n\r\nBut the \"Tally-ho\" had no more been given than the big blob of light\r\non the target began to pull away from the fighters and was soon off\r\nthe scope.\r\n\r\nThe pilots kept visual contact, though, and the radio provided the\r\ndetails of the chase to the now blind crew in the radar room.\r\n\r\nThe two jets bored north, with afterburner on, and the needles on\r\ntheir machmeters passed the \"1.0\" mark. But still the UFO was just as\r\nfar away as it had ever been.\r\n\r\nThe chase went on for a few minutes more before the pilots pulled\r\ntheir throttles back into the cruise position, turned, and came home.\r\n\r\nEven before they landed, the people at the airbase saw the big,\r\nround and bright UFO rapidly begin to fade and then it was gone.\r\n\r\nSo ended the glamour and the dog work began.\r\n\r\nEach man who had seen the UFO visually was carefully interrogated.\r\nWeather reports were collected. Radarscope photos were developed. The\r\ntwo pilots received special attention. The exact bearing of the UFO\r\nwas measured and 300 degrees magnetic was correct.\r\n\r\nThe bundle of data was packed up and sent to Project Blue Book. The\r\npanel of experts convened.\r\n\r\nFirst, the radarscope photos were examined.\r\n\r\n\"Those targets could be interference from other radars,\" said the\r\nradar expert, and he mentally ticked off a dozen and one other\r\nsimilar cases of known interference. The weather data, and locations\r\nand frequencies of other radars were checked out.\r\n\r\nBeyond doubt it was interference from another radar that caused the\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nNow, the visual sighting.\r\n\r\nBalloon? No, the fighters could have caught a balloon in seconds.\r\n\r\nAirplane? Same answer. These jets were the fastest things in the air.\r\n\r\nPlanet or star? Out came the almanacs and the puzzle went to the\r\nastrophysicist. Venus was on a bearing of 300 degrees from the Duluth\r\nMunicipal Airport at 5:20P.M. on March 23rd. _But_ Venus was just\r\nbelow the horizon at that time and the observers said the UFO was\r\n\"moving fast.\"\r\n\r\nOnce again the weather charts were studied. The atmospheric\r\nconditions were such that it was very possible that due to refraction\r\nVenus would have been visible just on the horizon. The fact that the\r\nUFO faded so fast would bear this out because the conditions for such\r\nrefraction are critical and a slight change in atmospheric conditions\r\ncould easily have caused the planet to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe speed--a common illusion. Further interrogation of the observers\r\nshowed it had never moved.\r\n\r\nSo, the history of the UFO is almost brought up to date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\r\n\r\nOff They Go into the Wild Blue Yonder\r\n\r\nAt 12:30P.M. on Thursday, November 20, 1952, history was made.\r\n\r\nAt least, so says George Adamski, lecturer on philosophy and student\r\nof technical matters and astronomy.\r\n\r\nAt 12:30P.M. on Thursday, November 20, 1952, George Adamski was the\r\nfirst man on earth to talk to a Venusian.\r\n\r\nAt least, so says George Adamski.\r\n\r\nI was chief of Project Blue Book at the time and the name \"Professor\r\nAdamski\"--he had a title then--wasn't new to me. He, or some of his\r\nfollowers had been showering the Air Force with photos of flying\r\nsaucers. Letters by the gross were coming in demanding recognition of\r\nthe great professor and an analysis of his photos.\r\n\r\nWe obliged and the photos were examined by the experts at Wright-\r\nPatterson Photo Reconnaissance Labs. The verdict came back: \"They\r\ncould be genuine, of course, but they also could have been easily\r\nfaked by a ten year old with a Brownie camera.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few weeks we forgot George Adamski. But then the press began\r\nto clamor at our gates. The news was leaking out of Southern\r\nCalifornia. George Adamski had talked to a Venusian! We held out for\r\na long time but the pressure mounted and I headed for California to\r\nfind out what it was all about.\r\n\r\nAs far as George Adamski was concerned I was just another thirsty\r\nsight-seer from the famous observatory on Mt. Palomar when I walked\r\ninto the little restaurant at the foot of this famous mountain one\r\nday in 1953.\r\n\r\nThe four stool restaurant, with a few tables, where Adamski worked\r\nas a handyman, was crowded when I arrived and he was circulating\r\naround serving beer and picking up empty bottles. There was no doubt\r\nas to who he was because his fame had spread. To the dozen almost\r\nreverently spoken queries, \"Are you Adamski?\" he modestly nodded his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nSmall questions about the flying saucer photos for sale from\r\nconvenient racks led to more questions and before long the good\r\n\"professor\" had taken a position in the middle of the room and was\r\noff and running.\r\n\r\nIn his slightly broken English he told how he was the son of poor,\r\nPolish immigrants with hardly any formal education.\r\n\r\nTo look at the man and to listen to his story you had an immediate\r\nurge to believe him. Maybe it was his appearance. He was dressed in\r\nwell worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the\r\nmost honest pair of eyes I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nOr maybe it was the way he told his story. He spoke softly and\r\nnaively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that \"most people\r\nthink I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.\"\r\n\r\nAdamski started his story by telling how he had spent many long and\r\ncold nights at his telescope \"at the request of the government\"\r\ntrying to photograph one of the flying saucers everyone had been\r\ntalking about. He'd been successful, as the full photograph racks on\r\nthe wall showed, and he thought the next step would be to actually\r\ntry to contact a saucer.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, Adamski didn't know exactly why, on November 19th\r\nhe'd decided to go out into the Mojave Desert. He'd called some\r\nfriends and told them to meet him there.\r\n\r\nBy noon the next day the party, which consisted of Adamski and six\r\nothers, had met and were eating lunch near the town of Desert Center\r\non the California-Arizona border.\r\n\r\nThey looked for saucers, but except for an occasional airplane, the\r\ncloudless blue sky was empty. They were about ready to give it up as\r\na bad day when another airplane came over. Again they looked up, but\r\nthis time, in addition to seeing the airplane, they saw a silvery,\r\ncigar-shaped \"flying saucer.\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason, again he didn't know why, the group of people moved\r\ndown the road where Adamski left them and took off into the desert\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nBy this time the \"space ship\" had disappeared and once again Adamski\r\nwas about to give up.\r\n\r\nThen, a flash of light caught his eye and a smaller saucer (he later\r\nlearned it was a \"scout ship\") came drifting down and landed about a\r\nhalf mile from him. He swung his camera into action and started to\r\ntake pictures. Unfortunately, the one picture Adamski had to show was\r\nso out of focus the scout ship looked like a desert rock.\r\n\r\nHe took a few more pictures, he told his audience, and had stopped\r\nto admire the little scout ship when he suddenly noticed a man\r\nstanding nearby.\r\n\r\nNow, even those in the crowded restaurant who had been smirking when\r\nhe started his story had put down their beers and were listening.\r\nThis is what they had come to hear.\r\n\r\nYou could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop.\r\n\r\nAdamski told what went through his mind when he first saw the man--\r\nmaybe a prospector. But he noticed the man's long, shoulder-length,\r\nsandy-colored hair, his dark skin, his Oriental features and his ski-\r\npant type trousers. He was puzzled.\r\n\r\nThen it came into his mind like a flash, he was looking at a person\r\nfrom some other world!\r\n\r\nThrough mental pictures, sign language, and a few words of English,\r\nAdamski found out the man was from Venus, he was friendly, and that\r\nthey (the Venusians) were worried about radiation from our atomic\r\nbombs.\r\n\r\nThey talked. George pointed to his camera but the man from Venus\r\npolitely refused to be photographed. Adamski pleaded to go into the\r\n\"ship\" to see how it operated but the Venusian refused this, too.\r\n\r\nThey talked some more--of spaceships and of solar systems--before\r\nAdamski walked with his new found friend to the saucer and saw the\r\nVenusian off into space.\r\n\r\nAt this point Adamski recalled how he had glanced up in the sky to\r\nsee the air full of military aircraft.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the rest of Adamski's party, who had supposedly\r\nseen the \"contact\" from a mile away, were excited. They rushed up to\r\nhim and it was then that they noticed the footprints.\r\n\r\nPlainly imprinted in the desert sand were curious markings made by\r\nridges on the soles of the Venusian's shoes.\r\n\r\nAt the urging of the crowd in the restaurant Adamski took an old\r\nshoe box out from under the counter. One of his party, that day, had\r\njust happened to have some plaster of paris and the shoe box\r\ncontained plaster casts of shoe prints with strange, hieroglyphic-\r\nlike symbols on the soles. No one in the restaurant asked how the\r\nweight of a mere man could make such sharp imprints in the dry,\r\ncoarse desert sand.\r\n\r\nNext he showed the sworn statements of the witnesses and the crowd\r\nmoved in around him for a better look.\r\n\r\nAs I left he was graciously filling people in on more details and\r\nthe cash register was merrily ringing up saucer picture sales.\r\n\r\nI didn't write the trip off as a complete loss, the weather in\r\nCalifornia was beautiful.\r\n\r\nAdamski held the UFO spotlight for some time.\r\n\r\nThe Venusians paid him another visit, this time at the restaurant,\r\nand he photographed their \"ship.\" This, whether by Venusian fate or\r\ndesign, increased the flow of traffic to the restaurant at the base\r\nof Mt. Palomar.\r\n\r\nIt also had its side effects.\r\n\r\nAn astronomer from the observatory that houses the world famous 200-\r\ninch telescope on top of Mt. Palomar told me: \"I hate to admit it but\r\nthe number of week end visitors has picked up here. People drive down\r\nto hear George and decide that since they're down here they might as\r\nwell come up and see our establishment.\"\r\n\r\nBut George Adamski didn't hold the front center of the stage for\r\nlong. In rapid succession others stepped forward and hesitantly\r\nadmitted that they too had been contacted.\r\n\r\nTruman Bethurum, a journeyman mechanic of Redondo Beach, California,\r\nwas next up.\r\n\r\nActually, he admitted, _he_ had been the first earthman to talk to a\r\nperson from another world. Back on the night of July 26, 1952, four\r\nmonths before Adamski, a group of eight or ten, short, olive-skinned\r\nmen with black wavy hair, had awakened him while he was asleep in a\r\ntruck in the desert near Mormon Flats, Nevada.\r\n\r\nThese little men, unlike Adamski's, spoke any language.\r\n\r\n\"You name it,\" they'd quipped to Bethurum, \"we speak it.\"\r\n\r\nIn a newspaper article that was voted \"Best Read of 1953,\" Bethurum\r\ntold how the little men he met had been more cooperative and had\r\nactually taken him into their saucer, a huge job 300 feet in diameter\r\nand 16 feet high.\r\n\r\nOnce inside, Bethurum had met the captain of the \"scow\"--a true\r\nleader of men. Aura Rhanes was her name and she was a Venus de Milo\r\nwith arms and warm blood. \"When she spoke her words rhymed.\" They\r\nchatted and Bethurum learned that he was on the \"Admiral's scow\" the\r\ncommand ship of Clarion's fleet of saucers.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Bethurum made eleven visits to Aura's scow. Each time\r\nthey'd sit and talk. Bethurum told her about the earth and she told\r\nof the idyllic, Shangri-La type planet of Clarion--a yet undiscovered\r\nplanet which is always opposite the moon.\r\n\r\nBut before too long, both Truman Bethurum and George Adamski had to\r\nmove over. Daniel Fry, an engineer, stepped in.\r\n\r\nAt a press conference to kick off the International Saucer\r\nConvention in Los Angeles, Fry told how he had not only contacted the\r\nspacemen _two_ _years_ _before_ Adamski and Bethurum, he had actually\r\n_ridden_ in a flying saucer.\r\n\r\nIt had all started on the night of July 4, 1950, when engineer Fry\r\nwas temporarily employed at White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt was a hot night, and with nothing else to do, Fry decided to take\r\na walk across the desert. He hadn't traveled far when he saw a bluish\r\nlight hovering over the mountains which rim this famous proving\r\nground. He paid no attention. He'd heard flying saucer stories before\r\nand just plain didn't believe them.\r\n\r\nBut as he watched, the light came closer and closer and closer,\r\nuntil a weird craft came silently to rest on the desert floor not\r\nseventy feet away.\r\n\r\nFor seconds, Fry, who had seen missile age developments at White\r\nSands that would have dumfounded most laymen, merely stood and stared.\r\n\r\nThe object, Fry told newsmen, was an \"ovate spheroid about thirty\r\nfeet at the equator.\" (Fry has a habit of drifting off into the\r\ntechnical). Its outside surface was a highly polished silver with a\r\nslight violet iridescent glow.\r\n\r\nAt first Fry wanted to run but his rigid technical training overrode\r\nhis common, natural urges. He decided to go over to the object and\r\nsee what made it tick.\r\n\r\nHe circled it several times and nothing broke the desert silence.\r\nThen he touched it.\r\n\r\n\"Better not touch that hull, pal, it's hot,\" boomed a voice in a\r\nHollywoodian tone.\r\n\r\nFry recoiled.\r\n\r\nThe voice softened and added, \"Take it easy, pal, you're among\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\nAfter politely reading off the spaceman, or whoever he was, for\r\nscaring him, pal Fry and the voice settled down for a friendly\r\nmoonlight chat. Fry learned that the voice was indeed that of a\r\nspaceman and they were down to pick up a new supply of air. After\r\nabout four years of earth air transfusions, according to the\r\nspaceman, they would become adapted to our atmosphere, and our\r\ngravity, and become \"immunized to your bi-otics.\" The craft, Fry was\r\ntold, was a \"cargo carrier,\" unmanned and built to zoom down and\r\nscoop up earth air.\r\n\r\nThe conversation went on, waxing technical at times, and ended with\r\nan invitation to look into the ship. Then the spaceman, possibly\r\ncarried away by all the interest Fry was showing, offered a ride.\r\n\r\nFry accepted and they antidemagnetized off for New York City. Thirty\r\nminutes later they were back at White Sands.\r\n\r\nOver New York City they came down from 35 to 20 miles and Fry could\r\nread the marquee of the Fulton Theater. \"The Seven Year Itch\" was\r\nplaying.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't told the Air Force about his ride before because he was\r\nafraid he'd lose his job. But, at the press conference, he did plug\r\nhis new book, _The_ _White_ _Sands_ _Incident_.\r\n\r\nBy this time Adamski had already published his book _Flying_\r\n_Saucers_ _Have_ _Landed_ and it looked as if Fry was going to cut\r\nhim out. But Fry took a lie detector test on a widely viewed West\r\nCoast television show and flunked it flat.\r\n\r\nHis stock dropped as fast as it had risen but the decline was\r\nsomewhat checked when a well known Southern California medium wrote\r\nto \"her old friend\" J. Edgar Hoover about the situation. Hoover, the\r\nstory goes, shot back an answer--lie detectors are no good.\r\n\r\nBut the damage had been done. The \"rigged\" lie detector test had\r\nunfortunately relegated Daniel Fry, \"engineer,\" \"missile expert,\"\r\n\"part owner of an engineering plant,\" and interplanetary hitchhiker\r\nto the bush league.\r\n\r\nWith Adamski and Bethurum on the stage and Fry peeking out of the\r\nwings all hell broke loose.\r\n\r\nOne could say that everyone tried to get into the act, but I'd\r\nrather think that each colony of space people tried to promote their\r\nown candidate.\r\n\r\nIn England, one Cedric Allingham met a Martian on the moors. In\r\nFrance, Germany, the United States, Portugal, Brazil, Spain--\r\neverywhere--people \"too uneducated to pull a hoax\" met green men,\r\ndark men, white men, big men with little heads, little men with big\r\nheads and men with pointed heads. They wore motorcycle belts, baggy\r\npants, diver suits, and were naked.\r\n\r\nOne lady proudly announced that a Venusian had tried to seduce her\r\nand within days another snorted in disgust. A Martian _had_ seduced\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThen Adamski took a hop through outer space and back.\r\n\r\nSaucers poured forth words of wisdom via radio, light beams and\r\nmental telepathy. All of these messages were duly recorded on tape\r\nand sales were hot at $4.50 per 10-minute tape.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone by any other lousy planet, the Venusians picked up\r\na young man from Los Angeles and actually took him to Venus. Not\r\nonce, but three times.\r\n\r\nHe packed in audiences by telling how he had been contacted one\r\nnight and asked by a \"strange man\" if he would go on an important\r\nmission. Afraid, but not one to shirk his patriotic duties, he met\r\nthe stranger at a prearranged spot and was whisked off to Venus.\r\nDuring a high level conference up there he was given the word: Tell\r\nthe earthlings to lay off their atomic weapons, or else. They're\r\nkilling all our doves and we make our flying saucers out of the\r\nfeathers our live doves shed.\r\n\r\nThe Venusians, this space traveler warned his audiences, were\r\nalready infiltrating the earth and he intimated that they were ready\r\nto move in case we didn't cease atomic testing.\r\n\r\nHis next two trips to Venus were purely social.\r\n\r\nThe highlight of his lecture, when he awes his audience, is when he\r\nwhips out his proof: (1) a blood smear on a slide--genuine Venusian\r\nblood, (2) an affidavit from his landlady stating he wasn't home on\r\nthree occasions, and (3) a photo of a Venusian walking in Los\r\nAngeles' McArthur Park. The mere fact that the Venusian looks like\r\nany Joe Doakes walking down the street is a picayunish point.\r\nVenusians look just like us.\r\n\r\nAnd it hasn't stopped. During the big UFO flap of 1957 a man\r\nstumbled onto a landed saucer and chatted awhile with its occupants.\r\nA few months later, soon after the atomic powered _U.S.S._ _Nautilus_\r\nmade its historic trip under the polar ice cap, this same man snorted\r\nin disgust. He packed his suitcase and started on a lecture tour.\r\nMonths before _he'd_ been there in a flying saucer.\r\n\r\nOnce again people shelled out hard cash to hear his story.\r\n\r\nWherever you are, Mr. P. T. Barnum, you are undoubtedly grinning\r\nfrom ear to ear.\r\n\r\nBut there is a sober side to this apparently comical picture. The\r\ncommon undertone to many of these stories \"hot from the lips of a\r\nspaceman\" is Utopia. On these other worlds there is no illness,\r\nthey've learned how to cure all diseases. There are no wars, they've\r\nlearned how to live peaceably. There is no poverty, everyone has\r\neverything he wants. There is no old age, they've learned the secret\r\nof eternal life.\r\n\r\nToo many times this subtle pitch can be boiled down to, \"Step right\r\nup folks and put a donation in the pot. I'm just on the verge of\r\nlearning the spaceman's secrets and with a little money to carry out\r\nmy work I'll give _you_ the secret.\"\r\n\r\nI've seen a man, crippled by arthritis, hobbling out into the desert\r\nin hopes that his \"friend who talks to the Martians\" could get them\r\nto cure him on their next trip. I've seen pensioners, who needed\r\nevery buck they had, shell out money to \"help buy radio equipment\" to\r\ncontact some planet to find out how they'd solved their economic\r\nproblems. I saw a little old lady in a many times mended dress put\r\ndown a ten dollar bill to help promote a \"peace campaign\" backed by\r\nthe Venusians. She'd lost two sons in the war but had four grandsons\r\nshe wanted to keep alive. A couple died and left $15,000 to a man to\r\nbuild a \"longevity machine\" so others could live. The Martians had\r\ngiven him the plans.\r\n\r\nA woman died of thirst and exposure in the Mojave Desert trying to\r\nreach the spot where a man told her he was going to \"make a contact.\"\r\n\r\nSome of it isn't comical.\r\n\r\nEven though the field is becoming crowded, through thick and thin,\r\nMartian and Venusian, the old Maestro, George Adamski, is still head\r\nand shoulders above the rest. The hamburger stand is boarded up and\r\nhe lives in a big ranch house. He vacations in Mexico and has his own\r\nclerical staff. His two books _Flying_ _Saucers_ _Have_ _Landed_ and\r\n_Inside_ _the_ _Space_ _Ships_ have sold something in the order of\r\n200,000 copies and have been translated into nearly every language\r\nexcept Russian. To date, he's had eleven visits from people from\r\nMars, Venus and Saturn. Evidently Truman Bethurum's Aura Rhanes put\r\nout the word about earthmen because two beautiful spacewomen have now\r\nentered Adamski's life: an \"incredibly lovely\" blonde named Kalna,\r\nand the equally beautiful Illmuth.\r\n\r\nOnly a few months ago, while on one of his numerous nationwide\r\nlecture tours, a saucer unexpectedly picked Adamski up in Kansas City\r\nand took him on a galactic cruise before depositing him at Ft.\r\nMadison, Iowa, where he had a lecture date. He \"wowed\" the packed\r\nauditorium with his \"proof\"--an unused Kansas City to Ft. Madison\r\ntrain ticket.\r\n\r\nLast week, in the Netherlands (Adamski's nationwide tours have\r\nexpanded to world-wide tours), he repeated his exploits to Queen\r\nJuliana.\r\n\r\nBut at Buckingham Palace, Mr. Barnum, all he saw was the changing of\r\nthe guard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY\r\n\r\nDo They or Don't They?\r\n\r\nDuring the past four years the most frequent question I've been\r\nasked is: \"What do you personally think? Do unidentified flying\r\nobjects exist, or don't they?\"\r\n\r\nI'm positive they don't.\r\n\r\nI was very skeptical when I finished my tour of active duty with the\r\nAir Force and left Project Blue Book in 1953, but now I'm convinced.\r\n\r\nSince I left the Air Force the Age of the Satellite has arrived and\r\nwe're in it. Along with this new era came the long range radars, the\r\nsatellite tracking cameras, and the other instruments that would have\r\npicked up any type of \"spaceship\" coming into our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNone of this instrumentation has ever given any indication of any\r\ntype of unknown vehicle entering the earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nI checked this with the Department of Defense and I checked this\r\nthrough friends associated with tracking projects. In both cases the\r\nresults were completely negative.\r\n\r\nThere's not even a glimmer of hope for the UFO.\r\n\r\nThen there's Project MOONWATCH, the Optical Satellite Tracking\r\nProgram for the International Geophysical Year.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Allen Hynek, the director of MOONWATCH wrote to me: \"I can\r\nquite safely say that we have no record of ever having received from\r\nour MOONWATCH teams any reports of sightings of unidentified objects\r\nwhich had any characteristics different from those of an orbiting\r\nsatellite, a slow meteor, or of a suspected plane mistaken for a\r\nsatellite.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hynek should know. He has investigated and analyzed more UFO\r\nreports than any other scientist in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd the third convincing point is that twelve years have passed\r\nsince the first UFO report was made and still there is not one shred\r\nof material evidence of anything unknown and no photos of anything\r\nother than meaningless blobs of light.\r\n\r\nThe next question that always arises is: \"But people are seeing\r\nsomething. Experienced observers, like pilots, scientists and radar\r\noperators have reported UFO's.\"\r\n\r\nTo be very frank, we heard the words \"experienced observer\" so many\r\ntimes these words soon began to make us ill.\r\n\r\nEveryone, except housewives with myopia, were experienced observers.\r\n\r\nPilots, \"scientists\" (a term used equally as loosely), engineers,\r\nradar operators, everyone who reported a UFO was some kind of an\r\n\"experienced observer.\" This man had taught aircraft recognition\r\nduring World War II. He was an experienced observer. That man spent\r\nfour years in the Air Force. He was an experienced observer. We soon\r\nlearned that everyone is an experienced observer as long as what he\r\nsees is familiar to him. As soon as he sees something unfamiliar it's\r\na UFO.\r\n\r\nPilots probably come as close to falling into this category as\r\nanyone since they do spend a lot of time looking around the sky. But\r\neven those who can rattle off the names and locations of stars,\r\nplanets and constellations don't know about a few relatively rare\r\nastronomical phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe bolide, or super meteor, is a good example. Few pilots have\r\never, or will ever, see a deluxe model bolide but when they do\r\nthey'll never forget it. It's like someone shooting a flare in front\r\nof your face. There are a number of reports of bolides in the Blue\r\nBook files and each pilot who made each report called each bolide a\r\nUFO. The descriptions are almost identical to the classic\r\ndescriptions of bolides found in astronomy books.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of meteors, if most people realized that\r\nmeteors can have a flat trajectory, they can go from horizon to\r\nhorizon, they can travel in \"formation\" (groups), and they can be\r\nseen in daylight (as \"large silver discs\"), the work of UFO\r\ninvestigators would be lighter.\r\n\r\nEnough of meteors and back to our experienced observers.\r\n\r\nThe example of pilots and bolides holds true in many, many other\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nTake high flying jets for example. To a person in an area where\r\nthere isn't much high altitude air traffic, a thin, blood red streak\r\nin the sky at sunset, or shortly after, is a UFO. To anyone in an\r\narea where there are a lot of high flying jets even our myopic\r\nhousewife, it's just another vapor trail. They're as common as the\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nWhen the flashing red strobe lights, now used on practically all\r\naircraft, were still in the experimental stage back in 1951 they gave\r\nus fits. Every time an airplane with one of these flashing lights\r\nmade a flight people within miles, including other pilots, called in\r\nUFO reports. Now these strobe lights are common and no one even\r\nbothers to look up.\r\n\r\nThe same held true, and still does, for the odd array of lights used\r\non tanker planes during aerial refueling operations.\r\n\r\nSome phenomena are so rare and so little is known about them that\r\nthey are always UFO's. The most common is the disc following the\r\nairplane.\r\n\r\nI've never heard an explanation for this phenomenon but it exists\r\nand I've seen it on three occasions. Maybe a dense blob of air tears\r\noff the airplane, floats along behind, and reflects the sunlight.\r\nWhatever it is, it gives the illusion of a saucer \"chasing\" an\r\nairplane. Sometimes it's steady and sometimes it darts back and\r\nforth. It only stays in view a few seconds and when it disappears it\r\nfades and looks for all the world as if it's suddenly streaking away\r\ninto the distance.\r\n\r\nBirds, bees, bugs, airplanes, planets, stars, balloons, and a host\r\nof other common everyday objects become UFO's the instant they are\r\nviewed under other than normal situations.\r\n\r\nThen there is radar. This poor inanimate piece of electronic\r\nequipment has taken a beating when UFO proof is being offered. \"Radar\r\nis not subject to the frailties of the human mind,\" is the outcry of\r\nevery saucer fan, \"and radar has seen UFO's.\"\r\n\r\nRadar is no better than the radar observer and the radar observer\r\nhas a mind. And where there's a mind there is the same old trouble.\r\nIf the presentation on the radarscope doesn't look like it has looked\r\nfor years a UFO is being tracked.\r\n\r\nRadar is temperamental. The scope presentation of each radar has\r\ncertain peculiarities and an operator gets used to seeing these.\r\nOccasionally, and for some unknown reason, these peculiarities\r\nsuddenly change. For months a temperature inversion may cause 50 or\r\n75 targets to appear on the radarscope. The operator has learned to\r\nrecognize them and knows that they are caused by weather. They are\r\nnot UFO's. But overnight something changes and now this same\r\ntemperature inversion causes only one or two targets. The operator\r\nisn't used to seeing this and the targets are now UFO's.\r\n\r\nMany times we'd stumble across the fact that after the first report\r\nof a UFO being tracked on radar the same identical type of target\r\nwould be tracked again, many times. But by this time the operator\r\nwould have learned that they were caused by weather and it wouldn't\r\nbe reported to us.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that, to my knowledge, there has never\r\nbeen a radar sighting classed as \"unknown\" when radarscope photos\r\nwere taken. The reason is simple. The radar operator can take ample\r\ntime to re-examine what he had to interpret in seconds during the\r\nactual sighting. Also, more experienced radar operators have a chance\r\nto examine the scope presentation.\r\n\r\nMixed in with the fact that there are few really qualified observers\r\non this earth is the power of suggestion. About the time someone\r\nyells \"UFO!\" and points, all powers of reasoning come to a screeching\r\nhalt.\r\n\r\nWe saw this happen day after day.\r\n\r\nFew people I ever talked to, once they had decided they were looking\r\nat a UFO, stopped to calmly say to themselves, \"Now couldn't this be\r\na balloon, star, planet, or something else explainable?\"\r\n\r\nIn one instance I traveled halfway across the United States to\r\ninvestigate a report made by a high ranking man in the State\r\nDepartment. An experienced observer. It was evening by the time I got\r\nto talk to him and after he'd excitedly told me all the pertinent\r\nfacts, how this bright fight had \"jumped across the sky,\" he said,\r\n\"Want to see it? It's still there but it's not jumping now.\"\r\n\r\nWe went outside and there was Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThen, there was the UFO over Dayton, Ohio, in the summer of 1952.\r\n\r\nI first heard about it at home. It was about six in the evening when\r\nthe phone rang and it was one of the tower operators at Patterson\r\nField.\r\n\r\nThe tower operators at Lockbourne AFB in Columbus, Ohio, 60 miles\r\neast of Dayton, had spotted \"three fiery spheres flying in a V-\r\nformation\" over their base. Two F-84's had been scrambled to\r\nintercept and they were in the air right now. So far, the tower\r\noperator told me, the intercept had been unsuccessful because the\r\nobjects were traveling \"two to three thousand miles an hour\" and were\r\ntoo high for the old F-84's.\r\n\r\nHe was monitoring the two jets' radio conversation and he put his\r\ntelephone near the speaker.\r\n\r\nI heard:\r\n\r\n\"At 28,000 and still above us.\"\r\n\r\n\"High speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Headed toward Wright-Patterson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Low on fuel, going home.\"\r\n\r\nI made it to my car in record time and took off toward Wright-\r\nPatterson, about twelve miles from where I was living.\r\n\r\nIt was still light, although the sun was low, and as I drove I kept\r\nlooking toward the east. Nothing. I reached the gate, showed my pass\r\nto the guard, and had just written the whole thing off as another UFO\r\nreport when I saw them.\r\n\r\nThey convinced me.\r\n\r\nOff to the east of the airbase were three objects that can best be\r\ndescribed as three half-sized suns.\r\n\r\nBy the time I arrived at base operations there were three or four\r\ndozen people on the ramp, all looking up.\r\n\r\nThe standard comment was: \"Look at them go.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time a C-54 transport taxied up and stopped. It was the\r\n\"Kittyhawk Flight\" from Washington and I knew several people who got\r\noff.\r\n\r\nOne passenger, an officer from ATIC, ran up to me and handed me a\r\nroll of film.\r\n\r\n\"Here's some pictures of them,\" he said breathlessly. \"I never\r\nthought I'd see one.\"\r\n\r\nThe next passengers I recognized were two other officers, Ph.D.\r\npsychologists from the Aero Medical Laboratory. I knew them because\r\nthey had visited Blue Book many times collecting data for a paper\r\nthey were writing on UFO's.\r\n\r\nThe title of the paper was to be: _The_ _Psychological_ _Aspects_\r\n_of_ _UFO_ _Sightings_.\r\n\r\nAlmost climbing over each other in their effort to tell their story\r\nthey told me how they had watched the UFO's from the C-54. Both had\r\nseen them \"dogfighting\" between themselves.\r\n\r\n\"How fast were they going?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Like hell,\" was their only answer but the way they said it and the\r\nlooks on their faces emphasized their statement.\r\n\r\nThe crowd on the ramp had increased by now and some of the newcomers\r\nhad binoculars. The men with the binoculars were the focal point of\r\nseveral individual groups as they watched and gave blow-by-blow\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nSome of the crowd were talking about jet fighters and it suddenly\r\ndawned on me that just across the parking lot was the operations\r\noffice of the local ADC jet outfit, the 97th Fighter Interceptor\r\nSquadron.\r\n\r\nI ran over to interceptor operations and went in. I knew the duty\r\nofficer because several times before the 97th people had chased\r\nballoons over Dayton. When I told him about the UFO's all I received\r\nwas a rather uninterested stare. When I said they were over the base\r\nhe did me the courtesy of going out to look.\r\n\r\nHe came running back in and hit the scramble button. Three minutes\r\nlater two F-86's were headed UFOward. They soon disappeared but their\r\nvapor trails kept the tense crowd informed of their progress.\r\n\r\nAnd believe me there was tension.\r\n\r\nAs the vapor trails spiraled up, first as two distinct plumes, and\r\nlater only one--as they blended at altitude--more than one pilot\r\nstanding on the ramp expressed his thankfulness for his unenviable\r\nposition--on the ground watching.\r\n\r\nThe vapor trails thinned out and disappeared right under the three\r\nUFO's and it was obvious that the two jets had closed in.\r\n\r\nHere were three that didn't escape.\r\n\r\nThat night the 97th Fighter Interceptor Squadron added three more\r\nballoons to their record. The F-86's had been able to climb higher\r\nthan the F-84's.\r\n\r\nThe next morning photos confirmed the balloons. They had been\r\ntethered together and carried an instrument package.\r\n\r\nI had been fooled. Two Ph.D psychologists who had studied UFO's had\r\nbeen fooled. A C-54 load of \"experienced observers\" (many pilots) had\r\nbeen fooled. The tower operators had been fooled and so had a hundred\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThis was an interesting sighting and we used to discuss it a lot.\r\nAll of the observers later agreed that what made them so excited was\r\nthe tower operator's announcement: \"F-84's from Lockbourne are chasing\r\nthree high speed objects.\" This set the stage and from then on no one\r\neven considered the fact that if the objects had been traveling 2000\r\nor 3000 miles an hour they would have been long gone in the fifteen\r\nminutes we watched them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I found out that the C-54, a slow airplane, had actually\r\novertaken and passed the balloons between Columbus and Dayton but\r\nnone of the passengers I talked to had stopped to think of this.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm positive that in our minds the balloons, which were about 40\r\nfeet in diameter and at 40,000 feet, looked a lot larger than they\r\nactually were.\r\n\r\nI know the power of suggestion plays an important role in UFO\r\nsightings. Once you're convinced you're looking at a UFO you can see\r\na lot of things.\r\n\r\nBut then there's the \"unknowns.\"\r\n\r\nAny good saucer fan--wild eyed or sober--will magnanimously\r\nconcede that a certain percentage of the UFO sightings are the\r\nmisidentification of known objects. They drag out the \"unknowns\"\r\nas the \"proof.\"\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking, an \"unknown\" report is one that has been made\r\nby a reliable observer (not necessarily experienced). The report has\r\nbeen exhaustively investigated and analyzed and there is no logical\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nTo this, the Air Force says: \"The Air Force emphasizes the belief\r\nthat if more immediate detailed objective observational data could\r\nhave been obtained on the 'unknowns' these too could have been\r\nsatisfactorily explained.\"\r\n\r\nI think the Case of the Lubbock Lights is an excellent example of\r\nthis. It is probably one of the most thoroughly investigated reports\r\nin the UFO files and it contained the most precise observational data\r\nwe ever received. Scientists from far and near tried to solve it. It\r\nremained an \"unknown.\"\r\n\r\nThe men who made the original sightings stuck by the case and\r\nfurnished the \"more detailed objective observational data\" the Air\r\nForce speaks of.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious fights appeared again and instead of looking for\r\nsomething high in the air they looked for something low and found the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nThe world famous Lubbock Lights were night flying moths reflecting\r\nthe bluish-green light of a nearby row of mercury vapor street lights.\r\n\r\nI will go a step further than the Air Force, however, and quote from\r\na letter from ex-Lieutenant Andy Flues, once an investigator for\r\nProject Blue Book. Flues' statement sums up my beliefs and, I'm quite\r\nsure, the beliefs of everyone who has ever worked on Projects Sign,\r\nGrudge or Blue Book.\r\n\r\nFlues wrote: \"Even taking into consideration the highly qualified\r\nbackgrounds of some of the people who made sightings, there was not\r\none single case which, upon the closest analysis, could not be\r\nlogically explained in terms of some common object or phenomenon.\"\r\n\r\nThe only reason there are any \"unknowns\" in the UFO files is that an\r\neffort is made to be scientific in making evaluations. And being\r\nscientific doesn't allow for any educated assuming of missing data or\r\nthe passing of judgment on the character of the observer. However,\r\nthis is closely akin to being forced to follow the Marquis of\r\nQueensbury rules in a fight with a hood. The investigation of any UFO\r\nsighting is an inexact science at the very best. Any UFO\r\ninvestigator, after a few months of being steeped in UFO lore and\r\nallowed a few scientific rabbit punches, can make the best of the\r\n\"unknowns\" look like a piece of well-holed Swiss cheese.\r\n\r\nBut regardless of what I say, or what the Air Force says, or what\r\nanyone says, we are stuck with flying saucers. And as long as people\r\nreport unidentified objects in the air, it's the Air Force's\r\nresponsibility to explain them.\r\n\r\nProject Blue Book will live on.\r\n\r\nNo responsible scientist will argue with the fact that other solar\r\nsystems may be inhabited and that some day we may meet those people.\r\nBut it hasn't happened yet and until that day comes we're stuck with\r\nour Space Age Myth--the UFO.",
