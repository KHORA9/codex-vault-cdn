the event is in the hand of God._--WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of discerning Americans must by this time have been\r\nbrought to realize that something practical must shortly be done in this\r\ncountry by the believers in private property and private property rights\r\nto safeguard the nation from its threatened invasion by Bolshevism,\r\nSocialism and other various forms of anti-individualism, or else we are\r\nin for a hard and possibly a bloody struggle to maintain the very\r\nfundamentals of our social and political systems. From time to time in\r\nthis country as in every other there occur periods of extraordinary\r\ndanger to the political structure. In the past we have had several such\r\nepisodes, the most noted being that of the secession movement\r\nculminating in 1860 and 1861. The seriousness of the present menace of\r\ncommunism in its various forms is due not so much to the strength of the\r\ncommunist faction, considerable though it be, as to the weakness of our\r\ncivic structure consequent upon the long continued and increasing\r\ngeneral distrust and suspicion of our actual political agencies and the\r\nconfirmed popular dissatisfaction with their operations. Meantime,\r\nnothing adequately effective either in the way of strengthening our\r\ninstitutions or of disarming opposition thereto is being done or has\r\neven been proposed. A lot of vigorous denunciation has been directed\r\nagainst native and foreign Bolshevism, all thoroughly deserved and not\r\nwithout effect on the public mind, but falling far short of positive\r\nacts of defense or protection. Bolshevism is in the field not merely as\r\nan abstract doctrine, to be answered with words, but as an active and\r\naggressive force which must be met by measures of active resistance.\r\nSuch measures to be effective must take the shape of the creation of\r\npractical means and methods of offense and defense. The case is not one\r\nwhich admits of trifling; the attack is fundamental, the danger is\r\nvital, and cannot be effectually met by superficial expedients.\r\n\r\nNow there is happily one available measure of protection and defense\r\nagainst Bolshevism and all its assaults, one which is manifestly\r\nappropriate and will be absolutely efficacious. It is one which has long\r\nbeen highly desirable for other reasons hereinafter set forth, but which\r\nin view of the menace of radicalism is now imperatively demanded. It\r\nconsists in such a reform of the electorate itself as will make it\r\nimpassible and impervious to every influence subversive of our basic\r\ninstitutions. An electorate of male private property owners of\r\ntwenty-five years of age and upwards would constitute an absolute\r\nbarrier against all attacks on private property from any quarter; its\r\nestablishment would summarily and forever terminate all hopes of\r\nBolshevistic revolution in this country and ensure the American people\r\nfreedom to enjoy the noble future which Providence has made possible to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe cause of private property rights is in the truest sense the American\r\ncause and that to which all other national causes political and social\r\nare subordinate. Those rights involve almost everything which is dear to\r\nthe American heart. Even our governmental institutions are of secondary\r\nimportance, they are the instruments merely; the means whereby we seek\r\nto obtain among other aids and aims the protection of private property,\r\nthe absolute assurance to each American of the use and enjoyment of the\r\nfruits of his toil, of his self denial and of his foresight. This view\r\nis not novel in our politics. It was thoroughly familiar to our\r\nEighteenth Century statesmen, it was part of the political faith of\r\nsome of the most prominent among them, including a majority of the\r\npolitical leaders of the Revolutionary epoch. They endeavored to secure\r\nthese ends and to ensure the future of the new nation by requiring\r\nwherever possible a property qualification for voters. Had this practise\r\nand its underlying principle been adhered to and (with proper\r\nmodifications for changed conditions as they might occur) had the\r\ngovernment been continued on the basis on which the wise and prudent men\r\nof that time endeavored to establish it, it would at this moment\r\nrepresent a satisfactory approximation of a true and scientific\r\ndemocracy able to hold in safe derision its critics and enemies. But the\r\nprinciple of a properly qualified electorate, so vitally essential to an\r\nefficient democracy has been repudiated and abandoned; the practise of\r\nunlimited white suffrage has been general amongst us for about ninety\r\nyears, and today there can be no doubt that there is a prospect of\r\ndanger to our country, not because of lack of courage and loyalty in her\r\nsons, but because of the unhealthy organism of our body politic, whose\r\nmodern basic principle, unlimited suffrage, ignores property rights, and\r\nlooks to control by the representatives of the inefficient and the\r\nproletariat whenever they can secure a numerical majority at the polls,\r\nthus incidentally accomplishing what Bolshevism directly aims at.\r\n\r\nAnd now that private property rights heretofore considered as\r\nunquestionable are openly attacked, we must prepare for their defense,\r\nfor the defense of the family, of the American social system and the\r\nfree individual life, all three of which depend on private property for\r\ntheir existence. The time has come when the institution of private\r\nproperty must be formally recognized and defended as fundamental to our\r\nexistence as a nation, and such recognition requires and involves the\r\nallotment to that institution of a place and influence in our electoral\r\nsystem. Private property cannot safely rely for its defense upon\r\nofficials who are dependent upon the votes of the non-property holding\r\npopulace. There is no way of final avoidance of the issue, or even of\r\nlong postponing it. This nation must either declare itself definitely as\r\nadhering to the principle of private property rights or it must expect\r\ndisaster. And first, the cause of private property rights needs\r\norganization and self consciousness. Property holders cannot properly\r\ndefend a cause which has never declared itself and which has neither\r\nstandard nor leaders, while its enemies have both, and are not only\r\nproclaiming their convictions with courage, but have enacted them into\r\nliving statutes wherever they have power. If the institution of private\r\nproperty is to endure in this country it must be formally recognized as\r\nrepresenting a sacred cause, to be carefully committed into the hands of\r\nits friends; the electorate must be made over into a property qualified\r\nbody, and all temptation to Bolshevism must be removed from the American\r\npolitician. Let this be done, let the constitution of every State be\r\namended so that our voting mass shall be virile and substantial, and\r\nfreed from the element of effeminacy and inefficiency now so\r\ncontrolling; give the conservative good sense of the nation a rallying\r\npoint, an official standard, an authoritative creed, and it will\r\nspeedily make short work of the enemies of social order and of sound\r\npolitical institutions.\r\n\r\nBut there is a great deal more to be said in favor of a property\r\nqualification for voters than that it will be a wall against Bolshevism.\r\nIt will act on our political internal system as a tonic and a purifier.\r\nIt sometimes occurs in politics and statesmanship that two mischiefs are\r\nso bound together that they can be destroyed at one blow. Such was the\r\ncase in 1861-1865, when the causes of the perpetuation of the Federal\r\nUnion and the emancipation of the black race became by the logic of\r\nevents so involved as to be practically united, and when by the triumph\r\nof the northern armies the mischiefs of chattel slavery and disunion\r\npolitics were made to perish together. And in like manner we now find\r\nnot only that unqualified or manhood suffrage is the chief source of our\r\nweakness in dealing with Bolshevism, but that it has been in the past\r\nand still is the principal cause of our political corruption and\r\ngovernmental inefficiency. And therefore it has come about that the\r\ncause of private property and property rights is so bound up with the\r\ncause of administrative purity and efficiency in our government that by\r\nthe one measure of the establishment of a property qualification for\r\nvoters the perils of the menace of Bolshevism and the mischiefs of\r\npolitical corruption and inefficiency may be dispatched together.\r\n\r\nIt is in fact principally to the corruption and inefficiency of manhood\r\nsuffrage government that we owe the popular dissatisfaction out of which\r\nthe hopes of American Bolshevism are bred and nourished. The failure of\r\ndemocratic institutions in this country must be admitted and it is\r\nalmost entirely due to the operation of manhood suffrage. We have aimed\r\nat theoretical perfection, the natural conditions have been most\r\nfavorable; we have loudly called the world to witness the experiment,\r\nand the world has condemned it as a political failure. This statement\r\nwill hardly be challenged, but it is well supported by available proof,\r\nand need not rest merely on the assertion or opinion of the writer. And\r\nright here the reader may as well be informed that it is the author’s\r\nintention to support his material assertions with such evidence as the\r\nnature of the subject permits. Such readers as are tolerably familiar\r\nwith American political history will recognize the truth of most of the\r\nstatements of fact contained in these pages; but the reasonable doubts\r\nof the politically uninstructed will be removed as far as conveniently\r\npossible by reference to records and to the testimony of reliable\r\nwitnesses. Here therefore we quote on this branch of the subject from an\r\naddress of _Henry Jones Ford_, President of The American Political\r\nScience Association, delivered at the Annual Meeting at Cleveland,\r\nDecember 29, 1919.\r\n\r\n     “There was at one period an enthusiastic belief that in the\r\n     Constitution of the United States reflection and choice had at last\r\n     superseded accident and force, and that a model of free government\r\n     was now provided by which all countries and peoples might benefit.\r\n     The effect upon governmental arrangements was once very marked, but\r\n     complete examination of the documents shows that this influence\r\n     soon spent itself, and a decided change of disposition took place.\r\n     If, for instance, one shall attentively consider the constitutional\r\n     documents of all the Americas, one will observe, that although in\r\n     their early forms the Constitution of the United States was the\r\n     model, this is no longer the case. The Constitution of the French\r\n     republic now excels it in influence. The United States has lost its\r\n     lead, despite the fact that never has our country bulked larger in\r\n     the world than now. The present situation is indeed a striking\r\n     confirmation of Hamilton’s opinion that error in our republic\r\n     becomes the general misfortune of mankind, for it is a fact well\r\n     known to every student of politics that a belief that our system of\r\n     government is a failure on the essential point of justice is now a\r\n     potent influence on the side of social revolution throughout the\r\n     world....\r\n\r\n     Students of political science will generally agree that the three\r\n     greatest works of this class, all displaying wide knowledge and\r\n     deep thought, are De Tocqueville’s _Democracy in America_, first\r\n     published in 1885; Bryce’s _American Commonwealth_, 1888; and\r\n     Ostrogorski’s _Democracy and the Organization of Political\r\n     Parties_, 1902. These works form a crescendo of censure upon\r\n     American government, each re-examination of the subject confirming\r\n     previous disapproval and adding to it.”\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that the writers referred to by Ford and others\r\nhereinafter referred to fully sustain his statements above quoted. Our\r\ngovernment has not only been a failure on the essential point of justice\r\nas President Ford points out, but a still greater failure on the equally\r\nessential points of purity and efficiency. The democratic system in\r\nactual operation among us has been productive of corruption and\r\nmismanagement to such an extent as to cause and justify the almost\r\nuniversal verdict that popular misgovernment rather than popular\r\ngovernment has been the outcome. Hence general dissatisfaction and\r\nunrest; hence the danger of revolutionary movements, with which we are\r\nopenly threatened.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that governments reflect the character of the people.\r\nIf that were so in this country, as our people are conceded to be one\r\nof the most intelligent in the world, we would have one of its best\r\nworking governments; instead of which we have one of the most wasteful,\r\ncorrupt and inefficient. Our inferiority in this respect has been\r\nuniversally recognized both in this country and abroad for the last\r\nfifty years or more; it is a common-place of conversation; and has\r\ncaused numberless Americans to feel rage and indignation at home and to\r\nsuffer shame and humiliation abroad. It has been the subject of\r\ninnumerable books, pamphlets, sermons and lectures; it has inspired\r\ndenunciation, satire and invective in pulpit, and on platform; the press\r\nhas reeked with the disgusting details of the corruption, ignorance and\r\nincompetence of our office holders. Everywhere in the United States is\r\nto be found great popular dissatisfaction with the operations of our\r\ngovernment, profound distrust of its methods and spirit, and conviction\r\nthat there has been a failure to reach the standards and to realize the\r\nhopes of the Fathers of the Republic. This dissatisfaction and distrust,\r\nthis conviction of failure is not confined to any class; it pervades all\r\nclasses; it is widespread; it is to be heard freely expressed day by day\r\nand hour by hour alike in the business office and in the bar-room, in\r\nthe private dwelling and on the street; by the mechanic, banker,\r\ntradesman, laborer and lawyer. In short it is a matter of common\r\nknowledge that for about eighty years past the United States and each of\r\nthem has been in many important respects badly, corruptly and\r\ninefficiently governed. Read for instance this statement recently\r\npublished by an able American student and writer, and say whether it\r\ndoes not indicate a state of things fruitful with danger to the\r\nRepublic, in two principal ways; one, that of its decay by corruption,\r\nthe other by furnishing material for scandal and propaganda to its\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n     “The present situation has been described over and over again.\r\n     Briefly, it is constant encroachments by the legislature upon the\r\n     executive; legislation under irresponsible ‘bosses’ for personal\r\n     ends, blackmailing of corporations by politicians, and of society\r\n     by corporations to recoup the plunder of the politician, or to\r\n     accumulate ill-gotten gain, both of them very good imitations of\r\n     the Spanish policy in the colonies which is terminating in the ruin\r\n     of an empire; favours shown to special forms of business and\r\n     industry; unjust taxation; the irresponsible conduct of our\r\n     legislatures whose deliberations are the signal for alarm and\r\n     confusion in the commercial world; and mass-meetings every week to\r\n     frighten politicians into submission, libel, bribery, and lying in\r\n     campaign work, government by perjurers, pugilists and pimps, and\r\n     political leadership by men who know no arts but those of\r\n     Alcibiades and Catiline--all these and a hundred other facts like\r\n     them create a profound and justifiable suspicion of institutions\r\n     that confer the supreme power upon those who are equally unfit to\r\n     govern themselves and others.” _Democracy_, Hyslop, p. 294.\r\n\r\nNow, let us more carefully examine and consider the essential character\r\nof the political system which has produced these unsatisfactory results.\r\nIts basis is unlimited or unqualified suffrage, until recently appearing\r\nand manifested as “manhood suffrage,” but now, since the so-called\r\n“enfranchisement” of women more nearly fitting the name “universal\r\nsuffrage.” In any case in theory at least it is government by numbers,\r\nin contradistinction to government by intelligence, birth, wealth,\r\nexperience, talent or by any combination of these or other qualities or\r\nachievements. This doctrine of unlimited or unqualified suffrage is now\r\nand has long been recognized as an established principle of government\r\nin this country by most of us; indeed we may say by all Americans with\r\nthe exception of the natives or inhabitants of the Southern or former\r\nslave States. By these latter pure manhood suffrage has been tried and\r\ncondemned and has been replaced by white manhood suffrage by means of\r\ncertain well known and successful political devices amounting\r\npractically to a strict race qualification; though the important and\r\nsuggestive fact that thereby the basic principle of manhood suffrage was\r\nexpressly repudiated by the entire South has been carefully blinked by\r\nAmericans generally.\r\n\r\nIn a general way we may say then that manhood suffrage is everywhere in\r\nthe United States the legally recognized method of choosing all our\r\nlawmakers and many of our administrative officials; that white manhood\r\nsuffrage actually obtains in the Southern States; and that in the other\r\nStates constituting about three fourths of the whole, every resident\r\nmale citizen, native or naturalized, and in some of them residents not\r\nnaturalized, may vote. In sixteen of the forty-eight States the suffrage\r\nhas within recent years been extended to women. So that at present the\r\nbasis of government in the United States is manhood or male suffrage in\r\nall the States with the addition in some of them of female suffrage; or\r\nin other words, ignoring the negro situation, we have manhood suffrage\r\nin thirty-two and universal suffrage in sixteen States. In all of these\r\nStates elections are frequent, in most annual, in others biennial, in a\r\nfew quadrennial.\r\n\r\nThe controlling political importance of these elections is evident when\r\nwe consider that thereby are chosen all the members of both houses of\r\nthe various State Legislatures, of both houses of Congress, the\r\ngovernors of the states and the President and Vice-President of the\r\nUnited States, that is to say the entire body of lawmakers of the\r\ncountry. Also in many of the States are thus selected the Judges of the\r\nCourts higher and lower, and numerous administrative state officials,\r\nsuch as State Attorneys, Auditors, State Engineers, Financial Officers,\r\netc. Besides these there are elections of almost equal practical\r\nimportance of minor or local officers, such as Sheriffs, County\r\nAttorneys and Supervisors, Mayors and Aldermen of Cities, and\r\nmiscellaneous officials. Beyond all this, the electorate is required\r\nfrom time to time, and in some States at nearly every election, to pass\r\nupon constitutions, or amendments or provisions of constitutions, state\r\nand federal, referenda and propositions of various kinds involving\r\nsometimes vast expenditures. For none of these elections is any voting\r\nqualification practically required of the resident citizen, except that\r\nof color, and that only in the South.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting and curious to note how under our system of popular\r\nelections, government as legally constituted is merely a product of a\r\nprocess of aggregation of numbers. In practise, this numerical system is\r\nmodified by the low despotism of Boss rule, but in theory it rests on an\r\narithmetical count of heads, many of them cracked, others of various\r\ndegrees of emptiness, without taking note of merit, capacity or fitness.\r\nAnd right here in order to fully realize the force and sweep of the\r\nnumerical system of government we should remember that the effect of the\r\nvote of the electorate is not confined to the directly elective offices;\r\nit extends to the appointive offices as well; for the appointing power,\r\nwhether President, Governor, Senate or Legislature being chosen by\r\nelection, is under the necessity of selecting his or its appointees from\r\nthose of its supporters who control the most votes. It is not therefore\r\nsurprising that the politician whom the votes of the populace have made\r\nPresident or Governor sometimes appoints a knave or demagogue to public\r\noffice. Such appointment, however offensive to some of us, may have been\r\nin strict accordance with our political system. Under that system the\r\nultimate appeal is never to experience, ability, capacity or character,\r\nbut always to numbers; and therefore the official indebted to the power\r\nof numbers for his own high office may possibly be quite justified in\r\ncontinuing the process, and in bestowing his appointments on the\r\nrepresentative or controller of numbers, no matter what his quality or\r\ntheirs. To use the language of practical politics “the man with a\r\nfollowing is entitled to recognition” be he demagogue, rogue or humbug;\r\nand the President, Governor or Boss who fails to give it to him is false\r\nto the modern American principle of “numbers win”; in a word he is\r\nun-American; and is likely to suffer politically in consequence. In fact\r\nwe may say generally that government in this country is authorized by\r\nnumbers, rests on numbers, and is backed and sanctified by numbers and\r\nnaught else; while our governing class count numbers, live by numbers\r\nand need respect nothing but numbers if of numbers they can obtain\r\nsufficient support. The President is selected and appointed as the\r\nresult of a numerical reckoning; and so with all other officials and\r\nthe men who choose the officials; the laws are made either by men chosen\r\nby the addition of figures, or more directly by a similar count of\r\nvoters; nearly all of whom are absolutely ignorant of the merits and\r\nscope of the projected legislation and each of them lacking other\r\nqualification than that he exists and can be counted. The candidate with\r\nthe largest total gets the office; the project approved by the greatest\r\nnumber becomes law.\r\n\r\nOur government is not one of talent, nor cunning, nor of money, nor\r\nbirth, nor military force, but of numeral computation; our rulers are\r\nnot hereditary nor called to rule for their merits nor by the grace of\r\nGod; they are counted in; it is a government by calculation, an\r\narithmetical government. Our ruling classes are not aristocrats, nor\r\nmilitarists, nor statesmen, nor capitalists, nor landowners; they are\r\nhandshakers, mixers, they have “followings,” and their political weight\r\nin council does not depend on their wisdom, but on the numbers of the\r\nmob running at their heels. We are taught politically to think in\r\nnumbers, to believe in numbers; in fact, politically we believe in\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that the effect of this régime is to disregard much that\r\nstatesmanship should take into account in framing a nation’s polity.\r\nThere are many other considerations besides mere numbers which affect\r\nmen politically; other forces which far more than mere numbers operate\r\ntowards the development of mankind, the shaping of human destiny, the\r\nestablishment and fall of political institutions; all of which forces\r\nare by our political system completely ignored. In a free play of\r\npolitical life we would expect for instance to reckon with intellect,\r\ncapacity, energy, industry, wisdom, knowledge, judgment, prudence,\r\nphysical strength, wealth, experience, training, efficiency, and perhaps\r\nother qualities, but in our political scheme none of them is considered;\r\neverything is ascertained and decided upon and all doubts resolved by an\r\narithmetical process; you take a count and the thing is done. Be the\r\nquestion, for instance, who is the properest man to fill an\r\nadministrative office of trust and importance; on the one hand is A who\r\nhas a good physique, is of a fine family, habits good, long training and\r\nexperience, excellent education, bright past record for efficiency and\r\nhonor; and on the other B who has none of these valuable qualities, is a\r\nlittle shady in fact; but a glib platform speaker. The number of votes\r\nis counted and B has the more and is thus positively ascertained to be\r\nthe man for the place. Is not this wonderful? Tried by any other test he\r\nwould have been declared unfit for the position; but the numeral system\r\nconclusively demonstrated his fitness. And indeed the writer is\r\ncompelled to admit that the number system is deservedly popular with\r\nthose able to profit by it, and has given promotion to thousands of\r\nnonentities who would otherwise have remained in obscurity. So of a\r\nproject of law involving difficult questions of justice and expediency;\r\nstudents of civics and even great statesmen may be in doubt as to\r\nwhether it ought not to be amended or modified; but with our system in\r\noperation there is no need for study or hesitation; you just invite\r\nevery one to say “Yes” or “No.” Possibly the majority will not\r\nunderstand the project at all or will misunderstand it, but that makes\r\nno difference: understanding is not necessary to voting; it is numbers\r\nthat count, not understanding. Possibly a conscientious or indolent\r\nthird of the voters will decline to vote; that makes no difference\r\neither; possibly every one of the few who realty understand the\r\nproposition is opposed to it, but that is of little practical\r\nconsequence as the knowledge or ignorance of the voters is immaterial\r\nand is never made the subject of inquiry; possibly the scheme is\r\nimperfect and to the knowledge of the well informed plainly needs\r\namendment; it matters not, there is no provision for amendment of\r\ndetails in the numerical system; possibly the project has never been\r\nproperly presented to the electorate and most of the votes pro or con\r\nare the result of ignorance, whim or prejudice; but this fact will not\r\nbe considered in the result, for an ignorant or prejudiced vote is just\r\nas valid as a just and wise one. The system is unfailing; it will solve\r\nevery difficulty; the doubts of able statesmen are answered in a moment\r\nby the vote of the female mill hands of Factoryville. You are sure to\r\nget some decision, and any decision will serve; for no matter how\r\nfoolish or unreasonable it may be, no one is responsible; there is no\r\nappeal and practically no redress.\r\n\r\nThis electoral scheme would seem to imply a general belief in the\r\ncapacity of the electorate. It would at first blush appear to be founded\r\nupon a theory of the superior wisdom and almost superhuman knowledge and\r\nvirtue of the masses, whereby every voter is presumed to know who are\r\nbest fitted to fill the offices of Mayor, Alderman, Sheriff, County and\r\nState Attorney, Judge of Courts small or large, State Assemblyman, State\r\nSenator, Congressman, State Engineer and Surveyor, Governor of the\r\nState, and President of the United States; and it would seem, besides,\r\nthat every voter, male or female, is presumed to cast his or her vote\r\nwith the good of the community and nation at heart. The verdict so taken\r\nwould thus have something of the effect of an infallible decree; and\r\nindeed we note that people and newspapers often speak of the results of\r\nan election with a species of awe; and that in the somewhat too common\r\nevent of a doubtful character or even of a noted scamp being elected to\r\na public office the result is often spoken of as his “vindication.”\r\nThese “vindications” in fact are frequently needed and demanded by\r\npolitical gentlemen under a cloud, and have been accorded by the\r\nelectorate in a surprisingly large number of cases. Nor does the mere\r\ncapacity to select the best officials measure the full quota of the\r\nwisdom and accuracy apparently required by the populace under our\r\npolitical system. They, every man jack, and in the “advanced” States,\r\nevery woman jenny of them all is from time to time required to vote upon\r\nquestions which presuppose them to be perfectly familiar with the\r\nConstitution of the United States and of his and her own State; to\r\nunderstand all its provisions and to be able to determine the meaning\r\nand effect of any and all amendments thereto, which are or may possibly\r\nbe proposed.\r\n\r\nNow, all this is of course absurd; no such belief in the wisdom of the\r\nelectorate is entertained by the masses or by anybody, for no one in the\r\nworld is such a fool as not to be aware that at every election large\r\nnumbers of the voters are absolutely incapable of passing upon the\r\nmerits of candidates far above them in education, station in life, and\r\ncapacity to fill offices whose high duties they could not be made to\r\nunderstand by any amount of explanation. Few even of the most ignorant\r\nare unaware that only trained minds are capable of construing and\r\nunderstanding constitutional provisions and forecasting their probable\r\neffects. There must therefore exist within the manhood suffrage scheme,\r\nsome principle or theory more sane than a belief in the omniscience of\r\nthe rabble of ignorance, stupidity and indifference which it proudly\r\nmarshals to the polls; and though this principle or theory has never\r\nbeen precisely or authoritatively defined, yet on examining the numerous\r\nwritten or spoken expressions in support of universal suffrage found in\r\nbooks, speeches and newspaper articles, we discover that the postulate\r\nat the bottom of the manhood suffrage proposition is this: not that the\r\nmass of voters are competent judges of conditions or policies, but that\r\nthey are the natural, necessary and proper arbiters thereof; not that\r\nignorance, stupidity and vice do not go to the polls, but that in the\r\nnature of the case they are there and have a right to be there; that it\r\nis intended and expected that they shall be actually represented and\r\nexpressed in the vote; that in politics all have equal right to be\r\nheard; that government and law should be an expression of the will of\r\nall the people or at least of all of the men of this country; not merely\r\nof those having patriotism, experience, virtue, judgment, and wisdom, or\r\nany one of these qualities; but of the whole populace; including the\r\nignorant, stupid, worthless and depraved; and that each of these latter\r\nshould have an equal voice with the wise and worthy. Such is and must be\r\nthe underlying theory of manhood suffrage; and as women are notoriously\r\nstill more ignorant of political affairs than men, the adoption of\r\nwoman suffrage is evidently a mere extension of this same theory of\r\nequality of political value to the female sex; so that under a system of\r\nuniversal suffrage the law and the government include the expression of\r\nthe ignorance, stupidity and depravity of both sexes of the community,\r\nstate or nation as well as of its education, wisdom and goodness. And\r\nthis principle is in effect generally carried out at our elections; so\r\nthat practically the only disfranchised classes are those of the\r\npublicly supported paupers and the negroes in the South, and the whole\r\nimmense national mass of ignorance, incapacity and hostility to social\r\nwellbeing is included in our voting lists and finds expression at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nFrom an electorate so constituted, from a system of government founded\r\non such a perverse theory no good results are or ever were to be\r\nexpected. Accordingly, we are not surprised to note that the first plain\r\nsigns of a general political deterioration in American politics were\r\nabout coincident with the establishment of manhood suffrage in the early\r\npart of the nineteenth century. For the first forty years of the\r\nrepublic politics were comparatively pure; the United States was a model\r\namong nations; then we note a fatal declension, a swift lowering of\r\nstandards; we observe the close connection between the establishment of\r\nmanhood suffrage and the entrance into high places of low politicians;\r\nhow upon the widening of the franchise the management and control of\r\npolitics in the United States began gradually to pass from the hands of\r\nthe principal men of the country, the ablest, the most wealthy, the best\r\neducated, the most influential, the members of the oldest and best\r\nfamilies, and to fall under the control of the professional politicians.\r\nThis latter class originating at about that period developed into well\r\norganized bands who under the leadership of chiefs, since known as\r\nbosses, have seized, occupied and still hold and occupy the offices, the\r\nmachinery of public elections, appointments, and almost the entire\r\ncontrol of public affairs. Their management and control have been\r\nselfish, corrupt and inefficient. Their legislation has been excessive\r\nand poor in quality; their administration of governmental affairs\r\nignorant, weak, capricious, oppressive, wasteful, careless and\r\ndishonest. During all this time the system of manhood suffrage has\r\nremained unassailed and unquestioned, and the people have listened more\r\nor less complacently to fulsome praises of their government system by a\r\nvenal and superficial press and by ignorant and insincere political\r\nplatform orators. These, in their speeches and platforms have been\r\neasily able to escape imputation of the mischiefs of manhood suffrage\r\nand of their own class by charging them upon the opposite party, or upon\r\nsuch of their political opponents as happened for the time being to hold\r\npublic office. And so elections have come and gone, parties have risen\r\nand fallen, officials have been selected as popular one year and thrown\r\naside as unsatisfactory the next, but through it all corruption and\r\ninefficiency remain constant and acknowledged features of American\r\npolitical life.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when a remedy for this state of things can no longer\r\nbe safely postponed; the situation is serious; the democratic system is\r\nbeing attacked, and will continue to be attacked here and elsewhere by\r\ngreat numbers of the very class who have heretofore been supposed to\r\nconstitute its defenders and champions. Be they Bolsheviki, Anarchists,\r\nSocialists or what you will, these assailants of our institutions are\r\nnearly all of the common people, of the very working class whom it has\r\nbeen and ought to be the pride and mission of America to shelter and\r\nsatisfy. Many of them were brought to this attitude of revolt by evil\r\nconditions in Europe and are continuing here their hostile attitude to\r\norganized society and spreading the spirit of mischief among us because\r\nthey are justly disappointed by our political conditions; finding here\r\nin a country supposed to be democratic, the rule of a corrupt oligarchy\r\nof politicians thoroughly established and apparently acquiesced in by\r\nthe people at large. The seeds of discontent which they are assiduously\r\nsowing are likely to take root in the breasts of our own people,\r\ndisgruntled as they are with the past and present corruption of our\r\npolitics and the inefficiency of our government.\r\n\r\nThis corruption, this inefficiency, long a scandal among us, is the real\r\ncause of that popular “unrest,” that dissatisfaction the subject of so\r\nmuch comment, which for more than a generation just prior to the German\r\nwar had been steadily increasing in this country. It was started by the\r\ndegradation of politics which ensued immediately upon the establishment\r\nof manhood suffrage and the inauguration of Jackson and the Spoils\r\nPolicy in 1829. It was already well under way in 1840; but was\r\nsubsequently held in check by the Anti-Slavery agitation, by the Civil\r\nWar and the Southern Reconstruction troubles, which ended in 1876 with\r\nthe inauguration of Hayes. From that time this popular protest against\r\nour political unrighteousness has been steadily on the increase, gaining\r\nin power and bitterness with the added instances of official unfitness\r\nand maladministration of public affairs. With the disappearance of the\r\nolder generations reared in a religious belief in our republican\r\ninstitutions and filled with memories of the honest days before Jackson,\r\nappeared the spirit of contemptuous disbelief in official capacity and\r\nhonesty which has taken possession of their descendants. The vision of a\r\ngovernment administered by statesmen and patriots of the type of\r\nWashington and the Adamses has given place in the mind of America to a\r\npicture of a sordid gang of corrupt and incapable politicians in power,\r\nand it is therefore to the credit of our people that there has been\r\nprotest, dissatisfaction and “unrest.” The popular demand that this\r\nstate of things be remedied is at the bottom of the so-called “unrest,”\r\nand it is not an unreasonable demand. Never in the world’s history was\r\nthere a people so religious, so patriotic, so disinterested, so\r\nidealistic, so appreciative, so tolerant of mere mistakes, so easy to\r\ngovern justly as the American people; but the best of them are\r\ndetermined that their republican government shall be the ultimate\r\nsuccess their fathers promised to make it. They care much less about\r\n“world democracy”; they are far from being such consummate fools as to\r\nbelieve that our political system is fit for other and inferior races or\r\nto want to meddle with the affairs of other nations; but they want\r\nAmericanism to continue _here_; they want honest and efficient\r\ngovernment established in this country; and they fear the breakdown of\r\nthose republican institutions to which they feel a passionate devotion.\r\n\r\nThere have indeed been no lack of efforts at reform. All sorts of\r\nexpedients have been proposed and every remedy possible has been adopted\r\nand tried except the only one which could possibly be efficacious,\r\nnamely, the limitation and elevation of the electorate. This and the\r\nother new idea or so-called political reform has been tried and\r\ndiscarded, or proved of little value; hundreds of penal statutes have\r\nbeen enacted, hundreds of boards, commissions and officials of various\r\nsorts have been created; there have been innumerable grand jury inquests\r\nand committees of investigations; there have been created new ballot\r\nsystems, new primary laws; initiatives and referendums, besides\r\nthousands of tax-payers’ suits, injunctions, newspaper campaigns, new\r\nreform parties and fusions of old parties, not with the slightest hope\r\nof reaching perfection, but in desperate efforts on behalf of common\r\ndecency. All have failed. Countless political movements have been\r\nstarted and political campaigns fought in the effort to cure the\r\ndelinquency, to cleanse the corruption of our local and general\r\ngovernments, with varying temporary success, but without permanent\r\nbenefit. Men have spent their lives and fortunes in the effort; each new\r\ngeneration hopefully undertaking the task of cleaning the stable only to\r\nabandon it in its turn; and nothing permanent or even enduring has been\r\naccomplished. Here and there, an individual or a group of political\r\nmalefactors has been punished; here and there schemes for public plunder\r\nhave been exposed and defeated; the particular system or legislation\r\nwhich permitted these specific instances has been changed or reformed;\r\nthis or that particular abuse suppressed, and in the aggregate a great\r\ndeal of mischief has thus been done away with or prevented. But no one\r\npretends that the root of the evil has been removed or that the grasp\r\nof the professional politician class upon the throat of the nation has\r\nbeen loosened. The elections from which so much was expected, the men\r\nand movements from which so much was hoped, have come and gone without\r\nsubstantial results. The same class of politicians, the same methods,\r\nthe same political games, the same corruption, the same boss rule, the\r\nsame old rings, the same fraud, cheating, waste and general inefficiency\r\nremain the most striking features of our American public life. The same\r\nmen, though not always holding the same places, remain in office year\r\nafter year, and the rule of the oligarchy of professional politicians\r\nestablished eighty years ago goes on forever. When one of its members is\r\nturned out of one political job by a spurt of indignation of a gullible\r\nand innocent public, he quickly appears in another one just as\r\ncomfortable and lucrative, and sometimes with a capacity for mischief\r\nand blundering rather increased than diminished by the change.\r\n\r\nSeeing this, the reformers naturally ask each other in wonder and\r\ndisgust what is the matter with the people? What is the cause of their\r\nfailure to rid themselves of these political gangs? What is the remedy\r\nand where is it to be found? To ascertain the cause, to correctly\r\ndiagnose the disease is of course the first and the main problem.\r\nAfterwards the remedy. The fact that it persists and has so long\r\npersisted in operation affords evidence that it is not superficial but\r\nrepresents an organic defect in our governmental system. Many political\r\nstudents have puzzled over it, many have given the inquiry up as\r\nhopeless. In an article in the _Atlantic Monthly_ for July, 1896, the\r\nwriter, referring to our legislative bodies, notes\r\n\r\n     “a decline in the quality of the members in general respect, in\r\n     education, in social position, in morality, in public spirit, in\r\n     care and deliberation, and, I think, I must add in integrity also.”\r\n     He finds them subservient to the Boss rather than to public opinion\r\n     and adds, “To account for this or to say how it is to be mended,\r\n     is, I admit, very difficult. Few subjects have done more to baffle\r\n     reformers and investigators. It is the great puzzle of the\r\n     heartiest friends of Democracy.”\r\n\r\nAmong people generally there is a failure to agree upon any specific\r\ncause for the sad inferiority of our political condition. Some attribute\r\nit to human frailty; some to American carelessness or good nature; some\r\nto the spirit of the age, some to the inherent weakness of democracy. In\r\na very able and scholarly little book published as late as 1918 by Max\r\nFarrand of Yale University entitled _The Development of the United\r\nStates_, the writer, after referring to persistent and ineffectual\r\nattempts of reformers for the past generation to cleanse politics in\r\nthis country, makes this significant statement (p. 293): “It is\r\nsurprising that the people still retain faith in any remedies, but hope\r\nsprings eternal and every new plan was able to rally ardent supporters.\r\nTo the thoughtful observer, however, it was evident that the root of the\r\ntrouble had not been found and that something more radical or something\r\nentirely different was necessary.” I find no hint in Farrand’s book as\r\nto what this “something” might be. One may suspect that the worthy\r\nprofessor had tracked the bear to his den but did not care to start him;\r\nthat he preferred to avoid making his book the subject of controversy by\r\ngiving his opinion as to what is in fact “the root of the trouble.”\r\n\r\nHowever, he states the problem in a nutshell. All efforts to reform and\r\ncleanse our politics have failed, something new and different is needed,\r\nsome remedy that will reach the very source of the political corruption\r\nof our time and country. But after all, there need be very little\r\ndifficulty in finding the “root of the trouble”; it lies exposed, plain\r\nenough for all men to see and to stumble over as they pass to and fro.\r\nMany no doubt have identified it who prefer to be silent on the subject,\r\nthough a few prominent men have spoken out. President Woolsey of Yale,\r\nfor example, frankly says that “universal suffrage does not secure the\r\ngovernment of the wisest nor even secures the liberties of a country\r\nplaced in such a democratic situation, much less secures its order and\r\nstability.” (_Pol. Science._ Vol. I, Sec. 101). In Reemelin’s _American\r\nPolitics_ (1881) the author says in his chapter on the ballot box that\r\n“thickly strewn around us lie the evidences, that governing by the\r\nballot box, based on universal suffrage and universal qualification for\r\noffice is a failure; but why this is so, and what remedy we should apply\r\nis not so intelligible.” (P. 168.) In 1871 the _Westminster Review_, a\r\nBritish radical magazine, published an article on _The American\r\nRepublic, its Strength and Weakness_ in which the dangers of manhood\r\nsuffrage were plainly pointed out, and its institution attributed to the\r\nefforts of demagogues, and to a mistaken conception of suffrage as a\r\nright instead of as a privilege to be conferred upon those capable of\r\nexercising it. The writer sums up the topic by saying that:\r\n\r\n     “The elevation of the government, laws and institutions of a\r\n     republic must necessarily depend upon the average intelligence and\r\n     virtue of its voting population. Hence it is a most dangerous\r\n     experiment for America to reduce the qualifications of its voters\r\n     to the level of the lowest, instead of raising the latter to a\r\n     certain definite standard at which the right of suffrage might with\r\n     comparative safety be placed in their hands.”\r\n\r\nAnother writer thus expresses himself:\r\n\r\n     “It is perfectly idle to attempt to give political power to persons\r\n     who have no political capacity, who are not intellectual enough to\r\n     form opinions or who are not high minded enough to act on those\r\n     opinions.... Lastly the events of the earlier part of the last\r\n     century show us--demonstrate we may say, to us,--the necessity of\r\n     retaining a very great share of power in the hands of the wealthier\r\n     and more instructed classes, of the real rulers of public opinion.”\r\n     (Bagehot, _Parliamentary Reform_, p. 316.)\r\n\r\nAnd Lecky predicts that the day will come when the adoption of the\r\ntheory that the best way to improve the world and secure national\r\nprogress is to place the government under the control of the least\r\nenlightened classes will be regarded as one of the strangest facts in\r\nthe history of human folly.\r\n\r\nIndeed, but little political discernment is required to enable one to\r\nrealize the fatal mischiefs attendant upon the plan of according a place\r\nin the electorate to females generally and to the ignorant, idle,\r\nunthrifty, purchasable, vicious and anti-social males. It is not\r\ndifficult to see that such a scheme is erroneous in principle,\r\nantagonistic to civilization, and to society as the agent of\r\ncivilization. History informs us that manhood suffrage is contrary to\r\nour best traditions; that it has been mischievous and unclean in\r\npractise; that it has filled the body politic with the foulest\r\ncorruption; that it is largely responsible for the Civil War and other\r\nserious blunders and mischiefs; that it has cost thousands of millions\r\nto the American people in money stolen and squandered. Reason plainly\r\nteaches us that the suffrage is not a natural right, but a function in\r\nthe social system belonging only to those who by the process of natural\r\nselection are qualified as men of education and property to take a part\r\nin government; that unlimited universal or manhood suffrage is dangerous\r\nfor the future and if not overthrown may ultimately cause our national\r\ndestruction. There is not therefore after all any real difficulty in\r\ndetermining that universal suffrage is the political disease under which\r\nAmerica is suffering. Its specific cause is the virus of the rabble\r\nvote; men without character and destitute of achievement should be\r\nexcluded from the suffrage; they are by nature political nonentities,\r\nand were they content to mark zero on their ballots thus indicating the\r\nreal extent of their political value and sagacity they would be\r\nharmless; but they are too often the willing tools of scamps and\r\ndemagogues, and though individually zeros they attach themselves to real\r\nfigures to give them a fictitious and in this case a maleficent\r\ninfluence. Nor is the remedy far to seek, though so many political\r\nwriters have been rather shy in hinting it. It is possible by very\r\nsimple means, by a mere return to the original American principle and\r\nAmerican practice of a property qualification for voters to so reform\r\nour entire governmental system from the foundation upwards that it will\r\nbecome efficient and enduring and capable of defying all the political\r\nmadness of the times. The democratic theory would thus be retained, but\r\nit would be purified and strengthened by a return to the principles of\r\nthe fathers of the republic. We have failed because we have attempted in\r\ndefiance of those principles to create a democracy founded on numbers\r\nand on nothing but numbers. The resulting product has not been a true\r\ndemocracy; it has not properly represented and does not properly\r\nrepresent the American nation, which consists not merely of population\r\nbut of American intelligence and industry. The manhood suffrage\r\ndemocracy of numbers merely is too narrow; it does not afford a broad\r\nenough foundation for the national superstructure; and that foundation\r\nshould he widened to include the American character and American\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty in the case lies then not in ascertaining the source\r\nof American political ills, nor in prescribing the remedy; the\r\ndifficulty lies in obtaining leadership or even advocacy of a movement\r\nwhich to most men appears to promise little in the way of personal\r\nadvancement and much in the way of hostile criticism. As to the masses\r\nin private life, most are indifferent and the remainder voiceless. All\r\nthe organs of public opinion are muzzled, controlled or terrified into\r\nsilence by the politicians; and but few in public life whether newspaper\r\nmen, clergymen, judges, politicians, teachers or public servants or\r\nofficials; but few of those merely dependent upon or connected with\r\npolitics or government, whether bankers, lawyers, physicians in\r\nhospitals, officers of public utilities or the like, have heretofore\r\ndared more than whisper to their closest friends their real hatred of\r\nthe political despotism under which we are living today in the United\r\nStates. Now, however, the present menace of the political madness known\r\nas Bolshevism affords a new and compelling motive to every true American\r\nto arouse himself, and there is a hope that in the presence of a new\r\nperil, good citizens may be moved to realize the inherent weakness and\r\ndanger of our present political system, and to undertake the\r\nestablishment of a suffrage based upon such qualifications as will\r\ninsure the creation and continuance of a government in this country so\r\nstrong, determined, intelligent and devoted to the interests of\r\ncivilization that under it our whole political life may be purified and\r\nmade efficient; one which may be relied upon not merely to crush\r\nBolshevism in the United States but to extirpate it from this country\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to establish a property qualification for voters throughout\r\nthe United States may seem novel and even startling to many Americans,\r\nbut there is no other way out of the political mess in which we find\r\nourselves. As will be shown in detail in subsequent pages the corrupt\r\nrule of the low professional politicians of this country is made secure\r\nby the vote of the thriftless and controllable class; until that vote is\r\nexpurgated there can be no purification of the body politic; without\r\npurification there can be no efficiency; and unless the administration\r\nof our public affairs is purified and made efficient we cannot either\r\nanswer the charges of the enemies of our institutions or repel their\r\nattacks. We cannot depend upon the electorate as at present made up; it\r\nhas already shown its capacity to breed and encourage bad government;\r\nthe thriftless classes are all ready to accept Bolshevism or any other\r\neconomical and political absurdity; they are no more able to understand\r\nthe scheme of civilization and the value and importance of accumulations\r\nof earnings and creation of property in furtherance of that scheme than\r\nthey are able to understand a musical symphony or a problem in the\r\nhigher mathematics. And after all there is nothing sacred about the\r\ndoctrine of unlimited suffrage; it is only a political experiment like\r\nanother; and the well known record of its complete and dismal failure is\r\nsummarized in these pages where it is shown that it has not been an\r\ninstrument of progress nor a means of freedom, but that its tendency has\r\nbeen and is towards reaction and despotism; that it is anti-social and\r\nhostile to civilization. The proposal to make property accumulations the\r\nbasis of government, though it is sanctioned by ancient practise, is\r\nnot reactionary; it is progressive, as every return to old and sound\r\nprinciples is progressive. Nor will it create or tend to create a narrow\r\nor exclusive electorate; it will on the contrary have a broadening\r\neffect and will tend to furnish a truly popular government, one resting\r\ndirectly on the consent and the votes of most of the population, and\r\nutilizing qualities of virtue and manhood now denied their proper effect\r\nin politics. It will represent directly or indirectly every element of\r\nvalue in the nation; everything on which a democratic government depends\r\nfor its best support; namely, the industry, thrift, wealth,\r\nintelligence, character and honest independence of its people. The\r\nchange will appear in the overthrow of the rule of brute force and the\r\ncurbing of the present despotism of numbers. Do what we will, the\r\npassions and prejudices of the unthinking and uninstructed will always\r\naffect political action; but if our democracy is to survive their power\r\nmust be checked and modified by associating with the sway of numbers the\r\npowers of intelligence, of character, and of industry which working\r\ntogether constitute efficiency.\r\n\r\nEvery generation has its problems which it must solve at its peril. Ours\r\nis before us and must shortly be met if the signs tell true. Like Edipus\r\nwe must answer correctly or perish. And the question is, how to abolish\r\nthe weak and corrupt rule of the politicians and re-establish a pure,\r\nfirm, intelligent and truly republican government in the United States.\r\nThe true answer must be by the reform and elevation of the electorate.\r\nPurify the source and the stream will be pure and sweet.\r\n\r\nThis object is of such consequence that every American ought to be\r\nwilling to devote strong efforts to its accomplishment. And first, the\r\nintelligent and patriotic people of the country need to be aroused to a\r\nsense of its importance and instructed in the merits of the case. They\r\nmust be made not merely to know but to realize vividly the main features\r\nof the argument for a property qualification, which may be summarized\r\nin ten points, namely: (1) That this government was not originally\r\nfounded on the principle of universal suffrage but on that of a\r\npropertied electorate. (2) That the permanency of the corrupt and\r\ninefficient rule of the political oligarchy in the United States is due\r\nto the operation of universal suffrage. (3) That there is no natural\r\nright to vote; but that voting is a function of government to be\r\nexercised only for the benefit of society and never merely for that of\r\nthe individual. (4) That government in our day is a highly specialized\r\nbusiness institution requiring from its members expert knowledge rather\r\nthan oratorical gifts. (5) That good government in a democracy requires\r\na worthy and intelligent electorate. (6) That the franchise laws must\r\ndeal with classes, not with individuals. (7) That the franchise should\r\nbe confined to those who are socially qualified, as proven by lives of\r\nsuccessful social endeavor, resulting in the solid acquisition of\r\nsubstantial property. (8) That book or school education is insufficient\r\nto constitute by itself a franchise qualification. (9) That the body or\r\nmass of men are better fitted than that of women to exercise all\r\npolitical functions, voting included, and that therefore women should be\r\ndenied the suffrage. (10) That the elevation of the franchise is\r\nabsolutely necessary to purify our politics, strengthen our government\r\nand protect property and civilization from threatened anarchy.\r\n\r\nIt is with the hope of assisting in this work that this book has been\r\nwritten and published. It is not within its plan and scope to propose\r\nand discuss in minute detail the exact qualifications of voters and\r\nsuffrage restrictions under the proposed new system. The basic\r\nprinciples herein advocated once recognized, the detailed regulations\r\nfor their enforcement may properly be left to such state legislatures or\r\nconventions as may undertake to deal with the matter. They would\r\nobviously differ in different states and possibly in different\r\ncommunities. They should be such as would tend to insure a contribution\r\nby the voter of such a quota of intelligence, independence and good\r\njudgment in casting his vote as will greatly decrease bribery in\r\nelections; as will raise the standard of candidates for office, reduce\r\nthe influence of demagogues and “yellow” journals, elevate the tone of\r\npublic service, and incidentally encourage good citizenship by making\r\nthe voting power a badge of honor and manhood and a privilege to be\r\nsought after and valued. There is no place in this scheme for an\r\neducational qualification; such a requirement would be inconsistent with\r\nthe theory of this book which is that the school of business life is the\r\nappropriate preparation for the voting booth. The class of men of good\r\neducation who are unable to acquire a modest competence in this country\r\nare obviously so lacking in either interest in, or judgment of,\r\npractical affairs as to be unfit to pass upon those business questions\r\nwhich form the main part of the problems of government. The world of\r\nbooks on the one hand is a totally different realm from the world of\r\nbusiness and of politics on the other hand. Further, an educational\r\nqualification for voters is absolutely impracticable; it could not\r\npossibly be enforced. But this subject will be discussed more at length\r\nin the twenty-ninth chapter. Meanwhile let us briefly examine the\r\nhistory and operations of the voting system in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE OLDEST AND BEST AMERICAN TRADITIONS FAVOR A RESTRICTED SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of us have been accustomed to regard the principle of manhood\r\nsuffrage as a part of the original American ideal. The contrary is the\r\nfact. The doctrine that voters should be qualified for their duties is\r\nnot novel in America. It came to the country with its first settlers;\r\nthe colonists believed in it and retained it; it was part of the settled\r\npolicy of all the colonies for over one hundred and fifty progressive\r\nand flourishing years; under that policy they built up the country;\r\nraised the finest crop of statesmen and patriots it has ever produced;\r\nfought the war of Independence; wrote the Constitution; established the\r\nUnion and created the United States of America.\r\n\r\nThe species of a democracy which we now have, where capacity is\r\nunrecognized and unrepresented, and where the votes of men without\r\nstanding in the community may and do offset and defeat the votes of men\r\nof property, of business experience and sagacity was not the creation of\r\nthe Fathers of the American Republic and was not tolerated by them. In\r\nno sense is manhood suffrage or a democracy of numbers an integration of\r\ntheir spirit. They sought rather to establish a system of government by\r\ncapacity and intelligence, and desired that the measures thereby enacted\r\nfrom time to time should be the result not of an appeal to numerical\r\nsuperiority but of wise and careful discussion and deliberation by\r\nbodies containing the most capable and disinterested men in the\r\ncommunity. Most of them no doubt expected a property qualification for\r\nvoters materially to contribute to this result and they saw no\r\ninjustice or tyranny in demanding a qualification which any man might\r\nacquire by industry and thrift. It was not the men of 1776 who\r\nestablished the doctrine of manhood suffrage in the United States; and\r\nthough in some of the more sparsely settled or mountainous states, such\r\nas Vermont, Kentucky and New Hampshire, the population was so small and\r\nconditions were so primitive that suffrage qualifications seemed\r\nsuperfluous and were never adopted, yet the country as a whole,\r\nincluding the great states of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Virginia, stood for the principle\r\nof a properly qualified electorate long after American independence.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the period of a generation after the death of George\r\nWashington, when the most prominent of those who stood for pure\r\nconservative government were no more, and Washington, himself the\r\ngreatest single obstacle to political humbug in the country, was but a\r\nmemory, that the barriers were finally removed so that the army of\r\nprofessional politicians were enabled to get possession of every\r\ngovernment in the United States. Commencing with that time the political\r\ncontrol which the fathers had endeavored to place permanently in the\r\nhands of the best, most enlightened and most efficient was gradually\r\ntransferred to the hands of some of the worst, most ignorant and\r\nincompetent. This mischievous transfer was due mostly to the operation\r\nof manhood suffrage. It is by the admission to the electorate of the\r\npoorest quality of material that politics has been degraded to its\r\npresent low level; that it has become a business to be conducted for\r\nprofit; that professional politicians have obtained and retained power;\r\nthat the intelligence and manhood of the nation have been deprived of\r\ntheir rightful control over its destiny; and that the country has been\r\nhanded over to gangs of sordid rascals to be plundered. That it has been\r\nplundered cannot be denied. The plundering has been conducted so openly,\r\nscandalously and notoriously that there is hardly a reader of this book\r\nwho is not more or less familiar with some of the details, though its\r\nextent is so great that no one not a student of the subject can be\r\nfamiliar with it all.\r\n\r\nOne may naturally ask how comes it that the American people not only\r\nsubmit to such a vile despotism, but never seem seriously to question\r\nits right to exist. The answer is that the case is similar to that of\r\nthe recent German militarist domination; the country is in the clutches\r\nof a political oligarchy which controls a large organized body of those\r\nwho live by the operation of universal suffrage; the masses are taught\r\nto believe in it, and the most of those who are sufficiently instructed\r\nto fully understand its stupidity and villainy are silent in public\r\nbecause of fear, indifference or self-interest. The newspapers have not\r\ncloaked the rascalities of the politicians, except those of their own\r\nparty, because political sensations help to sustain their circulation;\r\nbut they have not undertaken to attack the political system which is\r\nresponsible for those rascalities; they have neither opposed manhood\r\nsuffrage nor exposed its sinister operations; they have never published\r\none-fourth of the available details of the rogueries and stupidities of\r\nour political masters, and indeed, why should they publish more? The\r\nactually published scandals are quite sufficient to condemn any system\r\nyet the public makes no sign of revolt. Ephraim is wedded to his idols;\r\nlet him alone. The newspapers cannot afford to attack popular abuses.\r\nThey depend for their circulation on the favor of the same populace\r\nwhich yearly goes like silly sheep to the polling place bleating its\r\npride at being driven there by its bosses, and their advertising in turn\r\ndepends on their circulation. No single newspaper can afford to\r\nantagonize at once the uninstructed populace and the powerful class of\r\npoliticians, office holders and political leaders who not only control a\r\nvery valuable advertising patronage but include among themselves nearly\r\nall the public speakers in the country and thus possess the ear of the\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nNor can private individuals, however wise and patriotic, be expected in\r\nthe present state of public opinion to assail a system so powerful and\r\nwell established. It is in fact generally assumed that manhood suffrage\r\nis a necessary part of the American policy, that its overthrow is\r\nhopeless; that to denounce it would be to court unpopularity; and in a\r\ncountry at once democratic and commercial, the number of those who dare\r\nto be unpopular is extremely few, and find it difficult to obtain even a\r\nhearing. And though in private conversation people frequently criticise\r\ngovernmental incapacity, and say that politics is rotten, and that\r\npoliticians and office holders are corrupt, they seldom or never go as\r\nfar as to question the principle of manhood suffrage, but seem to think\r\nthat political corruption and incapacity are necessary incidents of all\r\ngovernment, or at least of all democratic government.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the doctrine of manhood suffrage has never been\r\nestablished in the minds of the American people by argument or\r\ndiscussion; originally adopted without serious reflection, it has since\r\nbeen largely taken for granted. It is curious to see how the most\r\nimportant measures may be adopted in a democratic community without even\r\nan approach to thorough consideration on the part of the majority. Take\r\nthe case of woman suffrage adopted by the State of New York in 1917;\r\nonly a small proportion of the men of the State had ever seriously\r\nconsidered the subject, and of the several millions of women of the\r\nState, probably not more than ten thousand really concerned themselves\r\nabout it. National prohibition of the use of alcoholic beverages, which\r\nseemed impossible in 1908, was enacted in 1918 without real discussion\r\nby the electorate. The prohibition vote for President in 1916 was about\r\n200,000 out of 18,000,000, or a little more than one per cent. But the\r\nprohibitionists were in bitter earnest; the others were careless or\r\nindifferent, a moment favorable to prohibition came, and the thing was\r\ndone. Something like this is the story of the adoption of manhood\r\nsuffrage in New York and the other large States; while it was being\r\nadopted the majority scarcely realized what was going on; after it was\r\ndone they were indifferent to the change because it did not affect their\r\ndaily lives. Since its adoption its theory has been very little\r\ndiscussed by the American people; it has not been openly attacked or\r\nquestioned by newspaper or political orator for over two generations;\r\nits validity is usually taken as a matter of course; the masses are not\r\neven aware that there is anything questionable about it; and but one\r\nAmerican writer, Prof. Hyslop of New York, has had the vision to see its\r\nenormity and the courage and patriotism to describe it in print.\r\n(_Democracy._) His powerful book was never replied to and it is\r\nsignificant that not a well considered argument in favor of manhood or\r\nuniversal suffrage can be found in our libraries. Most of what has been\r\nprinted on the subject is mere twaddle; a few authors lacking practical\r\nexperience in active life, such as teachers or sociologists, have\r\nalluded to it in their class books or political treatises, but the\r\nlittle they say on the subject is usually confined to commonplace\r\nlaudation of political liberty or other weak sentimentalism or else to\r\nthe routine conventional assumption that manhood suffrage is what they\r\ncall in their pretentious slang part of the “advance movement” of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nA very short sketch of the history of manhood suffrage in this country\r\nmay be useful here as a preliminary to a brief review of its actual\r\noperations. Though some traces of a belief in the abstract right of all\r\nmen to vote may be found in the England of the middle ages, yet our\r\nEnglish ancestors prior to the Protestant Reformation had, generally\r\nspeaking, no idea of a vote not founded on property or on such a\r\nrecognized business standing as might give an assurance of stability of\r\ncharacter or of a substantial interest in the affairs of the community\r\nor nation. The first English public utterance in favor of manhood\r\nsuffrage that has come to the writer’s attention was made in 1647 by\r\nsome of the sect of Congregationalists or Independents. That body was\r\ndivided in opinion on the subject. Those who favored it were called\r\n“Levellers,” and in so doing were opposed by the other Independents as\r\nwell as by the Presbyterians, Catholics and Episcopalians. The Levellers\r\nclaimed that the right to vote was conferred by natural law upon all\r\nfreemen. Cromwell and Ireton of the Puritan leaders opposed them, and\r\ninsisted that no man had a right to vote on the affairs of the country\r\nor the choice of lawmakers who had not a property or a business\r\ninterest; saying that those who have “noe interest butt the interest of\r\nbreathing” should have no voice in elections.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of qualifications for voters in the American Colonies\r\nduring the Colonial period was left entirely in the hands of the\r\nColonies themselves; Great Britain not interfering. The first colonists\r\nwere without any settled policy on the subject. Massachusetts had a\r\nreligious qualification and some of the Puritans who wished to establish\r\na theocracy or a church government in New England on the basis of the\r\nIndependent or Congregational polity were in favor of making church\r\nmembership the only qualification. The first settlers being without\r\nholdings in the colony, probably dispensed with a property qualification\r\nat first or waived it as impracticable. But very soon it was decided\r\nthat only those having an interest in the colony should have a voice in\r\nits affairs; and the rule of a property qualification for voters was\r\nspeedily established in all the colonies; in Massachusetts, New\r\nHampshire and Connecticut in 1630; in Rhode Island in 1658; in New\r\nJersey in 1665 and North Carolina in 1663; in Maryland and in Virginia\r\nin 1670; in Pennsylvania in 1682; in South Carolina in 1692; in New York\r\nabout 1701; in Delaware 1734; and in Georgia in 1761. In five colonies,\r\nnamely, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania,\r\nthe property held might be either real or personal; in all the others it\r\nwas required to be land. Some American theorists at the time of the\r\nRevolution held a belief or a half belief in manhood suffrage but they\r\nwere few in number. In certain political declarations published not long\r\nprior to 1776 we find propositions that all men are naturally entitled\r\nto vote, while in others a suffrage qualification is suggested. But by\r\nthe time the Revolution arrived the doctrine of manhood suffrage had\r\npractically disappeared from the colonies; and the practice of putting\r\nin office only the most prominent and best equipped was universal and\r\napparently universally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Revolution in no way affected the suffrage. It had\r\nnot been a democratic movement nor intended as such. At first it was\r\ndesigned to merely curtail without actually terminating British\r\ninterference in American affairs; later as the estrangement increased it\r\nwas determined to entirely get rid of British rule. But the Revolution\r\nwas in spirit a conservative movement, whereby it was not intended to\r\ninterfere with existing colonial laws relating to suffrage nor to alter\r\nthe political or social structure of society nor to materially change\r\naught in government beyond terminating the British connection. In this\r\nrespect it materially differed from the French Revolution which\r\ndeveloped into an attempt to completely reorganize the social and\r\npolitical fabrics. The American revolutionists were well satisfied with\r\ntheir local laws and customs, and the separation from Great Britain once\r\naccomplished, the conservative policy adopted at the beginning of the\r\nstruggle still continued till the generation which had carried through\r\nthe Revolution had finally passed away.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence has nothing to say about the right of\r\nsuffrage. Although composed by Jefferson, who was influenced by the\r\nsentimentalities of the French theorists of the time it contains only\r\ntwo brief statements which can possibly be quoted as favoring the\r\nprinciple of manhood suffrage. One is “that all men are created equal.”\r\nThis statement could not have been intended to be understood without\r\nqualification because it is notoriously false. Men are not created equal\r\neither in size, health, affections, virtues, social station, capacity,\r\nprospects in life, opportunities, nor in anything else. In his own\r\ncountry thousands were then held in bondage, some by Jefferson himself,\r\nand a considerable part of the colonial population were without\r\npolitical rights. He could not therefore have even meant that all men\r\nwere entitled to be considered as politically equal unless he intended\r\nmerely to express a private opinion of his own. Public opinion as\r\nexpressed in the laws and customs of the time was exactly to the\r\ncontrary. The other statement of the Declaration that governments\r\n“derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,” is equally\r\nabsurd, if applied to individuals. It may be that a government is a\r\nusurper if it exists in defiance of society at large, but it may\r\nproperly dispense with the consent of an unlimited number of the\r\nindividuals whom it governs. It cannot be supposed that Jefferson and\r\nhis associates intended to imply that none of the governmental powers on\r\nthe earth including those of the colonies themselves were just; yet none\r\nof them derived their powers from the consent of all those under their\r\nauthority. Most of the colonies were founded on charters granted by the\r\nBritish crown. The consent of the native Indians, of aliens, women,\r\nminors, negroes and the unpropertied class had not been given to any\r\ngovernment in this country, nor was it proposed at that time that any\r\nsuch consent should be asked for. More than this, neither Jefferson nor\r\nany one else proposed that the consent of the minority at any election,\r\neven were it forty-nine per cent of the whole, should be required to\r\nestablish the new government. The most that Jefferson pretended to mean\r\nby these fine phrases was to claim that a majority of the qualified\r\nvoters of the colonies should govern the country through their\r\nrepresentatives duly elected. But in practice even this was a sham; the\r\nRevolutionists were probably in a minority of from one-fifth to a third\r\nof the whole people; they never troubled themselves to obtain the\r\nconsent of the Tories or the indifferent; and what Jefferson really\r\nintended was to get his faction together on the basis of that\r\nDeclaration as a party platform, to fight for the result and to beat or\r\nintimidate the majority into subjection or acquiescence. This is what\r\nwas actually done; both sides resorted to force, the neutrals were\r\nsilenced, and the Americans of tory principles were soon taught to their\r\nsorrow that Jefferson and his associates intended to govern them with or\r\nwithout their consent and pretty harshly at that. No vote was ever taken\r\non the question of separation from Great Britain, and the consent of\r\nthe objectors to what was done was rendered unnecessary by the efficient\r\nprocess of killing them or driving them into exile and confiscating\r\ntheir property.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution therefore was not the establishment of the rule of the\r\nmajority in numbers, but of the sway of those qualified to govern,\r\nbecause the strongest, the most daring and the most fortunate. And the\r\nproperty qualification principle also assuring the rule of those\r\nbelieved to be the best qualified to govern was in force in every one of\r\nthe thirteen states at and immediately after the Revolution by the will\r\nof the colonists themselves. Voters’ qualifications varied in different\r\nStates, but in all there was some kind of a property qualification. In\r\nsome the actual ownership of real property was required; in others a\r\nvoter was required either to pay a property tax, to lease real property\r\nor to have a substantial yearly income. The payment of direct taxes in\r\nsome form or other was in the minds of the founders of the American\r\nrepublic an essential qualification of the voter. The revolt against\r\nGreat Britain had been generally and publicly defended on the theory of\r\nno taxation without representation; and the converse of this principle\r\nwas popularly assumed, namely, that there should be no representation\r\nwithout taxation; in other words, that no man should be permitted to aid\r\nin shaping the policy of the country who did not directly contribute to\r\nthe expense of its government, or, in the language of the time, “who had\r\nnot a stake in the country.” For example, Virginia from 1670 restricted\r\nthe suffrage “to such as by their estates, real or personal, have\r\ninterest enough to tye them to the endeavor of the public good,” and\r\nlater excluded all but freeholders. In the Virginia Bill of Rights of\r\nJune 12, 1776, the statement is “That all men, having sufficient\r\nevidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to the\r\ncommunity have the right of suffrage.” In New Haven in 1784, out of\r\nabout 600 adult males, only 343 were qualified to be freemen and vote\r\nfor the mayor, who being once elected held his office during the\r\npleasure of the General Assembly which usually meant for life.\r\n(_Levermore, New Haven._) The payment of taxes and the right to\r\nrepresentation were so much united in the public mind at that time that\r\nin some states, for instance in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the\r\nnumber of senators was apportioned among the counties according to the\r\namount of taxation paid and not according to the population. Within the\r\nState of New York, representation was granted not according to the\r\nnumber of inhabitants, but to that of actual voters; in other words, of\r\npropertied citizens. When the word “people” was used in public documents\r\nwhat was really meant was the citizens or voters of the State.\r\n\r\nIn those days the obscure and ignorant political adventurers who now\r\nadorn our legislative halls, had no chance of getting themselves into\r\nthe seats of the mighty, or their ravenous fingers into the public\r\npurse. As for judicial and administrative officers their selection was\r\nentirely withdrawn from the electorate. Our colonial and revolutionary\r\nancestors believed that the members of the State Legislature who were\r\npersonally acquainted with the candidates for high office were better\r\nable to select them than the mass of voters who only knew them by sight\r\nor reputation. The electorate might only choose the legislature, and\r\nthat body usually elected the governor and appointed and removed judges,\r\njustices of the peace, sheriffs, and other administrative officers. The\r\nvoters chose the men who made the laws, but not the officials charged\r\nwith their interpretation and execution; and the actual administration\r\nof government was so arranged for that honest, competent and responsible\r\nagents might be employed therein and was as far removed from the people\r\nas was conveniently possible.\r\n\r\nTherefore the popular belief that the founders of our government\r\nbelieved in a democracy of numbers is a mistaken one. They maintained\r\nthat both official and voter should be qualified men and they saw to it\r\nthat they were such. And look at the result; the ablest and best men\r\nwere put forward. Every nation has superior, mediocre, and inferior men;\r\nthe latter being often the most greedy for office. One of the tests of\r\na system of government is which of these classes it brings to the\r\npolitical front. Judged by this, the old colonial and revolutionary\r\nsystem was far superior to the present one. It put in power and kept\r\nthere, Washington, Madison, Franklin, Hamilton, the Adamses, Jefferson,\r\nand a number of their subordinates of great superiority to men in\r\ncorresponding places in the present days of manhood and female suffrage.\r\nBy their fruits you may know them. It is probable that the female\r\nsuffragists firmly believe that their shallow platform ranters are\r\nsuperior to anything that earth can show; but with that exception no one\r\nwill pretend that the present day methods have produced or can produce\r\nfor the public service the equal of that revolutionary stock. Indeed we\r\nhave more reason than some of us fully realize to be thankful that the\r\ngoverning class of that time in this country were men of substance; for\r\nthe opposition to the proposed Federal Constitution in 1788 was very\r\nstrong among the poorer classes; and it is considered certain by those\r\nwho have looked carefully into the matter that had that instrument been\r\nat that time submitted to a vote based on manhood suffrage it would have\r\nbeen overwhelmingly defeated. This is not to be wondered at, since lack\r\nof experience in dealing with any but the simplest matters left those\r\npeople incapable of understanding the provisions of the constitution or\r\nof realizing its beneficent import. One can hardly imagine what that\r\ndefeat would have cost to mankind; the deplorable results of the\r\nindefinite postponement of the American Union with all its blessings of\r\npeace and prosperity, and the perpetuation here on this continent of the\r\ntariffs, strifes, petty wars and tyrannies of Europe and South America.\r\nWhen one tries to imagine the world without the United States of America\r\nas a beneficent enlightening force, one is appalled at the bare\r\npossibility that such a calamity might have been allowed to fall upon\r\nthe world; and yet it was possible had it not been that Hamilton,\r\nWashington and the other leaders in that business were eighteenth\r\ncentury statesmen, staunch, efficient and determined, and not a bunch\r\nof twentieth century cowardly, spineless, brainless, heartless\r\npoliticians, the product of machine and boss rule, such as would\r\nprobably be in charge of any similar movement in the present year of\r\ngrace, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     THE SUFFRAGE IS NOT A NATURAL RIGHT BUT A FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT\r\n     AND MAY THEREFORE PROPERLY BE RESTRICTED TO THOSE COMPETENT TO\r\n     EXERCISE IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose citizens who think that they have or anybody has or can have a\r\nnatural right to vote are absolutely mistaken. There is a general\r\nimpression that such a right exists, created partly by the twaddlers who\r\nwrite on politics for schools and colleges; but it is a false one, and\r\nit is seriously misleading, because it negatives in advance all effort\r\nto elevate the standard of the electorate by excluding the notoriously\r\nunfit from its membership. The citizen votes not in the exercise of a\r\nright or a privilege, but in performance of a governmental function,\r\ninvolving the execution of a trust which should be confined to those\r\ncompetent to exercise it.\r\n\r\nPolitical voting for candidates for office is part of the process of the\r\ncreation of a governing power, and it is itself an act, part and\r\nfunction of government; by it the voter declares his judgment as well as\r\nproposes agents or representatives to enact and to execute the law.\r\nSociety therefore has a right to regulate its exercise, and to see that\r\nit is entrusted into proper and competent hands. This theory of the\r\nright of Society or the State to control and limit the suffrage has been\r\nadopted not only by European nations in dealing with inferior races but\r\nalso by ourselves at home. We do not for instance permit the Chinese to\r\nvote; we exclude from the suffrage youths under twenty-one years of age\r\nand unnaturalized aliens, notwithstanding that they may pay large\r\namounts in taxes and be perfectly honorable and well meaning members of\r\nthe community; also tramps, paupers and the insane. So the policy of\r\nexcluding the colored race from full participation in the government of\r\nthe country is thoroughly established in the United States. Negroes are\r\nnot actually allowed to vote except where they are in a safe minority.\r\nIn the States of California, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Washington and Wyoming there is a\r\nnominal educational qualification by which at least a pretence has been\r\nmade of excluding ignorant whites from the franchise, and which has been\r\neffectively used in some of these States to exclude thousands of colored\r\nvoters. The suffrage has been denied to non-taxpaying Indians in all\r\nparts of the United States, notwithstanding that many of them may be\r\ndecent and intelligent people. One Northern State, New Hampshire, and\r\neleven Southern States make payment of a poll tax a necessary\r\nprerequisite to voting. A certain period of preliminary residence is\r\nprescribed in all the States. In thirty-eight states a previous\r\nregistration is required; and this provision every year disfranchises\r\nthousands of travelling salesmen and others. Thirty-two States exclude\r\nwomen from all or specified elections, and though the expediency of this\r\nexclusion has been seriously challenged, the right to enact it is\r\nunquestioned by most people.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that in the American polity the principle is\r\npractically well recognized that voting is not a natural right but a\r\nfunction of government which may properly be restricted, either to\r\nproperty holders as in fact it was by our ancestors restricted, or to\r\nany other class as the State may ordain. There is however, reason to\r\nbelieve that the general public has not reflected enough on the subject\r\nto assimilate or even to accept this proposition. The American masses\r\ntake most of their so-called opinions ready made, and as far as any\r\npopular theory upon the subject or conception thereof is to be found\r\namong them, it is apparently a vague loose notion of a natural equality\r\namong men; an understanding that it is part of the original American\r\ntradition that every man has an equal natural right to take part in\r\ngovernment or at least to “express himself” by his vote. We have seen\r\nin the last chapter that the original American tradition is just to the\r\ncontrary, and demands a substantial property qualification for all\r\nvoters. In a subsequent chapter it will appear how that original\r\nAmerican tradition was foolishly and thoughtlessly abandoned, when\r\nmanhood suffrage and the spoils system were together foisted upon us in\r\nthe time of Andrew Jackson.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, an examination of the libraries does not disclose any\r\nstrong authority or well reasoned argument in favor of the practice of\r\ngiving a vote to every adult man or woman. The doctrine of the natural\r\nright to vote which was first practised by the French radicals of the\r\neighteenth century appears to have been accepted as a piece of popular\r\nsentimentality; apparently it has not been adopted by any great thinker\r\nor writer. Those writers who favor it are generally superficialists, and\r\nare content to refer to it vaguely as a step in the progress of the age\r\nwithout any close examination of its merits. As for the theories of\r\nnatural equality between men, and of the right to vote as a means of\r\nself expression neither of them will stand a moment’s serious\r\nreflection. No equality of any kind whatsoever exists or ever can exist\r\nbetween men. It is impossible even to imagine a tolerable existence\r\nunder the crushing weight of the monotony of equality. Along with\r\nvariety would perish love, hope and joy; ambition, the great source of\r\ninitiative and the most powerful stimulus to effort would be destroyed;\r\nlife would lose its picturesqueness, and instead of a bright running\r\nstream it would become a stagnant pool. Equality means death; its domain\r\nis the cemetery. The champions of manhood suffrage therefore will have\r\nto look elsewhere for its justification than in an assertion of an\r\nequality which cannot exist.\r\n\r\nBut we will be told that there is an “equality of rights.” Here is\r\nanother absurd phrase, which as generally applied is false or\r\nmeaningless. By equality of rights people generally refer to personal\r\nrights such as the right to life, to personal liberty, etc. But there\r\nis no point of resemblance, no analogy even, between the character of\r\nsuch a right and of the asserted right to suffrage. The latter is a\r\nclaim to share with others, and therefore acquired and artificial. The\r\nright of a man to his life, however, is not one in which others can\r\nshare; and all natural rights are of the same general character,\r\nabsolute, strictly personal and exclusive. The claim to vote rests on an\r\nentirely different basis from such; it is social, and involves others\r\nand the rights of others, it is a claim to govern; it vitally affects\r\nevery one else and therefore no man can assert it without the others\r\nbeing consulted, since to do so would infringe upon _their_ social\r\nrights. No such right can possibly be an original or natural right; for\r\nnatural rights are of course common to all men; and the absurdity of\r\nevery man having the natural right to impose his will upon another man\r\nis manifest. To say that there exists a natural right common to all men\r\ninvolving power over others, or that one man has a natural right to\r\ninterfere with the actions of others, or of a society formed of others,\r\nor a natural right whose exercise by some would deprive other men of\r\ntheir own similar rights is nonsense; since these last would have the\r\nsame power over the first and the result would be chaos. Such a\r\nproposition involves a complete contradiction of itself, and an\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\nSociety and political organizations are artificially created, and all\r\nrights under them are artificially acquired. The result of the exercise\r\nof some power, or founded upon an agreement of some kind, express or\r\nimplied, they are in the nature of gifts or functions conferred by\r\nsociety upon the individual. Of this character is the voting franchise.\r\nThere can be no natural right to the control of society or even to take\r\npart in society against its will, both of which as social and legal, not\r\nnatural rights, are asserted and employed by every voter. The only\r\nnatural right that a man can have towards society is to escape from it\r\naltogether to a place not occupied by other men.\r\n\r\nThese considerations dispose of the sentimental twaddle uttered\r\nsometimes by shallow magazine writers and unsophisticated college\r\nprofessors that every man has a natural right to what they call\r\n“political self expression.” Self expression by political voting always\r\ninvolves in some way the exercise of power over others; and no one can\r\nhave a natural right to such power.\r\n\r\nThe above reasoning applies of course to the exercise of the voting\r\npower where it affects the property of others as well as where it\r\ndirectly affects only the person. No man can have a natural right to\r\ndispose of another’s property or any part of it by voting or otherwise.\r\nTo talk of a natural right to vote away another man’s property is\r\ndownright nonsense. Imagine a small independent island inhabited by one\r\nhundred families each with property honestly acquired. Would an\r\nimmigrant body of five hundred have a natural right by a vote to\r\nconfiscate this property? The proposition is monstrous, yet it is all\r\nimplied in the theory of a natural right to vote.\r\n\r\nOur Courts and Judges have never held suffrage to be a natural right,\r\nand it has never been treated as such in our legislation. Marshall,\r\nChief Justice of the United States, says: “The granting of the franchise\r\nhas always been regarded in the practice of nations as a matter of\r\nexpediency and not as an inherent right.” And Judge Cooley: “Suffrage\r\ncannot be the natural right of the individual because it does not exist\r\nfor the benefit of the individual but for the benefit of the State\r\nitself.” (_Principles of Constitutional Law_, p. 249.) So on our statute\r\nbooks voting is not treated as a natural right, nor is the citizen mass\r\nconsidered as the supreme power in the state; but the constitution and\r\nfunctions of the electorate are created and determined by the\r\nlegislative body, or under its direction, and its capacity is fixed by\r\nlaw and derived from the law just as truly as that of any other body\r\nexercising political powers in the government.\r\n\r\nIf suffrage were a natural right, the voter might exercise it to please\r\nhimself or solely for his own interest. But nobody pretends that this is\r\nthe case. It is conceded that the function of the voter is not to\r\ngratify himself nor to practise experiments, nor to express his own\r\npersonal ideas, nor primarily nor mainly to foster his own interests or\r\nthose of his class, but to propose the best men and measures for the\r\ncountry at large. He is not to seek direct personal benefit or gain by\r\nhis vote but is expected thereby to contribute his opinion, his wisdom,\r\nhis experience, to the promotion of the general welfare. He is not to\r\nvote for a judge because he expects him to decide a lawsuit in his\r\nfavor; nor for a congressman because he hopes that he will help to\r\nsecure him a contract or a pension or a tariff rate favorable to his\r\nbusiness; but it is his duty to vote for judges and congressmen who will\r\ndecide and legislate justly, that is, with due regard for all. This\r\nmakes it clear that the franchise is not a gift of nature, but a trust\r\nor function created by society for its own high purposes; that the voter\r\ncomes to the polls to take part in that function not as a master but as\r\na servant of the State in obedience to her mandate; and must be clad\r\nwith such qualifications as she prescribes. The voters are not masters\r\nor rulers as is so often erroneously said, they are merely called upon\r\nto designate the real rulers and masters of the land. When the citizen\r\napproaches the polls on election day he there finds in operation a\r\nformidable electoral machine which he is sometimes told is a contrivance\r\nwhose object is to establish the rule of the people. But this is a\r\nsuperficial understanding of the matter; the people cannot possibly rule\r\nthemselves; the existence of any rule whatever implies rulers as well as\r\nthose ruled over; to talk of the people ruling is nonsense, or at best a\r\nmere figure of speech to indicate that they have a choice of rulers.\r\nHere as elsewhere there is and must be a government ruling by force;\r\nhere as elsewhere that government is a human machine wielding or\r\nintended to wield irresistible power over its subjects, and constantly\r\nmenacing the disobedient with deprivation of property, liberty and life.\r\nOur elective system is really a means for sustaining this tremendous\r\napparatus and of keeping it in operation and effective. It is that all\r\npowerful governmental organism and not the people which rules the\r\ncountry. Every American is just as much under the control of the\r\nauthority thus created as the subject of any ruler whatever. Freedom in\r\nthe sense of liberty to the individual to thwart or neglect governmental\r\nauthority is not within the American scheme. This is why resident\r\nforeigners, deceived by the silly newspaper cant about the “people”\r\nruling are frequently surprised to find themselves more restricted in\r\nsome respects than they were in their own native monarchical countries.\r\n\r\nThis view of the matter whereby it appears that an election is the first\r\nstep in the process of the creation of a government requires the manhood\r\nsuffrage question to be presented in a different form from the usual one\r\nwhich is, “Has a man as such a right to vote?” He has no such inherent\r\nor natural right, and the real question is whether he is of the proper\r\nmaterial for use in the first process of democratic government making.\r\nIt follows too that the burden is on the would-be voter to show that he\r\nis fit for that purpose. The mere fact that he is a dweller in the land\r\ncannot possibly confer upon him the right to inject poor material into\r\nthe government-making process, any more than one of a number interested\r\nin a cider press would have the right to insist on putting decayed\r\napples into the hopper.\r\n\r\nBut even if there was a natural right to vote Society would still have\r\nthe power to regulate its exercise and to establish conditions thereof.\r\nCertainly Society would have the right to prohibit that exercise and it\r\nwould be its duty to do so when the same would operate against the\r\nwelfare of the community at large; or against the welfare of every other\r\nperson in it except the voter himself; or even against the welfare of\r\nthe majority of the citizens of the community. A man can no more have a\r\nnatural right to injure his neighbor by his vote than by any other\r\nmeans; and just as he is free to use his personal liberty only to the\r\nextent to which his actions are harmless or beneficial to the community,\r\nso as a matter of natural right he should be only free to vote or\r\nlegislate and take part in government affairs, great or small, to the\r\nextent to which his acts in that capacity are harmless or beneficial.\r\nIn any aspect of the matter therefore Society has the right to limit the\r\nsuffrage to such as are likely to exercise it for the benefit of the\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThus by disposing of the vague idea of a natural right to vote, the way\r\nis cleared for a consideration of the proper qualifications which\r\nSociety should require from voters. That there are men and classes of\r\nmen naturally incapable of exercising the judgment necessary to cast a\r\nballot helpful to the community is known to all of us. Says Amiel in his\r\nJournal:\r\n\r\n“The pretension that every man has the necessary qualities of a citizen\r\nsimply because he was born twenty-one years ago, is as much as to say\r\nthat labor, merit, virtue, character and experience are to count for\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nNot only has the country the right to exclude incapables from the\r\nsuffrage, but it is the patriotic duty of the good citizen to place a\r\nvoluntary limitation on himself, and to refrain altogether from voting\r\nwhere through ignorance of the candidates or subject matter his vote\r\ncannot be intelligently cast. For, just as the voter is peremptorily\r\ncalled upon in casting his vote to disregard entirely his own interest\r\nand pleasure, and even to vote contrary to his interests and prejudices\r\nfor the benefit of his country, so surely he can also be required in the\r\npublic interest to surrender his privilege of voting, to remain\r\naltogether silent, and to allow the choice of men and measures to be\r\nmade by his more intelligent neighbors. And it further follows, that\r\nwhere the ignorant voter knowingly and wilfully insists upon expressing\r\nhis own opinion or prejudice at the polls in opposition to the judgment\r\nof another better qualified than he, his act is immoral and unpatriotic;\r\nand equally immoral and unpatriotic is the conduct of the legislator,\r\nwriter or voter who knowingly countenances or assists in the\r\nenfranchisement of a class of people who are incompetent to vote on the\r\nquestions to be presented to them, or to select the proper candidates\r\nfor public offices.\r\n\r\nVoting at a political election being an act of government, the proper\r\ntest of the voter is that of capacity to govern. As Bagehot puts it:--\r\n\r\n     “Fitness to govern must depend on the community to be governed and\r\n     on the merits of other persons who may be capable of governing that\r\n     community. A savage chief may be capable of governing a savage\r\n     tribe. He may have the right of governing it, for he may be the\r\n     sole person capable of so doing: but he would have no right to\r\n     govern England. Whatever may be your capacity for rule, you have no\r\n     right to obtain the opportunity of exercising it by dethroning a\r\n     person who is more capable; you are wronging the community if you\r\n     do, if you are depriving it of a better government than that which\r\n     you can give to it.... The true principle is, that every person has\r\n     a right to so much political power as he can exercise, without\r\n     impeding any other person who would more fitly exercise such\r\n     power.... Any such measure for enfranchising the lower orders as\r\n     would overpower and consequently disfranchise the higher should be\r\n     resisted on the ground of abstract right; you are proposing to take\r\n     power from those who have the superior capacity, and to rest it in\r\n     those who have but an inferior capacity or in many cases no\r\n     capacity at all.” (_Parliamentary Reform_, 1859.)\r\n\r\nIn calling to its counsels at the polls such citizens as the State may\r\ndeem competent for that purpose, it is practically impossible to select\r\nindividuals; but it is quite possible to designate certain classes to\r\nwhom suffrage may or may not be permitted; and when these classes are\r\nopen to receive accessions indefinitely upon conditions useful to the\r\nState and attainable by all, there is nothing in the whole transaction\r\ninimical to the best democracy, or of which complaint can be made on the\r\nground of monopoly or injustice. The acquisition and judicious\r\nmanagement of a reasonable amount of property are terms and conditions\r\nof just this character and experience has amply shown the necessity for\r\ntheir imposition in the interests of society.\r\n\r\nTo summarize this branch of the subject. The primary object of an ideal\r\nelection is not to ascertain where lies the interest or to gratify the\r\ncaprices or whims of individuals, but to continue and sustain, and if\r\nnecessary to create the government of the country. The exercise of this\r\nfunction is in itself an act of government or in aid of government, and\r\nthe privilege of participation therein is an acquired, a conferred\r\nauthority or function, not a natural right, and should be bestowed\r\nsolely for merit or capacity to be exercised in trust for the common\r\nbenefit. It is the patriotic duty of all incapable, unprepared or\r\nunqualified citizens voluntarily to refrain from taking part in this\r\nfunction; and it is the right and duty of the State by appropriate\r\nlegislation to exclude peremptorily therefrom all classes of men\r\nincapable of its proper exercise, and for this purpose to establish\r\nracial, property, educational, or other appropriate qualifications.\r\n\r\nOn the theory that the State itself may be supposed to have been\r\noriginally inaugurated and its operations originally sanctioned by the\r\nsuffrages of all its citizens as their creature and agent, a curious\r\nquestion has been raised by some writers, namely, on what ground the\r\nState can exclude from the constituent franchise a part, though ever so\r\nsmall, of its original creators or principals. Such writers have,\r\nhowever, overlooked the existence of a power higher and mightier than\r\nthat of the State or of its inhabitants at any particular period; a\r\npower which is the real source of the authority of the State. This power\r\nis “Society,” and its relation to the subject of the franchise will be\r\ndealt with in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AS THE DEPUTY OF SOCIETY POSSESSES THE JUST POWER OF ORDAINING\r\nFRANCHISE QUALIFICATIONS\r\n\r\n    _Yes, for it was not Zeus who gave them forth,_\r\n    _Nor Justice, dwelling with the gods below,_\r\n    _Who traced these laws for all the sons of men;_\r\n    _The unwritten laws of God that know no change,_\r\n    _They are not of today nor yesterday,_\r\n    _But live forever, nor can man assign,_\r\n    _When first they sprang to being._\r\n              (SOPHOCLES: “Antigone”)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last chapter was suggested a question which troubles\r\nmany superficial but honest and sympathetic thinkers. How, say they, can\r\na democratic State justly refuse the suffrage to any citizen? They see\r\nplainly the policy of such refusal in many cases; they realize the\r\nmischief of permitting discordant voices to mar the democracy of the\r\ncultivated choir of good citizenship, the danger of allowing rotten\r\ntimbers in the structure of the ship of State; they wish for some\r\nsuperior power to silence the one or remove the other; but they cannot\r\nsee that such a power exists. Can a man or any group of men in a\r\ndemocracy justly assume such superiority of judgment as the exercise of\r\nthis power would imply? If the State be as democracy asserts, the\r\ncreature, the agent of the people, how can it by refusing the franchise\r\nto any of its citizens rightfully deprive them of a voice in its\r\ndeliberations? Is not such refusal in its essence a tyranny and a\r\nnegation of democracy? No doubt some such feeling as above expressed,\r\nthough perhaps more vaguely formulated, actuated many who, with more or\r\nless reluctance made the blunder of acquiescing in the establishment of\r\nwhite manhood suffrage in the first quarter of the nineteenth century,\r\nand also many of those who forty years later made the still greater\r\nblunder of accepting negro suffrage.\r\n\r\nAn answer to all these scruples familiar to all sound lawyers and quite\r\nsufficient for most intelligent men, is found in the law of self\r\npreservation. Before any law or rule of a state or community can be\r\nenacted, the state or community must have existence, and the enactment\r\nimplies that the state’s continuance is to be secured. The original law\r\nof its being must first be satisfied, and must ever remain superior to\r\nall other of its enactments. It is sufficient reason therefore for the\r\nsuppression of the votes of the unworthy that they are prejudicial to\r\nthe State, and the State in its struggle for existence may rightfully\r\nsuppress them.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another complete answer to the questions above\r\npropounded, and one perhaps still more satisfying to some minds than\r\nthat of the primal right of self preservation; and that is, that there\r\ndoes exist a higher warrant for the disfranchisement of unworthy voters,\r\nand for all suffrage regulations, conditions and qualifications than the\r\nmere precept of the State. This higher sanction is that which authorized\r\nmen in the beginning to found the commonwealth in which we live. What\r\nwas that authority? Imagine if you please the foundation of a state. By\r\nwhat rightful authority did the first white settlers in Virginia or\r\nMassachusetts establish a government and proceed by its agency to deal\r\nwith the property, lives and liberty of the members of their little\r\ncompany and of all new comers? By what rightful authority did they for\r\ninstance execute the first malefactor? The answer is, by the mandate of\r\nSociety. For even if it be true, as many insist, that the State has no\r\noriginal power, but is a mere created agency of limited authority, it\r\nyet does not follow that that authority has no basis but the fiat of the\r\nelectorate and no justification beyond certain election certificates and\r\nits own statutes. There is a mighty mundane power in constant operation\r\namongst men, one far superior and anterior to the State; a part indeed\r\nor manifestation of that almighty persistent and mysterious force which\r\nmaketh for righteousness in this world; a potentate with whose\r\noperations we are all perfectly familiar and whom we may here, for want\r\nof a better word, designate by the name “Society.” The idea intended\r\nhere to be represented by that word is somewhat difficult of definition.\r\nWe may approximately indicate our meaning by defining “Society” as\r\nHumanity self organized for the promotion of civilization; but we can\r\nbest identify her by noting some of her operations and attributes. She\r\nfinds her original source as all true authority must in the Eternal\r\nVerities, and her sovereignty is mysterious in its deepest origin as is\r\neverything vital in the universe. Her forms and methods are fine and\r\nsubtle beyond description. She is not the State; she antedates the\r\nState; she was the source of the authority of our first American\r\nancestors to establish governments and to execute justice, and was the\r\nfounder and is the mistress and director of all states and governments\r\nthat ever were or ever will be. Nor can she be identified with the\r\npopulation or body of citizenship of the nation or community; she is\r\nsomething which remains outside and independent of all these; possessing\r\na separate organism, life and growth of her own. Society is the\r\nOverlord, the vital essence of which the State is the manifestation; she\r\nis to the State what the spirit is to the human body; and for her the\r\nState exists and was created. Her membership is not confined to any\r\nclass, but includes all those who voluntarily submit to her decrees.\r\nThese she organizes in a way peculiar to herself, assigning to them\r\nrights, obligations, influence and power without regard to laws or\r\nstatutes except those of her own original promulgation, disregarding\r\nentirely the shallow and false modern notion of equality between men.\r\nFor just as no two individuals have exactly the same appearance or\r\nphysical power, so in the whole social domain there are no two members\r\nwho are in every respect or indeed in any respect the social equals of\r\neach other. Her membership has its own traditions, rules and standards\r\nwhich she promulgates by silent and subtle methods, often finally\r\ncompelling their formal adoption by the State. Her mandates are more\r\npowerful than those of governments; and all political decrees are\r\nsubordinate to the constitutions of civilized society. Her honors and\r\npowers are often more valued than those of the State, and are conferred\r\nnot as in our politics at the command of mere numbers, as prizes for\r\noratory or rewards for intrigue, but in consideration of social\r\naptitudes and energies; so that in any given community you will find the\r\nsocial development of each individual to correspond with his or her\r\ncompliance with the rules and mandates of Society.\r\n\r\nThus is constituted what may be called the Social Commonwealth,\r\n_imperium in imperio_, composed of all those who take up the cause of\r\ncivilization; a number which does not necessarily represent a majority\r\nor any definite proportion of the people of the community, but does\r\nrepresent and include the community’s mental and moral force and\r\ncivilizing influence. Its leaders or captains are comparatively few;\r\nthey are readily distinguishable as active champions of social progress;\r\nspending time and effort for the cause; zealous in the establishment of\r\npublic order; in advancing public health, in creating and maintaining\r\nbeauty in public and private life; in forwarding enterprises of\r\nreligion, art, education, science and benevolence; in promoting\r\ncivilizing institutions, such as libraries, hospitals, churches; also\r\noperas, music, dancing and all the refinements of life; in creating\r\nparks and flower gardens, in beautifying cities and villages; in\r\nelevating the standards of dress, manners and private living, and in\r\nfurthering all civilizing and humanizing influences. Following these\r\nleaders at greater or less social distance are the great body of the\r\nmembership of the Social Commonwealth composed of all classes of rich\r\nand poor and between, the great mass of the socially loyal, themselves\r\noriginating and initiating nothing of social importance, but faithfully\r\nkeeping up year by year with the steadily advancing procession;\r\ndirecting their children in the way of sweetness and light, that so they\r\nmay reach the places where the social leaders stood a generation\r\nbefore. So that a basis for the establishment of a qualified electorate\r\nand for the exclusion therefrom of the disqualified is found in the\r\nprimary fact of the existence of two classes of humanity, the one\r\nincluding the socially fit, the socially organized, the members of the\r\nSocial Commonwealth; and the others the non-members of that\r\norganization. As already stated, not all the inhabitants of our borders\r\nare the lieges of Society; there is the considerable body of the\r\nunsocial; comprising those cold and indifferent to the social cause, the\r\nsocially worthless, the nondescript and the rabble; also the\r\nanti-social; the openly hostile, the criminals and malefactors of the\r\ncommunity. The existence of these two divisions of men, the social and\r\nthe unsocial, justifies and requires the State to distinguish between\r\nthem in granting the voting franchise. The primary test of voting\r\ncapacity is and must be allegiance to the social commonwealth.\r\n\r\nSociety was born when humanity emerged from savagery, and will endure\r\nwhile civilization continues in the world. The Jacobins of France of\r\n1790, like the present Bolsheviki of Russia, got possession of the State\r\nmachinery and turning it against Society swore to destroy her forever;\r\nafter a dozen years of strife she emerged from the conflict stronger\r\nthan before. She accompanied the first immigrants to Massachusetts Bay,\r\nto Jamestown and to every other American settlement. There she was on\r\nthe very first day and ever after with her customs, traditions, beliefs,\r\nclasses, prejudices, dress, manners and standards of conduct, ready to\r\nenforce them in America with the same despotic authority exercised long\r\nbefore in the England of the Plantagenets, Normans, Saxons and Romans.\r\nAnd then and there in the fields and forests of the new world, Society\r\nestablished governments as her agents to enforce her mandates, imposing\r\nher will upon the States which she thus created. Since then, by Society\r\nhas the onward course of the nation at all times been directed.\r\nGovernments may change; peace may follow war; the monarchy may give way\r\nto a republic or dictatorship and that to a democracy, or vice versa;\r\nlaws may be enacted and repealed, constitutions established and\r\nabolished, but the rule of the Social Commonwealth goes on forever.\r\n\r\nIt is to Society, the champion of civilization, that the enlightened\r\ncivilized man considers his allegiance is ultimately due, and only to\r\nthe State as the agent of Society. A law to be valid and enforceable\r\nmust conform to social mandates. The late James C. Carter, a noted New\r\nYork lawyer, is the author of a philosophical treatise on Law in which\r\nhe clearly establishes this principle. He says (p. 120); “That to which\r\nwe give the name of Law always has been, still is, and will forever\r\ncontinue to be Custom.” But customs are merely the ordinances of\r\nSociety. When the State forgets its duty to Society it does so at its\r\nperil; let it enact for example, a Fugitive Slave Law and the Emersons,\r\nThoreaus, Beechers and other social leaders refuse obedience and defy\r\nthe State. In like manner, wars are justified when decreed by Society\r\nagainst unsocial sovereign states in the interests of civilization, as\r\nfor instance, some of the modern wars of civilized powers against\r\nTurkey. Consider the actual political power and operations of Society.\r\nCompare the statute books of today with those of fifty or a hundred\r\nyears ago and note the changes she has dictated in that period. History\r\nis sad and bloody with the story of the efforts of the State to modify\r\nthe religious practices of men; they have all failed; but Society does\r\nnot fail to change these practices year by year. Commerce, manufactures,\r\ntransportation, the arts, education, customs, manners, all human\r\ninstitutions are in turn created and destroyed by Society, and law and\r\nthe State are powerless to defeat permanently her decrees, while their\r\nown are only valid when stamped with her approval.\r\n\r\nHere then we find in the inherent powers of Society, in powers which are\r\nGod-given or Nature-given if you prefer, an answer to the scruples of\r\nthose who seek a source of authority in the State to protect its life by\r\npreserving its own machinery. It is this supreme potentate acting by and\r\nthrough the State that we invoke to settle the structure of the State\r\non the foundations of capacity and intelligence.\r\n\r\nConsider now the interest of Society in the proper regulation of the\r\nsuffrage as the source and foundation of the State. Not alone is she\r\nvitally interested in the maintenance of the present civilizing forces\r\nwhich are sending us forward day by day on the march to higher planes of\r\nlife; but also in preserving the material and intellectual inheritance\r\nof all the ages. This inheritance includes all the accumulated\r\nacquisitions of the civilized human race; its property, treasures,\r\nachievements and traditions; all the products of its mental and physical\r\nendeavor, the fruits of its art, literature, science and industry. These\r\nconstitute the body of civilization in which its soul and mind are\r\npreserved, nourished and kept alive; they form a social trust for\r\nourselves and for posterity. “Civilization,” said Burke, is “a triple\r\ncontract between the noble dead, the “living and the unborn.” And by\r\nthat contract we are forbidden to live or to legislate so as to cheat\r\nthose who come after.\r\n\r\nSociety’s process for the preservation of our intellectual inheritance\r\nis called education; her method for the preservation of our material\r\ninheritance is the institution of private property rights. Humanity,\r\nproperty and education combined, constitute the material endowment of\r\nsociety, wherewith she works for the advancement of the human race, or\r\nas otherwise expressed for the promotion of civilization. Obviously she\r\nis justified in adopting all possible precautions to guard and preserve\r\nthis precious deposit committed to her charge, nor can it be doubted\r\nthat she should carefully select its custodians and overseers. Equally\r\nplain is it that since the civilization of the nation is and has been\r\nproduced entirely by the thrifty members of the Social Commonwealth and\r\nremains in their guardianship, they and they alone, as constituting the\r\nclass who have produced and cared for the same should be continued in\r\nits care as the representatives of Society and in her behalf; and should\r\nbe authorized to formulate the laws and measures which make for its\r\nprotection and advancement. To this end and purpose Society is\r\nconstantly endeavoring. A volume could be written illustrating the\r\nexercise of her steady and mighty influence in placing the scepter in\r\nthe hands of her chosen ones. Rome was the ancient conservator of\r\ncivilization, and to her was given sway for centuries; England of all\r\nmodern nations has been most devoted to preserving the best of the\r\nproduct of the generations as they pass on, and she and her race were\r\nmade foremost among nations and peoples. Look at the community where you\r\nlive and you will easily note how Society bestows influence, authority,\r\ndistinction and esteem upon her own workers, the builders and creators\r\nof civilization and upon their children, and passes contemptuously by\r\nthe unsocial and anti-social. You cannot fail to observe her disdain of\r\nthe mere talkers and wasters and how she brings to naught the works and\r\ncheap distinctions of a manhood suffrage constituency. To the silly\r\nFrench Jacobin scheme of ascertaining the best by counting noses,\r\nSociety opposes her own never failing system of continuous study,\r\ntraining and selection. She does not favor, on the contrary, she\r\ndiscourages the absurd and impossible purpose of modern liberalism of\r\ngiving expression to ignorant individual wills with all their clashing\r\nselfishness and brutality. She does not favor the politician’s purpose\r\nof perpetuating moral feebleness and incapacity, nor of forwarding the\r\nfoolish aims and ideas of the weak and the worthless. She is far from\r\ngiving office or power to such or from even hearkening to their prattle\r\nand humbug. She has much to overcome. The power that makes for\r\nrighteousness is not permitted to operate without the opposition of\r\nfools and charlatans; and it is within Society’s function to master this\r\nopposition, which she invariably does in the end. She constantly refuses\r\nto descend as manhood suffrage does to the level of the ignoble; on the\r\ncontrary when they presume to oppose her in her momentous business she\r\nundertakes either to conquer them by reclamation or to see that they are\r\nhanged or otherwise removed out of her implacable path.\r\n\r\nIt is the crime of manhood suffrage that it constantly endeavors to\r\noppose and thwart this all beneficent social tendency; that it pushes to\r\nthe front and seeks to give power in civic affairs to the non-social and\r\nanti-social classes, consisting of men devoid of the instinct for the\r\ncreation and preservation of the useful and the beautiful, and who\r\ncannot safely be trusted as their guardians. In so doing it perverts the\r\nState from its proper functions. The State has no rightful authority\r\nover men’s lives except as the deputy of Society, and its every\r\nlegitimate act should and must be for the promotion of beneficial social\r\nobjects. It is its clear duty as such deputy to place political control\r\nin the hands of those gifted with distinguished social attributes; and\r\nan essential and the first step in that direction is the discarding of\r\nmanhood suffrage and all similar unnatural political stupidities which\r\ninevitably lead to Jacobinism, Bolshevism, anarchy, ruin and death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     THE CAPACITY TO CREATE AND PRESERVE PRIVATE PROPERTY IS THE PROPER\r\n     TEST AND PROOF OF QUALIFICATION FOR ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP IN AN\r\n     ADVANCED DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two principal arguments in favor of a property qualification\r\nfor voters; one the argument of fitness, that the propertied class are\r\nthe most capable of passing upon affairs of state; the other the\r\nargument of justice, that the business of government principally\r\nconcerns property, namely, the belongings and the productions of\r\npropertied people. Both these arguments assume that what is wanted is an\r\nhonest and efficient government, not a corrupt and inefficient one.\r\n\r\nThe demand for a property qualification for voters is predicated upon\r\nthe theory that there is an obligation on the part of the citizens of a\r\nstate to contribute towards its material prosperity; a duty of such\r\nimportance that the state cannot flourish in the face of its neglect;\r\nthat the class of men who are incapable of creating and preserving\r\nproperty is unfitted to form part of the electorate; and that neither\r\nnative birth nor the taking of a naturalization oath is sufficient\r\nqualification for the duties and function of active citizenship in a\r\ngenuine democracy. There may be valid excuses such as ill health,\r\nignorance, etc., for the individual’s failure to perform his part in the\r\nwork of civilization, but such excuses do not disprove the existence of\r\nthe obligation in others, but rather emphasize it. It is not well\r\nfulfilled when the citizen only produces enough from day to day for his\r\nimmediate support, or wastes the surplus, leaving the burden upon others\r\nto provide for the time of old age, sickness and incapacity. Its proper\r\nperformance therefore involves the exercise of the virtue known as\r\nprudence, a systematic saving or accumulation of property for the joint\r\nbenefit of the individual and the State. The practice of this virtue is\r\nincumbent not merely upon good citizens but upon every citizen and tends\r\nto qualify for active citizenship. Like cleanliness, it is not a\r\nsuperfluous but an essential virtue. The neglect of home cleanliness may\r\nbreed a pestilence; the neglect of home prudence may unfairly burden the\r\ncommunity; such neglect is an act of disloyalty to Society and to the\r\nState, and is a proof of such civic incapacity and indifference as to\r\nrequire in any well regulated political community, the placing of the\r\noffender in the class of passive citizens who are not entitled to the\r\nsuffrage. His country’s protection is a sufficient reward for one of\r\nthat class for merely taking the trouble to be born in her domain. Let\r\nhim be content to be what Sieyes called a passive citizen till he has\r\nproved his qualification to be an active one. If there be, which is\r\ndoubtful, exceptional cases of men such that neither they nor their\r\nforefathers were actually able to earn more than enough to support them,\r\nor having earned it to take care of it, and yet are capable of directing\r\naffairs of state they are so few as to be negligible. Such men need the\r\nspur of disfranchisement to make them go ahead, and meantime the thrifty\r\ncan legislate for them. Constitutional legislation can only deal with\r\ngroups, or classes, and cannot properly attempt to provide for such\r\nextraordinary exceptions.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is an ideal form of government for none but a highly capable\r\npeople; a representative government of a worthless or a politically\r\nindifferent constituency will be a worthless government, the more\r\nrepresentative the more worthless. Witness Hayti, San Domingo, Mexico,\r\nand certain Central American or South American democracies. These are\r\ntotally incapable because their electorates are totally incapable, and\r\nin this country the democracy, though not a complete failure, is a\r\npartial failure, namely, to the extent that its life is vitiated by an\r\ninferior constituency. There are thousands of men, not to speak of\r\nwomen, on our voting list who are as incompetent to exercise the\r\nfunctions of voters as the inferior orders of Mexico or Hayti. Many of\r\nthe improvident classes have minds absolutely childish and utterly\r\nincapable of foresight or serious reflection. At an election held in\r\nAshton in England under the recently extended suffrage system, a\r\ntheatrical man named de Freece was elected to Parliament not because of\r\nhis political views, but because of the amusing performances of his\r\nwife, a noted vaudeville actress. We quote from a newspaper:\r\n\r\n“Vesta Tilley, the most popular male impersonator London has known in\r\ndecades, took a prominent part in the campaign. Her ‘Picadilly Johnnie\r\nwith the little glass eye’ and other popular songs, it was admitted\r\nplayed a far greater part in the election than her husband’s political\r\nviews.” We may be sure it was the unpropertied and non-tax-paying rabble\r\nwhose vote went in favor of “Picadilly Johnnie.” Lord Bryce’s\r\ndescription of the indifferent or incompetent British voters applies\r\nwell enough to our own:\r\n\r\n     “Though they possess political power, and are better pleased to\r\n     have it, they do not really care about it--that is to say, politics\r\n     occupy no appreciable space in their thoughts and interests. Some\r\n     of them vote at elections because they consider themselves to\r\n     belong to a party, or fancy that on a given occasion they have more\r\n     to expect from the one party than from the other; or because they\r\n     are brought up on election day by some one who can influence\r\n     them.... Others will not take the trouble to go to the polls....\r\n     Many have not even political prepossessions, and will stare or\r\n     smile when asked to which party they belong. They count for little\r\n     except at elections, and then chiefly as instruments to be used by\r\n     others. So far as the formation or exercise of opinion goes, they\r\n     may be left out of sight.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, pp.\r\n     319-20.)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to weigh merits so nicely as to exclude all of this\r\nclass; it is impracticable to disfranchise a man for frivolity even\r\nthough he be so frivolous that his vote depends on the song of an\r\nactress, but when that frivolity gives itself concrete expression such\r\nas incapacity to acquire or retain property, it may and should be\r\nexcluded from our political life.\r\n\r\nIn considering the proposition that the creation and preservation of\r\nproperty is a primary duty of citizenship, we must realize the absolute\r\nessentiality of accumulated property in the scheme of civilization. We\r\nall know the value of money, but we are generally loath to formally\r\nacknowledge its importance. There is a prevalent affectation of\r\nindifference towards it, assumed by vain fools as a mark of superiority,\r\nand by spendthrift fools to excuse their stupid poverty. This\r\naffectation is encouraged by the writers of the popular magazines and\r\nnewspapers and other cheap literature which is published for the masses,\r\nwho are supposed to be poor and to like to be flattered by being told\r\nthat their poverty, instead of being a mark of inferiority as it really\r\nis, is a sign of superior goodness. This sort of writing misleads many\r\nthoughtless people to their detriment. Civilization can only be\r\nexpressed in terms of property; and property is its token, its\r\nmanifestation, its note, its unfailing indication, its hall mark. There\r\nis not a quality, a circumstance, a feature of civilization which is not\r\nrepresented in some way by property, either by being due to property,\r\nderived from property, originating in property, or sustained by\r\nproperty. The desire for property is an attribute of man; denied to the\r\nlower animals and dormant in savages, such as the North American Indians\r\nwho when discovered, had no permanent property, not even a year’s\r\nprovisions to live on in times of scarcity, and had created nothing for\r\nposterity. A pauperized people is on the direct road to barbarism. On\r\nthe other hand, the higher the grade of civilization the greater the\r\nwealth of the country; so that to attain the very highest grade we must\r\npass far beyond the period of aggregation of merely useful things and\r\nreach a point of great luxury, where men can spend lives and millions in\r\nthe service of the high arts and refinements of life, and where in an\r\natmosphere enriched by the artistic emanations of centuries, are\r\nproduced operas costing $10,000 a day, and palaces and cathedrals at an\r\nexpenditure of the time of generations of men and of hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars in money.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the main object of our government should be to\r\npreserve our political institutions. This is too short-sighted a view.\r\nThese institutions are not an ultimate object; they are only the means\r\nof promoting and protecting civilization, the which ought to be the\r\nprincipal and ultimate object of the State. This object is to be\r\naccomplished by encouraging the citizens in the voluntary production of\r\nlife’s primal material necessities: food, clothing, and shelter; in the\r\nconservation of the accumulated treasures of the past, and by favoring\r\nthe addition thereto of new contributions by this generation, so that\r\nthe total may be passed on intact to posterity. Any government is a\r\nfailure which neglects that duty; which if accomplished, and a proper\r\nattention given to education, virtue and morality will take care of\r\nthemselves. In the play of “Major Barbara,” one of Bernard Shaw’s best\r\nand most instructive comedies, the distinguished author shows the\r\ndifficulty, the almost impossibility of the reclamation by mere\r\nadmonition of a man degraded by pauperism; but that good wages regularly\r\npaid will do the job. Now, our present voting system not only fails to\r\nencourage thrift, saving or accumulation of wealth, or to promote\r\ncivilization, but has a contrary tendency, because it grants equality\r\nand power in government to the non-producer, to the shiftless, lazy and\r\nvicious consumers and wasters of property.\r\n\r\nIn order to fairly realize the gross injustice of granting governmental\r\npowers to the thriftless classes, we must clearly visualize and properly\r\nestimate the results of the lives and labors of the thrifty and\r\nindustrious. We must not fail to fully understand that frugality is the\r\ncreator and preserver of the State. We have recently heard frequent\r\nappeals to save and help win the German war; because to save is to\r\ncontribute to a fund out of which can be paid the expenses of the\r\ngovernment. But the common fund of the nation’s wealth in peace as well\r\nas in war exists and is drawn upon by every member of the community, and\r\nit is just as true in peace as in war that the citizen who saves money\r\nis thus contributing to that common fund and thereby to the strength\r\nand well-being of the commonwealth, and this, whether he deposit his\r\nsavings in a bank where it is loaned out to aid industry and create\r\nemployment, or whether he invests it in commerce or manufactures,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, by the purchase of stocks or securities in\r\nindustrial or commercial concerns. The mere fact of saving, that is to\r\nsay of producing more than he consumes makes him at once a contributor\r\nto this general fund; and therefore any man who leaves behind him upon\r\nhis death money or property which he accumulated in his lifetime has\r\nbeen a benefactor to the community, in the same sense as if he had\r\ncontributed a great book or a valuable invention to the world, or had\r\nspent his life in benevolent work. To save or to make money and then to\r\nusefully spend it in one’s lifetime, reaping the tribute of the world’s\r\nappreciation is well enough; but to frugally save for a long lifetime in\r\norder to do good or give pleasure to others after one’s eyes are closed\r\nin death is surely nobler still. All the useful productions of man in\r\nthe United States, the dwellings, stores, shops, ships, roads,\r\nrailroads, telegraphs and telephones; the schools, colleges, hospitals\r\nand church edifices; all the accumulated fuel and stores of manufactured\r\nand other goods, are the fruits of individual saving. The greatness and\r\npower of the United States depend upon the collected savings of\r\ngenerations gone by, and evidence their industry, prudence and\r\nself-denial. The class of Americans who have wasted their surplus or who\r\nhave produced no more than they earned; those devil-may-care fellows so\r\nadmired by sentimentalists, have been of no permanent material value to\r\nthe country; they are of the parasite class; they have no part in the\r\ncreation of its civilization which is represented by its acquisitions\r\nand depends upon them for its continuance. Many of these people give\r\nthemselves airs of virtue and generosity because they are not “mean” as\r\nthey say; they even brag that they spend as they go, and for that\r\nattitude toward life expect and sometimes receive applause from others\r\nas great fools as themselves. Their ignorance prevents their perceiving\r\ntheir own selfishness; and their vanity hides from them a suspicion of\r\ntheir worthlessness. The late Andrew Carnegie is credited with many\r\nsayings wise and foolish; of the latter one of the oftenest quoted is\r\nthat it is a disgrace to die rich. No proverb more mistaken and\r\nmischievous was ever uttered. For since no man, however much he made but\r\nmight have squandered it all, therefore to die rich implies some\r\nprudence and self denial, and usually means that the departed left the\r\nworld better off than he found it. The only anti-social rich are the\r\nland grabbers. All who have become capitalists by trade, production or\r\ninvention, or by efforts in aid thereof, are public benefactors.\r\n\r\nHere let us stop to pay a well-earned tribute to the past and present\r\nrank and file of the hard-working money savers of our country, above all\r\nto those of the past; to such of the departed ones and of the old\r\nsuperannuated fathers and mothers still feebly lingering among us, as\r\nhave lovingly toiled and scraped and saved to leave something to their\r\nchildren and their descendants. They are and have been among the best\r\nthe world produces, those honest, prudent, thrifty, self-denying\r\nAmericans, those brave old progenitors of ours, whose honest toil and\r\nstinting and close bargaining for generations past built up the wealth\r\nwhich makes so many of us comfortable and which enabled America to give\r\nGermany her solar plexus blow. May their memories be dear to their\r\ndescendants and be honored by all of us forever.\r\n\r\nWe hear much these days of “class consciousness”; of that feeling of\r\nsolidarity among the working classes which inclines the mechanic or\r\noperative to feel the needs of his fellow workers and to act with a view\r\nto their benefit, and this is well; but a little guiding thought is\r\nnever amiss in such matters, and will surely lead to a conclusion\r\nfavorable to a property qualification for voters. First, the workers\r\nshould remember that all good workmen are interested in the creation and\r\npreservation of capital. Their class consciousness should align them on\r\nthis question with those who produce and save. They should realize that\r\nimmense numbers of workingmen have savings bank accounts and other\r\nproperty and are therefore in the capitalistic class. Most of them have\r\nhopes and aspirations for still greater wealth, for in the United States\r\nand in other civilized countries where the ancient struggle for personal\r\nand religious liberty is over, the chief modern aspiration of all\r\nworkers is to create and preserve property, and thus to enjoy to the\r\nutmost the security and happiness which come with civilization and are\r\nexpressed in terms of property. They should also understand that all\r\ncapital is in a fund which is accessible to all, and that their best\r\ncontribution to the welfare of their brothers would be the increase of\r\nthis fund by their own wise thrift and saving. The savings bank is a\r\ngreat creator and preserver of property, and operates by a process which\r\nis vital to the existence of the unpropertied working man to an extent\r\nwhich he often fails to realize till the destruction of stored up\r\ncapital by Bolsheviki methods brings him to starvation’s verge. And\r\nwhile the property actually owned by the working man is usually much\r\nless in dollar value than that of almost any single capitalistic\r\nemployer of labor, or business men generally, yet its actual importance\r\nto him is as great or greater; and then the use by the working man of\r\nproperty not his own but accumulated by society, and its necessity to\r\nhis existence is usually almost as great and may be practically greater\r\nthan that of the rich man. The latter for instance may be an invalid or\r\nof sedentary habits, making but little direct use of mechanical forces;\r\nwhile the working man in question may be constantly and necessarily\r\nusing machinery, railroads, and other transportation facilities, etc.,\r\nin his daily employment to such a degree as to be absolutely dependent\r\non them for his existence. In the case of another worker his direct\r\npersonal use of food, clothing, furniture, household goods, books, etc.,\r\nmay be actually greater than that of his wealthy but more secluded or\r\nabstemious neighbor. Such a one whether or not he realizes it, is\r\nvitally interested in the preservation and maintenance of the property\r\nof others through the use of which he obtains his livelihood, or on\r\nwhich his comfort and happiness depend, and therefore that government\r\nshould be so organized as to protect that property.\r\n\r\nAs the thrift of the worker is the root of our material prosperity, so\r\nis the thrift of the rich its flower and choicest fruit. What would\r\nAmerica be, what would Europe be without the savings of the well-to-do,\r\naccumulated from generation to generation, and here now at our command\r\nand for our use manifested not only in railroads, ships, canals, banks\r\nand all the buildings and equipments of commerce and industry, but also\r\nin fine mansions, in elegant furniture, in beautiful lawns and gardens,\r\nin churches, cathedrals, hospitals, universities and museums? From out\r\nthe ranks of the opulent and thrifty classes, and especially of those of\r\nthem who have scorned waste, extravagance, dissipation and vulgar\r\ndisplay, came the leaders in the social army, the noble pioneers of\r\ntaste and beauty. We hear much canting laudation of the frontier\r\npioneers, a rough and coarse set mostly, of whom such as did their part\r\ndeserve the credit. But far more excellent and admirable are those to\r\nwhose zeal, enthusiastic taste and noble self-denial we owe most of the\r\npreserved and accumulated treasures of the earth in architecture,\r\npainting, sculpture and ornamentation. In every age, in every generation\r\nthey appear on the scene, little bands of modest amateurs, devoting\r\ntime, patience and money to rescuing these treasures from destruction,\r\nand to fostering, instructing and creating public taste for created\r\nbeauty. They seek and teach the best in life, leisure, refinement and\r\nloveliness; they introduce noble and graceful fashions in dress, manners\r\nand deportment and set fine examples to the world. The public museums\r\nand opera are endowed by their benefactions; they are the patrons of the\r\nbest music, the purest drama, and the most inspiring architecture. And\r\nnot merely to the cultivated very rich who are able to do so much, but\r\nalso to the refined of the more modest middle class is our gratitude due\r\nfor their leadership in this same direction. We see their tasteful\r\ncomfortable houses dotting the landscape; their good sidewalks, shady\r\nstreet trees, gardens and orchards delight the wayfarer. In improving\r\nthe public taste in the choice of furniture, or book bindings, of music\r\nand other things they are constantly helping along our civilization and\r\nforwarding the interests of the Social Commonwealth. They train their\r\nchildren so that they often become still more tasteful than their\r\nparents; they set an example of decent living to the poorer classes;\r\nthey beautify the land; they give the rest of us something to aspire to.\r\nAs we pass through a handsome well-kept American village let us give a\r\nthought of gratitude to the folk of all degrees of well-to-do, most of\r\nthem now dead and gone, who planted and built well, who dressed, talked\r\nand lived like gentlemen and ladies; who improved the life and manners\r\nof their time and left the world better housed, better mannered and\r\nbetter looking than they found it. Of such is the history of the\r\nnation’s progress. Like the great artists and authors, they each\r\ncontributed an offering to civilization; they left something of value\r\nbehind them to make them remembered, were it only a little well-built\r\nand well-designed house for someone to occupy after their departure.\r\nThough their names are never in the mouths of platform ranters, they are\r\namong the true patriots of America.\r\n\r\nThe manhood suffrage doctrine fails to recognize the vital political\r\ndifference heretofore referred to, originally pointed out by Sieyes,\r\nthat exists between the two classes of citizens; the one the faithful\r\nmembers of the social commonwealth; the progressive workers, loyal and\r\nactive in the promotion of civilization and in sustaining the state; and\r\nwho because of such civic activity, are accounted worthy of the\r\nsuffrage; the other the non-socials; the drones; the neutrals or\r\ndisloyal and therefore ineligible for political functions of any sort;\r\nnon-producers, shirkers, wasters, and destroyers. Sieyes, who was a\r\nstatesman, publicist and member of the French National Assembly in 1792,\r\nrecognized the existence of these two clearly separated classes of\r\ncitizens, and, by a statute proposed by him and subsequently enacted,\r\nall Frenchmen were divided accordingly into active citizens (_citoyens\r\nactifs_), having the right to vote and hold office, and passive citizens\r\n(_citoyens passifs_), who are excluded from both these privileges. It is\r\nnot just or fair that these latter, who are always behind the chariot of\r\nprogress, pulling backward and being carried or dragged along, impeding\r\nthe march of the race, should compel the progressive workers, the real\r\nactive citizens of the country, to expend a large part of their efforts\r\nin overcoming their resistance.\r\n\r\nConsider also the gross injustice and folly of inviting a large class\r\nwho have contributed nothing to the treasury of civilization to share in\r\nits management and control, even permitting them to mismanage, misuse\r\nand waste it. “That the tax eaters should not have absolute control over\r\nthe taxes to be expended by the tax payers would appear to be entirely\r\naxiomatic truth in political philosophy.... That this suffrage is a\r\nspear as well as a shield is a fact which many writers on suffrage leave\r\nout of sight.” (_Sterne, Const. History_, p. 270.) Those who made this\r\ncountry what it is are the thrifty workers, the successful business men.\r\nNow, is it asking too much to demand that the destiny of the country\r\nshould be placed in their hands? Is it fair that government should be\r\nput under the control of the wasteful and the foolish, that they may\r\nburden it with debt, and bond their thrifty fellow citizens and all\r\nfuture generations to pay off the obligations thus imposed upon the\r\nnation?\r\n\r\nA purely sentimental and therefore very popular argument against\r\nproperty qualification is that the rights and claims of humanity are\r\nseparate from and superior to those of property. This statement has\r\nreally nothing to do with the case, since it is not proposed to exclude\r\nhumanity from the polls, but merely to select for admission thereto a\r\nsuperior and more representative class. It is said by these\r\nsentimentalists that the rights of man are absolute and transcendent and\r\nmust first be satisfied, while those of property are inferior and may be\r\ndisregarded. This is on the absurd assumption that civilized man and\r\nhis property are separable and distinct forces; and that a conception of\r\ncivilized man without property is possible. And so we are assailed with\r\nthe catch phrase, popular with penny papers and platform ranters: “Man\r\nis superior to property.” This, like most catch phrases, is found, when\r\nexamined, to be rather empty. Man is superior to property just as the\r\nhead is superior to the stomach, as the fruit of the tree is superior to\r\nthe roots. But when the stomach is neglected the head dies; when the\r\nroot is not nourished the fruit perishes; the only way to preserve the\r\nhead is to feed the stomach; the only way to produce the fruit is to\r\nfertilize the roots. Man in a state of civilization cannot exist without\r\nproperty; if you sacrifice his property you sacrifice him. The imagined\r\ncomparison of the value of human life in its entirety with human\r\nproperty in the aggregate is absurd, it presents an impossible choice.\r\nHow, for instance, can you balance the value of human life against that\r\nof the New York Croton Aqueduct system which conserves the life of\r\nmillions? Carry out the notion that all property should be sacrificed\r\nrather than that one man should perish, and you have the spectacle of a\r\npeople without food, fire, clothes, shelter or medicines, whereof not\r\nmerely the one sacred man, but the whole lot would perish forthwith. On\r\nthe other hand, a comparison of the value of individual life with that\r\nof individual property depends on the character of the life and of the\r\nproperty referred to. Whatever we may pretend we do not practically\r\ntreat the life of a human being as such, say for instance, that of a\r\nsavage, as equivalent in value to the highest forms of property such as\r\nour great works of art, our great public works, or the material\r\nequipment necessary to our subsistence. It is probable that the\r\naggregate of the accumulated treasures of wealth and art which existed\r\nin Europe at the time of the discovery of America was worth to\r\ncivilization and to the moral and religious universe a million times\r\nmore than all the savage human life on the North American continent at\r\nthat time. To the existence of this accumulation of property and this\r\norganized society not only the well-to-do, but the most ignorant man,\r\nbe he ever so poor, owes whatever enjoyment he has in his daily life.\r\nThe little naked child is brought into the world by the aid of\r\nphysicians and nurses who have been trained in great institutions\r\nestablished and sustained by organized civilized society through the\r\nmedium of property accumulated by the men of years and generations past;\r\nand from his birth on, the child, whatever be his station, is clothed,\r\nfed, sheltered and nourished in sickness and in health; trained,\r\neducated, watched over and preserved as long as he lives, by the aid of\r\ninstitutions which were created and are maintained by Society through\r\nthe accumulation, the use and the application of property. The poorest\r\nindividual is more indebted to property accumulations and is more\r\ndependent upon them in time of need than the richest, because it is only\r\nfrom them that charities and benevolences of all kinds, outdoor relief,\r\nfree hospitals, dispensaries, schools, colleges and churches can be\r\nmaintained. Even Robinson Crusoe on his island would have perished had\r\nit not been for the use of such products of high civilization as he was\r\nable to save from the wreck.\r\n\r\nFollowing the argument founded on the justice of the case comes that\r\nbased upon the superior fitness of members of the propertied class for\r\nthe function of voters. This fitness is derived from the training which\r\nis incidental to the acquisition and care of property in the struggle\r\nfor life. The property qualification for voters is in effect an\r\neducational test, and far more effective than that of mere book\r\nlearning, which so often turns out to be quite insufficient as a\r\npreparation for the conduct of human affairs, and is equally\r\ninsufficient for the understanding of politics. There is an education in\r\nlife as well as in books and the education in life is the more valuable\r\nof the two. To have acquired and preserved property implies not only\r\nordinary school or theoretical education, but business training as well,\r\nand as government is mostly a business affair a property qualification\r\npresupposes a special preparatory course of training of the kind which\r\nis the best of all for the voter, and in addition such civic and\r\npolitical virtues as are necessary to success in business. “In politics,\r\nas elsewhere, only that which costs is valued. The industrial virtues\r\nimply self-denial, which prepares their possessors to wield political\r\npower; but pauperism raises a presumption of unfitness to share in\r\npolitical power. The person who cannot support himself has no moral\r\nclaim to rule one who can.” (Lalor’s _Cyclopedia_; _Suffrage_.)\r\n\r\nIt is the actual contact with, and the masterful control of the things\r\nof life that fits a man to give judgment on their force and value; and\r\nhis success therein is the test of his own capacity. In a very able and\r\ninstructive article on “The Basic Problem of Democracy” in the _Atlantic\r\nMonthly_ for November, 1919, written by Walter Lipman, he dwells upon\r\nthe proposition heretofore generally overlooked that what is most needed\r\nin our political system is some means of giving the electorate true\r\ninformation as to facts. He says:\r\n\r\n     “The cardinal fact always is the loss of contact with objective\r\n     information. Public as well as private reason depends upon it. Not\r\n     what somebody says, not what somebody wishes were true, but what is\r\n     so beyond all our opining, constitutes the touchstone of our\r\n     existence. And a society which lives at secondhand will commit\r\n     incredible follies and countenance inconceivable brutalities if\r\n     that contact is intermittent and untrustworthy. Demagoguery is a\r\n     parasite that flourishes where discrimination fails, and only those\r\n     who are at grips with things themselves are impervious to it. For,\r\n     in the last analysis, the demagogue, whether of the Right or the\r\n     Left, is, consciously or unconsciously, an undetected liar.”\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this argument the point here is that not only the\r\nmere rabble but the unpropertied and impecunious from any cause, either\r\nfrom lack of interest or of capacity, live at secondhand in their\r\nrelations to politics and are not themselves at “grips with things” and\r\ntherefore easily become the prey of the demagogue, the undetected liar.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of the property qualification test though not\r\nproperly appreciated has not been entirely overlooked by previous\r\nwriters. For example, Bagehot:\r\n\r\n     “Property indeed is a very imperfect test of intelligence; but it\r\n     is some test. If it has been inherited it guarantees education; if\r\n     acquired it guarantees ability; either way it assures us of\r\n     something. In all countries where anything has prevailed short of\r\n     manhood suffrage, the principal limitation has been founded on\r\n     criteria derived from property. And it is very important to observe\r\n     that there is a special appropriateness in this selection; property\r\n     has not only a certain connection with general intelligence, but it\r\n     has a peculiar connection with _political_ intelligence. It is a\r\n     great guide to a good judgment to have much to lose by a bad\r\n     judgment; generally speaking, the welfare of the country will be\r\n     most dear to those who are well off there.” (_Parliamentary\r\n     Reform_, p. 320.)\r\n\r\nBagehot, like most political writers and speakers, while recognizing the\r\neducative value to the voter of property ownership and management, fails\r\nto give sufficient importance to the effect of a business training. He\r\nelsewhere dwells upon the beneficial influence upon the voter of\r\nleisure, of education, of lofty pursuits, of cultivated society; but he\r\noverlooks the obvious fact that all good government is a business\r\nenterprise, and that a business training is essential to the instruction\r\nof the electorate. This oversight was perhaps natural for two reasons:\r\none the traditionary contempt in which all business was formerly held in\r\nEngland, and by the literary class everywhere. Dickens, for example, had\r\nnot the least idea of business capacity or of the intelligent life of\r\nthe business world of London, and Thackeray very little. Their business\r\nmen are of varying degrees of stupidity. The fact is that the world of\r\nart and letters has always been over conceited and inclined on\r\ninsufficient evidence to believe itself superior in intelligence to the\r\nworld of work and business. The other reason for the oversight referred\r\nto is that in former days business training was far less thorough and\r\nextended than it has since become and is today.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the case in days gone by, in our own time a\r\nbusiness training is necessary to enable a voter to make a proper choice\r\nof candidates for public office. The only way to secure competent\r\nofficials is through the demand of the electorate for capable men and by\r\nclose and intelligent scrutiny of the candidates. But this implies\r\ncapacity on the part of the voters to pass on the candidates’\r\nqualifications and to make a proper choice; in other words an electorate\r\nof trained minds, good judgment and knowledge of men. The voter needs\r\nnot only understanding of the merits of public controversies and\r\nknowledge of the published records of candidates for office but also\r\njudgment to weigh their qualities. And just as some knowledge of music\r\nis necessary to enable a listener to judge of the ability of a musician,\r\nso the voter who is to choose men for office having proper business\r\nqualifications should himself have had fundamental business training and\r\nexperience, and an educated sense of honesty and justice in such\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nFrom all which it appears that business and the professions furnish a\r\nschool of which all voters should be graduates. In this institution\r\nestablished by natural processes and everywhere in operation, citizens\r\nare being daily trained in prudence, foresight, self-denial, temperance,\r\nindustry, frugality, and the capacity to reason. There is a continuous\r\nand automatic exclusion of the unfit. First the worthless, very stupid,\r\ndefective, dishonest and lazy are eliminated. Either they refuse to\r\nenter, or from time to time as boys or young men they are rejected and\r\ndischarged as incompetent; weeded out, and their places taken by the\r\nmore competent. As years go on the more industrious, clear-headed,\r\nhonest and frugal of these surpass the others and achieve success in\r\nproportion as they display those qualities, together with good judgment\r\nand farsightedness; while meantime they establish and maintain families,\r\nraise children and acquire more or less property, all the while gaining\r\nin training and experience in the affairs of life. They become members\r\nof business firms, employers, superintendents, business managers, etc.\r\nIn agriculture they become successful farmers. In the professions they\r\nbecome known and established as reliable, and acquire and accumulate\r\nclients and patients, regular offices, books, equipment, furniture,\r\ntogether with some money or other property. In literature they write\r\nsuccessful books. In teaching they become principals and college\r\nprofessors. There you have them, trained and graduated in the school of\r\nlife’s affairs, the academy of evolution; a class of the fittest armed\r\nwith Nature’s own credentials, certifying them to be of proper stuff\r\nfrom which to build a safe foundation for the democratic State, and thus\r\nhas nature herself done the preparatory work of selecting material for\r\nan electorate by sifting out the inefficient, the non-social, the\r\npassive citizens; by separating and putting in plain sight the efficient\r\nmembers of the Social Commonwealth and stamping them with the seal of\r\ncompetency for active citizenship. So that a property qualification for\r\nvoters appears upon a proper consideration to be fit, appropriate,\r\npractical, effective and in accordance with natural law.\r\n\r\nExceptions there probably are, instances of men of good parts and\r\njudgment who through misadventure have been reduced to such poverty that\r\nthey would be debarred from voting under any fair property qualification\r\nrule. But the law cannot provide for such misfortunes any more than for\r\nunavoidable absence from the polls on election day. Such minor defaults\r\nwill not affect the desired result, which is the production of a class\r\nof reliable voters, and not merely a few exceptional ones.\r\n\r\nNot only property but the honest and intelligent desire for property\r\nshould be represented in the councils of the State. This aspiration has\r\nbeen stigmatized by twaddlers as an “appetite”; but an appetite is a\r\ngood thing; and essential to life. The desire for wealth is one of\r\nnature’s constructive forces and should be availed of by wise statesmen\r\nfor the purpose of nation building. Nothing is more offensive to the\r\nintelligent thinking man than to hear hypocritical demagogic ranters\r\ndenounce as “greed” the honest efforts of thrift to collect together a\r\ncompetence for old age, a provision for helpless children, or capital\r\nfor a business enterprise. Politicians and the impudent followers of\r\npoliticians, vile parasites on the body politic, scurvy knaves who have\r\nnever earned an honest hundred dollars in their lives, make a trade of\r\nthis kind of talk; preferring the business of flattering and cozening a\r\nconstituency of wooden heads and uncontrolled emotions to earning a\r\nliving honestly. The wish for property is a primal impulse like the love\r\nof life, the appetite for food and drink, and the desire for\r\nprocreation; it is in the nature of every healthy man; the want of it is\r\nabnormal and detracts from capacity for constructive state work. Those\r\nwho really lack it become in politics as dangerous as lunatics; they are\r\ndreamers, enthusiasts who ruin everything they control, such as were\r\nRobespierre and thousands of his followers. One would not trust one of\r\nthese crackbrains to build a house, let alone a nation. In private life\r\nthey are shiftless and burdensome on their friends and the public; in\r\nthe lower classes they are often known as loafers or deadbeats; some of\r\nthem become the “floaters” of politics, the cheap material for bandit\r\npolitical organizations. On the other hand this desire to create, to\r\nsave, to preserve and to perpetuate useful and beautiful things, is a\r\nnatural force which wise statesmen employ to the utmost in the service\r\nof the State; whose development they encourage in civics, in private\r\nlife, in politics and in government, and which found in the character of\r\nthe individual should be accorded its proper and legitimate, sane and\r\nsteadying influence.\r\n\r\nThe possession of property is also a necessary qualification of a voter\r\nbecause it renders him pecuniarily independent. The voter in a democracy\r\nshould be so situated as to be free from the need of yielding to the\r\ntemptation of a bribe, either in the shape of cash or the salary\r\nattached to a small office. We pay judges large salaries, to lift them\r\nabove the atmosphere of temptation. The voter is a judge, called upon to\r\npass judgment upon the candidates whose names are on the ballot. That\r\nthe verdict of the polls upon these candidates for office should be\r\nrendered by paupers, by men whose means do not enable them to vote with\r\nindependence, is monstrous. The shelter of secrecy afforded by the\r\nAustralian ballot is no answer to this objection. The purchased voter is\r\ncorrupted before he enters the booth; his soul is degraded as soon as he\r\nresolves to take the bribe. Why should he be false to his bargain?\r\nSurely not for patriotism or virtue, for the act of betraying his\r\npurchaser would not cleanse him; it would only prove him doubly\r\nrecreant. To say that the elector besides being venal will perhaps\r\nbecome a perjured traitor is a poor plea for his admission to the\r\nsuffrage. And yet, the tendency of manhood suffrage being forever\r\ndownward is towards pauper voting. A New York newspaper of March 5,\r\n1919, recorded that Lady Astor, a candidate for Parliament in Plymouth,\r\nEngland, had just visited the almshouses there in making her canvass for\r\nvotes. In the short time England has been afflicted with an\r\napproximation to universal suffrage, this much has been accomplished. If\r\nit be right, it should go on, and great England’s Parliament, renowned\r\nfor six centuries as the mother of all free representative assemblies,\r\nshould become a club of chattering women, sent there by paupers and\r\nvagabonds. America should face the other way. In its political life it\r\nhas no need for women nor for flabby and inefficient men; it needs\r\nhonesty, frugality, virile force, courage and efficiency; it needs a\r\nconstructive and conservative spirit to replace the reckless and\r\nwasteful temper now so prevalent. The electorate should include only\r\nactive citizens, only those who have made good; the governmental state\r\nshould correspond to the social state, representing not only the working\r\nand thrifty people, but their works, their homes, their property and\r\ntheir civilization.\r\n\r\nThe democratic advance thus proposed is a movement onward and upward to\r\nbetter things. The manhood suffrage movement was downward. In the next\r\nand succeeding chapters the reader will find briefly sketched some\r\naccount of that descending progress into and through the muck of\r\nignorance and corruption for the past one hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND FIRST APPEARANCE OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE AS PART OF THE FRENCH\r\nTERRORIST MACHINERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first national legislature to be elected by manhood suffrage without\r\ndistinctions or qualifications was the notorious red radical French\r\nConvention which met at Paris, September 20th, 1792. It is that body\r\nwhich has the infamous celebrity of establishing and prosecuting the\r\nbloody tyranny known as the Terror, under which tens of thousands of\r\ninnocent men and women of France were put to death because of their\r\nsupposed political opinions. Though manhood suffrage may not be entirely\r\nand solely responsible for the excesses of the convention, yet it is\r\nsafe to say that it helped create the machinery for the perpetration of\r\nthe crimes and follies of the Terror; and that none of these excesses\r\nwould have been committed by a body selected by a fairly qualified\r\nelectorate. All that was good in the French Revolution was accomplished\r\nthrough a propertied electorate; and all that was worst was done under a\r\nmanhood suffrage régime.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution began in 1789 as a peaceable and rational reform\r\nmovement. None of the writings of Rousseau which did so much to prepare\r\nthe way for the great change had directly discussed the suffrage\r\nquestion. The French National Assembly which met in May, 1789, at\r\nVersailles, was a sane and dignified body, chosen by a qualified\r\nelectorate, and there was in its deliberations no mention and in its\r\nmembership probably no thought of universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThere was never any necessity for physical violence or revolution in\r\norder to secure the attainment of all such political reforms as even\r\nfrom the most liberal standpoint were needed by France at that time.\r\nThe government like all other governments of that day was ignorant of\r\neconomic laws, and the people had suffered under inequalities in rank\r\nand privilege, and an antiquated and inadequate financial system; but\r\nthe king and the nobility were pacifist, and in the main humanitarian\r\nand inclined to liberal measures. Within three months after the Assembly\r\nconvened, the nobility in open meeting voluntarily surrendered their\r\nhistoric privileges. At that same session of 1789 the Assembly undertook\r\na number of reforms and the re-establishment of France upon a firm\r\nconstitutional and conservative basis with proper security for all\r\nclasses. Had the revolutionary movement stopped there, and the better\r\nclasses been permitted to carry out their intelligent schemes, France,\r\nunder a constitutional monarchy, would have embarked upon a new career\r\nof prosperity, and the wars which have since devastated her would\r\nprobably have been avoided. But the Radicals got the upper hand; on\r\npretence of remedying the embarrassments arising from poor harvests and\r\nbad financiering they established universal suffrage and the rule of the\r\nrabble, which increased the miseries of the French people five fold, and\r\nspeedily evolved the Terror and precipitated the ruin of the nation. A\r\ngreat many, perhaps most, of these radicals were men of little\r\nexperience, governed by mere sentiment and passion; others, who\r\nultimately became the working majority were men of low moral character\r\nand defective reasoning powers; lacking in principle; demagogues and\r\nadventurers; cranks and scoundrels, who, claiming to be the champions of\r\nan ideal democracy, found it to their advantage to spout balderdash with\r\nwhich to gain the applause of the ignorant and emotional masses. Their\r\nstupidities, antics, vagaries, thefts, and other minor rascalities and\r\nfollies; their guillotinings, drownings, arsons, street slaughters and\r\nother butcheries and outrages; their confiscations and banishments are\r\nmatters of history, and have to some extent been duplicated by the\r\nBolsheviki rabble in Russia in our own day. To the tune of crazy cries\r\nfor liberty and more liberty, they attacked property, vested rights,\r\ncommerce, business, the church and the Christian religion, and plunged\r\nFrance into chaos. They murdered and outlawed her nobility and her\r\npriests, besides tens of thousands of innocent people who were neither\r\npriests nor nobles, including farmers, artisans, tradesmen, poets,\r\nartists and professional men, the best of the land. Under the first\r\nRepublic, it is computed that a million French died of famine and\r\nhardship, the direct result of Radical legislation and Radical tyranny,\r\nand chargeable to a great extent to the operation of manhood suffrage.\r\nNor is this the total record of their mischief. Their misdeeds produced\r\na violent reaction which resulted in the placing on the French throne of\r\nBonaparte, whose ambitions deluged Europe with blood. A generation later\r\nhe was followed by another Bonaparte, equally a result (though less\r\ndirectly) of the Revolution; and he plunged France into a war with\r\nGermany, which in 1871 cost her the loss of Alsace and Lorraine and out\r\nof which the recent great war of 1914 was born.\r\n\r\nFrance therefore has never yet recovered from the injuries she suffered\r\nat the hands of the red radicals in the first Revolution. She may thank\r\nuniversal suffrage and the extremists of that time not only for the\r\ndepopulation and misery inflicted upon her by the so-called republic\r\nfrom 1789 to 1798, and by the Napoleonic wars from 1798 to 1815, but\r\nalso for the loss of Alsace and Lorraine in 1871, for four invasions of\r\nher soil, for her recent sufferings from 1914 to 1918 and her reduction\r\nfrom the first rank to the third among the powers of Europe. In short,\r\nshe has paid one hundred and thirty years of torment for the privilege\r\nof listening to the rhodomontade and vaporings of crackbrains and\r\ndemagogues. Let America take warning.\r\n\r\nRight here seems to be a good place to make a cheerful contrast to the\r\nforegoing by comparing the radical French convention of 1792 with the\r\nconservative French Assembly of 1871. It was after Germany had triumphed\r\nover Napoleon III, that clay idol of the French populace; he was in\r\nexile, the empire was at an end, the army was destroyed, and France was\r\nwithout resources, credit, friends or prestige. She had to form a new\r\ngovernment and try to re-establish herself as a nation, to raise five\r\nthousand millions of francs and to get the invader from her soil. The\r\nelections were had for a new National Assembly; the manhood of France\r\nwent to the polls, but with sad and serious faces. All the frivolity and\r\nhumbug of politics had disappeared. The masses were poor and hungry; the\r\nGermans were at Paris; the Commune was threatening the national\r\nexistence. It was a time for the people to turn to the genuine patriots,\r\nthe real leaders of men, the competent, the capable, the reliable. Did\r\nthey go to the demagogues, the orators, the enthusiastic ranters, the\r\nultra-radicals, the theorists, the politicians, the inspired\r\nblatherskites whose froth and flattery are so much to the taste of the\r\npopulace? No, indeed. The fear of death being upon them, the masses\r\nbethought them seriously, and for once refrained from making fools of\r\nthemselves at an election. The poorer classes, the peasants, the\r\nworkingmen, turned eagerly and fearfully to the solid men among their\r\nneighbors for counsel and advice and followed it. Needless to say, the\r\nnew Assembly was the most able, intelligent, honest and conservative\r\nlegislature poor France had seen for many a day. It was composed of men\r\nof experience, property, education, integrity and reputation; men who\r\nwere noted champions of society and of civilization. As soon as the\r\nworld heard what France had done at her elections, the joyful word was\r\npassed along, “France is saved,” and saved she was from that day.\r\nConfidence was restored, the Commune was suppressed with a strong and\r\nvigorous hand; public and private credit was re-established; the\r\nPrussian enemy was paid off and his troops withdrawn; industry revived,\r\nplenty came again, and France once more took her place among the\r\nnations. It would be an insult to the reader’s intelligence to proceed\r\nto point the moral of this notable incident in the political history of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe red radicals of the French revolution claimed to believe, and as\r\nthey were a shallow lot, some of them probably did believe as the masses\r\nhere believe today, that pure manhood suffrage is a development of the\r\nprinciple of equality. But they were fundamentally wrong, they were in\r\nconflict with nature’s laws, which cannot be trifled with. As equality\r\nof power or capacity does not exist in nature, all that can rightly be\r\nclaimed in that direction is equality of opportunity, which includes\r\nrecognition of the superior claims of merit and capacity, and therefore\r\ninvolves the divine principle of inequality of achievement. This the\r\nFrench radical revolutionary leaders failed to perceive. For instance,\r\nthey objected to the old aristocratic régime because it was not founded\r\non merit, and because its offices were allotted to influence without\r\nreference to qualifications; they wanted as they said “_La carriere\r\nouverte aux talents_”; a career for talent, a very commendable object.\r\nBut the operation of manhood suffrage is just the reverse of this; it\r\ndenies the opportunity and the reward due to merit, to talent, to study,\r\nto diligence, to education. As far as possible it gives to ignorance and\r\nnegligence the same weight and power as to intelligence and assiduity.\r\nTo give power to electors unqualified by education or experience to\r\noverrule the wishes of the educated and experienced on political\r\nquestions is to ignore merit and qualification, and that at the very\r\nfoundation of government. But while the best thinkers of the French\r\nreform party at that time saw this plainly, the radical leaders\r\noverruled them, because what they wanted was a rabble constituency,\r\nsince none other would give power to such a gang of fools and ruffians\r\nas they.\r\n\r\nThe world has made great progress in well-being in the last one hundred\r\nand thirty years, a progress due almost entirely to its inventors and\r\ndiscoverers and to the industry and frugality of its workers; and France\r\nhas shared in that prosperity; but her miseries and misfortunes have\r\nalso been great, and these were nearly all political, and due to one\r\ncause, the operation of manhood suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n     IMPORTANT INFLUENCE OF FRENCH RED RADICALISM IN PROPAGATING THE\r\n     MANHOOD SUFFRAGE DOCTRINE IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of manhood suffrage was imported to America from France in\r\nthe latter part of the eighteenth century, and began to infect American\r\npolitics some twenty years after the Independence, though its final\r\ntriumph was delayed another score of years. To some of us it seems\r\nalmost incredible that any honest man could avoid being strongly\r\nprejudiced against a political institution which had produced such\r\nhorrible results as manhood suffrage in France, and it would probably\r\ntoday be but a poor recommendation of any political scheme to an\r\nintelligent man that it was adopted by the French Revolutionary\r\nConvention of 1792. But a century ago the masses in the United States\r\nwere not thinkers, and were even more inclined to be carried away by\r\nemotional crazes than they are at present; no doubt the success of the\r\nAmerican Revolution had turned many heads. It was a time when young\r\ngentlemen were much afflicted by morbid sentimentality; when ladies did\r\nnot fail to faint on proper occasion; when American gentlemen fought\r\nduels because of sham sentiment or to sustain a sham honor; when\r\nblood-curdling novels were devoured with gusto; when Byron’s all-defying\r\npirate heroes were the rage; when young clerks went about gloomily\r\nbrooding in turned-down collars and imagining that the whole world\r\nconsisted of oppressors and the oppressed. To such a romantic and\r\nsuperficial young America the platitudes and empty sentimentalities of\r\nthe French Radicals made a stronger appeal than the plain common sense\r\ntalk of the British Tories. Besides all this a large part of the\r\nAmerican people at the close of the American Revolution in 1783 were\r\ndeeply grateful to the French nation for its timely and effective\r\nassistance in the war for Independence. Without French aid, it was\r\nthought that the revolt might have failed, and of course they did not\r\nstop to reflect that Lafayette and Rochambeau were noblemen; that it was\r\na French monarchy and not a republic which had been so helpful to\r\nAmerica. And so when a few years later France became a Republic, largely\r\nowing, it was thought, to American influence and example, there was\r\ngreat enthusiasm in many American hearts for France and everything\r\nFrench, including the new political theories of the Rights of Man,\r\nLiberty, Equality and Fraternity. Even the Terrorists for a time had\r\ntheir sympathizers here, some of whom probably were unaware of the facts\r\nas the newspaper accounts of doings abroad were meagre and distorted.\r\nThe French partisans here even believed and circulated slanders against\r\nthe noble and spotless Washington. It is easy to believe interesting\r\nlies. Did not our fellow Americans in the South work themselves up in\r\n1860 to a silly belief that they were or were about to be plundered and\r\noppressed by the perfectly harmless rest of us? Did not the English and\r\nFrench make themselves believe and declare in January, 1865, that the\r\nSouthern States were on the eve of final victory when they were\r\nobviously tottering to a final fall? Have not we Americans to the last\r\ndeluded man of us gone about for the past century believing and swearing\r\nthat we won a signal triumph in the war of 1812 and refusing to credit\r\nour own officers and historians to the contrary? How many Americans\r\nfailed to go wrong in their sympathies at the beginning of the last\r\nRussian revolution? The American radicals therefore probably chose to\r\nbelieve that Marat, Robespierre, Danton and Co., instead of being\r\nhumbugs, blackguards and miscreants, were wise and honest republicans,\r\nwhose massacres of harmless prisoners and other similar performances\r\nwere excusable ebullitions of patriotic zeal. When for instance the news\r\nof the defeat of Brunswick by Dumouriez came to America in December,\r\n1792, there were great rejoicings among them. There were dinners,\r\nsuppers, speeches, cannon firing and processions in New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston, and other cities. The inns and taverns were filled\r\nwith those whose heads were turned by liquor and enthusiasm; some\r\nwearing liberty caps and cockades; all singing, shouting and drinking\r\ntoasts. On December 27th in New York City the whole day was given up to\r\npublic rejoicing, including a celebration by the Tammany Society.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of imitation is strong, especially among children, savages\r\nand the lower classes. We had been imitating the British; we now took to\r\nimitating the French. Everything French was popular; became the rage.\r\nWhen the French Minister Genet, representing the Terrorist government,\r\narrived here in April, 1793, he landed at Charleston, whence he\r\nproceeded to Philadelphia, the seat of the Federal Government. He really\r\nrepresented a band of blood-stained scoundrels who had usurped power in\r\nFrance, who had just guillotined the king and most of whom were for\r\nsale, yet he was hailed by a faction here as a hero and the emissary of\r\nsages and patriots. There were receptions, escorts, processions and\r\nbanquets, where “Citizen” Genet was glorified, our own government was\r\ndenounced, and an American reign of terror threatened. At some of the\r\nbanquets a red liberty cap was displayed; half drunken young American\r\nradicals danced about the table; the guillotine was toasted, and\r\ncapitalists were threatened with death. At that time England, outraged\r\nand disgusted by the insults and bloody rapine of the French Terrorist\r\ngovernment, had gone to war with France; our howling mobs therefore\r\nyelled for war with England, and mouthing politicians who had never\r\nsmelt gunpowder pretended to be eager to fight Great Britain, although\r\nwe had neither army, navy, transports nor money. Two American privateers\r\nwere actually fitted out to sail under French colors and prey on English\r\ncommerce in defiance of the law and of the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nMeantime the American friends and enemies of the French Revolution\r\ntaunted and vilified each other in newspapers, pamphlets, and otherwise\r\npublicly and privately. Some of the American featherheads, in imitation\r\nof the antics of the French Republicans, addressed each other as\r\n“citizen” and “citess,” instead of Mr. and Mrs. this and that. Serious\r\nand sensible folk, including President Washington, looked askance at\r\nthese follies, and by many they were treated with the ridicule they\r\ndeserved. The rabble thereupon after their nature and in further\r\nimitation of the French democracy which they so admired, revenged\r\nthemselves by flinging coarse insults at their unsympathetic fellow\r\ncitizens, including Washington himself. In about three years’ time this\r\nwild craze passed away; but French influence continued. French dancing\r\nschools, fencing schools, dishes, names, expressions, customs, dress,\r\nmusic, and books were popular; French newspapers were published in all\r\nimportant cities, and some permanent progress was made by French\r\nRevolutionary influence and ideas.\r\n\r\nWe may here note that after the death of Robespierre and the overthrow\r\nof the Terror and on September 23rd, 1795, after a test of over three\r\nyears, manhood suffrage was abolished in France almost without a\r\nprotest. It was unanimously recognized that it was responsible for the\r\nTerror, for the disorder and insecurity of life and property which had\r\nprevailed since its adoption and for the complete financial and economic\r\nprostration of France, whose people were starving by thousands for need\r\nof that social order and confidence without which modern civilization is\r\nimpossible. In the official report on the subject presented to the\r\nNational Convention in 1795, and which was adopted after full\r\ndiscussion, we read these words: “We ought to be governed by the best;\r\nthe best are the most highly educated, and those most interested in the\r\nmaintenance of the laws. Now with very few exceptions you will only find\r\nsuch men among those who, possessing a freehold, are attached to the\r\ncountry which contains it, the laws which protect it, and the\r\ntranquillity which preserves it, and who owe to their property and their\r\naffluence the education which has fitted them to discuss with justice\r\nand understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the laws which\r\ndetermine the fate of their country.... A country governed by\r\nfreeholders is in a social condition; a country in which the\r\nnon-proprietors govern is in a state of nature.” Unfortunately the\r\nmischief that had been already done by the radicals has never been quite\r\ncured, and France has suffered many things since then; but that is\r\nanother story. The extreme French Radicals did not for all this abandon\r\ntheir attachment to their revolutionary ideas; their influence in the\r\nUnited States continued to be very considerable, and the rapid spread of\r\nthe new-fangled doctrine of manhood suffrage in the young American\r\nstates after the death of Washington had removed his conservative\r\ninfluence was no doubt largely due to the effect of the plausible\r\nranting and twaddle of the French Revolutionists and their followers.\r\n\r\nEverything has to be paid for in this world, and for the help of France\r\nin the fight for independence, the United States had something to pay in\r\nthe corruption, waste and deterioration caused by the adoption of the\r\nsilly theory of the French radicals that in governmental matters one\r\nman’s judgment and intent are as good as another’s, those of the\r\nignorant and thriftless equal to those of the frugal, industrious and\r\nwell-informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n     THE SAFEGUARD OF A PROPERTY QUALIFICATION FOR VOTERS WAS DISCARDED\r\n     BY A GENERATION OF AMERICANS WHO DID NOT REALIZE ITS VALUE OR THE\r\n     DANGERS ATTENDANT UPON UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the adoption of the system of manhood suffrage by\r\nstate after state a century ago are not such as to justify us of today\r\nin according much authority to their determination. The movement was one\r\nof weakness, ignorance and degeneracy, not part of an effort to further\r\nachieve the highest ideals of republican theories, but a reactionary\r\nyielding to cheap, selfish and opportunist politics. It was successful\r\nbecause the mass of the American people lacked both the experience and\r\nthe foresight necessary to enable them to realize the probably fatal\r\nresult of the proposed change.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted that following the establishment of the Federal\r\nGovernment in 1789, though the upper and educated classes, especially in\r\nthe older American states, did not display much enthusiasm for French\r\nradical political ideas, and though Washington and the propertied class\r\nwere openly hostile to them, they were acclaimed by the working classes,\r\nthe poor farmers, the immigrants, and many of the romantic youths of the\r\ncountry; and were partly adopted by Jefferson and such others as like\r\nhim were somewhat under French influence. We may add to the influences\r\nfavoring manhood suffrage in the old and populous states that of the\r\nresident foreigners, which was considerable. It would be a mistake to\r\nsuppose that at this early period there had been little immigration to\r\nthis country. The fact is that the proportion of immigrants to the whole\r\npopulation was then probably greater than at any subsequent time; the\r\nforeign element at the time of the independence, including British and\r\nIrish, Germans, Dutch, Swedes and French, probably amounting to about\r\none-third of the entire population. Another class of people who\r\nunquestioningly accepted the doctrine of manhood suffrage was that of\r\nthe frontiersmen or pioneer western settlers. It is the fashion in these\r\ndays to hail every political novelty as an “advance,” and accordingly\r\nthe twaddlers, including writers of that ilk, tell us unctuously that\r\nthe adoption of manhood suffrage was part of the “advance” of\r\ncivilization. The truth is, however, that it was not the fruit of an\r\nimproved civilization, but was first adopted when and where the\r\npopulation was coarse, rough and unlettered. In the new and sparsely\r\nsettled states, New Hampshire, Vermont, Kentucky, Georgia, Tennessee and\r\nOhio, the principle of manhood suffrage was accepted almost as a matter\r\nof course and without any serious discussion. In those states there was\r\nat that time an approximation to practical equality among the\r\ninhabitants both in property and intelligence, the standard of both\r\nbeing low; political problems were simple and primitive; and an equal\r\nshare in government to all men seemed natural and reasonable. There was\r\nbut little property except land which was plenty and cheap; farming was\r\nthe principal occupation; and the farmer was confined to the home market\r\nthere being no railroads to carry his produce to distant places. The\r\ngreat differences between rich and poor existing in older communities\r\nwere not present; none of the conditions which render manhood suffrage\r\nso objectionable in large cities were found in these new states. When\r\nGeorgia adopted a low qualification in 1789 her population was less than\r\ntwo to the square mile; when Vermont entered the Union she had less than\r\nten to the square mile; Kentucky had two; Ohio one; Tennessee two. There\r\nmust have seemed little reason in attempting to create distinctions in\r\nrude and primitive communities where none actually existed.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration operating to lower the suffrage was the\r\ncompetition among the new states to get settlers on any terms. Nearly\r\nall of those who had land in the newer states had more than they could\r\nuse and were not only very anxious to sell some of it, but to get new\r\nneighbors on any terms, since each new arrival measurably increased the\r\nvalue of their holdings. One of the baits to induce immigration was the\r\nright to vote and hold office offered to all new comers. Even in our own\r\nday a number of western states permit aliens to vote as an inducement to\r\nsettle in their limits, and we have had in the last few years the\r\ncurious spectacle of unnaturalized and presumably hostile Germans voting\r\nat elections. The right to vote was highly valued in those early\r\ncommunities, where fortunes were not easily made, and where political\r\npreferment was much sought after as the most available road to\r\ndistinction. To close that avenue to ambition was to discourage new\r\nsettlers. It was therefore inevitable that such of the original thirteen\r\nas were sparsely settled states with populations composed partly of\r\nfrontiersmen, and also all the new states as they came in one by one,\r\nshould be willing to waive property qualifications for voters. And thus\r\nit was that in 1789 Georgia reduced her suffrage qualification to a\r\nsmall annual tax requirement; that in 1791 Vermont and in 1792 Kentucky\r\ncame into the Union under manhood suffrage constitutions; that in 1792\r\nNew Hampshire adopted manhood suffrage; that in 1803 Ohio entered with a\r\nminimum tax qualification and that Indiana in 1816, Illinois in 1818 and\r\nMissouri in 1820 were admitted as manhood suffrage states, while some of\r\nthe others, such as Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana, merely\r\nprescribed tax qualifications which were far from onerous.\r\n\r\nIn the older states the advance of the manhood suffrage movement was\r\naided by the influences already referred to; by the French Revolutionary\r\nparty, including many foreigners; the city laboring classes, the\r\nthriftless and discontented, and the restless horde of theorists,\r\ndreamers, penny-a-liners, political adventurers, demagogues, agitators,\r\nradicals of every stripe, and many of that numerous class who had more\r\nfacility in talking than in thinking. There is even yet among people of\r\nsmall intelligence a widespread belief in the miraculous efficiency of\r\nvoting; and that belief is no doubt accountable for some of the\r\neagerness with which the suffrage was demanded by superficial men who\r\nthought to better their condition by politics, and who, though plainly\r\nlacking in efficiency, unable even to get together a few hundred dollars\r\nin property to qualify them as voters, nevertheless rated high their own\r\ncapacity to decide problems of state. We may add to this as helping the\r\nmovement the plausibility to shallow minds of the assertion that all men\r\nare equal; and the prestige given it by its being quite unnecessarily\r\nput by Jefferson into the Declaration of Independence. Another cause\r\nwhich has been said to have contributed, was the severe financial panic\r\nof 1819 which brought widespread distress and consequent discontent with\r\nthings as they were. Why not try a change? is an argument which has more\r\nor less success at every election. Then too the American easy good\r\nnature and hospitality of character must have helped along; that\r\nsoftness which makes many dislike to refuse a boon which will not cost\r\nanything in cash or its equivalent. It must have seemed to many men easy\r\nand pleasant to vote to allow their neighbors to vote, especially when\r\nto a dull man the reasons to the contrary were not altogether obvious.\r\n\r\nNor is it altogether strange that even in New York and Massachusetts few\r\nexcept the best trained minds had any real understanding of the dangers\r\nof letting in the ignorant and the thriftless classes to a voice in\r\ngovernment. The American people had no experience of a political machine\r\nor of demagogues in power, and to most of them the operation of\r\ngovernment seemed comparatively simple and within easy comprehension.\r\nEven in the old states the population was mostly rural; there were no\r\nrailroads or telegraphs, comparatively little machinery, and none\r\noperated by steam. The property of the country consisted of houses,\r\nlands, farms, cattle and sheep; living was very plain, and the expenses\r\nof government comparatively small. Life was not then the complicated\r\naffair that it is at present, specialization was rare, efficiency in any\r\nbranch of business was not near so difficult to achieve as it has since\r\nbecome. Under the election system then in practice, and following the\r\nold colonial traditions then still extant, the candidates for office had\r\nusually been men of distinction whose reputations were well known in the\r\ncommunity, and who were personally known at least by sight and speech to\r\nmost of the voters. The people had had no real experience of government\r\nby election in large constituencies. There were few large cities, the\r\nlargest in 1820 being New York, with a population of 125,000, while\r\nPhiladelphia had but 65,000 and Boston 45,000 population. Probably it\r\nwas comparatively safe in most urban communities to leave the street\r\ndoor unguarded at night, a practice scarcely recommendable in New York\r\nor Chicago in these times. Their governors had previously either been\r\nsent from England or chosen by their state legislatures, and their high\r\nstate officials had been appointed by the crown, the governor, the\r\nproprietor or the legislature. Their only real experience with the\r\nsuffrage had been in small local elections, parishes, boroughs and\r\ntowns, where the prizes of office were small and everyone knew his\r\nneighbor. Most of the voters were substantial American farmers and\r\ntradesmen, who anticipated as the result of the granting of manhood\r\nsuffrage nothing worse than that the roll of new voters would include\r\ntheir own sons, the village schoolmaster, together with a few poor\r\nartisans and farm hands who had no class prejudices, who could be\r\ndepended upon to vote with their well-to-do neighbors, and whose numbers\r\nwere not sufficient to seriously affect election results.\r\n\r\nTo the extent to which the manhood suffrage movement was conscious of\r\nits own tendencies, it was a revolt led by political adventurers against\r\ngovernment by the intelligence of the country, and above all and beyond\r\nall the forces operating in furtherance of the movement for manhood\r\nsuffrage in the older states was the new influence of the politicians\r\nand political office seekers, who by 1820 began, though in a\r\ncomparatively small way, to appear as a real political power in the\r\nland. Though many of our ancestors early distrusted and later learned to\r\nhate and despise the politicians, the people have never organized to\r\noppose them and in the beginning failed to realize the insidious growth\r\nof their sway. The politicians then as now clamored for an extended\r\nelectorate, the more ignorant, simple, emotional and easily influenced\r\nthe better. They welcomed the uninstructed male vote of that day for the\r\nsame reason that they welcome the still more ignorant female vote of\r\nthis day. The ears of the masses were open to them because they could\r\ntalk and bellow the political cant and jargon in which the rabble\r\ndelight. Then as now they wanted all the offices made elective; suffrage\r\nfor everybody, even aliens, and especially the ignorant and shiftless;\r\nand they kept up their efforts in the old states until the bars were let\r\ndown, and every man had a vote.\r\n\r\nMost of the old populous states began the change by lowering the\r\nqualification, changing it from the actual ownership of property to the\r\npayment of a tax, usually a small one, sometimes merely nominal.\r\nPennsylvania, a state tainted with French radical sympathies, had\r\nalready reduced the qualification to the payment of a state or county\r\ntax; this standard was adopted by Delaware in 1792. In 1809 Maryland\r\nadopted manhood suffrage. In 1810 South Carolina and in 1819 Connecticut\r\nreduced the qualification to an almost nominal tax rate. In 1829\r\nVirginia reduced the property requirement and finally abolished it in\r\n1850. New Jersey held out till 1844.\r\n\r\nThe great battles, however, and those which finally decided the\r\ncontroversy in the United States were fought in Massachusetts and in New\r\nYork in 1820 and 1821, though in both states the success of the manhood\r\nsuffrage party was a foregone conclusion before the final test was made.\r\nThe situation was much the same as it has since been in relation to\r\nwoman suffrage. As long as woman suffrage partisans had no votes\r\nanywhere the politicians gave them but scant courtesy. Even after they\r\ngained one or two states they were not much considered. But as soon as\r\nthey had four or five states to their credit the politicians began to\r\nflock to their standard; the weaker and more unscrupulous going over\r\nfirst. The reason is plain. Every politician of note has his eye on the\r\npresidency either for himself or for his leader and his party. Under our\r\nsystem where the presidential vote is by states a single state may turn\r\nthe election, and a woman suffrage state as well as another. Mr. Wilson\r\nfor instance and Mr. Roosevelt, though on opposite sides on everything\r\nelse, were united in patriotism, in burning desire for office and in\r\ndevotion to democracy. Of course they both became champions of woman\r\nsuffrage just as soon as a few states had been captured by the women and\r\nalso of course their party followers took their cue accordingly. So it\r\nundoubtedly was in 1820. By that time there were nine new states west of\r\nthe Alleghany Mountains. When it was seen that in all these new states\r\nmanhood suffrage was in vogue, no presidential possibility dared oppose\r\nmanhood suffrage anywhere, nor dared his followers differ from him on\r\nthis point. It was a rush to get on the band wagon. And why should the\r\nprofessional politicians oppose a measure so obviously in their interest\r\nas a degradation of the ballot? Naturally therefore, in the New York\r\nConstitutional Convention of 1821 we had Martin Van Buren, a Jackson\r\npolitician, leading the battle for extension of the suffrage and\r\ncarrying all before him.\r\n\r\nOne naturally turns for enlightenment on the merits of the question to\r\nthe records giving the arguments used pro and con in the discussions on\r\nthe suffrage extension propositions of that time, but they are more\r\ninteresting than important, because the debaters lacked the light of\r\nmodern experience. Our political bosses and machines had not yet\r\narrived, and America had then no immense populations of millions\r\naccustomed to live on daily wages, lacking the slightest knowledge of\r\nthe principles or practical operation of finance, banking, trade and\r\ncommerce; ignorant of the very elements of political economy, and yet\r\nready to vote on all these matters under the direction of demagogues,\r\nthemselves in the employ of bosses and machines. There were then no such\r\ndivisions of classes as now; no large criminal and pauper population; no\r\nmasses of foreigners herded together in tenement house life and ignorant\r\nof our problems and conditions. Our ancestors of a century ago were not\r\ngifted with imagination or prevision sufficient to enable them to\r\nforesee the enormous future immigration from Europe; the factory and\r\ntenement house systems; the vote market; the absolute and corrupt\r\noligarchy of politicians, the political ring, machine and boss. Had they\r\nbeen gifted with this foresight it is safe to say that instead of\r\nlowering the suffrage qualifications they would have put the bars up so\r\nhigh that the disgraceful record of American politics for the last\r\neighty years would never have been made.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts the Convention included as members, John Adams,\r\nWebster, Judge Joseph Story of the United States Supreme Court, Samuel\r\nHoar and Josiah Quincy. The importance of protecting property interests\r\nhad been recognized in that state ever since long prior to the\r\nRevolution, both by a suffrage qualification and in a provision whereby\r\nmembership in the State Senate was apportioned according to the total\r\ntaxes paid in each senatorial district. This system was continued by the\r\nConvention of 1820 but was subsequently abolished. Its sole importance\r\nwas in its recognition of a principle; as a barrier against the rising\r\ntide of suffrage extension it was useless. The suffrage previously\r\nlimited to owners of a moderate amount of property, real or personal,\r\nwas by this Convention extended to all male citizens having paid any\r\nstate or county tax. Adams, Webster and Story voted and spoke against\r\nthe extension, but the writer has not seen a report of their arguments.\r\nSuch of the speeches on the subject as are reported are not\r\nilluminative. They do not go deeply into the matter; those in favor of\r\nan extension have the tone of the perfunctory advocacy of a majority\r\nassured of success, those in opposition that of a hopeless protest. In\r\nfavor of the extension it was argued that there was a popular demand for\r\nit; that it had been enacted in other states; that the existing\r\nMassachusetts qualification was in practice merely nominal; that it was\r\neasily evaded by perjury and sham transfers; that the sentiment of\r\npatriotism does not depend upon the possession of property; that the\r\nright to vote goes with the levy of a tax and that on principle all\r\nsubject to even a poll tax were entitled to vote, and were unjustly\r\ndegraded when the right was denied them. In opposition it was argued\r\nthat property is the foundation of the social state; that there is no\r\nnatural right to vote, and that the question is one of expediency; that\r\nthe property qualification was necessary as a moral force and a check on\r\ndemagoguery; that it encouraged industry, prudence and economy, was a\r\nprotection against waste, elevated the standard of civil institutions\r\nand gave dignity and character to voter and candidate; that very few\r\nbeside vagabonds were actually excluded from the polls, and while the\r\nqualification required was attainable by every efficient man, yet the\r\nprinciple was an important one and should be retained in the\r\nConstitution even though its enforcement had been somewhat lax and\r\nineffective. The majority both in the Convention and at the polls in\r\nMassachusetts was decisive in favor of the proposed extension.\r\n\r\nIn New York the Convention was practically committed to the new measure\r\nbefore it met. The State Assembly had previously reported in its favor\r\nsolely on the ground that the property qualification excluded many of\r\nthe militia; referring probably to that large body of young militiamen\r\nwho were too young to have acquired property. The report said, “On that\r\npart of our Constitution which relates to the qualification of voters at\r\nelection, your committee have to remark that although its provisions\r\nwhen applied to the State of New York may be salutary and necessary it\r\nexcludes from a participation in the choice of the principal officers\r\nof our government, that part of the population on which in case of war\r\nyou are dependent for protection, viz., the most efficient part of the\r\nmilitia of our state.” This meaningless “straddle” is very suggestive of\r\nVan Buren. As an argument for manhood suffrage it is worthless. It is of\r\ncourse absurd to say that because a man has served or may serve in the\r\nmilitia he should therefore be intrusted with any part of the functions\r\nof government irrespective of his lack of other qualifications. Were the\r\nargument good it would require the extension of the vote to boys of\r\neighteen and upwards, and would call in question the right to vote of\r\nany man incompetent to bear arms because of age or infirmity. The\r\nbusiness of government is one thing, and the business of fighting in the\r\nfield is another and very different thing. But this flimsy argument was\r\ncapable of being used in an emotional manner and no doubt was so\r\nemployed in the Convention with considerable effect; and though some of\r\nthe militia had certainly failed to cover themselves with glory in the\r\nwar of 1812, and many commands had done nothing but parade, no\r\npolitician cared to offend them or even to appear to have done so.\r\nAnother so-called argument was that of the Convention Committee on the\r\nElective Franchise which handed in a report in favor of the change,\r\ncontaining the meaningless assertion that property distinctions were of\r\nBritish origin, but that here all interests are identical. The true\r\ntheory that voting is the exercise of a governmental function was not\r\nsuggested by the Committee.\r\n\r\nManhood suffrage was opposed in the New York Convention by three of our\r\nablest jurists, Judges Spencer and Platt of the Supreme Court and\r\nChancellor Kent, the learned author of the _Commentaries on American\r\nLaw_ and one of the most eminent lawyers of the world. Judge Platt truly\r\nsaid that the “elective privilege is neither a right nor a franchise,\r\nbut is more properly speaking an office. A citizen has no more right to\r\nclaim the privilege of voting than of being elected. The office of\r\nvoting must be considered in the light of a public trust, and the\r\nelectors are public functionaries, who have certain duties to perform\r\nfor the benefit of the whole community.” Chancellor Kent strongly and\r\nforcibly said “I cannot but think that considerate men who have studied\r\nthe history of republics or are read in lessons of experience, must look\r\nwith concern upon our apparent disposition to vibrate from a well\r\nbalanced government to the extremes of the democratic doctrines.” Of the\r\nprinciple of universal suffrage he said that it “has been regarded with\r\nterror by the wise men of every age, because in every European republic,\r\nancient and modern, in which it has been tried, it has terminated\r\ndisastrously and been productive of corruption, injustice, violence and\r\ntyranny.... The tendency of universal suffrage is to jeopardize the\r\nrights of property and the principle of liberty.”\r\n\r\nThe vote in the convention in favor of the extension was 100 to 19. The\r\npeople of the State subsequently approved it by a substantial vote. The\r\nmajority in New York City favoring it was 4608. On March 4th, 1822, the\r\nLegislature took the oath under the revised Constitution. Flags were\r\ndisplayed, church bells rung, there were salutes of cannon and an\r\nillumination in New York City. Some slight vestiges of the property\r\nqualification still remained after the adoption of the Constitution of\r\n1822 but they were abolished in New York State in 1826 by a vote of\r\n104,900 to 3901.\r\n\r\nAlthough the action of New York in 1821 following Massachusetts in 1820\r\npractically insured the triumph of manhood suffrage in the United\r\nStates, yet the most interesting and ablest discussion upon the subject\r\nwas yet to take place at Richmond, Virginia, in the State Convention of\r\n1829. The State of Virginia had still clung to the old freehold suffrage\r\nqualification; in that Commonwealth prior to 1829 it was not enough that\r\na voter should have property or business experience; he must be the\r\nowner of land or a freehold interest therein. The standard was not high,\r\nfrom $25 to $50 according to circumstances, but it established the\r\nprinciple and excluded the most degraded. Unfortunately, it also\r\nexcluded many thrifty and intelligent citizens whose holdings did not\r\nhappen to be in the form of real estate. On the demand then made for\r\nextension of the franchise, an opportunity to consider and discuss the\r\ntheory of suffrage was naturally presented to the Constitutional\r\nConvention. That body was composed of about one hundred members,\r\nincluding the ablest political thinkers and most skilful and aggressive\r\ndebaters of Virginia. In point of statesmanship and forensic ability its\r\nmembership has probably never been surpassed in the history of the\r\nUnited States. It included ex-Presidents Madison and Monroe, Chief\r\nJustice John Marshall, John Tyler, John Randolph, William Giles and\r\nAlexander Campbell. The convention sat for over three months and in the\r\ncourse of the discussion on matters connected with the suffrage dozens\r\nof speeches were made, the perusal whereof is very interesting to the\r\npolitical student. Unfortunately, it so happened that though the debates\r\nwere able, the consideration of the whole matter was biased by local\r\nrivalries and by the slavery question, then beginning to confuse and\r\nprejudice the Southern mind, and the most distinguished of the delegates\r\ntook only a minor part in the proceedings. Between the Blue Ridge and\r\nthe sea was Eastern Virginia, the Old Dominion, where tobacco raising\r\nflourished, white labor was scarce and all influential white men were\r\nfreeholders. West of the Blue Ridge lay a new region, where the\r\nindustrial situation was similar to that of the free states, and where\r\nthere was a large body of non-freeholding white working men of the\r\nborderland type, who for years had been agitating for the abolition of\r\nthe old freehold qualification. It was a clash between the Old East and\r\nthe New West; between free labor and slave proprietorship. The\r\nConvention not only undertook the individual suffrage controversy, but\r\nentered into the question which also divided the two sections of the\r\nState, whether the basis of county representation in the legislature or\r\nin either branch thereof should continue as heretofore to be property\r\nvalues rather than population; thus bringing up the fundamental\r\nquestion of whether numbers only should govern without regard to\r\nintelligence, creative power or value to civilization. In this\r\ncontroversy Eastern Virginia, having the greater share of wealth and of\r\nconservative ideas, stood for property rights, and the West stood for\r\nwhat it dubbed “progress” and the “rights of man.” The dispute\r\nthreatened the disruption of the Commonwealth, which actually came to\r\npass a generation later in 1863. The final action of the Convention was\r\nsatisfactory to neither section. The question of county representation\r\nwas finally settled by an elaborate compromise by which each county and\r\nregion was given an arbitrary proportion. The champions of an extension\r\nof the suffrage were victorious by a vote of 51 to 37, Madison and\r\nMarshall voting with the majority and Monroe with the minority; and thus\r\nthe suffrage which had theretofore been confined to owners of land was\r\nextended to such heads of families as were housekeepers and paid taxes.\r\nWhile the only immediate effect was to let in a class of owners of\r\npersonal property, yet it was generally realized at the time that the\r\nnew measure would practically open the door to all heads of families\r\nhowever limited their means, and that universal suffrage was but a short\r\nstep further off.\r\n\r\nOne interested in Virginia history can hardly help wishing that he might\r\nhave witnessed the Convention in session. Some of those present had\r\ntaken part in the American Revolution; all had breathed the\r\nRevolutionary atmosphere. Monroe, old and feeble, presided as long as he\r\ncould hold the gavel, but finally was compelled by weakness to retire.\r\nHe was able to tell the Convention of a visit to another Convention in\r\nParis over thirty years before, and of witnessing (an ominous spectacle)\r\nthe murder of one of its members in the convention hall. Madison,\r\nanother ex-President, was seventy-eight years of age; he spoke two or\r\nthree times during the session, but his voice was so low that he could\r\nnot be heard beyond a distance of a few feet. When he arose to speak the\r\nmembers left their seats and grouped themselves respectfully about him.\r\nRandolph, who bitterly opposed the suffrage extension scheme, had been\r\nthe most popular speaker in the state; he was at that time stricken and\r\nshriveled by disease, but the older delegates remembered him as one who\r\nin his youth had been described as beautiful, fascinating, and even as\r\nlovely. Alexander Campbell was there, a young man destined in later\r\nyears to be the founder of a great religious denomination.\r\n\r\nThese Virginia Convention debates were the last, the ablest, and the\r\nmost exhaustive public discussions of the suffrage question in the\r\nUnited States and must be considered as having included all the\r\narguments on either side which were strongly present to the minds of\r\nAmerican politicians and publicists of the time. They were opened with\r\ngreat ability by Judge Upshur in a very forcible argument lasting\r\nseveral days in favor of property representation. Many of the\r\nsuperficial minded among the delegates favoring extension had come to\r\nRichmond relying upon the proposition that suffrage is a natural right.\r\nUpshur shattered this notion right at the beginning, and it was but\r\nlittle heard of in the Convention afterwards. The absurdity of a savage\r\nbeing born with a natural right to participate in a government which was\r\nnot even imagined until thousands of years afterwards was easily made\r\napparent. “Is it not a solecism” (said Barbour) “to say that rights\r\nwhich have their very being only as a consequence of government, are to\r\nbe controlled by principles applying exclusively to a state of things\r\nwhen there was no government?” Some of the delegates were evidently\r\nfamiliar with Rousseau, and with his theory of a social compact. They\r\ndiscussed at length, but without result, the question whether suffrage\r\nis or is not a right derived from this supposed agreement; and if so,\r\nwhether it was strictly personal or individual, or whether property\r\nrights were also included within the contract, and might therefore\r\nproperly be considered in allotting suffrage privileges. This naturally\r\nraised the question also inconclusively debated whether property as such\r\nis a constituent element of society; or whether it is not rather a\r\nresult of society action, and its acquisition one of the principal\r\ninducements to enter social bonds.\r\n\r\nAlthough the doctrine that governments were instituted and maintained\r\nfor the protection of private property as well as life and limb was\r\nprominent in the minds of all the conservatives and was acknowledged by\r\nnearly every delegate in the Virginia Convention, yet the undoubted fact\r\nthat the act of political voting is a responsible public function\r\nneeding special preparation and qualification was not in Richmond any\r\nmore than previously in Boston realized by the body of delegates; nor\r\nwas the fact that government is a business organization, needing the\r\nservices of expert business men, suggested among them; nor the manifest\r\nexpediency of using the practice of business as a school for the voter.\r\nThe philosophy of the delegates did not go beyond the theory of\r\ngovernment as an agency for the protection of private property rights\r\nand the kindred belief that a permanent and tangible interest in the\r\nState was a necessary requirement of a voter. We have seen that in the\r\nVirginia Bill of Rights, adopted in 1776, the right of suffrage was\r\nexpressly limited to men having “sufficient evidence of permanent common\r\ninterest with and attachment to the community.” In 1829 the principal,\r\nand with most of the Virginia delegates the only objects aimed at in\r\nimposing a qualification upon the voters were the protection of property\r\nand the creation of an electorate interested in the prosperity of the\r\nstate; the right of society to demand that the voter bring to the polls\r\na trained and disciplined mind was lost sight of altogether.\r\n\r\nThe narrowing effect of sectionalism and prejudice on the human mind is\r\ncuriously illustrated by the remarkable fact that in the Convention\r\ndebates it was assumed on both sides that the entire benefit of the\r\nprotection of private property by the Commonwealth inured to its\r\nindividual owners. West Virginia delegates, therefore, insisted that the\r\nrich automatically received a preponderant share in the blessings of\r\ngovernment; for example, said they, ten Virginians each owning $20,000\r\nof property receive in all $200,000 of protection, which is double the\r\ntotal benefit received by one hundred citizens owning $1,000 each; thus\r\none group of ten men get twice as much aggregate benefit from the state\r\nas another group of a hundred men. Over and over again it was urged that\r\ngovernment protection of property was principally for the benefit of the\r\nrich minority. According to this absurd theory, the State of Virginia\r\nhad no interest in the preservation of the accumulated private property\r\nwithin its borders; and would not be damaged if its dwellings,\r\nfurniture, barns, stock, crops, vehicles and vessels of every\r\ndescription were destroyed. The Virginia clerks, laborers and hired\r\nworkers of every description would not suffer in such case by being\r\ndeprived of employment; possibly they could subsist on air, ruins or\r\nradical doctrines. The lack of business training and of business\r\nconceptions among the exceptionally able men of that Convention, and the\r\nneed of such training for the membership of similar bodies today is\r\nstrongly brought to our attention by the circumstance that such foolish\r\nreasoning passed unchallenged. The fact that all property is of common\r\nutility; that it constitutes a vast store from which all, rich, poor and\r\nmiddling are alike supported; that the workman needs the factory at\r\nleast as much as the proprietor, was not in the mind of the Convention;\r\nthe probability that the destruction of the entire property of the ten\r\nrich men above referred to would injure the community at large even more\r\nthan the owners was apparently not appreciated by the Virginia delegates\r\nin 1829 any more than it would be by the members of one of our\r\naldermanic boards today.\r\n\r\nThe principal arguments urged in the Virginia Convention in favor of\r\nmanhood suffrage were, (1) the difficulty of applying any standard of\r\nproperty qualification; (2) that in the ship of state all are\r\npassengers, and the poor among them have the same interest in protection\r\nfrom the elements as the rich; (3) that gratitude requires that old\r\nsoldiers, though poor, should be given a vote by the country they have\r\nserved; (4) that manhood suffrage had worked well in other communities;\r\n(5) that men are naturally not robbers of each other but are inclined\r\nto be affectionate, social, patriotic, conscientious and religious; (6)\r\nthat all men either have or desire property and are, therefore, natural\r\nsupporters of property rights. The answer to these propositions is\r\nobvious, (1) the difficulty of making the standard of qualifications for\r\nany employment or function an absolutely perfect one is never considered\r\na sufficient reason for failing to establish any standard whatever.\r\nWitness the arbitrary standards of age and residence for voters and\r\noffice holders, the qualifications of teachers, doctors, lawyers, etc.;\r\n(2) in no ship is the management, whether in fair weather or foul, left\r\nto the untrained or those without pecuniary interest in the voyage; (3)\r\nsuffrage should never be given or accepted by the unqualified as an\r\nexpression of gratitude; the veterans might as well demand to be\r\nlicensed as dentists as to be allowed to meddle with state affairs; (4)\r\nexperience shows that manhood suffrage has not worked well but evil all\r\nover the world; (5) some men are robbers and still others lack capacity\r\nto select agents or rulers who are honest. The main question is one of\r\ncapacity to exercise the voting function to the advantage of the state.\r\n(6) That all men do not sufficiently desire property to enable them to\r\nact prudently and justly in their property dealings is shown by the\r\nimmense number of spendthrifts, wasters, idlers, cheats, rogues,\r\ngamblers and vagabonds in the world.\r\n\r\nSome of those who then and there favored the extension would probably\r\noppose it today in our thickly populated communities. Eugenius Wilson,\r\nfor instance, an advocate of extension, admitted that suffrage should be\r\nrestricted in an inferior, corrupt or uninstructed constituency.\r\n\r\nThe convention was, of course, regaled by the radicals with the usual\r\npopular sing-song cant. It was told that the suffrage was “an\r\ninestimable privilege of the individual citizen,” a proposition which is\r\nin flat contradiction to the experience of every voter and to the plain\r\nfacts. This proposition Leigh had the courage to deny, saying that good\r\ngovernment for all and not a mere right to individuals to vote is the\r\nreal desideratum. The majority leaders talked of the “original\r\nprinciples” of government, among them being that each citizen may vote,\r\netc. Upshur denied that there were any original principles of\r\ngovernment, because he said “political principles do not precede, they\r\nspring out of government.” He further said that property as well as\r\npersons is a constituent element of Society; that the very idea of\r\nSociety carries with it that of property as its necessary and\r\ninseparable attendant, and that when man entered Society it was to\r\nprocure protection for his property; take away all protection to\r\nproperty and our next business is to cut each other’s throats; the great\r\nbulk of legislation affects property rather than persons, and without\r\nproperty government cannot move an inch. Leigh uttered some things worth\r\nquoting, among them these true and forcible words: “Power and property”\r\n(said he) “may be separated for a time by force or fraud but divorced\r\nnever. For so soon as the pang of separation is felt, if there be truth\r\nin history, if there be any certainty in the experience of ages, if all\r\npretensions to knowledge of the human heart be not vanity and folly,\r\nproperty will purchase power, or power will take property. And either\r\nway, there must be an end of free government. If property buy power, the\r\nvery process is corruption. If power ravish property the sword must be\r\ndrawn, so essential is property to the very being of civilized society,\r\nand so certain that civilized man will never consent to return to a\r\nsavage state.”\r\n\r\nThe proposal to continue the freehold basis of suffrage was defeated by\r\na vote of 37 to 51, Monroe voting yea and Madison and Marshall voting\r\nnay, and by a similar vote the right of suffrage was extended to\r\nhousekeepers, being heads of families and paying any tax whatever. The\r\nreader may be curious to know how the people of Virginia themselves\r\nstood on the question, but it is impossible to say. The vote on the\r\nadoption of the constitution was 26,055 in favor, to 15,563 opposed; but\r\nthis vote was not a measure of Virginia popular opinion in regard to a\r\nproperty qualification. The election went off on a different question\r\nand curiously enough, the new constitution which extended the suffrage\r\nwas adopted by the votes of those opposed to the extension. The western\r\ncounties though favoring, were disappointed because they were not given\r\nthe legislative representation they claimed; in that respect the new\r\nconstitution was considered favorable to the east, which though opposed\r\nto suffrage extension, voted for ratification, while West Virginia voted\r\nto defeat it. Of the total vote in opposition, 13,337, or over\r\nfive-sixths, came from the region west of the Blue Ridge.\r\n\r\nThus the Virginia discussion of the suffrage question, which engaged the\r\nablest public men of the state for a generation and which ought to have\r\nproduced a valuable result, came after all to nothing but compromise\r\nforced by clamor. Though property qualifications were reduced by the\r\nconvention, the true principle involved was not presented or passed\r\nupon. The champions of good government unfortunately took their stand,\r\nnot on the broad ground of property rights and political efficiency, but\r\non the narrow claim of landholders and slave owners to control the\r\nlegislature of the state; they permitted themselves to be placed in the\r\nfalse position of attempting to deny to the most enterprising and\r\nsuccessful business man the vote which they offered to the shiftless\r\nproprietor of a log cabin in the backwoods. They stood on no sound\r\nprinciple and they were defeated.\r\n\r\nAnd now, looking back after a century and considering the immense\r\nimportance of the subject, one cannot help regretting that the fruits of\r\nthe convention labors were merely local and temporary; that it met after\r\nsuffrage extension had been practically allowed to go by default\r\nthroughout the Union, and that the Virginia delegates came to Richmond\r\npledged each to one side of a sectional dispute, instead of prepared to\r\ntake part in a philosophical or statesmanlike search for political\r\ntruth. Very different might have been the result had the Virginia\r\npolitical mind taken up this question freed from local and slavery\r\nprejudice, and had the political talent wasted in a struggle for\r\nsectional control been employed in the useful work of studying the real\r\nfoundation principles of suffrage in a democracy and presenting the\r\nconclusions to the Virginia electorate and to the world. In such case it\r\nmight have reached such a result and brought out such a declaration of\r\nprinciples as would have saved the country and the world centuries of\r\nwallowing in the slough of political corruption and despond.\r\n\r\nTo complete the record it may be added, that in 1850, by a vote of 75 to\r\n33, another Virginia convention further extended the suffrage to all\r\nmale adult residents. As before, the question was confused with the old\r\ndispute over the apportionment of the respective claims of the east and\r\nwest to representation in the legislature; this was again settled by a\r\ncompromise after a prolonged deadlock and the settlement was approved by\r\na popular vote of 75,748 to 11,060. This may be said to be the final\r\nclose of the property qualification controversy in Virginia and in the\r\nUnion, though it had been substantially decided a generation before; and\r\nsince 1850 there has been nowhere any serious discussion of the question\r\nof the right of property to direct representation in government and it\r\nhas been generally regarded since that time as forever disposed of. But\r\nnothing is finally settled till it is settled right.\r\n\r\nAnd so, after a survey of the entire history of the establishment of\r\nmanhood suffrage in the United States, we see that this great experiment\r\nwas originally undertaken by the American people, with but little\r\nrealization of its importance and almost no foresight of its calamitous\r\nresults. We have here another of the numerous instances of the truth of\r\nthe dictum that “Often the greatest changes are those introduced with\r\nthe least notion of their consequence, and the most fatal are those\r\nwhich encountered least resistance.”\r\n\r\nThe majorities in favor of manhood suffrage, wherever the question was\r\ntested, were overwhelming, but they prove nothing; they merely\r\nillustrate once more the well known human lack of vision. Many other\r\nequally foolish measures have been adopted by similar majorities and\r\nattended by similar popular manifestations of satisfaction. The vote in\r\nSouth Carolina for secession was unanimous and the popular rejoicing\r\nthereat was unbounded. Yet we all now see that that secession vote was a\r\nstupendous blunder made without moral or political justification or\r\nground for hope of success. Many of the French Revolutionary lunatic\r\nperformances were almost unanimously decreed and approved by popular\r\nvote. In like manner the American people in the first quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century were blinded into the acceptance of manhood suffrage\r\nor into comparative indifference concerning it, little realizing that in\r\nplace of thereby securing as they were told for themselves and their\r\ndescendants a greater measure of political liberty, they were thereby\r\nfast riveting upon them the chains of political bondage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n     FIRST EFFECTS AND SUBSEQUENT RESULTS OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE; SPOILS\r\n     SYSTEM; TRAFFIC IN VOTES; ORGANIZED CORRUPTION; THE BOSS; THE\r\n     MACHINE; RULE OF POLITICAL OLIGARCHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabas. Now\r\n     Barabas was a robber._ (John: Chap. xviii, 40.)\r\n\r\nOn March 4th, 1829, the old Federal régime died with the departure of\r\nJohn Quincy Adams from the White House. The year 1828 is generally taken\r\nas the last full year of the old honorable and high-toned political\r\nsystem inaugurated by Washington; the last year at the Federal capitol\r\nof real statesmanship, of high ideals and of strict and uncompromising\r\ndevotion to duty. Manhood suffrage had by this time become established\r\nand in operation in almost every state in the Union, and it had\r\nsucceeded in electing as president of the United States a spoilsman,\r\nAndrew Jackson, the apostle of extreme democracy, by whom the former\r\nrule of appointments to public office for merit only, and the old\r\ndoctrine of the continuance of faithful officials in their places were\r\nflung to the winds.\r\n\r\nThe change in the electorate effected by manhood suffrage was not merely\r\nsuperficial, it was radical; what then appeared to many a mere\r\nliberalizing of the franchise was in reality a breaking down of the\r\nguard wall which had hitherto kept the country from slipping down into\r\nthe slough. It degraded the practice of American politics from an\r\nhonorable exercise of patriotism to a sordid business employment; it\r\ncreated a class of professional politicians, self-seeking traffickers in\r\noffice and the spoils of office; and transferred to them the political\r\ncontrol which had theretofore rested in the hands of the gentlemen of\r\nthe country. This unexpected result of manhood suffrage was due to the\r\nfact not sufficiently realized at the time, that it brought into\r\nAmerican politics the important element of the controllable vote, to\r\nwhich was speedily applied by the politicians methods of organization,\r\ncrude and makeshift at first, and afterwards thorough and scientific.\r\nThe American people did not then foresee the existence of a proletariat\r\ncity vote, nor the immense possibilities in the organization of\r\nfloaters. The local politicians of the day, however, saw their chance\r\nand seized it; from amateurs they developed into professionals, and they\r\nspeedily made these floaters the nucleus of a small well-disciplined\r\nregular army, by means whereof they seized the machinery of elections\r\nand of government, which they have ever since retained.\r\n\r\nLet us here stop for a moment to consider and realize what the country\r\nlost at one stroke by manhood suffrage in its swift descent from the\r\nhigh character and traditions of that Federal government, the presidency\r\nof which, much against his will, John Quincy Adams transferred on March\r\n4th, 1829, to Andrew Jackson. The administrations of Washington and the\r\nolder Adams had been of rigid integrity; Jefferson, Madison and Monroe\r\nhad followed in their footsteps. At the time therefore of the election\r\nof the second Adams in 1824, the nation had already acquired an\r\nestablished tradition of about as pure an administration of government\r\nas was humanly possible. The most valuable political asset of a people\r\nconsists of its high political standards and traditions; established\r\nslowly and imperceptibly and by forces of subtle operation they are\r\nelements of the highest importance to its well being. They afford the\r\nexplanation of many instances of the superior success of one country\r\nover another in operating the same political machinery. Already in the\r\nUnited States of 1824 there existed traditions and standards of this\r\nhigh character; among them a belief that men should enter politics if\r\nnot solely from patriotic motives, then at least from a worthy ambition\r\nfor honor and power, and in order to further ideas of public policy.\r\nThis was undoubtedly the doctrine extant at that time; and men could not\r\nthen as now live and flourish in political life under the scarce denied\r\nimputation of being in politics in order to gather political spoils, or\r\nfor the mere sake of salary or from other sordid motives.\r\n\r\nThe high national traditions were well maintained and strengthened by\r\nJohn Quincy Adams during his four years’ term from 1825 to 1829. He\r\nrepresented the opposite of the manhood suffrage ideal, he was\r\nunflinchingly opposed to government by numbers; to the spoils system, to\r\nmachine political methods and objects; he was a statesman rather than a\r\npolitician, and an honest gentleman first of all. His lineage was of the\r\nbest, his public experience great; his learning deep; his reputation\r\nunsullied; he was austere, just and high-minded; his public record was\r\npure and honorable. He was the only president except Washington who\r\nobtained the office entirely on his merits, without having done anything\r\nto court political support. While president he made appointments to\r\noffice solely on fitness, applying that test even to his political and\r\npersonal opponents, keeping them in office provided they were qualified\r\nfor its duties, and absolutely refusing to use in the slightest degree\r\nhis executive power so as to procure his renomination. In 1868 a\r\ncongressional committee reported that having consulted all accessible\r\nmeans of information, they had not learned of a single removal of a\r\nsubordinate officer except for cause from the beginning of Washington’s\r\nadministration to the close of that of John Quincy Adams. Under such\r\nmanagement and prior to 1829 the average of office holders was generally\r\nfair; most of them were men who had led approved lives, had inherited or\r\nacquired a good standing in society, and had achieved a certain\r\nprominence by a combination of social and political qualities, and\r\nthrough the operation of a kind of civic evolution which had brought\r\nthem forward in their respective localities. The effect of the property\r\nqualification laws, and of the traditionary respect for ability,\r\nproperty and social standing of which those laws were at once a cause\r\nand a symptom, was to tend to push such men to the front, and to make it\r\na matter of course that they should be selected as members of Congress,\r\njudges, representatives in the legislature, and for similar high\r\noffices. They were not required to resort to trickery and intrigue to\r\nkeep their places. It was by men of that type that the Revolution had\r\nbeen led to success. It was a fatal mistake of a later generation to\r\nsuppose that a like class of men could be selected by a general vote,\r\nand that the good results of what had practically been a system of\r\nnatural evolution and selection would be attained by an appeal to the\r\nsuffrages of the unlettered and the unwise.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there were instances of corruption in American public life long\r\nbefore manhood suffrage was established; bank scandals for instance.\r\nBanks are now chartered under a general act. A century ago, however,\r\nthey were created by special acts of the legislature, and the granting\r\nof their charters was sometimes attended with charges of legislative\r\ncorruption. As early as 1805 at the passage of the New York Merchants\r\nBank charter, in 1812 at the granting of the charter of the New York\r\nBank of America, and again in 1824 when the New York Chemical Bank was\r\norganized, such charges were made. Such disclosures were plain warnings\r\nof the dangers of laxity in public affairs.\r\n\r\nPopulation and wealth were increasing and so was governmental\r\nexpenditure. Even as early as 1820 there began to appear in the larger\r\ncities a class of idle, vicious, ignorant and therefore purchasable men.\r\nThe possible means of political corruption and the temptations thereto\r\nwere therefore all in plain sight; and wisdom would have suggested,\r\nespecially in view of the continued flood of immigration, that the\r\ngreatest care be taken to make the source of government in the\r\nelectorate as pure and efficient as possible. The electorate is the\r\nfoundation of a free republic, whose political destiny clearly depends\r\non laying well that foundation. Instead of leaving the choice of its\r\nmaterials to hazard and caprice it should have been the subject of\r\nconferences of the very wisest among the American statesmen of those\r\ndays; the silly twaddle of the extremists of the French Revolution about\r\na natural right to vote should have been publicly and systematically\r\ndiscredited; the doctrine that suffrage is not a right but a function\r\nshould have been formally stated and promulgated with all the authority\r\nand prestige of our ablest and most prominent men. The people of the\r\nolder states should have been warned and warned again by assiduous\r\npropaganda against the danger of permitting ignorance and incapacity to\r\nlodge at the very bottom of the structure of our government. The people\r\nof the newer states should also have been instructed that however\r\npermissible as a temporary measure designed to attract settlers to their\r\nvacant lands, the practice of universal suffrage is dangerous and should\r\nbe abolished as soon as society was settled down upon a permanent\r\nfoundation. Nothing of the kind was done; on the contrary, it was at\r\nthis critical time, just when in view of the changing conditions active\r\nmeans should have been taken to preserve the purity of politics, that\r\nthe very opposite course was taken, and the scheme of suffrage extension\r\nwas put into effect by a heedless majority led by politicians who\r\noverruled the wise and disinterested counsels of such able, experienced\r\nand far-seeing men as the venerable John Adams of Massachusetts and\r\nChancellor Kent of New York.\r\n\r\nThe really important result of manhood suffrage and one which was\r\nentirely unforeseen and unexpected by most people of the time was the\r\nintroduction into American politics of the purchasable or controllable\r\nelement as a permanent feature of the electorate, and the tremendous\r\npower thereby acquired by the politicians; and the great defect in the\r\nmanhood suffrage doctrine lay in its completely ignoring the sinister\r\npossibilities of suffrage extension in this direction. The floater or\r\ncontrollable vote speedily became and still is the main reliance of the\r\npolitical oligarchy. Prior to 1828 the activities of politicians had\r\nbeen mostly local. In every village and small town where offices are\r\nfilled by election there is a field for the political activity of small\r\nmen of a well known and inferior type, lazy, vociferous and more or less\r\nunscrupulous. Under the system of property qualification their\r\nactivities were much restrained; most of the rabble whom they were able\r\nto influence had no votes. With the subsequent growth of the country in\r\nwealth and population, the creation of cities of say over thirty\r\nthousand inhabitants, and the increasing devotion of industrious\r\ncitizens to their own affairs, the field for the labors of these\r\npolitical gentry perceptibly widened; but it was manhood suffrage and\r\nthe election of Jackson which gave them their final triumph and placed\r\nthem in power all over the land. The secret of this power lies in the\r\norganization of this floater vote into small local political societies\r\nwhich combined form at least the nucleus of a species of political army\r\nready to do the bidding of its officers. It consists principally of that\r\nconsiderable body of men who have no political principles and no\r\nappreciable pecuniary interest in the community. As they pay no taxes\r\nthey are quite willing that the government outlay be increased provided\r\nthat they get a share of the plunder. They include the worthless\r\nclasses, the very ignorant, the needy and shiftless, drunkards, petty\r\ncriminals, fools, and loafers. Men with small political ambitions, men\r\nwho are business failures, men too lazy to work, are attracted to these\r\norganizations by hopes of political office or other sinecure employment.\r\nIn this way, a fairly sufficient nucleus of controllables is obtained.\r\nTo these may be joined a class of thriftless partisans or followers of\r\nthe bosses; frequenters of saloons and small local political clubrooms;\r\nsuch men as seek political advantage by cheap means or have a taste for\r\nlow politics. Bribes are distributed, sometimes in the shape of small\r\nloans, sometimes as small jobs or employments for themselves, their\r\nrelatives, or friends. Their careless habits and want of principle and\r\nof fixed belief in anything, their small cynicism and their ignorance of\r\npublic affairs, make such men easily manageable by certain politicians\r\nwho are not above dealings of that character. The vote of every man\r\njack of them is as effective as that of a bishop or publicist, and any\r\nscore of them are much more easily managed and reliable than twenty\r\nbishops and publicists would be. The local organization thus formed\r\nlives off a traffic in votes and offices; it buys votes, works them up\r\ninto elective offices and resells them with its trade mark to the\r\nhighest bidder.\r\n\r\nIt was the chiefs of such an organized rabble who seizing the electoral\r\nmachinery rejected Adams in 1828, crying “Away with him, give us\r\nBarabas!” and made Jackson, the illiterate spoilsman, President of the\r\nUnited States. Adams’ defeat ended the epoch of high-minded,\r\ndisinterested statesmanship in the White House. “His retirement” (says\r\nMorse) “brought to a close a list of Presidents who deserved to be\r\ncalled statesmen in the highest sense of that term, honorable men, pure\r\npatriots, and with perhaps one exception all of the first order of\r\nability in public affairs.” (_Life of Adams_, p. 214.) But manhood\r\nsuffrage did more by that stroke than oust Adams; it destroyed the pure\r\npolitical system which he represented, the noble traditions of forty\r\nyears, and deprived the nation of all future hope of seeing as long as\r\nmanhood suffrage endures a Washington, a Hamilton or an Adams in high\r\noffice in this country. “It was” (says Merriam) “by far the most\r\nimportant change made during the Jackson epoch, for it radically altered\r\nthe foundation of the Republic.” (_American Political Theories_, p.\r\n193.)\r\n\r\nSome of the mischief attendant upon the institution of manhood suffrage\r\nmust have been apparent to the discerning eye wherever and as soon as it\r\nwas adopted, but not its full extent. Time was required to get rid of\r\ncompetent and honorable leaders, traditions and standards, to replace\r\nthem by new ones, and to invent catch words and war cries. But as time\r\nwent on this downward movement became accelerated. _Facilis descensus\r\nAverno._ At first, little by little, afterwards more rapidly, the\r\nambitions and creeds of the early Republic were everywhere replaced by\r\nthe sordid cravings and sham sentimentalities of the rabble. In a\r\nsurprisingly short time we got down into the political mire, where we\r\nnow miserably splash about making a stench with every effort to escape.\r\n\r\nThe inauguration of Jackson brought the new maleficent forces into full\r\nplay. Jackson was the embodiment of the manhood suffrage ideal, and of\r\nthe growing revolt against the government of intelligence. Lecky says\r\nthat he “deserves to be remembered as the founder of the most stupendous\r\nsystem of political corruption in modern history.” The following, from\r\nthe pen of Roosevelt, throws light on the situation:\r\n\r\n     “Until 1828 all the presidents, and indeed almost all the men who\r\n     took the lead in public life, alike in national and in state\r\n     affairs, had been drawn from what in Europe would have been called\r\n     the ‘upper classes.’ They were mainly college-bred men of high\r\n     social standing, as well educated as any in the community, usually\r\n     rich or at least well-to-do. Their subordinates in office were of\r\n     much the same material. It was believed, and the belief was acted\r\n     upon, that public life needed an apprenticeship of training and\r\n     experience. Many of our public men had been able; almost all had\r\n     been honorable and upright. The change of parties in 1800, when the\r\n     Jeffersonian Democracy came in, altered the policy of the\r\n     government, but not the character of the officials. In that\r\n     movement, though Jefferson had behind him the mass of the people as\r\n     the rank and file of his party, yet all his captains were still\r\n     drawn from among the men in the same social position as himself.\r\n     The Revolutionary War had been fought under the leadership of the\r\n     colonial gentry; and for years after it was over the people, as a\r\n     whole, felt that their interests could be safely intrusted to and\r\n     were identical with those of the descendants of their revolutionary\r\n     leaders. The classes in which were to be found almost all the\r\n     learning, the talent, the business activity, and the inherited\r\n     wealth and refinement of the country, had also hitherto contributed\r\n     much to the body of its rulers.\r\n\r\n     “The Jacksonian Democracy stood for the revolt against these\r\n     rulers; its leaders, as well as their followers, all came from the\r\n     mass of the people. The majority of the voters supported Jackson\r\n     because they felt he was one of themselves, and because they\r\n     understood that his selection would mean the complete overthrow of\r\n     the classes in power and their retirement from the control of the\r\n     government. There was nothing to be said against the rulers of the\r\n     day; they had served the country and all its citizens well, and\r\n     they were dismissed, not because the voters could truthfully allege\r\n     any wrong-doing whatsoever against them, but solely because, in\r\n     their purely private and personal feelings and habits of life, they\r\n     were supposed to differ from the mass of the people.” (_Life of\r\n     Benton_, pp. 70, 71, 72.)\r\n\r\nPresident Jackson’s administration speedily gave discerning men an\r\nopportunity to measure the standards and ideals of the newly\r\nenfranchised voters. He and they considered the public offices as loot\r\nto be distributed among party workers. With the cry of “To the victors\r\nbelong the spoils” the beneficiaries of universal suffrage began the\r\nwork of plunder and misrule which they have ever since continued.\r\nJackson and Van Buren--a slick politician--became the leaders of the\r\nmobocratic movement, which they called “democratic,” and the demand for\r\noffices became its war cry. In his first presidential message Jackson\r\nproclaimed “that every citizen has a right to share in the emoluments of\r\nthe public service,” an ardent bid for the support of the worthless\r\nclass of men recently granted the vote. We can easily imagine what\r\ncreatures they were. In that early time in a new country, with\r\nopportunity knocking at every man’s door, work to be had for the asking,\r\nlarge farms given by the government free to settlers, with every\r\ninducement to an honest man to follow an industrious calling, they\r\npreferred to loaf around corners, to infest barrooms, to become members\r\nof gangs of political rowdies, to beg, bully and coax for petty offices.\r\nToo lazy or incompetent, or both, to accumulate or even to retain the\r\nsmall amount of property needed to qualify them as voters, their only\r\nambition was by fair or foul means to live off the community with the\r\nleast possible exertion. After Jackson’s inauguration in March 1829, as\r\nwe are told by Ostrogorski:\r\n\r\n     “The vast popular army which marched triumphantly through the\r\n     streets of Washington dispersed to their homes, but one of its\r\n     divisions remained, the corps of marauders which followed it. This\r\n     was composed of the politicians. They wanted their spoils. The\r\n     victory was due to their efforts and as the laborer is worthy of\r\n     his hire, they deserved a reward. By way of remuneration for their\r\n     services, they demanded places in the administration. They filled\r\n     the air of Washington like locusts, they swarmed in the halls and\r\n     lobbies of the public buildings, in the adjoining streets they\r\n     besieged the residences of Jackson and his ministers.” (_Democracy\r\n     and the Party System in the United States._, p. 21.)\r\n\r\n     “It was” (says Schurz) “as if a victorious army had come to take\r\n     possession of a conquered country, expecting their general to\r\n     distribute among them the spoil of the land. A spectacle was\r\n     enacted never before known in the capital of the Republic.” (_Life\r\n     of Clay_, Vol. I, p. 334.)\r\n\r\n     “A new force, compounded in about equal proportions of corruption\r\n     and savagery, was soon made potential, alike in the battle fields\r\n     of politics, in the methods of election and in the processes of\r\n     administration.” (Lalor’s _Cyclopedia_; Spoils System.)\r\n\r\nPrior to Jackson’s time only seventy-four Federal officials had been\r\nremoved from office in the entire history of the government. In the\r\nfirst year of his administration he dismissed or caused to be dismissed\r\nmore than two thousand, and all for political reasons. The number of\r\npersons employed by the Federal Government in the first year of John\r\nQuincy Adams’ administration was about 55,000; under Jackson it was\r\nincreased to over 100,000. In his eight-year term he no doubt doubled\r\nthe number of Federal officials.\r\n\r\n     “A perfect reign of terror ensued among the officeholders. In the\r\n     first month of the new administration more removals took place than\r\n     during all the previous administrations put together. Appointments\r\n     were made with little or no attention to fitness, or even honesty,\r\n     but solely because of personal or political services. Removals were\r\n     not made in accordance with any known rule at all; the most\r\n     frivolous pretexts were sufficient, if advanced by useful\r\n     politicians who needed places already held by capable incumbents.\r\n     Spying and tale-bearing became prominent features of official life,\r\n     the meaner office-holders trying to save their own heads by\r\n     denouncing others. The very best men were unceremoniously and\r\n     causelessly dismissed; gray-headed clerks, who had been appointed\r\n     by the earlier presidents--by Washington, the elder Adams, and\r\n     Jefferson--being turned off at an hour’s notice, although a quarter\r\n     of a century’s faithful work in the public service had unfitted\r\n     them to earn their living elsewhere. Indeed, it was upon the best\r\n     and most efficient men that the blow fell heaviest; the spies,\r\n     tale-bearers and tricksters often retained their positions. In 1829\r\n     the public service was, as it always had been, administered purely\r\n     in the interest of the people; and the man who was styled the\r\n     especial champion of the people dealt that service the heaviest\r\n     blow it has ever received.” (Roosevelt; _Life of Benton_, pp. 82,\r\n     83.)\r\n\r\nIn a speech in the House of Representatives in 1834 Henry Clay referred\r\nto “the ravenous pursuit after public situations not for the sake of the\r\nhonors and the performance of their public duties but as a means of\r\nprivate subsistence.” He said that the office hunters were so greedy\r\nthat they watched with eagerness the dying bed of an actual incumbent.\r\nDaniel Webster, about the time of Jackson’s election said: “As far as I\r\nknow there is no civilized country on earth in which, under change of\r\nrulers, there is such an inquisition of spoils as we have witnessed in\r\nthis free republic.” From this time forward this degenerate type of\r\noffice seekers became an important factor in every American election.\r\nThe victory of Jackson, says Farrand,\r\n\r\n     “Was a victory of the South and West, especially by the latter; it\r\n     was a victory for democracy; but it was also a victory of organized\r\n     politics ... it seems to mark the rise of a class of professional\r\n     politicians. These men were not like the old ruling class whose\r\n     members were in politics largely from a sense of duty and public\r\n     service, or for the honor of it, or even for the sake of power; but\r\n     they were in politics as a business, not for the irregular profits\r\n     to be derived therefrom but to make a living.” (_Development of the\r\n     United States_, pp. 156, 157.)\r\n\r\nIt is really astonishing to note how speedily manhood suffrage developed\r\nits appropriate mischiefs. Soon, with the increase of a purchasable\r\nconstituency the traffic in votes became more easy and common, and the\r\nstruggle for the spoils grew rapidly in intensity. The policy then put\r\ninto play of making the offices the spoils of politics produced in a\r\ncomparatively few years the beginnings of the political machine.\r\n\r\n     “General Jackson, the candidate of the populace, and the\r\n     representative hero of the ignorant masses, instituted a new system\r\n     of administering the government, in which the personal interests\r\n     became the most important element, and that organization and\r\n     strategy were developed which have since become known and infamous\r\n     under the name of the political machine.” (_Life of J. Q. Adams_ by\r\n     Morse, p. 214.)\r\n\r\nAbout 1830 a new flood of immigration set in and the politicians made it\r\ntheir business to win the favor of the immigrants and to organize the\r\ngreat foreign vote and especially the Irish vote in New York City and\r\nelsewhere. This was not difficult as there was neither opposition nor\r\ncompetition. In New York they seized Tammany Hall, and perfected and\r\nemployed its organization and similar organizations elsewhere; they\r\ndeveloped and enthroned political bosses, and established and operated\r\npolitical machines. The growth of this class is thus described by\r\nOstrogorski:\r\n\r\n     “But in proportion as the old generation which had founded the\r\n     republic disappeared, as the development of the country entailed\r\n     that of the public service, and the political contingents increased\r\n     through extension of the suffrage, the scramble for the loaves and\r\n     fishes became closer and keener. There arose a whole class of men\r\n     of low degree who applied all their energies in this direction, and\r\n     who sought their means of subsistence in politics, and especially\r\n     in its troubled waters.” (_Democracy and the Party System in the\r\n     United States_, p. 19.)\r\n\r\nAnd further:\r\n\r\n     “The old political supremacy wielded by the élite of the nation,\r\n... passed to an innumerable crowd of petty local leaders who\r\n     stood nearer to the masses but who too often were only needy\r\n     adventurers.” (P. 23.)\r\n\r\nJackson was followed in 1837 by his lieutenant, Van Buren, who was the\r\nfirst machine-made President, and the situation is thus described by\r\nRoosevelt:\r\n\r\n     “During Van Buren’s administration the standard of public honesty,\r\n     which had been lowering with frightful rapidity ever since, with\r\n     Adams, the men of high moral tone had gone out of power, went\r\n     almost as far down as it could go; although things certainly did\r\n     not change for the better under Tyler and Polk. Not only was there\r\n     the most impudent and unblushing rascality among the public\r\n     servants of the nation, but the people themselves, through their\r\n     representatives in the state legislatures, went to work to swindle\r\n     their honest creditors. Many states, in the rage for public\r\n     improvements, had contracted debts which they now refused to pay;\r\n     in many cases they were unable, or at least so professed\r\n     themselves, even to pay the annual interest. The debts of the\r\n     states were largely held abroad; they had been converted into stock\r\n     and held in shares, which had gone into a great number of hands,\r\n     and now, of course, became greatly depreciated in value. It is a\r\n     painful and shameful page in our history; and every man connected\r\n     with the repudiation of the states’ debts ought, if remembered at\r\n     all, to be remembered only with scorn and contempt.”\r\n\r\nTowards the close of Van Buren’s administration, complaint was made of\r\nwaste of public money.\r\n\r\n     “There was good ground for their complaint, as the waste and\r\n     peculation in some of the departments had been very great.... While\r\n     they had been in power the character of the public service had\r\n     deteriorated frightfully, both as regarded its efficiency and\r\n     infinitely more as regarded its honesty; and under Van Buren the\r\n     amount of money stolen by the public officers, compared to the\r\n     amount handed in to the treasury, was greater than ever before or\r\n     since. For this the Jacksonians were solely and absolutely\r\n     responsible; they drove out the merit system of making\r\n     appointments, and introduced the ‘spoils’ system in its place; and\r\n     under the latter they chose a peculiarly dishonest and incapable\r\n     set of officers, whose sole recommendation was to be found in\r\n     knavish trickery and low cunning that enabled them to manage the\r\n     ignorant voters who formed the backbone of Jackson’s party.” (_Life\r\n     of Benton_, pp. 219, 230, 231.)\r\n\r\nIn 1841 Harrison succeeded Van Buren; there was a change of parties; the\r\nDemocrats went out, and the Whigs, who had inveighed against the spoils\r\nsystem, took their places. But the expected reform did not come off; it\r\nwas no longer a question of parties or policies; the electorate itself\r\nhad been hopelessly degraded by manhood suffrage, and the leaders of\r\nboth parties were unable, if they wished, to purify politics; they were\r\nobliged either to adopt manhood suffrage low methods, or go out of\r\npublic life. In vain Clay, the great Whig leader, thundered in Congress\r\nagainst the spoils system.\r\n\r\n     “In solemn words of prophecy, he (Clay) painted the effects which\r\n     the systematic violation of this principle (Government is a trust),\r\n     inaugurated by Jackson, must inevitably bring about; political\r\n     contests turned into scrambles for plunder; a system of universal\r\n     rapacity, substituted for a system of responsibility; favoritism\r\n     for fitness; a Congress corrupted, the press corrupted, general\r\n     corruption; until the substance of free government having\r\n     disappeared, some pretorian band would arise, and with the general\r\n     concurrence of a distracted people, put an end to useless forms.”\r\n     (Schurz, _Life of Clay_, p. 335, Vol. I.)\r\n\r\nClay’s influence in Congress was enormous, but he was powerless to cure\r\nthe inherent rottenness of a manhood suffrage constituency. The pressure\r\nof the spoilsmen upon the Whig Harrison’s administration equalled or\r\nsurpassed that upon the Democrat Jackson, and is said to have caused\r\nHarrison’s death. It is thus described by Ostrogorski:\r\n\r\n     “When Harrison took up his abode in the White House, the rush\r\n     became tremendous; the applicants literally pursued the ministers\r\n     and the president day and night; they besieged the former in their\r\n     offices or in their homes, and even in the streets; a good many\r\n     candidates for offices slept in the corridors of the White House to\r\n     catch the president the next morning as soon as he got up.”\r\n     (_Democracy and the Party System in the U.S._, p. 36.)\r\n\r\nSchurz thus describes the operation of the manhood suffrage spoils\r\nsystem as it had developed in ten or twelve years after its introduction\r\nin 1829:\r\n\r\n     “Not only were the officers of the government permitted to become\r\n     active workers in party politics, but they were made to understand\r\n     that active partisanship was one--perhaps the principal one--of\r\n     their duties. Political assessments upon office holders with all\r\n     the inseparable scandals became at once a part of the system. The\r\n     spoils politician in office grasped almost everywhere the reins of\r\n     local leadership in the party.... The spoils system bore a crop of\r\n     corruption such as had never been known before. Swartwout, the\r\n     collector of customs at New York, one of General Jackson’s\r\n     favorites, was discovered to be a defaulter to the amount of nearly\r\n     $1,250,000, and the District Attorney of the U. S. at New York to\r\n     the amount of $72,000. Almost all land officers were defaulters....\r\n     Officials seemed to help themselves to the public money, not only\r\n     without shame, but in many cases apparently without any fear of\r\n     punishment.” (_Life of Clay_, Vol. II, pp. 183, 184.)\r\n\r\nThis from Roosevelt referring to 1838:\r\n\r\n     “The Jacksonian Democracy was already completely ruled by a\r\n     machine, of which the most important cogs were the countless\r\n     office-holders, whom the spoils system had already converted into a\r\n     band of well-drilled political mercenaries. A political machine can\r\n     only be brought to a state of high perfection in a party containing\r\n     very many ignorant and uneducated voters; and the Jacksonian\r\n     Democracy held in its ranks the mass of the ignorance of the\r\n     country.” (_Life of Benton_, p. 185.)\r\n\r\nSome writers put all the blame on Jackson for the overthrow of the old\r\nlofty ideals and standards of Federal politics, which occurred in his\r\npresidency. But Jackson, though coarse and ignorant, was not evil-minded\r\nnor intentionally unpatriotic; nor was he, even if so disposed, gifted\r\nwith the power of corrupting the entire politics of the country. The\r\nmischiefs which broke out in his time were nation-wide and must have\r\nbeen due to a nation-wide cause. The fact is that the party of which\r\nJackson happened to be the leader was caught in a movement, the full\r\nmeaning and effect of which was unsuspected by everybody. The wash of\r\nthe French Revolution had reached us and had swept manhood suffrage into\r\nour boat. Schurz says that in Jackson’s administration there was infused\r\ninto the government and the whole body politic a spirit of lawlessness\r\nwhich outlived Jackson, and of which the demoralizing influence is felt\r\nto this day; that barbarous habits were then first introduced into the\r\nfield of national affairs, and selfishness made a ruling motive in\r\npolitics, resulting in a crop of corruption which startled the country.\r\nAll this is true; the mistake is in ascribing to Jackson or to any one\r\nperson a widespread deterioration no one man could possibly have\r\naccomplished. For such a far-reaching effect, a universal cause was\r\nneeded; and that that cause was manhood suffrage no candid investigator\r\ncan possibly doubt. McLaughlin in his _Life of Cass_ (p. 136) recognizes\r\nthat the introduction of the spoils system in 1829 cannot be solely\r\ncharged to Jackson or to Van Buren; that they were the mere conduits\r\nthrough which was conducted into federal politics the flood of\r\ncorruption produced by other causes. But those causes he fails to\r\nspecify. “It came by natural evolution ... the offices of trust were\r\nhanded over to the men who brought the greatest pressure to bear, and\r\ncould make plain their political influences to the scullions of the\r\nkitchen cabinet. If the student of American politics is to understand\r\nthe place which the spoils system holds he must see that its\r\nintroduction was a natural phase in our national development.” And he\r\ndescribes the brutality of “the scrambling, punch-drinking mob which\r\ninvaded Washington at Jackson’s inauguration.” It needs no Sherlock\r\nHolmes, however, to tell us that the advent of this mob and their\r\npossession of the administration would not have been “a natural phase in\r\nour national development” had it not been for the specific operation of\r\nthe new institution of manhood suffrage. The influences which it\r\nintroduced in our political structure were favorable to the spoils\r\nsystem, which was popularly felt to be a proper result of the filling\r\nof all offices by vote of the masses. The _Cyclopedia of American\r\nGovernment_ states that the people favored the introduction of the\r\nspoils system. As Marcy said in a speech about that time, “They see\r\nnothing wrong in the rule that to the victors belong the spoils of the\r\nenemy.” In a word the Democratic spirit ignored efficiency in office as\r\nwell as in the voter; and the office became what it still continues to\r\nbe, a reward, a token of gratitude for political activity.\r\n\r\nThe lamentable effects of manhood suffrage continued in full sweep after\r\nthe death of Harrison and the return of the Jackson Democracy to power\r\nunder Polk in 1845. The resultant flagrant misgovernment caused growing\r\npopular resentment which might have produced valuable results had it not\r\nbeen for the slavery agitation which soon drove all other political\r\nquestions into the background. Already in 1843 the dissatisfaction of\r\nlarge numbers was displayed by the organization of the American or\r\nKnownothing party, which born in New York and baptized with blood in\r\nPhiladelphia rapidly spread through the country. Formed ostensibly to\r\ncheck the growing power of Irish Roman Catholic politicians, its real\r\ngrievance was manhood suffrage misrule. Its leaders mistook the cause of\r\nthe new political scandals. They wrongly attributed them exclusively to\r\nthe Irish; they were really due to the effect of the voting power of the\r\nnewly enfranchised and organized political floaters, both foreign and\r\nAmerican. Polk’s election was secured by the machine in 1844:\r\n\r\n     “By the almost solid foreign vote still unfit for the duties of\r\n     American citizenship; by the vicious and criminal classes in all\r\n     the great cities of the North and in New Orleans; by the corrupt\r\n     politicians, who found ignorance and viciousness tools ready forged\r\n     to their hands, wherewith to perpetrate the gigantic frauds without\r\n     which the election would have been lost.” (Roosevelt, _Life of\r\n     Benton_, pp. 290, 291.)\r\n\r\n     On Pierce’s inauguration in 1853, says Rhodes, “the importunate\r\n     begging for official positions in a republic where it was so easy\r\n     to earn a living was nothing less than disgraceful. Office seekers\r\n     crowded the public receptions of the President, and while greeting\r\n     him in the usual way, attempted at the same time to urge their\r\n     claims, actually thrusting their petitions into his hands.”\r\n     (_Rhodes_, I, 339.)\r\n\r\nMeantime the bribery of voters and of legislatures rapidly grew more\r\ncommon and shameless, and about this time the purchase of legislation\r\nbegan to be a scandal. Referring to this period, Prof. Reinsch says:\r\n\r\n     “In those earlier days things were often managed with little\r\n     adroitness. There was much indiscriminate and broadcast bribery; to\r\n     buy men for a moderate amount per vote was the acme of ambition to\r\n     the successful lobbyist.” (_American Legislatures and Legislative\r\n     Methods_, p. 231.)\r\n\r\nAnd Farrand writes, referring to the same period:\r\n\r\n     “For the first time in contemporary accounts much was made of the\r\n     vile corruption of politics, the charge being with the growth of a\r\n     class of professional politicians and the great increase of wealth\r\n     that money was used improperly, both for bribing of voters and for\r\n     accomplishing the miscarriage of justice.” (_Development of United\r\n     States_, p. 209.)\r\n\r\nUnder the united influence of manhood suffrage and its offspring the\r\nspoils system, corruption, rascality and official incapacity increased\r\nenormously as time went on. The historian Rhodes writing of the decade\r\nfrom 1850 to 1860 says that “plentiful evidence of the popular opinion\r\nthat dishonesty prevailed may be found in the literature of the time.”\r\nAnd that, “the executive and legislative departments of the national\r\ngovernment were undoubtedly as much tainted with corruption between\r\n1850-60 as they are at the present time.” (1904.) Senator Benton of\r\nMissouri writing in 1850 said:\r\n\r\n     “Now office is sought for support and for the repair of dilapidated\r\n     fortunes; applicants obtrude themselves, and prefer claims to\r\n     office. Their personal condition and party services, not\r\n     qualification, are made the basis of the demand; and the crowds\r\n     which congregate at Washington, at the change of an\r\n     administration, supplicants for office are humiliating to behold,\r\n     and threaten to change the contest of parties from a contest for\r\n     principle into a struggle for plunder.” (_Thirty Years in\r\n     Congress_, Vol. I, p. 81.)\r\n\r\nAnd further: (p. 163).\r\n\r\n     “I deprecate the effect of such sweeping removals at each\r\n     revolution of parties and believe it is having a deplorable effect\r\n     both upon the purity of elections and the distribution of office,\r\n     and taking both out of the hands of the people and throwing the\r\n     management of one and the enjoyment of the other into most unfit\r\n     hands. I consider it as working a deleterious change in the\r\n     government.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time public officials were assessed for political\r\ncontributions; afterwards the offices were put on sale. “Under Buchanan\r\n(1857-1861) was established the practice of taxing federal office\r\nholders. The politicians after the war carried it to perfection. There\r\nwere five categories of assessments on salaries; federal, state,\r\nmunicipal, ward and district.” (Ostrogorski; _Democracy_, p. 68.)\r\n\r\nThe politicians under Lincoln were no whit behind their predecessors.\r\nThe new administration machine went merrily to work right after March 4,\r\n1861. Then followed such scandals as might naturally be expected from\r\nthe appointment as Secretary of War of Simon Cameron, the rapacious and\r\ncorrupt Pennsylvania boss. Carbines were sold by the Government at $3.50\r\neach and repurchased at $15, and the contract repeated, the second\r\npurchase being at $22. Large sums were spent without accounting in\r\nviolation of law. Brothers-in-law were in luck. Cameron’s brother-in-law\r\nwas president of a railroad which in one year exacted from the\r\nGovernment a million or more for excessive transportation charges. One\r\nMorgan, the brother-in-law of the Secretary of the Navy, was made\r\npurchasing agent for railroad supplies, although he was absolutely\r\nwithout experience in that line. Other politicians received similar\r\nfavors. A great scandal was caused by the issuing of permits for\r\ntrading with the enemy under which supplies to numerous amounts\r\nsufficient to furnish whole armies were sent through the rebel lines.\r\nThe machine was able to obtain the signature of Lincoln himself to these\r\npermits. Foreign affairs were neglected in order that the offices might\r\nbe distributed. (Stickney; _Organized Democracy_, Chap. III.)\r\n\r\nComing to the next decade we find a systematic corruption of the\r\nelectorate, a large part whereof was willing no doubt to be corrupted.\r\nOstrogorski says that “after the (Civil) War the exasperation of party\r\nspirit and the extraordinary development of the spoils system led to\r\nbribery being used as a regular weapon.... The parties often secure, in\r\nmuch the same way, the votes of the members of the labor unions; the\r\nleaders ‘sell them out’ to the parties without the workmen having a\r\nsuspicion of it. The voters who deliberately sell themselves belong in\r\nthe cities, mostly to the dregs of the population.”\r\n\r\nAnd also referring to states where the vote was close:\r\n\r\n     “These states ranked among the doubtful ones, four or five in\r\n     number, are drenched with money during the presidential campaign\r\n     for buying the ‘floaters,’ the wavering electors who sell\r\n     themselves to the highest bidder.” (Pp. 206, 207.)\r\n\r\nDuring all this period and down to the present time, the spoils system\r\nbuilt on manhood suffrage has been the dominant force in our public\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n     “It is” (says Bryce) “these spoilsmen who have depraved and\r\n     distorted the mechanism of politics. It is they who pack the\r\n     primaries and run the conventions so as to destroy the freedom of\r\n     popular choice, they who contrive and execute the election frauds\r\n     which disgrace some States and cities--repeating and ballot\r\n     stuffing, obstruction of the polls and fraudulent countings in.\r\n\r\n     In making every administrative appointment a matter of party claim\r\n     and personal favour, the system has lowered the general tone of\r\n     public morals, for it has taught men to neglect the interests of\r\n     the community, and made insincerity ripen into cynicism. Nobody\r\n     supposes that merit has anything to do with promotion, or believes\r\n     the pretext alleged for an appointment. Politics has been turned\r\n     into the art of distributing salaries so as to secure the maximum\r\n     of support from friends with the minimum of offence to opponents.\r\n     To this art able men have been forced to bend their minds: on this\r\n     Presidents and ministers have spent those hours which were demanded\r\n     by the real problems of the country.” (_American Commonwealth_,\r\n     Vol. II, p. 137.)\r\n\r\nMeantime the politicians, not content with the original operation of\r\nmanhood suffrage on the spoils of office, have bethought them of adding\r\nto the fruits of these operations by increasing still further the number\r\nof elective offices. It has been easy to persuade to this move many of\r\nthat small number of intelligent voters who trouble themselves about\r\nsuch matters. The pretence of extending the sway of democracy and\r\nliberty which has always been used to cover schemes of public plunder\r\nwas found sufficient once more. On this pretence the administrative and\r\njudicial offices of various states were made elective instead of\r\nappointive as formerly. As Ostrogorski says (_Idem_, p. 25):\r\n\r\n     “The democratic impulse which carried Jackson into power had forced\r\n     the way, in the constitutional sphere, for two important changes:\r\n     the introduction of universal suffrage, and the very considerable\r\n     extension of the elective principle to public offices,”\r\n\r\nUnder this system which still obtains in many states, scores of state,\r\ncounty and municipal offices are offered at every election to the choice\r\nof the mass of electors who on approaching the polls find themselves\r\ncalled on to select in addition to the members of the state legislature\r\nand Congress and state governors, a dozen or a score of administrative\r\nofficials and judges. Sometimes they are invited to vote for an\r\nattorney-general, a state engineer and surveyor, a state treasurer, a\r\nstate comptroller, half a dozen judges and justices, a district\r\nattorney, a sheriff, a mayor, a city treasurer, a couple of coroners,\r\nbesides a governor, a state senator, and assemblymen and aldermen, say\r\ntwenty in all. Sometimes as at an election in St. Louis, the list\r\ncontains thirteen city officials to be elected, besides state officers\r\nand congressmen. In the cities of Ohio it sometimes includes an average\r\nof twenty-two officers at each yearly election. In a small town near New\r\nYork there are about fifteen local offices to be filled at an election\r\nbesides a dozen or two state and federal offices and so on throughout\r\nthe Union. “Let the people rule,” say the politicians, because when the\r\npeople attempt to rule by choosing administrative officials, it is\r\nreally the politicians who make the choice. It is doubtful if there ever\r\nwas a voter, even a professional politician, who was sufficiently well\r\nacquainted with each of the candidates on such a ticket and with his\r\nduties to enable him to decide intelligently upon his merits as compared\r\nwith his rivals. Certainly not one in a hundred is competent to do so.\r\nRemember, too, that the voter has no real choice in the original\r\nselection of these candidates; that they are all chosen before the\r\nelection by party managers in secret conclave, and forced through the\r\nprimaries by the power of the machine; that if the voter rejects one\r\nrogue or incapable whom he happens to know or has heard of, he can do no\r\nmore after all than to vote for the other party candidate who is quite\r\nlikely to be likewise of the same evil stripe. The reader can see that\r\nmanhood suffrage applied in this way is an infallible method of making\r\neasy and safe the selection of incompetent rascals for public office.\r\nFor what the voter usually does in such case is to vote the whole party\r\nticket, rogues, fools and all, realizing that if he fails to do so the\r\nrival set of scamps and incompetents will be the sole gainers.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to 1850 and by degrees the army of American politicians\r\nbecame more and more skilled and specialized in their craft; they became\r\nhighly organized and disciplined; having leaders, officers, rules and\r\ntraditions. Men went into politics in youth as a profession, grew old\r\nand rich in its practice, and trained up their deputies and successors.\r\nThe political leader became known as the Boss; a group of Bosses as a\r\nRing; a combination of Rings as the Machine whose power is sometimes\r\nirresistible. Especially after the Civil War (1865) the power of the\r\nbosses increased, and they habitually after that time distributed\r\nnominations, collected assessments, and gave orders to state\r\nlegislatures. The system thus perfected has continued to the present day\r\nand is everywhere working smoothly. The American people have now\r\npractically ceased resistance to the bosses. In a letter addressed to\r\nFrancis A. Walker signed by William Cullen Bryant, Carl Schurz and\r\nothers, dated April 6, 1876, reference is made to “the widespread\r\ncorruption in our public servants which has disgraced the republic in\r\nthe eyes of the world and threatens to poison the vitality of our\r\ninstitutions.” On March 31, 1876, Schurz writes to Bristow: “We have\r\nbeen so deeply disgraced in the estimation of mankind by the exposures\r\nof corruption in our public servants, and the faith of many of our\r\npeople in our institutions has been so dangerously shaken.” David Dudley\r\nField of New York, writing in 1877, says:\r\n\r\n     “The corruption of American politics is a phrase in everybody’s\r\n     mouth, not only in this country, but in others.... We see offices\r\n     claimed and bestowed not for merit but for party work, and as a\r\n     natural consequence we see the public service inefficient and\r\n     disordered. We see venal legislatures and executive officers\r\n     receiving gifts.... We see legislatures, state and federal,\r\n     guaranteeing monopolies to corporations and individuals, making\r\n     gifts of the public lands and bestowing subsidies from the public\r\n     treasury; we see the plunder of local communities by what is called\r\n     local taxation, and we see demagogues clamoring for largesses under\r\n     pretense, perhaps, of equalizing bounties, or other equally\r\n     dishonest pretenses.... The condition of our civil service is a\r\n     scandal to the country.... Taking the country together two-thirds\r\n     of the present official force would do all the work needed and do\r\n     it better than it is now done.”\r\n\r\nAnd proceeding, he spoke of politics as then pursued as a branch of\r\nbusiness, and the office holders as a band of mercenaries who were the\r\nsupporters of misgovernment. (_Corruption in Politics; International\r\nReview_, Jan., 1877.)\r\n\r\nPhysicians tell us that from a source of disease, however small and\r\nobscure, a disordered tooth for instance, an infection may spread\r\nthrough the body until despite its apparent vigor, it in undermined and\r\nfinally destroyed. The corruption begun in the electorate, has spread\r\nbeyond the political system and has reached and invaded business life.\r\nThis progress is so easy to trace that every business man in the country\r\nis familiar with it. Political leaders and bosses are purchasable and so\r\nare often machine-made legislators. Hence the two-fold evil, on the one\r\nhand the bribery of legislators and public officials, and on the other,\r\nthreats and acts of oppression by the latter so as to compel business to\r\npay tribute. These practices are so notorious and instances of them are\r\nso familiar, many of them referred to in this volume, that at this point\r\nit is sufficient to call attention to their frequency and extent. Again\r\nquoting Bryce:\r\n\r\n     “In the United States the money power acts by corrupting sometimes\r\n     the voter, sometimes the juror, sometimes the legislator, sometimes\r\n     a whole party; for large subscriptions and promises of political\r\n     support have been known to influence a party to procure or refrain\r\n     from such legislation as wealth desires or fears. The rich, it is\r\n     but fair to say, and especially great corporations, have not only\r\n     enterprises to promote but dangers to escape from at the hands of\r\n     unscrupulous demagogues or legislators.” (_American Commonwealth_,\r\n     Vol. II, p. 614.)\r\n\r\nIn 1889 George William Curtis, referring to the United States,\r\napprovingly quoted the saying of a United States Senator made in 1876\r\nthat “the only product of her institutions in which she surpassed all\r\nothers beyond question was her corruption.” In 1890 he said that\r\npolitical corruption “has increased, is increasing and ought to be\r\ndiminished.” In 1891 Curtis said that “corruption in our politics was\r\nnever felt to be so general, so vast and penetrating, as during the last\r\nquarter of a century.” In the Omaha Populist platform of 1892, it was\r\ndeclared that:\r\n\r\n     “We are meeting in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of\r\n     moral, political and material ruin. Corruption dominates the ballot\r\n     box, the Legislators, the Congress and touches even the ermine of\r\n     the bench. People are demoralized.... The fruits of the toil of\r\n     millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes.... From\r\n     the same prolific womb of political justice we breed the two great\r\n     classes--tramps and millionaires.”\r\n\r\nWe forbear to quote later opinions or authorities on this branch of our\r\nsubject at this point, though contemporary magazines and newspapers\r\nafford them in great number, because we have wished as far as possible\r\nto keep within the domain of history and to avoid the doubtful field of\r\npresent-day partisan political controversy. If proof of the evil of\r\npresent conditions were desirable it is sufficiently found between the\r\ncovers of this book, but such proof is quite unnecessary. The\r\nunsatisfactory character of the political life of today is as well known\r\nto the intelligent reader as to the writer or to anyone else. There has\r\nbeen no betterment of recent years. The activities of our political\r\nmasters have kept pace with the march of prosperity, the increase of the\r\nnation’s wealth and population, and the growth of its great cities.\r\nThere is today practically no political liberty in the United States.\r\nThe country is badly, corruptly and shamefully ruled by a class, an\r\noligarchy, one of the most corrupt and tyrannical at present existing\r\nanywhere, and composed of small groups of weak and tricky men not five\r\nper cent of whom under a system of properly qualified suffrage would\r\nhave votes at all. Instead of free elections to public office what\r\nactually occurs is as described by Dr. Charles P. Clark:\r\n\r\n     “Two organized bands of active, intriguing and self-seeking\r\n     politicians, composing less than one hundredth part of the whole\r\n     voting population, dispute with each other, and one of them obtains\r\n     the selection--mark the pregnant meaning of the word--of every\r\n     public functionary.” (_The Machine Abolished_, p. 29.)\r\n\r\nHaving identified the source and origin of this evil political condition\r\nwith the institution of manhood suffrage and traced the mischief down\r\nto the present-day generation, let us proceed to the next chapter\r\nwherein will be set forth a brief description or example of the nature\r\nand characteristics of the professional politician, the political Boss,\r\nthe political Machine, the political Ring, and the Lobby; all of which\r\nbeautiful creations are the product or result direct or indirect of that\r\nmuch vaunted institution, manhood suffrage. It is doubtful if any of\r\nthem can be found elsewhere than in America; certainly they reach their\r\nhighest development in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n     SHORT SKETCHES OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE PROGENY; THE POLITICIAN AND THE\r\n     BOSS; THEIR CREATIONS THE RING AND THE MACHINE; AND THEIR\r\n     BY-PRODUCT, THE LOBBY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo account of manhood suffrage would be complete without proper mention\r\nof the politicians and their work, for they are the essential product of\r\nthe system, its distinctive feature and its condemnation. It is they who\r\nmanage the controllable vote created by manhood suffrage and without\r\nwhich they themselves would cease to exist; and it is they who nurse\r\nthat vote, feed it and train and fashion it to their malign uses as an\r\ninstrument of perfect control of American political life. The\r\npoliticians are absolutely indispensable to the working of the present\r\npolitical system in the United States. They handle the voters like\r\ncattle intended for the stock market; like the animals the voters go\r\nwillingly or half willingly to the places prepared for them, in\r\npursuance of plans in which they take no part, which they do not\r\nunderstand. The voters are bargained for and delivered in batches just\r\nas the animals are, and the managers and their subordinates in charge\r\nare the political masters of the country.\r\n\r\nThese managers from the very first have been a sordid lot. De\r\nTocqueville, writing about 1835, when the manhood suffrage régime was\r\nonly ten years old said of them, “I have heard of patriotism in the\r\nUnited States, and I have found true patriotism among the people, but\r\nnever among the leaders of the people.” (_Democracy in America_, Vol.\r\nI.) The present-day professional politicians may be as lacking in\r\npatriotism as the political leaders of De Tocqueville’s time, but taken\r\nall together they are and have always been a picturesque company, who\r\nhave been frequently described by able writers, from some of whom\r\nextracts will here be given for the delectation and information of the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nThere are of course high and low grade politicians, small and large\r\nleaders and managers and various grades between; besides retainers and\r\nsubordinates, known as captains or henchmen with their followers or\r\nheelers. In cities, the local or district leader is often an able man in\r\nhis way; and of late years as politics has developed into a science, he\r\nis often found to be sober, shrewd and well mannered. His duties are\r\nvaried. He assists and protects his constituents in local political\r\nmatters; obtains the saloon license; also permits for the small trades\r\nor businesses, the boot-black, the lemonade seller, etc. He protects\r\nagainst arrests, gets bail for culprits, sees police judges, lends small\r\nsums, distributes coal in winter, gives poultry at Christmas, sends\r\nmedicine for the sick, helps bury the dead by procuring credit or cheap\r\nrates at the undertaker’s, orders drinks at the saloon, and is looked on\r\nas a ready helper in time of trouble of all kinds. He may have placed a\r\nlarge number of men on the city pay-roll who never do much work and\r\nwhose principal duties are to attend conventions, get out the vote on\r\nelection day, promise places and favors, and threaten and intimidate\r\nopposition to the regular ticket. In some cities these petty leaders are\r\nnumbered by the thousand. It was estimated at one time that they totaled\r\n12,000 to 15,000 in New York alone. As time passes the outward semblance\r\nand methods of the politician may change, or they may vary with his\r\nsituation and station in the political hierarchy, but his spirit and\r\nobjects and evil influence continue unaltered. The politician of our day\r\nis thus described by Dr. Clark:\r\n\r\n     “The perfect type of the American politician is a mixture of the\r\n     demagogue, the intriguer and the jobber; flattering the people,\r\n     locking arms with every surrounding influence and all the time\r\n     looking out for himself.” (_The Machine Abolished_, p. 43.)\r\n\r\nBryce thus sketches the ward politician:\r\n\r\n     “As there are weeds that follow human dwellings, so this species\r\n     thrives best in cities, and even in the most crowded parts of\r\n     cities. It is known to the Americans as the ‘ward politician,’\r\n     because the city ward is the chief sphere of its activity, and the\r\n     ward meeting the first scene of its exploits. A statesman of this\r\n     type usually begins as a saloon or barkeeper, an occupation which\r\n     enables him to form a large circle of acquaintances, especially\r\n     among the ‘loafer’ class who have votes but no reason for using\r\n     them one way more than another, and whose interest in political\r\n     issues is therefore as limited as their stock of political\r\n     knowledge. But he may have started as a lawyer of the lowest kind,\r\n     or lodging-house keeper, or have taken to politics after failure in\r\n     store-keeping. The education of this class is only that of the\r\n     elementary schools; if they have come after boyhood from Europe, it\r\n     is not even that. They have of course no comprehension of political\r\n     questions or zeal for political principles; politics mean to them\r\n     merely a scramble for places or jobs. They are usually vulgar,\r\n     sometimes brutal, not so often criminal, or at least the associates\r\n     of criminals. They it is who move about the populous quarters of\r\n     the great cities, form groups through whom they can reach and\r\n     control the ignorant voter, pack meetings with their creatures.”\r\n...\r\n\r\n     “In the smaller cities and in the country generally, the minor\r\n     politicians are mostly native Americans, less ignorant and more\r\n     respectable than these last-mentioned street vultures. The\r\n     bar-keeping element is represented among them, but the bulk are\r\n     petty lawyers, officials, Federal as well as State and county, and\r\n     people who for want of a better occupation have turned\r\n     office-seekers, with a fair sprinkling of store-keepers, farmers,\r\n     and newspaper men.” ...\r\n\r\n     “These two classes do the local work and dirty work of politics.\r\n     They are the rank and file. Above them stand the officers in the\r\n     political army, the party managers, including the members of\r\n     Congress and chief men in the State legislatures, and the editors\r\n     of influential newspapers. Some of these have pushed their way up\r\n     from the humbler ranks. Others are men of superior ability and\r\n     education, often college graduates, lawyers who have had practice,\r\n     less frequently merchants or manufacturers who have slipped into\r\n     politics from business. There are all sorts among them, creatures\r\n     clean and unclean, as in the sheet of St. Peter’s vision, but that\r\n     one may say of politicians in all countries.” (_American\r\n     Commonwealth_, Vol. II, pp. 63, 64, 65.)\r\n\r\nThe political leaders, says Eaton, endeavor to bring “every form of\r\nhuman depravity, imbecility and ignorance to the polls. They and their\r\nminions search the garrets and the cellars, the prisons and the asylums,\r\nthe grog shops and the poor houses; they lead and hustle to the ballot\r\nboxes the vilest specimens of humanity which can be made to cast a vote”\r\n(_Government of Municipalities_, p. 122), and he adds that some of these\r\nleaders are public officials, some have even been on the bench of\r\njustice as police magistrates. Here is a sketch of a New York district\r\nleader, veracious though imaginary, from the facile pen of O. Henry\r\n(_The Social Triangle_).\r\n\r\n     “Billy McMahan was the district leader. Upon him the Tiger purred,\r\n     and his hand held manna to scatter. Now, as Ikey entered (the bar\r\n     room) McMahan stood, flushed and triumphant and mighty, the center\r\n     of a huzzaing concourse of his lieutenants and constituents. It\r\n     seems there had been an election; a signal victory had been won;\r\n     the city had been swept back into line by a resistless besom of\r\n     ballots. How magnificent was Billy McMahan, with his great smooth\r\n     laughing face; his gray eye shrewd as a chicken hawk’s; his diamond\r\n     ring; his voice like a bugle call; his prince’s air; his plump and\r\n     active roll of money; his clarion call to friend and comrade--oh,\r\n     what a king of men he was! How he obscured his lieutenants, though\r\n     they themselves loomed large and serious, blue of chin and\r\n     important of mien, with hands buried deep in the pockets of their\r\n     short overcoats.”\r\n\r\nBesides the immediate lieutenants of the boss there are in the cities\r\ngangs of “heelers” formed by the political organizations who, as said by\r\nOstrogorski, constitute a latent political force under the management of\r\nhenchmen. They are described by him as ignorant, brutal, averse to\r\nregular work, mostly recruited from the criminal or semi-criminal\r\nclasses, from among frequenters of drinking saloons and from failures\r\nand loafers of every description. When the elections come around they\r\nfurnish compact bands of “floaters” or “repeaters” as they are often\r\ncalled, ready, for a consideration, to vote early and as often as\r\npermitted. Professor Woodburn of Indiana University writing in 1903,\r\nsays that:\r\n\r\n     “A politician has come to mean one devoted not to the science and\r\n     art of government, but to the success of a political party; a party\r\n     worker who devotes himself to the art of making nominations and\r\n     carrying elections; one who manages caucuses, committees and\r\n     conventions, by which the party business and the party machinery\r\n     are carried on. It is because the people have consented to turn\r\n     over their parties and their party government to this self\r\n     constituted class of party managers that they have come under the\r\n     control of rings and bosses.” (_Political Parties and Party\r\n     Problems_, p. 360.)\r\n\r\nHe describes a political ring as a group of these professional\r\npoliticians who live by politics, bound together for mutual support in\r\npursuit of offices, public patronage, contracts and other pecuniary\r\nopportunities, and generally unscrupulous in their methods. The leader\r\nof the ring is the boss, who usually does not hold office but controls\r\nthe offices from outside, by backstairs influence.\r\n\r\nThis from Professor Hyslop:\r\n\r\n     “But the single purpose that animates the average politician is the\r\n     same that inspires the beggar or the thief. Either he has failed\r\n     for want of ability of an honest kind in legitimate methods of\r\n     business and in competition with his fellows, and seeks a public\r\n     salary with freedom to indulge his natural indolence, or he uses\r\n     his ingenuity and abilities to secure the irresponsible power to\r\n     plunder the public with impunity.” (_Democracy_, p. 270.)\r\n\r\nThe purchase of votes and the collection of funds for that purpose has\r\nalways been an important part of the politician’s work. The expression\r\n“bunches of five” has become a byword ever since its use some twenty\r\nyears ago by a prominent Republican politician in reference to delivery\r\nof votes for money. “Frying out the fat” is another striking expression\r\nwhich became current about the same time in the same way and was\r\nintended to be descriptive of the method of getting large sums from\r\ncorporations for use in election purposes. The total amounts thus\r\ncontributed in the past forty years to carry presidential elections\r\nwould probably run into the hundreds of millions. In 1910 President\r\nVreeland of the Metropolitan Street Railway of New York testified before\r\na legislative committee that his company contributed campaign funds to\r\nboth parties. One year it divided about $40,000 between them. This is\r\nnot mentioned as an exceptional instance but as illustrative of a well\r\nknown practice.\r\n\r\nLet us now glance at the great man himself, the real Boss, the magnate,\r\nthe prince of American Democracy, the man who of all men most thoroughly\r\nbelieves in manhood suffrage, understands it and profits by it; one of\r\nthe real political rulers of the American people; he who makes and\r\nunmakes governors, senators and high judges; he for whom sheriffs,\r\naldermen, assemblymen, state senators, and sometimes even our mayors of\r\ncities are glad to run errands and to wait in anterooms. Writing in 1914\r\nGoodnow says of the bosses: “They control the making of laws and their\r\nexecution after they are made.” (_Politics and Administration_, p. 169.)\r\nWhat is a boss like? What are his outward manifestations?\r\n\r\nAbout the best analysis of his character and functions was made by\r\nProfessor Reinsch of Wisconsin, as follows:\r\n\r\n     “Sooner or later there is evolved the boss, the fruit and flower of\r\n     commercial politics in America. He represents the main interest but\r\n     also holds the balance between the minor tributary groups. The\r\n     secrecy necessary for his work gives him great power. He alone\r\n     holds all the threads that bind the system together. In his person\r\n     are united the confidence of the favored interests and the hopes of\r\n     his political lieutenants. He commands the source of supplies. He\r\n     has mastered the study of political psychology and knows by\r\n     intimate experience the personal character of the prominent\r\n     politicians in the state. Most of them are dependent upon him for\r\n     future favors or are bound to him through past indiscretions. The\r\n     character of the system demands an absolute ruler. For this reason,\r\n     too, the power of the boss is continuous; it is rarely overthrown\r\n     from within and only a great public upheaval can affect it. Bosses\r\n     maintain themselves in the saddle and enjoy a long lease of power,\r\n     because of their direct and confidential relations with the\r\n     controlling interests; their inborn secretiveness leads them to\r\n     keep their own counsel, and not to allow any other person a\r\n     complete insight into all the intricacies of the system. They grow\r\n     stronger as the years pass and no indiscretion or even crime is\r\n     able to shake their authority while they keep in their hands the\r\n     main threads connecting influence with its obedient tools. The\r\n     abler men of this type are filled with a keen sense of the irony of\r\n     their position. They have the clear insight into the coarser\r\n     actualities of politics that characterized Machiavelli. The\r\n     political exhorter who sways the multitudes from the stump does not\r\n     become a boss; to achieve that position the power of cool analysis,\r\n     of impassive control, and of unflinching execution, are more\r\n     essential than any gifts of popular leadership.” (_American\r\n     Legislatures and Legislative Methods_, pp. 236, 237.)\r\n\r\nAnother sketch:\r\n\r\n     “It must not be supposed that the members of Rings, or the great\r\n     Boss himself are wicked men. They are the offspring of a system.\r\n     Their morality is that of their surroundings. They see a door open\r\n     to wealth and power, and they walk in. The obligations of\r\n     patriotism or duty to the public are not disregarded by them, for\r\n     these obligations have never been present to their minds. A State\r\n     boss is usually a native American and a person of some education,\r\n     who avoids the grosser forms of corruption, though he has to wink\r\n     at them when practised by his friends. He may be a man of personal\r\n     integrity. A city boss is often of foreign birth and humble origin;\r\n     he has grown up in an atmosphere of oaths and cocktails; ideas of\r\n     honour and purity are as strange to him as ideas about the nature\r\n     of the currency and the incidence of taxation; politics is merely a\r\n     means for getting and distributing places.” (Bryce, _American\r\n     Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 110.)\r\n\r\nUnder the supervision of the political boss blackmail is levied for\r\nparty purposes from gambling houses, saloons and houses of ill repute.\r\nHe is not primarily concerned with political opinions. He controls his\r\nbest men by their interests. It is his business to carry the elections\r\nand thus get power and places for self and followers. He is able to\r\ndismiss almost any politician from office and to close his political\r\ncareer. He and not the people is the real master of the inferior\r\noffice-holders. “At all hazards he must prevent the incoming of an\r\nhonest administration that will apply the public offices for public\r\nuses.” For this purpose the bosses of opposite parties unite when\r\nnecessary. Woodburn mentions an instance of this in Philadelphia in\r\n1901, and adds referring to the boss:\r\n\r\n     “Those who support him have their reward--the laborer gets his job,\r\n     the placeman office; the policeman his promotion or his “divvy”;\r\n     the contractor a chance at the public works; the banker the use of\r\n     the public money; the gambler and the criminal immunity from\r\n     prosecution; the honest merchant certain sidewalk privileges; the\r\n     rich corporations lowered assessments and immunity from equitable\r\n     taxation. All buy these special favors by support of the Boss’s\r\n     power and policy, and all enjoy the blessings of the Boss’s\r\n     government, high taxation, maladministration, stolen franchises,\r\n     robbery of the public treasury, and criminal disorder in the\r\n     community.” (_Political Parties and Party Platforms_, p. 364.)\r\n\r\nIn an article in the _Outlook_, April 2, 1898, Miss Jane Addams of\r\nChicago, a well-known settlement worker, writing no doubt from personal\r\nobservation, describes the Boss as an institution of American politics\r\nin similar language to that of Professor Woodburn. She depicts the\r\ntypical city political boss, his personality and good-natured\r\nfreebooting methods with piquancy and vigor; he is, she says, a\r\nsuccessful boodler who is popular with the poor because in their\r\nignorance they suppose that he only robs the rich while to the poor he\r\nis a sympathetic friend; or as they say, he has a good heart. The reader\r\ncan easily trace for himself the direct connection between this point of\r\nview of the lower classes and their support of Tweed, the robber\r\npolitician whom a New York City district triumphantly elected state\r\nsenator shortly after his rascalities were exposed. With that connection\r\nin mind the relation between the power of the boss and universal\r\nsuffrage is perfectly apparent. The class of voters brought in by\r\nunqualified suffrage prefer friendly bosses and free-handed boodlers to\r\nmen who are governed by motives so superior to their own as to seem to\r\nthem visionary or fantastic; who have in their pockets no stolen or easy\r\ngot cash to squander on their followers, and who not being professional\r\n“handshakers” seem to the masses lacking in sympathy for common men.\r\n\r\nBut there is a power greater even than the Boss; and that is the\r\nMachine, a creation which has reached its highest development in our own\r\ntime and of which the greatest politicians speak with awe. Theodore\r\nRoosevelt, the “Big Bull Moose,” was a big politician, a glorified Boss;\r\nbut he went down at Chicago in 1912 crushed by the steam roller\r\nattachment of the Machine. “For the Roller came and with great eclat it\r\nlaid that turrible animile flat,” was the doggerel verdict of a\r\nnewspaper of that day.\r\n\r\n     “The tremendous power of party organization has been described. It\r\n     enslaves local officials, it increases the tendency to regard\r\n     members of Congress as mere delegates, it keeps men of independent\r\n     character out of local and national politics, it puts bad men into\r\n     place, it perverts the wishes of the people, it has in some places\r\n     set up a tyranny under the forms of democracy.” (Bryce, _American\r\n     Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 612.)\r\n\r\nThe word “machine” indicates its character.\r\n\r\n     “The professional politicians (says Ostrogorski) operated, under\r\n     the direction of the managers, and the wire pullers with such\r\n     uniformity and with such indifference or insensibility to right and\r\n     wrong, that they evoked the idea of a piece of mechanism working\r\n     automatically and blindly; of a machine; the effect appeared so\r\n     precisely identical, that the term “machine” was foisted on the\r\n     Organization as a nick-name which it bears down to the present\r\n     day.” (_Democracy_, p. 60.)\r\n\r\nIn this machine the voter is a very small cog; he neither devised the\r\nmachine, nor can he in the least control it, nor is it constructed to\r\nserve his interests. It is organized in the interests of discipline and\r\non the principle of obedience. In New York, for instance, an important\r\npart of the Tammany Machine is the Committee on Organization, composed\r\nof the leaders of certain wards and districts, each one of whom either\r\nholds a public office or has a valuable public contract or is in some\r\nway dependent on the Boss for his yearly income. The committee man looks\r\nafter his district and is responsible to the Boss for its vote. Not by\r\nthe people but by the political machines are offices filled, laws\r\nenacted, government carried on. The machine discipline though sometimes\r\nsevere operates on the whole for the benefit of the politician by\r\nprotecting the faithful. The efficient members of the class of\r\nprofessional politicians are never more than temporarily shelved. If\r\ndefeated at one election they are chosen at another. If they fail to get\r\none office, room is made for them somewhere else, and so they are made\r\nto form a class of permanent office-holders, and the power and\r\nefficiency of the political oligarchy are steadily maintained.\r\n\r\n     “The City machine makes friends with saloon keepers, with gamblers\r\n     and other criminal classes, or with large financial institutions,\r\n     seeking to obtain control of the vast sums expended for public\r\n     improvements. This source of revenue has of late proved vastly more\r\n     fruitful than the earlier and more primitive methods. By means of\r\n     these various alliances a large body of pledged supporters is\r\n     secured. In addition to ordinary party officers the machine employs\r\n     a body of workers formerly known as ward heelers now more generally\r\n     called workers, gangs, gunmen, or district leaders, some of whom\r\n     are accustomed to commit various sorts of crime, such as securing\r\n     fraudulent naturalization papers for foreigners, entering\r\n     fictitious names on the register of voters, organizing repeaters\r\n     and voting them on election day.” (_Cyclopedia American Political\r\n     Government_, Machine, Political, 1914.)\r\n\r\nWe quote once more from Bryce, writing in 1894, as to the operation of\r\nmachine rule in New York City:\r\n\r\n     “Such an organization as this, with its tentacles touching every\r\n     point in a vast and amorphous city, is evidently a most potent\r\n     force, especially as this force is concentrated in one hand--that\r\n     of the Boss of the Hall. He is practically autocratic; and under\r\n     him these thousands of officers, controlling from 120,000 to\r\n     150,000 votes, move with the precision of a machine. However, it is\r\n     not only in this mechanism, which may be called a legitimate method\r\n     of reaching the voters, that the strength of Tammany lies. Its\r\n     control of the city government gives it endless opportunities of\r\n     helping its friends, of worrying its opponents, and of enslaving\r\n     the liquor-dealers. Their licenses are at its mercy, for the police\r\n     can proceed against or wink at breaches of the law, according to\r\n     the amount of loyalty the saloon-keeper shows to the Hall. From the\r\n     contributions of the liquor interest a considerable revenue is\r\n     raised; more is obtained by assessing office-holders, down to the\r\n     very small ones; and perhaps most of all by blackmailing wealthy\r\n     men and corporations, who find that the city authorities have so\r\n     many opportunities of interfering vexatiously with their business\r\n     that they prefer to buy them off and live in peace. The worst form\r\n     of this extortion is the actual complicity with criminals which\r\n     consists in sharing the profits of crime. A fruitful source of\r\n     revenue, roughly estimated at $1,000,000 a year, is derived, when\r\n     the party is supreme at Albany, from legislative blackmailing in\r\n     the legislature, or, rather, from undertaking to protect the great\r\n     corporations from the numerous ‘strikers,’ who threaten them there\r\n     with bills. A case has been mentioned in which as much as $60,000\r\n     was demanded from a great company; and the president of another is\r\n     reported to have said (1893): ‘Formerly we had to keep a man at\r\n     Albany to buy off the “strikers” one by one. This year we simply\r\n     paid over a lump sum to the Ring, and they looked after our\r\n     interests.’ But of all their engines of power none is so elastic as\r\n     their command of the administration of criminal justice. The mayor\r\n     appoints the police justices, usually selecting them from certain\r\n     Tammany workers, sometimes from the criminal class, not often from\r\n     the legal profession. These justices are often Tammany leaders in\r\n     their respective districts.” ...\r\n\r\n     “With such sources of power it is not surprising that Tammany Hall\r\n     commands the majority of the lower and the foreign masses of New\r\n     York, though it has never been shown to hold an absolute majority\r\n     of all the voters of the city. Its local strength is exactly\r\n     proportioned to the character of the local population; and though\r\n     there are plenty of native Americans among the rank and file as\r\n     well as among the leaders, still it is from the poorer districts,\r\n     inhabited by Jews, Irish, Germans, Italians, Bohemians, that its\r\n     heaviest vote comes.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, pp.\r\n     398-400.)\r\n\r\nA booklet published in 1887 gives some account of the organization of\r\nthe political machines of New York City, showing that they all depend\r\nupon the use of a minority controllable vote presumably of men without\r\nsubstantial means and whose political support is therefore purchasable\r\nin one way or another. The writer says:\r\n\r\n     “The machine is governed by a singleness of purpose which produces\r\n     a compactness against which good citizens can only break themselves\r\n     to pieces when fighting it from within, while if they organize an\r\n     outside opposition in which everything is done by honest\r\n     discussion, compactness is almost impossible of achievement.... The\r\n     politicians would not be difficult to beat if the people would\r\n     organize for their own protection and from principle; but it is the\r\n     matter of organization which is difficult, and no one understands\r\n     this better than the bosses,” (Ivins, _Machine Politics_.)\r\n\r\nThe machine is not peculiar to the cities:\r\n\r\n     “It is also found at the court house of the rural county, at the\r\n     cross roads postoffice, the village store, the town hall. The\r\n     difference is one of degree; the mechanism is everywhere the\r\n     same.... The corrupt political machine of today controlled by a\r\n     boss is contrary to the American system of government, and were it\r\n     not a terrible reality this creation would be deemed an\r\n     impossibility. It is in its present state of perfection, rule of\r\n     the people by the individual for the boss, his relatives and\r\n     friends. It is the most complete political despotism ever known.”\r\n     (Coler on _Municipal Government_, 1900, pp. 188-190.)\r\n\r\nNor is the use of the machine confined to the Democratic party; even in\r\nNew York it is part of the Republican party system also. In an address\r\ndelivered in New York May 2d, 1880, George William Curtis described the\r\nRepublican political machine and its operations, how it practically\r\nexcluded nearly nine-tenths of the Republican voters from the primaries.\r\nHe stated that the bosses were “huge contractors of votes, traders and\r\nhucksters in place and pelf,” who “made personal servility the condition\r\nof political success” and were ready to “betray the party by bargaining\r\nwith the enemy”; “that good men stayed at home feeling” that “politics\r\nare tiresome and dirty and politicians vulgar bullies and bravadoes”;\r\nthat “public officers multiply uselessly that there may be more rewards\r\nfor political and personal service. Primaries, caucuses, conventions,\r\nare controlled by the promise and expectation of a chance of plunder\r\nwhich the machine distributes.” Here is an account of how the votes of\r\nworking men were used in Philadelphia by the Republican boss McManes, to\r\nbuild up a corrupt political organization:\r\n\r\n     “This gentleman, Mr. James McManes, having gained influence among\r\n     the humbler voters, was appointed one of the Gas Trustees, and soon\r\n     managed to bring the whole of that department under his control. It\r\n     employed (I was told) about two thousand persons, received large\r\n     sums, and gave out large contracts. Appointing his friends and\r\n     dependents to the chief places under the Trust, and requiring them\r\n     to fill the ranks of its ordinary workmen with persons on whom they\r\n     could rely, the Boss acquired the control of a considerable number\r\n     of votes and of a large annual revenue. He and his confederates\r\n     then purchased a controlling interest in the principal horse-car\r\n     (street tramway) company of the city, whereby they became masters\r\n     of a large number of additional voters. All these voters were of\r\n     course expected to act as ‘workers,’ i.e., they occupied themselves\r\n     with the party organization of the city, they knew the meanest\r\n     streets and those who dwelt therein, they attended and swayed the\r\n     primaries, and when an election came round, they canvassed and\r\n     brought up the voters. Their power, therefore, went far beyond\r\n     their mere voting strength, for a hundred energetic ‘workers’ mean\r\n     at least a thousand votes. With so much strength behind them, the\r\n     Gas Ring, and Mr. McManes at its head, became not merely\r\n     indispensable to the Republican party in the city, but in fact its\r\n     chiefs, able therefore to dispose of the votes of all those who\r\n     were employed permanently or temporarily in the other departments\r\n     of the city government--a number which one hears estimated as high\r\n     as twenty thousand. Nearly all the municipal offices were held by\r\n     their nominees. They commanded a majority in the Select council and\r\n     Common council. They managed the nomination of members of the State\r\n     legislature. Even the Federal officials in the custom-house and\r\n     post-office were forced into a dependent alliance with them,\r\n     because their support was so valuable to the leaders in Federal\r\n     politics that it had to be purchased by giving them their way in\r\n     city affairs.” (Bryce, _American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 405.)\r\n\r\n     “Machine politics are completely subversive both of democracy and\r\n     of the principle of responsibility for which democracy is supposed\r\n     to stand. It constitutes nothing except a system of self-appointed\r\n     rulers, and the principle of elective representation of which we\r\n     boast becomes a farce. Public servants and officers can in some\r\n     way, usually, be made responsible for the administration of\r\n     government, but political bosses never, or at least not until they\r\n     have retired with plunder enough to live without politics. The\r\n     despotism of Russia can lay some claim to legitimacy. The Czar\r\n     obtains his throne and power by the forms of law and has a healthy\r\n     fear of something, but not so with our bosses. They nominate our\r\n     candidates for office and mortgage their support, so that we are\r\n     ruled by men who are not elected to govern us at all, our nominal\r\n     officers being the mere puppets of the machine. Public opinion is\r\n     defied until its patience is exhausted, when it is gratified in\r\n     some caprice and it lapses back again into indifference and the old\r\n     game goes on. Property of all kinds is blackmailed directly or\r\n     indirectly, and business terrorized. Even vice and crime come in\r\n     for tribute as is well known. This is anarchy, not government, and\r\n     yet we indulge the pleasing illusion that democracy is a paradise.”\r\n     (Hyslop, _Democracy_, pp. 32-33.)\r\n\r\nAnd further:\r\n\r\n     “It is the insolent disregard of public welfare, the deliberate\r\n     exclusion of intelligent and honest men from office, the refusal to\r\n     reason about public policy, the shameless corruption of its\r\n     leaders, its organized methods of deception, bribery, and blackmail\r\n     with public jobbery and frauds upon the tax-payers, that make\r\n     machine politics so despicable in the estimation of the public\r\n     conscience.” (_Idem_, p. 268.)\r\n\r\nAll nominations for public office to be voted on by the people are made\r\nby a machine whatever may be the party in whose name they are made. This\r\nis true not only of the high offices, such as president, governor,\r\nsenator, etc., but also of such lower offices as mayor, judges of the\r\nstate courts, state senators and assemblymen. Sometimes these\r\nnominations are made at primaries which are carried by the boss through\r\nthe local organizations; or at political conventions also controlled by\r\nthe machine. The details of the secret manipulations under the recent\r\nprimary laws have not yet been and may never be published and exposed;\r\nbut those of the old political conventions were laid bare in a book\r\npublished in 1899 by Senator Breen, an experienced politician of New\r\nYork. He there describes the power of the bosses and the subserviency of\r\nthe masses.\r\n\r\n     “There is scarcely a place on earth (says Breen) where one can see\r\n     so fully the extremes of sycophancy to which human nature will\r\n     descend as one does in a political convention in the City of New\r\n     York.... I blush to record the fact that the convention which I\r\n     attended (and the same may be said of every political convention in\r\n     this city even at the present day) was composed of as spineless a\r\n     lot of creatures as ever prostrated themselves before a throne, or\r\n     crouched in the presence of autocratic power. Subserviency was\r\n     shown not only to the local leader or deputy boss himself, but to\r\n     the understrappers, who were supposed to have his ear. Not able to\r\n     get into the immediate presence of the leader, persons well dressed\r\n     and apparently prosperous, as well as those who were ill\r\n     conditioned, fawned upon forbidding looking beings who were\r\n     supposed to be close to the leader, and whose intelligence was\r\n     limited to understanding orders and obeying them....\r\n\r\n     “Several positions connected with the court were at the disposal of\r\n     the judge to be elected; the Democratic nomination was equivalent\r\n     to the certificate of election. There were 177 delegates in all,\r\n     and although many of them had the appearance of independent men,\r\n     yet every one of them was there as an automaton to be set in\r\n     motion and shifted hither and thither at the whim of the local\r\n     boss. Free born citizens, though they were, with the sacred right\r\n     of the ballot, they were there merely to register his will and obey\r\n     his orders without question. Not only this, but they seemed to\r\n     revel in their subserviency, and to feel joyous and even proud of\r\n     the distinction of being political slaves. Nor was this degradation\r\n     confined to the ignorant. Men of education, men who were members of\r\n     the learned professions, were in that body, and vied with the worst\r\n     in snivelling sycophancy. They knew, as every one knew, that the\r\n     person who was to be nominated for a seat on the bench was wholly\r\n     incompetent, in point of education and training, to fill the\r\n     office, not to speak of other disqualifications. Yet they were\r\n     there to obey pliantly the mandates of a deputy boss and stifle\r\n     their conviction and their conscience.” (_Thirty Years of New York\r\n     Politics_, pp. 205, 206, 207.)\r\n\r\nHere you have a veracious picture made by an expert of the actual\r\noperation of manhood suffrage, which according to the twaddlers is so\r\neffective in stimulating the manly character of the citizens of a free\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\nBryce visited one of these conventions, and this is what he saw:\r\n\r\n     “During the morning, a tremendous coming and going and chattering\r\n     and clattering of crowds of men who looked at once sordid and\r\n     flashy, faces shrewd but mean and sometimes brutal, vulgar figures\r\n     in good coats forming into small groups and talking eagerly, and\r\n     then dissolving to form fresh groups; a universal _camaraderie_,\r\n     with no touch of friendship about it; something between a\r\n     betting-ring and the flags outside the Liverpool Exchange. It\r\n     reminded one of the swarming of bees in tree boughs, a ceaseless\r\n     humming and buzzing which betokens immense excitement over\r\n     proceedings which the bystander does not comprehend. After some\r\n     hours all this settled down; the meeting was duly organized;\r\n     speeches were made, all dull and thinly declamatory, except one by\r\n     an eloquent Irishman; the candidates for State offices were\r\n     proposed and carried by acclamation; and the business ended.\r\n     Everything had evidently been pre-arranged; and the discontented,\r\n     if any there were, had been talked over during the swarming\r\n     hours.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 105.)\r\n\r\nThe members of these nominating conventions, or “delegates,” as they are\r\ncalled, are supposed to be chosen by the voters at elections held for\r\nthat purpose, called “primaries.” The vote at these primaries is never\r\nmore than a fraction of those belonging to the party. It ranges from two\r\nper cent to ten per cent unless when there is a contest between two\r\nparty men, when it may go as high as forty per cent of those entitled to\r\nvote. Outside of the party workers, scarcely anyone attends these\r\nprimaries. Bryce sketches the means taken by the boss to control the\r\nprimary election, which include trickery, fraud and violence. (_American\r\nCommonwealth_, Vol. II, pp. 102, 103.) He describes the workings of the\r\nprimary system and the convention as in operation in Philadelphia under\r\nthe management of the Gas Ring in 1881:\r\n\r\n     “The delegates chosen were usually office-holders, with a\r\n     sprinkling of public works contractors, liquor-dealers, always a\r\n     potent factor in ward politics, and office expectants. For\r\n     instance, the Convention of 13th January, 1881, for nominating a\r\n     candidate for mayor, consisted of 199 delegates, 86 of whom were\r\n     connected with some branch of the city government, 9 were members\r\n     of the city councils, 5 were police magistrates, 4 constables, and\r\n     23 policemen, while of the rest some were employed in some other\r\n     city department, and some others were the known associates and\r\n     dependants of the Ring. These delegates, assembled in convention of\r\n     the party, duly went through the farce of selecting and voting for\r\n     persons already determined on by the Ring as candidates for the\r\n     chief offices. The persons so selected thereby became the\r\n     authorized candidates of the party, for whom every good party man\r\n     was expected to give his vote. Disgusted he might be to find a\r\n     person unknown, or known only for evil, perhaps a fraudulent\r\n     bankrupt, or a broken-down barkeeper, proposed for his acceptance.\r\n     But as his only alternative was to vote for the Democratic nominee,\r\n     who was probably no better, he submitted, and thus the party was\r\n     forced to ratify the choice of the Boss.” (_American Commonwealth_,\r\n     Vol. II, p. 408.)\r\n\r\nThe method adopted by the local boss in Breen’s time, to assure himself\r\nthat every man in the convention would do his bidding, is worthy of\r\nadmiration for its bold and unscrupulous impudence. He does this, says\r\nBreen, in advance of the primary election by making out a list of the\r\ndelegates whom he desires chosen and obtaining from the inspectors a\r\ncertificate that they have been duly elected. What occurs thereafter at\r\nthe primary election is of little consequence as the credentials are\r\nalready in the possession of the leader, who when the convention meets\r\ndraws them from his pocket and as there is no going behind the returns\r\nthe delegates take their seats. Times and laws have changed since\r\nBreen’s time and this plan may have been superseded by another, at\r\npresent not generally known, but the Boss and Machine are still with us\r\nas powerful as ever; the class of officials they put over us is the same\r\nas before, there is the same material to work with and it is presumable\r\nthat the present system is equally corrupt and tyrannical with the old\r\none.\r\n\r\nA large part of the fuel to keep the machine going is provided for by\r\nvoluntary contributions from business men and corporations desirous of\r\npolitical favors, such as street privileges, franchises, contracts, or\r\nis levied as blackmail upon them or upon saloon keepers, gamblers,\r\nkeepers of brothels and others whose habits or occupations leave them\r\nopen to police persecution; also by assessments on office holders,\r\ncandidates for office and levies on corporations sometimes called\r\n“strikes.”\r\n\r\n     “The levying of blackmail on companies, either as a contribution to\r\n     campaign expenses or as fees to pay for protection, is now one of\r\n     the principal sources of a Boss’s revenue, and, in states like New\r\n     York, goes a good way towards enabling him to defy hostile\r\n     sentiment. It furnishes him with funds for subsidizing the\r\n     legislature and the press.” (_Atlantic Monthly_, July, 1896.)\r\n\r\nBryce states that the collection of revenues of a political Ring flow\r\nfrom five sources, viz., public subscriptions, contributions from\r\ncontractors and others expecting favors, surreptitious appropriations\r\nfrom the city or state treasury, assessments upon the office holders,\r\nand sale of offices and nominations to office. Breen says truly in the\r\nbook already quoted that the majority of voters are utterly unaware of\r\nwhat is really going on in the party. There are, he says, “scarcely\r\n5,000 persons in the City of New York who are aware of the secret and\r\nsurreptitious methods governing the inside of politics or of the\r\nsubterranean channels thereto by which gross wrongs are perpetrated. The\r\nsecret combinations, conspiracies, deals and bribery are confined to the\r\nexpert politician.” How few, for instance, know the facts in relation to\r\nthe practice of the barter of high offices. One of the inevitable\r\nresults of the development of the present system is the sale of\r\nnominations to public office negotiated by the boss for the benefit of\r\nthe machine. The existence of this traffic though secretly conducted is\r\nwell known in political circles. Sometimes the payment is direct;\r\nsometimes it is disguised in the shape of contributions to campaign\r\nfunds made by the candidate or someone in his behalf.\r\n\r\n     “In the large cities, with New York at their head, practice\r\n     established a sort of tariff for each set of offices according to\r\n     the length of the term and the importance of the place. Thus a\r\n     judgeship, that is to say, the nomination to it amounted to\r\n     $15,000; a seat in Congress was rated at $4,000; for membership of\r\n     a state legislature $1,500 was demanded; a like amount for the\r\n     position of alderman in a city council, etc.” (Ostrogorski, _Idem_,\r\n     p. 70.)\r\n\r\n     “Candidates for the judiciary in New York City have paid Tammany\r\n     Hall $5,000 to $10,000 for their offices.” (_Commons on\r\n     Proportional Representation_, p. 303.)\r\n\r\nDr. Clark writing in 1900 says:\r\n\r\n     “By credible accounts as much as $100,000 has been paid to get\r\n     nominated by the Convention of the dominant party for Clerk,\r\n     Register or Sheriff of the County of New York; half that sum for\r\n     Treasurer of Pennsylvania, and, in proportion to their\r\n     opportunities for others the like offices all over the country. A\r\n     seat on the Supreme Judicial bench costs from $5,000 to $15,000. A\r\n     nomination to Congress from the lean pastures of Vermont or New\r\n     Hampshire can sometimes be had for a thousand dollars, but in the\r\n     golden fields of California and Nevada it has cost fifty thousand.”\r\n     (_The Machine Abolished_, p. 40.)\r\n\r\nThe figures contained in Bryce’s _American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p.\r\n119, as to ruling rates for political nominations under this much prized\r\nsystem of political brigandage are these: Alderman, $1,500; Legislature,\r\n$500 to $1,500; Judgeship, $5,000 to $15,000; Congress, $4,000. The New\r\nYork County Clerk at one time collected about $80,000 a year in fees, of\r\nwhich the political machine required him to hand over two-thirds.\r\nWriting in 1899 Dorman B. Eaton states the regular price of a high\r\njudicial nomination is $10,000 to $15,000. (_Government of\r\nMunicipalities_, p. 107.) Another more recent writer gives the figures\r\nfor political assessments for the large city as follows: For County\r\nClerk and Register, $15,000; Alderman, $13,000; Sheriff, $25,000;\r\nComptroller, $10,000; Mayor, $20,000; Police Justice, $6,500.\r\n\r\nNot only the offices but the party itself is sometimes for sale in this\r\nor that ward or city. The bargains between the Republican and Democratic\r\nmachines in New York City and elsewhere have been so frequently\r\ndenounced and exposed by the politicians themselves as to need no proof.\r\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that the bosses are able at times in\r\nshrewd transactions with opposing bosses to barter certain public\r\noffices, batches of offices and measures for other similar merchandise,\r\nand to carry out the bargain; thus causing the votes cast at an election\r\nto have directly the opposite effect from that supposed to be desired by\r\nthe voters, though perhaps many of the floaters or regulars among them\r\nwould be perfectly satisfied with the “deal.” It must be borne in mind\r\nthat the ultimate object of all these “deals” and this political traffic\r\nis money; the party managers are not looking for public honors but for\r\ncash; they are actually engaged in building up fortunes for themselves\r\nand their backers, who are public contractors and the like. “Hence it is\r\nthe opportunity and desire for public pelf, directly or indirectly, and\r\nfor gratifying personal ambition without reference to public service,\r\nthat are the most potent influences in the formation and cohesiveness of\r\nthe ‘machine.’” (_Democracy_, p. 269.)\r\n\r\nAn instance of the friendly relations between rival machines is\r\nmentioned by Bryce in writing of the effort to get the Democratic\r\nmachine in Philadelphia in 1870 to help oust the Republican Gas Ring:\r\n\r\n     “But the Democratic wire-pullers, being mostly men of the same\r\n     stamp as the Gas Ring, did not seek a temporary gain at the expense\r\n     of a permanent disparagement of their own class. Political\r\n     principles are the last thing which the professional city\r\n     politician cares for. It was better worth the while of the\r\n     Democratic chiefs to wait for their turn, and in the meantime to\r\n     get something out of occasional bargains with their (nominal)\r\n     Republican opponents, than to strengthen the cause of good\r\n     government at the expense of the professional class.” (_American\r\n     Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 411.)\r\n\r\nAnd Eaton mentions an instance in New York City of the leaders of one\r\npolitical party being in the pay of the other. (_Government of\r\nMunicipalities_, p. 116--Note.)\r\n\r\nHere, to make the sketch complete must be said a brief word about the\r\nlobby, by which expressive term is designated the class of paid agents\r\nof public service corporations and others, who frequent the lobbies of\r\nthe state legislatures and of Congress in order to promote legislation\r\nfavorable to their principals and to watch and fend off “strikes,”\r\n“hold-ups” and other legislative attacks upon them. In a country where\r\nridiculously small salaries are paid to members of legislative bodies\r\nthe lobby does much to make a legislator’s career profitable. Details of\r\nthose lobby transactions have been often published as newspaper\r\nsensations, and some of them will be referred to in this book later on.\r\nA short quotation from Prof. Commons will suffice here to give an idea\r\nof their character:\r\n\r\n     “It is not to be inferred that the lobby alone is responsible for\r\n     corrupt legislatures and councils. It is equally true that corrupt\r\n     legislatures are responsible for the lobby. Law-makers introduce\r\n     bills attacking corporations for the express purpose of forcing a\r\n     bribe. This is called a ‘strike,’ and has become a recognized\r\n     feature of American legislation, to meet which the corporations are\r\n     compelled to organize their lobby.” (Commons, _Proportional\r\n     Representation_, p. 47.)\r\n\r\nA word from Bryce, on the lobby:\r\n\r\n     “All legislative bodies which control important pecuniary interests\r\n     are as sure to have a lobby as an army to have its camp followers.\r\n     Where the body is, there will the vultures be gathered together.\r\n     Great and wealthy States, like New York, and Pennsylvania, support\r\n     the largest and most active lobbies.... Thus there are at\r\n     Washington, says Mr. Spofford, ‘pension lobbyists, tariff\r\n     lobbyists, steamship subsidy lobbyists, railway lobbyists, Indian\r\n     ring lobbyists, patent lobbyists, river and harbour lobbyists,\r\n     mining lobbyists, bank lobbyists, mail-contract lobbyists, war\r\n     damages lobbyists, back-pay and bounty lobbyists, Isthmus canal\r\n     lobbyists, public building lobbyists, State claims lobbyists,\r\n     cotton-tax lobbyists, and French spoliations lobbyists. Of the\r\n     office-seeking lobbyists at Washington it may be said that their\r\n     name is legion. There are even artist lobbyists, bent upon\r\n     wheedling Congress into buying bad paintings and worse sculptures;\r\n     and too frequently with success.’”\r\n\r\nHe also says that women are said to be among the most active and\r\nsuccessful lobbyists at Washington, and that they have been widely\r\nemployed and efficient in soliciting members of the Legislature with a\r\nview to the passing of private bills and the obtaining of places.\r\n(_American Commonwealth_, Vol. I, p. 680; Vol. II, p. 732.)\r\n\r\nSo here let us end the chapter on the politicians, with the picture of a\r\npurchasable legislature created by a political machine and representing\r\na purchasable manhood suffrage constituency, and of the traffic\r\nconducted by bosses and rings on one side and a lobby on the other.\r\nGranted American activity, and enterprise in public improvements to\r\ncause the stream of dollars to flow steadily, and what more is required\r\nto produce what Mr. Carnegie happily dubs “Triumphant Democracy”?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n     THE EFFECT OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE IS TO FASTEN ON THE COUNTRY AND MAKE\r\n     PERMANENT THE RULE OF THE POLITICIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political oligarchies rule, have ruled and will continue to rule\r\nthis country through the medium of the controllable vote. This is\r\nplainly inferable from what has already been said about the strength and\r\noperations of the Machine, and is in a vague way to some extent\r\nunderstood or at least suspected throughout the country. The object of\r\nthis chapter is to emphasize it, to bring it home to the reader, to make\r\nhim realize it, and to cause him to reflect upon it, and to thoroughly\r\nappreciate the absolute impossibility of throwing off the odious bondage\r\nof the politicians unless and until the suffrage is restricted to a\r\nwell-qualified class of voters.\r\n\r\nBy the extension of the franchise to the unpropertied and thriftless\r\nclass there was injected into the veins of the electoral body a new and\r\npoisonous element, the virus of cupidity. A certain portion of this\r\nclass, the so-called floaters, is directly purchasable; another large\r\nportion is indirectly purchasable or controllable and capable of being\r\norganized on a basis of bargains made or understood. The vote therefore\r\nwhich by degrees as the organizations have developed has come to adhere\r\nto these predatory bands is not confined merely to the directly\r\npurchasable; it includes the controllables; all such as the organization\r\nreaches by the manipulation of low motives; by appeals to cupidity\r\ndirect or indirect; by favors to themselves or their relatives, by\r\nrewards of public employment, whether as laborers, petty officers,\r\npolicemen, firemen or the like; by protection, as in the case of\r\ngamblers, liquor sellers, and others who adhere to the organization for\r\npurposes of personal advantage. The organization therefore will always\r\nbe permanent and effective because its members are materially interested\r\nin its existence and power.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the controllable vote is marshalled to the polls is\r\ndescribed by Eaton (_Govt. of Municipalities_, chap. V). Its existence\r\nis recognized by him as a reason why our great cities are not fit for\r\nhome rule. He divides this vote into two classes: “the mercenary city\r\nvote” and “the vile city vote.” But this material is not confined to the\r\nlarge cities, it is to be found in towns and villages and wherever there\r\nare worthless, shiftless men. Writing in 1871 Sterne says: “The\r\nnomination for public offices is with us entirely in the hands of\r\nprofessional politicians” and this he states to be the case equally in\r\nboth the country and cities. (_Representative Government_, p. 83.) The\r\nconditions have not changed since his time. The local political\r\nassociations or bands organized for the securing, management and\r\noperation of the controllable vote have developed in the last century.\r\nThey are now frequently able, especially in the large cities, to secure\r\na considerable class of recruits of a type somewhat superior to the\r\n“floaters,” from among the social failures and misfits. Most of these\r\nare sloppy-minded fellows, who, tempted by social proclivities, or\r\nmisled by weak ambitions and the appearance of political success, join\r\nthe “Regular Organization” as they call it. Some of them are rather\r\nvicious; social degenerates or perverts; men who have not judgment and\r\nhonesty enough to insure their voting right even in matters small enough\r\nto be within their mental grasp; and whose ideals are not honesty,\r\njustice, public honor, and intelligence, but smartness, cleverness and\r\nguile. Sometimes they are motived by prejudice and class hatred; often\r\nthey are rabid, loud-mouthed radicals, anti-capitalists, etc. Others are\r\nweak and shiftless, people naturally harmless but incapable of correct\r\nobservation in political and economic matters, or of correct reasoning\r\nupon what they observe; men who are recognized as failures in the world,\r\nmore or less incapable of self-support; burdens on their relatives and\r\nfriends, or on churches or societies with which they or their families\r\nare connected; men who never can get employment, or if they do, cannot\r\nkeep it; fellows of lazy and careless habits who having failed to do\r\ntheir part in organized society have had to pay the penalty of their\r\nremissness. There are those who have got into a mental habit of chronic\r\ndissatisfaction with the established ethics of life and have finally\r\ngrown to disbelieve in them altogether; who doubt whether honesty is the\r\nbest policy; who are unable to recognize what it is that really\r\nconstitutes success, or who fail to find the true path to reach it. To\r\nsome of them the man who gets power or money at any price is the\r\nsuccessful man and him they envy and applaud. They themselves hate to\r\nwork or to deny themselves, merely in order to save or to accumulate;\r\nand yet they want money, and long for its possession, and finally grow\r\nto actually respect successful rogues political and other who seem to\r\ndefy and triumph over the old established rules of social life. Bryce\r\ndescribes these organizations as he found them in New York City in 1894:\r\n\r\n     “In each of the thirty districts there is a party headquarters for\r\n     the Committee and the local party work, and usually, also, a\r\n     clubhouse, where party loyalty is cemented over cards and whisky,\r\n     besides a certain number of local ‘associations,’ called after\r\n     prominent local politicians, who are expected to give an annual\r\n     picnic, or other kind of treat, to their retainers. A good deal of\r\n     social life, including dances and summer outings, goes on in\r\n     connection with these clubs.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II. p.\r\n     398.)\r\n\r\nIt is such organizations, and not the independent farmers or business\r\nmen, which because they have united and practical aims and methods\r\nconstitute the real political powers in the United States. They select\r\nand put forward candidates, regulate and carry primaries, combine with\r\nother associations, and constitute themselves a real effective working\r\npolitical force. The great extent of their power will not astonish\r\nanyone familiar with the effect of organization and discipline. The\r\nstrength of the French Jacobin party lay in their clubs. The French\r\nRevolution, the American Revolution and the Russian Revolution were all\r\ncarried to such success as they had by organized and active minorities.\r\nA magazine writer says this of these local political associations:\r\n\r\n“The members of the organizations, like every one else, want power,\r\nmoney and place. That is the reason they are members. They get leaders\r\nwho will deliver a part at least of what they want. Leaders who do not\r\ndeliver are quickly decapitated.” Even should reformers get control of\r\nthe party (the writer says) and win at the polls, these floaters will\r\nbreak down the new administration unless it yields the offices to them.\r\n(_American Political Science Review_, February, 1917.)\r\n\r\nIn the words of Bryce:\r\n\r\n     “The source of power and the cohesive force is the desire for\r\n     office, and for office as a means of gain. This one cause is\r\n     sufficient to account for everything, when it acts, as it does in\r\n     these cities, under the condition of the suffrage of a host of\r\n     ignorant and pliable voters.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p.\r\n     107.)\r\n\r\nThese predatory bands are encouraged and supported not only in the ways\r\nalready mentioned, but by the money contributions of the well-to-do. At\r\nevery important election enormous sums are raised and expended by both\r\nparties. In 1896 the Republican National Committee had at its disposal\r\nan immense fund, variously stated at $6,000,000 to $16,000,000, much of\r\nit obtained from business corporations; it was charged that part of this\r\nwas used to purchase votes. It is through these local clubs and\r\nassociations that such money is expended.\r\n\r\nThe case in a nutshell is that of an enlisted regular army, small in\r\nnumbers with a poorly paid and unlettered rank and file, but well\r\nofficered and capable of holding in check a whole population of unarmed,\r\nundisciplined and unorganized citizens. This trained and subsidized\r\nforce cannot be permanently overthrown by any possible counter\r\norganization of reformers, and all attempts in that direction have\r\nalways proved and always will prove futile. The mass of the citizens\r\nhave no motive for permanent political organization; nor can one be\r\nsupplied; for all such counter-organizations being merely sentimental,\r\nmust lack a motive or rallying force such as cupidity affords to the\r\n“regulars,” holding them together and inspiring them with persistent\r\nenergy. A noted illustration of this feature of politics appeared in the\r\ndefeat in 1884 of the Reform Party in Philadelphia by the Gas Ring,\r\nafter it had triumphed in 1881 and had effected many reforms. Its\r\nsupporters got tired out and lost interest. They lacked the sustained\r\nmotive which animated the spoilsmen. In an account published at the\r\ntime, by two gentlemen connected with this reform movement, they stated,\r\nreferring to its work:\r\n\r\n     “In its nature, however, the remedy was esoteric and revolutionary,\r\n     and therefore necessarily ephemeral. It could not retain the spoils\r\n     system and thereby attract the workers. Its candidates, when\r\n     elected, often betrayed it and went over to the regulars, who, they\r\n     foresaw, had more staying qualities. Its members became tired of\r\n     the thankless task of spending time and money in what must be a\r\n     continuous, unending battle.”\r\n\r\nInstances of the power of local and political organization built up on a\r\nmanhood suffrage basis to force a notoriously unfit candidate through a\r\ncontested election are extremely numerous. Practically the entire list\r\nof candidates at any election may serve to illustrate the practice;\r\nunfitness for their offices being the rule among our officials. Two\r\nexamples will have to suffice here. John Morrissey of New York was for\r\nthirty years a notorious gambler and prize-fighter. After attaining\r\nmanhood these were his occupations; he had no other except politics. The\r\npeople of the City of New York with full knowledge of his record,\r\nelected him four times to office by large majorities. He was in the\r\nState Senate at his death, having previously served two terms in\r\nCongress. Here is his official record, taken from the _Encyclopedia of\r\nCongress Biography_.\r\n\r\n     “John Morrissey, born in Ireland in 1831, limited school education\r\n     in this country. Worked in iron foundry as molder. Active in 1848\r\n     in New York as ‘Anti-Tammany shoulder hitter.’ Prize fighter from\r\n     1851-1858. Retired from prize ring and became proprietor of\r\n     gambling houses in New York and Saratoga, and purchased controlling\r\n     interest in Saratoga Race Course in 1863. Elected representative\r\n     from New York to 40th Congress as a Democrat; re-elected to 41st\r\n     Congress. Engaged in New York politics as an opponent of Tammany\r\n     Hall. Elected in 1875 to State Senate and re-elected in 1877. Died\r\n     1878. (40th Cong. 1867--41st Cong. 1869).”\r\n\r\nHere is the record of his vote for Congress:\r\n\r\n    1867 McCartin (Ind. Dem.)  4,494\r\n         Train (Rep.)          2,583\r\n         Morrissey (Dem.)     16,064\r\n\r\n    1869 Taylor (Ind. Dem.)    6,503\r\n         Elliott (Rep.)        2,293\r\n         Morrissey (Dem.)      9,162\r\n\r\nComment on these figures is superfluous.\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Tweed of New York City had been for many years prior to 1871,\r\nthe most notorious political boss and corruptionist in the United\r\nStates; probably in the world. He and his confederates systematically\r\nplundered the City of New York for a long time by means of false\r\nvouchers, etc. The amount of his individual peculations was about\r\n$5,000,000. The total amount taken from the city by the Tweed ring has\r\nbeen estimated at $80,000,000. In July, 1871, these misdemeanors were\r\ndiscovered and exposed in the newspapers. During that summer the whole\r\ncity was aroused, arrests, indictments and prosecutions of Tweed and his\r\nassociates followed thick and fast. Many of the city and county\r\nofficials were implicated, including several judges of the highest\r\ncourts; two were driven from the bench of the Supreme Court. On\r\nSeptember 4, 1871, an immense mass meeting was held at which the famous\r\nCommittee of Seventy was created to prosecute the criminals and\r\nreorganize the city government. It appeared that the county court house,\r\nwhich was expected to cost $2,500,000, had cost no one knew how much,\r\nbut from $8,000,000 to $13,000,000 without being finished. On October\r\n28, 1871, Tweed was arrested and held to bail on charges of\r\nmisappropriating public money. Notwithstanding these exposures and all\r\nthe denunciations of Tweed and his confederates by the press, he was\r\nre-elected in November, 1871, to represent a senatorial district of New\r\nYork City by an increased vote of three to his competitor’s one. The\r\nfollowing are the figures for this and the previous election. Note the\r\nincrease in Tweed’s vote following his exposure; and then reflect on the\r\nbeauties of universal suffrage and on the value of publicity as the sure\r\ncure reform agent that we hear so much of nowadays.\r\n\r\n    1867 Leggatt (Rep.)          2,175\r\n         Kerrigan (Ind. Dem.)    5,966\r\n         Tweed (Dem.)           16,144\r\n\r\n    1871 Rossa (Anti Ring Dem.)  6,927\r\n         Tweed (Dem.)           18,706\r\n\r\nThe organized power which manhood suffrage has in the past placed behind\r\nMorrissey and Tweed and tens of thousands of others continues in\r\noperation to this day. Writing in 1881, Reemelin says:\r\n\r\n     “There is but one political status in history, which at all equals\r\n     the conditions of things that now curse the United States. It was\r\n     that of the latter part of the Middle Ages when the Condottieri\r\n     were masters of society. But these soldiers of fortune had at least\r\n     military capacity; their personal bearing was brave, if venal. Our\r\n     politicians are many of them ruffians; true indeed, while it pays,\r\n     to a cause; but they sneak in and out in ways that are disgusting\r\n     to themselves and to those that employ them. They are the only\r\n     well-defined class in this country; they infect all party\r\n     movements, rule every legislature as lobbyists, control\r\n     presidents, are familiar with judges, cabinet ministers, governors,\r\n     and can and do proscribe the political culture and integrity of the\r\n     land. They defeat every reform, ravish ballot boxes, count in and\r\n     out whom they please. Publicly divided into two parties, they\r\n     fraternize in secret. The voters are their puppets, the abuse of\r\n     taxation and of public credit their means of support.” (_American\r\n     Politics_, p. 149.)\r\n\r\nThe New York Evening Post of November 14th of the year 1919 refers to a\r\nfeature of the city election just held in San Francisco. One Schmitz of\r\nthat city “after twice being elected mayor, underwent a sensational\r\ntrial in 1907 on charges of corruption, and escaped the penitentiary\r\nwhen the State Supreme Court set aside the verdict against him on a\r\ntechnicality.” Nevertheless in 1915 he ran again for mayor and polled\r\nnearly one-third of the total vote; in 1917 he polled 33,000 votes for\r\nsupervisor; in 1919 he again polled 34,128 votes for mayor out of a\r\ntotal of about 100,000. In other words, one-third of the San Francisco\r\nmanhood suffrage electorate can be marshalled in support of a candidate\r\nwith a notoriously smirched record.\r\n\r\nWe must not allow ourselves to be lulled into indifference by surface\r\npoliticians who offer delusive hopes of substantial reform by flimsy\r\nmeasures which deal with symptoms leaving the electorate unswept and\r\nungarnished to continue as the breeding place of the malady. Mr. Bryce,\r\nfor instance, who is very shy of criticising manhood suffrage, likes to\r\nindulge in optimistic imaginings. He says:\r\n\r\n     “If the path to Congress and the State legislatures and the higher\r\n     municipal offices were cleared of the stumbling-blocks and dirt\r\n     heaps which now encumber it, cunningly placed there by the\r\n     professional politicians, a great change would soon pass upon the\r\n     composition of legislative bodies, and a new spirit be felt in the\r\n     management of State and municipal as well as of national affairs.”\r\n     (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 75.)\r\n\r\nIt has also been stated that if the sky would fall we would catch larks.\r\nAs Shakespeare says, “There is great value in your ‘If.’” The principal\r\n“dirt heap,” cunningly placed in the path by the professional\r\npoliticians is the controllable vote; but Bryce, himself a politician\r\nbelonging to a “Liberal” party, is very careful to shut his eyes every\r\ntime he smells that particular dirt heap. But we Americans may as well,\r\nand if we desire results, we must, realize that the political\r\noligarchies are irresistible under the present suffrage system; that\r\nthey have never been defeated in the United States; that their\r\norganizations backed by the revenue derived from fat frying,\r\ncontributions, blackmail, protection money, official fees and\r\nperquisites and the sale of offices and appointments have always been\r\nfound in practice sufficiently strong not merely to hold their own\r\nagainst the public, but to prevent the possibility of any serious\r\nattempt to unseat the machine politicians as the masters of the country.\r\nIn point of fact the rule of the machine politicians is practically\r\nunquestioned; and the battles at the polls are and for generations have\r\nactually been conflicts between two political machines, between two\r\nrival bands of political leaders and their followers, in which the\r\npublic interest was only indirect. The citizens have the option, of\r\ncourse, either of falling in the rear of one of the political bands and\r\nhelping swell its numbers and secure its triumph or of remaining aloof;\r\nthe result in either case will be victory for the politicians on one\r\nside or the other.\r\n\r\nNot only do the political oligarchies win at the polls by discipline and\r\norganization, but they gather strength by the adoption of popular fads\r\nand fancies. For example, if some fanatics start an agitation for\r\nspecial reform legislation so-called, the organization may determine to\r\nfavor it as a means for creating new public offices and patronage for\r\nthe faithful, and so on. The condition of a community or state desiring\r\nto have some notion put into legal effect would be pitiable without the\r\naid of the party organizations. Most of the American people have no\r\nclear idea of the working of political machinery; and when they want\r\nanything done in politics they are apt to run to the very politicians\r\nthey habitually denounce. In this way astute political leaders learn\r\nthe course of the popular currents and can act accordingly, cunningly\r\nadjusting selfish motives, taking up popular cries and adding strength\r\nand prestige to the plunder bund. They have no principles that stand in\r\nthe way of their espousing any cause. Is the war feeling rampant or can\r\nit be readily developed and made available? The politicians begin\r\nyelling for war and waving the banner. Is woman suffrage popular or can\r\nit be profitably used? We have a female suffrage plank forthwith put in\r\nthe party platform by men not one of whom has the slightest belief in\r\nit. All this however is conditioned on the proviso that nothing be put\r\nforward against the interests of organized politics, for the politicians\r\ndo not govern by yielding or catering to majorities, but by means of\r\npermanent organizations which gather in, build up, compel and control\r\nmajorities. The organizations also get power by forming public opinion\r\nto suit their purposes. Their managers are not concerned in abstract or\r\nsentimental questions; but where their interests appear to be involved\r\nthey are apt to intervene either to create issues or to mould public\r\nopinion or to give it a favorable twist in their direction.\r\n\r\nEach political body controlled by one of these oligarchies has a moving\r\nforce far beyond that of the sum of its individual members. The old\r\nconception of a constituency composed of voters who each spontaneously\r\nforms his individual opinion on all live political questions and\r\nexpresses it at the polls by his vote was of village origin; applicable\r\nat most and only partially to small communities. In all cities and towns\r\nof over ten thousand inhabitants the citizen is seldom able to form his\r\nown opinion unaided even on matters of local politics. He is not\r\nfamiliar with the city budget, nor with its health conditions, nor with\r\nits public works, nor its administration generally; nor with its needs\r\nor its program for the ensuing year; nor is he usually personally\r\nacquainted with its officials. The larger the city the less each\r\nindividual knows of its affairs. As to State matters the knowledge of\r\nthe ordinary voter seldom goes beyond the name and politics of the\r\ngovernor and of the local members of the legislature. The citizen\r\ntherefore usually needs someone to furnish him his opinions ready made.\r\nIndeed, beliefs political or other are seldom spontaneously created in\r\nthe human mind; they are usually injected into it; and the ordinary\r\ncitizen receives from without nearly all his opinions on matters not\r\npertaining to his household or his business. Now, the rival\r\norganizations in order to catch the Independents, usually a conceited\r\nand gullible element, find it convenient to manufacture “political\r\nissues”; some trivial, empty controversy is started, often of a personal\r\nnature; the politician gives the cue to the newspapers, the papers pass\r\non the tale to the reader, and there you have so-called public opinion.\r\nIn this way was an opinion fabricated which helped elect Jackson to the\r\npresidency; he was wafted into the White House on the wind of lies\r\ninvented for the purpose, and the process has been constantly repeated\r\never since. Therefore, the managers of these corrupt political\r\norganizations are able through them to materially influence the more\r\nhonest and intelligent majorities by furnishing them ready-made\r\nopinions, which for lack of better they are compelled to adopt.\r\n\r\nTo resume: this is the situation. The independent vote being divided by\r\nhonest and therefore shifting opinion, is not and never can be\r\npermanently organized. The controllable vote can be and is permanently\r\norganized on the basis of cupidity; and its organization is such that it\r\nnot only controls the entire election machinery but is able to create,\r\nmanage and use for its own purposes a considerable share of the public\r\nopinion of the country.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the politicians are firmly intrenched in power. And what\r\nis the extent and character of that power? Is it limited either in\r\nextent or by responsibility to the people? Neither. Within the limits of\r\nthe state and federal constitutions the power of the political\r\noligarchies is absolute and uncontrolled except so far as one political\r\norganization chooses to oppose or to interfere with the other. It is\r\npart of the common talk of the careless optimists among us and of the\r\nconstant prattle of the newspapers that the people rule when they\r\nchoose to do so; that the overwhelming majority are wise and good\r\npeople, and that when they “rise in their might” they can and will set\r\nall things straight. The newspapers for their own purposes assist the\r\nillusion of popular choice at elections, and print declamatory rubbish\r\nof this sort to flatter their readers and to keep up their interest in\r\nthe political game so that they will continue buying the papers. This\r\nclaptrap has a mischievous effect, for it tends to prevent the people\r\nfrom realizing their real situation. The picture, were it a true one, of\r\na community, relieving its ordinary dull submission to misgovernment and\r\nplunder by occasional bursts of rage is far from flattering to the\r\nelectorate; but the facts are even worse; for the public never does\r\n“rise in its might” to overthrow its ruling oligarchy. It merely\r\nchanges, or pretends to change one ruling band or machine for another.\r\nNor do the politicians usually cater to the public, nor do they need to\r\ndo so nearly as much as some of us fondly imagine. The common talk about\r\nour office holders being public servants is cant and humbug. The\r\nprevalent popular conceit that the politicians as a class need public\r\nsupport, and must and do defer to the public in order to exist, lacks\r\nsupport in the facts, though it derives some color from the appeals\r\nfrequently made to the electorate for votes by parties or political\r\nmachines. For though the voter always has a choice between two or more\r\ncandidates, he is never permitted to go outside of the ranks of the\r\npolitical oligarchy, which exists and flourishes despite popular\r\ncriticism and dislike.\r\n\r\nMost of the office holders are practically independent of the people. In\r\nthe cities especially, they occupy salaried places, obtained by the use\r\nof back stairs or secret influence. They could of course be ousted by a\r\nunited public demand, but such demand as that is in most cases\r\ninconceivable and will never be made; no one but the politicians know\r\nthese men, or have in mind the particulars of their duties and\r\nappointments: and none but politicians would have the patience or skill\r\nto manage a public movement to oust them. As a matter of fact few of\r\nthem ever are finally expelled from political life; they are merely\r\ntransferred from time to time from one job to another. To one who knows,\r\nit is often pathetically ludicrous to hear a voter incensed by the\r\ntyranny or incapacity of some office holder threaten to withhold his\r\nvote from him “next time.” The irate citizen will probably forget all\r\nabout “next time,” or will never hear of its having arrived; or the next\r\noffice will be an appointive one, higher up. Even if he do carry out his\r\nthreat it will be like putting a straw down in an elephant’s path; the\r\nquestion whether the object of his wrath will go on the ticket will be\r\ndecided not as the result of a public discussion, but of a secret\r\nconference, and whether elected or defeated, the majorities will be\r\nmostly composed of myriads of voters who have blindly obeyed the will of\r\nthe machine and scarcely noticed the name of the candidate. The protest\r\nof the individual voter if too much emphasized, is most likely to injure\r\nhimself. Even a great daily city newspaper usually finds it a hopeless\r\ntask to attempt to down the machine or its candidates; indeed, the\r\nlatter have been known to triumph over four or five dailies united.\r\nSometimes an office holder is detected in a scandalous transaction and\r\nthe machine deems it prudent to temporarily retire him; but if his dirty\r\nwork was done for the organization’s behoof and benefit, he may soon be\r\nseen occupying a still higher appointive office, or placed on the state\r\nor county ticket at a presidential election and voted into power by an\r\nimmense self-satisfied and innocent majority of the very people who a\r\nyear or two ago condemned him mercilessly, and who in the meantime have\r\nactually forgotten his name.\r\n\r\nThis situation should be clearly understood, because there are in this\r\ncountry millions of people so blind, ignorant or innocent as to imagine\r\nthat the public at large are really participants in the whole business\r\nof politics and government when in fact they have no share in it\r\nwhatever. Let the reader who doubts this statement attempt to interfere\r\nas an amateur in politics. He will find it impossible to do so and that\r\nhe cannot interpose with any, even the slightest effect except by\r\nhimself joining one of the political gangs or parties, becoming one with\r\nthem, submitting to their rules and methods and aiding in their schemes\r\nto purchase and manage the controllable vote. To the ordinary voter, and\r\nto the mass of millions of voters, to that populace which foolishly\r\nbelieves itself the ruler of the nation it is forbidden even to know\r\nwhat politicians intend or are doing. Each voter may meekly attend at\r\nthe polls and ratify what one machine or the other has already\r\ndetermined on, but there he must stop. If he attempts to do more, to\r\nprotest or to air his opinions he will be ignored; and if he persist he\r\nwill be treated with the scorn and contempt due to a meddling fool.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the absolute control of our government by a political\r\noligarchy has been frequently recognized and commented upon. Here, for\r\ninstance, by a recent writer who favors the principle of a property\r\nqualification:\r\n\r\n     “Our ruinously expensive government, shameful system of national\r\n     taxation, blackmailing of individuals and corporations, and bribery\r\n     at elections and in the legislatures, show clearly enough that\r\n     universal suffrage does not eliminate the influence of wealth from\r\n     politics, or produce the millennium and paradise for any but\r\n     scoundrels. In fact, our present system only puts wealth, or the\r\n     power which it represents, into the hands of the unscrupulous who\r\n     can always use the proletariat for any irresponsible power that is\r\n     wanted, and for plundering the community in some form, whether by\r\n     taxation or blackmail. They have become so bold that they do not\r\n     discuss the problems of government at all, but carry on their\r\n     business with the audacity of pirates and the immunity of saints.\r\n     Universal suffrage is simply the useful instrument to this end, and\r\n     the boasted policy which was to cure poverty and destroy the\r\n     influence of wealth has only increased its power and handed\r\n     government over to the anti-social classes, with a struggle between\r\n     the anti-social rich to plunder everybody else and the anti-social\r\n     poor to do the same. The proper limitation of the franchise would\r\n     cut off the sources of the politician’s influence over the\r\n     proletariat and place the balance of power in the great middle\r\n     class whose social and moral qualities are superior to those of the\r\n     rich who buy the plebs with a mess of pottage or false promises in\r\n     order to mulct society, and whose intelligence and prudence are\r\n     superior to those of the proletariat.” (Hyslop on _Democracy_, pp.\r\n     248, 249.)\r\n\r\nThe reader now understands that there was no exaggeration in the\r\nstatement heretofore made and repeated in this book that the government\r\nof this country is entirely in the hands of a political oligarchy. This\r\nbeing the case, what is the vote worth to a fair-minded independent\r\nAmerican citizen, living in New York, Chicago or Boston, or in any one\r\nof the hundreds of cities in the land? What is the actual value to the\r\nunpropertied American of the yearly privilege of voting, which the\r\ntwaddlers and the politicians keep saying is “inestimable”? Absolutely\r\nnothing except for purposes of sale to the politicians. This statement\r\nmay be sweeping, but it is true. The boasted gift of the ballot has\r\nbecome a mockery to every honest man by being made the mere vehicle or\r\nform by which are registered the decrees and appointments of venal and\r\ncorrupt political cliques. The only remedy lies in the destruction of\r\nthe oligarchy of politicians, and of this there is no hope or prospect\r\nwhile the system of manhood suffrage continues to produce the\r\ncontrollable vote.\r\n\r\n     “Experience (says Bagehot) proved what our theories suggest, that\r\n     the enfranchisement of the corruptible is in truth the\r\n     establishment of corruption. The lesson of the whole history\r\n     indubitably is, that it is in vain to lower the level of political\r\n     representation beneath the level of political capacity; that below\r\n     that level you may easily give nominal power, but cannot possibly\r\n     give real power; that at best you can give the vague voice to an\r\n     unreasoning instinct; that in general you only give the corruptible\r\n     an opportunity to become corrupt.” (_History of the Unreformed\r\n     Parliament_, 1860.)\r\n\r\nIn other words, it is practically impossible to bring the rabble element\r\nto take an active part in good government. There is no possible\r\norganization of these corrupt groups save on the basis of corrupt\r\nleadership. Bryce made a study of the subject and devotes several pages\r\nto it (_American Commonwealth_, chap. cxviii), and although always\r\noptimistic, he is not able to point to any genuine source of relief. The\r\n“machine,” he says, “will not be reformed from within; it must be\r\nassailed from without.” His hopes for future relief are based on Civil\r\nService reform, the secret ballot, and time. To rely on time is\r\nchildish. Civil Service reform, if pushed to extremes, will give us a\r\nbureaucracy, such as has afflicted Germany and Russia. The secret ballot\r\nwas the hope of political dreamers who imagined the rabble as possessed\r\nof hidden springs of knowledge and virtue; as secretly devoted to causes\r\nand leaders they never even heard of and never want to hear of. In the\r\nsame chapter Bryce admits the possibility of future “strife and danger,”\r\nand closes it by speaking of “a hope that is stronger than anxiety.”\r\nThis devil-may-care attitude may be appropriate to a foreigner, but no\r\nAmerican worth his salt is willing to sit down in the face of such\r\nthreatened danger and wait for time and chance to save the country.\r\nThose who will not make a move to save themselves are not worth saving.\r\nThe _Fortnightly Review_ recently says, in explanation of Bolshevism in\r\nRussia, that “the dregs of society have come to the surface, as they\r\nwill anywhere when the ordered fabric of civilization built up on\r\nrespect for law and personal rights is broken up.” But this is precisely\r\nwhat they are constantly invited to do by manhood suffrage. If it is not\r\nan invitation to the dregs to come to the surface, what is it? If they\r\nare in power it is because we have been silly enough to open the door.\r\nToday they are organized for party plunder; tomorrow they may combine to\r\nloot the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n     INJURIOUS EFFECT OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE UPON AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE\r\n     BODIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political machine, the political ring, and the political boss crush\r\nout all independence, and bury all talent which will not lend itself to\r\ntheir purpose; discourage all statesmanship, wither all genuine\r\npolitical ambition and debauch the political conscience of the nation.\r\nOne result is plainly shown in a distinct lowering of the quality of our\r\npublic officials, including the membership of our legislative bodies,\r\nstate and federal. The establishment of machine or party organization\r\npolitical rule by means of the controllable vote has replaced the former\r\nfree play of individual talents and opinions; has discouraged our best\r\nmen from entering political life and has degraded those who take part in\r\nit. Our Congressmen are of mediocre ability and deficient in strength\r\nand honesty; our state legislators are of a still lower type; our\r\nlegislatures both federal and state and their members are more often the\r\nsubject of public ridicule than of praise; the political opinions of\r\ntheir members fail to command public respect; with the public at large\r\nthey do not stand nearly so high as during the first forty years of the\r\nrepublic, when they were chosen by qualified constituencies. At that\r\ntime the mass of the American voters were uneducated men, yet they sent\r\nfirst rate men to Congress; now the mass is far better instructed and\r\nsend third rate men to Congress. This is because the national political\r\nspirit has been lowered; it no longer seeks to express itself by its\r\nbest. All the above is so generally asserted and commented on in books,\r\nmagazines, newspapers and in daily conversation as to be notorious. It\r\nis likely that every intelligent reader of this book is fully aware of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of America’s failure to put the best men in high places,\r\nit is sometimes said that it is the result of a certain weakness\r\neverywhere attendant upon democracy. A similar tendency has been\r\nobserved by John Stuart Mill, to accompany the widening of the suffrage\r\nin England. He says:\r\n\r\n     “The natural tendency of representative government, as of modern\r\n     civilization, is toward collective mediocrity; and this tendency is\r\n     increased by all reductions and extensions of the franchise, their\r\n     effect being to place the principal power in the hands of classes\r\n     more and more below the highest level of instruction in the\r\n     community.” (_Representative Government_, p. 159.)\r\n\r\nIn France the deputies to the Chambers are elected on a manhood basis.\r\nThe result is typical of the system. Prof. Garner says:\r\n\r\n     “The rôle of the French Deputy is today largely that of a sort of\r\n     _chargé d’affaires_ sent to Paris to see that its constituency\r\n     obtains its share of the favors which the government has for\r\n     distribution. Instead, therefore, of occupying himself with\r\n     questions of legislation of interest to the country as a whole, he\r\n     is engaged in playing the rôle of a mendicant for his petty\r\n     district. He spends his time in the ante-rooms of the ministers\r\n     soliciting favors for his political supporters and grants for his\r\n     arrondissement.”\r\n\r\nSometimes the constituents ask the deputy to procure nurses for their\r\nfamilies, or to do shopping. Some want appointments as vendors of\r\ntobacco; the ministers, to purchase their support, agree to appoint\r\ntheir friends to office, give them decorations and advance them\r\npolitically. The deputy must look for appropriations for local\r\nrailroads, repairs for churches, pictures for the exhibition, public\r\nfountains, monuments. All the school teachers, tobacconists, road\r\noverseers and letter carriers are expected to work for him. (_American\r\nPolitical Science Review_, Vol. 7, p. 617.) An interesting book has\r\nrecently been published by a member of the French Academy, in which he\r\naccuses democracy of having an inevitable tendency to produce\r\ninefficiency in government. He testifies that such has been the\r\nexperience in France. It is in the very spirit of democracy, he says, to\r\nfavor incompetence in all public officials. (_Cult of Incompetence_,\r\nFaguet.)\r\n\r\nThis lowering of the official standards has been observed elsewhere,\r\nwherever manhood suffrage obtains. Mr. E. L. Godkin, a distinguished New\r\nYork publicist, writing some years ago said:\r\n\r\n     “There is not a country in the world living under parliamentary\r\n     government which has not begun to complain of the quality of its\r\n     legislators. More and more it is said the work of government is\r\n     falling into the hands of men to whom even small pay is important\r\n     and who are suspected of adding to their income by corruption.”\r\n     (_Unforeseen Tendencies of Democracy_, p. 117.)\r\n\r\nThe apologists for our present unsatisfactory political system point to\r\nthis universal democratic tendency to mediocrity as a reason for\r\nacquiescing in the present evil condition which they say is an incident\r\nof democracy everywhere, deplorable but unavoidable. This is a mistaken\r\nattitude. In adopting the democratic régime we have not bargained to\r\nperpetuate its errors; it is our business to correct and abolish them.\r\nHaving observed the democratic tendency to produce inferiority in public\r\nlife it is for us to be specially careful to adopt measures to avoid\r\nthat danger. It is plainly due to inferiority in the voting mass and the\r\nobvious remedy is to elevate the character of the electorate. The\r\ninferior product referred to by Faguet and others is that of a democracy\r\nof mere numbers, where there is failure to give proper effect to natural\r\ncivilizing influences. On the other hand, in the administration for\r\nexample of the great cities of Europe where property is represented and\r\ncharacter and reputation are taken into account, the operation of the\r\ndemocratic system is comparatively satisfactory.\r\n\r\nAmerica is not lacking in men competent for public life. The field of\r\nchoice is large and the material is there. A member of Congress\r\nrepresents a constituency of about 300,000, or say 60,000 male voters.\r\nThe average state legislator may represent a constituency of 50,000 or\r\nsay ten thousand male voters. The ablest man in the district of 50,000\r\npeople or among say ten thousand men is apt to be a superior man; the\r\nablest man of the 60,000 men in a congressional district must be a very\r\nsuperior man indeed. Such are the types of men who ought to be in the\r\nlegislature and in Congress and who under a proper system would be found\r\nthere; a type far superior to that which manhood suffrage has actually\r\nproduced for us after ninety odd progressive years; progressive in\r\neverything else except the quality of our government. Comparisons are\r\nodious, and it would not be permissible, even if physically possible in\r\na work like this, to discuss severally by name the four hundred actual\r\nmembers of Congress, still less the ten thousand actual members of our\r\nState Legislatures, or any part of them. But it must be admitted that\r\nthose occupying these places are not as a rule first-class men; they do\r\nnot even measure up to second-class; some of them are very far down on\r\nthe list indeed. Recently when engaged in the most severe struggle of\r\nits history, the nation found that its best and ablest men were in\r\nprivate life; and not only had there been no demand for them to\r\npermanently enter public service, but its business had been committed to\r\nthe care of small, needy politicians, political adventurers, men without\r\npolitical experience or training, who had been sent to the state or\r\nnational capitol as a reward for cheap political work, or for money\r\ncontributions, or for subserviency to the political boss or the machine.\r\nSuch are the fruits of manhood suffrage in the most enlightened country\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nM. de Tocqueville, a distinguished Frenchman, who visited this country\r\nin 1831, ten years after manhood suffrage had been widely established,\r\nwas struck by the vulgar aspect of the men whom he found in the House of\r\nRepresentatives at Washington. He said: “They are for the most part\r\nvillage lawyers, dealers or even men belonging to the lowest classes.”\r\nNo one would have said that of the Continental Congress nor of any\r\nCongress before Jackson’s time.\r\n\r\nThe very latest observers give similar testimony. Mr. Godkin notes the\r\ndisappearance from Congress and from public life of the class of\r\nstatesmen and great political leaders of former days, such as Webster,\r\nClay, Calhoun, Silas Wright, Marcy and Seward, and ascribes it to the\r\npolitical bosses who will tolerate no independence. Mr. Bryce says:\r\n\r\n     “The members of legislatures are not chosen for their ability or\r\n     experience, but are, five-sixths of them, little above the average\r\n     citizen. They are not much respected or trusted, and finding no\r\n     exceptional virtue expected from them, they behave as ordinary men\r\n     do when subjected to temptations.”\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     “It must be confessed that the legislative bodies of the United\r\n     States have done something to discredit representative government.”\r\n     (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, pp. 587, 609.)\r\n\r\nWriting of Congress in 1907 Professor Commons says:\r\n\r\n     “Why is it that a legislative assembly which in our country’s\r\n     infancy summoned to its halls a Madison or a Hamilton to achieve\r\n     the liberties of the people has now fallen so low that our\r\n     public-spirited men hesitate to approach it?” (_Proportional\r\n     Representation_, p. 8.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Commons does not further attempt an answer to his own\r\nquestion, but it is not difficult to find one. When an inferior choice\r\nis made, the fault is always with the chooser. Congress is inferior\r\nbecause the electorate is inferior, and because the manhood suffrage\r\nmachine insists on mediocrity and slavishness in Congress and everywhere\r\nelse and has lowered the political spirit of the nation. Writing about\r\n1899 Professor Hyslop of Columbia University, New York, says:\r\n\r\n     “Congressmen require considerable omniscience to fulfil their\r\n     responsibilities, but they possess very little of that\r\n     qualification, and too often no honesty, public spirit, or devotion\r\n     to the real interests of the country. Too poor to disregard the\r\n     salary attached to the office, they must consider their personal\r\n     interest to secure a re-election, which puts them at the mercy of\r\n     any unscrupulous man or men who may hold the balance of power in\r\n     their districts; and consequently the man who will follow the\r\n     ‘boss’ or ‘work’ the proper portion of his constituents can get the\r\n     place and salary while the intelligent and conscientious man who\r\n     thinks less of the remuneration than of his duty to the public must\r\n     remain at home. The time servers, demagogues, and men with an\r\n     elastic conscience are the successful bidders for the offices and\r\n     salaries. They know how to use good sentiments and patriotism for\r\n     votes, the voters all the while running trustfully after the devil,\r\n     who is sure to draw them into the bottomless pit.” (_Democracy_, p.\r\n     172.)\r\n\r\nThis deterioration is observable in our public men generally.\r\n\r\n     “Sincere men no longer deny that the offices of trust and profit\r\n     are now filled, in the United States, with much more inferior men\r\n     than as compared with former periods; indeed, it is admitted that\r\n     if we want to find political conditions like unto ours, anywhere,\r\n     we have to search in the records of the worst phases of public\r\n     administration which history affords.” (Reemelin, _American\r\n     Politics_, p. 307.)\r\n\r\nAs late as the present year, 1919, Brooks Adams, in one of his writings,\r\nrefers to the undoubtable deterioration of the standard of our public\r\nmen as compared with the time of his grandfather, John Quincy Adams.\r\nOstrogorski writes that:\r\n\r\n     “The unreasoning discipline of party and the innumerable\r\n     concessions and humiliations through which it drags every aspirant\r\n     to a public post have enfeebled the will of men in politics, have\r\n     destroyed their courage and independence of mind, and almost\r\n     obliterated their dignity as human beings.” (_Democracy_, p. 389.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Reinsch alludes to this moral degradation in striking\r\nlanguage. Referring to the bosses, he says:\r\n\r\n     “Their servants are indeed paid liberally in money and preferment,\r\n     but they are reduced to a position of dependence in which the soul\r\n     is burnt to ashes. The cynicism of the political boss and his\r\n     satellites and the temptations which they hold out, are the\r\n     greatest corruptors of youth in our age.... It is not surprising\r\n     that politics does not in general offer a satisfying career. Able\r\n     men of high character are disgusted with the usual demands made\r\n     upon politicians. While youth is corrupted, manhood is tyrannized;\r\n     and wherever the commercial system has been most successful,\r\n     property, honor, and even life have been rendered unsafe.”\r\n     (_American Legislatures and Legislative Methods_, pp. 239, 240.)\r\n\r\nNext, John Stuart Mill, a champion of democracy:\r\n\r\n     “It is an admitted fact that in the American democracy, which is\r\n     constructed on this faulty model, the highly-cultivated members of\r\n     the community, except such of them as are willing to sacrifice\r\n     their own opinions and modes of judgment, and become the servile\r\n     mouthpieces of their inferiors in knowledge, do not even offer\r\n     themselves for Congress or the State Legislatures, so certain is it\r\n     that they would have no chance of being returned.” (_Representative\r\n     Government_, p. 160.)\r\n\r\nJ. Bleecker Miller of New York writes:\r\n\r\n     “Our rights as individuals are not properly protected by our\r\n     so-called representatives because they as a rule are not up to the\r\n     general moral and intellectual standard of the average citizen.”\r\n     (_Trade Organizations in Politics_, p. 38.)\r\n\r\nLet us give a moment’s special attention to our state legislatures.\r\nThere manhood suffrage has a chance to do its best. Both houses are\r\nelected usually by manhood or universal suffrage. What do we find? It is\r\nnotorious that the reputation of the membership in most of them is so\r\nbad that reputable and able men absolutely refuse to serve. It is also\r\nnotorious that every meeting of a state legislature is anticipated with\r\nalarm and anxiety by the industrial and business classes. Their well\r\nfounded fear is of some piece of narrow or blundering legislation in the\r\ninterest of some class, or which will be inimical to some industry or\r\nbusiness, either in the way of restriction, taxation or other\r\nunfairness. The chronic degradation of these bodies is evidenced by the\r\never increasing limitations upon them in the state constitutions. It is\r\na matter of public belief that three-quarters of our state legislation\r\nis useless, and that a considerable proportion of it is injurious; that\r\nmany of the members spend a large part of their time planning for the\r\npromotion of their personal interests, or for procuring places for\r\nthemselves or their supporters. And yet in this case the facts probably\r\nsurpass the rumors. The public hardly realizes the infamous character of\r\nmuch of our state legislation. It is a frequent practice of legislators\r\nto introduce bills injuriously affecting corporations for the mere\r\npurpose of blackmail. The corporation is expected to pay tribute in the\r\nshape of cash bribes to the members of the committee having the bill in\r\ncharge; and sometimes to other members or to the boss to prevent this\r\nlegislation. On such payment being made the proposed measure is in one\r\nway or another defeated or allowed to lapse. Such extortions are\r\nvariously called “hold-ups,” “strikes,” “sandbaggers,” “fetchers,” or\r\n“old friends,” “bell-ringers” and “regulators.” During a legislative\r\ninvestigation into insurance scandals in 1906 a president of one of the\r\ninsurance companies declared that eighty-five per cent of all\r\nlegislative bills were hold-up measures. A great part of the session is\r\nsometimes occupied in manoeuvring these scandalous bills. Enormous sums\r\nof money must be obtained either by legislators or bosses by such means;\r\nand all sorts of methods, including that of a friendly game of poker are\r\nused in these transactions in the transfer of the cash, some of which no\r\ndoubt is ultimately used to influence elections, thus completing the\r\nvicious circle.\r\n\r\nThe following is from a recognized authority:\r\n\r\n     “The integrity of State Legislatures is at a low ebb. Their action\r\n     is looked upon as largely controlled by the business interests and\r\n     by political bosses.... Charges of direct bribery are frequent....\r\n     It has been well recognized that the Legislatures of certain\r\n     States, notably New Hampshire, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and\r\n     California, have been controlled through a long series of years by\r\n     great railway corporations.... A number of the members of\r\n     Legislatures are ‘owned,’ that is, controlled by some outside\r\n     interest. Usually there is a political leader, or boss, to whom\r\n     the member is indebted for his seat. In other cases a member is\r\n     serving some particular interest to which he is bound by the fact\r\n     that his campaign expenses have been paid or other substantial\r\n     favors given him.” (Appleton’s _Cyclopedia of American Government_,\r\n     1914, Corruption, Legislative.)\r\n\r\nIn an article on “Phases of State Legislation,” Theodore Roosevelt\r\nstated that about one-third of the members of the New York Legislature\r\nwherein he sat were corrupt or open to corrupt influences. He had been a\r\nmember of that legislature three times and in his _American Ideals_\r\n(1897) he gives some account of his experiences there. While careful not\r\nto attack manhood suffrage, he pictures these legislative bodies as very\r\ninferior and corrupt assemblies whose best men were commonplace and\r\nnarrow-minded; whose worst men were venal, ignorant and semi-barbarous.\r\nThe best he could say was that among its one hundred and fifty members,\r\n“there were many very good men”; but he added “that there is much\r\nviciousness and political dishonesty, much moral cowardice and a good\r\ndeal of actual bribe taking in Albany, no one who has had any practical\r\nexperience in legislation can doubt.” After a careful examination, he\r\nand some fellow members learned “that about one-third of the members\r\nwere open to corrupt influences in some form or other.” (Pp. 64-68.) He\r\nmentions four other states which are equally as badly off in the\r\ncharacter of their legislators, if not worse. Mr. Godkin writing on the\r\nsubject says:\r\n\r\n     “If I said, for instance, that the legislature at Albany was a\r\n     school of vice, a fountain of political debauchery, and that few of\r\n     the younger men came back from it without having learned to mock at\r\n     political purity or public spirit, I should seem to be using unduly\r\n     strong language, and yet I could fill nearly a volume with\r\n     illustrations in support of my charges. The temptation to use their\r\n     great power for the extortion of money from rich men and rich\r\n     corporations, to which the legislatures in the richer and more\r\n     prosperous Northern States are exposed, is great; and the\r\n     legislatures are mainly composed of very poor men, with no\r\n     reputation to maintain, or political future to look after. The\r\n     result is that the country is filled with stories of scandals after\r\n     every adjournment, and the press teems with abuse, which\r\n     legislators have learned to treat with silent contempt or ridicule,\r\n     so that there is no longer any restraint upon them.” (_Unforeseen\r\n     Tendencies of Democracy_, p. 140.)\r\n\r\nThe same writer states that the more intelligent class have withdrawn\r\nfrom legislative duties; that it is increasingly difficult to get able\r\nmen to go to Congress, and almost impossible to get them to consent to\r\ngo to the state legislature. He might have added that it would be\r\nimpossible for them to get the favor of the parties or the machines so\r\nas to be elected. He describes a great part of the actual legislation as\r\nabsolutely absurd. He tells of the vicious practice of log-rolling, that\r\nis, the exchange between individual members of Congress and of the\r\nlegislature of support of one bad measure in return for the support of\r\nanother equally bad. He tells how inferior and shiftless men are sent to\r\nthe legislature in order that they may get the salary to help them\r\nthrough the winter. He complains of the immense legislative output which\r\nin these days is about twenty thousand new laws each year. He describes\r\nhow corporations are at the mercy of state bosses who manipulate the\r\nlegislature, and therefore have it in their power to raise their taxes,\r\nor in the case of gas or railroad companies to lower their charges or to\r\ncause annoying and harassing investigations of their affairs. To avoid\r\nthis oppression the corporations are, of course, ready to pay blackmail\r\nin the shape of campaign contributions to the bosses, some part of which\r\nprobably remains in the pockets of the boss, but a large part of which\r\ngoes into a fund to purchase and control the lower classes of voters. As\r\na result large corporations are in the habit of employing an agent to\r\nremain at the state capitol during the session, so as to be on hand to\r\nforestall these schemes by paying in advance. From another writer:\r\n\r\n     “The majority of our legislatures are either constituted or\r\n     controlled by men who either cannot or dare not discuss the\r\n     measures proposed by them. They maintain silence against all\r\n     reason and vote submissively in obedience to a ‘boss’ or they open\r\n     their mouths only to obstruct legislation and to make a ‘strike.’”\r\n     (_Democracy_, Hyslop, p. 127.)\r\n\r\nThis is from Professor Lecky:\r\n\r\n     “A distrust of the servants and representatives of the people is\r\n     everywhere manifest. A long and bitter experience has convinced the\r\n     people that legislators will roll up the State debt unless\r\n     positively forbidden to go beyond a certain figure; that they will\r\n     suffer railroads to parallel each other, corporations to\r\n     consolidate, common carriers to discriminate, city councils to sell\r\n     valuable franchises to street-car companies and telephone\r\n     companies, unless the State constitution expressly declares that\r\n     such things shall not be. So far has this system of prohibition\r\n     been carried, that many legislatures are not allowed to enact any\r\n     private or special legislation; are not allowed to relieve\r\n     individuals or corporations from obligations to the State; are not\r\n     allowed to pass a bill in which any member is interested, or to\r\n     loan the credit of the State, or to consider money bills in the\r\n     last hours of the session.” (_Democracy and Liberty_, Vol. I., p.\r\n     103.)\r\n\r\nIn 1910 in a speech in Chicago Roosevelt said of the Illinois\r\nLegislature, referring to recent disclosures, that it “was guilty of the\r\nfoulest and basest corruption.” (_New Nationalism_, p. 111.)\r\n\r\nReferring to the Gas Ring misgovernment in Philadelphia in and prior to\r\n1870, Bryce says:\r\n\r\n     “The Pennsylvania House of Representatives was notoriously a\r\n     tainted body, and the Senate no better, or perhaps worse. The\r\n     Philadelphia politicians, partly by their command of the\r\n     Philadelphia members, partly by the other inducements at their\r\n     command, were able to stop all proceedings in the legislature\r\n     hostile to themselves, and did in fact, as will appear presently,\r\n     frequently balk the efforts which the reformers made in that\r\n     quarter.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 412.)\r\n\r\nBryce describes the condition of the California state government in\r\n1877:\r\n\r\n     “Both in the country and in the city there was disgust with\r\n     politics and politicians. The legislature was composed almost\r\n     wholly either of office-seekers from the city or of petty country\r\n     lawyers, needy and narrow-minded men. Those who had virtue enough\r\n     not to be ‘got at’ by the great corporations, had not intelligence\r\n     enough to know how to resist their devices. It was a common saying\r\n     in the State that each successive legislature was worse than its\r\n     predecessor. The meeting of the representatives of the people was\r\n     seen with anxiety, their departure with relief. Some opprobrious\r\n     epithet was bestowed upon each. One was, ‘the legislature of a\r\n     thousand drinks’; another, ‘the legislature of a thousand steals.’\r\n     County government was little better; city government was even\r\n     worse.”\r\n\r\nAnd later, writing in 1894, he says there is no improvement in that\r\nState. (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, pp. 430 and 441.) No wonder\r\nthat by its state constitution California has felt itself obliged to\r\ndisable its legislature by prohibiting to it thirty-three different\r\nclasses of state legislation.\r\n\r\nProfessor John R. Commons of the University of Wisconsin, writing in\r\n1907, quotes the San Francisco Bulletin as saying:\r\n\r\n     “It is not possible to speak in measured terms of the thing that\r\n     goes by the name of legislature in this State. It has of late years\r\n     been the vilest deliberative body in the world. The assemblage has\r\n     become one of bandits instead of law-makers. Everything within its\r\n     grasp for years has been for sale. The commissions to high office\r\n     which it confers are the outward and visible signs of felony rather\r\n     than of careful and wise selection.” (_Proportional\r\n     Representation_, p. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe author himself says:\r\n\r\n     “Every State in the Union can furnish examples more or less\r\n     approaching to this. Statements almost as extreme are made\r\n     regarding Congress. Great corporations and syndicates seeking\r\n     legislative favors are known to control the acts of both branches.\r\n     The patriotic ability and even the personal character of members\r\n     are widely distrusted and denounced. These outcries are not made\r\n     only in a spirit of partisanship, but respectable party papers\r\n     denounce unsparingly legislatures and councils whose majorities are\r\n     of their own political complexion. The people at large join in the\r\n     attack. When statements so extreme as that given above are made by\r\n     reputable papers and citizens, it is not surprising that the people\r\n     at large have come thoroughly to distrust their law-makers. Charges\r\n     of corruption and bribery are so abundant as to be taken as a\r\n     matter of course. The honored historical name of alderman has\r\n     frequently become a stigma of suspicion and disgrace.” (_Idem_, p.\r\n     2.)\r\n\r\nThe same malign control by bosses and rings heretofore so often referred\r\nto is directly responsible for this sad condition of affairs.\r\n\r\n     “Thus it would happen not infrequently that a state legislature\r\n     almost equally divided between the two parties would not have one\r\n     member in twenty or one in fifty whose nomination and election had\r\n     not been agreeable to forces behind the two machines, and whose\r\n     legislative action could not be counted upon by those who held the\r\n     party reins.... It is probably within the bounds of truth to say\r\n     that there is not one of our states which has not to a very\r\n     considerable extent come under the baneful influence of this\r\n     system, by means of which the political life of the people is\r\n     dominated and exploited for private ends by rich working\r\n     corporations in alliance with professional party politicians.”\r\n     (Shaw, _Political Problems_, pp. 148, 149.)\r\n\r\nProfessor Reinsch in his work hereinbefore referred to (_American\r\nLegislatures_) gives an extended account of the means and methods of\r\nlegislative bribery through the lobby, resulting in “commercial\r\ngovernments” and a situation where “any business man can get what he\r\nwants at a reasonable price.” He describes the “boss” as the fruit and\r\nflower of the system, his absolute authority, his endless tenure of\r\npower, and the degrading influence of the machine. The reader will find\r\nin this work much of interest on the subject of corrupt state\r\nlegislation which cannot be reproduced here.\r\n\r\nThe legislative evil record still continues to be made. The tree and the\r\nfruit are the same year after year. In the session of 1919 forty-six\r\nbills affecting New York City which passed both houses of the New York\r\nLegislature were so flagrantly bad as to require and receive vetoes.\r\nThe Citizens Union of New York reported that twenty-eight additional\r\nnoxious city bills actually became laws. Allowing an equal grist for the\r\nrest of the state and we have a total of one hundred and forty-eight\r\nmischievous measures which passed both houses in one session. Of the\r\nwork of this very recent session of the New York Legislature, the New\r\nYork _Evening Post_, a very respectable paper, says (August 11, 1919),\r\n\r\n     “Despite the influence of the Governor and the efforts of the\r\n     legislative leaders, log-rolling, trading, and dickering continued\r\n     as usual. Carelessness and sloppiness were characteristic of the\r\n     session. In his veto messages the Governor called attention of the\r\n     members to this matter. Again and again bills slipped through one\r\n     house or the other in such shape that they had to be recalled and\r\n     repassed.”\r\n\r\nCharges against congressmen and state legislators of accepting bribes\r\nhave been frequently made, and instances are given in this book of\r\npublic exposures in consequence. Some years ago the writer was informed\r\nby a leading politician that the truth far exceeded public rumor, and\r\nhis information elsewhere obtained leads him to believe that this\r\noffense has been common. Bryce says in substance that bribery in\r\nCongress is confined to say five per cent of the whole number; that it\r\nis more common in the legislatures of a few states; that it is rare\r\namong the chief state officials and state judges; that the influence of\r\nother considerations than money prevails among legislators to a somewhat\r\nlarger extent; that one may roughly conjecture that from fifteen to\r\ntwenty per cent of the members of Congress, or of an average state\r\nlegislature, could thus be reached, and that the jobbery or misuse of a\r\npublic position for the benefit of individuals is common in large\r\ncities. That is to say, about twenty members of each Congress are for\r\nsale for cash, and from sixty to eighty can be bought for “other\r\nconsiderations.” According to Bryce, and he is probably very\r\nconservative, one can calculate that about one thousand, all told,\r\nmembers of Congress and the various state legislatures sitting at one\r\ntime are absolutely corrupt. (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 164.)\r\nLooking through the pages of Bryce’s great work, one meets casual\r\nreferences to noted instances of such improprieties; as for instance,\r\nsecret influences brought to bear upon legislatures in reference to the\r\nGranger laws; improper relations between railroads and legislators,\r\namounting to secret control of the legislatures by the railroads, and to\r\nblackmailing of the railroads by the legislatures; thus requiring the\r\npresence of adroit railway agents at the state capitals, well supplied\r\nwith money, to defeat legislative attacks made by blackmailers, or the\r\ntools of rival roads. (_American Commonwealth_, Chap. CIII.)\r\n\r\n     “A large number of congressmen were treated to a very profitable\r\n     investment in connection with the building of the Union Pacific\r\n     Railway. If this was not technical bribery, it was accounted its\r\n     moral equivalent.” (_Cyclopedia American Government_, Bribery.)\r\n\r\nAnd in the same article it is stated that “State Legislatures are less\r\nsubject to bribery than are City Councils, but here also the cases of\r\nproven or confessed bribery are numerous.”\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine what can be said by the defenders of manhood\r\nsuffrage in reply to these charges and proofs. The witnesses are mostly\r\nAmericans, friends of democracy, men of trained minds and high standing,\r\nspeaking from observation and common report. Look again at the array of\r\nnames: James Bryce; Theodore Roosevelt; John Stuart Mill; Professor\r\nGarner; M. Faguet; E. L. Godkin; Professor Commons; Professor Hyslop;\r\nOstrogorski; Lecky; Professor Reinsch; Albert Shaw; J. Bleecker Miller;\r\nM. de Tocqueville; Reemelin; Brooks Adams; New York _Evening Post_;\r\nAppleton’s _Cyclopedia_; San Francisco _Bulletin_; _American Political\r\nScience Review_; no one can impeach such testimony. It covers the whole\r\nperiod under survey. These witnesses charge that the present system of\r\nelection of legislators by manhood suffrage in the two most enlightened\r\ncountries where practised, namely, France and the United States, has\r\nproduced inferior legislators; that the tendency to widen the suffrage\r\nhas everywhere brought about like results; that the quality of the\r\nmembership of the United States Congress has strikingly deteriorated\r\nunder the manhood suffrage régime, while the state legislatures composed\r\nof still inferior men have actually become infested by blackmailers and\r\nthe like; that the legislature of New York is like a school of vice,\r\nwhile that of California is vile, an assemblage of bandits; that the\r\nothers are similarly corrupt; their members being the tools of political\r\nmachines, and that highly cultivated men therefore refuse to accept\r\nseats in these bodies. A great part of what they thus assert is within\r\nthe knowledge or reach of knowledge of most of us. Is the American\r\nreader of these lines willing to continue to tolerate longer this\r\natrocious system? Whether he believes in a property qualification for\r\nvoters or not, the writer calls upon him to resolve that this present\r\nfoul system be forever destroyed, and be replaced by something which an\r\nAmerican can think of without rage and shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n     MANHOOD SUFFRAGE AS APPLIED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF AMERICAN CITIES\r\n     HAS NOT ONLY BEEN A FAILURE BUT A DISASTER AND A SCANDAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst ravages of pestilence do not appear in thinly settled\r\ncountries, but in the dense populations of cities. In like manner the\r\nworst records of our manhood suffrage misgovernment are to be found in\r\nAmerican cities rather than in country districts. In the United States\r\nall elective municipal officers are chosen by manhood suffrage. In\r\nEurope this is not the case. In England, France and Germany it has not\r\nbeen considered safe to trust the populace with the power to squander\r\naway the city taxes; the municipal purse is by one device or another\r\nkept within the control of the local property owners and business men.\r\nThe result is that the city governments in all these three countries are\r\nfar superior to ours. A prominent American writer says:\r\n\r\n     “There can be no reason or justice in permitting people who do not\r\n     pay taxes to vote away the property of those who do. In the\r\n     European cities, however wide the suffrage may be in national\r\n     matters, probably not one-half the men vote for city offices. In\r\n     Great Britain, the Low Countries, Germany, Austria-Hungary and\r\n     Italy such an absurdity as universal suffrage for city officers is\r\n     unknown (except in the very rare cases where a non-taxpayer’s\r\n     educational qualifications prevent his voting being absurd); and it\r\n     is in these countries that cities are best and most fully\r\n     developed, and do most for the health and happiness of the very\r\n     people who are not permitted to vote.” (Holt, _Civic Relations_,\r\n     1907.)\r\n\r\nLimit of space forbids going into the details of the municipal\r\ngovernments of the foreign countries just referred to; for that the\r\nreader is recommended to Munro’s _Government of European Cities_ and\r\nAlbert Shaw’s two works, _Municipal Government in Great Britain_ and\r\n_Municipal Government in Continental Europe_. The important thing in\r\ncity politics is to get the right men in office, and the inferiority of\r\nAmerican public officials as a class as compared with European office\r\nholders is well known. In the New York _Times_ of October 19, 1919, this\r\ninferiority is stated as a cause for a certain contempt of foreigners\r\nfor American institutions for which you can scarcely blame them. We\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n“The very poor types of public officials in our large cities,\r\nparticularly in New York, make a decided impression on our foreign\r\nelement. In their native countries public officials are held in great\r\nrespect, nearly all of them being men of standing in their communities\r\nand generally men of education and culture. Socialist agitators take\r\ngreat delight in holding up to ridicule the grade of men appointed and\r\nelected to public office in this country. Most of these agitators being\r\nforeign born realize that the high ideals of the foreign born have been\r\nshattered after they have learned that ignorant and uncouth men can\r\nreach high public position.”\r\n\r\nThe complete failure of municipal government in the United States has\r\ncaused great disappointment not only to our city taxpayers, but to the\r\nfriends of democracy throughout the world. Those who can not or will not\r\nsee the fatal defects in manhood suffrage are quite at a loss to explain\r\nthe situation. One of these is Lord Bryce, who says:\r\n\r\n     “The phenomena of municipal democracy in the United States are the\r\n     most remarkable and least laudable which the modern world has\r\n     witnessed; and they present some evils which no political\r\n     philosopher, however unfriendly to popular government, appears to\r\n     have foreseen, evils which have scarcely showed themselves in the\r\n     cities of Europe, and unlike those which were thought\r\n     characteristic of the rule of the masses in ancient times.”\r\n     (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 377.)\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible in this volume to give even a summary account of\r\nthe effects of manhood suffrage upon municipal government in this\r\ncountry. In New York City the ill results of the extension were plainly\r\ndiscernible shortly after its institution in 1826 and increasingly\r\nthereafter. (See Myers’ _History of Tammany Hall_; the _Evarts Report_;\r\nand Moss’s _American Metropolis_ hereinafter referred to.) The local\r\naffairs of the other smaller and newer cities were not of course\r\nprominent till later years. There is not space here to treat the subject\r\nin detail, and only a few illustrative instances can be given. But this\r\nmust be said at the outset, that the record of city government in the\r\nUnited States since 1830 has been infamous; that on the whole it is a\r\nhistory of ignorance, incapacity, venality, waste, extravagance,\r\ncorruption and robbery, carried to such an extent as to demonstrate the\r\nutter incapacity of the populace for self-government; and that nothing\r\nbut the circumstance that in one way or another means have been found to\r\ncheck the power of the people and their municipal representatives put in\r\npower by the controllable vote has saved many of these cities from\r\nbankruptcy and ruin. Looking into the record of the conditions of our\r\nown time in our great cities, we find them thus described by Bryce:\r\n\r\n“A vast population of ignorant immigrants; the leading men all intensely\r\noccupied with business; communities so large that people know little of\r\none another, and that the interest of each individual in good government\r\nis comparatively small.” There are, he says, large numbers of ignorant\r\nand incompetent immigrants controlled by party managers; a large\r\nshifting population, and the political machinery so heavy and\r\ncomplicated as to discourage the individual, who feels himself a drop in\r\nthe ocean. “The offices are well paid, the patronage is large, the\r\nopportunities for jobs, commissions on contracts, pickings, and even\r\nstealings, are enormous. Hence, it is well worth the while of\r\nunscrupulous men to gain control of the machinery by which these prizes\r\nmay be won.”\r\n\r\nHe further says:\r\n\r\n     “The best proof of dissatisfaction is to be found in the frequent\r\n     changes of system and method. What Dante said of his own city may\r\n     be said of the cities of America: they are like the sick man who\r\n     finds no rest upon his bed, but seeks to ease his pain by turning\r\n     from side to side. Every now and then the patient finds some relief\r\n     in a drastic remedy, such as the enactment of a new charter and the\r\n     expulsion at an election of a gang of knaves. Presently, however,\r\n     the weak points of the charter are discovered, the State\r\n     legislature again begins to interfere by special acts; civic zeal\r\n     grows cold and allows bad men to creep back into the chief posts.”\r\n     (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. I, p. 649; Vol. II, 99-100.)\r\n\r\nBryce condemns the giving the suffrage to the immigrants. “Such a\r\nsacrifice of common sense to abstract principles has seldom been made by\r\nany country.” But it is manifestly absurd to charge all our municipal\r\ncorruption upon the immigrants. Our native crop of controllable voters\r\nfar exceeds the imported one. Bryce is compelled to recognize the\r\nsituation in Philadelphia, where the Gas Ring ruled politics for a\r\ngeneration by controlling the native American vote under American\r\nmanagers. He says that “most of the corrupt leaders in Philadelphia are\r\nnot Irishmen, but Americans born and bred, and that in none of the\r\nlarger cities is the percentage of recent immigrants so small.”\r\n(_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 421.) Though nothing will induce\r\nBryce, or any other British or American politician, to see the\r\ndeformities of manhood suffrage, yet he is willing to testify to the\r\nfacts. He says:\r\n\r\n     “There is no denying that the government of cities is the one\r\n     conspicuous failure of the United States.... In New York\r\n     extravagance, corruption and mismanagement have revealed themselves\r\n     on the largest scale.... But there is not a city with a population\r\n     exceeding 200,000 where the poison germs have not sprung into a\r\n     vigorous life; and in some of the smaller ones down to 70,000 it\r\n     needs no microscope to note the results of their growth. Even in\r\n     cities of the third rank similar phenomena may occasionally be\r\n     discerned.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. I, p. 608--quoted\r\n     approvingly by Rhodes, Vol. III, p. 62.)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give here even an outline of the mass of evidence in\r\nthe case or to make an approach to a picture of the enormous pillage\r\nthat has been in progress in our municipal affairs. Steffens in _The\r\nShame of Cities_ gives a summary of part of the facts relating to six\r\nAmerican cities, namely: New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Chicago,\r\nMinneapolis and Pittsburgh; and it makes a book of 300 pages. In each of\r\nthe governments of those cities Steffens discovered organized graft,\r\nbribery and corruption. In St. Louis he reports a number of the members\r\nof the municipal assembly as “utterly illiterate and lacking in ordinary\r\nintelligence ... in some no trace of mentality or morality could be\r\nfound; in others a low order of training appeared, united with base\r\ncunning, groveling instincts and sordid desires. Unqualified to respond\r\nto the ordinary requirements of life they are truly incapable of\r\ncomprehending the significance of an ordinance and are incapacitated,\r\nboth by nature and training, to be the makers of laws.” Franchises,\r\netc., worth $50,000,000 had been granted in the past ten years and\r\nscarcely one without bribery. As much as $50,000 was paid for a vote in\r\nthe municipal assembly. Companies were driven out by blackmail. Boodling\r\nwas the real business of the city officials. In Minneapolis in 1901 and\r\nthereafter the city authorities were in a regular partnership with the\r\nunderworld and a large and steady revenue was collected for the ring by\r\ncorrupt methods. In Pittsburgh Steffens found a boss in control and the\r\nusual systematic corruption. He noticed that the Pittsburgh method was\r\nto put into all places of power dependents of the boss, men without\r\nvisible means of support; in fact the manhood suffrage idea was carried\r\nout to its logical results. There was an agreement in writing between\r\nthe city boss and the state boss (Quay) for the control of politics.\r\nSpace will not permit the insertion here even of Steffens’ summary of\r\nPittsburgh graft and corruption; it dealt with franchises, public\r\ncontracts, profits of vice, public funds and miscellaneous sources of\r\nrevenue. Philadelphia is described as the most corrupt city in the land.\r\nGood citizens there ask “What is the use of voting?” The city machine is\r\na mere dependent of the state machine. The system there is to apply to\r\nthe public service by way of compromise with the public a handsome\r\npercentage of the collected taxes. Steffens recognized in Philadelphia\r\nthe complete and permanent overthrow of popular and honest government.\r\nIn Chicago he found a persistent struggle going on against the ever\r\nactive and ever powerful poison of corruption. He claims that some\r\nheadway has been made in the direction of reform by the efforts of a\r\npowerful Chicago organization known as “The Municipal Voter’s League,” a\r\nwatchdog affair, reaching after control, and whose existence is a proof\r\nand a confession of the absolute breakdown of manhood suffrage. Steffens\r\nwas compelled to say that he saw no remedy for the sad state of affairs\r\nwhich he described as existing in these six different cities.\r\n\r\nThe testimony from all sources and periods since 1840 goes to establish\r\nthe prevalence of municipal corruption and misgovernment. Here is\r\nOstrogorski, referring to the year 1872 and succeeding years:\r\n\r\n     “Almost all the cities whose population exceeded one hundred\r\n     thousand, or even a lesser figure, had their Rings. In the course\r\n     of these last years, many great cities, such as St. Louis,\r\n     Minneapolis, San Francisco, added new pages of disgrace to the\r\n     history of municipal corruption carried on under the flag of\r\n     political parties.” (_Democracy and Political Parties in the United\r\n     States_, pp. 84, 85.)\r\n\r\nAnother writer (J. B. Miller) states that the debts of the cities of the\r\nUnion rose in the twenty years from 1860 to 1880 from about $100,000,000\r\nto $682,000,000; from 1860 to 1875 the increase of debt in our eighteen\r\nlargest cities was 270 per cent; the increase of taxation was 362 per\r\ncent; whereas the increase in taxable valuation was but 157 per cent and\r\nin population but 70 per cent. In 1883 the late Andrew D. White wrote as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     “I wish to deliberately state a fact easy of verification--the fact\r\n     that whereas, as a rule, in other civilized countries municipal\r\n     Governments have been steadily improving until they have been made\r\n     generally honest and serviceable, our own, as a rule, are the\r\n     worst in the world, and they are steadily growing worse every\r\n     day.” (_Message of Nineteenth Century to Twentieth._)\r\n\r\nIn a work published in 1899 by Dorman B. Eaton on the _Government of\r\nMunicipalities_, he summarizes in Chapter II the well known and\r\nundeniable evils connected with our municipal affairs. He condemns our\r\nmunicipal governments generally as needlessly expensive and inefficient\r\ninstitutions, wherein bribery, blackmail and corruption are\r\ncharacteristic features. He calls “the management of municipal politics\r\nand elections a degrading business by which a class of useless and\r\nvicious politicians prosper,” and speaks of the system as discreditable\r\nand scandalous. “It is not,” he says (p. 22), “the gifted, the noble or\r\nthe honored men who generally hold the highest municipal offices, but\r\nscheming politicians, selfish, adroit party managers, or men of very\r\nmoderate capacity and even of not very enviable reputation, who would\r\nnot be desired at the head of a large private business.” In December,\r\n1890, in an article in the _Forum_ Mr. White wrote that he had sojourned\r\nin every one of the great European municipalities; and that in every\r\nrespect for which a city exists they were all superior to our own except\r\nConstantinople, where Turkish despotism produced the same haphazard,\r\ncareless, dirty, corrupt system which we in America know so well as the\r\nresult of mob despotism. We quote: “Without the slightest exaggeration\r\nwe may assert that, with very few exceptions, the city governments of\r\nthe United States are the worst in Christendom--the most expensive, the\r\nmost inefficient, and the most corrupt.” Bryce, writing in 1894, found\r\npolitical rings in existence in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis,\r\nCincinnati, San Francisco, Baltimore and New Orleans. He might easily\r\nhave found similar, though smaller and less conspicuous contrivances in\r\na thousand other cities, towns and villages in the United States.\r\nWriting about 1898, Professor Hyslop recites a statement of some of the\r\nvarious well known forms of municipal robbery prevalent in our city\r\nadministrations:\r\n\r\n     “Sales of monopolies in the use of public thoroughfares; systematic\r\n     jobbing of contracts; enormous abuses of patronage; enormous\r\n     overcharges for necessary public works. Cities have been compelled\r\n     to buy land for parks and places because the owners wished to sell\r\n     them; to grade, pave and sewer streets without inhabitants in order\r\n     to award corrupt contracts for the works; to purchase worthless\r\n     properties at extravagant prices; to abolish one office and create\r\n     another with the same duties, or to vary the functions of offices\r\n     for the sole purpose of redistributing official emoluments; to make\r\n     or keep the salary of an office unduly high in order that its\r\n     tenant may pay largely to the party funds; to lengthen the term of\r\n     office in order to secure the tenure of corrupt or incompetent men.\r\n     When increasing taxation begins to arouse resistance, loans are\r\n     launched under false pretences and often with the assistance of\r\n     falsified accounts. In all the chief towns municipal debts have\r\n     risen to colossal dimensions and increased with portentous\r\n     rapidity.” (Hyslop, _Democracy_, pp. 14, 15.)\r\n\r\nThis from another writer:\r\n\r\n     “No candid man can wonder at it. It is the plain, inevitable\r\n     consequence of the application of the method of extreme democracy\r\n     to municipal government. The elections are by manhood suffrage.\r\n     Only a small proportion of the electors have any appreciable\r\n     interest in moderate taxation and economical administration, and a\r\n     proportion of votes, which is usually quite sufficient to hold the\r\n     balance of power, is in the hands of recent and most ignorant\r\n     immigrants. Is it possible to conceive of conditions more fitted to\r\n     subserve the purposes of cunning and dishonest men, whose object is\r\n     personal gain, whose method is the organization of the vicious and\r\n     ignorant elements of the community into combinations that can turn\r\n     elections, levy taxes, and appoint administrators? The rings are so\r\n     skillfully constructed that they can nearly always exclude from\r\n     office a citizen who is known to be hostile; though a ‘good, easy\r\n     man, who will not fight, and will make a reputable figurehead, may\r\n     be an excellent investment.’ Sometimes, no doubt, the bosses\r\n     quarrel among themselves, and the cause of honest government may\r\n     gain something by the dispute. But in general, as long as\r\n     government is not absolutely intolerable, the more industrious and\r\n     respectable classes keep aloof from the nauseous atmosphere of\r\n     municipal politics, and decline the long, difficult, doubtful task\r\n     of entering into conflict with the dominant rings.”\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     “The problem,” says Mr. Sterne, “is becoming a very serious one,\r\n     how, with the growth of a pauper element, property rights in cities\r\n     can be protected from confiscation at the hands of the\r\n     non-producing classes. That the suffrage is a spear as well as a\r\n     shield is a fact which many writers on suffrage leave out of sight;\r\n     that it not only protects the holder of the vote from aggression,\r\n     but also enables him to aggress upon the rights of others by means\r\n     of the taxing power, is a fact to which more and more weight must\r\n     be given as population increases and the suffrage is extended.”\r\n     (Lecky, _Democracy and Liberty_, Vol. I, pp. 99-101.)\r\n\r\nThis from a high and recent authority:\r\n\r\n     “The standard of integrity in City Councils is far lower even than\r\n     in State Legislatures. The calibre of membership has so far\r\n     deteriorated that in a large proportion of the cities of the\r\n     country these bodies are held in public contempt.” (Appleton’s\r\n     _Cyclopedia of American Government_, 1914; Corruption,\r\n     Legislative.)\r\n\r\nIn the same work it is stated, in the article on “Bribery,” that “The\r\ncrime of accepting bribes has at one time or another been proved against\r\nmembers of city councils in a large proportion of American cities.” This\r\nfrom Ida Tarbell, the well-known writer:\r\n\r\n     “It is not too much to say that the revelations of corruption in\r\n     our American cities, the use of town councils, state legislatures,\r\n     and even of the Federal Government in the interests of private\r\n     business, have discredited the democratic system throughout the\r\n     world.” (_The Business of Being a Woman_, p. 79.)\r\n\r\nIn a report of a commissioner on the Boston city charter, November 6,\r\n1884, it is stated that “the lack of harmony between the different\r\ndepartments, the frequent and notorious charges of inefficiency and\r\ncorruption made by members of the government against each other, and the\r\nalarming increase in the burden of taxation are matters within the\r\nknowledge of all who have taxes to pay or who read the proceedings of\r\nthe City Council.” That report showed that during the previous thirty\r\nyears the population had increased 190 per cent; property valuations 200\r\nper cent; expenditures 450 per cent. The appropriations were equal to\r\n$27.30 per inhabitant, those of New York $16.76 per inhabitant. The\r\nBoston politicians seem to have worked more stealthily and more\r\nsuccessfully than the Tweed Ring.\r\n\r\nThe corruption in Philadelphia city politics has been notorious for a\r\nlong time. The operations of the infamous Gas Ring caused the debt of\r\nthe city, which stood at $20,000,000 in 1860, to reach $70,000,000 in\r\n1881. “Taxation rose in proportion, till in 1881 it amounted to between\r\none-fourth and one-third of the net income from the property on which it\r\nwas assessed, although that property was rated at nearly its full value.\r\nYet withal, the city was badly paved, badly cleansed, badly supplied\r\nwith gas (for which a high price was charged) and with water.”\r\n(_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 410.) In a memorandum presented to\r\nthe Pennsylvania legislature in 1883 by a number of the leading citizens\r\nof Philadelphia, they stated that the city’s affairs were in a most\r\ndeplorable condition. It is there stated to be the worst paved and worst\r\ncleaned city in the civilized world; sewage so bad as to endanger\r\nhealth; public buildings badly constructed and then allowed to decay;\r\nslovenly management and high taxation. The Gas Ring system was that\r\nalready described. The political boss originally gained a following of\r\nthe floating and controllable voters, by which means he got in addition\r\npolitical control of the city’s gas workmen, and through them of the\r\nprimaries, and thus complete power over city affairs. Elections were\r\ncontrolled by repeating, personations, violence, ballot box tampering\r\nand other frauds. It was not until 1887 that the final defeat of this\r\nring was obtained, after tremendous efforts. In that year the loose city\r\ncharter of 1854 was replaced by the tight-string Bullitt charter, and\r\nthe old gas ring was succeeded by a new combination of rascals. Under\r\nthis régime the city has been governed by oligarchies of city\r\ncontractors. One of the sources of corruption and scandal has been the\r\ngarbage and street cleaning contracts. There have been scandalous\r\ndealings with street franchises. The elections have been fraudulently\r\nconducted. Citizens have regarded it as hopeless to vote; out of 416,860\r\nqualified citizens in the spring of 1919 only 241,090 registered as\r\nvoters. Probably only one-half of the voters actually went to the polls,\r\nand those who voted were presumably the most unfit. Why should an\r\nintelligent man trouble himself to go through such an empty form as that\r\nof voting a mere protest against an overpowering gang of organized\r\nfreebooters? In 1918 the levying of political assessments on city\r\nemployees was still in force in Philadelphia, and collections were made\r\nfrom ninety-four per cent of the city employees; the total being\r\n$250,000 to $500,000 per year to the Republican party alone. A new city\r\ncharter has now (1919) been enacted and great reforms are promised, but\r\ncharter tinkering will never cure the evils created by a politically\r\nrotten constituency. Judging the future by the past, there will soon be\r\na new Philadelphia plunder machine which will function till about 1950\r\nwhen there will be a new revolution and a new ring, and so on.\r\n\r\nBryce states that similar complaints to those made by the Philadelphians\r\nwere constantly made by the citizens of the other principal cities of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nHe gives a table of the increase of population, valuation, taxation and\r\ndebt in fifteen of the largest cities of the United States from 1860 to\r\n1875, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Increase in population           70.5 per cent.\r\n    Increase in taxable valuation   156.9  “   “\r\n    Increase in debt                270.9  “   “\r\n    Increase in taxation            363.2  “   “\r\n\r\nBryce described city government in California in 1877 as very bad and\r\ncontinuing bad up to his present writing (1894). He says: “The municipal\r\ngovernment of San Francisco was far from pure. The officials enriched\r\nthemselves, while the paving, the draining, the lighting, were\r\nscandalously neglected; corruption and political jobbery had found their\r\nway even into school management, and liquor was sold everywhere, the\r\npublicans being leagued with the heads of the police to prevent the\r\nenforcement of the laws.”\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     “San Francisco in particular continues to be deplorably\r\n     misgoverned, and passed from the tyranny of one Ring to that of\r\n     another, with no change save in the persons of those who prey upon\r\n     her.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 446.)\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the great loss of life and property in San\r\nFrancisco following the earthquake shock of 1906 was chargeable to civic\r\nmisgovernment. The damage done by the earthquake itself was\r\ncomparatively light, but the city aqueduct had been so badly built that\r\nit was shaken down and the city was left without water, so that it was\r\nimpossible to put out the numerous fires resulting from the earthquake\r\nshock, which, small in their beginnings, were allowed to ravage the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe evidence as to smaller cities is similar. “In Minneapolis, for\r\ninstance,” says Steffens, “the people who were left to govern the city\r\nhated above all things strict laws. They were the saloon keepers,\r\ngamblers, criminals and the shiftless poor of all nationalities.”\r\n(_Shame of Cities_, p. 65.)\r\n\r\nThe failure of manhood suffrage is also well illustrated by the history\r\nof the City of New York, where there is a large class of unpropertied\r\nvoters and of which J. B. Miller, writing in 1887, said that the\r\ninterests of the City were represented almost exclusively by liquor\r\ndealers both in the municipal and the state legislatures. In 1840 the\r\nNew York City debt was $10,000,000, about $33 per capita. In 1870 it was\r\n$73,000,000, about $90 per capita. In 1918 (for the new and larger city)\r\nit was $1,335,000,000, about $242 per capita. In 1816 the New York tax\r\nlevy was $344,802, being less than half of one per cent of the taxable\r\nproperty. In 1918 the tax levy was $198,232,811, being 2.30 per cent of\r\nthe taxable property. In 1898 the New York City budget was $70,000,000;\r\nby 1909 it amounted to $156,000,000. The increase in population was only\r\n39.4 per cent in that time, while the city’s expenses increased 123 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nFurther evidence may be found in the report of a Commission appointed by\r\nGovernor Tilden of New York in 1875, to consider the evils of the\r\nmunicipal government of New York City and the necessity of adopting a\r\nnew and permanent plan for city government. Tilden was a man of\r\nrecognized ability. He appointed a commission of ten New Yorkers,\r\nincluding judges, lawyers and publicists, men past middle age and of the\r\nhighest integrity, business experience and reputation. The chairman was\r\nWilliam M. Evarts, a distinguished statesman, leader of the New York\r\nBar, who at times held the offices of Attorney General and Secretary of\r\nState of the United States. Their report, which was carefully prepared\r\nand unanimous, described the steady deterioration in the government of\r\nthe city of New York which had then been progressing for a generation\r\npast, and which they had seen in progress with their own eyes for that\r\nperiod of time. The following extracts from the report are pertinent:\r\n\r\n     “In 1850, we reach a period when, as the annals of the metropolis\r\n     at that time and the recollections of those yet living, who were\r\n     then familiar with its affairs will attest, a marked decline had\r\n     occurred, through a great deterioration in the standing and\r\n     character of the city officers, bringing with it waste,\r\n     extravagance and corruption.”\r\n\r\nThe report refers to the period from 1850 to 1860. It says:\r\n\r\n     “Observers of the local government and politics of the metropolis\r\n     during this period will remember that it was the time when the\r\n     local managers first organized on a large scale their schemes to\r\n     control, through compact political arrangements, the management and\r\n     distribution of the revenues of the city, which then amounted to so\r\n     large a sum, and it may be said that from that time to the present,\r\n     with the exception of one short but memorable period, the\r\n     disposition of these revenues has remained substantially in the\r\n     hands of the chiefs of trained political organizations, which are\r\n     mainly supported, in some form or other, from this fund.”\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     “In truth, the public debt of the city of New York, or the larger\r\n     part of it, represents a vast aggregate of moneys wasted, embezzled\r\n     or misapplied.”\r\n\r\nThis waste and theft of public money the report refers to had its direct\r\ncause in the incapacity and rascality of public officials all or most of\r\nwhom as we know were chosen either directly or indirectly by manhood\r\nsuffrage. The report further says on this point:\r\n\r\n     “We place at the head of the list of evils under which our\r\n     municipal administration labors, the fact that so large a number of\r\n     important offices have come to be filled by men possessing little,\r\n     if any, fitness for the important duties they are called upon to\r\n     discharge.... There is a general failure, especially in the larger\r\n     cities, to secure the election or appointment of fit and competent\r\n     officials.... Animated by the expectation of unlawful emoluments\r\n     they expend large sums to secure their places and make promises\r\n     beforehand to supporters and retainers to furnish patronage or\r\n     place.”\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n     “It would be clearly within bounds to say that more than one-half\r\n     of all the present city debts are the direct results of the species\r\n     of intentional and corrupt misrule above described.”\r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n\r\n     “We do not believe that, had the cities of this State during the\r\n     last twenty-five years had the benefit of the presence in the\r\n     various departments of local administration of the services of\r\n     competent and faithful officers, the aggregate of municipal debts\r\n     would have amounted to one-third of the present sum, nor the annual\r\n     taxation one-half of its present amount; while the condition of\r\n     those cities in respect to existing provisions for the public\r\n     needs would have been far superior to what is now exhibited.”\r\n\r\nThe New York City tax levy for 1877, the year of the report, was\r\n$28,400,000, one-half of which was caused by official robbery.\r\nTherefore, according to the report of these able and experienced\r\ncitizens made after an examination of the city’s finances, the city had\r\nbeen robbed of a sum which represented fourteen millions a year, and\r\nwhich capitalized at five per cent amounts to $280,000,000, a fair\r\nestimate of the amount of politicians’ loot up to that time. In other\r\nwords, every family in New York had on an average, been plundered to the\r\ntune of $1400 by state and city politicians. If this $280,000,000 was\r\nnot loot what was it? And if not chargeable to manhood suffrage to what\r\nis it chargeable?\r\n\r\nThe committee showed its opinion of the cause by its choice of the\r\nremedy. It recommended the creation of a Board of Finance to control\r\nmunicipal expenditures, and to be elected by tax and rent payers only.\r\nThis expedient, so objectionable to greedy and grafting politicians, was\r\nnever adopted or even offered to the people for adoption. The report\r\nfell flat in a legislature elected by the controllable vote, and of\r\ncourse thoroughly corrupt and unpatriotic.\r\n\r\nLooking back still further and for the benefit of those who would like\r\nadditional evidence upon the political degeneracy of New York City, a\r\nfew facts will be given taken from Myers’ _History of Tammany Hall_ and\r\nby him taken mostly from public documents, commencing about 1826 shortly\r\nafter “the great advance” which the twaddling sentimentalist writers\r\ntell us was made by the introduction of manhood suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn the November election of 1827 was the greatest exhibition of fraud\r\nand violence ever seen in the city. “Now,” (says Myers) “were observable\r\nthe effects brought forth by the suffrage changes of 1822 and 1826.”\r\nRepeating flourished and honest voters were beaten and arrested for\r\ntrying to vote. Next year, in 1828, hundreds, if not thousands, of\r\nillegal votes were counted, including those of boys of nineteen and\r\ntwenty years of age. This practice was continued in the ensuing decade.\r\nIt was then just one year after the complete triumph of manhood suffrage\r\nin New York State that money was first used to influence voting in New\r\nYork City elections. The city was carried in 1828 by Tammany Hall for\r\nAndrew Jackson. Four years later in 1832, and subsequent years, the\r\nprice of votes in New York City was stated at $5.00 each. Paupers from\r\nthe almshouse and convicts were voted at the polls. In 1838 Swartwout, a\r\nJackson collector of the port, and an unsavory politician, became a\r\ndefaulter for $1,200,000, an enormous sum for that time, and Price, the\r\nUnited States district attorney, defaulted for $75,000. Civic frauds\r\nwere frequent and increasing. An aldermanic committee in 1842 reported\r\nthat dishonest office holders had recently robbed the city of near\r\n$100,000, equivalent to a theft of $2,000,000 from New York City in our\r\ntime. The wholesale naturalization mill was put in operation, turning\r\nout several thousand new voters a year. From 1841 to 1844 the total vote\r\nof the city was thus increased about twenty-five per cent in newly\r\nnaturalized foreigners alone; most of them probably without interest in\r\nthe country or real understanding of its institutions and history. At\r\nthe election of 1844 it was estimated that twenty per cent of the votes\r\nwere fraudulent. The primaries were organized by violence and reeked\r\nwith fraud. The character of many of the noted city politicians was\r\nnotoriously bad, including professional gamblers, pugilists and even\r\nthieves. About this time the city political gangs began to appear. The\r\nward heelers with a following of repeaters were a new power in politics.\r\nIn one period of ten months, 1839-1840, there were nineteen riots and\r\ntwenty murders in a city of only 300,000 population. Mike Walsh’s was\r\nthe principal gang. The gangs increased in number till in 1856 the\r\nBowery Boys and Dead Rabbits had a pitched street battle in Jackson\r\nStreet, where ten were killed and eighty wounded.\r\n\r\nThe sale of nominations to office first became notorious in 1846. Prices\r\nranged from $1,000 to $20,000. This circumstance alone is almost\r\nconvincing proof of universal corruption in public affairs since no one\r\nbuys an office unless with the knowledge that money is to be made\r\ncorruptly in its administration; and this is usually impossible or too\r\ndangerous to be undertaken unless the general administration is so\r\ncorrupt as to be tolerant of fraud, bribery and extortion. The common\r\ncouncil was notoriously for sale; it was believed that every city\r\ndepartment was corrupt. In 1851 the Williamsburg Ferry scandal broke out\r\nand it was shown that $20,000 in bribes had been paid to New York City\r\naldermen. The “Forty Thieves” was the name given to the New York City\r\naldermen of 1852, to whom one Jacob Sharp first applied for a franchise\r\nto build a street railway on Broadway, New York. An injunction was\r\nobtained; but they passed the franchise in defiance of the injunction.\r\nOf the aldermen who thus voted, one was imprisoned for a fortnight and\r\nthe others fined. A similar affair was the sale of the New York Third\r\nAvenue Street Railroad Franchise by the same board of aldermen; over\r\n$30,000 was said to have been paid in bribes for this franchise, a great\r\nsum for those days.\r\n\r\nOccasionally when a quarrel broke out over the distribution of the\r\nspoils the most appalling disclosures were made; such as those on an\r\ninvestigation by the Grand Jury in 1853, when it appeared that the\r\naldermen demanded a share in every city contract. On February 26th,\r\n1853, the grand jury of New York County handed down a presentment with\r\ntestimony to the effect that enormous sums of money had been expended\r\nfor the procurement of street railroad franchises in New York City. It\r\nwas ascertained that $50,000 had been paid in 1851 for the Eighth and\r\nNinth Avenue Railroad franchises; that in 1852 $30,000 was paid in\r\nbribes for the Third Avenue Railroad franchise; that money was paid for\r\naldermanic votes on franchises of the Catharine Street, Greenpoint,\r\nWilliamsburg, Grand Street and Wall Street ferries. Numerous other\r\ninstances were given of bribery of members of the common council in\r\nconnection with sale of city property and other contracts. Evidence as\r\nto police corruption was plentiful. The chief of police had received one\r\nhundred and sixty-three conveyances of property in one year. (_Board of\r\nAldermen Documents_, Vol. XXI, part 2, No. 55, pp. 1333-35 and p. 1573;\r\nMyers’ _History of Tammany Hall_, 167.)\r\n\r\nOut of sixty thousand votes polled in 1854, ten thousand were for sale.\r\n“In the city at this time were about ten thousand shiftless,\r\nunprincipled persons who lived by their wits and the labor of others.\r\nThe trade of a part of these was turning primary elections, packing\r\nnominating conventions, repeating and breaking up meetings.” In 1856\r\nJosiah Quincy saw $25.00 paid for a single vote for a member of\r\nCongress. The day “was enlivened with assaults, riots and stabbings.”\r\n\r\nThe frauds and scandals in city affairs continued and grew from 1854 to\r\n1860; it was impossible to learn from the city’s books how much was\r\nbeing plundered. In three years the taxes nearly doubled. From 1850 to\r\n1860 the expenses of the city government increased from $3,200,000 to\r\n$9,758,000.\r\n\r\nPolitics in the old Sixth Ward of New York is briefly sketched by Frank\r\nMoss, at one time Police Commissioner, in his interesting work, _The\r\nAmerican Metropolis_. No doubt civilization existed in that district\r\nfrom 1845 to 1865, the period referred to by Moss; there were churches\r\nand schools, family and business life as elsewhere. It was originally a\r\nfairly respectable neighborhood, but thanks to manhood suffrage, the\r\npolitical life of the community was thoroughly savage and its\r\nrepresentatives savages, and it and they did much to degrade the whole\r\nward. First we find “that hard-faced, heavy-handed old rapscallion\r\nIsaiah Rynders was the controlling spirit. There was nothing that\r\nRynders could not or would not do, and there are many dark stories of\r\nhis conduct during the draft riots of 1863.” He was the Boss of the\r\ndistrict, his assistants were ruffians, his leaders and backers were\r\noffice-holding politicians with the “Hon.” prefix to their notorious\r\nnames. He was succeeded by Con Donoho, the head of the street cleaning\r\ndepartment, whose gang finally trounced the Rynders gang into\r\nsubmission and who became thereafter “on close terms with the strongest\r\npolitical men of the city.” Moss finds thirty years later a similar\r\nalliance between crime and politics in the Eighth Ward of New York,\r\namong whose political rulers are, he says “pimps, gamblers, thugs,\r\nfighters and dive keepers.”\r\n\r\nIn 1860 the mayor was accused of selling appointments to offices. The\r\nGrand Jury in a presentment charged him with robbing the tax payers of\r\n$420,000. The _New York Tribune_ in June 1860 publicly charged the\r\nmunicipal authorities with theft of public funds. Other newspaper\r\ncriticism was silenced by orders for public advertising. The money voted\r\nfor street cleaning was squandered, and the streets were so filthy that\r\nthe death rate in 1863 was thirty-three per thousand. In a court\r\nproceeding in 1867 it incidentally transpired that $50,000 had been paid\r\nthe common council for one gas franchise.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the notorious William M. Tweed came into prominence and acquired\r\npolitical power which he retained for fourteen years, during which time\r\nhe and his followers were steadily at work looting the city and\r\nsquandering and amassing fortunes. The history of the Tweed régime of\r\nplunder in New York City is well known. In 1867 he was at the height of\r\nhis power. Prior to that date all public contractors in New York City\r\nhad been required to add ten per cent to their bills and pay over that\r\npercentage to certain politicians. In 1867 this percentage was increased\r\nto thirty-five per cent of which twenty-five per cent went to Tweed. The\r\nCounty Clerk’s and Register’s office brought in $40,000 to $80,000 a\r\nyear each; the Sheriff’s office $150,000 a year. A part of this income\r\nwas of course available for election purposes. Tweed and all his\r\nassociates became rich notwithstanding that they lavished millions in\r\nthe purchase of voters and public officials. Out of his stolen millions\r\nTweed in the winter of 1871 gave $50,000 to the poor of his own ward and\r\nperhaps as much more throughout the city. This made him popular with the\r\nthriftless or pauper classes. Many of his transactions were in the\r\nnature of purchases of the state legislature at Albany. He influenced\r\nthe press by means of advertising contracts, presents to reporters, etc.\r\nOne newspaper got a profit of nearly $200,000 on a printing contract;\r\nanother got $80,000 a year for advertising; presents to newspaper men\r\nranged from $200 to $2500 a year. In 1871 the _New York Sun_ proposed to\r\nerect a statue to the great man. At his daughter’s wedding the gifts\r\nwere worth $100,000. From $36,000,000 in 1868 the city debt rose to\r\n$136,000,000 in 1871. The new county court house cost the city\r\n$12,000,000, of which $9,000,000 was undoubtedly stolen; repairs on\r\narmories the value of which was $250,000 were charged at $3,000,000 and\r\nso on. The total thefts of the Tweed ring amounted to somewhere between\r\n$100,000,000 and $200,000,000; the precise figure has never been\r\nascertained. Had Tweed been less greedy, had his gang taken $25,000,000\r\ninstead of six times that sum they might have escaped. They went too far\r\nand the Tweed ring was overthrown in 1871 by a powerful citizens’\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe reader may wonder what the decent people of New York were thinking,\r\nsaying and doing all these years while these operations of the managers\r\nof the controllable vote were in progress. Just exactly what they are\r\nnow thinking, saying and doing all over the country;--complaining and\r\ndeploring that it can not be helped. Sometimes on the heels of some\r\nunusually scandalous disclosure a reform movement would be started,\r\naided perhaps by young men intensely patriotic, fresh from school and\r\ncollege where they had read about our fine political structure in books\r\nthat fail to refer to the rotten foundation. They learned by sad\r\nexperience as others before them that the stream will rise no higher\r\nthan its source; that with a controllable electorate kindly provided by\r\nthe manhood suffrage constitution and an organization of scallawags,\r\nloafers and criminals to control it the politicians had the best of the\r\nsituation. Bryce, who was in New York in 1870 and saw the Tweed Ring in\r\nits glory, gives us a fine picture of the effect of manhood suffrage in\r\nprostrating public conscience and energy. He says that the respectable\r\ndemocratic leaders winked at the Ring’s misdeeds for the sake of the\r\nvote; that the press had been purchased or subsidized; that the bench\r\nwas controlled; that three-quarters of the citizens “paid little or\r\nnothing in the way of direct taxes, and did not realize that the\r\nincrease of civic burdens would fall upon them as well as upon the\r\nrich.” Here you have the case as plain as day; the electorate, whose\r\nbusiness and function it was to secure good government and prevent these\r\nevils, failed in its duty; it was itself corrupt and inefficient; and\r\nwhy? Because three-quarters of it paid little or no direct taxes. In\r\nother words, they were not property holders. Just as the human soul is\r\nundiscoverable except as revealed by the human body, so civilization\r\nexhibits itself in property; and the rabble who are unfamiliar with\r\nproperty and are devoid of sympathy with its rights, feel no interest in\r\ngood government or in any other incident of civilization.\r\n\r\nBryce further says:\r\n\r\n     “Moreover, the Ring had cunningly placed on the pay rolls of the\r\n     city a large number of persons rendering comparatively little\r\n     service, who had become a body of janizaries, bound to defend the\r\n     government which paid them, working hard for it at elections, and\r\n     adding, together with the regular employees, no contemptible quota\r\n     to the total Tammany vote. As for the Boss, those very qualities in\r\n     him which repelled men of refinement made him popular with the\r\n     crowd.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 391.)\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the Tweed disclosures there was no serious attempt to\r\napply the only practical remedy by reforming the electorate. Here and\r\nthere a voice was heard crying in the wilderness, but no one regarded\r\nit. In October 1876, a writer in the _North American Review_ was\r\nclear-eyed enough to read the lesson of the Tweed Ring. He wrote:\r\n\r\n     “A very few unscrupulous men, realizing thoroughly the changed\r\n     condition of affairs, had organized the proletariat of the City;\r\n     and through the form of suffrage had taken possession of its\r\n     government. They saw clearly the facts of the case, which the\r\n     doctrinaires, theorists and patriots studiously ignored or\r\n     vehemently denied.”\r\n\r\nAnd as a remedy he proposed “A recurrence to the ancient ways; a strong\r\nexecutive, a non-political judiciary,” and that “property must be\r\nentitled to representation as well as persons.”\r\n\r\nOf course, the article had no perceptible effect.\r\n\r\nOnce more the impossible task of creating a good government by means of\r\nthe votes of a purchasable constituency was attempted. Such of the\r\nablest men of the city as were willing to dip into the mire of manhood\r\nsuffrage politics devoted themselves to the task but in vain. The\r\nhopelessness of the undertaking ought to have been apparent from such\r\nfacts as this, that Tweed’s own district re-elected him senator by a\r\nlarge majority in November 1871 after he had been thoroughly exposed and\r\nwhile he was being prosecuted for his crimes. The so-called reformers\r\nwho supplanted the Tweed clique in public office were only political\r\nadventurers of a different type; more scrupulous, refined or timid than\r\ntheir predecessors, but politicians after all, since none other could be\r\ninduced to enter the political arena. The coarse robberies of Tweed’s\r\ntime were discontinued, but the government of New York City by a\r\npolitical clique organized on the basis of the use of the city spoils to\r\nsecure the controllable vote was continued. It was only for a few months\r\nthat the tempest cleared the air. The good citizens soon forgot their\r\nsudden zeal, or became discouraged at the odds against them in a manhood\r\nsuffrage community. Neglecting the primaries where they had obtained but\r\nslim results they allowed nominations to fall back into the hands of\r\nspoilsmen, and the most important city offices to be fought for by\r\nfactions differing only in their name and party badges, because all were\r\nclearly bent upon selfish gain. Roosevelt, writing in 1886, tells\r\nsomething of the political conditions of this reformed “after-Tweed”\r\nperiod:\r\n\r\n     “In the lower wards (of New York City), where there is a large\r\n     vicious population, the condition of politics is often fairly\r\n     appalling, and the (local) boss is generally a man of grossly\r\n     immoral public and private character. In these wards many of the\r\n     social organizations with which the leaders are obliged to keep on\r\n     good terms are composed of criminals or of the relatives and\r\n     associates of criminals.... The president of a powerful\r\n     semi-political association was by profession a burglar; the man who\r\n     received the goods he stole was an alderman. Another alderman was\r\n     elected while his hair was still short from a term in the State\r\n     prison. A school trustee had been convicted of embezzlement and was\r\n     the associate of criminals.” (_Century Magazine_ for November,\r\n     1866.)\r\n\r\nOstrogorski thus describes the period following Tweed’s overthrow:\r\n\r\n     “The principal instrument of this plunder was the police; they\r\n     levied a regular toll prescribed by a fixed tariff on all the\r\n     saloons, houses of ill fame, and gambling hells; extorted money on\r\n     false pretenses or on no pretenses at all from small traders whom\r\n     they had the power of molesting. Other perfectly lawful businesses\r\n     were subjected to a tribute; steamboat companies, insurance\r\n     societies, banks, etc., paid blackmail in return for the protection\r\n     accorded to them. The police captains and even the policemen had to\r\n     buy their places. The government of the city in fact became a huge\r\n     market in which the officers might as well have sat at little\r\n     tables and sold their wares openly.” (P. 81.)\r\n\r\nIn other words, the much vaunted reform uprising which overthrew Tweed\r\nwas without radical or permanent results, because it left the city still\r\nat the mercy of the controllable vote.\r\n\r\nA few later incidents may be added to Mr. Myers’ interesting collection.\r\nIn 1874 one McKenna was shot dead in an election fight in New York and\r\nRichard Croker was accused of the crime and tried; the jury disagreed.\r\nCroker afterwards became Tweed’s successor and political boss of New\r\nYork, retiring about 1899 to his native Ireland, with millions made out\r\nof politics. About this time the Harlem court house was built. The\r\namount possible to steal was small, but the politicians displayed a\r\nspirit worthy of past days; for $66,000 worth of construction they\r\ncollected from the city $268,000, or at the rate of four to one. In 1884\r\ntwenty-one members out of twenty-three of the Board of Aldermen of New\r\nYork voted to give the franchise for a surface railway on Broadway to\r\nthe Broadway Surface Railroad Company. The rival road, the Broadway\r\nRailroad Company, tried to bribe the Aldermen with $750,000, half cash\r\nand half bonds. The Aldermen feared the bonds might be traced, and\r\nconsidered it wiser to accept the $500,000 cash offered by the Surface\r\nCompany. Each alderman was to receive $22,000. Three aldermen were\r\nconvicted, six fled to Canada and three turned State’s evidence. Ten\r\nothers were indicted but never brought to trial. After 1884 more\r\nscientific methods replaced the rough old ways, and New York City\r\nsettled down to a steady stream of boss and machine rule, supported by\r\nsmall graft, blackmail, voluntary contributions and assessments on\r\noffice holders. During the Croker régime, which commenced about this\r\ntime, it was understood that men of means, or corporations who wanted\r\n“protection” in their property rights or in their various transactions,\r\nlawful or otherwise, were expected to send their checks for proportional\r\nsums to Croker without word or comment. For these contributions he could\r\nnot be required to account as he held no public office. It was believed\r\nthat Croker was fair to his contributors and that if trouble came they\r\nwould be looked after. This surely was better than paying blackmail to\r\nall sorts of government officials. The machine therefore ran smoother\r\nthan in Tweed’s time; and probably the same kindness towards political\r\nbosses is still practised by business men and corporations. There can be\r\nno legal objection to such methods, they are safe in every way. In 1889\r\nthe Fassett investigating committee appointed by the state senate took\r\nabout 3500 pages of testimony in regard to city affairs showing that\r\nblackmail was systematically levied on gambling houses, liquor saloons,\r\nand other places. In 1892 there arose the “Huckleberry” street railway\r\nfranchise scandal connected with the grant of a valuable franchise in\r\nthe Bronx, New York City. In 1894 the Lexow Committee made a new state\r\nsenate investigation into New York City politics, disclosing fraudulent\r\nvoting under police protection; sale of police appointments at prices\r\nfrom $300 to $15,000; blackmail levied systematically on liquor sellers,\r\ngamblers, swindlers, and loose women. The revenue from these sources was\r\nestimated at $7,000,000 annually. This did not include contributions\r\nfrom corporations. In 1900 the so-called Mazet Senate Committee\r\nconducted a third investigation which brought out evidence tending to\r\nshow that the mayor (Van Wyck) had been a party to a conspiracy to\r\ncreate a monopoly of ice in the City of New York. The essential meanness\r\nof a scheme to fatten on the needs of the poor during the sultry months\r\nwas apparent even to the most stupid voter; the mayor became unpopular\r\nand at the end of his term retired to Paris with great wealth as it was\r\nsaid. The Mazet committee unearthed the fact that the city contracts\r\nwent to politicians, not to business men.\r\n\r\nParticulars of other scandals, such as the Ramapo Water Scheme; the\r\nsystem of judicial assessments for office, the silent partnerships of\r\npolitical leaders in city contracts, and police corruption must be\r\nomitted here for want of space. About 1900 the New York, Westchester and\r\nBoston Railroad Company, an adjunct of the New York, New Haven and\r\nHartford Railroad Company, was seeking a franchise to enter New York\r\nCity; it obtained it in 1904 from the New York municipal authorities.\r\nTen years afterwards in 1914 it was ascertained in an investigation by\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission that in order to get the franchise\r\nthe Railroad Company had been required to distribute $1,500,000 in cash\r\nto politicians and to give a $6,000,000 contract to a business\r\ncorporation controlled by politicians. This same corporation obtained\r\nother contracts from other quarters, about $15,000,000 in all, through\r\npolitical influence.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing instances of New York municipal scandals are more than\r\nsufficient for the purposes of this chapter. For an extended account of\r\nsome of the evils and problems of American municipalities the reader is\r\nreferred to _Eaton on Government of Municipalities_, published in 1899,\r\nand to other works herein referred to. But you cannot (says Steffens)\r\nput all the known incidents of the corruption of an American city into a\r\nbook; and it is probable that a mere sketch of all the actual discovered\r\nand known American municipal frauds and malpractices committed or\r\nculpably permitted in the past eighty years would fill many large\r\nvolumes. The statements of the writers hereinbefore quoted in proof of\r\nthe deplorable failure of American municipal government, though\r\nnecessarily general in terms are sufficient and convincing; and the\r\nspecific instances herein mentioned were given not so much to sustain\r\nthis undisputed general testimony as to illustrate it; and as a local\r\nmap or sketch may aid a traveller to call to mind the ground traversed\r\nin past years, so here to assist the memory of the reader as to the\r\ndetails and quality of frauds and rascalities notorious in their time,\r\nand with the story of which he is or has been more or less familiar.\r\n\r\nNor will the limits of this volume permit an attempt to set forth an\r\naccount however slight of the various futile efforts made from time to\r\ntime to reduce the stream of municipal corruption. They have all failed\r\nbecause they did not reach the source of the flow. In some American\r\ncities an attempt at a qualified dictatorship has been made; instead of\r\nthe election of all civic functionaries, as required by the logical\r\napplication of the manhood suffrage doctrine, the plan has been adopted\r\nof electing only a mayor, for four years, and giving him the unqualified\r\npower of appointment of all other city officials. Instead of the annual\r\nelection of say ten heads of bureaus, or departments, a year, making\r\nforty appeals to popular wisdom, we have thus in four years only one\r\nsuch call for the _vox populi_. This is on its face a complete admission\r\nof the failure of manhood suffrage; and in reality, this one-man system\r\nhas always been adopted after some disgusting exposure of rottenness in\r\ncity government had demonstrated that failure. Bryce furnishes a\r\nchapter, written by Mayor Low, a reform mayor of Brooklyn, advocating\r\nthis sort of dictatorship, which was in use during his incumbency. Low\r\nsays that the local city legislative bodies have almost everywhere\r\nabused their powers. This fact is notorious. Local self-government of\r\ncities by boards of aldermen, or city councils, elected by the people\r\nunder the manhood suffrage system, has been productive of so many\r\ngrotesque blunders, shameful wastes and robberies, beside neglect and\r\nmismanagement of city affairs, that it has been frequently thrown into\r\nthe discard, and replaced by boards, commissions, superintendents and\r\nother appointive officials, as proposed by Low. But according to the\r\nmanhood suffrage theory this is all wrong and the municipal legislatures\r\nchosen by the people, boards of aldermen, common councils (it used to be\r\na joke among the young men to call them “common scoundrels”) or what not\r\nshould have power to lay, collect and expend all city taxes. But every\r\none knows that if that were done, a perfect riot of extravagance and\r\nplunder would forthwith ensue followed by insolvency, disorder, and\r\nfinally anarchy. Take the City of New York for instance, where the Board\r\nof Aldermen, which is the municipal legislature, is elected by manhood\r\nsuffrage, and give that body the power of governing the city which\r\nlogically belongs to it upon the manhood suffrage theory, and in one\r\nmonth’s time, demoralization would be apparent; the police and fire\r\ndepartments unreliable, fire insurance rates doubled, expenses mounting\r\nupward, the air filled with political scandals, and the city’s credit\r\nstunned and languishing. Such is no doubt the opinion of probably\r\nnineteen New York business men out of twenty, based upon history,\r\ntraditions, experience and observation. If manhood suffrage be right in\r\nprinciple, the government of cities by representatives chosen at ward or\r\ndistrict elections would be the most successful feature of the American\r\ndemocracy; for all the adjuncts of a working democracy, public schools,\r\nnewspapers, conferences and discussion of political questions abound in\r\nthe city more than in the country; but the contrary is the case. All\r\nthese advantages are offset and more by the simple fact that the\r\ncontrollable vote is greater in the city than in the country. As to city\r\ngovernment by officials appointed under legislative authority, that too\r\nhas always failed for the reason that it has always been corrupted by\r\nthe legislative taint. Most of Tweed’s plundering was done with\r\nlegislative sanction.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the American atmosphere nor in the American blood to\r\nprevent a pure civic administration. This appears by the actual\r\nexperience of the City of Washington. In 1867 Congress established\r\nmunicipal government by manhood suffrage in the District of Columbia.\r\n“Under these “conditions unrestricted suffrage produced extravagance,\r\ncorruption “and other incidents of bad government.” (Lalor’s\r\n_Cyclopedia_, Suffrage.) Result, that in 1878 Congress had to abolish\r\nelections in the District and to go back to the system which had been\r\nadopted in 1798 of a government by an appointed board of three\r\ncommissioners. “Nevertheless” (says Eaton) “the City of Washington,\r\nunder this new system, has “had the most economical, efficient, and\r\nrespectable government “of any city in the United States.” (_Government\r\nof Municipalities_, p. 156.) Here the appointing power is absolutely\r\nfree from the influence of the controllable vote or of any vote of the\r\npeople of Washington. This instance shows clearly that the mischief in\r\nour popular system lies in the electorate itself. Meantime the people of\r\nWashington are to be congratulated that they are free from the brutality\r\nand roguery of a universal suffrage popular government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n     BRIEF REFERENCE TO MANY NOTED DISCLOSURES OF GOVERNMENTAL\r\n     CORRUPTION MOSTLY IN STATE AND FEDERAL AFFAIRS SINCE THE\r\n     INSTITUTION OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an unpleasant task, that of dragging to light past records of\r\nmalversation in office, and it is nearly equally unpleasant to inspect\r\nthem after production; and though it be necessary for the purpose in\r\nhand to set before the reader a number of instances of such misdeeds,\r\nthe tale will be condensed and shortened as much as possible, down\r\nalmost to a mere enumeration of the scandals referred to. Most writers,\r\nnative and foreign, who have undertaken to criticize official\r\ndelinquency in this country, have been content to rely upon their\r\nreaders’ general knowledge of the facts. The present writer is aware\r\nthat his readers also are probably already prepared to give from memory\r\nand tradition a general assent to the accusations herein contained, but\r\nhe wishes for present purposes to refresh this recollection and to\r\nfortify this tradition. After all, most of us have but a dim remembrance\r\nof even the most interesting details of past history; that is why each\r\ngeneration repeats the mistakes of the last one. The distinguished\r\nSpanish philosophical novelist Blasco Ibañez has been frequently heard\r\nto say that nations learn but little by their mistakes; that when\r\ndisaster comes the people cry aloud in pain, anger and indignation, and\r\nmake strong resolves of future amendment; but when the trouble passes\r\nthey forget alike the lessons learned and the good resolutions taken.\r\nThe writer earnestly desires to create in the minds of his readers such\r\na feeling of indignation as can only arise from a clear and definite\r\nrealization of the facts, and yet it is impossible to give them in\r\ndetail; the volume would be too great. The scandalous instances referred\r\nto in this chapter and elsewhere in this book are but a very small part\r\nof the story of popular misgovernment in the United States under the\r\nmanhood suffrage régime, and even if to them were added every other\r\ninstance of official misconduct discovered or published for the period\r\nwe are considering the whole would fall far short of a full measure of\r\nthe mischief done, for it would amount to no more than a recital of its\r\nsuperficial indications and symptoms. We all know that gross but hidden\r\ncorruption may long fester in the body politic, or in a public\r\ninstitution, unknown to the world at large, until disclosed by some\r\nflagrant display, which like a spot on the surface of an apple reveals\r\nthe decay and putridity within. And so here, the whole American\r\npolitical system has been corrupted by the virus of the controllable\r\nvote; and these scandals are but the eruptions denoting the diseased\r\ninward condition. Besides this, the reader is asked to bear in mind that\r\nthe instances here given by no means constitute a complete record; they\r\nare only a few of the most important publicly disclosed cases. No\r\nattempt was made at thorough research or investigation; only those are\r\nmentioned which are generally known, and which came readily to the\r\nwriter’s memory, or appeared on a cursory examination of a few\r\npublications; whereas out of one hundred discovered, an average of but\r\nten are publicly denounced and but one judicially convicted. Here are\r\nonly the large and important, only the national and state plunder\r\nconspiracies; the misdeeds of the chiefs and masters; for each one of\r\nthese there have been a hundred smaller thefts, pilferings and frauds; a\r\nthousand village, town and county knaveries. Below or attached to each\r\nchief were scores or hundreds of subordinates or followers; how many of\r\nthem escaped the contagion of the evil example of their leaders and\r\nsuperiors? These half hundred scandals about to be set down in this\r\nchapter, properly considered, do not merely represent the trespasses of\r\nfifty individuals; they really show forth the misconduct and depravity\r\nof a class and the corruption and disgrace of an entire political\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe Golphin claim for $43,000 was an old revolutionary claim originally\r\nmade not against the United States, but against Georgia. In 1835 a\r\npolitician named Crawford became attorney for the claimants on a\r\ncontingent fee of one-half. In 1848 a bill authorizing its payment out\r\nof the U. S. Treasury was passed through Congress without discussion,\r\nand the claim was paid in full. In 1850, this same Crawford being\r\nSecretary of War, the Treasury Department was induced by some one to pay\r\nthe claimant $191,000 for back interest in addition to the principal\r\nalready paid. Of this sum Crawford received $94,000. The names of three\r\ncabinet officers were smirched by the scandal which ensued on the\r\ndiscovery of the facts.\r\n\r\nA majority of the Wisconsin legislature of 1856 was bribed to vote for a\r\nvaluable land grant to the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad Company.\r\nStocks and bonds to the amount of $175,000 were distributed among\r\nthirteen senators, and $335,000 among members of the Assembly. The\r\nGovernor received $50,000; his private secretary $5,000, and other\r\nofficials corresponding sums all in bonds of the company. (_Rhodes_,\r\nIII, p. 61.)\r\n\r\n“The investigation of the scandal of the Milwaukee and La Crosse Railway\r\nCompany in Wisconsin (1858) showed that about $900,000 worth of bonds\r\nhad been distributed among legislators and prominent politicians in the\r\nstate. Conditions like these have probably obtained in all the states at\r\nsome time or other.” (_Reinsch_, p. 231.)\r\n\r\nIn 1857 three members of the National House of Representatives were\r\nproved guilty of corrupt practices, and resigned their seats to avoid\r\nexpulsion.\r\n\r\nIn 1867-8 was the famous Erie Railroad scandal which for months occupied\r\nthe attention of the public of the entire country. It presented a series\r\nof dramatic incidents, and the merest possible outline of its history is\r\nsufficient to enlighten the reader as to the rotten conditions then\r\nprevailing in New York State politics. William M. Tweed was the\r\npolitical boss of New York City and was aiming to control the\r\nLegislature. The judges of the New York Supreme Court had been elected\r\nby manhood suffrage and one of them named Barnard was one of his\r\ncreatures. Jay Gould, a financial adventurer of New York City, who died\r\nworth fifty millions of dollars, was then at the beginning of his\r\ncareer; one of his associates was a still more picturesque adventurer\r\nnamed Fisk. The Vanderbilts, then and now a very wealthy family of New\r\nYork City, desiring to get control of the management of the Erie\r\nRailroad Company started to purchase in the open market enough shares of\r\nits stock for that purpose. To defeat this project one Drew, then in\r\ncontrol of the Erie Railroad Company, issued 58,000 new shares of Erie\r\nstock. It was charged that this issue was illegal and that Drew kept\r\nprinting the shares as fast as the Vanderbilts could buy them. Jay Gould\r\nwas reported to have pocketed several millions by the transaction.\r\nThereupon, the Vanderbilts took legal proceedings to annul this 58,000\r\nshares. Drew, Fisk, Gould and others escaped during a fog in rowboats\r\nfrom New York City across the Hudson River to New Jersey and began a\r\nsuit for conspiracy against the Vanderbilts and Judge Barnard of the\r\nSupreme Court. An attempt to kidnap them and bring them back to New York\r\nwas made and failed. Gould obtained a handsome residence in New Jersey,\r\nand the Drew clique and he began an effort to acquire a corrupt control\r\nof the New Jersey Legislature for the purpose of getting their acts\r\nlegalized, and also had a bill introduced into the New York Legislature\r\nwith that object. Doubtless it was hoped to set the two legislatures of\r\nNew York and New Jersey underbidding each other for the Drew-Gould\r\nmoney. The New York legislators were only getting $300 a year salary at\r\nthat time, and were eager for a share of the money which was expected to\r\nbe distributed in payment for this legislation. All ordinary business of\r\nthe New York legislature was comparatively neglected, while groups\r\ngathered about the hallways and the cloak room of the Capitol in Albany\r\ntalking in undertones. A fair rate for members’ votes was mentioned as\r\nbetween $2,000 and $3,000 each. The Erie people, however, at first\r\noffered only $1,000 a vote, $500 down and $500 when the bill became a\r\nlaw. Boss Tweed advised the members to stand firm and they would get\r\nmore from the Vanderbilts. The matter got before the Railroad Committee\r\nof the Assembly. The Committee was reported to be divided. Suddenly a\r\nrumor started that Vanderbilt and Drew were compromising. This created a\r\npanic among the Albany legislators. Some of them it was said began to\r\noffer to take $500. Soon the Assembly Railroad Committee reported\r\nunanimously against the bill; the report was agreed to and the bill was\r\nsupposed to be killed. A member of the Assembly named Glenn then stated\r\nopenly that he had been approached and offered a bribe of $500 to vote\r\nfor the Erie Bill and asked for a committee of investigation. The\r\ncommittee was appointed and reported that they had examined the books of\r\nthe railroad company and found that no money had been used to influence\r\nthe legislature. Glenn resigned his seat. Finally the bill actually\r\npassed the Legislature. This was followed by vehement charges of\r\ncorruption in the public press and elsewhere. It was stated that one\r\nsenator had obtained $15,000 from one side, and then $20,000 from the\r\nother side; and still not satisfied, wanted $1,000 more for his son who\r\nacted as his private secretary. Another committee of investigation was\r\nappointed which subsequently reported that they could find no proof of\r\nwrong doing. Vanderbilt and Drew now compromised matters and Tweed\r\njoined the Drew, Gould and Fisk combination and was made a director of\r\nthe Erie Company as part of a scheme to obtain the votes of the counties\r\nthrough which the Erie Railroad ran for Hoffman, who was Tweed’s man, as\r\nGovernor. Tweed was to manage the courts in the interests of the Erie.\r\nThen began an effort by the Erie to get control of the Albany &\r\nSusquehanna Railroad and thereupon ensued another fight in the courts,\r\nJudge Barnard, who was Tweed’s judge, issuing orders on one side in New\r\nYork and Judge Peckham making counteracting orders in Albany. Gould and\r\nFisk secured the Grand Opera House at Eighth Avenue and Twenty-third\r\nStreet, New York City, for the main offices of the Erie Railway Company,\r\nwhere they also established their personal headquarters. Miss Josie\r\nMansfield, a well-known friend of Fisk’s, took an adjoining house, where\r\nit was alleged Judge Barnard held court and issued injunctions and\r\norders of various kinds. The Susquehanna Railroad people found it\r\nimpossible to get service upon either Gould or Fisk of court orders\r\nissued on their behalf, because no one who was not known to be friendly\r\ncould get into the Opera House where the clique in power were well\r\nguarded. The President of the Albany & Susquehanna Company thereupon\r\nsent his own son to New York to serve papers. They never were served and\r\nthe body of the young man was found a corpse in the Hudson River soon\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Erie Railroad scandal was connected with the Wall Street conspiracy\r\nto corner the gold market as it was called, in which Fisk and Gould were\r\nalso interested. Gold coin was then selling at a premium everywhere in\r\nthe United States; the price fluctuated from hour to hour; a New York\r\nBrokers Exchange, called the Gold Room, was entirely devoted to this\r\nspeculation; a daring attempt was made by Gould, Fisk and others to\r\nmonopolize the gold supply and advance the price enormously. The mystery\r\nas to what, if any, high politicians were concerned in this plot was\r\nnever solved. Says Henry Adams: “The Congressional Committee took a\r\nquantity of evidence which it dared not probe and refused to analyze.\r\nAlthough the fault lies somewhere on the administration and can lie\r\nnowhere else, the trail always faded and died out at the point where any\r\nmember of the administration became visible.... The worst scandals of\r\nthe Eighteenth Century were relatively harmless by the side of this,\r\nwhich smirched executive, judiciary, banks, corporate systems,\r\nprofessions and people, all the great active forces of society, in one\r\ndirty cesspool of vulgar corruption.” (_Education of Henry Adams_, p.\r\n271.)\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 1875, Governor Tilden, in a special message to the New York\r\nState Legislature, stated that for five years ending Sept. 30, 1874,\r\nmillions had been wasted on the canals by unnecessary repairs and\r\ncorrupt contracts. Upon ten fraudulent contracts New York State had paid\r\nmore than one and one-half million dollars while the proposals at\r\ncontract price called for less than half a million. The exact figures\r\nare:\r\n\r\n    Paid by the State      $1,560,769.84\r\n    Amount of Contracts       424,735.90\r\n\r\nA commission to investigate was created. Indictments were found against\r\nthe son of a state senator, a member of the board of canal appraisers,\r\nan ex-canal commissioner, two ex-superintendents of canals, and one\r\ndivision engineer. (See _Political History of New York_, Alexander, p.\r\n324.)\r\n\r\nFrom 1867 to 1872 were in progress the Union Pacific Railroad\r\nirregularities commonly known as the Credit Mobilier frauds in which a\r\nnumber of prominent United States Congressmen were implicated.\r\n\r\nThe Freedmen’s Bureau (Federal) irregularities covered 1871 and 1872,\r\nand after investigation large sums remained unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nFrom 1872 to 1874 were exposed the Internal Revenue Moiety frauds,\r\ninvolving millions and implicating Secretary Richardson of the United\r\nStates Treasury and many other Treasury and Internal Revenue officials.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 were investigated and exposed the District of Columbia\r\ngovernment scandals involving “Boss” Shepherd and others connected with\r\nthe Washington City administration.\r\n\r\nThe noted whiskey ring frauds were perpetrated from 1869 to 1874 and\r\nwere exposed about the latter date. In those frauds a number of\r\nimportant United States government officials were implicated and the\r\nTreasury was defrauded out of over two millions thereby.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania State politics have for over half a century had the\r\nreputation of being extremely corrupt. One of its most noted political\r\nbosses was Simon Cameron, who was at the head of the principal\r\nPennsylvania ring for about twenty years prior to 1877. He was able more\r\nthan once to force or purchase his election as United States Senator and\r\nwas also able to deliver the vote of the State of Pennsylvania to\r\nLincoln in the Chicago Convention of 1860 thus defeating Seward. For\r\nthis service and as the result of a bargain then made he was appointed\r\nby Lincoln Secretary of War in 1861. His administration of that office\r\nwas so scandalous that he was soon compelled to resign. (_Arena_,\r\nJanuary, 1905.)\r\n\r\nThe Belknap War Department scandals covered the period from 1870 to\r\n1876. Belknap was Secretary of War and being threatened with impeachment\r\nresigned his office.\r\n\r\nThe Star Route frauds exposed in 1881 were the result of conspiracies\r\nbetween high post-office officials at Washington, a former United States\r\nSenator Dorsey of Arkansas and others. Large sums of government money\r\nwere obtained by means of fraudulent mail contracts.\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia._ Next to the New York Tweed Ring the most famous in\r\nAmerican municipal life was the Philadelphia gas ring (1870-1881). Its\r\nboss (Republican), named McManus, absolutely controlled about twenty\r\nthousand voters who were dependent on the ring in one way or another. No\r\ncandidate hostile to the ring could be nominated for office. The\r\npossession of the great city offices gave the ring members opportunity\r\nto make fortunes and at the same time the power to contribute large sums\r\nto the party funds. Great numbers of city employees were put under pay.\r\nThe debt of the city, which was $20,000,000 in 1860 rose in 1881 to\r\n$70,000,000. Finally a committee of one hundred citizens was created to\r\nobtain redress and there were legal proceedings against those implicated\r\nand some convictions. Referring to this episode a writer says:\r\n\r\n“Its debt (Philadelphia’s) increased at the rate of three millions a\r\nyear without any important improvement being introduced into the\r\nmunicipal plant; inefficiency, waste, badly paved and filthy streets,\r\nunwholesome and offensive water and a slovenly and costly management.\r\nThe ring manufactured majorities at the polls by means of frauds in the\r\nvoting and counting of the ballots; it bought votes wholesale and\r\nretail, forcing all those who received salaries from the city to provide\r\nthe wherewithal for corruption. The policemen themselves had to\r\ncontribute. Like the Tammany Ring, the Gas Ring stopped the mouth of the\r\npress by regular subsidies so that not a single paper could be found to\r\nplead the cause of honest government.” The story of the Philadelphia Gas\r\nRing is well told by Mr. Bryce. (_American Commonwealth._)\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia municipal scandals have been so numerous that they would\r\nrequire a volume to themselves to treat them fully. In 1901 there was\r\nthe Street Franchise scandal. Fourteen street franchises worth millions\r\nwere granted free by the Philadelphia city government to members of a\r\npolitical ring. As proof of the rascality of the transaction John\r\nWanamaker publicly offered the city $2,500,000 cash for these same\r\nfranchises, admitting that they were worth much more. The political\r\ncorruption there was said to equal that of anything ever known in New\r\nYork except in Tweed’s time. In certain parts of the city in 1905 about\r\nforty per cent of the vote cast was said to be fraudulent. “Crimes\r\nagainst the ballot box no longer seemed to affront the public\r\nconscience.”\r\n\r\nIn 1898 there was a great scandal in connection with the failure of the\r\nPeople’s Bank of Philadelphia in which United States Senator Quay and\r\nState Treasurer Haywood were implicated. About $500,000 state funds and\r\n$50,000 city funds disappeared and were never recovered.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 occurred the Grand Rapids Water Scandals. Bribes to the amount\r\nof $100,000 were distributed to City officials. The City Attorney was\r\nconvicted, and there were twenty-four indictments of ex-aldermen,\r\npoliticians, newspaper men and others.\r\n\r\n_Spanish War Scandals._ These were numerous. Here is one specimen of\r\nmany. In 1899 military goods were sold for $10,500 and purchased back\r\nfor $60,000. There were indictments and convictions.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1903, President Roosevelt instituted an investigation in the\r\nPost Office Department which resulted in the revelation of a large\r\nnumber of fraudulent contracts by which the government had been robbed\r\nof thousands of dollars, and the criminal conviction of two United\r\nStates senators.\r\n\r\n_St. Louis._ The following interesting story of political rascality\r\nappeared in _McClure’s_ in November 1902. In 1898 one Snyder, capitalist\r\nand promoter, came to St. Louis with a traction proposition inimical to\r\nthe interests of the city railways, who were then paying seven members\r\nof the council $5,000 each per year to protect them, besides paying\r\nanother councilman a special retainer of $25,000 to watch these seven\r\nboodlers. Snyder set about buying the members, who then went back on\r\ntheir first bargain, and arranged a meeting to see if they could not\r\nagree on a new price. The meeting broke up in a row and each man started\r\nin to work for himself. Four councilmen got from Snyder $10,000 each,\r\none got $15,000, another $17,500, another $50,000; twenty-five members\r\nof the House of Delegates got $3,000 each. In all Snyder paid $250,000\r\nfor the franchise, and as the traction people had raised only $175,000\r\nto beat it, the franchise was passed. Then Snyder sold out to his old\r\nopponents for $1,250,000. He was criminally convicted some years later\r\non charges growing out of this affair.\r\n\r\n_Missouri_--1903. Baking Powder Scandal. Various members of the\r\nlegislature charged with accepting bribes in connection with legislation\r\nin favor of the baking powder monopoly.\r\n\r\n1904--_Oregon Land Scandal_. Senator Mitchell, Congressman Williamson\r\nand others were charged with conspiracy and bribery in an attempt to\r\ndefraud the government. Two congressmen were convicted.\r\n\r\n_St. Louis._ In an editorial in the _Arena_ for January 1905 it is\r\nstated that in St. Louis free government has been destroyed by shameful\r\ncrimes; and in an article by Lee Meriwether, formerly Labor Commissioner\r\nfor Missouri, and author of a number of books of travel, the writer\r\ndescribes a transaction by which a street franchise was obtained in St.\r\nLouis in January 1902 by one Turner. The amount to be paid the municipal\r\ncouncil for the franchise was $135,000 which was put in a safety-vault\r\nbox of which an agent had one key and the boodlers the other. The\r\nfranchise was granted, but a citizen obtained an injunction from the\r\ncourts, whereupon the agent refused to pay. Afterwards Turner became\r\nState’s evidence; the box with the $135,000 was produced in court, a\r\nnumber of the members of the municipal council were convicted, and some\r\nfled the country.\r\n\r\n_California Legislature._ In 1905 the California Senate appointed a\r\ncommittee of seven to investigate alleged mismanagement of certain\r\nbuilding and land associations. A majority of the committee selected an\r\nagent to approach the officers of one of the associations, with the\r\nresult that the sum of $1400 was agreed upon and paid to stop the\r\ninvestigation. The agent confessed; four senators were expelled, and two\r\nwere convicted by the courts.\r\n\r\n_Ohio._ An important investigation was undertaken by the Drake Committee\r\nof the Ohio Senate in 1906. In inquiring into the affairs of Cincinnati,\r\nthe committee caused the return to the public treasury of over $200,000,\r\nwhich had been given as gratuities to (state) treasurers, by banks\r\nfavored in the deposit of Hamilton County funds.\r\n\r\n_New York Insurance Frauds._ A New York legislative committee\r\ninvestigated the great life insurance companies in 1905-6. Results\r\nshowed that Republican as well as Democratic legislators had been\r\nbought, and that enormous corruption funds had been contributed to both\r\npolitical parties. Bribery expenditures were classified on the various\r\ninsurance companies’ books as “legal expenses.” In 1904 alone, the\r\nMutual Life Insurance Company thus disbursed $364,254, the Equitable\r\nLife Assurance Society $172,698, the New York Life Insurance Company\r\n$204,019. From 1898 to 1904 the Mutual Company expended more than\r\n$2,000,000 in so-called “legal expenses” supposed to be payments to\r\ninfluence legislation. From 1895 to 1904 the total payments made by the\r\nNew York Life to its chief lobbyist at Albany were $1,312,197.\r\n\r\n_Boston, Mass._ In 1907 public hearings before a committee of\r\ninvestigation resulted in eleven indictments mostly of city officials\r\nand contractors for frauds against the city. Gross incompetency, neglect\r\nand non-efficiency of some of the city departments and officials and\r\nmismanagement of city business was revealed.\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania_, 1907. The State Capitol scandals. About $9,000,000 was\r\npaid for furniture for the State Capitol, being an excess of $6,000,000\r\nover actual cost. There were a number of criminal convictions of public\r\nofficials in connection with this affair.\r\n\r\n_San Francisco_--1907 and 1908. The Ruef Scandals. These related to the\r\nprocuring of street franchises by the bribery of members of the San\r\nFrancisco board of supervisors through the agency of Abraham Ruef, a\r\npolitical boss. Nearly one hundred indictments were filed, and there\r\nwere some confessions and convictions.\r\n\r\n_Lorimer Scandal._ A general corruption fund called “the jack-pot” was\r\nmade in 1908, from which payments were made to the Illinois legislators\r\nfor their votes. Lorimer was elected United States Senator, January\r\n11th, 1909, through a Republican-Democratic combination. There were\r\nnegotiations for the delivery of a block of fifteen votes at prices\r\nreported to be as high as $30,000. Certain votes were purchased at $900\r\nto $2500. There were judicial proceedings and some confessions.\r\n\r\n_The New York “Yellow Dog” Scandal._ On the investigation of charges\r\nthat Senator Allds of New York had in 1910 accepted money for preventing\r\nlegislation, it was shown that in the course of a few years two or three\r\njoint funds were raised among bridge-building companies for political\r\n“protection” at Albany. The names of a former speaker of the\r\nlegislature and another member, both dead, were given as having received\r\nthese bribes.\r\n\r\n_Colorado._ In the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_ for December, 1910, it was\r\nstated that on one occasion, when the franchises of some public service\r\ncorporations were in peril, a Republican leader took $20,000 of his\r\ncampaign fund to Democratic headquarters to save the day for his\r\n“interests.” As many as 8,000 fraudulent votes have been available in\r\nDenver for whichever party was slated by the “interests” to win.\r\n\r\n_Pennsylvania._ William Flinn, who together with Senator Quay was in\r\ncontrol of Republican politics for many years in Pennsylvania, testified\r\nbefore a senatorial committee in 1912 that he had contributed so far\r\nthat year nearly $150,000 to the political campaign, both for the work\r\nin the primaries before the convention, and for the presidential\r\ncampaign after the convention.\r\n\r\nIn an article entitled “Case of the Quaker City” (_Outlook_, May 25,\r\n1912) the writer states that Philadelphia has paid a contractor $520,000\r\neach year to remove its garbage, which he has then resold in the form of\r\nprofitable products; in an outlying district people have been arrested\r\nfor feeding their own garbage to their own pigs; the contractor wanted\r\nit. Upon a change of administration in 1912, over $800,000 of unpaid\r\nbills for 1911 and previous years were found. It required about\r\n$4,000,000 of borrowed money to make up the deficiency in appropriations\r\nfor current expenses for 1912, and about as much more to provide for\r\nroutine items of neglected maintenance, such as condemned boilers,\r\nelevators, dilapidated sewers, dangerous bridges. All this\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that, in addition to funds raised from taxation\r\nand other current revenue, $51,000,000 was borrowed in the last four\r\nyears with practically nothing to show for it. Commenting on this state\r\nof affairs the writer says:\r\n\r\n“To democracy are we committed. Does this mean that we are forever to\r\nlive loosely, scandalously, until nature rebels and we have to fly to a\r\nviolent cure, a political Carlsbad, a civil war, be cleansed only to\r\nbegin over again each time? Does the theory of democracy exact more than\r\nhuman nature has to give?”\r\n\r\n_Congress._ The United States Congress, judged by any proper ethical\r\nstandard, has been for a long time past a more or less corrupt body, as\r\nhas frequently appeared by its frequent large and scandalous\r\nmisappropriations of public funds made on the demand of a very low class\r\nof voters manipulated by rascally politicians. The money thus stolen and\r\nwasted has earned the euphonious title of “Pork,” and has usually been\r\ndistributed in the shape of appropriations for unnecessary public\r\nbuildings, or harbor improvements. Federal court houses costing very\r\nlarge sums have been extravagantly built and are being maintained in\r\nplaces where the court sits only a few days in a year, and where\r\ntherefore the hiring of a few rooms for the occasion of the court’s\r\nsession would have been sufficient. Among the items represented in the\r\nappropriation bill for 1913 are the following:\r\n\r\nThe City of New Haven, with a population of 180,000, for a post-office,\r\npink marble, $1,200,000.\r\n\r\nFor court houses:--\r\n\r\nAt Texarkana, Texas, where court is only held four days a year,\r\n$110,000. At Harrison, Arkansas, having a population of 1600, where\r\ncourt is only held nine days in a year, $100,000. At Evanston, Wyoming,\r\nhaving a population of 2500, where court is only held two days in a\r\nyear, $15,000. At Mariana, Fla., where court only sits two days a year,\r\n$70,000.\r\n\r\nGadsden, Alabama, a small town, Federal building, $188,000. At Anderson,\r\nS. C., a court house at $70,000 was ordered, and at Pikeville, Ky., and\r\nin twelve other towns where there was no court sitting, court houses\r\nwere voted.\r\n\r\nPost-office at Gainesville, Fla.: population 6000; cost $150,000.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia the Federal building at Big Stone, with a population of\r\nabout one thousand, cost or is costing $100,000 and a few years ago it\r\nwas stated that at that time there were twenty-five others being\r\nerected or recently built in that State in similar small towns costing\r\nfrom $5,000 to $75,000 each.\r\n\r\nExpensive post-offices were ordered at Newcastle, Wyoming, with a\r\npopulation of 975; Jasper, Ala., with a population of 2500; Vernal,\r\nUtah, with a population of 836, and another place with a population of\r\n942. Four other small towns in Utah each have expensive post-offices.\r\n\r\nThese are samples of the Federal Building Bill or “Pork” Bill as it was\r\ncalled, of 1913, amounting to $45,000,000, which was rushed through both\r\nhouses on the log-rolling principle. It was in effect a congressional\r\nconspiracy to plunder the government. Of this bill Senator Kern said\r\nthat it was the “boldest and most audacious raid on the public treasury\r\nthat has been attempted in recent years. The pork in this barrel is of\r\nsuch quality that it smells to Heaven.” This kind of rascality has been\r\nincreasing. There was bought a few years ago at Seattle for a federal\r\nbuilding at a cost of $160,000, land which was seven feet under water.\r\nIn 1906 the Federal Government had only 503 buildings in the United\r\nStates, and therefore the rate prior to that time had only been four new\r\nbuildings a year. In 1916 it had 967, an increase of 464, at the rate of\r\n46 a year for the preceding ten years. These appropriations were\r\ngenerally made with the object of getting the votes of political\r\ncontractors and laboring people, who are supposed to represent a\r\npropertyless class, and not being required to pay any direct taxes are\r\nbelieved to be indifferent to the depletion of the public treasury.\r\n\r\n_Pension Frauds._ Under President Cleveland the Commissioner of Pensions\r\nLockrien unearthed enormous pension frauds; he dropped 2266 names from\r\nthe rolls and reduced the ratings in 3343 cases. The cases of clear\r\nfraud amounted to $18,000,000 a year.\r\n\r\nFormer Secretary of War, Stimson, states that from 1878 to 1908 the cost\r\nof the Federal Government increased nearly 400 per cent, while the\r\nincrease in population was less than 84 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS MINOR SCANDALS.\r\n\r\n_Illinois_--1901. Investigation disclosed that $65,000 a year was being\r\ncollected by politicians from the salaries of those employed at the\r\nState Insane Hospital and other State Institutions.\r\n\r\n_Minnesota_--1903. Minneapolis City scandals. Conviction of Chief of\r\nPolice and an ex-Mayor on charges of blackmailing gamblers, etc.;\r\nattempted bribery of County Commissioners.\r\n\r\n_Land and Post-Office._ In 1903 politicians and others were indicted in\r\nNebraska for corrupt land and post-office transactions.\r\n\r\nOther similar post-office irregularities in McKinley’s administration,\r\nimplicating high officials; many indictments; gross department\r\nincompetence and carelessness revealed (1903).\r\n\r\n_New York_, 1904. Fire Department scandals, fraudulent hose purchases of\r\n$23,410.\r\n\r\n_Kansas_, 1905. Government land frauds implicating a state senator and\r\nother officials.\r\n\r\n_New York_, 1905. “The notorious ‘Ten’ carried through a scheme in the\r\nNew York Senate, by which the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railway bonds\r\nwere to be included in the savings bank bill as proper securities for\r\ninvestment. The ‘Black Horse Cavalry’ had succeeded in a similar deal\r\nformerly and members had made a large profit on the consequent\r\nappreciation of the bonds in question.” (_Reinsch_, p. 248.)\r\n\r\n_New York_--1906. Ahearn scandals; padded payrolls, illegal purchases,\r\netc., amounting to millions, involving office of Borough President.\r\n\r\n_New York_--1914. Hunts Point Bathing Place; value $4300, sold to the\r\nCity of New York in 1914 for $247,000.\r\n\r\n_Indiana_--1908. Conspiracy to defraud the State; former legislative\r\nspeaker indicted.\r\n\r\n_New Jersey_--1913. One Kuehnle, political boss of Atlantic City,\r\nsentenced to prison for voting as a water commissioner to award a\r\ncontract to a company of which he was a stockholder.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a book of about eight hundred pages, entitled _Thirty Years of\r\nNew York Politics_, was published by Breen who had been for a generation\r\nactive in New York politics and had held office as member of the state\r\nlegislature and as local magistrate. It presents a vivid picture of the\r\ncorruption, rascality and incapacity that characterized the politicians\r\nof New York City and State from about 1860 to 1890. He tells of\r\nforgeries of items in legislative tax bills, the true bills immediately\r\nafter passage by the legislature being altered by additions of items and\r\nthe forged tax bills placed before the governor and signed by him. Some\r\nof Breen’s tales are even amusing, showing the open way in which the\r\nbusiness of official bribery has been carried on and the fun there was\r\nsupposed to be in the business. In one instance there was a gas bill\r\nbefore the New York legislature opposed by the company interested. A\r\nlobbyist was in charge whose original orders to pass the bill were\r\nrevoked and he was directed to kill it. In order to make his services\r\nappear more valuable to the company the lobbyist had the bill reported\r\nfavorably. Subsequently he had it defeated and the members waited upon\r\nhim for their cash at the Kenmore House, Albany, N. Y., the fee of each\r\nbeing $250. Meantime another bill had been introduced regulating the\r\nprice of gas and the members were told that they would get nothing until\r\nthey also killed the second bill. This was very annoying as it required\r\nthem to do two jobs for one fee; but it had to be done. Then the\r\nlobbyist began paying off some of the members at the Kenmore House,\r\nAlbany, while to avoid suspicions which might be aroused by the presence\r\nof too many members in one place his assistant undertook to pay off the\r\nothers at the Delavan House. By mistake eight of the members got money\r\nat each hotel. When a return was demanded they, partly in joke and to\r\nworry the lobbyist, refused, claiming that as they had done two jobs\r\nthey were entitled to two fees; but finally the duplicate money was\r\nreturned to the alarmed lobbyist. The reader will thus see that there is\r\nsometimes entertainment as well as profit in the vote traffic, when well\r\nunderstood by the participants and spiritedly conducted. One veteran\r\nmember used to say that he considered it injurious to the health to have\r\nanything to do with a “contingent bill,” that is to say where the bribe\r\ndepended upon the result. “I never can sleep at all when I have a\r\ncontingent bill on my mind; it undermines my health and my life is\r\nvaluable to the state. Spot cash is my gait; it saves all bother.”\r\nAnother interesting incident told by Senator Breen is that of one\r\nHackley, a contractor, who put in a bid for a street-cleaning contract\r\nin New York. The aldermen delayed voting the contract. Hackley received\r\na letter unsigned requesting him to leave $40,000 in a package on a\r\ntable in the City Hall. He left the money in $500 bills on the\r\naldermanic table in a package without any address. As he entered to do\r\nso he saw four of the aldermen casually conversing by the door; when he\r\ncame out they were still standing there. Nothing was said. The next day\r\nhe got the contract. The courts were for some years occupied with some\r\nquestions of legality regarding this contract and incidentally this\r\nlittle episode came to light.\r\n\r\nIf the reader has been at all interested, or edified by the display\r\nalready made in this book of the product and operations of the manhood\r\nsuffrage governments, perhaps he would like a glimpse of the methods by\r\nwhich these worshipful bodies are from time to time originally created.\r\nHere is a specimen account of a recent event, taken from the _New\r\nRepublic_ of September 29, 1917. There was a contest for the Republican\r\nleadership of the Fifth Ward, Philadelphia, in which ward, as it\r\nhappens, Independence Hall is situated. The police were under the\r\ncontrol of a local boss named Deutsch who was himself subject to the\r\nVere Brothers. The opposition boss was named Carey. Ten days before\r\nelection thirty patrolmen were transferred to other districts and their\r\nplaces taken by men who could be relied on to work for Deutsch. There\r\nwere nightly fights and arrests; even reporters were arrested on false\r\ncharges of disorderly conduct. On the eve of election the followers of\r\nDeutsch attacked a Carey meeting while a number of police stood quietly\r\nby. The following morning a detective was murdered and a district\r\nattorney slugged. The mayor himself was accused and was subsequently\r\narrested on a charge of conspiracy in connection with the affair.\r\n\r\nAnother sample of manhood suffrage in operation was exhibited at the\r\nprimary elections at St. Louis in 1904 when Folk was nominated for\r\ngovernor of Missouri. A magazine writer describing what took place says\r\nthat the ring opposed to the nomination of Folk “stationed thugs outside\r\nthe polling places with orders to slug, kick, beat, and if necessary\r\nkill,--anything to defeat Folk,” and that scores of men, some of them\r\nprominent, were knocked down in broad daylight, kicked and beaten, etc.,\r\nwhile the police stood idly by. Also that “there have been instances\r\nwhere for weeks before an election members of the police department have\r\ngone about locating vacant houses and assisting in registering\r\nfictitious names from such houses” and he gives instances of houses\r\nwhere many more names were registered than it was possible there could\r\nbe residents at the house. The result was that of the population of\r\n600,000 people, not one delegate favorable to Folk was elected. “Former\r\nLieutenant Governor of Missouri, Norman J. Coleman, and Secretary of\r\nAgriculture under President Cleveland, stood long in line to vote,\r\nwithout making any progress. He stepped out to make an investigation and\r\nfound that men were being admitted into the polling place by a rear door\r\nand that there was no chance for him. Finally a politician whom he knew\r\ncame up to him and said: ‘I will get one of the men out of the line up\r\nhere and give you his place.’ As he was about to give Mr. Coleman the\r\nplace he asked him for whom he was going to vote. ‘For Folk, of course,’\r\nwas the answer. ‘Then I can’t do anything for you.’”\r\n\r\nThe intelligent reader needs no argument to convince him that under a\r\nrule of substantial property qualification none of the above described\r\nruffianism would find a place in politics. Under such a rule none of\r\nthese precious gangs would appear at the polls or primaries; their\r\nleaders would be without political influence; a mayor or governor\r\nsupported by such blackguards would never be chosen and would not even\r\nbe a candidate.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, Roosevelt, as Civil Service Commissioner, went to Baltimore to\r\nexamine the primaries and made a report from which Ostrogorski prints an\r\nextract. He there saw a fight for the offices between two factions of\r\nthe Republican party. There was fraud and violence. Democratic repeaters\r\nwere voted; accusations of ballot box stuffing freely made; a number of\r\nfights took place; many arrests, including some of the election\r\ninspectors; bribery was charged; cheating was talked of as a matter of\r\ncourse; men openly justified cheating as fair, provided you were not\r\ncaught. Usually, however, primaries and elections are comparatively\r\nquiet; the previous manipulation of the controllable vote has been so\r\nperfectly done, the managers are in such complete accord, and opposition\r\nis so hopeless, that even the most violent and headstrong of the\r\ndefeated party are subdued into silence, often no doubt quelled by\r\nenvious admiration for the victorious scoundrels. Such must for instance\r\nhave been the case at the elections in Colorado in 1904, when women\r\nvoted and they as well as men took part in wholesale frauds. In eight\r\nprecincts a thousand fraudulent votes were cast. Each candidate for\r\ngovernor charged gigantic frauds against the other. Investigation showed\r\nthat both charges were true. In one county nine thousand fraudulent\r\nvotes were cast. A number of election judges and others were convicted\r\nof ballot box stuffing, repeating, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 Helen Sumner made a prolonged investigation of political\r\nconditions in Colorado, and thus describes the failure of universal\r\nsuffrage in that new and prosperous state.\r\n\r\n“Both sexes stay away from caucus and convention because they know they\r\nare helpless and that they can succeed only by debasing themselves to\r\nthe level of hired political workers. The caucus and convention are\r\narranged long in advance. Corporations, the saloon element, and special\r\ninterests that seek control can afford to furnish the bosses abundant\r\nfunds to hire these professional workers, and both men and women who\r\nvalue their honor and patriotism will not descend to these mercenary\r\nmethods.” (_Equal Suffrage_, p. 94.)\r\n\r\nIt is useless to multiply instances of fraud and humbug at popular\r\nelections; the whole business is one gigantic piece of fraud and humbug.\r\nIts extent may most easily be described by the amount of money it costs.\r\nOstrogorski says that: “It is considered that in 1896 the Republican\r\nNational chairman disposed of a campaign fund of seven million dollars.\r\nIn 1900 of three millions and a half, and in 1904 of three millions.”\r\nThis national campaign fund of $3,000,000 to $7,000,000 is only a small\r\nportion of the total amount collected and disbursed for the purpose of\r\nmisleading, defrauding, deluding, and humbugging the nation into giving\r\na preference to one of two organized gangs over the other for two or\r\nfour years more. Probably from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000 in all is\r\nexpended in this way in a Presidential election. The latter figure is\r\nthe estimate of the historian Sloane. And then we are told with\r\nwell-simulated indignation of the expenditure of $2,000,000 a year for\r\nthe support of the British Royal family. If only our millions were spent\r\nas innocently as in maintaining royal dignity or dignity of any sort!\r\nBut our cash goes for the purpose of creating and maintaining\r\nindignities rather than dignities; to pay for the assertion and\r\npublication of lies and slanders; to stir up strife at home and abroad;\r\nto forward the interests of political managers and those behind them and\r\nto hire cheating and fraud at elections. The latter crimes are still\r\nbeing perpetrated. Wholesale election frauds were committed in New York\r\nCity at a recent mayoralty election and many election officials were\r\nconvicted. As late as November, 1919, there were widely distributed the\r\ncirculars of the “Honest Ballot Association,” whose officers included\r\nNew York men and women of considerable prominence and political\r\nexperience. Its object was stated to be “To insure clean elections in\r\nNew York City, and to prevent honest votes from being offset by trickery\r\nand fraud.” It states in its circular that “through its efforts the\r\nfraudulent vote of the city, which before its organization was a public\r\nscandal, has been materially reduced. Much remains to be done to prevent\r\nrecurrence of like frauds.” In other words, the public authorities of\r\nNew York City cannot be trusted to supervise and procure a fair\r\nelection, and it is generally believed that in that respect New York is\r\nbetter off than some other large cities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNine States of the Union, namely, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee,\r\nhave been driven by misgovernment in one form or other under the régime\r\nof manhood suffrage to repudiate their solemn financial obligations.\r\n\r\n_Alabama._ In 1819 the State of Alabama began to establish state banks,\r\nall of which became insolvent in 1842. To the debt of about $3,500,000\r\nincident to this business, represented by bonds held by innocent holders\r\nin London and New York, was added obligations amounting to $21,000,000\r\nincurred in the negro suffrage reconstruction period, elsewhere\r\ndescribed. In 1876 the State scaled down the whole debt to $12,574,379,\r\na repudiation, including interest, of about $15,000,000 State debt.\r\n\r\n_Arkansas._ In 1837 and 1838 Arkansas issued about $3,000,000 of bonds\r\nin aid of two state banks. Part of this debt was subsequently\r\nrepudiated. During the reconstruction period about $8,000,000 of state\r\nbonds were issued under legislative authority for railroad and levee\r\nconstruction and all were repudiated in 1880, thus reducing the state\r\ndebt from $17,000,000 principal and interest to about $5,000,000.\r\n\r\n_Florida._ In 1833 the Territory of Florida issued $3,000,000 bonds to\r\nthe Union Bank, and in 1831 and 1835 $900,000 more to other banks. These\r\nobligations were definitely repudiated when Florida entered the Union\r\nin 1845. Under an Act passed in 1855, the state issued $4,000,000 bonds\r\nin aid of railroad construction; and these also have been repudiated, on\r\nthe claim that the legislature lacked authority to authorize them.\r\n\r\n_Georgia._ From 1868 to 1871 the State of Georgia issued about\r\n$8,000,000 of bonds in aid of railroad construction. In the years 1875,\r\n1876 and 1877 all these bonds were repudiated by state legislation.\r\n\r\n_Louisiana._ The debt of Louisiana at the outbreak of the Civil War was\r\nabout $10,000,000. The Civil War debt was ignored. Reconstruction\r\nlegislation brought up the state debt to about $50,000,000. This was\r\nscaled down by legislative enactment to $12,000,000 and the rest\r\nrepudiated.\r\n\r\n_Mississippi._ In June 1838 the State of Mississippi issued $5,000,000\r\nof state bonds in payment of five thousand shares of stock in the Union\r\nBank of Mississippi. Four years later these bonds, then held by innocent\r\nthird parties, were repudiated by the state, although the highest court\r\nin Mississippi had declared that they were legally issued. A similar\r\nissue of $2,000,000 of state bonds issued to the Planters Bank was\r\nrepudiated in 1852. The State of Mississippi has never redeemed its\r\nhonor or paid the bonds.\r\n\r\n_North Carolina._ In 1879 North Carolina passed a funding bill by which\r\nin settlement of a long controversy with its bond-holders it repudiated\r\nabout $15,000,000 of State indebtedness. Bonds issued before the Civil\r\nWar were redeemed at fifty cents on the dollar; bonds issued after the\r\nwar to secure pre-war debts at twenty-five cents; and reconstruction\r\nbonds at fifteen cents on the dollar.\r\n\r\n_South Carolina._ South Carolina was in debt about $3,800,000 at the\r\ntime the Civil War began in 1861. The war debt was repudiated. The\r\nreconstruction debt amounted to nobody knows how much, say $20,000,000\r\nand upwards. Nearly all of the state debt was practically repudiated in\r\n1879 and prior thereto.\r\n\r\n_Tennessee._ In 1852 the State of Tennessee authorized the issuance of\r\nstate bonds in aid of turnpike and railroad companies. There were also\r\nstate debts incurred in aid of state banks, for the building of the\r\nstate capitol and other purposes; in all $21,000,000. About $14,000,000\r\nmore bonds were issued after the war in aid of railroads. In 1883 the\r\nstate repudiated about one-half of this debt.\r\n\r\nThe various acts of repudiation took different shapes in different\r\nstates, but in every instance the state government was a manhood\r\nsuffrage institution; none of them have had any other system. It is\r\nperfectly fair to charge every dollar of these stolen and wasted\r\nmillions and every repudiation spot and stain on the fame and record of\r\nthese nine states to manhood suffrage. In fact the candid historian\r\ncannot, if he would, escape the damning record and the inevitable\r\nconclusion. Manhood suffrage has shamefully bankrupted and dishonored\r\nnine American states.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOh, that some one with ability, money and patience would get together\r\nmaterials for a complete “History of Manhood Suffrage,” and with clear\r\nand burning pen, would give to the world the story of its iniquitous\r\ncentury career. Even if he omitted its record of blood and corruption in\r\nFrance, and confined himself to this country, the work might easily\r\nswell to many volumes. He could spend twenty busy years visiting one\r\nvillage, town and city after another, gathering up the facts and figures\r\nof the briberies, corruptions, frauds, cheatings, embezzlements,\r\ndefalcations and thefts; the public riots, the drunkenness, the civil\r\nand criminal court proceedings, directly produced by manhood suffrage;\r\nthe story of the rogues and incompetents whom it has put in public\r\noffices high and low, their follies and villainies. Its grotesque\r\nlegislation, its wretched administration, its wastes, extravagances,\r\nblunders stupidities and misgovernments would fill an encyclopedia of\r\nhuman unwisdom. But no such work has ever been undertaken, and this\r\nvolume only presents a hint of the direful totality. After all it is\r\nenough. The category of official crime in this one chapter contained is\r\nsufficiently convincing.\r\n\r\nThese fifty cases are not like fifty instances of peculation discovered\r\nby expert eyes under a watchful system, leaving it pretty certain that\r\nthere was no more behind. Fifty individual thefts in eighty years would\r\nnot make a shocking story as the world goes. But this collection is\r\nmerely illustrative of an immense mass of similar material which cannot\r\nbe produced to the home reader any more than an ore bed could; though\r\nthe existence thereof any one may verify by proper investigation. The\r\nopportunities of public men for improper acquisition are limitless;\r\nthere is no one over them to prevent them: they are themselves the\r\nwatchmen; and if they work with outside rogues detection is ordinarily\r\nimpossible. The discovery of each of these fifty instances was the\r\nresult of a blunder on the part of these very careful and intelligent\r\nthieves; of a quarrel amongst themselves, a mere chance of some sort,\r\nand by the law of chances may be taken to represent fifty thousand\r\nsimilar undetected frauds. Consider too the character of many of these\r\nitems; some represent a foul episode in the history of a state; others\r\nin that of a great city; in one case the fact that the politics of a\r\nrich commonwealth have been corrupt for half a century is compressed\r\ninto a statement of a few lines which is capable of being expanded to a\r\nvolume of separate accusations. Fifty years of spoliation of a great\r\nstate: eighteen thousand days; say one hundred separate acts a day: one\r\nmillion eight hundred thousand large and petty frauds, thefts and\r\npeculations are crowded into this single chapter. Each of the fifty\r\nforegoing items affords a glimpse at rivers, seas, regions of official\r\nrascality. In one case it is a state legislature which goes wrong. This\r\nmeans that back of each of its tainted members there is a whole history\r\nof putridity, a rotten county, a score of rotten townships, years of\r\nlocal crookedness, trickery, intrigue, falsehood, bribery and\r\ncorruption. The district and county which sells or traffics its honors;\r\nwhich sends an unworthy man to represent it in the councils of the\r\nnation, must itself first have undergone a process of degeneration the\r\ndetails whereof would alone require a volume. The instances in the\r\nforegoing list do not represent individual or sporadic cases of disease;\r\nthey indicate a moral pestilence, the result of widespread filth and\r\nunsanitary conditions of long standing and the existence whereof is\r\nproven by the additional testimony of the array of intelligent, unbiased\r\nand high-minded men and women, statesmen, students, publicists, lawyers\r\nand teachers, already quoted. Taking the whole evidence together, the\r\nrecord and the witnesses, it amounts to a mass of absolutely convincing\r\nand even overwhelming proof of the thoroughly evil and corrupt character\r\nof this government which for the past eighty years has been imposed upon\r\nthe American people by the political oligarchy directing the\r\ncontrollable vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR YEARS CIVIL WAR IN THE UNITED STATES IS DIRECTLY CHARGEABLE TO\r\nMANHOOD SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Civil War, which lasted four years, was both morally and\r\npolitically absolutely unnecessary and therefore absolutely\r\nunjustifiable. It is difficult for an American to discuss the subject\r\ncoolly even at this distance, when he realizes that this, the greatest\r\ncalamity which ever befell the country, was perfectly avoidable and was\r\ndue entirely to stupidity and mismanagement. It is time that the truth\r\nwas told; the Civil War was caused, not by the difficulty of the\r\nquestions to be dealt with but by a lack of statesmanship, by the dull\r\nselfishness and asininity of the politicians of the day and by the\r\nsystem of low politics which had long before been established among us.\r\nTo say that the question between the free and the slave states was of a\r\nnature which required a settlement by the sword is absurd. In 1860 there\r\nwere fifteen slave and eighteen free states. The constitutional right of\r\nthe former to the ownership of their slaves could not be denied; and the\r\nvast majority of the people in the free states so believed and asserted.\r\nThe question on which the country was divided was whether slavery could\r\nor should be established in the Territories and in the new states to be\r\nerected from the Territories. To assert that that question could not be\r\nsettled peaceably is to assert either that the American people were\r\nfools and brutes, which is not true, or that their representatives\r\nhaving the matter in hand were incapables or worse, which is true. The\r\nwar was entirely due to the conduct and misconduct of the politicians in\r\npower and they were placed there by manhood suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe American people North and South at that time were as harmless and\r\npeaceable a people as ever existed on the face of the earth. They did\r\nnot want any war, least of all a civil war. Tens of thousands of\r\ninhabitants in each of the two sections had dear friends and relatives\r\nin the other section. Most people refused even to believe it possible\r\nuntil hostilities actually began that a civil war could possibly be\r\nforced upon the country. Neither side was in any way prepared either in\r\nmen, officers, equipment, ships or money for even a small war. There was\r\nno desire for a conflict on either side, and no need of it; and yet it\r\ncame; because the country was in the hands not of patriotic statesmen,\r\nbut of a manhood suffrage politician President, and a manhood suffrage\r\npolitician Congress, infused with a small, mean, manhood suffrage\r\nspirit, the spirit of humbug, of selfishness, of insincerity, and of\r\nmoral cowardice. It came because for his own petty temporary purposes,\r\neach of the politicians, too dull and short sighted to see the danger of\r\nhis own acts, had been for years nagging the people of his own district\r\ninto dislikes, suspicions and hates towards the people of other\r\ndistricts and portions of the country.\r\n\r\nWe may concede the difficulties of the situation. The slavery question\r\nhad been so mismanaged that as far back as 1844 it had become a delicate\r\none needing to be handled with patriotic and enlightened statesmanship;\r\nbut the men in public life qualified to so handle it were after 1828\r\nbecoming fewer and fewer. Of courageous and patriotic statesmen there\r\nwas after 1852 scarcely one in public life, and it was finally left to\r\nthe newspapers and the populace, who undertook to deal with it\r\nthemselves in their own characteristic way. This of course was to hold\r\npublic meetings, at which were made inflammatory and abusive speeches;\r\nto publish and circulate these speeches with furious newspaper comments;\r\nand to issue books and pamphlets denunciatory of everybody in public\r\nlife. How does the ordinary manhood suffrage politician, the mediocrity\r\nwho after obeying orders of vulgar bosses for years finds himself\r\nrewarded with a nomination for Congress; how does he deal with a\r\nquestion where both money and feeling are involved? He “side-steps”; he\r\npussy-foots; he twists and dodges and sneaks in and out till one side or\r\nthe other shows a decided preponderance of votes, and then he mounts the\r\nplatform and rants defiance and insults at the minority. Such is his\r\nidea of statesmanship; and though it makes the judicious grieve it\r\ntickles the ears of the groundlings who are the majority of the\r\norganization followers. The newspaper files inform us and the reader can\r\nreadily imagine how for years Northern and Southern orators hurled\r\ndefiance at safe distances; how the holders of perfectly honest opinions\r\non both sides were publicly insulted every day in the week as slave\r\ndrivers; nigger lovers, dough-faces, etc. When the legal question of the\r\nrights of slavery in the territories came up, there was no one to decide\r\nit; it was a difference demanding for its settlement a courage which\r\nmere politicians never have; and requiring as well a statesmanship and\r\ntact which are qualities of trained thinkers; of men of wide vision; of\r\nexperience in public affairs, and gifted with self-control; qualities in\r\nshort which especially belong to the well-educated classes. It should\r\nhave been dealt with by picked men; men of high prestige; uncontrolled\r\nby passion, and above a desire for the plaudits of the mob. Such men\r\nwere not to be found in public life; and so it was left to the decision\r\nof what was called public opinion; which means in effect that it fell\r\ninto the hands of demagogues, platform orators, second-rate politicians,\r\nextremists, visionaries and newspaper writers. Thousands of individuals\r\nhonest and dishonest; fanatics, abolitionists and demagogues on the\r\nNorthern side, and cranks, general humbugs and notoriety seekers on the\r\nSouthern side, began to write and talk on the subject; and when they had\r\nsucceeded in irritating everybody, and when a certain emotional and\r\nhysterical class was thoroughly inflamed, the manhood suffrage machine\r\nwas put in operation and an election for president was had. The voters\r\nsplit into four parties; certainly not according to reason, which had\r\nlong before been flung to the winds by most of them; but rather\r\naccording to temperament; the more excitable and intolerant taking an\r\nextreme position; the others offering the customary political\r\nplatitudes. The electoral college plan for the election of the\r\npresident, which had been prescribed by the Constitution to obviate just\r\nsuch a catastrophe, had been long since foolishly discarded by the\r\npeople in favor of a direct election by manhood suffrage. Lincoln, a\r\nthen comparatively unknown man, who had been nominated in a roaring\r\npolitical convention, was elected President of the United States by a\r\nminority of the total vote. A few of the Southern states whose\r\npoliticians were dissatisfied with the election promptly proposed to\r\nsecede from the Union. They were permitted to do so and set up\r\nindependent governments; the administration at Washington being as usual\r\nin the hands of men who had neither sufficient diplomacy, firmness,\r\ndecision nor patriotism to deal with the situation, or with any other\r\nrequiring the employment of honesty and courage.\r\n\r\nThe politicians in power at Washington, as they were incapable of\r\nproperly dealing with slavery, so they were incapable of properly\r\ndealing with secession. As nothing timely was done to coerce the first\r\nseceding states they were in time joined by others; the demagogic rant\r\nand newspaper clamor and abuse continued unabated on both sides, but\r\nnothing practical was done to save the situation or to preserve the\r\nUnion; the seceding states were allowed four months to consummate their\r\nplans; and were permitted without molestation or hindrance to seize one\r\nfort and arsenal after another, until the enterprise of rebellion,\r\nwhich, originating in a few hot heads could have been summarily\r\nsuppressed in December 1860 had in April 1861 resulted in the\r\nestablishment of a southern armed confederacy of eleven states. Meantime\r\nthe Northern Democracy looked on complacently and did nothing till the\r\nSouth made the dramatic blunder of firing on Fort Sumter. Sluggishness\r\nand indifference in the North were now succeeded by indignation and\r\nfury; hostilities began and lasted four years; hundreds of thousands of\r\nlives and thousands of millions of property were uselessly sacrificed,\r\nand all because among the governing politicians of the United States\r\nthere had not been enough patriotic statesmanship to undertake the task\r\nof devising and enforcing a peaceable arrangement. That there was no\r\ninherent difficulty in the case, insurmountable by diplomacy, is\r\nperfectly apparent to any intelligent mind; and is almost conclusively\r\ndemonstrated by the conceded fact that even after four years’ bloody\r\nstrife no hopeless division between North and South existed; that the\r\ndefeated Southern rank and file and their leaders, officers and generals\r\nadmitted that they had even then no insufferable grievance; that they\r\nreally preferred the Union, even without slavery, to disunion; and that\r\nthe Southerners immediately came back into their places as citizens of\r\nthe Union and have ever since been and still are as true and loyal to\r\nthe flag as the northern population. They never really disliked the\r\nFederal Union; they had in fact always loved it; but they had been\r\ncrazed year after year in the course of one political campaign after\r\nanother by the assaults and insults of Northern platform press and\r\npulpit ranters, and had been deceived, misled and egged on to violence\r\nby their own demagogues. It was a case of the cumulative effect of years\r\nof repeated word provocations and word retorts on both sides; all\r\ndelivered either to promote the sale of wicked and sensational\r\nnewspapers or for electioneering purposes, or to capture the votes of a\r\nsenseless rabble. The effect of this long-continued agitation was to\r\nderange the shallow judgment of the irresponsibles, a class which\r\nincludes hot-headed youths, lovers of turmoil, improvident men with more\r\nsail than ballast; those who lack prudence both in politics and in\r\nbusiness; who show the same poor judgment in giving a vote as in making\r\na bargain; who are as willing to rush into a foolish war as into a\r\nfoolish business enterprise; who are reckless because, never having\r\nmuch, they can never lose much; in short, that class who, though\r\nabsolutely unable to manage their own affairs, are by our laws\r\nconsidered quite capable of attending to those of the community, and who\r\nwhenever a storm arises lose their heads and do their best to wreck the\r\nship. In a word, the course of conduct adopted by the politicians of the\r\ncountry which resulted in the war was intended to win the applause and\r\nthe votes of a set of men most of whom should not have been allowed to\r\nvote at all. Had the business men and the propertied classes alone been\r\nconsulted the civil war would never have broken out.\r\n\r\nAnd it is to-day just as it was then. When any question capable of being\r\nmade the subject of political discussion, and having an emotional or\r\nsympathetic aspect, is brought before the public, it is sure to be\r\nseized upon by fanatics and time servers who make it the subject of\r\nclamor and vociferation. These are in time joined by a lot of honest but\r\ninexperienced youth; emotional enthusiasts; sympathetic women more or\r\nless hysterical; people with grudges to pay off; political adventurers;\r\nplatform ranters eager for an audience; demagogues out of a job and vain\r\nfools anxious for the lime light; empty heads who find society and\r\nexcitement in political organizations and meetings. These classes of\r\nagitators and the followers of agitators exist and have always existed\r\nhere as well as in Russia and elsewhere; and they are put in the front\r\nwhen they ought to be suppressed and sent to the rear or out of sight.\r\nThey are apt to be abnormal in vanity, and stop at nothing to obtain\r\nnotoriety. Those of them who are soft and emotional become crazed with\r\nmental dwelling on one subject, with the excitement of political\r\nspeaking and the applause and criticism they receive; those of them who\r\nare cold of heart and head keep up the din to attract attention to\r\nthemselves and to further their political fortunes; with them the end\r\njustifies the means; exaggerations, dishonest equivocations, lies and\r\neven slanders are to their small minds justified by the object to be\r\nattained. We have, for instance, recently seen some of the women\r\nsuffragists both in England, and to a less extent here, in what they\r\ncall their militant campaigns act on the principle that there are no\r\nmorals in politics. In England they resorted to open and violent\r\nmisconduct and even to crime to keep up the agitation. Their avowed\r\npurpose in doing this was to keep their cause before the public, and as\r\nto some of them incidentally to earn the salaries paid by their\r\nassociations for this vile work. They believed, and with good reason,\r\nthat under a system of manhood suffrage mere arguments are insufficient;\r\nthe unthinking rabble had to be won over; and their foolish ears must be\r\nfilled with noise in order to gain and keep their attention.\r\n\r\nA similar process was used by the politicians and agitator’s on both\r\nsides of the negro slavery question. There was the unreasoning vote to\r\nbe captured. Each candidate for Congress, instead of desiring the matter\r\namicably settled, wished rather to use the dispute as a means for his\r\nown election. Now, it is a fact well known to politicians that it is\r\nimpossible to get all the voters to the polls at any election. Besides\r\nsecuring the floaters by means of agents with cash and shrewdness, the\r\nbest way to induce the remaining nondescripts and light weights to take\r\nthe trouble to vote, is to create artificial excitement by means of\r\nmeetings, processions, bands of music and inflammatory oratory. The\r\nopposite side and their leaders must be denounced as fools, humbugs,\r\nliars, scamps, thieves and traitors. The wisest are repelled by this\r\ncourse, but they are a minority in every community. Besides, some of the\r\nmen who know better than to believe an unscrupulous demagogue, will vote\r\nfor him, partly out of gratitude because he has amused them by his\r\nattacks on his opponents, partly because he is the party candidate, and\r\npartly as the result of a sort of mental contagion. Now, it was this\r\ncampaign of inflammatory denunciation; this output of lies, slanders and\r\nvilification indulged in by the platform talkers on all sides in the\r\npolitical campaigns of 1856, 1858 and 1860 that brought on the Civil\r\nWar. This is well known; but what is not known and never will be known\r\nis just how much of this rascally oratory was hired and paid for in\r\ncold cash contributed by that class of people who always contribute to\r\nelection funds. And this brutal and stupid process is the natural and\r\ninevitable result of an attempt to decide important political questions\r\nby manhood suffrage, that is by a public agitation undertaken to obtain\r\nthe votes of the most thoughtless, careless, dull and unreasonable men\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nBut, some may ask, how could the slavery question have been amicably\r\nsettled? Was not the Civil War inevitable? By no means. Great Britain,\r\nSpain, Brazil, Portugal, Holland and other countries each had the same\r\nproblem. Russia had a similar one in the case of her serfs. Slavery in\r\nthe British West Indies was abolished in 1838 at a cost of $100,000,000\r\ncash compensation paid to the masters, and other European nations having\r\ncolonial slaves had followed England’s example. Brazil and Cuba were\r\nboth large slave-owning countries; in Cuba one-third of the population\r\nwas at one time in slavery; a much larger proportion than in the United\r\nStates, and yet in both countries emancipation was gradually and\r\npeaceably accomplished by legal methods. In Russia the serfs were freed\r\nwithout bloodshed. Nowhere except in the United States was it found\r\nnecessary to make the country a shambles to accomplish such an\r\ninevitable reform. To say that the American people are so inferior in\r\npolitical capacity to the British, Russians, Spaniards and Brazilians as\r\nthis miserable emancipative Civil War of ours would indicate is\r\npreposterous.\r\n\r\nThat the Civil War was a politicians’ and not a people’s war was\r\nperfectly apparent at the time to all steady-minded folk. During its\r\nprogress nothing was more frequent than to hear such people say that the\r\npoliticians were responsible for it all. And this was true. Had the\r\nsettlement of the matter been left to a committee of statesmen or\r\nbusiness men the result would have been that under some system of\r\ngradual emancipation and payment to the owners the thing would have been\r\nquietly done, and with a great saving of money. The war cost at the\r\nlowest possible estimate twenty thousand millions of dollars. There were\r\nin this country say three millions of slaves which at the high figure of\r\n$500 each would have cost not more than fifteen hundred millions of\r\ndollars or less than a twelfth of the cost of the war in money, to say\r\nnothing of human lives. Even this cost would have been nominal, since\r\nthe outlay would have been divided up amongst our own people and left\r\nthe nation not a cent the poorer. But this plain and sensible course\r\ncould not be adopted because under our mobocratic system the question\r\nwas made one of politics rather than of statesmanship. And when the\r\nstruggle was over were the politicians blamed or called to account; or\r\nwas the system condemned which produced them and really brought about\r\nthe American Civil War? Not at all. The same humbugs and schemers\r\ncontinued in control; once more they were seen on political platforms,\r\ngreedy and brassy as ever, bellowing hypocritical praise of the victims\r\nof the fight and demanding and obtaining continued offices and salaries\r\nand perquisites for themselves; and so their course of public plundering\r\nwas vigorously continued and their rule was strengthened year by year.\r\nWith one hand deep in the public chest, they waved the banner with the\r\nother, and the years immediately succeeding the Civil War were perhaps\r\nricher in patriotic platform oratory and in political corruption than\r\nany the country has ever seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n     FAILURE AND CONDEMNATION OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE AFTER A TEN YEARS’\r\n     EXPERIMENT IN THE SOUTHERN STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most noted instance of a complete test of the principles\r\nupon which manhood suffrage claims to be founded was that made in the\r\nSouthern States during the so-called reconstruction period from 1866 to\r\n1876, when the establishment by the Federal Government of unrestricted\r\nsuffrage in a dozen states where a considerable part of the population\r\nwas composed of negroes resulted in a complete and even scandalous\r\nfailure. It not only failed in the opinion of the world at large, but\r\neven in that of most if not all its supporters, and finally had to be\r\nabandoned; so that in all those dozen states where most of the laborers\r\nand many of the farmers to the number of about two millions of voters\r\nare negroes, they have been for the last forty years and upwards\r\nexcluded from the polls.\r\n\r\nFor the ten years, however, from 1866 to 1876, which was the period of\r\nthe manhood suffrage experiment, they were permitted and urged to vote,\r\nunder the protection of the Federal Government. At the close of the\r\nCivil War in 1865, when the conquered Southern States had undertaken to\r\nestablish state governments on the basis of white suffrage, Congress and\r\nthe Federal Government had interposed the strong arm and required\r\nnegroes to be included in the electorate; thus making pure manhood\r\nsuffrage the foundation of the new state governments. In so doing the\r\nFederal Government was logically right, upon any and all of the manhood\r\nsuffrage theories. On none of them can the negro vote be properly\r\nrejected. The southern negroes were natives of the soil, free,\r\nself-supporting, and intensely loyal to the government. Whether you\r\nadopt the theory of a natural right to vote, or that the ballot is a\r\nweapon of defence for the poor, or that it is an educative force, or\r\nthat the desires of all classes should be represented in the vote, the\r\nnegroes’ claim to the franchise was and is well made out.\r\n\r\nThe trial of manhood suffrage that was actually made in the instance\r\nreferred to was in all respects a fair and good test of its qualities.\r\nIt was of course a severe one, because the negroes were very numerous\r\nand mostly very ignorant; but for that very reason the test was\r\nvaluable. To ascertain the real effects of ignorance and incapacity as\r\nof other elements, they must be tried out as far as possible without\r\ndilution or mixture. In this instance the amount of both that was\r\ninjected into the body politic was greater than the dose which the\r\nNorthern electorate has received, but the effect _pro tanto_ was the\r\nsame. The test was unusually good for another reason, namely, because it\r\nwas suddenly applied and as suddenly ended, and therefore the period of\r\nits operation is distinctly separated from the time before and after, so\r\nthat the comparison between the negro suffrage epoch and that of the\r\nbefore and after period is clear and easily made. Again, the trial was\r\ngood because it was applied to large regions of country, all parts of\r\nwhich were inhabited by great numbers of the newly made voters,\r\namounting to hundreds of thousands in all; so that merely local causes\r\ncould not be said to affect the result. And further, the negroes were,\r\ngenerally speaking, illiterate and propertyless; and this circumstance\r\nalso helped to make the test more clear and certain; for the claim of\r\nthe extreme manhood suffragists everywhere is and has been that the poor\r\nand lowly are above all entitled to the vote.\r\n\r\nSo here we have had a trial in our own country of manhood suffrage plain\r\nand simple; of the much vaunted system applied to a class of people who\r\nmost needed the so-called uplifting power or influence of the ballot.\r\nHere were the negroes, simple, poor, unsophisticated, unspoiled by the\r\npossession of wealth, the ideal people of the radical orator and\r\nphilosopher. They were docile and religious, being nearly all\r\nevangelical Christians; very much under the influence of their\r\nclergymen; intensely patriotic and devoted to the government and the\r\nflag. In short the southern negroes at the close of the war, as was then\r\npointed out by their friends, had every quality to entitle them to vote\r\nexcept book learning, business experience and property, neither of which\r\nin the eyes of the champions of manhood suffrage is essential to the\r\nvoter. Other conditions there were favorable to the success of the\r\nexperiment. The new voters did not have to construct a state, a social\r\npolity, or a code of laws, or to establish public order. The framework\r\nof a well-developed republican government was already erected; the\r\nstatute books contained the political wisdom of a highly civilized and\r\nfree people; they had the United States government to guide and\r\nencourage them; there was perfect order everywhere, and a friendly and\r\nwell-disciplined army was quartered among them to maintain it and to\r\nprotect them in the exercise of their rights. They had therefore that\r\nguidance, precedent and protection, the lack of which has been said to\r\nhave caused the failure of similar attempts by peoples unpractised in\r\nself-government. Besides all this, they had abundance of moral support\r\nand enthusiastic sympathy. At that time the Republican party organs\r\nclaimed a monopoly of patriotic enlightenment, and throughout the great\r\nNorth and West a large portion of the most intelligent and vociferous\r\nAmerican press, including nearly all the Republican newspapers, also two\r\nthirds of the protestant clergy, besides moral and political orators by\r\nthe thousand, justified and applauded the proposal to give the vote to\r\nthe late slaves then and at once without delay or qualification, and\r\npoured out the slush and uttered the gush appropriate to such\r\nagitations. The project was enthusiastically heralded as a “Reform,” as\r\na “Liberal Measure,” as an inevitable step in advance; as a carrying out\r\nand logical application of democratic doctrines; it was proudly pointed\r\nto as an evidence of our superiority in wisdom over our ancestors. The\r\ncry was that the ballot is a natural right; that the republican legend\r\nis not that some men, white men, educated men, or propertied men may\r\nvote; but that all men have an absolute right to the suffrage; a right\r\ninherent in man as man: and was not the freedman a man and a native of\r\nthe soil? The ballot, said they, is a weapon of defense, needed more by\r\npoor peasants and laborers be they white, black or brown than by any\r\nother class. What if the negroes were ignorant and easily led; give them\r\nthe vote and they would swiftly acquire learning and strength of\r\ncharacter. People talked as if the ballot box was a cure-all; as if\r\nthere was a sort of magic in it; as if merely to handle it was\r\nsalvation; without it, said they, man is still a slave and can never be\r\nexpected to improve; nor can the community rise while he is\r\n“disfranchised” as they expressed it; but with the ballot in hand he\r\nwill at once mount to meet his opportunities. This arrant nonsense has\r\nbeen recently made familiar to us by the woman suffragists and need not\r\nbe further recapitulated.\r\n\r\nThe negroes were thereupon invited to go through all the performances in\r\nwhich the white masses had long been accustomed to display themselves;\r\nand, as a Chinaman once said, to exercise their ignorance. They, and\r\nespecially the fools and idlers among them, responded with alacrity.\r\nThey talked politics at great length; those who could read fed their\r\nminds with newspaper rubbish; they attended political meetings addressed\r\nby frothy orators and office seekers just as many white people do, and\r\nlike them they fell under the leadership of designing demagogues some of\r\nwhom speedily learned to be competent rivals in rascality to many white\r\npoliticians. Of course the colored peoples’ political orators were of a\r\nnew crop; the old-fashioned pretentious white humbugs who had deceived\r\nand tongue lashed the southern people into a heartless and hopeless\r\ninsurrection were out of the running, or, driven to the side of the\r\ndismayed and discouraged conservatives, stood hungrily envying the luck\r\nof their late servants. In vain the better class of the whites protested\r\nagainst the prospect of being squeezed by this new and ignorant\r\ndemocracy out of whatever the war had left them; their protests were\r\nreceived with derision by the radical and enlightened North. They and\r\ntheir minority of conservative northern sympathizers were stigmatized as\r\nwould-be autocrats, aristocrats, oppressors of the poor; old time\r\nBourbons unable to grasp new ideas; this and that piece of wisdom had\r\nnot “dawned” on them; with their antiquated brains they could not\r\nrealize the beauty and power of true democracy carried to the limit,\r\netc. The controversy between the southern whites and the new colored\r\ndemocracy was given great prominence in excited political discussions\r\nall over the country; in most states the general elections were made to\r\nturn upon this question; all the sentimental “highbrows” and the same\r\nclass of emotionalists and enthusiasts who are now advocating woman\r\nsuffrage were then supporting negro suffrage; to oppose it was to be\r\nignorant or antiquated. The friends of unlimited suffrage carried state\r\nafter state in the North and West by majorities far exceeding those\r\nsince recorded in favor of woman suffrage, and the negro was by Federal\r\nauthority given the vote in every southern state.\r\n\r\nThe first elections, of course, went off successfully; nothing is easier\r\nor requires less intelligence than to cast a ballot; a child of ten\r\nyears can be taught the trick in an hour. The negroes voted in great\r\nnumbers; and the cry went up from pulpits and other mouthpieces of\r\nAmerican super-intelligence, from newspaper offices and political\r\nplatforms, “Behold one more triumph for universal suffrage!” That is\r\nwhat they called it, for at that time the notion of giving the vote to\r\nnegresses had not become popular. That is a later fad reserved for our\r\nday; the great American people usually amuses itself with but one\r\npolitical folly at a time. The negro had shown himself to be a qualified\r\nvoter according to the only recognized test, namely, ability to talk and\r\nto vote in droves under leadership. As for office-holding capacity it\r\nis and always has been a fact that uncultivated men, white or black,\r\nusually apply and can apply but one test to a political candidate; that\r\nof eloquence. If he has but a winning tongue most of them consider him\r\ncompetent for any office no matter how difficult its duties. The colored\r\npeople produced men of their race who readily reached the standard of\r\nglibness and who made political speeches which charmed and convinced\r\neven white audiences of a certain shallow and emotional type. Just as\r\nwomen have been found who can compare favorably with men in platform\r\nranting, so were negro politicians found who, gifted with fluency,\r\nfilled with vanity and stimulated by applause showed themselves equal or\r\nnearly equal to white demagogues in that fascinating art. And thus the\r\nchampions of universal suffrage were able in 1868 to point triumphantly\r\nto successful southern political campaigns conducted to a considerable\r\nextent by colored men who passed all the tests nowadays applied by a\r\nwhite democracy in a similar case; the leaders talked and orated\r\nfluently and the masses voted for them in droves as slavish and\r\nunquestioning as the best trained white voters. And so the black leaders\r\ngot into office and at once began the customary idle and dishonest\r\ncareer of the professional place hunter.\r\n\r\nThe result is told in one of the darkest chapters in American history.\r\nMany white friends and champions of the colored race went south to aid\r\nthem in their political life, but the case was hopeless from the start.\r\nThe negro level of intelligence and honesty was so low, and the business\r\nexperience of the voters so small, that even their very ablest\r\nrepresentatives would have been sadly deficient in the primary qualities\r\nnecessary for legislation and administration; but as is inevitable under\r\nthe system of universal suffrage, the worst were often chosen at the\r\npolls. The men elected to the state legislatures in the South under this\r\nrégime were often ignorant, drunken, debauched and dishonest. Many of\r\nthem were without means, had never paid taxes and were incapable of\r\nmeasuring the value of money, or of understanding financial dealings.\r\nAll the Southern States had suffered severely during the Civil War; most\r\nof them were so financially exhausted as to be deserving of real\r\nsympathy, but the new gang of black and white scallawags was pitiless.\r\nWaste, peculation, folly and every form of misgovernment followed;\r\npublic credit was destroyed, property values fell; there were ten\r\nwretched years of violence, scandals and shame, at the end of which\r\nnegro suffrage had disappeared, abandoned even by its strongest\r\nsupporters. As soon as it was gone a sound reaction began, public credit\r\nwas restored, values increased, public waste and robbery diminished,\r\npolitical scandals became fewer and less flagrant, and the South entered\r\nat once upon a career of comparative prosperity in which it has\r\ncontinued to this day. Such misgovernment as still continues in the\r\nSouth is mild compared with the experience of those ten dreadful years\r\nof negro domination.\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment refer to the recorded testimony concerning this\r\nremarkable episode in the history of manhood suffrage in this country.\r\nThe historian Lecky says:\r\n\r\n     “Then followed, under the protection of the Northern bayonets, a\r\n     grotesque parody of government, a hideous orgy of anarchy,\r\n     violence, unrestrained corruption, undisguised, ostentatious,\r\n     insulting robbery, such as the world had scarcely ever seen. The\r\n     State debts were profusely piled up. Legislation was openly put up\r\n     for sale. The “Bosses” were all in their glory, and they were\r\n     abundantly rewarded, while the crushed, ruined, plundered whites\r\n     combined in secret societies for their defense, and retaliated on\r\n     their oppressors by innumerable acts of savage vengeance.”\r\n     (_Democracy and Liberty_, Vol. I, p. 94.)\r\n\r\nSenator Tillman of South Carolina, who lived in the midst of it,\r\ndescribed the result as a “government of carpet-baggers and thieves and\r\nscalawags and scoundrels who had stolen everything in sight and\r\nmortgaged posterity; who had run their felonious paws into the pockets\r\nof posterity by issuing bonds.”\r\n\r\nFrom another writer:\r\n\r\n     “When installed in power the negroes and their white mentors\r\n     indulged in an unprecedented robbery of the public purse. They made\r\n     the legislatures issue bonds on the state to provide for public\r\n     works which were never taken in hand, and shared the proceeds among\r\n     themselves, leaving the taxpayers to submit to fresh taxation; they\r\n     openly passed fraudulent disbursements or swelled the expenses\r\n     incurred for furnishing offices, etc., in the wildest fashion,\r\n     fitting them up, for instance, with clocks at $480 apiece, with\r\n     chandeliers at $650. The official positions were distributed among\r\n     illiterates; in one state there were more than two hundred negro\r\n     magistrates unable to read or write; justice was openly bought and\r\n     sold.” (_Ostrogorski on Democracy_, p. 56.)\r\n\r\nA few of the details are as follows: In Mississippi the yearly\r\nexpenditures trebled; the state debt was greatly increased, the actual\r\nfigures have been disputed; the tax levy was multiplied by fourteen. In\r\n1866 the State Treasurer embezzled $61,962. The state librarian is\r\nbelieved to have stolen books from the state library. In South Carolina\r\nupon the inauguration of manhood suffrage, there followed, says the\r\nEncyclopedia Britannica, “an orgy of crime and corruption.” A bar and\r\nrestaurant was annexed to the legislative chambers, free to the members\r\nand their friends; in place of the plain furniture placed there by the\r\nSouth Carolina aristocracy, consisting of $5 clocks and $10 benches,\r\nthere were installed by the representatives of the working people of the\r\nstate sofas at $200 each on which the black and white legislators might\r\nloll and repose, and clocks at $600 each, for those capable of reading\r\ntime. In one session $95,000 and in four years $200,000 was appropriated\r\nfor State House furniture. When the orgy was over a few years later, the\r\nwhole lot was valued at less than $18,000. In eight years the printing\r\nring stole or squandered over $150,000 of state money. Enormous sums\r\nwere obtained by means of fraudulent pay certificates issued under\r\nlegislative authority. In the four years from 1868 to 1872 the state\r\ndebt increased from less than $7,000.000 to an unknown sum, of which\r\nover $18,000,000 was actual and evidenced by written obligations, to\r\nwhich might be added about $10,000,000 more, clearly fraudulent and\r\ncontingent on the continuance in power of the plunderers. It may be said\r\nthat all of this increase beyond the original $7,000,000 represented\r\nwaste and theft. A large part of this debt was afterwards repudiated. In\r\nFlorida $600,000 in taxes was collected and embezzled by the collectors\r\nand the treasury was swept absolutely bare. Legislative expenses were\r\nquadrupled, state taxes increased eight-fold; in the four years from\r\n1868 to 1872 the state debt mounted from $4,000,000 to $12,000,000. In\r\nTennessee the state debt rose from $16,000,000 to $42,000,000. In\r\nArkansas land taxes were increased ten-fold and state expenses\r\ntwelve-fold in eight years. Of over $7,000,000 expended by the state in\r\nsix years, the greater part was squandered; only $100,000 was spent for\r\npublic improvements. A bonded debt of $10,000,000 was fraudulently\r\ncreated and the money wasted on pretence of paying for buildings and\r\nrailroads which were never constructed. In Georgia the state debt was\r\nincreased from $6,000,000 to $18,000,000 in three years without any\r\nbenefit whatever. In Alabama members publicly boasted of receiving large\r\nsums for passing measures. The state debt increased from $8,000,000 to\r\n$25,000,000 in two years. The value of land fell from $50 an acre to\r\nbetween $3 and $15 an acre. In Louisiana two hundred new offices were\r\ncreated; the public debt in two years jumped from $7,000,000 to\r\n$41,000,000. In four years state and city government expenses increased\r\nto ten times their normal volume; taxation was enormously increased, and\r\nabout $54,000,000 of debt created with nothing to show for it. “In North\r\nCarolina,” says the _Encyclopedia Britannica_, “the government\r\nestablished in accordance with the views of Congress in 1868 was\r\ncorrupt, inefficient and tyrannical.” The state debt was increased in a\r\nfew years from $16,000,000 to $42,000,000 and the proceeds wasted. In\r\nTexas the extravagance of the reconstruction period caused a debt of\r\n$4,700,000. In all these states salaries and miscellaneous expenses\r\nwere enormously increased during this episode. Crime was unpunished,\r\npardons were bought and sold and bribery of public officials was\r\nnotorious. At the close of the manhood suffrage rule nine southern\r\nstates were unable to pay their debts, amounting in all to about\r\n$170,000,000 and had to repudiate them. This is not extraordinary when\r\nwe consider that these states had been stripped by the war of all\r\nproperty but land, and that in seven of them the increase of state debts\r\nranged from $35 to $94 per capita inhabitant. A New York state debt of\r\n$940,000,000 in 1918 would correspond in figures with what was saddled\r\non poor Louisiana in 1872; but in order to express its relative weight,\r\nconsidering the date and the value of money and the wealth of the state,\r\nit would have to be multiplied at least five times. Imagine a New York\r\nstate debt of $4,700,000,000. It seems an impossible misfortune, but\r\ngranted an illiterate population and we might reasonably expect such a\r\nresult in about ten years’ time, under a system of universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to establish manhood suffrage in the South by means of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment was a crime. The amendment itself is founded upon a\r\npalpably false conception. In effect it provides that the right of\r\ncolored citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or\r\nabridged by any state. It amounts to a solemn declaration that there are\r\nno inferior races and that a voter does not need intelligence. It\r\nproposes to establish a government to be called civilized where the\r\nignorant shall govern the intelligent; the inferior shall govern the\r\nsuperior; poverty shall rule wealth; the pyramid shall stand on its\r\napex. It turns the democratic movement into a backward march; assuming\r\nto speak for democracy, it declares it an enemy of civilization; it\r\nflouts the wisdom of science; it overrules the Creator, who created five\r\nraces of men fundamentally different in capacity. To attempt this was a\r\ncrime and not the less but the more so because done through a sham\r\nlegality. As already shown in these pages, a law passed in contravention\r\nof civilization, in opposition to the canons of Society is no law, and\r\ntherefore the old statutes authorizing the tortures of the Inquisition,\r\nthe execution of witches and the rendition by free peoples of fugitive\r\nslaves to their masters were illegal and void, and disobedience thereto\r\nwas a virtue. The Abolitionists were fond of denouncing the Constitution\r\nas a covenant with hell; the Fifteenth Amendment was a compact with\r\nrascality, entered into at the command of passion and party advantage\r\nrather than of cool reason and patriotism. It was possible because the\r\nlong régime of political corruption had demoralized the best of the\r\nparty leaders; they had grown accustomed to quackery and demagogism and\r\na corrupt use of the spoils of office to control elections and\r\ngovernment, and they found it easy to apply these means to the problem\r\nof the government of the conquered Southern States, with the object of\r\nparty gain. But they never would have dared to do the deed had the way\r\nnot been first prepared by the spread of the false doctrine that every\r\nman has a natural right to a vote. Thus once more we have the lesson of\r\nthe ultimate costliness of lying and false logic.\r\n\r\nNor has the evil passed away with the practical nullification of the\r\namendment. One of the most mischievous of all shams is a sham law. The\r\nFifteenth Amendment, which our manhood suffrage politicians are too\r\ncowardly to repeal, has still a place in the Constitution, a sham law, a\r\ndead carcass, breeding disease and pestilence. This is plain to the\r\nstudent of American politics, though millions of American voters are too\r\nignorant to recognize it and too irresponsible to care. For over\r\nforty-three years this amendment has been by eleven southern states\r\nopenly flouted and defied because its enforcement would mean negro\r\ndomination and a relapse into barbarism. The nullification of any\r\nexisting law, and above all of a constitutional provision, is\r\ndemoralizing to the nation; but in this case not only the fact of its\r\nnullification has been demoralizing, but the manner in which it was\r\ndone; by methods admittedly evil in themselves, by violence, electoral\r\ntrickery, theft of and tampering with ballot boxes, falsification and\r\nthe use of fraudulent, technical and tricky law and procedure. There\r\nwere probably 850,000 adult negro citizens in the southern states in\r\n1870, of whom all but about 50,000 were ultimately disfranchised by\r\nthese means, and by methods still in effectual operation. It is\r\ndifficult to say which has been more scandalous, the enactment of the\r\namendment by its friends, or the method of its nullification by its\r\nenemies. Nor is this the whole story of this shameful business. The net\r\nresult has been and is to deprive a dozen southern states, say\r\none-quarter of the Union, of all proper share and interest in Federal\r\npolitics. This comes about because while the Fifteenth Amendment stands\r\nthe South feels that there is danger of its enforcement by the\r\nRepublican party; a fear encouraged by the weak hypocrisy of the blatant\r\nnorthern Republican politicians who pretend to believe in manhood\r\nsuffrage and by the warnings of the blatant southern Democratic\r\npoliticians who also pretend to believe in its imminence. The southern\r\nwhites, therefore, have for over forty years voted, and still vote, _en\r\nmasse_, the Democratic ticket for Congress and the president\r\nirrespective of all questions of Federal statesmanship. It is a most\r\ndeplorable state of things, tending to corruption in one party, to\r\npartisanship in the other, and to confusion all around. Hence the “Solid\r\nSouth.” Be the question one of war or peace, high or low tariff,\r\ncolonial expansion, internal improvement, civil service betterment or\r\nany other important question, the vote of the “Solid South,” instead of\r\nexpressing the opinion of the southern people merely voices a negative\r\nto the Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe result is practical disfranchisement, north and south. The total\r\nvote in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina fell from 492,357 in\r\n1876 to 177,822 in 1900. Allowing for the increase in population, it\r\nshould have been about 690,000, evidencing an extinguishment of\r\nthree-fourths, by fraud, terror, or discouragement. In South Carolina\r\nthe Republican vote, mostly colored, fell from 91,780 in 1876, to 3,963\r\nin 1908. In 1910 the vote for congressmen in proportion to the\r\npopulation was in Massachusetts one to eight; in South Carolina one to\r\nfifty; in Mississippi one to seventy-five. A population equal to that\r\nwhich provided a hundred votes in Massachusetts, provided no more than\r\nsixteen in South Carolina and eleven in Mississippi. Allowing the\r\nnegroes as a rough estimate half the population, we find that\r\nthirty-four white men in one hundred refrained from voting in\r\nMississippi. These whites were not actually forbidden to vote, but they\r\nwere practically disfranchised by a system of solid Democratic\r\nrepresentation which made voting a useless ceremony. The menace of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment is such that only one party can exist in the\r\nSouthern States. In the present Congress every single member in both the\r\nSenate and the House from the States of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,\r\nGeorgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and\r\nTexas, is a Democrat and from Virginia there is but one Republican\r\nmember. And so it comes about that a constitutional measure pretended to\r\nbe enacted to enfranchise the blacks not only completely fails of that\r\nintent, but results in partly disfranchising the whites both north and\r\nsouth. The southern white voter is disfranchised because he is\r\npractically prevented from making a free choice between candidates; the\r\nnorthern white voter is practically disfranchised wherever a Republican\r\nmeasure which he favors is defeated without consideration of its merits\r\nby southern votes cast against him under this arbitrary pressure. There\r\nare about twenty million white people in eleven southern states who are\r\nthus misrepresented and held in political bondage owing to the enactment\r\nof the Fifteenth Amendment by manhood suffrage fanaticism and stupidity.\r\nAssuming that these people, if liberated from the fear of the brutal\r\nrégime of manhood suffrage with which they are threatened, would divide\r\nabout equally in politics like their northern fellow citizens, and we\r\nhave say ten millions of northern people, and about two millions of male\r\nnorthern voters who are practically disfranchised; their votes being\r\nnullified by the blind vote of these eleven southern states. The\r\nexistence of this condition of affairs is well recognized by lawyers\r\nand statesmen. Says one writer, “The indifference to political interests\r\nand responsibilities which such conditions produce is a serious menace\r\nto the progress of the south and to that of the country as well.”\r\n(Appleton’s _Cyclopedia_; American Government, Suffrage.)\r\n\r\nSuch in brief is the story of the results and reactions of the attempt\r\nmade a generation ago with great power and with all the seriousness of\r\nfanaticism, to put into actual effect in our Southern States the silly\r\ndoctrine of the political equality of all men. The lesson and the\r\nconclusion are alike plain and undeniable. No sensible white man is now\r\nheard to urge that the pauper southern negroes be once more invited to\r\ntake part in our political life. And yet, if there be truth in the\r\ntheory that every man is entitled to a vote, no matter how humble, then\r\nthe disfranchisement of the southern negro is a foul injustice, for\r\nwhich the whole American people are responsible, since they all\r\nacquiesce in it. But there is no truth in it. The mass of negroes are\r\nproperly excluded from voting in the South, because as a class they lack\r\nthe training, experience and temperament necessary to a proper exercise\r\nof the suffrage. All this seemed perfectly plain from the beginning; and\r\nyet it was only after a long and severe political agitation, accompanied\r\nby violence and bloodshed, that the South got rid of its rotten manhood\r\nsuffrage governments; and it will take time and much talk to bring the\r\nAmerican people to the point where they will feel compelled to apply to\r\nthe ignorant and shiftless whites the principle then so fully\r\nillustrated, tried out and verified, that the suffrage is a function of\r\ngovernment and cannot safely or justly be conferred on any class which\r\nis morally or mentally incompetent to perform it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n     THE EFFECT OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE IS TO ENSURE INEFFICIENCY IN\r\n     DOMESTIC LEGISLATION AND ADMINISTRATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is expressing oneself very mildly to say that manhood suffrage\r\nproduces inefficiency; rather one may say that inefficiency is of its\r\nvery essence. Preparedness is a major essential of the management of our\r\nsuccessful business enterprises, while unpreparedness is a\r\ncharacteristic feature of our government administration. To take a\r\nconcrete and conceded instance. The Spanish war of 1898 found us totally\r\nunprepared for war; without guns, powder, artillery, transports or\r\nofficers trained for high command. (Alger, _Spanish-American War_, p.\r\n455.) Our troops in that war were not properly equipped, rationed or\r\ncared for. The cause, says Stickney, was “the wholesale fraud and\r\ncorruption which then permeated the entire administrative force in\r\nWashington. That fraud and corruption still continue in full force.” In\r\nthe _New York Sun_ of February 7th, 1920, the leading editorial was on\r\nAmerican want of preparedness. The writer said, “We are a people who\r\nwill not practice preparedness. We did not prepare for war, we did not\r\nprepare for peace. We have never prepared for anything. But sooner or\r\nlater the man that will not prepare must be damned.” This\r\nwell-recognized want of foresight in national matters is not an American\r\nfailing; it is entirely due to the manhood suffrage habit of voting into\r\nresponsible positions men of intrigue and oratory instead of men of\r\nbusiness. Says Reemelin, “There is not a bank, a factory, a store or a\r\nfarm, which if managed on the basis of American government would not\r\nimpoverish its owner.” (_American Politics_, 1881, p. 324.)\r\n\r\nIn every department of human activity, including government, the chief\r\ndesideratum is efficiency. In the primary struggle for a bare existence,\r\nit is efficiency that wins. The first and principal enemy of man is\r\nNature; her wildness and inclemency must first be overcome, and food,\r\nshelter and clothing be forced from her bosom at the price of an endless\r\nand ceaseless vigilance. As human society grows older the efficiency\r\nwhich comes of systematic training becomes more essential to its\r\nmaintenance. People may doubt whether the world improves or whether\r\nhuman existence becomes more precious and enjoyable with the passing of\r\ntime, but no one can doubt that life is growing more complicated every\r\nyear. The increase of population, the achievements of invention, the\r\ngrowth of knowledge of our environment, and the cultivation of new\r\ntastes and desires have all tended and are tending with accumulated\r\nforce to make life more difficult for the uninstructed and to increase\r\nthe necessity for scientific thinking and acting in dealing with new\r\nproblems. As stated by Mr. Lowell the specialization of occupations is\r\nbrought about by complexity of civilization, growth of accurate\r\nknowledge, progress of invention and the keenness of competition. A few\r\nyears ago a private citizen could take up a new business without prior\r\npreparation; he can no longer safely do so. The use of experts is\r\nincreasing in business concerns and industrial enterprises. Universities\r\nare erecting new specialized departments. Sixty years ago there was\r\nscarcely a school of engineers in the country; to-day there are many of\r\nthem. The inexorable rule of the tendency of the fittest to survive is\r\nstill an active force in the world, and the recent struggle with Germany\r\ngave terrible warning that efficiency is more than ever the price of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nNext to the struggle with wild Nature comes the contest with human\r\ndisorder and the necessity for government, in order that men may best\r\nsecure and enjoy the spoils and fruits achieved from Nature; and again\r\nefficiency is the essential quality. We hear much these days about moral\r\nforce; but there is no force but material force; what is usually meant\r\nby moral force is the influence of moral ideas directing action, for\r\nwithout efficient action, moral ideas will be fruitless. They will not\r\nmake crops grow nor cause a machine to operate, nor check the deadly\r\nvelocity of a volley of musketry, nor save a sinking ship, nor check a\r\nconflagration; moral force will not win a battle, a campaign or a war,\r\nnor save a nation. Combe in his _Constitution of Man_, long ago pointed\r\nout that a pirate in a good sea-going ship was safer than a missionary\r\nin an unseaworthy one. Moral ideas may serve to give action a right\r\ndirection; but training and force are necessary to make it effective;\r\nwithout training in action and a proper supply of material force, the\r\nmoral ideas will never be manifested at all to our senses, and therefore\r\nefficiency in action is the final object of all practical teaching, and\r\nthe true test of good government. Governmental efficiency means good\r\norder; wise legislation; foresight in public affairs; the proper\r\nselection of work to be done; the doing it well and expeditiously;\r\nspeedy and impartial justice; good home administration generally and\r\nwisdom and firmness in foreign relations. It is difficult to see how a\r\ngovernment which is efficient can be bad, or one which is inefficient\r\ncan be good. In fact, efficiency makes more for human happiness than any\r\nother governmental quality. The ultimate object of the creation of the\r\nFederal Union was to secure increased efficiency in government. The old\r\nConfederation had been inefficient and was justly condemned and\r\nabolished; and the present Federal government was therefore established\r\nwith powers as stated in the Constitution to levy and carry on war, to\r\ncontrol and promote commerce, to establish and sustain postal facilities\r\nand a national coinage and to secure peace with foreign nations; all of\r\nwhich purposes might be included in the phrase “national efficiency.”\r\n\r\nIn an address delivered at Chicago, January 12th, 1918, by Otto H. Kahn,\r\na patriotic and far-sighted New York business man familiar with German\r\nmethods, he truly said:\r\n\r\n     “One of the main reasons for Germany’s remarkable development in\r\n     peace and amazing power of resistance in war, is the way she has\r\n     dealt with the complex and difficult problems of economic,\r\n     commercial and fiscal policy. She recognized, long since, that such\r\n     problems cannot be successfully handled haphazardly or in\r\n     town-meeting fashion, or emotionally; still less can they be made\r\n     the football of politics. The German way has been to turn such\r\n     matters over for study and report to those best qualified by\r\n     experience and training, and thus having obtained expert advice to\r\n     respect it and in its large outlines to follow it. And appointments\r\n     to office are made not on a basis of political affiliations or\r\n     personal friendship or social sympathies, but for experience and\r\n     tested fitness.”\r\n\r\nHe is right, and it is a well-recognized fact that German efficiency in\r\nthe late war enabled her to make head for over three years against the\r\nmost powerful combination of modern times.\r\n\r\nConsider the vast importance of the work of our own Congress and of our\r\nstate legislatures. Think of what is committed to the charge of these\r\nbodies; reflect for a moment on the importance of our state affairs; our\r\nharbors, canals, railroads, highways, schools, colleges, courts of\r\njustice, penal and charitable institutions, public utilities, all the\r\nmanifold commercial, political and criminal legislation of the State;\r\nand then glance at the immense fields of Congressional authority: the\r\npower of declaring war and making treaties; the maintenance and support\r\nof the army and navy; foreign affairs, tariffs; interstate railroads;\r\nthe post-office; the federal courts of justice. The human mind is\r\nappalled at the magnitude of the task of properly governing the enormous\r\npopulation and of safeguarding the immense wealth and interests of the\r\nUnited States. The future political existence of the country and its\r\nstatus as a nation may and very probably will depend on the capacity and\r\nability of its legislators and administrators. Yet but few voters\r\nrealize the necessity of business experience and of technical knowledge\r\nto members of the state or national legislatures. It is not\r\nsufficiently considered that by far the greater part of legislative work\r\nis made up of strictly business matters requiring special knowledge.\r\nTake for instance one item of Federal legislation, namely, that relating\r\nto the administration of 200,000 square miles of timbered land owned by\r\nthe United States government--an area equal to France--where the people\r\ndwelling or operating in the lower regions derive their water from\r\nwooded uplands: and also relating to another area of 100,000,000 acres\r\nor 150,000 square miles containing petroleum, coal and other minerals.\r\nIn these two tracts “The government will henceforth be selling standing\r\ntimber to lumbermen, water power for electrical transmission, water for\r\nirrigation rights, and oil, coal, and mineral privileges, on an\r\never-increasing scale of magnitude; while it will rent grazing lands\r\nequal in extent to the greater part of the country east of the\r\nMississippi River.” (_Shaw on Political Problems_, p. 114.)\r\n\r\nThis case is not exceptional in Congress as may be seen by the following\r\nlist, which includes all the important general Federal legislation for\r\nthe year 1917, which happens to be the latest at hand:\r\n\r\n     1. Increasing the membership of the Interstate Commerce Commission,\r\n     and increasing the powers of the Commission.\r\n\r\n     2. Excess Profits Tax on Corporations.\r\n\r\n     3. Civil Government for Porto Rico.\r\n\r\n     4. Literary Test for Alien Immigrants.\r\n\r\n     5. Military Measures, namely, Declaration of War against Germany;\r\n     Liberty Bond Issue; Ship and War Material Act; Draft Law; Food\r\n     Control; Espionage; War Risk Insurance.\r\n\r\n     6. Appropriation Bills.\r\n\r\nThese measures are all of general effect and all require expert\r\nknowledge. It appears from a mere reading of the list that they are such\r\nas to presume and require in the legislators a knowledge of finance;\r\ntaxation; shipping; food production; transportation; insurance; and\r\nother subjects.\r\n\r\nNew York state legislation for 1917 dealt with the following subjects,\r\nall or nearly all relating to business matters: Court officers and\r\njudicial procedure; decedents’ estates; domestic relations, including\r\nmarriage and illegitimacy laws; penal and criminal statutes; civil\r\nservice laws; state accounting and budget; state police; municipal\r\ngovernment regulations; sales act; warehouse receipt act; partnership;\r\ncold-storage; negotiable instruments; extradition; land registration;\r\nprobate of wills; highways and motor vehicles; dog licenses; railroad\r\ncrossing protection; commercial regulations relating to trading stamps;\r\npatent medicines; food products; blue sky law; insurance laws;\r\ncorporations; regulation of public utilities; conservation of resources;\r\ntaxation laws; the care of the insane; building regulations; banking;\r\neducation; public health; liquor dealing and labor laws. This list is\r\nnot at all exceptional and the public need of trained and informed men\r\nin government service is more apparent every day.\r\n\r\n     “There is now” (says Willoughby) “demanded on the part of our\r\n     lawmakers, not only patriotism and political sagacity of the\r\n     highest order, but scientific knowledge, and strict\r\n     disinterestedness far beyond that formerly required. Many of the\r\n     economic interests that are now discussed in our legislative halls\r\n     require, in the highest degree, scholarly research and judgment.”\r\n     (_Nature of the State_, p. 416.)\r\n\r\nNow, when manhood suffrage was established here as an institution; when,\r\nas the twaddlers like to say, the people took command, it became the\r\nprivilege and the duty of the ruling populace to establish and enforce\r\nproper standards of qualification for its representatives and agents.\r\nIts orators professed that they were going to show the world great\r\nresults of popular government. The wretched practical results we know.\r\nBut what efforts did they make? What have they in fact done in three\r\ngenerations towards securing efficiency in their elective officers?\r\nAbsolutely nothing. If any despot had ever shown such complete disregard\r\nof decency and propriety in his system of appointments as our manhood\r\nsuffrage democracy has, he would be held up to public reprobation. Not\r\nonly are and have been the state and national legislators and other\r\nelective officials commonplace or below commonplace in character and\r\nability, but no effort whatever has been made or is being made; no\r\nscheme has been even proposed, whereby to secure men of efficiency for\r\nthese important places in the gift of the people. The manhood suffrage\r\nelectorates are reckless, unscrupulous and hopelessly behind the age;\r\nthey never have recognized the growing need for efficiency. As Lowell\r\nsays, “We are training men for all services but that of the public.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, the scheme of manhood suffrage makes no provision for\r\nefficiency, nor any serious pretence thereof; it ignores it completely\r\nin the selection of its agents and otherwise. Whatever efficiency may be\r\nsecured in a democracy is obtained in some way other than by a manhood\r\nsuffrage vote. The only test applied by the populace at an election is\r\nthe oratorical test, and sometimes not even that. Its favorites at the\r\npolls are the talkers; by talk they become known; by talk they become\r\ncandidates; by speeches they gain elections and by speeches they\r\nmaintain their places. No one knows or cares whether they can do\r\nanything else but talk. No one ever heard of a candidate for an elective\r\npublic office being required to produce proof of his equipment for the\r\nplace. A candidate for alderman is not expected to have served an\r\napprenticeship in any city department; nor to pass an examination in\r\nharbor facilities, sanitation, school management, public lighting,\r\nsewage, water supply, transportation nor any of the departments of city\r\ngovernment. The candidate for mayor of New York is not required to know\r\nthe contents of the Charter of the city. Congress is supposed to be the\r\nreal governing body in this country, and would be such if it were not so\r\nscandalously incompetent and untrustworthy. But a man who can get by\r\nhook or crook on the machine ticket and can make what the rabble calls\r\n“a rattlin’ good speech” is qualified for a seat in Congress. Whoever\r\nheard of a candidate for Congress or a state legislature being required\r\nto know anything whatever about anything or to have ever done anything\r\nas a prerequisite to his candidacy? Such tests would be inconsistent\r\nwith the very theory of manhood suffrage as now entertained. That\r\nstandards will ultimately have to be applied even to elective offices if\r\ndemocracy is to prevail no far-seeing man can doubt. And there is\r\nnothing impracticable about the suggestion. Even now, in the states\r\nwhere judges are elective, custom requires that the candidate shall have\r\npreviously passed an examination for admission to the bar. There is no\r\nreason whatever why all candidates for elective offices should not be\r\nrequired to be reasonably qualified for the offices they seek; nor why\r\nthe electors themselves should not be such persons as are qualified to\r\nvote, and have proved their fitness for the ballot by the record of\r\ntheir lives in the community. But the essential quality of manhood\r\nsuffrage is that it rejects all tests for voters, and so beginning at\r\nthe very source of government its anti-efficient influence extends all\r\nalong the line, and tends to neutralize every effort to elevate the\r\nstandard of democratic administration. Its spirit is directly opposed to\r\nthe demand for efficiency in governmental affairs. Efficiency is\r\nexclusive, it applies tests, and rejects those who fail. Beginning with\r\nthe voter, manhood suffrage refuses to apply to him any tests whatever,\r\nand denies not only the policy of their application but the right to use\r\nthem. It views the elective franchise as the personal belonging of the\r\nindividual, even the most ignorant and degraded, to be used to justify\r\nhis whim, his pleasure, his spite, his prejudice. The newspapers,\r\nunconsciously perhaps, voice this spirit. We constantly read in the\r\npublic press urgent invitations to vote, addressed to the careless or\r\nindifferent in politics, those who presumably have no compelling\r\nopinions and are therefore quite unprepared and unfit to vote. Instead\r\nof being warned of the wrong and danger of frivolous and ignorant\r\nvoting, they are urged by the newspapers to go to the polls as if to\r\ntake part in an amateur baseball game: “Come, join in; even if you don’t\r\ndo it well; it’s the national game! There are prizes too, the spoils;\r\nand though you don’t compete yourself you may have the fun of seeing\r\nthem distributed, and root for the victors.” People are more careless in\r\nvoting for high officials than in hiring an office boy. They vote for\r\nmen whom they do not know even by sight; whose very names are\r\nunfamiliar; and are usually quite unashamed of trifling with the\r\nsuffrage in a manner deserving punishment. This is one result of our\r\ncheapening of the franchise.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will peruse the list of measures passed or considered by\r\nCongress or his state legislature for the current year, he will perhaps\r\nbe able to judge whether his representative in Washington or in the\r\nstate capital is competent to deal with such matters. Not one in a\r\nhundred is fit for the job. For most of the subjects of legislation the\r\naverage public representative has had no previous training whatever. And\r\nif after long service he happens to become proficient in any of them,\r\nthe chances are that he will be sent back to private life by the vote of\r\na manhood suffrage constituency under orders of the district boss. As a\r\nconsequence it is well known that the legislative output is and has been\r\nfor generations past very inferior indeed. The abuse of state\r\nlegislation is dealt with elsewhere in this volume; it is so notorious\r\nthat it needs no proof, and is so vast that its complete discussion is\r\nfar beyond the compass of this work. The reader experienced in politics\r\nis probably well aware that Ostrogorski is right, in his brief summary\r\n(p. 374): “The laws are made with singular incompetence and\r\ncarelessness. Their number is excessive, running into volumes each\r\nsession; but they are mostly laws of local or private interest. The\r\nmotives which enter into the making of these laws are often of an\r\nobviously mercenary nature.” (_Democracy._)\r\n\r\nBefore the German war the state legislative output in the United States\r\nwas about fifteen thousand enactments per year, of which about one-third\r\nwere public or general laws and the remaining two-thirds special and\r\nlocal statutes. This year it is probably greater. In a recent single\r\nsession of Congress upwards of twenty thousand bills and resolutions\r\nwere introduced, of which about five thousand were passed, including\r\nnearly two thousand public or general laws. Probably nine-tenths of this\r\nlegislation is unnecessary and a large part of it is undoubtedly\r\nvicious.\r\n\r\nThe just resentment of America’s business men is being constantly voiced\r\nat the manner in which business interests are being flouted by the\r\ndoctrinaires and demagogues to whom our political system entrusts the\r\nreins of government. The following extracts from the address of Otto H.\r\nKahn, before referred to, will serve to illustrate some phases of this\r\nattitude of business towards politics:\r\n\r\n     “A somewhat similar case is the railroad legislation which Congress\r\n     enacted under the Taft administration. That legislation represented\r\n     the tearing to shreds and the subsequent recasting, patching up and\r\n     ill-devised piecing together by Congress of a carefully thought\r\n     out, though, in my opinion, by no means faultless measure, which\r\n     had been introduced with the backing of the Administration. You all\r\n     know the result. The spirit of enterprise in railroading was\r\n     killed. Subjected to an obsolete and incongruous national policy,\r\n     hampered, confined, harassed by incessant, minute, narrow,\r\n     multifarious and sometimes contradictory regulations, that great\r\n     industry began to fall away. Initiative on the part of those in\r\n     charge became chilled, the free flow of investment of capital was\r\n     halted, creative activity was stopped, growth was stifled, credit\r\n     was crippled....”\r\n\r\n     “What we business men protest against is ignorance, shallow thought\r\n     or doctrinairism assuming the place belonging to expert opinion and\r\n     tested practical ability. We protest against sophomorism rampant,\r\n     strutting about in the cloak of superior knowledge, mischievously\r\n     and noisily, to the disturbance of quiet and orderly mental\r\n     processes and sane progress. We protest against sentimental,\r\n     unseasoned, intolerant and cocksure ‘advanced thinkers’ being given\r\n     leave to set the world by the ears and with their strident and\r\n     ceaseless voices to drown the views of those who are too busy doing\r\n     to indulge in much talking. And finally do we protest against\r\n     demagogism, envy and prejudice, camouflaging under the flag of war\r\n     necessity and social justice in order to wage a campaign through\r\n     inflammatory appeal, misstatement and specious reasoning to punish\r\n     success, despoil capital and harass business.”\r\n\r\nAnd further on:\r\n\r\n     “We deny the suggestion that patriotism, virtue and knowledge\r\n     reside primarily with those who have been unsuccessful, those who\r\n     have no practical experience of business, or, be it said with all\r\n     respect, with those who are politicians or office holders.”\r\n\r\nThis remonstrance of Mr. Kahn is but a sample which might be multiplied\r\nby the hundreds. It is typical of a constant stream of complaints which\r\nbusiness men in all parts of the country are continually uttering. The\r\nuniversal testimony of our merchants, manufacturers and financiers is\r\nthat neither at the federal or state capitols do they find men either\r\ncapable of understanding the rules and operations of business or willing\r\nto study them, or interested in the business prosperity of the people.\r\nIf the reader will but examine a list of members of any legislative body\r\nhe will understand the cause of this deplorable situation. Let him study\r\nthe names of the delegation at present representing in the state\r\nlegislature the immense interests of the City of New York, her commerce,\r\nmanufactures, wealth and population. She ought to be represented there\r\nby the class of honorable and successful active or retired merchants;\r\nfinanciers of high standing; manufacturers of note and ability and\r\nleaders in the professions; by publicists; scholars, and men of the\r\nfirst prominence in labor organizations; to be or to have been a member\r\nof a state legislature should be a badge of honor. On that list he will\r\nprobably find not one name known outside the ranks of petty ward\r\npoliticians; and men of the high character above described would feel it\r\nas a stigma to have it said that they had served in a legislative body.\r\n\r\nNext, as to the judiciary. It is the property of evil to spread, and it\r\nis one of the curses of the manhood suffrage system, that not content\r\nwith control of the legislature which is properly elective, it seizes\r\nupon and degrades the judicial and administrative branches of government\r\nwhich are both naturally appointive. Its effect upon the judicial bench\r\nhas been necessarily bad, frequently covering the ermine with the mire\r\nof politics. During the period from 1865 to 1873 so many of the judges\r\nsitting in New York City were notoriously unfit and corrupt, that their\r\ndoings furnished material for a great scandal. The state supreme court\r\njudges, elected by manhood suffrage, were the most conspicuous sinners,\r\nbut many of the inferior judges, including those appointed by a manhood\r\nsuffrage mayor, were equally unworthy. Bryce visited one of those\r\ncourts, probably about 1870, and this is what he saw:\r\n\r\n     “An ill-omened looking man, flashily dressed and rude in demeanor,\r\n     was sitting behind a table; two men in front were addressing him;\r\n     the rest of the room was given up to disorder. Had one not been\r\n     told that he was a judge of the highest court of the city, one\r\n     might have taken him for a criminal. His jurisdiction was unlimited\r\n     in amount, and though an appeal lay from him to the Court of\r\n     Appeals of the State, his power to issue injunctions put all the\r\n     property in the district at his mercy.”\r\n\r\nHe further declares that at that time there were on the bench in New\r\nYork City, bar room loafers, broken-down Tombs attorneys, needy\r\nadventurers, whose want of character made them absolutely dependent on\r\ntheir patrons. “They did not regard social censure, for they were\r\nalready excluded from decent society. Impeachment had no terrors for\r\nthem, since the state legislature, as well as the executive machinery of\r\nthe city, was in the hands of their masters. It would have been vain to\r\nexpect such people, without fear of God or man before their eyes, to\r\nresist the temptations which capitalists and powerful company could\r\noffer.” And further:\r\n\r\n     “A system of client robbery had sprung up, by which each judge\r\n     enriched the knot of disreputable lawyers who surrounded him; he\r\n     referred cases to them, granted them monstrous allowances in the\r\n     name of costs, gave them receiverships with a large percentage,\r\n     and so forth; they in turn either at the time sharing the booty\r\n     with him, or undertaking to do the same for him when he should have\r\n     descended to the Bar and they have climbed to the Bench. Nor is\r\n     there any doubt that criminals who had any claim on their party\r\n     often managed to elude punishment. The police, it was said, would\r\n     not arrest such an offender if they could help it; the District\r\n     Attorney would avoid prosecuting; the court officials, if public\r\n     opinion had forced the attorney to act, would try to pack the jury;\r\n     the judge, if the jury seemed honest, would do his best to procure\r\n     an acquittal; and if, in spite of police, attorney, officials, and\r\n     judge, the criminal was convicted and sentenced, he might still\r\n     hope that the influence of his party would procure a pardon from\r\n     the governor of the State, or enable him in some other way to slip\r\n     out of the grasp of justice. For governor, judge, attorney,\r\n     officials, and police were all of them party nominees; and if a man\r\n     cannot count on being helped by his party at a pinch, who will be\r\n     faithful to his party?” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, pp. 637,\r\n     639, 640.)\r\n\r\nAlthough this extremely degraded judiciary has passed away, yet the\r\nwhole story is as pertinent today as it ever was, for the vileness Bryce\r\ndescribes was the result of the operation of manhood suffrage in a large\r\ncity; and the same causes are still in existence. In practice in the\r\ngreat cities the higher state judges are usually selected by the\r\npolitical bosses; and the election is often a mere form, or at most a\r\ncontest between rival bosses in which the public takes but a languid and\r\nfutile interest. When the boss is a rich man as often happens in a great\r\ncity, he gets to know some able lawyers and sometimes makes fairly good\r\nselections for the higher judicial vacancies. This is far better than\r\nthe populace would be likely to do if left to themselves. Another means\r\nof protection for judicial honor has been the influence of an educated\r\nbar, endeavoring to enforce the traditions of the past, and the examples\r\nof other civilized countries to the effect that judges should be exempt\r\nfrom political influence and bias. But when all is said and done it is\r\nlargely a matter of luck even in the highest courts whether the judges\r\nare fit or otherwise. That the highest judges are still “bossed” is not\r\na mere vulgar notion. How can they escape? In the election for judges of\r\nthe highest New York courts in 1919, the charge that certain judicial\r\ncandidates were “bossed” was publicly and persistently made by ex-judges\r\nand leading lawyers.\r\n\r\nOf the California judges in 1877, Bryce says:\r\n\r\n     “The judges were not corrupt, but most of them, as was natural,\r\n     considering the scanty salaries assigned to them, were inferior\r\n     men, not fit to cope with the counsel who practised before them.\r\n     Partly owing to the weakness of juries, partly to the intricacies\r\n     of the law and the defects of the recently adopted code, criminal\r\n     justice was halting and uncertain, and malefactors often went\r\n     unpunished. It became a proverb that you might safely commit a\r\n     murder if you took the advice of the best lawyers.” (_American\r\n     Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 430.)\r\n\r\nThe most determined efforts of the lawyers of our great cities to make a\r\nmanhood suffrage constituency understand a judicial election have been\r\ncomplete failures. It is sometimes amusing to see the straits to which\r\nlawyers and their intelligent friends are driven to keep the judiciary\r\nfrom degradation. In New York, for instance, where the judges are\r\nelected for fourteen-year terms, the lawyers hit upon the plan of\r\ndemanding that sitting judges whose terms expire should always be\r\nrenominated by the bosses, on pain of active opposition to the entire\r\nticket, including their proposed successors. This really involved a\r\nviolation of the spirit of the constitution, for it aimed at a life\r\ntenure for judges instead of the fourteen years fixed by that\r\ninstrument, to which these lawyers had sworn allegiance. It further\r\ninvolved the absurdity of allowing the boss to select a judge, but never\r\nto drop him, no matter what his record; and it resulted that a candidate\r\nmight be opposed by the bar the first time, but if elected would\r\ncertainly be supported by them the next time without in either instance\r\nany real investigation of his record, character or attainments. All this\r\nabsurdity has been and is committed by intelligent lawyers in their\r\nefforts to avoid the risk of manhood suffrage popular elections of high\r\njudges. The reader can judge from this how lively the fear of popular\r\njudicial elections must be in the hearts of the lawyers of the city of\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nThere is of course something repulsive in the very thought of a judge of\r\na high court being selected in an election contest, and of his owing his\r\nplace to the suffrages of a low populace. And then, there is the\r\npractical objection to an elective judiciary, that a judge’s qualities\r\nare special and such as can only be ascertained upon personal\r\nacquaintance and by men of superior attainments. The office is properly\r\nan appointive one, but with manhood suffrage in play, some of the worst\r\nselections for the bench have been made by state governors, in order to\r\nreward followers or venal newspapers. There is really no remedy and no\r\nway of taking the judiciary out of politics while either the judge\r\nhimself or the appointing power is created by manhood suffrage. The\r\ntrail of the serpent is over everything that comes from that quarter. As\r\nfor the lower courts, the selections of their judges have been\r\nscandalous; men have been put on the bench who were ignorant of the\r\nfirst principles of law; drunkards, reckless politicians, ignorant,\r\ndishonest, uncouth, unmannerly specimens who have sought judicial office\r\nbecause they had no taste for hard work, or because their ignorance or\r\nhabits were such that they were unable to earn an honest living at the\r\nbar. Some of them are notoriously owned by politicians. Senator Breen\r\nsays that “After being whispered about among a coterie of closest\r\nfriends it becomes well-known that this particular politician owns a\r\ncertain judge and can get him to do anything.... The miserable creature\r\nwho is robed in judicial honors reposes in perfect ignorance of the\r\nignominy which his acts of dishonor are bringing on his name. This has\r\nbeen the fate of many a judge.” (_Thirty Years in New York Politics_, p.\r\n25.) A New York newspaper in the Tweed days said that there was no\r\nquarter of the civilized world where the name of a New York judge is not\r\na hissing and a byword. The New York bench has on the whole improved\r\nsince 1871 when this was written; but it is very far from being what it\r\nought to be, and its attainment of a high standard is impossible under\r\nmanhood suffrage.\r\n\r\nTaking the judicial system of the United States as a whole for the last\r\nthree quarters of a century it must be said that the administration of\r\njustice has been inefficient; a large percentage of the judges have been\r\nand are unfit for their places; clerks and sheriffs corrupt and\r\nincapable; there have been chronic and intolerable delays; juries almost\r\neverywhere carelessly selected, and usually incompetent and morally weak\r\nor dishonest; inferior magistrates corrupt and unfit; many of the trial\r\njudges weak and slow and referees and masters grasping and extortionate.\r\nCongress and the several states have adopted the stupid policy of\r\nunderpaying the bench, apparently on the theory that any lawyer is\r\ncapable of being a judge; and of employing as few judges as possible in\r\norder to save some of the money elsewhere so wickedly squandered. These\r\nfoolish economies to offset reckless waste are characteristic of the\r\nlower classes; they are given effect by universal suffrage, and\r\nharmonize with the whole inefficient outfit. The result is that in many\r\ncities important cases are on the trial calendars for months and even\r\nyears waiting to be heard because there are not judges enough to hear\r\nthem promptly; erroneous decisions of weak and ignorant judges keep the\r\nappellate courts busy ordering reversals and granting new trials; and a\r\ncontroversy that ought to be disposed of in a few months may drag along\r\nfor years and until some of the witnesses have disappeared or died and\r\nothers have forgotten all they once knew about the case. Mr. Bryce, in\r\nhis _American Commonwealth_, treats the subject of the judiciary with\r\ngreat circumspection, and with an evident desire to speak well of the\r\nAmerican bench, but is unable after “careful inquiries” to answer even\r\nin the matter of honesty for more than “nearly all the northern and most\r\nof the southern and western states.” He says that “In a few states,\r\nprobably six or seven in all, suspicions have at one time or another\r\nwithin the last twenty years attached to one or more of the Supreme\r\njudges,” and has “never heard of a state in which more than two or three\r\njudges were the objects of distrust at the same time.” It is worth while\r\nto stop to realize what this amounts to: from twelve to twenty dishonest\r\njudges of the highest state courts in the United States, actually\r\nsitting day after day, dealing out infamy under the name of justice;\r\ncriminals put on the bench by the election machinery; a judiciary in six\r\nor seven states so tainted that the foul smell reached the nostrils of a\r\nvisitor from other lands. This state of things makes one suspect a low\r\nstandard for the entire judiciary, or at least for that of each of those\r\nsix or seven suspected states, for it indicates the unscrupulous power\r\nof politics. In a state where even two or three judges sell or barter\r\njustice for politics, who will not suspect that others, promoted by the\r\nsame bosses, or by the same system, are incompetent, careless or\r\notherwise unfit?\r\n\r\nThe third class of public officers, being that which is generally styled\r\nadministrative, ought not, any more than the judiciary, to be affected\r\nby politics and should therefore never be chosen by popular election.\r\nThe function of the legislator is to enact new measures in accordance\r\nwith the progressive needs of the people, and he should therefore to a\r\ncertain extent consult their wishes in framing legislation. But the\r\nadministrative official is there to obey and to enforce the law as it\r\nexists; his duty is merely that of an honest, painstaking expert, and\r\nhis office should be appointive and should never be treated as\r\npolitical. This distinction between legislative and administrative\r\nofficials is plain and wide to the vision of any man with the least\r\nknowledge of government; and yet in preparing the constitutions and laws\r\nwith which they deign to provide us, it is frequently ignored by\r\npoliticians in pursuit of political power and patronage; the pretense\r\nbeing the furtherance of democratic institutions and the rule of the\r\npeople. And so in the great state of New York the attorney general, the\r\nstate engineer and surveyor, the secretary of state and the state\r\ntreasurer have been made and are elective officials; and since female\r\nsuffrage has been established in that state we have the edifying\r\nspectacle of those important offices being filled and their incumbents\r\nchosen, not by the governor of the state, nor by any body of experienced\r\nlawyers, engineers, business men or others somewhat acquainted with the\r\nworkings of the respective offices and candidates, but by four millions\r\nof miscellaneous people; including motormen, hod carriers, servant\r\nmaids, seamstresses, society ladies, firemen, boiler makers, farm\r\nlaborers, gamblers, loafers, etc., of whom ninety-nine out of a hundred\r\nhave no idea what an attorney general or a state engineer is, nor what\r\nare the duties of any of these officials, and would be unable the day\r\nafter election even to name the candidates for whom they voted for those\r\noffices. In fact the gross ineptitude of the institution of manhood\r\nsuffrage is nowhere more strikingly apparent than in the election of\r\nstate officers in the Empire State.\r\n\r\nNowhere in private life is the principle of popular election applied to\r\nthe choice of administrators or managers; such folly is confined to\r\npublic affairs. The merchant service and the army and navy are not\r\nconducted upon the principle of universal suffrage; neither the crew nor\r\nthe passengers, nor both united, are permitted to select the officers of\r\na ship; nor are the rank and file permitted to vote for their officers\r\nin any navy, or in any well-disciplined army. The sick man does not\r\nchoose his physician, nor the business man his lawyer or broker by\r\ntaking the votes of his neighbors or friends. In all these instances,\r\nand in every similar case of necessary care in making a choice of an\r\nagent, the prerequisite which is insisted upon as first indispensable\r\nand controlling is efficiency; and such efficiency can only be obtained\r\nby intelligent selection. Administrative officials should always be\r\npossessed of character, experience, intelligence and other qualities\r\nwhich go to produce efficiency. Such possessions can only be recognized\r\nby those who are personally acquainted with the candidates and are\r\ncompetent to pass upon these qualities. Their selection should\r\npreferably be made by those who are to supervise their conduct in\r\noffice, and to keep them up to the standard required. An appointing body\r\nis able to consider all the candidates who present themselves or whose\r\nfriends present them; the electorate can only consider two or three to\r\nany advantage. The appointing body can examine personally all the\r\ncandidates; the voters are incapable of properly examining any, and have\r\nneither the means nor the leisure for the careful scrutiny needed to\r\nestimate professional or expert qualifications. All administrative\r\nofficers should therefore be placed in office by appointment of their\r\nsuperiors or supervisors who are to be held responsible for their\r\nconduct in office, and never by popular election at the polls. Of\r\ncourse, the politicians may reply, though they are not likely to do so,\r\nthat the election of these state officers is a sham; that they are\r\nusually far from being the nondescripts whom the populace might choose\r\nif left unbossed; that they are really selected in secret long before\r\nelection, by a political autocracy, which taking advantage of the\r\nignorance and indifference of the mass of voters, sees to it that the\r\npowers and patronage of these offices go in the direction of selected\r\nfavorites of the machine, not destitute of ability. This is at least\r\npartly true, for the tendency of manhood suffrage is to turn the\r\nelections into mere formal ratifications of the will of the bosses. And\r\na machine appointment to an administrative office usually results much\r\nbetter for the public interest than a choice by manhood suffrage,\r\nespecially where there are spoils in sight and where rival organizations\r\nsharpen their claws, as for instance in a mayoralty contest in a large\r\ncity. Then ensues a real struggle, heightened by newspaper lies and\r\nclamor, with a tendency to give the victory to that one of the factions\r\nwhose managers are most artful, impudent and mendacious. In the\r\n_American Popular Science Review_, February, 1918, p. 121, Edgar Dawson,\r\nspeaking of the election of a city mayor, an office which under any\r\nrational system is treated as administrative, says:\r\n\r\n     “Does it require argument to prove to thoughtful people that wise\r\n     choice is not likely to be made in the midst of the revel of\r\n     hysteria, sham, demagogy, falsehood and ignorance, which we call a\r\n     direct popular election of administrative officers? Is choice\r\n     likely to be wise when nine out of ten of those who make it know\r\n     nothing of the candidates they support or oppose, and are equally\r\n     ignorant of the work the candidates ask the privilege of doing?”\r\n\r\nThus arises a question difficult to decide, between appointments by a\r\nmachine, and those of a machine-directed populace.\r\n\r\nThe immense importance of scientific management of cities is so obvious\r\nas not to need discussion. It is set forth in detail in a book published\r\nin 1918 by M. L. Cooke, Director of Public Works in Philadelphia, to\r\nwhich the reader is referred. The author states that “Governmental work,\r\nFederal, State and Municipal, is still almost exclusively in the\r\nunsystematized stage.”\r\n\r\nHere is an extract from a competent writer, a man of actual experience\r\nin city matters:\r\n\r\n     “_When the Public Builds Buildings._ Twenty-seven million dollars\r\n     for a City Hall that was to have cost $7,000,000; no water on the\r\n     second floor of a public bath because the water mains were made too\r\n     small; an emergency order, without competitive bids, for repairing\r\n     a police precinct, given to a contractor sixteen miles away;\r\n     $20,000 for cleaning a City Hall that could be kept clean for\r\n     $2,000; fifteen employees dead from tuberculosis in one\r\n     germ-infested, dark, unclean room. What’s the use of multiplying\r\n     examples?” (_Woman’s Part in Government_, by W. H. p. 330.)\r\n\r\nThe lack of efficiency in Federal administration which has been\r\nnotorious for ninety years is due to the malign influence of manhood\r\nsuffrage which renders it impossible to enforce standards of capacity.\r\nWhat Faguet calls “the religion of incompetency” is displayed even in\r\nthe presidential appointments where men are moved about from office to\r\noffice like checkers on a board, and put in places for which they have\r\nhad no previous training whatever. This method of appointment is in\r\nitself convincing proof, not merely of the unfitness of the\r\nappointments, but of the vice of the whole system of selection. A jack\r\nof all trades is master of none. What would be said of the fitness of a\r\nman to superintend a watch-making establishment who had never worked at\r\nthe trade or business of maker or of dealer in watches, and whose entire\r\nexperience had consisted of one or two years in each of the employments\r\nof carpenter, dentist, cook and piano tuner? Yet the practice of\r\npolitics sanctions just such appointments as that would be. Even for\r\ngreat offices requiring the highest skill, preparatory training or\r\nexperience is rarely required. Looking back from 1918; out of forty-four\r\nUnited States Secretaries of State from the beginning of our history,\r\nthirty-three were lawyers; only three or four had any previous\r\ndiplomatic experience; out of the sixteen last Secretaries of the\r\nTreasury, twelve were lawyers and only four bankers; out of the last\r\nthirteen Postmasters General, only one had ever before been in the Post\r\nOffice Department; of forty-nine Secretaries of War in our history\r\nthirty-five were lawyers; the others were editors, bankers, etc., and\r\nonly three or four had any previous military experience; out of\r\nthirty-eight Secretaries of the Navy twenty-seven were lawyers, three\r\nauthors, and seven were business men. Not one of them all had any naval\r\nexperience prior to taking control of the United States Navy. A former\r\nSecretary of the Navy gave the writer to understand that he had been\r\nappointed principally to distribute the patronage and to hold the state\r\npolitically in line. Now, while it is quite true that a knowledge of the\r\nlaw and a training in the art of reading and understanding law is\r\nextremely important to any cabinet official, yet surely a lawyer cannot\r\nbe expected to build ships, conduct a post-office business, direct the\r\ndiplomacy of a great nation or carry on war properly without any\r\nappropriate previous training whatever. Yet under a system of government\r\nby manhood or universal suffrage untrained men are sure to get these\r\nhigh appointments because they are vote-getters and can obtain the\r\nsupport of the controllable class for the party in power; in short\r\nbecause they are machine men and the needs of the machine are first and\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which some of these cabinet officers have been shifted\r\nabout is astonishing. Mr. Cortelyou for instance had been stenographer\r\nand private secretary to President McKinley; and in a few years\r\nthereafter filled the offices of Secretary of Commerce and Labor,\r\nPostmaster General and Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Meyer was\r\nPostmaster General under Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy under Taft,\r\nthe next President. Moody from the place of Secretary of the Navy under\r\nRoosevelt was suddenly jumped onto the bench and made Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court. Charles Bonaparte was Attorney General when he was\r\nshifted into the place of Secretary of the Navy. Now it is a sufficient\r\ntax on human credulity to ask one to believe that the original\r\nappointments of these men were made entirely because of fitness; but it\r\nexceeds the limit when we are required to suppose that while in the\r\noffice of Postmaster General Mr. Cortelyou was really learning finance\r\nand becoming fitted for Secretary of the Treasury, while Mr. Meyer in\r\nthe same Postmaster General’s office was becoming a great naval expert,\r\na real seadog justified to be “Ruler of Uncle Sam’s Navee.”\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that all state appointments by the governor are made not\r\nfor merit, but as a reward for political service, and invariably from\r\nthe members of the political oligarchy who procured the governor’s\r\nelection, or under their direction to members of their family or\r\nbackers. The results are often grotesque. Look for a moment at a batch\r\nof state appointments; take the very first that happens to come to hand\r\nfrom New York. State Tax Commissioner W. was formerly State Comptroller\r\nand before that Postmaster. Election Superintendent R., formerly\r\nAssistant District Attorney in New York City, was before that in the\r\nAttorney General’s office in Albany and Superintendent of State Prisons.\r\nR. 2 was recently Collector of the Port of Rochester; he now holds a\r\nstate office. Another couple:--V. has been successively Commissioner of\r\nExcise, Commissioner of Police, Commissioner of Docks, Police Justice,\r\nCommissioner of Elections; Superintendent of Public Buildings;\r\nSuperintendent of Elections. H. has held the offices of Deputy Collector\r\nof Internal Revenue; member of Board of Alderman; Grain Superintendent;\r\nSealer of Weights and Measures; Superintendent of Streets and Clerk of\r\nthe Court. The practice is the same in all states and cities, and these\r\nfive instances could be easily increased to five thousand and with time\r\nand research to five hundred thousand. In fact it is rare to find a man\r\nof over thirty-five years of age in public office who has not filled\r\nseveral entirely different political employments. It is said that one of\r\nthe members of the New York Constitutional Convention of 1846 proposed\r\nthat public officials should be selected by lot; and it is doubtful\r\nwhether in some cases the result would not be an improvement on the\r\npresent system. Is it any wonder that government administration is a\r\njoke, an object of scorn to business men? Efficiency cannot be expected\r\nin any department of government or business whose chief is ignorant of\r\nthe details of its operations. And yet so demoralizing has been the\r\neffect of the manhood suffrage political tradition, so accustomed are\r\nnot merely the politicians but the public to the vicious practice of\r\ndistributing these most important offices as rewards for political work,\r\nthat the proposal to require them to be filled by men of experience and\r\ntraining in the work of their respective offices would probably be met\r\nwith derisive laughter in every governmental department.\r\n\r\nLet us not flatter ourselves, therefore, that under a manhood suffrage\r\ngovernment any real improvement can be obtained by the mere expedient so\r\noften urged of filling the offices by appointment instead of by\r\nelection. Experience teaches the contrary. At present the appointments\r\nto office, whether made by the president, governor or other officer are\r\nof the same general character as those made by popular election; that\r\nis, they are nearly all bad; the spirit of Jackson still controls most\r\nof them; the spirit of politics, of deference to the will of the\r\nmachine, of compliance with the theory on which universal suffrage\r\nstands; the theory that participation in the activities, honors and\r\nemoluments of government is a sort of perquisite of citizenship or\r\nprivilege in which each citizen is entitled to share. This pernicious\r\ntheory must be forever cast out of our political system and replaced by\r\nthe true one; namely, that both the vote and office are to be entrusted\r\nonly to the qualified, before we can expect permanent improvement in the\r\nadministration of public affairs. In vain we may continue the long\r\nstruggle to abolish the spoils system as long as every candidate from\r\nthe president down to constable has to face the demands of the\r\ninsatiable regular army of the politicians. Not only every legislative\r\ncandidate, but every aspirant for a judicial or administrative office,\r\nhas now in one way or another to satisfy these disciplined gangs of\r\npolitical marauders, their bosses and their machines. These hireling\r\nbands must be disfranchised and disbanded and the institution of manhood\r\nsuffrage overthrown before efficiency will become an established feature\r\nof our governmental system.\r\n\r\nOf the fact that a pure and efficient administration of public affairs\r\nis possible there cannot be the slightest doubt. The result was actually\r\nachieved in this country in federal administration by President\r\nWashington, and continued in the forty years that intervened till\r\nJackson’s time. It has also been accomplished by ourselves in the\r\nPhilippines, by the French and Dutch in some of their colonies, and\r\nnotably by Great Britain in all parts of the world. Read for instance\r\nthe report from which the following is an extract, made by Alleyne\r\nIreland, a specialist in Colonial affairs, appointed Colonial\r\nCommissioner in the Far East, by the University of Chicago. (_North\r\nAmerican Review, May, 1918._)\r\n\r\n     “Administration as a non-political function of government is a\r\n     conception unfamiliar to the American mind; and I propose to\r\n     describe in outline how administrative problems appear to the eye\r\n     of a man who has spent twenty years in studying those forms of\r\n     government in which administration is conducted on a non-political\r\n     basis. I have observed in actual operation ten distinct forms of\r\n     government which conform to this condition. They are the Crown\r\n     Colony System in various British Colonies; the Central Government\r\n     of India; the Indian Provincial System in Burma; the system of\r\n     Protected Native States in the Malay Peninsula; the Government of a\r\n     Commercial Company in Borneo; the Rule of an Independent White Raja\r\n     in Sarawak; the early American Government in Mindanao; limited\r\n     Parliamentary Government in British Guiana and Barbados; the French\r\n     Colonial System in Indo-China; and the Dutch Colonial System in\r\n     Java. In the countries I have named there are administered the\r\n     public affairs of more than 300,000,000 people. Although these\r\n     governments have been constantly attacked on the ground of their\r\n     lack of a popular political element it is the general verdict of\r\n     those who have observed them in action that, leaving political\r\n     participation aside, they furnish this vast population with a\r\n     larger measure of the tangible fruits of good government than is\r\n     enjoyed by any people under the more ‘liberal’ constitutions of\r\n     Europe and America.... The influence exerted upon policy by the one\r\n     and by the other of these two modes of procedure differs\r\n     profoundly. In the United States the matter is decided, initially,\r\n     by some hundreds of men, and many having strong political motives\r\n     for taking a particular view; in India the matter is decided,\r\n     initially, by six men, each of whom is a trained and experienced\r\n     administrator, and none of whom has any electorate to please, any\r\n     powerful business interest to placate, or any political party to\r\n     support. In the former instance the veto rests with one man who may\r\n     have no more than an amateur’s acquaintance with the question\r\n     involved; in the latter the veto also rests with one man, but this\r\n     man is, in practice, guided by the advice of the India Council, a\r\n     body of from ten to fourteen men, sitting in London, composed as to\r\n     the majority, of ex-Indian officials of long service and varied\r\n     administrative experience.”\r\n\r\nWe are not lacking in material in America; we have the best in the\r\nworld; energetic, honest, upright, clear-headed, healthy, vigorous,\r\ndisinterested, patriotic, well-educated men; noble fellows, plenty of\r\nthem; eager for work; but they are not in politics and never will be\r\nthere under the present vile régime. It is just because they prize honor\r\nand reputation that they stay out of politics. Bryce truly says that\r\n“the American system does not succeed in bringing the best men to the\r\ntop. Yet in Democracy more perhaps than in other governments, seeing it\r\nis the most delicate and difficult of governments, it is essential that\r\nthe best men should come to the top.” What prevents our best men from\r\ncoming to the top? What prevents our having in this country the purity\r\nand efficiency witnessed by Mr. Ireland in ten different jurisdictions?\r\nPrincipally, our political spoils system, whose source and support are\r\nmanhood suffrage and the controllable vote. Secondarily, our failure to\r\nrecognize formally and actually the principle of efficiency as the prime\r\nessential in government. Such recognition will neither be genuine nor\r\neffective unless it begins with requiring an efficient electorate. After\r\nthat what remains to be done will be comparatively easy and natural.\r\nWithout it, the cause of substantial reform is practically hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nWEAKNESS AND INEFFICIENCY OF OUR MANHOOD SUFFRAGE GOVERNMENT IN ITS\r\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe qualities which render a government popular or successful at home do\r\nnot always work for efficiency in foreign relations. In home matters the\r\nnation discusses, divides, and experiments; in its foreign relations it\r\nmust act as one man and present to the other nations the same single\r\nattitude as would be offered by a dictatorship. Therefore it has been\r\noften said that a democracy is apt to be weak in its foreign policy,\r\nbecause it has to reconcile so many opinions before it can effectually\r\nact. But this weakness is not inherent in every conceivable democracy;\r\nit is possible for a democratic electorate if sufficiently intelligent\r\nto select one man or a small group of men to represent it in foreign\r\naffairs with firmness and ability. This, however, cannot be expected\r\nfrom an unintelligent constituency such as manhood suffrage provides,\r\nmuch less from an organization for spoils such as it has developed and\r\nplaced in power in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe manhood suffrage politicians who have had the popular ear for the\r\npast century have not understood the necessities or proprieties of our\r\nforeign relations, and have misinformed the people on the subject. They\r\nhave adopted the cheap newspaper attitude of sneering at skill, tact and\r\nsecrecy and applauding truculence and bluff in foreign diplomacy. They\r\nhave never realized the value of trained and cultivated statesmanship.\r\nIts importance is however transcendent. As long as the world continues\r\nto be composed of many different nations each including large\r\npopulations, differing more or less in race, religion, habits and\r\nprejudices from each of the others, there will be new and delicate\r\nsituations constantly arising, requiring the practice of tact,\r\nstatesmanship, diplomacy, and a historical as well as a present day\r\npractical knowledge of foreign countries. But under the system of\r\nuniversal suffrage the populace is king, the machine is his chief\r\nminister, the cheap daily press is his mouthpiece, and statesmen and\r\ndiplomats are not valued by either. The inferior newspapers want men in\r\noffice who depend not on merit but on advertisement; who rely for\r\npromotion on journalistic control of a public which gets all its\r\ninformation from the daily press. They prefer politicians who toady to\r\nthem to statesmen who despise their ignorance, their lies and their\r\nvulgarities. It is the custom of both politicians and newspapers to\r\nbelittle statesmanship, because the politicians have no knowledge of its\r\nhistory and capacities, and because real statesmen are indisposed to\r\ntolerate the pretensions and the interference of either newspapers or\r\npoliticians. All three, populace, press and political machine, would\r\nlike to see the general policy of the nation, including its foreign\r\naffairs, confided to such politicians as would seek guidance rather in\r\nthe opinions of the mob and the columns of the newspapers than in\r\nstudies of the history of foreign politics, of economics, of\r\ninstitutions and of the dynamic forces of the time.\r\n\r\nThere can be no successful diplomatic or even business negotiation\r\nwithout a decent amount of secrecy. The cheap newspapers dislike this\r\nprecaution. They pretend to see no need for secret diplomacy; they\r\ninsist that all negotiations between nations should be public. They are\r\nnot prone to understand pride or delicacy in any quarter, and would like\r\nto see made public the private transactions not only of nations but of\r\nindividuals, so that they might thus satisfy the cheap curiosity of\r\ntheir readers; for this reason they are opposed to the law of libel and\r\nto every protection to human privacy. They tell us in their flippant and\r\ncock-sure way that diplomacy and secrecy are not necessary parts of the\r\npolicy or of the procedure of a free nation; that all treaty\r\nnegotiations should be open; and they are fond of denouncing with a\r\ngreat show of moral indignation the secret diplomacy of the so-called\r\nautocracies of the world. But common sense teaches us that as long as\r\nnational pride continues, and treaties are to be made and war and peace\r\ndecided upon by governments, that is to say, as long as opposing and\r\nwarlike nations exist, secrecy will be necessary in the discussion of\r\ntreaties and in all important international negotiations; and that the\r\ngovernment which neglects to use the precaution and to give the guaranty\r\nof secrecy will be sometimes left in the lurch.\r\n\r\nWe hear a lot about a League of Nations in these days. The greatest and\r\nmost successful league of sovereign powers ever established was this\r\nUnion of States by and under a Constitution which was forged and created\r\nat Philadelphia in 1787 by some forty educated and propertied gentlemen\r\nworking in absolute secrecy. Neither the newspapers nor the populace was\r\nallowed to be present or to be represented at their deliberations, nor\r\nto know what was going on, nor to read or otherwise learn of their\r\ndebates or processes, therefore the delegates were able to work\r\nuntrammelled and to produce good results. Absolute secrecy in its\r\nconstruction made our American Constitution possible.\r\n\r\nBesides secrecy, great skill is required in the making of treaties and\r\nconstitutions. The nations whose rulers and diplomatic agents are chosen\r\nunder a system of universal suffrage, of government by demagogues and\r\nplatform ranters who are allowed and expected to distribute diplomatic\r\nposts among their supporters; such nations will suffer in competition\r\nwith those whose polity brings to the front and puts in command a set of\r\ntrained educated statesmen and diplomats. The two greatest triumphs of\r\nthe United States in its entire history were diplomatic achievements;\r\nand both were accomplished by statesmen trained under the old property\r\nqualification suffrage system, before manhood suffrage had cheapened our\r\ninstitutions. It was diplomacy, and secret diplomacy at that, which\r\nunder the astute management of Franklin obtained for the American\r\nStates the aid of France and made successful the American Revolution. It\r\nwas diplomacy, secret and highly skilled diplomacy, which procured in\r\n1803 the cession to the United States by France of Louisiana, from which\r\nterritory nine great states and the greater part of four others were\r\ncreated and which made the United States a real power in the world. The\r\nstory of that acquisition as described by Fiske is that of one of the\r\ngreatest diplomatic achievements in history; and, after making all\r\nallowances for good luck in the affair, we find there pictured a\r\nstatesmanship and a patriotism calculated to thrill the heart of every\r\nAmerican. The men who were most conspicuous on the American side from\r\nfirst to last in that transaction, were not of the class of politicians\r\nwho are to-day being chosen for high office by the popular vote; they\r\nwere Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Robert R. Livingston; all of them\r\nmen of position, property, good family, descent and education. All but\r\nWashington were college graduates. All were brought to the front by a\r\nsystem established upon the votes of a propertied electorate.\r\n\r\nAs government by the propertied class was successful in diplomacy in\r\nthose old days, so that of manhood suffrage has been a diplomatic\r\nfailure in our own time. The most recent and terrible instance of the\r\ndireful results of lack of governmental efficiency has been that of the\r\nepisode of the German War just concluded. Democracy was not only\r\nunprepared in 1914 for the struggle with Germany, but it completely\r\nfailed to foresee or even to suspect its approach. The crisis of 1914\r\nfound the four great democratic nations of the world deficient in\r\nmilitary organization, in preparation for defense, and in international\r\nvision and information. Granted the existence of a Germany, armed to the\r\nteeth, and sharpening her sword for mischief, Democracy should have had\r\nin charge of its foreign affairs men with vision sufficient to enable\r\nthem to foresee or at least to conjecture her designs. Of these designs\r\nher democratic neighbors had no conception, and the United States was as\r\nunsuspecting as a child. No effort had been made to study the\r\nsituation. Our rulers were mere vote-getters, local politicians, with a\r\nridiculously small knowledge of foreign affairs, and of the dreadful\r\nimpending future no vision whatever. We had then and we have now no\r\nadequate foreign affairs organization at Washington or abroad; and no\r\nsufficient popular conception of the need of one. It was part of the\r\nbusiness of an efficient national government in 1914 to understand\r\nthoroughly our foreign relations; and therefore to keep competent\r\nrepresentatives in all foreign countries; to measurably understand the\r\npolicy of Germany and every other first class power and its true\r\nsignificance; the extent of Germany’s military and naval preparations\r\nand their object, and the issues involved in the war; it was its\r\nbusiness to realize our true interests therein; to keep informed of\r\nevery phase of the struggle as it proceeded; to lead and advise the\r\npress and the representatives of the people on all these matters; to\r\ncause due preparation to be made for all eventualities, and to prescribe\r\na consistent and dignified policy for the nation. No one can possibly\r\ndeny that the Washington administration failed in all and every one of\r\nthese respects. It did none of these things; and let us haste to say\r\nthat it is not to be supposed that the opposite party could have done\r\nany better. In these important matters Washington could not help but\r\nfail, because our political system created by universal suffrage and\r\nguided by its paltry spirit makes no provision for statesmanship or\r\ndiplomacy; for forethought, sagacity and profound policy in foreign\r\naffairs; nor for preparation for great wars. Nor were the other great\r\ndemocracies, Great Britain, France, or Italy, much better off, as is\r\nshown by the miserable Russian fiasco, when they and ourselves, with an\r\nincredible fatuous folly permitted and even aided or encouraged the\r\nBolsheviki and their German assistants to destroy the Russian alliance,\r\nby deposing the friendly Czar who was maintaining a government which had\r\nfought nobly and effectively for the common cause, and which was the\r\nonly civilized government possible in Russia. It was then in the power\r\nof the Allies backing the Czar to have stamped out Bolshevism. They\r\nallowed him to be deposed by a gang of adventurers, while we stupidly\r\napplauded and raised the silly cry that Russia was now a democracy; a\r\nfree country forsooth. Misled by our ignorant and worthless Foreign\r\nOffice the masses who foolishly believe that freedom consists in merely\r\nvoting at elections were delighted; our politicians and newspapers\r\nreally or affectedly joined in this senseless joy; and the few among us\r\nwho understood what was really being done were unable to get a hearing.\r\nCivilization in Russia and the cause of the Allies was betrayed by the\r\nignorance of the politicians who controlled the Allied policies, and the\r\nresult has been the loss of tens of thousands of American lives and\r\nbillions of American dollars.\r\n\r\nA corresponding inefficiency was displayed elsewhere by the great allied\r\ndemocracies. From the moment of the first blare of the German war\r\ntrumpet in 1914 we saw them piteously struggling to free themselves from\r\nthe burden of the political ineptitude which this pernicious system of\r\nuniversal suffrage and vote-getting politics had fastened upon each of\r\nthem; striving to oust the democracy of ignorance and weakness, and to\r\ngive the aristocracy of merit the place it must have before the fierce\r\ncontest could be won. Some of the incompetents chosen for office by the\r\nmuch vaunted elective system were pushed to the rear out of sight; some\r\nwere otherwise got rid of or superseded; and some were slowly trained up\r\nto the efficiency they should have already possessed before being put in\r\nplaces of trust and power. In the meantime, there was over there failure\r\nand again failure; failure in Serbia; failure in Greece; failure in\r\nRumania; failure in Ireland; failure in Russia. And here in our own\r\ncountry as the war proceeded, want of foresight, want of preparation,\r\ninefficiency and waste; and though democracy conquered at last it was by\r\nsheer weight of numbers and resources, while its slowness to understand,\r\nto decide and to act brought us to the very verge of disaster and cost\r\nuntold lives and money, which efficiency would have saved.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of short memories, the writer presents here a few\r\nextracts from publications pointing out our criminal want of preparation\r\nfor defense at all times prior to 1918. For this situation, each\r\npolitical party blames the other; the fact being, that the fault is\r\nchargeable, not to any party, group or individual, but to our political\r\nsystem and cheap traditions.\r\n\r\n     “And we are unprepared. We have neither gates nor bars. We are\r\n     careless of the future, and the machinations of wicked men and the\r\n     ambitions of royalty. We sit in fancied security, trusting to the\r\n     potency of our riches and the divinations of our stargazers. We are\r\n     fat, otiose, spineless, insolent and rich. Could the devil himself\r\n     add anything to this catalogue to make us riper for plucking?”\r\n     (Henry D. Estabrook--“_Bewaredness_,” the American Academy of\r\n     Political and Social Science. _The Annals_, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\n     “The term, a ‘fool’s paradise,’ describes to perfection the\r\n     dreamland in which Americans have slumbered for years in their\r\n     complacent indifference to national defence.” (Huidenkoper’s\r\n     _Military Preparedness_, p. 252.)\r\n\r\n     “We never want to face another (war) in such ridiculous\r\n     helplessness as has crippled us in facing this one.” (_New York\r\n     Mail_, Ed. July 26th, 1917.)\r\n\r\n     “More than thirty months after the outbreak of the European War,\r\n     with all its terrible lessons, we have still to lay the statutory\r\n     foundations of a proper system of land-defense.” (H. L. Stimson,\r\n     _Scribners’_, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\n     “The United States of America is prepared for war neither\r\n     commercially nor physically.... We have neither a merchant fleet to\r\n     carry our commerce nor any army and navy to protect it.” (_Chicago\r\n     Evening Post_, Feb. 14, 1917.)\r\n\r\n     “The crisis finds us unprepared.” (_Chicago Tribune_, Feb. 15th,\r\n     1917.)\r\n\r\nA well-known authority on naval and military affairs, writing in the\r\n_Outlook_ of April 11th, 1917, says, p. 651:\r\n\r\n     “The greatest fault in democracy is the lack of imagination of its\r\n     administrators. Our press are held in the hollow of the hands of\r\n     political men whose knowledge of the art of war is only of the\r\n     primary school standard.”\r\n\r\n     “The European War has demonstrated to our people, among many other\r\n     things, that this country is as unprepared on land to defend\r\n     herself in case of an attack as was Belgium.” (Adj. Gen, Charles H.\r\n     Cole, of the Mass. National Guard, _Worcester Magazine_.)\r\n\r\n     “The close of 1915 found the United States Government involved in\r\n     most serious diplomatic differences with Germany and Austria....\r\n     The Navy, which in 1904 stood second in strength, is now third in\r\n     material strength and fourth or fifth in the strength of\r\n     personnel.... As showing the farcical weakness of our mobile land\r\n     forces, it is sufficient to say that we have in the continental\r\n     United States to-day only 30,000 effective militia, but, in the\r\n     event of a surprise invasion, it would take thirty days to\r\n     concentrate these 90,000 regulars and militia against the enemy.”\r\n     (_Scientific American_, Jan. 1st, 1916.)\r\n\r\n     “At a moment when by the sheer force of perfect preparedness\r\n     Germany is winning victories all along the line against the greater\r\n     part of Europe allied against her, we permit our army to sink close\r\n     to the point of inefficiency.” (_New York American_, Oct. 31,\r\n     1914.)\r\n\r\n     “America is wasteful, chiefly through lack of efficient\r\n     organization. We are now spending, under recent military\r\n     legislation, enormous sums for a totally obsolete kind of regular\r\n     army.... We have voted to build a large navy, and are taxing the\r\n     people to pay immense bills, but have not enough collective\r\n     efficiency to spend the money and get prompt results.” (_Review of\r\n     Reviews_, Feb., 1917.)\r\n\r\n     “Secretary Garrison has shown us that the entire army of the United\r\n     States available for movement to a point of danger is less than\r\n     three times the number of New York’s policemen.” (_Review of\r\n     Reviews_, Feb., 1916.)\r\n\r\nHere is the case of England, another democracy, presented in an extract\r\nfrom an article in the _North American Review_ for July, 1918, by A.\r\nMaurice Low:\r\n\r\n     “When England entered the war against Germany it was not exactly\r\n     with a light heart, but it was only with a faint conception of the\r\n     magnitude of the task she faced and the strain it would impose upon\r\n     her. Instead of immediately adopting conscription, she dallied\r\n     with it, talked about it, made it a political question, and then\r\n     accepted a compromise, which is the usual English fashion, and only\r\n     when much valuable time had been lost and the emergency was so\r\n     great that further delay was impossible, universal service was\r\n     enforced. It was the same with many other things. The blockade of\r\n     Germany was lax because of the timidity of the Foreign Office.\r\n     Business as usual was our boast, and we went about our several ways\r\n     spending money foolishly and refusing to be put on rations or\r\n     voluntarily reducing our consumption of luxuries.... Time, of\r\n     course, taught us wisdom. We bought our experience and a pretty\r\n     price it cost us.”\r\n\r\nNot only were the American people unprepared for physical action of any\r\nkind at the outbreak of the war of 1914, but the Congress then sitting\r\nin Washington was mentally unprepared and unequipped for dealing with\r\nthat or any similar situation. It needed first rate men; and manhood\r\nsuffrage furnished and is still furnishing the Capitol with a supply of\r\nthird and fourth raters. It is not merely that they were wrong on the\r\nEuropean situation; the fact is that they were nowhere; that a large\r\nproportion of them had no opinions whatever on the questions involved in\r\nthe conflict, and were incapable of forming any; they were absolutely\r\nignorant of European politics; were unable to read a French newspaper or\r\nto understand the political discussions of an English one; a few or none\r\nof them had ever made an adequate preparation for a congressional\r\ncareer; they were mere vote-getters, representatives of the political\r\nmachines of their respective districts; they waited for the newspapers\r\nto tell them what was the popular thing and for the bosses to inform\r\nthem as to the strength of the German vote. At every step in the\r\nnation’s progress from August 1914 to the declaration of the state of\r\nwar in February 1917 the country and the President showed plainly that\r\nthey did not trust Congress; and Congress showed plainly that it did not\r\ndeserve to be trusted in such an emergency. Neither the manhood suffrage\r\nCongress nor the manhood suffrage administration nor its political\r\nopponents in Congress took the lead at any time during this fateful\r\nperiod in forming, enlightening, instructing or fixing public opinion;\r\nthey lacked courage and statesmanship to do it, and the nation finally\r\ngot into the war by the process of drifting stern foremost. Once in, and\r\nblood drawn, real work began with the officers of the army and navy\r\nacting and compelling action; and after all when it comes to waving the\r\nbanner and making appropriations our congressmen are seldom derelict.\r\n\r\nThe popular belief in the inefficiency of the Federal government, and\r\nthe mischievous operation of the rabble vote, are manifested by the\r\nunwarranted meddling of individuals and groups of individuals with the\r\nadministration of our foreign affairs. Any one looking into the _New\r\nYork Times_ on a certain day in July in the year of grace 1919 might\r\nhave there read of the activities of the “National Association for the\r\nProtection of American Rights in Mexico,” whose principal offices are in\r\nNew York City and which seems to be a regularly organized and possibly\r\nincorporated body with directors and other officers. The intentions of\r\nthe members of this association may be innocent enough, yet the fact is\r\nundeniable that the United States is and ought to be the true and only\r\n“National Association for the Protection of American Rights” not only in\r\nMexico but everywhere; and it is difficult to imagine just what this\r\nSociety can perform in pursuance of its avowed purpose without undue\r\ninterference with the sovereignty and proper functions of the United\r\nStates Government, and without endangering the peace of the two\r\ncountries mainly affected. And although the whole community ought to\r\nhave been shocked at an organized movement founded on a contempt for the\r\nFederal government and a belief in its incompetence or worse, it seemed\r\nto excite no comment, and there was probably little notice taken of this\r\nparticular half column of the newspaper except by those directly\r\ninterested in Mexican affairs. In the same and other newspapers of the\r\nsame week were items of news concerning an agitation openly being\r\ncarried on in New York, Boston, and other large American cities to\r\nforcibly overthrow the government of Great Britain, as it actually\r\nexists in Ireland, and to establish in its place not merely another\r\ngovernment, but another form of government. At the very time this\r\nscandalous agitation was being promoted by solicitations, subscriptions\r\nand collections of money, and the usual acessories of dinners,\r\nreceptions and bunkum speeches by politicians, the United States was\r\njust finishing a great war in practical alliance with Great Britain; the\r\nmoral ties which bound the two nations were of the strongest; each owed\r\nits very existence at that moment to the other; and the two had just\r\nsigned a compact binding them to unite in defense of France. The\r\nproposals of the agitators, if they meant anything practicable, were\r\ntherefore in every way improper and seditious; they included a breach of\r\nfaith toward Great Britain, a betrayal of France and a disregard of the\r\nbest interests of the United States. It is true that few take these\r\nagitators seriously or believe that they will attempt a revolution in\r\nIreland or that if they should they could possibly succeed; it is\r\ndoubtful if all the world combined would be able to wrest Ireland from\r\nEngland by force; it is true also that the majority of the American\r\npeople probably believe that the so called Irish grievances have no\r\nsubstantial existence, and really mean no more that the exclusion from\r\npower of a set of political adventurers. But the agitators count on the\r\nwell-known weaknesses of the British and American governments, both\r\nchosen by universal suffrage, and the equally well-known fact that a\r\nminority if sufficiently well-organized and impudent can bully and\r\nhumbug its way along far enough to be certain to get money and place for\r\nits chiefs and always with a chance of some substantial concessions to\r\nits desires. Already the money is coming in, and the leaders are living\r\nin luxury, at the expense not merely of their dupes but of the friendly\r\nrelations of the United States with Great Britain and Canada and of its\r\nreputation for good faith in its foreign relations.\r\n\r\nThe nation is in constant danger of being pushed into serious\r\ndifficulties by the interested meddling with its foreign affairs of\r\npolitical adventurers and fanatics who would never think of daring to\r\nthus insult and interfere with a government founded upon an electorate\r\ncomposed of the propertied and intelligent classes, nor to bully a\r\nCongress representing them. For it is reasonable to suppose that the\r\nimmediate effect of excluding the irresponsible voters from the\r\ncongressional elections would be to smash the machines, and to clear the\r\nway for such an improved representation in Congress, as would certainly\r\nbe demanded by a constituency of men of substance and education. To sit\r\nin Congress might become once more a distinction worthy of the ambition\r\nof proud, honorable and able men; the standard of its membership would\r\nbe sensibly elevated; the administration backed or criticised as the\r\ncase might be by a really able and high-minded Congress would at once be\r\nstimulated and encouraged to energetic action on the highest attainable\r\nlevel, and America would present as she ought a firm and thoroughly\r\nintelligent attitude towards the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n     ROTATION IN OFFICE; A MISCHIEVOUS BY-PRODUCT OF THE MANHOOD\r\n     SUFFRAGE DOCTRINE AND ANOTHER FACTOR IN POPULAR MISGOVERNMENT; AND\r\n     HEREIN OF CIRCUMLOCUTION OFFICE REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the incidents of manhood suffrage is the practice of rotation in\r\noffice, which may be called a by-product of manhood suffrage and\r\nrepresents a doctrine which is only applicable to machine politics. It\r\nis sometimes supposed to mean that a public office is a desirable job at\r\nwhich every man should have his turn; but this arrangement is\r\nimpossible, since there are not nearly offices enough for that purpose\r\neven with replacements once a year, which is the limit of frequency thus\r\nfar proposed for office shifts; and although the politicians are\r\nassiduous in making new laws and creating new officials to enforce these\r\nlaws; who are to be found registering, recording, inspecting and\r\nreporting in every possible direction; though they discourage diligence\r\nin office and encourage short hours and idleness in office holders, so\r\nas to still leave a show of employment for others; yet with all they can\r\ndo, there will still be one hundred candidates for each place, and\r\nninety-nine of them disappointed. In practice therefore the bestowal of\r\ngood offices under the rotation system is necessarily limited; its\r\nbenefits are usually confined to the machine politicians and to a\r\ncertain number of favored candidates for machine favor; and the vision\r\nof a future turn at the public provender is for most party followers\r\naltogether illusory.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of rotation in office has acquired a certain favor in\r\npolitical circles, because it serves as an excuse for replacing\r\ncompetent and experienced officials by new and incompetent ones, for\r\nenforcing the “spoils” system, and aids in keeping in hand the\r\ncontrollable vote.\r\n\r\nIt is born of the same civic immorality as the manhood suffrage\r\ndoctrine, and is an incident or offshoot of the vicious theory that the\r\nvote is a natural right or privilege of the citizen. The manhood\r\nsuffrage claim is that the vote is for the benefit of the voter; the\r\nrotation doctrine is that the office exists for the advantage of the\r\noffice holder. The two claims are related. On the one hand if the vote\r\nbe regarded as a function to be exercised only by the capable, then it\r\nis easy and natural to insist upon proper qualifications for public\r\noffice holders and for permanency in office for the qualified; on the\r\nother hand, if the citizen, as such, has an absolute right to vote, why\r\nnot to hold office? The analogy between a voter and an office holder is\r\nnot perfect, but it has often been found in practice sufficient to\r\nsatisfy the popular mind, unaccustomed to disinterested reflections. You\r\nmay say that the fact that a man is allowed to vote is no reason why he\r\nshould be permitted to hold office, and business men or men of property\r\nwill agree with you, for they are not easily tempted to seek public\r\nemployment. Not so, however, your voter who has neither property nor\r\nsettled income, nor business capacity sufficient to acquire either. His\r\neducation often early tends towards office seeking; he is strongly\r\nadvised by the newspapers and by twaddlers generally, to take part in\r\nthe primaries, to become active in politics; and if he does so, he soon\r\nlearns just how the thing is done. Why may not he then have a turn at\r\nthe trough as well as another? The politicians encourage this attitude.\r\nThey are of course strongly in favor of rotation in office as a system\r\nwhich is in every way capable of use to the advantage of machine\r\npolitics. It accomplishes two things for them; it creates office\r\nvacancies, and it dispenses with merit in filling them, leaving them\r\nabsolutely at the disposition of the machine to reward party services.\r\nThe politicians therefore are able and willing to persuade the\r\nuneducated voters of the virtue of office rotation. Nor could they well\r\nopenly condemn it. You cannot admit the shiftless and ignorant into the\r\nelectorate, and then systematically spurn the ideas and claims which are\r\nnatural and appropriate to them as a class. One of these ideas is, that\r\none who has held any office a couple of years has had a fair share, and\r\nought to be satisfied to give way to someone else; and that if he\r\ninsists on coming up for re-election no matter how competent he may be,\r\nhe should be “knifed” as they say. And so we have in this country to a\r\nmischievous extent the doctrine and system of rotation in office as one\r\nof the troublesome and vicious incidents and results of manhood\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the dealings of the political managers with\r\nthis rotation doctrine, which as already stated is impossible of\r\npractical enforcement except in a very limited way. They have no idea of\r\npermitting this or any other theory to operate to their personal\r\ndisadvantage. The leaders must in any case be constantly fed at the\r\npublic crib; they must in any event be well provided for or the whole\r\nsystem would collapse. In order therefore to keep up the illusion of\r\nrotation for all, and a show of fairness, the managers are constantly\r\nshifted about from one office to another. In this way there is in fact a\r\ncontinuing series of changes among the office holders; and as a rule no\r\nsooner does an incumbent become familiar with his duties than he is\r\ndisplaced; but if he be a faithful party man he is at once put on the\r\nlist for something else. In fact, all of the class of regular\r\npoliticians are practically in office for life; the only effect of our\r\nfrequent elections being that they are constantly shifted from one\r\noffice to another. If any one will take the trouble to compare the list\r\nof office-holders from year to year, he will see that most of the names\r\nappear in successive administrations; but that they are moved from place\r\nto place with the change in the political fortunes of the different\r\nparties. When a candidate is defeated at an election, he is usually, if\r\na good politician, soon afterwards appointed to another office; if\r\nnecessary, a new office is created for him. If defeated at a city\r\nelection, he may be appointed to a federal office; if his party loses\r\nthe federal election, he soon turns up in a state or city office, and so\r\non; and so we have in the career of a politician a sort of ambulatory\r\noffice incumbency. He may be in turn tax collector, district attorney,\r\nsecretary or commissioner of this or that, judge or justice, state\r\nsenator, county clerk, foreign consul and so on. If high up in the\r\nparty, he will appear in the president’s cabinet, or as a foreign\r\nminister or as member of some high salaried commission. Being a\r\npolitician he is supposed to be eligible for anything and everything,\r\nand when at last he dies endowed with honors and with usually a fair\r\namount of cash after a life which has certainly been spent in the\r\nservice of his country, his newspaper obituary will point out to an\r\nedified world how men of humble origin prosper in this free land.\r\n\r\nThis system has the effect of strengthening party discipline; under it\r\nevery office holder is much more obligated to the party boss than to the\r\npublic. True, he apparently owes his election to the people; but usually\r\nonly apparently; since most of the votes he receives are strictly party\r\nvotes, representing merely the will and the direction of the boss and\r\nthe machine. But to the latter the candidate’s obligation is clear,\r\ndirect and personal; to them he owes his nomination, or at least the\r\nsuggestion of his name to the primaries which makes his election\r\npossible; and if defeated at the polls, his future is still in their\r\nfriendly hands. The party leaders and managers being thus cared for, and\r\ntheir faithful service forever secured by the distribution among them of\r\nall the best public employments, guaranteed by the rotation system\r\ndeveloped into a “steady job insurance” scheme, there remain the\r\ninferior county, city, town and village offices for apportionment among\r\nthe smaller fry, and to these minor places a real rotation system is\r\napplied to a greater or less extent. It is often understood that a\r\nsheriff, alderman, tax collector, police magistrate, town solicitor or\r\nattorney, county clerk, town or village official, etc., must be\r\nsatisfied with one or two terms and then give place to some other more\r\nhungry politician. This is the rotation system in practice.\r\n\r\nThe demoralizing results of such a custom are easy to be seen among us\r\nand still more easily imagined. Many public office holders in view of\r\nthe probable brevity of their tenure, try to hold on at the same time to\r\nboth private business and public office, with the natural result that\r\nboth are neglected. Elections are expensive. An official owing last\r\nelection’s bills finds the next one approaching with marvellous\r\nrapidity. From rigid enforcement of laws enemies might result, from whom\r\nnext year’s candidate need expect neither money nor support, but rather\r\nopposition; and after all, one year in office is a paltry reward for a\r\nfaithful party man after many years of fruitless canvassing. And so\r\ncomes lax administration, blinking of the eyes and scandal more or less\r\nsmothered. And in this and other ways the character of the office holder\r\nis impaired. The lure of this kind of politics is as demoralizing as\r\nthat of gambling. Thousands of individuals who uncorrupted by political\r\nlife might have remained honest and industrious citizens, are spoiled\r\nfor real steady work by their experience of easy living at the public\r\ncost, and become half knavish and altogether poor business men, and\r\nsometimes even debauched and intemperate. And if the office holder does\r\nhis very best it usually happens that just when he has learned his\r\nduties and begins to perform them well, his term approaches its finish\r\nand a greedy greenhorn takes his place.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows this and that it is all wrong. No one would think of\r\nproposing such a vicious system for any private business; everyone is\r\naware that employés become more valuable with experience and training,\r\nand that the success of a business establishment depends largely upon\r\nkeeping its old force in service year after year. Indeed, if justice\r\nrequires rotation in the well-salaried offices, the system should be\r\ngreatly extended, for after all, these political offices are not the\r\nreal prize employments; they are found in the high places in banks,\r\nbanking houses and great industrial and mercantile establishments. But\r\nno one suggests than in a democracy there should be rotation of private\r\nemployment, that a bank cashier has had enough after two years of\r\n$20,000 a year and that a mill superintendent should retire after three\r\nyears at $6,000 and be both replaced, one by a patriotic bank porter and\r\nthe other by a radical travelling salesman. The service of the people is\r\nthe only one that professional patriots insist upon breaking down by\r\nfrequent changes in the working force; by constant disorganization.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this hard treatment of the public service seems to be\r\nthat it sounds democratic and alluring to say that public office is a\r\nprize open to all. It is remarkable how willing people are to be gulled\r\nby catch phrases and sayings, like this of “rotation in office,”\r\n“government by the people,” and the like. The first Napoleon caught a\r\nlot of gudgeons by the saying that every private soldier carried a\r\nmarshal’s baton in his knapsack. American youths are gravely told that\r\neach of them has a chance to become president of the United States;\r\nanother humbug, since about only one man out of every million can\r\npossibly reach that office, no matter what the merits or deeds of the\r\nothers may be. Suppose some one opens Carnegie Hall, New York, free to\r\nall comers to hear Caruso sing at a certain day and hour; no one could\r\nsay that he was excluded by the terms of the invitation; and yet the\r\nmanager would know perfectly well that only three thousand could\r\npossibly be admitted, and that all who came after the first three\r\nthousand would better have stayed at home. It would sound to the\r\nthoughtless like a more generous and democratic act than the\r\ndistribution of three thousand free tickets, and yet it would in reality\r\nbe less so; it would indeed have somewhat the effect of a fraud on all\r\nexcept the first three thousand. Now something like this invitation is\r\nwhat is offered the American people when they are each invited, as they\r\nconstantly are invited, by the politicians in their universal suffrage\r\nconstitutions to come in and take a part as public officials in the\r\ngovernment of the nation. It is in every way impossible for all of us,\r\nor for more than a very few of us to do so; and all they really can and\r\ndo offer us is just what we would have under a restricted suffrage,\r\nnamely leave to fight or wheedle our own way to public employment or to\r\npolitical influence in the face of all who are determined to forestall\r\nus, the number whereof is by these very constitutions made as numerous\r\nas possible. And the so-called democratic invention of rotation in\r\noffice is just another worthless and fraudulent gift, of leave to each\r\nof us, to struggle for a paltry office in competition with every\r\npolitical adventurer in the community; when by the very terms of the\r\ngift, the office itself is stripped of all honor and dignity, and has\r\nattached to it the certainty that the winner is almost certain to be\r\ndeprived of the employment as soon as he shall have learned to fill it\r\nwith ability and credit to himself. Truly Barnum was right when he\r\nundertook to build his fortune on the theory that most people love to be\r\nhumbugged.\r\n\r\nSuch are the ideals and practical workings of the democratic principle\r\nof rotation in office, first put in practice by President Jackson and\r\nhis party managers, animated by the inspiring slogan “to the victors\r\nbelong the spoils.” It is difficult to imagine any system more\r\ncalculated than this to establish and encourage inefficiency in public\r\nand private life. And though in consequence of the endless changes of\r\nofficials in the public service, the state and community are always\r\npoorly served, the inferior party workers seldom get a turn at the good\r\nplaces; they are just fooled by the higher politicians who, while\r\npretending frequently to surrender the offices, merely exchange them\r\namong themselves. Thus the masses are made to suffer all the evils of\r\npoor and dishonest public service, without even the small compensation\r\nof a fair turn at the spoils.\r\n\r\nVigorous efforts have been made in the past thirty years to obviate some\r\nof the mischiefs of the spoils system; especially by the application of\r\nthe system of civil service examinations to nominations to public\r\noffice. Under this system which is only applied to certain classified\r\noffices, the appointment is supposed to be given to the candidate who\r\npasses best in an examination prepared beforehand by a civil service\r\nboard and open to all applicants. There is neither space nor fitness\r\nhere for an extended discussion of the merits and weaknesses of this\r\nCivil Service Reform plan as it is called. Its one pretended merit is\r\nthat it takes the appointments “out of politics” as they say, that is\r\nout of the control of the political heads of the departments. No more\r\ncrushing condemnation of our political system could be imagined than is\r\ncontained in these federal and state statutes which deprive our high\r\nofficials of the power and privilege of the selection of many of their\r\nown subordinates, the most important function of the head of a\r\ndepartment. That these chiefs should be furnished with advice and\r\nassistance in making appointments where numerous, would be reasonable\r\nenough; but that it should be found necessary as by this so-called\r\nremedial system is actually done, to deprive them of all choice, direct\r\nor indirect, in the selection of their subordinates indicates a shocking\r\ncondition of things. It means just this that the men whom manhood\r\nsuffrage puts in command are declared by statute to be unfit to be\r\ntrusted.\r\n\r\nThe defects of the Civil Service Reform plan are obvious, and have been\r\nrepeatedly pointed out. There are two principal ones; defects in\r\nmaterial and weakness in organization. All experience shows that mere\r\nability to answer questions is but slim proof of actual fitness for most\r\nemployments. The minds of the successful candidates are apt to be\r\nstorehouses of memory rather than factories of living ideas. The\r\ntendency of the examination system must be to emasculate the public\r\nservice, to furnish it with half-hearted hirelings, destitute of\r\ninitiative; routinists, who secure in their places and deprived of\r\nincentive to new achievement, gradually become mere wooden cogs in a\r\nlifeless machine. The head of such a force cannot be expected to\r\naccomplish much with men not chosen by him nor subject to his censure or\r\nremoval. Such a civil service will be weak in time of prosperity, and\r\nmay become intolerable in time of trouble and danger; an institution\r\nsimilar to the bureaucracies of continental Europe or to Charles\r\nDickens’ “Circumlocution Office.” The late Andrew Carnegie, the great\r\niron master, ascribed his success entirely to his tuck and wisdom in\r\nchoosing his deputies. A political department is really a business\r\norganization, and to be efficient, it should have a competent head\r\nsupported by a force of vigorous men of his own selection; chosen not by\r\nbook examinations, but for practical capacity, all constantly guided and\r\ncontrolled by him, and inspired with the feeling of mutual\r\nresponsibility for results. The vice of the Civil Service Reform system\r\nis that it entirely lacks the vigor and efficiency thus to be obtained.\r\n\r\nNo better proof of the hopeless desperation of the American political\r\nreformers can be offered than their willingness even to consider the\r\nestablishment of this bureaucratic system among us. Bryce approves it\r\nwith the approval of despair:\r\n\r\n     “Rather, they would say, interdict office holders from\r\n     participation in politics; appoint them by competition, however\r\n     absurd competition may sometimes appear, choose them by lot, like\r\n     the Athenians and Florentines; only do not let offices be tenable\r\n     at the pleasure of party chiefs and lie in the uncontrolled\r\n     patronage of persons who can use them to strengthen their own\r\n     political position.” (_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, p. 609.)\r\n\r\nThe present writer has been unable to think of anything worse to say of\r\nour present system of political appointments than this statement that it\r\nis worse than appointments by lot. Let it go at that.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only country where men are dazzled by a vision of\r\nrotation in office. The golden dream of public place as an idle refuge,\r\nto be occupied in turn by lucky politicians, with opportunity for\r\nrespectable theft, is much indulged in in Cuba and the Central and South\r\nAmerican republics, and assists in the promotion of revolutions in those\r\ncountries. They feel there, that a bright and active man in a good\r\noffice, ought to be able in from three to five years to steal his share,\r\nand should then be willing to retire in favor of someone else. For\r\nsimilar reasons, a political party should go out every few years and\r\ngive the others a chance. This doctrine is accepted even by independent\r\nonlookers of those countries, who often sympathize with the hungry outs\r\nin their natural desire to get their turn at the public chest. And this\r\nis why, when President Menocal’s first Cuban term of four years expired,\r\nthe opposition felt so outraged that he and his party should not be\r\nwilling to rotate out of office, that a revolution would probably have\r\nsupervened had it not been for the Platt Amendment. The faults of\r\nforeigners are very conspicuous in our eyes, and therefore the reader\r\nwill surely agree that these foreign gangs of political adventurers,\r\nwhose only thought of their country is to drain her blood, are a scurvy\r\nand contemptible lot, whose greed and lack of patriotism are abominable.\r\nAs for our own professional office seekers, now planning for their next\r\nturn it is safest to say nothing; they may be our masters in a few days\r\nor months, and prudence is a profitable virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n     THE EFFECT OF THE OPERATION OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE HAS BEEN TO GIVE A\r\n     LOWER TONE TO AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a quality in an individual, an association of individuals, a\r\ncommunity or a public institution, which though difficult to describe in\r\nexact terms is everywhere well recognized as something valuable and\r\nimportant, and is often referred to as “tone” or “style” or\r\n“distinction.” A youth who goes to college, travels, and then enters on\r\na business career acquires in ten years a different “tone” from his\r\nhomekeeping brother. It is not merely dress, or manners, or education;\r\nit is separate from all these; it produces an effort comparable to that\r\nof the toning up of a musical instrument, and applies to the man’s acts,\r\ngestures, and thoughts; giving him a different and mayhap higher place\r\nin the world and in the regard of his fellows. So we find clubs,\r\nassociations, communities whose tone is higher or lower than others, and\r\nare therefore esteemed or contemned accordingly. The tone of an\r\ninstitution sensibly affects its character; we feel its influence and\r\nare affected by it. No one for instance, can visit the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States or West Point Academy without immediately appreciating\r\nthe superior tone or atmosphere of the institution. And so the\r\ngovernment of a nation, its public life, has a tone, an atmosphere which\r\nall the world recognizes as higher or lower in quality than that found\r\nelsewhere. The tone of the administrations of the early presidents from\r\nGeorge Washington to John Quincy Adams, covering a period of forty\r\nyears, was high; all the world recognized the fact; Americans were proud\r\nof it; it was something of a value not to be measured by dollars, nor\r\nby power or cleverness; it was a fine emanation of the lofty ambitions\r\nand high traditions of our governing class; it meant that our country\r\nwas ruled and represented by gentlemen. We all somehow realize that that\r\ntone and atmosphere have vanished; they are mere memories, like the old\r\nstage coaches, knee breeches and hoopskirts of our ancestors; and now we\r\nhave a low tone in almost every department of public life; in some of\r\nthem it is even mean and vulgar. It is not necessary to offer proof of\r\nthis statement, the fact is practically involved in much that has been\r\nalready presented to the reader in this volume; it is something which\r\neveryone can confirm who has had much contact with public officials, or\r\nwho is familiar with the daily current reports concerning their\r\ncharacter and methods. The knavery that has been systematically\r\nperpetrated here, under the name of politics for the last three\r\ngenerations, could not possibly have gone on, without a distinct\r\ndegradation of the moral and social tone of our political life. Lord\r\nBryce though a liberal in politics has discovered that the attempt of\r\nthe multitude to govern involves the danger of “A certain commonness of\r\nmind and tone, a want of dignity and elevation in and about the conduct\r\nof public affairs, and insensibility to the nobler aspects and final\r\nresponsibilities of national life” and that such a tendency is more or\r\nless observable in the United States; and he adds, “The tone of public\r\nlife is lower than one expects to find it in so great a nation.... In no\r\ncountry is the ideal side of public life, what one may venture to call\r\nthe heroic element in a public career, so ignored by the mass and\r\nrepudiated by the leaders. This affects not only the elevation but the\r\nindependence and courage of public men; and the country suffers from the\r\nwant of what we call distinction in its conspicuous force.” (Bryce,\r\n_American Commonwealth_, Vol. II, pp. 583-585.) The language of this\r\ncriticism is mild, in accordance with the style of the book, which is\r\nthat of studied friendliness and compliment to the American people and\r\ngovernment; but the plain truth is there, though the accents are\r\ngentle. Lord Bryce was disappointed to find a people whom he elsewhere\r\ndescribes in this same book as generous, high-minded and patriotic, in\r\nthe political control of a lot of low politicians. The learned author,\r\nin common with some American writers, professes to be at a loss to\r\naccount for this sad state of things; there has been a remarkable\r\nshutting of eyes to the sins of manhood suffrage. But it is impossible\r\nto deny that the low public tone which we have all observed and all\r\nregret came in with that institution.\r\n\r\nThis is from another eminent writer:\r\n\r\n     “There is a risk of vulgarizing the whole tone, method and conduct\r\n     of public business. We see how completely this has been done in\r\n     North America,--a country far more fitted, at least in the Northern\r\n     States, for the democratic experiment than any old country can be.\r\n     Nor must we imagine that this vulgarity of tone is a mere external\r\n     expression, not affecting the substance of what is thought or\r\n     interfering with the policy of the nation; no defect really eats\r\n     away so soon the political ability of a nation. A vulgar tone of\r\n     discussion disgusts cultivated minds with the subject of politics:\r\n     they will not apply themselves to master a topic which besides its\r\n     natural difficulties, is encumbered with disgusting phrases, low\r\n     arguments, and the undisguised language of coarse selfishness.”\r\n     (Bagehot, _Parliamentary Reform_, p. 316.)\r\n\r\nTreitschke on this subject utters a despairing note.\r\n\r\n     “The strongest lungs always prevail with the mob, and there is now\r\n     no hope of eliminating that peculiar touch of brutality and that\r\n     coarsening and vulgarizing element which has entered into public\r\n     life. These consequences are unavoidable, and undoubtedly react\r\n     upon the whole moral outlook of the people; just as the unchecked\r\n     railing and lying of the platform corrupts the tone of daily\r\n     intercourse. Beyond this comes the further danger that the really\r\n     educated classes withdraw more and more from a political struggle\r\n     which adopts such methods.” (_Politics_, Vol. II, p. 198.)\r\n\r\nA low tone is the sign and indication of low ideals, which dwelling with\r\nand in a man or institution influence his or its thought, act and self\r\nmanifestation. The ideals of cheap and common men, and of those who\r\nlive by catering to them, are alike cheap and common. There is a\r\npolitics which consists of a study of principles applied to government;\r\nin that pursuit the ideals are necessarily lofty; it was their presence\r\nwhich gave the tone to the administrations of the first six presidents.\r\nThere is a politics which consists in a systematic pursuit of jobs and\r\nplaces; it is that which has mainly characterized the administrations\r\nfrom Jackson downwards. The resultant loss to the nation is additional\r\nto that caused by the waste, inefficiency, mismanagement and political\r\ndespotism already described; and though this lowering of tone is of\r\ncourse implied in the decline of political morals heretofore discussed,\r\nit yet constitutes a separate and additional public misfortune. We can\r\nimagine a moral descent without a corresponding falling off in outward\r\nbehavior, as in the French Court of Louis XV; but in our country, the\r\ntwo declines have been contemporaneous.\r\n\r\nMuch will have to be done before this can be corrected, but one remedy\r\nis absolutely essential, and that is the elevation and perfection of the\r\nelectorate. The degradation of the tone and destruction of the old-time\r\ndignity of American political life which we all so much deplore is the\r\nwork of manhood suffrage, immediately followed it, belongs to it and is\r\ninseparable from it. If we would restore tone and dignity to our\r\npolitics we must begin with the electorate; we must create a body of\r\nunpurchasable voters; men who have shown that they are free from the\r\nordinary temptations of corrupt politics by earning a good living in\r\nother ways which they have preferred to politics; men pecuniarily\r\nindependent, who have a stake in the country; something, nay much to\r\nlose, and nothing to gain by misgovernment; men, therefore, whose ideals\r\nin government matters are purity and efficiency. By that class of\r\nprosperous middle class men, high ideals may be and always have been\r\nadopted; they are of the proper combination of energy, capacity and\r\nindependence. It is impossible for most men to cultivate lofty ideals\r\nwhen they are hourly struggling for a mere subsistence; one cannot\r\nthink philosophically when he is in actual need, nor when in danger of\r\nbeing in need. No part of the burden of government should be put upon\r\nsuch shoulders as those of the needy class, the residuum, the derelicts,\r\nthe pecuniarily unfortunates or incapables of our civilization. We can\r\nonly elevate our political tone to the level of the time of Washington\r\nand John Quincy Adams by elevating our electorate to the plane which it\r\noccupied when it selected them and others of their type to represent it\r\nin the high places of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n     GENERAL PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CONDEMNATION BY THE INTELLIGENT CLASSES\r\n     OF MANHOOD SUFFRAGE POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES;\r\n     AND HEREIN OF WATCH DOGS AND YELLOW DOGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good test of the character of a man or an institution is public\r\nreputation; let us apply that test in this case. Manhood suffrage, its\r\nmethods, its politics, and its officialdom are generally not merely\r\ndistrusted, but scorned, held in utter contempt and openly repudiated by\r\nthe most intelligent classes of Americans. With the exception of a few\r\namong them who consider it their bounden duty to do civic missionary\r\nwork, those classes take no active part in politics; many of them do not\r\neven vote, others only vote for president, entirely disregarding state\r\nand local elections; most of them totally neglect the primaries; many of\r\nthem do not even know the names of their representatives in Congress. As\r\nfor the obscure politicians who sit in the city and state legislatures\r\nthey are absolutely beneath the social or political vision of most of\r\nour well-to-do and well-educated people. No really worldly wise American\r\nfather recommends his son to enter public life; its snares and dangers\r\nand the lack of esteem in which public officials are held are too well\r\nknown. Of course to many ambitious and inexperienced young men there is\r\nmuch temptation in a political career. The prospect of addressing\r\npolitical meetings, of being called “Senator” or “Judge,” of receiving\r\nmail addressed “Hon.,” of dealing with public measures, and of figuring\r\nin the newspapers, is alluring to many a young college graduate; while\r\npoor young lawyers are often tempted to struggle for public office by\r\nthe salary attached thereto. They find later that the reward of\r\npolitics is Dead Sea fruit that turns to ashes on the lips; even the\r\nsuccessful ones are usually disappointed; the pay is small; it is part\r\nof the manhood suffrage meanness to court the applause of the low-waged\r\nrabble or the no-wage loafers by keeping down official salaries; the\r\nincidental expenses are many and annoying, including small loans to\r\nhangers on and other petty exactions; to get money out of politics it is\r\nnecessary to be crafty and more or less dishonest. The young adventurer\r\nis disappointed in his aspirations for glory; the newspaper notices are\r\nfew and frequently uncomplimentary; he finds that the platform at public\r\nmeetings is usually reserved either for a notoriety of some sort or a\r\nblatherskite; and instead of enjoying public respect he encounters a\r\npushing familiarity, which is most offensive even when it comes\r\ndisguised as flattery from obsequious job hunters. Probably no business\r\nor profession has been in such disrepute, or has offered so much that is\r\nmean, sordid and repulsive to a noble nature, as has politics since\r\nmanhood suffrage was ordained in this country.\r\n\r\nUnder the property qualification régime young politicians had the\r\ninspiration of great and highly respected leaders, and the incentive of\r\na prospect of ultimately filling their places. Among such leaders in New\r\nYork in the first quarter of the nineteenth century were Alexander\r\nHamilton; John Jay; James Kent; De Witt Clinton; John Lansing; Rufus\r\nKing; Gouverneur Morris; Robert R. Livingston; Brockholst Livingston;\r\nWilliam W. Van Ness; Daniel D. Tompkins; Nicholas Fish; Erastus Root;\r\nJohn C. Spencer and William L. Marcy; fifteen distinguished names; a\r\nnumber proportionately according to population equivalent to one hundred\r\nand fifty at the present time. Each of them was eminent in something;\r\nmost of them in several things; and all are still illustrious in the\r\nannals of the state. Some of their political acts are open to criticism,\r\nbut they were all men of superior mentality, for the old system put the\r\nbest brains we had into politics, while the present system inevitably\r\nputs into public place the cheapest and poorest, so that we are now, as\r\nBagehot says, “deprived of the tangible benefits we derive from the\r\napplication to politics of thoroughly cultivated minds.”\r\n\r\nThe present public attitude towards officialdom not only indicates a\r\nsteady consciousness of its inferiority, but a disbelief in its honesty\r\nand a plain distrust of its intentions. By many persons, officialdom and\r\nthe people are supposed to be engaged in chronic warfare, and office\r\nholders as soon as chosen are assumed to be potential rascals; so that\r\nit becomes the presumptive duty of every patriotic organization and of\r\nevery public-spirited citizen to watch their every movement and to sound\r\nthe alarm at each of their expected attacks on the rights of the people.\r\nEternal vigilance is popularly urged as the only means of security\r\nagainst the misconduct or calamitous blundering of the office-holding\r\npoliticians. Nor is this attitude confined to the upper classes.\r\nPoliticians are fond of pretending affection for the working people and\r\nthat the manhood suffrage was a gift especially to that class. But none\r\nmore than the wage earners mistrust politicians; they are the first to\r\nsuspect official misconduct, and the most outspoken in its denunciation.\r\nListen to their comments when a public question comes up in which they\r\nare concerned. They are not then heard to say that their interests are\r\nsafe in the hands of the good officials chosen by the people; they are\r\nmore apt to complain of improper influence, “frame-ups,” bribery\r\nactually suspected or expected, “playing politics” and the like. Many of\r\nthem in despair of democracy have become socialists, and find in the\r\nrascality and inefficiency of the manhood suffrage government of the day\r\nample material for argument. The remainder unable to see any possibility\r\nof a remedy usually assume an attitude of resignation, evincing a desire\r\nto profit by whatever little pickings may be had from the political\r\nfeasts of the more fortunate. The attitude of the intelligent middle\r\nclasses is more frankly hostile and aggressive than that of the wage\r\nearners; it does not, unfortunately, take the shape of a demand for a\r\nhigher basis for suffrage, but of a persistent opposition to the\r\ncharacteristic operations of manhood suffrage government, such as\r\nappropriation of the spoils, and to its various political expedients to\r\nplease the rabble or bamboozle the public. It is practically assumed by\r\nthe middle class citizen, that officialdom is inimical to the public\r\nwelfare; and, especially in the great cities, there is a steady and\r\noutspoken demand for a remedy for the present notorious misgovernment;\r\nthat something be done to protect Society against its enemies, the\r\npoliticians in and out of office.\r\n\r\nThis feeling of American distrust of our own public servants is\r\nfrequently apparent in legislation enacted as a result of agitation\r\nfollowing one of the numerous revelations of official misconduct. Thus,\r\nin some cities the police power has been taken entirely out of the hands\r\nof the local authorities and lodged in the government of the state. One\r\nreform city charter of St. Louis provided that the mayor elected for\r\nfour years could not remove any official till his own third year in\r\noffice. These and many similar statutes are in effect formal assertions\r\nof the complete breakdown of manhood suffrage; that the elected\r\nmunicipal officials cannot be trusted either to police the city or to\r\nremove or appoint subordinate officers. The mayor under such a system\r\nhas to manage the best he can with deputies over whom he has little or\r\nno control. It seems as if political imbecility could go no farther than\r\nto create a system under which the mayor of the city is certain to be\r\nuntrustworthy and must therefore be deprived of power to control his\r\nsubordinates. And yet no doubt these provisions were but the recognition\r\nof the desperate situation of a manhood suffrage municipality. In one of\r\nthe instances just referred to the object of the city charter seems to\r\nhave been to vary the misery; two years chaos and two years ring-rule,\r\nturnabout.\r\n\r\nThis feeling of despondent suspicion is constantly being voiced by the\r\nmiddle-class newspapers and by groups of prominent citizens, by\r\ncommittees of fifty, of one hundred, etc., in circular appeals\r\ndistributed by the ten thousand to all men of any standing in the\r\ncommunity, urging them to “fight” as it is called, day and night, to\r\nsave the town, city, county, state and nation from disaster. A stranger\r\nreading one of these urgent calls would naturally ask with curiosity for\r\nthe names of the enemies to be thus attacked; are they Huns, Bolsheviki,\r\nhoodlums, gunmen, rioters or what? The grotesquely pathetic answer is\r\nthat they are all our neighbors, our fellow citizens, nay, our\r\n“Honorable” fellow citizens; elected by ourselves by large majorities\r\nlast year, last month, or yesterday perhaps, or appointed by men whom we\r\nhave ourselves recently elected; they are his honor the mayor; honorable\r\nmembers of the city or state legislature; of boards of supervisors; of\r\nCongress; of this and that public commission; of the state governments;\r\nofficials of every class, both elective and appointed, county, city,\r\nstate, and federal. It is not against hostile outsiders or natural\r\nadversaries, but against our own manhood suffrage officials that we have\r\nto “fight”; it is these officials and their associates, agents, and\r\nparty superiors or “bosses” who we are told by press and pulpit, in\r\nnewspaper, book and magazine, in private conversation and in public\r\naddress, and above all at the meetings of independent citizens and\r\nreformers, are the actual or potential enemies, furtive or open,\r\nconscious or unconscious, of good government, of our pocket-books, our\r\nhealth, our comfort, and our lives. We are urgently reminded that our\r\nmanhood suffrage government is by no means to be trusted; that the only\r\nhope of tolerable government is to arouse every good citizen to an\r\nattitude and a habit of constant distrust of our chosen representatives\r\nand rulers and to regard them with sleepless jealousy and suspicion. It\r\nis not enough to vote; you must attend primaries; nay more, you must\r\nanticipate the primaries and plan to elect certain primary candidates\r\nand to defeat others; even when your own men are chosen, you cannot\r\nsafely trust them; you must doubt every member of Congress, every\r\nlegislator and every official, including those just seated by your own\r\nvote; you must suspect every new proposal, every legislative bill,\r\nevery municipal ordinance; a good citizen will watch them all; he will\r\nat private expense procure advance copies of all of them; he will if he\r\ncan employ a lawyer to study them; he will join all kinds of political\r\norganizations and attend all their meetings, and will use constant\r\nvigilance to see that these organizations are not “captured” or\r\npurchased by the politicians, and that he himself is not captured\r\nwithout suspecting it, so wily are these political experts and so\r\ncunning and numerous are the snares and temptations of political life.\r\nNor is even this all; he must work up and join deputations to the\r\nsessions of the municipal administration and to those of the town and\r\ncounty authorities, to the state capitol, to Washington; he must write\r\nto the newspapers, he and others must at times bombard Congress and the\r\nstate legislature and their committees with letters and telegrams. In\r\nshort the system is this: you select the incapable and worthless for\r\noffice and then wear your soul out in efforts to keep them from\r\nblundering and plundering. Common sense would suggest the selection in\r\nthe first place of men who could be trusted; and if the method of\r\nselection failed, to replace it by a better one; but this cannot be\r\ndone; manhood suffrage though rotten is sacred, and those who have the\r\npatience and courage continue their endeavors to make a marble temple of\r\njustice out of a mud electorate.\r\n\r\nThis widespread attitude of suspicion and resentment toward public\r\nofficials, originally private and individual, has of late years become\r\nopen, formal and public through the systematic activities of clubs and\r\nassociations of supposedly disinterested and public-spirited citizens\r\nprincipally located in large cities; non-partisan in character, and\r\norganized for the purpose of preventing or undoing the more flagrant of\r\nthe illegal, immoral and improper operations of state and local\r\ngovernments. In plain words, just as we have detectives to watch\r\nthieves, so we have voluntary associations to watch public officials.\r\nThis sounds queer, but it is true. And these societies founded on\r\ncontempt and distrust of officialdom are not made up of eccentrics;\r\nthey include some of the most intelligent men in their respective\r\ncommunities; they are kept busily employed a large part of every year;\r\nand are sustained by the best public opinion in their open opposition to\r\nthe measures proposed by the manhood suffrage officials, and in their\r\nfrequent active hostility to the officials themselves. These\r\nassociations may well be called “watch dog” societies, their function\r\nbeing to protect the community from political wolves; to bark loudly on\r\nany attempt of theirs to rob the sheepfold and thus either to scare them\r\noff or to give such warning as will result in their designs being\r\nfrustrated. Thus we have in almost every city and town “Taxpayers\r\nAssociations”; “Citizens Associations”; “Good Government Clubs”; “Public\r\nWelfare Societies”; “Patriotic Societies”; “Security Leagues”; and the\r\nlike; some temporary but others permanent bodies, formed for general\r\nsupervision and bringing to book of legislators and public officials.\r\nThese watch dog societies are always on the alert; ready to receive\r\ncomplaints from any source; to investigate them through committees, and\r\nto attack anybody and anything in what they may choose to consider the\r\npublic interest. They even employ private detectives and lawyers in\r\nthese enterprises, just as in pursuit of criminal offenders; and they\r\nare usually able to get newspapers to support them and to publish bitter\r\nattacks not merely upon individual office holders but on entire boards,\r\ndepartments, committees, legislatures and congresses, and sometimes the\r\ncourts; whereby the public are told over and over again that these\r\nofficial bodies, composed as they are of from five to five hundred men\r\neach, are inefficient and corrupt. There is no pretence on the part of\r\nsome of these societies of concealment of their mean opinion of the\r\noffice holders, especially those elected by the popular vote. One of\r\nthem, the New York Citizens Union, publishes an annual statement\r\ncontaining notes of the character and record of each of the local\r\nrepresentatives in the state legislature, some of them far from\r\ncomplimentary, and all critical and superior in tone, like the report\r\nof a master of a reform school on the behavior of the pupils. In fact,\r\nthough these watch dogs do not directly attack the institution of\r\nmanhood suffrage, their attitude towards its creatures in state and city\r\ngovernment is that of a policeman toward a professional criminal. This\r\npractice of auxiliary and supervisory government by organized meddlers\r\nis well expounded in a book ably written by W. H. Allen of New York,\r\nDirector of the Bureau of Municipal Research; a man of sufficient\r\nexperience in political life to have learned its diseased condition, and\r\nto earnestly desire a palliative of its evil symptoms, but who is\r\nwithout apparent hope of discovering or extirpating the cause of the\r\ndisease. He wrote the book for the purpose of inducing citizens,\r\nespecially women, to attend to their civic duties, and he urges his\r\nreaders to join one or more of these watch dog organizations and to\r\nactively prosecute their work. (_Woman’s Part in Government._)\r\n\r\nExamples of the operations of these societies are easily found, since\r\nthey by no means hide their lights. It will be sufficient here to refer\r\nto a recent one as a sample. In January 1917, and again in April 1917,\r\none of the best known of the associations, the City Club of New York,\r\nfiled with the Governor a complaint against the District Attorney,\r\ncharging him in effect with gross misconduct in connection with certain\r\nprosecutions for homicide. The Club employed lawyers to prosecute the\r\ncharges and there was a furious, scandalous and prolonged controversy in\r\nthe courts, in the public press and before the Governor, involving\r\nbeside the District Attorney himself some of his assistants and others.\r\nAnother powerful watchdog association is the well-known Chicago Voters\r\nLeague, established in 1896. The League claims that at that time of the\r\nsixty-eight members of the Chicago City Council only ten were even\r\nliable to a suspicion of honesty, while the rest were organized into a\r\ngang for plunder and blackmail. To correct this situation the League was\r\nestablished and still operates. Its self-perpetuating Executive\r\nCommittee of Nine publicly opposes and condemns candidates for the City\r\nCouncil and directs the citizens how to vote. This, of course, amounts\r\nto a qualified oligarchy; in conformity with the usual tendency of\r\nmanhood suffrage, to create ring government in one way or another.\r\n\r\nThe whole attitude of these watch dog associations towards the\r\nconstituted civil authorities is most extraordinary, in view of the\r\nrespectability of most of their membership, and strikingly illustrates\r\nthe deplorable results of manhood suffrage. Their general scheme of\r\naction is founded on the open assumption of each of them that its\r\nmembers are superior in wisdom, honesty, patriotism and knowledge of\r\npublic affairs to the officials whom they denounce, lecture and\r\nadmonish; and, by implication that these members are superior also to\r\nthe constituents who elected these office holders. The state legislature\r\nand other public bodies are watched closely, and when a measure in which\r\nany of these societies or their controlling members actually have or\r\nchoose to feign a great interest is before any legislative body or\r\nofficial board for action or determination, the agents of the interested\r\nassociation begin to interfere; the public officials having the matter\r\nin hand are not allowed to deliberate and decide impartially and coolly\r\neven should they desire to do so; they are scolded, coaxed, threatened,\r\nbullied and wheedled into doing what the association desires. Some of\r\nthese private associations have funds subscribed by individuals, or\r\narising from the collection of dues; they are therefore able to employ\r\nlawyers to prepare arguments and briefs and political agents to go about\r\nsoliciting signatures; arrangements are made for a systematic campaign\r\ndirected towards the officials concerned, who are bombarded with\r\nletters, telegrams, postal cards and petitions; sometimes public\r\nmeetings large or small are organized, and resolutions couched in\r\nperemptory language are passed and presented at the proper quarters.\r\nShould the officials prove refractory, they are apt to find their\r\nmotives impugned, their “records” and personal history unearthed, and\r\ntheir characters publicly assailed, all from the same source. All this,\r\nwhich often amounts to coercion, is so frequently practised upon public\r\nbodies and their members as to have become a recognized feature of\r\nAmerican public life.\r\n\r\nA large addition to the list of political scandals contained in this\r\nbook might be made by recourse to the archives of these watch dog\r\nassociations and to the published reports of the charges made by them\r\nfrom time to time against the membership of the state and city\r\nlegislative and administrative bodies, and to the evidence collected by\r\nthem in support thereof, but space will not permit even the most\r\ncondensed recital of this material. Let it suffice to present here the\r\nsocieties themselves, composed as they are of thousands of our citizens\r\nof best standing and information, as witnesses to the bad character and\r\nreputation of manhood suffrage. By their very existence they go far to\r\nestablish the significant fact that the manhood suffrage state and local\r\ngovernments of the United States have utterly forfeited the respect and\r\nconfidence of the American people.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that by the work of these watch dog associations\r\nthe evil of manhood suffrage operations is sensibly alleviated. On the\r\ncontrary, when carefully considered, that work, though presumably well\r\nintended, must be considered as a public misfortune, and as resulting in\r\nan aggravation rather than a diminution of the evils of our\r\nmisgovernment. In an individual instance their efforts may produce good\r\neffects limited to that special transaction, just as might be said of\r\nany voluntary interference with constituted authority; but in theory and\r\nin principle and in the large and final results, the practice of such\r\ninterference is and must be politically noxious, and the case to justify\r\nit even in one instance must be indeed extreme. The public-spirited\r\ncitizens who form an important part of their membership probably do not\r\nrealize just what they are doing when they coerce the will of the chosen\r\nrepresentatives of the people. They would be horrified at the suggestion\r\nof using physical force or physical threats upon legislators to compel\r\nthem to deviate from their own best judgment; and yet they do not\r\nscruple to use what they call moral force to the same purpose, and such\r\nmoral force as almost amounts to physical stress and coercion. The\r\ndifference in effect between threatening a member of the legislature\r\nwith a cudgel or with printed defamation issued by a powerful clique or\r\nleague is not always appreciable. In either case the general result is\r\nthe adoption of measures or modifications thereof reflecting rather the\r\nviews of the threatening meddler than those of the public official in\r\nquestion or of the majority who elected him. This is a clear usurpation\r\nof power. Again, the watch dog operations do not offer any permanent\r\nresult in return for this trampling down of popular government; their\r\nprogramme includes no method of improving the quality of our officials\r\nbut only one for watching and nagging them. Third, it offers no security\r\nwhatever that the volunteer or self-appointed government censors shall\r\nthemselves be competent or worthy, or that they shall be anything more\r\nthan idle and presumptuous fools or designing hypocrites. Fourth, others\r\nless worthy and disinterested, are by the example of these societies\r\nencouraged to similar acts. So that the final result of the watch dog\r\nplan is likely to amount to no more or other than this actual situation:\r\nA number of corrupt, weak and worthless legislatures, town boards, city\r\ncouncils, boards of supervisors, etc., constantly nagged, worried,\r\ninsulted and pulled this way and that, by all kinds of people, including\r\nwatch dog associations and their officers, newspaper men, cranks,\r\nfanatics, busybodies generally and possibly scamps and adventurers. Even\r\nsuppose we make the extravagant supposition that no knaves or fools\r\nwhatever, but only the better type of citizens do and will respond to\r\nthe appeal to organize to boss the bosses, the system is still\r\nimpracticable, and if practicable would be mischievous; since it would\r\nresult in oligarchical tyranny. For the work proposed for these civic\r\norganizations and for their members would be enormous; it would require\r\nan acquaintance with legislative and other political methods far beyond\r\nthat possible to any one who has any other business; it would\r\nnecessitate among other things the careful scrutiny and thorough\r\nunderstanding of every bill or resolution introduced into the state or\r\nmunicipal legislature, and a steady watch from day to day of each of\r\nthese bills, and of the members of the bodies where they may be pending,\r\nand especially of those of the committees having them under\r\nconsideration. Besides this it involves the defense of every step taken,\r\nat the cost of endless controversy. As the ordinary citizen cannot\r\npossibly undertake this labor of supervising oversight of government\r\nactivities, it is evident that if done at all by this volunteer method,\r\nit must fall to a comparatively few people who have means and leisure,\r\nor who have special interests to serve; or more likely, to hirelings\r\nemployed by those people.\r\n\r\nThe result of the watch dog programme even if successfully carried out,\r\nwould therefore be the creation of an _imperium in imperio_; an\r\nirresponsible self-created governing oligarchy acting through the\r\npresent class of worthless and corrupt politicians. A more complicated\r\nand mischievous political system nor one more likely to produce tyranny\r\nand public scandals could scarcely be devised. But though the watch dog\r\nscheme cannot be approved, its actual existence is a strong argument\r\nagainst manhood suffrage; for though bad reputation is not of itself\r\nproof of misconduct, yet it usually accompanies wrong doing; and when\r\nevidence of evil reputation is here added to the general as well as\r\nparticular proof already furnished of the mischiefs resulting from\r\nmanhood suffrage, the case against that system can hardly fail to be so\r\nmaterially strengthened as to be practically unanswerable.\r\n\r\nThe weakness and inferiority of our public officials afford opportunity\r\nfor interference by another set of meddlers in public affairs who are of\r\ninferior breed to the watch dogs, and for the infusion of eccentric and\r\nfanatical ideas and theories into legislation and administration, such\r\nas would not occur in a well-founded governmental system. The class\r\nreferred to is composed of political adventurers, eccentrics, cranks,\r\nand fanatics; people whose mental vision is inaccurate; who are out of\r\nharmony with nature and its operations, and whose undisciplined minds\r\nare filled with impracticable theories. Many of them are well-to-do\r\nidlers able to give time to the agitation of any cause they may happen\r\nto espouse. Compared with the watch dogs they are as the yellow dogs of\r\npolitics. They function in every state as promoters of crank\r\nlegislation, the history whereof in the United States would no doubt\r\nmake, if compiled, a very interesting volume, containing many surprises\r\nto the general reader. While sane and prudent men are content to confine\r\ntheir attention to their private affairs, and while modest men, be they\r\never so well informed, are apt to doubt their own capacity in affairs of\r\nstate, a certain class of cranks are always eager to meddle with\r\npolitics; full of conceit they are not troubled with doubts as to the\r\ncorrectness of their own opinions. When one such takes up a fad,\r\nreligious, moral, political or social, he becomes more and more\r\nengrossed in it; nothing else matters to him half so much; family and\r\nbusiness are neglected; he writes for the newspapers; he attends and\r\norganizes public meetings; he serves on committees; he makes speeches;\r\nhe circulates literature; he contributes to the cause within his means,\r\nwhich sometimes are large, and collects for it from others. When a\r\n“movement” as it is called is once fairly started it is sure to be\r\njoined by many with ulterior motives, impelled by vanity, by mere love\r\nof notoriety, by fondness for excitement; by those who seek the pleasure\r\nof serving on committees, of speaking in public, or of seeing their\r\nnames in print; others come to make new acquaintances; to escape ennui;\r\nto become politically important. Under a strong and intelligent\r\ngovernment these collections of faddists, adventurers, humbugs and fools\r\nwould do little more harm than so many debating societies; but when, as\r\nnow, those in power are of mediocre ability, weak calibre or politically\r\ntimid, such societies are potent for mischief. The ordinary politician\r\nholding an office obtained perhaps by a majority of a few votes, or\r\notherwise precarious in its tenure is easily frightened by a show of\r\norganization. Where the proposed new measure is one opposed to the\r\npecuniary or political interests of the bosses the cranks get but slight\r\nattention; but where there are only principles involved their chances\r\nfor success are often very good indeed. The fact that they are armed\r\nwith theories however foolish, makes them appear mysterious and\r\nredoubtable antagonists to small politicians, who cannot understand\r\nprinciples or the motives of people professing principles. The official\r\nfinds himself confronted and baited by an inexorable pack of those\r\nyellow dogs, small in number, but terrible in noise and clamor, who give\r\nhim no rest; while on the other hand the sane and sensible folk of his\r\nconstituency are not only silent and apparently indifferent but scarcely\r\nseem aware (as indeed most of them are not) of his name or existence.\r\nGetting no orders from his boss, who takes no interest in the matter one\r\nway or another, what wonder if the weary legislator or administrator,\r\neither becomes half convinced by the din of arguments which he is too\r\nweak or ignorant to answer, or frightened by the criticism he is\r\nreceiving, yields at last with a sigh of relief. And so the crank\r\nproject often goes through without public notice except the applause of\r\nthe agitators, who print a triumphant account in the newspapers of the\r\nadoption of another “reform measure” and get one of their members to\r\nwrite it up in some magazine with a laudatory reference to himself and\r\nhis associates. The effect of “crank” or yellow dog influence upon our\r\nweak state governments is another of the evil results of manhood\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n     THE ELECTORATE FUNCTIONS NOT BY ITS INDIVIDUALS BUT BY GROUPS\r\n     WHEREBY THE ENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE SHIFTLESS AND IGNORANT GROUP\r\n     NECESSARILY TENDS TO CREATE A VICIOUS POWER IN POLITICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us have from time to time in the course of our lives, heard a\r\ngood deal of indignation expressed by worthy citizens over the\r\npoliticians’ organization and use of the controllable vote. But if we\r\ngive a little thought to the manner in which the electoral\r\nrepresentative system actually and necessarily operates, we will see\r\nthat the organization of the non-propertied voters was a perfectly\r\nnatural, and one might say an inevitable result of their\r\nenfranchisement. It was a step to which they were and are practically\r\ninvited by the situation itself, and for taking which neither they nor\r\ntheir leaders are logically blamable. The only people to be criticised\r\nare those who opened the door to this class of voters. The unpropertied\r\nvote became an organized group, because it could not otherwise function\r\nin our political system, which operates entirely though groups or\r\nclasses and ignores the individual. A few of the astute public men of a\r\ncentury ago understood this; the mass did not; they imagined that in\r\nextending the suffrage to the unpropertied, the incapables, they were\r\nconferring a harmless compliment upon scattered individuals whose votes\r\nwould be distributed among those of the other classes, and absorbed in\r\nthe general mass without perceptible effect. Had this been the only\r\nresult, the gift of the vote would have been a barren one, costing the\r\ngivers nothing and of no benefit to the recipients. But far from being\r\nempty, it was costly, it was real, and the newly enfranchised\r\nimmediately made use of it, as we have seen, forming themselves into\r\neffective groups for the accomplishment of their own small and sordid\r\ndesires. And so the generation of Americans who saw manhood suffrage\r\nestablished, were astonished to find shortly after, that the voting\r\npower was almost suddenly taken out of their hands by a new force in\r\npolitics. They have never been able to get it back, and most people do\r\nnot yet understand the theory of what has occurred. They do not\r\ncomprehend, their ancestors of the last century did not comprehend that\r\nthe enfranchisement of the unpropertied voters meant that they were\r\ninvited not merely as individuals, but as a class, and through their own\r\nlocal groups or subdivisions to take such part in forming the government\r\nas they were able. It was not merely that they were enfranchised as a\r\nbody, but that our political system is such that only by groups, classes\r\nand factions can any share in the government be obtained. This fact is\r\nso important, and though patent to every one its significance has been\r\nso generally overlooked, that it deserves the entire chapter allotted to\r\nit in this volume.\r\n\r\nIn our scheme of government the individual voter as such counts for\r\nabsolutely nothing. Our elective system is not, as so many believe, at\r\nall intended or contrived as a medium of individual political\r\nexpression, but as a means for measuring the force of groups, factions\r\nand parties and of creating majorities. The gift of the ballot is\r\nintended for collective and not for individual employment and advantage.\r\nIt does not imply as is commonly supposed the right of a man “to govern\r\nhimself” nor to have his individual opinions and wishes considered and\r\nacted upon. It necessarily implies joint and not individual action; the\r\nindividual voter is only remotely a factor in the process of government\r\nmaking; the direct factors whereof are groups, factions and parties. The\r\nseparate voter’s influence is no more than that of a component atom in a\r\nlarge moving body, and just as the snowflake cannot move the steam\r\nengine till it ceases to be a snowflake and becomes part of a volume of\r\nsteam, so the individual cannot become any part of the moving power in\r\npolitics till he merges his individuality into some of the political\r\ngroups or factions of the community.\r\n\r\nAlthough these plain facts are never mentioned by the politicians, the\r\nnewspapers or the twaddlers who write text-books on American democracy,\r\nyet every sensible man realizes that when he votes to any effect he is\r\nreally obeying orders. If he should write his true and individual choice\r\nfor governor or alderman, it would probably be some worthy man of his\r\nacquaintance whose name does not appear on any official ballot or\r\ndesignation whatever, and his vote thus cast would be a nullity; scorned\r\nand thrown aside by the inspectors; not counted; returned as\r\n“scattering.” Knowing that a vote for his individual choice will be\r\ndisregarded, he feels practically compelled to accept the candidate of\r\nsome group, faction or party; one with whom he has no personal\r\nacquaintance whatever; and who if elected will represent not the voter\r\nat all, nor his views, but the combination which put him forward, and\r\nwhich has an existence, a history, leaders and motives of its own.\r\nTherefore, in the act of voting, your would-be independent citizen,\r\nwilly nilly, surrenders his individuality just as completely, and is\r\npractically just as subservient to the group or party managers as any\r\npolitical heeler of the local boss. Nor does the citizen by the\r\ncontribution of his vote become entitled to the slightest share of\r\ncontrol over the group which he has thus strengthened; that group may\r\nhave some political weight, while he has none that is appreciable. If he\r\nwants to talk politics he may of course do so if he can get a listener;\r\nit will usually be as effective a performance as the child blowing on\r\nthe mainsail of a ship at sea.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary plain citizen in a democratic community of ten thousand\r\nvotes may suppose that he has the privilege of exercising one ten\r\nthousandth part of the governing power of that community. He flatters\r\nhimself. If he belongs either to no group or to the minority group or\r\nfaction, he has and exercises absolutely no part whatever in, or\r\ninfluence upon, the community’s policy or government. If he affiliates\r\nwith the majority party, his part in government is very far from being\r\nrepresented by his fractional share of its numbers. His faction or party\r\nhas a life and will of its own, and unless he has a place in its\r\ndirecting mind, he has no influence upon its movements or operations.\r\nHis importance is comparable with that of a member of a volunteer\r\nmilitary body or procession marching in obedience to orders from\r\nheadquarters. The individual member may remain on the sidewalk or go\r\nhome, in either of which cases he will have no part in the function; but\r\neven should he join in the procession he will be entirely without say or\r\ninfluence concerning its movements. His only effect will be as one of\r\nthe constituent atoms of a body which has an existence, mind and\r\ndirection of its own apart from and superior to and controlling that of\r\neach of its members.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this obvious situation, impossible to deny, most people\r\nfail to realize it, and many cannot see or will not admit even to\r\nthemselves the futility of individual voting. The illusion of the value\r\nof an independent vote, the product of self-conceit and political\r\nsuperstition exists in the minds of numbers of intelligent men, and\r\ndaily manifests itself in the cant and rubbish of every-day speech. A\r\nvery large proportion of American men like to believe or pretend that\r\nthey believe, that an effective vote can really be cast by the\r\nindividual citizen expressive of his own individual will and spontaneous\r\ndesire, and that thereby such will and desire will be manifested and\r\nreflected in the policy and acts of the government. The privilege of\r\ncasting this impossible vote is by such a man imagined as one of the\r\ninestimable privileges of American citizenship. He is, he proudly\r\nthinks, an independent voter, free from party trammels; and he fondly\r\nsupposes that by so much as he holds himself aloof from party\r\norganization is his voted opinion the more valuable and effective. We\r\nfrequently hear a man threaten to vote against this and that candidate;\r\nsometimes, filled with self-importance, he notifies his newspaper of his\r\ndire intention; others who have not even membership in any party\r\ngravely tell you that you should always vote for somebody, that it is\r\nyour duty to do so, and having themselves voted for men of whose\r\npolicies they have not the slightest knowledge or control, try to fancy\r\nthat they have employed their time and shoe leather to great advantage.\r\nThe fact is that these self-styled independent voters are in all this\r\nthe happy victims of pleasant delusions. Each of them is either a party\r\nvoter or a mere trifler. When he pretends to revolt from political\r\ncontrol, he usually does nothing of the kind; he simply changes his vote\r\nfrom the candidate of one set of politicians to the candidate of the\r\nother set. In other words, instead of being independent, he joins, for\r\nthe time at least, the other party or group and finds himself compelled\r\nto surrender his individual preferences and to vote the name they give\r\nhim. If he really selects his own independent candidate and votes for\r\nhim, his vote is practically lost; his act is futile; it is a vote “in\r\nthe air”; he might as well vote for a dead man. So that the elective\r\nfranchise merely gives the voter the privilege of joining with others in\r\nthe formation of a political group or body capable of aspiring to\r\ninfluence or power. But in order to do this, the individual at the very\r\noutset is compelled to surrender his individual wishes, preferences and\r\nambitions to be transmuted into the collective wish, preference and\r\npower of his group. He has usually no more control over the movements of\r\nthe group or party which contains him than a drop of blood in the veins\r\nof a bull has over the movements of the animal.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore about ninety years ago the unpropertied citizens were\r\nadmitted into the political arena it was perfectly natural that they\r\nshould speedily form themselves into new and distinctive groups. The\r\nelectorate has always grouped and divided itself according to its\r\ninterests and passions; witness the old division between Eastern and\r\nWestern Virginia already referred to; the tariff and slavery divisions,\r\netc. The unpropertied non-voters had already been distinguishable from\r\nthe propertied voters by their different traits, characteristics and\r\ndesires. When they obtained the vote the difference between the two\r\nclasses widened; the attitude toward the offices and the spoils of\r\noffice being that of unscrupulous and hungry greed on one side, and on\r\nthe other that comparative disinterestedness which comes from physical\r\ncomfort and well being. The core of the membership of the new group of\r\nvoters was in penury; it needed the spoils of office, to which the older\r\nvoters were comparatively indifferent. Stimulated by this need the\r\nnon-propertied groups at once sought and obtained a greater cohesive\r\npower than any possible rivals; enabling them to overcome and survive\r\nthem all. They became united and predatory political bands; easily\r\nmanageable by their leaders; willing to waive aside as comparatively\r\nimpertinent, the various abstract questions on which the propertied\r\nvoters were hopelessly divided. In short, they became a unified power,\r\nand often the only unified power in practical politics.\r\n\r\nThe strength and discipline of the controllable groups of voters, have\r\nalways given them an immense advantage in the final and supreme\r\ngovernmental process, that of the formation, management and maintenance\r\nof governing majorities. The creation of such a majority, or the ability\r\nto become a part thereof is the final test of political capacity.\r\nOccasionally majorities create themselves; as in great popular\r\nagitations when the people “rise in their might” and overwhelm the\r\ncontrolled voter. But such irregular movements last at most but a few\r\nweeks or months, whereupon the before established oligarchy resumes\r\ncontrol and continues its steady business of majority formation and\r\nmaintenance. It is a job requiring constant and compelling discipline;\r\nand one in which the controllable and always reliable vote is the chief\r\nelement of a uniformly successful management.\r\n\r\nIt comes then to this, that in a democracy no man should be admitted to\r\nvote, unless his class or group will be of service in government. In\r\nconsidering proposed legislation for extension of the franchise, the\r\nfirst question should always be, what will be the character of the group\r\nor faction with which the new voters will identify themselves? And if\r\nthe result is going to be the introduction of a new faction or party\r\ninto our political system, or the dominance of one at present in the\r\nminority, the effect thereof should be seriously considered before the\r\nchange is authorized. This being a government not of individuals but of\r\ngroups, the right of any individual to vote can be conceded to him only\r\nas one belonging to a class or group entitled and competent to take part\r\nin the government. And if his group is of the ignorant, the worthless,\r\nthe non-contributors to the commonwealth, where is its claim to govern?\r\nThose therefore who believe in unlimited suffrage, that is in the right\r\nof the ignorant and worthless to vote, must believe either that such\r\nvote will be unorganized, in which case it is an empty gift of a\r\nvalueless privilege, or they must believe in the natural right of\r\norganized worthlessness to do what it has actually done and is still\r\ndoing, namely to rule the country, or to take effective part in such\r\nrule, and incidentally to degrade the standards of government to a point\r\nas near the low level of its own intelligence and conscience as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nPrior to manhood suffrage the political groups were all transient,\r\nshifting and undisciplined bodies representing debatable theories and\r\nprinciples; this continued from Washington’s time to Jackson’s. Manhood\r\nsuffrage furnished the material everywhere for new groups founded on\r\nneed and appetite and organized by professional politicians; these have\r\nbecome drilled and disciplined, have learned to live off the country and\r\nto obey leaders. They have won the usual adherence of success; drawing\r\nfrom every direction the indifferent, the lukewarm, the careless, the\r\nunprincipled, the weak, the foolish, the men of small ambitions, the\r\nbusiness failures, and the odds and ends, in total the material for a\r\ngreat predatory political army. The leaders of that army constitute the\r\npower which governs the United States to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n     ANSWER TO THE PLEA THAT THE BALLOT SHOULD BE GRANTED TO THE\r\n     UNPROPERTIED CLASSES AS A PROTECTIVE WEAPON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe argument is frequently used in certain quarters that the vote in the\r\nhands of the unpropertied classes is a weapon of defense needed to\r\nprotect their weakness against governmental oppression or to enable them\r\nto procure needful affirmative legislation. This argument though without\r\nreal force is sufficiently plausible to merit attention.\r\n\r\nThe first and readiest answer is that the experiment has been tried and\r\ngrievously failed. They have had the ballot ninety years and have used\r\nit for naught but mischief to themselves and others. The second answer\r\nis that governmental oppression of the poor in this country is an\r\nimpossibility. It would only be possible through class legislation and\r\nthere is no conceivable class legislation which would favor the\r\nprosperous people at the expense of their poorer fellow citizens. There\r\nhas never been class legislation in this country, and it is impossible\r\nto devise, much more to enact it in a way to be effective, because we\r\nhave no fixed classes. We may use the word “class” for convenience, but\r\nthere is no permanent class of poor people any more than there is a\r\nfixed class of lazy or sickly or dissolute people, or of professional\r\nmen or farmers or blacksmiths. There is at all times a body of skilled\r\nand one of unskilled laborers, but they are not fixed classes; nor are\r\ntheir members generally paupers or propertyless; most of them either\r\nhave or expect to accumulate money or property either individually or in\r\ntheir families, and desire to have it secured to them by equal and just\r\nlaws. The poor come from all ranks, occupations and families and so do\r\nthe rich. The son of a rich farmer is a struggling doctor and the\r\ndaughter of a laborer becomes the wife of a banker. In fact, the\r\nprincipal cause of the envy of the rich by the less rich is not usually\r\nthat they belong to a fixed class, but the contrary, because they have\r\nnot remained where they were but have managed by hook or crook to get\r\nahead of their former associates. Class legislation scarcely exists\r\ntoday in any civilized country; it disappeared with the permanent\r\nclasses of former days and is now merely a tradition of a gone-by period\r\nwhen no doubt the system of fixed classes served a necessary purpose.\r\nBut even if we choose to consider the different occupations of men, or\r\ntheir pecuniary circumstances from time to time as class divisions,\r\nthere is no possibility of unequal legislation affecting them, because\r\nit is so difficult as to be practically impossible to separate their\r\ninterests so as to make such legislation profitable to any special\r\ninterest. We may of course, to please our fancy, imagine attempts at\r\nclass legislation even here and now. We may imagine enactments aimed at\r\nred-headed men or sculptors. And so we may dream of laws against the\r\npoor, enacted by a people whose charity and generosity to the poor and\r\nunfortunate is proverbial; but they will never be seriously considered\r\nin this country until we have become politically insane, in which case\r\nall democracy will be practically non-existent among us. As things\r\nactually are our intelligent people are fully aware that business\r\nprosperity to be real must be universal; that the well-being of the\r\nlaboring people is absolutely essential to the well-being of the rest of\r\nthe community, and they will never even consider a suggestion of\r\nlegislation oppressive towards the wage earners. There are three\r\nprincipal bodies of propertied men; farmers, professional men and\r\ntraders; who together constitute the bulk of the propertied electorate.\r\nNo one can imagine the farmers as consenting to any persecution of the\r\npoor; and the successful traders and professional men are interested in\r\nthe prosperity of their poorer neighbors; they are fed by a stream of\r\nwealth which comes from a surplus created and expended by the working\r\nclasses. The business interests of all the people are so bound together\r\nthat the prosperity of one is in reality the prosperity of all; the\r\nwealth of one furnishes a market for the industries of the other; the\r\nneed of one man gives employment to his neighbor; and all this is true\r\nthough the laborer and the employer and the trader and the customer are\r\nseparated by mountains, plains, seas or national boundaries. All\r\nbusiness workers, in whatever capacity, form part of a great joint\r\nenterprise, and the body of the poorer people have therefore no business\r\ninterests which are antagonistic to those of the propertied class.\r\nRather are they interested in the successes of the wealthy, of the\r\ncapitalists, and especially of those of them who are engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits, or manufacturing industries, because it is on such\r\nprosperity that their employment depends. And the situation in political\r\nmatters is similar to that in business matters. What all need in\r\ngovernment is ability and honesty; and the poor man might as well object\r\nto being medically treated by one of a wealthy family, as to object to a\r\ncompetent man sitting in the legislature or administering a public\r\noffice because he is rich. From Washington down to Roosevelt the men of\r\nold and wealthy families have in politics always given the poor the\r\nbenefit of disinterested and enlightened service.\r\n\r\nThe upper classes are the least likely of all to favor oppressive\r\nlegislation because being the best trained and most accustomed to deal\r\nwith large matters, they have been and are the quickest to learn true\r\nprinciples, and to adopt the common sense doctrine that the prosperity\r\nof the country is their prosperity, and that class legislation is bad\r\nfor everybody, and especially bad for property owners. The suffrage was\r\noriginally conferred upon the unpropertied by the vote of the propertied\r\nclass; and it is almost nonsensical to suppose that nothing but the\r\nballot saves the former from political oppression at the hands of the\r\nvery people who voluntarily conferred the gift of the ballot upon them.\r\nIn fact, the prosperous classes of our race have not heretofore been\r\nanywhere inclined to exercise political tyranny upon the less\r\nprosperous. On the contrary liberalism has always been promoted by the\r\nupper classes. Had they legislated with effect so as to crush those\r\nbeneath them when they had the uncontrolled power to do so, the lower\r\nclasses would never have been permitted to ascend. De Tocqueville says\r\nthat “almost all the democratic movements which have agitated the world\r\nhave been directed by nobles.” Historically, the case can best be judged\r\nby reference to England as a nation with political institutions much\r\nresembling ours, but much older and including an aristocratic order.\r\nThere, liberal political measures have always been actively advocated by\r\nmembers of the upper classes; and though these originally held all\r\npolitical power, it was not through usurpation, but naturally, and out\r\nof the necessity of the case; the lower classes being totally illiterate\r\nand the middle classes politically indifferent. And so, according as the\r\nlower and middle classes acquired knowledge and wealth, they were\r\nadmitted step by step to a share in the government. Here we must\r\ndistinguish between individual political ambition and class legislation.\r\nThe members of the gentry and of the great families sought to keep their\r\nindividual places and power, for the same reason that any office holder\r\nof the present time holds on to his place with all the assistance he can\r\nmuster. But they did not work together as a class against the others as\r\na class. Had they done so the inferior orders could never have risen. In\r\nFrance in 1789 the Revolution was fathered by the upper classes.\r\nLafayette and Rochambeau, who came to America to help Washington, were\r\nnoblemen, and yet strong advocates of free political institutions. The\r\nnobility of France in the National Assembly aided the progress of the\r\nRevolution as long as it was sane. They voted almost to a man for the\r\nabolition of the feudal system and of hereditary privileges. It was only\r\nwhen the Terrorists began to tyrannize by means of riot and slaughter,\r\nthat the French nobility turned against the Revolution, which had\r\npractically become an obscene and bloody march towards atheistic\r\nanarchy. This liberal attitude is not surprising, because the effect of\r\neducation and refinement is to make men not only more benevolent and\r\nsympathetic but also more just. Every man of understanding and\r\nexperience knows, that he is more likely to get both justice and\r\ncompassion from a man of high rank and breeding, well educated and in\r\neasy circumstances, than from one of the lower classes. That is why the\r\naristocratic British judges stand so high in the world’s opinion, and\r\nwhy some of the wiser among us endeavor, often with poor success, to see\r\nto it that the judges of our highest courts are well bred, well educated\r\nand paid high salaries.\r\n\r\nReturning to the subject of class legislation, there has never been in\r\nthe United States any attempt in that direction. Whether considered\r\nhistorically therefore, or in the light of present day experiences, the\r\nfear of class legislation in this country in favor of the middle class\r\nagainst the poor, is so unfounded as to be almost absurd.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion that the unpropertied should be given the suffrage, so\r\nthat they may obtain affirmative remedial legislation in their behalf,\r\nremains to be answered. But it involves a really unthinkable\r\nproposition, namely, the making people prosperous who are naturally\r\nunfitted for prosperity. As well think of creating musicians or\r\nmathematicians by legislative enactment. By no legislation can the\r\nthriftless be made thrifty. By caring for them in almshouses, hospitals,\r\nand by donative relief, the State has gone to the limit of taxing the\r\nefficient to preserve the inefficient.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that the rule of the propertied voters would be oppressive\r\nto the poor is not only false, but falsely assumes the existence of a\r\nuniversal tendency fatal to democracy and even to civilization. For, the\r\navowed purpose of our democracy is to promote the material prosperity of\r\nthe masses; and therefore, to encourage the production of property and\r\nthe increase of wealth; but if property and wealth have the effect of\r\nmaking the common people tyrants; if the thrifty educated and\r\nindustrious masses cannot be trusted to carry on government without the\r\npractise of tyranny upon the less prosperous, then democracy is a\r\ncomplete failure, and the advance of civilization is hopeless.\r\nFortunately there is no ground for any such conclusion. All legislation\r\nwhich favors property favors all classes, ranks and occupations. The\r\nattitude of democracy towards property should be similar to its attitude\r\ntowards education, that of complete friendliness, founded on the\r\nknowledge that it is a good thing, and that we all want it created as\r\nrapidly and distributed as widely as possible. The better it is\r\nprotected the more there will be of it for everyone. The interest of the\r\nnation’s workers of all classes is not to oppose property, but to own\r\nand control as much of it as they can get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n     ANSWER TO THE PLEA THAT THE PRIVILEGE OF SUFFRAGE BE GRANTED TO ALL\r\n     AS A MEANS OF POLITICAL EDUCATION; AND HEREIN OF SILK PURSES MADE\r\n     FROM SOWS’ EARS AND OF AMATEUR HARPING\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem to any one who has given any serious thought to\r\nthe subject, the proposition has been, if not urged, at least put\r\nforward, by respectable writers, that the suffrage should be granted to\r\nall citizens without distinction, solely for the educational benefit\r\nthey will receive from it. The voting booths are evidently viewed by\r\nthese easy-going minds not as they really are, as judgment seats, as the\r\nbeginnings and sources of actual government, but as schools for all\r\ncomers in politics and patriotism; as practise grounds; experimental\r\nstations; where every clumsy dunce may try his hand, hit or miss. The\r\nauthor has not been able to find any well-worked-out argument in favor\r\nof this fantastic proposition, but it has been seriously presented by\r\nmen who evidently thought they were uttering sense. The strongest plea\r\nin its favor heretofore published appears to be the following from\r\nMaccunn, which is quoted in full because the notion is such a queer one\r\nthat it cannot safely be paraphrased.\r\n\r\n     “Doubters about democratic franchise are apt to insist that no man\r\n     should have a vote till he is fit to use it. The necessary\r\n     rejoinder, however, is that men can only become fit to have votes\r\n     by first using them. There is no other way. Preparation there may\r\n     be, in the home, in school, in industrial organization, in the\r\n     conduct of business. But these will not suffice. Not so easily is\r\n     the citizen made. It is as Aristotle has it; the harper is not made\r\n     otherwise than by harping, nor the just man otherwise than by the\r\n     doing of just deeds. How can it be otherwise here, how can the\r\n     capable voter be made except by voting capably? Citizenship is,\r\n     after all, but a larger art; and to teach men to do their duties to\r\n     the State, the only finally effective plan is to give them duties\r\n     to the State to do. It is for this reason that many a believer in\r\n     Democracy is ready with an equanimity wrongly construed by his\r\n     critics as levity or simplicity, to sit unmoved under the warning\r\n     that a raw Democracy may mismanage; or that even an experienced\r\n     Democracy may not be the best machine for governing.” (_Ethics of\r\n     Citizenship_, p. 81.)\r\n\r\nAnd again as stated by Professor Woodburn:\r\n\r\n     “It is the old truth that one learns to do by doing. There is no\r\n     other way. Here is seen the unreason of the contention that no man\r\n     is entitled to the enjoyment of political rights till he is proved\r\n     fit to exercise them. It is an impossible requirement. Before he\r\n     has political rights no man’s fitness for them can be proved. There\r\n     are certain tests, educational and economic, which may be accepted\r\n     as securities, but there is only one proof of fitness--the\r\n     experimental proof which shows how men use their rights after they\r\n     have them....”\r\n\r\n     “The ethical argument for a wide suffrage--as wide as personality\r\n     and manhood--is that voting is involved in the right of\r\n     self-government; that it promotes patriotism and leads to an\r\n     interest in public affairs; that it tends to remove discontent and\r\n     promote a feeling of partnership and responsibility; that civil and\r\n     religious liberty depend upon power, and that the community or body\r\n     of men who have no political power have no security for their\r\n     political liberty; that the suffrage is an enlightening and\r\n     educational agency and that only by active citizenship can the\r\n     political virtues be developed.” (_Political Parties_, p. 342.)\r\n\r\nThis, which may be called the “harper theory,” is directly contrary to\r\nthe doctrine herein advocated, that voting is a function of government\r\nto be operated solely for the benefit of the state, and by means of\r\nmachinery as perfect and efficient as art and science can make it; the\r\n“harper” theory being that the election power house is a practise school\r\nfor amateurs and blockheads, to be operated in the vague hope that the\r\nuse of it may somehow improve their natures and understandings. The mere\r\nstatement of this proposition ought to make its gross absurdity manifest\r\nto everybody. It would justify giving the suffrage to children sixteen\r\nyears of age. As well propose to let boys snowball the passers by,\r\nbecause it would tend to give them exercise and raise their spirits; or\r\nto let the hens scratch in the garden, because they get such benefit\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning of the extracts above given strangely ignores the public\r\ninterests directly involved, the mischiefs of unwise and corrupt voting\r\nand the real purpose and history of public elections in this country.\r\nNot a word as to the importance of selecting honest and competent men\r\nfor office; not a hint at the notorious political scandals heretofore\r\ncaused by the frequent election of fools and knaves; nothing said about\r\nthe systematic use of the low voting class as organized political\r\nbanditti. The notedly unfit must continue to vote knavery and folly into\r\nhigh places, and the honest and capable must be discredited and sent to\r\nthe rear; peculation and blundering must continue indefinitely, in the\r\nhope that a set of ignorant, idle, shiftless, dissipated and worthless\r\nmen may learn to do well by being trained by politicians to do evil. No\r\ndoubt the act of voting will make even an incapable man think for a few\r\nminutes; possibly he may be tempted to wonder what it all means; his\r\nmind may be instructed as that of the small child who experiments with a\r\nhammer and a looking glass. We are told that the “harper is not made\r\notherwise than by harping,” but his practising is conducted under the\r\ncontrol of a master, and not at a public function. A better illustration\r\nthan Aristotle’s harper would be the Irishman in company, who had never\r\nplayed the violin but was willing he said to do his best if desired.\r\n“How can the capable voter be made except by voting capably?” What is\r\ncomplained of is that he is voting not capably but incapably; and is\r\nbeing trained for that purpose. The assertion that men cannot be trained\r\nfor any function except by the exercise of it is absurd. The universal\r\npractice of mankind is to the contrary. According to the “harper”\r\ntheory, lawyers, doctors and engineers should be admitted to practise,\r\nand army officers granted commissions without preparation; since no man\r\ncan prove his ability in anything until he has attempted its exercise.\r\nWhile it is perfectly true that no man’s fitness for any enterprise,\r\nprofession or work can be finally ascertained except by actual test, and\r\nnot always then, yet preparation may be required and preliminary tests\r\nmade whereby the capacity of classes of men can be judged in advance;\r\nand the fear of the mischiefs that the ignorant or unskilled\r\npractitioner may do calls for the requirement of these wise precautions.\r\nIt is well known that appropriate preparatory instruction and discipline\r\ntend to qualify men for certain duties, and the lack of them to\r\ndisqualify them therefor; that a class of men trained for law,\r\nengineering, medicine, surgery, or the army will probably become\r\ncompetent officers, engineers, lawyers, doctors, etc., while untrained\r\nmen will be absolutely incompetent. Laymen are not put on the bench,\r\nthere to learn the law at the expense of a series of blunders. The same\r\ntheory which is applied in licensing men for the professions and in\r\nselections for the judiciary is that which should be applied in\r\nestablishing suffrage tests. Those who desire to be allowed to meddle\r\nwith government should first be required to think; and if ignorant, to\r\nlearn in some other way than at the expense of the public weal. The\r\ntraining of men as voters should be carried on in the school of life,\r\nwhere their mistakes will injure only themselves, and that to a small\r\ndegree, and not the whole community or nation to a great degree. To\r\npermit people who have never practised thinking, to begin by\r\nexperimenting in the making of laws to govern their neighbors, or in the\r\nappointment of officials, is preposterous. The late war and a hundred\r\nother similar experiences ought surely to have taught the most silly of\r\nour doctrinaires, and the most absurd of our demagogues, how dangerous\r\nit is for fools to meddle with the affairs of government, and how\r\nreprehensible it is for sensible people to permit the fools to do so.\r\n\r\nWhat these writers above quoted must mean if they mean anything\r\npracticable, is that those who are already capable voters are stimulated\r\nby the actual exercise of the franchise into greater curiosity and\r\nknowledge of public affairs. This is undoubtedly true; the young doctor\r\nlearns by practice, but only after he is qualified to practise. An\r\nuntrained man would never become a competent physician by killing\r\npatients. The argument for the “harper” theory confuses the question; it\r\nignores the difference in capacity between classes of citizens, and thus\r\nmisses the point. It urges the educational value of the suffrage to all\r\nvoters without making a proper distinction between the intelligent and\r\npropertied men and the unintelligent floaters and other controllable\r\nvoters. But it is not proposed to disfranchise the former, and they do\r\nnot need the suffrage for educational purposes. The question then is\r\nentirely confined to the venal and otherwise dangerous residuum, whether\r\nthey shall be invited to take part in government merely in order to\r\nstimulate them to think on state questions. The answer cannot be\r\ndoubtful. We may recognize the fact that the interest in politics of an\r\nalready capable voter is probably stimulated by his taking part in an\r\nelection; but the proposal that a dishonest or incapable man’s vote\r\nshould be invited merely for the purpose of starting his dormant\r\ninterest in politics, or in the hope of stimulating him to be more of a\r\npatriot and less of a rascal is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThere is as already pointed out in a previous chapter a school of\r\npreparation and a test for voters in full operation, of whose valuable\r\ninstruction the state may take the benefit; namely the school of\r\nbusiness and the test of business success. In that school all may aspire\r\nto earn the certificate of diligence, industry and good judgment, which\r\nin the shape of a fair amount of material prosperity is given to all\r\nsuccessful aspirants. This method will not be infallible any more than\r\nthe graduate professional examinations; but it will establish the\r\nprinciple of fitness; it will purify and elevate politics and will\r\nafford a fairer test than any other at present known to the world.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing discussion it has been conceded for the sake of\r\nargument, that voting might possibly be a means of moral or mental\r\ndevelopment to the voter. But the assumption is unwarranted and contrary\r\nto the facts. There is no healthy stimulus of any kind to be gained in\r\nmanhood suffrage politics. The spectacle of popular elections as at\r\npresent conducted, and the display of fraud and humbug which they\r\npresent, is demoralizing to the whole nation, and especially to its\r\nyoung men. The moral injury to the voter caused by the operation of\r\nuniversal suffrage, and by the immoral attitude of the nation solemnly\r\nasserting the falsity that the vote of the ignorant and disorderly is as\r\nvaluable as that of the orderly and educated man was recognized by John\r\nStuart Mill in his work on _Representative Government_, where he says\r\nthat equal voting is “in principle wrong, because recognizing a wrong\r\nstandard, and exercising a bad influence on the voter’s mind. It is not\r\nuseful, but hurtful, that the constitution of the country should declare\r\nignorance to be entitled to as much political “power as knowledge.” (P.\r\n188.) That the practical influence of political life as at present\r\nconducted tends rather to degrade than to elevate the masses is the\r\nuniversal testimony of all having knowledge on the subject. The pursuit\r\nof politics as a business is vile, and its continued practice must have\r\na deteriorating effect on those engaged in it. As for the influence of\r\nordinary political activity upon the average voter, it is in no way\r\nbeneficial; if anything it is injurious. For generations, worthless men\r\nhave been in the enjoyment of the suffrage in the United States. It has\r\nnever made an intellectual man out of an ignorant one, nor reformed a\r\ndrunkard, but it has created many drunkards and loafers, and has had the\r\neffect of training many to sell their votes and to spend their time in\r\nlow and disreputable local political intrigues. As for the majority,\r\nthose who confine their political activities to voting for one of two\r\ncandidates without any strong convictions in his favor, they cannot be\r\nsaid to receive thereby any ethical or intellectual exercise or benefit\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n“Mere existence” (says Bagehot) “under a good government is more\r\ninstructive than the power of now and then contributing to a bad\r\ngovernment.” (_Parliamentary Reform_, p. 340.) The mere act of voting\r\nfor a man or a measure without proper knowledge is demoralizing to the\r\nmind and deadening to the conscience. Nor is there moral stimulus in the\r\nexercise of a trifling privilege, which is also enjoyed by the meanest\r\nand the least worthy, and the employment whereof is usually at best a\r\nmere futility, and frequently a farce. What moral elevation can be\r\ngained from voting to put in place either a humbug whom you know, or a\r\nnon-entity whom you don’t know? And yet this is about what the exercise\r\nof the franchise usually amounts to in every village, city and town in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe “harper” suffrage doctrine in its entirety was in the decade from\r\n1865 to 1875 applied to the Southern states, when the negroes were\r\ngranted the suffrage in compliance with the hysterical demands of\r\ndemagogues, fanatics, and sentimentalists, who made the American people\r\nbelieve that all a man had to do to become a harper was to get a harp\r\nand keep harping. The disastrous results were told in a previous chapter\r\nof this book. The history of that experiment with its sordid incidents,\r\nought to be sufficient to convince the most credulous believer in\r\npopular rule, that our Revolutionary ancestors were right in insisting\r\nthat “a silk purse cannot be made out of a sow’s ear,” that there should\r\nbe no harping except under the supervision of a competent master, and\r\nthat an untrained musical performer at a concert is certain to spoil the\r\nperformance, disgrace himself, and benefit nobody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nANSWER TO SUGGESTION THAT UNLIMITED SUFFRAGE IS A PART OF AMERICAN\r\nLIBERTY\r\n\r\n     “_In all these scenes that I have mentioned I learn one thing that\r\n     I never knew before and that is that the key to Liberty is not in\r\n     the hands of License, but Convention holds it. Comity has a\r\n     toll-gate at which you must pay, or you may not enter the land of\r\n     Freedom. In all the glitter, the seeming desire, the parade, the\r\n     abandon, I see this law, unobtrusive, yet like iron, prevail.\r\n     Therefore, in Manhattan you must obey those unwritten laws, and\r\n     then you will be freest of the free. If you decline to be bound by\r\n     them, you put on shackles._” (O. Henry, _A Ramble in Aphasia_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt a vague impression abroad, which though entirely\r\nerroneous, is somewhat generally entertained, that American manhood or\r\nuniversal suffrage is in some way actually or historically connected\r\nwith American liberties. Indeed, in some minds the right to vote for\r\nsomething or for someone, is either confused or confounded with liberty\r\nitself, or is regarded as the guarantee or guardian of liberty, or its\r\nopen and visible sign, or a combination of all three. To some, the\r\nuniversal ballot is a sort of fetish, which they distrust and despise\r\nyet dare not offend. There are even those who will grant all here\r\nrecounted of the evils and stupidities of manhood suffrage, and yet will\r\nanswer that all these, and more, if need be, must we endure for the sake\r\nof the preservation of liberty; which in some unexplained way depends on\r\nthe continuation of the voting privilege to those incapable of properly\r\nexercising it. This prepossession is not sustainable by the reason or\r\nfacts of the case, but just because it is sentimental rather than\r\nrational, it is for that very reason more difficult to overthrow by\r\nlogic. It is easier to meet an argument than to dispel an illusion or to\r\ndestroy a prejudice. It is especially difficult when the prejudice is\r\nnot definite nor formulated, but lies dormant in the mind; shadowy,\r\nvague and traditional, and yet amounting to a real obstacle to the\r\nacceptance of the truth. One might do battle with it by arraying\r\nsentiment against sentiment; the true against the false; offsetting the\r\nsham sentiment for an imaginary liberty by a true impulse of patriotic\r\nindignation at the frauds, rascalities, corruptions and waste attached\r\nto the wardenship of this pretended guardian of liberty; but this play\r\nof sentiment against sentiment can safely be left to work itself out in\r\nthe breast of the reader. This chapter will therefore be devoted to an\r\nappeal to reason to dispel whatever prejudice in favor of manhood\r\nsuffrage as a supposed bulwark of liberty may still linger in the\r\nreader’s mind.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to our political liberties. A convincing proof that the\r\nsuffrages of the unpropertied class are not needed to preserve them is\r\nfound in the fact that they were originally secured without those\r\nsuffrages. We are not indebted to manhood suffrage for our free\r\ninstitutions, nor for the valuable rights and guarantees secured by the\r\nConstitution, nor for the ideas and aspirations from which those\r\ninstitutions sprung. These rights and guarantees were secured, these\r\nfree institutions were founded by practical and intelligent men of\r\naffairs; the propertied leaders of a propertied constituency, and by the\r\nuse of practical methods, to whose success the populace only contributed\r\ntheir obedience to directions. Neither the Revolution, nor the\r\nConstitution recognized the doctrine of a natural right to the\r\nfranchise. The Revolution in fact did not deal with individual rights at\r\nall; it was merely a movement to get rid of British imperial rule, not\r\nin order to obtain more liberty, but to secure greater efficiency in\r\ngovernment. It came to pass because the thirteen colonies had developed\r\nto such a point, that their general interests and defense required the\r\nestablishment of a central authority. The British Parliament attempted\r\nto function for that purpose by laying taxes etc.; the colonies\r\nrevolted, and finally created a central governing and taxing power of\r\ntheir own, necessitating political independence. The only question\r\nsettled by the Revolution was that the supreme governing power should be\r\nAmerican and not British; it in no way concerned itself with the\r\nindividual liberties personal or political of the American people, nor\r\ntheir relations to the state; it asserted no new principle of\r\ngovernment, nor did it enlarge the suffrage. The United States\r\nConstitution was framed by delegates, all of whom were men of property,\r\nand represented propertied constituencies. In short, American\r\nIndependence was schemed, the Union founded, the Constitution adopted,\r\nand all the foundations of the greatness and freedom of this country\r\nestablished, without the aid of manhood suffrage, without the\r\nunpropertied vote, and by men who believed in and practised a property\r\nqualification system. It is not even likely that an inferior class of\r\nmen would have ever done the work, which required skill, experience and\r\nripe wisdom; qualities more often found in the successful than in the\r\nunsuccessful, and never to be looked for in the populace.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in our organic scheme of political liberty, manhood suffrage\r\ncounts for nothing, and its only activity in relation thereto has been\r\nto misuse it. But, says one, how about the citizen’s daily enjoyment of\r\nfreedom and sense of freedom in actual life? The people of the United\r\nStates like those of other civilized countries, enjoy a life enriched\r\nwith a thousand material comforts and conveniences, with a sense of\r\nassurance of their continued enjoyment; is that or any part of it due to\r\nor supported by manhood suffrage? Not at all. None of this can be\r\ncredited to any extension or enlargement of popular privileges or\r\nliberty, either by widening of the franchise or otherwise. The tendency\r\nof democracy is not towards an increase of personal individual liberty,\r\nand the act of voting, no matter how conducted, can in no way tend to\r\nconfer personal liberty on the individual; because personal liberty is\r\nnot existent in any civilized society. The progress of the country has\r\nbeen marked by development in the direction of the application of\r\nrestraint to human actions; in other words by the very opposite of the\r\nenlargement of individual liberty. The nearest approach to a free man in\r\na modern community, is the tramp who saunters along the road; and his\r\nexistence is maintained, not by operations of liberty but by methods of\r\ncompulsion. The very road upon which he walks is there because other men\r\nwere compelled by government to build and maintain it. And so, the\r\nhappiness of each of us is assured to him not by liberty granted, but by\r\nliberty withheld as well from him as from his neighbors. A familiar\r\ninstance of this is in the creation and use of a public park in a great\r\ncity; an artificially created privilege, which is not conceivable\r\nwithout the strictest regulation, restraint, and denial of individual\r\nliberty of action. Personal liberty as understood by the masses, that is\r\nthe privilege of doing as one pleases, does not exist in any civilized\r\ncommunity, and could not be introduced to any appreciable extent without\r\nsteps toward anarchy. This is not a land of liberty, but a land of\r\ncivilization, which is the antithesis of liberty. As has been well said\r\nby Moorfield Storey, “Civilization is the process of restraining the\r\nwill of the individual by law.”\r\n\r\nEvery American citizen is born and lives under the wholesome but\r\nconstant and severe restraint of a high civilization. Such a thing as\r\npersonal liberty is unknown to him from the beginning; his infant limbs\r\nare clad, his baby food prescribed, his habits regulated, according to\r\nrules established long before he was born. As he matures, his boyish\r\ndress, his books, his studies, his language and his play are nearly all\r\narbitrary and conventional. He must eat certain food at certain times;\r\nhis hours for sleep and waking are fixed by others. This system\r\ncontinues through school and college, and when he enters the business\r\nworld he finds an absolute régime of dress, food, hours, employment,\r\nlanguage, games, habits and life generally from which there is no\r\nescape. Even his beliefs, historical, religious, and scientific, are all\r\nlaid out for him. When he goes on a short vacation even for a tramp in\r\nthe mountains, his movements are all restrained, not only by the rigors\r\nof nature and the daily needs of existence, but by the rules of society.\r\nIn fact all his relations to other men, involve social rules of\r\nbehaviour which must be obeyed, and all these rules, laws, fashions,\r\ncustoms, beliefs and obligations were fixed without consulting him, and\r\nin most cases before he and his parents were born.\r\n\r\nThis subjection to Society is a condition of our life. The president is\r\njust as much bound by it as the poorest day laborer; it is the result of\r\nthe growth of population, of public order, of civilization. The business\r\nman arising in the morning and going out to his work, is reassured by\r\nseeing the policeman at the corner; with a despotic gesture the officer\r\nstops the traffic and the man crosses the street in safety. Though he\r\nmay have enemies, he knows they will not be permitted to insult him in\r\nthe street, nor to libel him in the morning papers, nor in the private\r\ncorrespondence just then being delivered by the government postal\r\ncarrier, because happily free speech is not permitted in civilized\r\ncountries. He enters the government inspected street car, elevated or\r\nsubway, protected by strict authority from the presence of people with\r\ncontagious diseases. He encounters the same regulative tendency in his\r\nprivate business life. In the elevator, in his office, in the commerce\r\nexchange, in his transactions with banks and merchants, in the\r\nrestaurants, everywhere and all day long, he is under severe\r\nrestrictions, without which, as applied to others, he could not transact\r\nhis business or even live in safety. The lease to his office which fifty\r\nyears ago contained but a few simple stipulations, now includes a\r\nhundred strict requirements formerly unheard of, all giving great power\r\nto the landlord but really operating for the protection of the tenant. A\r\nsimilar government is seen in social life; a man’s manners and the tones\r\nof his voice, his attitude, gestures and general behaviour are regulated\r\nby despotic custom. All this restraint and discipline, though it may\r\nseem to curtail liberty, yet in an indirect but perfectly perceptible\r\nway it actually enlarges its scope, by giving access to new fields of\r\nenjoyment, made available as such by restrictions on their abuse. So\r\nthat all our satisfactions, all our joys and pleasures, our prosperity,\r\nour bodily health, our very lives are derived from and depend not upon\r\nliberty but upon protection, and that moral and physical restraint which\r\nis incident to protection.\r\n\r\nThis dependence of man upon law, order and restraint for every good in\r\nlife, is not a new thing, nor a creation of modern times; it is inherent\r\nin the nature of human society; and was as true of the primitive man as\r\nof ourselves. This is not always understood. Some visionary writers have\r\npronounced a state of liberty to be the ideal state, and have imagined\r\nliberty as a precious boon originally bestowed upon man, and enjoyed in\r\npast ages in a higher degree than at present; they regard restrictions\r\nas evils, incident to civilization, perhaps, but still evils. They\r\nconsider liberty to be something positive and beneficial in its\r\ncharacter, like a birthright which man has from time to time bargained\r\naway like Esau for the pottage of social advantages. This is an utterly\r\nfalse and mischievous conception which has heretofore helped to create\r\ntrouble, and being interpreted by half-educated leaders to a foolish\r\npopulace may do so again. Looking back as far as we choose down the\r\nvista of the past, we find that then just as to-day law and order made\r\nlife worth living, and liberty or the absence of restraint meant misery\r\nand death. To find a condition of perfect liberty we must go back to a\r\nsolitary savage; for complete human liberty and solitary savagery are\r\npractically identical. From that point on every addition to human\r\nsociety or civilization, whether in the shape of persons or property,\r\ncarries with it as a necessary incident its own demand for protection\r\nand restraint. Assume if you please the existence of the solitary\r\nprimitive man, imagined by these dreamers as having perfect liberty, yet\r\nthat supposed liberty did not include any positive or definite rights\r\nwhatever. It did not for example include the right to interfere with\r\nothers, because the others did not then exist. When society came in\r\ncontact with him, he did not surrender to her any previous rights in\r\nrelation to others because such rights could not be created till those\r\nothers actually arrived. Nor could he have possessed liberty in the\r\nsense of exemption from social rules, because as there was no society,\r\nthere were no such rules. Society therefore and government came as a\r\nclear gain to humanity; they were additions to the imaginary abstract or\r\nnatural man and to his life; and the restrictions referred to are but\r\npart of the gift; they are incidental to it, and constitute its\r\nessential condition, and in no way change its character as a clear\r\nbenefit and gift to man. Thus, if one gives me a horse, it in no way\r\ndetracts from the character of the gift that I must feed and shelter the\r\nanimal. If I give a boy a drum, it is none the less a clear gift because\r\nhe is forbidden to drive a hole in its head. His liberty is not thereby\r\nrestricted, because before he had the gift he was also unable to punch\r\nthe hole. The imaginary original solitary man, upon the arrival of a\r\nneighbor, gains in companionship, protection, help, division of labor,\r\netc. He loses nothing in being forbidden to kill, to maim or to rob the\r\nnewcomer. First, because the privilege of wanton destruction does not\r\nexist as a human right, nor is it a part of natural human liberty, but\r\nis in its nature and effect a curtailment thereof. Second, because, in\r\nhis former solitary state, there was no one in existence whom he might\r\nkill, maim or rob. Coming up then to tribal existence, and observing the\r\nvery earliest and lowest exhibitions of social life, we find no trace of\r\nthe mythical liberty the theorists have imagined, but rather the\r\npractice of restraint applied by law or custom as far as requisite to\r\nprotect the individual. One savage is not permitted to assault another,\r\nwithout paying the penalty according to the custom of the tribe, or\r\nsuffering the vengeance of the assaulted party or his friends. He does\r\nnot possess the liberty to destroy or appropriate any ornament, weapon\r\nor other property that any one of his fellow savages possesses. To the\r\nfirst beginnings of property, is attached as a part thereof, the\r\nincident of protective restraint upon its non-owners. When, whether in\r\nbarbarous or highly civilized communities, the citizen is forbidden to\r\nplunder or injure property, he is not thereby deprived of any part of a\r\nman’s inherent liberty; the restraint is merely a qualification or\r\ncondition of the property in question which does not affect third\r\nparties or detract from their previous rights. When modern society\r\nforbids trespassing on, or plundering cultivated fields or orchards, it\r\ndoes not deprive any one of anything that his ancestors theretofore had,\r\nbecause in their primitive state there was no right of trespass on or\r\nplunder of that property; there were no cultivated fields or orchards to\r\nrob or on which to trespass.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is no such condition either natural or acquired as that\r\nof human liberty, nor does liberty of any sort exist in this world or\r\neven in the whole universe. The very word “liberty” is without concrete\r\nsignification, it is a mere negation like “anarchy” and “nothingness,”\r\nand represents an idea which is incompatible with government of any\r\nsort. This truth is fully realized by the best students of civics, and\r\nis just as true of American or republican government as of that of any\r\nother country or system. “All government,” says Sir William Temple, “is\r\na restraint on liberty, and when men seem to contend for liberty, it is\r\nindeed but to have a change of those who rule.” The consent of the\r\ngoverned can be given only to the mere form of government, said Webster,\r\nin a speech at the Charleston Bar Dinner, 1847, and further: “Liberty is\r\nthe creation of law, essentially different from that authorized\r\nlicentiousness that trespasses on right. It is a legal and refined idea,\r\nthe offspring of high civilization, which the savage never understood\r\nand never can understand. Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome\r\nrestraint; the more restraint on others to keep off from us, the more\r\nliberty we have. It is an error to suppose that liberty consists in a\r\npaucity of laws--that man is free who is protected from injury.”\r\n\r\nIn thus showing that what is commonly called “liberty” really consists\r\nin restraint, Webster in effect smashed the silly “liberty” legend. And\r\nRuskin voices the same idea (_Pol. Economy, Works_, Vol. 17, p. 432):\r\n“Americans, as a nation, set their trust in Liberty and in Equality, of\r\nwhich I detest the one, and deny the possibility of the other.” And\r\nagain, (Vol. 8, p. 248):\r\n\r\n     “How false is the conception, how frantic the pursuit of that\r\n     treacherous phantom which men call Liberty; most treacherous,\r\n     indeed, of all phantoms; for the feeblest ray of reason might\r\n     surely show us that not only its attainment, but its being, was\r\n     impossible. There is no such thing in the Universe. There can never\r\n     be. The stars have it not; the earth has it not; the sea has it\r\n     not; and we men for the mockery and semblance of it have used\r\n     heaviest punishment.... If there be any one principle more widely\r\n     than another confessed by every utterance, or more sternly than\r\n     another imprinted on every atom of the visible creation, that\r\n     principle is not liberty, but law.”\r\n\r\n“The only liberty,” says Burke, “that is valuable is a liberty connected\r\nwith order, that not only exists along with order and virtue, but which\r\ncannot exist at all without them; it inheres in all good and steady\r\ngovernment, is in its substance and vital principle.” The blessings\r\ncommonly called by the name of liberty are therefore seen to be the\r\nresult of just and efficient government, and the evidence is\r\noverwhelming that of such government in this country manhood suffrage\r\nhas been a constant enemy.\r\n\r\nSometimes a foolish suggestion may be seen in print that manhood\r\nsuffrage is needed to safeguard religious liberty in the United States.\r\nReligious liberty and political liberty are practically identical. The\r\nnoted religious struggles and persecutions in Europe were really\r\npolitical affairs; and the framers of our Constitution included therein\r\nguarantees for religious freedom as a matter of course. No further\r\nsafeguard is needed. The English race has everywhere adopted religious\r\nliberty as a definite policy ever since 1688, and the right to\r\nreligious liberty is no longer questioned by anyone, either in this or\r\nin any English-speaking country. There are say two hundred different\r\nreligious sects in the United States, some of which have but very few\r\nfollowers, and are destitute of means or influence to defend themselves\r\nagainst small or great persecutions; yet no one ever hears of their\r\nbeing molested or even seriously criticised for their religious views,\r\nand their security and protection are amply guaranteed by the\r\nfundamental law and settled opinions of the American people. There is no\r\nmore need of shaping our suffrage laws so as to guard against religious\r\npersecution, than there is of private gentlemen wearing swords, or of\r\nour building our dwellings in the shape of castles for defense, as our\r\nancestors did in the England of the Plantagenets. But were it otherwise,\r\nand were any tendency to religious intolerance apparent in this country,\r\nit is almost certain that it would crop out among the uneducated and the\r\nthriftless rabble, and not among the well-to-do, the educated or the\r\nmiddle class. History and experience teach that it is among the lowest\r\nclass that the strongest prejudices exist, and that it is that class who\r\nare the most violent, tyrannical and intolerant in their expression. The\r\ngreat religious persecutions authorized by governments in past times\r\nwere incited by the clamor of the populace. The upper and more learned\r\nclasses were always less superstitious, more skeptical, tolerant and\r\nmerciful. It was the Jewish mob who demanded the death of Christ when\r\nthe enlightened Roman Governor would have set him free; it was the Roman\r\nrabble who roared for the blood of the early Christians; and nearly all\r\nsubsequent religious persecutions in civilized nations, have either been\r\nin accordance with popular opinion, or have been used as weapons in the\r\nstrife between two factions of the people at large. It was the lower\r\nclasses of French who slaughtered the Catholics in the time of the\r\nFrench Revolution. In our own time, the brutal and lawless attacks on\r\nreligious minorities in this and other countries, the pogroms of the\r\nJews in Russia and Poland, and the massacres of Christians in the\r\nTurkish dominions were popular performances. So therefore, judging by\r\nthe past, if religious liberty should ever be threatened in this\r\ncountry, the menace would not come from the educated or middle classes,\r\nnor from such thrifty and peaceable workers as may have accumulated a\r\nfew hundred or a few thousand dollars of property, but from a lawless\r\nmob of the unthinking class who degrade our elections.\r\n\r\nThe reader may now fairly ask, what then was the struggle for liberty of\r\nwhich we have all heard so much as continuing for centuries in Europe\r\nand America? It had two aspects, in both of which the sympathy of the\r\nelement added to the voting list by manhood suffrage has been\r\nconsciously or unconsciously on the side of tyranny. One aspect was that\r\nof the resistance of religious minorities to majority oppression; the\r\nother, the resistance of business men to governmental oppression, by way\r\nof excessive taxes, imposts and restrictions. The non-propertied classes\r\nwould probably in the one case have swelled the tyrannical majority, and\r\nin the other would have favored as they still do interference with\r\nbusiness by the state. In the middle ages the resistance of business men\r\nto governmental and baronial exactions was almost continuous, and was\r\ndisplayed by agitations and revolts frequently described as struggles\r\nfor liberty. Always the real object was the same; the privilege claimed\r\nby business men, of conducting honest and peaceful industries,\r\nbusinesses and exchanges without interference and secured from\r\nconfiscation. There has also been in the past a steady clearing away by\r\nmerchants, traders, craftsmen and their friends and partisans, of\r\nobstacles placed by governmental stupidity, error and prejudice in the\r\nway of peaceful labor, business and general betterment. In short it has\r\nbeen a struggle to put business men and business methods in control.\r\nThese contests continue everywhere; they are still going on in the\r\nUnited States; but the non-propertied classes have never joined in them\r\non the side of liberty; they have been and are prejudicially arrayed\r\nagainst business methods and business men. The business world has\r\nalways had to win its way and hold its ground despite them.\r\n\r\nThe other aspect of the so called struggle for liberty in the days gone\r\nby, was that already referred to, of the resistance of religious\r\nminorities to persecution. This persecution, though governmental in\r\nform, was in reality a majority oppression, in which the government\r\nmerely represented the prevailing opinion. Such were the persecutions of\r\nthe British Protestant dissenters, the American Quakers and Baptists,\r\nand the French Huguenots. Had manhood suffrage then prevailed, the\r\nmajority demanding the persecutions would probably have been greater and\r\nmore truculent. We may be sure that the populace would have uttered no\r\nword for toleration.\r\n\r\nSince manhood suffrage has been established the people have created six\r\namendments to the United States Constitution, of which five were unwise,\r\nunjust or arbitrary and one merely formal. The record is not flattering\r\nto popular wisdom or justice. Here they are:\r\n\r\n_Article XIII._ Abolished slavery. This was unjust and arbitrary. The\r\nslave owners had bought and paid for their slaves under legal and\r\njudicial sanction. To emancipate them without compensation to the owners\r\nwas an unauthorized confiscation. England paid for her slaves in the\r\nWest Indies when she set them free. But then, the British voters were\r\nproperty owners and believers in property rights.\r\n\r\n_Articles XIV and XV._ These were intended to give the vote to the newly\r\nenfranchised Southern negroes. After producing much turmoil, political\r\nrascality and misgovernment in the South, the enforcement of these\r\nmeasures was abandoned and they are now dead letter provisions.\r\n\r\n_Article XVI._ This was not a new measure; it provides for an income tax\r\nwhich it was formerly supposed could be levied, and was levied, till it\r\nwas found by judicial inquiry that the Constitution had failed to\r\nauthorize it. Its ratification was little more than a formality.\r\n\r\n_Article XVII._ This provides for the election of senators in Congress\r\nby the people instead of by the legislatures. The result has been a\r\nstrengthening of the bosses and a lowering of quality of members of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n_Article XVIII._ Prohibits the manufacture and sale of alcoholic\r\nliquors. A manifestly arbitrary and oppressive majority measure.\r\n\r\nThe operation of manhood suffrage in our great cities has clearly been\r\ntyrannical, because of the absence of proper restraint upon evil doers.\r\nCan any one truly say that the people of these cities have been\r\nbenefited in the slightest degree, by the so-called privilege of voting\r\nfor their magistrates or rulers? Assuming that their political bosses\r\nwould let them vote as they wished, or that the bosses are popular\r\nagents, and that the people do or can govern in their cities, where is\r\nthe public benefit? It seems to be generally conceded that on the whole\r\nthe city of Washington is the best managed city in the Union, and it is\r\ngoverned by a Congress in whose choice the people of Washington have no\r\nshare. Does any one find his comfort or his freedom curtailed or his\r\nlife in danger in Washington? The fact is that the exercise of suffrage\r\nis a function, whose object is not to preserve liberty, but the\r\nopposite, namely, to establish proper control, and when that can be\r\neffectively done without popular elections everybody is better off.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the whole review of the relation between manhood\r\nsuffrage and the liberty of the citizen is that happiness and all good\r\nresults in the personal relations of men are to be found not in liberty,\r\nbut in just law, order and restraint, which no one believes are better\r\nsubserved by admission of the weak and ignorant to the suffrage; and\r\nthat as sound political institutions and religious toleration were\r\nachieved without manhood suffrage in the past they would probably be\r\nsafer without it in the future.\r\n\r\nThis leads one naturally to the subject of the operation of manhood\r\nsuffrage in connection with government by majorities in the present day,\r\nwhich will be treated in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nAN UNQUALIFIED NUMERICAL MAJORITY RULE IS NOT IN ACCORD WITH GOOD\r\nSTATESMANSHIP\r\n\r\n_For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to\r\ndestruction, and many there be which go in thereat; because strait is\r\nthe gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there\r\nbe that find it._--Matthew, vii: 13, 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nA specious argument in favor of manhood suffrage is sometimes condensed\r\ninto the expression “Let the majority rule”; a popular catchword,\r\nmisleading like most catchwords, and far from expressing a sound\r\nprinciple in politics. That our national polity does to a large extent\r\nrecognize the legitimacy of a numerical majority power is true enough;\r\nbut it neither does, nor ought it, declare the numerical majority\r\nopinion to be the only, nor even the final arbiter. No thoroughly\r\nenlightened scheme of government of a great nation can do so, for pure\r\nmajority government is merely the rule of brute force. Wisdom and\r\nability are usually in the minority in this world; and a better saying\r\nwould seem to be “let the minority rule”; in other words, let patriotic\r\nintelligence, justice and efficiency bear sway, and let them as far as\r\npossible lead the majority into a better way. In the practical affairs\r\nof every day life, people do not seek to learn of the majority, but of\r\nthe few. In the administration of justice the better opinion is that\r\nmajority verdicts of juries should not be received; such verdicts are\r\napt to be hasty and careless, and to lack that element of care and\r\ndeliberation which the requirement of unanimity tends to produce. In a\r\ncasual group of fifty men, the opinion of twenty-five, properly\r\nselected, or a majority of them, is worth far more than the opinion of\r\na chance majority of the total fifty. In nothing except politics is an\r\nappeal to the majority ever made; everyone turns to a small minority of\r\nmen, or even to one single man, for guidance in every important\r\nconjuncture of life. When a serious disease attacks a man, he does not\r\ntake a vote of the public or of his family, friends and neighbors as to\r\nthe course of treatment to be adopted to save his life; he turns to one\r\nlearned and trustworthy man, and puts himself in his hands. So in the\r\nnavigation of a ship, whether in tempest or fair weather; the trained\r\nand experienced mind of the captain controls at every moment of the\r\nvoyage; it is the same in the conduct of a law suit; of a business\r\nenterprise; of the construction of dwellings, bridges, railroads and\r\ntunnels; in military campaigns; in all the serious undertakings of life,\r\nguidance is never sought in the voices of the many, but in the opinion\r\nof a select few or of a still more selected one.\r\n\r\nIt is a fatal error in the manhood suffrage theory that it assumes that\r\nnumbers rule, and are capable of giving the final sanction. Such is not\r\nthe fact. Despite all that demagogues may do or say, no amount of\r\nvociferation, resolutioning, applauding, cheering, registering, and\r\nvoting will serve to prevent or delay the operation of natural law. Mind\r\nand reason must govern in politics as elsewhere. The power that is best\r\ncapable of establishing and sustaining governments and governmental\r\nsystems is a combination of forces; including principally energy,\r\nintelligence and numbers, producing a sum total of effectiveness. When\r\nallowed free play to its powers, as in India for instance, an energetic\r\nand intelligent minority will often control an inert and ignorant\r\nmajority. The basic cause for the recognition of the majority principle\r\nin government, is not a belief in majority opinion, but an assumption\r\nthat the majority actually possesses sufficient physical force to master\r\nthe minority, and that therefore in the last appeal the majority must\r\nrule. But true statesmanship distrusts majority opinion in everything;\r\nseeks to escape its interference, and to educate and guide it in the\r\nright direction. It yields to it at last with reluctance, and only as\r\nwe all yield to any of the overpowering forces of Nature; to darkness,\r\nto the deadly frost of the poles, to torrid heat, to the desert; to each\r\nof which we give way only to the extent to which we are unable to\r\ncircumvent them, and to prevent their interference with our enterprises.\r\nAnd so, astute politicians are often active in seeking expedients, to\r\ncompel the often blind will of majorities to conform to reason and the\r\ninevitable. It is the ambition of real statesmen to drive the state\r\ncoach; while the mere politician is content to climb up behind, or to\r\nrun up and down at the heels of the populace, like a servile flunkey\r\nafter a demented master, whose follies he dares not correct, and out of\r\nwhose worst extravagances he is ready to profit. Political leaders\r\nrealize that a majority vote does not always, perhaps not often,\r\nrepresent the weight of the effective public opinion of the state; that\r\nsuch a vote frequently not only lacks understanding, but also lacks any\r\nguarantee of future support for the politician who shall rely upon it.\r\nAnd so it is the part of statesmanship to mitigate or prevent pure\r\nmajority rule; to manage public opinion; to muzzle, assuage or pacify\r\nit; to create and guide majorities; to soothe and placate them for the\r\ntime being; and sometimes to divert their attention, till they melt away\r\nand disappear and reason resumes her sway.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of effectively curbing, moderating and checking majority\r\naction, was well understood by the framers of the Constitution, who\r\nerected various anti-majority or one might say anti-snap-judgment\r\nbarriers. First, there was the existing property qualification for\r\nvoters; Second, the fundamental guarantees for personal property rights,\r\ncontained in the Constitution and intended to protect minorities against\r\nhasty majority legislation; Third, the immutable constitutional\r\nprovision for the equal representation of the states in the Senate. This\r\nlast is a clear flouting of the majority theory, since it gives a small\r\nstate the same representation as a large one, and conceivably enables a\r\nminority to defeat a majority. Fourth, the creation of an electoral\r\ncollege to select the president; thus intending to deprive the people\r\nof all direct voice in his election; Fifth, the veto placed in the hands\r\nof a president not elected by popular vote; Sixth, the election of\r\nfederal senators by the state legislatures instead of by the people;\r\nSeventh, the creation of a supreme court with power to nullify\r\nunconstitutional legislation; Eighth, the system of appointment instead\r\nof election of all federal officials.\r\n\r\nCalhoun discussed the subject of majority vote in a very interesting way\r\nin his _Disquisition on Government_. He there distinguishes between the\r\nsense of the majority of the community and the sense of the entire\r\ncommunity; he recognizes the tendency to misgovernment by a numerical\r\nmajority, and the necessity of checking that tendency by some means, and\r\nhe proposes the creation of a countervailing “Organism” by which would\r\nbe called into operation the sense of the community as a whole. This\r\nwould merely amount to the adoption of an additional constitutional\r\ncheck on majority rule; and such checks are of course useful; but they\r\nare insufficient; they are directed against the operation of the\r\nmischief, but not against its root and origin. The political machine\r\nshould be so constructed that the constitutional checks on its operation\r\nwould only be needed on rare occasions, like the stops in an elevator,\r\nwhich come into play only in cases of accident when the machine gets\r\nbeyond ordinary control. A vital error in the scheme of majority rule is\r\npointed out by John Stuart Mill in his “System of Logic”; it lies in the\r\nvicious extreme to which it has been carried. All excess is mischievous.\r\nAll systems of government are bound to be defective in results, and\r\ntherefore none should be radically enforced. The so called French\r\nextreme logical application of general rules tends to aggravate\r\nimperfections. “In these, and many other cases, we set in motion a\r\nprinciple from which, while it is under control we derive signal\r\nadvantage, but which, if it breaks loose and follows its own tendencies\r\nunchecked, is highly dangerous: of which we may say, as of fire, that it\r\nis a good servant but a bad master.” (_Lewis on Authority_, p. 239.) In\r\nother words the doctrine of majority rule represents only one principle\r\napplicable to government: it contains only a part of the truth; and\r\nshould not in practise be applied to excess, or as if it were the only\r\nprinciple involved; but its original operation should be combined at the\r\nvery outset with that of other steadying forces such as intelligence,\r\nexperience and morality. “The mere counting of votes (says one writer)\r\nis insufficient when parts of the nation are electing representatives\r\nfor the whole. The parts must be arranged according to quality so as to\r\nguarantee the election of the best men, and to give due proportion to\r\nthe intellectual, moral and material elements of the nation.”\r\n(Bluntschli; _Theory of the State_.)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing may serve to clear up the difficulty in the minds of many\r\npeople, who have thought of the construction of a governmental machine\r\nas of a problem in mathematics, where only numbers are to be considered.\r\nAs Mills the logician points out, the doctrine of pure numerical\r\nmajority rule is not logical, and other considerations besides mere\r\nnumbers must be given value in weighing the national verdict in\r\npolitical questions. In determining what those other considerations\r\nshould be, it is obvious that property rights, and the qualities which\r\ncreate and preserve property, are of first availability and importance,\r\nand that the neglect and oversight of these rights and qualities\r\nconstitute the most glaring defects of popular government. The property\r\nqualification is obviously that most readily applied to the electorate\r\nand its institution is a return to the natural and original practice of\r\nthe American people.\r\n\r\nThe use of the property qualification as a corrective of the excesses\r\nattendant upon pure majority government is also recommendable on the\r\nground of efficiency and practicability. It will effect a needed check\r\non hasty, emotional, prejudiced and unsocial measures more easily and\r\nwith less jar and racking than any of the other expedients in practise\r\nor suggested for that purpose. The marginal vote between right and\r\nwrong, between wisdom and folly, is often very small; sometimes five or\r\nten per cent. It is safe to assume that a propertied electorate would\r\ngive enlightened verdicts in many cases, where the present inferior\r\nvoting body renders barbarous ones; and such decisions would carry with\r\nthem all the prestige of a popular vote. The constitutional expedients\r\nnow in force to check majority action, or any which may be invented,\r\nshould not be subjected to every day use, for they have serious\r\ndrawbacks. They are not preventive; they are not final; at best they\r\neffect no more than delay, and they irritate the masses by opposing a\r\ntechnical and inferior power to theirs; a mere obstruction as it were,\r\nand that interposed by those whom they assume to call their servants.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the logical and safe thing is to avoid and\r\nprevent mistakes of the electorate, rather than to allow them to be\r\nmade, and afterward to attempt by extraneous means to offset them or to\r\nthwart their operation; and this especially when these means are such as\r\nto the masses may seem obstructive and oppressive. As the real\r\ndifficulty in the case lies in this vicious constitution of the\r\nelectorate, why not meet it there? The object is to prevent foolish,\r\noppressive and fluctuating majority decisions. To effectuate this, the\r\nproperty qualification scheme, while accepting the fact that voting\r\npower rule is one necessary factor in republican government, creates at\r\nthe outset a majority body of voters from which it has eliminated the\r\npolitically worthless element. It thus furnishes an electorate\r\ncontaining, and capable of producing out of itself, a numerical majority\r\nwhich will also carry a preponderance in property, intelligence, public\r\nspirit and in political weight, prestige and power. Such a majority will\r\nnever attempt to rule in defiance of justice and good policy; and the\r\nassurance furnished by its very existence will promote business\r\nconfidence and general prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nOF EDUCATIONAL AND AGE SUFFRAGE QUALIFICATIONS FOR VOTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn educational qualification for voters would be incompatible with the\r\ntheory of this volume, which viewing government as preeminently a\r\nbusiness institution, prescribes as a preparation for the voter a\r\npractical business training, and demands the application to the proposed\r\nelector of the test of practical success in business life and of\r\ninterest in business affairs. But were an educational qualification\r\notherwise desirable, it would have to be rejected as totally\r\nimpracticable. It might be possible under certain circumstances to exact\r\na requirement that every voter should be able to read simple English\r\nsentences. But even that would be difficult to enforce; and if enforced\r\nwould accomplish no more than merely to exclude the grossly illiterate;\r\nit would not provide a real educational qualification. Even to go so far\r\nas to require an examination on a few simple subjects would result in a\r\nmerely nominal test; in practice absolutely ineffective, while to make\r\nit substantial would be practically impossible; no machinery exists or\r\ncould be created for the purpose. The present class of election\r\ninspectors have neither the requisite courage nor sufficient knowledge\r\nto apply such requirements; they cannot themselves be expected to do\r\nmuch more than read and write, and do a plain sum in arithmetic; the\r\nvery thought of such officials applying a real educational test to their\r\nneighbors, or to anyone else, is ludicrous. A board of college\r\nprofessors or men with similar attainments would have to be constituted\r\nin each district; the expense would be enormous; the examiners would be\r\nworked and worried to the verge of insanity; they would have to sit\r\nconstantly all the year round; with the probable result after all of\r\nriots at each election and ten years’ litigation afterwards. No two men\r\nin the country would agree upon the subjects or rules for the\r\nexaminations; whether English grammar should be required, or geography,\r\nor botany, or mensuration, or astronomy, or geology, or whether any of\r\nthese should be admissible. Shall he who fails to spell “procedure” or\r\n“acquiesce” correctly be passed because he remembers the name of\r\nHamlet’s mother; or shall the man who says “droring” or he who does not\r\nknow the name of the governor of the state, be excluded, or shall both\r\nbe admitted? Indeed, any thorough examination would result in the\r\ndisfranchisement of nearly all middle-aged men except teachers and\r\nclergymen. In short, the idea of applying any book examination whatever\r\nas a test for political capacity is false and impracticable, because\r\nthere is no real relation between capacity to remember the contents of\r\nschool books, and that common sense and good judgment which is the\r\nfoundation of all good government. But there is a practicable test of\r\nboth these qualities, though book examinations will not afford it; it is\r\nthat applied in daily life and in business, and is expressed in terms of\r\nproperty. The possession or lack of that good judgment and of that\r\ncommon sense is openly certified every day by the success or failure of\r\nbusiness men. Their case is like that of students who during the whole\r\nterm have been competing for prizes. Their records and certificates\r\nissued by the school of life are open to inspection; the ablest pupils\r\nhave been marked, stamped as it were for public recognition. No\r\nexamination or trial of any sort would furnish tests as valuable and\r\naccurate as those applied to every man day by day in the struggle of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThere is no fear that any well-educated but unpropertied man will suffer\r\ninjustice through being excluded from the polls. As it is to-day, all\r\neducated men who are not in active politics find the right to vote to be\r\na hollow privilege to perform an empty ceremony; they learn that its\r\nvalue is nullified by the worthless men and frivolous women of the\r\nneighborhood, and by the sordid political organizations created by\r\nuniversal suffrage. No patriotic man desires the vote merely for his own\r\ngratification, or except for the general good; and how can it be for the\r\npublic gain to let down the bars in his case, if a score of incapables\r\nthereby get through the fence and offset and defeat his vote twenty\r\ntimes over? It is probable that fifty undesirables will be excluded from\r\nthe polls by a property qualification for every man of worth kept away\r\nbecause of his poverty; and the latter will be consoled and recompensed\r\nby seeing his class at last obtain an influence and a hearing. And,\r\nafter all, the value to the state of the political judgment and opinion\r\nof such few electors as are able to pass an educational examination, and\r\nyet are not possessed of the equivalent of a reasonable property\r\nqualification, cannot be very great; probably all put together it is\r\nless than nothing. A man with all the advantage of a good education who\r\nis unable in this country to save enough money to put him on the roll of\r\nthe thrifty, is presumably incompetent to advise the commonwealth; and\r\nit is perhaps one of the advantages of a property qualification that it\r\nsaves the state from the ill counsel of his class.\r\n\r\nThe complete failure of mere school and college education to fit man for\r\ncivic duties is recognized by the heads of our educational system, as\r\nwell as by business men. In an address delivered at New Haven September\r\n28, 1919, President Hadley of Yale University laid proper emphasis on\r\nthis point, and on the risks attending undisciplined democracy. He said\r\nin substance that there is danger that our free institutions may break\r\ndown for want of capacity in the voters, and admitted that the schools\r\nand colleges had proved incapable of creating a competent electorate.\r\nThe “vision” which Hadley found lacking in the voters of today as\r\ncontrasted with the Fathers, is the insight into life which a man may\r\nget in caring for property or in successfully fending for himself and\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nBesides the men of books without practical vision or judgment there is\r\nanother type whose hands should be kept off the wheels of government;\r\nnamely, those who have sufficient education and fluency of speech to\r\ngive them sway over the foolish and dissatisfied masses, but who are\r\nthemselves weak in principle and devoid of knowledge of political\r\neconomy. As long as such a one enjoys a fortune he is comparatively\r\nsafe; but let him be penniless and he is apt to become a dangerous\r\nagitator. The state is safest without such men in any part of its\r\norganization. A purely educational qualification system would give high\r\nplace to the featherhead revolutionary agitators of Russia and France,\r\nNihilists, Anarchists, Bolsheviki, Terrorists, political scoundrels and\r\nmadmen. It must be steadily borne in mind that our civilization is\r\nfounded on private property, and that the rights of private property\r\ncannot be safely disregarded by the makers of the modern democratic\r\nstate but must be always held paramount if our fundamental institutions\r\nare to endure.\r\n\r\nThe qualification age of voters should be advanced from twenty one to\r\ntwenty five years. The age of twenty one has by common consent of most\r\ncivilized people been selected as that at which the tutelage of a youth\r\nshall cease, and he shall become a free man with the right to regulate\r\nhis own life and dispose of his own property. In point of fact this\r\ntheory substantially accords with the truth in the majority of cases;\r\nthe average boy ends his schooling at about seventeen years of age, and\r\nafter four years spent at college or in learning the rudiments of some\r\nbusiness, trade or calling his period of training for manhood is usually\r\nended. And so, on the theory that suffrage is a natural right of a man\r\nit might well be said that the vote should be given on attaining\r\nmanhood; but starting with the correct theory that suffrage is a\r\nfunction of government, for which the school of life is a preparation,\r\nit is clear that a proper additional period must be granted for that\r\npreparation. Ordinarily, the four years from the age of twenty-one to\r\nthat of twenty-five, represent the period of the youth’s first\r\nexperience in making his own living, in managing his own property, in\r\nplanning and selecting his own career and associates, in making and\r\nexecuting his own decisions, and generally in the actual exercise of\r\nfree and uncontrolled manhood. There can be no doubt that these four\r\nyears thus spent have a great effect on a young man’s character; and\r\nthat ordinarily he who was but a youth at twenty-one is found at\r\ntwenty-five to be a man, with a stock of manly ideas and experience all\r\nacquired in the last four years. Four years apprenticeship to actual\r\nlife is none too long a preparation for political duties, and the\r\nnecessity of this requirement will no doubt be acknowledged by most\r\nyoung men over twenty-five years of age. In the case of those who have\r\ninherited property, it is plain that a four years’ acquaintance with its\r\nmanagement, and of actual contact with the taxing power, will give to\r\ntheir votes a weight and value which are usually quite lacking to those\r\nof the ordinary youth of twenty-one years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE IN THEORY\r\n\r\n     _Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection, but I suffer\r\n     not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to\r\n     be in silence._ (I Timothy, ii; 13, 14.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere be those to whom the words of the great apostle to the Gentiles\r\nspeak with power and authority; who believe that Holy Writ will be read\r\nand heard with reverent faith long after the claptrap of to-day has been\r\nreplaced by a later folly and is utterly forgotten; and there be those\r\nalso who disdain St. Paul as one far inferior in deep sagacity to\r\nthemselves. The precept of the ancient text will no doubt be valued by\r\neach reader as belikes him. The beauty of the landscape is in the eye of\r\nthe human spectator; there is reason to believe that neither the grazing\r\ndonkey nor any of his fellow quadrupeds has yet felt its fascination.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage has been steadily gaining ground in the United States for\r\nthe last ten years, and the leading politicians have recently taken it\r\nup. It is a corollary and a sequence of manhood suffrage, its most fatal\r\nand noxious derivative. It is distinctly Bolshevik in its tendencies; it\r\nrepresents an absolute negation of the rights of property and the claims\r\nof capacity in government, and it threatens the severest blow which\r\ndemocracy has ever yet sustained. It implies the past failure of\r\ndemocracy as a governing power and is destined if accepted, to confirm\r\nand complete that failure in the future. Its adoption by a number of\r\nstates of the Union is a disgrace and a dishonour, because it implies\r\nthat the men of the nation are unfit to govern it. The implication is\r\nnecessary and conclusive, but the charge does not rest on mere\r\nimplication; the suffragettes have repeatedly made it on the platform\r\nand in their literature. Yes, to such depth of shame after three\r\ngenerations of its odious operations, has manhood suffrage brought our\r\npeople, that our women are able openly to accuse our men of incapacity\r\nto govern the country. And by adopting woman suffrage in sixteen states\r\nthe men have admitted the charge; for if they were competent to govern,\r\nif they were even as competent as the women, there was no excuse for\r\ncalling in the latter to interfere. They have been called in, and the\r\nmale electorate thereby stands a self-confessed failure. And yet the\r\ncharge of incapacity made against our men is false; they are competent\r\nto manage the state and to manage it well, but the politicians who have\r\nbeen permitted to grasp the helm of state are not competent; and so\r\nafter one hundred and forty years of independence and male government we\r\nare told by a parcel of fools and fanatics that the manhood of the\r\ncountry is not and never has been fit and able to conduct its affairs.\r\nDisguise it as you will, that is what woman suffrage means. It is not\r\nmerely an open affront to American manhood, but it is also an aspersion\r\nat once upon its training and its intelligence; for it is a declaration\r\nthat after over a century of actual participation in business, in war,\r\nin politics and in government, our men are so incapable, that their\r\nwomen who have none of this experience, are more competent than they to\r\ncounsel and direct in all these important matters. In vain will the\r\nnincompoops and sentimentalists who gave us women suffrage attempt to\r\navoid this plain conclusion by references to a few superior and\r\nexceptional women, such as their favorite wonder, Mme. Curie. The\r\ninvitation to vote was not confined to the exceptional; we have called\r\nin the whole adult female population, black and white, from the most\r\nintelligent and refined lady in the land down to the vilest negress from\r\nthe slums. The obvious effect was and is to offset every man’s vote by a\r\nwoman’s vote; and thus practically to disfranchise the men of the\r\ncountry. The votes of the banker, the lawyer, the physician, the\r\nbusiness man, the farmer, the manufacturer, the architect, each of whom\r\nhas spent most of his days in learning lessons in the actual struggles\r\nof life, are to be negatived by the votes of their wives and daughters,\r\nwho have passed their existence in sheltered homes, and who are so\r\nignorant of the business of life and politics, that they do not even\r\nknow its terms or its language. In every family, in every occupation, in\r\nevery quality and grade of life, the same absurd and degrading\r\nperformance is to be repeated year by year, as long as men will subject\r\nthemselves to the futile humiliation of appearing at the polls. All the\r\nway up and down the scale our women are notoriously inferior to our men\r\nin business and political knowledge and judgment; and all the way down\r\nand all the way up, all the votes of such of the wise and experienced\r\nmales as may hereafter trouble themselves to vote are to be negatived\r\nand nullified by those of the ignorant and inexperienced females. To say\r\nthat no such result is intended is to say that the promoters of woman\r\nsuffrage acted without reason or logic, which is probably true. They did\r\nnot realize the meaning or effect of a great deal of what they said and\r\nproposed; but yet, whether or not they are capable of understanding it,\r\nwoman suffrage must, if it does anything, modify or lessen man’s\r\nauthority. Some of the suffragette leaders saw this, and the literature\r\nof the movement is well peppered with sharp aspersions on the capacity\r\nof men to rule the country. Indeed, if male government was satisfactory,\r\nwhy was a change proposed? The entire argument of the movement was that\r\nmasculine rule is not satisfactory, and that therefore it was proposed\r\nto supersede and supplant it by a mixed government of men and women, now\r\nand forever. This change in management is inexcusable, unless it is\r\nintended to produce practical results in legislation and administration;\r\nand each of these practical results cannot be or mean less than an\r\noverruling of the male power by the female power, and a public and\r\nformal assertion of superior female capacity in government.\r\n\r\nTo say that none of this is to happen, that after all this hullabaloo\r\nabout woman’s wrongs and rights, the women are going to vote in\r\nobedience to the directions or wishes of the men of their respective\r\nfamilies, and that man’s government control and management will\r\ntherefore remain unaffected by the triumph of their cause, is to make\r\nthe whole movement futile and ridiculous. Not only that; but such a\r\nnullification of the women’s vote would add to the mischief of the\r\naffront already put upon the men by putting a separate affront upon the\r\nwomen. Far better for them to stay at home, and make no pretence of\r\npolitical action, than to go out to the polls, and pretend to do the\r\npart of freewomen, while really acting the part of puppets. If therefore\r\na practise of proxy voting is to be the real effect of woman suffrage,\r\nand there is good reason to suspect that it is so in many instances, let\r\nit be done openly and straightforwardly. There is already too much fraud\r\nand humbug in politics; let the law be amended so that for instance,\r\nwhen a manufacturer with a wife and four other women in his family puts\r\nin six votes for a protective tariff it can be done openly; let him cast\r\nthe six votes himself, without resorting to the troublesome expedient of\r\nhaving these five women, much against their will, trained and required\r\nto take a mean part in a sham transaction; first carefully instructed to\r\nvote the straight ticket and then taken to the polls and compelled to go\r\nthrough the tiresome form required by the man-made election law. Indeed,\r\nif men were permitted to vote by proxy for their women, the probability\r\nis that female attendance at the polls would before long become\r\nunfashionable and shrink almost to nothing. If, however, the female\r\nvoters, inspired by the suffragette dreams, change their natures so far\r\nas to want to use their new powers in complete independence of the men,\r\nthen will be seen the interesting picture of our women, publicly\r\nexercising their ignorance, and in defiance of all claims of loyalty and\r\ngratitude, trampling under foot family ties, assuming hostile attitudes\r\ntowards the men, and negativing the votes of fathers, brothers and\r\nhusbands whose bread they eat, who protect and care for them and whose\r\nbusiness and political experience and wisdom is ten times their own.\r\nImagine the theory of woman suffrage plainly and fully in effect, and\r\nsee what it would mean. Picture, if you will, the assembled men of a\r\nhamlet or village voting “yea” on any proposition; say to build a school\r\nhouse or a sewer; to pass an ordinance, to favor war or peace, or to\r\nselect a public official; and imagine the women in like separate\r\nassembly overruling the word of their men and voting “nay.” Would not\r\nthis be to affront and dishonour the men of the community; and is there\r\nany doubt as to which body would be in the right in whatever decision\r\nhad been made? Yet that or nothing, is the effect of this measure. Of\r\nthe woman who favors woman suffrage it can therefore be said that she\r\nwishes to see the dearest opinions of her experienced father, her\r\nbrother and her husband overruled not only by herself but by every\r\ngossiping wench in the neighborhood. Truly a noble movement! For the men\r\nwho have acceded to it the most charitable excuse is indifference. The\r\nlong continued operation of rotten politics has eaten into the civic\r\nfibre of our manhood; we have for generations seen elections turned into\r\nfarces, public offices bargained and sold, and a vulgar oligarchy of\r\nrogues native and imported ruling this land, till our best men have\r\nalmost ceased to care who votes or who is elected. If the male\r\n“suffragist” doubts this to be his real mental attitude, let him imagine\r\nthe women of his family overruling him in a business transaction, or one\r\nof personal friendship, or any other matter in which he is really\r\nconcerned, and wherein he is better informed than they; and he will\r\nrealize, that his willingness to submit to having the exercise of his\r\ncitizenship nullified at the polls, by the vote of an uninstructed woman\r\nis due to his contempt for politics, his indifference to political\r\nresults, and his realization that the suffrage has been already degraded\r\nso that it is practically worthless.\r\n\r\nNot only is woman suffrage a dishonor and a disgrace, but it is a\r\ndanger, for it threatens the existence of the state; it is a weakening\r\nof the foundations at a time when we are menaced with attacks by every\r\nband of the rapidly organizing enemies to property and to the social\r\norder. Is it fit when the day of stress comes that the power of this\r\ncountry should be in the hands of women and woman-led politicians? If we\r\nwill not take counsel of common sense, let us be warned of our fears, to\r\nstep backward while there is time, for the precipice is directly in our\r\npath.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the cause of woman suffrage, like to that of manhood\r\nsuffrage a century ago, is due to the apathy of half the population and\r\nthe failure of the other half to understand the question. And just as\r\nmanhood suffrage was adopted without serious discussion or any real\r\nstudy of its tendencies, so woman suffrage is rapidly making its way in\r\na careless, stupid and bewildered electorate, of which a large portion\r\nand that the most intelligent has long ago abandoned politics as\r\nhopeless and disgusting. No doubt, the adoption of the manhood suffrage\r\ntheory prepared the way for this result, first by promulgating the false\r\ndoctrine of a natural right to vote, and second by weakening the\r\nelectorate. When the principle of a qualified electorate was abandoned,\r\nwe lost the only sane and safe basis on which a democratic government\r\ncan possibly exist; once reject the rule of fitness, and there is no\r\nvalid reason why all the deficient and worthless should not have their\r\nsay in government, and the way is laid open for rule by ignorant and\r\nincapable numbers instead of by knowledge and capacity. The admission of\r\nwomen to the voting booths is merely a new and wider application of the\r\nformer doctrine of the right of the ignorant and unfit to govern. Let it\r\nbe conceded that no voter can be excluded from the polls for incapacity\r\nshown by failure in life, and it becomes difficult to exclude for\r\nsimilar incapacity resulting from sex. The abolition of all\r\nqualifications for male voters, and the admission of a horde of male\r\nincompetents to the ballot box, has prepared the way for the granting of\r\nthe privileges of the ballot to a sex almost universally incompetent for\r\nthe exercise of the franchise.\r\n\r\nAnd further, manhood suffrage not only smoothed the path for woman\r\nsuffrage by weakening and degrading the electorate who were to pass on\r\nthe question, but incidentally by driving out in disgust great numbers\r\nof the wise and worthy from active participation in politics; with the\r\nresult that the body politic has hardly, if at all, power or virtue\r\nsufficient to save itself from the assaults of that clamorous band of\r\nfemale fanatics and triflers who seek diversion in public affairs. The\r\nadoption of woman suffrage at the command of this noxious horde is the\r\nmost degraded performance of and the most mischievous transgression by\r\nthe manhood suffrage system since its establishment.\r\n\r\nThe ruling politicians of both parties, who were at first afraid of\r\nwoman suffrage, and next doubtful or lukewarm, have now generally come\r\nto favor it, and are quite ready to welcome an influx of new voters\r\nstill more ignorant and emotional than those they had already learned to\r\nmaster. They might, of course, have defeated the movement; but they had\r\nno motive to exclude from the polls masses of women, mostly ignorant and\r\ngullible, and often sordid, who with a little change in methods, may be\r\npurchased, deceived and controlled, even more easily than the\r\nnondescript men who have heretofore constituted the sure following of\r\nthe bosses. Besides, the politicians cannot safely or consistently\r\nadvocate or countenance the establishment of any qualification whatever\r\nfor the exercise of political functions; the leaders and their\r\ninstruments being notoriously unfit for the offices and their followers\r\nfor the voting booths.\r\n\r\nThat the great state of New York should be one of those to grant full\r\nsuffrage to women strikingly illustrates and proves the incapacity of\r\nthe manhood suffrage electorate. The state’s vote in that behalf could\r\nonly have been given by a constituency grossly stupid, or so neglectful\r\nof its duties as to be indifferent to the grotesque scandals already\r\nproduced in New York by the operation of manhood suffrage. And now, its\r\nvoting mass, which already was far inferior in intelligence and\r\nefficiency to what it should be, has by its own decree provided that\r\nhereafter it will be still more ignorant and inefficient. The fact is,\r\nthat the whole American electorate, especially in states containing\r\ngreat and absolutely machine ruled cities, has become demoralized by\r\nmanhood suffrage to the extent that it has ceased to study the\r\nphilosophy of government and finds itself totally unprepared to discuss\r\nthe suffrage question intelligently. A few cheap catch words such as the\r\n“majority must rule” and “every citizen should vote” constitute nowadays\r\nthe political creed and sum up the political knowledge of the ordinary\r\nAmerican. The women suffragists utter mere claptrap; but claptrap\r\nperfectly suits the popular ear, and is all that any one has needed to\r\nutter on political platforms ever since manhood suffrage was adopted;\r\nthey press upon the voters their superficial argument that as no\r\nqualification was required from a man, none should be required of a\r\nwoman; they contrast the good respectable women who are refused the\r\nsuffrage with the miserable male sots, loafers and ignorant boors to\r\nwhom it has been granted; and they urge that nothing can be worse than\r\nour present political condition. In this, by the way, they will find\r\ntheir mistake as time goes on; for Uncle Sam, like the man who is made\r\nshaky on his legs by two glasses of whiskey, will not be steadied by\r\ndoubling the dose that disabled him. However, in these and similar\r\narguments, there appears to the superficial mind so much plausibility\r\nthat on the strength of them, millions of women have been put on the\r\nvoting lists; most of them absolutely ignorant of business life and of\r\nthe practical workings of political institutions built up by men year by\r\nyear in the centuries gone by; most of them besides almost totally\r\ndevoid of any realization of the tragedy of the situation, of the\r\ntremendous interests involved, or of the dangers to which a nation is\r\nsubject, which goes drifting along without firm, strict and competent\r\nmasculine governmental management and control.\r\n\r\nLet it be clearly understood before proceeding further, that it is not\r\nwithin the scope or plan of this book to discuss what is called\r\n“feminism,” or even to go into the whole case against woman suffrage,\r\nbut merely to apply to the female suffrage problem, the reasoning herein\r\napplied to the manhood suffrage institution. The inquiry here is merely\r\nwhether or not women may be expected by their votes to contribute to the\r\npublic welfare. It will be well, however, just to mention the principal\r\npoints made by those opposed to giving the franchise to woman, which are\r\nadditional to those included in the argument herein presented, so as to\r\nmake it clear that the failure of the writer to urge them in detail must\r\nnot be taken to indicate any disregard of their value; they are not\r\ndwelt upon only because outside of the scheme of the work. These\r\nmiscellaneous points made by the anti-female suffragists are as follows:\r\n\r\nThat the ultimate sanction for every political decree is force; modern\r\nforce is expressed in naval and military terms; women are incapable of\r\nmilitary or naval service, they cannot back their votes by force. To say\r\nthat because they can nurse the wounded they are therefore combatants is\r\nlike saying that the man who blows the organ is a musician. We have also\r\nthe objections founded on mental or moral deficiency; that government\r\nneeds creative energy, and that women are not as creative as men, no\r\nsupreme work of genius for instance having ever been created by a woman;\r\nthat woman is inferior to man in strength of intellect, in power of\r\nconcentration and moral perception; that she has no larger view than man\r\non any subject, but on many subjects a much narrower view; that women\r\nare more subject than men to passion and prejudice; that they have less\r\npublic or civic virtue, and that in order to overcome their inferiority\r\nin these particulars they would have to pass through all the developing\r\nexperience of men in all the past centuries. Another: that women are\r\nusually dependents, whereas no voter should be a dependent. Also, that\r\nthe State does not need women except to raise children; all other\r\nservices, such as agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, military\r\nand naval duties, construction, shipping, engineering, finance,\r\nliterature, science, invention, etc., being better performed by men.\r\nThere are also biological considerations of great force operating\r\ngenerally against the feminist theory of the natural equality of the\r\nsexes; and which though not sufficient to forbid woman’s casting a vote,\r\nare effective reasons against her going into political strifes and\r\ncontests. There are, for instance, the physical weaknesses incidental to\r\ntheir sex, the importance of maternity and of all the functions\r\nappertaining thereto; the need in the interests of humanity of guarding\r\nthe mothers of the race present and future from all undue physical\r\nstrain and burden; the danger as a result of feminism of the evolution\r\nof a type of woman expressing masculine characteristics, and incapable\r\nof arousing the passion of love, thus depriving men of the beauty and\r\ncharm of women, imperiling the comeliness of the race, abolishing the\r\nlady and ladyhood, and drying up the source of poetry; then there is the\r\nargument that the biological development and evolution of woman, and of\r\nthe race, is destined to come by means of the growth of greater and\r\ngreater differences between the sexes, and not by women copying men;\r\nthat feminism in all its aspects is hostile to marriage; that the years\r\nnecessary to feminist training would bring women to an age too advanced\r\nfor the best marriages; that women and men are not equals, there being\r\nno equality in nature; and that women need the maintenance and\r\nprotection of the male for their best advantage and that of their\r\nchildren, whereas the tendency of the woman suffrage movement and of all\r\nfeminism is clearly towards separation of the sexes and female economic\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nHaving thus merely mentioned these points which have been often\r\npresented and discussed by other writers, we may proceed to apply to the\r\nquestion of woman suffrage the same test already applied to manhood\r\nsuffrage, by propounding the query whether it is for the benefit of the\r\nstate? And here we find that every objection already urged in this\r\nvolume to giving the vote to unpropertied men, applies with increased\r\nforce to giving it to women of all classes. As there is no natural right\r\nin man to the vote, so there can be none in woman; and in the light of\r\nreason, woman suffrage stands condemned on every ground urged in this\r\nbook for the condemnation of manhood suffrage. In whatever respects\r\nmanhood suffrage has in this book been condemned as injurious, woman\r\nsuffrage is more injurious. In short, the theory upon which woman\r\nsuffrage is advocated by its supporters is entirely incompatible with\r\nthe theory of suffrage advanced by the writer, and indeed with any\r\ntheory on which a property qualification can be imposed upon voters. In\r\ndealing with this subject therefore, instead of treading again ground\r\nalready gone over, the writer prefers to call attention briefly to the\r\ndoctrines of the woman suffrage creed already dealt with and confuted by\r\nhim in his discussion of manhood suffrage, as follows:\r\n\r\nWoman suffragists adopt the manhood suffrage theory of a natural right\r\nto vote, and seek to widen its application; the writer and those who\r\nagree with him condemn that theory, and seek to narrow its operation.\r\nThey insist that political voting is a natural right; we, that it is a\r\npublic function. They regard the vote as cast for the benefit of the\r\nvoter; we insist that it be given solely for the benefit of the state.\r\nThey affirm that the present suffrage is not wide enough; we say that it\r\nis too wide. They seek a remedy for misgovernment by going further in\r\nour present course; we propose to retrace our steps. They demand that\r\nall adults be invited to participate in government; we insist that all\r\nbut the well qualified should be excluded. They say that the adult\r\npopulation in the mass is competent to pass upon candidates and\r\npolicies; we say it is not; that a much more competent and honest body\r\nfor the purpose is furnished by the successful men of business, evolved\r\nby the process of natural selection. They seek political counsel of\r\neveryone; including the weak, the inexperienced and unreliable; we\r\nreject all but that of the strong, experienced and trustworthy. They\r\nconsider the polling booth as a preparatory school for triflers, fools\r\nand the ignorant; we regard it as a seat of judgment from which those\r\nthree classes should be strictly excluded. They speak of “liberty” and\r\n“self government” as ideal products of universal suffrage; we say in\r\nthe first place that “liberty” and “self government” are impossible in a\r\ncivilized country; and second, that instead of “self government” manhood\r\nsuffrage has produced and can only produce machine and ring government;\r\nand that the votes of women given under universal suffrage will and must\r\nstrengthen these rings and machines.\r\n\r\nSummarized in the fewest possible words, the gist of the previous\r\nchapters, as far as they affect both sexes, women as well as men, is,\r\nthat voting is not a natural right but a public function, to be\r\nexercised solely for the benefit of the state; and that the suffrage\r\nshould be entrusted only to those who have shown themselves to be duly\r\nqualified, and never to the weak, inexperienced or dependent. These\r\nsimple propositions, accepted or considered established, the question of\r\ngranting or refusing the vote to women is much simplified, being\r\nnarrowed to one of political expediency, dependent upon their proven\r\ncapacity to function as voters.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly not a question of the capacity of some, but of all\r\nwomen, for unless the quality of the entire female electorate is\r\npolitically superior to that of the entire male electorate the former\r\nshould not be introduced into our political system. Nor is it a matter\r\nof comparison of any other than civic or political quality; it is\r\nimmaterial whether women are morally superior to men, or better church\r\ngoers or more sentimental; the question is whether they are politically\r\nas capable; that is whether they are as capable of selecting the\r\ndirectors of the state, or of directing her themselves, and of shaping\r\nher policies as the men are. But of the answer to this there can be no\r\npossible uncertainty; no one doubts male superiority in these\r\ncapacities; to deny it in the face of the well-known characteristics of\r\nthe human male, as well as the notorious advantages that men have over\r\nwomen in point of business and political training and experience, is to\r\ndefy common sense. Government is an institution established for a kind\r\nof work which is essentially masculine. It is designed not only for the\r\nprosecution of great business enterprises in peace, but of foreign wars\r\ngreat and small, for national defense, and for that diplomacy which is\r\narmed and threatening. Political capacity requires mental power,\r\ncourage, firmness of character, determination, physical strength,\r\nmilitary capability, business training and experience and ability to\r\nrule. These are essentially masculine qualities; and while few men have\r\nthem all highly developed, yet those attributes or some of them are\r\nmoderately present in most men and to a considerable extent in some men\r\nin every community; whereas most women are almost or quite destitute of\r\nall of them. Sensible women fully recognize their difference from men in\r\nrespect to those qualities, and for that reason they especially value\r\nthem, and seek for them in selecting their husbands, lovers, lawyers and\r\nphysicians. It is apparently conceded even by the female suffragists,\r\nthat most public offices should be filled by men rather than by women,\r\non account of this masculine superiority in political efficiency. Now,\r\nit cannot surely be expected that women who are notoriously lacking in\r\nfirmness, courage, determination and good judgment, will as voters be as\r\nexpert as men in weighing these qualities, in appreciating their extent,\r\nor in discovering their presence or absence in the various male\r\ncandidates for office presented for a choice.\r\n\r\nNot only are the majority of women destitute of capacity to take a\r\npersonal part in government themselves, but they have no taste for\r\npolitics, nor desire to become proficient therein; they usually dislike\r\nto read or to seriously discuss political matters of any kind. One would\r\nlike to be able to say, that none of them care to take part in the vile\r\nintrigues or acts of violence, which are the unfortunate incidents of\r\ncertain low political work, but this cannot truthfully be said, in view\r\nof the ballot box stuffing in Colorado, the picketing of the White\r\nHouse, the insults to and assaults upon high officials here and in\r\nEngland and the numerous petty crimes committed there by militant\r\nsuffragettes or their hirelings. But for high or abstract politics, the\r\nstudy of political questions, statesmanship, political history and\r\npolitical economy, women have very little taste, if any. It is the\r\ngeneral opinion that the great majority, probably three-fourths of the\r\nwomen of the United States do not desire the vote at all, never have\r\ndesired it, and have no idea what to do with it. The suffragette leaders\r\nare not politicians nor political students, but agitators; being\r\nimpelled to that vocation not by a taste for politics but by a love of\r\nmoney and notoriety. The only recorded case of a census of women’s\r\nopinion on female suffrage which has come to the writer’s attention was\r\nin or about 1908, when a Mr. Bray, a member of the legislature from some\r\ncity of Wisconsin, took a ballot of the women in his district, about\r\neight thousand in number, for his private instruction upon this subject;\r\nwith the result that not a single ward, city or village returned a\r\nmajority for suffrage. In a certain working people’s ward, the vote was\r\nfrom three to seven against the franchise to one in its favor. Most\r\nteachers, older scholars, librarians, nurses and dressmakers voted\r\n“Yes.” A large majority of bookkeepers, stenographers, clerks, factory\r\ngirls and hotel employees voted “No.” Of the whole eight thousand women,\r\nfully two-thirds voted “No” on the question. That is to say, two-thirds\r\nof the women agreed that not only they themselves but also the other\r\none-third were unfit to be voters. The fact that the other third\r\nconsidered themselves competent is of little consequence; probably they\r\nexcel the others in nothing more than self-conceit, and that supremest\r\nignorance which is unaware of its own want of knowledge; but even if\r\nthis third were eager to vote and would make a good use of the\r\nfranchise, that fact would not justify the admission to the electorate\r\nof the other two thirds, who by their own admission are certain to\r\nmisuse it. A sensible man will not eat an entire apple of which two\r\nthirds is rotten or unripe, and whoever does so is likely to pay the\r\npenalty.\r\n\r\nIn the United States or the communities of the United States where women\r\nat present vote, it is presumable and the best evidence obtainable shows\r\nthat most of those who really expect advantage from the suffrage are\r\npolitical adventuresses, socialists and female cranks; the remainder\r\nexercise the vote without any real understanding of what they are doing;\r\nsome because they are paid or coerced, others reluctantly and only from\r\na mistaken sense of duty, or upon the advice or direction of some\r\nhusband, father, brother, lover, clergyman or friend; or in\r\ngratification of some spite, passion, fad or caprice which has possessed\r\nthem for the time being. Most of them, even those who pretend to\r\nintelligence, are less fit to vote than the grimy day laborer, whose\r\ndaily talk in the beer saloon is largely of the practical politics of\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\nSome suffragettes, while acknowledging the existence of this notorious\r\npolitical indifference and ignorance of women, say that it is but\r\ntemporary, and will disappear with time; that with the incentive of the\r\nvote women will by degrees acquire a taste for politics. This is the\r\nsame hollow “harper” argument herein already punctured, that was used to\r\njustify the giving the ballot to the Southern freedmen in 1866 with\r\ndisastrous results. It offers a very poor outlook for the state;\r\npresenting at best a dim hope that the quality of the female vote may\r\naspire some centuries later to equal that which we have already obtained\r\nin the male vote. Meantime the country must suffer while the women\r\npractise and learn; and after all the result will only be to bring us up\r\nto our present standard and that some generations hence.\r\n\r\nBut in fact there is no such hope; the women will never learn politics\r\nbecause they will never study it; the incentives offered do not appeal\r\nto women with sufficient force to induce them in the mass to enter into\r\npolitics; their indifference thereto is incurable; it amounts in many\r\ncases to positive aversion, and proceeds from causes which are likely to\r\ncontinue to operate for an indefinite period, and which are sufficiently\r\npermanent in their nature to justify a strong apprehension that if woman\r\nsuffrage prevails the national fabric may sometime be endangered\r\nthereby. Foremost among these causes is the compelling power of Nature\r\nherself, who gave the woman an organism, instincts, and ambitions of\r\nher very own; who ordained that she should be something better and more\r\nprecious than a cheap echo and imitation of man, and that she should\r\nhave her own pleasures, her own tastes, her own loves and hates, her own\r\nlife, and a capacity for higher existence than grovelling in the muck of\r\nuniversal suffrage politics. One of these natural instincts requires,\r\nand always will require, healthy minded women to make it their first\r\nobject to please men. Now, the female politician is odious to most men,\r\nand the display of masculine qualities by a woman is apt to provoke them\r\nto something like disgust. This, the female suffragette leaders fail to\r\nrealize; they themselves are rather peculiar than typical; some of them\r\nare eccentrics who imagine themselves superior when they are merely odd,\r\nand are or pretend to be devoid of that instinctive desire for male\r\nadmiration and to be charming, which is the inspiration of the best in\r\nwoman. But they will never be followed by the mass of loving and\r\npractical women into the dreary abode where they pass their cold and\r\nshrill existences. Already the women voters in States where woman\r\nsuffrage is established are deserting these female agitators; they are\r\nbeing deposed from leadership, and male politicians are rapidly taking\r\ncommand, and replacing them by their own lieutenants, usually women who\r\navoided the suffrage agitation; often the wives and sisters of these\r\npoliticians. So that it is already coming to pass that female politics,\r\ninstead of representing woman’s political independence, will strengthen\r\nmale bossism; thus affording one more instance of the operation of\r\nNature’s fiat that certain jobs are exclusively for men, and that one of\r\nthem is the job of governing the world and every part thereof.\r\n\r\nNot only is it true that women as a class have no natural liking for\r\npolitics, but they will never become acquainted with it for want of\r\nproper opportunity. Such opportunity is in the nature of things confined\r\nto the men of the nation, and comes from mixing with other men, and with\r\nthe transactions and business of other men day after day. A slight\r\nacquaintance with it may be acquired by reading, or instruction, but\r\nnot nearly as much as by the constant, never-ending intercourse of men\r\nof affairs with each other, on the mart, and in the business places of\r\nthe city and country. Our standards of life are such, that women, even\r\nif their natural tastes did not disincline them to it, are necessarily\r\nexcluded from that intercommunion with business men; therefore, the\r\ninformation and experience thus obtained by men are not within the reach\r\nof women, even of those employed by men in stores and offices, most of\r\nwhom are further debarred therefrom by their being in subordinate\r\nemployments. Nor are women, even so-called business women, as a class,\r\nengaged in the acquisition of property; even when employed in business\r\nor a profession, their proficiency being inferior to that of men, they\r\ndo not often earn sufficient to enable them to make substantial\r\naccumulations; and they seldom make a life career of any employment in\r\nwhich they are engaged. Of the comparatively small number of women\r\nemployed in mercantile pursuits or in the business part of\r\nmanufacturing, the practical knowledge possessed by most of them, of the\r\neffects of legislation in government administration, of the tariff for\r\ninstance, taxation, corporate law, banking law, etc., is so small as to\r\nbe negligible.\r\n\r\nPassing, because it speaks for itself, the case of the millions of\r\nnegresses to whom it is proposed to give the ballot, and considering\r\nthat of the white women only, we find that to the vast majority of\r\nfarmer’s wives, female servants, factory girls, dressmakers, sewing\r\nwomen, waitresses, shop girls and the like, the very word “politics”\r\nconveys no exact or correct meaning; by far the most of them are not\r\nonly lacking in acquaintance with the subjects of political economy,\r\nfinance, constitutional law, foreign trade relations and treaties with\r\nforeign nations, but they are unable even to correctly define the names\r\nof those subjects. Then coming to a better read class of women, such as\r\nteachers, stenographers, bookkeepers, cashiers, typewriters, etc., while\r\nmany of them would be able to give the definitions alluded to, their\r\nknowledge would scarcely go farther. Very few of them ever read the\r\nnewspaper political articles; still fewer have ever read or heard\r\ndiscussed a work of any sort on politics or political questions. Why,\r\nindeed, should they read works which deal exclusively with matters\r\nbelonging to masculine life? In fact most women belonging to the classes\r\nabove mentioned, except such factory girls as are socialists, have\r\nrefrained from taking part in the suffrage agitation and from any demand\r\nfor the ballot. Most good women who believe in woman suffrage, hope to\r\nbecome instructed in politics through reading books, newspapers and\r\nmagazines; and it is noticeable that the female suffragists constantly\r\ntalk and write as though intelligence enough to read were sufficient\r\nqualification for a voter; they assume that one can learn how to vote by\r\nmerely reading the newspapers; completely ignoring the qualities and\r\ntraining which will enable the voter to properly understand and weigh\r\nthe newspaper statements, and to discard newspaper lies. Mere general\r\nintelligence is not a sufficient endowment for a voter; otherwise an\r\nentire stranger in the community could cast a wise vote at its\r\nelections; he needs as well that good judgment and firmness, that\r\nknowledge of actual life, of business needs and conditions, of local\r\ncircumstances, and of the motives and reputation of public men, which\r\nwomen can never hope to acquire in the same degree as men. No subject\r\ncan be mastered merely by reading, and politics least of all; and it is\r\nof all branches of knowledge the one which women are least fitted to\r\nacquire. For politics is concerned with the doings of men in their\r\npursuit of money and fame; and in modern times especially with their\r\nbusiness doings. The pursuit of money and fame are essentially masculine\r\nvocations; it is impossible for women even to attempt to compete with\r\nmen in those undertakings, nor to understand their conditions, nor with\r\nrare exceptions do women ever really wish to do so. As a branch of\r\nknowledge politics includes such subjects as history, finance,\r\neconomics, foreign trade relations, war, legal principles,\r\nconstitutional law, naval affairs, the study of men and of their\r\nprejudices and capabilities. Few men have time or inclination to study\r\nthese matters in the abstract sufficiently to enable them to properly\r\nestimate important political measures. But this defect in men’s\r\neducation is corrected to a very considerable extent, by daily practical\r\nexperience. Business men are experts in innumerable activities of which\r\ntheir women are absolutely ignorant, and they are thus made capable of\r\nunderstanding the language of many of those subjects. They have besides,\r\nthe inestimable advantage of actual contact with men and groups of men,\r\nin their daily business life, who are more or less interested in these\r\nmatters; of hearing their opinions directly or at second hand; with the\r\nfurther advantage of experience direct or indirect in the results or\r\neffects of political action. All this is part of the atmosphere and\r\ncircumstance of a man’s business life. An appreciable portion of this\r\ninformation is constantly being spread and distributed by business men,\r\nand find its way from them into the minds of the farmers, mechanics and\r\nother men similarly interested. The result is, and has been, to set up\r\namong active and thrifty men a current of practical information\r\nconcerning public matters, and to create a taste for politics, and for\r\nthe subjects cognate to politics, which is practically universal among\r\nmen, and is almost utterly lacking in women, who not only do not possess\r\nit, but do not realize its existence. Many a village boy of fifteen has\r\nmore curiosity about politics, and more real knowledge thereof than any\r\nwomen in the community.\r\n\r\nHaving thus it is hoped without too much prolixity, presented our\r\nargument against female suffrage, let us take up one by one and reply to\r\nthe principal points made by its friends in its favor in their\r\npublications and other public utterances.\r\n\r\nA. _The “Nagging” or “Henpeck” scheme._ This is a theory or explanation\r\nof the intended operation of woman suffrage, offered by many\r\nsuffragists, who apparently realize some of the manifest dangers and\r\nabsurdities likely to attend upon female legislation and administration.\r\nThey deprecate any idea of abolishing man’s supremacy in government, or\r\nof subverting his time-honored institutions; they insist that female\r\nsuffrage does not mean the introduction into politics of a new\r\npolitical power, nor even a modification of the present masculine\r\nrégime; it is no more than a convenient method of placing at the\r\ndisposal of the governing males a source of female wisdom of which they\r\nhave heretofore been deprived. The female politicians are merely to\r\nrecommend and urge such measures, mostly in family and sociological\r\nmatters, as the governing males may happen to overlook; it being\r\nassumed, no one knows why, that woman’s knowledge of these subjects is\r\nintuitive, inborn, at any rate superior to man’s. Under this plan, the\r\nmen are of course to be free to reject the advice of the new women;\r\notherwise they would be in the position of an East Indian rajah to whom\r\nthe British government has assigned an “adviser,” and who if he should\r\nrefuse to profit by his “advice” would be quickly brought to book by the\r\nBritish military power. The theory then is, that the male officials are\r\nnot to be exactly subject to the female bosses or leaders who may become\r\ntheir monitors; but it is understood, of course, that they are likely to\r\nlisten respectfully to counselors, who though they may roar, look you,\r\nas gently as a sucking dove, will be backed by an earnest and somewhat\r\nexcitable and vociferous petticoated constituency. No doubt in order to\r\nget what they want, these ladies will soon find means of persuasion, of\r\nwhich the least urgent will consist of the process known to some\r\nunfortunate husbands as “nagging,” and to the derisive neighbors as\r\n“henpecking.” So, though the general superiority of the male\r\ngovernmental faculty is conceded, the male governing officials are not\r\nto be allowed to go on quite as they have been doing; the women will be\r\nthere to “advise.” In plain words the proposition is to henpeck the\r\npublic officials and other politicians into giving offices to the female\r\nbosslets, and into the adoption of their ladylike fads and frills. The\r\npicture in “Pinafore” of a high political dignitary on his official\r\nrounds with a squawking company of women at his heels, is to become\r\nactually embodied in American political life.\r\n\r\nThis suggestion of pressure upon government by harmless nagging and\r\nhenpecking is certainly shallow and unpractical, and is probably\r\ninsincere. If this is all that was intended, it was worse than folly to\r\nforce the general suffrage upon millions of reluctant women. Those women\r\nwho wished to nag and agitate were always at perfect liberty to do so.\r\nThey were always free to talk; and if they wanted to be clad with formal\r\nauthority to represent these few matters in which they claim a special\r\ninterest, that too could have been provided for; representative women\r\ncould have been elected or appointed to advisory boards or committees,\r\ncommissioned to present their views to the public officials in an\r\nauthoritative manner; leaving the latter to act in their discretion. But\r\nno; the suffragettes demanded, and are demanding, nothing less than a\r\nfull and equal share with men in actual government, with equal\r\nresponsibility for the results. The talk about women merely acting as\r\nadvisers or proposers is sham and nonsense. Under the new régime, the\r\nfemale spirit is to take possession equally with the male, of every part\r\nof the body politic, with the obvious result of dislodging half of the\r\nmasculine element in our governmental system. A vote cast by a woman is\r\nnot a mere suggestion; it is an act of government; once deposited in the\r\nurn, it counts equal to and effective with a man’s vote. And each\r\nwoman’s vote must either cancel or confirm the vote of some man. There\r\nis no logical or practical escape from this situation. Woman suffrage\r\ncan have no actual effect except such as involves a defeat of masculine\r\ngovernment; a nullification to some extent of what men are doing or have\r\ndone. If it is to operate in mere confirmation of the rules or decrees\r\nof man, it is unnecessary, and will be ineffectual; its only possible\r\neffect must be in contravention of man’s political control. It is either\r\nthis or nothing. As for womanly counsel, whatever of that was effective\r\nunder a male suffrage polity, will with woman suffrage established,\r\nnecessarily be replaced by female political coercion and intrigue. When\r\nmen are in supreme power, a deputation of benevolent ladies urging some\r\nremedial measure or charitable modification, is sure to receive\r\nconsideration from public officials; but what politician will be\r\nfoolish enough to give ear to non-political ladies offering mere womanly\r\ncounsel on any subject, when his female constituents are thundering at\r\nhis door with contrary demands, which they have the power to enforce by\r\npolitical methods? The effect of woman suffrage is thus to completely\r\ndestroy the political influence of all ladies who are not political\r\nworkers, and to replace it by the domination, meddling and intrigue of\r\nfemale politicians, who will speedily learn from the men to invent\r\nreforms with jobs attached, to swap political support for graft, and to\r\nmarket moral issues.\r\n\r\nConsider the unescapable facts, and note the silliness and fraud of the\r\npretence that the women in politics will be no more than gentle advisers\r\nto the men in certain matters. In the woman suffrage states women vote\r\nwith the men, and at the same elections, for president and\r\nvice-president of the United States; members of Congress, senators and\r\nrepresentatives; governors and other state officers; members of state\r\nlegislatures; mayors of cities; city and county officers, etc. etc. In\r\nevery election contest there are usually two principal candidates for\r\neach of the above offices; say a better fitted or superior candidate A\r\nand an inferior candidate B, the interest of the public being to select\r\nA. Now if the majority of each sex favors A he is elected, but to no\r\nmore purpose than he would have been without the woman vote. How then in\r\nthat first case, have the women aided or counselled the men? But if as\r\nwill certainly happen in most elections one of the candidates A or B is\r\ndefeated by the woman vote, what difference is there between the effect\r\nof each woman’s vote and that of each man’s? Can anyone say that the\r\nwomen merely counselled with the men, that they did not overrule them?\r\nIf a candidate is defeated by aid of the female vote who would not\r\notherwise have been defeated, are not the men overruled? The question is\r\nabsurd; as well say that the men merely advise the women, as that the\r\nwomen merely advise the men. The same reasoning applies to votes on\r\nlegislative proposals; the woman’s vote will in every case either\r\noverrule the majority male vote, or it will be totally ineffective.\r\nThere is absolutely no escape from the logic of the case.\r\n\r\nThe pretence that certain women have some secret and mysterious\r\nknowledge to impart to lawmakers and law administrators is preposterous.\r\nIt is the offspring of the conceited minds of some well-to-do idle\r\nfemale faddists, who want to get into public notice. Some of them\r\npretend that this private knowledge concerns factory girls, whose cause\r\nthey pretend to espouse, but who in fact hate and despise them and their\r\nofficious meddling. When working women have anything to say to public\r\nofficials, they can say so directly or hire a lawyer to do it for them,\r\nas the men do. Some of those busy bodies pretend that they have the\r\nsecret of the proper treatment of fallen women; but legislation will\r\nnever help these people; it has not needed the vote to enable most women\r\nto be cruel to them in the past, nor is the franchise needed to-day to\r\nqualify good women to be charitable to them or to any other human beings\r\nin the future. Truth is, that in the entire domain of sociology the\r\nfemale suffragists have nothing whatever to propose except what they\r\nhave borrowed from the socialists; and that we had already, and knew to\r\nbe worse than worthless. Their talk about superior ability to care for\r\nthe children is more prattle; one of the best feminist writers, Mrs.\r\nGilman, has called attention in strong and plain language to the record\r\nof notorious incapacity on the part of women in the care of children\r\n(_Women and Economics_). The best that a woman can do for her child when\r\nill is to take advice from the best available male physician. The\r\nadministration of foundling asylums, children’s hospitals and homes is\r\nsafer in the hands of men than in those of women. Most real reforms and\r\nimprovements in medicine, surgery, ventilation, diet, architecture,\r\ndrainage, plumbing, and other branches of hygiene and sanitation have\r\ncome and will come from the male intellect and will be and are best\r\nenforced by masculine administration.\r\n\r\nUnder the régime of universal suffrage it is safe to predict that the\r\n“Naggers” will have little influence in government. They will interest\r\nthemselves as the “Watch Dogs” do, and sometimes they will collide with\r\nthe “Watch Dogs,” whose ideal is to save public money, while that of the\r\n“Naggers” will be to spend it. Their sympathies will probably tend\r\ntowards the cranks, or “Yellow Dogs” of politics. They will very much\r\nenjoy meddling in all sorts of things of which they know nothing; and\r\nnow and then they will get something through, over which they will crow\r\nand chuckle. But the female masses will make but little response to\r\nindependent appeals of “Naggers,” “Watch Dogs” or other similar bands of\r\ninsurgents. They will be quite under the control of the machines of the\r\nrespective parties; their votes will be cast for the machine candidates;\r\nand so political ignorance and corruption doubly supported will flourish\r\nmore and more.\r\n\r\nTo conclude with the “henpeck” project; this notion of sending the weak\r\nand incompetent to hinder or modify the counsels of the strong and\r\ncapable on pretence of giving them advice, is one of the most foolish of\r\nmany foolish products of the untrained intellect. It is a childish\r\nsubterfuge of those who are ashamed to say outright that their fathers,\r\nhusbands and brothers are inferior in political capacity to their\r\nmothers and sisters. But that assertion is just what is implied in\r\nfemale suffrage, which by reducing by one half the value and force of\r\nthe ballot of each male voter, will have the actual effect of a moiety\r\ndisfranchisement of the men of the country.\r\n\r\nB. _Man-made law._ One of the silliest claims of the female suffrage\r\nagitators, is that they want political power, in order to repeal what\r\nthey flippantly call “man-made law.” As well sneer at man-made geology,\r\nman-made mathematics or man-made astronomy; man-made they are indeed,\r\nand so are all the arts and sciences, industries and philosophies. Of\r\nthe fact that law is a great science with its roots deep in the history\r\nof the past ages; of the immensity of the great body of the law, with\r\nits scores of divisions and branches, and hundreds of subdivisions,\r\nthese chatterers seem to have no suspicion. When they undertake to\r\nspecify the defects in the great juristic achievements of our law givers\r\npast and present, they point with scorn to two or three instances of\r\nancient British legislation affecting the family relation, which like\r\nall really useful and practical law represented the customs and ideals\r\nof the time. Those ideals have since been modified, and the law has been\r\nchanged accordingly; in one case for instance by a statute passed about\r\n1850 by which married women are permitted freely to dispose of their\r\nseparate property. But this measure, of which the suffragists always\r\nspeak as if they had put it through, was adopted upon the suggestion of\r\nmen long before women had any political power, and entirely without\r\ntheir aid. The results of that act have not been altogether happy; it is\r\nnothing to boast of specially; it was not a tribute to higher ideals,\r\nbut a concession to human weakness, and has enabled many a rascal to\r\ncheat his creditors by putting his property in his wife’s name. The old\r\ncommon law ideal was much the higher one; it conceived of the family as\r\na unit; and placed all its property in one common fund in the name of\r\nand under the guardianship of the husband, as the head and\r\nrepresentative of the house. Its motto was like that of the Three\r\nMusketeers, “One for all and all for one,” which is a much more noble\r\nand lofty conception, and much more likely to promote family happiness\r\nand family success, than any represented by the Woman’s Separate\r\nProperty Act, or by all that has been so far offered to the world by all\r\nthe women suffrage associations put together. Under the old common law,\r\na knave could not, as now, shelter himself from his creditors behind his\r\nwife’s skirts, and keep her and his family in base luxury while his\r\ntrusting creditors suffered.\r\n\r\nC. The legend “_No taxation without representation_” is one of the\r\nsuffragist catchwords. Just what is meant by this nobody knows; but if\r\nit be offered as a political maxim derived from our ancestors, the\r\nanswer is that they never understood or interpreted this saying as\r\njustifying woman suffrage, or any other right to vote than that of the\r\npropertied classes. By taxation, they meant direct taxation on tangible\r\nproperty; and as to representation, they considered that the women and\r\nchildren as a class were politically represented by their men. If,\r\nhowever, by this saying, “No taxation without representation,” the\r\nsuffragists mean that every taxpayer has a right to vote, that\r\nproposition has already been answered herein by the true doctrine that\r\nsuffrage is not a right at all, but a function of government, to be\r\nperformed by those classes whom the state may select as duly qualified.\r\nNor does taxation ever confer a right to vote; taxation is justified not\r\nby the franchise, but by the protection given by government to the taxed\r\nproperty; property owners pay the tax as a return for that protection;\r\nand therefore not only women but non-residents, resident aliens, and\r\nchildren owning property in the community are justly taxed, though not\r\nallowed to vote.\r\n\r\nD. _The maternity claim._ Some emotional women have actually made claim\r\nto the franchise based upon the merits and dangers of maternity. This is\r\nmere nonsense. If women are not competent to vote on public affairs,\r\ntheir votes will be injurious to the republic; and they cannot be\r\npermitted to do themselves and others an injury merely because they have\r\nborne children. It is not enough to mean well; the female turkey means\r\nwell by her chickens but she will often clumsily trample them to death\r\nif not prevented. To bear children is natural to women and is its own\r\ngreat reward; it is dangerous, but no more so than going to sea, and it\r\nis not proposed to give the vote to sailors to recompense them for their\r\nrisk. The suffrage is not a reward; it is a function and a trust.\r\n\r\nE. _That women have interests separate from that of men._ This is an\r\nabsurd proposition. The social and family ties and obligations of the\r\nsexes and their interests in public matters are identical. The very\r\nexistence of a woman implies the care and devotion of a father, and also\r\nthe ties of family interest, family life and family love, all of which\r\nare male as well as female. The sex difference is not as other\r\ndifferences are, a separating influence; it is a unifying impulse; it\r\nnot only unites but fuses the subjects of its action. In almost all\r\ninstances the prizes achieved by the individual man, riches, ambitions,\r\nand all the rest are shared to the utmost with his women. On the other\r\nhand women never think of sharing their lives or their incomes with\r\nstrangers of their sex, but always with those of their own family and\r\nblood, males as well as females, the preference if any being to the\r\nmales. But though under the present system the interests of men and\r\nwomen are made as far as possible identical, the tendency of feminism is\r\nto separate them, with a prospect of very ill results for women.\r\n\r\nF. _Man’s alleged unfairness to women._ To those who have not suffered\r\nthe annoyance of having to read suffragist literature, it will seem\r\nalmost incredible that even the most unscrupulous of its purveyors would\r\naccuse men of general unfairness to women. Nevertheless, they have done\r\nso repeatedly and the charge must therefore be noticed. Indeed it is\r\nwell that it should be given prominence, so that people may realize the\r\noffensive character of some of the incidents of the suffrage movement.\r\nWomen should always realize that they owe all they are and have to the\r\ngenerosity, love, foresight and ability of men. Most of the harridans\r\nand termagants, who in the suffrage agitation have displayed themselves\r\nas slanderers and insulters of men, were born and raised in houses built\r\nby men, fed and clad with material furnished by men, educated by books\r\nwritten by men, attended schools and colleges founded and maintained by\r\nmen, or with money earned by men, are cared for by male physicians, and\r\nare now either living on the income of money amassed by men, or are\r\nemployed by men, from whom they receive the salaries and instructions\r\nnecessary to enable them to earn a living.\r\n\r\nG. _That women’s wages in factories and stores are too low and should be\r\nhigher._ No voting or legislation can permanently augment the income or\r\ncomforts of any class of people, or increase women’s wages with any good\r\neffect. All wages seem low to the recipient and high to the employer.\r\nIncreased wages usually produce higher rent and higher cost of living;\r\nthe increased cost of living makes marriage and home life more\r\ndifficult, and from this women as well as men ultimately suffer. If\r\nwomen generally really believe that their incomes can be increased by\r\nvoting and legislation, that of itself proves their total unfitness to\r\nmeddle in government. But suppose that it were possible by legislation\r\nto materially increase the wages of factory women and store girls, what\r\nwould be the ultimate result to the community? A large increase in the\r\nnumber of women taken out of households and put into stores and factory\r\nlife. No intelligent person believes that this change would really be to\r\nthe advantage of women as a class, nor doubts that it would be the\r\nresult of artificially advancing wages of such women above their natural\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nH. _That women should be consulted on new legislation affecting marital\r\nrelations._ No such legislation is needed. The marriage status of a\r\ncouple is not to be regulated by law; it is controlled by social usage,\r\nby religion and by sentiment. The only really important legal provision\r\nis one dictated by nature and by custom, namely that the husband must\r\nsupport the family. This requirement necessarily involves the right of\r\nthe husband to seek and select his own vocation, and to choose the style\r\nand place of family residence. None of these arrangements can be\r\nmaterially modified without breaking up the family and the state. That\r\nto destroy the family and the state is the tendency of the feminist\r\nmovement no thinking man can doubt.\r\n\r\nSome of the suffragist agitators, pretending to be moved by a\r\nsentimental tenderness for the feelings of mothers, demand that the law\r\nbe changed so as to give the guardianship of children to the mother in\r\ncase of separation of parents. The law as it stands rightly provides\r\nthat the interests of the child in each particular case, and not the\r\nwhims or desires of the parents, are to be considered as paramount in\r\nsettling that matter. This is man-made law, and is much more humane and\r\njust than anything the suffragists have ever suggested.\r\n\r\nJ. _That women have special capacity for municipal government because it\r\nresembles housekeeping._ This argument is an unfortunate one for the\r\nsuffragists, for if there is one art in which most of them are\r\nnotoriously inefficient it is in housekeeping. But municipal government\r\nis a matter of administrative detail; of business methods combined with\r\nhighly developed specialized, practical science, and not at all like\r\nhousekeeping. As President Lowell says, “The City Government is\r\nessentially an administrative, not a legislative concern.” It is not,\r\ntherefore, a fit subject for political twaddle and sentimental vaporings\r\nsuch as the suffragists revel in. Nor should city officials be elected\r\nby the people under any system of suffrage. They should be appointive\r\nand not elective officials; carefully chosen experts; competent to deal\r\nwith matters of public health, protection against fire, liquor\r\nregulation, water supply, disposal of sewage, cleaning and maintenance\r\nof streets and bridges, wires and pipes in streets, public lighting,\r\nferries, rapid transit, erection and maintenance of public buildings,\r\nwharves and docks, public education, treatment of disease, pauperism and\r\ncrime, besides the levying assessment and collection of taxes and the\r\nfinancing of thousands and even millions of dollars yearly. Yet\r\nsuffragists talk of “housekeeping” in cities as if it were a matter of\r\ndusting the parlor furniture and laying the table for dinner. How many\r\nof them are capable of planning for the water supply, and the disposal\r\nof the sewage of a great city, for instance? Here are matters which\r\nrequire to be dealt with by men of practical knowledge and force of\r\ncharacter, and who have the wisdom derived from actual experience in\r\nfinance, engineering, sanitation, medicine, surgery, pedagogics and law.\r\nTo say that women as a class are equal or any way near equal to men in\r\nknowledge of these subjects or capacity to deal with them is absurd.\r\n\r\nK. _That many women have property of their own._ The point of this\r\nargument lies in the question, why not a property qualification for\r\nwomen as well as for men? The answer is, that as already stated in this\r\nvolume, the vote is not given to the property but to the property plus\r\nthe human owner, with his added endowment of experience acquired in its\r\nacquisition and care. It is proposed to limit the franchise to this\r\nclass of men, as on the whole best fitted to exercise it for the benefit\r\nof the state. In the case of women, the mere possession of property does\r\nnot, as in the case of men, carry with it a general presumption of\r\nbusiness experience and ability. The class of women who own property\r\nare, no doubt, better voting material than the propertyless women; but,\r\nas a class, they have had far less business and political training than\r\nthe propertied men. The great majority of propertied women are so merely\r\nby inheritance; and are but little more informed in business matters\r\nthan their servants. Their tastes and predilections do not as a rule\r\nextend beyond dress, society, music and household matters. Not having\r\nthemselves accumulated property, they do not understand property or\r\nbusiness rights, and their temperaments and circumstances forbid that\r\nthey shall ever understand them. Women passengers at sea have property\r\nand precious lives to be protected, yet they are never allowed even in\r\ndanger to interfere in the management of the ship. Nor do individual or\r\nexceptional cases matter. Legislation must be made to fit classes, not\r\nindividuals, and therefore references to George Eliot and Mme. Curie are\r\nunconvincing. Alexander Hamilton at eighteen was probably better\r\nqualified to vote than many actual voters, but that was no reason for\r\nchanging the law so as to allow youths to vote. A whole class of\r\nincompetents must not be let in merely to get a few intelligent votes.\r\nThe mere fact that so many women are willing that this should be done,\r\nproclaims a condition of egotistic stupidity and a lack of patriotism\r\nwhich is appalling. Propertied women should be content to let the\r\npropertied men vote for them for a reason similar to that which requires\r\nany one of them to give way to a physician’s orders in the case of a\r\nsick child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE IN PRACTICE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1918 women were first granted complete suffrage by the great\r\nState of New York. The result has not been such as to surprise any\r\nthinking man, but it must have astonished the many credulous ones who\r\nexpected political progress and reform from the fair hands of women, for\r\nit has been merely to strengthen the power of the bosses and political\r\nrings everywhere throughout the state. In New York City, where the\r\ndominant political machine is the Tammany Democratic organization, the\r\nTammany vote which in 1917 under manhood suffrage was 314,000 sprang in\r\n1918 to 547,000 and the Tammany majority was increased by over 100,000,\r\nreaching the high figure of 258,000. Fools build houses and wise men\r\nlive in them. The female suffrage edifice, so toilfully erected day by\r\nday for the past fifty years by the feverish and ambitious hands of\r\nshrill-voiced lady agitators, is now occupied by the Tammany Ring,\r\ncomposed of hard-headed and experienced men. When they vacate the\r\npremises it will be to give place to a rival machine. True, it is, that\r\nwomen are now received into the political party fold; but as servants,\r\nnot as masters. There is a female organization attachment, but it is\r\nstrictly of the old orthodox Tammany brand; the vociferous new women are\r\nsent to the rear, their voices must not be too loud, there is no place\r\nin party ranks for skirted faddists, nor for women who want to lead in a\r\n“cause” or “movement.” Silence and discipline are the rules in machine\r\norganizations. Tammany and the New York Republican organization have had\r\npublished a list of female associate leaders for each assembly district,\r\nabout thirty-five in all. The names of great female uplifters, the\r\nleaders, as they foolishly thought themselves, are absent from these\r\nrolls, where may be read the names of those whose husbands and brothers\r\nwill carefully transmit to them the orders from headquarters. Thus ends\r\nthe pipe dream of the suffragette “leaders” that they would some day\r\nwalk in, and take possession of the comfortable seats of the mighty. The\r\narrogant conceit of a bunch of foolish women, who imagined themselves to\r\nbe all-conquering, has received its quietus, and let us be grateful\r\naccordingly. Far better submit to the plunderings of the old rings, than\r\nto suffer from the antics and Bolshevism of the socialist suffragette\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nPassing New York, where the evil results of woman suffrage are only just\r\nbeginning to show themselves, let us look at Colorado, where it was\r\nadopted in 1892. In 1908 Helen Sumner went to that State to investigate\r\nthe results of fifteen years of female voting. She was favorable to the\r\ncause and her inquisition was backed by women. The results were\r\npublished by her in a book where she plainly endeavors to be impartial,\r\nnotwithstanding her evident suffragette affiliations. In the hope of\r\nlearning something of the moral effect of the franchise, she made\r\nthousands of inquiries, without eliciting anything favorable, except\r\nthat voting made women take more interest in politics than before. Miss\r\nSumner considered this an advantage and she puts it thus:\r\n\r\n“Thousands vote; and to every one of these thousands the ballot means a\r\nlittle broadening in the outlook, a little glimpse of wider interest\r\nthan pots and kettles, trivial scandal and bridge whist.” ... “A closer\r\ncompanionship and understanding between men and women.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the government of the country must be entrusted to people whose\r\nchief interests in life are pots and kettles, scandal, and bridge whist.\r\n“Poor things,” muses Miss Sumner, “they are so lonesome, and they take\r\nno interest in cooking; let them vote, it will divert their minds.”\r\nApparently she has no pity for the poor men folk, who must pay in high\r\ntaxes and indigestion the price of this diversion. But why stop at this\r\npoint; the merely going to vote will only give a woman a temporary jolt,\r\nscarcely equal to matching a ribbon at the store; why not give her\r\nsomething more exciting; why not pass a law permitting all women to\r\npractise medicine or to drive a locomotive, or to shoe horses? Only a\r\ncomparatively few would suffer, and it would give the dear women “a\r\nlittle glimpse of wider interest.” Or to be fair to both sexes, why not\r\nlet schoolboys vote; they too might like interesting “glimpses”; and\r\nthey would thus become accustomed to talk politics with mamma and\r\nsister; never mind the harm to the country, it is big and long\r\nsuffering. Now, when we consider that Miss Sumner is probably a very\r\nsuperior woman, and that as this extract shows, she has no idea whatever\r\nof the significance or dignity of the franchise, we may judge how far\r\nher less developed sisters are from being qualified for the exercise of\r\nthe vote.\r\n\r\nLet us consider for a moment what kind of “glimpses of interest and\r\ncompanionship” the Colorado women get by going into politics. Miss\r\nSumner’s inquiries did not lead her to believe that woman’s morals were\r\ninjured, or her affairs neglected as a consequence of the mere act of\r\nvoting. Perhaps not; that large class of either very docile or shrewd\r\nwomen, who march to the polls with husband or father, vote as he\r\ndirects, and quickly return with him, cannot be said to have suffered\r\nmuch direct harm in the process; nor indeed on the other hand to have\r\ngot many “glimpses of wider interest.” And yet, what of the indirect\r\nresults? Is it degrading or not to act a lie publicly and solemnly, to\r\ndeliberately trifle with country and conscience, as one does by voting\r\nfor people of whom he knows nothing, and for legislation which he does\r\nnot thoroughly understand? Is it nothing to trifle with a weighty\r\nobligation? When a citizen goes to the polls and votes, does he, or does\r\nhe not, in effect represent and declare, before God and his country,\r\nthat he has investigated the matter, and that his ballot represents his\r\nsolemn and true conviction? And if that declaration be false, if he has\r\nno solemn or true conviction on the subject, is he, or is he not,\r\nacting the part of a perjured rascal and traitor, and can his conscience\r\npass through that ordeal unscathed? Here is food for thought for many a\r\nmale voter and for nearly all the female voters.\r\n\r\nMiss Sumner learned out there, some interesting particulars of the\r\n“broadening in the outlook” and the new “companionship” which Colorado\r\nwomen get from exercising the suffrage; and the experience must have\r\nastonished some of the decent ones among them till they got used to it.\r\nHer book fairly reeks with the tainted atmosphere of female corruption;\r\nthe whole woman’s movement there was steeped in moral filth. Here are\r\nher own words (p. 258):\r\n\r\n     “Politics in Colorado are at least as corrupt as in other states,\r\n     and the woman of ideals who goes into political life for reform\r\n     soon finds, not merely that she is working in the mire, but that\r\n     she is _persona non grata_ with the habitual denizens of the mire\r\n     and with those persons who profit by its existence.”\r\n\r\nAmong the first fruits of woman suffrage in Colorado seems to have been\r\nthe development of a big batch of female criminals. In Arapahoe County\r\nin 1900 there were 5284 fraudulent registrations of voters of which 3512\r\nwere men and 1772 women. Seventeen hundred female criminals in one\r\ncounty! There must have been a considerable “broadening in the outlook”\r\nfor women theretofore accustomed to decent homes; and a “closer\r\ncompanionship” with rogues, and understanding of their devices was no\r\ndoubt arrived at. In fact Colorado has been said to be the most corrupt\r\nelectorate in the United States. Of its effects there United States\r\nJudge Hailett, a resident of the state, said, “if it were to be done\r\nover again the people of Colorado would defeat woman suffrage by an\r\noverwhelming majority.” It stands because politicians are cowards and\r\nunscrupulous, and Colorado like other states is ruled by politicians. It\r\nhas increased political corruption in the state. In 1905 about thirty\r\nmen were sent to jail in Denver and fined, and in Pueblo there were 257\r\nindictments, all for election frauds. It has not diminished political\r\nrowdyism. In an article in the _Outlook_ in January 1906, Lawrence\r\nLewis, who studied the subject for several years in Colorado, says that\r\nsince woman suffrage went into effect, there has been a continuation of\r\nthe former frauds, drunkenness, fights and arrests for crimes. Referring\r\nto the notorious election knaveries committed by both parties in\r\nNovember 1904, the second year of female voting, he says:\r\n\r\n     “In Denver neither in November 1904 nor for twenty years has there\r\n     been an election that decent citizens of either party would\r\n     unhesitatingly assert was anywhere near on the square.”\r\n\r\nHe further says, that in the cities such as Denver, Pueblo, etc., a\r\ngreat number of fallen women vote under the control of the bosses, often\r\nunder compulsion.\r\n\r\n     “It is safe to say that under ordinary conditions and under\r\n     ordinary police administration, ninety per cent of the fallen women\r\n     in our cities are compelled to register and to vote at least once\r\n     for the candidates favored by the police or sheriff officers. But\r\n     in ordinary times these women are also compelled to repeat.... A\r\n     former city detective or fine collector in Pueblo has been tried,\r\n     convicted and sentenced to a term of years in the penitentiary for\r\n     compelling an unfortunate woman to repeat her registration. He is\r\n     under further indictments for compelling the same woman to forge\r\n     fictitious names by the hundreds to district registration sheets,\r\n     all of which names were to be voted on election day by other fallen\r\n     women from whom the fellow collected fines.”\r\n\r\nOther similar instances are given by the writer in this same article.\r\nAnd he adds that:\r\n\r\n     “It would indeed appear that the average character of the actual\r\n     voting body has either remained unchanged or has been slightly\r\n     lowered as regards actual political intelligence and\r\n     discrimination.”\r\n\r\nAlso this:\r\n\r\n     “We have practically (in Colorado) all the forms of graft and\r\n     misgovernment found elsewhere. Woman’s suffrage seems to have been\r\n     neither a preventive, an alleviator, nor a cure for any of our\r\n     political ills.”\r\n\r\nOnly about one-third of the Colorado women actually vote, and a great\r\nmany of them flatly and indignantly refuse to do so. Referring to an\r\nelection in Colorado, 1910, Miss Seawell says:\r\n\r\n     “At the election in May, 1910, the sale of women’s votes was open\r\n     and shameless. At each of the 211 voting precincts in Denver, there\r\n     were four women working in the interests of the saloon-keepers.\r\n     These women had previously visited the headquarters of the\r\n     saloon-keepers and openly accepted each a ten dollar bill for her\r\n     services. In this and other ways Mr. Barry says he saw about\r\n     $17,000 paid to women voters, who apparently made no effort to\r\n     conceal it, as indeed it would have been useless.... Such wholesale\r\n     corruption has probably never been approximated in any city in the\r\n     United States.”\r\n\r\nRobert H. Fuller says that:\r\n\r\n     “Some of the worst election frauds ever perpetrated in this country\r\n     marked the Colorado election of 1904. The character and average\r\n     intelligence of the voting population, as a whole, have not\r\n     improved in the states where women vote; there has been no\r\n     improvement in the fitness or capacity of the elected public\r\n     officials.” (_Government by the People._)\r\n\r\nMiss Seawell says that in the election case of _Bonynge_ vs. _Shafroth_,\r\nin the First Congressional District of Colorado, containing the City of\r\nDenver (_Second Session of the Fifty-eighth Congress, H. R. report_ No.\r\n2705), it appeared that out of 9000 ballots in the boxes there were 6000\r\nfraudulent ones which had been prepared by three men and by one woman.\r\nOne woman poll clerk voted three times; forgeries were committed by the\r\nwomen; two women arranged to have a fight started so as to distract the\r\nattention of the watchers at the polls, while a third woman stuffed the\r\nballot-boxes. Because of this exposure, Shafroth resigned.\r\n\r\nMoral stimulus there certainly could be none in contact with this fraud\r\norganization which goes by the name of politics in Colorado. Of mental\r\nstimulus and “broadening in the outlook” thus to be miraculously\r\nachieved by the mere process of selecting one out of two scamps for\r\npublic office, Miss Sumner was reluctantly compelled to admit, that\r\nafter all in actual result she found but little. Few people were able to\r\ngive her any clear reason why they favored woman suffrage nor why they\r\nopposed it. It seems likely that all the mental stimulus the Colorado\r\nwomen ever got by entering the mire of politics, they could have\r\nobtained at less expense to their delicacy and good manners, by taking\r\npart in church fairs, golfing, gardening, playing base-ball, walking,\r\nlawn tennis, singing schools, literary societies, spelling bees,\r\nhorseback riding or dancing. And if some of the precious creatures must\r\nat any rate be kept amused while the rest of us work, it would be less\r\nexpensive to the state to provide these amusements at state charge than\r\nto permit them to divert their minds by playing with our national\r\nwelfare, and using poor old Uncle Sam as the object on which to try\r\ntheir various experiments in political quackery.\r\n\r\nGlancing over the New York _Evening Post_ of August 27, 1919, the writer\r\nwas interested to read that a young lady politician, convicted in 1916\r\nof a murder during a political quarrel at Thompson Falls, the victim\r\nbeing one Thomas, also a politician, had been paroled from the Montana\r\nState Penitentiary. It is reassuring to know that a suffragette\r\nmurderess actually risks three years confinement (softened no doubt by\r\nsympathy) in Montana, the first woman suffrage state, and the one who\r\ngave us our first lady “congressman.”\r\n\r\nThe plain truth is, that the entry of women into politics has brought no\r\npromise to the American people of any practical help in any of their\r\nreal problems. The whole movement bears the stamp of crudeness and\r\nmediocrity. Its ideals and operations have been low and its leaders\r\nlacking in every quality of greatness. Part of its success is no doubt\r\ndue to the love of novelty, and the inability in most minds to\r\ndistinguish what is really progress from what is merely blind or foolish\r\nexperiment. To many superficial people there is a fascination attached\r\nto everything which smacks of revolution; because in the past an\r\noccasional revolt has been justified, they think it is heroic and noble\r\nto take part in any political rumpus. But nothing either noble or heroic\r\nwas ever in or behind the woman suffrage movement, or has ever come out\r\nof it. The really great political agitations have all produced something\r\nworth while, in orators, leaders or authorship; see, for example, the\r\nchronicles of the American Revolution or the abolition movement; even\r\nthe French Revolution, in its compass from Rousseau to Napoleon, evolved\r\nsome greatness to offset the mass of rubbish and infamy which it vomited\r\nforth. Its political incapables though unfit for any good constructive\r\nwork were at least able to talk and write with effect; they drew\r\nattractive political pictures and proposals, and could promise and\r\nspeculate in a way to arouse interest. Not so the suffragists. Among\r\npolitical agitators they stand supreme for dullness and stupidity.\r\nLooking at their literature one is immediately struck by its cheapness,\r\nby its utter lack of noble and patriotic sentiments, by the lack of\r\nappeal to broad and elevating motives. We have had thousands of\r\nsuffragist speeches, and tons of printed literature, and after all, what\r\nhave they or what has their movement offered to the nation or to the\r\nworld? Nothing, absolutely nothing. The movement has not produced one\r\nidea worthy of the consideration of a well-educated and sensible man; it\r\nhas apparently been motived by vanity, love of notoriety and power, and\r\ncharacterized by hysteria; the proposals advanced have been pilfered\r\nfrom socialists and other fanatics; the oratory and literature of the\r\nsuffragists is characterized by flippant insincerity and\r\nunscrupulousness; progressive legislation in which they had no\r\nperceptible part is boldly claimed as their work; their leaders often\r\ndisplay dense ignorance of the political history of the country, and a\r\nsad lack of capacity to understand sound political principles or to\r\nsympathize with anything beyond the popular smartness of the hour. The\r\npersonnel of their leaders has been commonplace and uninteresting. Some\r\nof them have been sincere fanatics; most of them are political\r\nadventuresses. Dr. C. L. Dana says of the movement: “It is adopted as a\r\nkind of religion, a holy cult of self and sex, expressed by a passion to\r\nget what they want. There is no program, no promise, only ecstatic\r\nassertions that they ought to have it and must have it, and of the\r\nwonders that will follow its possession.... Measured by fair rules of\r\nintelligence testing, I should say that the average zealot in the cause\r\nhas about the mental age of eleven.” (_Letter to Miss Chittenden._)\r\nDuring the war with Germany the patriotism of many of the leaders was\r\ndoubtful, and their associates suspicious. And during the progress of\r\nthe whole agitation, there has been no suggestion of any effort to be\r\nmade by those women or their followers to stop political graft or\r\ncorruption, or to raise the standard of politics or of legislation. They\r\nhave had the vote at two annual elections in the great state of New\r\nYork; what do they offer there? Nothing. Who are their standard bearers\r\nand who has benefited by their vote? The most notorious boss and the\r\nmost noted and powerful political machine in the world.\r\n\r\nThe strongest proof, however, of the utter unworthiness of the cause of\r\nfemale suffrage and the meanness of its motives is furnished by the\r\npublic declarations of its female advocates. Many of these addresses are\r\nflavored with half contemptuous, half vicious and altogether impudent\r\nand vile sneers at men, and assertions of masculine inferiority, which\r\ncould not have been readily displayed but by those familiar with\r\nhouseholds whose men habitually receive at home but scant respect. Those\r\nscoffs at men are accompanied by a great show of half hysterical, all\r\ngushing, admiration for the mystic excellences of contemporary women,\r\nand of contempt for those of the last generation; in fact these female\r\nreform leaders usually assume a top-lofty attitude of disdain for our\r\nancestors generally, their work and their ideals. Each of them is of\r\ncourse filled with wonder at her own superior wisdom. One cannot help\r\nsuspecting that most of this display of crudity and egotism is due to\r\nthe fact that much of the suffragist work was done by newly fledged\r\ngraduates of female colleges, where uppish young women, largely of the\r\ntype who dislike home duties, or sometimes it is feared work of any\r\nkind, are sent by their parents either to get rid of them for a while,\r\nor because it is the thing to do, or to fit them for teaching. As from\r\nthe college president down, nothing of actual life is known, or ever was\r\nknown, within the college walls, where everything needed, buildings,\r\nendowments, salaries, books, instruments and sustenance, is provided by\r\nsomeone else, one can readily imagine the quality of the stuff expounded\r\nin these places under the pretence of instruction in sociology, politics\r\nand economics, and greedily swallowed by the extremely silly and\r\nconceited undergraduates. On leaving college, the best or most fortunate\r\nof these girls, aided by good luck or guided by wise parents, go to work\r\nat some useful occupation, and begin to get real lessons in life\r\nfollowed usually by still higher instruction as wives and mothers later\r\non. Of the lazy, rattle-brained, and otherwise good for nothing, a\r\ncertain percentage find their way every year into the field of female\r\nsuffrage agitation. Some scraps of knowledge they have picked up in the\r\nclass-room, the value of which they enormously exaggerate in their own\r\nminds, and give themselves intellectual airs in consequence. Many of\r\nthem lack sense or judgment sufficient to enable them to appreciate the\r\nimmense importance of the business world, the great mental capacity\r\nrequired in dealing with problems of commerce, manufacturing and\r\nfinance, and feel a certain contempt for business people who take no\r\npart in the literary and artistic patter of the day, or who lack taste\r\nfor trashy new poetry and rubbishy modern novels. The participation of\r\nthis class in the “movement” is prompted partly by morbid desire to\r\nassociate with men; and partly by vanity and a longing for notoriety,\r\nand for opportunity to display their own imagined powers. Fools, being\r\nafraid of no social or political problems, walk in where angels fear to\r\ntread; and it is no unusual thing to see charming and prudent women\r\nreduced to meek silence by these female blatherskites, with their\r\nirrelevant harangues about primitive men, cave dwellers, man-made law,\r\ndual-sexed insects and female spiders who devour their mates. If the\r\nreader doubts that such have been of the class of female suffrage\r\ndeliverances it will be because he has been fortunate enough not to have\r\nheard many of them.\r\n\r\nPart of the success of the woman suffrage agitation is due to the use of\r\nmoney. Just as the accumulations of the rich are often poured by their\r\nsons into channels of profligate folly, so by their widows and daughters\r\nthey are often turned into ditches of political folly. In countries like\r\nEngland and the United States, where large and small fortunes are\r\nconstantly being accumulated by hard-working men, and large portions\r\nthereof bequeathed to female relatives, there will always be found a\r\ncertain proportion of the latter who lack the wisdom to properly use\r\ntheir surplus cash; some waste it shamefully; some lose it to sharpers;\r\nsome bestow it upon worthless and sham benevolences; some squander it to\r\ngain notoriety. One can scarcely imagine any “cause” or “movement” so\r\nabsurd that, people cannot be found to believe in it, or to pretend to\r\ndo so, and to subscribe to it if properly approached and tempted by\r\nvisions of celebrity. For the woman suffrage agitation sums aggregating\r\nvery considerable have been thus secured in England and America. With\r\nthis cash a number of poorer women can be employed to do propaganda work\r\nand to perpetrate acts of lawlessness. In England they assaulted cabinet\r\nofficials and others; they used dynamite, they smashed windows, they\r\nbroke up public meetings by violence, they practised rowdyism and\r\nblackguardism, they attempted even murder. Here, they have allied\r\nthemselves with anarchists and socialists, enemies of the republic; they\r\nhave lawlessly interrupted public meetings; they publicly affronted the\r\nPresident at the Arlington Hotel on April 15th, 1910, a thing never\r\nbefore done in the history of the country; and they subsequently\r\ninsulted another President, by picketing the White House in an offensive\r\nmanner for weeks together. They justify this by saying that they were in\r\nearnest, and ready to suffer for the cause; and the same has been said\r\nby other fanatical criminals. Their course has been such as would have\r\ndiscredited even a good cause in any field but that of politics, where\r\nvile and dastardly methods are customary and considered appropriate.\r\n\r\nUp to a few years ago the politicians were accustomed to ridicule the\r\nwoman suffrage agitation, and for years made it a standing joke at the\r\nvarious state capitols; thus it was formerly the well known practice of\r\nthe New York state legislators to deceive and humbug the woman suffrage\r\nmanagers by passing one of their measures in one house, with the\r\nunderstanding that it would be defeated in the other. But as soon as the\r\nmovement began to make real headway, the politicians began to favor it,\r\nseeing the chance of advantage to themselves from that course. The only\r\nopinion those gentry fear or respect is that backed by organized force\r\nor easy money. The suffragists organized and raised immense amounts of\r\ncash; their opponents failed to do either and almost ignored the\r\nmovement. Now, reasoned the politicians, should the suffrage proposals\r\nfail nothing will be lost by having supported them; and should they\r\nsucceed we will have a still more credulous, corrupt and easily managed\r\nconstituency than before, and may hope for the gratitude and friendship\r\nof the suffrage leaders. And now that in sixteen states women have the\r\nvote, the politicians on both sides strongly favor woman suffrage, and\r\nare one and all ready to swear everlasting devotion to the cause of\r\nwoman. The presidential aspirants dare no longer oppose it. So that\r\njudging the future by the past, the cause of woman suffrage has a fair\r\nchance of winning in all or most of the states of the Union. It\r\ncertainly will do so unless there be a strong organized effort to defeat\r\nits progress, of which at present no signs are visible. In the political\r\nworld the most powerful forces are money and fanaticism. The effect of\r\nmoney is familiar to us all every day. The effect of fanaticism is\r\nequally familiar to readers of history. It produced the Mohammedan\r\nEmpire, the Crusades, and the Spanish Inquisition, and assisted in the\r\ndownfall of Spain; it furthered the Mormon political sway; the violent\r\nabolition of slavery; the prohibition movement; the woman suffrage\r\nagitation and Bolshevism. That female suffrage is the last important\r\nstep in the downward march of the American democracy is the belief of\r\nthe writer of this book. If at this point the reaction does not begin,\r\nthe democratic régime in this country is doomed to final failure, and\r\neven to possible overthrow at the hands of red radicalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n     A PROPERLY QUALIFIED ELECTORATE WILL REMOVE THE CAUSES OF THE\r\n     PREVALENT POPULAR DISSATISFACTION AND SERVE AS A DEFENSE AGAINST\r\n     THE PRESENT MENACE OF BOLSHEVISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe institution of unlimited suffrage is favorable to the various\r\nradical, anti-social movements which for convenience sake may here be\r\nconjointly designated as Bolshevism. It is thus favorable in three\r\nimportant particulars, one being a matter of principle and the two\r\nothers matters of practice. The error in principle is the adoption of\r\nthe theory of numbers as the sole source of political authority, in\r\ndirect disregard of the just claims of property and property rights, and\r\nresultingly to the detriment of efficiency, justice and civilization.\r\nThat the scheme of government by mere numbers is Bolshevik in character\r\nis plain enough. It had its origin in the French Terror which was a\r\nBolshevik regime. It accords no direct representation or place in\r\ngovernment to property or the rights of property; which are left to take\r\ntheir chance in the shuffle of politics. As long as property is deprived\r\nof its proper place in the constitution of our government and is denied\r\nrepresentation in the electorate, it is an alien, without security for\r\nits existence; and only here by sufferance. Bolshevism, which actually\r\ndeprives private property of all right to exist, goes further than\r\nunlimited suffrage which merely ignores it, but both are upon the same\r\ntrack, and move in the same direction. The second particular in which\r\nmanhood suffrage has favored Bolshevism is by corrupting and degrading\r\nthe operations of American democracy and bringing into disrepute as has\r\nbeen shown. And third, it has aided Bolshevism by admitting an\r\nanti-social element into the electorate and thus decreasing the\r\noffensive and defensive power of the democratic régime, as has also\r\nbeen shown.\r\n\r\nAnd now that we are under the menace of Bolshevism, let us for one\r\nmoment consider the extent and the character of that menace. It has\r\nseized a large part of Russia; it has found a lodging in Germany,\r\nFrance, Italy, Spain and the United States, and threatens every\r\ndemocratic nation where democracy is inefficient. It is an organized and\r\nwidespread attempt at the destruction of property and of all who own\r\nproperty; of society and civilization and of all who support society and\r\ncivilization. It is not a new or a momentary phenomenon. Though\r\noperating under new names it is as old and persistent as ignorance and\r\nbrutality. Over five centuries ago it appeared in England in Wat Tyler’s\r\ninsurrection identical in spirit with the French Revolutionary Terror\r\nwhich from 1789 to 1798 ravaged France and has been the source of nearly\r\nall her subsequent misfortunes. By its violent actions and reactions it\r\nbecame the indirect yet certain cause of the despotic rule and constant\r\nwars of the time of Napoleon I. and of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870,\r\nwhich left France again almost ruined; and it reappeared in the horrors\r\nof the Paris commune in 1871. Let not the reader of moderate means and\r\nlarge selfishness solace himself with the thought that, should it obtain\r\nhere, though our great capitalists may suffer, he will escape. The\r\nfinish of capitalists is the end of capital; and the end of capital is\r\nthe finish of us all. And the reader’s interest in this matter measured\r\nby the extent of his personal peril is probably nearly equal to that of\r\nany of his richer neighbors. In France in 1793 the Terrorists spared no\r\none who was respectable. The only safety was to go in rags or to join\r\nthe revolutionary army. People were slain because they were clergymen or\r\nnuns; because they were prosperous; because their friends were\r\nprosperous; because they were conservative in opinion or well dressed;\r\nbecause they were religious; because they were suspected of any of these\r\nthings. Some of the Reds of that day were planning to butcher half of\r\nFrance, when stopped by Napoleon’s timely usurpation. The Bolsheviki of\r\ntoday are if possible more ignorant, cruel, brutal and murderous than\r\nthe French radicals of a century ago. It is their declared intention to\r\ndo away with all but the laboring classes, who they say should alone\r\nenjoy the fruits of the earth. They repudiate all private property\r\nrights, and consider property owners, great and small, as public\r\nenemies. The right to own and hold private property is therefore now\r\nopenly and fiercely challenged throughout the world, and the challenge\r\nmust be accepted just as Germany’s challenge was accepted. The entire\r\nstructure of our civilization is endangered by this attack. Without\r\nprivate property neither the home nor the family can exist; when private\r\nproperty is abolished chaos will come again.\r\n\r\nBolshevism has obtained a lodgment in the United States. We must\r\ndisabuse our minds of the notion that this is a foreign menace which can\r\nbe got rid of by deporting a hundred or a few hundred aliens a year.\r\nBolshevism is a theory; a state of mind likely to appear in any race of\r\npeople under certain circumstances. The so-called Independent Workers of\r\nthe World (I.W.W.s) are largely native Americans. Under the present or\r\nany other social system including the ownership of private property, the\r\ncapable, saving and industrious will have, and the others will lack; and\r\nas those who lack are frequently deficient in morals and judgment as\r\nwell as in prudence and industry, there will be envy, covetousness and\r\ndiscontent; which being joined to a profound ignorance of economic law,\r\nwill produce Bolshevism. All these elements are here in America, where\r\nthe enemies of society have sometimes shown themselves in force, even in\r\nthe last century; for instance, in Shay’s rebellion in Massachusetts in\r\nthe year 1790. Heretofore, their numbers have been small, owing to our\r\npeculiar circumstances, notably our immense land offerings to all\r\ncorners; but times have changed, and American Bolshevism is here under\r\nconditions which make it a serious menace.\r\n\r\nLet not the reader fool himself with the prophecy that the spirit of\r\nBolshevism will disappear from Europe with the advent of spelling books\r\nand newspapers into the homes of European laborers, artisans and\r\npeasants. Quite the contrary. As well expect good family morals to come\r\nfrom reading obscene literature, as expect good business or political\r\nprinciples to issue from most of the rubbish printed by the decadents of\r\ntoday. The Bolshevik leaders are often literary men. It is not the lack\r\nof spelling and reading, but the want of sound economic principles that\r\ncharacterizes the assassins of Society; and the only school which\r\nprovides popular instruction in true economics is the school of\r\nbusiness, which Bolshevism is determined utterly to destroy.\r\n\r\nNeither must we count on Bolshevism dying out of itself here, for lack\r\nof congenial soil or atmosphere. People love to imagine miracles, and we\r\nhear a lot of nonsense about America’s wonderful power of assimilating\r\nforeigners; as if there was some marvelous quality in our air to change\r\nthe ideas and disperse the prejudices of immigrants. The fact is, that\r\nmany of the so-called American qualities are merely such human\r\ncharacteristics as develop everywhere under conditions of well-repaid\r\nindustry. The acquisition of property operates very quickly in every\r\ncountry, to modify the habits and character of any man previously poor;\r\nand the real cause of the personal changes referred to under the phrase\r\n“national assimilation” is material prosperity. In this new and open\r\ncountry, just as in Australia and South America, there has been great\r\nopportunity to turn energy into cash; and the foreigners whom we readily\r\nassimilated were those who made money, and became very like prosperous\r\nAmericans. They have been educated in the business school, and they will\r\nnever be Bolshevists. But the class of immigrants who remain paupers\r\nwill not be so easily converted to a doctrine which offers them nothing;\r\nand they will find leaders in the group which, though acquainted with\r\nbooks, is inefficient in business, unsuccessful and discontented. And\r\nthe pauperized, defeated, shiftless classes of Americans are likely to\r\nturn to Bolshevism, for the same reasons as foreigners under the same\r\ncircumstances. Men who are failures in life, no matter what their\r\nnationality, are not to be trusted to do justice to the successful ones,\r\nnor to vote to protect property or property rights. Wherever the\r\nprinciples of political economy are not understood, there is a field for\r\nBolshevism; and they are not understood by the working classes in the\r\nUnited States. The propaganda of organized discontent is very active\r\namong us; and its activities are not likely to diminish. Thousands of\r\nAmericans, disappointed in life, are also disappointed at seeing their\r\ngovernment in the clutches of an oligarchy of sordid politicians. And\r\nthese conditions may grow worse with the growth and expansion of\r\nindustry and commerce, with the increase of legislative meddling with\r\nbusiness, and the increasing tendency of business acting in\r\nself-protection to endeavor to improperly control legislation and\r\npolitics. If nothing be done to remedy this state of things who knows\r\nhow many Americans will be found to be on the side of the Bolsheviki\r\nwhen the time comes for a settlement of the question between us and\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThere is cause for a serious apprehension of an attack by organized\r\nBolshevism upon our democracy if proper measures are not adopted to\r\nfurther protect property rights, and if the present political\r\noligarchical misgovernment is permitted to continue unchecked. In that\r\nday it may be that in the large cities the enemies of the social order\r\nwill be championed by one or two yellow newspapers, and their cause be\r\ntaken up by one of the political organizations. The result might be such\r\nas to make the property classes regret their apathy. The material for an\r\nefficient radical political army already exists in the organized\r\ncontrollables who now manage the primaries under direction of the\r\nbosses; in the politically unattached hordes of irresponsible city\r\nvoters; in the village loafers; in the immense number of irresponsible\r\nwomen politically and economically ignorant and easily moved to violent\r\nemotion. There are at this moment in every city in the United States\r\nhundreds of writers, school teachers, and college educated youths of\r\nboth sexes, superficial, fluent of speech, ambitious, ready for\r\nanything; and as ignorant of economic law as a common laborer. Of such\r\nwould be the leaders of the Bolsheviki movement. On the other hand the\r\nable youth of America, the well-educated, gifted young business men,\r\nthose of high ideals, patriotic, disinterested, energetic; those of the\r\nclass upon whom every country should rely for its working leadership in\r\ncivics, are mostly unavailable to defend society in such an emergency,\r\nbecause they are untrained in public affairs, unknown to the public;\r\nhave been kept in the rear out of sight; not permitted to seek public\r\nemployment; the places they ought to fill occupied by the cheap tools of\r\nthe machine; most of them indifferent to politics; despising its\r\nincidents; scarcely willing to vote. From them no quick help could be\r\nexpected in such a case.\r\n\r\nAs for the political oligarchical managers at present in power, from\r\nthem no aid can ever be expected in any good cause. They are mere\r\ntime-servers. In fact the politician is the natural enemy of the\r\npropertied and capitalistic class. Already, there are plain indications\r\nthat the universal suffrage governing oligarchy stands ready to\r\nsacrifice American property rights. For example, the Vice President of\r\nthe United States once said in a public speech in the hearing of the\r\nwriter that there is no natural right in children to inherit from their\r\nparents. Here is a glimpse of a politician’s heaven; where all the\r\nproperty in this country will be at the behest of these organized\r\nbrigands. In fact, a step in the direction of confiscation of private\r\nproperty has already been taken, both here and in England, by the\r\nenactment of the lately invented Inheritance Tax Laws. Consider how that\r\nso-called tax can be made a ready means of Mexicanizing the nation by\r\nconfiscating a large part of its accumulated capital, and by destroying\r\nat the same time much of the incentive to future accumulations. A nation\r\nwhich is supported by inheritance taxes is like a spendthrift living off\r\nhis capital whose ultimate ruin is therefore sure. Let a large fortune\r\npass three times through the Probate Court, which might easily happen in\r\ntwenty years, and about half of it is gone in taxes, to be dissipated,\r\nsquandered and stolen by politicians. The taste of blood is good to a\r\nhungry beast. After despoiling large fortunes they are already beginning\r\nto attack smaller ones. A full treasury encourages waste, and so it goes\r\non. How many of the ne’er do wells whom universal suffrage calls to the\r\npolls, are aware or could possibly be made to realize, the value of\r\nstored up capital, or to understand that the accumulations of money\r\ncalled private fortunes which are thus being broken up and wasted, are\r\nthe only sources from which enterprise is daily being fed, and millions\r\nof workmen and workwomen employed and paid?\r\n\r\nUnder a universal suffrage régime, government leadership in opposition\r\nto Bolshevism cannot be relied upon, and without such leadership it is\r\ndoubtful if proper resistance to Bolshevism can be expected at the hands\r\nof the American people. They are utterly destitute of political power,\r\nare without organization and guidance or the material for either. They\r\nhave never been able to effectually resist the bosses; politically they\r\nare a lot of sheep, accustomed to say “baa” and to follow the old bell\r\nwethers. It is probable that any party organization having control of\r\nthe election and governmental machinery could speedily, if it chose, put\r\nthe proletariat in possession of the government of the manufacturing\r\nstates, such as New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Illinois. In\r\ncase of government ownership of transportation and intelligence\r\nutilities, the party in power might, in aid of this purpose, get control\r\nof a couple of million additional votes. After that, who knows what\r\nnext? It might then be too late for us to throw off the yoke; like the\r\nFrench of 1793, like the Russians of today, we might find ourselves a\r\nsubjugated people. People say that in the end truth and justice must\r\ntriumph; but that phrase “in the end” is portentous. The end of\r\nBolshevism might be delayed for a half century of wasteful struggle,\r\nwherein the immediate generation and most of its belongings would\r\nprobably perish.\r\n\r\nTo successfully meet the Bolshevist attacks whether made by propaganda\r\nor violence, we should thoroughly cleanse our politics and restore our\r\ngovernment to its original high place in the respect of the people. It\r\nwas said in our first chapter that the American democracy has not\r\nfulfilled its early promise of creating a government popular in the\r\nsense of good and economical public service. Had the political record of\r\nthe first forty years of the Republic been equalled by that of the\r\nfollowing ninety, it is possible that our example would have saved the\r\nworld from organized Bolshevism. We may choose to shut our eyes to the\r\nstory of corruption and inefficiency outlined in the foregoing pages,\r\nbut the rest of the world has not failed to read it and to comment on\r\nit. Large numbers of the discontented classes of Europe have interpreted\r\nthat dismal chronicle to mean the failure of democracy, and have turned\r\nto red radicalism. It is notorious that the principal leaders of Russian\r\nBolshevism are native Russians who have lived in America; and the\r\naccounts of the falling off of democracy within this country, which were\r\ncarried back home by them, and by thousands of their countrymen here, no\r\ndoubt featured largely in the spread of Bolshevik doctrines there. They\r\nhad heard the praises of American democracy trumpeted abroad, and they\r\ncame here to see and take part in its perfect work; they found the\r\ncountry in the hands of sordid, corrupt and inefficient politicians, and\r\nthey turned from democracy in despair. Seeing the misuse of money in our\r\npolitics, they decided that the power of money should be abolished\r\naltogether. Like ourselves, they overlooked completely the fact that the\r\nreal cause of the diseased condition of our American political life is\r\nnot the purchasing power of money, but the existence of a purchasable\r\nelectorate. Recently a man wrote to a New York daily paper, urging that\r\nthe way to win immigrants to love America, was to teach them the lessons\r\nof patriotism found in American history. This patriotic writer only\r\nthought of history as found in the school treatises, and utterly\r\nignored the fact that these immigrants are actually learning\r\ncontemporary American history every day from our newspapers. He wanted\r\nthem, he said, to be told of Washington, Franklin and Robert Morris. But\r\nthe immigrant soon learns that not only are those great men dead, but\r\nthat their successors in power are and are likely to continue to be, a\r\nlot of ignorant, greedy and unscrupulous modern politicians. As well\r\ntell the modern Greek to be satisfied with political rascality there,\r\nbecause Aristides the Just lived in Athens thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nNo one can doubt that a similar feeling of political disappointment with\r\nthe workings of our government, of hatred and contempt for our oligarchy\r\nof politicians, of want of faith in the honesty, integrity, ability and\r\nearnestness of those in power, is largely responsible for the progress\r\nof American socialism, for other organized protests against the\r\ndemocratic system and for that phenomenon frequently referred to as\r\n“popular unrest.”\r\n\r\nElihu Root in the _North American Review_ for December, 1919, refers to\r\nRoosevelt, when president about twelve years ago, as recognizing the\r\nexistence of this popular dissatisfaction, that “a steadily certainly\r\ngrowing discontent was making its way among the people of our country”\r\nand that millions were “then beginning to feel that our free\r\ninstitutions were failing.” But Roosevelt was too much of a politician\r\nhimself to dare to touch the real sore spot, or to propose to cut out\r\nthe cancer, and neither Root nor Roosevelt, nor any other noted\r\npolitician has assigned any adequate cause for the unrest of these\r\ntimes. The fact is that the public has come to despise in its heart a\r\npolitical system in which weakness and rascality are so prominent.\r\nRoosevelt went up and down, says Root, making frantic appeals for\r\nobedience to law. The American people, of whom there are millions just\r\nas honest and common-senseful as Roosevelt, know that the law must be\r\nobeyed as a practical rule of business; but they refuse to implicitly\r\nbelieve in the wisdom, honesty or sanctity of statutes and ordinances\r\npromulgated by an oligarchy of place-hunting politicians. There is no\r\nsubstantial difference between the attitude towards this oligarchy taken\r\nby the thrifty honest working class and that of the honest mercantile or\r\nprofessional class; they are all dissatisfied with our governmental\r\nsystem for the same reason; namely, because it is morally and\r\nintellectually unworthy of the American people. Jealousy of great\r\nfortunes has been mentioned as a possible cause of the popular\r\ndiscontent. But the bulk of the American people are not so meanly and\r\nstupidly envious as that suggestion would imply. They are no more\r\ninclined to envy a man his honestly acquired wealth than his superior\r\nhealth, strength, musical talent or the acquisition of a foreign\r\nlanguage. The honest rich live plainly; they work hard and they give\r\nmunificently and wisely; they are not in power; the people know it and\r\nwould much prefer them to the ruling horde which now afflicts us.\r\nRoosevelt himself was in the eyes of the masses a rich man, but he was\r\nvery popular and all the more so because he was known to be pecuniarily\r\nindependent. The cause of the public dissatisfaction is not the doings\r\nof the rich, but the misdoings of the grafting politicians. The latter\r\ngo about wondering at the cause of what they call “unrest,” when they\r\nthemselves are that cause. The intelligent workers of modest incomes,\r\nfarmers, mechanics, traders, professional men, clerks, etc., see with\r\ntheir own eyes a lot of ignorant, sordid knaves obtain undeserved public\r\noffices and honors and graft themselves into wealth, and they partly\r\nenvy and completely dislike and despise the whole lot. Thence it follows\r\nthat transactions between the politicians and business men of all kinds\r\nbecome distrusted by the public, who are ready to suspect all railroad\r\nand other corporations, all importing and manufacturing interests which\r\nare affected by legislation or governmental action, whether tariff,\r\ntaxation, rate regulation or otherwise, of bribery, fraud and corruption\r\nin all transactions with government or wherein government officials are\r\nconcerned. The people are also dissatisfied because the office-holding\r\nclass is weak and lacking in dignity and firmness. The attitude of a\r\npublic official with his ear to the ground is low and brings him into\r\ncontempt. The public finds too much smartness and cleverness and too\r\nlittle manly pride and directness in our machine-made rulers. They find\r\nthat they lack courage to do affirmative justice with due speed; that\r\nthey are able to do nothing without first being assured of a majority at\r\ntheir backs. Their decisions are governed not by the application of\r\nprinciples but by a process of additions and subtractions; they are not\r\nleaders of the people but followers of the rabble. And this slavish\r\ncowardice has been increased since the votes of women are being sought\r\nby new forms of pandering. If we want the people to respect and love the\r\ngovernment we must give them one worthy of respect and love. To ensure\r\nthe loyalty and devotion of the immigrant as well as of the native, we\r\nmust make our political institutions as nearly perfect as possible; we\r\nmust offer for the support of the American people a government like that\r\nof the Fathers; pure, patriotic and efficient, one that can command\r\nrespect as well as enforce obedience.\r\n\r\nWe have reaffirmed our belief in democracy as a method of government and\r\nhave asked the rest of the world to accept it, and we are therefore\r\ncalled upon to point to a method for its practical operation. The only\r\nmethod heretofore found practical, the only one we are prepared to\r\noffer, is representative government. Unless that system can be made to\r\nwork well the experiment of democracy will have been a practical\r\nfailure. We are bound to see to it that this does not happen, that\r\nrepresentative government be made a working success, that it operate\r\nwith justice, efficiency, economy and humanity. That it has not\r\nheretofore operated here or in any part of the world with anything near\r\nperfect satisfaction is admitted by its strongest supporters. The\r\nfriends of democracy are therefore called upon to correct the situation;\r\nin the slang of the day, “it is up to us to make good.” This is a part\r\nof the national and world work which we Americans have undertaken; it is\r\na continuation of the enterprise of making the world “safe for\r\ndemocracy.” Should it fail hereafter it will be as though it had failed\r\nin the German war, and the world would be left to Autocracy, Socialism\r\nand Bolshevism to divide between them. It is the claim of the enemies of\r\nrepresentative democracy, who are numerous, and many of them very\r\nintelligent, that it never can be made successful; that it has failed\r\nnot only in France, Italy, Spain and Greece but in Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States; and that its failure is due to lack of quality in the\r\nelectorate, that is to say, in the mass of the population. And these\r\ncritics are no doubt so far right, that whatever may be the practical\r\nshortcomings of the system of representative government they are due to\r\nthat very cause. Therefore, it is plainly our business to make\r\nrepresentative government a success by the only method practicable or\r\npossible, namely, by a reform, elevation and purification of the\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\nOur second step in the way of preparation to meet the menace of\r\nBolshevism is to take a definite stand for property rights, based upon\r\nthe plain doctrine that our government is designed and intended to\r\nprotect American civilization expressed as all civilization is\r\nexpressed, in terms of property. If we did not believe that, if it were\r\nnot true, then we might as well at once surrender to Bolshevism. But it\r\nis not enough that it is accepted as true by all the wise and thoughtful\r\namong us. To meet the exigency now before us we must formulate that\r\ndoctrine, proclaim it, make a creed of it, and teach it to our children\r\nand to the ignorant. We cannot expect to destroy Bolshevism by merely\r\nusing strong language about it. Its strength is partly due to its\r\ncourage and consistency. To oppose it we must be courageous and\r\nconsistent. We must meet the attack on property by arming property with\r\nweapons of self-defense. Political attack must be met by political\r\naction. When fundamentals are assailed foundations must be strengthened.\r\nWe must weave property rights into the very fabric of our political life\r\nand make them an essential part of Americanism. Seven-eighths of our\r\nadult men are owners of or interested in property. They should take\r\nsteps to make their rights therein absolutely secure by creating a\r\nprivate property electorate. Universal suffrage, manhood suffrage, and\r\nevery other similar anti-social heresy should be expunged from our\r\nstatute books. Manhood suffrage which formerly spelled merely thievery\r\nand plundering, now spells destruction. And female suffrage is even\r\nworse, a plain, palpable, odious and contemptible humbug and\r\nabomination, a malignant source of peril. The fight against Bolshevism\r\ncan only be conducted on principles which exclude from the ballot box\r\nevery form of practical inefficiency. There is no place for ignorance,\r\ndependency, and sentimentalism, feminine or other, in an efficient\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n     THE CASE IS URGENT; THERE SHOULD BE NO DELAY WHATEVER IN\r\n     ESTABLISHING THIS GOVERNMENT UPON A PROPERTY BASIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny demand for a qualified suffrage is certain to be met by a plea for\r\ndelay. The temptation to postpone action is natural and springs at once\r\nto the heart of almost every man whose judgment counsels him to\r\nundertake anything new and troublesome. There is, too, an immense party\r\ninterested in maintaining the present corrupt régime; including the\r\npoliticians, office holders, political heelers and featherhead\r\nagitators, and a considerable predatory band who live off the pickings\r\nand stealings of politics. In opposing any effort to establish a voters’\r\nproperty qualification these will be supported by some honest believers\r\nin the present system, as there are honest believers in all established\r\nsystems; including in this case multitudes of visionaries and the\r\ninexperienced, especially the young. Even some of those most willing to\r\nadmit the mischiefs attendant upon universal suffrage will make the plea\r\nof delay for delay’s sake; the plea of the indolent, the inert, the\r\ntimid, the weak, the hesitating. The first answer to this plea is that\r\nthe importance of the matter will not admit of delay. The health of the\r\nnation is involved, and with a nation as with a man the question of\r\nhealth is one of life itself. When the body is ill and suffering a\r\ndeadly and poisonous infection not an hour’s delay should be tolerated\r\nin applying the necessary corrective. Who can say how soon the man or\r\nthe nation may have to meet an attack that will strain his or its\r\nstrength to the very utmost? Next, it is to be realized that there is no\r\nproposal of an alternative remedy; and no delay therefore is needed for\r\nthe purpose of choice. No writer or publicist so much as suggests any\r\nother different medicine or treatment, nor is it possible to do so. The\r\ncause of the mischief is unlimited suffrage, and nothing but the removal\r\nof the cause will avail. There remains to be considered the appeal of\r\nthose who say “leave it to time” to improve the situation. If there be\r\nthose who really expect relief in this matter from the passage of time\r\nand from the changes that time unaided may bring, they are much\r\nmistaken. The same causes which have heretofore produced the mischiefs\r\ncomplained of are still operative and will continue to operate; they\r\ninclude the power of organization, human cupidity, and the existence of\r\na controllable class of voters. The first two of these are permanent and\r\ncontinuous forces; the latter is what we propose to abolish. The\r\npolitical oligarchies never were as strong as they are to-day; the\r\ndearth of great and good men in political life was never so great as\r\nnow; all the mischiefs referred to in this volume are in full blast, if\r\nnot in one place then in another. One looks in vain into newspapers,\r\nbooks or magazines, one listens in vain to political speeches or private\r\ntalks for any definite promise or even suggestion of relief from any\r\nquarter. The general attitude seems to be that nothing can be done to\r\nimprove the situation. Each reader of this book is therefore warned that\r\nit is for him or some one like him to make the start. This book is an\r\noffering to the cause; who will follow it up by action?\r\n\r\nThe professional reformers dare not attack universal suffrage; they are\r\nnearly all office-seekers, open or conceded. The writers on American\r\npolitics and government are generally careful to ignore the evils of the\r\nsystem, so they cannot possibly urge its removal. In fact, the reader\r\nneeds to be warned against most of them as blind guides; the more\r\napparently respectable are the more timid and time serving; unable to\r\nentirely overlook the grievous condition of affairs, they carefully\r\navoid criticism offensive to popular vanity and to the powers that be;\r\nthey flatter us by pretending to ascribe the actual and notorious\r\nfailure of our democracy to the careless generosity of our national\r\ncharacter. They prattle of American good nature, national optimism,\r\neasy-going tolerance; of our engrossment in business, and of American\r\n“fatalism,” all of which nonsense is supposed to account in a manner\r\nrather to our credit for our submission to plunder and misrule. There\r\nare other explanations equally amusing. We are told with an air of\r\nprofundity that these rascalities have been permitted because of\r\npeculiar circumstances; from 1860 to 1870 it was because of slavery\r\nagitation and the Civil War; that people were too busy agitating and\r\nfighting to watch the thieves. In the very next breath we are told that\r\nin the Civil War the “moral forces” were in possession of the nation.\r\nFor the next decade the excuse is that we were immersed in great\r\nspeculations and so on. But these explanations really explain nothing;\r\nthey fail to explain why our official guardians and rulers\r\nsystematically rob us whenever we are too busy to watch them, nor why\r\nthey are not replaced by people who can be trusted. These expounders\r\nproclaim that the people need only to “arise in their might” and the\r\ncorruption of three generations will become incorruption. When at any\r\nelection one political ring goes out and another comes in they utter\r\nchildish blasts of triumph. One wonders, inexperienced as some of these\r\nso called publicists are, whether they really can themselves believe\r\nsuch rubbish. After the explosion of some superlative political scandal\r\nthey can often be heard telling the public that all will come right by\r\nand by; which means that we have only to continue to sit patiently and\r\nlet ourselves be fleeced until the kind fairies bring good times. We are\r\nsupposed to be very easily soothed and perhaps we are. Bryce, for\r\ninstance, who as a political radical has been trained to give ear to the\r\nbellowing of the _vox populi_, speaking of our rascal legislators, tells\r\nus reassuringly that “if before a mischievous bill passes, its opponents\r\ncan get the attention of the people fixed upon it, its chances are\r\nslight.” (Vol. II, p. 369.) As though one should say to a merchant,\r\n“Don’t worry about your clerk robbing you, any time you actually catch\r\nhim stealing he’ll stop; he won’t persist in that particular theft\r\nanyhow; he’ll just be compelled to drop that and wait for a chance at\r\nsomething else.” From all which it appears as a result of all these\r\ndiscussions that no one pretends to see any definite prospect of\r\nsubstantial improvement or alleviation. In all the ten thousand pages on\r\nAmerican government written by a score of authors, domestic and foreign,\r\nnot one is able to say that we have an honest, decent or efficient\r\ngovernmental system, and not one offers any definite scheme for\r\npractical relief. On all sides we are told that there is little to do\r\nbut to believe and hope.\r\n\r\nAs far as this hope can be said to refer to anything specific or to be\r\nmore than mere sighing wishfulness which profiteth nothing, it is\r\nfounded on belief in the educational work of the schools and the vague\r\nnotion that thereby all the people will some time become so good and so\r\nwell informed that manhood suffrage will be pure, safe and efficient.\r\nThis hope is all moonshine. The mentally deficient and the ignorant will\r\nalways be with us. There will always be upper, middle and lower classes\r\nas long as private property endures and free play is given to human\r\nactivities; that is to say as long as our American civilization\r\nprevails. In the march of life some will always be in the front and some\r\nhopelessly in the rear. Faster than the increase of the information of\r\nthe common man and the development of his mentality will proceed the\r\ngrowth of the great body of human knowledge; and the greater therefore\r\nwill be the comparative ignorance of the ordinary citizen. The wealth,\r\neducation, refinement, mental power, efficiency and achievement of the\r\ngifted will always far exceed those of the common people; and the\r\ndistance between the efficient and the inefficient, the dullards and the\r\nintellectuals will probably become even greater and greater as time goes\r\non. Though ordinary information will become more widespread, the science\r\nof government as well as other sciences will continue year by year in\r\nthe future as in the past to become more complicated; and more and more\r\nas the years pass it will be found essential that the hands which\r\noperate the machinery of state shall be skilled to the very utmost.\r\nMeantime envy, prejudice, cupidity, neglect, intolerance and imprudence\r\nwill continue to be human qualities, pushing men downward physically and\r\nmorally; disease and misfortune will continue to do their work in the\r\nworld, and a century from now it will be more dangerous even than today\r\nto trust men of the least developed or more unfortunate classes to\r\nselect competent and trustworthy managers of the business of government.\r\nThe future as far as can now be seen will not of itself give us relief\r\nfrom our present misgovernment; the action of our own hands and brains\r\nmust be invoked for that purpose. Of that action there should be neither\r\ndelay nor postponement. Our plight needs a remedy and needs it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, in the last chapter, seems to be an appropriate place to\r\nanticipate and reply to a few prospective objections.\r\n\r\n_Objection that the project is undemocratic._ This assumes that\r\nuniversal suffrage is a democratic institution; but in practise it\r\noperates to the contrary as has already been shown. The prospect\r\npractically offered by the property qualification project, is the\r\ndemocratic one of the door of political opportunity opened to that\r\nhonest ability which is now by the machines and rings excluded from a\r\npublic career. So much for the practical test. Looking at the project in\r\nthe abstract, it is satisfying to the democratic mind, whether viewed in\r\nthe light of high principle, of idealism, of nature’s law, or of\r\ndemocratic policy. It recognizes and rewards merit, it puts a premium on\r\nindustry and capacity, and thus satisfies a principle. Its ideal is\r\nnoble; it is that of the creation of a high grade of citizenship, the\r\nestablishment of a democracy of virtue and talent. It conforms to\r\nnature’s law by preferring the fittest; by creating order in the ranks\r\nof citizenship; by putting government into the hands of those whom\r\nnature herself has selected as competent. It accords with democratic\r\npolicy because it will give democracy more strength and more wisdom;\r\nbecause it is progressive, and calculated to encourage progress; because\r\nit glorifies citizenship by making it a token of distinction; because it\r\nat once makes its active citizenship select by excluding the unworthy,\r\nand at the same time, open and free to all, by inviting all to qualify\r\nto exercise it. It will create a true majority rule; for the new\r\nelectorate will undoubtedly constitute a great majority in numbers of\r\nthe men of the country; and will represent practically all its\r\ncivilization, education, talent, energy and ability. It will give the\r\nhumble his due which is opportunity to rise; he is entitled to no more.\r\nTo the poor man of capacity the door to the voting booth will be as wide\r\nopen as the free high school door is to his son; the entrance in either\r\ncase is for those who can qualify and the terms are the same for all. To\r\nadmit the unqualified would not benefit them, while it would harm those\r\nwho are properly inside. Only the shiftless and worthless poor are\r\npermanently excluded. The industrious thrifty poor man is only\r\npostponed; and he will know that when he does enter by virtue of\r\nachievement, he will possess something worth while, something of value;\r\nhe will be an active citizen, and his suffrage will not be offset and\r\nnullified by the purchased vote of a worthless loafer.\r\n\r\n_Objection that the proposal is oppressive._ It would be oppressive if\r\nit were arbitrary, or unreasonable, or personal; but it is none of\r\nthese. It is a greater hardship to be discharged from a job than to be\r\nprevented from voting at a public election; and if a man can properly be\r\ndischarged for incompetency, he can certainly be deprived of his vote\r\nfor incapacity, under a rule which applies to all under similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n_The objection that the project will be barren of results_ is sure to be\r\nmade. But good results will surely issue from it unless the whole\r\nconception of this volume is a mistake. It was within the purpose of\r\nsome of the master-minds of the republic’s early days to direct the\r\nnation in the paths of true and scientific Federal achievement. The\r\nfar-reaching plans of Washington and John Quincy Adams for the\r\ndevelopment of mutually interacting national systems of industrial,\r\ntransportational and educational development were finally defeated by\r\nthe ignorant and tiger-like rapacity of the Jacksonian manhood suffrage\r\nbands. (_Degradation of the Democratic Dogma_; Brooks Adams, p. 13-62.)\r\nBut those noble though aborted schemes at least serve to indicate the\r\ngreat possibilities belonging to pure and scientific government. In\r\nFederal affairs we may confidently expect a return to the pure and\r\nnoble traditions of the old Federal government of the second Adams and\r\nhis predecessors, when the democratic principle was infused with the\r\naristocratic passion for excellence; and our representatives will then\r\nbe qualified to consider and deal with national questions with ability\r\nand intelligence, and a patriotism such as has not been in political\r\noperation in this country for ninety years. Some of the direct benefits\r\nof the reform may be expected to appear in the most striking and\r\nsatisfactory possible manner, in the complete reconstruction of our\r\nstate legislatures, and our municipal governments. The change will seem\r\nalmost magical. The creation of the new and purified electorate will at\r\none stroke smash the machines, and dislodge the political oligarchies;\r\nthe standard of public conscience will be immediately elevated, and\r\nbribery at elections will almost disappear. We will then be justified in\r\nexpecting to elect legislators who can be trusted to legislate, and\r\nworthy and competent municipal officials. We will be relieved from the\r\nburden of maintaining watch dog societies and they will disappear\r\ntogether with the daily political scandals which brought them into\r\nbeing. In a word, we will be able to do for the body politic that which\r\nis done in every decent business corporation in the land; find and\r\nemploy men, honest and competent, for the work assigned to them. The\r\nprospect is alluring; one is tempted to dwell on the fine possibilities\r\nwere each of our forty-eight state legislatures composed of the first\r\nmen in each state in probity, experience and political intelligence.\r\nThere has not in our day been much really good government in the world.\r\nOne would like to see our first-rate American men, of the type and class\r\nwho have developed our industrial and transportation systems, get a fair\r\nopportunity to show the world what can be done, not only in progressive\r\nand enlightened domestic legislation, but also in pure and efficient\r\nadministration of public affairs. Dignified and purified elections;\r\nadvanced and just legislation; improved and honest administration; a\r\njustified and scientific democracy; such if not fully within the\r\npromise of the proposed reform are within the possibilities for which by\r\nappeal to the new electorate we will be encouraged to work with a fair\r\nhope of success.\r\n\r\n_Objection that the new system will not accomplish this or that\r\ndesirable thing._ Of course, no one will claim that it will bring about\r\neverything humanly possible in the way of political improvement. No one\r\ncan doubt that even after a purification of the electorate there will\r\nremain many evils in politics and much still to be done to improve our\r\ngovernmental system. There will remain, for instance, the problem of\r\nfurnishing the electorate with the facts concerning public measures, or\r\nthe means of getting them; a problem heretofore generally ignored.\r\nWalter Lippman in a very able article in a recent number of the\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_ has pointed out the great importance of providing the\r\npublic with real political information, to take the place of the mess of\r\nmisinformation now daily served up to us by the daily press. There is an\r\nentirely new field to be covered lying in that direction. Then there is\r\nthe question of how, in great cities especially, the voter is to be made\r\nacquainted with the personality and qualifications of the respective\r\ncandidates. But why attempt to specify, when the fact is that the whole\r\nregion of scientific domestic legislation remains almost unexplored and\r\nuncultivated. Under our machine system of politics, the science of\r\nlegislation has been absolutely neglected for generations, and the whole\r\nadministrative and judicial system in every state in the Union needs\r\nrevision. But the primary, the essential reform is that of the\r\nelectorate. We must begin there, because by so doing we cleanse and put\r\nin good working order the machinery which will itself undertake what\r\nelse remains to be done. We cannot expect wise measures to be furthered\r\nor even understood by an ignorant and corrupt electorate; nor can we\r\nexpect a sordid political oligarchy to enforce them, even though\r\nenacted. The electorate is the Alpha and Omega; the key to everything in\r\npolitics and government.\r\n\r\nFor example, the proposed elevation of the franchise would have the\r\neffect of making practicable municipal home rule. We are all familiar\r\nwith the evils of state control of our large cities; and yet the\r\nmischiefs of civic home rule under manhood suffrage are even greater. At\r\npresent, the voters of the great cities are necessarily deprived of all\r\nshare in many departments of municipal management; which are put in the\r\nhands of state boards and commissions because the voters cannot be\r\ntrusted. The establishment of a competent and conservative electorate in\r\ncities, would at once prepare the way for the granting to cities of\r\nlocal self-government; thus advancing the cause of practical democracy,\r\nand effecting a result for which civic reformers have labored\r\nineffectually for years.\r\n\r\nAnother good effect will be the elevation of the political tone of the\r\ncountry. This can never be done while the electorate remains degraded.\r\nIt is inspiring to think of the healthful stimulus which the politics of\r\nthe nation will receive when our men come to realize more and more the\r\nhonor and responsibility attached to the office of active citizen of the\r\nrepublic. To be enrolled on the list of voters will be a distinction\r\nwhich will be valued by those who possess it, and coveted by those who\r\ndo not; by the youth just entering his career; by the man born poor who\r\nis saving to establish a home; by the reformed spendthrift; by every\r\nAmerican who turns from a career of folly to the path of wisdom and\r\nprudence. Men of substance, education and judgment, who have not visited\r\nthe polls for years will find it worth their while to vote. And every\r\nvoter will attend with a feeling that his vote is intended to be\r\neffective for good; and will act with a sense of responsibility entirely\r\ninappropriate now, when the only real responsibility for an election\r\nrests with the boss and the machine.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, beneficial as the above specified effects of the proposed\r\nmeasure seem likely to be, still in the mind of the writer its greatest,\r\nits transcendent value lies not in any of them nor in their totality so\r\nmuch as in the expectation that it will be a decided step towards the\r\nsolution of the world’s problem of the creation of a wise, politic and\r\nprogressive democracy. The elevation of the electorate; the purification\r\nof elections; the destruction of the machines and the rings; the\r\nabolition of the political oligarchies; the better government of cities;\r\nthe heightening of the political tone; an increased efficiency in public\r\naffairs; all these are of immense consequence; but beyond and over all\r\nis the importance to America and to the world of putting the democratic\r\nmovement firm on its feet; on the right road; facing the better day and\r\nprepared to do its part in carrying on the world’s politics. This it is\r\nat present quite unable to do because it has failed to widen its\r\nconceptions with the enlargement of its power and opportunities. The\r\nultimate, the supreme power in the state, should possess capacity and\r\nunderstanding. Democracy has undertaken to make of the electorate that\r\nsupreme power. To do this successfully it had to see to it that the\r\nelectorate is suffused with intelligence, and it has failed so to do.\r\nIts duty in that regard was partially admitted and attempted by means of\r\nschool education of the young, but the recognition of the principle has\r\nnot been full or satisfying; nor have the means adopted been adequate.\r\nThe world is unable to give its full confidence to the democracy of\r\nto-day, because of its failure to fulfil its implied undertaking to\r\nproduce a competent electorate. The great objection to democracy in the\r\nminds of modern thinkers is, that originally created and idealized as\r\nthe champion of individual rights, it has gone no further; it has failed\r\nto provide for capacity and efficiency, or to recognize its duty in that\r\ndirection. On the contrary, its declared policy for the last century has\r\nbeen in the direction of degrading the quality of the voting mass by the\r\nprocess of increasing its volume from below. If democracy is to be the\r\nfuture governing force, it must absolutely and unreservedly commit\r\nitself to the principle of a thoroughly competent electorate; to be\r\nestablished not merely by preparation of the fit, but by rigorous\r\nexclusion of the unfit. The chief value therefore of the proposed\r\nelectoral reform consists in its inaugurating a complete change of\r\npolicy in this vital matter; and in the fact that it will signify that\r\nthe American democracy has awakened to the understanding of this\r\nnecessity, and has in good faith undertaken the duty of carrying out the\r\ntask of making its foundation sure and eternal.\r\n\r\nPolitics is a progressive science and it may be that the doctrine of a\r\nqualified, that is to say, a competent electorate once accepted for\r\ngeneral purposes, will receive hereafter extended application. We cannot\r\nput a limit to the possibilities of democratic efficiency to be attained\r\nthrough the further selection and elevation of the voters. While the\r\nplan of property qualification is apparently the only one at present\r\npracticable and efficacious, it would be foolish to suppose that our\r\nsuccessors may not extend the application of the principle in directions\r\nnow unthought of. For instance, in addition to the establishment of\r\nmeans for furnishing the electorate with reliable information as Mr.\r\nLippman has so sagaciously suggested, measures may in time be adopted\r\nfor recourse to an instructed opinion on proposals for official action,\r\nby submitting them to that part of the electorate whose tastes and\r\noccupations have given them special light on the subject to be passed\r\nupon. Just as there is an instructed minority in musical matters, so\r\nthere are always minorities with special knowledge of educational\r\naffairs, charities, sanitation, public schools, transportation,\r\nfinances, etc. In the great cities these groups may each amount to tens\r\nof thousands of individuals, each group constituting a true and\r\nenlightened democracy of opinion on the special subjects in which its\r\nmembers have interested themselves. In a great city like New York, for\r\ninstance: one can imagine a set of voters qualified on banking and\r\ncurrency; another on constitutional questions; another on public health,\r\nand so on; each of them containing perhaps ten thousand highly qualified\r\npersons, experts on the subject referred to; whose opinions or decisions\r\nmight be given as called for, and each carry with it a certain weight,\r\nor have a certain political or merely informative effect, as might be\r\nprovided; and so as new circumstances or situations arise, as changes\r\noccur, as experiences accumulate, the principle of qualified voting, of\r\nan appeal to a competent and responsible array of selected public\r\nopinion may be applied in many new ways, to the advantage of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n_Objection that the requirement of a qualification may be evaded._ One\r\nof the criticisms of the property qualification rule when it was the law\r\nof the land, was that it was frequently evaded by sham property\r\ntransfers. Every statute or regulation is likely to be the subject of\r\nschemes of evasion which have to be encountered as they develop. It is\r\nhardly worth while at this point to discuss imaginary difficulties which\r\nmay occur in exceptional cases in carrying out the reform. It will\r\ncertainly never be adopted until it has conquered public opinion; in\r\nwhich case means will readily be found to enforce it. Sham transfers are\r\nnot unknown in the business world; but though sometimes troublesome,\r\nthey do not practically interfere with the volume of business\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\n_Objections founded on certain standards of qualification._ The writer\r\nhas omitted to discuss the exact amount, character or measure of\r\nproperty to be named in the qualification standard. It is said that the\r\nenforcement of a rate-paying qualification in the City of London, by\r\nexcluding from the polls paupers, dependents on others, idle and\r\ninefficient working men, and the semi-criminal and criminal classes,\r\neffects a reduction of about twenty-five per cent from a full manhood\r\nsuffrage poll list. An equivalent purging here, would completely purify\r\nour voting system. But here in this country, the standard would have to\r\nvary according to local conditions, and to the judgment of the different\r\nlegislative bodies having jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to the possibility of the success of a movement to obtain the\r\nenactment of a proper qualification for voters, there can be no doubt.\r\nThe proposition is new and it will have to be carefully explained and\r\nearnestly advocated; but it will be adopted and put in force just as\r\nsoon as the people become convinced of its justice and expediency; and\r\nnot before. This means a lot of preparatory and educational work, and\r\ntherein lies perhaps a chief value of the project. Before it can be\r\nadopted, it will have to be thoroughly understood and believed in; the\r\nelectorate will have to be made to know its own present weakness and\r\ncorruption, and its own great possibilities, in future power and purity.\r\nIn short, the proper consideration of a proposal for an elevation of the\r\nelectorate, will of itself involve such self-examination and bracing up\r\nof standards, as will purify the political atmosphere even before its\r\nacceptance by the legislatures and the people.\r\n\r\nThere is no legal difficulty to be overcome, no Federal constitutional\r\nprovision in the way; and the reform can go into effect in any state,\r\nupon a vote of its people changing its constitution. This vote can be\r\nobtained. The majority of the voters in every state are property\r\nholders; it is in their power to assume control at their pleasure. If\r\nthis project is right, it will be possible to convince them of that\r\nfact. There is no reason why the working classes should oppose it; it is\r\nin their interest; most of them are family men, property owners and\r\nintelligent. It is they who have suffered most by the depredations of\r\npoliticians. They would be dull and stupid beyond all that has ever been\r\nsupposed, to fail to see that misgovernment and want of efficiency are\r\ntheir greatest enemies; that excessive taxation eats up year by year a\r\nlarge part of their surplus product; and when convinced of the justice\r\nand expediency of the measure, these serious workers will find means to\r\nsilence the senseless clamor for the vote, should there be such on the\r\npart of the inferior and worthless in the ranks of labor. Among the\r\npoliticians themselves, no doubt there are men who will break away from\r\nmachine tyranny and favor the reform; men of real ability, who realize\r\nthat working in a purer atmosphere they would achieve more real\r\ndistinction than they now obtain; men who inwardly despise the things\r\nthey are compelled to countenance and perform. Much formless prejudice\r\nthere will be also to be overcome no doubt; but that will yield to\r\nexplanation and to reason.\r\n\r\nThoughtful men everywhere are beginning to realize the humbug and menace\r\nof manhood suffrage. Writing in the _North American Review for March_,\r\n1920, Hanford Henderson says of universal suffrage that “it harms even\r\nthose whom it is supposed to benefit. To give every man and woman a vote\r\nand to declare these votes equally important and significant is both\r\nunsound and mischievous.... Universal suffrage is a characteristic\r\nexample of the democratic failure in discrimination.... An electorate\r\nnot properly qualified is an ever present public danger.” There is such\r\na prevalent disgust for present political methods that any well-planned\r\nscheme of relief will be welcomed. We need only consider whether the\r\nmeasure is right; that once made clear it can be carried. To doubt that\r\nis to doubt the possibility of a reasonable democracy.\r\n\r\nJust how far the American public is mentally prepared to seriously\r\nconsider the dominant theories of this work; just how soon, if ever,\r\nthese theories will become familiar and popular among us, it is\r\nimpossible to judge. It may be that some proofs of their acceptance will\r\nspeedily follow the publication of this volume; it may be that years or\r\neven generations will pass before the principles herein advocated will\r\nget a hearing. But to those of his readers be they ever so few, who\r\nbelieve that the things here written down are true, the author would say\r\nin the words with which this volume is begun, written by Washington on\r\nthe eve of a great and doubtful enterprise: “Let us raise a standard to\r\nwhich the wise and the honest can repair; the event is in the hand of\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        BRIEF SKETCH OF WRITERS REFERRED TO\r\n\r\n\r\n     ADAMS, BROOKS, American lawyer and publicist; author of “The Law of\r\n     Civilization and Decay,” and other works.\r\n\r\n     ADAMS, HENRY, historian; author of “History of the United States”;\r\n     “Life of Albert Gallatin,” and other works.\r\n\r\n     ALLEN, WILLIAM H., is a prominent social worker and author, and is\r\n     director of the Bureau of Municipal Research and National Training\r\n     School for the study and Administration of Public Business, Author\r\n     of “Woman’s Part in Government,” referred to in this volume.\r\n\r\n     ALGER, RUSSELL A., Major General of Volunteers in the American\r\n     Civil War; Governor of Michigan and Secretary of War under\r\n     President McKinley.\r\n\r\n     BAGEHOT, WALTER, distinguished English publicist and economist;\r\n     member of the English Bar; banker; editor of the _Economist_, and\r\n     active for many years in business and politics.
