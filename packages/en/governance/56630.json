He will probably not linger long over these\r\ncases, but will pass on to something more likely to attract his\r\ninterest. The objects he is looking at are, for the most part, neither\r\nstriking nor beautiful, and the same are presented for his inspection\r\nover and over again as collections from various Roman sites. They are\r\nchiefly useful things, implements and utensils of all kinds, and\r\nfragments of military weapons and armour. In the coins he can take no\r\ndelight, because, apart from the fact that, uninterpreted, they have no\r\ntale to tell him, they do not excite his admiration by beauty of design\r\nand workmanship. If, indeed, he were visiting a museum at Rome, he would\r\nfind plenty of beautiful things in it; but these are works of Greek\r\nartists, imported by wealthy or tasteful Romans in the later ages of\r\nRome’s history. A typical collection of genuine Roman antiquities would\r\nprobably have the effect I describe. Utility, not beauty, would seem to\r\nhave been the motive of the people who left these things behind them.\r\n\r\nThe same motive will also be suggested to us if we visit any of the\r\nlarger Roman works either in this country or on the Continent. Most of\r\nus know the look of a Roman road running straight over hill and valley,\r\nand meant mainly for military purposes, to enable troops to move rapidly\r\nand to survey the country as they marched. In the towns which have been\r\nexcavated, we usually find that the most spacious and striking buildings\r\nmust have been the meeting-halls (_basilicæ_), in which business of all\r\nkinds was transacted, and especially business connected with law and\r\ngovernment. Very often, though not in the comparatively poor province of\r\nBritain, this characteristic of utility is combined with\r\nanother—solidity and imposing size. In this well-watered island the\r\nRomans did not need aqueducts to bring a constant supply of water to\r\ntheir towns, but in Italy and the south of France these great works are\r\nsometimes unnecessarily huge and imposing. Even when they left the path\r\nof strict utility, as in their triumphal arches and gateways, for which\r\nwe must go to Trier in Germany, or to Orange in the south of France, or\r\nto Italy itself, they held strongly to the principles of solidity and\r\nimposing size. A writer who knew their art well has said that their\r\nnotion of the highest of all things, their _summum bonum_, was not the\r\nbeautiful, but the powerful, and that they thought they had as a people\r\nreceived this notion from heaven.\r\n\r\nIt would, indeed, be wrong to say that there is no beauty in Roman art;\r\nbut it is quite in accordance with what has just been said, that even in\r\nthe best of it there is a strong tendency to realism, to matter of fact.\r\nIn their sculpture they were especially strong in portraiture, and in\r\ndepicting scenes of human life they never or rarely idealise. A battle\r\nscene, or a picture on stone of life in a city, is crowded with figures,\r\njust because it really was so, and the work is without that restfulness\r\nfor the eye which the perfect grouping of a Greek artist so often\r\nsupplies. So, too, in literature; all their greatest poetry has a\r\nstrictly practical object, and bears directly on human life. The great\r\nphilosophical poem of Lucretius was meant to rescue the Romans from\r\nreligious superstition; the object of the _Æneid_ of Virgil, of which I\r\nshall have more to say in another chapter, was to recall the degenerate\r\nRoman of that day to the sense of duty in the home and in the State.\r\nTheir one original invention in literary form was satire, by which they\r\nmeant comment, friendly or hostile, on the human life around them. Their\r\nmyths and legends, of which there was no such abundant crop as in\r\nGreece, dealt chiefly with the founding of cities, or with the heroic\r\ndeeds of human beings.[1] On the whole they excelled most in oratory and\r\nhistory; and their prose came to perfection earlier than their poetry.\r\n\r\nOne other feature of their character shall be mentioned here, which is\r\nentirely in keeping with the rest, and often escapes notice. If in the\r\nworks of their hands and their brains they were not an imaginative\r\npeople, we can well understand that they had not this gift in practical\r\nlife. Imagination in action takes the form of adventurousness, as we may\r\nsee in our own history; the literary imaginativeness of Elizabethan\r\nEngland has its counterpart in the adventurous voyages of Elizabethan\r\nseamen. The Romans were not an adventurous people; they were not\r\nimaginative enough to be so. They penetrated, indeed, into unknown\r\ncountries; Cæsar reached Britain and bridged the Rhine, but that great\r\nman, a true Roman born, had a temperament rather scientific than\r\nromantic. He did as almost all conquering Romans had done before him,\r\nand were to do after him—he advanced solidly, making his way safe behind\r\nhim and feeling carefully in front of him. His book about his wars in\r\nGaul was written without a touch of imagination, and for strictly\r\npractical purposes. There is, indeed, in the generation before Cæsar, an\r\nexception so striking that it may be said to prove the rule; he who\r\nreads Plutarch’s charming life of Sertorius, an Italian from the\r\nmountains of central Italy, will find both romance and adventure in his\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, then, that we have to do in this volume with a people not\r\nof imagination, but of action: a people intensely alive to the\r\nnecessities and difficulties of human life. The Romans were, in fact,\r\nthe most practical people in history; and this enabled them to supply\r\nwhat was wanting to the civilisation of the Mediterranean basin in the\r\nwork of the Greeks. They themselves were well aware of this quality, and\r\nproud of it. We find it expressed by the elder Cato quite at the\r\nbeginning of the best age of Roman literature; his ideal Roman is _vir\r\nfortis et strenuus_—a man of strong courage and active energy. Tacitus,\r\nin the later days of that literature, says that all designs and deeds\r\nshould be directed to the practical ends of life (_ad utilitatem vitæ_).\r\nMidway between these two, we have the great Latin poets constantly\r\nsinging of the hardihood and the practical virtues which had made Rome\r\ngreat, and Italy great under Rome’s leadership. “A race of hardy breed,\r\nwe carry our children to the streams and harden them in the bitter, icy\r\nwater; as boys they spend wakeful nights over the chase, and tire out\r\nthe whirlwind, but in manhood, unwearied by toil and trained to poverty,\r\nthey subdue the soil with their mattocks, or shake towns in war” (Virg.,\r\n_Æn._ ix. 607 foll.). These lines, though applied to an Italian stock,\r\nwere meant to remind the Roman of a life that had once been his. The\r\nwords in which the Romans delighted as expressing their national\r\ncharacteristics, all tell the same tale: _gravitas_, the seriousness of\r\ndemeanour which is the outward token of a steadfast purpose;\r\n_continentia_, self-restraint; _industria_ and _diligentia_, words which\r\nwe have inherited from them, needing no explanation; _constantia_,\r\nperseverance in conduct; and last, not least, _virtus_, manliness, which\r\noriginally meant activity and courage, and with ripening civilisation\r\ntook on a broader and more ethical meaning. Quotations might be\r\nmultiplied a thousandfold to prove the honest admiration of this people\r\nfor their own nobler qualities. As exemplified in an individual,\r\nPlutarch’s life of the elder Cato, which can be read as well in English\r\nas in the original Greek, will give a good idea of these.\r\n\r\nBut it is essential to note that this hard and practical turn of the\r\nRoman mind was in some ways curiously limited. It cannot be said that\r\nthey excelled either in industrial or commercial pursuits. Agriculture\r\nwas their original occupation, and trade-gilds existed at Rome very\r\nearly in her history; but the story of their agriculture is rather a sad\r\none, and Rome has never become a great industrial city. Their first book\r\nabout husbandry was translated from the Carthaginian, and their methods\r\nof commerce they learnt chiefly from the Greeks. It was in another\r\ndirection that their genius for practical work drew them: to the arts\r\nand methods of discipline, law, government.\r\n\r\nWe can see this peculiar gift showing itself at all stages of their\r\ndevelopment: in the agricultural family which was the germ of all their\r\nlater growth, in the city-state which grew from that germ, and in the\r\nEmpire, founded by the leaders of the city-state, and organised by\r\nAugustus and his successors. It is seen, too, in their military system,\r\nwhich won them their empire; they did not fight merely for spoil or\r\nglory, but for clearly realised practical purposes. As Tacitus says of a\r\nsingle German tribe which possessed something of this gift, the Romans\r\ndid not so much go out to battle as to war. True, they constantly made\r\nblunders and suffered defeat; they often “muddled through” difficulties\r\nas we do ourselves; but they refused to recognise defeat, and profited\r\nby adverse fortune. Listen once more to a few words of old Cato; in his\r\n_Origins of Rome_, written for his son, he wrote: “Adversity tames us,\r\nand teaches us our true line of conduct, while good fortune is apt to\r\nwarp us from the way of prudence.” Thus they went on from defeat to\r\nvictory, conquest, and government. It is worth while not only to lay to\r\nheart, but to learn by heart, the famous lines in which Virgil sums up\r\nthe Roman’s conception of his own work in the world—\r\n\r\n  “Others will mould their bronzes to breathe with a tenderer grace,\r\n  Draw, I doubt not, from marble a vivid life to the face,\r\n  Plead at the bar more deftly, with sapient wands of the wise,\r\n  Trace heaven’s courses and changes, predict us stars to arise.\r\n  Thine, O Roman, remember, to reign over every race!\r\n  These be thine arts, thy glories, the ways of peace to proclaim,\r\n  Mercy to show to the fallen, the proud with battle to tame!”\r\n                                                    _Æneid_, vi. 847-853\r\n                                                  (Bowen’s translation).\r\n\r\nIt was this power of ruling, which itself implies a habit of discipline,\r\nthat marked out Rome as the natural successor of Greece in European\r\ncivilisation; and it grew naturally out of the purely practical bent of\r\nthe early Romans, who were unhampered in their constant activity by\r\nfancy, reflection, or culture. Without it, we may doubt if the work of\r\nthe Greeks would have been saved for us when the storms from the north,\r\ninvasions of barbarian peoples, fell at last upon the sunny lands filled\r\nwith the spirit of Greek thought and the divine works of Greek artists.\r\nTo Roman discipline, law, and government, we owe not only much that even\r\nnow is every day of practical benefit to us, but the preservation of\r\nwhat we still possess of the treasures of Hellenic genius.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I assume that this book will be taken up by most readers\r\nafter they have made some acquaintance with the history and thought of\r\nthe Greeks. It is true that the history of the two peoples is best\r\nlooked at as one great whole; there is a general likeness in their\r\ninstitutions; the form of the State, and the ideas of government, with\r\nwhich each grew to maturity, were in the main the same. But Roman mental\r\ndevelopment was much slower than Greek; and Greece was already beginning\r\nto lose her vitality when Rome was still illiterate and unable to record\r\nher own history adequately. Thus Greek influence was the first to tell\r\nupon the world; the basin of the Mediterranean was already permeated by\r\nthe Greek spirit when Roman influence began to work upon it; and there\r\ncan be no doubt that he who begins with Roman history and then goes on\r\nto Greek is reversing the natural order of things.\r\n\r\nI will also assume that those who have begun to read this book are\r\nprovided with some knowledge of that Mediterranean basin which is the\r\nscene of Græco-Roman history; such as can be gained by frequent\r\ncontemplation of a good map. They will be familiar with Sicily and south\r\nItaly, which were teeming with Greek settlements when Roman history\r\nreally begins. They will probably have realised how short a step it is\r\nfrom Italy to Africa, whether or no Sicily be taken as a stepping-stone;\r\nCato could show fresh figs in the Roman senate which had been grown in\r\nCarthaginian territory. They will have realised that you can pass from\r\nthe “heel” of Italy to the Hellenic peninsula in a single night, as\r\nCæsar did when he embarked his army at Brindisi to attack his rival;\r\nsuch geographical facts are of immense importance in explaining not only\r\nthe foreign policy of Rome, but also the development of her culture. And\r\nthus furnished, they will begin to be curious about the destiny of the\r\nItalian peninsula, of which Greek history has had little to tell them.\r\nLeaving that question for the present, they will wish to know why the\r\nGreeks did not colonise the centre and north of Italy as they did the\r\nsouth and south-west, but left room enough for a new type of\r\ncivilisation to grow up there. And above all, they will wish to know how\r\nand why a single city on the western coast should have succeeded in\r\nbuilding up a great power in Italy quite independent of Greece, and\r\ndestined eventually to supersede her, which may be reckoned as a factor\r\nalmost as important in the making of our modern civilisation as Hellas\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThis last question is the one which I must try to answer in the earlier\r\npart of this book; in the later chapters I shall have to deal with\r\nanother one—how this single city-state contrived to weld together the\r\nwhole Mediterranean civilisation, strongly enough to give it several\r\ncenturies of security against uncivilised enemies in the north, and\r\nhalf-civilised enemies in the east. But for the moment let us see why\r\nthe Greeks did not permeate Italy with their own civilisation as they\r\ndid Sicily: how it was that they left room for a new power, capable\r\neventually of shielding them and their work from destruction. To answer\r\nthis question we must consider the nature of the Italian peninsula, and\r\nthe character of the races then living in it.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact is, that though the shrewd commercial Greek had seized\r\non all the best harbours in the long, narrow peninsula, these harbours\r\nwere all in the south coast, about the “heel” of Italy, or in the\r\nsouth-west coast, in the volcanic region of the modern Naples, which was\r\nitself one of these Greek settlements. The east coast north of the\r\n“heel” is almost harbourless, as will be realised by any one who takes\r\nthe route by rail to Brindisi on his way to Egypt or India. _Italy is a\r\nmountainous country_—a fact never to be forgotten in Roman history—and\r\nits mountains, the long chain of the Apennines, have their spinal ridge\r\nmuch nearer the east than the west coast, and descend upon the sea so\r\nsharply on that side that for long distances road or railway only just\r\nfinds a passage. All along this east coast there was nothing to tempt\r\nGreeks to settle, and as they rarely or never penetrated far inland from\r\ntheir settlements, their influence never spread into this mountainous\r\nregion from the many seacoast towns of Magna Græcia, as their part of\r\nItaly was called. On the Bay of Naples they had, indeed, a better\r\nchance; here there was a rich fertile plain stretching away to the\r\nhills, which on this side come down less steeply than on the eastern;\r\nthis we shall hear of again as the Plain of Campania, in which Greek\r\ninfluence was very strong and active, capable of penetrating beyond its\r\nlimits northward. But north of this again they left no permanent\r\nsettlements; good harbours are wanting, and such as there are were\r\noccupied about the eighth century B.C. by a people at that time as\r\nenterprising as themselves, the Etruscans. These, too, had been recent\r\nimmigrants into the peninsula from the east, and together with the\r\nGreeks they formed the only obstacles to the growth of a native Italian\r\npower—a power, that is, belonging to the older races that had long been\r\nsettled there. The Greeks were not likely to interfere with such a\r\ngrowth, as we have seen; whether the Etruscans were to do so we have yet\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, this Etruscan people who first gave an Italian stock\r\nthe chance of rising into a great Mediterranean power; and in order to\r\nunderstand how this was, we must look at a good map of central Italy,\r\nwhich gives a fair idea of the elevations in this part of the peninsula.\r\nLooking at such a map, it is easy to see that the long, narrow leg of\r\nItaly is cloven in twain about the middle by a river, the Tiber, the\r\nonly river of considerable size and real historical importance, south of\r\nthe Po. It is formed of several streams which descend from the central\r\nmass of the Apennines, now called the Abruzzi, but soon gathers into a\r\nswift though not a wide river, and emerges from that mountainous\r\ndistrict some five-and-twenty miles from the sea, into what we now call\r\nthe Roman Campagna, the Latium of ancient times; skirting the northern\r\nedge of this comparatively level district it falls into the sea, without\r\nforming a natural harbour, about half-way up the western coast of the\r\npeninsula. To the north of it and of the plain were settled a number of\r\ncities, more or less independent of each other, forming the Etruscan\r\npeople, whose origin we do not yet know for certain, and whose language\r\nhas never been deciphered from the inscriptions they have left behind\r\nthem; a mysterious race, active in war and commerce, who had subdued but\r\nnot exterminated the native population around them. To the east and\r\nsouth of the Tiber, stretching far along the mountainous region and its\r\nwestern outskirts, was a race of hardy mountaineers, broken up, as hill\r\npeoples usually are, into a number of communities without any principle\r\nof cohesion except that of the various tribes to which they belonged.\r\nThe northern part of this sturdy hill-folk was known as Umbrians and\r\nSabines; the southern part as Samnites or Oscans. They all spoke\r\ndialects of the same tongue, a tongue akin to those which most European\r\npeoples still speak. Lastly, immediately to the south of the Tiber in\r\nthe last part of its course, occupying the plain which stretches here\r\nbetween the mountains, the river, and the sea, there was settled another\r\nbranch of this same stock, speaking another dialect destined to be known\r\nfor ever as Latin. These three sub-races of a great stock—Umbrians,\r\nSamnites, and Latins—are meant when we speak of a native Italian\r\npopulation as opposed to Greek or Etruscan immigrants. Doubtless they\r\nwere not the aboriginal inhabitants of the country, but of older stocks\r\nhistory knows nothing that concerns us in this book. These are the\r\npeoples who were destined to be supreme in the Mediterranean basin, and\r\neventually to govern the whole civilised world.\r\n\r\nIt is as well to be quite clear at once that the acquisition of this\r\nsupremacy was not the work of one only of these peoples, the Latins, or\r\nof one city only of the Latins, _i.e._ Rome. It was the work of all\r\nthese stocks which I have called native Italian. Roman is a convenient\r\nword, and Rome was all along the leader in action and the organising\r\npower; but the material, and in a great part as time went on the\r\nbrain-power also, was contributed by all these peoples taken together.\r\nThey had first to submit to the great leader and organiser, Rome, a fate\r\nagainst which, as we shall see, they struggled long; but no sooner had\r\nthey submitted than they were added to the account of Italian\r\ndevelopment, and with few exceptions played their new part with a good\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the Italian peoples who were to supersede the Greeks\r\nin the world’s history. But let us now return for a moment to the Tiber,\r\nand fix our eyes on the last five-and-twenty miles of its course, where\r\nit separates the plain of Latium from the Etruscan people to the north.\r\nThe Latin-speaking stock were far more in danger from these Etruscans\r\nthan the Umbrian and Samnite mountaineers; nothing but the river was\r\nbetween them and their enemies, for enemies they undoubtedly were, bent\r\non pushing farther south, like the Danes in England in the ninth century\r\nof our era. The Latins had, indeed, a magnificent natural fortress in\r\nthe middle of their plain, in the extinct volcano of the Alban mountain,\r\nsome 3000 feet above sea-level; and here, according to a sure tradition,\r\nwas their original chief city, Alba Longa. But this was of no avail\r\nagainst an invader from the north; it was the river that was the vital\r\nconcern of Latium when once the Etruscans had become established to the\r\nnorth of it. Now at one point, some twenty miles by water from the\r\nriver’s mouth, was a group of small hills, rising to a height of about\r\n160 feet, three of them almost isolated and abutting on the stream, and\r\nthe others in reality a part of the plain to the south, with their\r\nnorthern sides falling somewhat steeply towards the Tiber. Here, too,\r\nwas an island in the river, which might give an enemy an easy chance of\r\ncrossing. On this position there arose at some uncertain date, but\r\nbeyond doubt as a fortress against the Etruscan power, a city called\r\n_Roma_; and there a city has been ever since, known by the same name. It\r\nis likely enough that it was an outpost founded by the city of Alba\r\nLonga, which eventually itself vanished out of history; and this was the\r\ntradition of later days. If we can accept the motive of the\r\nfoundation—the defence of Latium against her foe, we need not trouble\r\nabout the many legends of it.\r\n\r\nRome started on her wonderful career as a military outpost of a people\r\nakin to her, and face to face with an enemy with whom she had no sort of\r\nrelationship. If she could but hold her position there was obviously a\r\ngreat future for her. The position on the Tiber was, in fact,\r\nstrategically the best in Italy. It is, as a great Roman historian said,\r\njust in the centre of the peninsula. There was easy access to the sea\r\nboth by land and water, and a way open into central Italy up the Tiber\r\nvalley—the one great natural entrance from the sea. She was far enough\r\nfrom the sea to be safe from raiders, yet near enough to be in\r\ncommunication with other peoples by means of shipping. If enemies\r\nattacked her from different directions inland, she could move against\r\nthem on what in military language we may call “inner lines”—she could\r\nstrike simultaneously from a common base. From the sea no power dared\r\nattack her, until in her degenerate days Genseric landed at Ostia in\r\nA.D. 455. On the whole, we may say that no other city in Italy had the\r\nsame chance, as regards position, of dominating the whole of Italy, and\r\nthat in those early days of her history the Etruscans unwittingly taught\r\nher how to use this great advantage. Just as the kingdom of the West\r\nSaxons, and their supremacy in England, was built up by the stern\r\nnecessity of having to resist the Danes, so the Romans became a leading\r\npeople in Italy by virtue of having to withstand the Etruscans.\r\n\r\nIn my next chapter I propose to tell the story in outline (and in detail\r\nit cannot be told for want of knowledge) of the advance of the Roman\r\npower to the leadership of Italy. Then I will try and explain the\r\nqualities and the organisation which enabled her to turn her chances to\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                      THE ADVANCE OF ROME IN ITALY\r\n\r\n\r\nI said in the last chapter that if Rome could only hold the line of the\r\nlower Tiber against the Etruscans, great possibilities of advance were\r\nopen to her. How long she held it we do not know; but there is hardly a\r\ndoubt that in course of time—some time probably in the sixth century\r\nB.C.—she lost it, and even herself fell into the hands of the enemy. The\r\ntale is not told in her legendary annals; but we have other convincing\r\nevidence. The last three kings of Rome seem to have been Etruscans. The\r\ngreat temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline hill, which was founded at\r\nthis time, was in the Etruscan style, and built on foundations of\r\nEtruscan masonry, some of which can still be seen in the garden of the\r\nGerman embassy in modern Rome. Below this temple, as you go to the\r\nriver, was a street called the street of the Etruscans, and there are\r\nother signs of the conquest which need not be given here. On the whole\r\nwe may believe that this persistent enemy crossed the Tiber higher up,\r\nwhere she already had a footing, and so took the city in flank and rear.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the Etruscans were not in the habit of destroying the\r\ncities they took: they occupied and made use of them. They seem to have\r\nused Rome to spread their influence over Latium: they built a temple of\r\nJupiter on the Alban hill, the old centre of a Latin league: and there\r\nis strong evidence that they made Rome the head of another and later\r\nleague, with a religious centre in a temple of Diana, who was not\r\noriginally a Roman deity, on the Aventine hill overlooking the Tiber.\r\nAll events in this Etruscan period are very dim and doubtful, but it\r\nlooks as if the very loss of the line of defence had only given the\r\nconquered city a new lease of life, with a widened outlook and fresh\r\nopportunities. But was she to continue as an Etruscan city? The question\r\nreminds us of a crisis in our own history: was England to become a\r\nNorman-French country after the Conquest?\r\n\r\nAt this time it seems that the Etruscans were being harassed from the\r\nnorth by Gallic tribes, who had already spread over northwest Europe,\r\nand were conquering the valley of the Po and pressing farther south.\r\nThis may account for the undoubted fact that about the end of the sixth\r\ncentury B.C. Rome did succeed in throwing off the Etruscan yoke: that\r\nthe old Roman families united to expel their foreign king, and to\r\nestablish an aristocratic republic. Henceforward the very name of king\r\n(_rex_) was held in abhorrence by the Romans, and the government passed\r\ninto the hands of two yearly elected magistrates, with absolute power as\r\nleaders in war, and a limited power within the city. In the next chapter\r\nI will explain this new form of government more fully: here it will be\r\nenough to say that they were called consuls, and that they had an\r\nadvising body (as the kings probably had before them) of the heads of\r\nnoble families, called _senatus_, or a body of elderly men. At present\r\nlet us go on with the story of Rome’s advance in Italy.\r\n\r\nAccording to the legend, the Etruscans made a vigorous attempt to\r\nrecover Rome. This is a picturesque story, and is admirably told in one\r\nof Macaulay’s famous _Lays of Ancient Rome_. But we must pass it over\r\nhere, for we have no means of testing the truth of it. Soon afterwards\r\nwe come upon what seems to be a real historical fact, a treaty between\r\nRome and the other Latin cities, the text of which was preserved for\r\nmany centuries. This treaty shows plainly that henceforward we have to\r\nreckon Rome and Latium as one power in Italy; and this is the first real\r\nforward step in the advance of Rome. It guaranteed in the first place\r\nmutual support in war; Rome needed support against the Etruscans, and\r\nthe Latin cities at the southern end of the plain were liable to be\r\nattacked by hill tribes from the east and south. Still more important as\r\nshowing the advance of civilisation was the sanction of a common system\r\nof private law. Any citizen of a Latin city (including, of course, Rome\r\n) was to be able to buy and sell, to hold and inherit property, in any\r\nother city, in full confidence that he would be protected by the law of\r\nthat city in so doing; and if he married a woman of another city his\r\nmarriage was legitimate and his children could inherit his property\r\naccording to law.[2] This was going a long way towards making a single\r\nstate of the whole of Latium. All the communities were on equal terms,\r\nand all had certain legal relations with each other; and these are two\r\nof the chief features of a true federation. Now all federations were an\r\nimprovement on the isolation of the single city-state, which was\r\nhelpless in those days of turbulence and invasion. This one looks like\r\nthe work of a statesman; and if that statesman was a Roman, Spurius\r\nCassius, as tradition asserted, then Rome had achieved her first victory\r\nin the arts of statesmanship and diplomacy with which she was destined\r\nto rule the world.\r\n\r\nBefore we go on with our story let us notice how well Latium was\r\ngeographically fitted to develop a federation, as compared with the more\r\nmountainous districts of Italy. Latium was a plain, as its name seems to\r\nimply; and like Bœotia in Greece it was naturally suited for federative\r\nunion, while tribes living in the highlands always found it difficult to\r\nunite. Again, the Latins were jammed into a comparatively small space\r\nbetween the hills and the sea, and their strength was concentrated by\r\ntheir position: while the Etruscans, and the various Italian stocks,\r\nwere continually moving onward to look for better quarters, and losing\r\ntheir strength and their cohesion in doing so.\r\n\r\nIn these early federations of cities there was always a tendency for one\r\nparticular city to slip into the position of leader, just as in modern\r\nfederations, that of Switzerland for example, there is a continual\r\ntendency for the central authority to extend its influence. In Latium\r\nthere can be no doubt that Rome very soon began to assume some kind of\r\nheadship. Her position on the Tiber, and the constant strain that she\r\nhad to undergo in resisting the Etruscans, gave her an advantage over\r\nthe other Latin cities, who had to resist less constant annoyance from\r\nless highly civilised enemies. I mean that the Roman people had both\r\nnerve and brain so continually exercised that they developed not only\r\nbrute courage, but endurance, diplomatic skill and forethought. For a\r\nwhole century after they expelled their Etruscan kings they had to keep\r\nup a continual struggle with the great Etruscan city of Veii, which was\r\nonly a few miles to the north of the river, on very high ground, and\r\nwith the smaller town of Fidenæ on the Tiber above Rome, which the\r\nVeians could make use of to attack them from that side. No wonder that\r\nwhen at last they succeeded in taking Veii they burnt it to the ground.\r\nIt is said that they thought of migrating to that lofty site themselves,\r\nand abandoning the position on the Tiber; but they wisely gave up the\r\nidea, and Veii was sacked and her goddess Juno brought to Rome. The site\r\nis a deserted spot at the present day.\r\n\r\nIt was this prolonged struggle, in which the Latins were of course\r\ncalled upon to help, that placed Rome in the position of leader of the\r\nleague, and from the moment it was over we find her attitude towards the\r\nLatins a changed one. It is likely enough that she had long been growing\r\noverbearing and unpopular with the other cities, but of this, if it was\r\nso, we have no certain details. What we do know is that at the beginning\r\nof the fourth century B.C., when a terrible disaster overtook Rome, the\r\nLatins failed to serve her.\r\n\r\nThis disaster was the capture and sack of Rome by a wandering tribe of\r\nGauls from the north, who descended the valley of the Tiber, took the\r\nRomans by surprise, and utterly routed them at the little river Allia,\r\ntwelve miles from the city. These Gauls were formidable in battle and\r\nfairly frightened the Romans; but, like other Celtic peoples, they were\r\nincapable of settling down into a solid State, or of making good use of\r\ntheir victories. They vanished as quickly as they had come, and left\r\nnothing behind them but an indelible memory of the terror they had\r\ninspired, and many stories of the agony of that catastrophe. The most\r\ncharacteristic of these shows the veneration of the Romans for what was\r\nperhaps their greatest political institution, the Senate. The citizens\r\nhad fled to the Capitol, where they contrived to hold out till relief\r\ncame; but meanwhile the older Senators, men who were past the age of\r\nfighting, determined to meet their death, and devoted themselves,\r\naccording to an old religious practice resorted to in extreme peril, to\r\nthe infernal deities. Each then took his seat in state robes at the door\r\nof his house. There the Gauls found them and marvelled, taking them for\r\nmore than human. At last a Gaul ventured to stroke the beard of one of\r\nthem named Papirius, who immediately struck him with his ivory wand: he\r\nwas instantly slain, and of the rest not one survived. We need not ask\r\nwhether this story is true or not, for it is impossible to test it: but\r\nit is truly Roman in feeling, and from a religious point of view it\r\nfalls in line with others that were told of the sacrifice of the\r\nindividual for the State.\r\n\r\nThis experience was a terrible discipline for the Romans, but no sooner\r\nhad the Gauls departed than they began to turn it to practical account.\r\nThey saw that they must secure the country to the north of them more\r\neffectually, and they did so by making large portions of it Roman\r\nterritory, and by establishing two colonies there, _i.e._ garrisoned\r\nfortresses on military roads. Then they turned to deal with their own\r\nconfederates, who perhaps had felt a secret satisfaction in the\r\nhumiliation of a leader of whom they were jealous, and were now,\r\nespecially the two great neighbouring cities of Tibur and Præneste\r\n(Tivoli and Palestrina), beginning to rise in open revolt. Knowing what\r\nhappened afterwards, we can say that these Latin cities were standing in\r\nthe way of Italian progress: but to the ancient city-state independence\r\nwas the very salt of life.\r\n\r\nAll public records and materials for history, except those engraved on\r\nstone, were destroyed in the capture and burning of Rome by the Gauls,\r\nso that up to this time Roman “history” is not really worthy of the\r\nname. But from this time onward certain official records were preserved,\r\nand we gradually pass into an age which may truly be called historical.\r\nIn detail it will still be questionable, chiefly owing to the tendency\r\nof Roman leading families to glorify the deeds of their own ancestors at\r\nthe expense of truth, and so to hand on false accounts to the age when\r\nhistory first came to be written down. But in the fourth and third\r\ncenturies B.C. it becomes fairly clear in outline. I said in the last\r\nchapter that the Romans were curiously destitute of the imaginative\r\nfaculty. But no people is entirely without imagination, and it is most\r\ninteresting to find the Romans using their moderate allowance in\r\ninventing the details of noble deeds and honourable services to the\r\nState. Provoking as it is to us, and provoking even to the Roman\r\nhistorian Livy himself, who was well aware of it, this habit has its own\r\nvalue as a feature of old Roman life and character.\r\n\r\nBut I must return to the story of the advance of Rome in Italy. It seems\r\nclear that after the Gallic invasion the Latins became more and more\r\ndiscontented with Roman policy, which probably aimed at utilising all\r\nthe resources of the league and at the same time getting complete\r\ncontrol of its relations to other powers. We have the text in Greek,\r\npreserved by the historian Polybius, of a treaty with Carthage, then the\r\ngreatest naval power in the Mediterranean, which well illustrates this:\r\nthe date is 348 B.C. Rome acts for Latium in negotiating this treaty;\r\nand Carthage undertook not to molest the Latin cities, _provided that\r\nthey remained faithful to Rome_; nay, even to restore to the power of\r\nthe leading city any revolting Latin community that might fall into\r\ntheir hands. This plainly shows that revolt was expected, and a few\r\nyears later it became general. But in spite of the support of the\r\nCampanians in the rich volcanic plain farther south, and indeed of\r\ndanger so great that it gave rise to another story of the “devotio” of a\r\nRoman consul to the infernal deities on behalf of the State, the Latins\r\nwere completely beaten at the battle of Mount Vesuvius, and the Romans\r\nwere able so to alter the league as to deprive it of all real claim to\r\nbe called a federation.\r\n\r\nWe saw that any citizen of a Latin city could buy and hold property,\r\nmarry and have legitimate children, in any other Latin city, knowing\r\nthat he was protected by the law in the enjoyment of these rights. But\r\nafter the rebellion this was all changed. A citizen could enjoy these\r\nrights in his own city, or at Rome, but nowhere else, while a Roman\r\ncould enjoy them everywhere. A citizen of Præneste, for example, could\r\nenjoy them at Præneste or Rome, but not in the neighbouring cities of\r\nTibur or Tusculum: while a Roman could do business in all these cities,\r\nand be supported in all his dealings by the Roman law, which now began\r\ngradually to permeate the whole of Latium. Rome thus had a monopoly of\r\nbusiness with the other cities, which were effectually isolated from\r\neach other. To us this seems a cruel and selfish policy, and so in\r\nitself it was. But we must remember that Rome had been all but destroyed\r\noff the face of the earth, and that the Latins had done nothing, so far\r\nas we know, to help her. To resist another such attack as that of the\r\nGauls, it was absolutely necessary for Rome to control the whole\r\nmilitary resources of Latium, and this she could not do in a loose and\r\nequal federation. She was liable not only to assaults from the Gauls,\r\nbut from Etruscans, and, as we shall see directly, from Samnites, and,\r\nif we find that in the struggle for existence she was at times unjust,\r\nwe may remember that there has hardly been a successful nation of which\r\nthe same might not be said. She saw that Latium must become Roman if\r\neither Rome or the Latins were to survive, and she devised the principle\r\nof isolation with this object.\r\n\r\nFrom this time all Latins served in Roman armies nominally as allies,\r\nbut in reality as subjects; and all Latins who became Roman citizens\r\nserved in the Roman legions. When a military colony was founded, it\r\nmight be either Roman or Latin; but a Latin colony meant not necessarily\r\na collection of Latins; it might admit any one—Roman, Latin or other,\r\nwho threw in his lot with the new city and accepted the two rights of\r\ntrade and marriage described above. Thus the term Latin came to mean not\r\nso much a man of a certain stock as a man with a certain legal position,\r\nand so it continued for many centuries, while the new power rising to\r\nprominence in the world came to be known not as Latin, but as Roman.\r\n\r\nThe last and decisive battle with the Latins took its name, as we saw,\r\nfrom Mount Vesuvius, and the reader who knows the map of Italy will ask\r\nhow it came to be fought so far south of Latium, in the large and\r\nfertile plain of Campania, near the modern city of Naples. The answer is\r\nthat a powerful State, such as Rome was now becoming, is liable to be\r\nappealed to by weaker communities when in trouble; and the Campanians,\r\nattacked by the hill-men from the central mountainous region of the\r\nSamnites, had appealed for help to Rome. This was given, but the Romans\r\nfound it necessary to make peace with these Samnites, and left the\r\nCampanians in the lurch, and then the latter threw in their lot with the\r\nLatins, and the Latin war drifted south to Campania. At the end of that\r\nwar they were treated in much the same way as the Latins; and thus Rome\r\nnow found herself presiding with irresistible force over a territory\r\nthat included both the plains of western Italy and all its most valuable\r\nland, and over a confederacy in which all the advantages were on her\r\nside, and all the resources of the members under her control.\r\n\r\nBut to be mistress of these two plains was not as yet to be mistress of\r\nItaly. Those plains, and especially the southern and more valuable one,\r\nhad to be defended from the mountaineers of the central highlands of the\r\npeninsula: a region which the reader should at this point of our story\r\nstudy carefully in his map. Towards the end of the Latin war these\r\nhighlanders, Samnites, as the Romans called them, had ceased raiding the\r\nCampanian plain, for they in their turn had to defend southern Italy\r\nagainst an unexpected enemy. The strong and wealthy Greek merchant-city\r\nof Tarentum, just inside the “heel” of Italy, destined to play an\r\nimportant part in Italian history for the next century, had lately had\r\nits lands raided by the Samnites and their kin the Lucanians to the\r\nsouth of them, and had called in Greeks from oversea to help them. Here\r\nwe come into touch with Greek history, just at the time when Alexander\r\nthe Great was the leading figure in the Greek world. A Spartan king came\r\nover to aid Tarentum, and lost his life in so doing; then Alexander of\r\nEpirus was induced to come, an uncle of the great conqueror: and after a\r\nperiod of success against the Samnites, he was assassinated. It is said\r\nthat Rome came to an understanding with him, and it is likely enough;\r\nthere must have been men in the great Council at Rome who were already\r\naccustomed to look far ahead, and keep themselves informed of what was\r\ngoing on far away in Italy and even beyond the Italian seas. Her long\r\nstruggle for existence had taught her venerable statesmen the arts of\r\ndiplomacy, and we are not surprised to learn that after the death of\r\nAlexander she began to form alliances in that far country between the\r\nSamnites and Tarentum, much of which was rich and fertile, in order that\r\nwhen the inevitable struggle with the hill-men should come, she might\r\nhave them enclosed between two foes—herself and Latium on the north and\r\nwest, and the Apulians and Greeks in the south and east. It seemed as if\r\nher power and prestige must continually go forward, or collapse\r\naltogether; the same alternative that faced the English in India in the\r\neighteenth century and later. In neither case did the advancing power\r\nfully realise what the future was to be.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable struggle with the Samnites came, and lasted many years.\r\nWe need not pursue it in detail, and indeed the details are quite\r\nuntrustworthy as they have come down to us; but one episode in it is\r\ntold so explicitly and has become so famous, that it deserves a place in\r\nour sketch as showing that hard feeling of national self-interest,\r\nwithout a touch of chivalry, that is gradually emerging as the guide of\r\nRoman action in her progress towards universal dominion.\r\n\r\nA strong Roman army, under the command of both consuls, was pushing to\r\nthe south through the mountains, and fell into a trap in a defile called\r\nthe Caudine Forks,[3] a name never forgotten by the Romans. All attempts\r\nto escape were vain, and they were forced to capitulate. The terms\r\ndictated by Pontius the Samnite general were these: the consuls were to\r\nbind themselves on behalf of the Senate to agree to evacuate Samnium and\r\nCampania and the fortresses (_coloniæ_) which had been planted there,\r\nand to make peace with the Samnites as with an equal power. The consuls\r\nbound themselves by a solemn rite, and the army was allowed to go home,\r\nafter being sent under the yoke, _i.e._ under a kind of archway\r\nconsisting of one spear resting on two upright ones: this was an old\r\nItalian custom of dealing with a conquered army, which may have\r\noriginally had a religious signification. When the disgraced legions\r\nreached Rome, and the consuls summoned the Senate to ratify their bond\r\nwith Pontius, the Fathers, as they were called, positively refused to do\r\nso. The consuls and all who had made themselves responsible for the\r\nterms were sent back to Pontius as his prisoners, _but not the army_.\r\nHis indignation was great, for he knew that Samnium had lost her chance,\r\nand would never have it again. The consuls, of course, had no power to\r\nbind the Senate, and the Samnite terms were such as the Senate could not\r\naccept as the result of a single disaster caused by a general’s blunder:\r\nthat was not the way in which the Romans carried on war. But the\r\ndisgraced army should have been sent back too, and the Senate and people\r\nknew it. The speech which the later Roman historian puts into the mouth\r\nof Pontius to express his indignation, shows that some feeling of shame\r\nat this dishonourable action had come down in the minds of many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe last effort of this long struggle against Rome was a desperate\r\nattempt to combine the forces of Samnites, Etruscans and Gauls: the idea\r\nwas to separate her armies and thus crush her in detail. Even this was a\r\nfailure, and without going into the doubtful stories of the fighting, we\r\nmay ask why it was so. Beyond all doubt the Roman power was for a time\r\nin very great peril; but in the end it prevailed, and this is a good\r\nmoment for pausing to think about the advantages that Rome’s genius for\r\norganisation had secured for herself; advantages which no other Italian\r\nstock seemed able to acquire.\r\n\r\nFirst, she had learnt how to use with profit her geographical position;\r\nto north, south and east she could send armies to strike in different\r\ndirections at the same time; and she must have devised some means\r\n(though we do not know the method) of keeping up communication between\r\nthese armies. The stories seem to suggest that the commanders of this\r\nperiod belonged to a very few noble families whose members had spent\r\ntheir whole lives in fighting—not indeed merely in fighting battles, but\r\nin carrying on war: the Fabii and Papirii are particularly prominent.\r\nThese veterans must have come to know the art of war thoroughly, as it\r\ncould then be applied in Italy, and also the details of the country in\r\nwhich they had to fight.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the efforts of these tough old heroes were admirably seconded\r\nby the home government, _i.e._ the Senate, because this assembly\r\nconsisted of men of the like military experience, and the leaders among\r\nthem were themselves generals, men who had been consuls and had led\r\narmies. Though at this very time, as we shall see, there was a strong\r\ntendency towards popular government, yet in the direction of war we find\r\nno sign that the monopoly of the old families was questioned; and as\r\ntheir interests and their experience were all of the same type, they\r\ncould act together with a unanimity which was probably unknown to their\r\nenemies. The fact that Rome always at this time, and indeed at all\r\ntimes, negotiated and kept in touch with the _aristocracies_ in the\r\nItalian cities, shows how completely the noble families had gained\r\ncontrol over the management of diplomacy as well as war.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Rome was now beginning to learn the art of securing the\r\nconquered country by means of military roads and fortresses (_coloniæ_):\r\nan art to which she held firmly throughout her history, and to which the\r\ngeography even of Roman Britain bears ample testimony. My readers will\r\ndo well to fix their attention for a moment on three of these colonies\r\nwhich were founded during this long war; they are by no means the only\r\nones, but they serve well to show the extent of the Roman power in Italy\r\nat this time, as well as the means taken to secure it. The first is\r\nNarnia, far up the Tiber valley (founded 299 B.C.) on a military road\r\nafterwards known as the Flaminian Way: this was an outpost, with quick\r\ncommunication with Rome, against both Etruscans and Gauls. The second,\r\nFregellæ, a city with a sad future, was some seventy miles to the\r\nsouth-east of Rome, on a road called the Latin Way, but beyond the\r\nlimits of Latium proper, commanding, in fact, the passes between Latium\r\nand Campania; it was in a beautiful situation near the junction of two\r\nrivers, and became in time a most prosperous city. For the third colony\r\nwe must look much further south on the map, at the south-eastern end of\r\nthe mass of the Samnite highlands: this was Venusia, with 20,000\r\ncolonists, destined to separate the Samnites from the Greeks and other\r\ninhabitants of the heel and toe of Italy. It stood on the most famous of\r\nall the great roads, the Via Appia, which after leaving Rome ran nearer\r\nthe coast than the Latin Way, but joined it in Campania, and then ran\r\nacross the hilly country to Venusia, and eventually to Brundisium\r\n(Brindisi), which also became a colony fifty years later.\r\n\r\nThese three advantages, duly considered, will help the reader to\r\nunderstand to some extent how the prize of Italian presidency fell to\r\nRome and not to another city: and they will also explain why Rome\r\nemerged safe and stronger than ever from another peril that was now to\r\nthreaten her existence.\r\n\r\nThe great colony of Venusia, as we saw, was meant to separate the Greeks\r\nof southern Italy from the highlanders of Samnium. Of the Greek cities\r\nby far the most powerful was Tarentum, then ruled by a selfish and\r\nill-conditioned democracy, apt to be continually worrying its\r\nneighbours. That Rome should sooner or later come into collision with\r\nTarentum was inevitable; but the Senate tried to avoid this, knowing\r\nthat the Tarentines would appeal to some Greek power beyond sea to help\r\nthem. Now just across the Adriatic, in Epirus, there was a king of Greek\r\ndescent who was looking out for a chance of glory by imitating Alexander\r\nthe Great; for Alexander’s marvellous career had stirred up a restless\r\nspirit of adventure in the free-lances of the generation that succeeded\r\nhim. Pyrrhus seems to have fancied that he could act the part of a\r\nknight-errant in freeing the Greeks of the west from the barbarians—from\r\nthe Romans that is, and the Carthaginians, who were at the moment in\r\nalliance. When the inevitable quarrel with Rome came, and Tarentum\r\ninvited him, he crossed the sea with a small but capable force,\r\ndetermined to put an end to this new power that was threatening to\r\nswallow up the Greek cities. But he had to learn, and through him the\r\nGreek world had to learn as a whole, that the new power was made of\r\nsterner stuff than any that had yet arisen in the Mediterranean basin.\r\n\r\nPyrrhus began with a victory, not far from Tarentum; it was won chiefly\r\nby some elephants which he had brought with him to frighten the Roman\r\ncavalry. This shook the loyalty of many Italian communities, but the\r\nSenate was unmoved. The ablest diplomatist in Pyrrhus’s service made no\r\nimpression on that body of resolute men, trained by long experience to\r\nlook on a single defeat as only a “regrettable incident” in a long war.\r\n“Rome never negotiates while foreign troops are on Italian soil;” so,\r\naccording to the story, the aged Appius Claudius told the Greek envoy in\r\nthe Senate-house. Then Pyrrhus tried a march on Rome; but he had to\r\nlearn, like another invader after him, that the nearer he drew to the\r\ncity the more difficult his task became. A second victory was far less\r\ndecisive and almost fruitless, and Pyrrhus most unwisely evacuated\r\nItaly. Tarentum had turned against him, unwilling to submit to his\r\ndiscipline, and now that wayward city fell a victim to the Roman power.\r\nThe king crossed to Sicily to deliver the Sicilian Greeks from Carthage,\r\nand this he did brilliantly, but there, too, the fickle Greeks grew\r\ntired of him. Returning to Italy, he fought one more battle with the\r\nRomans, at Beneventum in Samnium, and lost it. Foiled everywhere, he\r\nleft Italy, with Rome more firmly established than ever in the supremacy\r\nof the whole peninsula: for Tarentum, with its fine harbour, its almost\r\nimpregnable citadel, and its fleet, fell soon afterwards into the hands\r\nof the Romans.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole Italian peninsula was now Roman; or perhaps it is truer\r\nto say that Rome had become an Italian state. It was a wonderful work:\r\nperhaps the most wonderful that Rome ever achieved. The military part of\r\nit was the result mainly of _constantia_, steady perseverance and\r\nrefusal to accept defeat; the political organisation was the result of\r\ngood sense and good temper combined with an inflexible will, and a\r\nshrewd perception of the real and permanent interests of Rome. In the\r\nthird century B.C., at which we have now arrived, Italy may be described\r\nas a kind of federation, in which each city has its own alliance with\r\nthe leading one, and no alliance with any other. Each has its own\r\ngovernment and administers its own law, but places all its military\r\nresources at the disposal of the Roman government. The fighting power of\r\nthe future was to be Italy under Roman leadership, and all questions of\r\nforeign policy were decided by Rome alone. There was no general council\r\nof the whole confederacy. The Roman Senate controlled an ever-increasing\r\nmass of detailed and varied business, having to deal with Latins,\r\nItalians of the old stocks, Etruscans, Greeks and Gauls. How the\r\nbusiness was done we cannot tell: not a single contemporary record of it\r\nis left. One glimpse of that wonderful Senate at work would be worth all\r\ndescriptions of the battles of that century.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the third century B.C. that Senate, instead of\r\ndirecting a further steady advance, had been forced to defend the State\r\nagainst an invader, in the most terrible life and death struggle ever\r\nexperienced by any people. But in the next chapter I must pause to try\r\nand explain wherein consisted the nerve-power, the mental and material\r\nfibre, of the people destined to rule the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                  THE TRAINING OF THE ROMAN CHARACTER\r\n\r\n\r\nI have mentioned some outward circumstances which gave Rome an early\r\ntraining in war and diplomacy, and in particular her geographical\r\nposition, exposing her to constant attack, and yet giving her good\r\nchance of striking back and advancing. But to accomplish all that was\r\ntold of her in the last chapter, more than this was surely needed. There\r\nmust have been a quality in this people, individually and as a whole,\r\nfitting them to withstand so much storm and stress, and to emerge from\r\ndisaster with renewed strength to take in hand the work of conquest and\r\ngovernment. We need not, indeed, assume that the people of this one city\r\nwere naturally of stronger character than others, than their kinsfolk of\r\nthe Latin cities or other Italians of the same great race. All these\r\nimmigrating stocks, which spread themselves, long before history begins,\r\nover a primitive population of which we know little or nothing, were\r\nprobably much the same in physical and mental build; a fact which will\r\nhelp us to understand how they all came eventually to be able to unite\r\ntogether as the centre of a great empire. But the quality or character,\r\nwhich I am to try and explain in this chapter, was more strongly stamped\r\nupon the citizens of Rome than on those of other cities, owing to the\r\nmore continual call for them in her case; for all our qualities and\r\nhabits can be made more sure and lasting by constant exercise.\r\n\r\nDiscipline and duty are the two words which best explain, if they do not\r\nexactly express, the quality here meant; the habit of obedience to\r\nauthority, which is the necessary condition of the power of governing,\r\nand that sense of duty which lies at the root of the habit and the\r\npower. This aptitude for discipline and this sense of duty can be traced\r\nboth in the private and the public life of early Rome, in the life of\r\nthe family and in the life of the State. Let us be clear at once that\r\nthe individual as such was not as yet an important item of society;\r\nsociety was based on a system of groups, and the individual played no\r\npart in it in these early times except as the member of a group, either\r\na group of kin (_gens_), or a local and administrative group (_pagus_,\r\n_curia_). But the only group with which we are concerned in this little\r\nbook, the smallest of all, was the _familia_, another of those immortal\r\nwords which we have inherited from the Latin language. This shall be\r\nexplained first, in order to find the discipline and duty of that family\r\nlife: then we will take the State, and follow out the same habits\r\nreproducing themselves in a more complicated social and political union.\r\n\r\nThis word _familia_ did not mean exactly what we mean by family;\r\nhousehold would perhaps come nearer to it, if we understand by household\r\na group of individuals supporting itself on the land. It meant not only\r\nfather, mother, and children, but also their dependents, whether bond or\r\nfree. These, if bond, were slaves (_servi_), prisoners of war and the\r\nchildren of such prisoners, or persons who had forfeited their liberty\r\nby debt: if free, they were clients, who for some reason had become\r\nattached to the _familia_ in an inferior position, and looked to it for\r\nsubsistence and protection. And our picture is not complete unless we\r\ntake into account also the divine members of the group, dwelling in the\r\nhouse or on the land, to whom the human members looked for protection\r\nand prosperity in all the walks of life. Chief among these were the\r\nspirit of the hearth-fire, Vesta; Penates, the spirits of the\r\nstore-closet and its contents: the Lar, the guardian spirit of the\r\ncultivated land, or, as some think, of a departed ancestor; and the\r\nGenius of the head of the family, which enabled him to beget children\r\nand so continue the collective life of the group. Though these\r\nspirits—they are hardly yet deities—naturally seem to us mere fancies of\r\nthe primitive Roman mind, they were to that mind itself as real and\r\nactive as any human member of the group, and we must try to think of\r\nthem as such, for they played a very important part in the development\r\nof the quality we wish to realise.\r\n\r\nNow this group, or rather the human part of it, lived under a very\r\nsimple and effective form of government. It was under the absolute\r\ncontrol of a head, the father and husband; or, if more than one family\r\nlived together, the oldest living father and husband. Over wife and\r\nchildren he had a father’s power (_patria potestas_), and they were said\r\nto be in his _hand_; over the slaves he had a master’s power\r\n(_dominium_): to his clients he was _patronus_, or quasi-father. His\r\npower over wife and children was absolute, but it was kept from being\r\narbitrary by a wholesome custom, of immense importance in all its\r\nresults throughout Roman history, of seeking the advice of a council of\r\nrelations before taking any extreme step in the way of punishment for\r\nserious offences. This was an obligation, a duty, on his part, enforced\r\nby no law, but by what may be well called an even more powerful\r\nsovereign than law—the custom of the ancestors (_mos majorum_). His\r\npower over his client, or his freed slave if he had any such, was\r\nrestrained by customs of mutual obligation, which eventually found their\r\nway into law. His power over his slaves was, however, not only absolute\r\nbut arbitrary, and so continued down to the latest period of Roman\r\nhistory; yet the slave, we must not forget, was really a member of the\r\n_familia_, and as such was probably treated as a human being, necessary\r\nto the life of the group, and even partaking to some extent in its\r\nreligious worship.\r\n\r\nLet us see how this system of government would work out in the practical\r\nlife of a _familia_ settled on the land, as all such groups were during\r\nat least a great part of the period we have been tracing: for the city\r\nitself was mainly used as a fortress, into which the farming families\r\nwould come in time of peril, and in which they would in course of time\r\npossess a town dwelling as well as a farm, like the leading families of\r\nour English shires in the Middle Ages. The paterfamilias directed all\r\nthe operations of the farm, no one disputing his authority: and he\r\ndecided all quarrels among his subjects and punished all offences. The\r\nnecessary work of the house, the cooking, and the spinning of wool for\r\nthe garments of the members (which were then entirely woollen), he left\r\nto his wife and daughters: and thus the wife came to exercise a kind of\r\nauthority of her own, which raised her far above the position of a\r\n“squaw,” and gave her in course of time a great influence, though an\r\nindirect one, in social life. And not only had all the members their\r\nwork to do, under this strict control, in keeping themselves alive and\r\nclothed, but they all had their duties to the divine members, on whom\r\nthey believed themselves dependent for their health and wealth. There\r\nwere simple acts of worship every day and at every meal, in which the\r\nchildren joined; we may almost think of the Head as a priest and of the\r\nchildren as his acolytes. And at certain days, fixed in ancient times by\r\na council of Heads, and later in the city by a calendar, the families of\r\na district (_pagus_) would join together in religious festivities, after\r\nharvest, for example, or after the autumn sowing, to honour and\r\npropitiate the spirit of the harvested grain or of the sown seed. These\r\nwere often accompanied by games and races, and so the life was saved\r\nfrom becoming too sombre and monotonous. But though discipline was not\r\nallowed to destroy freedom and enjoyment, the life was on the whole a\r\nroutine of command and obedience, of discipline and duty.\r\n\r\nWhat of the education which should perpetuate these habits? Unluckily we\r\nhave no contemporary record of it for these early times, and must guess\r\nat it chiefly from what we know of the bringing up of his son by the\r\nelder Cato, a strenuous believer in the old methods, in the second\r\ncentury B.C. As we might expect, it seems to have been an education in\r\nthe active practical life of the farm, and in reverence, obedience, and\r\nmodesty of demeanour. Cato taught his boy not only to work, to ride, to\r\nbox, and to swim, but to shun all indecency; and was himself “as careful\r\nnot to utter an indecent word before his son, as he would have been in\r\nthe presence of the Vestal virgins.” He wrote histories for his son in\r\nlarge letters, so that he might learn something of the illustrious deeds\r\nof the ancient Romans, and of their customs. In his time an education of\r\nthe mind was beginning to come into vogue, as well as one of the will;\r\nbut in the period we have been surveying this must have been of the most\r\nmeagre kind. Yet it is possible that the idea of active duty to the\r\nState and its deities, as well as to the family and its presiding\r\nspirits, was all the more vividly kept up in the absence of intellectual\r\ninterests. As life in the city became more usual, the boys of good\r\nfamilies had more opportunity of learning what was meant by duty to the\r\nState; they accompanied their fathers to hear funeral orations on\r\neminent citizens, and were even admitted to meetings of the Senate. In\r\nthis way they must have developed a shrewdness and practical sagacity\r\ninvaluable to them in after life.\r\n\r\nThere is a story of a Roman boy, preserved by Cato, which so well\r\nillustrates this and other features of that early Roman life, that I\r\nshall insert it here, whether or no it be strictly true. A boy who had\r\nbeen with his father to the Senate was asked by an inquisitive mother\r\nwhat the Fathers of the Senate had been discussing. The boy answered\r\nthat he was strictly forbidden to tell, which only excited his mother’s\r\ncuriosity the more, and made her press him hard. At last he invented\r\nwhat Cato calls a shrewd and witty falsehood: he said that the Senate\r\nhad been discussing whether it were better for the State that one man\r\nshould have two wives, or one wife two husbands. Much alarmed, she went\r\nand told other matrons, and next day they crowded weeping to the Senate\r\nHouse, to petition that one wife might have two husbands rather than one\r\nhusband two wives. The astonishment of the senators was dispelled by the\r\nboy, who stood out in the midst and told his tale; and from that time no\r\nboy was allowed to be present at debate save this one, who was thus\r\nrewarded for his honesty and shrewdness.\r\n\r\nThis good old Roman story may aptly bring us to the second part of my\r\nsubject in this chapter, the training of the citizen in the service of\r\nthe State. But let us pause here for a moment to consider what was the\r\nRoman idea of the State and its function.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, as in Greece, the State took the form of a city, with more or\r\nless of territory on which to subsist; in the heart of the city was the\r\nlife of the State. And it is true of Italy as of Greece that the process\r\nof rising to the city from the life of farm or village was one of\r\nimmense importance for humanity, enabling man to advance from the idea\r\nof a bare material subsistence to that of moral and intellectual\r\nprogress. This is the advance to what Aristotle called “good life” as\r\ndistinguished from life simply. He meant that in the lower stage man has\r\nnot time or stimulus to develop art, literature, law, philosophy: all\r\nhis strength is spent in struggle and endeavour—struggle partly with\r\nNature, partly with human enemies whom he is ill able to resist. The\r\ncity-state supplied him not only with opportunity for a higher life, but\r\nwith nutriment to maintain it.\r\n\r\nBut the Italians never drew from this new form of social life the same\r\namount, the same quality of nutriment, as did the Greeks. Rome did\r\nindeed draw enough to fertilise the germs of much that was most valuable\r\nin her own character, and to educate herself for the practical work she\r\nwas to do in the world. But the last chapter will have shown that,\r\nunlike most Greek city-states, she was forced by circumstances to\r\ncontinue for centuries a life of struggle and endeavour. She had\r\nconstant difficulty in keeping herself alive and free, and as we shall\r\nsee, she was hardly ever without internal as well as external perils. In\r\nGreece many States found leisure to rest and enjoy the exercise of their\r\nhigher instincts—enjoyment which led to the production of works of art\r\nand literature: leisure, too, to reflect and inquire about Nature in man\r\nand outside him, and so to develop philosophy and science for the\r\neternal benefit of mankind. But all the strength of Rome was used in the\r\nstruggle for existence, which gradually led her on to conquest and\r\ndominion. As we left her at the end of the last chapter, the leading\r\ncity of Italy, she might indeed have passed from struggle to leisure,\r\nand so to thought and inquiry, turning to account the gifts of the\r\nvarious peoples of Italy, Etruscans, Gauls, Greeks, as well as her own\r\nkin. But the long and terrible struggle with Carthage, to be told in the\r\nnext chapter, effectually destroyed this chance. Her strength was spent\r\nwhen it was over, and when her chance came to sit down (so to speak),\r\nand think, she could not do it. Still, her long training in practical\r\nendeavour had its due result; and the ideas of duty and discipline, of\r\nlaw and order, which had carried her through so many perils, never\r\nwholly vanished from the Roman mind. Let us turn to trace the progress\r\nof those ideas in the life of the city-state of Rome.\r\n\r\nWhen we first begin to see clearly into the working of the Roman State,\r\nwhat chiefly strikes us is the unlimited power of the magistrate in all\r\nthe departments of government. Just as the head of the family had an\r\nabsolute power over its members, so had the king (_rex_) an unlimited\r\npower over the citizens. In the family the word for this power was\r\n_potestas_, but in the State it was called _imperium_—one of the\r\ngreatest words ever coined, surviving to the present day in many\r\nfamiliar forms. For the Roman it expressed more strikingly than any\r\nother the idea of discipline in the State: it stamped on his mind the\r\ninherited conviction that lawful authority must be implicitly obeyed.\r\nNot unlawful authority, ill gotten by fraud or violence; for such power\r\nthe word _imperium_ could never be used: but authority entrusted to an\r\nindividual by the human members of the State, and sanctioned by the\r\nconsent of its divine members. For the _imperium_ must be conferred upon\r\nits holder by an act of the people, and the gods must give their consent\r\nby favourable omens; both processes, the passing of the law, and the\r\nobtaining of the _auspicia_, must be gone through according to certain\r\ntraditional methods, and the slightest flaw in these would make the\r\nchoice of the magistrate invalid. But once legally in his hands, the\r\n_imperium_ was irresistible; its outward symbols, the rods and axes of\r\nthe lictors, accompanied its holder wherever he went, to remind the\r\nRoman that the first duty of a citizen was obedience to constituted\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nThis word _imperium_ stood for three different kinds of power. First,\r\nthe king was supreme in matters of religion, for he was responsible for\r\nthe good relations between the human and divine inhabitants of the city,\r\nfor “the peace of the gods” as it was called. If this peace, or\r\ncovenant, were not kept up, it was believed that the State could not\r\nprosper—the very life of the State depended on it.\r\n\r\nBut now let us note a point of the utmost importance in the development\r\nof Roman public life. The king could not perform this duty entirely by\r\nhimself; no single man could have the necessary knowledge of all the\r\ndetails of ancient religious custom. So he was assisted by a small board\r\nof skilled experts called _pontifices_, perhaps also by another board of\r\n_augurs_, skilled in the methods of discovering the divine will by\r\nomens. Thus the _imperium_ in religious matters, though still legally\r\nunlimited, was saved from becoming arbitrary and violating ancestral\r\ncustom: the king is entrusted with power which he uses in accordance\r\nwith the advice of sages.\r\n\r\nSecondly, _imperium_ stood for the supreme judicial power, for the\r\nmaintenance of peace between individual citizens. The king had an\r\nunlimited power not only in deciding disputes but in inflicting\r\npunishments, even that of death. But here again, though his power was\r\nabsolute, it was not arbitrary. Custom governed the State even more than\r\nhe did, and his work was to see that custom was obeyed. In order to make\r\nsure that this duty was rightly performed, he was provided with a\r\ncouncil of elderly men (_senatores_), fathers of families, whose advice\r\ncustom compelled him to ask, though it did not compel him to take it.\r\nHere, then, the exercise of discipline was combined with a sense of duty\r\nand obligation, as in the life of the family; the Senate of the State\r\nwas the same in principle as the council of relations in the family.\r\n\r\nThirdly, _imperium_ stood for the absolute power of the commander in\r\nwar: and here, as we might expect, custom seems hardly to have\r\ninterfered with it. A Roman king in war was outside the custom of his\r\nown State, beyond the reach of the protection of his own deities, and\r\nunder the influence of unknown ones. Both before starting on a campaign,\r\nand before entering the city on its return, the army had to undergo\r\ncertain religious rites, which show how nervous even Romans were about\r\nleaving their own land and gods. Custom could not rule here, and the\r\npower of the general in the field remained throughout Roman history not\r\nonly absolute but arbitrary. Doubtless he could, and often did, not only\r\nask advice but take it, but he was never even morally obliged to do so:\r\nin this one department of State activity the wise judgment of the Romans\r\nleft the _imperium_ practically unhampered.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the _imperium_ in the hands of the chief magistrate, the\r\nfoundation-stone of the Roman government in all periods. But what of the\r\npeople who obeyed it? Of the people we unluckily know hardly anything\r\nuntil nearly the end of the monarchical period. We do, indeed, know\r\nthat, as in many Greek city-states, there was a privileged and an\r\nunprivileged class, and of these two classes a word shall be said\r\ndirectly. What needs here to be made clear is how this population was\r\nplaced as regards duty and discipline, and our first real knowledge of\r\nthis dates traditionally from the reign of the last king but one. Here\r\nwe find the whole free population, privileged and unprivileged, serving\r\nin the army as a civic duty, and paying such taxes as were necessary\r\nmainly for military purposes. They served without pay, and the\r\ninfantry—that is, by far the greater part, provided their own arms and\r\nequipment; the cavalry were provided with horses by the State, for\r\nhorses were expensive. Those who had most property were considered as\r\nhaving the largest stake in the State, and therefore as bound to bear\r\nthe heaviest burden. This may be seen in the order of the army for\r\nbattle, for those who could afford the best equipment fought in front,\r\nthe poorest and worst armed in the rear. This was the wholesome\r\nprinciple that governed the Roman army during the period of advance and\r\nconquest in Italy. It was an army of citizens (_populus_), all of whom\r\nserved as a matter of duty, and paid taxes as a matter of duty according\r\nto their means, leaving all command to the holder of _imperium_, and the\r\nofficers whom he appointed to carry out his orders.\r\n\r\nThus when the last king was expelled, and the kingship came to an end,\r\nthe people were thoroughly well trained in the ideas of duty and\r\ndiscipline, and the practical results of such a training were obedience\r\nas a habit, respect for authority and knowledge, steadiness and coolness\r\nin danger. This people did not give way to excitement, either in civil\r\nor military crises. They not only obeyed their rulers, but trusted them.\r\nThey were not much given to talking, but contented themselves with\r\naction: and as talk is a more effective stimulus to quarrelling than\r\naction, they did not as yet quarrel. Though Rome was destined to pass\r\nthrough many political as well as military dangers in the generations to\r\ncome, it was nearly four centuries before blood was shed in civil strife\r\nin her streets.\r\n\r\nI must close this chapter with a very brief sketch of the political\r\nhistory of the period of advance in Italy, in order to show how their\r\ntraining in duty and discipline kept the people steady and sound at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAfter the expulsion of the last king the Roman State became a\r\n_respublica_—that is, literally translated, a public thing—or as we may\r\nperhaps call it, a free State. This is another of the immortal words\r\nbequeathed to modern European language by Latin speech, and its meaning\r\nis still the same for us as it was for the Romans. When Cicero, almost\r\nat the end of the life of the Roman free State, wrote to a friend, “We\r\nhave completely lost the _respublica_,” he meant that it had passed from\r\npublic management into the hands of private and irresponsible\r\nindividuals. What were the essential marks of this “public thing,” or\r\nfree State? As we might expect, they are to be found in the treatment of\r\nthe _imperium_, the governmental centre of gravity, by the founders of\r\nthe _respublica_.\r\n\r\n1. To abolish the _imperium_ was out of the question; no Roman ever\r\ndreamed of such a thing, for it would be like digging up the foundations\r\nof a building already in part constructed. But the _imperium_ was no\r\nlonger to be held for life, nor to be held by a single person. It was\r\nnow to be entrusted to two magistrates instead of one, and for a year\r\nonly; at the end of the year the holders, henceforward to be called\r\nConsuls or Prætors, were to lay down their insignia and resign their\r\npower, becoming simply private citizens again. Meanwhile new consuls had\r\nbeen elected; and the voice of the whole people was to be heard in the\r\nelection, for it was to be effected by the army of citizens, arranged\r\naccording to property as in military service. Every Roman who was to\r\nobey the _imperium_ was to have a voice in the election of its holders,\r\nbut those who had most stake in the State, and served in the front ranks\r\nin war, were to have a preponderating voice.\r\n\r\n2. The dread _imperium_ was now not only limited in the period of its\r\ntenure, but the possibility of an arbitrary use of it was averted in two\r\nways. First, the two consuls had a veto on each other’s action, and both\r\nat home and in the field they took it in turn to exercise the\r\n_imperium_. Secondly, they could not put a citizen to death in the city\r\nunless the people in their assembly sanctioned it; in the field the\r\nRomans wisely left the _imperium_ unlimited, feeling, as we still feel,\r\nthat military discipline needs a more forceful sanction than civil. And\r\nbesides these two restrictions, the council of elders, the Senate, was\r\nretained to act as a general advising body for the consuls, who,\r\nhowever, themselves had the power of filling up vacancies in it from\r\ntime to time. We do not know exactly what its composition was at this\r\ntime; but it is certain that all who had held the _imperium_ had seats\r\nin it, as men whose service and experience best entitled them to advise\r\nand criticise their successors. This principle, that ex-magistrates\r\nshould be members of the Senate, was adhered to at all times, and\r\neventually made this great council into the most effective assembly of\r\nmen of capacity and experience in practical life that the world has ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave the _imperium_, for the present, one interesting fact\r\nmust be noted. The Romans were not afraid to withdraw for a time these\r\nrestrictions on the magistrate’s power, and to revert to absolute\r\ngovernment, if they thought it necessary for the safety of the State. In\r\nmoments of great peril, civil or military, the consul, on the advice of\r\nthe Senate, would appoint a single individual to hold office for a fixed\r\ntime with unlimited _imperium_; and in this case the assembly was not\r\ncalled on even to ratify the choice, so great was the trust reposed in\r\nthe Fathers of the State. They did not call this single magistrate by\r\nthe hated name of Rex, but used another word well known in Latium,\r\nDictator. The institution was of the utmost value to a people constantly\r\nin a state of struggle and endeavour, and shows well the practical\r\nsagacity which a long training in duty and discipline had already\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nBut this practical sagacity was to be put to many a hard test in the\r\nperiod we sketched in the last chapter. No sooner was the _respublica_\r\nestablished, than a great question pressed for solution, that of the\r\nmutual relations of the privileged and unprivileged classes. What was\r\nreally the origin of this distinction of class we do not yet know, and\r\nperhaps never shall. Here the fact must suffice, that the privileged,\r\nthe patricians as they were called, the representatives of families\r\nbelonging to the old clans (_gentes_) were alone deemed capable of\r\npreserving the peace between citizens and gods, or between the citizens\r\nthemselves, and therefore they alone could hold the _imperium_ and take\r\nthe auspices. Both classes served in the army and voted at elections,\r\nbut without the chance of holding the _imperium_ the plebeians were\r\nhelpless. Yet it is quite certain that they had grievances of their own,\r\nand real ones. We must think of them as in the main small holders of\r\nland, with little or no capital, and constantly obliged to borrow either\r\nin the form of money or stock. They became debtors to the rich, who\r\nwould usually be the patricians, and the old customary law of debt was\r\nhard and even savage.\r\n\r\nThe result of this was, according to the traditional story, that once at\r\nleast, if not twice, they actually _struck_; they left their work and\r\nwent off in a body, threatening to found a new city some miles farther\r\nup the Tiber. They knew well that they were indispensable to the State\r\nas soldiers, and the patricians knew it too. Fortunately, the plebeians\r\nalso knew that the State, with all its traditions of religion and\r\ngovernment, of duty and discipline, was indispensable to themselves.\r\nThey knew nothing of the forms and formulæ which were deemed necessary\r\nfor the maintenance of peace with gods and men. They could not carry\r\naway with them the gods of the city, under whose protection they and\r\ntheir forefathers had lived. They would simply be adrift, without oars\r\nor rudder, and such a position was absolutely unthinkable. So they\r\nreturned to the city—so the story runs—and the result was a compromise,\r\nthe first of a long series of compromises which finally made Rome into a\r\ncompact and united commonwealth, and enabled her to tide over three\r\ncenturies of continual struggle and endeavour. The story of these\r\ncompromises is too long and complicated to be told in this book, but the\r\nsuccessive stages can briefly be pointed out.\r\n\r\nSoon after the strike, or secession, the plebeians were authorised to\r\nelect magistrates, or more strictly officers, of their own, to protect\r\nthem from any arbitrary use of the _imperium_; these were called\r\nTribunes, because the assembly that chose them was arranged according to\r\ntribes, local divisions in which both patricians and plebeians were\r\nregistered for taxpaying purposes. The good-will of the patricians in\r\nmaking this concession is seen in the fact that the tribunes of the\r\nplebs (as they were henceforward called), were placed under the\r\nprotection of the gods (_sacrosancti_), so that any one violating them\r\nwas made liable to divine anger. As the plebeians grew more numerous and\r\nindispensable, their assembly and officers became steadily more\r\npowerful, and eventually won the right to pass laws binding the whole\r\nState.\r\n\r\nAgain, it was not long before their ignorance of the customary law and\r\nits methods of procedure found a remedy. A code of law was drawn up in\r\ntwelve tables, containing partly old customs now for the first time\r\nwritten down, partly new rules, some of them perhaps imported from\r\nAthens. Of this code we still possess many fragments, which show plainly\r\nthat it was meant for all citizens, whatever their social standing. “The\r\nidea of legislating for a class ... is strikingly absent. The code is\r\nthoroughly Roman in its caution and good sense, its respect for the\r\npast, which it disregards only when old customs violate the rules of\r\ncommon sense, and its judicious disregard of symmetry.”[4] As the\r\nhistorian Tacitus said of it long afterwards, it was “the consummation\r\nof equal right.” And it was the source of the whole mighty river of\r\nRoman law, ever increasing in volume, which still serves to irrigate the\r\nfield of modern European civilisation.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a long and bitter contest before the plebeians forced\r\ntheir way into the central patrician stronghold of the _imperium_, but\r\neven this was accomplished without civil war or bloodshed. We hear of a\r\nseries of evasive manœuvres by the patricians, who naturally believed\r\nthat all would go wrong if the duty of keeping “the peace of the gods”\r\nwere committed to men whom the gods could not be supposed to take count\r\nof. But these patrician consuls and senators were responsible for the\r\nState’s existence, and it could not exist without the plebeians; the two\r\nclasses were authorised by law to intermarry, which (strange to say) had\r\nbeen unlawful hitherto, and then the old class-feeling and prejudice,\r\nfar exceeding in force any such feeling known to us now, gradually\r\nsubsided. By the middle of the fourth century B.C., not only could a\r\nplebeian be consul, but one of the two consuls _must_ be a plebeian. And\r\nbefore that century was over the old patrician nobility was beginning to\r\ndisappear, giving way to a new one based on the leading idea of _good\r\nservice done for the State_. If a man had held the consulship, no matter\r\nwhether he were patrician or plebeian, he became _nobilis_—_i.e._\r\ndistinguished—and so, too, did his family. The great Roman aristocracy\r\nof later times consisted of the descendants of men who had thus become\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter with a few words about one remarkable\r\ninstitution which well illustrates the Roman instinct for duty and\r\ndiscipline. It was in this period, 443 B.C., according to the\r\ntraditional date, that a new magistracy was established, intended at\r\nfirst merely to relieve the consuls of difficult duties for which in\r\nthat warlike age they had no sufficient leisure, but destined eventually\r\nto become even a higher object of ambition than the consulship itself.\r\nThe Roman love of order made it necessary to be sure that every citizen\r\nwas justly and legally a citizen, that he fulfilled his duties in the\r\narmy, and paid his taxes according to a right estimate of his property.\r\nEvery four or five years an inquiry had to be made with this object in\r\nview, and two censors, holding office for a year and a half, were now\r\nelected to undertake it. These censors, though they had no _imperium_,\r\nwere irresponsible; their decisions were final, and they could not be\r\ncalled to account for any official act. They were almost always—in later\r\ntimes invariably—reverend seniors who had held the consulship, men in\r\nwhose justice and wisdom the people could put implicit confidence. And\r\nsuch confidence was needed; for their power of examination easily became\r\nextended from details of registration to the personal conduct of the\r\ncitizen in almost every relation of life. All heads of families might be\r\nquestioned about their performance of family duties, and any shameful\r\ncruelty to a slave, or injustice to a client, or neglect of children,\r\nmight be punished by removal from the list of tribesmen; and this meant\r\nloss of civil rights, and _infamia_ (civic disgrace), a terrible word,\r\ngreatly dreaded by the Roman. Neglect of land or other property, useless\r\nluxury, bad faith in contracts or legal guardianship—all came in course\r\nof time to be taken count of by the censors. A senator might have his\r\nname struck off the list of the Senate, and a cavalry soldier might be\r\nremoved from the roll, if the horse provided him by the State were ill\r\ncared for, or if in any other way he were deemed unworthy of his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIt may be hard for us to understand how such a power of inquisition can\r\nhave been submitted to in a free State. But apart from the age and\r\nstanding of the holders of this office, and the Roman habit of obedience\r\nto constituted authority, there are two facts that will help us to\r\nunderstand it. One is simple: the censors were _collegæ_ like the\r\nconsuls; each had a veto on the action of the other, and if that veto\r\nwere not used, if they were unanimous in condemning a citizen, the\r\nauthority of their decision was naturally irresistible. The other fact\r\nis harder for a modern to understand. There was a religious element in\r\nthe work of the censors; the final act of a censorship was the religious\r\n“purification” (_lustratio_) of the whole citizen body, with sacrifice\r\nand prayer, in the field of Mars outside the walls of the city. What\r\nexactly a Roman of that day believed, or rather felt, to be the result\r\nof this rite, we can only guess; but we can be sure that he was\r\nconvinced that the life of the State would be imperilled without it, and\r\nthat this conviction was strong enough to compel him to submit to the\r\nwhole process of which it was the consummation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                THE STRUGGLE WITH CARTHAGE AND HANNIBAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these days sober students of history wisely leave the oft-told\r\nstories of war and battle, and busy themselves rather with questions of\r\nsocial life, public and private economy, and the history of religion,\r\nmorals and scientific inquiry. But there are a few wars, great struggles\r\nof nation against nation, which will always have an absorbing interest:\r\npartly because of their dramatic character, partly because of their\r\nfar-reaching consequences; and the long fight between Rome and Carthage\r\nis assuredly one of these. On the Carthaginian side it produced two of\r\nthe most extraordinary men, father and son, of whom history has anywhere\r\nto tell; and on the Roman side it gives us a vivid picture of the most\r\nmarvellous endurance during long years of extreme peril that we can find\r\nin the annals of any people. And probably no war was ever so pregnant of\r\nresults for good and ill alike. It welded the whole of Italy south of\r\nthe Alps into a united country under the rule of Rome, and launched the\r\nRomans on a new career of conquest beyond the sea; it laid the\r\nfoundations of the Roman Empire as we now think of that great system.\r\nYet it left Italy in a state of economic distress from which it is\r\nhardly untrue to say that she has never fully recovered, and it changed\r\nthe character of the Roman people, rich and poor alike, for the worse\r\nrather than the better.\r\n\r\nIn order to see clearly how it came about, we must once more look at the\r\nmap of Italy; a map of modern Italy will do well enough. Let the reader\r\nremember that as yet Rome had control only over the central and southern\r\nparts of the whole of what is now the kingdom of Italy, and that two\r\nother parts of that kingdom, which every Italian now regards as\r\nessential to its unity, were in other hands. These were: first, the\r\ngreat alluvial plain of the river Po (Padus); secondly, the island of\r\nSicily: strategically speaking, these lie on the two flanks of the Roman\r\ndominion, to north and south respectively. Any power holding central\r\nItaly, to be safe from invasion, must be in possession of these two\r\npositions, as a long series of wars has clearly shown, beginning with\r\nthe two now to be sketched. The magnificent plain of the Po, stretching\r\nfrom the great Alpine barrier to the Apennines which look down on the\r\nGulf of Genoa, the richest land in all Italy, was then in the hands of\r\nwarlike Gallic tribes, who had settled there before the time when they\r\nstruck southward and captured Rome itself; these might again become a\r\nserious danger, as indeed they proved to be in this very war. The island\r\nof Sicily was, and had long been, a bone of contention between the Greek\r\nsettlers who had long ago built cities on the most favourable points of\r\nits coast, and the traders of the Phœnician city of Carthage just\r\nopposite to it on the coast of Africa. Sicily was rich in harbours, and\r\nlike the plain of the Po, also rich in corn, olive, and vine; and the\r\nGreeks had held on to it so persistently that with the recent help of\r\nPyrrhus they had for a moment been in almost complete possession of the\r\nisland. But they foolishly deserted Pyrrhus at the critical moment, and\r\nnow again the Carthaginians had recovered it, all but the kingdom of\r\nHiero of Syracuse, stretching along the eastern coast under Mount Etna.\r\nCarthaginian fleets cruised round the island, and were often seen off\r\nthe coasts of Italy as well. For Carthage was the mistress of the seas\r\nin all the western part of the Mediterranean basin.\r\n\r\nCarthage was a daughter of the Canaanite city of Tyre, belonging to that\r\nseafaring people known in history as Phœnicians, whom the Israelites had\r\npushed down to the coast of Palestine without subduing them. The genius\r\nof the Phœnicians was for trade, and the splendid position of Carthage,\r\nnear the modern Tunis, with a rich corn-growing country in the rear, had\r\nhelped her merchant princes to establish by degrees what may loosely be\r\ncalled an empire of trading settlements extending not only along the\r\nAfrican coast, but over that of Sardinia and southern and eastern Spain,\r\nand including Sicily, as we have seen. To maintain this empire she had\r\nto keep up great fleets, and huge docks in her own port; but as her\r\nPhœnician population was largely occupied with trade, she had to rely\r\nfor her crews and also for her land forces largely on the native\r\nAfricans whom she had subdued, or on mercenaries hired from other races\r\nwith whom she came in contact. Though this was a weak point in her\r\narmour, she was far the greatest power in the western seas, and any\r\nother people ambitious of power in that region would have to reckon with\r\nher. So far she had been on friendly terms with Rome, and we still have\r\nthe text of three treaties between the two states; but the latest of\r\nthese shows signs of mutual distrust, and Rome had now risen so high\r\nthat a collision was all but inevitable. A people ruling in Italy cannot\r\nafford to have a rival in Sicily and also in undisputed command of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe collision came in the year 264 B.C., and it was the immediate result\r\nof an act of bad judgment and also of bad faith on the part of the\r\nRomans. There would be no need to mention this here if it did not\r\nillustrate a trait in the Roman character which is becoming more marked\r\nas Rome is drawn more and more into diplomatic relations with other\r\nstates. The habit of order and discipline at home did not bring with it\r\na sense of justice and honour in dealing with foreigners. The Roman\r\npractical view of life, which did not include education of the mind and\r\nfeeling, was not favourable to the growth of generous conduct except\r\ntowards a fellow-citizen. The Latin word _virtus_, which expresses the\r\npractical duties of a citizen, does not suggest honourable dealing\r\noutside the civic boundary. Some mental imagination was needed for\r\nhigher aims to make themselves felt in public life; “slimness,” as the\r\nBoers of the Transvaal used to call it, is too often characteristic of\r\nRoman diplomacy; and hardness, not always stopping short of cruelty, is\r\nhenceforward constantly to be found in their conduct towards a beaten\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\nA rascally band of mercenaries, Italians by birth, who had been in the\r\nSyracusan service, had seized on the old Greek city of Messana—the same\r\nMessina which quite recently met with so terrible a fate in the great\r\nearthquake. The city lay on the Sicilian side of the strait which still\r\nbears its name, and looked at from an Italian point of view, might be\r\ncalled the key to Sicily. Exactly opposite to it was Rhegium (Reggio),\r\nanother Greek city which had been treated in the same way by another\r\nband of brigands; but these had been at once cleared out by orders from\r\nRome. In the case of Messana the task naturally developed on Hiero, the\r\nking of Syracuse, a young man of ability who had lately made a treaty\r\nwith Rome; but when he made the attempt, the brigands appealed for help\r\nboth to Rome and to Carthage. The plain duty of the Senate was to\r\nsupport their ally Hiero, or to leave the applicants to their fate. But\r\nthe Carthaginians might then establish themselves at Messana, and that\r\nmust have seemed to a Roman a thing not to be permitted. The Senate\r\nhesitated for once, and finally referred the matter to the people, who\r\nvoted to support the mercenaries against an ally of the Roman State.\r\nThis act of bad faith and bad policy cost the Romans a valuable ally,\r\nand a war with Carthage that lasted without a break for twenty-three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt would be waste of space in this little book to go into the details of\r\nthis long and wearisome war, which can be read in any history of Rome.\r\nIt was, of course, in the main a naval war, and the Romans had as yet no\r\nfleet to speak of. But now was seen the advantage of a united Italy. The\r\ndifficulty was overcome by enlisting the services of Greek and Etruscan\r\nsailors and ship-builders; a Carthaginian war-vessel, wrecked on the\r\nItalian coast, served as a model, and a large fleet was soon ready for\r\nsea, with which, strange to say, the Roman commanders succeeded in the\r\ncourse of a few years in clearing the Italian and Sicilian seas of the\r\nenemy, and even contrived to transport an army of invasion to\r\nCarthaginian territory. This astonishing feat was accomplished simply by\r\nthe invention of a device for grappling with the enemy’s ships, so that\r\nthey could be boarded by Roman soldiers acting as “marines.” And during\r\nthis first half of the war they also renewed their alliance with Hiero,\r\nand conquered the whole of Sicily, with the exception of the strong city\r\nof Lilybæum (now Marsala).\r\n\r\nBut all these good results were thrown away by the folly of the Roman\r\nSenate. Now that they had crossed the sea and entered on a new sphere of\r\naction, they seemed for the moment to have lost the prudence and wisdom\r\nthat had won them the headship of Italy. They had two consular armies in\r\nAfrica which seemed to have Carthage herself in their grip; but when she\r\nsued for peace they offered her impossible terms, and about the same\r\ntime actually recalled one of the two consuls with his army to Italy.\r\nThe old Phœnician spirit revived, and turned to desperate courage: an\r\nable Greek soldier of fortune, Xanthippus, took the Carthaginian army in\r\nhand, and before long, the remaining Roman army was utterly destroyed\r\nand its commander Regulus was a prisoner. This is the Regulus of one of\r\nthe most famous of Roman stories, and one of the most beautiful of\r\nHorace’s _Odes_. He is said to have gone to Rome on _parole_ with an\r\nembassy, and on its failure to have returned a captive to Carthage,\r\nwhere he was put to a cruel death. Many critics now reject this tale as\r\npure legend, without sufficient reason. It is probably true in outline,\r\nand it is certain that it took firm possession of the Roman mind. It\r\nthus bears witness to the strong Roman feeling of the binding power of\r\nan oath, even when given to an enemy; for Regulus had sworn to return if\r\nthe mission failed.\r\n\r\nIt took Rome many years and enormous efforts to recover from this\r\ndisaster, and from the destruction of her fleets by tempests which\r\nunluckily followed and gave Carthage once more the mastery of the sea.\r\nCarthage, too, had found a man of genius, Hamilcar Barca, whose intense\r\nhatred of Rome, ever growing as she gradually prevailed, inspired his\r\npeople to continue the struggle by sea, and his own forces to hold on\r\ngrimly to a mountain fortress in the north-west of Sicily, Mount Eryx,\r\nthe scene of the games in the fifth book of Virgil’s _Æneid_. Both sides\r\nwere exhausted and indeed permanently damaged; but the strength of Rome\r\nwas more enduring, and in 241 B.C. Hamilcar consented himself to\r\nnegotiate a peace, by which Sicily and the adjacent smaller islands\r\npassed into the hands of Rome for ever. Soon afterwards, taking\r\nadvantage of a deadly war which Carthage had to wage with her own\r\nmercenaries, Rome contrived, in that spirit of “slimness” already\r\nnoticed, to get possession of both Sardinia and Corsica. This shows that\r\nthe Senate understood the importance of these islands for a power in\r\ncommand of the western seas; but unjust dealing brought its own reward.\r\nIt is possible that the great Hamilcar might have forgiven Rome her\r\ninjuries to his country but for this. As it was, his hatred of her sunk\r\ninto his soul more deeply than ever, and that hatred, springing up\r\nafresh in the breast of his son Hannibal, all but destroyed his enemy\r\noff the face of the earth. He retired to Spain, to organise a\r\nCarthaginian dominion there, of which he was himself practically king,\r\nand which he destined as a base of operations against Rome in another\r\nwar; and before he started, as Hannibal himself told the story long\r\nafterwards, the father made his boy of nine years old take a solemn oath\r\nto cherish an eternal hatred of the enemies of his country.\r\n\r\nThe plan of invading Italy from Spain was forced upon Hamilcar by the\r\nfact that Rome was in command of the sea; it was no longer possible for\r\nCarthage to strike at her from Africa without a greater effort to\r\nrecover that command than her government of merchant princes was now\r\ndisposed to make. And the fact that Hannibal was actually able to carry\r\nout the invasion by land was due to the genius and personal influence of\r\nhis father in building up a solid dominion in southern Spain with New\r\nCarthage (now Cartagena) as its capital. Some historians have thought\r\nthat of these two extraordinary men the father was the greatest; and it\r\nis at least true that his was a noble work of construction, while his\r\nson’s brilliant gifts were wasted in the attempt to destroy the great\r\nfabric which Rome had reared in Italy. The attempt was unavailing; the\r\nsolid Roman structure survived all the assaults of the greatest captain\r\nof the ancient world. The glamour of Hannibal’s splendid victories must\r\nnot blind us to the fact that he made two serious miscalculations: he\r\nbelieved that the Italians hated Rome as he did himself, and would join\r\nhim to crush her; and he hoped, if he did not believe, that Carthage\r\nwould give him substantial help. Had he judged rightly on the former\r\npoint, Rome’s fate was sealed. But the Italian kinsmen of Rome, who had\r\ncome to recognise in her their natural leader, never even faltered in\r\ntheir loyalty,[5] and Carthage did but little to help him till it was\r\ntoo late. Thus we have in this terrible war the strange spectacle of a\r\nsingle man of marvellous genius pitting himself against the whole\r\nstrength of a united Italy with military resources, as we know from the\r\naccurate Greek historian, Polybius, amounting to some 770,000 men\r\ncapable of bearing arms.\r\n\r\nFascinating as we may find Hannibal’s wonderful career, much as we may\r\nadmire his nobility of character, a sober judgment must lead to the\r\nconclusion that no great man ever did less for the good of his\r\nfellow-creatures. During the fifteen years of his stay in Italy he did\r\nirreparable damage to the fair peninsula, and he hardened the hearts of\r\nthe Romans for all their future dealings with their foes. When at last\r\nhe left it he was unable to save his own country, and spent his last\r\nyears in exile, ever plotting against the enemy that had escaped him. A\r\nman who is actuated all his life through by a single motive of hatred\r\nand revenge, can never be reckoned among those who have done something\r\nfor the benefit of humanity.\r\n\r\nWhile Hannibal was gaining the loyalty of the southern Spaniards, and\r\norganising their resources, Rome was occupied in trying to extend her\r\npower over the Gauls settled in the plain of the Po, and so to make sure\r\nof her northern flank, as she had already secured Sicily in the south.\r\nThe Senate knew something of Hannibal’s design, and hoped to anticipate\r\nhim in getting a hold on that valuable region, the strategical key to\r\nItaly. But here there was no question of gaining the loyalty of the\r\ntribes; the Gauls were restless and hostile, and had quite lately made\r\nanother determined attempt to reach Rome; they actually came within\r\nthree days’ march of the city before they were defeated in a great\r\nbattle. In 219-218 B.C. Roman armies were still busy in driving roads\r\nnorthward, and planting two colonies, Placentia and Cremona, on Gallic\r\nsoil and on the Po, when Hannibal descended on them from the Alps. He\r\nhad found a pretext for war, gathered a force of 100,000 men, passed the\r\nPyrenees and reached the Rhone before the Senate knew what he was about,\r\nand eluded a consular army dispatched to stop him. Scipio, its\r\ncommander, with true military instinct, sent his army on to Spain, to\r\ncut his communications with the base he had been preparing so long. This\r\nline of communication Hannibal never recovered for ten years, and was\r\nforced to maintain and recruit his army on Italian soil.\r\n\r\nThat army, from a purely military point of view, was without doubt one\r\nof the best known to history. It consisted chiefly of thoroughly trained\r\nSpanish infantry, officered by Carthaginians, and of the best cavalry in\r\nthe world, recruited from the Numidians of the western region of North\r\nAfrica. It was one of those armies that can go anywhere and do anything\r\nat the bidding of its general, because entire trust in him was the one\r\nmotive actuating it. It was a professional army, a perfect instrument of\r\nwar, a weapon admirably fitted to destroy, but without constructive\r\nvalue—with no sap of civilisation giving it permanent vital energy.\r\nLuckily for Rome, this army had shrunk to very moderate dimensions when\r\nit reached Italy; the length of the march, the necessity of leaving some\r\ntroops in Spain, and the terrible trials of the crossing of the Alps,\r\nwhere the native tribes combined with rock, snow and ice to wear it out,\r\nhad reduced it to less than 30,000 men.\r\n\r\nYet after a few days’ rest Hannibal went straight for the nearest Roman\r\nforce. This force was now on the north bank of the Po under Scipio, who\r\nhad returned from the Rhone to Italy. Pushing it back to the new colony\r\nof Placentia, where it was joined by that of the other consul\r\nSempronius, Hannibal utterly defeated the combined Roman armies on the\r\nlittle river Trebbia which runs down to that city (now Piacenza) from\r\nthe Apennines. The Roman power in the plain of the Po was instantly\r\nparalysed by this defeat, and the victor at once set himself to organise\r\nalliances with the Gallic tribes while he rested and recruited his weary\r\ntroops. But from the Gauls he got no substantial help; that fickle\r\npeople had no great reason to welcome an invader when once he was in\r\ntheir territory. And perhaps this was fortunate for him; for if he had\r\nmarched into central Italy as leader of a Gallic army he would have\r\nstrengthened, not weakened, the resistance of the whole Italian\r\nfederation that Rome had so solidly organised. His knowledge of the\r\nmotives which held this federation together must surely have been\r\nseriously imperfect.\r\n\r\nBut in the spring he crossed the Apennines, and made his way through the\r\nmarshy and malarious district around the lower Arno, where it is said he\r\nlost an eye from ophthalmia, to meet the consul Flaminius, who had been\r\nsent to cover the approach to Rome with a large army. Slipping past\r\nFlaminius, Hannibal concealed his army among the hills and woods on the\r\neastern shore of the lake of Trasimene, along the western bank of which\r\nthe railway now runs on its way from Florence to Rome; and here he lay\r\nin wait for his prey. Flaminius walked into the trap laid for him; his\r\narmy was totally destroyed, and he himself was killed. There was now\r\nnothing to stop the conqueror if he chose to march straight on Rome.\r\n\r\nBut Hannibal’s plans did not include a siege of Rome; he had brought no\r\nsiege apparatus, and at no time during the war did he succeed in getting\r\nany from Carthage, or in making it in Italy. His real object was to\r\nbring the Italians over to his side, to isolate Rome, and to put a free\r\nItaly (so he is said to have phrased it) in place of a Roman dominion.\r\nSo he turned his back on Rome, and made his way at leisure down the\r\neastern coast of central Italy to the corn-lands of Apulia, which were\r\nhenceforward to serve as his chief base of operations. Hence he might\r\neasily reach the great sea-ports of Tarentum and Croton, and so get into\r\ntouch once more with Carthage, and perhaps, too, with another power from\r\nwhom he was already looking for help, Philip, king of Macedon. But\r\nduring this southward march he learnt, apparently for the first time,\r\nthat Italy was studded with Roman and Latin colonies, each a fortress,\r\neach provisioned and ready to resist him: each, too, a miniature Rome,\r\ndisseminating among the Italians the honour and pride of Roman\r\ncitizenship, and the animating spirit of Italian unity under Roman\r\nleadership. One or two of these fortresses he vainly tried to take, and\r\nhe must at this time have begun at last to realise that the mortal\r\nhatred of an individual is no match in the long run for the organised\r\nvitality of a practical people.\r\n\r\nHis one chance was to win another great battle, and so to overawe south\r\nItaly, to make his base absolutely secure, and to force gradually\r\nnorthward the leaven of anti-Roman feeling on which he calculated. For\r\nthe rest of that year, 217 B.C., he could not get this chance; the\r\nSenate, still cool-headed, had appointed a cool-headed dictator,[6] who\r\nknew that his slow and steady citizen soldiers were no good match for a\r\nmobile professional army skilfully handled, and steadily refused to\r\naccept battle. Not even when Hannibal forced his way northward to the\r\nrich plain of Campania, and tried to gain over the wealthy city of\r\nCapua, would Fabius be tempted to fight; he dogged the enemy’s\r\nfootsteps, and once tried to catch him in a snare, from which Hannibal\r\nescaped by a clever ruse. But next year the Senate dispatched the two\r\nnew consuls, with an army not far short of 100,000 men, to deal with the\r\nenemy in southern Italy; and here, reluctant though one at least of them\r\nwas, Hannibal enticed them into a battle by seizing a valuable dépôt of\r\nstores at a town called Cannæ, near the sea, in the plain of Apulia.\r\nThough far inferior in numbers, he contrived by consummate tactics to\r\ndraw the solid Roman legions into a net, and then used his mobile\r\nNumidian cavalry to prevent their escape to the rear. The fight became a\r\nbutchery, in which 80,000 Romans are said to have fallen. The largest\r\narmy ever yet sent out from Rome was totally destroyed, and it would\r\nseem as if she could no longer escape from her deadly foe.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the high-water mark of Hannibal’s successes, we may pause\r\nto see how the Senate met the news of this most terrible disaster. At no\r\nmoment in Roman history is the sterling quality of the Roman character\r\nand spirit so conspicuously shown. The Senate had to meet not only the\r\nimmediate military crisis in Italy, but the problems of military and\r\nnaval policy in Spain, in Sicily, and in the plain of the Po. At home,\r\ntoo, they had to deal with what we may call a religious panic; the\r\npeople, and especially the women, were beginning to lose nerve, and to\r\nfancy that their gods had forsaken them. We can believe the Roman\r\nhistorian when he says that any other people would have been crushed by\r\na catastrophe like this. But the wise men of the Senate simply sat down\r\nto repair it, never dreaming of giving in. The city was made safe, fresh\r\nlegions were enrolled, and thanks were voted to the surviving consul\r\n“for not despairing of the republic.” They would not ransom the\r\nprisoners in Hannibal’s hands, nor receive the officer whom he sent for\r\nthis purpose. They were not moved even by the news that southern Italy,\r\nthe Bruttians, Lucanians, Apulians, and most of the Samnites, had joined\r\nthe enemy, and that isolated towns farther north had deserted them.\r\nCapua, the second city of Italy, was betrayed to Hannibal, and he was\r\nthus enabled to advance his base from Apulia into the plain of Campania,\r\nwithout leaving an enemy in his rear: but the Senate did not despair. In\r\ndue time the ranks of this Senate, sadly thinned since the war began,\r\nwere filled up by a dictator with the best and most experienced citizens\r\navailable. All possible means were adopted of keeping up the idea of\r\n“the peace of the gods”; an embassy was even sent to Delphi; the\r\nreligious panic speedily quieted down. At the beginning of the next year\r\nprovision was made as usual for the military commands in Sicily,\r\nSardinia, and Spain, and also for a fleet which was being got together\r\nat Ostia, the port at the mouth of the Tiber. Within a few months after\r\nthe battle all was going on in Rome as usual.\r\n\r\nSo the overwhelming defeat of Cannæ did but lead the Romans to\r\nvictory—to a victory of all the nobler elements in their character over\r\nmomentary doubt and despair. A people that could recover from that\r\ndisaster, and go quietly about the work of repairing it, was not likely\r\nto be crushed out of existence even by a Hannibal; and though he was to\r\nremain as a standing menace for many years on Italian soil, it may\r\nfairly be said that henceforward he had no real chance of ultimate\r\nsuccess. Two moments of grave anxiety were still to come, but Rome\r\nsurvived them both. One of these came three years later, when a\r\ndesperate effort was being made to snatch Capua out of Hannibal’s grasp.\r\nTo induce the Roman government to raise the siege, he made a sudden\r\nmarch on Rome, knowing that no covering army was between him and the\r\ncapital. He encamped on the Anio, three miles above the city, and rode\r\nwith an escort of cavalry right up to the gates. But it was all in vain;\r\nthe Senate had gathered levies amply sufficient to hold the walls, and\r\nafter plundering the Roman lands Hannibal fell away again, like a\r\nsea-wave spent and broken on a rocky shore.\r\n\r\nThe last moment of extreme peril came five years later, in 207 B.C. The\r\nwise foresight of the Senate at the outset of the war had so far secured\r\nthe Roman hold on Spain, and no reinforcements had reached Hannibal from\r\nthat source. At last his loyal and able brother Hasdrubal eluded the\r\nRoman army there, and by taking a new route—that of Wellington in the\r\nPeninsular War—avoided all opposition from the Romans in northern Spain.\r\nCommunications with Italy were now at last open, though not by sea, as\r\nthey should have been had the government at Carthage thrown its whole\r\nstrength into the work of building up its naval power afresh. Hasdrubal\r\nwas forced to cross the Alps, and this he did with better knowledge and\r\nwith less loss than his brother. He made his way through the Gallic\r\nterritory and reached Ariminum (Rimini). Hannibal was in Apulia, where\r\none consul was holding him in check and dealing with disaffected\r\nItalians; the other was waiting for the invader on the great coast road\r\nsouth of Ariminum. Hasdrubal sent dispatches to his brother informing\r\nhim of his arrival and suggesting plans of co-operation; but there were\r\nRoman troops everywhere, and the messengers fell into the hands of the\r\nenemy. The consul in the south, Claudius Nero, discovering thus the\r\ndanger, took a step, without orders from the Senate, which has made his\r\nname for ever famous. He left sufficient force to hold Hannibal, and\r\nslipped away with 7000 picked men, without being discovered even by the\r\nmost wily of commanders. He marched into the camp of Livius, the other\r\nconsul, by night, after a march of some 200 miles, all the loyal people\r\nof central Italy feeding and blessing his army as he went. Two days\r\nlater the most decisive battle of the war was fought on the banks of the\r\nlittle river Metaurus, which runs into the sea from the Apennines a few\r\nmiles south of Ariminum. The Romans were this time completely\r\nvictorious; the invading army was utterly destroyed, and Hasdrubal was\r\nkilled fighting hard to the last. Nero went swiftly southwards to his\r\noriginal station, and flung the head of Hasdrubal—so it was said—into\r\nhis brother’s camp. For the first time during the long weary years of\r\nthe war Rome was mad with joy; and almost for the first time in her\r\nhistory we note a genuine outburst of gratitude to the gods for this\r\ntheir inestimable blessing. Gratitude, whether to god or man, was not a\r\nconspicuous trait in the Roman character; but now, in a moment of real\r\nreligious emotion, the first thought is one of thankfulness that “the\r\npeace of the gods” is fully restored. It was not only that the Senate\r\nordered a public thanksgiving of three days, but that men and women\r\nalike took advantage of it to press in crowds to the temples, the\r\nmothers, in their finest robes, bringing their children with them.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the war-story is soon told. The man who had let Hasdrubal\r\nescape him in Spain was a young Scipio, son of a Scipio who had done\r\ngood work and lost his life there earlier in the war. He himself was a\r\nyoung man of real ability, whose character has always been to some\r\nextent a mystery. He was a new type of Roman, one not wholly without\r\nimagination, and the long years that he spent in Spain without rivals to\r\ncheck him had perhaps made him cherish and develop his own individuality\r\nmore than was possible for the staid Roman noble of the old type at\r\nhome. He believed profoundly in himself, and had the gift of making\r\nothers believe in him. Returning home the year after the Metaurus\r\nbattle, he was elected consul, though not yet of the legal age, and had\r\nSicily given him as his province, where after many vicissitudes the\r\nRomans were now supreme. He at once proposed to invade Africa, and so to\r\nforce Hannibal to leave Italy; and the Senate, though they could not or\r\nwould not risk a large force, gave him leave to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nScipio crossed to Africa in 204 B.C., and ere long the Carthaginian\r\ngovernment recalled Hannibal. The great general obeyed, sadly and\r\nunwillingly, and in 202 met Scipio in battle at Zama and was beaten; the\r\nundisciplined levies given him by the government were no match for Roman\r\nveterans. He himself now advised his people to make peace, and conducted\r\nthe negotiations, thus doing what he could to make up for the\r\nirreparable damage done her in the war by his own implacable hatred of\r\nher rival. Carthage was no longer to be a naval power—that was\r\ndefinitely secured by the terms accorded her. She surrendered Spain to\r\nthe victors, and agreed to pay a large war indemnity by instalments\r\nduring fifty successive years. Her foreign policy was to be guided by\r\nRome: she could no longer be called an independent State.\r\n\r\nSo ended this great trial of Roman endurance. No people has ever gone\r\nthrough a harder test and survived. The sense of duty and discipline\r\nnever once failed them; Romans and Italians alike were ready to face\r\ndeath at any moment in defence of their country. But war, always\r\nmischievous, when prolonged can sow the seeds of much evil in the\r\nfuture; and we must confess with regret that we are to see but little\r\nmore of the heroic qualities that had carried Rome through this great\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                        DOMINION AND DEGENERACY\r\n\r\n\r\n“It was not merely that the disasters of the war had opened the eyes of\r\npublic men to abuses which had grown up among them; it was not that they\r\nhastened to take measures by which such disasters might be prevented\r\nfrom occurring again. Not so much foresight as this was required. The\r\nquestion was at once simpler and more urgently pressing: it was how to\r\nprevent the cultivation of the country from falling into a condition of\r\npermanent decay.... Not only did it become necessary to inquire of\r\npolitical economy what means there were of increasing the wealth of a\r\nwhole nation at once, but other reforms, less obviously adapted to the\r\nimmediate need, were now eagerly carried into effect.”[7]\r\n\r\nThis passage does not refer to Italy and the Roman government after the\r\ngreat war, but to Prussia after she had succumbed to Napoleon and was\r\nforced to rest from sheer exhaustion. This rest, skilfully used by\r\nstatesmen of genius, meant for Prussia recovery, and the opening of a\r\ngreat era of prosperity. If Rome in like manner could have given rest to\r\na weary Italy, and brought all her practical skill to bear on the work\r\nof healing and mending, the next two centuries might have been far\r\nhappier ones for her and for the world. But it is hard for young\r\nnations, as for young men, to realise the need of rest, and all the\r\nharder in ancient Italy, where fighting had hardly ceased to be looked\r\non as “the natural industry of a vigorous State.” The Roman Senate was\r\nnot ripe enough in knowledge of human nature to understand the mischief,\r\nmoral as well as material, that a long war can cause, especially if the\r\nenemy has been in your country harrying and devouring, no one knowing\r\nwhen his turn will come to be ruined. And, indeed, we may doubt whether\r\neven if Rome’s leading men had been able to understand the nature of the\r\nmischief, they would have had the skill to discover and apply the\r\nnecessary remedies.\r\n\r\nThis mischief and its results must be the subject of this chapter, for\r\nwithout getting some idea of it we cannot understand the perils to which\r\ncivilisation was exposed in the next two hundred years by Roman\r\ndegeneracy, or the way in which they were eventually overcome. But I\r\nmust just glance, to start with, at the policy actually pursued by the\r\nSenate in the period following the war, which placed Rome in the\r\nposition of arbiter of the whole Mediterranean world, and mistress of a\r\nterritory many times as large as Italy.\r\n\r\nThe two recent invasions of Italy by formidable enemies must have taught\r\nthe Senate the necessity of making it impossible that there should be\r\nanother. But another might yet be looked for—so at least they\r\nbelieved—not from Spain or Africa, but from the great military power of\r\nMacedon. Philip of Macedon had been among Rome’s enemies since Cannæ;\r\nbut not even Hannibal could persuade him to attack her with vigour, and\r\nhe missed his chance. Roman diplomacy had stirred up the Greeks against\r\nhim, and he had plenty to do at home. But no sooner was Carthage crushed\r\nthan the Senate coaxed the tired and unwilling people into declaring war\r\nagainst him, and this led in the course of the next half-century to the\r\noverthrow of the Macedonian kingdom, and finally to its absorption into\r\nwhat we must now begin to call the Roman Empire. At the same time, Rome\r\nacquired a protectorate over the whole of Greece, at first honestly\r\nmeant to defend her against Macedon, but destined to pass rapidly into\r\ndominion. The Greeks in their leagues and cities were never again really\r\nfree. If they could have kept from quarrelling among themselves, they\r\nmight have endured this protectorate with profit; but ere Rome had done\r\nwith them they were to feel her heavy hand.\r\n\r\nThus the “peasants of the Tiber” became masters of the Balkan peninsula\r\nas well as of that of Italy. In the same period they completed the\r\nconquest of Italy up to the Alps, not without difficulties and defeats,\r\nand went on driving their roads and planting colonies in all parts. In\r\nthe Spanish peninsula, from which the Carthaginians had been finally\r\ndriven, they now established two permanent commands (_provinciæ_), one\r\nin the basin of the Ebro in the north-east, and the other in the fertile\r\nvalleys of the Guadiana and Guadalquivir, as the two great rivers of\r\nsouthern Spain are now called. From these they slowly but persistently,\r\nafter their manner, and in spite of many defeats and even disgraces,\r\npushed up into the high tablelands of central Spain, until they had\r\nbrought the greater part of the peninsula under their sway. Here they\r\nhad to deal with a people very different from the weary and exhausted\r\nGreeks and Macedonians; a people only half civilised, but lively,\r\nintelligent and capable of making excellent soldiers, as Hannibal had\r\nfound. It is to the credit of the Romans that, in spite of much cruelty\r\nand misgovernment, they gave this peninsula a real civilisation, of\r\nwhich the traces are still abundant especially in the south, and a\r\nbeautiful language, which descends directly from their own.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain their communications with Spain by land as well as\r\nby sea, they also had to look to the coast between the western Alps and\r\nthe Pyrenees. Here they made a lasting alliance with the ancient and\r\nflourishing Greek colony, Massilia (Marseille); and in defending\r\nMassilia from the attacks of mountain tribes they were gradually drawn\r\ninto the acquisition of a permanent hold on the lower valley of the\r\nRhone. This, again, in due time very naturally became the starting-point\r\nfor fresh advance into the heart of modern France. No one who has seen\r\nthe Rhone from Lyons to Marseilles can resist the conclusion that a\r\npower in possession of its lower reaches must inevitably advance along\r\nit northward.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a fourth peninsula in this land-locked sea, known for want\r\nof a better name as Asia Minor, which juts out from the Asiatic\r\ncontinent, and forms a meeting-place for Eastern and Western\r\ncivilisations. This was in the last three centuries B.C. the\r\nfighting-ground of the successors of Alexander the Great, kings of\r\nMacedon, Pergamum, Syria and Egypt, who wasted the vigour of humanity in\r\nwars that to us seem needless. The Romans were soon drawn into a war\r\nwith the king of Syria, an ally of Philip of Macedon, and won a great\r\nvictory in this peninsula in the year 190 B.C. But they annexed no\r\nterritory here until the last king of Pergamum left his kingdom to Rome\r\nby will some sixty years later. The Senate preferred to act as\r\narbitrator, to make alliances, to reward friendly states, to use\r\ndiplomacy rather than force; and on the whole they succeeded. Their\r\npolicy was often tortuous, sometimes even mean, but in the long run it\r\ndid more good than harm to humanity that a young and virile people\r\nshould interfere among these monarchies.\r\n\r\nThus, whether we look west or east in the Mediterranean, we find the\r\nRoman power predominant everywhere within eighty years from the end of\r\nthe war with Hannibal. It is not easy to explain in a few words what\r\ndrove this power onwards. It was not simply the commercial motive, as\r\nwith Carthage. It was not simply the desire to conquer and annex, for\r\nthe Senate was slow to undertake new duties of government abroad if\r\ntheir object could be attained in some other way. But what was that\r\nobject? Undoubtedly it was self-defence to begin with; but self-defence,\r\nonce successful, only too easily slips into self-assertion. This\r\nself-assertion, as we see it in Roman policy, may perhaps be compared\r\nwith that which governs German foreign policy now—the determination to\r\nhave a voice in all matters within her “sphere of interest.” No Roman\r\nsenator had a doubt that his people were the strongest and most\r\ncompetent to control the world, which is exactly what the patriotic\r\nGerman believes now. And the constant assertion of this proud conviction\r\nbrought many suitors and suppliants to Rome, whose presence flattered\r\nRoman pride, and whose diplomacy sometimes involved the government in\r\nnew wars, giving ambitious consuls their opportunity of increasing the\r\nfame and the wealth of themselves and their families. So in due time\r\nthere arose a dominion of the following military commands or provinces:\r\none in Sicily, one in Sardinia, two in Spain, one in southern Gaul, one\r\nin Macedonia with Greece attached to it, one in Asia Minor, and one in\r\nAfrica, after the destruction of Carthage by her old enemy in 146 B.C.\r\nOf the method of governing these provinces I will say something in\r\nanother chapter. Now let us try to estimate some of the results of these\r\ncontinuous wars in distant parts, taken together with the long struggle\r\nwith Carthage. We shall find a change in every department of the\r\npeople’s life, and in almost all a change for the worse.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us look at that family life which formed the essential fibre\r\nof the old body politic, and provided the most powerful factor in the\r\nRoman character. We have but to think of the immense numbers of citizens\r\nkilled or captured in war, or carried off by the pestilences that always\r\nfollow war, to see what paralysis of family life there must have been.\r\nFathers and grown-up sons innumerable never came home at all; and long\r\nservice far from home would, in any case, deprive the family of the\r\nnatural influence and authority of its head. Mothers might do much to\r\nfill up the gap, and the tradition of the dignified and righteous Roman\r\nlady was not as yet wholly weakened; but there are signs that the women\r\nin this period were getting steadily more excitable, more\r\nself-asserting, more luxurious. It is in this age that divorce begins to\r\nmake its appearance, a sure sign of the decay of the old family life.\r\nThere were rumours, too, of the poisoning of husbands by their wives,\r\nand on one occasion two noble ladies were put to death for this crime by\r\nthe verdict of a council of relations. In an extraordinary attempt to\r\nintroduce into Italy the exciting orgies of the Greek religion of\r\nDionysus, women were among the most prominent offenders. The changing\r\nposition of women at this time is illustrated by a famous saying of\r\nCato, that “all men rule over women, we Romans rule over all men, and\r\nour wives rule over us.”\r\n\r\nWith the decay of the old family life, the wholesome training of the\r\nchildren in manly conduct (_virtus_) and sense of duty (_pietas_) could\r\nnot but suffer, too. Old-fashioned families would keep it up, but among\r\nthe lower classes it was hard to do so owing to bad housing and crowding\r\nin the city; and in the noble families there was undoubtedly a change\r\nfor the worse, though we know of one or two great men of this age who\r\ntook pains with the moral as well as the intellectual training of their\r\nboys.[8] For a people controlling the Mediterranean world it was\r\nnecessary to educate the mental faculties, and more especially to teach\r\na boy to speak and read Greek, which was the language of half the\r\ncivilised world, and the language of commerce everywhere. Now Rome could\r\nnot supply teachers for this kind of education; Romans were not\r\ncompetent, nor would they have condescended to such work. The Greeks\r\nwere the one people who could undertake what we call the higher\r\neducation, and they were now beginning to swarm in Rome. Some Greek\r\nteachers were free men, but the greater number were slaves captured in\r\nthe wars; and thus the first requisite in a school-master, that he\r\nshould be looked up to and willingly obeyed, was too often absent in\r\nthis new education. It is men, not methods, that really tell in\r\neducation. In his heart, as we know from many striking passages in Roman\r\nliterature, the grown-up Roman despised the Greek, and we may be sure\r\nthat the Roman boy did too. Greek literature and rhetoric, now fast\r\nbecoming the staple of the higher education, could never make up for the\r\nlack of moral discipline. If we find a spirit of lawlessness in the\r\ncoming age, and a want of self-restraint in dealing with enemies or\r\nopponents, we shall not be far wrong in ascribing it in great part to\r\nthe loss of the wholesome home influence, and to the introduction of an\r\neducation outside the home, which entirely failed to make up for the\r\ndecay of the simple old training in duty and discipline.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Romans were now coming under the influence of a new\r\nidea of life, in which the individual played a more important part than\r\never before at Rome. The Roman of the past had grown up modelled on a\r\ntype and fixed in a group, so that the individual had little chance of\r\nasserting himself; but now we find him asserting himself in every\r\ndirection, and in every class of society. To think for oneself, even in\r\nmatters of religion; to speak from personal motives in the senate or\r\nlaw-courts; to aim at one’s own advancement in position or wealth—all\r\nthis seemed natural and inevitable to the men of that day. And so by\r\ndegrees the individual became the mainspring of action instead of the\r\nState. There were some noble exceptions, but most of the leading men\r\nplayed their own game, and often won it at the expense of the State.\r\nMany a general hurried on operations towards the close of his command so\r\nas not to be superseded before he could earn a triumph, and pass in\r\nsplendid procession up to the temple on the Capitol, with chained\r\ncaptives following his chariot. And the small men became more and more\r\nunwilling to serve as soldiers in distant lands, and more and more\r\nrebellious against discipline. In little more than half-a-century after\r\nHannibal had left Italy the Roman armies were beginning to be incapable\r\nof their work.\r\n\r\nAlong with this too rapid growth of the individual, we have to take\r\naccount of the sudden incoming of wealth and growth of capital. The old\r\nRoman family group had no capital except its land and stock. But now, as\r\nthe result of plunder and extortion in the provinces, most men of the\r\nupper classes had some capital in money, and this was almost always\r\ninvested in public works and State undertakings of all kinds, _e.g._ the\r\nraising of taxes and the fitting out of fleets and armies. These things\r\nwere all done by contract, and the contracts were taken by companies, in\r\nwhich every man was a shareholder who had anything to invest. Thus the\r\ninflow of wealth brought with it the desire of making money, and the\r\nforum of Rome became a kind of stock-exchange in which the buying and\r\nselling of shares was always going on, and where every man was trying to\r\noutwit his neighbour. Of a really productive use of capital in industry\r\nor commerce we hear very little; and it would seem that the Roman of\r\nthat day had no idea of using his means or opportunities in ways likely\r\nto produce well-being in the world.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to rural Italy, the prospect is hardly less dreary.\r\nIncalculable damage had been done to agriculture in the great war, and\r\nagriculture, in the broad sense of the word, was almost the only Italian\r\nindustry. Corn, wine, oil, wool and leather had formerly been produced\r\nin sufficient quantities to keep the inhabitants in food and clothing,\r\neach community growing what it needed, as in mediæval England. But this\r\nsimple form of agricultural economy must have suffered a severe shock,\r\nnot only from the ravages of armies, but from the decrease of the\r\nworking population owing to war and pestilence.\r\n\r\nIn order to restore a decaying industry you must have the men to work\r\nit. Depopulation as the result mainly of war was a disease epidemic in\r\nthe Mediterranean in this age; and in Italy we know for certain how rife\r\nit was, for we have the records of the census of the body of Roman\r\ncitizens, which show a steady falling-off in this period, and we must\r\nsuppose that the same causes were at work among the non-Roman population\r\nof the peninsula. There was, indeed, a remedy, but it was almost worse\r\nthan the disease—I mean the vast numbers of slaves now available for\r\nlabour. The unskilled slaves, captured or kidnapped in Spain, Gaul,\r\nEpirus, Thrace or Asia Minor, were cheap in the Roman market, and would\r\ndo well enough to run a farm with, especially if that farm were chiefly\r\na pastoral one, with flocks and herds needing no great experience or\r\nskill to look after. This cheapness, and the physical conditions of\r\nrural life in a mountainous country, made cattle-running and\r\nsheep-tending a profitable industry. Large districts of Italy,\r\nespecially in the centre and south, became covered in this period with\r\nhuge estates owned by capitalists, and worked by rough and often savage\r\nslaves, who were locked up at night in underground prisons and treated\r\nsimply as “living tools.” No ray of hope ever broke in on these\r\nmiserable beings; no free citizen gave a thought either to their\r\ncondition or the economic danger of the system; philanthropy and\r\npolitical economy were unknown in the Roman world, for imagination and\r\nreflection were alike foreign to the Roman mental habit\r\n\r\nEven on the estates of moderate size which were not entirely pastoral,\r\nslave-labour was the rule. We know something of such a farm from the\r\ntreatise on agriculture written by Cato at this time, which has come\r\ndown to us entire; and it is plain from what he says that though free\r\nlabour might be employed at certain seasons, _e.g._ at harvest, the\r\neconomic basis of the business was slave-labour. There is no doubt that\r\nall over Italy the small farm and the free cultivator were fast\r\ndisappearing, with the rapid growth of capital and the cheapness of\r\nslaves. In the city of Rome, now beginning to harbour a vast population\r\nof many races, the number of domestic slaves tended constantly to\r\nincrease; they were employed in every capacity by men of wealth and\r\nbusiness. Many of them were cultivated men, Greeks for example, who\r\ncould act as clerks, secretaries or teachers, and these had a fair\r\nchance of earning their freedom in time; but great numbers were low and\r\nvicious beings, who had no moral standard but that of obedience to a\r\nmaster, no moral sanction except punishment.\r\n\r\nThus, though the shrinkage of the free population was evil enough, the\r\nremedy for it was even worse. The slave, plucked up by the roots from\r\nthe soil in which he had flourished in his native land, deprived of\r\nfamily, property, religion, must in the majority of cases become a\r\ndemoralised and hopeless being. In the plays of Plautus, which date from\r\nthis period, the slave is a liar and a thief, and apparently without a\r\nconscience. For the slave-owner, too, the moral results were bad enough,\r\nthough not so obvious at first sight. A man who is served by scores of\r\nfellow-creatures who are absolutely at his mercy is liable to have his\r\nsense of duty gradually paralysed. Towards them he has no obligations,\r\nonly rights; and thus his sense of duty towards his free fellow-citizens\r\nis apt to be paralysed too. A habit of mind acquired in dealing with one\r\nset of men naturally extends itself and affects all human relations. And\r\nso the Roman character, naturally hard enough, came in the later days of\r\nthe Republic to be harder than ever. In our next two chapters we shall\r\nmeet with unmistakable proofs of this. Incredible cruelty, recklessness\r\nof human life, callousness in dealing with the vanquished and the\r\nsubject peoples, meet us at every turn in that dark age of Mediterranean\r\nhistory. Under the baleful influence of slavery the hard Roman nature\r\nhad become brutalised; and we have to wait for the Christian era before\r\nwe find any sign of sympathy with that vast mass of suffering humanity\r\nwith which the Roman dominion was populated.\r\n\r\nWe must glance in the last place at the change brought about by the wars\r\nin another department of Roman life, viz. in the working of the\r\nconstitution. The reader will remember that in early Rome the salient\r\nfeature in that constitution was the _imperium_ of the magistrate, just\r\nas in private life the salient feature was the discipline of the family\r\nunder the rule of the head of the household. The man who held the\r\n_imperium_ was irresistible so long as he held it, though a wise custom\r\nmade it necessary for him to seek the advice of his council, the Senate,\r\nin all questions of grave importance. But now the long wars took the\r\nconsul and his _imperium_ away from the city for long periods, and as\r\nthe Empire began to grow up and include provinces beyond sea, those\r\nperiods became longer and longer. There were, indeed, always two\r\nmagistrates with _imperium_ in Rome, the prætors, who for long past had\r\nbeen elected yearly to help the consuls in judicial business; but the\r\nprestige of their _imperium_ never reached the level of that of the\r\nconsuls. And even when a consul returned home, though the majesty of the\r\n_imperium_ was present in his person as ever, it was not his hand that\r\nwas really on the helm. The decision of great questions did not lie with\r\nhim, but with his Council, whose knowledge of affairs and whose “courage\r\nnever to submit or yield,” had carried Rome safely through a long series\r\nof unexampled trials.\r\n\r\nIn the period after the war with Hannibal, the Senate, not the\r\n_imperium_, is clearly the paramount power in the working of the\r\nconstitutional machinery. To take a single instance: when the people\r\ndeclined to sanction the war with Philip of Macedon, the Senate directed\r\nthe consul to convince them that they were wrong, and both consul and\r\npeople bowed to its will. They had other agents in the tribunes of the\r\npeople, if the consuls failed them, and would now and then even coerce a\r\nconsul by means of the power of the tribune. But what chiefly gave the\r\nSenate its power was the fact that it was the only permanent part of the\r\ngovernment. A senator held office for life unless ejected by the Censor\r\nfor immorality, while all the magistrates were elected for a year only.\r\nIn the Senate there sat for life every man who had held high office and\r\ndone the State good service, and as there were some three hundred of\r\nthese, it was almost impossible for the yearly holders of _imperium_ to\r\nresist their deliberate judgments. And for those judgments the Senate\r\nwas responsible to no man.\r\n\r\nProbably no assembly has ever comprised so much practical wisdom and\r\nexperience as the Roman Senate of this period; but that wisdom and that\r\nexperience was limited to the working of the constitution, the control\r\nof foreign affairs, and the direction and supply of armies. As has\r\nalready been hinted, when it came to providing remedies for economic and\r\nmoral evils such as I have been sketching, the Senators were useless;\r\nthey had no training in the art of the State physician, and no desire to\r\nlearn how to diagnose disease. They were almost all men of the same\r\ntype, and with the same public and private interests. They belonged, in\r\nfact, to a few noble families, and new blood was seldom to be found in\r\ntheir ranks; for though they had all at one time or other been elected\r\nto office by the people, the choice of the people almost always fell\r\nupon members of the old tried families. The principle that the son of a\r\nfamily that has done good service to the State will be likely himself to\r\ndo such service, seems to have taken firm hold of the mind of the Roman\r\nvoter; and thus it came about that the Senate, in spite of its great\r\ncapacity for business, gradually became an _oligarchical_ body—the\r\nmouthpiece of one class of society. The principle is by no means a bad\r\none in some stages of social growth, but it is sure in the long run to\r\nproduce the vices as well as the virtues of oligarchy—the dislike of any\r\nkind of change, the narrow view of social life, the want of sympathy\r\nwith other classes and of the desire to understand their needs. We shall\r\nsee in the next two chapters how these oligarchical weaknesses brought\r\nthe Senatorial government to an ignominious end. It had saved the State\r\nfrom its deadliest enemy; it had laid the foundations of the Roman\r\nEmpire; but it failed utterly when called on to do the nobler work of\r\njustice and humanity.\r\n\r\nThis aptly brings us to our last point in this chapter. As the Roman\r\noligarchy stood to the people, so Rome herself stood as an oligarchy to\r\nthe populations of her Empire. The Roman citizen was the one most highly\r\nprivileged person in the civilised world of that day. The great prize of\r\nhis citizenship was not, as we might suppose it would be, the right to\r\nvote in the assemblies, to choose magistrates and pass or reject laws,\r\nnor the right to hold office if elected, for to that distinction very\r\nfew could aspire; it was really the legal protection of his person and\r\nhis property wherever he might be in the Empire. No one could maltreat\r\nhis person with impunity; a fact well illustrated in the life of St.\r\nPaul (Acts xxii. 25 foll.). He could do business everywhere with the\r\ncertainty that his sales, purchases, contracts, would be recognised and\r\ndefended by Roman law, while the non-citizen had no such guarantees for\r\nhis transactions. No other city in the Mediterranean had a citizenship\r\nto compare with this in practical value, for the Roman law was gradually\r\nbecoming the only system of law with a real force behind it. To live a\r\nlife of security and prosperity you must be a Roman citizen.\r\n\r\nWe, in these days of comparative enlightenment, might perhaps imagine\r\nthat with a gift like this citizenship in their hands the Romans would\r\nhave been quick to reward their faithful Italian allies, who had served\r\nin their armies all through these wars, by lifting them to their own\r\nlevel of social and political privilege. But if so, we should be\r\nascribing to the human nature of Roman times a degree of generosity and\r\nsympathy which was, in fact, almost unknown. We might fancy that they\r\nwould have grasped the fact that their old city-state had outgrown its\r\ncradle, that Italy and not the city of Rome now really supplied the\r\nforce with which the world was ruled, and that they would put the\r\nItalians on the same level of advantage as themselves, at least as\r\nregards the protection of person and property. But after the war with\r\nHannibal the tendency was rather in the other direction. All allied\r\nItalian cities continued to have to supply contingents to Roman armies\r\nand fleets; yet Rome offered them no privileges to make up for these\r\nburdens, and her magistrates got more and more into the habit of\r\ntreating them as inferiors. The Latins, too, that is the old cities of\r\nthe Latin league, and the colonies with Latin _right_, as it was now\r\ncalled, who already had some of the privileges of citizenship, were\r\ncarefully prevented from acquiring more, from becoming full citizens of\r\nRome. In this exclusive policy, which seems to us mean and ungrateful,\r\nthe Roman government undoubtedly lost a great chance, and had to pay\r\ndearly later on for her negligence.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that the imperial idea had taken hold of the governing\r\nRomans with a force to which that of our British “imperialism” cannot\r\ncompare for a moment. They were so busy governing, negotiating,\r\narbitrating and making money, that the condition and claims of their own\r\ncity and country failed to attract the attention of any but a very few\r\namong the educated aristocracy. Depopulation, decline of agriculture,\r\nslavery and its accompanying evils, injustice to the Italian allies and\r\nthe ever-growing discontent occasioned by it, misgovernment and plunder\r\nin the provinces, all these sources of mischief were now accumulating\r\nforce, and were before long to bring the whole Roman system to the brink\r\nof ruin. But Rome on the brink of ruin meant civilisation in imminent\r\ndanger; for no other power could any longer withstand the barbarians of\r\nnorthern Europe, who were even now beginning to press down into sunny\r\nsouthern lands. So it is that the story of the succeeding century, the\r\nlast before the Christian era, is one of the most thrilling interest.\r\nHow did Rome survive and overcome these dangers with renewed strength,\r\nand succeed in organising an Empire on the firm foundations of law and\r\njustice, destined to hold the barbarians at bay long enough to inspire\r\nthem with profound respect for the civilisation they were attacking?\r\nThis question we will try to answer in the remaining chapters of this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                         THE REVOLUTION: ACT I\r\n\r\n\r\nEnough was said in the last chapter to show that the age we are now\r\ncoming to, the last century before Christ, was one full of great\r\nissues—not only for Rome, but for all western civilisation. The perils\r\nthreatening, both internal and external, were so real as to call for\r\nstatesmen and soldiers of the highest quality; and as we shall see, this\r\ncall was answered. It was this century that produced most of the famous\r\nRomans whose names are familiar to us: the two Gracchi, Marius, Sulla,\r\nPompey, Cicero, Cæsar, and finally Augustus, all of whom helped in\r\nvarious ways to save Italy and the Empire from premature dissolution. It\r\nwas, in fact, an age of great personalities, and one, too, in which\r\npersonal character became as deeply interesting to the men of the time\r\nas it is even now to us. For as the disciplinary force of the State\r\nwaned, the individual was left freer to make his own force felt; and so\r\ngreat was that force at times, that we are tempted to fix our attention\r\non the man, and to forget the complicated motives and interests of the\r\nworld in which he was acting. Undoubtedly we should be wrong in doing\r\nso; for a very small acquaintance with the facts would show us these\r\ngreat men struggling incessantly with difficulties, and carried out of\r\ntheir own natural course by adverse currents. But none the less it is\r\ntrue that hardly any other period of history shows so much, for good and\r\nevil alike, depending on individual character. So as the last chapter\r\ndealt mainly with perils and problems, our next two will be occupied\r\nwith the efforts of these famous men to meet the perils and solve the\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\nDepopulation and the decline of agriculture were the first of the perils\r\nto be considered seriously. This was done in the year 133 B.C., not by\r\nthe Senate, whose business it really was, but by a young and\r\nenthusiastic noble, in some ways one of the finest characters in Roman\r\nhistory. Tiberius Gracchus had the right instinct of the old Roman for\r\nduty, and for a Roman he had an unusually tender and generous nature;\r\nbut he had not the experience and knowledge necessary for one who would\r\ntake this difficult problem in hand, which in our day would be prepared\r\nfor legislation by careful inquiry about facts, conducted by authorised\r\nexperts. His education had been mainly Greek, and a study of hard facts\r\ndid not form a part of it.\r\n\r\nStill, he was able to enlist the help of some capable men, and produced\r\nand finally carried a bill which may be called a Small Holdings Act. No\r\none was henceforward to hold more than 500 _jugera_ (about 300 acres) of\r\n_public land_, or if he had sons, 250 more for each of two. Public land\r\nwas land owned by the State, but occupied by private men who paid (or\r\nought to have paid) rent for it in some form. Land owned as well as\r\noccupied by private men could not be touched; but there was abundance of\r\nthe other, for the State had retained its hold on a large part of the\r\nland of Italy acquired by Rome. This land was now to be divided up in\r\nallotments, the State retaining its ownership and forbidding sale, a\r\nfutile attempt to keep the settlers on the land, even against their\r\nwill. This courageous plan for bringing the people back to the land was\r\nput in action at once, and we still have a few of the inscribed boundary\r\nstones set up by the commissioners chosen to carry it out. And there is\r\nreason to believe that it did some good in regard both to depopulation\r\nand agriculture. The Senate made no serious attempt to interfere with it\r\nwhen once it was passed, and it continued in force for many years.\r\n\r\nBut unluckily the Senate had done all it could to prevent the bill\r\npassing; they would have nothing to say to it, and they put up a tribune\r\nto veto it. The veto of the tribune of the plebs was an essential part\r\nof the constitution, and could not be disregarded; but Gracchus, also a\r\ntribune, had but one year of office, and if he could not get his bill\r\nthrough during that year, he must give up the attempt for a long while.\r\nEnthusiasm got the better of prudence; he deliberately broke with law\r\nand usage; he defied the Senate and its prerogative, and he carried a\r\nbill deposing the tribune who acted for the Senate. He also proposed to\r\noffer himself as a candidate for re-election, contrary to the custom if\r\nnot the law of the constitution. With the highest motives he thus laid\r\nhimself open to the charge of making himself master of the State, by\r\nviolating the custom of its forefathers (_mos majorum_). It had always\r\nbeen a maxim of Roman law that the man who aimed at tyranny might be\r\nslain by any one; and now that even the best aristocrats believed\r\nGracchus guilty, this was the fate that overtook him. He was killed on\r\nthe Capitol, and the cowardly rabble made no attempt to save him.\r\n\r\nThe story is perhaps the saddest in Roman history. A little more\r\npatience and practical wisdom, a little more of the spirit of compromise\r\non either side, might have saved the situation. The old Roman discipline\r\nhad avoided violence, and got over constitutional difficulties by\r\nconsent; now Gracchus laid a violent hand on the constitution, and was\r\nrepaid with violence by its unworthy defenders. Intending only reform,\r\nhe ended with starting revolution.\r\n\r\nThere was another enemy within the gates beside depopulation, one not\r\nless to be feared, but less easy to realise as an enemy; I mean\r\nslave-labour. Gracchus may be pardoned for making no direct attempt to\r\nattack it, though just before his tribunate there had been a rising of\r\nslaves in Sicily which showed the military as well as the economic\r\ndanger of the situation. It is said that 200,000 slaves were in\r\nrebellion there at one time, and the war was only ended after a long\r\nstruggle. These risings, more of which followed at intervals, and\r\nfinally a most formidable one in Italy sixty years later, were symptoms\r\nof a disease calling for a very skilful physician; but no physician was\r\nto be found until Cæsar tried to make a beginning. As yet the Romans had\r\nnot had time to realise this danger; living in an atmosphere of\r\nslave-labour, they believed that they throve on it. And as this was in\r\none sense true, owing to the decrease of the free labouring population,\r\nthe evil was too subtle for an uncritical people to discern. In spite of\r\nall these dangerous risings, there is no sign in the copious literature\r\nof this last century of the Republic of any consciousness of the poison\r\nat work.\r\n\r\nNine years after the murder of Tiberius Gracchus, his younger brother\r\nGaius, elected tribune, took up his work and went far beyond his\r\ndesigns. In this most interesting and able man we come at last upon a\r\nRoman statesman of the highest order; a practical man, no mere idealist\r\nof the new Greek school, and yet a man of genius and a born leader of\r\nmen. We possess a picture of him, evidently drawn from the life by one\r\nwho knew him, which shows these gifts at a glance.[9] When he was at the\r\nheight of his activity, busy with a multitude of details, he seems to\r\nhave given that eyewitness the impression that he was almost a monarch.\r\nBut a close study of all we are told about him seems to prove that he\r\nwas in reality one of those rare men, like Cæsar later on, who\r\nprofoundly believe that they can do the work needed by the State better\r\nthan any other man, and who are justified in that belief. He would see\r\nto the carrying out of his own measures with astonishing speed, sparing\r\nno pains, amazing even his enemies by the unflagging energy with which\r\nhe worked, and by the way he contrived to get work out of others.\r\nPerhaps the secret was that he was a gentleman in the best and noblest\r\nsense of that word; for Plutarch says that in his dealings with men he\r\nwas _always_ _dignified, yet always courteous_, invariably giving to\r\nevery man his due.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the personality of this man is the real explanation of his\r\nwork. If it had been possible for him to retain that personal influence\r\nwhich Plutarch emphasises, and to keep his legislative power even for a\r\nfew years, as a modern statesman may expect to keep it, it is quite\r\npossible that Rome might have escaped an era of danger and degeneracy.\r\nBut that could not be. A triple-headed Cerberus was guarding the path\r\nthat led to effectual reform: the forms of the old constitution, out of\r\ndate many of them, and unsuited to the needs of a great empire: the\r\nnarrow spirit of the oligarchical faction, opposed, for self-regarding\r\nreasons, to all change: and lastly, the mean and fickle temper of the\r\nmongrel city populace, whose power was sovereign in legislation and\r\nelections. In the effort to overcome this Cerberus Gracchus lost his\r\nprecious personal influence, and found his original designs warped from\r\ntheir true bearing. He survived through two tribunates, in the course of\r\nwhich he did much valuable work, but in the third year he was brutally\r\nand needlessly slain by his political enemies. Already Rome had put to\r\ndeath two of the most valuable men she ever produced, and in the coming\r\ncentury she was to put to death many more.\r\n\r\nHe had begun his work by a noble effort so to mend the constitution that\r\na reformer might be able to pass his laws without breaking it, as\r\nTiberius had been tempted to do. He tried to increase the numbers of the\r\nSenate, so as to leaven that great council, which he rightly looked on\r\nas the working centre of the constitution, with new ideas and wider\r\ninterests. And he sought, too, to solve the great problem of\r\ncitizenship, by giving the Italians some effectual share in it, and so\r\nat least the chance of making their voice heard in Roman politics. But\r\nfor such measures of real progress neither Senate nor people were ready:\r\nthe Senate was the stronghold of old prejudices, and the people were not\r\npleased to admit Italians to its privileges. Both these great projects,\r\nwhich show how far-reaching Gracchus’s views as a statesman were, proved\r\ncomplete failures.\r\n\r\nTo conciliate the Senate became more and more hopeless as Gracchus lost\r\nhis personal influence, and he gave up the attempt. Instead, he dealt\r\nthe senatorial oligarchy a heavy blow by depriving senators of the right\r\nto sit in judgment on ex-provincial governors accused of extortion (a\r\ncrime now becoming only too common), and giving it to the class below,\r\nthe Equites, or men of business. Thus he made a split between the two\r\nupper classes of society, which had very unfortunate results. Not less\r\nunhappy was another measure, meant to conciliate the hungry free\r\npopulation of the city, on which he must depend for the passing of his\r\nlaws. There had long been a difficulty in feeding this population: for\r\nits number had increased beyond all expectation, the corn-supply was not\r\nproperly organised, and the price of grain was constantly fluctuating.\r\nRecognising the fact that any legislator was in peril who could not make\r\nit impossible that the price should rise suddenly, he fixed a permanent\r\nprice, more than half below the normal, to be maintained at State cost,\r\nwhether or no the State were a loser. But here he went too far, and gave\r\nlater and less scrupulous demagogues the chance of making still more\r\nserious mischief. No doubt he thought that the State need not be a\r\nloser, if production, transport, warehousing and finance were organised\r\nas he meant to organise them; but there is also little doubt that he was\r\nmistaken, and that henceforward the “people” were really being fed\r\nlargely at the expense of the State, and lapsing into a condition of\r\nsemi-pauperism.\r\n\r\nI have said enough to show how sad was the failure of the first real\r\nstatesman produced by Rome. Yet Gracchus was able to do some useful work\r\nwhich survived. Under his auspices was passed a great law, of the text\r\nof which we still possess about one-third, for the trial of provincial\r\ngovernors accused of extortion: and we know of another, bearing his own\r\nname, which regulated the succession to these governorships with justice\r\nand wisdom. Also he took up his brother’s land bill, and carried it on\r\nwith that practical persistency which is reflected, as we saw, in\r\nPlutarch’s life of him. But in spite of high aims and some successes,\r\nhis story is a sad one; and the loss to Italy and the Empire at that\r\nmoment of a man of righteous aims and practical genius was simply\r\nincalculable.\r\n\r\nWhatever else the Gracchi did, or failed to do, they undoubtedly\r\nsucceeded, both in their lives and in their deaths, in shaking the power\r\nand prestige of the senatorial government; and nothing had been put in\r\nits place, nor had it even been reformed. Henceforward for a long period\r\nthere was no constitution that could claim an honest man’s loyalty or\r\ndevotion; the idea of the State was growing dim, and the result was\r\ninefficiency in every department. The governing class was corrupt and\r\nthe army undisciplined, and this at a time when there was coming upon\r\nRome, and upon the civilised world, a period of extreme peril from\r\nforeign enemies. This corruption and inefficiency became obvious a few\r\nyears after the death of the younger Gracchus in a long struggle with a\r\nNumidian chief in the province of Africa, who contrived to outwit and\r\ndefy Roman envoys and Roman armies, by taking advantage of the\r\ncorruptibility of the one and the indiscipline of the other. Luckily for\r\nRome this war produced a great soldier in Gaius Marius, a “new man” of\r\nItalian birth, and another in L. Cornelius Sulla, a man of high\r\npatrician family; and these two, though destined to be the bitterest\r\nfoes, brought the war to a successful end.\r\n\r\nBut a far greater peril was threatening Italy herself. As we look at the\r\nmap of Italy, or better still (if we have the chance) as we look up at\r\nthe huge rampart of the Alps from the plain of the Po, we are tempted to\r\nthink of this great barrier as impenetrable. But mountain ranges are\r\nalways weak lines of defence, and history, ancient and modern alike, has\r\nabundantly proved that Italy is open to invasion from the north.\r\nHannibal and his brother had pierced the western flank of the range,\r\nwhere later on there were regular thoroughfares between Rome and her\r\nwestern provinces; and at the eastern end, where the passes gradually\r\nlessen in height, access was easy into Italy from the north-east. Beyond\r\nthis mountain barrier, at the time we have now reached, there was much\r\ndisturbance going on: hungry masses of population were moving about in\r\nsearch of fertile land to settle in, themselves pressed on by other\r\npeoples in the same restless condition. In 113 B.C. a great migrating\r\nhost, apparently of Germans, but probably gathering other peoples as it\r\nadvanced, seemed to threaten the weak point of the eastern Alps.\r\n\r\nA consul with an army was in Illyria, and tried to stop them in the\r\ncountry now called Carinthia, but was badly beaten. If there had been a\r\nman of genius at their head, the enemy might have penetrated into Italy;\r\nas happened again just a century later, there was nothing to stop them\r\nbetween the Alps and Rome. But the great host was not tempted, and\r\npursued its way westward. In 109 they suddenly appeared beyond the\r\nwestern Alps, where they destroyed another consular army, and yet\r\nanother fell before the Gauls of that region. Then in 105, at Orange, in\r\nRoman territory, while trying to cover the road to Massilia and so into\r\nItaly, the Romans experienced a defeat almost as terrible as that of\r\nCannæ and half the Empire lay open to the victors. But once again they\r\nleft their prey untouched, and passed westwards in search of easier\r\nconquests.\r\n\r\nRome had a breathing-time of nearly three years, and she also had the\r\nright man to save her. Marius remodelled the army, revolutionising it in\r\nequipment, tactics, and discipline. For material he was driven hard, and\r\nhad to find recruits as best he could, drawing them from all parts of\r\nthe Empire: but he had time to drill them into fine soldiers, and to lay\r\nthe foundation of a marvellously perfect human defence for Mediterranean\r\ncivilisation. The result was one great victory near Marseilles, and\r\nanother at the eastern end of north Italy, into which the barbarians had\r\nat last penetrated: and Italy was once more secure.\r\n\r\nNow we have to see how this peril, or rather the effort made to escape\r\nit, led to changes of the most far-reaching character in the Roman power\r\nand polity. Italy had not been saved by Roman armies or the Roman\r\ngovernment, but by Marius and the army which he had created. For five\r\nsuccessive years Marius was consul, contrary to all precedent, away from\r\nRome; and the army he created looked to him, not to Rome, for pay,\r\npromotion, and discharge. We may call that host of his a Mediterranean\r\narmy under the command of an Italian. It was far more like Hannibal’s\r\narmy than like the old Roman citizen armies that had won the supremacy\r\nin Italy; it was a professional army devoted to its general, but with\r\nlittle thought of the Roman State whose servant he was. And\r\nhenceforward, until Augustus restored the sense of duty to the State,\r\nthe Roman armies, excellent now as fighting machines, and destined to\r\nsecure effective frontiers for the Empire, were the men of Marius,\r\nSulla, Pompey, Cæsar, and a constant source of anxiety and danger for\r\nthe State whom they were supposed to serve.\r\n\r\nThis “long-service army” brought Rome face to face with another\r\ndifficulty, and led indirectly to another great peril. When the soldiers\r\nreturned home after many years of service in distant regions, what was\r\nto be done with them? Many, perhaps most of them, had no homes to go to.\r\nThe veterans might naturally demand some permanent settlement, but the\r\nSenate showed no sign of appreciating the problem, and in this matter\r\nthe general was helpless without the Senate. So it happened that many of\r\nthem lapsed into the crowded city, to pick up a living we know not how,\r\nwith the help of the distribution of cheap corn. Among them were beyond\r\ndoubt numbers of non-citizens, who could not legally vote in elections\r\nor legislation, and were inadequately protected in regard to person and\r\nproperty, in spite of all the long service they had gone through. These\r\nmen began to offer themselves as voters, and to exercise the rights of\r\ncitizenship illegally; yet the confusion of the registers was such that\r\nthey could not be detected. At last the adulteration of the Roman\r\ncitizen body became so obvious that the consuls of 95 B.C. passed a law\r\nwith the object of making it clear who was a citizen and who was not,\r\nand of eliminating those who were not really privileged.\r\n\r\nBut it was now too late to take such a step. News of it spread over all\r\nItaly, and it was construed as a deliberate attempt to exclude Italians\r\nfrom the citizenship. Five years later another vain attempt was made by\r\na noble tribune to do as Gracchus had wished to do, to extend the\r\ncitizenship and to enlarge the Senate: but he was assassinated before\r\nhis laws were passed, and then at last there followed the inevitable\r\noutbreak, perhaps long meditated. The social war, as it is called, in\r\nreality a civil war, was a crisis in the history of European\r\ndevelopment. When it was over, the ancient city-state of the Greeks and\r\nItalians had vanished in Italy, and in its place arose a new form of\r\npolity, for which there was then no name.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy peoples of central Italy entered on the desperate venture of\r\nsetting up a rival power against Rome; a plan which, if successful,\r\nwould have paralysed Rome’s work in the world whether for good or evil.\r\nThey chose the city of Corfinium, in the heart of the Apennines, some\r\nhundred miles east of Rome, gave it the new significant name Italica,\r\nand made it, as Washington is now, the city-centre of a federation,\r\nwhere deputies from the various members should meet and deliberate under\r\nthe presidency of consuls. But now was seen the value of the strategical\r\nposition of Rome. She could strike in any direction from inner lines,\r\nwhile safe from attack or blockade by sea; but Corfinium had no such\r\nnatural strategic advantage, nor any unifying power. Yet the Italians\r\nwere for some time successful in the field, and Rome was for a whole\r\nyear in the utmost peril. At the end of that year (90 B.C.) the\r\nEtruscans and Umbrians to north and east joined the confederates, and\r\nthen for the first time Rome was likely to be put on the defensive, with\r\nenemies on her left flank, as well as on her right and in front. So a\r\nlaw was hastily passed giving the precious citizenship to all who had\r\nnot taken up arms; and this was the beginning of a process by which, in\r\nsome few years, the whole of Italy became Roman in the eye of the law,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, it might be said not untruly that Rome became\r\nItalian. Henceforward we have to think of the whole peninsula as forming\r\nthe material support of Mediterranean civilisation.\r\n\r\nWith this great change one might have expected that peace and harmony\r\nwould return to Italy. But, on the contrary, she is now about to enter\r\non the most terrible time that she has ever known; even her miserable\r\nfeuds of the late Middle Ages never quite reached the horror of those of\r\nMarius and Sulla. It is hard to explain this; but looking back at what\r\nwas said in the last chapter about the causes of demoralisation, it is\r\npossible to make a guess. We have to think of a vast slave State, worn\r\nout in the struggle with dangers within and without, enfeebled by\r\nconstant warfare, and now given over into the hands of powerful military\r\nmasters, with hosts of veterans at their beck and call. The State seemed\r\nto have lost its claim to loyalty, even to consideration: and in its\r\nplace were rival generals, leaders also of political factions—in these\r\nyears two, Marius the self-seeking champion of the Italians and the\r\nRoman plebs, and Sulla the self-seeking champion of the old aristocracy.\r\nAll principles were lost on either side in the intensely bitter hatred\r\nof the parties and the personal rivalry of the leading men. It happened\r\nthat a war was threatening in the East, of which we shall hear more in\r\nthe next chapter; and the command in this war, the great prize of the\r\nmoment, became a bone of contention outweighing all interest of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe prize fell to Sulla; but no sooner was his back turned on Italy than\r\nthe Marian faction fell on their political enemies and sought to destroy\r\nthem by wholesale murder. Compromise was utterly forgotten; all the\r\nbrutality of unbridled human nature was let loose. And when Sulla\r\nreturned from the East, after driving the enemy out of Roman territory,\r\nthe massacres were revenged by more massacres. The loss to Italy of many\r\nthousands of her best men, and among them scores who might have done\r\ngood work in the world, was a calamity never to be repaired.\r\n\r\nWhere, one may ask, was the old Roman _gravitas_ and _pietas_, the\r\nself-restraint and sense of duty that had won an empire? It would seem\r\nas if the capacity for discipline were entirely lost, except in the\r\nlong-service army. But the mere fact that in the army this survived is\r\none not to be neglected, even if it were exercised less on behalf of the\r\nState than in the interest of the individual commander. For if there\r\ncould be found a statesman-soldier who could identify himself with the\r\ntrue interest of the State, and so bring back not only the army, but the\r\npeople to a right idea of Rome’s position and duty in the world, the\r\nEmpire and civilisation might yet be saved. Without the army these could\r\nnot be defended; and the one thing wanting was to make the army loyal to\r\nthe State as well as to its general. Only the general himself could\r\nsecure this loyalty, by making himself the true servant of the State.\r\n\r\nBut the man into whose hands Rome had now fallen was one who could not\r\npossibly identify himself with the best interests of the State, because\r\nan unsympathetic nature had denied him the power of discerning what\r\nthose interests were. Sulla has been compared to Napoleon, and in one or\r\ntwo points the comparison holds good; but the two were utterly unlike in\r\nthe main point, the power of sympathetic discernment. Napoleon, cruel\r\nand unscrupulous as he often was, showed plainly, when he organised the\r\ninstitutions of France, or Switzerland, or Egypt, that he understood the\r\nneeds of those nations: he divined what would enable them to advance out\r\nof stagnation to some better form of life, social and political. But\r\nSulla, though he saw that the call of the moment was for order at almost\r\nany price, for peace, strong government, and reform, went about his work\r\nin a way which proved that he did not delight in it, or care for the\r\npeople for whom he was legislating. He did what was necessary for the\r\nmoment, but did it with force ill concealed under constitutional forms.\r\nSo no wise man rejoiced in his work, and the Roman people as a whole\r\nfelt no loyalty towards him. He provided in many State departments an\r\nexcellent machinery, but not the motive force to work it.\r\n\r\nNothing in history shows better how much in remedial legislation depends\r\non the spirit in which it is undertaken. Sulla saw that the great\r\ncouncil, the Senate, must be the central point and pivot of government,\r\nunless indeed there were a master at hand, like himself, to undertake\r\nit; that the popular assemblies, untrained in discussion and affairs,\r\ncould not do the work of administration. Though the theory of the\r\nconstitution had always been that the people were sovereign, he\r\ncontrived that the Senate, which had so long practically governed under\r\nan unwritten constitution, should now rule without let or hindrance on a\r\nbasis of statute law; and here we see an unwritten constitution growing\r\ninto a written one, as with us Britons at this moment. By a great law of\r\ntreason, the first on the Roman statute book, he made it almost\r\nimpossible to defy the Senate without the risk of political effacement.\r\n\r\nThis may be called reactionary, but under the circumstances it was not a\r\nreaction to be complained of. The pity was that this master legislator\r\nhad really none to be grateful or loyal to him but his own army and\r\nfollowers. His constitutional legislation was for the most part swept\r\naway soon after his death, and there was no one to lament. On the other\r\nhand, all that he did that was not strictly political, and in particular\r\nhis reorganisation of what we may call the civil service, and of the\r\ncriminal law and procedure, was so obviously progressive and valuable\r\nthat no one ever attempted to destroy it; and some of his laws of this\r\nkind held good throughout Roman history.\r\n\r\nSulla attained his power in 81 B.C., resigned it in 79, and died next\r\nyear at his villa on the warm Campanian coast, where he had gone to\r\nenjoy himself in self-indulgence and literary dilettantism. Here he\r\nwrote that autobiography of which some few fragments have come down to\r\nus in Plutarch’s _Life_ of him—a life which will repay the reader, even\r\nin translation. One of these fragments has always seemed to me to throw\r\nreal light on the man’s strange nature, and on the imperfection of his\r\nwork. “All my most happy resolutions,” he wrote, “have been the result,\r\nnot of reasoning, but of momentary inspiration.” In other words, Sulla\r\ndid not believe in thinking over a problem, and herein he was a true\r\nRoman. He hoped to do the right thing on the spur of the moment. Thus it\r\nwas that no one ever knew what he would do; no one could trust him nor\r\nbelieve in him. Like so many in that and succeeding ages he believed\r\nprofoundly in Fortune: he called himself Sulla the Fortunate, and gave\r\nlike names to his two children. What exactly he meant by Fortuna we\r\ncannot say; but we may be sure that it was no such conception of a power\r\nruling the world as might guide a statesman’s feet out of the path of\r\nself-seeking into a more bracing region of high endeavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                         THE REVOLUTION: ACT II\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the death of Sulla ends what we may call the first act of the Roman\r\nRevolution. We are now in the middle of a revolution in more than one\r\nsense of that word. The constitution and the government of Rome are\r\nbeing slowly but surely changed, and at the same time the era of the\r\nfree and independent city-state of the Græco-Roman world is being\r\nbrought to an end. Both these changes, as we can see now, were\r\ninevitable; without them the civilised world could not have been\r\ndefended against barbarian invasion, or Italy united into a contented\r\nwhole possessed of Roman citizenship. In the first act, as I have called\r\nit, the immediate danger of invasion was checked, both in north and\r\neast, and Italy had become Roman, enjoying perfect equality with Rome\r\nunder the great body of Roman law now being rapidly developed.\r\n\r\nBut, in truth, this inevitable work of change was not as yet half done.\r\nIt was soon found that both in north and east some definite system of\r\nfrontier must be fixed, or the Empire would be in continual peril from\r\nwithout. It was also found that Sulla’s constitution would not work, and\r\nthat to defend the frontiers of civilisation effectively there must be a\r\ngovernment of sterner force, whatever form that force might take. Thus\r\nin the second act of the Revolution we have two main points to attend\r\nto: first, the settlement of the frontiers against Oriental despots and\r\nwandering hordes of Germans: secondly, the acquisition of power by a\r\ngreat soldier-statesman, Julius Cæsar, and the abandonment, as a working\r\npower, of the ancient polity of Senate and people. And inasmuch as this\r\nperiod of revolution was also the age of the best and purest bloom of\r\nLatin literature, I must find space for a few words about Cicero,\r\nLucretius, and Catullus.\r\n\r\nI said in the last chapter that there was a very dangerous enemy\r\nthreatening the eastern or Greek part of the Empire. This was\r\nMithradates, king of Pontus, that part of Asia Minor which borders on\r\nthe Euxine (Black Sea) eastwards: a man of genius and ambition, and by\r\nno means to be reckoned a barbarian. It is curious that he began his\r\ngreat career by protecting Greek cities against their enemies, and one\r\nis tempted to ask whether he might not have been at least as beneficent\r\na champion and master for the Greek world as Rome herself. But we must\r\nlook at things with Roman eyes if we are to understand the work of Rome\r\nin the world; we must think of Mithradates as the Romans then did, as\r\nthe deadly enemy alike of Greek freedom and of Roman interests.\r\n\r\nHis armies had invaded Greece in 87 B.C. and had even occupied Athens,\r\nwhile the Greek cities of Asia Minor had willingly submitted to him: the\r\nwhole Hellenic world was fast coming under his sway. Then Sulla had\r\nexpelled his generals from Greece proper, and had forced him to accept\r\nsuch conditions of peace as kept him quiet for a few years. But when\r\nSulla was dead he started on a fresh career of conquest, and once more\r\nthe Roman protectorate of Greek civilisation was broken down. For a time\r\nit looked as if no power could restore it. The sea was swarming with\r\npirates from Cilicia, who constantly harassed the Roman fleets, and\r\nventured even as far as Italy, snapping up prisoners for sale as slaves\r\nin the great slave-market at Delos. And behind Mithradates and these\r\npirates there was another power even more formidable. Tigranes, king of\r\nArmenia, had also been extending his dominions southward, and was even\r\nin possession of Syria and Judæa at the time of which we are now\r\nspeaking, 75 B.C. Should the two kings unite their forces and policy, it\r\nwould be all but impossible for Rome to remain the mistress of the\r\neastern Mediterranean and the Hellenic world. It was another example of\r\nRome’s wonderful good fortune that this alliance was never solidly\r\neffected till too late.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, left by Sulla to govern the world, soon showed that it was\r\nincapable of grasping the necessity of vigorous action in the East. It\r\nwas not till 74, four years after Sulla’s death, that they sent out a\r\nreally capable general with an adequate force. Lucullus, whose name has\r\nbecome a by-word for wealth and luxury, was in his prime a soldier of\r\ngreat ability, and he soon broke the power of Mithradates, who\r\nimmediately fled for refuge to Tigranes. This made it absolutely\r\nnecessary to deal with that king also; and Lucullus invaded Armenia and\r\ncaptured the king’s new capital, Tigranocerta. Unluckily, he had not\r\nthat supreme gift of a great commander which enables him, as it\r\nafterwards enabled Cæsar, to lead his men where and when he will; the\r\narmy mutinied, refusing to go farther into the wild Armenian mountains,\r\nthe most distant and formidable region a Roman army had as yet\r\npenetrated. Lucullus had to retreat.\r\n\r\nThen, under pressure from the men of business who were losing money by\r\nthe instability of Roman dominion in Asia, Senate and people agreed to\r\nsupersede Lucullus by a younger man, reckoned the best soldier of the\r\nday, and a military pupil of Sulla. This was the famous Gnæus Pompeius,\r\nknown to us familiarly as Pompey. In 67 he had been commissioned to\r\nclear the sea of pirates, and did it effectually. Now, with a\r\ncombination of civil and military power such as no Roman had yet\r\nenjoyed, he took over Lucullus’s army, made short work of Mithradates,\r\nand utterly broke up the empire of Tigranes. He overran Syria, the\r\nregion between the Mediterranean and the desert stretching to the\r\nEuphrates, penetrated to Judæa and took Jerusalem. This famous event is\r\nthe first in the long and sad story of the relations of Rome with Judæa.\r\nAt Jericho, before he reached the holy city, he received the dispatch\r\nwhich told him of the death of Mithradates, the removal from the scene\r\nof one who had been for thirty years Rome’s most dangerous enemy.\r\n\r\nThe result of the efforts of Lucullus and Pompey was the establishment\r\nof a frontier system in the East which may be said to have held good for\r\nthe rest of Roman history. The principle of it is not easy to explain;\r\nbut if the reader will take a map and trace the river Euphrates from its\r\nsources in western Armenia to the Arabian desert, and then make it clear\r\nto himself that all within that line was to be either Roman or under\r\nRoman suzerainty, he will be able to form some idea of its importance in\r\nhistory. There were to be three new Roman provinces: Pontus with\r\nBithynia in the north of Asia Minor, Cilicia on its south-eastern coast,\r\nand Syria, the coast region from Cilicia southwards to the frontier of\r\nEgypt. But between these and the Euphrates there were two kingdoms,\r\nCappadocia and Galatia, and other smaller ones, which formed _a Roman\r\nsphere of influence_ where Rome herself could not as yet be constantly\r\npresent. Imperfect as this system seems, it was quite strong enough to\r\nspread the prestige of the Roman Empire far and wide in the East, and\r\nthe great king of Parthia, beyond the Euphrates, might well begin to be\r\nalarmed for his own safety.\r\n\r\nNow in settling this frontier system Pompey had, of course, to attend to\r\nan infinite number of details, and to make decisions, convey privileges,\r\nnegotiate treaties, and grant charters, in dealing with those cities new\r\nand old which formed a most important part of his plan of settlement and\r\ndefence. All this had to be done on his own responsibility, but would\r\nneed the sanction of the Senate to be recognised as legally valid. When\r\nhe returned home in 62 B.C. he expected that the Senate would give this\r\nsanction, especially as he had just disbanded his army, with which he\r\nmight, if he had chosen, have enforced his claims. But the Senatorial\r\ngovernment was reduced to such a state of imbecility that the majority\r\nwould have nothing to do with Pompey’s invaluable work: they were\r\njealous, they were lazy, and, above all, they were ignorant. So he had\r\nto fall back after a year or two on the consul of 59, C. Julius Cæsar,\r\nwho undertook to get the necessary sanction from the people if not from\r\nthe Senate. In return Pompey was to help him to get a long command in\r\nGaul, so that the work of frontier defence there begun by Marius might\r\nbe resumed and completed. At this very moment a German people, the\r\nSuebi, whose name still survives in the modern Swabia, were threatening\r\nthe rich plains of what is now eastern France: and then, just as a peace\r\nhad been patched up with them, a Gallic tribe, the Helvetii, suddenly\r\nissuing from its home in (modern) Switzerland in search of new\r\nsettlements, or pressed on by other tribes beyond it, was about to break\r\ninto the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul. But Cæsar had now done his\r\npart by Pompey, though not, indeed, without straining the constitution;\r\nand moving with the wonderful swiftness that afterwards became\r\ncharacteristic of him as a general, he reached Geneva just in time to\r\nstop them, and soon afterwards beat them in a great battle and forced\r\nthem back to their homes.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of a career of conquest which made the glorious\r\ncountry we know as France into the most valuable part of the Roman\r\nEmpire, and later on into the most compact and gifted nationality in\r\nEurope. What motives inspired Cæsar in all he did during the nine years\r\nhe spent there we need not ask, for we can only guess the answer; though\r\nhe has left us his own story of his campaigns in simple straightforward\r\nLatin, he has not chosen to tell us what was all along at the back of\r\nhis mind. Ambition, says the superficial historian; the desire to make\r\nhimself in due time tyrant of Rome and the Empire. But we may take it as\r\ncertain that Cæsar, a man whose health was never strong, would not have\r\nexposed himself to constant peril of his life for nine successive years\r\nhad he really all the time been nursing a secret ambition which death or\r\nserious illness might at any time destroy. What he really seems to have\r\nloved, like C. Gracchus, was work—steady, hard work with no one to\r\nhinder him, and with a definite practical object before him. Doubtless\r\nfurther hopes or fears were in his mind, but this great practical\r\ngenius, with an intellect characteristically Roman,[10] though more\r\nscientific in its tendency than that of any other Roman known to us, was\r\nalways bent on the work immediately in front of him, and never rested\r\ntill it was completed to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWhen Cæsar hurried up to check the Helvetii in 58 B.C. there was but one\r\nRoman province in Gaul, the south-eastern part of modern France (which\r\nstill teems with Roman remains and inscriptions), together with a\r\nconsiderable district to the west of it at the foot of the Pyrenees.\r\nWhen he finally left Gaul at the end of 50, the whole of modern France\r\nand Belgium had been added to the Empire, though not as yet organised\r\ninto provinces. He did not take long to reach our Channel and to subdue\r\nthe tribes on the coast; he began the written history of our island by\r\ninvading it twice, and recording such information as he could gain about\r\nits geography and inhabitants. He crossed the Rhine into Germany by a\r\nbridge constructed for him by his engineers: and the method of building\r\nthis bridge survives in his book to puzzle the ingenuity of scholars as\r\nwell as school-boys. The Gauls were doubtless amazed at these\r\nperformances, as he meant them to be; and, after one heroic effort to\r\nsave themselves from becoming an appendage of a Mediterranean empire,\r\nthey had to submit. While we can feel with these noble efforts for\r\nfreedom, or blame Cæsar for what sometimes seems unnecessary cruelty, we\r\nmust remember that from this time forward the country from the Rhine to\r\nthe ocean becomes a great factor in European civilisation.\r\n\r\nThere was still, indeed, a gap in the line of frontier; how was the\r\neastern end of the Alps to be protected from invasion? There, as we saw,\r\nthe great rampart was lowest, and beyond it the barbarians were an\r\nunknown quantity. Here the river Danube eventually became the frontier,\r\nand was carefully connected with that of the Rhine; but this completion\r\nof the great work had to wait for half-a-century, and in the meantime\r\nluckily no inroad was made or threatened. It was Tiberius, afterwards\r\nemperor, another great soldier, with an army almost as devoted to its\r\ngeneral as that of Cæsar who after long steady effort planted the Roman\r\npower firmly in this region. From a military point of view the Roman\r\nEmpire, and therefore Western civilisation as a whole, owed its very\r\nexistence for centuries to Pompey, Cæsar and Tiberius, with their\r\nsplendidly trained armies and their skilful engineers.\r\n\r\nAll this work of conquest and settlement was not the work of the State,\r\nor due to the old civic sense of duty and discipline; it was the work of\r\nthe armies, due to their good discipline, and to their loyalty to their\r\nleaders. This being so, it was of course only natural that the armies\r\nand their leaders should claim to control the action and policy of an\r\nenfeebled State, as Sulla had already claimed it. This is really, put in\r\na very few words, the secret of the Roman imperial system that was to\r\ncome; so, too, in England, in Cromwell’s time, the State passed into the\r\nhands of the army, because that army (though in our case but for a short\r\ntime) represented the best instincts and purposes of the nation. But the\r\nquestion of the moment was whether the commander of one of these Roman\r\narmies could so identify himself and his soldiers with the State and its\r\ntrue interests, as to become the means of establishing a sound and\r\nefficient government for the Mediterranean world. Sulla had failed so to\r\nidentify himself: he had neither knowledge enough nor sympathy enough.\r\nThe chance had been open to Pompey when he returned from the East in 62,\r\nbut he had disbanded his army and declined it; he was in many ways a\r\nvaluable man, but he was not the stuff that real statesmen are made of.\r\nAfter the long war in Gaul the chance was open to Cæsar, and he accepted\r\nit without hesitation.\r\n\r\nHe accepted it, but in truth he had to fight for it. For years his\r\noperations in Gaul had been looked on at Rome with suspicion, especially\r\nby a clique of personal enemies led by the famous Cato, a descendant of\r\nthe old Cato whom we met in the previous century. These men looked on\r\nCæsar as dangerous to the State—and dangerous indeed he was, to that old\r\nform of State which neither they nor he could make vigorous and\r\nefficient. They clung to the worn-out machinery of the constitution, to\r\nthe checks, the vetoes, the short tenure of office, to the exclusive\r\nright of the Senate to deal with the ever-increasing administrative\r\nbusiness of the Empire. Knowing, or guessing, that Cæsar, like Gaius\r\nGracchus, would force his personal will on the State if he judged it\r\nnecessary, they were determined to prevent his becoming a political\r\npower, and they brought Pompey to the same view, and armed him with\r\nmilitary force to be used against Cæsar—against the man, that is, who\r\nhad spent the best years of his life in indefatigable work for the\r\nEmpire and civilisation. The result was civil war once more; civil war\r\nthat might unquestionably have been averted by a wider outlook, a more\r\ngenerous feeling, a spirit of compromise, on the part of the high\r\naristocrats who, like Cato, believed themselves to be struggling for\r\nliberty. The liberty they were struggling for was in reality the liberty\r\nto misgovern the Empire, and to talk without acting efficiently.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, as we may learn from the abundant correspondence of the\r\ntime,[11] that they did not know the man they had to deal with. Cæsar\r\ntook them completely by surprise; in a few weeks he had cleared Pompey\r\nand Senate and their army out of Italy, had provided for the government,\r\nand gone off to Spain to secure the West by turning the Pompeian armies\r\nout of that peninsula also. After a brilliant campaign of six weeks,\r\nadmirably described by himself in his work on the Civil War, he forced\r\nthose armies to surrender and then let them go, as he had done just\r\nbefore in Italy. His clemency took the world by surprise as much as his\r\ngeneralship.\r\n\r\nBut the worst was not over for him. Pompey was gathering all the\r\nresources of the East against him, and concentrating them in Epirus with\r\na view to the re-conquest of Italy. Again Cæsar’s rapidity saved him; he\r\nwas just in time to strike the first blow by crossing the sea from\r\nBrindisi—a rash expedient—and hampering Pompey before his concentration\r\nwas effected. Here, however, in his eagerness to bring the campaign to\r\nan issue, he made a serious blunder, and had to pay for it by defeat and\r\na retreat to the corn-growing plain of Thessaly. Pompey unwisely\r\nfollowed him, instead of invading Italy; and here, in August 48, was\r\nutterly beaten at the battle of Pharsalia. The worn-out old soldier fled\r\nto Egypt, where he was treacherously murdered by one of the king’s\r\ngenerals. He was an estimable man with many excellent qualities, and in\r\na more tranquil age might have well become what Cicero wished to make\r\nhim, the presiding genius of the Roman State.\r\n\r\nCæsar had yet much war before him—war in Egypt, in Asia Minor, in Africa\r\nand in Spain, against the supporters of the old régime, for nothing he\r\ncould do in the way of conciliation would persuade them to forgive him\r\nthe crime of seeking to identify himself with the State. In doing so\r\nthey deprived him of the time which he might have spent to far better\r\npurpose at Rome on the work of efficient government. As it was, he had\r\nbeen able to spend but a few months in all at home, when on March 15, 44\r\nB.C., he was murdered at a meeting of the Senate, at the feet of\r\nPompey’s statue, by a small group of assassins, some of whom were\r\nintimate friends of his own. They thought he was on the point of\r\nassuming a visible despotism, and they had some justification for the\r\nsuspicion, though it was probably a delusion. To kill a tyrant, they\r\nthought, was to do a noble work in true old Roman fashion. So did the\r\nmurderers of the Gracchi.\r\n\r\nFrom what little we know about such work of reform as Cæsar had time\r\nfor, we may take it as certain that these deluded assassins made a sad\r\nblunder. Cæsar’s legislative work was fragmentary, but every item of it\r\nshows intelligence and political insight. He did not attempt to turn out\r\na new constitution in black and white; he did the work of government\r\nmainly himself for the time being, and we do not know how he meant to\r\nprovide for it after his death. In the most important matter of all, the\r\nadjustment of the Empire to the home government, and especially the\r\nsubordination of the provincial governors to a central authority, he\r\nforestalled the imperial system of the future: he made himself the\r\ncentral authority, to whom the governors were to be responsible. The\r\nother most important question of government, that of the power and\r\ncomposition of the Senate, he answered by raising the number of Senators\r\nto 900, as Gaius Gracchus had wished to do, and thus destroying the\r\npower of the old narrow oligarchical cliques. But perhaps his practical\r\nwisdom is best seen in his economic legislation for Rome and Italy. He\r\nwas the first statesman to try and check the over-abundance of\r\nslave-labour; the first, too, to lay the foundation of a reasonable\r\nbankruptcy law. He regulated the corn-supply in the city, and brought\r\ndown the number of recipients of corn-doles to less than one-half of\r\nwhat it had lately been. Again, he laid down general rules for the\r\nqualification of candidates for municipal office in Italy, and arranged\r\nfor the taking of a census in all the cities every five years, the\r\nrecords of which were to be deposited at Rome. It would seem as if he\r\nmeant to work out the enfranchisement of Italy to its natural\r\nconclusion: for he not only completed it by extending it to the Alps,\r\nwhich had never yet been done, but went beyond the bounds of Italy,\r\noffering the citizenship freely both to Gauls and Sicilians.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to depict Cæsar as almost more than human; and\r\nof late again there has been a reaction against him of no less\r\nabsurdity, holding him up to contempt as a weak but lucky opportunist.\r\nAs we have his own military writings, a life by Plutarch, a few letters\r\nwritten by or addressed to him, and innumerable allusions to him in\r\ncontemporary literature, we ought to be able to form some just idea of\r\nhim. As one who has been familiar with all these materials, and many\r\nothers of less value, during the greater part of a lifetime, I say\r\nwithout hesitation that Cæsar was the one man of his time really gifted\r\nwith _scientific intelligence_—with the power of seeing the facts before\r\nhim and adjusting his action to them. This intelligence, combined with\r\ngreat strength of will, made him master of the Roman Empire; and though\r\nhis character was by no means perfect, he seems to have used his\r\nmastership, not like a capricious Oriental despot, but with a real sense\r\nof responsibility. A man who combines the qualities of an intelligent\r\nstatesman in bad times with a generous temper, good taste and good\r\nscholarship, surely deserves to be thought of as one altogether out of\r\nthe common. In Shakespeare’s picture of him, derived from Plutarch’s\r\nbiography, and representing only the last two days of his life, he seems\r\nweak in body and overweening in spirit, and is probably meant to seem so\r\nby the dramatist for his own purposes. But no sooner have the murderers\r\ndone with him than the true greatness of the man begins to make itself\r\nfelt, and is impressed on us in page after page to the end of the play,\r\nof which the action may be said to be pivoted on the idea of the horror\r\nand the uselessness of their deed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far in this chapter and the last I have been treating of this age as\r\none of action. It is indeed filled full of human activity, in spite of\r\nthe laziness of the governing class as a whole. But this activity was\r\nshown not only in war and politics; this is also an age of great poets\r\nand real men of letters. I must say a word about the two greatest poets,\r\nLucretius and Catullus; but among the men of letters there stands out\r\none far above the rest whose life and genius it would take a long\r\nchapter to explain. Cicero’s pre-eminence is not easy to understand even\r\nafter long study of his voluminous works: yet I must try to make it\r\nclear that he was, in fact, one of the greatest of all Romans.\r\n\r\nOf Lucretius it is our fate to know nothing except his poem in six books\r\non “The Nature of Things.” But his name is Roman, and the poem has the\r\ntrue Roman characteristic of being essentially practical in its object.\r\nThat object will seem a singular one to those who are unacquainted with\r\nthe Greek and Roman culture of this age. What roused a poet’s passion in\r\nthis man’s mind was simply the desire to free others, as he had freed\r\nhimself, from the fetters of superstition, or, as he calls it,\r\n_religion_; to make them abandon the delusive dream of a life after\r\ndeath, to repudiate the old stories of torment in Hades, and all foolish\r\nlegends of the gods, who in his view took no interest whatever in human\r\nlife. All this was, of course, derived from Greek philosophy, the\r\ndoctrine of the Epicurean school, but no Greek had ever put such passion\r\ninto a creed as Lucretius. His poetry at times almost reminds us of the\r\ngrandeur and authority of the Hebrew prophets, so ardently did he\r\nbelieve in his own creed, and in his mission to enforce it on others.\r\nUncouth and dry as much of it is—for he has to explain that Epicurean\r\ntheory of the universe known still to science as the atomic theory—he\r\nbreaks out now and again into strains of magnificent verse which reveal\r\na mind all burning within. Here is a specimen: it must be in prose, for\r\nno verse translation seems adequate—\r\n\r\n  “What hast thou, O mortal, so much at heart, that thou goest such\r\n  lengths in sickly sorrows? Why bemoan and bewail death? for say that\r\n  thy life past and gone has been welcome to thee, and that thy\r\n  blessings have not all, as if they were poured into a sieve, run\r\n  through and been lost without avail: why not then take thy departure\r\n  like a guest filled with life, and with resignation, thou fool, enter\r\n  upon untroubled rest? But if all that thou hast enjoyed has been\r\n  squandered and lost, and if life is a grievance, why seek to make any\r\n  addition, ... why not rather make an end of life and travail? for\r\n  there is nothing which I can contrive or discover for thee to give\r\n  pleasure: all things are ever the same” (iii. 933 foll.).\r\n\r\nThe other poet, Catullus, was not of Roman birth, but, like so many\r\nliterary men of this and the following age, an Italian from the basin of\r\nthe Po. He had no practical aim in writing poetry: he simply wrote\r\nbecause he could not help it, about himself and his friends and his\r\nloves. It was his own self that inspired him chiefly, and it is still\r\nhimself that interests us. According to his own mood, now fresh with the\r\nhappiness of an artist, now darkened by anger or self-indulgence, his\r\npoems are exquisite or repulsive; but they are always true and honest\r\nlyrics, and interesting because they are so full of life and passion.\r\nCatullus is one of the world’s best lyric poets. Here is one of his\r\ngems—\r\n\r\n  “Is aught of pleasure, aught of solace sweet\r\n    Permitted, Calvus, to the silent grave,\r\n  What time the tale of sorrow we repeat,\r\n    Yearning o’er memories we fain would save?\r\n\r\n  Know this. From Love and Friendship if a tear\r\n    Can make its way into that silentness,\r\n  Quintilia feels untimely Death less drear,\r\n    For hearing of the love that still can bless.”\r\n                                           Catullus, xcvi. (by S. T. I).\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to the man of letters who has given his name to this\r\nperiod of literature, which indeed draws more than half its interest\r\nfrom him and from his works. Marcus Tullius Cicero was an Italian, and\r\nhad little of the Roman character in his make; he came from the town of\r\nArpinum, among the foothills of the Apennines some sixty miles\r\nsouth-east of Rome. He made his way into Roman society by his social and\r\nconversational powers, and by his capacity for friendship, and into the\r\nfield of politics by his great gift of oratory, which was now\r\nindispensable for public men. As a “new man” he never was really at home\r\nwith the high aristocracy, but he was a man of many friends for all\r\nthat, and reckoned among them all the great men of his time, including\r\nboth Cæsar and Pompey. His best and truest friend, who worked for him\r\nall his life with unsparing care, was a man of business who stood\r\noutside of politics, Pomponius Atticus; and of Cicero’s letters to this\r\nfaithful friend and adviser nearly four hundred survive to prove the\r\nreality of that lifelong devotion. Some five hundred letters to and from\r\nother correspondents are also extant, and the whole collection forms the\r\nmost fascinating record of a great man’s life and thoughts that has come\r\ndown to us from classical antiquity.\r\n\r\nSince Mommsen wrote his famous _History of Rome_, in which he was almost\r\nignored, Cicero has often been treated with contempt as a shallow\r\nthinker, deriving all his inspiration from Greek originals, and as a\r\nfeeble statesman, brilliant only as an orator. It is true that there is\r\na want of _grit_ in much that Cicero wrote: he was the child of his age,\r\nnever tired of writing and talking, little used to profound thinking,\r\nand rarely acting with independent vigour. But he has two claims on the\r\ngratitude of posterity which should never be forgotten. First, he made\r\nLatin into the most perfect language of prose that the world as yet has\r\nknown. The echoes of his beautiful style can be heard centuries\r\nafterwards in the Latin fathers of Christianity, especially St.\r\nAugustine and Lactantius, and they are still audible in the best French\r\nand Italian prose-writers of to-day. Secondly, of all Romans Cicero is\r\nthe one best known to us as an individual human being: and few indeed\r\nwho have had the chance to become really familiar with him can fail to\r\nlove him as his own friends loved him. He was not the stuff of which\r\nstrong statesmen are made; he was too dependent on the support and\r\napproval of others to inspire men with zeal for a cause—especially for a\r\nlosing cause. His own consulship was brilliant, for he was able to\r\ncombine the best elements in the State in the cause of order as against\r\nanarchy—anarchy which threatened the very existence of Rome as a city;\r\nand at the end of his life he showed the same ability to use a strong\r\ncombination to good purpose in the political field. But he was not of\r\nsuch strong growth as to mark out a line of his own, and at some unhappy\r\nmoments of his life his weakness is apt to move our pity, if not our\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nBut with all his weak points Cicero is one of the best and greatest of\r\nall Romans. His gifts were rich, and he used them well. We know him as a\r\nman of pure life in an impure age, and as one who never used his gifts\r\nor opportunities to do harm to others, whether political enemies or\r\nhelpless provincials. We know him, too, as a faithful husband and a\r\ndevoted father. And lastly, we know that he was not lacking in courage\r\nwhen the assassin overtook him—the last of a long list of great men of\r\nthat age to die a violent death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n                AUGUSTUS—THE REVIVAL OF THE ROMAN SPIRIT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Julius Cæsar seemed to plunge the world once more into\r\ndarkness. We have evidence enough of the general feeling of horror and\r\ndespair,—a despair hard to realise in our days, when settled and orderly\r\ngovernment saves us from all serious anxiety about our lives and\r\nproperty. Power fell into the hands of a far more unscrupulous man than\r\nCæsar, the Mark Antony of Shakespeare’s play; but he had a rival in\r\nCæsar’s nephew and adopted son, afterwards known as Augustus. Civil war,\r\nof course, followed: first, war between these two and the murderers of\r\nJulius, and then war between the two victors. Antony, who had in a\r\ndivision of the Empire taken the eastern half, and married Cleopatra,\r\nthe beautiful queen of Egypt, was crushed at the naval battle of Actium:\r\nthe Empire became once more united, and hope began to spring up afresh.\r\n\r\nInstead of following the melancholy history of these years (44 to 31\r\nB.C.) let us try to realise the need of a complete change in men’s minds\r\nand in the ways of government, if the Roman Empire was to be preserved,\r\nand Mediterranean civilisation with it. We can best do this by learning\r\nsomething of the two men who more than all others brought about the\r\nchange: Virgil, the greatest of Roman poets, and Augustus, the most\r\nfortunate and discerning of Roman statesmen. Augustus began a new system\r\nof government, based, no doubt, on the ideas of Julius, which lasted,\r\ngradually developing itself, till the fifth century of our era. Virgil,\r\nthe poet of the new Roman spirit, kept that spirit alive into the Middle\r\nAges, and rightly read, he keeps it still before us.\r\n\r\nIf Virgil had lived in an ordinary age, when the flow of events was\r\nsmooth and unruffled, he might have been a great poet, but hardly one of\r\nthe world’s greatest. But he lived in a crisis of the history of\r\ncivilisation, and he was called to do his part in it. For a century\r\nbefore he wrote, the one great fact in the world was the marvellous\r\ngrowth of the Roman dominion. When he was born, seventy years before the\r\nChristian era, Rome was the only great civilised power left, and a few\r\nyears later it looked as if she had not even a barbarian rival to menace\r\nher, except the Parthians far away in the East. The Roman was\r\neverywhere, fighting, trading, ruling; nothing of importance could be\r\ndone without the thought—What will Rome say to it?\r\n\r\nYet just as Virgil was growing to manhood it became obvious, as we have\r\nseen, that this great power was in reality on the verge of breaking up.\r\nShe had abandoned justice and duty, and given herself to greed and\r\npleasure. Her government was rapacious: she was sucking the life-blood\r\nof the nations. She had lost her old virtues of self-sacrifice, purity\r\nof family life, reverence for the divine. The rulers of the world had\r\nlost the sense of duty and discipline; they were divided into jarring\r\npolitical factions, and had felt the bitterness of civil war, in which\r\nmen killed each other in cold blood almost for the sake of killing. But\r\nwith Julius Cæsar’s strong hand and generous temper it must have seemed\r\nto many that a better time was coming, and among these was the young\r\npoet from Mantua under the rampart of the Alps.\r\n\r\nNo one who knows Virgil’s poems well can have any doubt that all his\r\nhopes for himself and his family, for Italy and the Empire, were bound\r\nup with the family of the Cæsars. The sub-alpine region in which he was\r\nborn and bred had been for ten years of his boyhood and youth under the\r\npersonal rule of the great Julius, and had supplied him with the flower\r\nof that famous army that had conquered first Gaul and then the world. It\r\nis possible that the poet owed his position as a Roman citizen to the\r\nenlightened policy of Cæsar. Even now we cannot read without a thrill of\r\nhorror the splendid lines in which he records the eclipse of the sun and\r\nthe mourning of all nature when the great man was murdered by so-called\r\npatriots.[12] With such patriots, with the rapacious republican\r\noligarchy, he could have had no sympathy, and there is not a trace of it\r\nin his poems. When, during the civil wars that followed the murder, he\r\nwas turned out of his ancestral farm near Mantua to make room for\r\nveteran soldiers, he owed the recovery of it to the master of those\r\nsoldiers, the second Cæsar, whom henceforward he regarded not only as\r\nhis own protector and friend, but as the one hope of the Empire.\r\n\r\nNow this younger Cæsar, nephew and adopted son of Julius, though not a\r\ngreat soldier or a hero in any sense, was yet one of those rare men who\r\nlearn wisdom in adversity, and use it to overcome passion and violence\r\nin themselves and others. He came gradually to see that Italy and the\r\nworld could not be rescued from misery and despair by war and strong\r\ngovernment alone. He grasped the fact, which Sulla had missed, that the\r\none thing wanting was loyalty—loyalty to himself and belief in his\r\nmission: loyalty to Rome and Italy, and belief in their mission in the\r\nworld. Confidence in him, and in the destiny of Rome, might create in\r\nmen’s minds a hope for the future, a new self-respect, almost a new\r\nfaith. Divided and depressed as they were, he wanted to set new ideals\r\nbefore them, and to get them to help him loyally towards the realisation\r\nof those ideals. Economically, morally, religiously, Italy was to rise\r\nto new life in an era of peace and justice.\r\n\r\nThis may seem too grand an ideal for a man like Augustus Cæsar, who (as\r\nI have said) was no hero, and who certainly was no philosopher. But it\r\nis none the less true that he understood that “peace hath her victories\r\nno less renowned than war”: and that his own conviction, based, perhaps,\r\non shrewd political reasonings, inspired his poets and historians to\r\nhail a new age of peace and prosperity. In one way or another they all\r\nfell in with his ideas. Their themes are the glory and beauty of Italy,\r\nthe greatness of Rome, the divine power which had given her the right to\r\nrule the world, and the story of the way in which she had come to\r\nexercise that right. But as Virgil is the greatest figure in the group,\r\nso is his _Æneid_ the greatest work in which those ideas are\r\nimmortalised. The Roman Empire has vanished, the ancient city, which\r\nrose in fresh magnificence under Augustus, has crumbled away; but the\r\n_Æneid_ remains the one enduring monument of that age of new hope.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Augustus himself suggested to the poet the subject of\r\nthe _Æneid_. If so, it was characteristic of a man who used every chance\r\nof extending his own fame and influence without forcing them on the\r\nattention of his people. If a poem was to be written on the great theme\r\nof the revival of Rome and Italy, Augustus himself could not of course\r\nbe the hero of it, nor even Julius: political and artistic feeling alike\r\nforbade. But a hero it must have, and he must be placed, not in the\r\nburning light of the politics of the day, but in the dim distance of the\r\npast. Such a hero was found in the mythical ancestor of the Julian\r\nfamily, Æneas, son of Venus and Anchises. A legend, familiar to educated\r\nRomans, told how this Trojan hero, whose personality appears in Homer,\r\nwandered over the seas after the fall of Troy, and landed at last in\r\nItaly; how he subdued the wild tribes then dwelling in Latium, brought\r\npeace and order and civilisation, and was under the hand of destiny the\r\nfounder of the great career of Rome. His son Iulus, whose name the Julii\r\nbelieved themselves to bear, was in the legend the founder of the city\r\nfrom which Rome herself was founded; and thus the family of the Cæsars,\r\nthe rescue of Italy from barbarism, and the foundation of the Eternal\r\nCity, might all be brought into connexion with the story of Æneas the\r\nTrojan. Here, then, was the hero, the type of which the antitype was to\r\nbe found in Augustus.\r\n\r\nAnd this is how the _Æneid_ became a great national and a great imperial\r\npoem. It created a national hero, and endowed him with the best\r\ncharacteristics of his race, and especially with that sense of duty\r\nwhich the Romans called _pietas_: this is why it became a great national\r\npoem. It connected him with the famous stories of Greece and of Troy,\r\nand made him prophetically the ancestor of the man who was rescuing the\r\nEmpire from ruin: this is why it became a great imperial poem. The idea\r\nwas a noble one, and Virgil rose to his subject. Though the _Æneid_ has\r\ndrawbacks which for a modern reader detract from the general effect, yet\r\nwhenever the poet comes upon his great theme the tone is that of a full\r\norgan. Even in a translation, though he cannot feel the witchery of\r\nVirgil’s magic touch, the reader may recognise and welcome the\r\nrecurrence of that great theme, and so learn how its treatment made the\r\npoem the world’s second great epic. It instantly took a firm hold on the\r\nRoman mind; it came to be looked on almost as a sacred book, loved and\r\nhonoured as much by Christian Fathers as by pagan scholars. Italy has\r\ngiven the world two of the greatest poems ever written: the _Æneid_ of\r\nVirgil, and the _Divina Commedia_ of Dante, in which the younger poet\r\ntook the imaginary figure of his predecessor as his guide and teacher in\r\nhis travel through the scenes of the nether world.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we must now leave poetry for fact and action, and try to gain some\r\nidea of that work of Augustus which laid the solid foundation of a new\r\nimperial system; a system of which we moderns not only see the relics\r\nstill around us, but feel unconsciously the influence in many ways.\r\nAugustus had found time to discover, since the death of Julius, that the\r\nwork to be done would fall mainly into two great departments: (1) Rome\r\nand Italy must be loyal, contented, and at peace; (2) the rest of the\r\nEmpire must be governed justly and efficiently. To this we must add that\r\nthe whole must contribute, each part in due proportion, to its own\r\ndefence and government, both by paying taxes and by military service.\r\n\r\n1. The city of Rome, with a population of perhaps half a million, of all\r\nraces and degrees, had been a constant anxiety to Augustus so far, and\r\nhad exercised far more power in the Empire than such a mixed and idle\r\npopulation was entitled to. He saw that this population must be well\r\npoliced, and induced to keep itself in order as far as possible; that it\r\nmust be made quite comfortable, run no risk of starvation, have\r\nconfidence in the good-will of its gods, and enjoy plenty of amusement.\r\nAbove all, it must believe in himself, in order to be loyal to his\r\npolicy. When he returned to Rome after crushing Antony and Cleopatra,\r\nthe Romans were already disposed to believe in him, and he did all he\r\ncould to make them permanently and freely loyal. He divided the city\r\ninto new sections for police purposes, and recruited corps of “watchmen”\r\nfrom the free population; he restored temples and priesthoods, erected\r\nmany pleasant and convenient public buildings (thus incidentally giving\r\nplenty of employment), organised the supply of corn and of water, and\r\nencouraged public amusements by his own presence at them. He took care\r\nthat no one should starve, or become so uncomfortable as to murmur or\r\nrebel.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, he did not mean this motley population to\r\ncontinue to have undue influence on the affairs of the Empire. True, he\r\ngave them back their Free State (_respublica_), and you might see\r\nmagistrates, Senate, and assemblies in the city, just as under the\r\nRepublic. But the people of the city had henceforth little political\r\npower. The consuls and Senate were indeed far from idle, but the\r\nassemblies for election and legislation soon ceased to be realities. In\r\nelections no money was now to be gained by a vote, and in legislation\r\nthe “people” were quite content with sanctioning the wisdom of Augustus\r\nand his advisers. At the beginning of the next reign it was possible to\r\nput nearly the whole of this business into the hands of the Senate, and\r\nthe Roman people made no objection. Seeing that they were only a\r\nfraction of the free population of the Empire, it was as well that this\r\nshould be so; the rest of the citizen body could not use their votes at\r\na distance from Rome, and the Senate and the _princeps_[13] (as Augustus\r\nand his immediate successors were called) represented the interests of\r\nthe Empire far better than the crowd of voters.\r\n\r\nOf the work of Augustus in Italy we unluckily know very little, but what\r\nwe do know shows that he worked on much the same principles as in the\r\ncity. Italy was made safe and comfortable, and was now free from all\r\nwarlike disturbance for a long period. Brigandage was suppressed: roads\r\nwere repaired: agriculture and country life were encouraged in all\r\npossible ways. A book on agriculture written even in Augustus’s earlier\r\nyears boasts of the prosperity of rural Italy, and Virgil’s poem on\r\nhusbandry is full of the love and praise of Italian life and scenery.\r\nHere is a specimen—\r\n\r\n  “But no, not Medeland with its wealth of woods,\r\n  Fair Ganges, Hermus thick with golden silt,\r\n  Can match the praise of Italy....\r\n  Here blooms perpetual spring, and summer here\r\n  In months that are not summer’s; twice teem the flocks:\r\n  Twice does the tree yield service of her fruit.\r\n  . . . . . . .\r\n  Mark too her cities, so many and so proud,\r\n  Of mighty toil the achievement, town on town\r\n  Up rugged precipices heaved and reared,\r\n  And rivers gliding under ancient walls.”[14]\r\n\r\n2. The peaceful state of Rome and Italy made it possible for Augustus to\r\nundertake, in person to a great extent, the more important work of\r\norganising the rest of the Empire. He found it in a state of chaos\r\nalmost as great as that of the Turkish Empire in our own time. He left\r\nit a strongly compacted union of provinces and dependent kingdoms\r\ngrouped around the Mediterranean, which for a long time to come served\r\ntwo valuable purposes. First, it protected Mediterranean civilisation\r\nagainst barbarian attack, the most valuable thing done for us (as I said\r\nin my first chapter) by Roman organisation. Secondly, it gave free\r\nopportunity for the growth of that enlightened system of law which has\r\nbeen the other chief gift of Rome to modern civilisation. And also,\r\nthough without any purpose on the part of the government—nay, in spite\r\nof its strenuous opposition—it made possible the rapid growth of\r\nChristianity, during the next half-century, which seized on the great\r\ntowns and the main lines of communication to spread itself among the\r\nmasses of the people.\r\n\r\nAugustus was able to do all this work beyond Italy quite legally, and as\r\na servant of the State. He had succeeded in identifying himself, his\r\nfamily, and all his interests, with the State and its interests, in a\r\nway of which Sulla had never dreamt, and which had not been possible for\r\nJulius Cæsar. When he restored the Free State he divided the work of\r\ngovernment with the Senate and the magistrates, and in this division he\r\ntook care that the whole range of what we should call imperial and\r\nforeign affairs should fall to himself, with the sole command of the\r\narmy. Thus he became supreme ruler of all provinces on or near the\r\nfrontiers, appointed their governors, and kept them responsible to\r\nhimself. If there was war on a frontier, it was carried through by his\r\nlieutenants, under his _imperium_ and his auspices. For a governor to\r\nwage war on his own account was no longer possible, for it was made high\r\ntreason under a new and stringent law. The safety of the Empire, and\r\nespecially of the frontier provinces, depended on the army, and the army\r\nwas now identified once more in interest through Augustus with the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nBut of course a system like this would not work of itself; it needed\r\nconstant looking after. Augustus knew this well, and knew also that he\r\ncould not by himself either set it going or continue to look after it.\r\nIt was part of his good fortune that he found a really capable and loyal\r\nhelper in Agrippa, a tried soldier and organiser, who till his death in\r\n12 B.C., during the most prosperous years of Augustus’s power, was able\r\nto identify his own interests with those of his friend and the State.\r\nThe two worked admirably together, and between them found time to travel\r\nover the whole Empire, working hard at settlements of all kinds, and\r\nconducting military operations where they were absolutely necessary. It\r\nwas the same kind of work, but on a far larger scale, as that of\r\nPompeius after his conquests in the East: founding new cities, and\r\nsettling the status of old ones: making treaties with kings and\r\nchieftains: arranging the details of finance, land-tenure, and so on.\r\nLet us notice two important points in all this work of organisation,\r\nwhich will help to show how greatly in earnest Augustus was in his task\r\nof welding the Empire into real unity, and ruling it on rational\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nFirst, he instituted for the first time (though Julius is said to have\r\ncontemplated it) a complete survey, or _census_ as the Romans called it,\r\nof all the material resources of the Empire, in order to ascertain what\r\ntaxes all its free inhabitants ought to pay for purposes of government.\r\nUnder the Republic there had never been such a survey, and the result\r\nwas that abundant opportunity had been found for unfair taxation, and\r\nfor extortion by corrupt officials. Now every house, field, and wood was\r\nduly valued by responsible officials, so that unjust exactions could be\r\neasily detected. By accurate keeping of accounts the government was able\r\nto tell what sums it ought to receive, and how much it had to spend; and\r\nwe know that Augustus’s foreign policy was greatly influenced by such\r\nfinancial considerations. He kept a kind of yearly balance-sheet\r\nhimself, and his successor found the affairs of the Empire in perfect\r\norder.\r\n\r\nSecondly, each province was now for the first time given a kind of\r\ncorporate existence, and became something more than the military command\r\nof a Roman magistrate. A council of the province met once a year at its\r\nchief town, and transacted a certain amount of business. True, this did\r\nnot give the province any measure of real self-government, but it had\r\nsome useful results, and it is not impossible that Augustus may have\r\nintended that more should eventually follow. This meeting of a\r\nprovincial council brought each province into direct touch with the home\r\ngovernment, and in particular enabled it to make complaint of its\r\ngovernor if he had been unpopular and oppressive. And one most\r\ninteresting feature of these councils was that they had a worship of\r\ntheir own, meant, no doubt, to dim the lustre of local and tribal\r\nworships, and to keep the idea of Rome and her rulers constantly before\r\nthe minds of the provincials. For the divine objects of worship were\r\nAugustus himself or his Genius, in combination with the new goddess\r\nRoma. The most famous example of this worship is found at Lugdunum, now\r\nLyons, where there was an altar dedicated to Rome and Augustus, at the\r\njunction of Rhone and Saone, which served as a religious centre for the\r\nthree provinces into which Augustus now divided the great area of the\r\nGallic conquests of Julius.\r\n\r\nThough his object was undoubtedly peace, Augustus could not, of course,\r\nentirely escape war on his frontiers. He could not have finally settled\r\nthe frontier on the line of the Danube, which was far the most valuable\r\nmilitary work of his time, without wars which were both long and\r\ndangerous. It was absolutely necessary to cover Italy on the northeast,\r\nwhere the passes over the Alps are low and comparatively easy, and also\r\nto shield the Greek peninsula from attack by the wild tribes to the\r\nnorth of it. I have already alluded to the great work of Tiberius (the\r\nstepson of Augustus) in this quarter, which marks him as the third of\r\nthe great generals who saved the civilisation of the Mediterranean for\r\nus. At one time Augustus thought of advancing the frontier from the\r\nRhine to the Elbe, and so of connecting Elbe and Danube in one\r\ncontinuous line of defence. But this plan made it necessary to enclose\r\nall Germany west of the Elbe in the Roman Empire, and it was soon found\r\nthat the Germans were not to be made into Roman provincials without a\r\nprolonged struggle for which Augustus had neither money nor inclination.\r\nSo the frontier came back to the Rhine, and the Rhine and the sea marked\r\nthe Roman frontier on north and west, until Claudius, the third\r\nsuccessor of Augustus, added our island, or rather the southern part of\r\nit, to the Empire, in A.D. 43.\r\n\r\nIn the East Augustus contrived to do without war, trusting, and rightly\r\ntrusting, to the enormous prestige he had won by overcoming Antony and\r\nCleopatra, and annexing the ancient kingdom of Egypt. His fame spread to\r\nIndia, and probably even to China, with the caravans of merchants who\r\nthen as now passed along fixed routes from Syria and Egypt to the Far\r\nEast. We Britons know what _prestige_ can do among Orientals; it is a\r\nword that has often been in disfavour, but it means that there are ways\r\nof avoiding war without withdrawing just claims to influence. Augustus\r\ncontrived on the strength of his prestige to keep an honourable peace\r\nwith the Parthians and Armenians who bordered on the Empire along the\r\nline of the Euphrates, and his successors would have kept it too had\r\nthey always followed out his policy. Tiberius, his faithful pupil and\r\nsuccessor, did follow out that policy, and showed consummate skill in\r\nhandling it.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Tiberius, who succeeded to the position of Augustus at\r\nthe end of his long life, suggests a few words about a weak point in the\r\nnew system, which was to give some trouble in the future. How was the\r\nsuccession to be effected? Augustus had not made a new constitution; he\r\nhad only engrafted his own position of authority on the old republican\r\nconstitution. So at least he wished his position to be understood, and\r\nso he was careful to describe it in the record of his deeds which he\r\nleft behind him, engraved on the walls of the great tomb which he built\r\nfor himself and his family. In dignity and consequence he wished to be\r\nconsidered the first citizen; and this he expressed by the word\r\n_Princeps_, _i.e._ the first man in the State: by the name Augustus,\r\nwhich suggested to a Roman ear something in the nature of religious\r\nsanctity: by the honorary title _pater patriæ_ (father of his country),\r\nand in other ways. The real power in his hands had its basis and\r\nguarantee in the army, of which his _imperium_ made him (as we should\r\nsay) commander-in-chief; but the army was on the frontiers doing duty\r\nfor the Empire, all but invisible to the Roman and Italian. Thus his\r\n_imperium_, though it might be legally used in Italy, was primarily a\r\nmilitary power indispensable for the guardian of the frontiers. To the\r\nItalians it might well seem that the Free State was still maintained,\r\nand that no new permanent power had been established; though Greeks and\r\nforeigners might be, and indeed were, more discerning as to what had\r\nreally happened.\r\n\r\nBut when Augustus died, in A.D. 14, how was a succession to be effected?\r\nOr was there to be a succession at all—would it not be better to let the\r\nState pass back again into the hands of the Senate and people? This last\r\nwas the only logical way, and it was the plan actually adopted in form.\r\nA position like that of Augustus could not pass to a successor, unless\r\nthe State in its old constitutional form chose to appoint such a\r\nsuccessor with the same authority as that of Augustus. To this, however,\r\nwe must add (and it well shows the real change that had been effected by\r\nthe long revolution) that no choice of Senate and people could hold good\r\nunless the consent of the army could be had.\r\n\r\nOf course, Augustus had considered all this, and had made his own plans.\r\nHe would choose a member of his own family, one, that is, who inherited\r\nthe name and fame of Cæsar by blood or adoption, would adopt him as a\r\nson (for he had no son of his own), make him his heir, associate him as\r\nfar as possible in his own dignity and authority, and thus mark him out\r\nas the natural heir to the principate. This would make it difficult for\r\nSenate or army to refuse him; beyond that Augustus knew that he could\r\nnot go. He was unlucky in losing one after another the youths whom he\r\nthus destined to succeed him, and eventually had to fall back on his\r\nstepson Tiberius: a great soldier, as we have seen, and a man of\r\nintegrity and ability, but of reserved and even morose temper, and one\r\nwith whom the shrewd and genial Augustus had little in common.\r\n\r\nWhen Augustus died there was an anxious moment. There was no reason why\r\nthe principate should be confined to the family of the Cæsars, nor any\r\nreason but expediency for having a _princeps_ at all. But, after all,\r\nthe will of the dead ruler prevailed, and Tiberius slipped into his\r\nplace without opposition; the Senate accepted him as plainly marked out\r\nby Augustus, and the army raised no difficulty, though his nephew\r\nGermanicus Cæsar was young, popular, and in actual command of the army\r\non the Rhine. Some mocking voices were heard, and throughout his\r\nprincipate of twenty-three years Tiberius had to endure continual\r\nannoyance from the old republican families, but there was no real\r\nattempt to quarrel with the principate as an institution of the Roman\r\nState.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on this point at some length in order to show what a\r\nsingular creation this principate of Augustus was. To proclaim monarchy\r\noutright would probably have been fatal; to take the whole work on\r\nhimself would be to leave the old governing families idle and\r\ndiscontented; on the other hand, to do the necessary work as a yearly\r\nelected magistrate, according to the old practice, was plainly\r\nimpossible. Election by the people of the Roman city would have little\r\nforce in the eyes of the Empire, and it was this Empire as a whole that\r\nAugustus wished to represent. The course he took shows him a shrewd,\r\nobservant, tactical diplomatist, if ever there was one. He is not a man\r\non whose character we dwell with sympathy or enthusiasm; he does not\r\nkindle our admiration like C. Gracchus or Cæsar; but he was essentially\r\nthe man for the hour.\r\n\r\nTo him we owe in large measure the glories of “the Augustan age,” with\r\nits poets, historians, and artists; it was the “Augustan peace,” and the\r\nencouragement and patronage of Augustus, that enable Horace to write his\r\nperfect lyrics and his good-natured comments on human life, Ovid to pour\r\nforth his abundant stream of beautiful versification, Tibullus and\r\nPropertius to sing of the Italian country and its deities and festivals,\r\nand Livy, the greatest of Roman historians, to do in noble prose what\r\nVirgil had done in noble verse—to inspire Romans and Italians with\r\nenthusiasm for the great deeds of their ancestors. But the world owes\r\nAugustus a still greater debt than this; for he laid securely the\r\nfoundations of an imperial system strong enough to save for us, through\r\ncenturies of danger, the priceless treasures of Græco-Roman\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                        LIFE IN THE ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have seen the Empire made comparatively secure by Augustus,\r\nand set in the way of development on what seem to be rational\r\nprinciples, let us pause and try to gain some idea of the social life\r\ngoing on within it: excluding that of the city of Rome, which is no\r\nlonger of the old paramount importance. How did the inhabitants of the\r\nEmpire live and occupy themselves during the first two centuries of our\r\nera?\r\n\r\nThe first point to make quite sure of is that this life was in the main\r\na life in towns. Roman policy had always favoured the maintenance of\r\nexisting towns, except in the very rare cases where they were deemed too\r\ndangerous. Carthage and Corinth had been destroyed by Rome on this\r\npretext, but they had been founded afresh by Julius Cæsar, and were now\r\nbeginning a long and vigorous city life. In the East, where city-states\r\nabounded, Rome retained and adorned them, or built new ones, as Pompey\r\ndid after crushing Mithradates and Tigranes. In the West, in Gaul and\r\nSpain, where they did not exist at all, she founded some, and by a\r\nwonderfully wise policy favoured the natural growth of others. The\r\npeople of these western provinces lived chiefly in some kind of\r\nvillages, scattered over a district which we may call a canton, often,\r\nperhaps, as big as an English county of to-day. The Roman policy was\r\neither to found a city to serve as the centre of the canton, and to\r\nendow it with magistrates and senate on the Roman model: or to give the\r\ncanton its senate and magistrates, and leave it to develop its own\r\ntown-centre.\r\n\r\nThis policy shows extremely well the genius of Rome for civilising, or\r\nRomanising, without destroying the grouping and the habits of the people\r\nto be civilised, or Romanised. The old tribal (or cantonal) system\r\nremained, and its officers were the chiefs of the old population; but\r\nthey now bore Roman names, _duoviri_, _quæstores_, and so on, and sat in\r\nan assembly called _ordo_—i.e. senate. If a town were not founded at\r\nonce, in which the business of the canton could be carried on, it was\r\ncertain to grow of itself. A purely rural region, where the people live\r\nin villages only, was contrary to Roman interests and traditions; it was\r\ninconvenient for raising taxes, and it did not give those opportunities\r\nof culture and amusement which the Roman looked for when he travelled or\r\nsettled in a province. The provincials, too, were in this way made more\r\nhappy and contented; town life greatly helped in civilising them,\r\nattracting the better or richer people from the villages.\r\n\r\nTo help us in realising this urban character of Roman provincial life,\r\nwe may compare it with that of our fellow-subjects in India at the\r\npresent day. India is in the main a rural country, and by far the great\r\nmajority of its inhabitants live on the land and support themselves by\r\nagriculture. Only about 30,000,000 live in towns, as against 235,000,000\r\nin the rural districts, and the few great cities are rather industrial\r\nand commercial centres than homes of culture and amusement. The economic\r\nunit of India is the village, and this simple fact is enough to explain\r\nwhy India never has been Anglicised. Instinctively the Romans perceived\r\nthat if a province were to be Romanised, the process could not be set\r\ngoing in villages; and where there were only villages, they gave the\r\ndistricts the opportunity of developing towns in their midst. The\r\nopportunity, we may reasonably suppose, was rarely missed, for at all\r\ntimes in their history the Romans had a wonderful power of making their\r\nsubjects eager to imitate their own institutions. Thus Spain, Gaul, and\r\neven Britain, became rich in towns after the Roman model—towns which\r\nserved to humanise the people, while making them obedient subjects.\r\n\r\nLet us now see, with the help of a few striking examples, how, by the\r\nsecond century of our era, the Empire was covered with towns. For Italy\r\nand Greece we do not need illustrations—we are already well aware of the\r\nfact. But even far away in the East, in regions where the Greeks had\r\nnever settled, if the Romans came to stay they left cities behind them.\r\nLook, for example, at a map of Syria or Palestine, and note the great\r\ncaravan route leading from Damascus southwards on the east side of the\r\nJordan, a road important to Rome because it carried the merchandise of\r\nthe Far East to Damascus and the Mediterranean by way of the Persian\r\nGulf and Petra. Before the traveller of to-day has gone far south from\r\nDamascus he will come on the splendid ruins of two successive cities\r\nbuilt by the Romans in this period, Gerasa and Philadelphia, where the\r\nsheep now graze among the ruins of temples, theatres, and baths. A\r\nfamous English traveller[15] wrote of them long ago that they enabled\r\nhim to form some conception of the grandeur and might of the Roman\r\nEmpire: “That cities so far removed from the capital, and built almost\r\nin the desert, should have been adorned with so many splendid monuments,\r\nafforded one of the most striking proofs of the marvellous energy and\r\nsplendid enterprise of that great people who had subjected the world.”\r\n\r\nThe mention of Damascus may remind us of a traveller of the first\r\ncentury A.D. whose journeys are fortunately recorded and admirably\r\nillustrate the fact that in Asia Minor and Greece the life of the people\r\nwas centred in the great cities. St. Paul went from city to city,\r\nchoosing by preference for his missionary work the most populous ones,\r\nsuch as Antioch, Ephesus, Thessalonica, Corinth and Athens.\r\n\r\nPassing westwards, and leaving out of account the many cities of Egypt,\r\nwe shall find that what has been so far said holds good of the Roman\r\nprovince of Africa. This province eventually became one of the most\r\nhighly cultured as well as populous, mainly owing to its numerous towns.\r\nOf many of these the remains still astonish the traveller. A photograph\r\nlies before me of one of them which still stands almost in the desert,\r\nsilent and abandoned, with temples, streets, and all the belongings of a\r\ngreat city as perfect as at the excavated Pompeii, which was overwhelmed\r\nin this period by the great eruption of Vesuvius. An inscription tells\r\nus that Thamugadi was founded in the year A.D. 100, and built with the\r\nhelp of a legion of Roman soldiers to guard civilisation against the\r\nmarauders of the desert. Another of these towns is a good example of the\r\nway in which the army contributed to the policy of creating\r\ntown-centres; Lambæsis, now called Djebel-Aures, was the permanent\r\nstation of a military force, round which there grew up a civil\r\npopulation of traders and camp-followers. Great roads, here as\r\neverywhere in the Empire, connected these towns with each other and with\r\nthe capital of the province, in this case Carthage.\r\n\r\nIf we cross the sea from Africa to Gaul or Spain we shall find the same\r\nprocess going on. Spain we must pass by; but in Gaul we land at the\r\nancient Greek city of Massilia, which, as Marseilles, is still the great\r\nport of southern France. A little to the north, Nismes (Nemausus) was\r\nformed into a city by Augustus out of a rural population; its vast Roman\r\namphitheatre and an exquisitely beautiful temple belong to the second\r\ncentury, and still stand in the middle of the modern city. Lyons was\r\nalso founded by Augustus, as we saw in the last chapter, with a special\r\npurpose. Farther north the cities on the great roads were gradually\r\nformed, out of tribal populations living in villages, and many of them\r\nstill bear the names of those tribes: Paris is the town-centre of the\r\nParisii, Rheims of the Remisii, Soissons of the Suessiones, Trier of the\r\nTreveri. This last city, on the Moselle, now a German one, can boast of\r\nmore imposing Roman work than any north of Italy, and is within\r\ncomparatively easy reach of visitors from our shores.\r\n\r\nBritain, which was invaded and made a province in the reign of Claudius,\r\nwas never so fully Romanised as other provinces, partly owing to the\r\nwild and stubborn nature of its inhabitants; but even in our midst the\r\nRoman has left obvious traces of his belief in town life. London was a\r\ntrading centre before the coming of the Romans, and they maintained it\r\nas such; but nearly all their other towns had a more directly military\r\norigin and object. The oldest of them is Colchester, a military colony,\r\nwhich still has its Roman walls. Then came St. Albans (Verulamium),\r\nGloucester, Chester, Lincoln and York, strategical points of importance,\r\nwhere populous cities still stand. In a few cases towns have\r\ndisappeared, and have only been recovered by excavation, _e.g._ Calleva\r\n(Silchester, near Basingstoke), the town-centre of the Atrebates; but\r\nmany of our country towns, besides those just mentioned, still stand on\r\nancient Roman sites, and even without much excavation have yielded\r\ntraces of their Roman inhabitants. One, and one only, Dorchester, still\r\nboasts of a complete little amphitheatre, which stands just outside the\r\ntown between the Great Western and South Western railways, and has been\r\nused by Mr. Thomas Hardy for a scene in one of his novels. All our towns\r\nand villages of which the names contain the word _chester_ or _cester_\r\nare Roman in origin, though they may not have been large cities like\r\nGloucester (Glevum); for _chester_ is only our English form of _castra_,\r\nthe Latin for a military encampment.\r\n\r\nIf it is now quite clear that the town is the unit of civilisation in\r\nthe Empire, what was the social and political life of the town? Of this\r\nwe know now much more than we used to do, for it is mirrored in the many\r\nthousands of inscriptions from every Roman province, which have now at\r\nlast been collected and correctly published under the direction of the\r\nfamous Theodor Mommsen, whose name cannot be omitted entirely, even in\r\nsuch an unpretending book about Rome as this. In records on stone there\r\nis, indeed, something lacking that can only be supplied by literature,\r\nwhich reports more elaborately and earnestly the thoughts and feelings\r\nof men; and in the Empire, apart from Italy and Rome, there is but\r\nlittle literature to help us out. But the inscriptions supply us with\r\nthe necessary facts.\r\n\r\nFirst, of the political condition of these innumerable towns we may say\r\nthat it shows diversity in unity. There were several grades of privilege\r\namong them. Some were nominally independent of the Roman government, and\r\nin alliance with it, but these were few; Athens is the most famous\r\nexample. Others were communities of Roman citizens; and many had the\r\nLatin right, _i.e._ inferior privilege. Lastly, there were great numbers\r\nof cities—a majority of the whole number—whose inhabitants were not\r\nRoman citizens at all, but directly under the control of the governor of\r\ntheir province, who was limited in his authority over the more\r\nprivileged and independent towns. So much for diversity.\r\n\r\nBut all the cities were in reality governed and organised in much the\r\nsame way. In each there was a constitution closely resembling that of\r\nRome, and in most instances modelled directly upon it. As at Rome, they\r\nhad yearly elected magistrates, who, after holding office, passed into a\r\nsenate of advisers and councillors; and these magistrates were elected\r\nby the _populus_, or the whole body of citizens. Here was plenty of\r\nuseful work to do, as we can guess from our own experience of local\r\nself-government. Plutarch, writing in this period of his own little town\r\nof Chæronea in Greece, realises this to the full, and urges that the\r\nwork of the magistrate is honourable work, and the more so as it is\r\ncombined with the sense of citizenship in a great empire.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a tendency in these provincial towns, as in the city\r\nof Rome itself, for the magistrate, who must be a man of substance, to\r\nundertake the expense of amusing the people; a tendency to make the\r\npeople dependent on the rich for their comforts rather than on their own\r\nindustry and exertion. The magistrate, besides paying a large fee on his\r\naccession to office, was expected to give public games, to feast the\r\npeople, or to give them a present of money all round. And he would wish,\r\ntoo, to distinguish his magistracy by erecting some public buildings—a\r\nbath, aqueduct, or theatre; or to endow a school. So it came to pass in\r\ncourse of time that his burdens were heavier than he could bear, and\r\nthat the whole class to which he belonged, the senatorial one, was\r\ninvolved in the same difficulties. This class could not be recruited\r\nfrom the common people, who rarely had the means, or, indeed, the\r\nenergy, to rise to affluence; and the tendency as time went on was to\r\ndraw the line ever more sharply between the dignity of the various\r\nclasses. But the ruin of the senatorial class, or _curiales_, lies\r\noutside our limits.\r\n\r\nThe lower class was engaged in industry, either on the land, or in the\r\ntown itself. This industry was not to any large extent employed by\r\ncapital, nor was it in competition with slave-labour, of which in\r\nprovincial towns we do not hear much. The members of the various trades\r\nand callings worked on their own account, but were almost invariably\r\ngrouped together in gilds or associations, and these are one of the most\r\ninteresting features in the life of this period. Each of these gilds was\r\nlicensed, or should have been licensed, by the central government at\r\nRome—a good example of the way in which the long arm of that government\r\nreached to every provincial town through the agency of the provincial\r\ngovernor and his officials. Illegal association was a serious crime, and\r\nthis was one of the reasons why the small Christian communities were\r\nlooked on with suspicion by the government.\r\n\r\nWhat was the object of these associations? The question has often been\r\nasked whether they were in any sense provident societies like our\r\nfriendly societies, and, on the whole, the conclusion of investigators\r\nhas been that they were not. If we had more literature dealing with\r\nprovincial life, or such a correspondence as that of Cicero and his\r\nfriends, we could give a more certain answer.\r\n\r\nBut in one sense at least they may be called provident societies. All,\r\nor nearly all, of them had as one main object the assurance of a proper\r\ntomb and decent funeral for the members. This object can only be fully\r\nappreciated after some real study of the social life and religion of\r\nthat and the preceding age, but when it is understood it is\r\ninexpressibly touching. It would seem that the life of the working man\r\nof that day was by no means an unhappy one, that he was not driven or\r\nenslaved by an employer nor forced to live in grimy and unwholesome\r\nsurroundings. So far as we can tell he had little anxiety in this life,\r\nand worshipped his gods, and performed his vows to them, with genuine\r\ngratitude. But that he should be utterly neglected and forgotten after\r\ndeath, thrown into some common grave to moulder away unnoticed, “where\r\nno hand would bring the annual offering of wine and flowers”—this seems\r\nto have been the shadow ever hanging over his life. We may doubt whether\r\nthe hope of immortality had, as a rule, anything to do with this\r\nanxiety. It was rather an inherited instinct than a faith or creed that\r\nmoved these poor people. Originally it had been the desire not to have\r\nto wander as a ghost for want of due burial; now it is rather the fear\r\nthat they might be forgotten by those left behind, or, indeed, by future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of association is common to man, and in a vast empire,\r\nwhere the tendency was, and long had been, to obliterate the old social\r\ngrouping of kinship, real or supposed, it would be some consolation to\r\nbelong to a club of friends with common interests, accustomed to share\r\nthe joys and perils of life, and bent on decent burial when death should\r\novertake them. Even in this life they would meet from time to time to\r\neat, drink and enjoy themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we may conclude that this life of the towns was a happy\r\none, so long as the frontiers were well guarded and no sudden raid or\r\ninvasion by an enemy was likely; so long, too, as person and property\r\nwere securely protected under Roman law administered without corruption,\r\nand amusements and conveniences were to be had for little or nothing.\r\nBut undoubtedly something was wanting; there was mischief in the social\r\nsystem somewhere, though it was not easy to lay finger upon it. The sap\r\nwas running in the plant too feebly; there was a lack of keen industrial\r\nenergy and of the instinct of self-help. As time went on, the central\r\ngovernment grew too paternal, interfered too much in the life of these\r\ntowns, and so encouraged the tendency to “slackness.” And more and more,\r\nas pressure came on the Empire from without, the play of life in these\r\nonce happy cities became an automatic movement of machinery, the central\r\nwheel of which was the Cæsar at Rome.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the life of the provincial towns must be mentioned\r\nhere, which suggests that the trend of the time was not entirely\r\nhealthy. I said at the beginning of this book that the great monuments\r\nleft behind her by Rome were mainly of a useful and practical kind,\r\n_e.g._ roads, aqueducts, places of business. This is true, but it is now\r\nnecessary to add that some of the most imposing of these fabrics were,\r\nin the period we have now reached, entirely devoted to amusement, and\r\namusement of a kind neither educating nor humane. The taste had long\r\nbeen growing at Rome for spectacles of bloodshed—combats of gladiators,\r\nand the hunting of wild beasts in a confined space; and from Rome this\r\ndegraded taste passed only too rapidly into the provinces. Most large\r\nprovincial towns had their amphitheatre, in imitation of the huge one at\r\nRome, which we know as the Coliseum; and the more fully Romanised a\r\nprovince was, the more of these homes of inhumanity were to be found in\r\nit. The most magnificent one still standing outside Italy, that at\r\nNismes, dates, strange to say, from the mild and enlightened age of the\r\nAntonines, to which we are coming in the next chapter. The Greeks,\r\nindeed, never took much interest in such shows; but in the western\r\nprovinces, where the best and most virile populations of the Empire were\r\nnow to be found, their effect was beyond doubt pernicious, for they\r\nencouraged not only inhumanity, but idleness. Day after day the greater\r\npart of the population of a city might sit and watch lazily these bloody\r\nentertainments, on which, perhaps, some wealthy citizen was wasting his\r\ncapital to his own ruin.\r\n\r\nAs may, perhaps, be said of ourselves in this present age, the Romans of\r\nthe Empire were being encouraged to live too much in the enjoyment of\r\nthe present, without anxiety for the future. So, too, the cultured\r\nclasses gradually came to look back at the past, to the great\r\nachievements of Rome in war and literature, as all in all to them, and\r\nlost the desire to strike out new lines, to make new discoveries, to try\r\nnew experiments. “Over all, to our eyes, there broods the shadow which\r\nhaunts the life that is nourished only by memories, and to which the\r\nfuture sends no call and offers no promise.”[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n               THE EMPIRE UNDER THE ANTONINES—CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief work of Rome in the world, as has often been said in this\r\nlittle book, was the defence of Mediterranean civilisation against\r\nexternal enemies. That work was of a double nature. It could not be done\r\nsimply by marking out and holding lines of frontier; it was also\r\nnecessary so to organise the Empire within its frontiers that the whole\r\nshould contribute to the common object, with men, money and public\r\nspirit. The last two chapters will have shown that from the time of\r\nJulius and Augustus Roman rulers fully recognised this twofold nature of\r\ntheir task. Augustus in particular, while gradually settling the\r\nfrontiers on a system well thought out, and adapted to his means and\r\nexperience, also spent much time and pains on internal organisation. He\r\nfound the Empire a loose collection of subject territories, each\r\ngoverned, well or ill as it might happen, by an officer almost\r\nindependent of the central authority; he left it, at the end of his long\r\nlife, in the way of becoming a well-compacted whole, in which every part\r\nfelt more or less the force of a just central government; a civilised\r\nState “standing out in clear relief against the surrounding barbarism.”\r\n\r\nIn such an empire there must, of course, be differences of race and\r\nlanguage—differences, too, of habits, feelings, modes of thought; but\r\nunder just and wise rule such differences need be no hindrance to the\r\npolitical unity of the whole. There is a book of this period, within the\r\nreach of every one, which illustrates better than any other this unity\r\nin diversity of the Roman Empire—I mean the Acts of the Apostles. It\r\nshould be studied carefully, with maps and such other helps as may be\r\navailable, down to the last chapter, where it leaves St. Paul at Rome,\r\nliving in his own hired house, in the centre of Mediterranean life and\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nUnder the immediate successors of Augustus, Tiberius, Claudius and Nero,\r\nhis policy was, on the whole, maintained with good faith and discretion;\r\nand at the close of the first century A.D. Vespasian and his two sons,\r\nTitus and Domitian, did little more than improve the working of the\r\nmachinery of his government. More and more, it is true, the constitution\r\nbecame a real monarchy; the part played in it by the Senate of the free\r\nState was getting steadily narrowed; but this was all in the interest of\r\nefficiency, and, so far as we can see, it was necessary to the internal\r\ndevelopment of the Empire. The Cæsars of the first century must have the\r\ncredit of ruling wisely, with the help of their advisers, on the\r\nAugustan principles. True, the great literary genius of the age, the\r\nhistorian Tacitus, by drawing brilliant and lurid portraits of some of\r\nthem, has diverted our attention from their work as agents of a great\r\nsystem; but to tell their story as Tacitus has told it is neither\r\npossible nor necessary here. I may pass them over and go on to the\r\nsecond century and the age of the Antonines, which has rightly been\r\njudged by historians to be the most brilliant and the happiest in all\r\nRoman history.\r\n\r\nThat four men of what seems to us “right judgment in all things” should\r\nsucceed each other in power at this critical time, is one more example\r\nof the wonderful good fortune of Rome. All were men of capacity and\r\neducation, hard workers and conscientious, and they seem to have\r\ncommunicated their good qualities to their subordinates, for they never\r\nwanted for loyal helpers. The Senate, indeed, was now of little avail\r\nfor actual work, and the greater part of the business had long been done\r\nby Cæsar[17] and his own “servants,” freedmen for the most part, often\r\nambitious and unscrupulous Greeks; but in this period, as we shall see\r\ndirectly, the civil service, as we may call it, was placed on a sound\r\nand honourable basis. It would seem as if the ideas of duty and\r\ndiscipline were once more to prevail throughout the Roman official\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe first of the four rulers, Ulpius Trajanus, known to us all as\r\nTrajan, was not of Roman or even Italian birth, but came from the\r\nprovince of further Spain: a fact which marks the growth of the idea\r\nthat every part of the Empire may now be turned to account for the\r\ncommon good. Trajan was a soldier by breeding and disposition, and his\r\ncontribution to the work of this period was mainly a military one. The\r\nfrontier along the Danube, the last (as we have seen) to be settled, had\r\nalways been the weakest; and yet here henceforward was to be the most\r\ndangerous point in the Empire’s line of defence. Along the whole length\r\nof the lower Danube a great mass of barbarian tribes was already\r\npressing, pressed themselves from behind by others to north and east.\r\nAnd here, to the north of the river, a great kingdom had been founded by\r\na king of the Dacian people, which corresponds roughly with the modern\r\nRoumania. A glance at a map of the Empire will show that such a kingdom\r\nwould be a standing menace to Italy, to Greece, and even to the\r\npeninsula of Asia Minor, and from the Roman point of view Trajan was\r\nquite justified in his determination to conquer and annex it. He carried\r\nout this policy in two successive wars, with consummate daring and\r\nskill. Dacia became a Roman province, and lasted as such long enough\r\n(about 200 years) to be an effectual help to imperial defence in this\r\nquarter. The story of the two wars is told in the marvellous series of\r\nsculptures forming a spiral round the column of Trajan, which stood and\r\nstill stands at Rome in the forum built by him and called by his name.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his life Trajan embarked on a new policy in the East,\r\nand failed to carry it out. The shrewd Augustus, as we saw, had trusted\r\nhere to his prestige, knowing that war in this region was both perilous\r\nand expensive. Since then both peril and expense had been incurred here\r\nunder Nero, and no definite results had been gained. Trajan, however,\r\nprovoked by a move of the Parthian king, made up his mind to seize\r\nArmenia, the old bone of contention between Rome and Parthia, and not\r\nonly did this, but added by conquest two other provinces, Mesopotamia\r\nand Assyria. Some historians have thought his judgment as good here as\r\nit was on the Danube. The best way of deciding the question is to look\r\ncarefully at a map of the Empire and then to ask oneself whether these\r\nterritories were really needed for the protection of Mediterranean\r\ncivilisation. For myself I unhesitatingly answer in the negative; but\r\nthere is no need to dispute the point here, as Trajan died before he had\r\nmade his conquests secure. The Jews dispersed all over these regions,\r\nurged by their implacable hatred of Rome, stirred up rebellion in\r\nTrajan’s rear with alarming ferocity, and in the middle of this turmoil\r\nhe died on his way back to Rome. His successor Hadrian at once renounced\r\nany attempt to keep the new provinces.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust to the memory of a great man if we were to think of\r\nTrajan as a soldier only. He was a strenuous man, unsparing of himself\r\nin any part of his duty. He pursued a policy of public benefit in Italy,\r\nstriving, like Augustus, to encourage agriculture and population, and\r\ncarrying out a plan of his predecessor Nerva for providing a fund for\r\nthe education of poor children. This last institution became an\r\nimportant one, and shows well how really benevolent—perhaps even to\r\nexcess—how anxious for the well-being of Italy, were the Cæsars of the\r\nsecond century. Money was lent by the State to the Italian farmers in\r\nneed of it, and the interest, at five per cent., was appropriated to the\r\neducation of boys up to eighteen and girls up to fourteen years of age.\r\n\r\nTrajan bestowed the same minute care on the provinces. In most of these\r\nthere was no trouble, but in one case, Bithynia, which had been under\r\nSenatorial governors, he had to send out a special commissioner to\r\nrepair neglect and mischief. Luckily for us it happened that this\r\ncommissioner was Pliny the younger, nephew of the great encyclopædist of\r\nthe same name; and Pliny was so prominent a figure of the time that his\r\ncorrespondence has been preserved. That part of it which contains his\r\nletters to Trajan, and Trajan’s brief and pithy answers, is one of the\r\nmost precious treasures that have survived from ancient literature.\r\nPliny consults him on a variety of details, some of them almost\r\nludicrously petty, some of them of general importance, such as a famous\r\none about his policy towards the Christians; and the answers show us\r\nTrajan as a shrewd and sensible man, fully aware that in such a unity as\r\nthe Roman Empire there must needs be diversity, and that governors must\r\nlearn to adapt themselves to such diversity without losing hold of the\r\nprinciples of justice and equity. Before we leave this subject it may be\r\nas well to mention that this constant interchange of letters between\r\npersons more than a thousand miles apart need astonish no one. In the\r\ninterest of imperialism the public posts had been thoroughly organised\r\nby Augustus; the roads were excellent, the shipping well seen to, and\r\ntravelling was at least as easy and rapid as it was in England less than\r\na century ago.\r\n\r\nTrajan’s strong and rather rugged features, familiar to all students of\r\nthe Empire, are in striking contrast to those of his three successors.\r\nHe was clean shaven, but his next successor, Hadrian, introduced the\r\npractice of wearing his beard, and this was adhered to. All the imperial\r\nportraits of this age, as preserved on coins and sculptures, are\r\nperfectly authentic, and the likenesses are consistent. In the British\r\nMuseum the reader may see the features of these great Cæsars as\r\nfaithfully reproduced as those of British statesmen in the National\r\nPortrait Gallery.\r\n\r\nTrajan was succeeded by his cousin Hadrian, beyond doubt one of the most\r\ncapable and efficient men who ever wielded great power. No one can study\r\nhis reign without feeling that it was better in this age, if an\r\nefficient man could be found, that his hand alone should be on the helm.\r\nProbably Hadrian was only one of many who might have done as well as he\r\ndid, for there was now a spirit abroad of intelligent industry directed\r\nto the good of the State; yet it is almost certain that the Empire was\r\nthe better for not having the sovereignty put into commission. It has\r\nbeen well said of Hadrian that he desired “to see himself all that was\r\nto be seen, to know all that was to be known, to do all that was to be\r\ndone”; and subsequent events proved that this intelligent industry could\r\nhardly have been carried all through the imperial work with equal\r\neffect, had it been shared with others.\r\n\r\nHadrian accomplished his work by two long periods of travel, each\r\nlasting some four years. Without any pomp or state he made himself\r\nacquainted with all parts of the Empire and their needs, as no ruler had\r\ndone since Augustus and Agrippa shared such a task between them. The\r\nmore immediate object was to inspect the frontiers and secure them, and\r\nas Hadrian was a trained soldier, with much experience under Trajan,\r\nthis was to him familiar work. But he was so full of curiosity, so\r\nanxious to see all that the Empire had to show him, that while he\r\npractised his indefatigable industry he could also gratify his\r\nintelligence. In this he was more like Julius Cæsar than any other Roman\r\nwe know of, though in most traits of character he was very different\r\nfrom that great man. It is not possible here to describe Hadrian’s\r\nfrontier work in detail, but a specimen of it shall be given which\r\nshould be interesting to British readers.\r\n\r\nBritain had been invaded by Claudius in the previous century, and the\r\nsouthern part of the island had been made into a Roman province. Since\r\nthen the frontier had been pushed farther north, and the frontier\r\nstrongholds were no longer Colchester and Gloucester, but Lincoln,\r\nChester and York. Hadrian spent several months here in the course of his\r\nfirst journey, and his visit had a remarkable result which we can see\r\nwith our eyes at this moment. He must have noted two facts: first, the\r\nunsettled and rebellious condition of the natives of Yorkshire and\r\nNorthumberland (Brigantes): and secondly, the narrow waist of the island\r\nbetween the Solway Firth and the mouth of the Tyne. He must have\r\nreasoned that if Roman forces could be permanently established on a\r\nfortified line between the two seas, this line would serve as a check on\r\nthe Brigantes, and also as a base of operations for further advance\r\nnorthwards.\r\n\r\nThus it is that “Hadrian’s wall” remains as the most striking of all\r\nRoman works in our island. It is about seventy miles long, and consisted\r\neventually (for we cannot be sure that it was completed by Hadrian) of a\r\nstone wall on the northern side, twenty feet high, an earthen rampart on\r\nthe southern side, and a military road between them. At intervals there\r\nwere fortified stations, seventeen in all, including the two which\r\nconnected the lines with the sea; of these two the eastern one, near\r\nNewcastle, now famous for its collieries, is still known as _Wallsend_.\r\nThe wall enabled the Romans to advance northwards, and soon another\r\nfortification was built on a smaller scale between the Forth and Clyde,\r\nabout which a large volume has just been published by Dr. G. Macdonald,\r\nof Edinburgh. The conquest of the Highlands was never, indeed, carried\r\nout; but Hadrian’s great work had an immense moral effect on the\r\npopulation to the south of it, and Britain became very substantially\r\nRomanised. Towns and country houses (_villæ_) sprang up in abundance\r\nalong or near the military roads. As I write these lines in North\r\nOxfordshire, I have the remains of several of these _villæ_ within easy\r\nreach, and can visit, each in a day, at least four considerable Roman\r\ntowns, viz. Cirencester, Gloucester, Silchester (Calleva), and last, but\r\nnot least, Bath (Aquæ Sulis), where the Romans found and used, as they\r\nalways did in such spots, the magnificent hot springs, building noble\r\nbaths about them which may be seen to this day.\r\n\r\nHadrian’s care for the good working of the civil government was as great\r\nas his zeal for frontier defence. Two forward steps were taken by him in\r\nthis department, both of which helped on that consolidation of the\r\nEmpire which was his constant aim.\r\n\r\nFirst, he organised and dignified the Civil Service, on which the actual\r\ngood working of the whole system depended. Cæsar’s share in this work\r\nhad steadily been increasing while that of the Senate diminished; yet\r\nCæsar had so far done his part, as we saw just now, with the help only\r\nof his own personal “servants,” who were mostly freedmen, _i.e._ slaves\r\nby origin, and many of them Greeks. Hadrian now established a public\r\nimperial civil service, of which the members must be Roman knights,\r\n_i.e._ men of a certain consequence in regard to birth and property.\r\nThese new civil servants were excused all military service, and could\r\nthus be trained to the work without interruption, during their earlier\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we may date from Hadrian’s reign the beginning of the\r\nconsolidation of Roman law, and the rise of a school of great lawyers\r\nsuch as the world has never known since. Apart from the defence of\r\nMediterranean civilisation, to which, indeed, its indirect contribution\r\nwas not small, this was the most valuable legacy of Rome to modern\r\nEurope. Law had originally consisted mainly of the old legal rules of\r\nthe city-state of Rome, embodied in the Twelve tables, and a few\r\nstatutes; but, in course of time, through the need of interpreting\r\nthese, and adjusting them to the customs of other peoples in the Empire,\r\nan immense body of what we may call _judge-made law_ had arisen in the\r\nform of edicts or public notices of magistrates, issued both in Italy\r\nand the provinces. As these customs were now well known, and as the\r\nEmpire had reached its limits, it was possible to close and consolidate\r\nthis huge body of official decisions and precedents; and this was done\r\nunder Hadrian’s direction. The other two sources of law were still to\r\ngrow largely before they could be welded into the great “Body of Law”\r\n(_Corpus Juris_) compiled under the orders of Justinian in the sixth\r\ncentury, which is still the chief European textbook of legal studies.\r\nThese two sources were the delivered opinions of wise lawyers on points\r\nof law, and the decisions of the Cæsars in various forms, all of which\r\nhad the force of law.\r\n\r\nThe death of Hadrian in A.D. 138 brings us to the third of the great\r\nCæsars of this age, Titus Antoninus, a man who, at fifty-two, had\r\nalready done excellent work for the Empire. He is known to history as\r\nAntoninus Pius, and this last name, given him apparently on his\r\naccession, may be a reminiscence of Virgil’s epithet for his hero, and\r\nmay be due to the strong sense of duty which marked his whole life,\r\npublic and private. He seems, indeed, vividly to recall the ideal of the\r\nRoman character as we traced it in the third chapter of this book; yet\r\nhe was not Italian by birth. His family belonged to Nismes in southern\r\nGaul, and that ancient city still honours him with a “Place Antonin,” in\r\nwhich his statue stands. His features, as they appear on portrait busts,\r\nentirely confirm the account of him left us by his nephew and successor.\r\nGrave and wise, gentle yet firm, religious in the true old Roman sense,\r\npure in life, and simple in all his needs and pleasures, he ruled over a\r\npeaceful and contented empire, devoting himself to the work of\r\nhumanising and softening the life and lot of his subjects.\r\n\r\nLet us glance, for example, at his attitude towards slavery, which, when\r\nwe last noticed it, was threatening to become a deadly poison in the\r\nRoman system. During the first century of the Empire, chiefly under the\r\ninfluence of the Stoic philosophy, as later on under that of\r\nChristianity, there had been growing up a feeling that a slave was,\r\nafter all, a human being, and had some claim to be treated as such under\r\nthe Roman law, beneficent in its dealings with all other human beings.\r\nAntoninus followed out this new idea both in legislation and in his\r\nprivate life, as did his successor also, who adored his memory. They\r\nlimited the right of a master over his slaves in several ways; ordaining\r\nthat if cruelty were proved against a master, he should be compelled to\r\nsell the slave he had ill-treated. It is noteworthy, too, that the\r\nphilosopher in whom they most delighted, Epictetus, had himself\r\noriginally been a slave. There is no better way of realising the spirit\r\nof humanity which actuated Antoninus and his successor than by making\r\nsome acquaintance with the moral philosophy of Epictetus, and the\r\n_Meditations_ of Marcus Aurelius. The _Golden Sayings of Epictetus_, in\r\nthe Golden Treasury Series,[18] and Dr. Rendall’s translation of the\r\n_Meditations_, will be of use to those who do not read Greek.\r\n\r\nHadrian had left the Empire well guarded, and it does not seem to have\r\noccurred to Antoninus to see for himself that Hadrian’s vigilance was\r\nmaintained. This was the one weak point of his reign, and it cost his\r\nsuccessors dear. He only once left Italy, and his mind was never\r\noccupied with wars or rumours of wars; he lived tranquilly, and died\r\npeacefully, without trouble or anxiety. But we know that even before his\r\ndeath clouds were beginning to gather on the northern frontier; and we\r\ncannot but feel that the beautiful tranquillity of Antoninus’s life was\r\nhardly compatible with the duty of an imperial guardian.\r\n\r\nMarcus Aurelius, the author of the _Meditations_, succeeded his uncle\r\nand adoptive father in A.D. 161. Though not the greatest of the four as\r\na ruler, he was the most remarkable as a man, and holds a higher place\r\nthan the others in the world’s esteem. We may find parallels in history\r\nto Trajan, less easily, perhaps, to Hadrian and Antoninus; but there is\r\nno monarch like Marcus, not even in the history of the Jews. It is,\r\nindeed, astonishing that Rome, Rome of the hard practical temperament,\r\nshould have produced a ruler who was a philosopher and almost a saint,\r\nand yet capable of government. It is the last striking manifestation of\r\nthe old Roman spirit of duty and discipline, now kindled into a real\r\nethical emotion by the teaching of the Stoics, far the most inspiring\r\ncreed then available for a man of action. Without any aid from\r\nChristianity, which, indeed, he could not understand and occasionally\r\npersecuted, Marcus learnt not only how to make his own life pure, but\r\nhow to live and work for the world of his day.\r\n\r\nBut saintliness on the throne, as in the case of St. Louis of France,\r\nhas its drawbacks in practical work. It is, perhaps, true that the mind\r\nof Marcus was more active, and found greater satisfaction, in\r\nquestioning itself than in anxious inquiry into the state of the Empire.\r\nHe was not one of those of whom our poet says that they do Duty’s work\r\n_and know it not_; and as a consequence his days were not serene and\r\nbright. He had a tendency to be morbid, and, like all morbid men, he was\r\nserious even to sadness. It has been well said of him that he is always\r\ninsisting on his faith in a universe in which, nevertheless, he can find\r\nnothing but disappointment.\r\n\r\nHis sensitiveness about his duty sometimes warped his judgment and\r\nblunted his discernment of character. At the outset he made a bad\r\nblunder in dividing the imperial power with his brother by adoption,\r\nLucius Verus, who had little principle and much leaning to pleasure. To\r\nhim he committed the charge of a war with Parthia which became\r\ninevitable, and though the Roman arms were successful, this was not due\r\nto the skill or energy of either Marcus or Verus. Had a strong\r\nscientific mind been in command, it might have been possible to avert or\r\nmitigate a calamity which now fell on the Mediterranean world, and had a\r\nshare, perhaps a large one, in the decay and fall of the Empire. The\r\nlegions brought back with them from the East one of the most terrible\r\nplagues known to history, which can only be compared for its effects\r\nwith the Black Death in the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nNot only in the East, but nearer home, Marcus had to meet formidable\r\nfoes who broke through the frontiers with which Hadrian had taken such\r\npains. Pushed forward by pressure from the rear, German tribes\r\nunwillingly made their way into Roman territory, overran the new\r\nprovince of Dacia, crossed the Danube, and even passed over the Alps\r\ninto Italy. Marcus’s difficulties were great, but he met them with\r\npatience and courage. The pestilence had so greatly thinned the\r\npopulation that both men and money were wanting for the war, and the\r\nstruggle to drive back the unwilling invaders was prolonged for thirteen\r\nyears. It was still going on when Marcus died of fever in camp at\r\nVienna. As he closed his eyes in his tent he must have felt that he had\r\nspent himself in vain, and that evil days were in store for the Empire.\r\nHe left a worthless son, Commodus, who failed to understand the danger,\r\nand let things go.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need not follow the Empire in its downward course. We have seen what\r\nthe work of Rome in the world was to be, and how at last she\r\naccomplished it in spite of constant peril and frequent disaster. From\r\nMarcus Aurelius onwards the strain of self-defence was too great to\r\nallow of progress in any social or political sense. The monarchy became\r\nmore absolute, the machinery of government more complicated; the masses\r\nwere over-taxed, and the middle classes ruined. Depopulation again set\r\nin, and attempts to remedy it by settling barbarian invaders within the\r\nfrontiers had some bad results. In less than a century from the death of\r\nMarcus the Empire had been divided into two halves of east and west,\r\nwith a new capital for the eastern half at Byzantium (Constantinople).\r\nThis, like all the changes of the later Empire, was meant strictly for\r\nthe purpose of resisting the invaders; but, none the less, they broke at\r\nlast through all barriers.\r\n\r\nYet this did not happen before the name and fame of Rome had made such\r\ndeep impression on their minds that they sought to deserve the\r\ninheritance which had thus fallen to them; despising, indeed, the\r\ndegenerate provincials who struck no blow in their own defence, but full\r\nof respect for the majestic power which had for so many centuries\r\nconfronted and instructed them.[19] They never swept away the\r\ncivilisation of the Mediterranean; from Julius onwards the Roman rulers\r\nhad done so much to defend it, had raised its prestige so high, had so\r\nthoroughly organised its internal life, that uncivilised peoples neither\r\ncould nor would destroy it.\r\n\r\nWe still enjoy its best fruits—the art, science and literature of\r\nHellas, the genius of Rome for law—for “the just interference of the\r\nState in the interests and passions of humanity.”[20] We may be apt at\r\nthe present day, when science has opened out for us so many new paths of\r\nknowledge, and inspired us with such enthusiasm in pursuing them, to\r\nforget the value of the inheritance which Rome preserved for us. But\r\nthis is merely a passing phase of feeling; it is really quite\r\ninconsistent with the character of an age which recognises the doctrine\r\nof evolution as its great discovery. It is natural to civilised man to\r\ngo back upon his past, and to be grateful for all profit he can gain\r\nfrom the study of his own development. So we may be certain that the\r\nclaim of Greece and Rome to our eternal gratitude will never cease to be\r\nasserted, and their right to teach us still what we could have learnt\r\nnowhere else, will never be successfully disputed.\r\n\r\n  _November, 1911._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are suggested as among those most likely to be\r\nuseful to students who wish to pursue the subject further—\r\n\r\nI.
