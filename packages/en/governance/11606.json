His proposed statute consists of eighty-two clauses,\r\nand is fortified by a \"whereas\" of a hundred and thirteen weighty\r\nreasons. He exhausts the range of history to show the frightful results\r\nwhich have followed this taste of the fruit of the tree of knowledge;\r\nquotes the Encyclopédie, to prove that the woman who knows the alphabet\r\nhas already lost a portion of her innocence; cites the opinion of\r\nMolière, that any female who has unhappily learned anything in this line\r\nshould affect ignorance, when possible; asserts that knowledge rarely\r\nmakes men attractive, and females never; opines that women have no\r\noccasion to peruse Ovid's \"Art of Love,\" since they know it all in\r\nadvance; remarks that three-quarters of female authors are no better\r\nthan they should be; maintains that Madame Guion would have been far\r\nmore useful, had she been merely pretty and an ignoramus, such as Nature\r\nmade her,--that Ruth and Naomi could not read, and Boaz probably\r\nwould never have married into the family, had they possessed that\r\naccomplishment,--that the Spartan women did not know the alphabet, nor\r\nthe Amazons, nor Penelope, nor Andromache, nor Lucretia, nor Joan of\r\nArc, nor Petrarch's Laura, nor the daughters of Charlemagne, nor the\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five wives of Mohammed;--but that Sappho and\r\nMadame de Maintenon could read altogether too well, while the case of\r\nSaint Brigitta, who brought forth twelve children and twelve books, was\r\nclearly exceptional, and afforded no safe precedent.\r\n\r\nWe take it, that the brilliant Frenchman has touched the root of the\r\nmatter. Ought women to learn the alphabet? There the whole question\r\nlies. Concede this little fulcrum, and Archimedea will move the world\r\nbefore she has done with it; it becomes merely a question of time.\r\nResistance must be made here or nowhere. _Obsta principiis_. Woman must\r\nbe a subject or an equal; there is no middle ground. What if the Chinese\r\nproverb should turn out to be, after all, the summit of wisdom,--\"For\r\nmen, to cultivate virtue is knowledge; for women, to renounce knowledge\r\nis virtue\"?\r\n\r\nNo doubt, the progress of events is slow, like the working of the laws\r\nof gravitation generally. Certainly, there has been but little change in\r\nthe legal position of woman since China was in its prime, until within\r\nthe last dozen years. Lawyers admit that the fundamental theory of\r\nEnglish and Oriental law is the same on this point: Man and wife are\r\none, and that one is the husband. It is the oldest of legal traditions.\r\nWhen Blackstone declares that \"the very being and existence of the woman\r\nis suspended during the marriage,\" and American Kent echoes that \"her\r\nlegal existence and authority are in a manner lost,\"--when Petersdorff\r\nasserts that \"the husband has the right of imposing such corporeal\r\nrestraints as he may deem necessary,\" and Bacon that \"the husband hath,\r\nby law, power and dominion over his wife, and may keep her by force\r\nwithin the bounds of duty, and may beat her, but not in a violent or\r\ncruel manner,\"[A]--when Mr. Justice Coleridge rules that the husband,\r\nin certain cases, \"has a right to confine his wife in his own\r\ndwelling-house and restrain her from liberty for an indefinite time,\"\r\nand Baron Alderson sums it all up tersely, \"The wife is only the\r\n_servant_ of her husband,\"--these high authorities simply reaffirm the\r\ndogma of the Gentoo code, four thousand years old and more:--\"A man,\r\nboth day and night, must keep his wife so much in subjection that she by\r\nno means be mistress of her own actions. If the wife have her own free\r\nwill, notwithstanding she be of a superior caste, she will behave\r\namiss.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It may be well to fortify this point by a racy extract from\r\nthat rare and amusing old book, the pioneer of its class, entitled \"The\r\nLawes Resolutions of Women's Rights, or the Lawes Provision for Woman.\r\nA Methodicall Collection of such Statutes and Customes, with the Cases,\r\nOpinions, Arguments, and Points of Learning in the Law as doe properly\r\nconcern Women.\" London: A.D. 1632. pp. 404. 4to. The pithy sentences\r\nlose immeasurably, however, by being removed from their original\r\nblack-letter setting.\r\n\r\n\"_Lib. III Sect. VII, The Baron may beate his Wife_.\r\n\r\n\"The rest followeth, Justice Brooke 12. H. 8. fo. 1. affirmeth plainly,\r\nthat if a man beat an out-law, a traitor, a Pagan, his villein, or his\r\nwife, it is dispunishable, because by the Law Common these persons can\r\nhaue no action: God send Gentle women better sport, or better companie.\r\n\r\n\"But it seemeth to be very true, that there is some kind of castigation\r\nwhich Law permits a Husband to vse; for if a woman be threatned by her\r\nhusband to bee beaten, mischieued, or slaine, Fitzherbert sets donne a\r\nWrit which she may sve out of Chancery to compell him to finde surety of\r\nhonest behauiour toward her, and that he shall neither doe nor procure\r\nto be done to her (marke I pray you) any bodily damage, otherwise then\r\nappertaines to the office of a Husband for lawfull and reasonable\r\ncorrection. See for this the new Nat. bre. fo. 80 f. & fo. 23S f.\r\n\r\n\"How farre that extendeth I cannot tell, but herein the sexe feminine is\r\nat no very great disaduantage: for first for the lawfulnesse; If it be\r\nin no other regard lawfull to beat a man's wife, then because the poore\r\nwench can sve no other action for it, I pray why may not the Wife beat\r\nthe Husband againe, what action can he haue if she doe: where two\r\ntenants in Common be on a horse, and one them will trauell and vse this\r\nhorse, hee may keepe it from his Companion a yeare two or three and so\r\nbe euen with him; so the actionlesse woman beaten by her Husband, hath\r\nretaliation left to beate him againe, if she dare. If he come to the\r\nChancery or Justices in the Country of the peace against her, because\r\nher recognizance alone will hardly bee taken, he were best be bound for\r\nher, and then if he be beaten the second time, let him know the price of\r\nit on God's name.\"]\r\n\r\nYet behind these unchanging institutions, a pressure has been for\r\ncenturies becoming concentrated, which, now that it has begun to act, is\r\nthreatening to overthrow them all. It has not yet operated very visibly\r\nin the Old World, where (even in England) the majority of women have\r\nnot yet mastered the alphabet, and can not sign their own names in the\r\nmarriage-register. But in this country, the vast changes of the last\r\ntwelve years are already a matter of history. No trumpet has been\r\nsounded, no earthquake felt, while State after State has ushered into\r\nlegal existence one half of the population within its borders. Every\r\nFree State in the American Union, except perhaps Illinois and New\r\nJersey, has conceded to married women, in some form, the separate\r\ncontrol of property. Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and\r\nPennsylvania have gone farther, and given them the control of their own\r\nearnings,--given it wholly and directly, that is,--while New York\r\nand other States have given it partially or indirectly. Legislative\r\ncommittees in Ohio and Wisconsin have recommended, in printed reports,\r\nthe extension of the right of suffrage to women; Kentucky (like Canada)\r\nhas actually extended it, in certain educational matters, and a\r\nMassachusetts legislative committee has suggested the same thing; while\r\nthe Kansas Constitutional Convention came within a dozen votes of\r\nextending it without reserve, and expunging the word _male_ from the\r\nConstitution. Surely, here and now, might poor M. Maréchal exclaim. The\r\nbitter fruits of the original seed appear, and the sad question recurs,\r\nwhether women ought ever to have tasted of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nMr. Everett, perhaps without due caution, advocated, last summer, the\r\naffirmative of this question. With his accustomed eloquence, he urged on\r\nthe attention of Suleiman Bey the fact of the equal participation of the\r\nsexes in the public-school system of Boston, while omitting to explain\r\nto him that the equality is of very recent standing. No doubt, the\r\neminent Oriental would have been pleased to hear that this public\r\nadministration of the alphabet to females, on any terms, is an\r\ninstitution but little more than a half-century old in the city of\r\nBoston. It is well established by the early deeds and documents that a\r\nlarge proportion of Puritan women could not write their own names; and\r\nin Boston especially, for a hundred and fifty years, the public schools\r\nincluded boys only. In the year 1789, however, the notable discovery was\r\nmade, that the average attendance of pupils from April to October was\r\nonly one half of that reported for the remainder of the year. This was\r\nan obvious waste of money and accommodations, and it was therefore\r\nproposed that female pupils should be annually introduced during this\r\nintermediate period. Accordingly, school-girls, like other flowers,\r\nblossomed in summer only; and this state of things lasted, with\r\nbut slight modification, for some forty years, according to the\r\nSchool-Superintendent's Third Report. It was not till 1828 that all\r\ndistinctions were abolished in the Boston Common Schools; in the High\r\nSchools lingering far later, sole vestige of the \"good old times,\"\r\nbefore a mistaken economy overthrew the wholesome doctrine of M. Sylvain\r\nMaréchal, and let loose the alphabet among women.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Eve ruined us all, according to theology, without\r\nknowing her letters. Still, there is something to be said in defence\r\nof that venerable ancestress. The Veronese lady, Isotta Nogarola, five\r\nhundred and thirty-six of whose learned letters were preserved by De\r\nThou, composed a dialogue on the question, Whether Adam or Eve had\r\ncommitted the greater sin? But Ludovico Domenichi, in his \"Dialogue on\r\nthe Nobleness of Women,\" maintains that Eve did not sin at all, because\r\nshe was not even created when Adam was told not to eat the apple. It is\r\n\"in Adam all died,\" he shrewdly says; nobody died in Eve;--which\r\nlooks plausible. Be that as it may, Eve's daughters are in danger of\r\nswallowing a whole harvest of forbidden fruit, in these revolutionary\r\ndays, unless something be done to cut off the supply.\r\n\r\nIt has been seriously asserted that during the last half-century more\r\nbooks have been written by women and about women than during all the\r\nprevious uncounted ages. It may be true; although, when we think of the\r\ninnumerable volumes of _Mémoires_ by Frenchwomen of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries,--each one justifying the existence of her own ten\r\nvolumes by the remark, that all her contemporaries were writing as\r\nmany,--we have our doubts. As to the increased multitude of general\r\ntreatises on the female sex, however,--its education, life, health,\r\ndiseases, charms, dress, deeds, sphere, rights, wrongs, work, wages,\r\nencroachments, and idiosyncrasies generally,--there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever; and the poorest of these books recognizes a condition of\r\npublic sentiment which no other age ever dreamed of. Still, literary\r\nhistory preserves the names of some reformers before the Reformation, in\r\nthis matter. There was Signora Moderata Fonte, the Venetian, who left a\r\nbook to be published after her death, in 1592, \"Dei Meriti delle Donne.\"\r\nThere was her townswoman, Lucrezia Marinella, who followed ten years\r\nafter, with her essay, \"La Nobilità e la Eccelenza delle Donne, con\r\nDifetti e Mancamenti degli Domini,\"--a comprehensive theme, truly! Then\r\nfollowed the all-accomplished Anna Maria Schurman, in 1645, with her\r\n\"Dissertatio de Ingenii Muliebris ad Doctrinam et meliores Literas\r\nAptitudine,\" with a few miscellaneous letters appended, in Greek and\r\nHebrew. At last came boldly Jacquette Guillaume, in 1665, and threw down\r\nthe gauntlet in her title-page, \"Les Dames Illustres; où par bonnes et\r\nfortes Raisons il se prouve que le Sexe Feminin surpasse en toute Sorte\r\nde Genre le Sexe Masculin\"; and with her came Margaret Boufflet and a\r\nhost of others; and finally, in England, Mary Wollstonecraft, whose\r\nfamous book, formidable in its day, would seem rather conservative\r\nnow,--and in America, that pious and worthy dame, Mrs. H. Mather\r\nCrocker, Cotton Mather's grandchild, who, in 1818, published the first\r\nbook on the \"Rights of Woman\" ever written on this side the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there have never been wanting men, and strong men, to echo\r\nthese appeals. From Cornelius Agrippa and his essay (1509) on the\r\nexcellence of woman and her preëminence over man, down to the first\r\nyouthful thesis of Agassiz, \"Mens Feminae Viri Animo superior,\" there\r\nhas been a succession of voices crying in the wilderness. In England,\r\nAnthony Gibson wrote a book, in 1599, called \"A Woman's Woorth, defended\r\nagainst all the Men in the World, proouing them to be more Perfect,\r\nExcellent, and Absolute in all Vertuous Actions than any Man of what\r\nQualitie soever, _Interlarded with Poetry.\" Per contra,_ the learned\r\nAcidalius published a book in Latin and afterwards in French, to prove\r\nthat women are not reasonable creatures. Modern theologians are at worst\r\nmerely sub-acid, and do not always say so, if they think so. Meanwhile\r\nmost persons have been content to leave the world to go on its old\r\ncourse, in this matter as in others, and have thus acquiesced in that\r\nstern judicial decree, with which Timon of Athens sums up all his curses\r\nupon womankind,--\"If there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of\r\nthem be--as they are.\"\r\n\r\nAncient or modern, nothing in any of these discussions is so valuable as\r\nthe fact of the discussion itself. There is no discussion where there is\r\nno wrong. Nothing so indicates wrong as this morbid self-inspection. The\r\ncomplaints are a perpetual protest, the defences a perpetual confession.\r\nIt is too late to ignore the question, and once opened, it can be\r\nsettled only on absolute and permanent principles. There is a wrong; but\r\nwhere? Does woman already know too much, or too little? Was she created\r\nfor man's subject, or his equal? Shall she have the alphabet, or not?\r\n\r\nAncient mythology, which undertook to explain everything, easily\r\naccounted for the social and political disabilities of woman. Goguet\r\nquotes the story from St. Augustine, who got it from Varro. Cecrops,\r\nbuilding Athens, saw starting from the earth an olive-plant and a\r\nfountain, side by side. The Delphic oracle said, that this indicated a\r\nstrife between Minerva and Neptune for the honor of giving a name to the\r\ncity, and that the people must decide between them. Cecrops thereupon\r\nassembled the men, and the women also, who then had a right to vote; and\r\nthe result was that Minerva carried the election by a glorious majority\r\nof one. Then Attica was overflowed and laid waste; of course the\r\ncitizens attributed the calamity to Neptune, and resolved to punish the\r\nwomen. It was therefore determined that in future they should not vote,\r\nnor should any child bear the name of its mother.\r\n\r\nThus easily did mythology explain all troublesome inconsistencies. But\r\nit is much that it should even have recognized them, at so early an\r\nepoch, as needing explanation. When we ask for a less symbolical\r\nelucidation, it lies within our reach. At least, it is not hard to take\r\nthe first steps into the mystery. There are, to be sure, some flowers of\r\nrhetoric in the way. The obstacle to the participation of woman in the\r\nalphabet, or in any other privilege, has been thought by some to be the\r\nfear of impairing her delicacy, or of destroying her domesticity, or of\r\nconfounding the distinction between the sexes. We think otherwise. These\r\nhave been plausible excuses; they have even been genuine, though minor,\r\nanxieties. But the whole thing, we take it, had always one simple,\r\nintelligible basis,--sheer contempt for the supposed intellectual\r\ninferiority of woman. She was not to be taught, because she was not\r\nworth teaching. The learned Acidalius, aforesaid, was in the majority.\r\nAccording to Aristotle and the Peripatetics, woman was _animal\r\noccasionatum_, as if a sort of monster and accidental production.\r\nMediaeval councils, charitably asserting her claims to the rank of\r\nhumanity, still pronounced her unfit for instruction. In the Hindoo\r\ndramas, she did not even speak the same language with her master, but\r\nused the dialect of slaves. When, in the sixteenth century, Françoise de\r\nSaintonges wished to establish girls' schools in France, she was hooted\r\nin the streets, and her father called together four doctors, learned in\r\nthe law, to decide whether she was not possessed by demons, to think of\r\neducating women,--_pour s'assurer qu'instraire des femmes n'était pas un\r\noeuvre du démon_.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with political rights. The foundation of the Salic\r\nLaw was not any sentimental anxiety to guard female delicacy and\r\ndomesticity; it was, as stated by Froissart, a blunt, hearty contempt:\r\n\"The kingdom of France being too noble to be ruled by a woman.\" And\r\nthe same principle was reaffirmed for our own institutions, in rather\r\nsoftened language, by Theophilus Parsons, in his famous defence of the\r\nrights of Massachusetts _men_ (the \"Essex Result,\" in 1778): \"Women,\r\nwhat age soever they are of, are not considered as having a sufficient\r\nacquired discretion [to exercise the franchise].\"\r\n\r\nIn harmony with this are the various maxims and _bon mots_ of eminent\r\nmen, in respect to women. Niebuhr thought he should not have educated a\r\ngirl well,--he should have made her know too much. Lessing said, \"The\r\nwoman who thinks is like the man who puts on rouge, ridiculous.\"\r\nVoltaire said, \"Ideas are like beards; women and young men have none.\"\r\nAnd witty Dr. Maginn carries to its extreme the atrocity: \"We like to\r\nhear a few words of sense from a woman, as we do from a parrot, because\r\nthey are so unexpected.\" Yet how can we wonder at these opinions, when\r\nthe saints have been severer than the sages? since the pious Fénelon\r\ntaught that true virgin delicacy was almost as incompatible with\r\nlearning as with vice,--and Dr. Channing complained, in his \"Essay on\r\nExclusion and Denunciation,\" of \"women forgetting the tenderness of\r\ntheir sex\" and arguing on theology.\r\n\r\nNow this impression of feminine inferiority may be right or wrong, but\r\nit obviously does a good deal towards explaining the facts it takes for\r\ngranted. If contempt does not originally cause failure, it perpetuates\r\nit. Systematically discourage any individual or class, from birth to\r\ndeath, and they learn, in nine cases out of ten, to acquiesce in their\r\ndegradation, if not to claim it as a crown of glory. If the Abbé Choisi\r\npraised the Duchesse de Fontanges for being \"beautiful as an angel and\r\nsilly as a goose,\" it was natural that all the young ladies of the court\r\nshould resolve to make up in folly what they wanted in charms. All\r\ngenerations of women having been bred under the shadow of intellectual\r\ncontempt, they have of course done much to justify it. They have often\r\nused only for frivolous purposes even the poor opportunities allowed\r\nthem. They have employed the alphabet, as Molière said, chiefly in\r\nspelling the verb _Amo_. Their use of science has been like that of\r\nMlle. de Launay, who computed the decline in her lover's affection by\r\nhis abbreviation of their evening walk in the public square, preferring\r\nto cross it rather than take the circuit,--\"From which I inferred,\" she\r\nsays, \"that his passion had diminished in the ratio between the diagonal\r\nof a rectangular parallelogram and the sum of two adjacent sides.\"\r\nAnd their conception, even of Art, has been too often on the scale\r\nof Properzia de Rossi, who carved sixty-five heads on a walnut, the\r\nsmallest of all recorded symbols of woman's sphere.\r\n\r\nAll this might perhaps be overcome, if the social prejudice which\r\ndiscourages woman would only reward proportionately those who surmount\r\nthe discouragement. The more obstacles the more glory, if society would\r\nonly pay in proportion to the labor; but it does not. Women, being\r\ndenied not merely the antecedent training which prepares for great\r\ndeeds, but the subsequent praise and compensation which follow them,\r\nhave been weakened in both directions. The career of eminent men\r\nordinarily begins with colleges and the memories of Miltiades, and ends\r\nwith fortune and fame; woman begins under discouragement, and ends\r\nbeneath the same. Single, she works with half-preparation and half-pay;\r\nmarried, she puts name and wages into the keeping of her husband,\r\nshrinks into John Smith's \"lady\" during life, and John Smith's \"relict\"\r\non her tombstone; and still the world wonders that her deeds, like her\r\nopportunities, are inferior.\r\n\r\nEvidently, then, the advocates of woman's claims--those who hold\r\nthat \"the virtues of the man and the woman are the same,\" with\r\nAntisthenes,--or that \"the talent of the man and the woman is the same,\"\r\nwith Socrates in Xenophon's \"Banquet\"--must be cautious lest they\r\nattempt to prove too much. Of course, if women know as much as men\r\nwithout schools and colleges, there is no need of admitting them to\r\nthese institutions. If they work as well on half-pay, it diminishes the\r\ninducement to give them the other half. The safer position is, to claim\r\nthat they have done just enough to show what they might have done under\r\ncircumstances less discouraging. Take, for instance, the common remark,\r\nthat women have invented nothing. It is a valid answer, that the only\r\ntools habitually needed by woman have been the needle, the spindle, and\r\nthe basket, and tradition reports that she herself invented all three.\r\nIn the same way it may be shown that the departments in which women have\r\nequalled men have been the departments in which they have had equal\r\ntraining, equal encouragement, and equal compensation,--as, for\r\ninstance, the theatre. Madame Lagrange, the _prima donna_, after years\r\nof costly musical instruction, wins the zenith of professional success;\r\nshe receives, the newspapers affirm, sixty thousand dollars a year,\r\ntravelling-expenses for ten persons, country-houses, stables, and\r\nliveries, besides an uncounted revenue of bracelets, bouquets, and\r\n_billet-doux_. Of course, every young _débutante_ fancies the same thing\r\nwithin her own reach, with only a brief stage-vista between. On the\r\nstage there is no deduction for sex, and therefore woman has shown in\r\nthat sphere an equal genius. But every female common-school teacher in\r\nthe United States finds the enjoyment of her two hundred dollars a\r\nyear to be secretly embittered by the knowledge that the young\r\ncollege-stripling in the next school-room is paid a thousand dollars for\r\nwork no harder or more responsible than her own,--and that, too, after\r\nthe whole pathway of education has been obstructed for her and smoothed\r\nfor him. These may be gross and carnal considerations; but Faith asks\r\nher daily bread, and Fancy must be _fed_. We deny woman her fair share\r\nof training, of encouragement, of remuneration, and then talk fine\r\nnonsense about her instincts and her intuitions,--say sentimentally,\r\nwith the Oriental proverbialist, \"Every book of knowledge is implanted\r\nby nature in the heart of woman,\" and make the compliment a substitute\r\nfor the alphabet.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more absurd than to impose entirely distinct standards,\r\nin this respect, on the two sexes, or to expect that woman, any more\r\nthan man, will accomplish anything great without due preparation and\r\nadequate stimulus. Mrs. Patten, who navigated her husband's ship from\r\nCape Horn to California, would have failed in the effort, for all her\r\nheroism, if she had not, unlike most of her sex, been taught to use her\r\nBowditch. Florence Nightingale, when she heard of the distresses in the\r\nCrimea, did not, as most people imagine, rise up and say, \"I am a woman,\r\nignorant, but intuitive, with very little sense or information, but\r\nexceedingly sublime aspirations; my strength lies in my weakness; I can\r\ndo all things without knowing anything about them.\" Not at all.\r\nDuring ten years she had been in hard training for precisely such\r\nservices,--had visited all the hospitals in London, Edinburgh, Dublin,\r\nParis, Lyons, Rome, Brussels, and Berlin.--had studied under the Sisters\r\nof Charity, and been twice a nurse in the Protestant Institution at\r\nKaiserswerth. Therefore she did not merely carry to the Crimea a\r\nwoman's heart, as her stock in trade, but she knew the alphabet of\r\nher profession better than the men around her. Of course, genius and\r\nenthusiasm are, for both sexes, elements unforeseen and incalculable;\r\nbut, as a general rule, great achievements imply great preparations and\r\nfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\nTo disregard this truth is unreasonable in the abstract and cruel in its\r\nconsequences. If an extraordinary male gymnast can clear a height of ten\r\nfeet with the aid of a spring-board, it would be considered slightly\r\nabsurd to ask a woman to leap eleven feet without one; yet this is\r\nprecisely what society and the critics have always done. Training and\r\nwages and social approbation are very elastic spring-boards, and the\r\nwhole course of history has seen these offered bounteously to one sex\r\nand as sedulously withheld from the other. Let woman consent to be a\r\ndoll, and there was no finery so gorgeous, no baby-house so costly, but\r\nshe might aspire to share its lavish delights;--let her ask simply for\r\nan equal chance to learn, to labor, and to live, and it was as if that\r\nsame doll should open its lips, and propound Euclid's forty-seventh\r\nproposition. While we have all deplored the helpless position of\r\nindigent women, and lamented that they had no alternative beyond the\r\nneedle, the wash-tub, the school-room, and the street, we have yet\r\nresisted their admission into every new occupation, denied them\r\ntraining, and cut their compensation down. Like Charles Lamb, who atoned\r\nfor coming late to the office in the morning by going away early in the\r\nafternoon, we have, first, half educated women, and then, to restore\r\nthe balance, only half paid them. What innumerable obstacles have\r\nbeen placed in the way of female physicians! what a complication of\r\ndifficulties has been encountered by female printers, engravers, and\r\ndesigners! In London, Mr. Bennett was recently mobbed for lecturing to\r\nwomen on watchmaking. In this country, we have known grave professors\r\nto refuse to address lyceums which thought fit to employ an occasional\r\nfemale lecturer. Mr. Comer states that it was \"in the face of ridicule\r\nand sneers\" that he began to educate women as book-keepers, eight years\r\nago; and it is a little contemptible in the authoress of \"A Woman's\r\nThoughts on Women\" to revive the same satire now, when she must know\r\nthat in one half the retail shops in Paris her own sex rules the ledger,\r\nand Mammon knows no Salic law.\r\n\r\nWe find, on investigation, what these considerations would lead us to\r\nexpect, that eminent women have commonly been more exceptional in their\r\ntraining and position than even in their genius. They have excelled the\r\naverage of their own sex because they have had more of the ordinary\r\nadvantages of the other sex. Take any department of learning or skill;\r\ntake, for instance, the knowledge of languages, the universal alphabet,\r\nphilology.--On the great stairway, at Padua, stands the statue of Elena\r\nCornaro, professor of six languages in that once renowned university.\r\nBut Elena Cornaro was educated like a boy, by her father. On the great\r\ndoor of the University of Bologna is inscribed the epitaph of Clotilda\r\nTambroni, the honored correspondent of Person, and the first Greek\r\nscholar of Southern Europe in her day. But Clotilda Tambroni was\r\neducated like a boy, by Emanuele Aponte.--How fine are those prefatory\r\nwords, \"by a Right Reverend Prelate,\" to that pioneer book in\r\nAnglo-Saxon lore, Elizabeth Elstob's grammar: \"Our earthly possessions\r\nare indeed our patrimony, as derived to us by the industry of our\r\nfathers; but the language in which we speak is our mother-tongue, and\r\nwho so proper to play the critic in this as the females?\" But this\r\nparticular female obtained the rudiments of her rare education from her\r\nmother, before she was eight years old, in spite of much opposition from\r\nher right reverend guardians.--Adelung, the highest authority, declares\r\nthat all modern philology is founded on the translation of a Russian\r\nvocabulary into two hundred different dialects by Catherine II. But\r\nCatherine shared, in childhood, the instructors of her brother, Prince\r\nFrederick, and was subject to some reproach for learning, though a\r\ngirl, so much more rapidly than he did.--Christina of Sweden ironically\r\nreproved Madame Dacier for her translation of Callimachus: \"Such a\r\npretty girl as you are, are you not ashamed to be so learned?\" But\r\nMadame Dacier acquired Greek by contriving to do her embroidery in the\r\nroom where her father was teaching her stupid brother; and her queenly\r\ncritic had learned to read Thucydides, harder Greek than Callimachus,\r\nbefore she was fourteen.--And so down to our own day, who knows how\r\nmany mute, inglorious Minervas may have perished unenlightened, while\r\nMargaret Fuller and Elizabeth Barrett Browning were being educated \"like\r\nboys\"?\r\n\r\nThis expression simply means that they had the most solid training which\r\nthe times afforded. Most persons would instantly take alarm at the very\r\nwords; that is, they have so little faith in the distinctions which\r\nNature has established, that they think, if you teach the alphabet, or\r\nanything else, indiscriminately to both sexes, you annul all difference\r\nbetween them. The common reasoning is thus: \"Boys and girls are\r\nacknowledged to be distinct beings. Now boys study Greek and algebra,\r\nmedicine and book-keeping. Therefore girls should not.\" As if one\r\nshould say: \"Boys and girls are distinct beings. Now boys eat beef and\r\npotatoes. Therefore, obviously, girls should not.\"\r\n\r\nThe analogy between physical and spiritual food is precisely in point.\r\nThe simple truth is, that, amid the vast range of human powers and\r\nproperties, the fact of sex is but one item. Vital and momentous in\r\nitself, it does not constitute the whole organism, but only a small part\r\nof it. The distinction of male and female is special, aimed at a certain\r\nend; and apart from that end, it is, throughout all the kingdoms\r\nof Nature, of minor importance. With but trifling exceptions, from\r\ninfusorial up to man, the female animal moves, breathes, looks, listens,\r\nruns, flies, swims, pursues its food, eats it, digests it, in precisely\r\nthe same manner as the male; all instincts, all characteristics, are the\r\nsame, except as to the one solitary fact of parentage. Mr. Ten Broeck's\r\nrace-horses, Pryor and Prioress, were foaled alike, fed alike, trained\r\nalike, and finally ran side by side, competing for the same prize. The\r\neagle is not checked in soaring by any consciousness of sex, nor asks\r\nthe sex of the timid hare, its quarry. Nature, for high purposes,\r\ncreates and guards the sexual distinction, but keeps it humbly\r\nsubordinate to still more important ones.\r\n\r\nNow all this bears directly upon the alphabet. What sort of philosophy\r\nis that which says, \"John is a fool; Jane is a genius; nevertheless,\r\nJohn, being a man, should learn, lead, make laws, make money; Jane,\r\nbeing a woman, shall be ignorant, dependent, disfranchised, underpaid.\"\r\nOf course, the time is past when one would state this so frankly, though\r\nComte comes quite near it, to say nothing of the Mormons; but this\r\nformula really lies at the bottom of the reasoning one hears every day.\r\nThe answer is: Soul before sex. Give an equal chance, and let genius and\r\nindustry to the rest. _La carrière ouverte aux talens_. Every man for\r\nhimself, every woman for herself, and the alphabet for us all.\r\n\r\nThus far, our whole course of argument has been defensive and\r\nexplanatory. We have shown that woman's inferiority in special\r\nachievements, so far as it exists, is a fact of small importance,\r\nbecause it is merely a corollary from her historic position of\r\ndegradation. She has not excelled, because she has had no fair chance to\r\nexcel. Man, placing his foot upon her shoulder, has taunted her with not\r\nrising. But the ulterior question remains behind,--How came she into\r\nthis attitude, originally? Explain the explanation, the logician fairly\r\ndemands. Granted that woman is weak because she has been systematically\r\ndegraded; but why was she degraded? This is a far deeper question,--one\r\nto be met only by a profounder philosophy and a positive solution. We\r\nare coming on ground almost wholly untrod, and must do the best we can.\r\n\r\nWe venture to assert, then, that woman's social inferiority, in\r\nthe past, has been, to a great extent, a legitimate thing. To all\r\nappearance, history would have been impossible without it, just as it\r\nwould have been impossible without an epoch of war and slavery. It\r\nis simply a matter of social progress, a part of the succession of\r\ncivilizations. The past has been, and inevitably, a period of ignorance,\r\nof engrossing physical necessities, and of brute force,--not of\r\nfreedom, of philanthropy, and of culture. During that lower epoch, woman\r\nwas necessarily an inferior,--degraded by abject labor, even in time\r\nof peace,--degraded uniformly by war, chivalry to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding. Behind all the courtesies of Amadis and the Cid lay the\r\nstern fact,--woman a child or a toy. The flattering troubadours chanted\r\nher into a poet's paradise; but, alas! that kingdom of heaven suffered\r\nviolence, and the violent took it by force. The truth simply was, that\r\nher time had not come. Physical strength must rule for a time, and she\r\nwas the weaker. She was very properly refused a feudal grant, because,\r\nsay \"Les Coustumes de Normandie,\" she is not trained to war or policy:\r\n_C'est l'homme ki se bast et ki conseille_. Other authorities put it\r\nstill more plainly: \"A woman cannot serve the emperor or feudal lord in\r\nwar, on account of the decorum of her sex; nor assist him with advice,\r\nbecause of her limited intellect; nor keep his counsel, owing to the\r\ninfirmity of her disposition.\" All which was, no doubt, in the majority\r\nof cases, true, and the degradation of woman was simply a part of\r\na system, which has indeed had its day, but has bequeathed its\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nFrom this reign of force woman never freed herself by force. She could\r\nnot fight, or would not. Bohemian annals, indeed, record the legend of\r\na literal war between the sexes, in which the women's army was led by\r\nLibussa and Wlasla, and which finally ended with the capture, by the\r\narmy of men, of Castle Dziewin, Maiden's Tower, whose ruins are still\r\nvisible near Prague. The armor of Libussa is still shown at Vienna, and\r\nthe guide calls attention to the long-peaked toes of steel, with which,\r\nhe avers, the tender Princess was wont to pierce the hearts of her\r\nopponents, while careering through the battle. And there are abundant\r\ninstances in which women have fought side by side with men, and on equal\r\nterms. The ancient British women mingled in the wars of their husbands,\r\nand their princesses were trained to the use of arms in the Maiden's\r\nCastle at Edinburgh and in the Isle of Skye. The Moorish wives and\r\nmaidens fought in defence of their European peninsula; and the\r\nPortuguese women fought, on the same soil, against the armies of Philip\r\nII. The king of Siam has at present a bodyguard of four hundred women;\r\nthey are armed with lance and rifle, are admirably disciplined, and\r\ntheir commander (appointed after saving the king's life at a tiger-hunt)\r\nranks as one of the royal family and has ten elephants at her service.\r\nWhen the all-conquering Dahomian army marched upon Abbeokuta, in 1851,\r\nthey numbered ten thousand men and six thousand women; the women were,\r\nas usual, placed foremost in the assault, as being most reliable; and\r\nof the eighteen hundred bodies left dead before the walls, the vast\r\nmajority were of women. The Hospital of the Invalides, in Paris, has\r\nsheltered, for half a century, a fine specimen of a female soldier,\r\n\"Lieutenant Madame Bulan,\" now eighty-three years old, decorated by\r\nNapoleon's own hand with the cross of the Legion of Honor, and credited\r\non the hospital books with \"seven years' service,--seven campaigns,--\r\nthree wounds,--several times distinguished, especially in Corsica,\r\nin defending a fort against the English.\" But these cases, though\r\ninteresting to the historian, are still exceptional, and the instinctive\r\nrepugnance they inspire is condemnatory, not of women, but of war.\r\n\r\nThe reason, then, for the long subjection of woman has been simply that\r\nhumanity was passing through its first epoch, and her full career was to\r\nbe reserved for the second. As the different races of man have appeared\r\nsuccessively upon the stage of history, so there has been an order\r\nof succession of the sexes. Woman's appointed era, like that of the\r\nScandinavian tribes, was delayed, but not omitted. It is not merely\r\ntrue that the empire of the past has belonged to man, but that it has\r\nproperly belonged to him; for it was an empire of the muscles, enlisting\r\nat best but the lower powers of the understanding. There can be no\r\nquestion that the present epoch is initiating an empire of the higher\r\nreason, of arts, affections, aspirations; and for that epoch the genius\r\nof woman has been reserved. The spirit of the age has always kept pace\r\nwith the facts, and outstripped the statutes. Till the fulness of time\r\ncame, woman was necessarily kept a slave to the spinning-wheel and the\r\nneedle; now higher work is ready, peace has brought invention to her\r\naid, and the mechanical means for her emancipation are ready also. No\r\nuse in releasing her, till man, with his strong arm, had worked out his\r\npreliminary share in civilization. \"Earth waits for her queen\" was a\r\nfavorite motto of Margaret Fuller's; but it would be more correct to say\r\nthat the queen has waited for her earth, till it could be smoothed and\r\nprepared for her occupancy. Now Cinderella may begin to think of putting\r\non her royal robes.\r\n\r\nEverybody sees that the times are altering the whole material position\r\nof woman; but most persons do not appear to see the inevitable social\r\nand moral changes which are also involved. As has been already said, the\r\nwoman of ancient history was a slave to physical necessities, both in\r\nwar and peace. In war she could do too little, in peace she did too\r\nmuch, under the material compulsions which controlled the world. How\r\ncould the Jews, for instance, elevate woman? They could not spare her\r\nfrom the wool and the flax and the candle that goeth not out by night.\r\nIn Rome, when the bride first stepped across her threshold, they did\r\nnot ask her, Do you know the alphabet? they asked simply, Can you spin?\r\nThere was no higher epitaph than Queen Amalasontha's,--_Domum servavit,\r\nlanam fecit_. In Boeotia, brides were conducted home in vehicles whose\r\nwheels were burned at the door, in token that they were never to leave\r\nthe house again. Pythagoras instituted at Crotona an annual festival\r\nfor the distaff; Confucius, in China, did the same for the spindle; and\r\nthese celebrated not the freedom, but the serfdom, of woman.\r\n\r\nAnd even into modern days this same tyrannical necessity has lingered.\r\n\"Go spin, you jades! go spin!\" was the only answer vouchsafed by the\r\nEarl of Pembroke to the twice-banished nuns of Wilton. And even now,\r\ntravellers agree that throughout civilized Europe, with the partial\r\nexception of England and France, the profound absorption of the mass of\r\nwomen in household labors renders their general elevation impossible.\r\nBut with us Americans, and in this age, when all these vast labors\r\nare being more and more transferred to arms of brass and iron,--when\r\nRochester grinds the flour, and Lowell weaves the cloth, and the fire on\r\nthe hearth has gone into black retirement and mourning,--when the wiser\r\na virgin is, the less she has to do with oil in her lamp,--when the\r\nneedle has made its last dying speech and confession in the \"Song of\r\nthe Shirt,\" and the sewing-machine has changed those doleful marches to\r\ndelightful measures,--how is it possible for the blindest to help seeing\r\nthat a new era is begun, and that the time has come for woman to learn\r\nthe alphabet?\r\n\r\nNobody asks for any abolition of domestic labor for women, any more than\r\nof outdoor labor for men. Of course, most women will still continue to\r\nbe mainly occupied with the indoor care of their families, and most men\r\nwith their external support. All that is desirable for either sex is\r\nsuch an economy of labor, in this respect, as shall leave some spare\r\ntime, to be appropriated in other directions. The argument against each\r\nnew emancipation of woman is precisely that always made against the\r\nliberation of serfs and the enfranchisement of plebeians,--that the new\r\nposition will take them from their legitimate business. \"How can he [or\r\nshe] get wisdom that holdeth the plough, [or the broom,]--whose talk\r\nis of bullocks [or of babies]?\" Yet the American farmer has already\r\nemancipated himself from these fancied incompatibilities, and so will\r\nthe farmer's wife. In a nation where there is no leisure-class and no\r\npeasantry, this whole theory of exclusion is an absurdity. We all have a\r\nlittle leisure, and we must all make the most of it. If we will confine\r\nlarge interests and duties to those who have nothing else to do, we must\r\ngo back to monarchy at once; if otherwise, then the alphabet, and its\r\nconsequences, must be open to woman as to man. Jean Paul says nobly, in\r\nhis \"Levana,\" that, \"before and after being a mother, a woman is a human\r\nbeing, and neither maternal nor conjugal relation can supersede the\r\nhuman responsibility, but must become its means and instrument.\" And it\r\nis good to read the manly speech, on this subject, of John Quincy Adams,\r\nquoted at length by his recent venerable biographer,--in which, after\r\nfully defending the political petitions of the women of Plymouth,\r\nhe declares that \"the correct principle is, that women are not only\r\njustified, but exhibit the most exalted virtue, when they do depart from\r\nthe domestic circle, and enter on the concerns of their country, of\r\nhumanity, and of their God.\"\r\n\r\nThere are duties devolving on every human being,--duties not small or\r\nfew, but vast and varied,--which spring from home and private life, and\r\nall their sweet relations. The support or care of the humblest household\r\nis a function worthy of men, women, and angels, so far as it goes. From\r\nthese duties none must shrink, neither man nor woman; the loftiest\r\ngenius cannot ignore them; the sublimest charity must begin with them.\r\nThey are their own exceeding great reward, their self-sacrifice is\r\ninfinite joy, and the selfishness which discards them receives in return\r\nloneliness and a desolate old age. Yet these, though the most tender and\r\nintimate portion of human life, do not form its whole. It is given\r\nto noble souls to crave other interests also, added spheres, not\r\nnecessarily alien from these,--larger knowledge, larger action\r\nalso,--duties, responsibilities, anxieties, dangers, all the aliment\r\nthat history has given to its heroes. Not home less, but humanity more.\r\nWhen the high-born English lady in the Crimean hospital, ordered to a\r\npost of almost certain death, only raised her hands to heaven and said,\r\n\"Thank God!\" she did not renounce her true position as woman, she\r\nclaimed it. When the queen of James I. of Scotland, already immortalized\r\nby him in stately verse, won a higher immortality by welcoming to her\r\nfair bosom the daggers aimed at his,--when the Countess of Buchan hung\r\nconfined in her iron cage, outside Berwick Castle, in penalty for\r\ncrowning Robert the Bruce,--when the stainless soul of Joan of Arc met\r\nGod, like Moses, in a burning flame,--these things were as they should\r\nbe. Man must not monopolize these privileges of peril, birthright of\r\ngreat souls. Serenades and compliments must not replace the nobler\r\nhospitality which shares with woman the opportunity of martyrdom. Great\r\nadministrative duties also, cares of state, for which one should be born\r\ngray-headed, how nobly do these sit upon a female brow! Each year adds\r\nto the storied renown of Elizabeth of England, greatest sovereign of\r\nthe greatest of historic nations. Christina of Sweden, alone among the\r\ncrowned heads of Europe, (so says Voltaire,) sustained the dignity of\r\nthe throne against Richelieu and Mazarin. And they most assuredly\r\ndid not sacrifice their womanhood in the process; for her Britannic\r\nMajesty's wardrobe included four thousand gowns,--and Mlle. de\r\nMontpensier declares, that, when Christina had put on a wig of the\r\nlatest fashion, \"she really looked extremely pretty.\" Should this\r\nevidence of feminine attributes appear to some sterner intellects\r\nfrivolous and insufficient, it is, nevertheless, adapted to the level of\r\nthe style of argument it answers.\r\n\r\n_Les races se féminisent_, said Buffon,--\"The world is growing more\r\nfeminine.\" It is a compliment, whether the naturalist intended it or\r\nnot. Time has brought peace; peace, invention; and the poorest woman of\r\nto-day is born to an inheritance such as her ancestors never dreamed of.\r\nPrevious attempts to confer on women social and political equality,--as\r\nwhen Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, made them magistrates, or when the\r\nHungarian revolutionists made them voters, or when our own New Jersey\r\ntried the same experiment, in a guarded fashion, in early times, and\r\nthen revoked the privilege, because (as in the ancient fable) the women\r\nvoted the wrong way,--these things were premature, and valuable only as\r\nconcessions to a supposed principle. But in view of the rapid changes\r\nnow going on, he is a rash man who asserts the \"Woman Question\" to be\r\nanything but a mere question of time. The fulcrum has been already\r\ngiven, in the alphabet, and we must simply watch and see whether the\r\nearth does not move.\r\n\r\nIn this present treatment of the subject, we have been more anxious to\r\nassert broad principles than to work them out into the details of their\r\napplication. We only point out the plain fact: woman must be either\r\na subject or an equal; there is no other permanent ground. Every\r\nconcession to a supposed principle only involves the necessity of the\r\nnext concession for which that principle calls. Once yield the alphabet,\r\nand we abandon the whole long theory of subjection and coverture; the\r\npast is set aside, and we have nothing but abstractions to fall back\r\nupon. Reasoning abstractly, it must be admitted that the argument has\r\nbeen, thus far, entirely on the women's side, inasmuch as no man has yet\r\nseriously tried to meet them with argument. It is an alarming feature of\r\nthis discussion, that it has reversed, very generally, the traditional\r\npositions of the sexes: the women have had all the logic; and the most\r\nintelligent men, when they have attempted the other side, have limited\r\nthemselves to satire and gossip. What rational woman, we ask, can be\r\nconvinced by the nonsense which is talked in ordinary society around\r\nher,--as, that it is right to admit girls to common schools, and equally\r\nright to exclude them from colleges,--that it is proper for a woman\r\nto sing in public, but indelicate for her to speak in public,--that a\r\npost-office box is an unexceptionable place to drop a bit of paper into,\r\nbut a ballot-box terribly dangerous? No cause in the world can keep\r\nabove water, sustained by such contradictions as these, too feeble and\r\nslight to be dignified by the name of fallacies. Some persons profess to\r\nthink it impossible to reason with a woman, and they certainly show no\r\ndisposition to try the experiment.\r\n\r\nBut we must remember that all our American institutions are based on\r\nconsistency, or on nothing; all claim to be founded on the principles of\r\nnatural right, and when they quit those, they are lost. In all European\r\nmonarchies, it is the theory, that the mass of the people are children,\r\nto be governed, not mature beings, to govern themselves. This is clearly\r\nstated, and consistently applied. In the free states of this Union, we\r\nhave formally abandoned this theory for one half of the human race,\r\nwhile for the other half it still flourishes in full force. The moment\r\nthe claims of woman are broached, the democrat becomes a monarchist.\r\nWhat Americans commonly criticize in English statesmen, namely, that\r\nthey habitually evade all arguments based on natural right, and defend\r\nevery legal wrong on the ground that it works well in practice, is the\r\nprecise characteristic of our habitual view of woman. The perplexity\r\nmust be resolved somehow. We seldom meet a legislator who pretends to\r\ndeny that strict adherence to our own principles would place both sexes\r\nin precisely equal positions before law and constitution, as well as in\r\nschool and society. But each has his special quibble to apply, showing\r\nthat in this case we must abandon all the general maxims to which we\r\nhave pledged ourselves, and hold only by precedent. Nay, he construes\r\neven precedent with the most ingenious rigor; since the exclusion of\r\nwomen from all direct contact with affairs can be made far more perfect\r\nin a republic than is possible in a monarchy, where even sex is merged\r\nin rank, and the female patrician may have far more power than the male\r\nplebeian. But, as matters now stand among us, there is no aristocracy\r\nbut of sex: all men are born patrician, all women are legally plebeian;\r\nall men are equal in having political power, and all women in having\r\nnone. This is a paradox so evident, and such an anomaly in human\r\nprogress, that it cannot last forever, without new discoveries in logic,\r\nor else a deliberate return to M. Maréchal's theory concerning the\r\nalphabet.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as the newspapers say, we anxiously await further\r\ndevelopments. According to present appearances, the final adjustment\r\nlies mainly in the hands of women themselves. Men can hardly be expected\r\nto concede either rights or privileges more rapidly than they are\r\nclaimed, or to be truer to women than women are to each other. True, the\r\nworst effect of a condition of inferiority is the weakness it leaves\r\nbehind it; even when we say, \"Hands off!\" the sufferer does not rise.\r\nIn such a case, there is but one counsel worth giving. More depends on\r\ndetermination than even on ability. Will, not talent, governs the world.\r\nFrom what pathway of eminence were women more traditionally excluded\r\nthan from the art of sculpture, in spite of _Non me Praxiteles fecit,\r\nsed Anna Damer?_--yet Harriet Hosmer, in eight years, has trod its full\r\nascent. Who believed that a poetess could ever be more than an Annot\r\nLyle of the harp, to soothe with sweet melodies the leisure of her lord,\r\nuntil in Elizabeth Barrett's hands the thing became a trumpet? Where\r\nare gone the sneers with which army surgeons and parliamentary orators\r\nopposed Mr. Sidney Herbert's first proposition to send Florence\r\nNightingale to the Crimea? In how many towns has the current of popular\r\nprejuduce against female orators been reversed by one winning speech\r\nfrom Lucy Stone! Where no logic can prevail, success silences. First\r\ngive woman, if you dare, the alphabet, then summon her to her career;\r\nand though men, ignorant and prejudiced, may oppose its beginnings,\r\nthere is no danger but they will at last fling around her conquering\r\nfootsteps more lavish praises than ever greeted the opera's idol,--more\r\nperfumed flowers than ever wooed, with intoxicating fragrance, the\r\nfairest butterfly of the ball-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I walk alone the Morning Street,\r\n  Filled with the silence strange and sweet:\r\n  All seems as lone, as still, as dead,\r\n  As if unnumbered years had fled,\r\n  Letting the noisy Babel be\r\n  Without a breath, a memory.\r\n  The light wind walks with me, alone,\r\n  Where the hot day like flame was blown;\r\n  Where the wheels roared and dust was beat,\r\n  The dew is in the Morning Street.\r\n\r\n  Where are the restless throngs that pour\r\n  Along this mighty corridor\r\n  While the noon flames? the hurrying crowd\r\n  Whose footsteps make the city loud?\r\n  The myriad faces? hearts that beat\r\n  No more in the deserted street?--\r\n  Those footsteps, in their dream-land maze,\r\n  Cross thresholds of forgotten days;\r\n  Those faces brighten from the years\r\n  In morning suns long set in tears;\r\n  Those hearts--far in the Past they beat--\r\n  Are singing in _their_ Morning Street.\r\n\r\n  A city 'gainst the world's gray Prime,\r\n  Lost in some desert, far from Time,\r\n  Where noiseless Ages, gliding through,\r\n  Have only sifted sands and dew,\r\n  Were not more lone to one who first\r\n  Upon its giant silence burst,\r\n  Than this strange quiet, where the tide\r\n  Of life, upheaved on either side,\r\n  Hangs trembling, ready soon to beat\r\n  With human waves the Morning Street.\r\n\r\n  Ay, soon the glowing morning flood\r\n  Pours through this charmèd solitude;\r\n  All silent now, this Memnon-stone\r\n  Will murmur to the rising sun;\r\n  The busy life this vein shall beat,--\r\n  The rush of wheels, the swarm of feet;\r\n  The Arachne-threads of Purpose stream\r\n  Unseen within the morning gleam;\r\n  The Life will move, the Death be plain;\r\n  The bridal throng, the funeral train,\r\n  Together in the crowd will meet,\r\n  And pass along the Morning Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN A CELLAR\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the day of Madame de St. Cyr's dinner, an event I never missed;\r\nfor, the mistress of a mansion in the Faubourg St. Germain, there still\r\nlingered about her the exquisite grace and good-breeding peculiar to the\r\nold _régime_, that insensibly communicates itself to the guests till\r\nthey move in an atmosphere of ease that constitutes the charm of home.\r\nOne was always sure of meeting desirable and well-assorted people here,\r\nand a _contre-temps_ was impossible. Moreover, the house was not at the\r\ncommand of all; and Madame de St. Cyr, with the daring strength which,\r\nwhen found in a woman at all, should, to be endurable, be combined with\r\na sweet but firm restraint, rode rough-shod over the _parvenus_ of the\r\nEmpire, and was resolute enough to insulate herself even among the old\r\n_noblesse_, who, as all the world knows, insulate themselves from the\r\nrest of France. There were rare qualities in this woman, and were I to\r\nhave selected one who with an even hand should carry a snuffy candle\r\nthrough a magazine of powder, my choice would have devolved upon her;\r\nand she would have done it.\r\n\r\nI often looked, and not unsuccessfully, to discern what heritage her\r\ndaughter had in these little affairs. Indeed, to one like myself\r\nDelphine presented the worthier study. She wanted the airy charm of\r\nmanner, the suavity and tenderness of her mother,--a deficiency easily\r\nto be pardoned in one of such delicate and extraordinary beauty. And\r\nperhaps her face was the truest index of her mind; not that it ever\r\ntransparently displayed a genuine emotion,--Delphine was too well-bred\r\nfor that,--but the outline of her features had a keen, regular\r\nprecision, as if cut in a gem. Her exquisite color seldom varied, her\r\neyes were like blue steel, she was statue-like and stony. But had one\r\npaused there, pronouncing her hard and impassive, he had committed an\r\nerror. She had no great capability for passion, but she was not to be\r\ndeceived; one metallic flash of her eye would cut like a sword through\r\nthe whole mesh of entanglements with which you had surrounded her; and\r\nfrequently, when alone with her, you perceived cool recesses in her\r\nnature, sparkling and pleasant, which jealously guarded themselves from\r\na nearer approach. She was infinitely _spirituelle_; compared to her,\r\nMadame herself was heavy.\r\n\r\nAt the first I had seen that Delphine must be the wife of a diplomate.\r\nWhat diplomate? For a time asking myself the question seriously, I\r\ndecided in the negative, which did not, however, prevent Delphine from\r\nfulfilling her destiny, since there were others. She was, after all,\r\nlike a draught of rich old wine, all fire and sweetness. These things\r\nwere not generally seen in her; I was more favored than many; and I\r\nlooked at her with pitiless perspicacious eyes. Nevertheless, I had not\r\nthe least advantage; it was, in fact, between us, diamond cut diamond,\r\n--which, oddly enough, brings me back to my story.\r\n\r\nSome years previously, I had been sent on a special mission to the\r\ngovernment at Paris, and having finally executed it, I resigned the\r\npost, and resolved to make my residence there, since it is the only\r\nplace on earth where one can live. Every morning I half expect to see\r\nthe country, beyond the city, white with an encampment of the nations,\r\nwho, having peacefully flocked there over night, wait till the Rue St.\r\nHonoré shall run out and greet them. It surprises me, sometimes, that\r\nthose pretending to civilization are content to remain at a distance.\r\nWhat experience have they of life,--not to mention gayety and pleasure,\r\nbut of the great purpose of life,--society? Man evidently is gregarious;\r\nFourier's fables are founded on fact; we are nothing without our\r\nopposites, our fellows, our lights and shadows, colors, relations,\r\ncombinations, our _point d'appui_, and our angle of sight. An isolated\r\nman is immensurable; he is also unpicturesque, unnatural, untrue. He is\r\nno longer the lord of Nature, animal and vegetable,--but Nature is the\r\nlord of him; the trees, skies, flowers, predominate, and he is in as bad\r\ntaste as green and blue, or as an oyster in a vase of roses. The race\r\nswings naturally to clusters. It being admitted, then, that society is\r\nour normal state, where is it to be obtained in such perfection as at\r\nParis? Show me the urbanity, the generosity in trifles, better than\r\nsacrifice, the incuriousness and freedom, the grace, and wit, and honor,\r\nthat will equal such as I find here. Morality,--we were not speaking\r\nof it,--the intrusion is unnecessary; must that word with Anglo-Saxon\r\npertinacity dog us round the world? A hollow mask, which Vice now and\r\nthen lifts for a breath of air, I grant you this state may be called;\r\nbut since I find the vice elsewhere, countenance my preference for the\r\naccompanying mask. But even this is vanishing; such drawing-rooms as\r\nMme. de St. Cyr's are less and less frequent. Yet, though the delightful\r\nspell of the last century daily dissipates itself, and we are not now\r\nwhat we were twenty years ago, still Paris is, and will be till the end\r\nof time, for a cosmopolitan, the pivot on which the world revolves.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, as I have said, the day of Mme. de St. Cyr's dinner.\r\nPunctually at the hour, I presented myself,--for I have always esteemed\r\nit the least courtesy which a guest can render, that he should not cool\r\nhis hostess's dinner.\r\n\r\nThe usual choice company waited. There was the Marquis of G., the\r\nambassador from home, Col. Leigh, an attaché of that embassy, the\r\nSpanish and Belgian ministers,--all of whom, with myself, completed a\r\ndiplomatic circle. There were also wits and artists, but no ladies whose\r\nbeauty exceeded that of the St. Cyrs. With nearly all of this assemblage\r\nI held certain relations, so that I was immediately at ease--G. was the\r\nonly one whom, perhaps, I would rather not have met, although we were\r\nthe best of friends. They awaited but one, the Baron Stahl. Meanwhile\r\nDelphine stood coolly taking the measurement of the Marquis of G., while\r\nher mother entertained one and another guest with a low-toned flattery,\r\ngentle interest, or lively narration, as the case might demand.\r\n\r\nIn a country where a _coup d'état_ was as easily given as a box on the\r\near, we all attentively watched for the arrival of one who had been sent\r\nfrom a neighboring empire to negotiate a loan for the tottering throne\r\nof this. Nor was expectation kept long on guard. In a moment, \"His\r\nExcellency, the Baron Stahl!\" was announced.\r\n\r\nThe exaggeration of his low bow to Mme. de St. Cyr, the gleam askance of\r\nhis black eye, the absurd simplicity of his dress, did not particularly\r\nplease me. A low forehead, straight black brows, a beardless cheek with\r\na fine color which gave him a fictitiously youthful appearance, were the\r\nmost striking traits of his face; his person was not to be found fault\r\nwith; but he boldly evinced his admiration for Delphine, and with a\r\nwicked eye.\r\n\r\nAs we were introduced, he assured me, in pure English, that he had\r\npleasure in making the acquaintance of a gentleman whose services were\r\nso distinguished.\r\n\r\nI, in turn, assured him of my pleasure in meeting a gentleman who\r\nappreciated them.\r\n\r\nI had arrived at the house of Mme. de St. Cyr with a load on my mind,\r\nwhich for four weeks had weighed there; but before I thus spoke, it\r\nwas lifted and gone. I had seen the Baron Stahl before, although not\r\npreviously aware of it; and now, as he bowed, talked my native tongue so\r\nsmoothly, drew a glove over the handsome hand upon whose first finger\r\nshone the only incongruity of his attire, a broad gold ring, holding a\r\ngaudy red stone,--as he stood smiling and expectant before me, a sudden\r\nchain of events flashed through my mind, an instantaneous heat, like\r\nlightning, welded them into logic. A great problem was resolved. For a\r\nsecond, the breath seemed snatched from my lips; the next, a lighter,\r\nfreer man never trod in diplomatic shoes.\r\n\r\nI really beg your pardon,--but perhaps from long usage, it has become\r\nimpossible for me to tell a straight story. It is absolutely necessary\r\nto inform you of events already transpired.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, I, at this time, possessed a valet, the pink\r\nof valets, an Englishman,--and not the less valuable to me in a foreign\r\ncapital, that, notwithstanding his long residence, he was utterly\r\nunable to speak one word of French intelligibly. Reading and writing\r\nit readily, his thick tongue could master scarcely a syllable. The\r\nadroitness and perfection with which he performed the duties of his\r\nplace were unsurpassable. To a certain extent I was obliged to admit him\r\ninto my confidence; I was not at all in his. In dexterity and dispatch\r\nhe equalled the advertisements. He never condescended to don my cast-off\r\napparel, but, disposing of it, always arrayed himself in plain\r\nbut gentlemanly garments. These do not complete the list of Hay's\r\ncapabilities. He speculated. Respectable tenements in London called\r\nhim landlord; in the funds certain sums lay subject to his order; to a\r\nprofitable farm in Hants he contemplated future retirement; and passing\r\nupon the Bourse, I have received a grave bow, and have left him in\r\nconversation with an eminent capitalist respecting consols, drafts,\r\nexchange, and other erudite mysteries, where I yet find myself in the\r\nA B C. Thus not only was my valet a free-born Briton, but a landed\r\nproprietor. If the Rothschilds blacked your boots or shaved your chin,\r\nyour emotions might be akin to mine. When this man, who had an interest\r\nin the India traders, brought the hot water into my dressing-room, of a\r\nmorning, the Antipodes were tributary to me; to what extent might any\r\nlittle irascibility of mine drive a depression in the market! and I\r\nknew, as he brushed my hat, whether stocks rose or fell. In one respect,\r\nI was essentially like our Saxon ancestors,--my servant was a villain.\r\nIf I had been merely a civilian, in any purely private capacity, having\r\nleisure to attend to personal concerns in the midst of the delicate\r\nspecialties intrusted to me from the cabinet at home, the possession of\r\nso inestimable a valet might have bullied me beyond endurance. As it\r\nwas, I found it rather agreeable than otherwise. He was tacitly my\r\nsecretary of finance.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, a diamond of wonderful size and beauty, having\r\nwandered from the East, fell into certain imperial coffers among\r\nour Continental neighbors; and at the same time some extraordinary\r\nintelligence, essential to the existence, so to speak, of that\r\ngovernment, reached a person there who fixed as its price this diamond.\r\nAfter a while he obtained it, but, judging that prudence lay in\r\ndeparture, took it to England, where it was purchased for an enormous\r\nsum by the Duke of ----, as he will remain an unknown quantity, let\r\nus say X. There are probably not a dozen such diamonds in the\r\nworld,--certainly not three in England. It rejoiced in such flowery\r\nappellatives as the Sea of Splendor, the Moon of Milk; and, of course,\r\nthose who had been scarcely better than jewed out of it were determined\r\nto obtain it again at all hazards;--they were never famous for\r\nscrupulosity. The Duke of X. was aware of this, and, for a time, the gem\r\nhad lain idle, its glory muffled in a casket; but finally, on some grand\r\noccasion, a few months prior to the period of which I have spoken above,\r\nit was determined to set it in the Duchess's coronet. Accordingly, one\r\nday, it was given by her son, the Marquis of G., into the hands of their\r\nsolicitor, who should deliver it to her Grace's jeweller. It lay in a\r\nsmall shagreen case, and, before the Marquis left, the solicitor placed\r\nthe case in a flat leathern box, where lay a chain of most singular\r\nworkmanship, the clasp of which was deranged. This chain was very broad,\r\nof a style known as the brick-work, but every brick was a tiny gem, set\r\nin a delicate filigree linked with the next, and the whole rainbowed\r\nlustrousness moving at your will, like the scales of some gorgeous\r\nEgyptian serpent:--the solicitor was to take this also to the jeweller.\r\nHaving laid the box in his private desk, Ulster, his confidential clerk,\r\nlocked it, while he bowed the Marquis down. Returning immediately, the\r\nsolicitor took the flat box and drove to the jeweller's. He found the\r\nlatter so crowded with customers, it being the fashionable hour, as to\r\nbe unable to attend to him; he, however, took the solicitor into his\r\ninner room, a dark fire-proof place, and there quickly deposited the box\r\nwithin a safe, which stood inside another, like a Japanese puzzle, and\r\nthe solicitor, seeing the doors double-locked and secured, departed; the\r\nother promising to attend to the matter on the morrow.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, the jeweller entered his dark room, and\r\nproceeded to unlock the safe. This being concluded, and the inner one\r\nalso thrown open, he found the box in a last and entirely, as he had\r\nalways believed, secret compartment. Anxious to see this wonder, this\r\nEye of Morning, and Heart of Day, he eagerly loosened the band and\r\nunclosed the box. It was empty. There was no chain there; the diamond\r\nwas missing. The sweat streamed from his forehead, his clothes were\r\nsaturated, he believed himself the victim of a delusion. Calling an\r\nassistant, every article and nook in the dark room was examined. At\r\nlast, in an extremity of despair, he sent for the solicitor, who arrived\r\nin a breath. The jeweller's alarm hardly equalled that of the other.\r\nIn his sudden dismay, he at first forgot the circumstances and dates\r\nrelating to the affair; afterward was doubtful. The Marquis of G. was\r\nsummoned, the police called in, the jeweller given into custody. Every\r\nbreath the solicitor continued to draw only built up his ruin. He\r\nswallowed laudanum, but, by making it an overdose, frustrated his own\r\ndesign. He was assured, on his recovery, that no suspicion attached to\r\nhim. The jeweller now asseverated that the diamond had never been\r\ngiven to him; but though this was strictly true, the jeweller had,\r\nnevertheless, committed perjury. Of course, whoever had the stone would\r\nnot attempt to dispose of it at present, and, though communications were\r\nopened with the general European police, there was very little to work\r\nupon. But by means of this last step the former possessors became aware\r\nof its loss, and I make no doubt had their agents abroad immediately.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the case hung here, complicated and tantalizing, when one\r\nmorning I woke in London. No sooner had G. heard of my arrival than he\r\ncalled, and, relating the affair, requested my assistance. I confess\r\nmyself to have been interested,--foolishly so, I thought afterward; but\r\nwe all have our weaknesses, and diamonds were mine. In company with the\r\nMarquis, I waited upon the solicitor, who entered into the few details\r\nminutely, calling frequently upon Ulster, a young fresh-looking man, for\r\ncorroboration. We then drove to the jeweller's new quarters, took\r\nhim, under charge of the officers, to his place of business, where he\r\nnervously showed me every point that could bear upon the subject, and\r\nended by exclaiming, that he was ruined, and all for a stone he had\r\nnever seen. I sat quietly for a few moments. It stood, then, thus:--G.\r\nhad given the thing to the solicitor, seen it put into the box, seen the\r\nbox put into the desk; but while the confidential clerk, Ulster, locked\r\nthe desk, the solicitor saw the Marquis to the door,--returning, took\r\nthe box, without opening it again, to the jeweller, who, in the hurry,\r\nshut it up in his safe, also without opening it. The case was perfectly\r\nclear. These mysterious things are always so simple! You know now, as\r\nwell as I, who took the diamond.\r\n\r\nI did not choose to volunteer, but assented, on being desired. The\r\npolice and I were old friends; they had so often assisted me, that I was\r\nnot afraid to pay them in kind, and accordingly agreed to take charge of\r\nthe case, still retaining their aid, should I require it. The jeweller\r\nwas now restored to his occupation, although still subjected to a rigid\r\nsurveillance, and I instituted inquiries into the recent movements of\r\nthe young man Ulster. The case seemed to me to have been very blindly\r\nconducted. But, though all that was brought to light concerning him in\r\nLondon was perfectly fair and aboveboard, it was discovered that not\r\nlong since he had visited Paris,--on the solicitor's business, of\r\ncourse, but gaining thereby an opportunity to transact any little\r\naffairs of his own. This was fortunate; for if any one could do anything\r\nin Paris, it was myself.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that I act as a detective. But one homogeneous to every\r\nsituation could hardly play a pleasanter part for once. I have thought\r\nthat our great masters in theory and practice, Machiavel and Talleyrand,\r\nwere hardly more, on a large scale.\r\n\r\nI was about to return to Paris, but resolved to call previously on the\r\nsolicitor again. He welcomed me warmly, although my suspicions had not\r\nbeen imparted to him, and, with a more cheerful heart than had lately\r\nbeen habitual to him, entered into an animated conversation respecting\r\nthe great case of Biter _v._ Bit, then absorbing so much of the public\r\nattention, frequently addressing Ulster, whose remarks were always\r\npertinent, brief, and clear. As I sat actively discussing the topic,\r\nfeeling no more interest in it than in the end of that cigar I just cut\r\noff, and noting exactly every look and motion of the unfortunate youth,\r\nI recollect the curious sentiment that filled me regarding him. What\r\ninjury had he done me, that I should pursue him with punishment? Me? I\r\nam, and every individual is, integral with the commonwealth. It was\r\nthe commonwealth he had injured. Yet, even then, why was I the one to\r\nadminister justice? Why not continue with my coffee in the morning, my\r\nkings and cabinets and national chess at noon, my opera at night, and\r\nlet the poor devil go? Why, but that justice is brought home to every\r\nmember of society,--that naked duty requires no shirking of such\r\nresponsibility,--that, had I failed here, the crime might, with reason,\r\nlie at my door and multiply, the criminal increase himself?\r\n\r\nVery possibly you will not unite with me; but these little catechisms\r\nare, once in a while, indispensable, to vindicate one's course to\r\none's-self.\r\n\r\nThis Ulster was a handsome youth;--the rogues have generally all\r\nthe good looks. There was nothing else remarkable about him but his\r\nquickness; he was perpetually on the alert; by constant activity, the\r\nrust was never allowed to collect on his faculties; his sharpness was\r\ndistressing,--he appeared subject to a tense strain. Now his quill\r\nscratched over the paper unconcernedly, while he could join as easily in\r\nhis master's conversation; nothing seemed to preoccupy him, or he held\r\na mind open at every point. It is pitiful to remember him that morning,\r\nsitting quiet, unconscious, and free, utterly in the hands of that\r\nmighty Inquisition, the Metropolitan Police, with its countless arms,\r\nits cells and myrmidons in the remotest corners of the Continent, at the\r\nmercy of so merciless a monster, and momently closer involved, like some\r\npoor prey round which a spider spins its bewildering web. It was also\r\ncurious to observe the sudden suspicion that darkened his face at some\r\ninnocent remark,--the quick shrinking and intrenched retirement, the\r\nmanifest sting and rancor, as I touched his wound with a swift flash\r\nof my slender weapon and sheathed it again, and, after the thrust,\r\nthe espionage, and the relief at believing it accidental. He had many\r\nthreads to gather up and hold;--little electric warnings along them must\r\nhave been constantly shocking him. He did that part well enough; it was\r\na mistake, to begin with; he needed prudence. At that time I owed this\r\nUlster nothing; now, however, I owe him a grudge, for some of the most\r\nharassing hours of my life were occasioned me by him. But I shall not\r\ncherish enmity on that account. With so promising a beginning, he will\r\ngraduate and take his degree from the loftiest altitude in his line.\r\nHemp is a narcotic; let it bring me forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nIn Paris I found it not difficult to trace such a person, since he was\r\nboth foreign and unaccustomed. It was ascertained that he had posted\r\nseveral letters. A person of his description had been seen to drop a\r\nletter, the superscription of which had been read by the one who picked\r\nit up for him. This superscription was the address of the very person\r\nwho was likely to be the agent of the former possessors of the diamond,\r\nand had attracted attention. After all,--you know the Secret Force,--it\r\nwas not so impossible to imagine what this letter contained, despite\r\nof its cipher. Such a person also had been met among the Jews, and at\r\ncertain shops whose reputation was not of the clearest. He had called\r\nonce or twice on Mme. de St. Cyr, on business relative to a vineyard\r\nadjoining her château in the Gironde, which she had sold to a\r\nwine-merchant of England. I found a zest in the affair, as I pursued it.\r\n\r\nWe were now fairly at sea, but before long I found we were likely to\r\nremain there; in fact, nothing of consequence eventuated. I began to\r\nregret having taken the affair from the hands in which I had found it,\r\nand one day, it being a gala or some insatiable saint's day, I was\r\nriding, perplexed with that and other matters, and paying small\r\nattention to the passing crowd. I was vexed and mortified, and had fully\r\ndecided to throw up the whole,--on such hairs do things hang,--when,\r\nsuddenly turning a corner, my bridle-reins became entangled in the\r\nsnaffle of another rider. I loosened them abstractedly, and not till it\r\nwas necessary to bow to my strange antagonist, on parting, did I glance\r\nup. The person before me was evidently not accustomed to play the dandy;\r\nhe wore his clothes ill, sat his horse worse, and was uneasy in the\r\nsaddle. The unmistakable air of the _gamin_ was apparent beneath the\r\nsuperficies of the gentleman. Conspicuous on his costume, and wound like\r\nan order of merit upon his breast, glittered a chain, _the_ chain,--each\r\ntiny brick-like gem spiked with a hundred sparks, and building a fabric\r\nof sturdy probabilities with the celerity of the genii in constructing\r\nAladdin's palace. There, a cable to haul up the treasure, was the\r\nchain;--where was the diamond? I need not tell you how I followed this\r\nyoung friend, with what assiduity I kept him in sight, up and down, all\r\nday long, till, weary at last of his fine sport, as I certainly was of\r\nmine, he left his steed in stall and fared on his way a-foot. Still\r\npursuing, now I threaded quay and square, street and alley, till he\r\ndisappeared in a small shop, in one of those dark crowded lanes leading\r\neastward from the Pont Neuf, in the city. It was the sign of a _marchand\r\ndes armures_, and, having provided myself with those persuasive\r\narguments, a _sergent-de-ville_ and a _gendarme_, I entered.\r\n\r\nA place more characteristic it would be impossible to find. Here were\r\npiled bows of every material, ash, and horn, and tougher fibres, with\r\nslackened strings, and among them peered a rusty clarion and battle-axe,\r\nwhile the quivers that should have accompanied lay in a distant corner,\r\ntheir arrows serving to pin long, dusty, torn banners to the wall.\r\nOpposite the entrance, an archer in bronze hung on tiptoe, and levelled\r\na steel bow, whose piercing _flèche_ seemed sparkling with impatience to\r\nspring from his finger and flesh itself in the heart of the intruder.\r\nThe hauberk and halberd, lance and casque, arquebuse and sword, were\r\nsuspended in friendly congeries; and fragments of costly stuff swept\r\nfrom ceiling to floor, crushed and soiled by the heaps of rusty\r\nfirelocks, cutlasses, and gauntlets thrown upon them. In one place, a\r\nlittle antique bust was half hid in the folds of some pennon, still\r\ndyed with battle-stains; in another, scattered treasures of Dresden\r\nand Sèvres brought the drawing-room into the campaign; and all around\r\nbivouacked rifles, whose polished barrels glittered full of death,--\r\npistols, variously mounted, for an insurgent at the barricades, or for\r\na lost millionnaire at the gaming-table,--foils, with buttoned\r\nbluntness,--and rapiers, whose even edges were viewless, as if filed\r\ninto air. Destruction lay everywhere, at the command of the owner of\r\nthis place, and, had he possessed a particle of vivacity, it would have\r\nbeen hazardous to bow beneath his doorway. It did not, I must say, look\r\nlike a place where I should find a diamond. As the owner came forward, I\r\ndetermined on my plan of action.\r\n\r\n\"You have, Sir,\" I said, handing him a bit of paper, on which were\r\nscrawled some numbers, \"a diamond in your possession, of such and so\r\nmany carats, size, and value, belonging to the Duke of X., and left with\r\nyou by an Englishman, Mr. Arthur Ulster. You will deliver it to me, if\r\nyou please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur!\" exclaimed the man, lifting his hands, and surveying me with\r\nthe widest eyes I ever saw. \"A diamond! In my possession! So immense a\r\nthing! It is impossible. I have not even seen one of the kind. It is a\r\nmistake. Jacques Noailles, the vender of jewels _en gros_, second door\r\nbelow, must be the man. One should perceive that my business is with\r\narms, not diamonds. I have it not; it would ruin me.\"\r\n\r\nHere he paused for a reply, but, meeting none, resumed. \"M. Arthur\r\nUlster!--I have heard of no such person. I never spoke with an\r\nEnglishman. Bah! I detest them! I have no dealings with them. I repeat,\r\nI have not your jewel. Do you wish anything more of me?\"\r\n\r\nHis vehemence only convinced me of the truth of my suspicions.\r\n\r\n\"These heroics are out of place,\" I answered. \"I demand the article in\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur doubts me?\" he asked, with a rueful face,--\"questions my\r\nword, which is incontrovertible?\" Here he clapped his hand upon a\r\n_couteau-de-chasse_ lying near, but, appearing to think better of it,\r\ndrew himself up, and, with a shower of nods flung at me, added, \"I deny\r\nyour accusation!\" I had not accused him.\r\n\r\n\"You are at too much pains to convict yourself. I charge you with\r\nnothing,\" I said. \"But this diamond must be surrendered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur is mad!\" he exclaimed, \"mad! he dreams! Do I look like one who\r\npossesses such a trophy? Does my shop resemble a mine? Look about!\r\nSee! All that is here would not bring a hundredth part of its price. I\r\nbeseech Monsieur to believe me; he has mistaken the number, or has been\r\nmisinformed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We waste words. I know this diamond is here, as well as a costly\r\nchain\"--\r\n\r\n\"On my soul, on my life, on my honor,\" he cried, clasping his hands and\r\nturning up his eyes, \"there is here nothing of the kind. I do not deal\r\nin gems. A little silk, a few weapons, a curiosity, a nicknack, comprise\r\nmy stock. I have not the diamond. I do not know the thing. I am poor. I\r\nam honest. Suspicion destroys me!\"\r\n\r\n\"As you will find, should I be longer troubled by your denials.\"\r\n\r\nHe was inflexible, and, having exhausted every artifice of innocence,\r\nwiped the tears from his eyes,--oh, these French! life is their\r\ntheatre,--and remained quiet. It was getting dark. There was no gas in\r\nthe place; but in the pause a distant street-lamp swung its light dimly\r\nround.\r\n\r\n\"Unless one desires to purchase, allow me to say that it is my hour for\r\nclosing,\" he remarked, blandly, rubbing his black-bearded chin.\r\n\r\n\"My time is valuable,\" I returned. \"It is late and dark. When your\r\nshop-boy lights up\"----\r\n\r\n\"Pardon,--we do not light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me, then, to perform that office for you. In this blaze you may\r\nperceive my companions, whom you have not appeared to recognize.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, I scratched a match upon the floor, and, as the\r\n_sergent-de-ville_ and the _gendarme_ advanced, threw the light of the\r\nblue spirt of sulphurous flame upon them. In a moment more the match\r\nwent out, and we remained in the demi-twilight of the distant lantern.\r\nThe _marchand des armures_ stood petrified and aghast. Had he seen the\r\nimps of Satan in that instant, it could have had no greater effect.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen them?\" I asked. \"I regret to inconvenience you; but\r\nunless this diamond is produced at once, my friends will put their seal\r\non your goods, your property will be confiscated, yourself in a dungeon.\r\nIn other words, I allow you five minutes; at the close of that time you\r\nwill have chosen between restitution and ruin.\"\r\n\r\nHe remained apparently lost in thought. He was a big, stout man, and\r\nwith one blow of his powerful fist could easily have settled me. It was\r\nthe last thing in his mind. At length he lifted his head,--\"Rosalie!\"\r\nhe called.\r\n\r\nAt the word, a light foot pattered along a stone floor within, and in a\r\nmoment a little woman stood in an arch raised by two steps from our own\r\nlevel. Carrying a candle, she descended and tripped toward him. She was\r\nnot pretty, but sprightly and keen, as the perpetual attrition of life\r\nmust needs make her, and wore the everlasting grisette costume, which\r\ndisplays the neatest of ankles, and whose cap is more becoming than\r\nwreaths of garden millinery. I am too minute, I see, but it is second\r\nnature. The two commenced a vigorous whispering amid sundry gestures and\r\nglances. Suddenly the woman turned, and, laying the prettiest of little\r\nhands on my sleeve, said, with a winning smile,--\r\n\r\n\"Is it a crime of _lèse-majesté_?\"\r\n\r\nThis was a new idea, but might be useful.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" I said; \"two minutes more, and I will not answer for the\r\nconsequence.\"\r\n\r\nOther whispers ensued.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the man, leaning on one arm over the counter, and\r\nlooking up in my face, with the most engaging frankness,--\"it is true\r\nthat I have such a diamond; but it is not mine. It is left with me to be\r\ndelivered to the Baron Stahl, who comes as an agent from his court for\r\nits purchase.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,--I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was to have paid me half a million francs,--not half its worth,--in\r\ntrust for the person who left it, who is not M. Arthur Ulster, but Mme.\r\nde St. Cyr.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de St. Cyr! How under the sun----No,--it could not be possible.\r\nThe case stood as it stood before. The rogue was in deeper water than I\r\nhad thought; he had merely employed Mme. de St. Cyr. I ran this over in\r\nmy mind, while I said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Sir,\" I continued, \"you will state the terms of this transaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure. For my trouble I was myself to receive patronage and\r\nfive thousand francs. The Baron is to be here directly, on other and\r\npublic business. _Reine du ciel_, Monsieur! how shall I meet him?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is powerless in Paris; your fear is idle.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. There were no other terms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady thought it safest to be without them. She took merely my\r\nreceipt, which the Baron Stahl will bring to me from her before\r\nreceiving this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will trouble you for it now.\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed and shuffled away. At a glance from me, the _gendarme_ slipped\r\nto the rear of the building, where three others were stationed at the\r\ntwo exits in that direction, to caution them of the critical moment, and\r\nreturned. Ten minutes passed,--the merchant did not appear. If, after\r\nall, he had made off with it! There had been the click of a bolt, the\r\nhalf-stifled rattle of arms, as if a door had been opened and rapidly\r\nclosed again, but nothing more.\r\n\r\n\"I will see what detains my friend,\" said Mademoiselle, the little\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nWe suffered her to withdraw. In a moment more a quick expostulation was\r\nto be heard.\r\n\r\n\"They are there, the _gendarmes_, my little one! I should have run,\r\nbut they caught me, the villains! and replaced me in the house. _Oh,\r\nsacre!_\"--and rolling this word between his teeth, he came down and laid\r\na little box on the counter. I opened it. There was within a large,\r\nglittering, curiously-cut piece of glass. I threw it aside.\r\n\r\n\"The diamond!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur had it,\" he replied, stooping to pick up the glass with every\r\nappearance of surprise and care.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say you endeavored to escape with that bawble? Produce\r\nthe diamond instantly, or you shall hang as high as Haman!\" I roared.\r\n\r\nWhether he knew the individual in question or not, the threat was\r\nefficient; he trembled and hesitated, and finally drew the identical\r\nshagreen case from his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"I but jested,\" he said. \"Monsieur will witness that I relinquish it\r\nwith reluctance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will witness that you receive stolen goods!\" I cried, in wrath.\r\n\r\nHe placed it in my hands.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he groaned, from the bottom of his heart, hanging his head, and\r\nlaying both hands on the counter before him,--\"it pains, it grieves me\r\nto part with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the chain,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur did not demand that!\"\r\n\r\n\"I demand it now.\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment, the chain also was given me.\r\n\r\n\"And now will Monsieur do me a favor? Will he inform me by what means he\r\nascertained these facts?\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at the _garçon_, who had probably supplied himself with\r\nhis master's finery illicitly;--he was the means;--we have some\r\ngenerosity;--I thought I should prefer doing him the favor, and\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nI unclasped the shagreen case; the _sergent-de-ville_ and the _gendarme_\r\nstole up and looked over my shoulder; the _garçon_ drew near with round\r\neyes; the little woman peeped across; the merchant, with tears streaming\r\nover his face, gazed as if it had been a loadstone; finally, I looked\r\nmyself. There it lay, the glowing, resplendent thing! flashing in\r\naffluence of splendor, throbbing and palpitant with life, drawing all\r\nthe light from the little woman's candle, from the sparkling armor\r\naround, from the steel barbs, and the distant lantern, into its bosom.\r\nIt was scarcely so large as I had expected to see it, but more brilliant\r\nthan anything I could conceive of. I do not believe there is another\r\nsuch in the world. One saw clearly that the Oriental superstition of the\r\nsex of stones was no fable; this was essentially the female of diamonds,\r\nthe queen herself, the principle of life, the rejoicing creative force.\r\nIt was not radiant, as the term literally taken implies; it seemed\r\nrather to retain its wealth,--instead of emitting its glorious rays,\r\nto curl them back like the fringe of a madrepore, and lie there with\r\nredoubled quivering scintillations, a mass of white magnificence, not\r\nprismatic, but a vast milky lustre. I closed the case; on reopening it,\r\nI could scarcely believe that the beautiful sleepless eye would again\r\nflash upon me. I did not comprehend how it could afford such perpetual\r\nrichness, such sheets of lustre.\r\n\r\nAt last we compelled ourselves to be satisfied. I left the shop,\r\ndismissed my attendants, and, fresh from the contemplation of this\r\nmiracle, again trod the dirty, reeking streets, crossed the bridge, with\r\nits lights, its warehouses midway, its living torrents who poured on\r\nunconscious of the beauty within their reach. The thought of their\r\nignorance of the treasure, not a dozen yards distant, has often made\r\nme question if we all are not equally unaware of other and greater\r\nprocesses of life, of more perfect, sublimed, and, as it were, spiritual\r\ncrystallizations going on invisibly about us. But had these been told of\r\nthe thing clutched in the hand of a passer, how many of them would have\r\nknown where to turn? and we,--are we any better?\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few days I carried the diamond about my person, and did not\r\nmention its recovery even to my valet, who knew that I sought it, but\r\ncommunicated only with the Marquis of G., who replied, that he would be\r\nin Paris on a certain day, when I could safely deliver it to him.\r\n\r\nIt was now generally rumored that the neighboring government was about\r\nto send us the Baron Stahl, ambassador concerning arrangements for a\r\nloan to maintain the sinking monarchy in supremacy at Paris, the usual\r\nsynecdoche for France.\r\n\r\nThe weather being fine, I proceeded to call on Mme. de St. Cyr. She\r\nreceived me in her boudoir, and on my way thither I could not but\r\nobserve the perfect quiet and cloistered seclusion that pervaded the\r\nwhole house,--the house itself seeming only an adjunct of the still\r\nand sunny garden, of which one caught a glimpse through the long open\r\nhall-windows beyond. This boudoir did not differ from others to which I\r\nhave been admitted: the same delicate shades; all the dainty appliances\r\nof Art for beauty; the lavish profusion of _bijouterie_; and the usual\r\nstatuettes of innocence, to indicate, perhaps, the presence of that\r\ncommodity which might not be guessed at otherwise; and burning in a\r\nsilver cup, a rich perfume loaded the air with voluptuous sweetness.\r\nThrough a half-open door an inner boudoir was to be seen, which must\r\nhave been Delphine's; it looked like her; the prevailing hue was a soft\r\npurple, or gray; a _prie-dieu_, a book-shelf, and desk, of a dark West\r\nIndian wood, were just visible. There was but one picture,--a sad-eyed,\r\nbeautiful Fate. It was the type of her nation. I think she worshipped\r\nit--And how apt is misfortune! to degenerate into Fate!--not that the\r\ngirl had ever experienced the former, but, dissatisfied with life, and\r\nseeing no outlet, she accepted it stoically and waited till it should be\r\nover. She needed to be aroused;--the station of an _ambassadrice_, which\r\nI desired for her, might kindle the spark. There were no flowers, no\r\nperfumes, no busts, in this ascetic place. Delphine herself, in some\r\nfaint rosy gauze, her fair hair streaming round her, as she lay on a\r\nwhite-draped couch, half-risen on one arm, while she read the morning's\r\n_feuilleton_, was the most perfect statuary of which a room could\r\nboast,--illumined, as I saw her, by the gay beams that entered at the\r\nloftily-arched window, broken only by the flickering of the vine-leaves\r\nthat clustered the curiously-latticed panes without. She resembled in\r\nkind a Nymph or Aphrodite just bursting from the sea. Madame de St. Cyr\r\nreceived me with _empressement_, and, so doing, closed the door of this\r\nshrine. We spoke of various things,--of the court, the theatre, the\r\nweather, the world,--skating lightly round the slender edges of her\r\nsecret, till finally she invited me to lunch with her in the garden.\r\nHere, on a rustic table, stood wine and a few delicacies,--while, by\r\nextending a hand, we could grasp the hanging pears and nectarines, still\r\nwarm to the lip and luscious with sunshine, as we disputed possession\r\nwith the envious wasp who had established a priority of claim.\r\n\r\n\"It is to be hoped,\" I said, sipping the _Haut-Brion_, whose fine and\r\nbrittle smack contrasted rarely with the delicious juiciness of the\r\nfruit, \"that you have laid in a supply of this treasure that neither\r\nmoth nor rust doth corrupt, before parting with that little gem in the\r\nGironde.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah? You know, then, that I have sold it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"I have the pleasure of Mr. Ulster's acquaintance.\"\r\n\r\n\"He arranged the terms for me,\" she said, with restraint,--adding, \"I\r\ncould almost wish now that it had not been.\"\r\n\r\nThis was probably true; for the sum which she hoped to receive from\r\nUlster for standing sponsor to his jewel was possibly equal to the price\r\nof her vineyard.\r\n\r\n\"It was indispensable at the time, this sale; I thought best to hazard\r\nit on one more season.--If, after such advantages, Delphine will not\r\nmarry, why--it remains to retire into the country and end our days with\r\nthe barbarians!\" she continued, shrugging her shoulders; \"I have a house\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will not be obliged to throw us all into despair by such a step\r\nnow,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nShe looked quickly, as if to see how nearly I had approached her\r\ncitadel,--then, finding in my face no expression but a complimentary\r\none, \"No,\" she said, \"I hope that my affairs have brightened a little.\r\nOne never knows what is in store.\"\r\n\r\nBefore long I had assured myself that Mme. de St. Cyr was not a party\r\nto the theft, but had merely been hired by Ulster, who, discovering the\r\nstate of her affairs, had not, therefore, revealed his own,--and\r\nthis without in the least implying any knowledge on my part of the\r\ntransaction. Ulster must have seen the necessity of leaving the business\r\nin the hands of a competent person, and Mme. de St. Cyr's financial\r\ntalent was patent. There were few ladies in Paris who would have\r\nrejected the opportunity. Of these things I felt a tolerable certainty.\r\n\r\n\"We throng with foreigners,\" said Madame, archly, as I reached this\r\npoint. \"Diplomates, too. The Baron Stahl arrives in a day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard,\" I responded. \"You are acquainted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! no,\" she said. \"I knew his father well, though he himself is not\r\nyoung. Indeed, the families thought once of intermarriage. But nothing\r\nhas been said on the subject for many years. His Excellency, I hear,\r\nwill strengthen himself at home by an alliance with the young Countess,\r\nthe natural daughter of the Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"He surely will never be so imprudent as to rivet his chain by such a\r\nlink!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to compute the dice in those despotic countries,\" she\r\nrejoined,--which was pretty well, considering the freedom enjoyed by\r\nFrance at that period.\r\n\r\n\"It may be,\" I suggested, \"that the Baron hopes to open this delicate\r\nsubject with you himself, Madame.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is unlikely,\" she said, sighing. \"And for Delphine, should I tell\r\nher his Excellency preferred scarlet, she would infallibly wear blue.\r\nImagine her, Monsieur, in fine scarlet, with a scarf of gold gauze, and\r\nrustling grasses in that unruly gold hair of hers! She would be divine!\"\r\n\r\nThe maternal instinct as we have it here at Paris confounds me. I do\r\nnot comprehend it. Here was a mother who did not particularly love her\r\nchild, who would not be inconsolable at her loss, would not ruin her own\r\ncomplexion by care of her during illness, would send her through fire\r\nand water and every torture to secure or maintain a desirable rank, who\r\nyet would entangle herself deeply in intrigue, would not hesitate to\r\ntarnish her own reputation, and would, in fact, raise heaven and earth\r\nto--endow this child with a brilliant match. And Mme. de St. Cyr seemed\r\nto regard Delphine, still further, as a cool matter of Art.\r\n\r\nThese little confidences, moreover, are provoking. They put you yourself\r\nso entirely out of the question.\r\n\r\n\"Mlle. de St. Cyr's beauty is peerless,\" I said, slightly chagrined, and\r\nat a loss. \"If hearts were trumps, instead of diamonds!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are poor,\" resumed Madame, pathetically. \"Delphine is not an\r\nheiress. Delphine is proud. She will not stoop to charm. Her coquetry is\r\nthat of an Amazon. Her kisses are arrows. She is Medusa!\" And Madame,\r\nher mother, shivered.\r\n\r\nHere, with her hair knotted up and secured by a tiny dagger, her gauzy\r\ndrapery gathered in her arm, Delphine floated down the green alley\r\ntoward us, as if in a rosy cloud. But this soft aspect never could have\r\nbeen more widely contradicted than by the stony repose and cutting calm\r\nof her beautiful face.\r\n\r\n\"The Marquis of G.,\" said her mother, \"he also arrives ambassador. Has\r\nhe talent? Is he brilliant? Wealthy, of course,--but _gauche_?\"\r\n\r\nTherewith I sketched for them the Marquis and his surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"It is charming,\" said Madame. \"Delphine, do you attend?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\" asked Delphine, half concealing a yawn with her dazzling\r\nhand. \"It is wearisome; it matters not to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he will not go to marry himself in France,\" said her mother. \"Oh,\r\nthese English.\" she added, with a laugh, \"yourself, Monsieur, being\r\nproof of it, will not mingle blood, lest the Channel should still flow\r\nbetween the little red globules! You will go? but to return shortly?\r\nYou will dine with me soon? _Au revoir!_\" and she gave me her hand\r\ngraciously, while Delphine bowed as if I were already gone, threw\r\nherself into a garden-chair, and commenced pouring the wine on a stone\r\nfor a little tame snake which came out and lapped it.\r\n\r\nSuch women as Mme. de St. Cyr have a species of magnetism about them.\r\nIt is difficult to retain one's self-respect before them,--for no\r\nother reason than that one is, at the moment, absorbed into their\r\nindividuality, and thinks and acts with them. Delphine must have had\r\na strong will, and perpetual antagonism did not weaken it. As for me,\r\nMadame had, doubtless, reasons of her own for tearing aside these\r\ncustomary bands of reserve,--reasons which, if you do not perceive, I\r\nshall not enumerate.\r\n\r\n\"Have you met with anything further in your search, Sir?\" asked my\r\nvalet, next morning.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, Hay,\" I returned, in a very good humor,--\"with great success.\r\nYou have assisted me so much, that I am sure I owe it to you to say that\r\nI have found the diamond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Sir, you are very kind. I have been interested, but my\r\nassistance is not worth mentioning. I thought likely it might be, you\r\nappeared so quiet.\"--The cunning dog!--\"How did you find it, Sir, may I\r\nask?\"\r\n\r\nI briefly related the leading facts, since he had been aware of the\r\nprogress of the case to that point,--without, however, mentioning Mme.\r\nde St. Cyr's name.\r\n\r\n\"And Monsieur did not inform me!\" a French valet would have cried.\r\n\r\n\"You were prudent not to mention it, Sir,\" said Hay. \"These walls must\r\nhave better ears than ordinary; for a family has moved in on the first\r\nfloor recently, whose actions are extremely suspicious. But is this\r\nprecious affair to be seen?\"\r\n\r\nI took it from an inner pocket and displayed it, having discarded the\r\nshagreen case as inconvenient.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency must return as he came,\" said I.\r\n\r\nHay's eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n\"And do you carry it there, Sir?\" he asked, with surprised, as I\r\nrestored it to my waistcoat-pocket.\r\n\r\n\"I shall take it to the bank,\" I said. \"I do not like the\r\nresponsibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very unsafe,\" was the warning of this cautious fellow. \"Why, Sir!\r\nany of these swells, these pickpockets, might meet you, run against\r\nyou,--so!\" said Hay, suiting the action to the word, \"and, with the\r\nlittle sharp knife concealed in just such a ring as this I wear, give a\r\nlight tap, and there's a slit in your vest, Sir, but no diamond!\"--and\r\ninstantly resuming his former respectful deportment, Hay handed me my\r\ngloves and stick, and smoothed my hat.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I replied, drawing on the gloves, \"I should like to see the\r\nman who could be too quick for me. Any news from India, Hay?\"\r\n\r\n\"None of consequence, Sir. The indigo crop is said to have failed, which\r\nadvances the figure of that on hand, so that one or two fortunes will be\r\nmade to-day. Your hat, Sir?--your lunettes? Here they are, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Hay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Sir.\"\r\n\r\nI descended the stairs, buttoning my gloves, paused a moment at the door\r\nto look about, and proceeded down the street, which was not more than\r\nusually thronged. At the bank I paused to assure myself that the diamond\r\nwas safe. My fingers caught in a singular slit. I started. As Hay had\r\nprophesied, there was a fine longitudinal cut in my waistcoat, but the\r\npocket was empty. My God! the thing was gone. I never can forget the\r\nblank nihility of all existence that dreadful moment when I stood\r\nfumbling for what was not. Calm as I sit here and tell of it, I vow to\r\nyou a shiver courses through me at the very thought. I had circumvented\r\nStahl only to destroy myself. The diamond was lost again. My mind flew\r\nlike lightning over every chance, and a thousand started up like steel\r\nspikes to snatch the bolt. For a moment I was stunned, but, never being\r\nvery subject to despair, on my recovery, which was almost at once, took\r\nevery measure that could be devised. Who had touched me? Whom had I met?\r\nThrough what streets had I come? In ten minutes the Prefect had the\r\nmatter in hand. My injunctions were strict privacy. I sincerely hoped\r\nthe mishap would not reach England; and if the diamond were not\r\nrecovered before the Marquis of G. arrived,--why, there was the Seine.\r\nIt is all very well to talk,--yet suicide is so French an affair, that\r\nan Englishman does not take to it naturally, and, except in November,\r\nthe Seine is too cold and damp for comfort, but during that month I\r\nsuppose it does not greatly differ in these respects from our own\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nA preternatural activity now possessed me. I slept none, ate little,\r\nworked immoderately. I spared no efforts, for everything was at stake.\r\nIn the midst of all G. arrived. Hay also exerted himself to the utmost;\r\nI promised him a hundred pounds, if I found it. He never told me that\r\nhe said how it would be, never intruded the state of the market, never\r\nresented my irritating conduct, but watched me with narrow yet kind\r\nsolicitude, and frequently offered valuable suggestions, which, however,\r\nas everything else did, led to nothing. I did not call on G., but in\r\na week or so his card was brought up one morning to me. \"Deny me,\" I\r\ngroaned. It yet wanted a week of the day on which I had promised to\r\ndeliver him the diamond. Meanwhile the Baron Stahl had reached Paris,\r\nbut he still remained in private,--few had seen him.\r\n\r\nThe police were forever on the wrong track. To-day they stopped the old\r\nComptesse du Quesne and her jewels, at the Barrière; to-morrow, with\r\ntheir long needles, they riddled a package of lace destined for the\r\nDuchess of X. herself; the Secret Service was doubled; and to crown\r\nall, a splendid new star of the testy Prince de Ligne was examined and\r\nproclaimed to be paste,--the Prince swearing vengeance, if he could\r\ndiscover the cause,--while half Paris must have been under arrest. My\r\nown hotel was ransacked thoroughly,--Hay begging that his traps might be\r\nincluded,--but nothing resulted, and I expected nothing, for, of course,\r\nI could swear that the stone was in my pocket when I stepped into the\r\nstreet. I confess I never was nearer madness,--every word and gesture\r\nstung me like asps,--I walked on burning coals. Enduring all this\r\ntorment, I must yet meet my daily comrades, eat ices at Tortoni's,\r\nstroll on the Boulevards, call on my acquaintance, with the same\r\nequanimity as before. I believe I was equal to it. Only by contrast with\r\nthat blessed time when Ulster and diamonds were unknown, could I imagine\r\nmy past happiness, my present wretchedness. Rather than suffer it again,\r\nI would be stretched on the rack till every bone in my skin was broken.\r\nI cursed Mr. Arthur Ulster every hour in the day; myself, as well; and\r\neven now the word diamond sends a cold blast to my heart. I often met my\r\nfriend the _marchand des armures_. It was his turn to triumph; I fancied\r\nthere must be a hang-dog kind of air about me, as about every sharp man\r\nwho has been outwitted. It wanted finally but two days of that on which\r\nI was to deliver the diamond.\r\n\r\nOne midnight, armed with a dark lantern and a cloak, I was traversing\r\nthe streets alone,--unsuccessful, as usual, just now solitary, and\r\nalmost in despair. As I turned a corner, two men were but scarcely\r\nvisible a step before me. It was a badly-lighted part of the town.\r\nUnseen and noiseless I followed. They spoke in low tones,--almost\r\nwhispers; or rather, one spoke,--the other seemed to nod assent.\r\n\r\n\"On the day but one after to-morrow,\" I heard spoken in English. Great\r\nHeavens! was it possible? had I arrived at a clue? That was the day of\r\ndays for me. \"You have given it, you say, in this billet,--I wish to be\r\nexact, you see,\" continued the voice,--\"to prevent detection, you\r\ngave it, ten minutes after it came into your hands, to the butler of\r\nMadame----,\" (here the speaker stumbled on the rough pavement, and I\r\nlost the name,) \"who,\" he continued, \"will put it in the----\" (a second\r\nstumble acted like a hiccough) \"cellar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wine-cellar,\" I thought; \"and what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the----.\" A third stumble was followed by a round German oath. How\r\neasy it is for me now to fill up the little blanks which that unhappy\r\npavement caused!\r\n\r\n\"You share your receipts with this butler. On the day I obtain it,\" he\r\nadded, and I now perceived his foreign accent, \"I hand you one hundred\r\nthousand francs; afterward, monthly payments till you have received the\r\nstipulated sum. But how will this butler know me, in season to prevent a\r\nmistake? Hem!--he might give it to the other!\"\r\n\r\nMy hearing had been trained to such a degree that I would have promised\r\nto overhear any given dialogue of the spirits themselves, but the\r\nwhisper that answered him eluded me. I caught nothing but a faint\r\nsibillation. \"Your ring?\" was the rejoinder. \"He shall be instructed to\r\nrecognize it? Very well. It is too large,--no, that will do, it fits the\r\nfirst finger. There is nothing more. I am under infinite obligations,\r\nSir; they shall be remembered. Adieu!\"\r\n\r\nThe two parted; which should I pursue? In desperation I turned my\r\nlantern upon one, and illumined a face fresh with color, whose black\r\neyes sparkled askance after the retreating figure, under straight black\r\nbrows. In a moment more he was lost in a false _cul-de-sac_, and I found\r\nit impossible to trace the other.\r\n\r\nI was scarcely better off than before; but it seemed to me that I had\r\nobtained something, and that now it was wisest to work this vein. \"The\r\nbutler of Madame----.\" There were hundreds of thousands of Madames in\r\ntown. I might call on all, and be as old as the Wandering Jew at the\r\nlast call. The cellar. Wine-cellar, of course,--that came by a natural\r\nconnection with butler,--but whose? There was one under my own abode;\r\ncertainly I would explore it. Meanwhile, let us see the entertainments\r\nfor Wednesday. The Prefect had a list of these. For some I found I had\r\ncards; I determined to allot a fraction of time to as many as possible;\r\nmy friends in the Secret Service would divide the labor. Among others,\r\nMadame de St. Cyr gave a dinner, and, as she had been in the affair,\r\nI determined not to neglect her on this occasion, although having no\r\ndefinite idea of what had been, or plan of what should be done. I\r\ndecided not to speak of this occurrence to Hay, since it might only\r\nbring him off some trail that he had struck.\r\n\r\nHaving been provided with keys, early on the following evening I entered\r\nthe wine-cellar, and, concealed in an empty cask that would have held a\r\ndozen of me, waited for something to turn up. Really, when I think of\r\nmyself, a diplomate, a courtier, a man-about-town, curled in a dusty,\r\nmusty wine-barrel, I am moved with vexation and laughter. Nothing,\r\nhowever, turned up,--and at length I retired, baffled. The next night\r\ncame,--no news, no identification of my black-browed man, no success;\r\nbut I felt certain that something must transpire in that cellar. I don't\r\nknow why I had pitched upon that one in particular, but, at an earlier\r\nhour than on the previous night, I again donned the cask. A long time\r\nmust have elapsed; dead silence filled the spacious vaults, except where\r\nnow and then some Sillery cracked the air with a quick explosion, or\r\nsome newer wine bubbled round the bung of its barrel with a faint\r\neffervescence. I had no intention of leaving this place till morning,\r\nbut it suddenly appeared like the most woful waste of time. The master\r\nof this tremendous affair should be abroad and active; who knew what his\r\nkeen eyes might detect, what loss his absence might occasion in this\r\nnick of time? And here he was, shut up and locked in a wine-cellar!\r\nI began to be very nervous; I had already, with aid, searched every\r\ncrevice of the cellar; and now I thought it would be some consolation\r\nto discover the thief, if I never regained the diamond. A distant clock\r\ntolled midnight. There was a faint noise,--a mouse?--no, it was too\r\nprolonged;--nor did it sound like the fiz of Champagne;--a great iron\r\ndoor was turning on its hinges; a man with a lantern was entering;\r\nanother followed, and another. They seated themselves. In a few moments,\r\nappearing one by one and at intervals, some thirty people were in the\r\ncellar. Were they all to share in the proceeds of the diamond? With what\r\njaundiced eyes we behold things! I myself saw all that was only through\r\nthe lens of this diamond, of which not one of these men had ever heard.\r\nAs the lantern threw its feeble glimmer on this group, and I surveyed\r\nthem through my loophole, I thought I had never seen so wild and savage\r\na picture, such enormous shadows, such bold outline, such a startling\r\nflash on the face of their leader, such light retreating up the\r\nthreatening arches. More resolute brows, more determined words, more\r\nunshrinking hearts, I had not met. In fact, I found myself in the centre\r\nof a conspiracy, a society as vindictive as the Jacobins, as unknown and\r\nterrible as the Marianne of to-day. I was thunderstruck, too, at the\r\ncountenances on which the light fell,--men the loyalest in estimation,\r\nministers and senators, millionnaires who had no reason for discontent,\r\ndandies whose reason was supposed to be devoted to their tailors, poets\r\nand artists of generous aspiration and suspected tendencies, and\r\none woman,--Delphine de St. Cyr. Their plans were brave, their\r\ndetermination lofty, their conclave serious and fine; yet as slowly they\r\nshut up their hopes and fears in the black masks, one man bent toward\r\nthe lantern to adjust his. When he lifted his face before concealing it,\r\nI recognized him also. I had met him frequently at the Bureau of Police;\r\nhe was, I believe, Secretary of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nI had no sympathy with these people. I had liberty enough myself, I was\r\nwell enough satisfied with the world, I did not care to revolutionize\r\nFrance; but my heart rebelled at the mockery, as this traitor and\r\nspy, this creature of a system by which I gained my fame, showed his\r\nrevolting face and veiled it again. And Delphine, what had she to do\r\nwith them? One by one, as they entered, they withdrew, and I was left\r\nalone again. But all this was not my diamond.\r\n\r\nAnother hour elapsed. Again the door opened, and remained ajar. Some one\r\nentered, whom I could not see. There was a pause,--then a rustle,--the\r\ndoor creaked ever so little. \"Art thou there?\" lisped a shrill\r\nwhisper,--a woman, as I could guess.\r\n\r\n\"My angel, it is I,\" was returned, a semitone lower. She approached, he\r\nadvanced, and the consequence was a salute resonant as the smack with\r\nwhich a Dutch burgomaster may be supposed to set down his mug. I was\r\nprepared for anything. Ye gods! if it should be Delphine! But the base\r\nsuspicion was birth-strangled as they spoke again. The conversation\r\nwhich now ensued between these lovers under difficulties was tender and\r\naffecting beyond expression. I had felt guilty enough when an unwilling\r\nauditor of the conspirators,--since, though one employs spies, one\r\ndoes not therefore act that part one's-self, but on emergencies,--an\r\nunwillingness which would not, however, prevent my turning to advantage\r\nthe information gained; but here, to listen to this rehearsal of woes\r\nand blisses, this _ah mon Fernand_, this aria in an area, growing\r\nmomently more fervent, was too much. I overturned the cask, scrambled\r\nupon my feet, and fled from the cellar, leaving the astounded lovers to\r\nfollow, while, agreeably to my instincts, and regardless of the diamond,\r\nI escaped the embarrassing predicament.\r\n\r\nAt length it grew to be noon of the appointed day. Nothing had\r\ntranspired; all our labor was idle. I felt, nevertheless, more buoyant\r\nthan usual,--whether because I was now to put my fate to the test, or\r\nthat today was the one of which my black-browed man had spoken, and I\r\ntherefore entertained a presentiment of good-fortune, I cannot say. But\r\nwhen, in unexceptionable toilet, I stood on Mme. de St. Cyr's steps,\r\nmy heart sunk. G. was doubtless already within, and I thought of the\r\n_marchand des armures'_ exclamation, \"Queen of Heaven, Monsieur! how\r\nshall I meet him!\" I was plunged at once into the profoundest gloom.\r\nWhy had I undertaken the business at all? This interference, this\r\ngood-humor, this readiness to oblige,--it would ruin me yet! I forswore\r\nit, as Falstaff forswore honor. Why needed I to meddle in the _mêlée?_\r\nWhy--But I was no catechumen. Questions were useless now. My emotions\r\nare not chronicled on my face, I flatter myself; and with my usual\r\nrepose I saluted our hostess. Greeting G. without any allusion to\r\nthe diamond, the absence of which allusion he received as a point of\r\netiquette, I was conversing with Mrs. Leigh, when the Baron Stahl was\r\nannounced. I turned to look at his Excellency. A glance electrified me.\r\nThere was my dark-browed man of the midnight streets. It must, then,\r\nhave been concerning the diamond that I had heard him speak. His\r\ncountenance, his eager, glittering eye, told that today was as eventful\r\nto him as to me. If he were here, I could well afford to be. As he\r\naddressed me in English, my certainty was confirmed; and the instant\r\nin which I observed the ring, gaudy and coarse, upon his finger, made\r\nconfirmation doubly sure. I own I was surprised that anything could\r\ninduce the Baron to wear such an ornament. Here he was actually risking\r\nhis reputation as a man of taste, as an exquisite, a leader of _haut\r\nton_, a gentleman, by the detestable vulgarity of this ring. But why do\r\nI speak so of the trinket? Do I not owe it a thrill of as fine joy as I\r\never knew? Faith! it was not unfamiliar to me. It had been a daily sight\r\nfor years. In meeting the Baron Stahl I had found the diamond.\r\n\r\nThe Baron Stahl was, then, the thief? Not at all. My valet, as of course\r\nyou have been all along aware, was the thief.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of G. took down Mme. de St. Cyr; Stahl preceded me, with\r\nDelphine. As we sat at table, G. was at the right, I at the left of our\r\nhostess. Next G. sat Delphine; below her, the Baron; so that we were\r\nnearly _vis-a-vis_. I was now as fully convinced that Mme. de St. Cyr's\r\ncellar was the one, as the day before I had been that the other was;\r\nI longed to reach it. Hay had given the stone to a butler--doubtless\r\nthis--the moment of its theft; but, not being aware of Mme. de St.\r\nCyr's previous share in the adventure, had probably not afforded her\r\nanother. And thus I concluded her to be ignorant of the game we were\r\nabout to play; and I imagined, with the interest that one carries into a\r\nromance, the little preliminary scene between the Baron and Madame that\r\nmust have already taken place, being charmed by the cheerfulness with\r\nwhich she endured the loss of the promised reward.\r\n\r\nAs the Baron entered the dining-room. I saw him withdraw his glove, and\r\nmove the jewelled hand across his hair while passing the solemn butler,\r\nwho gave it a quick recognition;--the next moment we were seated. It was\r\na dinner _à la Russe_; that is, only wines were on the table, clustered\r\naround a central ornament,--a bunch of tall silver rushes and\r\nflag-leaves, on whose airy tip danced _fleurs-de-lis_ of frosted silver,\r\na design of Delphine's,--the dishes being on side-tables, from which\r\nthe guests were served as they signified their choice of the variety on\r\ntheir cards. Our number not being large, and the custom so informal,\r\nrendered it pleasant.\r\n\r\nI had just finished my oysters and was pouring out a glass of Chablis,\r\nwhen another plate was set before the Baron.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency has no salt,\" murmured the butler,--at the same time\r\nplacing one beside him. A glance, at entrance, had taught me that most\r\nof the service was uniform; this dainty little _salière_ I had noticed\r\non the buffet, solitary, and unlike the others. What a fool had I been!\r\nThose gaps in the Baron's remarks caused by the paving-stones, how\r\neasily were they to be supplied!\r\n\r\n\"Madame?\"\r\n\r\nMadame de St. Cyr.\r\n\r\n\"The cellar?\"\r\n\r\nA salt-cellar.\r\n\r\nHow quick the flash that enlightened me while I surveyed the _salière!_\r\n\r\n\"It is exquisite! Am I never to sit at your table but some new device\r\ncharms me?\" I exclaimed. \"Is it your design, Mademoiselle?\" I said,\r\nturning to Delphine.\r\n\r\nDelphine, who had been ice to all the Baron's advances, only curled her\r\nlip. \"_Des babioles!_\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mme. de St. Cyr, extending her hand for it. \"But\r\nnone the less her taste. Is it not a fairy thing? A _Cellini!_ Observe\r\nthis curve, these lines! but one man could have drawn them!\"--and she\r\nheld it for our scrutiny. It was a tiny hand and arm of ivory, parting\r\nthe foam of a wave and holding a golden shell, in which the salt seemed\r\nto have crusted itself as if in some secretest ocean-hollow. I looked at\r\nthe Baron a moment; his eyes were fastened upon the _salière_, and all\r\nthe color had forsaken his cheeks,--his face counted his years. The\r\ndiamond was in that little shell. But how to obtain it? I had no novice\r\nto deal with; nothing but delicate _finesse_ would answer.\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to examine it,\" I said. She passed it to her left hand for me\r\nto take. The butler made a step forward.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile, Madame,\" said the Baron, smiling, \"I have no salt.\"\r\n\r\nThe instinct of hospitality prevailed;--she was about to return it.\r\nMight I do an awkward thing? Unhesitatingly. Reversing my glass, I\r\ngave my arm a wider sweep than necessary, and, as it met her hand with\r\nviolence, the _salière_ fell. Before it touched the floor I caught it\r\nThere was still a pinch of salt left,--nothing more.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand pardons!\" I said, and restored it to the Baron.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency beheld it with dismay; it was rare to see him bend over\r\nand scrutinize it with starting eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Do you find there what Count Arnaklos begs in the song,\" asked\r\nDelphine,--\"the secret of the sea, Monsieur?\"\r\n\r\nHe handed it to the butler, observing, \"I find here no\"----\r\n\r\n\"Salt, Monsieur?\" replied the man, who did not doubt but all had gone\r\nright, and replenished it.\r\n\r\nHad one told me in the morning that no intricate manoeuvres, but a\r\nsimple blunder, would effect this, I might have met him in the Bois de\r\nBoulogne.\r\n\r\n\"We will not quarrel,\" said my neighbor, lightly, with reference to the\r\npopular superstition.\r\n\r\n\"Rather propitiate the offended deities by a crumb tossed over the\r\nshoulder,\" added I.\r\n\r\n\"Over the left?\" asked the Baron, to intimate his knowledge of another\r\nidiom, together with a reproof for my _gaucherie_.\r\n\r\n\"_À gauche,--quelquefois c'est justement à droit_,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Salt in any pottage,\" said Madame, a little uneasily, \"is like surprise\r\nin an individual; it brings out the flavor of every ingredient, so my\r\ncook tells me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a preventive of palsy,\" I remarked, as the slight trembling of my\r\nadversary's finger caught my eye.\r\n\r\n\"And I have noticed that a taste for it is peculiar to those who trace\r\ntheir blood to Galitzin,\" continued Madame.\r\n\r\n\"Let us, therefore, elect a deputation to those mines near Cracow,\" said\r\nDelphine.\r\n\r\n\"To our cousins, the slaves there?\" laughed her mother.\r\n\r\n\"I must vote to lay your bill on the table, Mademoiselle,\" I rejoined.\r\n\r\n\"But with a _boule blanche_, Monsieur?\"\r\n\r\n\"As the salt has been laid on the floor,\" said the Baron.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as this light skirmishing proceeded, my sleeve and Mme. de\r\nSt. Cyr's dress were slightly powdered, but I had not seen the diamond.\r\nThe Baron, bolder than I, looked under the table, but made no discovery.\r\nI was on the point of dropping my napkin to accomplish a similar\r\nmovement, when my accommodating neighbor dropped hers. To restore it, I\r\nstooped. There it lay, large and glowing, the Sea of Splendor, the Moon\r\nof Milk, the Torment of my Life, on the carpet, within half an inch of a\r\nlady's slipper. Mademoiselle de St. Cyr's foot had prevented the Baron\r\nfrom seeing it; now it moved and unconsciously covered it. All was as\r\nI wished. I hastily restored the napkin, and looked steadily at\r\nDelphine,--so steadily, that she perceived some meaning, as she had\r\nalready suspected a game. By my sign she understood me, pressed her foot\r\nupon the stone and drew it nearer. In France we do not remain at table\r\nuntil unfit for a lady's society,--we rise with them. Delphine needed to\r\ndrop neither napkin nor handkerchief; she composedly stooped and picked\r\nup the stone, so quickly that no one saw what it was.\r\n\r\n\"And the diamond?\" said the Baron to the butler, rapidly, as he passed.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the _salière!_\" whispered the astonished creature.\r\n\r\nIn the drawing-room I sought the Marquis.\r\n\r\n\"To-day I was to surrender you your property,\" I said; \"it is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he replied, \"I thought I must have been mistaken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any of our volatile friends here might have been,\" I resumed; \"for us\r\nit is impossible. Concerning this, when you return to France, I will\r\nrelate the incidents; at present, there are those who will not hesitate\r\nto take life to obtain its possession. The _diligence_ leaves in twenty\r\nminutes; and if I owned the diamond, it should not leave me behind.\r\nMoreover, who knows what a day may bring forth? To-morrow there may be\r\nan _émeute_. Let me restore the thing as you withdraw.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquis, who is not, after all, the Lion of England, pausing a\r\nmoment to transmit my words from his ear to his brain, did not afterward\r\ndelay to make inquiries or adieux, but went to seek Mme. de St. Cyr\r\nand wish her goodnight, on his departure from Paris. As I awaited his\r\nreturn, which I knew would not be immediate, Delphine left the Baron and\r\njoined me.\r\n\r\n\"You beckoned me?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I come by your desire, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" I said, \"I am not in the custom of doing favors; I have\r\nforsworn them. But before you return me my jewel, I risk my head and\r\nrender one last one, and to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not, Monsieur, at such price,\" she responded, with a slight mocking\r\nmotion of her hand.\r\n\r\n\"Delphine! those resolves, last night, in the cellar, were daring; they\r\nwere noble, yet they were useless.\"\r\n\r\nShe had not started, but a slight tremor ran over her person and\r\nvanished while I spoke.\r\n\r\n\"They will be allowed to proceed no farther,--the axe is sharpened; for\r\nthe last man who adjusted his mask was a spy,--was the Secretary of the\r\nSecret Service.\"\r\n\r\nDelphine could not have grown paler than was usual with her of late. She\r\nflashed her eye upon me.\r\n\r\n\"He was, it may be, Monsieur himself,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I do not claim the honor of that post.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you were there, nevertheless,--a spy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Delphine! It would be absurd to quarrel. I was there for the\r\nrecovery of this stone, having heard that it was in a cellar,--which,\r\nstupidly enough, I had insisted should be a wine-cellar.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was, then\"----\r\n\r\n\"In a salt-cellar,--a blunder which, as you do not speak English, you\r\ncannot comprehend. I never mix with treason, and did not wish to assist\r\nat your pastimes. I speak now, that you may escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Monsieur betrays his friends, the police, why should I expect a\r\nkinder fate?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I use the police, they are my servants, not my friends. I simply\r\nwarn you, that, before sunrise, you will be safer travelling than\r\nsleeping,--safer next week in Vienna than in Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you! And the intelligence is the price of the diamond? If I had\r\nnot chanced to pick it up, my throat,\" and she clasped it with her\r\nfingers, \"had been no slenderer than the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Delphine, will you remember, should you have occasion to do so in\r\nVienna, that it is just possible for an Englishman to have affections,\r\nand sentiments, and, in fact, sensations? that, with him, friendship can\r\nbe inviolate, and to betray it an impossibility? And even were it\r\nnot, I, Mademoiselle, have not the pleasure to be classed by you as a\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n\"You err. I esteem Monsieur highly.\"\r\n\r\nI was impressed by her coolness.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see if you comprehend the matter,\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. The arrest will be used to-night, the guillotine to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will take immediate measures for flight?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--I do not see that life has value. I shall be the debtor of him who\r\ntakes it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A large debt. Delphine, I exact a promise of you. I do not care to have\r\nendangered myself for nothing. It is not worth while to make your mother\r\nunhappy. Life is not yours to throw away. I appeal to your magnanimity.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Affections, sentiments, sensations!'\" she quoted. \"Your own danger\r\nfor the affection,--it is an affair of the heart! Mme. de St. Cyr's\r\nunhappiness,--there is the sentiment. You are angry, Monsieur,--that\r\nmust be the sensation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delphine, I am waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well. You have mentioned Vienna, and why? Liberals are countenanced\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least. But Madame l'Ambassadrice will be countenanced.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know her.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not apt to know ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur, how idle are these cross-purposes!\" she said, folding her\r\nfan.\r\n\r\n\"Delphine,\" I continued, taking the fan, \"tell me frankly which of these\r\ntwo men you prefer,--the Marquis or his Excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Marquis? He is antiphlogistic,--he is ice. Why should I freeze\r\nmyself? I am frozen now,--I need fire!\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes burned as she spoke, and a faint red flushed her cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle, you demonstrate to me that life has yet a value to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I find no fire,\" she said, as the flush fell away.\r\n\r\n\"The Baron?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not affect him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will conquer your prejudice in Vienna.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not comprehend you, Monsieur;--you speak in riddles, which I do\r\nnot like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will speak plainer. But first let me ask you for the diamond.\"\r\n\r\n\"The diamond? It is yours? How am I certified of it? I find it on the\r\nfloor; you say it was in my mother's _salière_; it is her affair, not\r\nmine. No, Monsieur, I do not see that the thing is yours.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly there was nothing to be done but to relate the story, which I\r\ndid, carefully omitting the Baron's name. At its conclusion, she placed\r\nthe prize in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon, Monsieur,\" she said; \"without doubt you should receive it. And\r\nthis agent of the government,--one could turn him like hot iron in this\r\nvice,--who was he?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Baron Stahl.\"\r\n\r\nAll this time G. had been waiting on thorns, and, leaving her now, I\r\napproached him, displayed for an instant the treasure on my palm, and\r\nslipped it into his. It was done. I bade farewell to this Eye of Morning\r\nand Heart of Day, this thing that had caused me such pain and perplexity\r\nand pleasure, with less envy and more joy than I thought myself capable\r\nof. The relief and buoyancy that seized me, as his hand closed upon it,\r\nI shall not attempt to portray. An abdicated king was not freer.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis departed, and I, wandering round the _salon_, was next\r\nstranded upon the Baron. He was yet hardly sure of himself. We talked\r\nindifferently for a few moments, and then I ventured on the great loan.\r\nHe was, as became him, not communicative, but scarcely thought it would\r\nbe arranged. I then spoke of Delphine.\r\n\r\n\"She is superb!\" said the Baron, staring at her boldly.\r\n\r\nShe stood opposite, and, in her white attire on the background of the\r\nblue curtain, appeared like an impersonation of Greek genius relieved\r\nupon the blue of an Athenian heaven. Her severe and classic outline,\r\nher pallor, her downcast lids, her absorbed look, only heightened the\r\nresemblance. Her reverie seemed to end abruptly, the same red stained\r\nher cheek again, her lips curved in a proud smile, she raised her\r\nglowing eyes and observed us regarding her. At too great distance to\r\nhear our words, she quietly repaid our glances in the strength of her\r\nnew decision, and then, turning, began to entertain those next her with\r\nan unwonted spirit.\r\n\r\n\"She has needed,\" I replied to the Baron, \"but one thing,--to be\r\naroused, to be kindled. See, it is done! I have thought that a life of\r\ncabinets and policy might achieve this, for her talent is second not\r\neven to her beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is unhappy that both should be wasted,\" said the Baron. \"She, of\r\ncourse, will never marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"For various reasons.\"\r\n\r\n\"One?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which will not signify to your Excellency. Another?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is too beautiful. One would fall in love with her. And to love\r\none's own wife--it is ridiculous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who should know?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"All the world would suspect and laugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let those laugh that win.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--she would never do as a wife; but then as\"----\r\n\r\n\"But then in France we do not insult hospitality!\"\r\n\r\nThe Baron transferred his gaze to me for a moment, then tapped his\r\nsnuff-box, and approached the circle round Delphine.\r\n\r\nIt was odd that we, the arch enemies of the hour, could speak without\r\nthe intervention of seconds; but I hoped that the Baron's conversation\r\nmight be diverting,--the Baron hoped that mine might be didactic.\r\n\r\nThey were very gay with Delphine. He leaned on the back of a chair and\r\nlistened. One spoke of the new gallery of the Tuileries, and the five\r\npavilions,--a remark which led us to architecture.\r\n\r\n\"We all build our own houses,\" said Delphine, at last, \"and then\r\ncomplain that they cramp us here, and the wind blows in there, while\r\nthe fault is not in the order, but in us, who increase here and shrink\r\nthere--without reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak in metaphors,\" said the Baron.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely. A truth is often more visible veiled than nude.\"\r\n\r\n\"We should soon exhaust the orders,\" I interposed; \"for who builds like\r\nhis neighbor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Slight variations, Monsieur! Though we take such pains to conceal the\r\nstyle, it is not difficult to tell the order of architecture chosen by\r\nthe builders in this room. My mother, for instance,--you perceive that\r\nher pavilion would be the florid Gothic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle's is the Doric,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Has been,\" she murmured, with a quick glance.\r\n\r\n\"And mine, Mademoiselle?\" asked the Baron, indifferently.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Monsieur,\" she returned, looking serenely upon him, \"when one has\r\nall the winning cards in hand and yet loses the stake, we allot him _un\r\npavilion chinois\"_--which was the polite way of dubbing him Court Fool.\r\n\r\nThe Baron's eyes fell. Vexation and alarm were visible on his contracted\r\nbrow. He stood in meditation for some time. It must have been evident to\r\nhim that Delphine knew of the recent occurrences,--that here in Paris\r\nshe could denounce him as the agent of a felony, the participant of a\r\ntheft. What might prevent it? Plainly but one thing: no woman would\r\ndenounce her husband. He had scarcely contemplated this step on arrival.\r\n\r\nThe guests were again scattered in groups round the room. I examined\r\nan engraving on an adjacent table. Delphine reclined as lazily in a\r\n_fauteuil_ as if her life did not hang in the balance. The Baron drew\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said he, \"you allotted me just now a cap and bells.\r\nIf two should wear it?--if I should invite another into my _pavilion\r\nchinois_?--if I should propose to complete an alliance, desired by my\r\nfather, with the ancient family of St. Cyr?--if, in short, Mademoiselle,\r\nI should request you to become my wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh, bien, Monsieur,--and if you should?\" I heard her coolly reply.\r\n\r\nBut it was no longer any business of mine. I rose and sought Mme. de St.\r\nCyr, who, I thought, was slightly uneasy, perceiving some mystery to be\r\nafloat. After a few words, I retired.\r\n\r\nArchimedes, as perhaps you have never heard, needed only a lever to move\r\nthe world. Such a lever I had put into the hands of Delphine, with\r\nwhich she might move, not indeed the grand globe, with its multiplied\r\nattractions, relations, and affinities, but the lesser world of\r\ncircumstances, of friends and enemies, the circle of hopes, fears,\r\nambitions. There is no woman, as I believe, but could have used it.\r\n\r\nThe next day was scarcely so quiet in the city as usual. The great loan\r\nhad not been negotiated. Both the Baron Stahl and the English minister\r\nhad left Paris,--and there was a _coup d'état_.\r\n\r\nBut the Baron did not travel alone. There had been a ceremony at\r\nmidnight in the Church of St. Sulpice, and her Excellency the Baroness\r\nStahl, _née_ de St. Cyr, accompanied him.\r\n\r\nIt is a good many years since. I have seen the diamond in the Duchess\r\nof X.'s coronet, at the drawing-room, often,--but I have never seen\r\nDelphine. The Marquis begged me to retain the chain, and I gave myself\r\nthe pleasure of presenting it, through her mother, to the Baroness\r\nStahl. I hear, that, whenever she desires to effect any cherished object\r\nwhich the Baron opposes, she has only to wear this chain, and effect it.\r\nIt appears to possess a magical power, and its potent spell enslaves the\r\nBaron as the lamp and ring of Eastern tales enslaved the Afrites.\r\n\r\nThe life she leads has aroused her. She is no longer the impassive\r\nSilence; she has found her fire. I hear of her as the charm of a\r\nbrilliant court, as the soul of a nation of intrigue. Of her beauty one\r\ndoes not speak, but her talent is called prodigious. What impels me\r\nto ask the idle question, If it were well to save her life for this?\r\nUndoubtedly she fills a station which, in that empire, must be the\r\nsummit of a woman's ambition. Delphine's Liberty was not a principle,\r\nbut a dissatisfaction. The Baroness Stahl is vehement, is Imperialist,\r\nis successful. While she lives, it is on the top of the wave; when she\r\ndies,--ah! what business has Death in such a world?\r\n\r\nAs I said, I have never seen Delphine since her marriage. The beautiful\r\nstatuesque girl occupies a niche into which the blazing and magnificent\r\n_intrigante_ cannot crowd. I do not wish to be disillusioned.

In the sluggish days that\r\npreceded the revolutionary efforts of our fathers, a nationality was\r\nfixed, seemingly immutable, the growth of scarcely numbered ages, the\r\ndaughter of immemorial Time. A people then could place its hand upon its\r\ntitle-deeds, and, looking back through half a score of centuries, trace\r\nits gradual development from nothingness to power. To-day, on the\r\ncontrary,--to use a somewhat daring metaphor,--nations have become\r\nautochthonous; they have repudiated the feeble processes of conception\r\nand tutelage; they spring, armed and full-grown, from the forehead of\r\ntheir progenitors, or rise, in sudden ripeness, from the soil.\r\n\r\nThousands must now be living, the citizens of prosperous states, who\r\ncan recall the days when they had entered upon manhood and yet the name\r\nitself of their nation had no existence. How many, indeed, are still\r\namong us, to whom nations owe the impetus that gave them birth!\r\nProminent, at least, among those who can lay claim to such distinction,\r\nthere still stands one whose career it were well, perhaps, to study. We\r\nwill endeavor to profit by a glance at it.\r\n\r\nWith this intent let us transport ourselves in imagination to the Llanos\r\nor Plains of Venezuela. It is a region similar in some respects, widely\r\ndissimilar in others, to the more celebrated Pampas of the regions to\r\nthe south. The wonderful plain, covering more than two hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles, and forming the basin of the gigantic Orinoco, is a study\r\nin itself. The stranger who descends upon the vast savanna from the\r\nmountains that line and defend the coast is impressed with the momentary\r\nbelief, when his eye for the first time sweeps over the level immensity,\r\nthat he is again approaching the sea. From the hilly country through\r\nwhich he has toiled, he beholds at his feet a limitless and dusky plain,\r\nsmooth as an ocean in repose, but undulating, like it, in gigantic\r\nsweeps and curves. The Llanos that he sees spread out before him thus\r\nare one huge and exuberant pasture. Like the Pampas of Buenos Ayres,\r\nthey are the support of myriads of roaming cattle; but, unlike them,\r\nthey are intersected by numerous rivers, and suffer rather from excess\r\nthan from lack of moisture. The Orinoco sweeps, in turbid magnificence,\r\nfrom west to east, traversing their entire breadth; and its countless\r\ntributaries seam in every direction the immense plain thus divided, and\r\nfrequently by their unmanageable floods turn it for thousands of miles\r\ninto a lake.\r\n\r\nThe dwellers in this region have a character no less distinctive than\r\nthat of the Plains themselves. At long intervals, sometimes scores of\r\nmiles apart, their habitations are established; but their home is the\r\nsaddle. Innumerable herds of cattle and of horses turn to account the\r\npasturage of the rich savanna; and the true Llanero exists only as\r\nguardian or proprietor of these savage hosts. He is as much at home in\r\nthis trackless expanse of rank vegetation as the mariner navigating\r\na familiar sea. There are no roads in the Llanos; but he can gallop\r\nunerringly to any given point, be it hundreds of miles away. There are\r\nno boundaries to the huge estates; but he knows when the cattle he is\r\nset to protect are grazing upon their own territory or upon that of a\r\nneighbor. He leads a life in which the extremes of solitariness and of\r\nactivity are combined. Separated from his nearest neighbor by a journey\r\nof half a day, visited only rarely at his _hato_ or farm-house by\r\nsome casual traveller, or by the itinerant Galician peddler, whom he\r\ncontemptuously denominates the _merca-chifles_, the silent horseman\r\nlives wrapt up in ignorance of all but the care of the roving beasts\r\nthat are intrusted to his vigilance.\r\n\r\nLet us glance somewhat more nearly at the Llanero in his home. If we\r\nare able to obtain an elevated view of the savanna,--let us say, in the\r\nLlanos which constitute the Province of Barinas, and through which the\r\nApure rolls its rapid current to swell the volume of the Orinoco,--we\r\nshall observe, at distant intervals upon the plain, irregular groups\r\nof palm-trees surmounting the wavy level of the grass. These isolated\r\nclumps or groves, called _matas_ in the provincial idiom, form the\r\nlandmarks of the Venezuelan Plains; and in the neighborhood of each we\r\nshall find the _hato_ or dwelling of a Llanero. The building, we shall\r\nfind in every case, is a roughly-constructed hut, consisting of a floor\r\nraised a couple of feet above the spongy soil, and covered with a steep\r\nroof of palm-branches, with perhaps a thatch composed of the leaves\r\nof the same invaluable tree. A rough partition of mud-plastered twigs\r\ndivides the Llanero's dwelling into unequal apartments; the lesser being\r\nreserved for the use of the females of the household, while the larger,\r\nfurnished with half-a-dozen hides, the skin of a jaguar, and a couple of\r\nbenches or stools ingeniously manufactured from bamboo, is the general\r\nreception-room, sleeping-apartment, and workshop for the _hatero_, when\r\nthe floods are out, or when he takes a fancy at other times to shelter\r\nhis head beneath a roof. A few rods from the dwelling is the _corral_ or\r\ncattle-pen, a large oval inclosure, into which, at irregular intervals,\r\nhe drives his herds for purposes of branding or enumeration; and near\r\nthe _corral_ two or three impatient horses, shackled with a thong\r\nconfining the forelegs, are grazing.\r\n\r\nThe cattle-farms or _hatos_ of the Plains are owned, for the most part,\r\nby the Creole residents of the cities which dot their outskirts, but are\r\ninhabited only by the semibarbarous _hateros_, who attend to the\r\nfew requirements of the stock, and slaughter the annual supply. The\r\n_hatero_, although a descendant, and proud that he is so, of the Spanish\r\nsettlers, has much intermixture of Indian and negro blood in his\r\nveins. Few of the Llaneros, indeed, could show a pedigree in which the\r\nCastilian blood was not sorely attenuated and diluted with that of\r\nhalf-a-dozen Indian or negro progenitors. He is born on the Llanos, as\r\nwere his ancestors for many generations; and he has no conception of a\r\nland in which cattle-plains are unknown, and where the carcass of an\r\nanimal is of more value than the hide. His ideas are restricted to\r\nhis occupation, and his religious notions limited to the traditional\r\ninstruction handed down from the days when his forefathers lived amid\r\ncivilized men, or to the casual teaching of some fervent missionary, who\r\ndevotes himself to the spiritual welfare of these lonely dwellers on the\r\nPlains. Eight or ten persons at the utmost form a _hato_, and suffice\r\nfor all the requirements of thousands of cattle. The women are as much\r\naccustomed to solitude as the men, and spend their time in domestic\r\noccupations, or in cultivating the little patch of ground upon which\r\ntheir supply of maize and cassava is grown. The occasion of their\r\nmarriage is perhaps the only one of their visit to a town,--perhaps\r\ntheir only opportunity of seeing a printed book. Men and women alike are\r\na simple, healthy, ignorant race, borrowing manners, dress, and dialect\r\nrather from the Indian than from the Spanish stock.\r\n\r\nSuch as he is, nevertheless, and for the purposes which his existence\r\nsubserves, the true Llanero is indeed well placed in his peculiar\r\nregion. A man of middle stature, usually of broad and powerful build,\r\nshort-necked, with square head and narrow forehead, and with eyes that\r\nwould be black, if it were not for the fire that flickers in them with a\r\ncarbuncle-like intensity. From the hips upward the Llanero is straight\r\nand well-proportioned; but his constant equitation curves and bandies\r\nhis legs in a manner plainly visible whenever he attempts to walk. His\r\ndistinctive costume consists of the _calzones_, or cotton breeches,\r\nreaching a little below the knee, a tunic or smock-frock of the same\r\nmaterial, confined about his waist with a thong of leather, into which\r\nhe thrusts his formidable _machete_ or cutlass, and the inevitable\r\n_poncho_, that many-colored blanket which the entire Spanish-American\r\nrace has adopted at the hands of the vanquished Indians, and which he\r\nuses as cloak, as pillow, as bed, and sometimes as saddle. Boots he has\r\nnone, nor shoes; but perhaps he may fasten strips of raw hide to\r\nhis feet by way of sandals,--and a piece of raw hide covers, in all\r\nprobability, his head. He cares little for ornament, since there are so\r\nfew about him to admire display; and all his pride is concentrated in\r\nthe steed that bears him, the lasso that he can throw with such unerring\r\naim, and the heavy lance that he uses in driving his ferocious cattle,\r\nor as a death-dealing weapon when he is called upon to take part in some\r\npartisan warfare.\r\n\r\nUpon his _hato_, perhaps, there are between one and two hundred thousand\r\nhead of cattle and horses, guarded here and there by isolated posts of\r\na nature similar to his own. The animals, savage from their birth, roam\r\nthe plain in droves of many hundreds, each herd commanded by two or\r\nthree bulls or stallions, whose authority is no less despotic than that\r\nof the colonel of a Russian regiment. They sweep from feeding-ground to\r\nfeeding-ground, galloping eight or ten abreast, headed by scouts, and\r\nsuffering no human being or strange animal to cross their path. As the\r\ndusky squadron hurries, like an incarnate whirlwind, from one point to\r\nanother, every one prudently withdraws from their irresistible advance;\r\nand instances have occurred in which large bodies of troops, marching\r\nacross the Plains, have been scattered and routed by an accidental\r\ncharge of some such wild-eyed regiment. At certain intervals, _la\r\nhierra_, the branding, takes place; when drove after drove are\r\ndexterously compelled within the walls of the _corral_, and there\r\nmarked with the initials or cipher of the proprietor. This is the great\r\nfestival of the _hatero_, and he invites to it all his neighbors for\r\nscores of leagues around. The bellowing cattle, the plunging steeds, the\r\nexcitement of lassoing some bull more refractory than usual, the hissing\r\nof the iron as it sears the brand-mark deep into the animal's hide, all\r\nthese are elements of exquisite enjoyment to the unsophisticated Rarey\r\nof the Plains. His great delight, on such occasions, is to display his\r\nskill in lassoing an untamed colt, or in performing the feat called to\r\n_colear_ a bull. He selects from the suspicious herd some fine young\r\nthree-year old, grazing somewhat apart from the main body, and creeps\r\nsilently towards it. Suddenly the lasso flies in snaky coils over the\r\nhead of the beast, and is drawn with strangulating tightness about its\r\nneck. At the first plunge, a brother _hatero_ lassoes the animal's hind\r\nlegs, and it is permitted to rear and kick as frantically as it can,\r\nuntil it drops to the ground exhausted and strangled. The Llanero\r\nimmediately approaches the prostrate colt, and deliberately beats its\r\nhead with a heavy bludgeon until it becomes quite senseless. He then\r\nplaces his saddle upon its back, adjusts a murderous bit in its clammy\r\nmouth, and seats himself firmly in the saddle at the moment when the\r\nanimal recovers strength enough to rise. The fearful plunges, the wild\r\nbounds, the vicious attempts at biting, which ensue, are all in vain; in\r\na couple of days he subsides into a mere high-spirited trotter, whom one\r\ncan ride with ease after once effecting a mount.\r\n\r\nThe pastime of \"tailing\" a bull is somewhat singular. Two or three\r\nhorsemen single out an animal upon which to practise it, and secure a\r\nlasso about its horns. Another lasso, deftly thrown about its hind legs,\r\nis fastened to a tree, and the strongest of the party then seizes the\r\nbellowing beast by its tail, which he twists until his victim falls over\r\non its side and is dispatched. The greatest dexterity is required in\r\nthis manoeuvre by all practising it, as the slacking of either lasso\r\nenables the bull to turn upon his caudal persecutor, who is certain to\r\nbe gored to death. This, indeed, not unfrequently happens. But a Llanero\r\ncares little for death. He faces it daily in his lonely converse with\r\nthousands of intractable beasts, in his bath in the river swarming with\r\nalligators,--in the swamp teeming with serpents, against whose poison\r\nthere is no antidote, and whose bite will destroy the life of a man in a\r\nsingle hour. Content with the wild excitement of his daily round of duty\r\nand recreation, with his meal of dried beef and cassava-cake, washed\r\ndown, it is likely, with a gourdful of _guarapo_, a species of rum, in\r\ncomparison with which the New England beverage is innocent and weak, and\r\nwith the occasional recurrence of some such turbulent festival as that\r\nof the branding, he cares nothing for the future, and bestows no thought\r\nupon the past. The Llanero may be called a happy man.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nEL ARAUSENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years more than half a century ago there lived a Creole trader of\r\nsome wealth in the little town of Araure, in the province of Barinas,\r\nupon the outskirts of the Llanos. Don José had a stalwart son, aged\r\nabout sixteen, whom he had trained to active usefulness amid the\r\nmonotonous ease of the torrid little municipality. Young Jose Antonio\r\nhad received, it is true, only a scanty education, but he could sign\r\nhis name, could verify a calculation, and had a shrewd, quick head for\r\nbusiness. The doctors-of-law, tolerably numerous even in little Araure,\r\npronounced him born for a jurist, and he was a godsend to the litigious\r\nnatives of the Captain-Generalcy. The hide-and-tallow merchants nodded\r\nknowingly, as he passed them in the street with a good-humored _Àdios_,\r\nand predicted great fortunes for the lad as a future man-of-business.\r\nThe Cura thought it a pity that he should prefer the society of the\r\ndusky beauties of Araure to the more hallowed enjoyments of preparation\r\nfor a priestly life. And all the while quite other destinies were held\r\nin store by Fate. The remissness of a mercantile correspondent of his\r\nfather altered the current of his life, and mightily influenced, even to\r\nthe present day, the fortunes of his country.\r\n\r\nA sum was owing to Don José by a trader of Capudare, and he intrusted\r\nhis son with the task of collecting the debt. One fine day, in the\r\nspring of 1807, the lad accordingly set out, in high spirits at his\r\nimportant mission, armed with a brace of pistols and a cutlass, and\r\nmounted on a trusty mule. The money was duly collected, but, as young\r\nJosé Antonio journeyed home with it, a rumor of his precious charge was\r\nspread, and he was beset in a lonely by-path by four highwaymen. The\r\npistols flashed from José's holsters, and one of the _churriones_ fell\r\nthe next moment with a bullet in his brain. Instantly presenting the\r\nsecond pistol, which was not loaded, he advanced upon the remaining\r\nthree, who fell back in consternation, and fled, panic-stricken, from\r\nthe boy. José Antonio was left alone with the highwayman's corpse. It\r\nwas no light thing in Venezuela to commit a homicide without testimony\r\nof innocence, and young José hastened homewards with his treasure, in a\r\nstate of trepidation far greater than any the living highwaymen could\r\nhave inspired. Even in his parents' dwelling, he dreaded, every moment,\r\nthe arrival of an order for his arrest, and to appease his groundless\r\nanxiety his father shortly suggested that he should take refuge upon the\r\nLlanos,--the Sherwood of Venezuelan Robin Hoods. The youth was delighted\r\nwith the idea, and engaged himself as herdsman in the service of Don\r\nManuel Pulido, a wealthy proprietor, whom he served so well that he was\r\nvery quickly advanced to a position of confidence and command. In a few\r\nmonths the slayer of the _churrion_ had learned to smile at his recent\r\napprehensions; but the wild life of the _hato_ had already thrown around\r\nhim its subtle fascination, and the sprightly youth of Araure had become\r\na naturalized son of the Plains. Soon few were able like young José to\r\nbreak an untried steed; few wielded more dexterously the lasso, or could\r\ndrive with more unerring force the jagged lance into the side of a\r\ngalloping bull. Clad in _poncho_ and _calzones_, he scoured the vast\r\nplain of La Calzada, acquiring, at the same time with manual dexterity\r\nand physical hardihood, the affections, still more important, of the\r\nwild Llaneros with whom only he associated. The lad of eighteen,\r\nscarcely two years a denizen of the Plains, possessed all the influence\r\nand authority of the hoariest Llanero; and now the predictions ran\r\nthat this daring José Antonio would one day be the most successful\r\ncattle-farmer in Venezuela!\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nEL TEMBLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must leave young José among his comrades of the _hato_ for a while,\r\nand glance at the contemporaneous doings of anointed heads, whose\r\ndestinies were strangely interwoven with his own.\r\n\r\nFar away across the Atlantic, in the shadow of the Pyrenees, events had\r\nbeen developing themselves to the consummation that should overturn a\r\nsplendid throne, shake Europe to its foundations, and electrify Spanish\r\nAmerica with a sympathetic current of revolution, flashing from the\r\npines of Oregon to the deserts of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious treachery of Bayonne was consummated. Joseph, brother\r\nof Napoleon, reigned on the throne of which King Charles had been\r\nperfidiously despoiled. Ferdinand, heir to the crown of Spain and the\r\nIndies, had scarcely heard himself proclaimed as the seventh monarch of\r\nthat name, when he had resigned his kingly functions to a Regency, and\r\nhastened into the snare which already held his father a captive on the\r\nsoil of France. The astounding intelligence arrived in different parts\r\nof South America during the year 1808. The effect was everywhere alike.\r\nOne moment of utter bewilderment, an instant's reeling under the shock\r\nof surprise, and then a magnificent outburst of loyalty from the\r\nsimple-hearted Creole population! _El Rey_, the King,--that almost\r\nmythical sovereign, who was ignorantly adored as the personification of\r\nwisdom and beneficence, no matter how cruelly Viceroys might misgovern,\r\nor Captains-General oppress,--was it possible to conceive him a captive,\r\nthe signer of his own humiliation, the renouncer of his immemorial\r\nrights? And Ferdinand, the young monarch of whom so little was known\r\nand so much expected,--he, too, a voluntary prisoner, while a Frenchman\r\nreigned in Madrid? This was news, indeed, to bewilder nations who\r\nhad hitherto remained content in infantile tutelage, unconscious,\r\nundesirous, of the rights of men! Addresses, fervent with loyalty, were\r\ndispatched to Spain, embodying vows of eternal affection towards the\r\nKing, and of detestation of Joseph, the usurper. French residents in\r\nVenezuela were publicly execrated by the excited Creoles; the French\r\nflag was insulted, and the French messengers were glad to escape with\r\ntheir lives from the hands of the infuriated Colonists. No Spanish\r\nmonarch ever had a firmer hold upon the Indies than Ferdinand VII. when\r\nSpain was lost to him in July and August, 1808.\r\n\r\nBut soon there came that inevitable question, first in the catechism of\r\nall human society: Whom shall we obey? The King, whose hand had weighed\r\nnot over lightly these many years, an abdicated prisoner at Bayonne;\r\nFerdinand yielding his authority into the hand of a nameless Regency,\r\nand his capital to the brother of the Corsican Emperor; Spain overrun\r\nby two hundred thousand foreign troops; messengers at hand from Joseph,\r\nfrom the Regency, from the Junta of the Asturias, from the Junta of\r\nSeville, each alike asserting its right to authority over the Colonies,\r\nas legitimate possessors of jurisdiction in Spain itself! The accession\r\nof Joseph, in fact, gave a momentary independence to Spanish America,\r\nand the royal governors were thrown upon their own resources for the\r\nmaintenance of their power. The Colonies were for the first time called\r\nupon to provide for their own defence,--solicited, not commanded, to\r\nobey; and they proved their loyalty by dispatching enormous sums in\r\ngold and silver to the Junta at Cadiz, as well as by their eagerness\r\nto ascertain in whom actually reposed the lawful government of Spain.\r\nGradually, however, the consciousness of their own entity stole over the\r\nVenezuelans and New Granadians, and they bethought them of establishing\r\nan administrative Junta of their own, until better times should dawn on\r\nSpain. Blindly imprudent, the Viceroy violently opposed the project,\r\nand with such troops as remained in the Colonies the first Juntas were\r\ndispersed or massacred. Squabbles ensued, until the citizens of Caracas\r\nquietly deposed the chief Colonial authorities, and appointed a\r\n_Junta Suprema_ to administer affairs in the name of Ferdinand VII.\r\nIntelligence of this step, however, was received with great alarm by the\r\nsapient Junta of Cadiz, and a proclamation was launched, on the 31st of\r\nAugust, 1810, declaring the Province of Caracas in a state of rigorous\r\nblockade. A war of manifestoes ensued, until the Provinces became\r\nenlightened as to their own importance and strength, and published, on\r\nthe 5th of July, 1811, the Declaration of their Independence. Scarcely\r\nwas this done when the Spanish Cortes offered liberal terms of\r\naccommodation, but they were rejected. The nation, that in 1808 thought\r\nit sweet to be subject, declared itself, three years later, for\r\nunqualified independence. The ardent revolutionist, General Miranda,\r\nwas placed in command of some hastily-levied forces, and took the field\r\nagainst the Spanish commander, Don Domingo Monteverde, who had assumed a\r\nhostile attitude immediately after the Declaration.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary here to say, that, after some hard-fought and\r\nhonorable fields, Miranda and his fellow-officers were completely\r\nsuccessful. All the principal cities were in the hands of the Patriots\r\nbefore 1812 began. Monteverde, in January of that year, was cooped up in\r\nthe remote province of Guiana, and Coro on the sea-coast was also held\r\nby his troops; but elsewhere the new Republic seemed fully established.\r\nAlready the point of Constitution-making--the crystallization-point of\r\nrepublics--had been reached. The ports of Venezuela were for the first\r\ntime opened to foreign trade. Her inhabitants were no longer restricted\r\nfrom the enjoyment of the fruits of their own industry. A gigantic\r\nsystem of taxation had been brushed, like a spider's web, away.\r\nTwo-thirds of the Captain-Generalcy, in a word, were free.\r\n\r\nThere was little fear among any of the inhabitants of Caracas, in March,\r\n1812, that they would again fall under the dominion of Spain. The\r\nCarnival had been celebrated with greater joyousness than in any year\r\nbefore; the proverbial gayety of the town was doubled during the\r\nconcluding festival of Shrove Tuesday; and Lent had scarcely thrown as\r\ndeep a shade as usual over the devoutest inhabitants of the city. Lent\r\ndrew to a close, and there was every prospect that Passion Week would\r\nbe succeeded by a season of rejoicing over impending defeats of the\r\nRoyalist _Goths_ in Coro and Guiana; and Passion Week came. Holy\r\nThursday fell on the 26th of March.\r\n\r\nThe solemn festival was ushered in with the most imposing rites of the\r\nChurch. In the great cathedral, which dwarfed all other buildings in the\r\nPlaza, there was high mass that day. The famous bell clanged out to all\r\nCaracas remembrance of the agony of our Lord. A silent multitude was\r\nprostrated all day long before the gorgeous altar. Prelates and priests\r\nand acolytes stood, splendid in vestments of purple and white and\r\ngold, solemnly celebrating upon the steps of the sanctuary the holiest\r\nmysteries of the Roman Catholic communion. Above and around, gigantic\r\ntapers flared from candlesticks of beaten gold; and every little while,\r\nthe glorious anthems floated forth in majestic cadence, eddying in waves\r\nof harmony about the colonnade that stretched in dusky perspective from\r\nthe great door to the altar, soaring above the distant arches, and\r\nswelling upwards in floods of melody, until the vast concavity of the\r\nvaulted nave was filled with a sea of sound. But a sultry heaviness\r\nweighed with the incense upon the air. Elder citizens glanced uneasily\r\nat one another, and the thoughts of many wandered anxiously from the\r\nsacred building. Outside, the streets were empty. All Caracas was\r\nengaged in public worship; and the white dwellings that inclosed the\r\nPlaza, with its converging avenues, looked silently down upon deserted\r\npavements, echoing only now and then to the careless tread of a party of\r\nnegroes, or to the clattering heel of some undevout trooper. The sun had\r\na glow as of molten copper; the atmosphere was dense; but not a cloud\r\noccupied the heavens. Towards evening the churches and the cathedral\r\nwere again emptied, and the throng of worshippers, streaming out into\r\nthe streets, prepared to witness the great religious procession that was\r\nto close the ceremonies of the holy day. Still the declining sun glowed\r\nwith unnatural intensity of hue; and the evening breeze swept over the\r\ntown in unusually fitful and stormy gusts. The air seemed to be laden\r\nwith mysterious melancholy, to sigh with a hidden presage of some awful\r\ncalamity to come.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden it came. A shudder, a tremor, a quivering shock ran, for\r\nhundreds of miles simultaneously, through Venezuela. A groan, swelling\r\nthunderously and threateningly into a hollow roar, burst from the\r\ntortured earth, and swallowed up in its convulsive rumbling the shrieks\r\nof an entire nation suddenly inwrapt in the shadow and agony of death.\r\nFor a moment,--as if a supernatural hand were painfully lifting it from\r\nits inmost core,--the earth rocked and heaved through all Venezuela; and\r\nthen, almost before the awful exclamation, _El temblor!_ had time to\r\nburst from the lips of that stricken nation, it bounded from the bonds\r\nthat held it, and in a moment was quaking, heaving, sliding, surging,\r\nrolling, in awful semblance to the sea. Great gulfs opened and closed\r\ntheir jaws, swallowing up and again belching forth dwellings, churches,\r\nhuman beings, overtaken by instantaneous destruction.\r\n\r\nA flash and a roar passed through the earth, and a jagged chasm followed\r\nin its track, creating others in its rapid clash and close. Whole\r\ncities shivered, tottered, reeled, and fell in spreading heaps of\r\nundistinguishable ruin. In one minute and fifteen seconds, twenty\r\nthousand human beings perished in Venezuela; and then the Earthquake of\r\nCaracas ceased.\r\n\r\nIt was after four o'clock in the afternoon when the first subterranean\r\nshock was felt; and long before five the agonized earth was still. Long\r\nbefore five, the stupefied survivors stood slowly recovering their\r\nfaculties of speech and motion. Long before five, a piteous wail\r\nascended to heaven from fathers and husbands and wives and mothers,\r\ndesolately mourning the dead in the streets of Caracas, La Guayra,\r\nMérida, San Felipe, and Valencia. In this manner the Holy Thursday of\r\n1812 drew toward its close. But the physical disasters consequent upon\r\nthe great earthquake were of insignificant import as compared with its\r\nmoral effect. Colonist and Spaniard had shared alike in suffering and\r\ndeath during those dreadful moments; but the superstitious population\r\nreadily accepted the interpretation which an eager priesthood placed\r\nupon the event, and bowed in the belief that they had suffered\r\nthe infliction in punishment of their rebellion against the King.\r\nNine-tenths of the clergy and monastic brotherhood inwardly hated\r\nand feared the Revolution, and their practised tongues drew terrible\r\nauguries for rebellious Venezuela from the recent throes and upheaval of\r\nthe earth. Preachers solemnly proclaimed the fact, that this, without\r\ndoubt, was a catastrophe akin to the memorable convulsion which once had\r\nswallowed up Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, for mutiny against the Lord; and\r\nthe proximate wrath of God could be appeased only by a retrogression\r\ninto his chosen paths. The people listened to the fathers, and obeyed\r\ntrembling. Miranda, who had struggled against and overcome the material\r\npower of his enemies, was impotent when confronted by spiritual terrors;\r\nand after a few languid combats, his troops deserted, leaving Monteverde\r\nto triumph once more in the assertion of Spanish authority over every\r\nprovince of Venezuela. His headquarters were established at Caracas,\r\nand there, as well as elsewhere, his troops revelled in the perfidious\r\ntorture and execution of their capitulated foes. During nearly two\r\nyears, Monteverde reigned in Venezuela.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nGUERRA Á LA MUERTE!\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, towards the close of 1813, the star of liberty glimmered once\r\nmore from the summits of the Western Cordillera. During and after the\r\nmemorable earthquake, the city of Puerto Cabello, at that time held by\r\nthe Patriots, was under the command of a young colonel in the Republican\r\nservice, who had devoted a portion of his immense patrimonial wealth\r\nto the culture of his intellectual powers in European travel, (not,\r\nhowever, without subsequently applying a large share to the necessities\r\nof his country,) and whose name was Simon Bolívar. The treachery of an\r\nofficer delivered the citadel of Puerto Cabello into the hands of some\r\nSpanish prisoners who were there confined, and in June, 1812, Colonel\r\nBolívar was compelled to evacuate the town with all his force. While\r\nMonteverde lorded it over his country, he took refuge in the neighboring\r\nislands, and afterwards in New Granada, where he conceived the daring\r\nproject which freed Venezuela, and has perpetuated, with his name, the\r\nsimple but expressive title: Liberator, _Libertador_.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose here to follow the intrepid partisan in his\r\ndescent, with six hundred New Granadian adherents, from the Andes, upon\r\nthe astounded Spaniards. We cannot follow him, nor the generals whom\r\nhe created, in their marvellous marches, and still more marvellous\r\ntriumphs, during many succeeding years. Suffice it to say, that he\r\nfell like a thunderbolt from a sunny sky upon the confident Royalist\r\ntroops,--that he defeated and routed them time after time, broke, with\r\nhis terrible lancers, upon encampments which believed him a hundred\r\nmiles away, and drove the Royal commanders, with varying success, from\r\none point to another of Venezuela. His watchword was, _Guerra á la\r\nmuerte_, \"War unto death!\" Every battle-ground became a shamble, every\r\nflight a butchery. The system was inaugurated by his antagonists, who\r\ncruelly slew eight Patriot officers, and eight citizens of Barinas,\r\nshortly after the commencement of hostilities, under circumstances of\r\npeculiar barbarity. Thenceforward Bolívar's men took no prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Wellington had driven the French across the Pyrenees,\r\nand Ferdinand the Adored ruled once more in Madrid. Even now, judicious\r\nmanagement might have secured again the allegiance of the Colonies; but\r\nthe first action of Ferdinand was to vituperate his American subjects\r\nas rebels, whom he commanded to lay down their arms at once; and on\r\nthe 18th of February, 1815, there sailed from Cadiz a stately armament\r\nintended to enforce this peremptory order. Sixty-five vessels composed\r\nthe fleet, bearing six regiments of infantry, one of dragoons, the\r\nQueen's hussars, artillery, sappers and miners, engineers, and eighteen\r\npieces of cannon, besides incalculable quantities of arms and munitions\r\nof war. The expedition numbered fifteen thousand men, and was commanded\r\nin chief by the famous soldier, General Don Pablo Morillo, the guerilla\r\nchampion, the opposer of the French.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of April, this redoubtable army effected a landing; and once\r\nmore, all but an insignificant fraction of Venezuela fell under the hand\r\nof Spain. The flood of successful rebellion was rolled back from the\r\ncoast, and Bolívar, with his dauntless partisans, was soon confined to\r\nthe Llanos, which stretch away in level immensity from the marshy banks\r\nof the Orinoco, the Apure, and their tributaries.\r\n\r\nOur readers have already been introduced to these Llanos, and have\r\nbeheld their wild inhabitants amid the monotonous avocations of a time\r\nof peace. Let us now approach them while the \"blood-red blossom of war\"\r\nblazes up from their torrid vegetation. Let us descend upon them at\r\nnight, here, at no great distance from the banks of the cayman-haunted\r\nApure, and we shall gaze upon a different scene. All around us, the\r\nplain extends in the same desolate immensity that we noticed when we\r\nlooked upon it from the _hato_; still, as before, we see it covered with\r\na dense wilderness of reedy grasses that overtop the tallest trooper\r\nin Morillo's army; as before, we notice the scattered palm-islands,\r\nbreaking here and there the uniformity of level; and hosts of cattle and\r\nwild horses are still roaming over the plain.\r\n\r\nNear a _mata_, or grove of palm-trees, there is a sound of merry voices\r\nto-night. Fires are crackling here and there; huge strips of fresh beef\r\nare roasting on wooden spits; the long grass has been trodden flat in\r\na wide circumference, and three or four rudely-constructed huts of\r\npalm-branches close the scene on one side. Five hundred men are\r\ncollected here,--the élite of the liberators of Venezuela. Gathered\r\nabout their camp-fires, these troopers, who have ridden a hundred miles\r\nsince morning, are enjoying rest, refreshment, and recreation. But the\r\nword trooper must not conjure up a vision of belted horsemen, rigid in\r\nuniform, with clanking sabres, and helmets of brass. Of a far different\r\nstamp are the figures reclining before us. These are improvised\r\nwarriors, _hateros_, cattle-farmers, who, grasping their lances and\r\nlassos, have eagerly exchanged the monotony of pastoral life for the\r\nwild excitement of the charge upon Spanish squadrons, and the ferocious\r\nslaughter of fellow-men. No two of this invincible band are clad\r\nalike. Here is a sergeant, wearing an old and dilapidated blanket\r\nponcho-fashion, with the remains of a palm-leaf hat sheltering his head,\r\nand with limbs which a pair of ragged _calzones_ make only a pretence of\r\ncovering. Yet over his left shoulder is slung a gorgeous hussar jacket,\r\nwhich he wears with the greater pride since it belonged last night to a\r\nlieutenant in the Queen's regiment, whom he slew in cold blood after the\r\nfight! Next to him leans a private, bare-legged and bare-headed, wearing\r\nonly an old piece of carpet about his waist, a flannel shirt, and the\r\nuniform coat of a Spanish officer, from which he has cut the right\r\nsleeve in order to secure greater freedom for his arm. A third has made\r\nhimself a suit which Robinson Crusoe might have envied. Helmet, jerkin,\r\nbreeches, sandals, all have been cut from the same raw bull's hide! His\r\nneighbor, a new recruit, still wears the national dress of his order,\r\nwhich has not yet been tattered and torn from him by long service; and\r\nhe is the envy of the motley troop. But the lack of uniformity in no\r\nwise detracts from valor, nor does it diminish the gayety of these\r\nterrible lancers as they lie idly grouped about the flickering fires.\r\nHalf-a-dozen circles are absorbed in as many games at cards; others\r\nare swallowing greedily some improvised fantastic tale; and some are\r\nsinging, in wild, irregular cadence, the favorite songs of the Plains.\r\nTheir example soon becomes contagious, and group after group chimes in\r\nwith the uproarious chant. Listen! From the farthest extremity of the\r\nencampment comes a querying solo:--\r\n\r\n\"De todos los Generales cual es el valiente?\"\r\n\r\nand from five hundred throats the response is thundered:--\r\n\r\n\"Mi General Paez con toda su gente!\"\r\n\r\nAgain the solo demands:--\r\n\r\n\"De todos los Generales cual es el major?\"\r\n\r\nand the tumultuous answer is vociferated:--\r\n\r\n\"Es mi General José con su guardia de honor!\"\r\n\r\nAnd who may be the valiant General, the General with his guard of honor,\r\nexcelling all the rest? This, we learn, is the guard of honor; the\r\nGeneral is José Antonio Paez, little José Antonio who killed the\r\nhighwayman and betook himself to cattle farming on the Plains! Now,\r\nhowever, he is the famous Llanero chieftain, favorite champion of\r\nVenezuela, brother-in-arms of Bolívar, who allows him, alone of all\r\nthe military leaders, the privilege of an especial body-guard. Since\r\n1810,--for five years,--he has been fighting constantly in his country's\r\nservice, and has won himself fame while our eyes have been turned in\r\nother directions. Look! he is standing there, at the entrance to his\r\nhut, while the chorus yet echoes among the palm-branches. Scarcely of\r\nmiddle stature, certainly not more than five feet four in height,--but\r\nbroad-shouldered, muscular, with a constitution of iron, equal to\r\nperpetual exertion, capable of every fatigue. His countenance is open\r\nand prepossessing, his features rounded, forehead square, eyes piercing\r\nand intelligent. Like his men, he wears a motley garb,--part Spanish\r\nuniform, part costume of the Llanos; and he leans upon a lance,\r\ndecorated with a black bannerol, which has carried death already to\r\ninnumerable Loyalist hearts. Thus José Antonio Paez stands before us, on\r\nthe banks of the Apure, in the twenty-fifth year of his age.\r\n\r\nHe has perhaps been hitherto too much neglected by us, and we must look\r\nbackwards in order to take up the thread of his career. At the very\r\nfirst outbreak of insurrection in 1810, Paez took service as a volunteer\r\nin the hastily-levied militia of Barinas, and was quickly promoted to\r\nthe post of sergeant in a corps of lancers. His influence and example\r\nattracted multitudes of Llanero horsemen to the Revolutionary ranks,\r\nbut the calamitous period of the earthquake put an end to his military\r\nservice, and he returned, in 1812, to his pastoral post. Soon, however,\r\ncame news of Bolívar fighting from the mountains of New Granada; and in\r\n1813 Paez was once more in the saddle, with the commission, this time,\r\nof captain in the Patriot service. The Spaniards soon learned to dread\r\nthe fiery lancer of Barinas. They were never safe from his sudden\r\nonslaught; and Puy, the commandant of the Province, rejoiced loudly when\r\nan unlucky defeat placed the indefatigable _guerrillero_ in his power.\r\nPaez was condemned to be shot, and was actually led out, with\r\nother prisoners, to the place of execution; but a concatenation of\r\nextraordinary accidents saved his life, and he escaped once more to the\r\nhead of his command. It was not long before he was brought in immediate\r\ncontact with the now famous Bolívar, and he rapidly rose to independent\r\ncommand. In 1815, he was second only to the Liberator. Thousands of grim\r\nLlaneros acknowledged no chieftain beside _el Tio Pepe_,--Uncle Joe.\r\nWhen Morillo landed, in 1815, with his overwhelming force, only the\r\nLlaneros of Paez held out for the Republic; everywhere else in Venezuela\r\nthe banner of Spain waved in triumph, but on the Plains of the Apure\r\nthere was neither submission nor peace. Yet, after a while, as the\r\nvictorious legions of Morillo flooded, in successive waves from the\r\ncoast, the level region of his refuge, Paez was compelled to evacuate\r\nthe Plains, and leave them to the invader. With a few hundred of his\r\nhorsemen he established himself on the Plains of New Granada. Scarcely\r\nhad he grown familiar with his new centre of action when the troops of\r\nMorillo were turned westward for the purpose of curbing the rebellious\r\nspirits in the neighboring Vice-Royalty,--when, quicker than thought,\r\nPaez was once more over the mountains, and recovered by a sudden swoop\r\nthe Llanos of Barinas. Thenceforward, this region remained the surest\r\nfoothold of the revolution in Venezuela. Encircled with Spanish troops,\r\nit remained, nevertheless, a practical republic in itself, and the\r\nvast basin of the Orinoco was the cradle of Venezuelan freedom. The\r\nProvisional Government consisted of a mere council of generals, who, in\r\n1816, created Paez General and Supreme Chief of the Republic. A vast\r\nstride from the _hatero's_ hut that we saw him inhabiting in 1808!\r\n\r\nPaez resigned this dignity in favor of Bolívar in the following year,\r\ncontenting himself with his great military command. Surrounded by the\r\nbody-guard we have seen, through all the years 1816, 1817, and 1818, now\r\nin Venezuela, now in New Granada, in the Plains to-day, in the mountains\r\nto-morrow, enduring every privation, braving odds apparently the most\r\noverwhelming, fighting pitched battles at midnight, and triumphantly\r\neffecting surprises in the open day, he maintained alive, in the midst\r\nof general discouragement, the cause he had espoused. Bolívar, the\r\nLiberator, was meanwhile endeavoring to make head against the Spaniards\r\nelsewhere, and gathered a considerable force in the interior province of\r\nGuiana. In 1818, the vanguard of the British legion--troops browned by\r\nthe sun of Spain, who had marched with Wellington from Lisbon to the\r\nPyrenees, and who gladly accepted the offers of the Patriots when\r\nWaterloo had put an end to European strife--sailed up the Orinoco, and\r\neffected a junction with the assembled Patriot forces.\r\n\r\nAt this time, not only the whole of New Granada, but the entire\r\nsea-coast of Venezuela and every important city in the Republic were\r\npossessed by Morillo. Yet the Royalist cause made no progress. Morillo's\r\ndominion was like that famous Haarlem lake which occupied so large an\r\nextent of the lands of Holland; it might be great and threatening, but\r\nbarriers insurmountable, though unpretending, forbade its expansion, and\r\nperseverance gradually succeeded in curtailing its limits. Whatever the\r\nhand of Morillo covered, he possessed; but his authority ceased outside\r\nthe range of his guns. His men were growing weary of the struggle; few\r\nreinforcements came from Spain; and the troops suffered frightfully,\r\nthrough their constant fatigues and hardships. The war had become\r\nthat most terrible of all wars,--a deliberate system of surprises and\r\nskirmishes. Paez here, Bolívar there, Monágas, Piar, Urdaneta, and a\r\nscore of other chieftains, at every vulnerable point, harassed, without\r\nceasing, the common foe.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Bolívar set out upon that marvellous expedition across the\r\nAndes in which, by marching one thousand miles and fighting three\r\npitched battles in somewhat less than eleven weeks, he finally liberated New\r\nGranada, and secured a vast amount of Spanish treasure and munitions of\r\nwar. During his absence, Paez was left to keep Morillo in check on the\r\neast of the Cordillera. His plan of operations was, to be everywhere,\r\nand to do everything with his lancers. Venezuela clung with terrible\r\ntenacity to the idea of freedom; and the Republic was converted into two\r\ngreat camps, perpetually shifting their boundaries, yet ever presenting\r\nthe same features. Trade and commerce were at an end; the only business\r\nthought of was that of war unto death. Death, everywhere; death, at all\r\ntimes; death, in every shape. By the sword and the lance, by famine,\r\nby drowning, by fire, decimated by fever, worn out by fatigue, the\r\nSpaniards perished. When their convoys failed or were intercepted, it\r\nwas impossible to obtain food; no foraging-party dared venture forth\r\nfrom the fortified encampment; it was necessary that an entire division\r\nshould march out into the Llanos, and seek for the nearest herd of\r\ncattle. It not unfrequently happened, in these expeditions, that\r\nthe very cattle were enlisted on the Patriot side. Herds of several\r\nthousands of the savage beasts were sometimes driven headlong upon the\r\nSpanish lines, throwing them into confusion, and trampling or goring\r\ngreat numbers to death. Close in the rear of the resistless herd then\r\ncharged the lancers of Paez, with the terrible black bannerol fluttering\r\nin the van. Before the scattered Royalists have time to rally, they are\r\nattacked in every direction by their merciless foes,--and in another\r\nminute the battle is over, and the men of the Plains are out of sight!\r\nSometimes, too, a detachment traversing the savanna would notice with\r\naffright a column of thin smoke stealing up into the sky a mile to\r\nwindward; and almost before the bugle or the drum could summon them\r\nto arms, the flames would be seething and crackling around them, and\r\nroaring away, in an ocean of fire, across the savanna beyond. And then,\r\nin the rear of the flames, dashed the bloodthirsty lancers, and the\r\nblackened embers of the grass turned red with the richness of Spanish\r\nveins! No venture was too arduous for the Llanero chieftain. He\r\naccomplished at one time an exploit in which only the multiplicity of\r\nwitnesses who have testified to the achievement permits us to believe.\r\nSan Fernando, an important town on the Apure, was strongly fortified,\r\nand was held by the Spaniards as a potent means of annoying the Patriots\r\nin any attempts they might make to cross the river. In order further to\r\ndefend the passage, six large river-boats, each containing a piece of\r\nartillery, were anchored at a short distance below the only ford. But\r\nit became necessary that the Apure should be crossed, and Paez quietly\r\nundertook to secure the passage. With a few of his lancers, he rode to\r\nthe river-bank, and there gave the command, _Al agua, muchachos!_ \"To\r\nthe water, boys!\" which he was accustomed to use when ordering his men\r\nto bathe. His meaning was at once apprehended. The men, stripping off\r\ntheir upper clothing, and holding their swords under their arms, plunged\r\ninto the stream, shouting loudly to keep off the alligators, and partly\r\nrode, partly swam, nearly half a mile towards the gun-boats. Only the\r\nheads of horses and men were visible above the water, and the crews\r\nof the gun-boats, after a single discharge, which wounded none of the\r\nextraordinary attacking party, threw themselves into the river and made\r\nthe best of their way to San Fernando, where they alleged that it was\r\nuseless to contest possession of their charge with incarnate devils,\r\nto whom water was the same us dry land, and who butchered all their\r\nprisoners. The gun-boats were navigated in triumph to the Patriot camp,\r\nand did excellent service in ferrying the troops across the Apure.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nLIBERTAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the year 1820 the Revolutionists had for the third time perceptibly\r\ngained ground, and Morillo's force, spread like a fan at the inland base\r\nof the sierra, was gradually yielding to the unceasing pressure;--in a\r\nword, the Patriots were at length driving their enemies into the sea.\r\nTowards the close of 1820, Morillo opened negotiations with their\r\nchiefs, and a suspension of hostilities was commenced on the 26th of\r\nNovember, when the Spanish general gladly quitted the scene of his\r\nfruitless efforts, and retired to Spain with the title of Count of\r\nCarthagena, leaving Generals Morales and La Torre in authority behind\r\nhim. The armistice was not prolonged. The Congress of Colombia, as the\r\nunited republics of Venezuela and New Granada were then termed, demanded\r\nunqualified independence as the price of peace; and in June--the Battle\r\nMonth--of 1821, Bolívar and Paez took up arms once more. The Spanish\r\ntroops were concentrated at the base of the mountains, with Valencia and\r\nCaracas in their rear. Before them, the road wound westward, through\r\ntortuous passes, towards Tinaquilla and Barinas, at the former of which\r\nplaces Bolívar with his forces was now halting. Six thousand men were\r\nin arms on either side; but the troops of the Republic, though ragged,\r\nill-fed, and badly armed, were flushed with the consciousness of success\r\nand the presentiment of triumph, while those of Spain were dispirited,\r\nworn out, and malcontent.\r\n\r\nIt was plain to the meanest trooper, however, that Carabobo must be\r\nheld; and on intelligence of the Patriot advance, the position, of\r\namazing strength, was resolutely occupied. It seemed, indeed, that a\r\nregiment could defend such a pass with ease against an army. In order\r\nto debouch upon the Plain of Carabobo, the Patriots must penetrate a\r\ndefile, forming a narrow and tortuous pass, the road through which was\r\na mere seam at the base of a deep ravine. This narrow passage, through\r\nwhich, of necessity, Bolívar's troops must march in straggling line,\r\nterminated abruptly in a basin or valley shut in by hills, except\r\nupon the northeast, where it opened upon the boundless expanse of the\r\ncontested plain. At the mouth of this gorge La Torre lay with all\r\nhis force. Despite the unfavorable condition of his men, with whom,\r\nmoreover, he was not popular, the odds seemed overwhelmingly in his\r\nfavor. He stood on the defensive, in one of the strongest of military\r\npositions, and well provided with artillery, while his adversary was to\r\nstruggle through a narrow valley in the face of his opponents, before\r\na single man could be made available. The mouth of this valley was\r\nblockaded by the Spanish infantry, who stretched in silent lines from\r\nside to side in the evening of the 23d of June. On either flank, the\r\nhills were occupied by corps of riflemen, and the artillery was posted\r\nat their base. No force, it appeared, could enter the beleaguered valley\r\nand live. Bolívar commenced his passage through the defile on the\r\nmorning of the 24th, and halted in dismay as he reached the outlet. It\r\nwas too apparent that such a conflict as lay before him could not be\r\nbraved. At this moment Paez learned that a narrow side-path existed,\r\npermitting the passage of a single file, which led, by a _détour_, to\r\nthe plain. It was one of those curious accidents on which the fate of\r\nbattles seems to hang; and after some hesitation, Bolívar permitted Paez\r\nto venture the passage. Heading the famous Battalion of Apure, he at\r\nonce wheeled to the left, and commenced the toilsome march. One by one\r\nthe veterans struggled through the pass, but they were discovered by La\r\nTorre before they issued upon the plain.\r\n\r\nAlthough taken entirely by surprise, the Spaniards had time for a\r\npartial change of front, and before the veterans of Apure had assembled\r\nat the mouth of the pass, a volley of musketry rang out from the Spanish\r\nlines, and the gleaming of bayonets told of a wall of steel across the\r\npath. The scanty force of Paez, however, dashed from the ravine, and,\r\nforming hastily, rushed upon the enemy. Four Royalist battalions\r\nconverged upon them, and they were crushed. They fell back, flying in\r\ndisorder, and the Spaniards were on the point of securing the pass,\r\nwhen a shout arose before them that made the stoutest quail. With\r\none ever-memorable cheer, a long hurrah, which spoke of well-known\r\nunconquerable determination, the British legion, less than eight hundred\r\nstrong, with their Colonel, John Ferrier, at their head, appeared at the\r\nmouth of the ravine. Forming instantaneously and in perfect silence,\r\nbut with the accuracy of a regiment on parade, they threw forward their\r\nbayonets, and knelt down, sedately, calmly, immovably, to confront\r\ndestruction. The remaining troops of Bolívar were in their rear,\r\ntraversing slowly the defile; and until they reached its mouth, that\r\nliving wall of Anglo-Saxon valor neither stirred nor blenched. Volley\r\nafter volley enfiladed their ranks, and, after each discharge, the mass\r\nof men was smaller. Still their cool and ceaseless firing rolled death\r\ninto the ranks of the enemy, until at length the troops whom they had\r\nsaved from destruction rallied once more. Then, what remained of the\r\nlegion, headed by the two or three officers whose lives had been\r\nmarvellously preserved, rushed fiercely forward like an avenging flame,\r\nand swept before them the affrighted Spaniards, wildly scattering at\r\nthe onslaught which it was impossible to withstand. In another moment,\r\neighty or ninety of the lancers of Paez issued from the ravine, and,\r\nhurling themselves upon the broken enemy, turned the defeat into an\r\nutter rout. La Torre's troops, with the exception of one regiment, fled\r\nin disgraceful confusion, or perished by hundreds under the lances\r\nof the implacable pursuers; and on the evening of the 24th of June,\r\nBolívar, encamped upon the Plain of Carabobo, laid his hand upon the\r\nshoulder of José Antonio Paez, thenceforward General-in-chief of the\r\nArmies of the Republic of Colombia!\r\n\r\nCarabobo decided the War of Independence throughout South America. It\r\nsnapped the chain which held Venezuela down, and the Spaniards, hemmed\r\nin for two years longer at Puerto Cabello, which place they defended\r\nwith honorable pertinacity, were finally expelled from the free Republic\r\nin November, 1823. The city was taken by storm on the 7th of that month,\r\nand on the 9th the citadel surrendered. General Calzada, the commandant,\r\nwith all his officers, and four hundred men, was shortly afterwards\r\nshipped for Spain.\r\n\r\nHere the career of the Llanero closes. A new and still more brilliant\r\navenue to distinction opens before Paez. At this, however, we can\r\nscarcely glance. Our business has been to study him in the saddle,\r\nwielding lasso and sword and lance; nor have we left ourselves room\r\nfor adequate allusion to his subsequent life as President and private\r\ncitizen, deliverer of his country, and exile in these Northern States.\r\nYet the record could not be called complete, unless we passed briefly in\r\nreview the vicissitudes of the past thirty years.\r\n\r\nAfter the taking of Puerto Cabello, Paez administered the affairs of\r\nVenezuela as Provisional Chief of the State, and held that office under\r\nthe Congress of Colombia, until the two republics were dissevered in\r\n1830, when he was elected first President of Venezuela. Only partially\r\ndisturbed by a military insurrection, headed by the turbulent General\r\nJosé T. Monágas, which was soon suppressed, the administration of Paez\r\nwas such as surprised all lookers-on in America and Europe. He displayed\r\nadministrative talents of a high order, with all the firmness and\r\nresolution of a soldier, yet with all the business capacity and peaceful\r\nproclivities of a civilian.\r\n\r\nLaying down the Presidential office in 1834, he was again called upon\r\nto assume it four years later, and until the close of 1842 Venezuela\r\nprospered under his direction. The foreign and domestic debt was\r\nliquidated by the products of national industry, and three millions of\r\ndollars were left in the treasury on the accession to the Presidency\r\nof General Soublette, in 1843. Honors had rained on the _ci-devant_\r\nimpetuous horseman, whose shout had once so frequently been the prelude\r\nto slaughter and devastation. William the Fourth of England presented\r\nGeneral Paez, in 1837, with a sword of honor; Louis Philippe of France\r\ninvested him, in 1843, with the Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honor; and\r\ntwo years later, there arrived from Oscar of Sweden the Cross of the\r\nMilitary Order of the Sword.\r\n\r\nBut in 1850, and thenceforward, until 1858, José Antonio Paez trod the\r\nstreets of New York as an exile from his native land.\r\n\r\nGeneral José T. Monágas was elected President of Venezuela in 1848, and\r\ncreated dissatisfaction by his course of action. Paez placed himself\r\nat the head of an insurrectionary movement against him, and, being\r\ndefeated, was imprisoned in the city of Valencia. General Monágas,\r\ninfluenced, it is probable, by feelings of ancient friendship, and\r\nremembering the pardon extended to himself on a former similar occasion,\r\ncontented himself with a decree of exile against the captive veteran,\r\nand Paez embarked for St. Thomas on the 24th of May, 1850. He passed\r\nfrom St. Thomas to the United States.\r\n\r\nAll, whose memories extend so far back as the year 1850, remember the\r\novation received in New York by the exiled chief. New York grants an\r\novation to every one; and Monágas would, doubtless, have been received\r\nwith the same demonstration, had the breath of adverse fortune blown him\r\nhither, instead of his antagonist.\r\n\r\nAfter the first effervescence produced by the dropping of a notability\r\ninto the caldron of New York, the Llanero general was permitted to enjoy\r\nhis placid domesticity without molestation; and in a pleasant street,\r\nfar up-town among the Twenties, he lived in the midst of us for eight\r\nquiet years. A curious serenity of evening, for a life so turbulent and\r\nincarnadined in its beginning! How many of the thousands who were\r\nwont to pass the stout old soldier, with his seamed forehead and gray\r\nmoustache, as he enjoyed his quiet stroll down Broadway, thought of him\r\nas the lad of Araure, the horseman of Barinas, terror of the Spaniard,\r\nvictor of Carabobo, and President of Venezuela? But though retired and\r\nunpretending in his exile, Paez was not neglected in New York; and the\r\nprocession which followed him, but a few weeks since, to the steamer\r\ndestined to bear him back to his native land,--a procession saddened, it\r\nis true, by the feeble condition to which an accident had temporarily\r\nreduced the chieftain,--showed that his solid worth was recognized and\r\nhonored.\r\n\r\nNot yet, however, is it time for the summing-up of his history. The\r\nexile of 1850 has been solicited to return to his country, and the\r\nninth anniversary of banishment may find him occupying once more the\r\nPresidential chair. General Monágas having been deposed in March, 1858,\r\nrepeated invitations were dispatched, by the Provisional Government, to\r\nPaez, entreating his return; and, after much cautious hesitation, he\r\nresolved, in the following September, to comply with the request.\r\nSubsequent events belong rather to the chronology of the day than to the\r\npage of history we have thrown open here. Our task is at an end; the\r\ncareer of the Llanero has been unfolded; we have placed ourselves in the\r\npresence of the comrade of Bolívar, and have witnessed the rise of the\r\nVenezuelan Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLS AND BEARS.\r\n\r\n[Continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSHOWING AT WHAT COST OUR HERO ESCAPED DROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boat lay at the wharf, a pretty little craft of six or eight tons,\r\nwith a mainsail and jib. It was a delightful afternoon; a gentle\r\nwesterly wind swept over a placid sea, and the sky was as clear as the\r\nmirror that reflected its exquisite blue. Greenleaf and Miss Sandford\r\ntook their seats amidships, leaving the stern for the boatman. The\r\nropes were cast off, and the sailor was about stepping aboard, when it\r\nwas discovered that the fishing-lines had been left behind. Old Tarry\r\nwas dispatched to bring them, and he rolled off as fast as his habitual\r\ngait allowed him. When he was fairly up the hill, Miss Sandford said,--\r\n\r\n\"You know how to sail a boat, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Greenleaf, \"I have frequently been out alone; but I thought\r\nI would not take the responsibility of a more precious freight.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be delightful to have a sail by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charming, truly! Our salt-water friend may be a very estimable person,\r\nbut we should be freer to talk in his absence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose you try it. I will sit here, and you take his place.\"\r\n\r\nGreenleaf hesitated; the proposal was a tempting one, but he had no\r\ngreat confidence in his own skill.\r\n\r\n\"The sea is like a pond,\" continued his companion. \"We can sail out a\r\nshort distance, and then return for our pilot, if we like.\"\r\n\r\nGreenleaf allowed himself to be persuaded. He shoved off the boat,\r\nhoisted sail, and they were soon lightly skimming the waters of the bay.\r\nThey rounded the rocky point and stood for the eastward. Their boatman\r\nsoon appeared on the shore and made frantic gestures to no purpose; they\r\nlooked back and rather enjoyed his discomfiture.\r\n\r\nNever did the sea have such a fascination for Greenleaf. He held the\r\nrudder and drew the sheets with a feeling of proud mastery, deeper and\r\nmore exciting than the horseman feels on the back of his steed. These\r\nfirst emotions, however, gradually lost their intensity, and he resigned\r\nhimself to the measureless content which the gentle motion, the bland\r\nair, and the sunny sky inspired.\r\n\r\nWhat had been the character of Miss Sandford's regard for Greenleaf\r\nhitherto would he a difficult question to answer; it is doubtful whether\r\nshe knew, herself. She had been pleased with his conversation and\r\nmanners, flattered by his graceful and not too obsequious attentions,\r\nand proud of his success in his art. Living upon the pleasures of the\r\nday, without a thought of the future, she had never seriously reflected\r\nupon the consequences of her flirtation, supposing that, as in every\r\nformer case, there would come a time of _ennui_ and coolness. Besides,\r\nshe had felt the force of her prudent sister-in-law's suggestion, that a\r\nman without an estate would never be able to supply the necessities of a\r\nwoman of fashion. With all her _quasi_ advances a degree of reserve\r\nwas mingled, and she persuaded herself that she should never become\r\nentangled beyond the power of retreat. But Greenleaf was not an easy\r\nconquest. She was aware of her influence over him, and employed all her\r\narts to win and secure his devotion; as long as the least indifference\r\non his part remained, she was unsatisfied. But in this protracted effort\r\nshe had drifted unconsciously from her own firm anchorage. Day by day\r\nhis society had grown more and more necessary to her, and her habitual\r\ncaution was more and more neglected. The conduct of Greenleaf, without\r\nany design on his part, had been such as to draw her on irresistibly,\r\nuntil their positions had become reversed; she was now fascinated beyond\r\nself-control, and without a thought of the future, while he was merely\r\nagreeable, but inwardly cool and self-possessed. Still at times the\r\nstrange thrills returned as the soft light of her eyes fell upon him,\r\nand the intoxication he felt at his first meeting with her again drowned\r\nhis senses in delight.\r\n\r\nThey did not talk very freely that summer's day. The heart when full\r\nrarely pours itself out in words. A look, a pressure of the hand, or (if\r\nsuch improprieties are to be imagined) a kiss, expresses the emotions\r\nfar better than the most glowing speech. It was enough for Marcia,\r\nsteeped in delicious languor, to sway with the rocking boat, to feel the\r\nsoft wind dallying with her hair, and to look with unutterable fondness\r\nat her companion.\r\n\r\nAs long as the ceremonies of society are observed, and people are kept\r\nasunder a room's distance, so that only the mind acts, and the senses\r\nare in repose, reserve may keep up its barrier. Words lose their\r\nelectricity in passing through a cool tract of air, and Reason shows all\r\nthings in her own clear white light. But establish a magnetic circle by\r\ncontact, let hand rest in quivering hand, while eye looks into melting\r\neye, and Reason may as well resign her sway. When the nerves tingle,\r\nthe heart bounds, and the breath quickens, estates, honors, family,\r\nprudence, are of little worth. The Grundys, male and female, may go\r\nhang; the joy of the present so transcends all memory, so eclipses hope\r\neven, that all else is forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe boat careened somewhat, and Marcia changed her seat to the opposite\r\nside, quite near to Greenleaf. His right hand held the tiller,--his\r\nleft, quite unconsciously, it would seem, fell into her open palm. The\r\nsubtile influence ran through every fibre. What he said he did not know,\r\nonly that he verged towards the momentous subject, and committed himself\r\nso far that he must either come plainly to the point or apologize and\r\nwithdraw as best he might. _Could_ he withdraw, while, as he held her\r\nsoft hand, that lambent fire played along his nerves? He did not give up\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\nPoor little Alice! Her picture in his breast-pocket no longer weighed\r\nupon his heart.\r\n\r\nThe breeze freshened, the boat rose and fell with easy motion over the\r\nwhitening waves. The sun all at once was obscured. They looked behind\r\nthem; a heavy black cloud was rising rapidly in the west. Greenleaf put\r\nthe boat about, and, as it met the shock of the sea, they were covered\r\nwith spray. To go back in the wind's eye was clearly impossible; they\r\nmust beat up, and, hauling as close to the wind as possible, they stood\r\ntowards Swampscot. For a mile or two they held this course, and then\r\ntacked. But making very little headway in that direction, the bow was\r\nturned northward again. In coming about they shipped so much water, that\r\nMarcia, though by no means a coward, screamed out, \"We are lost!\"\r\nShe flung herself into the bottom of the boat and laid her head in\r\nGreenleaf's lap like a frightened child. He soothed her and denied that\r\nthere was danger; he did not venture to tack again, however, for fear of\r\nbeing swamped, but determined to run northwardly along the coast in the\r\nhope of getting ashore on some sandy beach before the fury of the storm\r\nshould come. The boat now careened so far that her gunwale was under\r\nwater; he saw that he must take in the mainsail. With some difficulty he\r\npersuaded Marcia to hold the tiller while he let go the halliards. The\r\nmainsail came down with a run, and the boat kept on with the jib only,\r\nthough of course at a slower rate. They were still two or three miles\r\nfrom shore, and the storm increased momently. They saw Lynn Beach\r\nwithout hope of gaining it, the wind driving them northward. Neither\r\ncould Greenleaf run into the little bay of Swampscot. In spite of his\r\nefforts the boat shot by Phillips's Point, and he must therefore run\r\nupon the rocks beyond the Point or make for Marblehead harbor. But the\r\nlatter was an untried and dangerous course for an inexperienced boatman,\r\nand, grim as the coast looked, he was obliged to trust to its tender\r\nmercies for the chance of getting ashore. The rain now fell in blinding\r\ntorrents and a blackness as of night brooded over the sea. Greenleaf\r\nwas utterly bewildered, but held on to the tiller with his aching,\r\nstiffening hand, and strove to inspire his companion with courage. The\r\nboat was \"down by the head,\" on account of the wind's drawing the jib,\r\nand rolled and plunged furiously. Behind were threatening billows, and\r\nbefore were ragged, precipitous rocks, around which the surges boiled\r\nand eddied. Greenleaf quailed as he neared the awful coast; his heart\r\nstood still as he thought of the peril to a helpless woman in clambering\r\nup those cliffs, even if she were not drowned before reaching them.\r\nEvery flash of lightning seemed to disclose some new horror. If life is\r\nmeasured by sensations, he lived years of torture in the few minutes\r\nduring which he waited for the shock of the bows against the granite\r\nwall. Marcia, fortunately, had become insensible, though her sobbing,\r\npanting breath showed the extremity of terror that had pursued her as\r\nlong as consciousness remained. Nearer and nearer they come; an oar's\r\nlength, a step; they touch now! No, a wave careens the boat, and she\r\nlightly grazes by. Now opens a cleft, perhaps wide enough for her to\r\nenter. With helm hard down the bow sweeps round, and they float into a\r\nnarrow basin with high, perpendicular walls, opening only towards the\r\nsea. When within this little harbor, the boat lodged on a shelving rock\r\nand heeled over as the wave retreated. Greenleaf and his companion, who\r\nhad now recovered from her swoon, kept their places as though hanging at\r\nthe eaves of a house. They were safe from the fury of the storm without,\r\nbut there was no prospect of an immediate deliverance. The rock rose\r\nsheer above them thirty or forty feet, and they were shut up as in the\r\nbottom of a well. The waves dallied about the narrow entrance, shooting\r\nby, meeting, or returning on the sweep of an eddy; but at intervals they\r\ngathered their force, and, tumbling over each other, rushed in, dashing\r\nthe spray to the top of the basin, and completely drenching the luckless\r\nvoyagers. This, however, was not so serious a matter as it would have\r\nbeen if their clothes had not been wet before in the heavy rain. The\r\ntide slowly rose, and the boat floated higher and higher against the\r\nrock, as the shadows began to settle over the gulf.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the peril they had encountered, and their present discomfort\r\nand perplexity, Greenleaf now experienced an indescribable pleasure.\r\nMarcia was exhausted with fatigue and terror, and rested her head upon\r\nhis shoulder. Unconsciously, he used the cheering, caressing tones which\r\nthe circumstances naturally prompted. It was an occasion to draw out\r\nwhat was most manly, most tender, most chivalric in him. The pride of\r\nthe woman was gone, her artifices forgotten. In that hour she had looked\r\nbeyond the factitious distinctions of society; she had found herself\r\nface to face with her companion without disguise, as spirit looks\r\nupon spirit, and she felt herself drawn to him by the loyalty which a\r\nsuperior nature inevitably inspires.\r\n\r\nA slight movement of the boat caused Greenleaf to turn his head. Just\r\nbehind him there was a shelf not three feet above the gunwale; beyond\r\nthat was a second step, and still farther a winding fissure. After\r\nmeasuring the distances again with his eye, to be sure that he should\r\nraise no illusive hope, he pointed out to Marcia the way of escape.\r\nTheir conversation had naturally taken an affectionate turn, and\r\nGreenleaf's delicate courtesy and hardly ambiguous words had raised\r\na tumult in her bosom which could no longer be repressed. She flung\r\nherself into his arms, and with tears exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"Dear George, you have saved my life! It is yours! Take me!\"\r\n\r\nThe rush of emotion swept away the last barrier; he yielded to the\r\nimpulse; he clasped her fondly in his arms and gave his heart and soul\r\nto her keeping. Carefully he assisted her up by the way he had found,\r\nand when at last they reached the top of the cliff, both fell on their\r\nknees in gratitude to Heaven for their preservation. Then new embraces\r\nand protestations. Rain and salt spray, hunger and fatigue, were of\r\nlittle moment in that hour.\r\n\r\nNear the cliff stood a gentleman's villa, and to that they now hastened\r\nto procure dry clothing before returning home. They found the welcome\r\nhospitality they expected, and after rest and refreshment started to\r\nwalk to Swampscot, where they could obtain a carriage for Nahant. But\r\nat the gate they met Easelmann and Mrs. Sandford, who, alarmed at their\r\nlong absence, had driven in a barouche along the coast in hope of\r\nhearing some tidings of the boat.\r\n\r\nThe wanderers were overwhelmed with congratulations, mingled with\r\ndeserved reproofs for their rashness in venturing forth without their\r\npilot. On the way home, Greenleaf told the story which the reader\r\nalready knows, omitting only some few passages. Easelmann turned and\r\nsaid, with a meaning emphasis,--\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. I thought what would happen. You aren't drowned, to be\r\nsure; but some people _can't_ be drowned; better for them, if they\r\ncould!\"\r\n\r\nGreenleaf made no reply to the _brusque_ sarcasm, but drew Marcia closer\r\nto his side. He could not talk after such an adventure, especially while\r\nin contact with the woman for whom he had risked so much.\r\n\r\nPoor little Alice!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flurry in the money-market gradually increased to a storm.\r\nConfidence was destroyed, and business at a stand. The daily bulletins\r\nof failures formed the chief topic of conversation. The merchants and\r\nbankers, especially those who held Western lands, Western securities, or\r\nWestern credits, went down one after another. Houses tumbled like a row\r\nof bricks. No class was safe at a time when the relations of debtor and\r\ncreditor were so complicated and so universal. Stocks went down with a\r\nrun. Bullion was not disappointed in his calculations, and Fletcher, in\r\nspite of his insane whims upon the subject of chances, proved himself\r\nshrewd, vigilant, and energetic. Flushed with success, he made bolder\r\nventures, and the daily balances grew to be enormous. Within the first\r\nfortnight, Bullion had given Fletcher notes for over five thousand\r\ndollars as his share of the profits. The brokers, even, were astonished\r\nat the silent but all-powerful influence that pressed upon the market,\r\nbringing the best stocks down till they sold like damaged goods at a\r\nsheriff's auction. But Tonsor, the lucky agent, kept his counsel.\r\nDaily he attended the sales at the Board, with apparently exhaustless\r\nresources, _bear_ing pitilessly, triumphantly, until the unlucky bulls\r\ncame to think the sight of his face was an ill omen.\r\n\r\nOf all men, Sandford felt this steady, determined pressure most keenly.\r\nTo sustain the credit of those in whose affairs he was concerned, he was\r\nobliged from time to time to put under the hammer stocks which had been\r\nplaced in his hands. Every sale showed the value of these securities\r\nto be sinking, until it really seemed that they would come to be as\r\nworthless as the old Continental currency. But neither he nor other\r\nsufferers had any remedy;--stocks were worth only what they would bring;\r\nprices must take care of themselves; and the calm, determined bids of\r\nTonsor were like the voice of Fate.\r\n\r\nIn his extremity, Sandford thought of Monroe, and remembering his own\r\npersonal responsibility for the sum he had received, he determined to\r\n\"hedge.\" So he sent for Monroe; he showed him the notes, all amply\r\nsecured, if any man's name could be said to give security.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Sandford, \"how careful I have been. Two good names on\r\nevery note. They may fail, it is true. So stocks may go for a song,\r\nand universal bankruptcy follow. See, there is a note signed by Flint,\r\nSteel, & Co., and indorsed by Lameduck, another by Kiteflyer and Co.,\r\nindorsed by Burntwick, and this by Stearine & Star, indorsed by Bullion.\r\nEvery dollar will yield at least the eight per cent. I promised.\"\r\n\r\n\"The names are good, I should think.--as long as anybody is good,\" said\r\nMonroe. \"Still I should feel safer with a mortgage, or even with stocks;\r\nfor if these do go down, they will come up again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stocks!\" said Sandford, with an air of contempt. \"There isn't a bank\r\nthat is worth _that_\"--snapping his fingers. \"They keep on their legs\r\nonly by sufferance; if put to the test, they could not redeem their\r\nnotes a day. The factories are worse yet,--rotten, hollow. Railroads,\r\n--eaten up with bonds and mortgages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps you have done wisely. Time will show.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sent for you,\" said Sandford, \"because I knew you must be anxious. I\r\ngave you a part of the interest, you know. You'll take these notes? You\r\napprove of my judgment?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must, I suppose. Yes,--you can make the transfers to me, if you like.\r\nThey may as well remain with you, however.\"\r\n\r\nSandford drew a long breath with a sense of relief. If he were to be\r\nhard pushed, these notes would serve for collateral securities.\r\n\r\nMonroe left the office, not quite so cheerful as when he came. He\r\nremembered his mother's regrets at the disposition of the money,--their\r\nall. His own health had been failing. His relative, whom he went to see,\r\nwas dead; and now that his cousin had accepted his invitation to come\r\nand live with him, he felt an increased solicitude about the future.\r\n\r\nSandford's main anxiety now was to provide for Stearine's note, which he\r\nfelt assured the promisor could not meet. He dared not let the loss fall\r\nupon the Vortex until every expedient had been tried; for such an affair\r\nwould lead at once to an unwelcome investigation of the Company's\r\naccounts. He determined first to see Bullion, to whom the note was due.\r\nHe found that gentleman cool, tranquil, and not at all frightened, as\r\nhe supposed he would be, at the idea of a protest. The truth was, that\r\nBullion had already made so much in his operations, that he could easily\r\n\"lift\" the note; but as long as his capital was yielding such golden\r\nreturns, he was not disposed to use it in that way until obliged to do\r\nso. Besides, he believed, from Sandford's anxiety, that he would\r\nhimself make an effort to raise the money elsewhere. He was quite easy,\r\ntherefore.\r\n\r\n\"Stearine must look out for his own paper; if he don't, he must go down.\r\nIf I have to pay it, I shall any way get a dividend out of him, and,\r\nwhat is better, get a few days' time. Time _is_ money, these days.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no course for Sandford, then, but to sell or hypothecate the\r\nshares of stock he held. Then the thought of the still falling prices\r\nfrightened him. The stocks he had to sell were already quoted far below\r\ntheir usual price, and he, in common with all the street, had heard of\r\nthe secret irresistible influence that was bearing down upon the daily\r\nsales. If Tonsor should come into market against him, the consequences\r\nmight be ruinous. It was out of the question for him to stand up against\r\nany further serious depreciation.\r\n\r\nTo Tonsor he went, in the hope of persuading or buying him off from his\r\ndestructive course. As he entered the broker's door he saw Fletcher\r\nhand over a package of bills, and just caught the words, \"Forty-five\r\nthousand.\" What was Fletcher doing? He remembered that he had not met\r\nhis old agent for some days, and he knew well that such a scheming brain\r\nwould not be idle in a time like this. A light flashed upon him. Was\r\nFletcher in the conspiracy? If _he_ knew and shared in the scheme, the\r\nsecret should be wrenched from him.\r\n\r\nMr. Sandford affected, therefore, to have come to see Fletcher only, and\r\ndrew him into a corner.\r\n\r\n\"Fletcher, what's in the wind? Don't Danforth & Co. do their own buying\r\nand selling? They don't employ Tonsor, do they?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't expect me to tell their business, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no,--not exactly. I thought you might have dipped in on your own\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a good joke. How should _I_ have the funds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any chances to invest, Fletcher? I'll give liberal commissions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chances are plenty for those that have money.\"\r\n\r\nFletcher started as though he would return to his place of business. But\r\nSandford dropped his smooth and honeyed tone and spoke more decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"You can't blind me, Fletcher. You know what the bears are doing. They\r\nare ruining everything, knocking down prices, destroying credit, using\r\nwhat little money there is for speculation, thriving on the distress of\r\nthe public. It's no better than highway-robbery; and it's my belief you\r\nare concerned in the plot.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better go to the nobs, and not talk to me. You might as well\r\npitch into the tellers or messengers when the banks suspend payment.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--I shan't let you off. The 'nobs,' as you call them, dare not be\r\nseen in this matter; they will pocket the chestnuts, but they will get\r\nsome cat's-paw to rake them out of the ashes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are you going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\nFletcher was astonished at his own temerity as soon as he had uttered\r\nthe words; but his prosperity and the support of Bullion had given him\r\nsome courage.\r\n\r\n\"Do? you scoundrel!\" said Sandford, in a rage that rarely overtook him.\r\n\"What am I going to do? I'll break every bone in your skin, if you don't\r\ngive up this plot you are in. Do you _dare_ to set yourself to put _me_\r\ndown? Don't let any of your tools _dare_ to run my stocks! If you do,\r\nI'll go to a magistrate and have you arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I am arrested, my good Sir,\" said Fletcher, with a face pale as\r\ndeath, but with lips firmly set, \"I advise you to have your accounts\r\nready. For I shan't be in the jug a minute before you'll have to show\r\nyour papers and your cash-book to the Company.\"\r\n\r\nSandford staggered as though he had received a blow from a bruiser. He\r\ngasped for breath,--turned pale, then red,--at length with difficulty\r\nsaid, \"You defy me, then? We shall see!\"\r\n\r\n\"You have it;--I defy you, hate you, despise you! I have been your slave\r\nlong enough. Do your worst. But the instant you move, I promise you that\r\na man will look after you, d--d quick.\"\r\n\r\nSandford looked around. Tonsor was calmly counting the pile of\r\nbank-notes before him. It was near eleven. This Board would soon\r\ncommence its session. He stepped into the street, slamming the door\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well, for a beginning!\" said Fletcher, meditating, \"a shot\r\nbetwixt wind and water. So much for Bullion's advice. Bullion is a\r\ntrump, and Sandford be hanged!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSED REVOCARE GRADUM!--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fatigue, drenching, and terror of the unlucky day's sail produced\r\ntheir natural effects upon a rather delicate constitution. Miss Sandford\r\nwas ill the following day, and, in spite of the doctors, a fever set in.\r\nHer sister-in-law was assiduous in her attentions, and Greenleaf called\r\ndaily with inquiries and tender messages. While thus occupied, he had\r\nlittle time to consider the real state of his feelings towards the new\r\nlove, still less to reflect upon his conduct towards the old. For the\r\nfirst time in his life he became a coward. If he meant to abide by his\r\nlast engagement, honor should have led him to break the unwelcome news\r\nto Alice as best he might, and extricate himself from his false and\r\nembarrassing position. If he still loved the girl of his first choice,\r\nand felt that his untruth to her was only the result of a transient,\r\nsensuous passion, it was equally plain that he must resolutely break\r\naway from the beautiful tempter. But he oscillated, pendulum-like,\r\nbetween the two. When Marcia began to recover, and he was allowed to see\r\nher in her chamber, the influence she had at first exerted returned upon\r\nhim with double force. In her helplessness, she appealed powerfully\r\nto the chivalric sentiment which man feels towards the dependent; her\r\ntones, softened by affection and tremulous from weakness, thrilled his\r\nsoul; and the touch of her hand was electric. When he returned to his\r\nstudio, as he thought of the trustful, unsuspecting, generous heart of\r\nAlice, he was smitten with a pang of remorse too keen to be borne. He\r\ntried to look at her picture, but the face was to him like the sight of\r\na reproving angel. He could not look steadily upon the placid features;\r\nthe calm eyes turned his heart to stone; the sweet mouth was an accuser\r\nhe dared not face. But when next he saw Marcia, all was forgotten; while\r\nunder her spell he could have braved the world, only too happy to live\r\nand die for her.\r\n\r\nFor days this struggle continued. His art had no power to amuse him or\r\nengross his thought. His friends were neglected,--Easelmann with the\r\nrest. His enemy could not have wished to see him more completely\r\nmiserable. He knew that he must decide, must act; but whatever might be\r\nhis determination, he had a most painful duty to perform. Let him do\r\nwhat he might, he must prove himself a villain. He loathed, detested\r\nhimself. Sometimes he was tempted to fly; but then he reflected that he\r\nshould in that way prove a scoundrel to two women instead of one. For\r\nthree weeks he had not written to Alice, and the last letter he had\r\nreceived from her was now a month old. He took it from his pocket, where\r\nit lay among the perfumed and tinted evidences of his unfaithfulness. It\r\nwas a simple thing, but how the gentle words smote upon his heart!\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR GEORGE, (_her_ dear George!)--How I wish I could be with you,\r\nto rejoice over your success! You are really a great artist, the papers\r\nsay, and are becoming famous! Not that I love you the more for that. If\r\nyou were still unknown to the world, still only a lover of beauty for\r\nits own sake, and content with painting for your own pleasure, I am not\r\nsure that I should not love you the more. But you will believe me, that\r\nI am proud of your success. If I am ambitious, it is for you. I would\r\nhave the world see and know you as I do. Yet not as I do,--nobody can\r\ndo that. To the world you are a great painter. To me--ah, my dearest\r\nGeorge!--you are the noblest and truest heart that ever woman rested\r\nupon. Nobody but me knows that. I shall be proud of the homage the world\r\ngives you, because at the same time I shall say, 'That is my betrothed,\r\nmy husband, whom they praise; what his heart is, no woman knows but\r\nme'\"----\r\n\r\nHe could read no farther. His emotions were too powerful to be borne in\r\nsilence. He yielded, and, strong man as he was, bowed his head and wept.\r\nThe tears of childhood, and oftentimes the tears of woman, lie shallow;\r\nthey come at the first bidding of sorrow or sympathy. But it is no\r\ncommon event, no common feeling, that prevails over man; nothing less\r\nthan a convulsion like an earthquake unseals the fountain of tears in\r\nhim. Whoever has seen the agony of a manly nature in groans and tears\r\nand sobs has something to remember for a life-time.\r\n\r\nIt was a long night,--a night of unutterable suffering, struggle, and\r\ndoubt. The hours seemed shod with lead. Sleep seemed banished from the\r\nuniverse. But with the coming of dawn the tempest was stilled. In the\r\nclear light of day the path of duty seemed plain. He felt sure that in\r\nhis heart of hearts he loved Alice, and her only. He would go at once to\r\nMarcia and tell her of his perfidy, implore the forgiveness of silence\r\nand charity, and bid her farewell. When he had reached this conclusion\r\nhe became calm. As he looked out from his window, he saw the world awake\r\nfrom slumber, and he shared in the gladness of Nature. He even rejoiced\r\nin the prospect of deliverance from his wretched condition, although he\r\nwell knew the humiliation he must pass through to attain it. He waited\r\nimpatiently for the hour when he could present himself before Marcia,\r\nown his duplicity, and take leave of her. He felt strong in his new\r\nresolution. All vacillation was past. He could face any temptation\r\nwithout one flutter of inconstancy towards his first-love.\r\n\r\nGreenleaf was not the only one in the city with whom the night had\r\npassed heavily. The cloud still hung over the mercantile world.\r\nFailures, by dozens, were announced daily. Men heard the dismal\r\nintelligence, as in time of pestilence they would hear the report of\r\nthe dead and dying. No business-man felt secure. No amount of property,\r\nother than ready money, was any safeguard. Neighbor met neighbor,\r\nasking, with doleful accent, \"Where is this going to end?\" The street,\r\nat 'change hours, presented a crowd of haggard faces, furrowed\r\nwith care, their eyes fixed and despairing. Some looked white with\r\napprehension, some crushed and tearful, others stony, sullen, or\r\ndefiant. Whatever was bravest had been drawn out in manly\r\nendeavor; whatever was most generous was excited to sympathy and\r\nbrotherly-kindness; whatever was most selfish was stimulated by the\r\nfierce desire for self-preservation; whatever was most fiendish was\r\nroused by blind rage and useless resentment. In the halcyon days of\r\nplenty and prosperity men know little of each other; trade has its\r\naccustomed way; balances are smoothly adjusted; notes are given and paid\r\nwith smiling faces; one would think that honor and manliness were the\r\ncommonest of qualities. Now, every man was put to the severest proof,\r\nand showed the inborn and essential traits of his nature. Like a ship's\r\ncrew on a raft, alone on the ocean without provisions, they looked at\r\neach other as they were. There, in their extremity, were to be seen\r\ncalm resignation, unmanly terror, moody despair, turbulent passion, and\r\nstealthy, fiendish glances that blinked not at cannibalism itself.\r\n\r\nMr. Sandford, almost for the first time in his life, had been\r\nrendered nervous with apprehension. To be sure, he was not one of the\r\n\"sleek-headed men that sleep o' nights\"; he was always busy with some\r\nscheme; but, heretofore, success had followed every plan, and he had\r\ngone on with steadfast confidence. Now the keenest foresight was of\r\nno avail; events defied calculation; misfortunes came without end and\r\nwithout remedy. It was the moment of fate to him. He had gone to the\r\nlast verge, exhausted every resource, and, if there were not some help,\r\nas unlooked for as a shower of gold from heaven, he must stop payment\r\n--he, whose credit had been spotless and without limit, whose name in\r\nthe financial world was honor itself, whose influence had been a tower\r\nof strength in every undertaking. It was not without a struggle that he\r\nbrought himself to look this inexorable fact in the face. Marcia and his\r\nsister-in-law heard him as he paced the room through the night; they had\r\nnoticed his abstracted and downcast air the preceding evening; and at\r\nbreakfast the few words that escaped from between his firm-set lips were\r\nsufficiently ominous. It was the first morning that Marcia had appeared\r\nat the table, and in her feeble condition the apprehension of danger\r\nwas intense and overpowering. Mrs. Sandford tried in vain to change\r\nthe conversation, by significant glances towards the invalid; but the\r\nbrother was too much absorbed to notice anything outside of the gloomy\r\ncircle that hemmed him in. Muttering still of \"ruin,\" \"beggary,\" and\r\nsimilar topics, so admirably adapted to cheer the convalescent, he\r\nswallowed his breakfast like an animal, left the room without his usual\r\nbland \"good morning,\" and slammed the street-door after him.\r\n\r\nA fit of hysterics was the natural consequence. The kind and sisterly\r\nwidow bore, rather than led, Marcia to an upper room, propped her with\r\npillows in an arm-chair, and employed every tender and womanly art to\r\nsoothe her excited nerves. Calmness came, but only with exhaustion.\r\nThe door-bell rang. Mrs. Sandford gave an inaudible direction to the\r\nservant. But Marcia exclaimed, \"It is George! I heard his step on the\r\npavement. I must see him. Let him in.\" Mrs. Sandford remonstrated to no\r\npurpose, and then went to her own room.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ \"George.\" He entered the room with a pale face, and a look\r\nbetokening both suffering and resolution. He was evidently struck by the\r\nappearance of Miss Sandford, rightly judging that she was not able\r\nto bear what he had come to tell her. He would have uttered a few\r\ncommonplace courtesies, and deferred his weighty communication to\r\nanother time. But Marcia's senses were preternaturally sharpened; weak\r\nas a vine without its trellis, instinct seemed to guide her to clasp\r\nby every tendril the support to which she had been wont to cling. She\r\nnoticed a certain uneasiness in Greenleaf's demeanor; ready to give\r\nthe worst interpretation to everything, she exclaimed, in a quick,\r\nfrightened manner, \"George, dear George, what is the matter? You are\r\ncold, you are distant. Are _you_ in trouble, too, like all the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Deeply in trouble,\" he answered gravely,--still standing, hat in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Trouble that I cannot soothe?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you won't tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't love me.\"\r\n\r\nGreenleaf was silent; his lips showing the emotion he strove to control.\r\nHer voice took a more cheerful tone, as if she would assure herself,\r\nand, with a faint smile, she said,--\r\n\r\n\"You are silent; but I am only childish. You do love me,--don't you,\r\nGeorge?\"\r\n\r\n\"As much as I ever did.\"\r\n\r\nA mean subterfuge; for though it was true, perhaps, to him, he knew it\r\nwas a falsehood to her. She attempted to rise from her chair; he sprang\r\nto support her.\r\n\r\n\"You are so gloomy, reserved, to-day!\" she continued.\r\n\r\nStill Greenleaf was silent. He aided her to resume her seat; but when he\r\nhad done so, she detained him, seizing his arm and then his hand. His\r\nheart beat rapidly, and he turned away his head to avoid the fond but\r\nkeen scrutiny of her eyes,--at the same time gently, but ineffectually,\r\nattempting to free his hand. Once more he resolved, since the\r\nconversation had taken such a turn, to risk the consequences, and\r\nprepare her mind for a separation. But a sudden thought struck her, and,\r\nbefore he could frame a sentence, she spoke:--\r\n\r\n\"You have heard bad news this morning?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No,--I know you are not mercenary; I would not wrong you with the\r\nsuspicion.\"\r\n\r\n\"What suspicion, pray?\" he asked, turning suddenly towards her.\r\n\r\n\"You have not heard?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity my foolishness. But my brother is in difficulty; he may fail;\r\nperhaps has failed even now. Pray, don't chide me for my fears. All the\r\nworld goes with the rich and the prosperous.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world has very little company just now, then,\" said Greenleaf, with\r\na grim smile. \"But assure yourself,\" he continued; \"the dowry of my wife\r\nis a matter I have never considered. _With the woman I love_,\" said he,\r\nwith deep emphasis, \"honest poverty is what I do not dread.\"\r\n\r\nInterpreting this fervent declaration in the natural way, Marcia reached\r\nforth her arms with sudden fervor, drew him nearer, and covered his\r\nforehead, lips, and cheeks with kisses. Every kiss fell like a spot\r\nof mildew on his flesh; her caresses filled him with shame. Could he\r\nundeceive her? In her feeble condition, the excitement into which she\r\nhad been thrown by her brother's danger was all she could bear. False as\r\nhis position was, heartless and empty as his soothing words and caresses\r\nwere, he must continue to wear the mask, and show himself as he was at\r\nsome time when she had no other trouble to weigh her down. Still she\r\nchid his gloomy reserve, his absent air, and mechanical movements. Was\r\nhe weak, if under such influences his fixed resolves bent?--if his\r\nnerves felt the old thrill?--if his voice took a softer tone?--and if\r\nhe parted from her with something of his former tenderness? He tried to\r\nexcuse himself to his conscience by the plea, that the deception once\r\nbegun must be kept up until it could be ended with safety. For he saw\r\nthat her heart was really bound up in him. She no longer kept up the\r\nbrilliant fence of repartee; she had abandoned all coquettish arts, and,\r\nfor once at least, was sincerely, fondly, even foolishly, in love. Home\r\nhe went, sadder than before, his conscience yet more aroused, and his\r\nresolutions farther than ever from accomplishment.\r\n\r\nPoor little Alice!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nEVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sandford walked towards his office, that fine autumn morning, in no\r\namiable mood. Nature seemed to protest against his angry violence; the\r\nvery stones of the pavement seemed to say,--\"He need not thump us in\r\nthat way; _we_ can't pay his notes.\" The trees along Mount Vernon Street\r\nrustled their leaves with a shudder, as he passed under them; they\r\ndropped no benison upon a face which even the golden morning could not\r\nlighten. \"Let him stride on!\" said they; \"we shall be more cheerful in\r\ncompany with the maids washing the sidewalks or taking out the children\r\n(blessed darlings!) for an airing.\" Canaries ceased their songs in the\r\nwindows; urchins stopped their hoops and stood on the curbstones, eyeing\r\nthe gloomy man askance. When he passed the Granary Burying-Ground, he\r\nsaw a squirrel dart down a tree, and scamper over the old graves in\r\nsearch of some one of his many stores; then rising on his haunches, he\r\nmunched the pea-nut which he had unearthed, (the gift of some schoolboy,\r\nmonths ago,) as much as to say, \"_We_ know how to look out for hard\r\ntimes; but what have you done with _your_ pea-nuts, old fellow, that you\r\nlook so cross? Can't get 'em, eh? You should put 'em where you'll know\r\nwhere they are.\" A whisk of his tail and he flew up the tree. The lesson\r\nwas lost upon the financier. At the office-door he met Bullion,--his\r\nface a trifle more ruddy, his eye with a colder glitter, and his queer\r\neyebrow pointing with an odder significance.\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Sandford?\"--A very short nod.--\"Cool, this morning.\"--\r\nStanding with his dumpy legs apart, he nibbled at the ivory head of his\r\ncane.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Bullion,\" said Sandford, \"you must help me. You must lift that\r\nnote. Come, I know you can do it,--and I'll make it worth your while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't do it; you want a long extension, I s'pose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say three or four months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time is money, as I told you before. In four months, with forty\r\nthousand dollars, I could--do pretty well,\" ending the sentence in a\r\nlower tone, that indicated a desire to keep his first thought back.\r\n\r\n\"In a time like this, Mr. Bullion, it is the duty of every man to assist\r\nhis neighbor to the extent of his ability. If there is no forbearance,\r\nno brotherly aid, how are the complicated settlements of a mad community\r\nlike this to be made? There is not money enough to pay what must be\r\npaid.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyebrow was stiffly pointed as Bullion answered,--\r\n\r\n\"I do forbear. I must forbear. Stearine owes me; you indorse; you can't\r\npay, neither of you. I sha'n't get the money. I must go without.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an injured tone.\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you let it go to protest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a form, Sandford. Usage of the mercantile world. Very irregular\r\nnot to do it. Sorry, but can't help it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Sandford's patience was exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"It is my turn to-day, Bullion; I have no further resource; I am ruined.\r\nYou feel strong and look upon my distress in triumph. But your turn will\r\ncome. Mark my words. Within a fortnight I shall see you rushing down\r\nState Street in despair; your property will be swept away with a flood,\r\nand you will be a beggar,--as you deserve to be. Damn your stony heart!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first outburst of profanity from Mr. Sandford,--too\r\nfastidious, usually, to allow himself the use of such expletives.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to see you excited, Sandford. Best to keep temper. Guess you and\r\nFayerweather will raise the money. Pity Stearine hadn't wick enough in\r\nhim to stand alone. Rather a poor candle, he is,--he! he! Morning!\"\r\n\r\nThe gray eyes twinkled, the eyebrow whisked, and the sturdy legs bore\r\nthe creditor away.\r\n\r\nEntering the office, Mr. Sandford tried to assume a cheerful look. He\r\nlooked over the list of failures, in the \"Independent,\" with something\r\nof the interest which a patient in a hospital would feel when\r\noverhearing the report from the dead-house. Was there no one of the bald\r\nor grizzly-haired gentlemen who smiled so benignly whom he could ask for\r\naid? Not one; he knew their circumstances; they had no money at command;\r\nall their property was locked up in investments. He thought of the many\r\nchairmen and directors in benevolent associations with whom he was\r\nconnected. No,--they were either men of moderate means, or had some son\r\nor nephew or brother in business whose credit they must uphold. How\r\ngladly would he barter all his parchment testimonials for one good\r\n\"promise to pay\"! He groaned almost audibly, and wondered how he could\r\npass the time till the close of bank-hours. The suspense was a torture\r\nas keen as the calamity itself.\r\n\r\nA visitor entered; it was Plotman. He came with a cheerful, even\r\nexulting, look.\r\n\r\n\"Good news, Sandford!\"\r\n\r\n\"News!\" exclaimed Sandford, impetuously. \"What news? How much?\"\r\n\r\nIn his absent state he forgot that Plotman was not aware of his\r\nthoughts, and associated good news only with an accommodation to serve\r\nhis present need. But his fluttering expectations were dashed to the\r\nground with the reply.\r\n\r\n\"'How much,' did you say? A clean majority over all. Your name stands at\r\nthe head of the ticket.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am obliged to you,\" replied Sandford, sadly, \"but I don't think I can\r\naccept the nomination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that _is_ rather strong,\" said Plotman. \"You'd best keep your\r\nmodesty for the papers; it's thrown away on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really can't bother with politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why in the Devil, then, did you lay your corns to get the place, and\r\nmake me all this trouble for nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am really sorry, Plotman; but, to tell you just how it is, I am so\r\nmuch involved in this fearful monetary pressure that I have no time nor\r\nheart for anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confounded spooney!\" muttered Plotman, between his teeth. \"If I'd known\r\nhe was so weak in the knees. I'd have gone in for Spreadeagle, who\r\noffered a handsome figure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come in to-morrow, Plotman, and we'll talk about it. I can't think\r\nabout it now. I'll make all right with you.\"\r\n\r\nStill muttering, the disappointed politician departed, leaving Sandford\r\nin a deeper abyss than before. To prevent unwelcome visits, the latter\r\nleft word with his clerks that he could see no one whatever.\r\n\r\nTo wile away the time, he took out his cash-book and private papers.\r\nThere was about a thousand dollars in bank.\r\n\r\n\"It will be best to draw that,\" thought he, \"for there's no knowing what\r\nmay happen.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the office-boy was dispatched with a check for the amount.\r\n\r\n\"Let us see what other resources. There are Monroe's notes,--ten\r\nthousand dollars. I can raise something on them. I'll borrow from\r\nTonsor, who seems to have funds enough.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent a clerk and succeeded in obtaining eight thousand dollars for\r\nfive days, by depositing the notes.\r\n\r\n\"If worst comes to worst, I have nine thousand to fall back upon. Now,\r\nwhat next? Fletcher's note for five hundred, with the rather peculiar\r\nadmission at the beginning. I wonder, now, what he would give for this\r\nlittle paper? Possibly he is in funds. He's a scheming devil and hasn't\r\nbeen idle in this gale of wind. I'll send for him.\"\r\n\r\nFletcher entered with an air of confidence.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Sandford, you don't bear malice, I see. If you didn't want to\r\nget a saucy answer, you shouldn't have threatened, the other day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were hardly civil, Fletcher,\" said Sandford, gravely, \"and rather\r\nforgetful, besides. If I were you, I wouldn't bluster until a certain\r\npiece of paper was safe in my possession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose I ever forget that paper, or how you bullied it out of\r\nme? But you know that at the time when I used that five hundred dollars,\r\nI had money enough, and felt as sure of returning it the next day as you\r\ndo of paying the ten thousand you had of Monroe.\"\r\n\r\nSandford started.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know whose money I had?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. I hear a great many things. As I was saying, I didn't steal\r\nthe money, for you didn't miss it till I told you; and if I hadn't been\r\na coward and a fool to boot, I should never have signed that cursed\r\npaper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it, though. The law calls it a confession of theft.\"\r\n\r\nFletcher winced.\r\n\r\n\"You have told me that often enough before. You needn't touch me on the\r\nraw to make me remember it.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited, but Sandford made no reply. Fletcher continued:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it? You've something on hand, or you wouldn't have sent\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You propose to pay sometime, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I do. I've offered to pay times enough, you know. I can get\r\nthe money in ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you! How much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the five hundred and interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather think the document is worth more money.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd take my heart's blood for it, I know. But you can't get any more\r\nmoney than I have got.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were very ready in promising five hundred in ten minutes. It seems\r\nto me that in an hour you might raise a larger sum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose I am a capitalist?--that I own Fogarty, Danforth, and\r\nDot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure, I can't tell. Stranger things have happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if he suspects my connection with old Bullion?\" thought\r\nFletcher.\r\n\r\n\"I'll make you a fair proposition, Fletcher. I need some money, for a\r\nfew days. Get me thirty thousand dollars for a week, say; I'll pay a\r\nliberal interest and give up the paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't do it. The figure is altogether above me. You don't want me to\r\nrob my employers?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Rob' is a hard word, Fletcher. No, I counsel no crime. You don't want\r\nanything more to think of. But you may know some chance to borrow that\r\nsum?\"\r\n\r\nFletcher mused. \"If Sandford comes to a man like me for such a sum, it\r\nmust be because he is devilish hard up; and if I get him the money, it\r\nwould likely be sunk. I can't do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Sandford, it's out of the question. Everybody that has money\r\nhas twenty applications for every dollar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'd rather see this paper in an officer's hands?\"\r\n\r\nFletcher's face blanched and his knees shook, but he kept his resolution\r\nin spite of his bodily tremor.\r\n\r\n\"I have been like a mouse cuffed between a cat's paws so long that I\r\ndon't care to run. If you mean to pounce up on me and finish me, go\r\nahead. I may as well die as to be always dreading it. But you'll please\r\nremember what I said about overhauling your accounts.\"\r\n\r\nSandford found his man firmer than he had expected. He changed his\r\ntactics.\r\n\r\n\"Fletcher, as you can't do what I want, how much will you give outright\r\nfor the little obligation? You shall have it for fifteen hundred\r\ndollars. Come, now, that's reasonable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reasonable as the fellow who puts a pistol to your head on a dark night\r\nin the middle of Cambridge bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut! Don't talk of highway-robbery! I think I am letting you off\r\ncheap.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you suppose I can raise fifteen hundred dollars?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is your affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are as cruel as a bloodhound after a runaway nigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have once or twice remonstrated against your use of harsh words.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of being mealy-mouthed? I owe you five hundred dollars.\r\nEvery dollar beyond that you get from me you rob me of; and it doesn't\r\nmatter whether it is a pistol or a writ that you threaten me with.\"\r\n\r\n\"You persist in a violent tone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't talk to suit you, and I shall stop. We shall never agree. I'll\r\ntell you, though, what I will do. I'll give you a note, to-morrow, for a\r\nthousand dollars, on short time, with a good name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Money, Fletcher!--money! I don't want any note.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll see what I can do. Perhaps I can get the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, Fletcher, I advise you to settle the affair to-day. It has stood\r\nquite long enough. Just devote to-day to this little matter. Come in\r\nbefore two,--not later than three, at any rate. Perhaps your employers\r\nmight advance it,--that is, rather than have their clerk compromised.\r\nSuppose I lay the matter before them?\"\r\n\r\nFletcher's rage broke out afresh. He gnashed his teeth and foamed at\r\nthe mouth. If he had had a weapon, it might have fared hard with his\r\noppressor. But his anger was inarticulate,--too mighty, too tumultuous,\r\nfor words. He left the office, his eyes glowing like a cat's, and his\r\nfringy moustache trembling over his white teeth.\r\n\r\nMr. Sandford was somewhat exhilarated, and rubbed his smooth hands with\r\nenergy. \"I think he'll come back,\" thought he. \"Failure is inevitable.\r\nLet it come! We must bear it as we can. And for a ruined man I don't\r\nknow of any consolation like a little ready money. Now to play my last\r\ncards. These shares which I own in the Vortex are worth more to-day than\r\nthey are likely to be to-morrow. It would be a shame not to dispose of\r\nthem while they will bring something. Fayerweather and the others who\r\nhave agreed to buy at ninety per cent. are at the Board. I'll get a new\r\nhand to take them in. They won't suspect, for they think Stearine's note\r\nhas been extended.\"\r\n\r\nHe called a junior clerk and dispatched the shares to a broker to be\r\nsold for cash on account of whom it might concern. He then locked\r\nhimself in the back office to be free from troublesome visitors, keeping\r\na cautious lookout for Fletcher, whom he expected, and for the clerk\r\nwho was to bring the money. His chief anxiety was lest Mr. Fayerweather\r\nshould come before the sale was effected; and he was in a fever until\r\nthe money was brought to him. Through the window he saw his friends\r\nMonroe, Bullion, and others, who called for him and were denied by his\r\norder; he chose to remain unseen.\r\n\r\nFletcher did not return. In going out he met Bullion, and, telling him\r\nthat he had to pay Sandford a thousand dollars, asked for a part of the\r\nmoney due him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a fool,\" replied that sturdy financier, \"Sandford will fail\r\nto-day, probably. That's the reason for his hurry to get the money. Let\r\nhim sweat. Keep your funds. You can pay his assignee any time these six\r\nmonths to come.\"\r\n\r\nIt was near two o'clock. Mr. Sandford had in his pocket the proceeds of\r\nthe Vortex shares, the loan from Tensor, and his balance from bank,--a\r\ncomfortable sum altogether; and he thought it not prudent to risk the\r\nwhole by waiting for Fletcher, who, after all, might not come. So,\r\nseeing the coast clear, he put on his surtout and walked out of the\r\nfront door with an unconcerned air.\r\n\r\nThe notary came with the inevitable protest. Mr. Fayerweather was the\r\nastounded individual who received it. A sudden light broke upon him. He\r\nwas swindled. He took out the Vortex shares which he had just bought\r\nby agreement, and, turning to the transfer-book, found that they were\r\nSandford's. The Secretary had weathered the President with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer to whom the protested note came happened to hold other claims\r\nagainst Mr. Fayerweather and the Vortex, and, naturally judging that\r\nthe Company might be involved in the difficulties of its officers, he\r\ncommenced suit without a moment's delay. Ill news flies fast. In an hour\r\nafter the first writs were served, suit was brought by Tonsor and other\r\ncreditors, and the office was shut. The safe was found to hold nothing\r\nmore valuable than duplicates of policies, the Company's bank-account\r\nwas overdrawn, its stocks and bonds were sold or pledged, and its\r\navailable assets consisted of the office-furniture, a few reams of\r\npaper, and half a dozen sticks of sealing-wax.\r\n\r\n[To be continued.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE NEW LIFE\" OF DANTE.\r\n\r\n[Continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWere the author of the \"Vita Nuova\" unknown, its story of youth and\r\nlove would still possess a charm, as standing in the dawn of modern\r\nliterature,--the first book in which modern sentiment finds free\r\nexpression. It would be of interest, as contrasted with the later growth\r\nof the sentimental element in literature, which speedily exhibits the\r\ninfluence of factitious feeling, of self-conscious effort, and of\r\nambitious display. The sentiment of the \"Vita Nuova\" is separated by\r\nthe wide gulf that lies between simplicity and affectation from the\r\nsentimentality of Petrarch's sonnets. But connected as it is with\r\nDante's life,--the first of that series of works in which truth,\r\nintensity, and tenderness of feeling are displayed as in the writings of\r\nno other man,--its interest no longer arises merely from itself and from\r\nits place in literature, but becomes indissolubly united with that which\r\nbelongs by every claim to the \"Divina Commedia\" and to the life of\r\nDante.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Vita Nuova\" was completed, Dante was somewhat less than\r\ntwenty-eight years old. Beatrice had died between two and three years\r\nbefore, in 1290; and he seems to have pleased himself after her loss\r\nby recalling to his memory the sweet incidents of her life, and of her\r\ninfluence upon himself. He begins with the words:--\r\n\r\n\"In that part of the book of my memory before which little can be\r\nread is found a rubric which says: _Incipit Vita Nova_ ['The New Life\r\nbegins']. Under which rubric I find the words written which it is my\r\nintention to copy into this little book,--if not all of them, at least\r\ntheir meaning.\"\r\n\r\nThis introduction, short as it is, exhibits a characteristic trait of\r\nDante's mind, in the declaration of his intention to copy from the\r\nbook of his memory, or, in other words, to write the true records of\r\nexperience. Truth was the chief quality of his intellect, and upon\r\nthis, as upon an unshaken foundation, rest the marvellous power and\r\nconsistency of his imaginations. His heart spoke clearly, and he\r\ninterpreted its speech plainly in his words. His tendency to mysticism\r\noften, indeed, led him into strange fancies; but these, though sometimes\r\nobscure, are never vague. After these few words of preface, the story\r\nbegins:--\r\n\r\n\"Nine times now, since my birth, the heaven of light had turned almost\r\nto the same point in its gyration, when first appeared before my eyes\r\nthe glorious lady of my mind, who was called Beatrice, by many who did\r\nnot know why they thus called her.[A] She had now been in this life so\r\nlong, that in its time the starred heaven had moved toward the east one\r\nof the twelve parts of a degree;[B] so that about the beginning of her\r\nninth year she appeared to me, and I near the end of my ninth year saw\r\nher. She appeared to me clothed in a most noble color, a becoming and\r\nmodest crimson, and she was girt and adorned in the style that suited\r\nher extreme youth. At that instant, I say truly, the spirit of life,\r\nwhich dwells in the most secret chamber of the heart, began to tremble\r\nwith such violence, that it appeared horribly in the least pulses,\r\nand, trembling, said these words: _Ecce deus fortior me, qui veniens\r\ndominabitur mihi!_ [Behold a god, stronger than I, who, coming, shall\r\nrule me![C]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: It may be that Dante here refers to the meaning of the name\r\nBeatrice,--_She who renders happy. She who blesses._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: According to the astronomy of the times, the sphere of the\r\nstars moved from west to east one degree in a hundred years. The twelfth\r\nof a degree was, therefore, eight and a half years. See the _Convito_,\r\nTratt. II. c. vi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Compare with this passage Canzone x, st. 5, 6. Especially\r\nthe lines,\r\n\r\n  \"E, se 'l libro non erra,\r\n  Lo spirito maggior tremò si forte,\r\n  Che parve ben, che morte\r\n  Per lui in questo mondo giunta fosse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, if the book errs not, the chief spirit so greatly trembled, that\r\nit plainly appeared that death for him had arrived in this world.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Dante meets Beatrice in Purgatory, he says, referring to this\r\ntime,--and it is pleasant to note these connections between his earliest\r\nand his latest works,--\r\n\r\n  \"Tosto che nella vista mi percosse\r\n  L' alta virtù, che già m' avca trafitto\r\n  Prima ch' io fuor di puerizia fosse.\"\r\n               Canto xxx. l. 40-42.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\"At that instant, the spirit of the soul, which dwells in the high\r\nchamber to which all the spirits of the senses bring their perceptions,\r\nbegan to marvel greatly, and, addressing the spirits of the sight, said\r\nthese words: _Apparuit jam beatitudo vestra._ [Now hath appeared your\r\nbliss.] At that instant the natural spirit, which dwells in that part\r\nwhere the nourishment is supplied, began to weep, and, weeping, said\r\nthese words: _Heu miser! quia frequenter impeditus ero deinceps._ [Woe\r\nis me wretched! because frequently henceforth shall I be hindered.]\r\n\r\n\"From this time forward I say that Love lorded over my soul, which had\r\nbeen thus quickly put at his disposal;[D] and he began to exercise\r\nover me such control and such lordship, through the power which my\r\nimagination gave to him, that I was obliged to perform completely all\r\nhis pleasure. He commanded me many times that I should seek to see this\r\nyouthful angel, so that I in my boyhood often went seeking her, and saw\r\nher of such noble and praiseworthy deportment, that truly of her might\r\nbe said that saying of the poet Homer: 'She does not seem the daughter\r\nof a mortal, but of God.' And it befell that her image, which stayed\r\nconstantly with me, inspired boldness in Love to hold lordship over me;\r\nbut it was of such noble virtue, that it never suffered that Love should\r\nrule without the faithful counsel of Reason in those matters in which\r\nsuch counsel could be useful.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: The text of the _Vita Nuova_ is often uncertain. Here, for\r\nexample, many authorities concur in the reading, \"_la quale fu si tosto\r\na lui disponsata_,\" \"which had been so quickly betrothed to him.\" But\r\nwe prefer to read \"_disposta_,\" as being more in accordance with the\r\nremainder of the figure concerning Love. Many other various readings\r\nwill be passed over without notice,--but a translation might be exposed\r\nto the charge of inaccuracy, if it were judged by the text of any\r\nspecial edition of the original, without comparison with others. The\r\ntext usually followed in these versions is that of Fraticelli.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the account which Dante gives of the beginning of his love for\r\nBeatrice. The tenderness and purity of his passion are obscured, but not\r\nconcealed, by quaintness of expression and formality of learning. In\r\nliterary style the passage displays the uncertain hand of youth, and\r\nin a translation something is lost of the charm of simplicity which\r\npervades the original. But in this passage the keynote of Dante's life\r\nis struck.\r\n\r\nPassing over many things, he says that exactly nine years were completed\r\nafter the above-described appearance of this most gentle lady, when it\r\nhappened that \"she appeared before me clothed in purest white between\r\ntwo noble ladies, and, passing along the street, she turned her eyes\r\ntoward that place where I stood very timidly, and, by her ineffable\r\ncourtesy, which is now rewarded in eternity, saluted me with such\r\nvirtue, that I seemed to behold all the bounds of bliss. The hour when\r\nher most sweet salutation reached me was exactly the ninth of that day;\r\nand since it was the first time that her words came to my ears, I felt\r\nsuch great delight, that, as it were intoxicated, I turned away from the\r\ncrowd, and, betaking myself to the solitary place of my chamber, sat\r\nmyself down to think of this most courteous lady, and, thinking of her,\r\na sweet slumber came upon me, in which a marvellous vision appeared to\r\nme.\" After describing this vision, he says, that, thinking of what had\r\nappeared to him, he \"proposed to bring it to the knowledge of many who\r\nwere famous poets at that time; and since I had already seen in myself\r\nthe art of speaking words in rhyme, I proposed to write a sonnet, in\r\nwhich I would salute all the vassals of Love; and praying them to give\r\nan interpretation of my vision, I wrote to them that which I had seen in\r\nmy slumber. And I began then this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n  \"To every captive soul and gentle heart\r\n     Before whose sight may come the present\r\n        word,\r\n     That they may thereupon their thoughts\r\n        impart,\r\n     Be greeting in Love's name, who is their\r\n        lord.\r\n\r\n  \"Now of those hours wellnigh one third had\r\n        gone\r\n     In which each star appears in heaven most\r\n        bright,\r\n     When on a sudden Love before me shone,\r\n     To think upon whose being gives me fright.\r\n\r\n  \"Joyful seemed Love, and he was keeping\r\n     My heart within his hands, while on his arm\r\n     He held my Lady, covered o'er and sleeping.\r\n\r\n  \"Then waking her, he with this flaming heart\r\n     Did humbly feed her, fearful of some harm.\r\n     Sudden I saw him weep, and quick depart.\"\r\n\r\nThis sonnet is somewhat obscure in the details of its meaning, and\r\nhas little beauty, but it is of interest as being the earliest poetic\r\ncomposition by Dante that has been preserved for us, and it is curious\r\nas being the account of a vision. In our previous article on the \"New\r\nLife,\" we referred to the fact of this book being in great part composed\r\nof the account of a series of visions, thus connecting itself in the\r\nform of its imaginations with the great work of Dante's later years. As\r\na description of things unseen except by the inward eye, this sonnet\r\nis bound in poetic connection to the nobler visions of the \"Divina\r\nCommedia.\" The private stamp of Dante's imagination is indelibly\r\nimpressed upon it.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that many answers were made to this sonnet, and \"among those\r\nwho replied to it was he whom I call the first of my friends, and he\r\nwrote a sonnet which began,\r\n\r\n  'Thou seest in my opinion every worth.'\r\n\r\nThis was, as it were, the beginning of our friendship when he knew\r\nthat it was I who had sent these verses to him.\" This first of Dante's\r\nfriends was Guido Cavalcanti. Their friendship was of long duration,\r\nbeginning thus in Dante's nineteenth year, and ending only with Guido's\r\ndeath, in 1300, when Dante was thirty-five years old. It may be taken as\r\na proof of its intimacy and of Dante's high regard for the genius of his\r\nfriend, that, when Dante, in his course through Hell, at Easter in 1300,\r\nrepresents himself as being recognized by the father of Guido, the first\r\nwords of the old man to him are,\r\n\r\n\"If through this blind prison thou goest through loftiness of soul,\r\nwhere is my son? oh, why is he not with thee?\"[E]\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: _Inferno_, x. 58-60.]\r\n\r\nThe sonnet of Guido, in reply to that sent him by Dante, has been\r\npreserved, together with the replies by two other contemporary poets;\r\nbut Dante says of them all,--\"The true meaning of my sonnet was not then\r\nseen by any one, though now it is plain to the simplest.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this vision, the poet, whose soul was wholly devoted to his most\r\ngentle lady, was brought by Love into so frail a condition of health,\r\nthat his friends became anxious for him, and questioned him about that\r\nwhich he most wished to conceal. Then he told them that it was Love\r\nwhich had brought him to this pass. But when they asked him, \"For whom\r\nhas Love thus wasted thee?\" he looked at them smiling, and said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"One day it happened,\" he goes on to relate, \"that this most gentle lady\r\nsat where words concerning the Queen of Glory are heard, and I was in a\r\nplace from which I beheld my bliss. Between her and me in a direct line\r\nsat a gentle lady of most pleasing aspect, who looked at me often,\r\nwondering at my gaze, which seemed to terminate upon her; and many\r\nobserved her looks. So great attention, indeed, was paid to this, that\r\nwhen I went out from the place I heard some one say, 'Behold how that\r\nlady wastes the life of this man!'--and naming her, I heard that they\r\nspoke of her who had been in the path of the straight line which,\r\nparting from my most gentle Beatrice, had ended in my eyes.\" Then he\r\nsays he thought to make this lady serve as a screen for his real love,\r\nand he did this so well that in a short time many persons fancied they\r\nknew his secret. And in order to deceive them still more, he addressed\r\nto this lady many trifles in rhyme, of which he will insert in this\r\naccount of his \"New Life\" only those which bear reference to Beatrice.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, \"it was the pleasure of the Lord of the Angels to\r\ncall to his glory a young and beautiful lady, who had been very lovely\r\nin the city of Florence. And I saw her body lying without its soul,\r\nsurrounded by many ladies who wept grievously. Then remembering that I\r\nhad formerly seen her in company with that most gentle lady, I could not\r\nrestrain some tears; and, weeping, I proposed to say some words about\r\nher death, as a return for that I had seen her sometimes with my lady.\"\r\nThen, he says, he wrote two poems, of which we give the last, adding to\r\nit his verbal comment, as an example of the style of commentary with\r\nwhich he has accompanied all the poems of the \"Vita Nuova\":--\r\n\r\n  \"O villain Death, compassion's foe,\r\n     The Mother from of old of woe,\r\n     Inexorable judge severe,\r\n     Thou givest sorrow for the heart to bear;\r\n     Wherefore in grief I go,\r\n     And blaming thee my very tongue outwear.\r\n\r\n  \"And if of every grace thou wouldst be\r\n        bare,\r\n     It only needs that I declare\r\n     The guilt of this thy sinful blow,\r\n     So that all those shall know,\r\n     And each shall be thy foe,\r\n     Who erst were nurtured with Love's tender\r\n        care\r\n\r\n  \"For thou hast taken from the world the\r\n         grace\r\n     And virtue which are woman's praise,\r\n     And in youth's gayest days\r\n     The charm of loveliness thou dost deface.\r\n\r\n  \"Who is this lady is not to be told,\r\n     Save as these qualities do make her known.\r\n     He who deserves salvation may alone\r\n     Have hope companionship with her to hold.\r\n\r\n\"This sonnet is divided into four parts.[F] In the first I address Death\r\nby certain of her proper names; in the second, speaking to her, I tell\r\nthe reason why I am moved to blame her; in the third, I revile her; in\r\nthe fourth, I speak to a person undefined, although definite as regards\r\nmy intention. The second part begins at _Thou givest_; the third at _And\r\nif of every grace_; the fourth at _He who deserves_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: Dante calls this little poem a sonnet, although, strictly,\r\nthe name does not belong to it.]\r\n\r\nAfter this, Dante tells of a journey he was forced to take, in the\r\ndirection of the city to which the lady who had afforded him the means\r\nof disguising his real love had gone. He says, that, on the way, which\r\nhe calls the way of sighs, he met Love, who was sad in aspect, and clad\r\nlike a pilgrim, and that Love told him the name of another lady who must\r\nthenceforth serve as his screen to conceal his secret. He goes on to\r\nrelate, that, after his return,[G] he sought out this lady, and made her\r\nhis defence so effectually, that many persons spoke of it beyond the\r\nterms of courtesy, which weighed on him heavily. And on account of this\r\nlying talk which defamed him greatly, he says that Beatrice, \"the most\r\ngentle lady, who was the enemy of all the vices, and the queen of\r\nvirtue, passing by a certain place, denied me her most sweet salute, in\r\nwhich consisted all my bliss. And departing a little from the present\r\nsubject, I will declare that which her salutation effected within me.\r\nI say, then, that, whenever she appeared, in my hope for her admirable\r\nsalutation I no longer had an enemy, for a flame of charity possessed\r\nme which made me pardon every one who had done me wrong; and if at that\r\ntime any one had asked anything of me, my only answer would have been\r\n_Love_, and my face would have been clothed with humility. And when she\r\nwas near to giving me a salutation, a spirit of Love, destroying all the\r\nother spirits of the senses, drove out the feeble spirits of the sight,\r\nand said to them, 'Go and do honor to your lady,' and he stayed in their\r\nplace. And whoever had wished to know Love might have done so by looking\r\nat the trembling of my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: In his few words of introduction to the _Vita Nuova_, Dante\r\nimplies that he shall not copy out into his book all his compositions\r\nrelating to its subject. Some of the poems of this period, not included\r\nin the _Vita Nuova_, have been preserved, and we propose to refer to\r\nthem in their appropriate places. Compare with this passage Sonnet\r\nlxxix., _Poesie Liriche_, ed. Fraticelli,--\r\n\r\n  \"Se 'l bello aspetto non mi fosse tolto,\"--\r\n\r\nwhich was apparently written during Dante's absence from Beatrice.]\r\n\r\nAfter the salutation which had been wont to bring to him a joy almost\r\nbeyond his capacity had been refused to him, Dante went weeping to his\r\nchamber, where he could lament without being heard; and there he fell\r\nasleep, crying like a little child who has been beaten. And in his sleep\r\nhe had a vision of Love, who entered into talk with him, and bade him\r\nwrite a poem, adorned with sweet harmony, in which he should set forth\r\nthe truth and fidelity of his love for Beatrice, and should sue for her\r\npardon. Dante awoke at the ninth hour of the day, and at once began the\r\npoem, of which the following is a portion. He personifies his poem, and\r\nhe bids it\r\n\r\n  \"Tell her,--'O Lady, this his heart is stayed\r\n  On faithfulness so sure and firm,\r\n  Save to serve you it has no other care:\r\n  Early 'twas yours, and never has it strayed.'\r\n  But if she trust not what thou dost affirm,\r\n  Tell her to ask of Love, who will the truth declare;\r\n  And at the end, beg her, with humble prayer,\r\n  That she her pardon of its wrong would give;\r\n  Then let her bid that I no longer live,\r\n  And she shall see her servant quick obey.\"[H]\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: Compare Canz. x. and xi.]\r\n\r\nAfter this poem was finished, Dante describes what he calls \"a battle of\r\nthoughts\" concerning Love within his mind, and then goes on to relate\r\nthat it happened one day that he was taken, by a friend who thought to\r\ngive him pleasure, to a feast at which many ladies were present. \"They\r\nwere assembled,\" he says, \"to attend a lady who was married that day,\r\nand, according to the custom of the city, they bore her company at her\r\nfirst sitting at table in the dwelling of her new husband.\" Dante,\r\nbelieving thus to do pleasure to his friend, proposed to stand in\r\nwaiting upon these ladies. But at the moment of this intention he felt a\r\nsudden tremor, which caused him to lean for support against a painting\r\nwhich ran round the wall,[I] and, raising his eyes, he beheld Beatrice.\r\nHis confusion became apparent; and the ladies, not excepting Beatrice\r\nherself, laughed at his strange appearance. Then his friend took him\r\nfrom their presence, and having asked him what so ailed him, Dante\r\nreplied, \"I have set my feet on that edge of life beyond which no man\r\ncan go with intent to return.\" Then leaving him, he went to the chamber\r\nof tears, weeping and ashamed; and in his trouble he wrote a sonnet to\r\nBeatrice, in which he says, that, if she had known the cause of his\r\ntrouble, he believes that she would have felt pity for him.[J]\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: This is, perhaps, the earliest reference in modern\r\nliterature to the use of painting as a decoration for houses. It is\r\nprobable that it was a recent application of the art, and resulted from\r\nthe revival of interest in its works which accompanied the revival of\r\nthe art. We shall have occasion again to note a reference to painting.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: To this period, apparently, belong Sonnets xxix. and xxx.\r\nof the general collection. The last may not unlikely have been omitted\r\nin the _Vita Nuova_ on account of the tenderness with which the death of\r\nBeatrice had invested every memory of her, preventing the insertion of a\r\npoem which might seem harsh in its expression:--\r\n\r\n  \"I curse the day on which I first beheld\r\n  The light of thy betraying eyes.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing passage, like many others in the \"Vita Nuova,\" is full of\r\nthe intense and exaggerated expressions of passionate feeling. But this\r\nfeeling is recorded with a frank simplicity which carries conviction\r\nof the sincerity of emotion. It may be laughed at, but it cannot be\r\ndoubted. It is possible, though hardly probable, that the scene took\r\nplace at the wedding festival of Beatrice herself. She was married\r\nsometime previous to 1287, and unless a reference to this event be\r\nfound here, no notice of it is taken by Dante in what he has written\r\nconcerning her. That the fact of her marriage changed in no degree the\r\nfeeling with which Dante regarded her is plain. His love was of no low\r\nquality, to be altered by earthly circumstance. It was a love of the\r\nsoul. No change or separation that left the being untouched could part\r\nhim from it. To the marriage of true souls there was no impediment, and\r\nhe would admit none, in her being the wife of another. The qualities\r\nwhich she possessed as a maiden belonged to her no less as a wife.\r\n\r\nIt was in the same year, probably, as that in which the \"Vita Nuova\" was\r\ncomposed and published, that Dante himself was married to Gemma Donati.\r\nThere are stories that their married life was unhappy. But these stories\r\nhave not the weight of even contemporary gossip. Possibly they arose\r\nfrom the fact of the long separation between Dante and his wife during\r\nhis exile. Boccaccio insinuates more than he asserts, and he concludes\r\na vague declamation about the miseries of married life with the words,\r\n\"Truly I do not affirm that these things happened to Dante, _for I do\r\nnot know_.\" Dante keeps utter silence in his works,--certainly giving no\r\nreason to suppose that domestic trials were added to his other burdens.\r\nOne thing is known which deserves remembrance,--that, when, after some\r\nyears, a daughter was born to him, the name which she received was\r\nBeatrice.\r\n\r\nIn the next few pages of the \"Vita Nuova\" Dante describes various\r\nthoughts which came to his mind concerning his appearance when in\r\npresence of his lady; but, passing over these, we come to a passage\r\nwhich we give in full, as containing a delightful picture from Florence\r\nin its old time, and many sentences of sweet and characteristic feeling.\r\n\r\n\"Many persons had now learned from my looks the secret of my heart. And\r\nit happened that certain ladies, who well knew my heart, each of them\r\nhaving witnessed many of my discomfitures, had assembled together,\r\ntaking pleasure in each other's company. And I, by chance passing near\r\nthem, was addressed by one of these gentle ladies. She who called to me\r\nwas very graceful in her speech, so that when I reached them, and saw\r\nwell that my most gentle lady was not with them, reassuring myself, I\r\nsaluted them, and asked what might be their pleasure. The ladies were\r\nmany, and some of them were laughing together, and others looked at me,\r\nwaiting for what I might say, while others spoke among themselves, and\r\none of them, turning her eyes toward me, and calling me by name, said,\r\n'To what end dost thou love this lady, since thou canst not support her\r\npresence? Tell us, for it is certain that the object of such a love must\r\nbe a very strange one.' And when she had said these words to me, not\r\nonly she, but all the others, began to attend in expectation of my\r\nreply. Then I said to them, 'Ladies, the object of my love was, in\r\ntruth, the salutation of that lady of whom perhaps you speak; and in\r\nthat dwelt the bliss which was the end of all my desires. But since it\r\nhas pleased her to deny it to me, my lord Love, thanks be to him, has\r\nplaced all my bliss in that which cannot be taken from me.' Then these\r\nladies began to speak together, and, as we sometimes see rain falling\r\nmingled with beautiful snow, so, it seemed to me, I saw their words\r\nmingled with sighs. And after they had spoken for some time among\r\nthemselves, the same lady who had first spoken to me said to me, 'We\r\npray thee that thou wouldst tell us in what consists this thy bliss.'\r\nAnd I, replying to her, said, 'In those words which speak my lady's\r\npraise.' And she answered, 'If thou sayest truth in this, those words\r\nwhich thou hast spoken concerning thine own condition must have been\r\nwritten with another intention.'[K] Then I, thinking on these words,\r\nand, as it were, ashamed of myself, departed from them, and went, saying\r\nto myself, 'Since there is such bliss in those words which praise my\r\nlady, why has my speech been of other things?' And I proposed to take\r\nalways for my subject, henceforward, the praise of this most gentle\r\nlady. And thinking much on this, I seemed to myself to have taken too\r\nlofty a subject for my power, so that I did not dare to begin. Thus\r\nI delayed some days, with the desire to speak, and with a fear of\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: This refers to the sonnets Dante had written about his own\r\ntrouble and the conflict of his thoughts. It will be observed that the\r\nwords \"speak\" and \"speech\" are used in reference to poetic compositions.\r\nIn those days the poet was commonly called _il dicitore in rima_, \"the\r\nspeaker in rhyme,\" or simply _il dicitore_.]\r\n\r\n\"Then it happened, that, walking along a road, at the side of which ran\r\na very clear stream, so great a wish to speak came to me, that I began\r\nto think on the method I should observe; and I thought that to speak of\r\nher would not be becoming, unless I addressed my words to ladies,--and\r\nnot to every lady, but only to those who are gentle, and not mere\r\nwomen.[L] Then I say that my tongue spoke as if moved by its own accord,\r\nand said, 'Ladies who have intelligence of Love.' These words I laid by\r\nin my mind with great joy, thinking to take them for my beginning. And\r\nreturning to the city, after some days I began this Canzone:--[M]\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: The epithet which Dante constantly applies to Beatrice is\r\n\"most gentle,\" _gentillisima_, while other ladies are called _gentile_,\r\n\"gentle.\" Here he makes the distinction between the _donna_ and the\r\n_donna gentile_. The word is used with a signification similar to that\r\nwhich it has in our own early literature, and fuller than that which it\r\nnow retains. It refers both to race, as in the phrase \"of gentle birth,\"\r\nand to the qualities of character. \"Gentleness means the same as\r\nnobleness,\" says Dante, in the _Convito_; \"and by nobleness is meant the\r\nperfection of its own nature in anything.\" Tratt. iv. c. 14 16.\r\n\r\nThe delicacy and the dignity of meaning attaching to the word render it\r\nan epithet especially appropriate to Beatrice, as implying all that is\r\nloveliest in person and character. Its use in the _Vita Nuova_ is the\r\nmore to be remarked, as in the _Divina Commedia_ it is never applied to\r\nBeatrice. Its appropriateness ceased with her earthly life, for there\r\nwas \"another glory of the celestial body.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: This Canzone is one of the most beautiful of Dante's minor\r\npoems. We have preferred to give it in a literal translation, rather\r\nthan to attempt one in which the involved rhyme of the original should\r\nbe preserved, fearing lest this could not be done without sacrifice of\r\nthe meaning to the form. The original must be read by those who would\r\nunderstand its grace of expression combined with its depth of feeling.\r\nDante himself prized this Canzone, and represents Buonagiunta da Lucca\r\nin Purgatory as addressing him,--\r\n\r\n  \"Ma di s' io veggio qui colui che fuore\r\n  Trasse le nuove rime, cominciando:\r\n  _Donne, ch' avete intelletto d'Amore.\"\r\n\r\n\"But tell me if I see him who wrote the new rhymes, beginning, 'Ladies\r\nwho have intelligence of Love.'\" _Purgat_. c. xxiv. l. 49-51.]\r\n\r\n  \"Ladies who have intelligence of Love,\r\n  I of my lady wish with you to speak;\r\n  Not that to tell her praise in full I think,\r\n  But to discourse that I may ease my mind.\r\n\r\n  \"I say that when I think upon her worth,\r\n  So sweet doth Love make himself feel to me,\r\n  That if I then did not my courage lose,\r\n  Speaking I would enamor all mankind.\r\n  I do not wish so loftily to speak,\r\n  Lest I should fail and fall through very fear.\r\n  But of her gentle nature I will treat\r\n  With lightest touch compared with her desert,\r\n  Ladies and damsels bound to Love, with you;\r\n  For unto others this may not be told.\r\n\r\n  \"An Angel cries aloud in tongue divine,\r\n  And says, 'O Sire! in the world is seen\r\n  A miracle in action, that proceeds\r\n  From out a soul which far as here doth shine.'\r\n  The Heavens, which have no other want, indeed,\r\n  But that of her, demand her of her Lord,\r\n  And every Saint doth for this favor beg;\r\n  Only Compassion our part defends.\r\n  What sayeth God? what of Madonna means?\r\n  'O my delights, now be content in peace\r\n  That, while I please, your hope should there remain\r\n  Where dwelleth one who loss of her awaits,\r\n  And who shall say in Hell to the condemned,\r\n  I have beheld the hope of those in bliss.'\"[N]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote N: Note the reference implied in these words\r\n  to the journey of Dante through Hell.]\r\n\r\n  \"My lady is desired in high heaven.\r\n  Her virtues now will I make known to you.\r\n  I say, whoso a gentle lady would appear\r\n  Should go with her: for when she passeth by,\r\n  Love casts a frost upon all villain hearts,\r\n  So that their every thought doth freeze and die;\r\n  And whoso bears to stay and look on her\r\n  Will nobler thing become or else will die;\r\n  And when one finds that he may worthy be\r\n  To look on her, he doth his virtue prove:\r\n  For then that comes to him which gives him health,\r\n  And humbleth him till he forgets all wrong;\r\n  And God hath given a still greater grace,\r\n  That who hath spoke with her cannot end ill.\r\n\r\n  \"Love says of her, 'How can a mortal thing\r\n  Be thus in every part adorned and pure?'\r\n  Then, gazing on her, to himself he swears\r\n  That God in her a creature new designs.\r\n  Color of pearl doth clothe her, as it were,--\r\n  Not in excess, but most becomingly.\r\n  Whate'er of good Nature can make she is;\r\n  And by her model Beauty proves itself.\r\n  From out her eyes, wherever they may move,\r\n  Spirits inflamed with love do issue forth,\r\n  Which strike the eyes of whoso looks on her,\r\n  And enter so that every heart they find.\r\n  Love you behold depicted on her face,\r\n  On which with fixed look no one can gaze.\r\n\r\n  \"I know, Canzone, thou wilt go to speak\r\n  With many ladies, when I send thee forth;\r\n  And now I bid thee, having bred thee up\r\n  Like to a young and simple child of Love,\r\n  That where thou goest thou shouldst praying say,\r\n  'Teach me which way to go, for I am sent\r\n  To her with praise of whom I am adorned.'\r\n  And if thou wishest not to go in vain,\r\n  Remain not there where villain folk may be;\r\n  Endeavor, if thou mayst, to be acquaint\r\n  Only with ladies, or with courteous men,\r\n  Who thee will guide upon the quickest way.\r\n  Love thou wilt find in company with her,\r\n  And to them both commend me as thou shouldst.\"\r\n\r\nAfter explaining, according to his custom, and marking the divisions of\r\nthis poem, Dante copies out a sonnet in which he answers the question of\r\none of his friends, who, he says, perhaps entertaining an expectation of\r\nhim beyond what was due, asked him, 'What is Love?' Many of the poets\r\nof that time tried their hands in giving an answer to this difficult\r\nquestion, and Dante begins his with confirming the opinion expressed by\r\none of them:--\r\n\r\n  \"Love is but one thing with the gentle heart,\r\n  As in the saying of the sage we find.\"[O]\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: it is probable that Dante refers to the first of a Canzone\r\nby Guido Guinicelli, which says,\r\n\r\n  \"Within the gentle heart Love always stays,\"\r\n\r\n--a verse which he may have had still in his memory when he makes\r\nFrancesca da Rimini say, (_Inf_. v. 100,)\r\n\r\n  \"Love which by gentle heart is quickly learned.\"\r\n\r\nFor other definitions of Love as understood by the Italian poets of the\r\ntrecento, see Guido Cavalcanti's most famous and most obscure Canzone,\r\n_Donna mi priega_; the sonnet (No. xlii.) falsely ascribed to Dante,\r\n_Molti volendo dir che fosse Amore_; the sonnet by Jacopo da Lentino,\r\n_Amore è un desio che vien dal core_; and many others.]\r\n\r\nAnother sonnet follows upon this, telling how this Love was awakened by\r\nBeatrice and beginning with the exquisite praise,\r\n\r\n  \"Within her eyes my lady beareth Love,\r\n  So that who looks on her is gentle made.\"[P]\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: Compare with this Sonnet xl.,--\r\n\r\n  \"Dagli occhi della mia donna si muove.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nNot many days after this, the father of Beatrice died.[Q] \"And inasmuch\r\nas it is the custom in the above-mentioned city for ladies to assemble\r\nwith ladies, and men with men, in such affliction, many ladies assembled\r\nat the house where Beatrice was weeping piteously. And seeing certain of\r\nthem returning from her, I heard them speak of this most gentle lady,\r\nhow she was lamenting.... When these ladies had passed, I remained in\r\nsuch grief that tears began to fall, and, putting my hands before my\r\neyes, I covered my face. And if it had not been that I expected to hear\r\nfurther of her, for I stood near by where most of the ladies who came\r\nfrom her passed, I should have hidden myself as soon as the tears\r\nassailed me. While I still delayed, more ladies passed by, talking\r\ntogether and saying, 'Who of us should ever be joyful after hearing this\r\nlady speak so piteously?' After these others passed, who said, as they\r\nwent by, 'This one who is here weeps neither more nor less than if he\r\nhad seen her as we have.' And then others said of me, 'See! so overcome\r\nis he, that he seems not himself.' And thus these ladies passing by, I\r\nheard speech of her and of myself.\" And going away, after this, he wrote\r\ntwo sonnets, telling of what he had seen and heard.[R]\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q: Folco Portinari died December 31, 1289.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote R: Compare with this passage Sonnet xlvi., which seems to have\r\nbeen written on this occasion;--\r\n\r\n  \"Voi, donne, che pietoso atto mostrate,\"\r\n\r\nand Sonnet xlvii.,--\r\n\r\n  \"Onde venite voi, cosi pensose?\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt happened not long after this time that Dante was seized with grievous\r\nillness, which reduced him to such a state of weakness that he lay as\r\none unable to move. And on the ninth day, suffering greatly, he thought\r\nof his lady, and, reflecting on the frailty of life even at its best,\r\nthe thought struck him that even the most gentle Beatrice must at some\r\ntime die. And upon this, such consternation seized him that his fancy\r\nbegan to wander, and, he says, \"It seemed to me that I saw ladies, with\r\nhair dishevelled, and marvellously sad, pass weeping by, and that I saw\r\nthe sun grow dark, so that the stars showed themselves of such a color\r\nas to make me deem they wept. And it appeared to me that the birds as\r\nthey flew fell dead, and that there were great earthquakes. And struck\r\nwith wonder at this fantasy, and greatly alarmed, I imagined that a\r\nfriend came to me, who said, 'Dost thou not know? Thy admirable lady has\r\ndeparted from this world.' Then I began to weep very piteously, and wept\r\nnot only in imagination, but with my eyes shedding real tears. Then I\r\nimagined that I looked toward heaven, and it seemed to me that I saw a\r\nmultitude of angels who were returning upwards, having before them a\r\nlittle cloud of exceeding whiteness. It seemed to me that these angels\r\nsang gloriously, and that the words of their song were these: '_Osanna\r\nin excelsis!_'--and other than these I did not hear.[S]\r\n\r\n[Footnote S: In the _Divina Commedia_ frequent reference is made to the\r\nsinging of Osanna by the Angels. See _Purgat_. xi. 11; xxix. 51; _Par_.\r\nvii. 1; xxviii. 94, 118; xxxii. 135; and especially viii. 28.]\r\n\r\n\"Then the heart in which abode such great love seemed to say to me, 'It\r\nis true that our lady lies dead.' And thereupon I seemed to go to behold\r\nthe body in which that most noble and blessed soul had been. And the\r\nerring fancy was so powerful that it showed to me this lady dead, and it\r\nappeared to me that ladies were covering her head with a white veil, and\r\nthat her face had such an aspect of humility that it seemed to say, 'I\r\nbehold the beginning of peace.'\"\r\n\r\nThen Dante called upon Death to come to him; and when he had beheld in\r\nhis imagination the sad mysteries which are performed for the dead, he\r\nseemed to return to his own chamber. And so strong was his imagining,\r\nthat, weeping, he said with his true voice, \"O most beautiful soul! how\r\nis he blessed who beholds thee!\" Upon this, a young and gentle lady, who\r\nwas watching by his bed, thinking that he was grieving for his own pain,\r\nbegan to weep; whereon other ladies who were in the chamber drew near\r\nand roused him from his dream. Then they asked him by what he had been\r\ntroubled; and he told all that he had seen in fancy, keeping silence\r\nonly with regard to the name of Beatrice; and when, some time after, he\r\nrecovered from his illness, he wrote a poem which related his vision.\r\n\r\nThe next incident of his new life which Dante tells is one of a\r\ndifferent nature, and of pleasant character. One day he saw Love coming\r\nto him full of joy; and his own heart became so joyful that it seemed to\r\nhim it could not be his heart, so changed was its condition. Then he saw\r\napproaching him a lady of famous beauty, who had been the lady of his\r\nfirst friend. Her name was Giovanna, but on account of her beauty she\r\nwas called Primavera, which means _Spring_. And with her was Beatrice.\r\nThen Love, after they had passed, explained the hidden meaning of the\r\nname Primavera, and said, that, by one considering subtilely, Beatrice\r\nwould be called _Love_, on account of the great resemblance she bore to\r\nhim. Then Dante, thinking over these things, wrote this sonnet to his\r\nfriend, believing that he still admired the beauty of this gentle\r\nPrimavera:--\r\n\r\n  \"An amorous spirit in my heart who lay\r\n    I felt awaken from his slumber there;\r\n    And then I saw Love come from far away,\r\n    But scarce I knew him for his joyous air.\r\n\r\n  \"'Honor to me,' he said, 'think now to pay,'\r\n    And all his words with smiles companioned were.\r\n    Then as my lord awhile with me did stay,\r\n    Along the way whence he appeared whilere\r\n\r\n  \"The Lady Joan and Lady Bice I see,\r\n    Coming toward the place wherein I was;\r\n    And the two marvels side by side did move.\r\n\r\n  \"Then, as my mind now tells it unto me,\r\n    Love said, 'This one is Spring, and this, because\r\n    She so resembleth me, is named Love.'\"[T]\r\n\r\n[Footnote T: See the charming Sonnet lii.:--\r\n\r\n  \"Guido vorrei che tu, e Lappo, ed io.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter this sonnet, Dante enters on a long and fanciful discourse on the\r\nuse of figurative language, to explain how he speaks of Love as if it\r\nwere not a mere notion of the intellect, but as if it had a corporeal\r\nexistence. There is much curious matter in this dissertation, and it is\r\none of the most striking examples that could be found of the youthful\r\ncharacter of the literature at the time in which Dante was writing, and\r\nof the little familiarity which those in whose hands his book was likely\r\nto fall possessed of the common forms of poetry, and of the style of the\r\nancient Latin poets.\r\n\r\nReturning from this digression, he says: \"This most gentle lady, of whom\r\nthere has been discourse in what precedes, reached such favor among the\r\npeople, that when she passed along the way persons ran to see her, which\r\ngave me wonderful delight. And when she was near any one, such modesty\r\ntook possession of his heart, that he did not dare to raise his eyes or\r\nto return her salutation; and to this, should any one doubt it, many,\r\nas having experienced it, could bear witness for me. She, crowned and\r\nclothed with humility, took her way, displaying no pride in that which\r\nshe saw and heard. Many, when she had passed, said, 'This is not a\r\nwoman; rather is she one of the most beautiful angels of heaven.' Others\r\nsaid, 'She is a miracle. Blessed be the Lord who can perform such a\r\nmarvel!' I say that she showed herself so gentle and so full of all\r\nbeauties, that those who looked on her felt within themselves a delight\r\nso pure and sweet that they could not smile; nor was there any who could\r\nlook at her and not feel need at first to sigh. These and more wonderful\r\nthings proceeded from her, marvellously and in reality. Wherefore I,\r\nthinking on all this, proposed to say some words, in which I would\r\nexhibit her marvellous and excellent influences, to the end that not\r\nonly those who might actually behold her, but also others, might know of\r\nher whatever words could tell. Then I wrote this sonnet:--\r\n\r\n  \"So gentle and so modest doth appear\r\n  My lady when she giveth her salute,\r\n  That every tongue becometh trembling\r\n     mute,\r\n  Nor do the eyes to look upon her dare.\r\n\r\n  \"And though she hears her praises, she doth\r\n     go\r\n  Benignly clothèd with humility,\r\n  And like a thing come down she seems\r\n     to be\r\n  From heaven to earth, a miracle to show.\r\n\r\n  \"So pleaseth she whoever cometh nigh,\r\n  She gives the heart a sweetness through\r\n     the eyes,\r\n  Which none can understand who doth\r\n     not prove.\r\n\r\n  \"And from her lip there seems indeed to move\r\n  A spirit sweet and in Love's very guise,\r\n  Which goeth saying to the soul, 'Ah,\r\n     sigh!'\"[U]\r\n\r\n[Footnote U: Perhaps the spirit of the latter part of this sonnet may be\r\nbetter conveyed by rendering thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"So pleaseth she all those approaching nigh\r\n      her,\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n  Which goeth saying to the soul, 'Aspire!'\"\r\n\r\nCompare the very beautiful Ballata vi. and Sonnet xlviii., beginning,\r\n\r\n  \"Di donne io vidi una gentile schiera.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nWith this incomparable sonnet we close that part of the \"Vita Nuova\"\r\nwhich relates to the life of Beatrice. It fitly completes the golden\r\nrecord of youth. Its tender lines are the epitaph of happy days, and in\r\nthem is found that mingled sweetness and sadness which in this world are\r\nalways the final expression of love. Its tone is that of the wind of\r\nautumn sighing among the leaves of spring. Beneath its outward meaning\r\nlies a prophecy of joy,--but that joy is to be reached only through the\r\ngates of death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"A draught of water, maiden fair,\"\r\n    I said to the girl beside the well.\r\n  Oh, sweet was the smile on her face of guile,\r\n    As she gave me to drink,--that witch of hell!\r\n\r\n  I drank, and sweet was the draught I drank,\r\n    And thanked the giver, and still she smiled;\r\n  And her smile like a curse on my spirit sank,\r\n    Till my face grew wan, and my heart grew wild.\r\n\r\n  And lo! the light from the day was gone,\r\n    And gone was maiden, and gone was well:\r\n  The dark instead, like a wall of stone,\r\n    And rivers that roared through the dark, and fell.\r\n\r\n  Was it the draught, or was it the smile,\r\n    Or my own false heart? Ah, who shall tell?\r\n  But the black waves beat at my weary feet,\r\n    And sits at my side the witch of hell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDID I?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Giorno d'orrore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWheels rolled away in the distance; the corner of a gray cloak fluttered\r\nwhere the drive turns down hill. From under the fore-wheel of Juggernaut\r\nI struggled back to life with a great sob, that died before it sounded.\r\nI looked about the library for some staff to help me to my feet again.\r\nThe porphyry vases were filled with gorgeous boughs, leaves of deep\r\nscarlet, speckled, flushed, gold-spotted, rimmed with green, dashed with\r\norange, tawny and crimson, blood-sprinkled, faint clear amber; all hues\r\nand combinations of color rioted and revelled in the crowded clusters.\r\nTo what hand but hers could so much beauty have gathered? to what eye\r\nbut hers did the magnificent secrets of Nature reveal themselves, so\r\nthat out of a whole forest her careless straying hand should bring only\r\nits culminating glories, its most perfect results, whether of leaf or\r\nflower or fruit. For in an urn of tintless alabaster, that had lain\r\ncenturies in the breathless dust and gloom of an Egyptian tomb, that\r\nhand had set a sheaf of gentians, every fringed cup blue as the wild\r\nriver when a noon sky tints it, or as the vaulted azure of a June\r\nmidnight on the edge of the Milky Way,--a sheaf no Ceres owned, no\r\nfoodfull garner coveted, but the satiating aliment of beauty, fresh as\r\nif God that hour had pronounced them good, and set his sign-manual upon\r\neach delicate tremulous petal, that might have been sapphire, save for\r\nits wistful translucence. And on the teapoy in the window stood two\r\ndainty baskets of clean willow, in which we had that day brought home\r\nchestnuts from the wood;--mine was full of nuts, but they were small and\r\nangular and worm-eaten, as the fruitage of a wet season might well be;\r\nhers scantily freighted, but every nut round, full, and glossy, perfect\r\nfrom its cruel husk, a specimen, a type of its kind. And on the handle\r\nof the basket hung a little kid glove. I looked at it closely; the\r\ntiny finger-tops and oval nails had left light creases on the delicate\r\nleather, and an indescribable perfume, in which violet predominated,\r\ndrove away the vile animal scent that pervades such gloves. I flung it\r\non the fire.\r\n\r\nAll about the room lay books that were not of my culling, from the oak\r\ncases, whose every door stood ajar,--novels innumerable,--\"The Arabian\r\nNights,\" Vaughan's \"Silex Scintillans,\" with a scarlet leaf laid in\r\nagainst \"Peace,\" and \"Tennyson\" turned on its face at \"Fatima,\" a heavy\r\nvolume of French moral philosophy, a Methodist hymn-book, Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne's \"Hydriotaphia,\" and a gilded red-bound history of \"Five Little\r\nPigs.\"\r\n\r\nI rang the bell, and ordered all the books to be gathered up and put\r\ninto an old bookcase, long banished to a dark attic. I walked to the\r\nfire and leaned my head against the mantel. The embers were all dead; in\r\nthe gray ashes was the print of a little foot, whose arched instep had\r\nleft no trace between the light track of the small heel and the deeper\r\nimpression that the slender toe had left. That footprint told the\r\nsecret of her airy motion,--that step so akin to flight, that on an\r\noverhanging mountain-ledge I had more than once held my breath, looking\r\nto see her extended wings float over the silent tree-tops below, or\r\nlonged to grasp her carelessly trailed shawl, that I might detain her\r\nupon earth. To me the track had yet another language. An hour before,\r\nas I stood there beside her, the bitter passion of a man solitary and\r\ndesperate shaking every faculty before the level rays of her scornful\r\neye, she had set her embroidered slipper in the ashes, and said,--\"Look!\r\nI leave a print there which the first breath of air shall dissipate;\r\nall fire becomes ashes, and ashes blow away,\"--and so left me. I stood\r\nbefore the fire, that had been, still looking at that foot-mark; my\r\nbrain was stunned and stupid, my heart beat slow and loud; I knew\r\nnothing, I felt nothing. I was nothing. Presently a bell rang.\r\n\r\nThe world is full of magicians, transformations, magnetic miracles,\r\njuggling, chemical astonishments, moral gymnastics, hypocrisies, lies of\r\nwonder,--but what is so strange, so marvellous, so inexplicable, as the\r\npower of conventions? One minute found me tempting the blackness of\r\ndarkness, every idea astray and reeling, every emotion benumbed; the\r\nnext, a bell rang, and I went to the tea-table, sat in my own place,\r\nanswered my mother's questions, resumed the politenesses and habits of\r\ndaily life, seemed to be myself to those who had known me always,--ate,\r\ndrank, jested,--was a man,--no more the trodden ashes under a girl's\r\nfoot, no longer the sport of a girl's cool eye, no slave, no writhing\r\nidolater under the car-wheel; and this lasted-half an hour! You have\r\nseen the horses of Pharaoh following the glittering sand-track of the\r\nJudaean host, walled in with curling beryl battlements, over whose\r\ncrests the white sea-foam dares no more laugh and threaten? You know\r\nthose curved necks clothed with strength, the bent head whose nostrils\r\nflare with pride, the tossed and waving mane, the magnificent grace of\r\nthe nervous shoulder, the great, intelligent, expectant eyes? Suddenly\r\nthe roar of waves at the farther shore! Look at that head! strong and\r\nquiet no more; terror erects the quivering ears; the nostril sinks and\r\ncontracts with fear; the eye glares and glances from side to side, mad\r\nwith prescient instinct; the corded veins that twist forkedly from the\r\nlip upward swell to the utmost tension of the fine skin; that sweeping\r\nmane rises in rough undulations, the forelock is tossed back, the\r\nshoulder grows rigid with horror, the chest rises with a long indrawn\r\nbreath of dismay. Horrible beyond all horrid sounds, the yell of a horse\r\nin mortal fear. Do you hear it? No,--it is a picture,--the picture of a\r\nmoment between one animal that sees the impending fate, and another that\r\nhas not yet caught it;--it is human that such moments interpose between\r\ntwo oceans of agony, that man can momentarily control the rush of a sea\r\nwhich the brute must yield to.--So the sea rushed back.\r\n\r\nAll night long, all the long night!--long as lifetimes are, measured\r\nwith slow-dropping arteries that drip away living blood. Once I watched\r\nby a dying woman; wild October rains poured without, but all unheard; in\r\nthe dim-lit room, scented with quaint odors of lackered cases and chests\r\nof camphor-wood, heavy with perfumes that failed to revive, and hushed\r\nwith whispers of hopeless comment, that delicate frame and angelic\r\nface, which the innumerable lines of age could only exalt and sweeten,\r\nshivered with the frosts of death; every breath was a sob; every sigh,\r\nanguish; the terrible restlessness of the struggle between soul and body\r\nin their parting writhed in every limb;--but there were no words other\r\nthan broken cries of prayer, only half-heard on earth, till at length\r\nthe tender, wistful eyes unclosed, and in a hoarse whisper, plaintive\r\nbeyond expression, full of a desolate and immortal weariness, bearing a\r\nconviction of eternity and exhaustion that words cannot hope to utter,\r\nshe said, \"Will it never be morning?\" And so this night stayed its pace;\r\nmy room grew narrow and low; the ceiling pressed on my head; the walls\r\nforever clasped me, yet receded ever as I paced the floor; the floor\r\nfell in strange waves under me,--yet I walked steadily, up and down, up\r\nand down! Still the night stayed. Fever set its hurried pulses fleeting\r\nlike wild-fire through every vein; a band of hot iron pressed above my\r\neyes;--but these were adjuncts; the curse consumed me within. In every\r\nmoment I heard those calm and fatal words, \"I do not love you,\" sounding\r\nclear and sweet through the dull leaden air of night,--an air full of\r\nghostly sounds, sighs about the casements, creaking stairs, taps at\r\nthe window, light sounds of feet in the long hall below; all falling\r\nheedless on my ear, for my ghost walked and talked with me, a ghastly\r\nreality, the galvanized corpse of a murdered life.\r\n\r\nStill the night stayed. A weight of lead pressed on my brain and\r\nconcentrated it to frantic power; the months in which I had known her,\r\nthe only months I could call life, came back to me inch by inch, grain\r\nby grain. I recalled our first meeting,--the sudden springing into\r\nacquaintance,--the sympathetic power that had transfused those cold blue\r\neyes into depths of tenderness and pity,--the gay and genial manner that\r\naroused and charmed me,--the scornful lip that curled at the world for\r\nits worldliness,--that fresh imagination, which, like the spirit of\r\nfrost, decked the commonest things with beauty; and I recalled those\r\nearly letters that had passed between us,--mine, insipid enough,--hers,\r\npiquant, graphic, refined, tender, delicately passionate, sparkling,\r\nfull of lofty thought and profound feeling. Good God! could she not\r\nhave taken my heart, and wrung it, and thrown it away, under some more\r\ncommonplace pretext than the profaned name of Friendship? Her friend!\r\nIt is true I had called myself her friend; I had been strenuous in the\r\nnomenclature to quiet my own conscience,--to satisfy her conventional\r\nscruples; but had she no instinct to interpret the pretence? What friend\r\never lived on every look, studied every phrase, watched every action and\r\nexpression, was so torn with jealousy and racked with doubt, bore\r\nso humbly with caprices, and forgave every offence so instantly and\r\nutterly,--nay, was scarce conscious that anything her soul entertained\r\ncould be an offence, could be wrong? Friendship!--ah, that deity is calm\r\nand serene; that firm lip and pale cheek do not flush with apprehension\r\nor quiver with passion; that tranquil eye does not shine with anything\r\nbut quiet tears. Rather call the dusky and dark-haired Twilight, whose\r\npensive face is limned against the western hills, by the name of that\r\nfierce and fervid Noon that stands erect under the hot zenith, instinct\r\nwith the red blood of a thousand summers, casting her glittering tresses\r\nabroad upon the south-wind, and holding in her hands the all-unfolded\r\nrose of life. And if I was only her friend, was that a reason why she\r\nshould permit in me the thousand intimacies of look and caress that are\r\nthe novitiate of love? Was it a friend's calm duty to give me her tiny\r\nhand to hold in mine, that I might fold and unfold the rosy fingers, and\r\nexplore the white dimples that were its ornamenting gems,--to rest her\r\ntired head against my shoulder, even,--watching all day by the chair\r\nwhere pain, life-long ministrant, held me on the rack?--was it only\r\nfriendly that she should press her soft little mouth to mine, and soothe\r\nme into quiet as a mother soothes her last, her dearest child? No! no!\r\nno! never could that be! She knew, she had known, that I loved her!\r\nDeliberate cruelty outlined those lovely lips; every statue-like\r\nmoulding of that proud face told the hard and unrelenting nature of the\r\nsoul within. God forgive her!--the exclamation escaped me unaware, and\r\nrecoiled in a savage exultation that such treachery had no forgiveness\r\nin heaven or on earth,--one gleam of desperate satisfaction in that\r\nblack night. But in its light, what new madness seized me? I had held\r\nher stainless and holy, intact of evil or deceit; what was she now? My\r\nwhole brain reeled; the foundations were taken away; earth and heaven\r\nmet; even as when the West forges tempest and lightning-bolts upon its\r\nmelancholy hills, brooding and muttering hour by hour, till at length\r\nthe livid gloom rushes upward against sun and stars, and the blackening\r\nsky shuts down upon the blackened earth, cowering at the shock, and the\r\ntorrents and flames are let loose upon their prey,--so an accumulated\r\nstorm of unutterable agony flung wave on wave above me, wrecked and\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nStill the night stayed; the black mass of forest that swept up the\r\nhill-side stood in mystical gloom, in silence that could be felt; when\r\nat once,--not suddenly,--as if the night could forbear no more, but\r\nmust utter some chord with the culmination of midnight horrors, a bird\r\nuttered one sharp cry, desolate utterly, hopeless, concentred, as if a\r\nkeen blade parted its heart and the outraged life within remonstrated\r\nand despaired,--despaired not of life, for still the note repeated its\r\nmonotone, but of death, of period to its pangs. That cry entered into my\r\nbrain; it was unjust of Nature so to taunt me, so to express where I was\r\nspeechless; yet I could not shut it out. A pitiful chill of flesh and\r\nsense seized me; I was cold,--oh, how cold!--the fevered veins crept now\r\nin sluggish ice; sharp thrills of shivering rigor racked me from head\r\nto foot; pain had dulled its own capacity; wrapped in every covering my\r\nroom afforded, with blunted perceptions, and a dreadful consciousness of\r\nlost vitality, which, even when I longed to die, appalled me with the\r\ntouch of death's likeness, I sunk on the floor,--and it was morning!\r\n\r\nMorning! \"a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of\r\nthick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains!\" A pale sun\r\nlit the earth, but earth and sky were black,--no sun touched me in heart\r\nor eye; I saw nothing, felt nothing, but heavy and impenetrable gloom.\r\nYet again the ceremonies of life prevailed, and my real life slept\r\nundiscovered. Whatever pallor or shadow lined my face was no stranger\r\nthere at that hour. The gray morning passed away; the village on the\r\nhill sent down busy sounds of labor and cheer; flies buzzed on the sunny\r\npane, doors clicked and slammed in the house, fires crackled behind the\r\nshining fire-dogs. I went to the library,--_the first breath of\r\nair_ had--_dissipated it_! What a mockery! I went away,--out of the\r\nhouse,--on, anywhere. Dry leaves rustled in my path and sent up a faint\r\naromatic breath as they were crushed in the undried dew; squirrels\r\nchattered in the wood; here and there a dropping nut stirred the silence\r\nwith deliberate fall, or an unseen grouse whirred through the birches at\r\nmy approaching step. The way was trodden and led me by gradual slope and\r\nnative windings through the dull red oaks downward to the river. Once on\r\nthe path, a low cluster of sweet fern attracted me;--strange assertion\r\nof human personality, that in the deepest grief a man knows and notices\r\nthe trivial features of Nature with microscopic fidelity! that the\r\nveining of a leaf or the pencilling of a blossom will attract the eye\r\nthat no majesty or beauty of unwonted manifestation could light with\r\none appreciative spark! Is it that the injured and indignant soul\r\nso vindicates its own essential and divine strength, and says,\r\nunconsciously, to the most uncontrolled anguish, \"There is in me a life\r\nno mortal accident can invade; the breath of God is not altogether\r\nextinct in any blast of man's devising; shake, torture, assault the\r\nouter tenement,--darken its avenues with fire to stifle, and drench its\r\napproaches with seas to drown,--there is that within that God alone can\r\nvanquish,--yours is but a finite terror\"? Half-crazed as I was, the\r\nfern-bed attracted me, as I said, and I flung myself wearily down on the\r\nleaves, whose healing and soothing odor stole up like a cloud all about\r\nme; and I lay there in the sun, noting with pertinacious accuracy every\r\nleaf or bloom that was within the range of sight,--the dark green leaves\r\nof the wax-flower springing from their red stem, veined and threaded\r\nwith creamy white, stiff and quaint in form and growth,--the bending\r\nsprays of goldenrod that bowed their light and brittle stems over me,\r\nswaying gently to and fro in the gentle wind,--the tiny scarlet cups of\r\nmoss that held a little drop of dew brimming over their rims of fire, a\r\nspark in the ashy gray moss-beds where they stood,--the shrinking and\r\nwan wood-asters, branched out widely, but set with meagre bloom,--every\r\nhalf-tint of the lichens, that scantily fed from the relentless granite\r\nrock, yet clung to its stern face with fearless persistence,--the rough\r\nseams and velvet green moss-tufts of the oak-trunks,--the light that\r\npierced the dingy hue of oak-leaves with vivid and informing crimson:\r\nall these stamped themselves on my mind with inevitable minuteness; the\r\ngreat wheel of Fate rolled over me, and I bore the marks even of its\r\nornamental rim; the grooves in its tire left traces of its track.\r\n\r\nAt length the minuteness of Nature oppressed me. The thousand odors,\r\nspicy, acrid, aromatic, honeyed, that an autumnal dew expressed from\r\nevery herb, through that sense that is the slave of association,\r\nrecalled my youth, my boyhood, the free and careless hours I knew no\r\nmore, when, on just such mornings of hazy and splendid autumns, I had\r\njust so lain on the fern-beds, heedless of every beauty that haunted the\r\nwoods, full of fresh life, rejoicing in dog and gun and rod as no man\r\never rejoices in title-deeds or stocks or hoarded gold. The reminiscence\r\nstung me to the quick; I could endure no more. Rising, I went on, and\r\nthrough the oak-wood came to the brink of the river, and in a vague\r\nweariness sat down upon the massive water-wall, and looked over into\r\nthe dark brown stream. It was deep below me; a little above were clear\r\nshallows, where the water-spider pursued its toil of no result, and\r\ncast upon the yellow sand beneath a shadow that was not a shadow, but,\r\nrefracted from the broken surface, spots of glittering light, clustered\r\nlike the diamonds of a brooch, separate, yet linked, and tremulously\r\nbright. This, also, did I note; but below my feet the river flowed\r\ndarker and more deeply, darkness and depth broken only by the glancing\r\nfins of little fishes, that slanted downward, catching a gleam as they\r\nwent. No other light pierced the sullen, apprehensive flood that rolled\r\npast in tranquil gloom, leaden from the skies above, and without ripple\r\nor fall to break its glassy quiet. Beside the wall grew a witch-hazel;\r\nin my vague grasp at outside objects I saw it, full of wrinkled and\r\nweird bloom, as if the golden fleece had strayed thereby, and caught\r\nupon the ungainly twigs of the scragged bush, and left glittering curled\r\nthreads in flecked bunches scattered on every branch; the strange\r\nspell-sweet odor of the flowers struck me before I saw them, and the\r\nwhole expression of their growth affected me with helpless admiration,\r\nso brave as it was!--defying all Autumn to daunt the immortal Spring\r\never surviving in its soul,--here, on October's edge, putting out its\r\nfreshness and perfume, as if seasons were an accident, and circumstance\r\na chimera,--as if will, good-will, will to be of strength and cheer,\r\nwere potent enough to laugh at Nature, and trust the God-given\r\nconsciousness within, whatever adverse fate ruled and triumphed without.\r\nNot that all these ideas came to me then, else perhaps I had been spared\r\nthat morning's experience; but they entered my brain as lightning is\r\nsometimes said to enter a tree and stamp some image from without\r\nupon its heart, thereafter to be revealed by the hewing axe and the\r\npersistent saw. No! I sat by the river and looked down into its dark\r\nserenity, and again the horror of the past day swept over me with fresh\r\nforce. Could I live? The unswerving river lay before me; in its bed\r\nnothing stirred; neither pang nor passion in those chill depths could\r\nutter a cry; there she could not come; there was rest. I did not yield;\r\noh, no, I did not yield! I resisted,--passively. I laid hold upon the\r\neternal fact that there was a God; the blind and blank universe spun\r\nabout me; its pillars of support wavered like waterspouts; all that I\r\nhad ever believed or loved whirled up and down in one howling chaos,\r\nand circled through all space in clouds of dust and floating atoms; but\r\nthrough all I knew there was a God,--feel it I could not, neither did I\r\nsee nor did one of Nature's tongues spell me the lesson,--I only knew\r\nit. And I did not, no, I did not rush before Him; but I lay at the\r\nbottom of the river.\r\n\r\nI have heard it said that drowning persons recall, as by a sudden\r\nomniscience, all their past lives, as soon as the water closes above\r\nthem and the first shock of horror is past. It was not so with me. I\r\nremembered nothing beyond the events of the past week; but, by some\r\nstrange action of the mind, as soon as the gasping sense of an unnatural\r\nelement passed away, my thoughts went forward. I became, as it were,\r\nanother man; and above me on the bank I saw calmly the stone where my\r\nliving double had left his cripple's cane, and thought to myself for one\r\nsharp moment, \"Fool!\"--for I looked forward. _If I had not drowned_,\r\nthat was the key-note of the theme. Something that was me and was not me\r\nrose up from the water-wall and went away,--a man racked and broken by\r\na great sorrow, it is true, but a man conscious of God. Life had turned\r\nits darkest page for him, but there was the impassable fact that it was\r\nthe darkest; no further depths remained to dread; the worst had come,\r\nand he looked it in the face and studied it; suffer he might, but\r\nwith full knowledge of every agony. Life had been wrecked, but living\r\nremained. Calmly he took up the cripple's cane and went home; the\r\nbirds sang no song,--after tempests they do not sing until the sun\r\nshines,--neither did the blossoms give him any greeting. Nature wastes\r\nno trivialities on such grief; the mother, whose child comes in to her\r\nbroken-limbed and wounded, does not give it sugar-plums and kisses, but\r\nwaits in silence till the surgeon has done his kindly and appalling\r\noffice,--then, it may be, she sings her boy to sleep!\r\n\r\nBut this man took up life again and conquered it. Home grew about him\r\ninto serenity and cheer; as from the roots of a felled tree a thousand\r\nverdant offshoots spring, tiny in stature, but fresh and vivid in\r\nfoliage, so out of this beheaded love arose a crowd of sweet affections\r\nand tender services that made the fraternity of man seem possible, and\r\nillustrated the pervasive care of God. He went out into life, and from\r\na heart wrung with all man can endure, and a brain tested in the fire,\r\nspoke burning and fluent words of strength and consolation to hundreds\r\nwho, like him, had suffered, but were sinking under what he had borne.\r\nAnd these words carried in them a reviving virtue. Men blessed him\r\nsilently, and women sang him in their hearts as they sing hymns of\r\nprayer. Honors clustered about him as mosses to a rock; Fame relented,\r\nand gave him an aureole in place of a crown; and Love, late, but sweeter\r\nthan sweet, like the last sun-ripened fruit of autumn, made honors and\r\nfame alike endurable. This man conquered, and triumphed in the victory.\r\n\r\nI held out my hand in that water and touched--a skeleton! What! had any\r\nother man preceded me? I looked at it; it was the water-washed frame of\r\na horse,--brutes together! And death was at hand; the grasp tightened\r\non my breast with that acrid sense of weight and suffocation that the\r\nredundant blood suffusing the lungs must needs produce. \"The soul of the\r\nbrute goeth downward.\" Coward! what might not life have been? and I had\r\nlost it!--lost it for the sting of a honey-bee!--for the contempt of a\r\nwoman! Every magnificent possibility, every immortal power, every hope\r\nof a future, tantalizing in its grand mystery, all lost! What if that\r\nsweeping star-seraph that men call a comet, speeding through heaven in\r\nits lonely splendor, with nitent head, and pinions trailing with the\r\nvery swiftness and strength of its onward flight, should shudder from\r\nits orbit, fling into star-strewn space its calm and awful glory, and\r\ngo crashing down into the fury and blackness of chaos, carrying with it\r\nwrecks of horror, and the yelling fragments of spheres no longer choral,\r\nbut smitten with the lawless stroke of a creature regardless of its\r\nCreator, an orb that made its solitary fate, and carried across the\r\norder and the law of God ruin and wreck embodied?\r\n\r\nAnd I had a soul;--I had flung it away; I had set my will up for my\r\ndestiny, and the one had worked out the other. But had I? When that\r\ndevilish suggestion came to me on the bank, did I entertain it? Have I\r\nnot said how I grasped at the great idea of a God, and held it with a\r\ndeath-gripe in the midst of assault? How did I come in the water? I did\r\nnot plunge nor fall. No shock of horror chilled me; no remembrance of\r\na voluntary assent to the Tempter could I recall. I was there, it was\r\ntrue; but was I guilty? Did I, in the eyes of any watching angel,\r\nconsciously cast my life, brittle and blind as it was, away in that\r\nfashion? In the water, helpless now for any effort after upper air,\r\nside by side with the fleshless anatomy of a brute, over-sailed by gray\r\nfishes with speckled sides, whose broad, unwinking eyes glared at me\r\nwith maddening shine and stare,--oppressed, and almost struggling, yet\r\nall unable to achieve the struggle with the curdling blood that gorged\r\nevery vein and air-cell with the hurried rush of death,--did I go out of\r\nthis life red with the sin of murder? Did I commit suicide?\r\n\r\nWho knows?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINISTER'S WOOING.\r\n\r\n[Continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that man and woman come together in intimate association,\r\nunless influences are at work more subtile and mysterious than the\r\nsubjects of them dream. Even in cases where the strongest ruling force\r\nof the two sexes seems out of the question, there is still something\r\npeculiar and insidious in their relationship. A fatherly old gentleman,\r\nwho undertakes the care of a sprightly young girl, finds, to his\r\nastonishment, that little Miss spins all sorts of cobwebs round him.\r\nGrave professors and teachers cannot give lessons to their female pupils\r\njust as they give them to the coarser sex, and more than once has the\r\nfable of \"Cadenus and Vanessa\" been acted over by the most unlikely\r\nperformers.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was a philosopher, a metaphysician, a philanthropist, and in\r\nthe highest and most earnest sense a minister of good on earth. The\r\nNew England clergy had no sentimental affectation of sanctity that\r\nsegregated them from wholesome human relations; and consequently our\r\ngood Doctor had always resolved, in a grave and thoughtful spirit, at a\r\nsuitable time in his worldly affairs, to choose unto himself a helpmeet.\r\nLove, as treated of in romances, he held to be a foolish and profane\r\nmatter, unworthy the attention of a serious and reasonable creature. All\r\nthe language of poetry on this subject was to him an unknown tongue. He\r\ncontemplated the entrance on married life somewhat in this wise:--That\r\nat a time and place suiting, he should look out unto himself a woman of\r\na pleasant countenance and of good repute, a zealous, earnest Christian,\r\nand well skilled in the items of household management, whom accosting as\r\na stranger and pilgrim to a better life, he should loyally and lovingly\r\nentreat, as Isaac did Rebekah, to come under the shadow of his tent and\r\nbe a helpmeet unto him in what yet remained of this mortal journey. But\r\nstraitened circumstances, and the unsettled times of the Revolution, in\r\nwhich he had taken an earnest and zealous part, had delayed to a late\r\nbachelorhood the fulfilment of this resolution.\r\n\r\nWhen once received under the shadow of Mrs. Scudder's roof, and within\r\nthe provident sphere of her unfailing housekeeping, all material\r\nnecessity for an immediate choice was taken away; for he was exactly in\r\nthat situation dearest to every scholarly and thoughtful man, in which\r\nall that pertained to the outward life appeared to rise under his hand\r\nat the moment he wished for it without his knowing how or why.\r\n\r\nHe was not at the head of a prosperous church and society, rich and\r\nwell-to-do in the world,--but, as the pioneer leader of a new theology,\r\nin a country where theology was the all-absorbing interest, he had to\r\nbreast the reaction that ever attends the advent of new ideas. His\r\npulpit talents, too, were unattractive. His early training had been\r\nall logical, not in the least aesthetic; for, like the ministry of his\r\ncountry generally, he had been trained always to think more of what he\r\nshould say than of how he should say it. Consequently, his style,\r\nthough not without a certain massive greatness, which always comes from\r\nlargeness of nature, had none of those attractions by which the common\r\nmasses are beguiled into thinking. He gave only the results of thought,\r\nnot its incipient processes; and the consequence was, that few could\r\nfollow him. In like manner, his religious teachings were characterized\r\nby an ideality so high as quite to discourage ordinary virtue.\r\n\r\nThere is a ladder to heaven, whose base God has placed in human\r\naffections, tender instincts, symbolic feelings, sacraments of love,\r\nthrough which the soul rises higher and higher, refining as she goes,\r\ntill she outgrows the human, and changes, as she rises, into the image\r\nof the divine. At the very top of this ladder, at the threshold of\r\nparadise, blazes dazzling and crystalline that celestial grade where the\r\nsoul knows self no more, having learned, through a long experience of\r\ndevotion, how blest it is to lose herself in that eternal Love and\r\nBeauty of which all earthly fairness and grandeur are but the dim type,\r\nthe distant shadow. This highest step, this saintly elevation, which but\r\nfew selectest spirits ever on earth attain, to raise the soul to which\r\nthe Eternal Father organized every relation of human existence and\r\nstrung every chord of human love, for which this world is one long\r\ndiscipline, for which the soul's human education is constantly varied,\r\nfor which it is now torn by sorrow, now flooded by joy, to which all\r\nits multiplied powers tend with upward hands of dumb and ignorant\r\naspiration,--this Ultima Thule of virtue had been seized upon by our\r\nsage as the _all_ of religion. He knocked out every round of the ladder\r\nbut the highest, and then, pointing to its hopeless splendor, said to\r\nthe world, \"Go up thither and be saved!\"\r\n\r\nShort of that absolute self-abnegation, that unconditional surrender to\r\nthe Infinite, there was nothing meritorious,--because, if _that_ were\r\ncommanded, every moment of refusal was rebellion. Every prayer, not\r\nbased on such consecration, he held to be an insult to the Divine\r\nMajesty;--the reading of the Word, the conscientious conduct of life,\r\nthe performance of the duties of man to man, being, without this, the\r\ndeeds of a creature in conscious rebellion to its Eternal Sovereign,\r\nwere all vitiated and made void. Nothing was to be preached to the\r\nsinner, but his ability and obligation to rise immediately to this\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful that teaching of this sort should seem to many\r\nunendurable, and that the multitude should desert the preacher with the\r\ncry, \"This is an hard saying; who can hear it?\" The young and gay were\r\nwearied by the dryness of metaphysical discussions which to them were as\r\nunintelligible as a statement of the last results of the mathematician\r\nto the child commencing the multiplication-table. There remained around\r\nhim only a select circle,--shrewd, hard thinkers, who delighted\r\nin metaphysical subtilties,--deep-hearted, devoted natures, who\r\nsympathized with the unworldly purity of his life, his active\r\nphilanthropy and untiring benevolence,--courageous men, who admired his\r\nindependence of thought and freedom in breasting received opinion,--and\r\nthose unperceiving, dull, good people who are content to go to church\r\nanywhere as convenience and circumstance may drift them,--people who\r\nserve, among the keen feeling and thinking portion of the world, much\r\nthe same purpose as adipose matter in the human system, as a soft\r\ncushion between the nerves of feeling and the muscles of activity.\r\n\r\nThere was something affecting in the pertinacity with which the good\r\nDoctor persevered in saying his say to his discouraging minority of\r\nhearers. His salary was small; his meeting-house, damaged during the\r\nRevolutionary struggle, was dilapidated and forlorn,--fireless in\r\nwinter, and in summer admitting a flood of sun and dust through those\r\ngreat windows which formed so principal a feature in those first efforts\r\nof Puritan architecture.\r\n\r\nStill, grand in his humility, he preached on,--and as a soldier never\r\nasks why, but stands at apparently the most useless post, so he went on\r\nfrom Sunday to Sunday, comforting himself with the reflection that no\r\none could think more meanly of his ministrations than he did himself. \"I\r\nam like Moses only in not being eloquent,\" he said, in his simplicity.\r\n\"My preaching is barren and dull, my voice is hard and harsh; but then\r\nthe Lord is a Sovereign, and may work through me. He fed Elijah once\r\nthrough a raven, and he may feed some poor wandering soul through me.\"\r\n\r\nThe only mistake made by the good man was that of supposing that the\r\nelaboration of theology was preaching the gospel. The gospel he was\r\npreaching constantly, by his pure, unworldly living, by his visitations\r\nto homes of poverty and sorrow, by his searching out of the lowly\r\nAfrican slaves, his teaching of those whom no one else in those days had\r\nthought of teaching, and by the grand humanity, outrunning his age, in\r\nwhich he protested against the then admitted system of slavery and the\r\nslave-trade. But when, rising in the pulpit, he followed trains of\r\nthought suited only to the desk of the theological lecture-room, he did\r\nit blindly, following that law of self-development by which minds of a\r\ncertain amount of fervor _must_ utter what is in them, whether men will\r\nhear or whether they will forbear.\r\n\r\nBut the place where our Doctor was happiest was his study. There he\r\nexplored, and wandered, and read, and thought, and lived a life as\r\nwholly ideal and intellectual as heart could conceive.\r\n\r\nAnd could _Love_ enter a reverend doctor's study, and find his way into\r\na heart empty and swept of all those shreds of poetry and romance in\r\nwhich he usually finds the material of his incantations?\r\n\r\nEven so;--but he came so thoughtfully, so reverently, with so wise\r\nand cautious a footfall, that the good Doctor never even raised his\r\nspectacles to see who was there. The first that he knew, poor man,\r\nhe was breathing an air of strange and subtile sweetness,--from what\r\nparadise he never stopped his studies to inquire. He was like a great,\r\nrugged elm, with all its lacings and archings of boughs and twigs, which\r\nhas stood cold and frozen against the metallic blue of winter sky,\r\nforgetful of leaves, and patient in its bareness, calmly content in its\r\nnaked strength and crystalline definiteness of outline. But in April\r\nthere is a rising and stirring within the grand old monster,--a\r\nwhispering of knotted buds, a mounting of sap coursing ethereally from\r\nbough to bough with a warm and gentle life; and though the old elm knows\r\nit not, a new creation is at hand. Just so, ever since the good man had\r\nlived at Mrs. Scudder's, and had the gentle Mary for his catechumen, a\r\nricher life seemed to have colored his thoughts,--his mind seemed to\r\nwork with a pleasure as never before.\r\n\r\nWhoever looked on the forehead of the good Doctor must have seen the\r\nsquareness of ideality giving marked effect to its outline. As yet\r\nideality had dealt only with the intellectual and invisible, leading to\r\nsubtile refinements of argument and exalted ideas of morals. But there\r\nwas lying in him, crude and unworked, a whole mine of those artistic\r\nfeelings and perceptions which are awakened and developed only by the\r\ntouch of beauty. Had he been born beneath the shadow of the great Duomo\r\nof Florence, where Giotto's Campanile rises like the slender stalk of\r\na celestial lily, where varied marbles and rainbow-glass and gorgeous\r\npaintings and lofty statuary call forth, even from childhood, the soul's\r\nreminiscences of the bygone glories of its pristine state, his would\r\nhave been a soul as rounded and full in its sphere of faculties as that\r\nof Da Vinci or Michel Angelo. But of all that he was as ignorant as a\r\nchild; and the first revelation of his dormant nature was to come to him\r\nthrough the face of woman,--that work of the Mighty Master which is to\r\nbe found in all lands and ages.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the love of a great mind something fearful in its inception\r\nis that it is often the unsealing of a hitherto undeveloped portion of\r\na large and powerful being; the woman may or may not seem to other eyes\r\nadequate to the effect produced, but the man cannot forget her, because\r\nwith her came a change which makes him forever a different being. So it\r\nwas with our friend. A woman it was that was destined to awaken in him\r\nall that consciousness which music, painting, poetry awaken in more\r\nevenly developed minds; and it is the silent breathing of her creative\r\npresence that is even now creating him anew, while as yet he knows it\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nHe never thought, this good old soul, whether Mary were beautiful or\r\nnot; he never even knew that he looked at her; nor did he know why it\r\nwas that the truths of his theology, when uttered by her tongue, had\r\nsuch a wondrous beauty as he never felt before. He did not know why it\r\nwas, that, when she silently sat by him, copying tangled manuscript for\r\nthe press, as she sometimes did, his whole study seemed so full of some\r\ndivine influence, as if, like St. Dorothea, she had worn in her bosom,\r\ninvisibly, the celestial roses of paradise. He recorded honestly in his\r\ndiary what marvellous freshness of spirit the Lord had given him, and\r\nhow he seemed to be uplifted in his communings with heaven, without once\r\nthinking from the robes of what angel this sweetness had exhaled.\r\n\r\nOn Sundays, when he saw good Mrs. Jones asleep, and Simon Brown's hard,\r\nsharp eyes, and Deacon Twitchel mournfully rocking to and fro, and his\r\nwife handing fennel to keep the children awake, his eye glanced across\r\nto the front gallery, where one earnest young face, ever kindling with\r\nfeeling and bright with intellect, followed on his way, and he felt\r\nuplifted and comforted. On Sunday mornings, when Mary came out of her\r\nlittle room, in clean white dress, with her singing-book and psalm-book\r\nin her hands, her deep eyes solemn from recent prayer, he thought of\r\nthat fair and mystical bride, the Lamb's wife, whose union with her\r\nDivine Redeemer in a future millennial age was a frequent and favorite\r\nsubject of his musings; yet he knew not that this celestial bride,\r\nclothed in fine linen, clean and white, veiled in humility and meekness,\r\nbore in his mind those earthly features. No, he never had dreamed of\r\nthat! But only after she had passed by, that mystical vision seemed to\r\nhim more radiant, more easy to be conceived.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that, if a grape-vine be planted in the neighborhood of a\r\nwell, its roots, running silently underground, wreathe themselves in\r\na net-work around the cold, clear waters, and the vine's putting on\r\noutward greenness and unwonted clusters and fruit is all that tells\r\nwhere every root and fibre of its being has been silently stealing. So\r\nthose loves are most fatal, most absorbing, in which, with unheeded\r\nquietness, every thought and fibre of our life twines gradually around\r\nsome human soul, to us the unsuspected wellspring of our being. Fearful\r\nit is, because so often the vine must be uprooted, and all its fibres\r\nwrenched away; but till the hour of discovery comes, how is it\r\ntransfigured by a new and beautiful life!\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in life more beautiful than that trancelike quiet dawn\r\nwhich precedes the rising of love in the soul. When the whole being\r\nis pervaded imperceptibly and tranquilly by another being, and we are\r\nhappy, we know not and ask not why, the soul is then receiving all and\r\nasking nothing. At a later day she becomes self-conscious, and then come\r\ncraving exactions, endless questions,--the whole world of the material\r\ncomes in with its hard counsels and consultations, and the beautiful\r\ntrance fades forever.\r\n\r\nOf course, all this is not so to you, my good friends, who read it\r\nwithout the most distant idea what it can mean; but there are people in\r\nthe world to whom it has meant and will mean much, and who will see in\r\nthe present happiness of our respectable friend something even ominous\r\nand sorrowful.\r\n\r\nIt had not escaped the keen eye of the mother how quickly and innocently\r\nthe good Doctor was absorbed by her daughter, and thereupon had come\r\nlong trains of practical reflections.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, though not popular indeed as a preacher, was a noted man in\r\nhis age. Her deceased husband had regarded him with something of the\r\nsame veneration which might have been accorded to a divine messenger,\r\nand Mrs. Scudder had received and kept this veneration as a precious\r\nlegacy. Then, although not handsome, the Doctor had decidedly a grand\r\nand imposing appearance. There was nothing common or insignificant about\r\nhim. Indeed, it had been said, that, when, just after the declaration of\r\npeace, he walked through the town in the commemorative procession side\r\nby side with General Washington, the minister, in the majesty of his\r\ngown, bands, cocked hat, and full flowing wig, was thought by many to be\r\nthe more majestic and personable figure of the two.\r\n\r\nIn those days, the minister united in himself all those ideas of\r\nsuperior position and cultivation with which the theocratic system of\r\nthe New England community had invested him. Mrs. Scudder's notions of\r\nsocial rank could reach no higher than to place her daughter on the\r\nthrone of such preëminence.\r\n\r\nHer Mary, she pondered, was no common girl. In those days, it was a rare\r\nthing for young persons to devote themselves to religion or make any\r\nprofessions of devout life. The church, or that body of people who\r\nprofessed to have passed through a divine regeneration, was almost\r\nentirely confined to middle-aged and elderly people, and it was looked\r\nupon as a singular and unwonted call of divine grace when young persons\r\ncame forward to attach themselves to it. When Mary, therefore, at quite\r\nan early age, in all the bloom of her youthful beauty, arose, according\r\nto the simple and impressive New England rite, to consecrate herself\r\npublicly to a religious life, and to join the company of professing\r\nChristians, she was regarded with a species of deference amounting even\r\nto awe. Had it not been for the childlike, unconscious simplicity of her\r\nmanners, the young people of her age would have shrunk away from her,\r\nas from one entirely out of their line of thought and feeling; but a\r\ncertain natural and innocent playfulness and amiable self-forgetfulness\r\nmade her a general favorite.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Mrs. Scudder knew no young man whom she deemed worthy to\r\nhave and hold a heart which she priced so highly. As to James, he stood\r\nat double disadvantage, because, as her cousin's son, he had grown up\r\nfrom childhood under her eye, and all those sins and iniquities into\r\nwhich gay and adventurous youngsters will be falling had come to her\r\nknowledge. She felt kindly to the youth; she wished him well; but as to\r\ngiving him her Mary!--the very suggestion made her dislike him. She was\r\nquite sure he must have tried to beguile her,--he must have tampered\r\nwith her feelings, to arouse in her pure and well-ordered mind so much\r\nemotion and devotedness as she had witnessed.\r\n\r\nHow encouraging a Providence, then, was it that he was gone to sea for\r\nthree years!--how fortunate that Mary had been prevented in any way from\r\ncommitting herself with him!--how encouraging that the only man in those\r\nparts, in the least fitted to appreciate her, seemed so greatly pleased\r\nand absorbed in her society!--how easily might Mary's dutiful reverence\r\nbe changed to a warmer sentiment, when she should find that so great a\r\nman could descend from his lofty thoughts to think of her!\r\n\r\nIn fact, before Mrs. Scudder had gone to sleep the first night after\r\nJames's departure, she had settled upon the house where the minister\r\nand his young wife were to live, had reviewed the window-curtains and\r\nbed-quilts for each room, and glanced complacently at an improved\r\nreceipt for wedding-cake which might be brought out to glorify a certain\r\noccasion!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FRIENDS AND RELATIONS OF JAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Zebedee Marvyn, the father of James, was the sample of an\r\nindividuality so purely the result of New England society and education,\r\nthat he must be embodied in our story as a representative man of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nHe owned a large farm in the immediate vicinity of Newport, which he\r\nworked with his own hands and kept under the most careful cultivation.\r\nHe was a man past the middle of life, with a white head, a keen blue\r\neye, and a face graven deeply with the lines of energy and thought. His\r\nwas one of those clearly-cut minds which New England forms among her\r\nfarmers, as she forms quartz crystals in her mountains, by a sort of\r\ngradual influence flowing through every pore of her soil and system.\r\n\r\nHis education, properly so called, had been merely that of those common\r\nschools and academies with which the States are thickly sown, and which\r\nare the springs of so much intellectual activity. Here he had learned\r\nto think and to inquire,--a process which had not ceased with his\r\nschool-days. Though toiling daily with his sons and hired man in all the\r\nminutiae of a farmer's life, he kept an observant eye on the field of\r\nliterature, and there was not a new publication heard of that he did\r\nnot immediately find means to add it to his yearly increasing stock of\r\nbooks. In particular was he a well-read and careful theologian, and all\r\nthe controversial tracts, sermons, and books, with which then, as ever\r\nsince, New England has abounded, not only lay on his shelves, but had\r\nhis pencilled annotations, queries, and comments thickly scattered along\r\ntheir margins. There was scarce an office of public trust which had not\r\nat one time or another been filled by him. He was deacon of the church,\r\nchairman of the school-committee, justice of the peace, had been twice\r\nrepresentative in the State legislature, and was in permanence a sort of\r\nadviser-general in all cases between neighbor and neighbor. Among other\r\nacquisitions, he had gained some knowledge of the general forms of law,\r\nand his advice was often asked in preference to that of the regular\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\nHis dwelling was one of those large, square, white, green-blinded\r\nmansions, cool, clean, and roomy, wherein the respectability of New\r\nEngland in those days rejoiced. The windows were shaded by clumps of\r\nlilacs; the deep yard with its white fence inclosed a sweep of clean,\r\nshort grass, and a few fruit-trees. Opposite the house was a small\r\nblacksmith's-shed, which, of a wet day, was sparkling and lively with\r\nbellows and ringing forge, while Mr. Zebedee and his sons were hammering\r\nand pounding and putting in order anything that was out of the way in\r\nfarming-tools or establishments. Not unfrequently the latest scientific\r\nwork or the last tractate of theology lay open by his side, the contents\r\nof which would be discussed with a neighbor or two as they entered; for,\r\nto say the truth, many a neighbor, less forehanded and thrifty, felt the\r\nbenefit of this arrangement of Mr. Zebedee, and would drop in to see if\r\nhe \"wouldn't just tighten that rivet,\" or \"kind o' ease out that 'ere\r\nbrace,\" or \"let a feller have a turn with his bellows, or a stroke or\r\ntwo on his anvil,\"--to all which the good man consented with a grave\r\nobligingness. The fact was, that, as nothing in the establishment of\r\nMr. Marvyn was often broken or lost or out of place, he had frequent\r\napplications to lend to those less fortunate persons, always to be\r\nfound, who supply their own lack of considerateness from the abundance\r\nof their neighbors.\r\n\r\nHe who is known always to be in hand, and always obliging, in a\r\nneighborhood, stands the chance sometimes of having nothing for himself.\r\nMr. Zebedee reflected quietly on this subject, taking it, as he did all\r\nothers, into grave and orderly consideration, and finally provided a\r\ncomplete set of tools, which he kept for the purpose of lending; and\r\nwhen any of these were lent, he told the next applicant quietly, that\r\nthe axe or the hoe was already out, and thus he reconciled the Scripture\r\nwhich commanded him to \"do good and lend\" with that law of order which\r\nwas written in his nature.\r\n\r\nEarly in life Mr. Marvyn had married one of the handsomest girls of\r\nhis acquaintance, who had brought him a thriving and healthy family of\r\nchildren, of whom James was the youngest. Mrs. Marvyn was, at this\r\ntime, a tall, sad-eyed, gentle-mannered woman, thoughtful, earnest,\r\ndeep-natured, though sparing in the matter of words. In all her\r\nhousehold arrangements, she had the same thrift and order which\r\ncharacterized her husband; but hers was a mind of a finer and higher\r\nstamp than his.\r\n\r\nIn her bed-room, near by her work-basket, stood a table covered with\r\nbooks,--and so systematic were her household arrangements, that she\r\nnever any day missed her regular hours for reading. One who should have\r\nlooked over this table would have seen there how eager and hungry a mind\r\nwas hid behind the silent eyes of this quiet woman. History, biography,\r\nmathematics, volumes of the encyclopaedia, poetry, novels, all alike\r\nfound their time and place there,--and while she pursued her household\r\nlabors, the busy, active soul within travelled cycles and cycles of\r\nthought, few of which ever found expression in words. What might be that\r\nmarvellous music of the _Miserere_, of which she read, that it convulsed\r\ncrowds and drew groans and tears from the most obdurate? What might be\r\nthose wondrous pictures of Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci? What would it\r\nbe to see the Apollo, the Venus? What was the charm that enchanted the\r\nold marbles,--charm untold and inconceivable to one who had never seen\r\neven the slightest approach to a work of art? Then those glaciers of\r\nSwitzerland, that grand, unapproachable mixture of beauty and sublimity\r\nin her mountains!--what would it be to one who could see it? Then what\r\nwere all those harmonies of which she read,--masses, fugues, symphonies?\r\nOh, could she once hear the Miserere of Mozart, just to know what music\r\nwas like! And the cathedrals, what were they? How wonderful they must\r\nbe, with their forests of arches, many-colored as autumn-woods with\r\npainted glass, and the chants and anthems rolling down their long\r\naisles! On all these things she pondered quietly, as she sat often on\r\nSundays in the old staring, rattle-windowed meeting-house, and looked at\r\nthe uncouth old pulpit, and heard the choir faw-sol-la-ing or singing\r\nfuguing tunes; but of all this she said nothing.\r\n\r\nSometimes, for days, her thoughts would turn from these subjects and be\r\nabsorbed in mathematical or metaphysical studies. \"I have been following\r\nthat treatise on Optics for a week, and never understood it till\r\nto-day,\" she once said to her husband. \"I have found now that there has\r\nbeen a mistake in drawing the diagrams. I have corrected it, and now the\r\ndemonstration is complete.--Dinah, take care, that wood is hickory, and\r\nit takes only seven sticks of that size to heat the oven.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that a woman of this sort was an inattentive\r\nlistener to preaching so stimulating to the intellect as that of Dr. H.\r\nNo pair of eyes followed the web of his reasonings with a keener and\r\nmore anxious watchfulness than those sad, deep-set, hazel ones; and as\r\nshe was drawn along the train of its inevitable logic, a close observer\r\nmight have seen how the shadows deepened over them. For, while others\r\nlistened for the clearness of the thought, for the acuteness of the\r\nargument, she listened as a soul wide, fine-strung, acute, repressed,\r\nwhose every fibre is a nerve, listens to the problem of its own\r\ndestiny,--listened as the mother of a family listens, to know what were\r\nthe possibilities, the probabilities, of this mysterious existence of\r\nours to herself and those dearer to her than herself.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of all her listening was a history of deep inward\r\nsadness. That exultant joy, or that entire submission, with which others\r\nseemed to view the scheme of the universe, as thus unfolded, did not\r\nvisit her mind. Everything to her seemed shrouded in gloom and mystery;\r\nand that darkness she received as a token of unregeneracy, as a sign\r\nthat she was one of those who are destined, by a mysterious decree,\r\nnever to receive the light of the glorious gospel of Christ. Hence,\r\nwhile her husband was a deacon of the church, she, for years, had sat\r\nin her pew while the sacramental elements were distributed, a mournful\r\nspectator. Punctilious in every duty, exact, reverential, she still\r\nregarded herself as a child of wrath, an enemy to God, and an heir\r\nof perdition; nor could she see any hope of remedy, except in the\r\nsovereign, mysterious decree of an Infinite and Unknown Power, a mercy\r\nfor which she waited with the sickness of hope deferred.\r\n\r\nHer children had grown up successively around her, intelligent and\r\nexemplary. Her eldest son was mathematical professor in one of the\r\nleading colleges of New England. Her second son, who jointly with his\r\nfather superintended the farm, was a man of wide literary culture and of\r\nfine mathematical genius; and not unfrequently, on winter evenings, the\r\nson, father, and mother worked together, by their kitchen fireside, over\r\nthe calculations for the almanac for the ensuing year, which the son had\r\nbeen appointed to edit.\r\n\r\nEverything in the family arrangements was marked by a sober precision, a\r\ngrave and quiet self-possession. There was little demonstrativeness of\r\naffection between parents and children, brothers and sisters, though\r\ngreat mutual affection and confidence. It was not pride, nor sternness,\r\nbut a sort of habitual shamefacedness, that kept far back in each soul\r\nthose feelings which are the most beautiful in their outcome; but\r\nafter a while, the habit became so fixed a nature, that a caressing or\r\naffectionate expression could not have passed the lips of one to another\r\nwithout a painful awkwardness. Love was understood, once for all, to be\r\nthe basis on which their life was built. Once for all, they loved each\r\nother, and after that, the less said, the better. It had cost the\r\nwoman's heart of Mrs. Marvyn some pangs, in the earlier part of her\r\nwedlock, to accept of this _once for all_, in place of those\r\ndaily outgushings which every woman desires should be like God's\r\nloving-kindness, \"new every morning\"; but hers, too, was a nature\r\nstrongly inclining inward, and, after a few tremulous movements, the\r\nneedle of her soul settled, and her life-lot was accepted,--not as what\r\nshe would like or could conceive, but as a reasonable and good one. Life\r\nwas a picture painted in low, cool tones, but in perfect keeping; and\r\nthough another and brighter style might have pleased better, she did not\r\nquarrel with this.\r\n\r\nInto this steady, decorous, highly-respectable circle the youngest\r\nchild, James, made a formidable irruption. One sometimes sees launched\r\ninto a family-circle a child of so different a nature from all the rest,\r\nthat it might seem as if, like an aërolite, he had fallen out of another\r\nsphere. All the other babies of the Marvyn family had been of that\r\norderly, contented sort who sleep till it is convenient to take them up,\r\nand while awake suck their thumbs contentedly and look up with large,\r\nround eyes at the ceiling when it is not convenient for their elders\r\nand betters that they should do anything else. In farther advanced\r\nchildhood, they had been quiet and decorous children, who could be all\r\ndressed and set up in chairs, like so many dolls, of a Sunday morning,\r\npatiently awaiting the stroke of the church-bell to be carried out and\r\nput into the wagon which took them over the two-miles' road to church.\r\nPossessed of such tranquil, orderly, and exemplary young offshoots, Mrs.\r\nMarvyn had been considered eminent for her \"faculty\" in bringing up\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nBut James was destined to put \"faculty,\" and every other talent which\r\nhis mother possessed, to rout. He was an infant of moods and tenses, and\r\nthose not of any regular verb. He would cry of nights, and he would be\r\ntaken up of mornings, and he would not suck his thumb, nor a bundle of\r\ncaraway-seed tied in a rag and dipped in sweet milk, with which the good\r\ngossips in vain endeavored to pacify him. He fought manfully with his\r\ntwo great fat fists the battle of babyhood, utterly reversed all nursery\r\nmaxims, and reigned as baby over the whole prostrate household. When old\r\nenough to run alone, his splendid black eyes and glossy rings of hair\r\nwere seen flashing and bobbing in every forbidden place and occupation.\r\nNow trailing on his mother's gown, he assisted her in salting her butter\r\nby throwing in small contributions of snuff or sugar, as the case might\r\nbe; and again, after one of those mysterious periods of silence which\r\nare of most ominous significance in nursery experience, he would rise\r\nfrom the demolition of her indigo-bag, showing a face ghastly with blue\r\nstreaks, and looking more like a gnome than the son of a respectable\r\nmother. There was not a pitcher of any description of contents left\r\nwithin reach of his little tiptoes and busy fingers that was not pulled\r\nover upon his giddy head without in the least seeming to improve its\r\nsteadiness. In short, his mother remarked that she was thankful every\r\nnight when she had fairly gotten him into bed and asleep; James had\r\nreally got through one more day and killed neither himself nor any\r\none else. As a boy, the case was little better. He did not take to\r\nstudy,--yawned over books, and cut out moulds for running anchors when\r\nhe should have been thinking of his columns of words in four syllables.\r\nNo mortal knew how he learned to read, for he never seemed to stop\r\nrunning long enough to learn anything; and yet he did learn, and used\r\nthe talent in conning over travels, sea-voyages, and lives of heroes and\r\nnaval commanders. Spite of father, mother, and brother, he seemed\r\nto possess the most extraordinary faculty of running up unsavory\r\nacquaintances. He was hail-fellow well-met with every Tom and Jack and\r\nJim and Ben and Dick that strolled on the wharves, and astonished his\r\nfather with minutest particulars of every ship, schooner, and brig in\r\nthe harbor, together with biographical notes of the different Toms,\r\nDicks, and Harrys by whom they were worked.\r\n\r\nThere was but one member of the family that seemed to know at all what\r\nto make of James, and that was their negro servant, Candace.\r\n\r\nIn those days, when domestic slavery prevailed in New England, it was\r\nquite a different thing in its aspects from the same institution in\r\nmore southern latitudes. The hard soil, unyielding to any but the most\r\nconsiderate culture, the thrifty, close, shrewd habits of the people,\r\nand their untiring activity and industry, prevented, among the mass of\r\nthe people, any great reliance on slave labor. It was something foreign,\r\ngrotesque, and picturesque in a life of the most matter-of-fact\r\nsameness; it was even as if one should see clusters of palm-trees\r\nscattered here and there among Yankee wooden meeting-houses, or open\r\none's eyes on clumps of yellow-striped aloes growing among hardhack and\r\nhuckleberry bushes in the pastures.\r\n\r\nAdded to this, there were from the very first, in New England, serious\r\ndoubts in the minds of thoughtful and conscientious people in reference\r\nto the lawfulness of slavery; and this scruple prevented many from\r\navailing themselves of it, and proved a restraint on all, so that\r\nnothing like plantation-life existed, and what servants were owned were\r\nscattered among different families, of which they came to be regarded\r\nand to regard themselves as a legitimate part and portion,--Mr. Marvyn,\r\nas a man of substance, numbering two or three in his establishment,\r\namong whom Candace reigned chief. The presence of these tropical\r\nspecimens of humanity, with their wide, joyous, rich physical abundance\r\nof nature and their hearty _abandon_ of outward expression, was a relief\r\nto the still clear-cut lines in which the picture of New England life\r\nwas drawn, which an artist must appreciate.\r\n\r\nNo race has ever shown such infinite and rich capabilities of adaptation\r\nto varying soil and circumstances as the negro. Alike to them the snows\r\nof Canada, the hard, rocky land of New England, with its set lines and\r\norderly ways, or the gorgeous profusion and loose abundance of the\r\nSouthern States. Sambo and Cuffy expand under them all. New England yet\r\npreserves among her hills and valleys the lingering echoes of the jokes\r\nand jollities of various sable worthies, who saw alike in orthodoxy\r\nand heterodoxy, in Dr. This-side and Dr. That-side, only food for\r\nmore abundant merriment;--in fact, the minister of those days not\r\nunfrequently had his black shadow, a sort of African Boswell, who\r\npowdered his wig, brushed his boots, defended and patronized his\r\nsermons, and strutted complacently about as if through virtue of his\r\nblackness he had absorbed every ray of his master's dignity and wisdom.\r\nIn families, the presence of these exotics was a godsend to the\r\nchildren, supplying from the abundant outwardness and demonstrativeness\r\nof their nature that aliment of sympathy so dear to childhood, which the\r\nrepressed and quiet habits of New England education denied. Many and\r\nmany a New Englander counts among his pleasantest early recollections\r\nthe memory of some of these genial creatures, who by their warmth of\r\nnature were the first and most potent mesmerisers of his childish mind.\r\n\r\nCandace was a powerfully built, majestic black woman, corpulent, heavy,\r\nwith a swinging majesty of motion like that of a ship in a ground-swell.\r\nHer shining black skin and glistening white teeth were indications of\r\nperfect physical vigor which had never known a day's sickness; her\r\nturban, of broad red and yellow bandanna stripes, had even a warm\r\ntropical glow; and her ample skirts were always ready to be spread over\r\nevery childish transgression of her youngest pet and favorite, James.\r\n\r\nShe used to hold him entranced long winter-evenings, while she sat\r\nknitting in the chimney-corner, and crooned to him strange, wild African\r\nlegends of the things that she had seen in her childhood and early\r\ndays,--for she had been stolen when about fifteen years of age;\r\nand these weird, dreamy talks increased the fervor of his roving\r\nimagination, and his desire to explore the wonders of the wide and\r\nunknown world. When rebuked or chastised, it was she who had secret\r\nbowels of mercy for him, and hid doughnuts in her ample bosom to be\r\nsecretly administered to him in mitigation of the sentence that sent him\r\nsupperless to bed; and many a triangle of pie, many a wedge of cake, had\r\nconveyed to him surreptitious consolations which his more conscientious\r\nmother longed, but dared not, to impart. In fact, these ministrations,\r\nif suspected, were winked at by Mrs. Marvyn, for two reasons: first,\r\nthat mothers are generally glad of any loving-kindness to an erring boy,\r\nwhich they are not responsible for; and second, that Candace was so set\r\nin her ways and opinions that one might as well come in front of a ship\r\nunder full sail as endeavor to stop her in a matter where her heart was\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, she had her own private and special quarrels with \"Massa\r\nJames\" when he disputed any of her sovereign orders in the kitchen, and\r\nwould sometimes pursue him with uplifted rolling-pin and floury hands\r\nwhen he had snatched a gingernut or cooky without suitable deference or\r\nsupplication, and would declare, roundly, that there \"never was sich an\r\naggravatin' young un.\" But if, on the strength of this, any one\r\nelse ventured a reproof, Candace was immediately round on the other\r\nside:--\"Dat ar' chile gwin' to be spiled, 'cause dey's allers a-pickin'\r\non him;--he's well enough, on'y let him alone.\"\r\n\r\nWell, under this miscellaneous assortment of influences,--through\r\nthe order and gravity and solemn monotone of life at home, with the\r\nunceasing tick-tack of the clock forever resounding through clean,\r\nempty-seeming rooms,--through the sea, ever shining, ever smiling,\r\ndimpling, soliciting, like a magical charger who comes saddled and\r\nbridled and offers to take you to fairyland,--through acquaintance with\r\nall sorts of foreign, outlandish ragamuffins among the ships in the\r\nharbor,--from disgust of slow-moving oxen, and long-drawn, endless\r\nfurrows round the fifteen-acre lot,--from misunderstandings with grave\r\nelder brothers, and feeling somehow as if, he knew not why, he grieved\r\nhis mother all the time just by being what he was and couldn't help\r\nbeing,--and, finally, by a bitter break with his father, in which came\r\nthat last wrench for an individual existence which some time or other\r\nthe young growing mind will give to old authority,--by all these united,\r\nwas the lot at length cast; for one evening James was missing at\r\nsupper, missing by the fireside, gone all night, not at home to\r\nbreakfast,--till, finally, a strange, weird, most heathenish-looking\r\ncabin-boy, who had often been forbidden the premises by Mr. Marvyn,\r\nbrought in a letter, half-defiant, half-penitent, which announced that\r\nJames had sailed in the \"Ariel\" the evening before.\r\n\r\nMr. Zebedee Marvyn set his face as a flint, and said, \"He went out from\r\nus because he was not of us,\"--whereat old Candace lifted her great\r\nfloury fist from the kneading-trough, and, shaking it like a large\r\nsnowball, said, \"Oh, you go 'long, Massa Marvyn; ye'll live to count dat\r\nar' boy for de staff o' your old age yet, now I tell ye; got de makin'\r\no' ten or'nary men in him; kittles dat's full allers will bile over;\r\ngood yeast will blow out de cork,--lucky ef it don't bust de bottle.\r\nTell ye, der's angels has der hooks in sich, and when de Lord wants him\r\ndey'll haul him in safe and sound.\" And Candace concluded her speech by\r\ngiving a lift to her whole batch of dough and flinging it down in the\r\ntrough with an emphasis that made the pewter on the dresser rattle.\r\n\r\nThis apparently irreverent way of expressing her mind, so contrary to\r\nthe deferential habits studiously inculcated in family discipline, had\r\ngrown to be so much a matter of course to all the family that nobody\r\never thought of rebuking it. There was a sort of savage freedom about\r\nher which they excused in right of her having been born and bred a\r\nheathen, and of course not to be expected to come at once under the yoke\r\nof civilization. In fact, you must all have noticed, my dear readers,\r\nthat there are some sorts of people for whom everybody turns out as they\r\nwould for a railroad-car, without stopping to ask why, and Candace was\r\none of them.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Mr. Marvyn was not displeased with this defence of James,\r\nas might be inferred from his mentioning it four or five times in the\r\ncourse of the morning, to say how foolish it was,--wondering why it was\r\nthat Candace and everybody else got so infatuated with that boy,--and\r\nending, at last, after a long period of thought, with the remark, that\r\nthese poor African creatures often seemed to have a great deal of\r\nshrewdness in them, and that he was often astonished at the penetration\r\nthat Candace showed.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year James came home, more quiet and manly than he had\r\never been known before,--so handsome with his sunburnt face, and his\r\nkeen, dark eyes, and glossy curls, that half the girls in the front\r\ngallery lost their hearts the first Sunday he appeared in church. He was\r\ntender as a woman to his mother, and followed her with his eyes, like a\r\nlover, wherever she went; he made due and manly acknowledgments to his\r\nfather, but declared his fixed and settled intention to abide by the\r\nprofession he had chosen; and he brought home all sorts of strange\r\nforeign gifts for every member of the household. Candace was glorified\r\nwith a flaming red and yellow turban of Moorish stuff, from Mogadore,\r\ntogether with a pair of gorgeous yellow morocco slippers with peaked\r\ntoes, which, though there appeared no call to wear them in her common\r\ncourse of life, she would put on her fat feet and contemplate with\r\ndaily satisfaction. She became increasingly strengthened thereby in the\r\nconviction that the angels who had their hooks in Massa James's jacket\r\nwere already beginning to shorten the line.\r\n\r\n[To be continued.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PALM AND THE PINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Peter led the First Crusade,\r\n  A Norseman wooed an Arab maid.\r\n\r\n  He loved her lithe and palmy grace,\r\n  And the dark beauty of her face:\r\n\r\n  She loved his cheeks, so ruddy fair,\r\n  His sunny eyes and yellow hair.\r\n\r\n  He called: she left her father's tent;\r\n  She followed whereso'er he went.\r\n\r\n  She left the palms of Palestine\r\n  To sit beneath the Norland pine.\r\n\r\n  She sang the musky Orient strains\r\n  Where Winter swept the snowy plains.\r\n\r\n  Their natures met like night and morn\r\n  What time the morning-star is born.\r\n\r\n  The child that from their meeting grew\r\n  Hung, like that star, between the two.\r\n\r\n  The glossy night his mother shed\r\n  From her long hair was on his head:\r\n\r\n  But in its shade they saw arise\r\n  The morning of his father's eyes.\r\n\r\n  Beneath the Orient's tawny stain\r\n  Wandered the Norseman's crimson vein:\r\n\r\n  Beneath the Northern force was seen\r\n  The Arab sense, alert and keen.\r\n\r\n  His were the Viking's sinewy hands,\r\n  The arching foot of Eastern lands.\r\n\r\n  And in his soul conflicting strove\r\n  Northern indifference, Southern love;\r\n\r\n  The chastity of temperate blood,\r\n  Impetuous passion's fiery flood;\r\n\r\n  The settled faith that nothing shakes,\r\n  The jealousy a breath awakes;\r\n\r\n  The planning Reason's sober gaze,\r\n  And Fancy's meteoric blaze.\r\n\r\n  And stronger, as he grew to man,\r\n  The contradicting natures ran,--\r\n\r\n  As mingled streams from Etna flow,\r\n  One born of fire, and one of snow.\r\n\r\n  And one impelled, and one withheld,\r\n  And one obeyed, and one rebelled.\r\n\r\n  One gave him force, the other fire;\r\n  This self-control, and that desire.\r\n\r\n  One filled his heart with fierce unrest;\r\n  With peace serene the other blessed.\r\n\r\n  He knew the depth and knew the height,\r\n  The bounds of darkness and of light;\r\n\r\n  And who these far extremes has seen\r\n  Must needs know all that lies between.\r\n\r\n  So, with untaught, instinctive art,\r\n  He read the myriad-natured heart.\r\n\r\n  He met the men of many a land;\r\n  They gave their souls into his hand;\r\n\r\n  And none of them was long unknown:\r\n  The hardest lesson was his own.\r\n\r\n  But how he lived, and where, and when,\r\n  It matters not to other men;\r\n\r\n  For, as a fountain disappears,\r\n  To gush again in later years,\r\n\r\n  So natures lost again may rise\r\n  After the lapse of centuries,--\r\n\r\n  May track the hidden course of blood\r\n  Through many a generation's flood,\r\n\r\n  Till, on some unsuspected field,\r\n  The latent lineage is revealed.\r\n\r\n  The hearts that met in Palestine,\r\n  And mingled 'neath the Norland pine.\r\n  Still beat with double pulse in mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSOR AT THE BREAKFAST-TABLE.\r\n\r\nWHAT HE SAID, WHAT HE HEARD, AND WHAT HE SAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack again!--A turtle--which means a tortoise--is fond of his shell; but\r\nif you put a live coal on his back, he crawls out of it. So the boys\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nIt is a libel on the turtle. He grows to his shell, and his shell is in\r\nhis body as much as his body is in his shell.--I don't think there\r\nis one of our boarders quite so testudinous as I am. Nothing but a\r\ncombination of motives, more peremptory than the coal on the turtle's\r\nback, could have got me to leave the shelter of my carapace; and after\r\nmemorable interviews, and kindest hospitalities, and grand sights, and\r\nhuge influx of patriotic pride,--for every American owns all America,--\r\n\r\n  \"Creation's heir,--the world, the world is\"\r\n\r\nhis, if anybody's,--I come back with the feeling which a boned turkey\r\nmight experience, if, retaining his consciousness, he were allowed to\r\nresume his skeleton.\r\n\r\nWelcome, O Fighting Gladiator, and Recumbent Cleopatra, and Dying\r\nWarrior, whose classic outlines (reproduced in the calcined mineral of\r\nLutetia) crown my loaded shelves! Welcome, ye triumphs of pictorial art\r\n(repeated by the magic graver) that look down upon me from the walls of\r\nmy sacred cell! Vesalius, as Titian drew him, high-fronted, still-eyed,\r\nthick-bearded, with signet-ring, as beseems a gentleman, with book and\r\ncarelessly-held eyeglass, marking him a scholar; thou, too, Jan Kuyper,\r\ncommonly called Jan Praktiseer, old man of a century and seven years\r\nbesides, father of twenty sons and two daughters cut in copper by\r\nHoubraken, bought from a portfolio on one of the Paris _quais_; and ye\r\nThree Trees of Rembrandt, black in shadow against the blaze of sunlight;\r\nand thou Rosy Cottager of Sir Joshua,--thy roses hinted by the peppery\r\nburin of Bartolozzi; ye, too, of lower grades in nature, yet not\r\nunlovely nor unrenowned, Young Bull of Paulus Potter, and Sleeping Cat\r\nof Cornelius Visscher; welcome once more to my eyes! The old books\r\nlook out from the shelves, and I seem to read on their backs something\r\nbesides their titles,--a kind of solemn greeting. The crimson carpet\r\nflushes warm under my feet. The arm-chair hugs me; the swivel-chair\r\nspins round with me, as if it were giddy with pleasure; the vast\r\nrecumbent _fauteuil_ stretches itself out under my weight, as one joyous\r\nwith food and wine stretches in after-dinner laughter.\r\n\r\nThe boarders were pleased to say that they were glad to get me back. One\r\nof them ventured a compliment, namely,--that I talked as if I believed\r\nwhat I said.--This was apparently considered something unusual, by its\r\nbeing mentioned.\r\n\r\nOne who means to talk with entire sincerity,--I said,--always feels\r\nhimself in danger of two things, namely,--an affectation of bluntness,\r\nlike that of which Cornwall accuses Kent in \"Lear,\" and actual rudeness.\r\nWhat a man wants to do, in talking with a stranger, is to get and to\r\ngive as much of the best and most real life that belongs to the two\r\ntalkers as the time will let him. Life is short, and conversation apt to\r\nrun to mere words. Mr. Hue I think it is, who tells us some very good\r\nstories about the way in which two Chinese gentlemen contrive to keep up\r\na long talk without saying a word which has any meaning in it. Something\r\nlike this is occasionally heard on this side of the Great Wall. The best\r\nChinese talkers I know are some pretty women whom I meet from time to\r\ntime. Pleasant, airy, complimentary, the little flakes of flattery\r\nglimmering in their talk like the bits of gold-leaf in _eau-de-vie de\r\nDantzic_; their accents flowing on in a soft ripple,--never a wave,\r\nand never a calm; words nicely fitted, but never a colored phrase or a\r\nhigh-flavored epithet; they turn air into syllables so gracefully, that\r\nwe find meaning for the music they make as we find faces in the coals\r\nand fairy palaces in the clouds. There is something very odd, though,\r\nabout this mechanical talk.\r\n\r\nYou have sometimes been in a train on the railroad when the engine was\r\ndetached a long way from the station you were approaching? Well, you\r\nhave noticed how quietly and rapidly the cars kept on, just as if the\r\nlocomotive were drawing them? Indeed, you would not have suspected that\r\nyou were travelling on the strength of a dead fact, if you had not seen\r\nthe engine running away from you on a side-track. Upon my conscience,\r\nI believe some of these pretty women detach their minds entirely,\r\nsometimes, from their talk,--and, what is more, that we never know the\r\ndifference. Their lips let off the fluty syllables just as their fingers\r\nwould sprinkle the music-drops from their pianos; unconscious habit\r\nturns the phrase of thought into words just as it does that of music\r\ninto notes.--Well, they govern the world, for all that,--these\r\nsweet-lipped women,--because beauty is the index of a larger fact than\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n----The Bombazine wanted an explanation.\r\n\r\nMadam,--said I,--wisdom is the abstract of the past, but beauty is the\r\npromise of the future.\r\n\r\n----All this, however, is not what I was going to say. Here am I,\r\nsuppose, sealed--we will say at a dinner-table--alongside of an\r\nintelligent Englishman. We look in each other's faces,--we exchange a\r\ndozen words. One thing is settled: we mean not to offend each other,--to\r\nbe perfectly courteous,--more than courteous; for we are the entertainer\r\nand the entertained, and cherish particularly amiable feelings to each\r\nother. The claret is good; and if our blood reddens a little with its\r\nwarm crimson, we are none the less kind for it.\r\n\r\n----I don't think people that talk over their victuals are like to say\r\nanything very great, especially if they get their heads muddled with\r\nstrong drink before they begin jabberin'.\r\n\r\nThe Bombazine uttered this with a sugary sourness, as if the words had\r\nbeen steeped in a solution of acetate of lead.--The boys of my time used\r\nto call a hit like this a \"side-winder.\"\r\n\r\n----I must finish this woman.--\r\n\r\nMadam,--I said,--the Great Teacher seems to have been fond of talking as\r\nhe sat at meat. Because this was a good while ago, in a far-off place,\r\nyou forget what the true fact of it was,--that those were real dinners,\r\nwhere people were hungry and thirsty, and where you met a very\r\nmiscellaneous company. Probably there was a great deal of loose talk\r\namong the guests; at any rate, there was always wine, we may believe.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the hygienic advantages or disadvantages of wine,--and\r\nI for one, except for certain particular ends, believe in water, and, I\r\nblush to say it, in black tea,--there is no doubt about its being the\r\ngrand specific against dull dinners. A score of people come together in\r\nall moods of mind and body. The problem is, in the space of one hour,\r\nmore or less, to bring them all into the same condition of slightly\r\nexalted life. Food alone is enough for one person, perhaps,--talk,\r\nalone, for another; but the grand equalizer and fraternizer, which works\r\nup the radiators to their maximum radiation, and the absorbents to their\r\nmaximum receptivity, is now just where it was when\r\n\r\n  \"The conscious water saw its Lord and\r\n  blushed,\"\r\n\r\n--when six great vessels containing water, which seems to have been\r\ncarefully purified, so as to be ready for the marriage-feast, were\r\nchanged into the best of wine. I once wrote a song about wine, in which\r\nI spoke so warmly of it, that I was afraid some would think it was\r\nwritten _inter pocula_; whereas it was composed in the bosom of my\r\nfamily, under the most tranquillizing domestic influences.\r\n\r\n----The divinity-student turned towards me, looking mischievous.--Can\r\nyou tell me,--he said,--who wrote a song for a temperance celebration\r\nonce, of which the following is a verse?--\r\n\r\n  Alas for the loved one, too gentle and fair\r\n  The joys of the banquet to chasten and share!\r\n  Her eye lost its light that his goblet might shine,\r\n  And the rose of her cheek was dissolved in his wine!\r\n\r\n_I_ did,--I answered.--What are you going to do about it?--I will tell\r\nyou another line I wrote long ago:--\r\n\r\n  Don't be \"consistent,\"--but be simply _true_.\r\n\r\nThe longer I live, the more I am satisfied of two things: first, that\r\nthe truest lives are those that are cut rose-diamond-fashion, with many\r\nfacets answering to the many-planed aspects of the world about them;\r\nsecondly, that society is always trying in some way or other to grind\r\nus down to a single flat surface. It is hard work to resist this\r\ngrinding-down action.--Now give me a chance. Better eternal and\r\nuniversal abstinence than the brutalities of those days that made wives\r\nand mothers and daughters and sisters blush for those whom they should\r\nhave honored, as they came reeling home from their debauches! Yet better\r\neven excess than lying and hypocrisy; and if wine is upon all our\r\ntables, let us praise it for its color and fragrance and social\r\ntendency, so far as it deserves, and not hug a bottle in the closet and\r\npretend not to know the use of a wine-glass at a public dinner! I think\r\nyou will find that people who honestly mean to be true really contradict\r\nthemselves much more rarely than those who try to be \"consistent.\" But\r\na great many things we say can be made to appear contradictory, simply\r\nbecause they are partial views of a truth, and may often look unlike at\r\nfirst, as a front view of a face and its profile often do.\r\n\r\nHere is a distinguished divine, for whom I have great respect, for I owe\r\nhim a charming hour at one of our literary anniversaries, and he has\r\noften spoken noble words; but he holds up a remark of my friend the\r\n\"Autocrat,\"--which I grieve to say he twice misquotes, by omitting the\r\nvery word which gives it its significance,--the word _fluid_, intended\r\nto typify the mobility of the restricted will,--holds it up, I say, as\r\nif it attacked the reality of the self-determining principle, instead\r\nof illustrating its limitations by an image. Now I will not explain any\r\nfarther, still less defend, and least of all attack, but simply quote\r\na few lines from one of my friend's poems, printed more than ten years\r\nago, and ask the distinguished gentleman where _he_ has ever asserted\r\nmore strongly or absolutely the independent will of the \"subcreative\r\ncentre,\" as my heretical friend has elsewhere called man.\r\n\r\n  --Thought, conscience, will, to make them all thy own\r\n  He rent a pillar from the eternal throne!\r\n  --Made in His image, thou must nobly dare\r\n  The thorny crown of sovereignty to share.\r\n  --Think not too meanly of thy low estate;\r\n  Thou hast a choice; to choose is to create!\r\n\r\nIf he will look a little closely, he will see that the profile and the\r\nfull-face views of the will are both true and perfectly consistent.\r\n\r\nNow let us come back, after this long digression, to the conversation\r\nwith the intelligent Englishman. We begin skirmishing with a few light\r\nideas,--testing for thoughts,--as our electro-chemical friend, De Sauty,\r\nif there were such a person, would test for his current; trying a little\r\nlitmus-paper for acids, and then a slip of turmeric-paper for alkalies,\r\nas chemists do with unknown compounds; flinging the lead, and looking\r\nat the shells and sands it brings up to find out whether we are like\r\nto keep in shallow water, or shall have to drop the deep-sea line;--in\r\nshort, seeing what we have to deal with. If the Englishman gets his\r\nHs pretty well placed, he comes from one of the higher grades of the\r\nBritish social order, and we shall find him a good companion.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, here is a great fact between us. We belong to two\r\ndifferent civilizations, and, until we recognize what separates us, we\r\nare talking like Pyramus and Thisbe,--without any hole in the wall to\r\ntalk through. Therefore, on the whole, if he were a superior fellow,\r\nincapable of mistaking it for personal conceit, I think I would let out\r\nthe fact of the real American feeling about Old-World folks. They are\r\nchildren to us in certain points of view. They are playing with toys we\r\nhave done with for whole generations. That silly little drum they are\r\nalways beating on, and the trumpet and the feather they make so much\r\nnoise and cut such a figure with, we have not quite outgrown, but play\r\nwith much less seriously and constantly than they do. Then there is a\r\nwhole museum of wigs, and masks, and lace-coats, and gold-sticks, and\r\ngrimaces, and phrases, which we laugh at, honestly, without affectation,\r\nthat are still used in the Old-World puppet-shows. I don't think we\r\non our part ever understand the Englishman's concentrated loyalty and\r\nspecialized reverence. But then we do think more of a man, as such,\r\n(barring some little difficulties about race and complexion which the\r\nEnglishman will touch us on presently,) than any people that ever lived\r\ndid think of him. Our reverence is a great deal wider, if it is less\r\nintense. We have caste among us, to some extent, it is true; but there\r\nis never a collar on the American wolf-dog such as you often see on the\r\nEnglish mastiff, notwithstanding his robust, hearty individuality.\r\n\r\nThis confronting of two civilizations is always a grand sensation to me;\r\nit is like cutting through the isthmus and letting the two oceans swim\r\ninto each other's laps. The trouble is, it is so difficult to let out\r\nthe whole American nature without its self-assertion seeming to take a\r\npersonal character. But I never enjoy the Englishman so much as when he\r\ntalks of church and king like Manco Capac among the Peruvians. Then you\r\nget the real British flavor, which the cosmopolite Englishman loses. The\r\nbest conversation I have had with one of them for a long time, lively,\r\nfluent, courteous, delightful, was a variation and illustrative\r\ndevelopment in elegant phrases of the following short sentences.\r\n\r\n_Englishman_.--Sir, your New-World civilization is barbarism.\r\n\r\n_American_.--Sir, your Old-World development is infancy.\r\n\r\nHow much better this thorough interpenetration of ideas than a barren\r\ninterchange of courtesies, or a bush-fighting argument, in which each\r\nman tries to cover as much of himself and expose as much of his opponent\r\nas the tangled thicket of the disputed ground will let him!\r\n\r\n----My thoughts flow in layers or strata, at least three deep. I follow\r\na slow person's talk, and keep a perfectly clear under-current of my own\r\nbeneath it. My friend the Autocrat has already made a similar remark.\r\nUnder both runs obscurely a consciousness belonging to a third train of\r\nreflections, independent of the two others. I will try to write out a\r\nmental movement in three parts.\r\n\r\nA.--First part, or Mental Soprano,--thought follows a woman talking.\r\n\r\nB.--Second part, or Mental Barytone,--my running accompaniment.\r\n\r\nC.--Third part, or Mental Basso,--low grumble of an importunate\r\nself-repeating idea.\r\n\r\nA.--White lace, three skirts, looped with flowers, wreath of\r\napple-blossoms, gold bracelets, diamond pin and earrings, the most\r\ndelicious _berthe_ you ever saw, white satin slippers----\r\n\r\nB.--Deuse take her! What a fool she is! Hear her chatter! (Look out of\r\nwindow just here.--Two pages and a half of description, if it were\r\nall written out, in one tenth of a second.)--Go ahead, old lady! (Eye\r\ncatches picture over fireplace.) There's that infernal family nose! Came\r\nover in the \"Mayflower\" on the first old fool's face. Why don't they\r\nwear a ring in it?\r\n\r\nC.--You'll be late at lecture,--late at lecture,--late,--late,--late----\r\n\r\nI observe that a deep layer of thought sometimes makes itself felt\r\nthrough the superincumbent strata, thus:--The usual single or double\r\ncurrents shall flow on, but there shall be an influence blending with\r\nthem, disturbing them in an obscure way, until all at once I say,--Oh,\r\nthere! I knew there was something troubling me,--and the thought which\r\nhad been working through comes up to the surface clear, definite, and\r\narticulates itself,--a disagreeable duty, perhaps, or an unpleasant\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nThe inner world of thought and the outer world of events are alike in\r\nthis, that they are both brimful. There is no space between consecutive\r\nthoughts or between the never-ending series of actions. All pack tight,\r\nand mould their surfaces against each other, so that in the long run\r\nthere is a wonderful average uniformity in the forms of both thoughts\r\nand actions,--just as you find that cylinders crowded all become\r\nhexagonal prisms, and spheres pressed together are formed into regular\r\npolyhedra.\r\n\r\nEvery event that a man would master must be mounted on the run, and no\r\nman ever caught the reins of a thought except as it galloped by him. So,\r\nto carry out, with another comparison, my remark about the layers of\r\nthought, we may consider the mind, as it moves among thoughts or events,\r\nlike a circus-rider whirling round with a great troop of horses. He can\r\nmount a fact or an idea, and guide it more or less completely, but he\r\ncannot stop it. So, as I said in another way at the beginning, he can\r\nstride two or three thoughts at once, but not break their steady walk,\r\ntrot, or gallop. He can only take his foot from the saddle of one\r\nthought and put it on that of another.\r\n\r\n----What is the saddle of a thought? Why, a word, of course.--Twenty\r\nyears after you have dismissed a thought, it suddenly wedges up to you\r\nthrough the press, as if it had been steadily galloping round and round\r\nall that time without a rider.\r\n\r\nThe will does not act in the interspaces of thought, for there are no\r\nsuch interspaces, but simply steps from the back of one moving thought\r\nupon that of another.\r\n\r\n----I should like to ask,--said the divinity-student,--since we are\r\ngetting into metaphysics, how you can admit space, if all things are in\r\ncontact, and how you can admit time, if it is always _now_ to something.\r\n\r\n--I will thank you for the dry toast,--was my answer.\r\n\r\n----I wonder if you know this class of philosophers in books or\r\nelsewhere. One of them makes his bow to the public, and exhibits an\r\nunfortunate truth bandaged up so that it cannot stir hand or foot,--as\r\nhelpless, apparently, and unable to take care of itself, as an Egyptian\r\nmummy. He then proceeds, with the air and method of a master, to take\r\noff the bandages. Nothing can be neater than the way in which he does\r\nit. But as he takes off layer after layer, the truth seems to grow\r\nsmaller and smaller, and some of its outlines begin to look like\r\nsomething we have seen before. At last, when he has got them all off,\r\nand the truth struts out naked, we recognize it as a diminutive and\r\nfamiliar acquaintance whom we have known in the streets all our lives.\r\nThe fact is, the philosopher has coaxed the truth into his study and put\r\nall those bandages on; of course it is not very hard for him to take\r\nthem off. Still, a great many people like to watch the process,--he does\r\nit so neatly!\r\n\r\nDear! dear! I am ashamed to write and talk, sometimes, when I see how\r\nthose functions of the large-brained, thumb-opposing plantigrade are\r\nabused by my fellow-vertebrates,--perhaps by myself. How they spar for\r\nwind, instead of hitting from the shoulder!\r\n\r\n----The young fellow called John arose and placed himself in a neat\r\nfighting attitude.--Fetch on the fellah that makes them long words!--he\r\nsaid,--and planted a straight hit with the right fist in the concave\r\npalm of the left hand with a click like a cup and ball.--You small boy\r\nthere, hurry up that \"Webster's Unabridged!\"\r\n\r\nThe little gentleman with the malformation, before described, shocked\r\nthe propriety of the breakfast-table by a loud utterance of three words,\r\nof which the two last were \"Webster's Unabridged,\" and the first was an\r\nemphatic monosyllable.--Beg pardon,--he added,--forgot myself. But let\r\nus have an English dictionary, if we are to have any. I don't believe in\r\nclipping the coin of the realm, Sir! If I put a weathercock on my house,\r\nSir, I want it to tell which way the wind blows up aloft,--off from the\r\nprairies to the ocean, or off from the ocean to the prairies, or any\r\nway it wants to blow! I don't want a weathercock with a winch in an old\r\ngentleman's study that he can take hold of and turn, so that the vane\r\nshall point west when the great wind overhead is blowing east with all\r\nits might, Sir! Wait till we give you a dictionary, Sir! It takes Boston\r\nto do that thing, Sir!\r\n\r\n----Some folks think water can't run down-hill anywhere out of\r\nBoston,--remarked the Koh-i-noor.\r\n\r\nI don't know what _some folks think_ so well as I know what _some fools\r\nsay_,--rejoined Little Boston.--If importing most dry goods made the\r\nbest scholars, I dare say you would know where to look for 'em.--Mr.\r\nWebster couldn't spell, Sir, or wouldn't spell, Sir,--at any rate, he\r\ndidn't spell; and the end of it was a fight between the owners of\r\nsome copyrights and the dignity of this noble language which we have\r\ninherited from our English fathers,--language!--the blood of the soul,\r\nSir! into which our thoughts run and out of which they grow! We know\r\nwhat a word is worth here in Boston. Young Sam Adams got up on the stage\r\nat Commencement, out at Cambridge there, with his gown on, the Governor\r\nand Council looking on in the name of his Majesty, King George the\r\nSecond, and the girls looking down out of the galleries, and taught\r\npeople how to spell a word that wasn't in the Colonial dictionaries!\r\n_R-e, re, s-i-s, sis, t-a-n-c-e, tance, Resistance!_ That was in '43,\r\nand it was a good many years before the Boston boys began spelling it\r\nwith their muskets;--but when they did begin, they spelt it so loud that\r\nthe old bedridden women in the English almshouses heard every syllable!\r\nYes, yes, yes,--it was a good while before those other two Boston boys\r\ngot the class so far along that it could spell those two hard words,\r\n_Independence_ and _Union!_ I tell you what, there are a thousand lives,\r\naye, sometimes a million, go to get a new word into a language that is\r\nworth speaking. We know what language means too well here in Boston to\r\nplay tricks with it. We never make a new word till we have made a new\r\nthing or a new thought, Sir! When we shaped the new mould of this\r\ncontinent, we had to make a few. When, by God's permission, we abrogated\r\nthe primal curse of maternity, we had to make a word or two. The\r\ncutwater of this great Leviathan clipper, the OCCIDENTAL,--this\r\nthirty-masted wind-and-steam wave-crusher,--must throw a little spray\r\nover the human vocabulary as it splits the waters of a new world's\r\ndestiny!\r\n\r\nHe rose as he spoke, until his stature seemed to swell into the fair\r\nhuman proportions. His feet must have been on the upper round of his\r\nhigh chair;--that was the only way I could account for it.\r\n\r\nPuts her through fust-rate,--said the young fellow whom the boarders\r\ncall John.\r\n\r\nThe venerable and kind-looking old gentleman who sits opposite said he\r\nremembered Sam Adams as Governor. An old man in a brown coat. Saw him\r\ntake the Chair on Boston Common. Was a boy then, and remembers sitting\r\non the fence in front of the old Hancock house. Recollects he had a\r\nglazed 'lection-bun, and sat eating it and looking down on to the\r\nCommon. Lalocks flowered late that year, and he got a great bunch off\r\nfrom the bushes in the Hancock front-yard.\r\n\r\nThem 'lection buns are no go,--said the young man John, so called.--I\r\nknow the trick. Give a fellah a fo'penny bun in the mornin', an' he\r\ndowns the whole of it. In about an hour it swells up in his stomach as\r\nbig as a football, and his feedin's sp'ilt for _that_ day. That's the\r\nway to stop off a young one from eatin' up all the 'lection dinner.\r\n\r\nSalem! Salem! not Boston,--shouted the little man.\r\n\r\nBut the Koh-i-noor laughed a great rasping laugh, and the boy\r\nBenjamin Franklin looked sharp at his mother, as if he remembered the\r\nbun-experiment as a part of his past personal history.\r\n\r\nLittle Boston was holding a fork in his left hand. He stabbed a boulder\r\nof home-made bread with it, mechanically, and looked at it as if it\r\nought to shriek. It did not,--but he sat as if watching it.\r\n\r\n----Language is a solemn thing,--I said.--It grows out of life,--out of\r\nits agonies and ecstasies, its wants and its weariness. Every language\r\nis a temple, in which the soul of those who speak it is enshrined.\r\nBecause time softens its outlines and rounds the sharp angles of its\r\ncornices, shall a fellow take a pickaxe to help time? Let me tell you\r\nwhat comes of meddling with things that can take care of themselves.--A\r\nfriend of mine had a watch given him, when he was a boy,--a \"bull's\r\neye,\" with a loose silver case that came off like an oyster-shell from\r\nits contents; you know them,--the cases that you hang on your thumb,\r\nwhile the _core_ or the real watch lies in your hand as naked as a\r\npeeled apple. Well, he began with taking off the case, and so on from\r\none liberty to another, until he got it fairly open, and there were the\r\nworks, as good as if they were alive,--crown-wheel, balance-wheel, and\r\nall the rest. All right except one thing,--there was a confounded little\r\n_hair_ had got tangled round the balance-wheel. So my young Solomon\r\ngot a pair of tweezers, and caught hold of the _hair_ very\r\nnicely, and pulled it right out, without touching any of the\r\nwheels,--when,--buzzzZZZ! and the watch had done up twenty-four hours in\r\ndouble magnetic-telegraph time!--The English language was wound up to\r\nrun some thousands of years, I trust; but if everybody is to be pulling\r\nat everything he thinks is a _hair_, our grandchildren will have to\r\nmake the discovery that it is a hair-_spring_, and the old Anglo-Norman\r\nsoul's-timekeeper will run down, as so many other dialects have done\r\nbefore it. I can't stand this meddling any better than you, Sir. But\r\nwe have a great deal to be proud of in the lifelong labors of that old\r\nlexicographer, and we mustn't be ungrateful. Besides, don't let us\r\ndeceive ourselves, the war of the dictionaries is only a disguised\r\nrivalry of cities, colleges, and especially of publishers. After all,\r\nthe language will shape itself by larger forces than phonography and\r\ndictionary-making. You may spade up the ocean as much as you like, and\r\nharrow it afterwards, if you can,--but the moon will still lead the\r\ntides, and the winds will form their surface.\r\n\r\n----Do you know Richardson's Dictionary?--I said to my neighbor the\r\ndivinity-student.\r\n\r\nHaöw?--said the divinity-student.--He colored, as he noticed on my face\r\na twitch in one of the muscles which tuck up the corner of the mouth,\r\n(_zygomaticus major_,) and which I could not hold back from making a\r\nlittle movement on its own account.\r\n\r\nIt was too late.--A country-boy, lassoed when he was a half-grown colt.\r\nJust as good as a city-boy, and in some ways, perhaps, better,--but\r\ncaught a little too old not to carry some marks of his earlier ways of\r\nlife. Foreigners, who have talked a strange tongue half their lives,\r\nreturn to the language of their childhood in their dying hours.\r\nGentlemen in fine linen, and scholars in large libraries, taken by\r\nsurprise, or in a careless moment, will sometimes let slip a word they\r\nknew as boys in homespun and have not spoken since that time,--but it\r\nlay there under all their culture. That is one way you may know the\r\ncountry-boys after they have grown rich or celebrated; another is by the\r\nodd old family names, particularly those of the Hebrew prophets, which\r\nthe good old people have saddled them with.\r\n\r\n----Boston has enough of England about it to make a good English\r\ndictionary,--said that fresh-looking youth whom I have mentioned as\r\nsitting at the right upper corner of the table.\r\n\r\nI turned and looked him full in the face,--for the pure, manly\r\nintonations arrested me. The voice was youthful, but full of\r\ncharacter.--I suppose some persons have a peculiar susceptibility in the\r\nmatter of voice.--Hear this.\r\n\r\nNot long after the American Revolution, a young lady was sitting in her\r\nfather's chaise in a street of this town of Boston. She overheard a\r\nlittle girl talking or singing, and was mightily taken with the tones of\r\nher voice. Nothing would satisfy her but she must have that little girl\r\ncome and live in her father's house. So the child came, being then nine\r\nyears old. Until her marriage she remained under the same roof with\r\nthe young lady. Her children became successively inmates of the lady's\r\ndwelling; and now, _seventy_ years, or thereabouts, since the young lady\r\nheard the child singing, one of that child's children and one of her\r\ngrandchildren are with her in that home, where she, no longer young,\r\nexcept in heart, passes her peaceful days.--Three generations linked\r\ntogether by so light a breath of accident!\r\n\r\nI liked the sound of this youth's voice, I said, and his look when I\r\ncame to observe him a little more closely. His complexion had something\r\nbetter than the bloom and freshness which had first attracted me;--it\r\nhad that diffused _tone_ which is a sure index of wholesome lusty life.\r\nA fine liberal style of nature it seemed to be: hair crisped, moustache\r\nspringing thick and dark, head firmly planted, lips finished, as one\r\ncommonly sees them in gentlemen's families, a pupil well contracted, and\r\na mouth that opened frankly with a white flash of teeth that looked as\r\nif they could serve him as they say Ethan Allen's used to serve their\r\nowner,--to draw nails with. This is the kind of fellow to walk a\r\nfrigate's deck and bowl his broadsides into the \"Gallant Thunderbomb,\"\r\nor any forty-portholed adventurer who would like to exchange a few tons\r\nof iron compliments.--I don't know what put this into my head, for it\r\nwas not till some time afterward I learned the young fellow had been in\r\nthe naval school at Annapolis. Something had happened to change his plan\r\nof life, and he was now studying engineering and architecture in Boston.\r\n\r\nWhen the youth made the short remark which drew my attention to him, the\r\nlittle deformed gentleman turned round and took a long look at him.\r\n\r\nGood for the Boston boy!--he said.\r\n\r\nI am not a Boston boy,--said the youth, smiling,--I am a Marylander.\r\n\r\nI don't care where you come from,--we'll make a Boston man of you,--said\r\nthe little gentleman.--Pray, what part of Maryland did you come from,\r\nand how shall I call you?\r\n\r\nThe poor youth had to speak pretty loud, as he was at the right upper\r\ncorner of the table, and Little Boston next the lower left-hand corner.\r\nHis face flushed a little, but he answered pleasantly,--telling who\r\nhe was, as if the little man's infirmity gave him a right to ask any\r\nquestions he wanted to.\r\n\r\nHere is the place for you to sit,--said the little gentleman, pointing\r\nto the vacant chair next his own, at the corner.\r\n\r\nYou're go'n' to have a young lady next you, if you wait till\r\nto-morrow,--said the landlady to Little Boston.\r\n\r\nHe did not reply, but I had a fancy, that he changed color. It can't\r\nbe that _he_ has susceptibilities with reference to a contingent young\r\nlady! It can't be that he has had experiences which make him sensitive!\r\nNature could not be quite so cruel as to set a heart throbbing in\r\nthat poor little cage of ribs! There is no use in wasting notes of\r\nadmiration. I must ask the landlady about him.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the facts she furnished.--Has not been long with her.\r\nBrought a sight of furniture,--couldn't hardly get some of it up-stairs.\r\nHasn't seemed particularly attentive to the ladies. The Bombazine\r\n(whom she calls Cousin something or other) has tried to enter into\r\nconversation with him, but retired with the impression that he was\r\nindifferent to ladies' society. Paid his bill the other day without\r\nsaying a word about it. Paid it in gold,--had a great heap of\r\ntwenty-dollar pieces. Hires her best room. Thinks he is a very nice\r\nlittle man, but lives dreadful lonely up in his chamber. Wants the care\r\nof some capable nuss. Never pitied anybody more in her life,--never see\r\na more interestin' person.\r\n\r\n----My intention was, when I began making these notes, to let them\r\nconsist principally of conversations between myself and the other\r\nboarders. So they will, very probably; but my curiosity is excited about\r\nthis little boarder of ours, and my reader must not be disappointed, if\r\nI sometimes interrupt a discussion to give an account of whatever fact\r\nor traits I may discover about him. It so happens that his room is\r\nnext to mine, and I have the opportunity of observing many of his ways\r\nwithout any active movements of curiosity. That his room contains heavy\r\nfurniture, that he is a restless little body and is apt to be up late,\r\nthat he talks to himself, and keeps mainly to himself, is nearly all I\r\nhave found out.\r\n\r\nOne curious circumstance happened lately, which I mention without\r\ndrawing an absolute inference.--Being at the studio of a sculptor with\r\nwhom I am acquainted, the other day, I saw a remarkable cast of a _left\r\narm_. On my asking where the model came from, he said it was taken\r\ndirect from the arm of a _deformed person_, who had employed one of the\r\nItalian moulders to make the cast. It was a curious case, it should\r\nseem, of one beautiful limb upon a frame otherwise singularly\r\nimperfect.--I have repeatedly noticed this little gentleman's use of his\r\nleft arm. Can he have furnished the model I saw at the sculptor's?\r\n\r\n----So we are to have a new boarder to-morrow. I hope there will be\r\nsomething pretty and pleasant about her. A woman with a creamy\r\nvoice, and finished in _alto rilievo_, would be a variety in the\r\nboarding-house,--a little more marrow and a little less sinew than our\r\nlandlady and her daughter and the bombazine-clad female, all of whom are\r\nof the turkey-drumstick style of organization. I don't mean that these\r\nare our only female companions; but the rest being conversational\r\nnon-combatants, mostly still, sad feeders, who take in their food as\r\nlocomotives take in wood and water, and then wither away from the table\r\nlike blossoms that never come to fruit, I have not yet referred to them\r\nas individuals.\r\n\r\nI wonder what kind of a young person we shall see in that empty chair\r\nto-morrow!\r\n\r\n----I read this song to the boarders after breakfast the other morning.\r\nIt was written for our fellows;--you know who they are, of course.\r\n\r\nTHE BOYS.\r\n\r\n  Has there any old fellow got mixed with the boys?\r\n  If there has, take him out, without making a noise!\r\n  Hang the Almanac's cheat and the Catalogue's spite!\r\n  Old Time is a liar! We're twenty to-night!\r\n\r\n  We're twenty! We're twenty! Who says we are more?\r\n  He's tipsy,--young jackanapes!--show him the door!--\r\n  \"Gray temples at twenty?\"--Yes! _white_, if we please;\r\n  Where the snow-flakes fall thickest there's nothing can freeze!\r\n\r\n  Was it snowing I spoke of? Excuse the mistake!\r\n  Look close,--you will see not a sign of a flake;\r\n  We want some new garlands for those we have shed,--\r\n  And these are white roses in place of the red!\r\n\r\n  We've a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told,\r\n  Of talking (in public) as if we were old;--\r\n  That boy we call \"Doctor,\" and this we call \"Judge\";--\r\n  It's a neat little fiction,--of course it's all fudge.\r\n\r\n  That fellow's the \"Speaker,\"--the one on the right;\r\n  \"Mr. Mayor,\" my young one, how are you to-night?\r\n  That's our \"Member of Congress,\" we say when we chaff;\r\n  There's the \"Reverend\"--What's his name?--don't make me laugh!\r\n\r\n  That boy with the grave mathematical look\r\n  Made believe he had written a wonderful book,\r\n  And the ROYAL ACADEMY thought it was _true!_\r\n  So they chose him right in; a good joke it was, too!\r\n\r\n  There's a boy,--we pretend,--with a three-decker-brain,\r\n  That could harness a team with a logical chain;\r\n  When he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire,\r\n  We called him \"The Justice,\" but now he's \"The Squire.\"\r\n\r\n  And there's a nice youngster of excellent pith,--\r\n  Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith,--\r\n  But he shouted a song for the brave and the free,--\r\n  --Just read on his medal,--\"My country,\"--\"of thee!\"\r\n\r\n  You hear that boy laughing?--You think he's all fun,--\r\n  But the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done.\r\n  The children laugh loud as they troop to his call,\r\n  And the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all!\r\n\r\n  Yes, we're boys,--always playing with tongue or with pen,--\r\n  And I sometimes have asked,--Shall we ever be men?\r\n  Shall we always be youthful and laughing and gay,\r\n  Till the last dear companion drops smiling away?\r\n\r\n  Then here's to our boyhood, its gold and its gray!\r\n  The stars of its Winter, the dews of its May!\r\n  And when we have done with our life-lasting toys\r\n  Dear Father, take care of thy children, the Boys!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE'S SHAKSPEARE.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _The Works of William Shakespeare_. Edited, etc., by\r\nRICHARD GRANT WHITE. Vols. II., III., IV., and V. Boston: Little, Brown,\r\n& Co. 1858]\r\n\r\n\r\n(SECOND NOTICE.)\r\n\r\nWe doubt if posterity owe a greater debt to any two men living in 1623\r\nthan to the two obscure actors who in that year published the first\r\nfolio edition of Shakspeare's plays. But for them, it is more than\r\nlikely that such of his works as had remained to that time imprinted\r\nwould have been irrecoverably lost, and among them were \"Julius Caesar,\"\r\n\"The Tempest,\" and \"Macbeth.\" But are we to believe them when they\r\nassert that they present to us the plays which they reprinted from\r\nstolen and surreptitious copies \"cured and perfect of their limbs,\" and\r\nthose which are original in their edition \"absolute in their numbers as\r\nhe [Shakspeare] conceived them\"? Alas, we have read too many theatrical\r\nannouncements, have been taught too often that the value of the promise\r\nwas in an inverse ratio to the generosity of the exclamation-marks, too\r\neasily to believe that! Nay, we have seen numberless processions of\r\nhealthy kine enter our native village unheralded save by the lusty\r\nshouts of drovers, while a wretched calf, cursed by stepdame Nature with\r\ntwo heads, was brought to us in a triumphal car, avant-couriered by\r\na band of music as abnormal as itself, and announced as the greatest\r\nwonder of the age. If a double allowance of vituline brains deserve such\r\nhonor, there are few commentators on Shakspeare that would have gone\r\nafoot, and the trumpets of Messieurs Heminge and Condell call up in our\r\nminds too many monstrous and deformed associations.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the value of the first folio as an authority? We are\r\ninclined to think that Mr. Collier (for obvious reasons) underrates\r\nit, and that Mr. White sometimes errs in the opposite direction. For\r\neighteen of the plays it is the only authority we have, and the only\r\none also for four others in their complete form. It is admitted that\r\nin several instances Heminge and Condell reprinted the earlier quarto\r\nimpressions with a few changes, sometimes for the better and sometimes\r\nfor the worse; and it is most probable that copies of those editions\r\n(whether surreptitious or not) had taken the place of the original\r\nprompter's books, as being more convenient and legible. Even in these\r\ncases it is not safe to conclude that all or even any of the variations\r\nwere made by the hand of Shakspeare himself. And where the players\r\nprinted from manuscript, is it likely to have been that of the author?\r\nThe probability is small that a writer so busy as Shakspeare must have\r\nbeen during his productive period should have copied out their parts for\r\nthe actors, himself, or that one so indifferent as he seems to have been\r\nto the mere literary fortunes of his works should have given any great\r\ncare to the correction of such copies, if made by others. The copies\r\nexclusively in the hands of Heminge and Condell were, it is manifest,\r\nin some cases, very imperfect, whether we account for the fact by the\r\nburning of the Globe Theatre or by the necessary wear and tear of years,\r\nand (what is worthy of notice) they are plainly more defective in some\r\nparts than in others. \"Measure for Measure\" is an example of this, and\r\nwe are not satisfied with being told that its ruggedness of verse is\r\nintentional, or that its obscurity is due to the fact that Shakspeare\r\ngrew more elliptical in his style as he grew older. Profounder in\r\nthought he doubtless became; though, in a mind like his, we believe that\r\nthis would imply only a more absolute supremacy in expression. But, from\r\nwhatever original we suppose either the quartos or the first folio to\r\nhave been printed, it is more than questionable whether the\r\nproof-sheets had the advantage of any revision other than that of the\r\nprinting-office. Steevens was of opinion that authors in the time of\r\nShakspeare never read their own proof-sheets; and Mr. Spedding, in his\r\nrecent edition of Bacon, comes independently to the same conclusion.[B]\r\nWe may be very sure that Heminge and Condell did not, as vicars, take\r\nupon themselves a disagreeable task which the author would have been too\r\ncareless to assume.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Vol. III. p. 348, _note_. He grounds his belief, not on the\r\nmisprinting of words, but on the misplacing of whole paragraphs. We were\r\nstruck with the same thing in the original edition of Chapman's _Biron's\r\nConspiracy and Tragedy_. One of the misprints which Mr. Spedding notices\r\naffords both a hint and a warning to the conjectural emendator. In the\r\nedition of _The Advancement of Learning_ printed in 1605 occurs the\r\nword _dusinesse_. In a later edition this was conjecturally changed to\r\n_business_; but the occurrence of _vertigine_ in the Latin translation\r\nenables Mr. Spedding to print rightly, _dizziness_.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, however strong a case may be made out against the Folio of\r\n1623, whatever sins of omission we may lay to the charge of Heminge and\r\nCondell, or of commission to that of the printers, it remains the only\r\ntext we have with any claims whatever to authenticity. It should be\r\ndeferred to as authority in all cases where it does not make Shakspeare\r\nwrite bad sense, uncouth metre, or false grammar, of all which we\r\nbelieve him to have been more supremely incapable than any other man who\r\never wrote English. Yet we would not speak unkindly even of the blunders\r\nof the Folio. They have put bread into the mouth of many an honest\r\neditor, publisher, and printer, for the last century and a half; and he\r\nwho loves the comic side of human nature will find the serious notes of\r\na _variorum_ edition of Shakspeare as funny reading as the funny ones\r\nare serious. Scarce a commentator of them all, for more than a hundred\r\nyears, but thought, as Alphonso of Castile did of Creation, that, if\r\nhe had only been at Shakspeare's elbow, he could have given valuable\r\nadvice; scarce one who did not know off-hand that there was never a\r\nseaport in Bohemia,--as if Shakspeare's world were one which Mercator\r\ncould have projected; scarce one but was satisfied that his ten\r\nfinger-tips were a sufficient key to those astronomic wonders of poise\r\nand counterpoise, of planetary law and cometary seeming-exception, in\r\nhis metres; scarce one but thought he could gauge like an ale-firkin\r\nthat intuition whose edging shallows may have been sounded, but\r\nwhose abysses, stretching down amid the sunless roots of Being and\r\nConsciousness, mock the plummet; scarce one but could speak with\r\ncondescending approval of that prodigious intelligence so utterly\r\nwithout congener that our baffled language must coin an adjective to\r\nqualify it, and none is so audacious as to say Shakspearian of any\r\nother. And yet, in the midst of our impatience, we cannot help thinking\r\nalso of how much healthy mental activity this one man has been the\r\noccasion, how much good he has indirectly done to society by withdrawing\r\nmen to investigations and habits of thought that secluded them from\r\nbaser attractions, for how many he has enlarged the circle of study and\r\nreflection; since there is nothing in history or politics, nothing in\r\nart or science, nothing in physics or metaphysics, that is not sooner or\r\nlater taxed for his illustration. This is partially true of all great\r\nminds, open and sensitive to truth and beauty through any large arc\r\nof their circumference; but it is true in an unexampled sense of\r\nShakspeare, the vast round of whose balanced nature seems to have been\r\nequatorial, and to have had a southward exposure and a summer sympathy\r\nat every point, so that life, society, statecraft serve us at last but\r\nas commentaries on him, and whatever we have gathered of thought, of\r\nknowledge, and of experience, confronted with his marvellous page,\r\nshrinks to a mere footnote, the stepping-stone to some hitherto\r\ninaccessible verse. We admire in Homer the blind placid mirror of the\r\nworld's young manhood, the bard who escapes from his misfortune in poems\r\nall memory, all life and bustle, adventure and picture; we revere in\r\nDante that compressed force of lifelong passion which could make a\r\nprivate experience cosmopolitan in its reach and everlasting in its\r\nsignificance; we respect in Goethe the Aristotelian poet, wise by\r\nweariless observation, witty with intention, the stately _Geheimerrath_\r\nof a provincial court in the empire of Nature. As we study these, we\r\nseem in our limited way to penetrate into their consciousness and to\r\nmeasure and master their methods;--but with Shakspeare it is just the\r\nother way; the more we have familiarized ourselves with the operations\r\nof our own consciousness, the more do we find, in reading him, that\r\nhe has been beforehand with us, and that, while we have been vainly\r\nendeavoring to find the door of his being, he has searched every nook\r\nand cranny of our own. While other poets and dramatists embody isolated\r\nphases of character and work inward from the phenomenon to the special\r\nlaw which it illustrates, he seems in some strange way unitary with\r\nhuman nature itself, and his own soul to have been the law- and\r\nlife-giving power of which his creations are only the phenomena. We\r\njustify or criticize the characters of other writers by our memory and\r\nexperience, and pronounce them natural or unnatural; but he seems to\r\nhave worked in the very stuff of which memory and experience are made,\r\nand we recognize his truth to Nature by an innate and unacquired\r\nsympathy, as if he alone possessed the secret of the \"ideal form and\r\nuniversal mould,\" and embodied generic types rather than individuals.\r\nIn this Cervantes alone has approached him; and Don Quixote and Sancho,\r\nlike the men and women of Shakspeare, are the contemporaries of\r\nevery generation, because they are not products of an artificial and\r\ntransitory society, but because they are animated by the primeval and\r\nunchanging forces of that humanity which underlies and survives the\r\nforever-fickle creeds and ceremonials of the parochial corners which we\r\nwho dwell in them sublimely call The World.\r\n\r\nBut the dropping of our _variorum_ volume upon the floor recalls us\r\nfrom our reverie, and, as we pick it up, we ask ourselves sadly, Is it\r\nfitting that we should have a Shakspeare according to plodding Malone\r\nor coarse-minded Steevens, both of whom would have had the headache all\r\ntheir lives after, could one of the Warwickshire plebeian's conceptions\r\nhave got into their brains and stretched them, and who would have hidden\r\nunder their bedclothes in a cold-sweat of terror, could they have\r\nseen the awful vision of Macbeth as he saw it? No! and to every other\r\ncommentator who has wantonly tampered with the text, or obscured it\r\nwith his inky cloud of paraphrase, we feel inclined to apply the\r\nquadrisyllable name of the brother of Agis, king of Sparta. Clearly, we\r\nshould be grateful to an editor who feels it his chief duty to scrape\r\naway these barnacles from the brave old hull, to replace with the\r\noriginal heart-of-oak the planks where these small but patient\r\nterebrators have bored away the tough fibre to fill the gap with\r\nsawdust!\r\n\r\nThis task Mr. White has undertaken, and, after such conscientious\r\nexamination of his work as the importance of it demands, after a painful\r\ncomparison, note by note, and reading by reading, of his edition with\r\nthose of Messrs. Knight, Collier, and Dyce, our opinion of his ability\r\nand fitness for his task has been heightened and confirmed. Not that we\r\nalways agree with him,--not that we do not think that in respect of the\r\nFolio text he has sometimes erred on the side of superstitious reverence\r\nfor it, and sometimes in too rashly abandoning it,--but, making all\r\ndue exceptions, we think that his edition is, in the phrase of our New\r\nEngland fathers in Israel, for substance, scope, and aim, the best\r\nhitherto published. The chief matter must in all cases be the text, and\r\nthe faults we find in him do not, as a general rule, affect that. Some\r\nof them are faults which his own better judgment, we think, will lead\r\nhim to avoid in his forthcoming volumes; and in regard to some, he will\r\nprobably honestly disagree with us as to their being faults at all. No\r\nconceivable edition of Shakspeare would satisfy all tastes;--sometimes\r\nwe have attached associations to received readings which make impartial\r\nperception impossible; sometimes we have imparted our own meaning to\r\na passage by too steady pondering over it, just as in twilight an\r\ninanimate thing will seem to move, if we look at it long, though the\r\nwavering be truly in our own overstrained vision; sometimes our personal\r\ntemperament will insensibly warp our judgment;--but Mr. White has\r\ngenerally shown so just a discrimination, that there are few instances\r\nwhere we dissent, and in these a pencil will enable every one to edit\r\nfor himself. Any criticism of an edition of Shakspeare must necessarily\r\nconcern itself with seemingly insignificant matters, often with a\r\ncomma or a syllable,--and the danger is always of degenerating into a\r\ncaptiousness and word-catching unworthy the lover of truth for its own\r\nsake. We shall endeavor to be minute without being small.\r\n\r\nMr. White reserves for a first volume (not yet published) his notices\r\nof Shakspeare's life, his remarks upon the text, and other general\r\nintroductory topics. In the second volume, he gives us an excellent copy\r\nof the Droeshout portrait, the preliminary matter of the Folio of 1628,\r\nwith notices of the writers of commendatory verses thereto prefixed, and\r\nof the principal actors who performed parts in Shakspeare's plays. We\r\nnotice particularly his discussion of the authorship of the verses\r\nsigned J.M.S. as a good example of the delicacy and acuteness of his\r\ncriticism. Though he has the great authority of Coleridge against him,\r\nwe think that he has constructed a very ingenious, strong, and even\r\nconvincing argument against the Milton theory. Each play is preceded\r\nby an Introduction, remarkably well digested and condensed, giving an\r\naccount of the text, and of the sources from which Shakspeare helped\r\nhimself to plots or incidents. We cannot but commend highly the\r\nself-restraint which marks these brief and pithy prefaces, and the\r\npertinency of every sentence to the matter in hand. The Germans, (to\r\nwhom we are undeniably indebted for the first philosophic appreciation\r\nof the poet,) being debarred by their alienage from the tempting\r\nparliament of verbal commentary and conflict, have made themselves such\r\nample amends by expatiations in the unfenced field of aesthetics and\r\nof that constructive criticism which is too often confined to the\r\narchitecture of Castles in Spain, that we feel as if Dogberry had\r\ncharged us in relation to them with that hopelessly bewildering\r\ncommission to \"_comprehend_ all vagrom men\" which we have hitherto\r\nconsidered applicable only to peripatetic lecturers. Mr. White wisely\r\nand kindly leaves us to Shakspeare and our own imaginations,--two very\r\npotent spells to conjure with,--and seems to be aware of the fact, that,\r\nin its application to a creative mind like that of the great Poet, the\r\nscience of teleology may sometimes find itself as much at fault as it so\r\noften is in attempting to fathom the designs of the Infinite Creator.\r\nRabelais solves the grave problem of the goodliness of Friar John's nose\r\nby the comprehensive formula, \"Because God willed it so\"; and it is well\r\nfor us in most cases to enjoy Shakspeare in the same pious way,--to\r\nsmell a rose without bothering ourselves about its having been made\r\nexpressly to serve the turn of the essence-peddlers of Shiraz. We yield\r\nthe more credit to Mr. White's self-denial in this respect, because\r\nhis notes prove him to be capable of profound as well as delicate and\r\nsympathetic exegesis. Shakspeare himself has left us a pregnant satire\r\non dogmatical and categorical esthetics (which commonly in discussion\r\nsoon lose their ceremonious tails and are reduced to the internecine dog\r\nand cat of their bald first syllables) in the cloud-scene between Hamlet\r\nand Polonius, suggesting exquisitely how futile is any attempt at a\r\ncast-iron definition of those perpetually metamorphic impressions of the\r\nbeautiful, whose source is as much in the man who looks as in the thing\r\nhe sees. And elsewhere more directly,--Mr. White must allow us the old\r\nreading for the sake of our illustration,--he has told us how\r\n\r\n        \"Affection,\r\n  Master of passion, sways it to the mood\r\n  Of what it likes or loathes.\"\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see, likewise, with what becoming indifference the matter\r\nof Shakspeare's indebtedness to others is treated by Mr. White in his\r\nIntroductions. There are many commentators who seem to think they have\r\nwormed themselves into the secret of the Master's inspiration when they\r\nhave discovered the sources of his plots. But what he took was by right\r\nof eminent domain; and was he not to resuscitate a theme and make it\r\nimmortal, because some botcher had tried his hand upon it before, and\r\nleft it for stone-dead? Because he could not help throwing sizes, was he\r\nto avoid the dice which for others would only come up ames-ace?\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of 1854,[C] there had been published in England and on\r\nthe Continent eighty-eight complete editions of Shakspeare in English,\r\nthirty-two in German, six in French, and five, more or less complete,\r\nin Italian. Beside these, his works had been translated into Dutch,\r\n(1778-82,) into Danish, (1807-28,) into Hungarian, (1824,) into Polish,\r\n(1842,) and into Swedish (1847-51). The numerous American editions are\r\nnot reckoned in this statement; and, to give an adequate notion of the\r\nextent of the Shakspeare-literature, we should add that the number of\r\nseparately-printed comments and other illustrative publications already\r\nexceeds five hundred. No other poet except Dante has received such\r\nappreciation,--and not even he, if we consider in Shakspeare's case the\r\ngreater bulk of the works and the difficulty of the language. After so\r\nmany people had used their best wit and had their say, could there be\r\nany unconsidered trifle left for a new editor? Could the sharpest eyes\r\nfind more needles in this enormous haystack? We do not pretend to have\r\nexamined the whole of this polyglot library, nay, but for Herr Sillig,\r\nwe had never heard of most of the books in it, but we are tolerably\r\nfamiliar with the more important English editions, and with some of the\r\nGerman comments,[D] and we must say that the freshness of many of Mr.\r\nWhite's observations struck us with very agreeable surprise. We are\r\nnot fond of off-hand opinions on any subject, much more on one so\r\nmultifarious and complex as this,--we are a great deal too ready with\r\nthem in America, and pronounce upon pictures and poems with a _b'hoyish_\r\nnonchalance that would be amusing, were it not for its ill consequence\r\nto Art,--but we love the expression of honest praise, of sifted and\r\nconsiderate judgment, and we think that a laborious collation justifies\r\nus in saying that in acute discrimination of aesthetic shades of\r\nexpression, and often of textual niceties, Mr. White is superior to any\r\nprevious editor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: _Die Shakspere-Literatur bis Mitte_ 1854. Zusammengestellt\r\nund herausgegeben von P.H. SILLIG. Leipzig. 1854.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: Among which (setting aside a few remarks of Goethe) we are\r\ninclined to value as highly us anything Tieck's _Essay on the Element of\r\nthe Wonderful in Shakspeare_.]\r\n\r\nIn proof of what we have said, we will refer to a few of the notes which\r\nhave particularly pleased us, and which show originality of view.\r\n\r\n(_Tempest_, Act ii. Sc. 2.)\r\n\r\n\"'_Nor scrape_ trenchering, _nor wash, dish_.'\r\n\r\n\"Dryden, Theobald, Dyce, Halliwell, and Hudson would have 'trenchering'\r\na typographical error for 'trencher,' which they introduce into the\r\ntext. Surely they must all have forgotten that _Caliban_ was drunk,\r\nand, after singing 'firing' and 'requiring,' would naturally sing\r\n'trenchering.' There is a drunken swing in the original line which is\r\nentirely lost in the precise, curtailed rhythm of--\r\n\r\n  '_Nor scrape_ trencher, _nor wash dish_.'\"\r\n\r\nOther editors had retained \"trenchering,\" but none, that we know, ever\r\ngave so good a reason for it. Equally good is his justification of\r\nhimself for omitting Theobald's interpolation of \"Did she nod?\" in \"Two\r\nGentlemen of Verona,\" Act i. Sc. 1. Other examples may be found in the\r\nreadings, \"There is a lady of Verona here,\" (same play, Act iii. Sc. 1);\r\n\"Yet reason dares her _on_,\" (_Measure for Measure_, Act iv. Sc. 4);\r\n\"Hark, how the villain would _glose_ now,\" (same play, Act v. Sc. 1);\r\n\"The forced fallacy,\" (_Comedy of Errors_, Act ii. Sc. 1); in the note\r\non \"Cupid is a good hare-finder,\" (_Much Ado_, Act i. Sc. 3); the\r\nadmirable note on \"Examine those men,\" (same play, Act iii. Sc. 1); the\r\nreadings, \"Out on thee! Seeming!\" (same play, Act iv. Sc. 1); \"For I\r\nhave only silent been,\" (ibid.); \"Goodly Count-Confèct,\" and note, (same\r\nplay, Act iv. Sc. 2); the note on \"I do beseech thee, remember thy\r\ncourtesy,\" (_Love's Labor's Lost_, Act v. Sc. 1); on \"Mounsieur Cobweb,\"\r\nand \"Help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch,\" (_Mid. Night's D_., Act iv. Sc.\r\n1); on \"Or in the night,\" etc. (same play, Act v. Sc. 1); on \"Is sum of\r\nnothing,\" (_Merchant of Venice_, Act iii. Sc. 2); on \"Stays me here at\r\nhome unkept,\" (_As you like it_, Act i. Sc. 1); on \"Unquestionable\r\nspirit,\" (same play, Act iii. Sc. 2); on \"Move the still-piecing air,\"\r\n(_All's Well_, etc., Act ii. Sc. 2); and on \"What is not holy,\" (same\r\nplay, Act iv. Sc. 2). We have referred to a few only out of the many\r\ninstances that have attracted our notice, and these chiefly for their\r\nbearing on what we have said of the editor's refinement of appreciation\r\nand originality of view. The merely illustrative and explanatory notes\r\nare also full and judicious, containing all that it is important the\r\nreader should know, and a great deal which it will entertain him to\r\nlearn. In the Introductions to the several plays, too, we find many\r\n_obiter dicta_ of Mr. White which are excellent in their clearness of\r\ncritical perception and conciseness of phrase. From that to the \"Comedy\r\nof Errors\" we quote the following sentence:--\r\n\r\n\"Concerning the place and the period of the action of this play, it\r\nseems that Shakspeare did not trouble himself to form a very accurate\r\nidea. The Ephesus of \"The Comedy of Errors\" is much like the Bohemia of\r\n\"The Winter's Tale,\"--a remote, unknown place, yet with a familiar and\r\nimposing name, and therefore well suited to the purposes of one who, as\r\npoet and dramatist, cared much for men and little for things, and to\r\nwhose perception the accidental was entirely eclipsed by the essential.\r\nAnachronisms are scattered through it with a profusion which could only\r\nbe the result of entire indifference,--in fact, of an absolute want of\r\nthought on the subject.\"--Vol. III. 189.\r\n\r\nWe think this could not be better said, if only we might supplant\r\n\"things\" with the more precise word \"facts\"; for about _things_\r\nShakspeare was never careless. It is only that deciduous foliage of\r\nfacts which every generation leaves heaps of behind it dry, and dead,\r\nthat he rustles through with eyes so royally unconcerned. As a good\r\nexample of Mr. White's style, we should be inclined to cite the\r\nIntroduction to \"Love's Labor's Lost,\" from which we detach this single\r\ncrystal:--\r\n\r\n\"It is ever the ambitious way of youthful genius to aim at novelty of\r\nform in its first essays, while yet in treatment it falls unconsciously\r\ninto a vein of reminiscence; afterward it is apt to return to\r\nestablished forms, and to show originality of treatment.\"\r\n\r\nThe temptation which too easily besets an editor of Shakspeare is to\r\ndiffer, if possible, from everybody who has gone before him, though but\r\nas between the N.E. and N.N.E. points in the circumference of a hair. We\r\ndo not find Mr. White guilty in this respect for what he has done, but\r\nsometimes for what he has left undone in allowing the Folio text to\r\nremain. The instance that has surprised us most is his not admitting\r\n(_As You Like it_, Act iv. Sc. 1) the reading,--\"The foolish _coroners_\r\nof that age found it was Hero of Sestos,\" instead of the unmeaning one,\r\n\"_chroniclers_.\" He has been forced, for the sake of sense, to make some\r\nchanges in the Folio text which seem to us quite as violent, and we\r\ncannot help thinking that the gain in aptness of phrase and coherence of\r\nmeaning would have justified him in doing as much here. He admits, in\r\nhis note on the passage, that the change is \"very plausible\"; but adds,\r\n\"If we can at will reduce a perfectly appropriate and uncorrupted word\r\nof ten letters to one of eight, and strike out such marked letters as\r\n_h_, _l_, and _e_, we may re-write Shakspeare at our pleasure.\" Mr.\r\nWhite has already admitted that \"_chroniclers_\" is not _perfectly_\r\nappropriate in admitting that the change is \"very plausible\"; and he has\r\nno right to assume that the word is uncorrupted,--for that is the very\r\npoint in question. As to the disparity in the number of letters, no one\r\nfamiliar with misprints will be surprised at it; and Mr. Spedding, in\r\nthe edition of Bacon already referred to, furnishes us with an example\r\nof blunder[E] precisely the reverse, in which one word of eight letters\r\nis given for two of ten, (_sciences_ for _six princess_,)--the printer\r\nin both cases having set up his first impression of what the word was\r\nfor the word itself. Had this occurred in Shakspeare, instead of Bacon,\r\nwe should have had a series of _variorum_ notes like this:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Bacon's Works, by Ellis, Spedding, & Heath. Vol. III. p.\r\n303, _note_.]\r\n\r\n\"That _sixpence_ was the word used by our author scarcely admits of\r\ndoubt. From a number of parallel passages we select the following:--\r\n\r\n'Live on _sixpence_ a day, and earn it.'--_Abernethy_.\r\n\r\n'I give thee sixpence? I will see thee and-so-forthed\r\nfirst!'--_Canning_.\r\n\r\n'Be shot for _sixpence_ on a battlefield.'--_Tennyson_.\r\n\r\n'Half a crown, two shillings and _sixpence_.'--_Niemand's Dictionary_.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we find our author using precisely the same word in the\r\n'Midsummer Night's Dream':--\r\n\r\n'Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life.'\" JONES.\r\n\r\n\"Had the passage read '_two_ princes,' we might have thought it genuine;\r\nsince 'the two kings of Brentford' must have been familiar to our great\r\npoet, and he was also likely to have that number deeply impressed on\r\nhis mind by the awful tragedy in the tower, (see _Richard the Third_,)\r\nwhere, it is remarkable, precisely that number of royal offspring\r\nsuffered at the hands of the crook-backed tyrant. The citation from\r\nNiemand's Dictionary, by the Rev. Mr. Jones, tells as much in favor of\r\n_two princes_ as of _sixpence_; for how could the miseries of a divided\r\nempire be more emphatically portrayed than in the striking, and, as it\r\nseems to me, touching phrase, HALF _a crown?_ Could we in any way read\r\n'_three_ princes,' we should find strong support in the tradition of\r\n'the three kings of Cologne,' and in the Arabian story of the 'Three\r\nCalenders.' The line quoted by Thomson, (Shakspeare, by Thomson, Vol.\r\nX. p. 701.) 'Under which King Bezonian, speak or die!' (though we agree\r\nwith him in preferring his pointing to the ordinary and meaningless\r\n'Under which King, Bezonian,' etc.) unhappily can throw no light on the\r\npresent passage till we know how many King Bezonians are intended,\r\nand who they were. Perhaps we should read _Belzonian_, and suppose a\r\nreference to the Egyptian monarchs whose tombs were first explored by\r\nthe intrepid Belzoni. The epithet would certainly be appropriate and in\r\nShakspeare's best manner; but among so many monarchs, a choice of two,\r\nor even three, would be embarrassing and invidious.\" BROWN.\r\n\r\n\"As for the 'Three Calenders,' there can be no reasonable question that\r\nShakspeare was well acquainted with the story; for that he had travelled\r\nextensively in the East I have proved in my 'Essay to show that Sir\r\nThomas Roe and William Shakspeare were identical'; and that he was\r\nfamiliar with the Oriental languages must be apparent to any one who has\r\nread my note on '_Concolinel_' (_Love's Labor's Lost_, Act iii. Sc. 1).\r\nBut that 'six princes' is the true reading is clear from the parallel\r\npassage in \"Richard the Third,\" which I am surprised that the usually\r\naccurate Mr. Brown should have overlooked,--'Methinks there be Six\r\nRichmonds in the field.'\" ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n\"I was at first inclined to the opinion of the late Mr. Robinson, but\r\nmaturer consideration has caused me to agree with the eloquent and\r\nerudite Jones. There is a definite meaning in the word _sixpence_; and\r\na similar error of the press in Lord Bacon's 'Advancement of Learning,'\r\nwhere the context shows that _sixpences_ and not _sciences_ was the word\r\nintended, leads me to suspect that the title of his _opus magnum_ should\r\nbe _De Augmentis Sixpenciarum_. Viewing the matter as a political\r\neconomist, such a topic would have been more worthy of the Lord\r\nChancellor of England; it would have been more in accordance with what\r\nwe know of the character of 'the meanest of mankind'; and the exquisite\r\nhumor of the title would tally precisely with what Ben Jonson tells us\r\nin his 'Discoveries,' under the head _Dominus Verulamius_, that\r\n'his language _(where he could spare or pass by a jest)_ was nobly\r\ncensorious.' Sir Thomas More had the same proneness to merriment,\r\na coincidence the more striking as both these great men were Lord\r\nChancellors. A comic stroke of this description would have been highly\r\nattractive to a mind so constituted, and might easily escape the notice\r\nof a printer, who was more likely to be intent upon the literal accuracy\r\nof the Latin than on the watch for extraordinary flights of humor.\"\r\nSMITH.\r\n\r\nBut we must return from our excursion into an imaginary _variorum_,\r\ndelightful because it requires no eyesight and no thought, to the more\r\nserious duty of examining the notes of Mr. White. We have mentioned a\r\nsingle instance in which we differ with him as to the propriety of a\r\nfanatical adherence to the text of the Folio of 1623. We differ, because\r\nwe think that sense is not all that we have a right to expect from\r\nShakspeare,--that it is, indeed, merely the body in which his genius\r\ncreates a soul of meaning, nay, oftentimes a double one, exoteric and\r\nesoteric, the _spiritus astralis_ and the _anima caelestis_. Had the\r\npassage been in verse, where the change might have damaged the rhythm,\r\n--had it been one of those ecstasies of Shakspearian imagination,\r\nto tamper with which because _we_ could not understand it would be\r\nBottom-like presumption,--one of those tempests of passion where every\r\nword reeks hot and sulphurous, like a thunderstone new-fallen,--in any\r\nof these cases we should have agreed with Mr. White that to abstain was\r\na duty. But in a sentence of lightsome and careless prose, and where the\r\nchances are great that the word to be changed is the accident of the\r\nprinter and not the choice of the author, we say, give us a text that is\r\ntrue to the context and the aesthetic instinct rather than to the Folio,\r\neven were that Pandora-box only half as full of manifest corruptions as\r\nit is.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Two Gentlemen of Verona,\" (Act iii. Sc. 1,) Mr. White prefers,\r\n\"She is not to be fasting in respect of her breath,\" to \"She is not to\r\nbe _kissed_ fasting in respect of her breath,\"--an emendation made by\r\nRowe,[F] and found also in Mr. Collier's Corrected Folio of 1632. We\r\ncannot agree with him in a reading which seems to us to destroy all the\r\npoint of the passage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: Mr. Dyce says the word supplied by Rowe was \"fasting,\" a\r\nmanifest slip of the pen, and worth notice only as showing how easily\r\nerrors may be committed.]\r\n\r\nIn Dumain's ode, (_Love's Labor's Lost_, Act iv. Sc. 3,) beginning,\r\n\r\n  \"On a day, (alack the day!)\r\n  Love, whose month is ever May,\"\r\n\r\nMr. White chooses to read\r\n\r\n  \"Thou, for whom Jove would swear\r\n  Juno but an Ethiop were,\"\r\n\r\nrather than accept Pope's suggestion of \"ev'n Jove,\" or the far better\r\n\"great Jove\" of Mr. Collier's Corrected Folio,--affirming that \"the\r\nquantity and accent proper to 'thou' make any addition to the line\r\nsuperfluous.\" We should like to hear Mr. White read the verse as he\r\nprints it. The result would be something of this kind:--\r\n\r\nThou-ou for whom Jove would swear,--\r\n\r\nwhich would be like the 'bow-wow-wow before the Lord' of the old\r\ncountry-choirs. To our ear it is quite out of the question; and,\r\nmoreover, we affirm that in dissyllabic (which we, for want of a better\r\nname, call iambic and trochaic) measures the omission of a half-foot\r\nis an impossibility, and all the more so when, as in this case, the\r\npreceding syllable is strongly accented. Even had the poem been meant\r\nfor singing, which it was not, for Dumain reads it, the quantity would\r\nbe false, though the ear might more easily excuse it. Such an omission\r\nwould be not only possible, but sometimes very effective, in trisyllabic\r\nmeasures,--as, for instance, in anapests like these,--\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis the middle of night by the castle clock,\r\n  And the owls have awakened the crowing cock,\"--\r\n\r\nwhere iambs or spondees may take the place of the first or second foot\r\nwith no shock to the ear, though the change of rhythm be sensible\r\nenough,--as\r\n\r\n  'Tis th[)e] d[=e][=e]p midnight by the castle clock,\r\n  And [)o]wls have awakened the crowing cock.\r\n\r\nWe quite agree with Mr. White and Mr. Knight in their hearty dislike of\r\nthe Steevens-system of versification, but we think that Coleridge (who,\r\nalthough the best English metrist since Milton, often thought lazily and\r\ntalked loosely) has misled both of them in what he has said about the\r\npauses and retardations of verse. In that noblest of our verses, the\r\nunrhymed iambic pentameter, two short or lightly-accented syllables\r\nmay often gracefully and effectively take the place of a long or\r\nheavily-accented one; but great metrists contrive their pauses by the\r\nartistic choice and position of their syllables, and not by leaving\r\nthem out. Metre is the solvent in which alone thought and emotion can\r\nperfectly coalesce,--the thought confining the emotion within decorous\r\nlimitations of law, the emotion beguiling the thought into somewhat of\r\nits own fluent grace and rebellious animation. That is ill metre which\r\ndoes not read itself in the mouth of a man thoroughly penetrated with\r\nthe meaning of what he reads; and only a man as thoroughly possessed\r\nof the meaning of what he writes can produce any metre that is not\r\nsing-song. Not that we would have Shakspeare's metre tinkered where it\r\nseems defective, but that we would not have palpable gaps defended as\r\nintentional by the utterly unsatisfactory assumption of pauses and\r\nretardations. Mr. White has in many cases wisely and properly made\r\nhalting verses perfect in their limbs by easy transpositions, and we\r\nthink he is perfectly right in refusing to interpolate a syllable, but\r\nwrong in assuming that we have Shakspeare's metre where we have no metre\r\nat all. We are not speaking of seeming irregularities, of lines broken\r\nup by rapid dialogue or cut short by the gulp of voiceless passion, nor\r\ndo we forget that Shakspeare wrote for the tongue and not the eye, but\r\nwe do not believe he ever left an unmusical period. Especially is this\r\ntrue of passages where the lyrical sentiment predominates, and we beg\r\nMr. White to reconsider whether we owe the reading\r\n\r\n  \"All overcanopied with luscious woodbine\"\r\n  (instead of _lush_)\r\n\r\nto the printers of the Folio or to Shakspeare. Even if we accept\r\nSteevens's \"whereon\" instead of \"where\" in the first verse of this\r\nexquisite piece of melody, and read (as Mr. White does not)\r\n\r\n  \"I know a bank whereon the wild thyme grows,\"\r\n\r\nit leaves the peculiar _lilt_ of the metre unchanged. The varied\r\naccentuation of the verses is striking; and would any one convince\r\nhimself of the variety of which this measure is capable, let him try to\r\nread this passage, and the speech of Prospero, beginning \"Ye elves of\r\nhills,\" to the same tune. In the verses,\r\n\r\n  \"And ye that on the sands with printless foot\r\n  Do chase the ebbing Neptune, | and do fly him\r\n  When he comes back,\"\r\n\r\nobserve how the pauses are contrived to echo the sense and give the\r\neffect of flux and reflux. Versification was understood in that day as\r\nnever since, and no treatise on English verse so good, in all respects,\r\nas that of Campion (1602) has ever been written. Coleridge learned from\r\nhim how to write his \"Catullian hendeca-syllables,\" and did not better\r\nhis instruction.[G]\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: For the comprehension of the laws of some of the lighter\r\nmeasures, no book is so instructive as Mother Goose's Melodies. That\r\nexcellent lady was one of the best metrists the language has produced.]\r\n\r\nIn \"Measure for Measure,\" (Act i. Sc. 1,) in this passage,--\r\n\r\n    \"what's open made\r\n  To justice, that justice seizes: what knows the law\r\n  That thieves do pass on thieves?\"\r\n\r\ndoes Mr. White believe the \"that\" and \"what\" are Shakspeare's? Does he\r\nconsider\r\n\r\n  \"To justice, that justice seizes: what knows the law\"\r\n\r\nan alexandrine,--and an alexandrine worthy of a student and admirer of\r\nSpenser? Should we read it thus, we should dread Martial's sarcasm of,\r\n_Sed male cum recitas_. We believe that Shakspeare wrote\r\n\r\n    \"What's open made\r\n  To Justice, Justice seizes; knows the Law\r\n  That thieve do pass on thieves?\"\r\n\r\nWe have pointed out a passage or two where we think Mr. White follows\r\nthe Folio text too literally. Two instances we have noted where he has\r\naltered, as we think, for the worse. The first is (_Tempest_, Act iii.\r\nSc. 3) where Mr. White reads,\r\n\r\n  \"You are three men of sin whom Destiny\r\n  (That hath to instrument this lower world\r\n  And what is in't) the never-surfeited sea\r\n  Hath caused to belch you up,--and on this island\r\n  Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men\r\n  Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad.\"\r\n\r\nThe Folio reads, \"Hath caused to belch up you\"; and Mr. White says in\r\nhis note, \"The tautological repetition of the pronoun was a habit,\r\nalmost a custom, with the Elizabethan dramatists.\" This may be true,\r\n(though we think the assertion rash,) but certainly never as in\r\nthis case. We think the Folio right, except in its punctuation. The\r\nrepetition of the \"you\" is emphatic, not tautological, and is demanded\r\nby the whole meaning of the passage. Ariel is taunting the persons\r\nshe addresses, with the intention of angering them; and the \"you\" is\r\nrepeated, because those highly respectable men cannot at first bring\r\ntheir minds to believe that such unsavory epithets are addressed to\r\nthem. We should punctuate thus, following the order of the words in the\r\nFolio,--\r\n\r\n  \"Hath caused to belch up,--you! and on this island,\r\n  Where man doth not inhabit;--you 'mongst men\r\n  Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad.\"\r\n\r\nIn the \"Comedy of Errors,\" (Act ii. Sc. 2,) Adriana, suspecting her\r\nhusband of unfaithfulness, says to him,--\r\n\r\n  \"For, if we two be one, and thou play false,\r\n  I do digest the poison of thy flesh,\r\n  Being strumpeted by thy contagion.\r\n  Keep, then, fair league and truce with thy\r\n       true bed;\r\n  I live distained, thou undishonored.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the reading of the Folio. Mr. White reads,\r\n\r\n  \"I live distained, thou one dishonored.\"\r\n\r\nBut we cannot help thinking that the true reading should be,\r\n\r\n  \"I live distained, though undishonored,\"\r\n\r\nwhich is a less forced construction, and coincides with the rest of the\r\npassage,--\"I am contaminate through thee, though in myself immaculate.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"As You Like it,\" (Act ii. Sc. 3,) Mr. White (with the Folio and some\r\nrecent editors) calls the Duke's wrestler, \"the _bonny_ priser of the\r\nDuke.\" The common reading is \"bony,\" which seems to us better, though\r\nwe believe _brawny_ to be the word intended. We likewise question\r\nMr. White's explanation of the word _priser_, which, he says, \"is\r\nprize-fighter, one who wins prizes.\" One who \"fights for prizes\" would\r\nhave been better; but we suspect that the word is more nearly akin\r\nwith the French _prise_ (in the sense of _venir aux prises_) than with\r\n_prix_. We should prefer also \"Aristotle's ethicks\" (_Taming of the\r\nShrew_, Act i. Sc. 1) to the ordinary \"Aristotle's checks,\" which is\r\nretained by Mr. White. In \"Much Ado about Nothing,\" (Act ii. Sc. 1,) we\r\nhave no doubt that Mr. Collier's corrector is right in reading \"_sink_\r\napace,\" though Mr. White states authoritatively that Shakspeare would\r\nnot have so written. It is only fair to Mr. White, however, to say that\r\nhe is generally open-minded toward readings suggested by others, and\r\nthat he accepts nearly all those of Mr. Collier's Corrected Folio on\r\nwhich honest lovers of Shakspeare would be likely to agree. In comparing\r\nhis notes with the text, our eye was caught by a verse in which there\r\nseems so manifest a corruption that we shall venture to throw down the\r\ndiscord-apple of a conjectural emendation. In the \"Merchant of Venice,\"\r\n(Act iii. Sc. 2,) where Bassanio is making his choice among the caskets,\r\nafter a long speech about \"outward shows\" and \"ornament,\" he is made to\r\nsay that ornament is,\r\n\r\n                   \"in a word,\r\n  The seeming truth which cunning _times_ put on\r\n  To entrap the wisest.\"\r\n\r\nWe find it hard to believe that _times_ is the right word here, and\r\nstrongly suspect that it has stolen the place of _tires_. The whole\r\nprevious tenor of the speech, and especially of the images immediately\r\npreceding that in question, appears to demand such a word.\r\n\r\nWe have said, that we considered the style and matter of Mr. White's\r\nnotes excellent. Indeed, to the purely illustrative notes we should\r\nhardly make an exception. There are two or three which we think in\r\nquestionable taste, and one where the temptation to say a sharp\r\nthing has led the editor to vulgarize the admirable Benedick, and to\r\nmisinterpret the text in a way so unusual for him that it is worth a\r\ncomment. When Benedick's friends are discussing the symptoms which show\r\nhim to be in love, Claudio asks,\r\n\r\n  \"When was he wont to wash his face?\"\r\n\r\nMr. White annotates thus:--\r\n\r\n\"That the benign effect of the tender passion upon _Benedick_ in this\r\nregard should be so particularly noticed, requires, perhaps, the remark,\r\nthat in Shakspeare's time our race had not abandoned itself to that\r\nreckless use of water, whether for ablution or potation, which has more\r\nrecently become one of its characteristic traits.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if there could be any doubt that \"wash\" means _cosmetic_ here, the\r\nnext speech of Don Pedro (\"Yea, or to _paint_ himself?\") would remove\r\nit. The gentlemen of all periods in history have been so near at least\r\nto godliness as is implied in cleanliness. The very first direction in\r\nthe old German poem of \"Tisch-zucht\" is to wash before coming to table;\r\nand in \"Parzival,\" Gurnamanz specially inculcates on his catechumen the\r\nsocial duty of always thoroughly cleansing himself on laying aside his\r\narmor. Such instances could be multiplied without end.\r\n\r\nIn annotating Shakspeare, it would, perhaps, be asking too much of\r\nan editor to give credit to its first finder for every scrap of\r\nillustration. The immense mass of notes already existing may, perhaps,\r\nbe fairly looked upon as a kind of dictionary, open to every one,\r\nand the use of which implies no indebtedness. Mr. White, in general,\r\nindicates the source whence he has drawn, though we have sometimes found\r\nhim negligent in this respect. He says, in the Advertisement prefixed to\r\nhis second volume, \"that in every case, where no such credit is\r\ngiven for a restoration, a conjecture, or a quotation, the editor is\r\nresponsible for it; and as he is disinclined to the giving of much\r\nprominence to claims of this sort, he has, in those cases, merely\r\nremarked, that 'hitherto' the text has stood thus or so.\" We have not\r\nbeen at the trouble of verifying every one of Mr. White's \"hithertos,\"\r\nbut we did so in two plays, and found in \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" four,\r\nand in \"Much Ado\" two cases, where the reading claimed as a restoration\r\noccurred also in Mr. Knight's excellent edition of 1842. These\r\noversights do not affect the correctness of Mr. White's text, but they\r\ndiminish our confidence in the accuracy of the collation to which he\r\nlays claim.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection which we have to make against Mr. White's text is,\r\nthat he has perversely allowed it to continue disfigured by vulgarisms\r\nof grammar and spelling. For example, he gives us _misconster_, and\r\nsays, \"This is not a mis-spelling or loose spelling of 'misconstrue,'\r\nbut the old form of the word.\" Mr. Dyce insisted on the same\r\ncacographical nicety in his \"Remarks\" on the editions of Mr. Collier and\r\nMr. Knight, but abandons it in his own with the artless admission that\r\n_misconstrue_ also occurs in the Folio. In one of the Camden Society's\r\npublications is a letter from Friar John Hylsey to Thomas Cromwell, in\r\nwhich we find \"As God is my jugge\";[H] but we do not believe that _jug_\r\nwas an old form of _judge_, though a philological convict might fancy\r\nthat the former word was a derivative of the latter. Had the phrase\r\noccurred in Shakspeare, we should have had somebody defending it as\r\ntenderly poetical. We cannot but think it a sacrifice in Mr. White that\r\nhe has given up the _whatsomeres_ of the Folio. He does retain _puisny_\r\nas the old form, but why not spell it _puisné_ and so indicate its\r\nmeaning? Mr. White informs us that \"the grammatical form in use in\r\nShakspeare's day\" was to have the verb govern a nominative case!\r\nAccordingly, he perpetuates the following oversight of the poet or\r\nblunder of the printer:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: _Suppression of the Monasteries_, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n            \"What he is, indeed,\r\n  More suits you to conceive, than _I_ to speak of.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, he says that _who_, as an objective case, \"is in accordance with\r\nthe grammatical usage of Shakspeare's day,\" (Vol. II. p. 86,) and that,\r\n\"considering the unsettled state of minor grammatical relations in\r\nShakspeare's time,\" it is possible that he wrote _whom_ as a nominative\r\n(Vol. V. p. 393). But the most extraordinary instance is where he makes\r\na nominative plural agree with a verb in the second person singular,\r\n(Vol. III. p. 121,) and justifies it by saying that \"such disagreements\r\n... are not uncommon in Shakspeare's writings, and those of his\r\ncontemporaries.\" The passage reads as follows in Mr. White's edition:--\r\n\r\n            \"A breath thou art,\r\n  Servile to all the skiey influences\r\n  That dost this habitation where thou keep'st\r\n  Hourly afflict.\"\r\n\r\nHanmer (mistaking the meaning) read _do_. Porson objected, on the ground\r\nthat it was _thou_ and not _influences_ which governed _dost_. Porson\r\nwas certainly right, and we wonder how any one could ever have\r\nunderstood the passage in any other way. The mediaevals had as much\r\ntrouble in reconciling free-will with judicial astrology as we with the\r\ndivine foreknowledge. A passage in Dante, it appears to us, throws light\r\non the meaning of the Duke's speech:--\r\n\r\n  \"Lo cielo i vostri movimenti inizia;\r\n  Non dico tutti; ma posto ch' io 'l dica\r\n  Lume v' è dato a bene ed a malizia,\r\n  E libero voler che, se fatica\r\n  Nelle prime battaglie col ciel dura,\r\n  Poi vince tutto se ben si notrica.\"\r\n\r\n  _Purg._, Cant. xvi.\r\n\r\n_Cielo_ is here used for the influence of the stars, as is clear from a\r\nparallel passage in the \"Convito.\" Accordingly, \"Though servile to all\r\nthe skyey influences, it is thou, breath as thou art, that dost hourly\r\nafflict thy body with the results of sin.\" But even if this be not the\r\nmeaning, is Mr. White correct in saying that _influence_ had no plural\r\nat that time?[I] Had he forgotten \"the sweet _influences_ of Pleiades\"?\r\nThe word occurs in this form not only in our version of the Bible,\r\nbut in that of Cranmer, and in the \"Breeches\" Bible. So in Chapman's\r\n\"Byron's Conspiracy,\" (Ed. 1608, B. 3,)\r\n\r\n  \"Where the beames of starres have carv'd\r\n  Their powerful _influences_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: Mr. White cites Dr. Richardson, but the Doctor is not\r\nalways a safe guide.]\r\n\r\nMr. White repeatedly couples together the translators of the Bible and\r\nShakspeare, but he seems to have studied their grammar but carelessly.\r\n\"_Whom_ therefore ye ignorantly worship, _him_ declare I unto you,\" is a\r\ncase in point, and we ought never to forget our danger from that dusky\r\npersonage who goes about \"seeking _whom_ he may devour.\" At a time\r\nwhen correction of the press was so imperfect, one instance of true\r\nconstruction should outweigh twenty false, and nothing could be easier\r\nthan the mistake of _who_ for _whom_, when the latter was written\r\n_wh[=o]_. A glance at Ben Jonson's English Grammar is worth more than\r\nall theorizing. Mr. White thinks it probable that Shakspeare understood\r\nFrench, Latin, and Italian, but not--English!\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that, however forms of spelling varied, (as they must\r\nwhere both writers and printers spelt phonographically,) the forms of\r\ngrammatical construction were as strict then as now. There were some\r\ndifferences of usage, as where two nominatives coupled by a conjunction\r\nseverally governed the verb, and where certain nouns in the plural were\r\njoined with a verb in the singular,--as _dealings, doings, tidings,\r\nodds_, and as is still the case with _news_. It is not impossible that\r\nthe French termination in _esse_ helped to make the confusion. We have\r\nin the opposite way made a plural of _riches_, which was once singular.\r\nSome persons used the strong preterites, and some the weak,--some said\r\n_snew, thew, sew_, and some _snowed, thawed, sowed_. Bishop Latimer\r\nused the preterite _shew_, which Mr. Bartlett, in his \"Dictionary of\r\nAmericanisms,\" pronounces to be the _shibboleth_ of Bostonians. But such\r\ndifferences were orthoepic, and not syntactic.\r\n\r\nWe regret Mr. White's glossological excursions the more because they are\r\nutterly supererogatory, and because they seem to imply a rashness of\r\nconclusion which can very seldom be laid to his charge as respects the\r\ntext. He volunteers, without the least occasion for it, an opinion that\r\n_abye_ and _abide_ are the same word, (which they are not,) suggests\r\nthat _vile_ and _vild_ (whose etymology, he says, is obscure) may\r\nbe related to the Anglo-Saxon _hyldan_, and tells us that _dom_ is\r\nAnglo-Saxon for house. He pronounces _ex cathedrâ_ that _besides_ is\r\nonly a vulgar form of _beside_, though the question is still _sub\r\njudice_, and though the language has contrived adverbial and\r\nprepositional forms out of the distinction, as it has, in the case of\r\nthe compounds with _ward_ and _wards_, adverbial and adjectival ones.[J]\r\nHe declares that the distinction between _shall_ and _will_ was\r\nimperfectly known in Shakspeare's time, though we believe it would not\r\nbe difficult to prove that the distinction was more perfect in some\r\nrespects than now. We the less value his opinion on these points as he\r\nhimself shows an incomplete perception of the difference between _would_\r\nand _should_. (See Vol. V. pp. 114, 115, \"We _would_ now say, 'all\r\nliveliness,'\" and \"We _would_ now write, 'the traits of,'\" etc.) He says\r\nthat the pronunciation _commandèment_ was already going out of use two\r\ncenturies and a half ago. Mr. Pegge speaks of it as a common Cockneyism\r\nat the beginning of this century. Sometimes this hastiness, however,\r\naffects the value of an elucidatory note, as where he tells us that a\r\nprincipality is \"an angel of the highest rank next to divinity\" [deity],\r\nand quotes St. Paul, breaking off the passage at the word in question.\r\nBut St. Paul goes on to say _powers_,--and there were, in fact, three\r\norders of angels above the principalities, the highest being the\r\nSeraphim. An editor should be silent or correct, especially where there\r\nis no need of saying anything.\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: It is singular, if the _s_ be a corruption, that the\r\nGermans should have fallen into the same in their _vorwärts_ and\r\n_rückwärts_. We are inclined to conjecture the _s_ a genitival one,\r\nsupplying the place of a missing _of_ and _von_ respectively. We\r\nformerly said, \"of this side,\" \"of that side,\" etc.; but the idiomatic\r\nsense of _of_ is so entirely lost, that Mr. Craik (_English of\r\nShakspeare_) actually supposes _o'clock_ and _o'nights_ to be\r\ncontractions of \"_on_ the clock,\" \"_on_ nights,\" and that, although we\r\nstill say habitually, \"_of_ late,\" \"_of_ old.\" The French use of _de_,\r\nand the Italian of _di_, is parallel. The Italians have also their\r\n_avanti_ and _davante_, and no one forgets Dante's\r\n\r\n  \"Di quà, di là, di su, dí giù, gli mena.\"\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut it is after Mr. White has been bitten by the _oestrum_ of\r\nShakspearian pronunciation that he becomes thoroughly contradictory of\r\nhimself, especially after he has taken up the notion that \"Much Ado\r\nabout Nothing\" is \"Much Ado about Noting,\" and that the _th_ was\r\nnot sounded in the England of Shakspeare. After that, his theory of\r\nrhetorical variety seems to become that of Geoffroy, \"_dire, redire, et\r\nse contredire_.\" First he tells us, (Vol. II. p. 94,) that \"the old form\r\n'murther' should be retained because it is etymologically correct, and\r\nbecause it was the uniform orthography of the day, [a hasty assumption,]\r\n_and the word was pronounced in accordance with it_.\" Next, (in order to\r\nsustain his anti-_th_ theory,) he says, (Vol. III. p. 227,) that \"the\r\nlast syllable of 'murder,' then written _mur_th_er_, _seems to have been\r\npronounced somewhat like the same syllable_ of the French _meurtre_.\"\r\nHe assures us (Vol. III. p. 340) that _raisin_ was pronounced as we now\r\npronounce _reason_, and adds, \"The custom has not entirely passed\r\naway.\" Certainly not, as any one who knows Thackeray's \"Mulligan of\r\nBallymulligan\" is aware. But Mr. White (having forgotten for a moment\r\nhis conclusion that _swears_ was anciently _sweers_) quotes (Vol. V. pp.\r\n399-400) from the \"Haven of Health\" as follows:--\"Among us in England\r\nthey be of two sorts, that is to say, great _Raysons_ and small\r\n_Raysons_\" (the Italics are our own). In \"Love's Labor's Lost,\" he\r\nspells Biron _Birone_, (Chapman spelt it _Byron_,) as being nearer the\r\nsupposed pronunciation of Shakspeare's day; but finding it rhyming with\r\n_moon_, he is obliged also to assume that _moon_ was called _mown_, and\r\nis severe on Mr. Fox for saying _Touloon_. He forgets that we have other\r\nwords of the same termination in English for whose pronunciation Mr. Fox\r\ndid not set the fashion. The French termination _on_ became _oon_ in\r\n_bassoon, pontoon, balloon, galloon, spontoon, raccoon_, (Fr. _raton_,)\r\n_Quiberoon, Cape Bretoon_, without any help from Mr. Fox. So also\r\n_croon_ from (Fr.) _carogne_,--of which Dr. Richardson (following\r\nJamieson) gives a false etymology. The occurrence of _pontoon_ in\r\nBlount's \"Glossographia,\" published before Mr. Fox was born, shows the\r\ntendency of the language.[K] Or did Mr. Fox invent the word _boon_?\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: Let us remark, in passing, that the spellings \"Berowne,\"\r\n\"Petruchio,\" and \"Borachio\" are strong indications that the manuscript\r\ncopies of the plays in which they occur were dictated to an amanuensis.]\r\n\r\nThe pronunciation of words in Shakspeare's time is a matter of no\r\nparticular consequence, except that it may be made the basis of\r\nconjectural emendation. This consideration gives the question some\r\nimportance, and, as error is one of those plants which propagate\r\nthemselves from the root, it is well to attempt its thorough eradication\r\nat the outset.\r\n\r\nAutolycus sings,--\r\n\r\n  \"If tinkers may have leave to live,\r\n    And bear the sow-skin _bowget_;\r\n\r\n  Then my account I well may give,\r\n    And in the stocks _avouch it_.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this Mr. White has the following note:--\r\n\r\n\"'The sow-skin bowget':--i.e. budget; the change of orthography being\r\nmade for the sake of the rhyme; about which our early writers, contrary\r\nto the received opinion, were very particular. Even Ben Jonson, scholar\r\nand grammarian as he was, did not hesitate to make radical changes in\r\northography to obtain a perfect, in place of an imperfect rhyme. The\r\nfact is important in the history of our language.\" (Vol. V. pp. 398-9.)\r\n\r\nReaders of our older literature are familiar with what the early writers\r\nof treatises on poetry say upon this subject, concerning which, under\r\nthe head of _licentia poetica_, they give some rather minute directions.\r\nBut we think Mr. White's expression \"_radical_ changes\" a little strong.\r\nThe insurmountable difficulty, however, in the way of forming a decided\r\njudgment, is plain at the first glance. You have not, as Dr. Kitchener\r\nwould say, caught your hare; you have no standard. _Quis custodiet ipsos\r\ncustodes_? How shall you determine how your first word is pronounced?\r\nand which of two rhyming words shall dominate the other? In the present\r\ninstance how do we know that _avouch_ was sounded as it is now? Its\r\nbeing from the French would lead us to doubt it. And how do we know that\r\n_bowget_ was not pronounced _boodget_, as it would be, according to Mr.\r\nWhite, if spelt _budget_? Bishop Hall makes _fool_ rhyme with _cowl_.\r\nThat _ou_ was sometimes pronounced _oo_ is certain. Gill (of whom\r\n_infra_) says that the _Boreales_ pronounced _wound, waund_, and _gown,\r\ngaun_ or _geaun_.\r\n\r\nMr. White supposes that _ea_ was sounded like _ee_. We are inclined to\r\nquestion it, and to think that here again the French element in our\r\nlanguage has made confusion. It is certain that _ea_ represents in many\r\nwords the French _e_ and _ai_,--as in _measure_ and _pleasure_. The\r\nIrish, who were taught English by Anglo-Normans, persist in giving\r\nthe _ea_ its original sound (as _baste_ for _beast_); and we Northern\r\nYankees need not go five miles in any direction to hear _maysure_ and\r\n_playsure_. How long did this pronunciation last in England? to how\r\nmany words did it extend? and did it infect any of Saxon root? It\r\nis impossible to say. Was _beat_ called _bate_? One of Mr. White's\r\nvariations from the Folio is \"bull-baiting\" for \"bold-beating.\" The\r\nmistake could have arisen only from the identity in sound of the _ea_\r\nin the one with _ai_ in the other. Butler, too, rhymes _drum-beat_ with\r\n_combat_. But _beat_ is from the French. When we find _least_, (Saxon,)\r\nthen, rhyming with _feast_, (French,) and also with _best_, (Shakspeare\r\nhas _beast_ and _blest_,) which is more probable, that _best_ took the\r\nsound of _beest_, or that we have a slightly imperfect rhyme, with the\r\n[=a] somewhat shorter in one word than the other? We think the latter.\r\nOne of the very words adduced by Mr. White (_yeasty_) is spelt _yesty_\r\nin the Folio. But will rhymes help us? Let us see. Sir Thomas Wyat\r\nrhymes _heares_ and _hairs_; Sir Walter Raleigh, _teares_ and\r\n_despairs_; Chapman, _tear_ (verb) with _ear_ and _appear_; Shakspeare,\r\n_ear_ with _hair_ and _fear_, _tears_ with _hairs_, and _sea_ with\r\n_play_; Bishop Hall, _years_ with _rehearse_ and _expires_, and _meales_\r\nwith _quailes_. Will Mr. White decide how the _ea_ was sounded? We think\r\nthe stronger case is made out for the [=a] than for the _ee_,--for\r\n_swears_ as we now pronounce it, than for _sweers_; though we fear our\r\ntired readers may be tempted to perform the ceremony implied by the verb\r\nwithout much regard to its orthoëpy.\r\n\r\nMr. White tells us that _on_ and _one_ were pronounced alike, because\r\nSpeed puns upon their assonance. He inclines to the opinion that _o_ had\r\ncommonly the long sound, as in _tone_, and supposes both words to have\r\nbeen pronounced like _own_. But was absolute identity in sound ever\r\nnecessary to a pun, especially in those simpler and happier days?\r\nPuttenham, in his \"English Poesy,\" gives as a specimen of the art in\r\nthose days a play upon the words _lubber_ and _lover_, appreciable\r\nnow only by Ethiopian minstrels, but interesting as showing that the\r\ntendency of _b_ and _v_ to run together was more sensible then than\r\nnow.[L] But Shakspeare unfortunately rhymes _on_ with _man_, in which\r\ncase we must either give the one word the Scotch pronunciation of _mon_,\r\nor Hibernicize the other into _ahn_. So we find _son_, which according\r\nto Mr. White would be pronounced _sone_, coquetting with _sun_; and Dr.\r\nDonne, who ought to have called himself Doane, was ignorant enough to\r\nremain all his life Dr. Dunn. But the fact is, that rhymes are no safe\r\nguides, for they were not so perfect as Mr. White would have us believe.\r\nShakspeare rhymed _broken_ with _open_, _sentinel_ with _kill_, and\r\n_downs_ with _hounds_,--to go no farther. Did he, (dreadful thought!) in\r\nthat imperfect rhyme of _leap_ and _swept_, (_Merry Wives_,) call the\r\nformer _lape_ and the latter (_Yankicè_) _swep'_? This would jump with\r\nMr. White's often-recurring suggestion of the Elizabethanism of our\r\nprovincial dialect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: Everybody remembers how Scaliger illustrated it in the case\r\nof the Gascons,--_Felices, quibus vivere est bibere_.]\r\n\r\nMr. White speaks of the vowels as having had their \"pure sound\" in the\r\nElizabethan age. We are not sure if we understand him rightly; but have\r\nthey lost it? We English have the same vowel-sounds with other nations,\r\nbut indicate them by different signs. Slight changes in orthoëpy we\r\ncannot account for, except by pleading the general issue of custom. Why\r\nshould _foot_ and _boot_ be sounded differently? Why _food_ and _good_?\r\nWhy should the Yankee mark the distinction between the two former words,\r\nand blur it in the case of the latter, thereby incurring the awful\r\ndispleasure of the \"Autocrat,\" who trusses him, falcon-like, before his\r\nmillion readers and adorers? Why should the Frenchman call his wooden\r\nshoe a _sabot_ and his old shoe a _savate_, both from the same root?\r\nAlas, we must too often in philology take Rabelais's reason for Friar\r\nJohn's nose! With regard to the pronunciation of the vowels in Queen\r\nBess's days, so much is probable,--that the _a_ in words from the French\r\nhad more of the _ah_ sound than now, if rhymes may be trusted. We find\r\n_placed_ rhyming with _past_; we find the participle _saft_ formed\r\nfrom _save_. One relic of this occurs to us as still surviving in\r\nthat _slang_ which preserves for us so many glossologic\r\ntreasures,--_chauffer_,--_to chafe_, (in the sense of angering,)--_to\r\nchaff_. The same is true of our Yankee _ch[)a]mber, d[)a]nger_, and\r\n_m[)a]nger_, cited by Mr. White.\r\n\r\nIf we have apprehended the bearing of Mr. White's quotation from\r\nButler's English Grammar, we think he has misapprehended Butler. We wish\r\nhe had not broken the extract off so short, with an _etc_. What did\r\nButler mean by \"_oo_ short\"? Mr. White draws the inference that _Puck_\r\nwas called _Pook_, and that, since it was made to rhyme with _luck_,\r\nthat word and \"all of similar orthography\" were pronounced with an _oo_.\r\nDid our ancestors have no short _u_, answering somewhat to the sound of\r\nthat vowel in the French _un_? We have little doubt of it; and since Mr.\r\nWhite repeats so often that we Yankees have retained the Elizabethan\r\nwords and sounds, may we not claim their pronunciation of _put_ (like\r\n_but_) and _sut_ for _soot_, as relics of it? If they had it not, how\r\nsoon did it come into the language? Already we find Lord Herbert of\r\nCherbury using _pundonnore_, (_point d'honneur_,) which may supply Dr.\r\nRichardson with the link he wants between _pun_ and _point_, for the\r\nnext edition of his Dictionary. Alexander Gill, head-master of St.\r\nPaul's School and Milton's teacher, published his \"Logonomia Anglica\" in\r\n1621, a book which throws more light on the contemporary pronunciation\r\nof English than any other we know of. He makes three forms of _u_:\r\nthe _tenuis_, as in _use_,--the _crassa brevis_, as in _us_,--and the\r\n_longa_, as in _ooze_. The Saxons had, doubtless, two sounds of _oo_,\r\na long and a short; and the Normans brought them a third in the French\r\nliquid _u_, if they had it not before. We say _if_, because their organs\r\nhave boggled so at the sound in certain combinations, ending in such\r\nwine-thick success as _piktcher, portraitcher_.\r\n\r\n  \"On earth's green _cinkcher_ fell a heavy _Jew_!\"\r\n\r\nThat the _u_ had formerly, in many cases, the sound attributed to it by\r\nMr. White, we have no question; that it had that sound when Shakspeare\r\nwrote \"Midsummer Night's Dream,\" and in such words as _luck_, is not so\r\nclear to us. We suspect that form of it was already retreating into the\r\nprovincial dialects, where it still survives.\r\n\r\nAnother of Mr. White's theories is that _moon_ was pronounced _mown_.\r\nPerhaps it was; but, if so, it is singular that this pronunciation\r\nis not found in any dialect of our language where almost every other\r\narchaism is caught skulking. And why was it spelt _moon_? When did\r\n_soon_ and _spoon_ take their present form and sound? That _oo_ was not\r\nsounded like _o_ long is certain from Webbe's saying, that, to make\r\n_poore_ and _doore_ rhyme with _more_, they must be written _pore_ and\r\n_dore_. Mr. White says also that _shrew_ was pronounced _shrow_, and\r\ncites as parallel cases _sew_ and _shew_. If New England authority be\r\nworth anything, we have the old sound here in the pronunciation _soo_,\r\nonce universal, and according both with Saxon and Latin analogy.\r\nMoreover, Bishop Hall rhymes _shew_ with _mew_ and _sue_; so that it\r\nwill not do to be positive.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the theory on which Mr. White lays the greatest stress,\r\nand for being the first to broach which he even claims credit. That\r\ncredit we frankly concede him, and we shall discuss the point more fully\r\nbecause there is definite and positive evidence about it, and because\r\nwe think we shall be able to convince even Mr. White himself that he is\r\nwrong. This theory is, that the _th_ was sounded like _t_ in the\r\nword _nothing_, and in various other words, at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century. This certainly seems an unaccountable anomaly at\r\nvery first sight; for we know that two sounds of _th_ existed before\r\nthat period, and exist now. What singular frost was it that froze the\r\nsound in a few words for a few years and left it fluent in all others?\r\n\r\nSchoolmaster Gill, in his \"Logonomia,\" already referred to, gives an\r\ninteresting and curious reason for the loss from our alphabet of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon signs for the grave and acute _th_. He attributes it to the\r\nfact, that, when Henry VII. invited Wynken de Word over from Germany\r\nto print for the first time in English, the foreign fount of types was\r\nnecessarily wanting in signs to express those Saxon sounds. Accordingly,\r\nthe form _th_ was required to stand for both. For the Germans, he says,\r\ncall _thing, Ding_, and _father, Vater_.[M] In his alphabet he gives\r\n_though_ and _thistle_ as expressing the two sounds, which is precisely\r\nconsonant with present usage. On page 152, speaking of the difficulties\r\nof English pronunciation to a foreigner, he says, \"Etenim si has quinque\r\nvoculas, _What think the chosen judges_? quid censent electi judices?\r\nrectè protuleris, omnem loquendi difficultatem superâsti.\" Ben Jonson in\r\nhis Grammar gives similar examples, and speaks also of the loss of the\r\nSaxon signs as having made a confusion. It is certain, then, at least,\r\nthat Shakspeare did not pronounce _thing, ting_,--or, if he did, that\r\nothers did not, as we shall presently show.\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: Praefatio, p. 6. We abridge his statement.]\r\n\r\nMost of Mr. White's arguments in support of his opinion are theoretic;\r\nthe examples by which he endeavors to sustain it tell, with one\r\nexception, against him. That exception is his quoting from one of\r\nShakspeare's sonnets the rhyme _doting_ and _nothing_. But this proves\r\nnothing (noting?); for we have already shown that Shakspeare, like all\r\nhis contemporaries, was often content with assonance, where identity\r\ncould not be had, in rhyming. Generally, indeed, the argument from\r\nrhymes is like that of the Irishman who insisted that _full_ must be\r\npronounced like _dull_, because he found it rhyming with _b[)u]ll_. Mr.\r\nWhite also brings forward the fact, that _moth_ is spelt _mote_, and\r\nargues therefrom that the name of the Page Moth has hitherto been\r\nmisconceived. But how many _th_ sounds does he mean to rob us of? And\r\nhow was _moth_ really pronounced? Ben Jonson rhymes it with _sloth_ and\r\n_cloth_; Herrick, with _cloth_. Alexander Gill tells us (p. 16) that it\r\nwas a Northern provincialism to pronounce _cloth_ long (like _both_),\r\nand accordingly we are safe in believing that _moth_ was pronounced\r\nprecisely as it is now. Mr. White again endeavors to find support in the\r\nfact that _Armado_ and _renegado_ are spelt _Armatho_ and _renegatho_\r\nin the Folio. Of course they were, (just as the Italian _Petruccio_ and\r\n_Boraccio_ are spelt _Petruchio_ and _Borachio_,) because, being\r\nSpanish words, they were so pronounced. His argument from the frequent\r\nsubstitution of _had_ for _hath_ is equally inconclusive, because we\r\nmay either suppose it a misprint, or, as is possible, a mistake of the\r\nprinter for the Anglo-Saxon sign for _th_, which, as many contractions\r\ncertainly did, may have survived in writing long after it was banished\r\nfrom print, and which would be easily confounded with _d_. Can Mr.\r\nWhite find an example of _dod_ for _doth_, where the word could not be\r\ndoubtful to the compositor? The inability of foreigners to pronounce the\r\n_th_ was often made a source of fun on the stage. Puttenham speaks of\r\n_dousand_ for _thousand_ as a vulgarism. Shakspeare himself makes Caius\r\nsay _dat_, and \"by my _trot_\"; and in Marston's \"Dutch Courtezan,\" (Act\r\nii. Sc. 1,) we find Francischina, (a Dutch woman,) saying, \"You have\r\nbrought mine love, mine honor, mine body, all to _noting_!\"--to which\r\nher interlocutrix answers, \"To nothing!\" It is plain that Marston did\r\nnot harden his _th_s into _t_s, nor suppose that his audience were in\r\nthe habit of doing so. How did Ben Jonson pronounce the word? He shall\r\nanswer for himself (_Vision of Delight_).--\r\n\r\n  \"Some that are proper find signify o'thing,\r\n  And some another, and some that are _nothing_.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps he pronounced _thing, ting_? If _he_ did, Herrick as surely\r\ndid not, for he has\r\n\r\n  \"Maides should say, or virgins sing,\r\n  Herrick keeps, as holds, _nothing_,\"\r\n\r\nwhere the accent divides the word into its original elements, and where\r\nit is out of the question that he should lay the emphasis on a bit of\r\nbroken English. As to the _h_s which Mr. White adduces in such names as\r\n_Anthony_ and such words as _authority_, they have no bearing on the\r\nquestion, for those words are not English, and the _h_ in them is\r\nperhaps only a trace of that tendency in _t_ to soften itself before\r\ncertain vowels and before _r_, as _d_ also does, with a slight sound of\r\n_theta_, especially on the thick tongues of foreigners. Shakspeare makes\r\nFluellen say _athversary_; and the Latin _t_ was corrupted first to _d_\r\nand then to _dth_ in Spanish. The _h_ here has not so much meaning as\r\nthe _h_ which has crept into _Bosporus_, for that is only the common\r\nchange of _p_ to _f_, corresponding to _v_ for _b_. So when Mr. White\r\nreads _annotanize_ rather than _anatomize_, because the Folio has\r\n_annothanize_, we might point him to Minsheu's \"Spanish Dictionary,\"\r\nwhere, in the earlier editions, we find _anathomia_. In _lanthorn_,\r\nanother word adduced by Mr. White, the _h_ is a vulgarism of spelling\r\nintroduced to give meaning to a foreign word, the termination being\r\nsupposed to be derived from the material (horn) of which lanterns were\r\nformerly made,--like _Bully Ruffian_ for _Bellerophon_ in our time, and\r\n_Sir Piers Morgan_ for _Primaguet_ three centuries ago. As for _t'one_\r\nand _t'other_, they should be _'tone_ and _'tother_, being elisions\r\nfor _that one_ and _that other_, relics of the Anglo-Saxon declinable\r\ndefinite article, still used in Frisic.\r\n\r\nWe have been minute in criticizing this part of Mr. White's notes,\r\nbecause we think his investigations misdirected, the results at which he\r\narrives mistaken, and because we hope to persuade him to keep a tighter\r\nrein on his philological zeal in future. Even could he show what the\r\npronunciation of Shakspeare's day was, it is idle to encumber his\r\nedition with such disquisitions, for we shall not find Shakspeare\r\nclearer for not reading him in his and our mother-tongue. The field of\r\nphilology is famous for its mare's-nests; and, if imaginary eggs are\r\nworth little, is it worth while brooding on imaginary chalk ones,\r\nnest-eggs of delusion?\r\n\r\nLife is short and Shakspeare long. We believe the pronunciation of\r\nShakspeare's day to have been so qualified with perfectly understood\r\nprovincialisms as to have allowed puns and rhymes impossible now. It is\r\nnot eighty years since you could tell the county[N] of every country\r\nmember of Parliament by his speech. Speculations like Mr. White's would\r\nbe better placed in a monograph by themselves. We have subjected his\r\nvolumes to a laborious examination such as few books receive, because\r\nthe text of Shakspeare is a matter of common and great concern, and\r\nthey have borne the trial, except in these few impertinent particulars,\r\nadmirably. Mr. Dyce and Mr. Singer are only dry commonplace-books of\r\nillustrative quotations; Mr. Collier has not wholly recovered from his\r\n\"Corr. fo.\"-madness; Mr. Knight (with many eminent advantages as an\r\neditor) is too diffuse; and we repeat our honest persuasion, that Mr.\r\nWhite has thus far given us the best extant text, while the fulness of\r\nhis notes gives his edition almost the value of a _variorum_. We shall\r\nlook with great interest for his succeeding volumes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: Mr. White is mistaken in thinking that to say \"my country\"\r\nfor \"my county\" was a peculiarity of Shallow. It was common in the last\r\ncentury in England. He is wrong also in thinking that he was restoring a\r\ncharacteristic vulgarism in _aleven_. Gabriel Harvey uses it, and says\r\nthere is no difference in sound between that and _a leaven_.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the introductory part of this article, we said that it was doubtful\r\nif Shakspeare had any conscious moral intention in his writings. We\r\nmeant only that he was purely and primarily poet. And while he was\r\nan English poet in a sense that is true of no other, his method was\r\nthoroughly Greek, yet with this remarkable difference,--that, while the\r\nGreek dramatists took purely national themes and gave them a universal\r\ninterest by their mode of treatment, he took what may be called\r\ncosmopolitan traditions, legends of human nature, and nationalized them,\r\nby the infusion of his perfectly Anglican breadth of character and\r\nsolidity of understanding. Wonderful as his imagination and fancy are,\r\nhis perspicacity and artistic discretion are more so. This country\r\ntradesman's son, coming up to London, could set high-bred wits, like\r\nBeaumont, uncopiable lessons in drawing gentlemen such as are seen\r\nnowhere else but on the canvas of Titian; he could take Ulysses away\r\nfrom Homer and expand the shrewd and crafty islander into a statesman\r\nwhose words are the pith of history. But what makes him yet more\r\nexceptional was his utterly unimpeachable judgment, and that poise of\r\ncharacter which enabled him to be at once the greatest of poets and so\r\nunnoticeable a good citizen as to leave no incidents for biography. His\r\nmaterial was never far-sought; (it is still disputed whether the fullest\r\nhead of which we have record were cultivated beyond the range of\r\ngrammar-school precedent!) but he used it with a poetic instinct which\r\nwe cannot parallel, identified himself with it, yet remained always its\r\nborn and question-less master. He finds the Clown and Fool upon the\r\nstage,--he makes them the tools of his pleasantry, his satire, and even\r\nhis pathos; he finds a fading rustic superstition, and shapes out of\r\nit ideal Pucks, Titanias, and Ariels, in whose existence statesmen and\r\nscholars believe forever. Always poet, he subjects all to the ends\r\nof his art, and gives in Hamlet the churchyard-ghost, but with the\r\ncothurnus on,--the messenger of God's revenge against murder; always\r\nphilosopher, he traces in Macbeth the metaphysics of apparitions,\r\npainting the shadowy Banquo only on the o'erwrought brain of the\r\nmurderer, and staining the hand of his wife-accomplice (because she was\r\nthe more refined and higher nature) with the disgustful blood-spot that\r\nis not there. We say he had no moral intention, for the reason, that,\r\nas artist, it was not his to deal with the realities, but only with\r\nthe shows of things; yet, with a temperament so just, an insight so\r\ninevitable as his, it was impossible that the moral reality, which\r\nunderlies the _mirage_ of the poet's vision, should not always be\r\nsuggested. His humor and satire are never of the destructive kind; what\r\nhe does in that way is suggestive only,--not breaking bubbles with\r\nThor's hammer, but puffing them away with the breath of a Clown, or\r\nshivering them with the light laugh of a genial cynic. Men go about to\r\nprove the existence of a God! Was it a bit of phosphorus, that brain\r\nwhose creations are so real, that, mixing with them, we feel as if we\r\nourselves were but fleeting magic-lantern shadows?\r\n\r\nBut higher even than the genius, we rate the character of this unique\r\nman, and the grand impersonality of what he wrote. What has he told\r\nus of himself? In our self-exploiting nineteenth century, with its\r\nmelancholy liver-complaint, how serene and high he seems! If he had\r\nsorrows, he has made them the woof of everlasting consolation to his\r\nkind; and if, as poets are wont to whine, the outward world was cold\r\nto him, its biting air did but trace itself in loveliest frost-work of\r\nfancy on the many windows of that self-centred and cheerful soul.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\nFor the Quarter ending December 31, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife in a Risen Saviour.
