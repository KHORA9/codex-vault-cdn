The\r\nCommittee of the Eighty Club requested me some few months ago to undertake\r\nthe preparation of a book dealing with the Irish question. They did me the\r\nhonour of leaving entirely to my discretion both the design of the work\r\nand the choice of the contributors. Of books about Ireland, particularly\r\nof those which wear the livery of political parties, there are enough and\r\nto spare. Most of them are retrospective. I am not insensible to the value\r\nof a historical argument—as the design of the second part of this book\r\nsufficiently attests—but “few indeed,” as Burke has remarked, “are the\r\npartisans of departed tyranny,” and it seemed to me more profitable to pay\r\nsome attention to the present and the future. The restoration to Ireland\r\nof her Parliament is an event which not only appeals to the imagination of\r\nthe historian, but also stimulates the speculation of the jurist, and\r\ninvites the assistance of the administrator. I have, therefore, attempted\r\nin the earlier part of this book to secure a sober and dispassionate study\r\nof the new order of government by writers who can speak with the authority\r\nof a life’s vocation. Their names need no commendation from me.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the book may be regarded as supplementary to the first,\r\nin that it deals with constitutional history. When public men of such\r\ndistinction as Mr. Balfour can speak of Irish patriotism, in so far as it\r\nused a Parliamentary vocabulary, as an exotic, and Irish nationality as a\r\npolitical afterthought, it seems not unimportant to show, as Mrs. J. R.\r\nGreen and Professor Pollard have here shown, that the title-deeds of that\r\nnationality are not the forgeries of a political scriptorium, but are as\r\nauthentic as anything an Englishman can boast. No one who has served any\r\napprenticeship to Irish history needs to be reminded of the indomitable\r\ncharm with which Irishmen have always taken captivity captive, and\r\nnaturalised the alien and the oppressor. No argument for Irish nationality\r\nis more potent than this. One may, if one is so perverse, think Bolton\r\npedantic, Molyneux curious, Swift rhetorical, and Grattan forensic, but\r\nthere is no denying that these Anglo-Irish champions of Irish nationality\r\nspoke with a truly native passion. Nor is it a little remarkable that at\r\nthe eleventh hour history should have repeated itself, and that the heart\r\nof the ruling caste should have throbbed, as Lord Dunraven has shown in\r\nhis remarkable chapter, with a new impulse toward self-government.\r\nGrattan’s Parliament, as one may read in Mr. Gooch’s essay, was composed\r\nof men of much the same antecedents and prestige as those who are\r\nassociated with Lord Dunraven in that significant movement of Irish\r\nUnionism which has to-day met Nationalism half-way. That Parliament is\r\nabout to be restored to Ireland under conditions, which, as Lord\r\nFitzmaurice shows, are, allowing for the difference in time and in the\r\ncategories of political thought, substantially those which the Rockingham\r\nMinistry would, had they been free agents, have imposed in 1782. Their\r\nimposition would have precluded the union, and we should have been saved\r\nthat sorry story, to be read in Mr. Barry O’Brien’s succinct pages, of\r\nconcessions delayed until they had lost their grace, and promises redeemed\r\nwhen they had lost their virtue.\r\n\r\nMuch of these historical chapters is but melancholy reading. But it is for\r\nEnglishmen to remember these things, as it will be, I hope and pray, for\r\nIrishmen to forget them.\r\n\r\nThe third part of the book comes nearer home. At a time when our\r\nfellow-subjects across the oceans are repudiating, as Irishmen have\r\nrepudiated, the name of “colonists,” with all its suggestions of the\r\ndependent tenure of Roman law, and are claiming, as Irishmen long ago\r\nclaimed, the status of a “dominion,” it does not lie with Englishmen,\r\nleast of all of the Imperialist school, to challenge the claims of the\r\nIrishmen of to-day to nationality. Professor Hobhouse reminds us that\r\nwhere this stubborn non-conformity to the ruling order endures, it must be\r\naccepted as the touchstone of nationalism. But the Irish demands are\r\nreinforced by English exigencies, and, as three Liberal Members of\r\nParliament remind us, the Imperial Legislature is already disintegrating\r\ndomestically under the stress of its manifold burdens. Not for the first\r\ntime is the path of justice thus discovered to be also the path of\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\nIn the later chapters of this book will be found a view of the present\r\nstate of Ireland, from the pens of those best qualified to speak of it,\r\nthe pens of men who have spent their lives in ministering to her people. I\r\nwould commend to the attention of the reader those chapters, in which a\r\ngreat dignitary of the Roman Church, a distinguished scholar of the Church\r\nof Ireland, and two members of Nonconformist bodies, who stand high in\r\ntheir respective communions, pray for the deliverance of the social life\r\nof their country from the obsession of a busy and alien fanaticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dea magna, dea Cybelle, dea domina Dindymi,\r\n    Procul a mea tuus sit furor omnis, era, domo:\r\n    Alios age incitatos, alios age rabidos.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the responsibility for each chapter is confined\r\nto the person who wrote it. We are all united in a common allegiance to\r\nthe principles of Home Rule, but that allegiance is not incompatible with\r\nsome diversity of view as to the form which it should take. It seems to me\r\nthat the book gains, rather than loses, in value by this degree of\r\nlatitude of opinion. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to add that the\r\norder in which the chapters appear makes no pretence to anything so\r\ninvidious as an order of merit—otherwise the first chapter would have been\r\nthe last; it is designed simply with a view to a logical sequence.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nI wish to thank Lord Haldane and Mr. Birrell for the enjoyment of certain\r\nprivileges in the preparation of the book, without the concession of which\r\nits appearance at this moment would have been impossible. I have also to\r\nthank Lord Haldane for reading the proofs of my own chapter on the\r\nGovernment of Ireland Bill, and giving me the benefit of that profound\r\nlearning which is always so generously placed at the service of the\r\nstudent who seeks its guidance. To my friends, Lord Fitzmaurice, Mrs. J.\r\nR. Green, and Mr. J. A. Spender, I am indebted for many kind offices of a\r\ndiplomatic character. Throughout the conduct of my editorial task I have\r\nhad the wise counsel and unfailing support of Mr. Bourchier Hawksley, the\r\nChairman of the Home Rule Committee of the Eighty Club, and to him I\r\ndesire to express my grateful acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nJ. H. MORGAN.\r\nThe Temple.\r\n_May, 1912._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I. THE NEW CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.—The Constitution: A Commentary. BY PROFESSOR J. H. MORGAN\r\n\r\n\r\n“Home Rule is at bottom Federalism,” we are told(1) by the most\r\ndistinguished jurist among its opponents. It is urged against it that\r\nFederal Governments are almost invariably weak Governments, and that, in\r\nso far as they are strong, they are as “symmetrical” as the new\r\nconstitution is unsymmetrical. Cornewall Lewis once thought it necessary\r\nto write a book on the Use and Abuse of Political Terms, and there is a\r\ngreat danger in the present controversy of our being enslaved by the\r\npoverty of our political vocabulary. The term “Federalism” is put to such\r\nnew and alien uses as to darken counsel and confuse thought. That Federal\r\nExecutives are usually weak, that in the dual allegiance of a Federal\r\nsystem men often prefer the State authority which is near to the Federal\r\nauthority which is remote, that the respective limits of Federal and State\r\nlegislation are defined with difficulty and observed with reluctance, that\r\nconflict of laws is more often the rule than the exception, that Federal\r\nconstitutions are rigid rather than flexible, and, in a word, that\r\nprogress is sacrificed to stability: all these things are true, and all\r\nthese things are irrelevant. The Government of Ireland Bill is not, and\r\ncannot be, the corner-stone of a Federal system for the United Kingdom,\r\nalthough its duplication in the case of Scotland and of England would not\r\nbe impossible, should it appear desirable. We may, for want of a better\r\nterm, call it the foundation of a system of Devolution, but we must not\r\ncall it Federalism.\r\n\r\nPutting on one side for the moment the question whether Home Rule is\r\nFederalism or not, I am inclined to enter a protest against all these\r\nattempts to fit the Bill into the categories of the jurist. It is very\r\ndoubtful whether any two constitutions in the world, even federal\r\nconstitutions, can be brought under one species. Two of the most\r\nsuccessful “federal” constitutions present the gravest anomalies to the\r\ntheorist. The Canadian Constitution, according to Professor Dicey, betrays\r\na logical fallacy in the very words of its preamble;(2) and German jurists\r\nhave wrangled no less inconclusively than incessantly about the legal\r\ncharacter of the Empire and as to where its sovereignty resides;(3) yet in\r\nneither case has the practical operation of these constitutions been much\r\nthe worse for the legal solecisms which they present. Indeed, it would not\r\nbe too much to say with Aristotle that the “mixed” and not the “pure” type\r\nof government is the most successful, and that when Federalism is, as in\r\nthe United States, at its purest, it is also at its weakest. The\r\nconstitution of Imperial Germany ought, on this kind of reasoning, to be a\r\nflagrant perversion, and yet it has persisted in enduring for some\r\nforty-one years, and the prestige of its principal organ, the Bundesrath,\r\nalthough violating all Mr. Balfour’s principles as to “equality” in its\r\nconstitution, is, according to the doyen of the constitutional lawyers of\r\nGermany, increasing every day.(4) The argument that “Federalism” is\r\nincompatible with the preponderance of the “predominant partner,” and that\r\nno “federal” union is possible in these islands owing to the superior\r\nposition occupied by England, would, even if it were relevant, be easily\r\nrefuted by the example presented by the hegemony of Prussia.\r\n\r\nThe same objection may be urged against the contention that the grant of\r\nself-government, whether to Ireland alone or to the rest of the United\r\nKingdom, is both reactionary and unprecedented. The progress of all\r\ncivilised communities, we are told, is towards political integration, not\r\naway from it. Devolution, it is said, is gratuitous in the case of a\r\n“United” Kingdom whose very union represents an ideal imperfectly achieved\r\nby the less fortunate countries which have had to be content with\r\nsomething less complete in the form of Federalism. Nations or Colonies\r\nmutually independent federate as a step towards union; it is\r\n“unprecedented” to reverse the process and qualify union by looser ties of\r\ncohesion. Now this attempt “to construct a normal programme for all\r\nportions of mankind”(5) cannot be sustained. If it could, it would avail\r\nas a conclusive argument against the grant of self-government to our\r\nColonies whose claims to legislative independence grow with their growth\r\nand strengthen with their strength.(6) But it is not even true of Federal\r\nUnions. Anyone who takes the trouble to study the history of judicial\r\ninterpretation of the American Constitution will find that there is a\r\nconstant ebb and flow in the current of “unionism.” The intention of the\r\nframers of the 14th Amendment to create a United States citizenship has\r\nbeen largely neutralized by the decisions of the Supreme Court, which have\r\ninclined strongly in the direction of the legislative autonomy of the\r\nStates.(7) Nor is this all. We are told that Federal Constitutions are\r\n“round and perfect and self-contained,”(8)—that they are characterized by\r\n“equality” of all the parts—and that, like the work of the divine\r\nlaw-giver of early communities, they are finished the moment they are\r\nbegun.(9) But these confident inductions cannot be sustained. The history\r\nof the constitution of the United States and of Imperial Germany tells\r\nanother story—a story of ancillary communities and dependencies in various\r\nstages of political apprenticeship. If we look for the American\r\nConstitution where all such constitutions must really be sought, that is\r\nto say not in the original text, but in the commentary of the courts, we\r\nshall find a truly remarkable tendency of late years to emphasize this\r\nheterogeneity, inequality and incompleteness.(10)\r\n\r\nThe new Bill proposes a delegation of authority, both executive and\r\nlegislative. Unlike a Federal constitution, it contemplates no\r\ndistribution of sovereignty (begging a question which has often vexed the\r\njurists as to the partibility of sovereignty). The new Government in\r\nIreland will, indeed, be carried on in the name of the Crown, the writs of\r\nthe Irish Court will run in the King’s name, the statutes of the Irish\r\nParliament will be enacted by the King’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate and Commons. But the Imperial\r\nGovernment and the Imperial Parliament will remain supreme. The executive\r\npower in Ireland will continue vested in His Majesty, though some\r\nprerogatives may be delegated to the Lord-Lieutenant who, as respects\r\nthem, will exist in a dual capacity—some of these he will exercise on the\r\nadvice of the Imperial Government, others on the advice of the Irish\r\nGovernment. So far, however, as the law, as distinguished from convention,\r\nis concerned, he will be in no way bound to act on the advice of his Irish\r\nMinisters except in so far as his “instructions” require him to do so. The\r\nwords of the Bill do, indeed, contemplate with more explicitness than is\r\nusual in our written constitutions, a transfer of executive as well as of\r\nlegislative authority, but they are by no means exhaustive, and they still\r\nleave it to His Majesty to determine(11) what prerogatives shall be\r\ndelegated after the Act has come into force. As regards the legislative\r\npower, it will remain with the Imperial Government to give it effect by\r\ngranting or withholding the King’s assent to Irish legislation,(12) and\r\nthe Imperial Parliament may, at any time, exercise its supremacy to the\r\nprejudice of such legislation, even after it has found its way on to the\r\nIrish statute-book. As regards the judiciary, there will, of course, be no\r\ndual judiciary: Irish Courts will interpret and enforce Imperial as well\r\nas Irish statutes, but both in the one case and in the other their\r\njudgments will be subject to appeal to an Imperial Court—the Judicial\r\nCommittee of the Privy Council. In other words, the Imperial power will be\r\nsupreme in the executive, the legislative, and the judicial sphere.\r\n\r\nNow in Federalism in the true sense—and I regard the constitution of the\r\nUnited States as the archetype—there is no such subordination. The\r\nauthority of the constituent states and of the Federal nation are distinct\r\nand independent of one another. The Governor of the State is appointed not\r\nby the Federal authority, but by the State itself, whose servant he is.\r\nThere is no “Crown” to serve as a common denominator of State and Federal\r\nExecutives.(13) The one is not subordinate to the other, but is\r\nco-ordinate with it. The legislation of the State is subject to no\r\nexternal veto by the President. Nor is it subject to a legislative veto.\r\nIn all matters not expressly conceded to the Federal Legislature, the\r\nState Legislatures remain as supreme after the enactment of the Federal\r\nConstitution as they were before it. In the legislative, as in the\r\nexecutive, sphere, the two authorities are co-ordinate. So with the\r\njudiciary. The decisions of the State Courts, in so far as they deal with\r\nState matters, and do not involve the interpretation of the Federal\r\nConstitution, are final and subject to no appeal to the Supreme Court at\r\nWashington. Conversely, Federal Circuit Courts exist independently of the\r\nState Courts to decide cases arising under Federal statutes or involving\r\nthe interpretation of the Federal Constitution, and their judgments are\r\nenforced not by the State Executive but by the Federal Executive, which\r\nhas its own marshals for the purpose. Nor can an act done by a Federal\r\nofficial, in obedience to a Federal statute, be punished by the State\r\nCourt, even though it appear to involve a breach of a law of the\r\nState.(14)\r\n\r\nIt is this dual allegiance that constitutes the inherent weakness of all\r\nFederal systems. Arguments based upon it have been urged against the grant\r\nof self-government to Ireland. Even those who admit that Federal analogies\r\nhave no application so far as the relations of the Imperial and Irish\r\nlegislatures are concerned, and who concede that the Irish Parliament will\r\nbe as subordinate as a State Parliament in a Federal system is\r\nco-ordinate—none the less insist that in the relation of the two\r\nexecutives there is a real and perilous dualism. Many opponents allege,\r\nand no doubt, believe, that, with an Irish Parliament sitting at Dublin,\r\nthe King’s Writ will not run, the decisions of the Judicial Committee will\r\nnot be enforced. Imperial statutes will not be obeyed, and Imperial taxes\r\nwill not be collected. If there were a real delimitation of Courts and\r\nExecutives, Imperial and Irish, under the new system, such a danger,\r\nthough remote, would be conceivable. But no such sharp distinction is to\r\nbe found in the Bill. In political unions, the central Government may act\r\nupon its subjects in a particular state directly through its own\r\nagencies—its own Courts, its own Executive officers, and its own\r\npolice—this is the true Federal type; or it may act indirectly through the\r\nagency of the State authorities. Conversely, the State Governments may act\r\ndirectly through their own agencies—this again is the Federal principle,\r\nor they may act indirectly through Imperial agencies. Now wherever this\r\nindirect action is employed in both its forms the distinction between the\r\ntwo authorities is confused, the Federal principle undergoes a\r\nqualification which, by depriving it of half its symmetry, deprives it of\r\nall its weakness. Just this reciprocal relationship is established between\r\nthe Imperial Government and the Irish Government.\r\n\r\nImperial officials will be at the service of the Irish Government, and\r\nIrish officials at the service of the Imperial Government. For example, in\r\nthe collection of taxes imposed by the Irish Parliament, the Irish\r\nGovernment will depend upon Imperial revenue officers to assess and\r\ncollect them. The Imperial Government, on the other hand, will depend upon\r\nIrish Courts and Irish sheriffs to enforce their collection. Irish\r\nsheriffs will, in turn, depend upon an Imperial constabulary to assist\r\nthem in levying execution. I shall return to some of these points in\r\ngreater detail when I come to deal with the relations between the\r\nExecutive and the Judiciary, and the maintenance of law and order. It is\r\nsufficient for me to remark here that the Irish Nationalist who wishes to\r\ndefy the Imperial Government, and the Irish Unionist who wishes to defy\r\nthe Irish Government, will each be hard put to define what he is pleased\r\nto regard as the limits of political obligation. He will find it difficult\r\nto distinguish where the authority of the Irish Government ends and that\r\nof the Imperial Government begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supremacy of the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the new Bill the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament is secured by\r\nexpress words. The words are not necessary. No Parliament can bind its\r\nsuccessors, and what one Parliament has done another Parliament may undo.\r\nEven when one Parliament has been at pains, by declaring its legislation\r\n“perpetual” or “unalterable” to bind posterity—as in the case of certain\r\nclauses in the Irish and Scotch Acts of Union—its injunctions have been\r\ndisregarded by its successors with no more formality than is necessary in\r\nthe case of any other legislation. An Act setting up a new Constitution is\r\nno more irrevocable than an Act authorising the imposition of the income\r\ntax. If, therefore, the Imperial Parliament chooses to grant a\r\nConstitution to Ireland, there is nothing to prevent its revoking or\r\namending that grant, even (we submit) though it should have been at pains\r\nto enact that the Constitution could only be surrendered or altered by the\r\nconsent of the Legislature which that Constitution created. Some doubts\r\ndid, indeed, arise as to this point in the case of the Home Rule Bill of\r\n1886, which not only excluded the Irish members from Westminster, but made\r\nprovision for the amendment of the new Constitution by stipulating that\r\nsuch amendment should be made, if at all, by the joint authority of the\r\nIrish and English Parliaments. Whether this would have had the effect of\r\npreventing the “Imperial” Parliament from amending such a Home Rule Act\r\nwithout calling in the assistance of the Irish Parliament was much\r\ndiscussed at the time.(15) Obviously, the question does not now arise, as\r\nthe Irish members are to continue to sit at Westminster.(16)\r\n\r\nIt is therefore open to the Imperial Parliament at any time to repeal or\r\namend the Government of Ireland Bill after it has become law. On the other\r\nhand, the Irish Parliament will have no power, except in so far as such\r\npower is conceded by the Act itself, to alter its provisions. This is\r\nstated in the Bill itself,(17) but the statement is superfluous. It\r\nfollows from the doctrine of the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament that\r\nstatutes of that Parliament can only be repealed by the Parliament itself.\r\nNo constitution granted to a British Colony, however large the grant of\r\nself-government it contains, can be altered by that colony unless the\r\npower to alter it is expressly conceded. Such a power, when the\r\nConstitution itself does not prescribe some particular method of\r\nconstitutional amendment, has indeed been granted in general terms by\r\nSection 5 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, but this Act could not apply\r\nto Ireland, which is outside the legal definition of a colony contained in\r\nthe Interpretation Act of 1889. The only powers of constitutional\r\namendment which the Irish Legislature will possess are those expressly\r\nconceded in Clause 9, which enables it after three years from the passing\r\nof the Act to deal with the franchise and with re-distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Parliament will, of course, have power to repeal any existing\r\nActs of the Imperial Parliament in so far as they relate to Ireland, and\r\ndo not deal with matters exempted from its authority. It would be\r\nimpossible for it to legislate for the peace, order, and good government\r\nof Ireland if it had not this power, and the power is implied in the\r\ngeneral grant. But if the Imperial Parliament chooses to continue to\r\nlegislate for Ireland, even in matters in regard to which the Irish\r\nParliament has been empowered to legislate, such Imperial legislation will\r\nbe of superior obligation. This is also a corollary of the doctrine of the\r\nsupremacy of Parliament, and it was not necessary to state it in the\r\nBill.(18) The grant of particular legislative powers to Ireland does not\r\nprevent the Imperial Parliament from subsequently legislating in\r\nderogation of those powers. The supremacy of the Imperial Parliament is as\r\ninexhaustible as the fountain of honour.\r\n\r\nIt is just here that the divergence from Federal principles is most\r\nmarked. Under the British North America Act the legislative powers of the\r\nprovinces are “exclusive” of Dominion legislation within their own\r\nsphere.(19) So, too, in the case of the Australian Constitution, under\r\nwhich the residuary legislative powers remain with the States, the Federal\r\nParliament is excluded from legislating in any matters not expressly\r\nconceded to it. The result is seriously to limit the operations of such\r\npowers as it does possess. It has, for example, over Customs and Excise,\r\nbut there are other ways of giving a preference to a trade than by the\r\nimposition of duties: a low standard of factory legislation may operate in\r\nthe same direction, as the Federal Parliament found to its cost when it\r\nattempted to pass an Excise Tariff Act, depriving manufacturers of the\r\nadvantages of the new tariff in those States in which a certain industrial\r\nminimum was not observed. The Act was held invalid by the High Court(20)\r\non the ground that it exceeded the powers conferred on the Federal\r\nParliament by the Constitution, and encroached on the exclusive powers of\r\nindustrial legislation which belonged to the States. No such situation\r\nwould be possible under the Government of Ireland Act, because the powers\r\nof the Irish Legislature are not exclusive of the powers of the Imperial\r\nParliament, but merely concurrent. And whenever an Irish and an Imperial\r\nstatute conflict, the rule of construction will be in favour of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Powers of the Irish Parliament\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish Parliament is given a general power to make laws for “the peace,\r\norder, and good government” of Ireland. The words are those usually\r\nemployed in the grant of legislative power in colonial constitutions, and\r\nthey have been interpreted as authorising “the utmost discretion of\r\nenactment for the attainment of the objects appointed to them.”(21) No\r\nconsiderations of policy or equity or repugnancy to the common law would\r\navail to challenge an Irish statute on the ground that it was _ultra\r\nvires_. Within the limits assigned to it the Irish Parliament will have\r\nauthority as plenary and as ample as the Imperial Parliament itself\r\npossesses or can bestow, and it may, if it so pleases, delegate this\r\nauthority.(22) The Irish legislature will, however, have no power to\r\nlegislate extra-territorially.(23) It could not, for example, pass a law\r\nto punish the Irish subjects of the Crown for offences committed outside\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nNow, these powers are undeniably large—larger, indeed, than is usually the\r\ncase even in Federal systems where the unenumerated or “residuary” powers\r\nare left to the State. It is conceivable that they might be exercised to\r\nthe prejudice of the Imperial Government and of the union of the two\r\nkingdoms, and there is nothing in these clauses of the Act to prevent them\r\nbeing so exercised. Treating it as a statute on the ordinary principles of\r\nthe interpretation of statutes, the Judicial Committee would have no\r\noption but to regard as valid any legislation of the Irish Parliament that\r\ndid not come within the exempted powers. With policy they are not and\r\nwould not be concerned. But then it must be remembered that there is the\r\npossibility of the exercise of the veto of the Imperial Government in\r\ncases where legislation, though _intra vires_, is inequitable,\r\ninexpedient, or contrary to Imperial interests. This executive veto is\r\nreally a juristic fact of great importance—it has always been present to\r\ntheir lordships’(24) mind as a reason for refusing to apply to the\r\ninterpretation of the Federal constitutions of Canada and Australia the\r\nrestrictive principles of the Supreme Court, as laid down in Marshall’s\r\nfamous doctrine of “implied restraints.”(25) When no such veto is in the\r\nhands of the Central Government, it becomes necessary to restrict, either\r\nin the text of the constitution, or in judicial interpretation of it, with\r\nconsiderable precision, the powers of the local legislatures. This is why\r\na true Federal system always involves a very large amount of litigation.\r\nBut litigation is a thing to be avoided, if possible. It encourages\r\npolitical parties to carry test cases into the courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitutional Restrictions.(26)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of protecting the rights and privileges of minorities in\r\nIreland by constitutional restrictions is the most delicate that ever\r\nperplexed the mind of the jurist. It is one which puts the Irish problem\r\nin a category by itself. In no other Constitution in the Empire—with the\r\nexception of a single clause in the British North America Act—is any\r\nattempt made to fetter the discretion of Parliaments by the imposition of\r\njuristic limitations upon their legislative capacity. To say a Parliament\r\nshall not legislate except upon certain subjects is one thing, to attempt\r\nto define _how_ it shall legislate upon those very subjects is quite\r\nanother. The latter is as difficult as the former is simple. To adopt a\r\npedestrian illustration, it is easy enough to forbid motorists to drive\r\nalong certain roads, but to forbid them to drive “recklessly” along any\r\nroad is another matter. “Recklessly” at once raises questions of standards\r\nof negligence and actionable rights. How are we going to distinguish\r\n“just” from “unjust” legislation, taxes which discriminate from taxes\r\nwhich do not, “rights” of the subject which a Parliament may disregard\r\nfrom those which it must respect? There has never been any doubt that a\r\ncolonial legislature may deal with the common law rights of the subject as\r\nit pleases, may abolish trial by jury, suspend the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, pass bills of attainder, enact _ex post facto_ legislation, take\r\nprivate property without compensation, and indemnify the Executive against\r\nactions for breaches of the law—if any doubt ever existed it was set at\r\nrest by the Colonial Laws Validity Act. But in the case of Ireland it was\r\nthought necessary—owing, doubtless, largely to the fears excited in the\r\nminds of Englishmen by the Protestant minority in Ulster and the\r\ncommercial interests in both countries—to insert in the earlier Home Rule\r\nBills an elaborate series of restrictions upon the exercise of even those\r\nlegislative powers which the Irish Parliament might admittedly possess.\r\nFor a parallel to these restrictions one would have to go back to the\r\nConstitution of the United States and the philosophy of “natural rights.”\r\nA more difficult problem it is impossible to conceive, because a\r\nConstitution of this kind runs counter to the whole tradition of\r\nParliamentary sovereignty in this country and the colonies. Anyone who\r\ntakes the trouble to study the decisions of the Privy Council when\r\ncolonial legislation has been impugned on the ground of its infringing the\r\ncommon law rights of the subject or “natural justice”(27) will discover\r\nthat constitutional limitations of this kind upon the powers of colonial\r\nLegislatures are not recognised by our judges. In the absence of express\r\nwords in the colonial Constitutions, such restraints do not exist. “The\r\nonly thing,” as Lord Halsbury grimly remarked on one occasion, for the\r\nsubject whose actionable rights are taken away by a Colonial Act of\r\nIndemnity “to do is to submit.”\r\n\r\nThe earlier Home Rule Bills were characterised by a most elaborate code of\r\nrights which the Irish Legislature might not infringe. Its main provisions\r\nmight be classified as having three objects in view: (1) The protection of\r\nthe subject in life, liberty, and property; (2) the prevention of\r\nlegislation discriminating against any part of the United Kingdom, and (3)\r\nthe preservation of the existing rights and privileges of the Protestant\r\ncommunity in Ireland. In one form or another almost all these principles\r\nare to be found embodied in the Constitution of the United States, and in\r\nthe case of the first of them a clause of the famous 14th Amendment was\r\nactually incorporated, with some slight alterations, in Sub-section 8 of\r\nSection 4 of the Bill of 1893, according to which the powers of the Irish\r\nLegislature should not extend to the making of any law\r\n\r\n\r\n    “whereby any person may be deprived of life, liberty, or property\r\n    without due process of law in accordance with settled principles\r\n    and precedents or may be denied the equal protection of the laws\r\n    or whereby private property may be taken without just\r\n    compensation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThese impressive words bristled with legal controversy. Did they, for\r\nexample, secure to the subject the preservation of the right to trial by\r\njury? In the States of America it has been authoritatively laid down(28)\r\nthat, in the absence of further defining words in the State constitutions,\r\nthey do not. Such procedure is indeed safeguarded in the Federal Courts,\r\nbut only in consequence of express words. In the case of the States,\r\nCooley, a great authority, says that “whatever the State establishes will\r\nbe due process of law,” and Story regarded the words by themselves as\r\nsimply securing a judicial hearing—that is to say, as they stand they\r\nmerely secure the separation of legislative and judicial functions and\r\nprevent the State Legislature from passing laws which are in effect\r\njudicial decrees.\r\n\r\nWhat the words would really have secured to the subject in Ireland was\r\nvery doubtful. The object of the draughtsman appears to have been to\r\nsecure to the subject in Ireland all the protection of the law, including\r\ntrial by jury, which he would have enjoyed at the date of the passing of\r\nthe Bill, understanding by law both common law and statute law. If the\r\nImperial Parliament had, subsequent to the date of the Act itself, passed\r\nlegislation limiting trial by jury or other common law rights, this would,\r\npresumably, have provided the Irish Parliament with a new “settled\r\nprinciple and precedent,” enabling it to go further. In other words, the\r\nclause might have operated to secure a certain standardization of\r\nlegislation as between the two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Argument Against Restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that such standardization is best secured by definitely\r\nreserving certain subjects of legislation to the Imperial Parliament\r\nrather than by imposing upon the exercise of such legislation by the Irish\r\nParliament constitutional limitations which are certain to raise great\r\ndoubts and provoke excessive litigation. It would be far better to reserve\r\ncriminal law, as has been done in Canada, in the case of the provincial\r\nlegislatures—though not without difficulty—than to lay down certain\r\nabstract principles. Moreover, is it desirable to maintain such uniformity\r\nof legislative principle? There is a great deal to be said for reserving\r\ncertain subjects of legislation to the Imperial Parliament, but to impose\r\non the whole sphere of legislation entrusted to the Irish Parliament the\r\nsame principles as those governing the English Statute-Book, or the common\r\nlaw, is to subject almost every conceivable Irish statute to the challenge\r\nof litigious politicians. This is what has happened in the United States.\r\nThe clause, as it stood, might quite conceivably have prevented the Irish\r\nlegislature from extending the procedure of the Summary Jurisdiction Acts\r\nto cases where it was not so extended in England—a most mischievous\r\nresult, seeing that this procedure is the sanction by which nearly every\r\nnew statute extending the scope of industrial or public health legislation\r\nor conferring powers on local authorities is enforced.\r\n\r\nUniformity of legislation between the two countries is not desirable in\r\nall directions nor has it hitherto been followed. In matters of\r\nexpropriation, for example, the drastic procedure of the Housing and Town\r\nPlanning Act has not been adopted in Ireland. Ireland has her own standard\r\nin these matters in the case of the Irish Local Government Act, and the\r\nLand Purchase Acts, and I am not at all sure that the principles of the\r\nEnglish Land Clauses Consolidation Act and Railway Clauses Consolidation\r\nActs as to arbitration and compensation are by any means ideal. Still less\r\nhas uniformity in the matter of criminal law been the rule hitherto\r\nbetween the two countries. It would be difficult to find a parallel in\r\nthis country for the Crimes Act of 1887 (which is still on the\r\nStatute-Book although it is no longer put in force by proclamation) with\r\nits extensions of summary jurisdiction to cases of criminal conspiracy,\r\nintimidation, riot, and unlawful assembly, and its provisions for a change\r\nof venue.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps more open to question whether the words of the 1893 Bill\r\ndesigned to secure to the subject “the equal protection of the laws,” and\r\nto prevent legislation discriminating against Englishmen and Scotsmen(29)\r\nunder certain circumstances, ought not to have been repeated. The words\r\n“equal protection of the laws” have been interpreted in the United States\r\nin such a way as to secure that legislation, particularly in the exercise\r\nof the “police power,” shall be impartial in its operation.(30) On this\r\ninterpretation, they would for example, have prevented an Irish\r\nLegislature from exempting Catholic convents which are used as workshops\r\nfrom the operation of the Factory Acts. But that might be secured in\r\nanother way, and the words might, if adopted, have operated to prevent\r\nmuch useful legislation. It seems likely enough that discriminating\r\nlegislation, in so far as it tended to prevent a particular class of\r\npersons from residing in Ireland or penalised non-residents, would be held\r\ninvalid in any case on the ground that it conflicted with the reservation\r\nto the Imperial Parliament of such subjects as “trade” and\r\n“naturalization.”(31) And, as regards non-residents, it must be remembered\r\nthat the grant of legislative powers can only be exercised “in respect of\r\nmatters exclusively relating to Ireland or some part thereof”—words which\r\nmay be found to be of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the omission in the Bill, to provide, as its\r\npredecessor of 1893 provided, for the maintenance of securities for the\r\nliberty of the subject and the preservation of his common law rights. It\r\nis almost impossible to do this without entering on an uncharted sea of\r\nlitigation. Modern legislation, especially social and industrial\r\nlegislation, infringes common law rights at every point. I have ventured\r\nelsewhere(32) to describe the modern tendency of industrial legislation as\r\na tendency, inverting Maine’s famous aphorism, to advance from contract to\r\nstatus, that is to say, to limit to an increasing extent the contractual\r\nfreedom of the worker, and to confer on him a certain status by the\r\nprotection of him against himself.(33) The greater part of our Irish land\r\nlegislation impaired the obligation of contracts. Professor Dicey\r\ncriticised the Bill of 1893 for not going further than it did in its\r\nincorporation of clauses taken from the Constitution of the United States\r\nwith the intention of securing the common law rights of the subject. But\r\nit may be remarked that many of those clauses have proved an almost\r\nintolerable limitation upon the power of the legislatures to deal with the\r\nregulation of trade and industry, so intolerable that the Supreme Court\r\nhas of late made a liberal use of the fiction of “the police power”(34) to\r\nenable the legislatures to pass legislation which otherwise might have\r\nseemed to “abridge the privileges” of citizens of the United States or\r\ndeprive them of “liberty or property without due process of law.”(35)\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be remembered that, although the Irish Parliament\r\nis not debarred from statutory interference with common law rights, its\r\nlegislation will be subject to rules of interpretation, at the hands of\r\nthe Judicial Committee, by which statutes are always construed in favour\r\nof the subject. It is a well-accepted rule of construction in English\r\ncourts that common law rights cannot be taken away except by express\r\nwords.(36) It is something to secure that the interpretation of the new\r\nConstitution and of Irish statutes shall, in the last resort, be wholly in\r\nthe hands of an Imperial Court. The chartered protection of the rights of\r\nthe individual by a fundamental Act is always difficult and often\r\nimpossible. In the last resort it depends very much on the interpretation\r\nwhich the judges choose to place upon such an Act.(37)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Executive Veto.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the principal and indeed almost the only\r\nsafeguard provided in the Bill against inequitable or discriminating\r\nlegislation(38) is the veto of the Lord-Lieutenant acting on the\r\ninstructions of the Imperial Government. A political check is preferred to\r\na juristic check. The apostolic maxim “all things are lawful but all\r\nthings are not expedient,” appears to have been the motto of the\r\ndraughtsman. Not law but policy will decide what Irish Acts are to be\r\nplaced on the Statute-Book. It must be admitted that this is the principle\r\nmost in harmony with precedent if the constitutions granted to the\r\ncolonies are to be regarded as precedents. No colony would have tolerated\r\nfor a moment the elaborate network of restrictions in Clause 4 of the Bill\r\nof 1893, through the finely-woven meshes of which it would have been hard\r\nfor any Irish legislation of an original or experimental character to\r\npass. If we are really in earnest about setting up a Parliament on College\r\nGreen, we cannot do otherwise. The executive veto must be the real check,\r\nand in the presence of such a check, English judges would always be very\r\nloath(39) to declare the Acts of a legislature _ultra vires_ merely\r\nbecause they infringed common law rights.\r\n\r\nNow this check may be exercised on one of two grounds. The Imperial\r\nGovernment may “instruct” the Lord-Lieutenant to refuse his assent either\r\non the ground that the bill in question is politically objectionable, or\r\non the ground that it is, in their opinion, in excess of the powers\r\nconferred on the Irish Legislature. It is desirable in every way that the\r\ntwo should be distinguished in order that the Imperial Parliament may be\r\nable to hold the Cabinet of the day responsible when its action is purely\r\na question of policy. On the other hand, it is no less desirable that the\r\nCabinet should, in the interests of the public in Ireland, be in a\r\nposition to test the validity of an Irish Bill which, though\r\nunobjectionable on the ground of policy, may be questionable on the ground\r\nof law. It is a common error that in all written constitutions the courts,\r\nparticularly those of the United States, have _proprio motu_ the power of\r\ndeclaring _ultra vires_ any legislative act which infringes the principles\r\nof the Constitution. Laboulaye fell into this error in his study of the\r\nAmerican Constitution. But the American Courts have no such power. Until a\r\ncase arises in the ordinary course of litigation, under the statute in\r\nquestion, there is no means of annulling it, and there have been many\r\nActs(40) on the Federal Statute Book which are quite conceivably\r\n“unconstitutional” in the letter as well as in the spirit, but have never\r\nbeen declared _ultra vires_ for the simple reason that no one has found\r\nhis private rights affected. This holds particulars of questions of the\r\ndistribution of power. It might for example, occur in the case of an Irish\r\nBill which proposed to deal with one of the reserved services. To meet\r\nthis difficulty and to avoid the trouble which might arise from an Act\r\nbeing placed in the Irish Statute Book(41) and observed in Ireland only to\r\nbe subsequently declared _ultra vires_ in the course of litigation, it is\r\nprovided in the Government of Ireland Bill(42) (Clause 29) that if it\r\nappears to the Lord-Lieutenant or a Secretary of State expedient in the\r\npublic interest that the validity of an Irish Act should be tested he may\r\nrepresent the same to His Majesty in Council and the question may then be\r\nheard and determined by the Judicial Committee in the same manner as an\r\nappeal from a Court in Ireland. It is not necessary to suppose that the\r\nexecutive veto will be a dead letter, and to argue from its disuse in the\r\ncase of the self-governing colonies is to argue from the like to the\r\nunlike. In the case of the provincial legislatures of Canada it has been\r\nexercised by the Dominion Government where provincial legislation is\r\ninequitable, or contrary to “the settled policy” of the Dominion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExempted Powers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enumeration of matters in respect of which the Irish Parliament shall\r\nhave no power to make laws is a little deceptive, inasmuch as many of the\r\nmatters so enumerated would have been outside its power in any case.\r\nIreland is not, so long as the Act of Union remains on the Statute Book, a\r\nsovereign state, and “the making of peace or war” and the negotiation of\r\ntreaties would, as a matter of international law, have been impossible in\r\nher case, even if they had not been expressly prohibited. “Merchant\r\nshipping” and “the return of fugitive offenders” would also have been\r\nexcluded from her authority by the rule of law(43) which precludes a\r\nsubordinate legislature from extra-territorial legislation. The same may\r\nbe said of Copyright. The colonies have only been enabled to deal with\r\nthese matters in virtue of clauses in Acts of the Imperial Parliament.(44)\r\nBut it would not be true to say that the position of the Irish Parliament\r\nis assimilated to that of the legislature of a self-governing colony. The\r\nexclusion of subjects relating to allegiance, such as naturalization(45)\r\nand treason,(46) and of legislation as to aliens is exceptional. All the\r\nself-governing colonies have power to deal with these matters, as also\r\nwith the subject of naval and military forces. Perhaps the most important\r\nexemption in the case of Ireland is that of trade, trade-marks, designs,\r\nmerchandise marks and patent rights. I cannot help regretting that,\r\ninasmuch as the principle has been adopted of giving Ireland general and\r\nunenumerated powers, the number of specific exemptions has not been\r\nenlarged. It is highly desirable to avoid conflict of laws in the United\r\nKingdom as far as possible. It must be remembered that the Statute Book\r\nhas, quite apart from the Act of Union, bound Ireland to England by many\r\nlegislative ties; there is a uniform system of industrial, commercial,\r\nand, to some extent, criminal law for the whole of these Islands—Factory\r\nActs, Companies Acts, the law of negotiable instruments, criminal\r\nprocedure, old-age pensions, and insurance legislation; in all these there\r\nis legislative standardization, and the tendency of all modern political\r\nunions, notably those of the Australian Commonwealth and the German\r\nEmpire, is in this direction. Confusion, injustice, and economic\r\ninequalities constantly occur in a modern State whose inhabitants are\r\nliving under a “conflict of laws.” Fiscal considerations point the same\r\nway. It may be safely assumed that English opinion will not tolerate any\r\nconsiderable divergence between the fiscal systems of England and Ireland.\r\nMoreover, financial considerations apart, the regulation of “trade” is, as\r\nin every political union, reserved for the central legislature. But to\r\ndistinguish between “trade” on the one hand and “industry” on the other is\r\nnot an easy problem, and Ireland may discriminate against England only\r\nless effectively by lowering the standard of the Factory Acts than by a\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\nThe “subject matter” of the Old Age Pensions Acts, National Insurance\r\nActs, and Labour Exchanges Acts has, it is true, been excluded. It seems\r\nregrettable that the category is not enlarged to include the Companies\r\nActs, the Sale of Goods Act, the Bills of Exchange Act, and the Factory\r\nActs. It would be highly undesirable to have the “industrial minimum” for\r\nthe United Kingdom, so laboriously attained by our factory legislation,\r\nlowered in the interests of particular interests in Ireland. The\r\nadvantages of securing uniformity by the inclusion of the three great\r\nstatutes relating to commercial law is also very obvious. Two of them,\r\nindeed, represent a great step in that codification of English law which\r\nis the dream of English jurists, they have been adopted as a model in some\r\nof our colonies, and it would seem highly desirable that the standard thus\r\nattained should remain fixed. In urging this, I do not forget what I have\r\nalready said, in connection with the subject of constitutional\r\nlimitations, as to the undesirability of exacting too rigid a degree of\r\nuniformity in English and Irish legislation, but constitutional\r\nlimitations are one thing and exceptions quite another. It is very\r\ndifficult to subject the whole field of Irish legislation to juristic\r\nprinciples, but it is comparatively easy to exempt from that field the\r\nsubject matter of particular Acts. The whole question resolves itself into\r\na consideration of the point at which uniformity should be determined. The\r\nBill seems to fix the point much too low.\r\n\r\nOf course, one way of dealing with the question would have been to grant\r\nIreland only particular and enumerated powers of legislation, as has been\r\ndone in the case of the provincial legislatures of Canada. There is much\r\nto be said for this. It seems the line of least resistance; it is always\r\neasier to add to powers which appear deficient than to withdraw powers\r\nwhich have proved excessive. But it undoubtedly invites litigation and it\r\nis very difficult, if not impossible, to define what are exclusively Irish\r\nmatters without in the last resort using some such general term (as is\r\nused in the British North America Act) as “generally all matters of a\r\nmerely local nature.”\r\n\r\nThe great economy shown by the draughtsman in the number of the exceptions\r\nfrom the powers of the Irish legislature, as well as in the number of the\r\nrestrictions upon the exercise of those powers, means, as we have already\r\nindicated, that the whole weight of control over the Irish legislature is\r\nthrown upon the executive and legislative veto of the Imperial Government.\r\nIs it sufficient to rely upon the paramount power of the Imperial\r\nParliament to override by statute Irish legislation which may be\r\ninequitable or inexpedient, and upon the exercise of the veto of the\r\nImperial Government? These checks are the exercise of a _force majeure_,\r\nwhich is often invidious and always difficult. Above all they are\r\npolitical. The exercise of them depends on the party in power in Great\r\nBritain, and as such it may excite resentment among the Irish people as an\r\ninvasion of the autonomy granted to them. On the other hand, exceptions\r\nand restrictions are a legal, not a political, check—they operate through\r\nthe agency of the courts of law without the intervention of political\r\nconsiderations. Moreover—and this perhaps is the most important\r\nconsideration—they rest upon the consent of the Irish people expressed in\r\nthe terms of the Home Rule Act to which their representatives are a party.\r\nFor an Irish Parliament to defy them would be to defy the very Act which\r\nwas the charter of its existence. But they invite litigation. It all\r\nresolves itself into a question of hitting the mean between the dangers of\r\nlitigation on the one hand and of political pressure on the other.\r\nProbably, however, the occasions of conflict will be few and unimportant,\r\nand the temper of the Irish Parliament may be much more conservative than\r\nits critics imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Executive\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new Bill is remarkable for the explicitness with which it invests\r\nIreland with control over the Executive. For the first time in the written\r\nconstitutions of the Empire we have a statutory Executive, and not only is\r\nit a statutory Executive, but it is to be a Parliamentary Executive\r\ndefined by statute. In the earlier Bills nothing was more remarkable than\r\nthe brevity and allusiveness with which this question of the Government of\r\nIreland was treated. “The Executive power in Ireland shall continue vested\r\nin Her Majesty the Queen” was the language employed in the Bill of 1893.\r\nUnder that Bill the Government of Ireland would have continued, even after\r\nits passage into law, to be in the hands of the English Cabinet and it\r\nwould have rested with that Cabinet to determine how large or how small a\r\npart of the prerogatives of the Crown should be delegated to the\r\nLord-Lieutenant. Paradoxical as it may seem, it would have been quite\r\npossible for a Unionist Government, coming into power immediately after\r\nthe Home Rule Bill had passed into law and an Irish Parliament had met at\r\nDublin, to retain in their own hands the Executive authority in Ireland\r\nwithout any breach of statutory obligations. The Bills of 1886 and 1893\r\nleft it in the discretion of the Crown to decide what the powers of the\r\nLord-Lieutenant should be. Following Colonial precedents, the Constitution\r\nwould have had to be supplemented(47) by prerogative legislation in the\r\nshape of Letters Patent defining those powers. Moreover, these powers were\r\nto have been vested not in the Lord-Lieutenant in Council, but in the\r\nLord-Lieutenant alone. Something was indeed, said about an “Executive\r\nCommittee” of the Irish Privy Council to aid and advise in the Government\r\nof Ireland—this was the only hint of responsible Government that the Bill\r\ncontained—but nothing was said of the powers or constitution of the\r\nCommittee nor of the extent to which the Lord-Lieutenant was bound to act\r\non its advice. Its constitution was left to the discretion of Her Majesty.\r\nIts powers would, of course, as in the case of the Colonies, have been\r\ndecided by the tacit adoption of the unwritten conventions of the English\r\nConstitution that the advisers of the Governor must command the confidence\r\nof the Legislature which votes supplies.\r\n\r\nVery different is our new Bill. The Executive power does indeed continue\r\n“vested in His Majesty the King,” and nothing is to affect its exercise—in\r\nother words, it is to continue in the hands of the Imperial\r\nGovernment—_except_ “as respects Irish services as defined for the purpose\r\nof this Act.” The exception is a new departure and the general effect of\r\nthe whole clause (Clause IV.) is expressly to hand over in statutory terms\r\n“all public services in connection with the administration of the\r\nGovernment of Ireland” except the reserved services and such services as\r\nthose in regard to which the Irish Parliament have no power to make laws.\r\nThe effect of this is to hand over an executive authority co-extensive\r\nwith the legislative authority.(48) Moreover, in regard to Irish services,\r\nthe Executive power is to be exercised by the Lord-Lieutenant _through_\r\nIrish Departments, and the heads of these Departments are given the\r\nParliamentary title of “Ministers” and, what is more remarkable, it is\r\nexpressly provided (a provision to be found in only one or two, and those\r\nthe latest, of our Colonial Constitutions) that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “No such person shall hold office as an Irish Minister for a\r\n    longer period than six months, unless he is or becomes a member of\r\n    one of the Houses of the Irish Parliament.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNever in any constitution that emanated from the practised hand of the\r\nParliamentary draughtsman has there been such a complete transfer in\r\nexpress statutory terms of the executive power. Taken together with the\r\ncomparatively unrestricted grant of legislative power, it constitutes a\r\ngrant of a larger measure of self-government than is to be found in any of\r\nthe earlier Bills.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there is here no cause for alarm. It must be remembered\r\nthat the Lord-Lieutenant will exist in a dual capacity—like a\r\nconstitutional king he will be bound in Irish matters to act on the advice\r\nof his Irish Ministers but, like a Colonial governor, he will also in all\r\nImperial matters be bound to obey the instructions of the Imperial\r\nGovernment. In regard to legislation the position here is quite clear: he\r\nmay veto measures which his own Ministers have promoted if the Imperial\r\nGovernment think it advisable so to instruct him. In regard to the\r\nexecutive, he will, of course, enjoy less latitude; it is quite clear that\r\nthe Imperial Government will, under this clause, find it practically\r\nimpossible to interfere in purely Irish administration. The Irish\r\nGovernment will, of course, be carried on in the name of the Crown, and it\r\nwill enjoy the same prerogatives at common law as the Imperial Government\r\nin such matters as the use of the prerogative writs _mandamus_ and\r\n_certiorari_, and the immunity from actions in tort. Ireland has its own\r\nPetitions of Right Act.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a distinction must be drawn between the prerogatives\r\nrelating to the exercise of Irish services and prerogatives which cannot\r\nbe so defined. Some of the latter may be delegated to the Lord-Lieutenant\r\nby his patent, and these he will exercise not on the advice of the Irish,\r\nbut of the Imperial, Government. Moreover, there are certain powers\r\nconferred by statute on the Lord-Lieutenant, or the Lord-Lieutenant in\r\nCouncil, such as the power of proclaiming disaffected districts under the\r\nCrimes Act, of suspending the operation of the Irish Habeas Corpus Act,\r\nand of controlling the constabulary, not all(49) of which will be\r\nexercisable on the advice of Irish Ministers. Prerogatives not so\r\nexercisable will no doubt be exercised on the advice of the Secretary of\r\nState for Home Affairs who is even now the medium of formal communications\r\nbetween the Lord-Lieutenant and the Crown. The Chief Secretary(50) will,\r\nof course, disappear altogether; he will be replaced by the Executive\r\nCommittee. The Lord-Lieutenant will, of course, cease to be a member of\r\nthe English Ministry; his position will be assimilated to that of a\r\nColonial Governor, and his tenure fixed for a term of years so as to make\r\nhis tenure of office independent, as it must be in the exercise of his new\r\nconstitutional duties, of the fortunes of English Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish Legislature\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the legislature itself calls for little comment. It\r\nfollows with some fidelity the features of Mr. Gladstone’s Bills, but the\r\nsubstitution of a nominated Senate for the “Council” or “Order” elected on\r\na property franchise is a new departure. Nomination of late has fallen\r\ninto some discredit both in theory and in practice.(51) Colonial\r\nexperience is not encouraging. Nomination by the Crown means in practice\r\nnomination by the Governor, on the advice of the Cabinet of the day, and\r\nMinistries in Canada and New South Wales have put this prerogative to such\r\npartizan uses as to reduce the Upper House to a very servile condition.\r\nWhen nomination is for life and not for a fixed term of years the evils of\r\nthis system may be mitigated, but they are not removed. The one thing that\r\ncan be said about the proposed Senate is that its powers in legislation\r\nare of such a limited character that an Irish Executive would be under\r\nlittle temptation to “pack” it. A Senate of only forty members compelled\r\nto meet in joint session a House of Commons of 164 members every second\r\ntime that it rejects or objectionably amends a bill is not likely to prove\r\na very formidable obstacle to legislation. But the nomination by the\r\nExecutive is in any case somewhat objectionable, and it would seem better\r\nto provide that at the end of the first term of eight years the Senators\r\nshould be appointed by some system of election, whether on a basis of\r\nproportional representation or otherwise.(52) But to their nomination for\r\nthe first term by the Imperial Government I see no very cogent objection.\r\nIndeed, the expedient has much to be said for it, for the discretion, if\r\nwisely exercised, will enable the Imperial Government not only to secure\r\nto Irish minorities a degree of representation which no conceivable system\r\nof election could secure, but also to appoint men of moderate opinions—one\r\nimmediately thinks of Sir Horace Plunkett—who, in the strife of\r\nextremists, might have no chance of election by either party. It has been\r\nargued in some quarters that a Second Chamber is wholly unnecessary, and\r\nthe example of the single-chamber legislatures in some of the Canadian\r\nprovinces has been cited. The argument, however, overlooks one really\r\nimportant function of the Senate, namely its duty to provide for the\r\nsecurity of tenure of the Irish judges. Clause XXVII. provides that judges\r\nappointed after the passing of the Act shall only be removable on an\r\nAddress of both Houses of the Irish Parliament, and, should the Senate\r\nrefuse to concur in a demand by the lower House for the removal of a\r\njudge, there is no such means of overcoming its resistance in a joint\r\nsession as is the case with legislation. This is well.\r\n\r\nThere is one provision in the Bill(53) which will serve to strengthen the\r\nposition of the Senate as an advisory body and may operate to give it an\r\ninitiative in the introduction of Government legislation—the provision\r\nwhich enables an Irish Minister who is a member of either House to sit and\r\nto speak in both Houses. This is a practice common on the Continent, and\r\nnot wholly unknown in the case of some of our Colonial Constitutions, and\r\nit has much to commend it. The Senate is placed under the same\r\ndisabilities as to money bills as are imposed on the House of Lords by the\r\nParliament Act. Thereby it is placed in an inferior position to that of\r\nmost of the Second Chambers in the Colonies, all of which can reject, and\r\nsome of which may also amend, money bills. The disability is the less\r\nsurprising having regard to its character as a nominee body—it is when the\r\nSecond Chambers of the Colonies are elective, that their powers in regard\r\nto money bills are considerable.(54)\r\n\r\nThe privileges of the Imperial Parliament are conferred by the Government\r\nof Ireland Bill upon the Irish Parliament. In the absence of such grant\r\nthe Irish Parliament would not have had such privileges—although it might\r\nhave adopted them by legislation—for the _lex et consuetudo Parliamenti_\r\nare not implied in the grant of a constitution.(55) It is not uncommon to\r\nprescribe in Colonial Constitutions that the legislature shall have such\r\nprivileges as are enjoyed by the House of Commons at the time of grant. In\r\nthe present case, the Irish Parliament may define its privileges, if it\r\nthinks fit, by legislation, though it is difficult to imagine any occasion\r\nfor its doing so. The really important thing is that it cannot enlarge\r\nthose privileges beyond the scope of the privileges of the Imperial\r\nParliament. This is the one constitutional limitation in the Bill—apart\r\nfrom the “safeguards” as to legislation in regard to religion and marriage\r\ncontained in Clause III.—and it is by no means unimportant. The powers of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament—particularly as to the right of the two Houses to\r\ncommit for contempt without cause shewn—are a sufficiently high standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIrish Representation in the House of Commons(56)\r\n\r\n\r\nIrish representation at Westminster has always been the riddle of the Home\r\nRule problem. I have no space to examine here in detail the alternative\r\nsolutions which were put forward in the earlier Home Rule Bills. But there\r\nis one general consideration which must always be borne in mind in the\r\ntheoretical discussion of any solution. It is the very simple\r\nconsideration that representation is what mathematicians would call a\r\n“function” of legislative power—the one is dependent upon the other. If\r\nthe legislative powers over Ireland reserved to the Imperial Parliament\r\nare large, the representation of Ireland in that Parliament must not be\r\nsmall. It is at this point that Mr. Gladstone’s original proposal for\r\ntotal exclusion broke down. He reserved to the Imperial Parliament\r\nconsiderable powers of legislation in regard to Ireland and yet proposed\r\nto exercise those powers in the absence of Irish representatives.\r\n\r\nIt was no answer to cite colonial analogies. The Irish problem is not, as\r\nI have pointed out elsewhere, a colonial problem. No one at present\r\nproposes to give Ireland complete fiscal autonomy, for example. Nor is it\r\nstrictly apposite to say that the Imperial Parliament legislates for the\r\nColonies in the absence of colonial representatives. Such legislation is\r\nnow almost exclusively confined to what I may call enabling legislation in\r\nmatters in which the Colonies, owing to their status as Dependencies, are\r\nunable to legislate. In such matters as copyright, merchant shipping,\r\nmarriage, extradition, the Imperial Parliament legislates for the Colonies\r\nlargely because colonial laws cannot operate ex-territorially, and such\r\nImperial legislation is usually effected by means of application clauses\r\nwhich enable the Colonies to adopt it or not as they please. But rarely if\r\never does the Imperial Parliament legislate for a self-governing colony as\r\nit has done and will continue to do in the case of such domestic Irish\r\naffairs as old-age pensions, land purchase, Customs and Excise, defence,\r\nnaturalisation, to say nothing perhaps of industrial and commercial law. I\r\nhave already indicated my opinion in favour of confining these subjects to\r\nthe Imperial Parliament, but even were the opposite course taken there\r\nwould still remain the fiscal question. We cannot continue to tax Ireland\r\nunless the Irish representatives are to remain at Westminster.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Irish members at Westminster is imperative if the\r\nsupremacy of the Imperial Parliament is not to be illusory. Mr.\r\nBalfour(57) contends that it will be as illusory as it has been in the\r\ncase of the Colonies. But the Colonies are not represented in the Imperial\r\nParliament, and to differentiate Ireland in this respect is to make all\r\nthe difference between a legal formula and a political fact.\r\n\r\nThere remains the question of inclusion. No one would question the\r\npropriety of reducing Irish representation to its true proportions on a\r\npopulation basis—in other words, from its present figure of 103 to one of\r\n70. The real difficulty arises when we consider whether those members,\r\nwhatever their numbers, are to attend at Westminster in the same capacity\r\nas the British members. We are to-day confronted by the same problem as\r\nthat which vexed the Parliament of 1893: are Irish members to vote upon\r\nall occasions or only upon those occasions when exclusively Irish and\r\nexclusively Imperial affairs are under discussion? The original text of\r\nthe 1893 Bill adopted the latter solution. At first it has much to commend\r\nit, for it avoids—or attempts to avoid—the anomaly of refusing\r\nself-government to Great Britain while granting it to Ireland: if Irish\r\nmembers are to govern themselves at Dublin without the interference of\r\nEnglishmen, why, it has been pertinently asked, should not the converse\r\nhold good at Westminster? But two very grave difficulties stand in the\r\nway; one is the difficulty of distinguishing between Irish and non-Irish\r\nbusiness at Westminster; the other is the difficulty, even when such\r\ndistinction is made, of maintaining a single majority under such\r\ncircumstances. Withdraw the Irish members on certain occasions and you\r\nmight convert a Liberal majority at Westminster on certain days into a\r\nUnionist majority on other days. A Liberal Government might have\r\nresponsibility without power in British matters and a Unionist Opposition\r\npower without responsibility. One Executive could not co-exist with two\r\nmajorities. Such a state of affairs might have been conceivable some\r\nseventy or eighty years ago, when Ministries were not regarded as\r\nresponsible for the passage of legislation into law. It would be\r\nconceivable in France, where Ministries come and go and the Deputies\r\nremain. But it would be fatal to the Cabinet system as we know it.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the “in-and-out” plan is the extreme difficulty of\r\nclassifying the business of the House of Commons in such a way as to\r\ndistinguish between what is “Irish” and what is not. If that business were\r\npurely legislative the difficulty would not be so great, but the House\r\ncontrols administration as well as legislation. Any question involving a\r\nvote of confidence in the Cabinet might legitimately be regarded as a\r\nmatter in which the Irish members had a right to have a voice. The motion\r\nfor the adjournment of the House, following on an unsatisfactory answer by\r\na Minister, might be regarded as such. Who would decide these things? The\r\nBill of 1893 provided for their determination by the House. In that event\r\nthe Irish members would presumably have had a voice in determining on what\r\nsubjects they should or should not vote, and they would have been masters\r\nof the situation under all circumstances. By their power to determine the\r\nfate of Imperial Ministries they might have determined the exercise of the\r\nImperial veto on Irish legislation and reduced it to a nullity. It may,\r\nindeed, be urged that the Irish vote often dominates the situation at\r\nWestminster even under present circumstances, but it must be remembered\r\nthat it is now exercised in the consistent support of the same\r\nadministration, whereas under an “in-and-out” system its action might be\r\ncapricious and apt to be determined solely by Irish exigencies of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThere remains the plan of the inclusion of Irish members for all purposes.\r\nThis at least has the advantage of simplicity. If Irishmen constantly\r\nattended at Westminster without distinction of voting capacity they would\r\nbe less likely to regard their presence there as an instrument for\r\nreducing to impotence the exercise of the Imperial veto upon Irish\r\nlegislation. It is quite conceivable, indeed, that once Home Rule is\r\ngranted Irishmen will be Imperialists at Westminster without becoming\r\nNationalists at Dublin—the natural conservatism of the Irish character may\r\nreassert itself. Close observers of Irish thought are inclined to believe\r\nthat the grant of Home Rule will act as a great solvent in Irish political\r\nlife, and that with the iron discipline of Nationalism relaxed, and its\r\ncherished object attained, lines of cleavage, social, economic, and\r\nindustrial, will appear in Ireland and vastly change the distribution of\r\nIrish parties both at Dublin and at Westminster. Ulster “Unionists” may be\r\nfound voting with a Liberal Government on education questions and Irish\r\n“Nationalists” against it. Irish representatives at Westminster may become\r\nmore, rather than less, closely identified with British interests. And it\r\nshould be remembered that it would be no new thing for members from one\r\npart of the United Kingdom to be voting on measures which solely concerned\r\nanother part of the Kingdom. This is happening every day. As Mr. Walker\r\npoints out elsewhere, a process of legislative disintegration has been\r\ngoing on within the walls of the Imperial Parliament itself, which is\r\nalready being forced to legislate separately for the three separate parts\r\nof the United Kingdom. He estimates that during the last twenty years no\r\nless than 49.7 per cent. of the public general Acts have applied only to\r\nsome one part of the United Kingdom instead of to the whole.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Ireland Bill adopts the principle of total inclusion,\r\nbut qualifies the anomaly which is involved in the presence of Irish\r\nmembers voting on non-Irish questions by reducing the representation of\r\nIreland to the number of forty-two, and thus to a figure far below that to\r\nwhich Ireland is entitled on the basis of population. At the same time it\r\nmust be admitted that the anomaly is not thereby removed. The position of\r\nIrish members voting on purely English legislation after the grant of Home\r\nRule will indeed—numbers apart—be more anomalous than it was before it. An\r\nanomaly can be tolerated so long as it is universal in its operation, and\r\nScotch and English members can at present view with equanimity the\r\nspectacle of Irish members voting in their own affairs so long as they\r\nthemselves exercise the same privilege in those of their neighbours.\r\nReciprocity of this kind produces a certain unity of thought in a\r\ndeliberative assembly. But the anomaly at once becomes invidious if\r\nIrishmen are placed in a privileged position. It is perhaps more\r\ntheoretical than real, as the actual weight that could be thrown into the\r\nscale of the division lobby by a Nationalist majority (taking the present\r\nbalance of parties in Ireland) of about twenty-six cannot be considerable,\r\neven if, as is very doubtful, it were consistently exercised.\r\n\r\nStill the anomaly remains. Is it possible to meet it by some extension of\r\nHome Rule to the legislative affairs of England and Scotland?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Further Extension of Home Rule\r\n\r\n\r\nThe anomaly, however, remains. How is it to be met? Obviously it is but a\r\ntemporary difficulty if, as the Prime Minister has suggested in his speech\r\non the first reading, the Bill is to be regarded as but the first step in\r\na general devolution of the legislative powers of the Imperial Parliament.\r\nBut everything depends on how far that devolution is to be carried. The\r\nPrime Minister’s reference to a change in the Standing Orders suggests a\r\nfurther development of the Committee system already in operation in the\r\ncase of the Scottish Standing Committee by which the House has delegated a\r\ncertain degree of provincial autonomy to a group of members. It would be\r\npossible to extend this to the creation of a Standing Committee for\r\nEngland and Wales. Under such a system Irish Members would be excluded\r\nfrom the Committee stages of legislation which was neither Irish nor\r\nImperial. But there remains the Report stage, which is always apt to\r\nresolve itself into a Second Committee stage(58) in which the whole House\r\nparticipates. Moreover, an impassable limit is set to this process of\r\ndomestic devolution by the necessity that the Government of to-day should\r\ncommand a majority in each of these Committees. A Liberal Ministry would\r\nprobably find itself in a minority in an English Standing Committee, and a\r\nUnionist Ministry would, with equal probability, find itself in a minority\r\nin a Scottish Committee. Committees have become not so much a sphere for\r\nthe legislative initiative of the private member as a new outlet for\r\nGovernment business. Contentious bills introduced or adopted by the\r\nGovernment are referred to them, and the moment this is the case the\r\nMinister in charge who is confronted in Committee with amendments which he\r\ndoes not care to accept may invite the whole House on the Report stage of\r\nthe Bill to disallow them. The House itself, jealous of any surrender of\r\nits prerogatives, is only too apt to turn the Report stage into a second\r\nCommittee stage. The responsibility of a Government department for the\r\npreparation and execution of legislation is to-day so indispensable that\r\neffective legislative devolution is almost impossible without devolution\r\nof the executive also. A Committee to which the Minister in charge of the\r\nBill is not responsible is not in a position to exercise effectual control\r\nover legislation. Indeed it seems impossible to contemplate a devolution\r\nof legislative power without a corresponding devolution of executive\r\npower. So long as we have but one Executive in the House of Commons it is\r\nimpossible to have two or three legislatures within the walls of that\r\nHouse. Moreover, it is just as imperative to restore the diminishing\r\ncontrol of members of Parliament over administration as it is to\r\nre-establish their authority in legislation. There is a growing and\r\nregrettable tendency to confer upon Government departments both\r\nlegislative and judicial powers—powers to make statutory orders and to\r\ninterpret them, which is depriving our constitution of what has hitherto\r\nbeen regarded by foreign students as one of its most distinctive\r\nfeatures—the subordination of the executive to the legislature and to the\r\ncourts. The distinction between Gesetz und Verordnung,(59) between statute\r\nand order, is fast disappearing in the enormous volume of statutory\r\norders. Powers to make rules under particular statutes are entrusted to\r\nScotch, Irish, and English Departments which have the effect of\r\ndiminishing the control of the House of Commons without transferring it to\r\nany representative substitute. The great increase of grants-in-aid for\r\nadministrative purposes has also given the departments a power of indirect\r\nlegislation by the latitude they enjoy in the distribution of them such as\r\nis further calculated to diminish the control of the House of Commons over\r\nquestions of Irish and Scotch policy. Rarely do any marked departures by\r\nthe departments come under the review of the House of Commons; the claims\r\nof the Government over the time-table of the House, fortified by certain\r\nrulings of the Speaker,(60) may and frequently do preclude any examination\r\nof them. In the words of a famous resolution, one may say “the power of\r\nthe Executive has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.”\r\n\r\nBut it is no remedy for this state of things to provide for administrative\r\ndevolution alone. To devolve the authority which a great Department of\r\nState, such as the Board of Agriculture, exercises over the whole of Great\r\nBritain by the simple process of assigning its Scotch business to the\r\nSecretary for Scotland, does not increase the control of Scottish members\r\nover the executive. This process of administrative devolution, which is\r\nalways going on, is not accompanied by any measure of legislative\r\ndevolution; the Secretary for Scotland is not thereby brought under the\r\ncontrol of the Scotch Standing Committee.\r\n\r\nTo create a new Scottish or Irish Department does not increase\r\nParliamentary control over Scottish or Irish administration; rather it\r\ndiminishes it. The heads of a Scottish Education Office, Local Government\r\nBoard, and Department of Agriculture have been made responsible not to the\r\nHouse of Commons but to the Secretary for Scotland. Like the Chief\r\nSecretary for Ireland, he is a Prime Minister without a Cabinet and\r\nwithout a Legislature, and his policy is determined primarily not by\r\nScottish or Irish opinion, but by the alien issues of imperial politics.\r\nObviously there will never be any remedy for these anomalies until we have\r\na Legislature with an executive responsible to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScottish Home Rule\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present moment we have in the case of Scotland devolution in a\r\nstate of arrested development. This process of disintegration is reflected\r\nin separate Estimates in finance and in distinct draftsmanship in\r\nlegislation. In legislation, indeed, marked changes have also taken place\r\nunder cover of alterations in the Standing Orders of the House of Commons.\r\nAn itinerant delegation of Scotch members has been set up to deal with\r\nprivate bill procedure in Scotland, and domestic devolution within the\r\nwalls of the House of Commons has taken the shape of a Scotch Grand\r\nCommittee. Few or none of these changes have any preconceived relation\r\nwith the others; they represent experiments framed to meet the exigencies\r\nof the moment, but they all bear eloquent witness to a fact which has\r\nchanged the whole aspect of the Home Rule problem and made that aspect at\r\nonce more practical and less intimidating—the fact that the House of\r\nCommons has found itself increasingly incompetent to do its work. The fact\r\nis disguised by a multitude of expedients, all of them, however, amounting\r\nto a renunciation of legislative authority. These changes represent the\r\n_disjecta membra_ of Scottish Home Rule—they have no coherence, they point\r\nnot so much to a solution of the problem as to its recognition.\r\n\r\nNone the less, I think the Irish Government Bill does provide us with a\r\nprototype. There is nothing in it, with the exception of the financial\r\nclauses, which forbids its adoption in the case of Scotland and of\r\nEngland. But I think, as I have already indicated in another connection,\r\nthat the category of reserved subjects ought to be considerably enlarged\r\nso as to secure the maintenance of the existing uniformity of legislation\r\nin commercial and industrial matters. There are, however, undeniable\r\ndifficulties in the way of an identity of local constitutions. Legislation\r\nin regard to land is exempted from the control of the Irish Legislature to\r\nan extent which Scotland would hardly be prepared to accept. Control over\r\nlegislation relating to marriage is retained in the case of Ireland; I\r\ndoubt if it would be tolerated in Scotland, whose marriage law differs(61)\r\nfrom that of England to a far greater extent than is the case with the\r\nmarriage law of Ireland. In common law England and Ireland have the same\r\nrules;(62) it is only in statute law that they differ. In Scotland the\r\ncommon law is radically different. There will, therefore, be some\r\ndifficulty in finding a common denominator for the Imperial Parliament—and\r\nin avoiding, even under “Home Rule All Round” a certain divergence in the\r\nlegislative capacities of the members from Scotland and Ireland, with the\r\nattendant risk of an “in-and-out” procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—Irish Administration Under Home Rule. BY LORD MACDONNELL OF SWINFORD\r\n\r\n\r\n    [The following article was, at my request, written by Lord\r\n    MacDonnell before he became acquainted with the provisions of the\r\n    Home Rule Bill. We agree in thinking it desirable that the article\r\n    should appear without alteration as an expression of the views\r\n    which Lord MacDonnell had formed on the subject.—THE EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI am asked to state my opinion as to the changes of Administrative\r\nDirection and Control which should be introduced into the system of Irish\r\nGovernment in the event of a Home Rule Bill becoming law.\r\n\r\nAs I write (in March) I am not acquainted with the provisions of the\r\npromised Bill and my conjectures in regard to them may, in some respects\r\nat all events, fall wide of the mark. But there are cardinal principles\r\nwhich, presumably, must govern the Bill, and lend to conjecture some\r\napproximate degree of accuracy. Among such principles are the\r\nestablishment of a representative assembly (Mr. Birrell has told us there\r\nwill be two Houses), with powers of legislation and of control over the\r\nfinances allocated to Ireland; the maintenance of the supremacy of the\r\nImperial Parliament; and the preservation of the executive authority of\r\nthe King in Ireland.\r\n\r\nAssuming then that the Bill will, in essence, be a measure of devolution\r\nunder which the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament will be preserved,\r\nthe Executive Power in Ireland will continue vested in the King (as under\r\nthe Bills of 1886 and 1893) and a representative body controlling the\r\nFinances (and consequently the Executive) will be established, an\r\nintelligent anticipation may be made of the organic changes in the\r\nexisting system of Irish Government which are likely to be required when\r\nthe Bill becomes law.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to push this anticipation into regions beyond those of\r\nconstitutional or organic change. It may happen that re-arrangements of\r\nthe Civil Service in Ireland, Inter-Departmental Transfers of the\r\nExecutive Staffs, and reductions of redundant establishments, may ensue on\r\nthe creation of the Irish Legislature.(63) But these changes, if they take\r\nplace, will not be organic or constitutional changes; nor could\r\nanticipations in respect of them be now worked out with due regard to\r\nvested rights or economical administration. If not so worked out, such\r\nanticipations would be either valueless or harmful.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore not attempt on this occasion to allocate establishments,\r\nor to suggest scales of pay, for the departments of the future Irish\r\nGovernment which I shall suggest in the following paragraphs. But I shall,\r\nas opportunity offers, point to such retrenchments of higher\r\nadministrative posts as appear to follow from the organic changes I shall\r\nindicate as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe dominating constitutional change will, of course, be the establishment\r\nof a Parliament which, operating through a Ministry responsible to it,\r\nwill control and direct the various departments engaged in the transaction\r\nof public business. It is unnecessary to consider here how that Parliament\r\nwill be recruited, though I may express my conviction that justice to\r\nminorities, the mitigation of political mistrust, and the promotion of\r\nefficiency in the Public Services, urgently require the recruitment to be\r\non the system of proportional representation. But I assume that when\r\nrecruited, the Parliament’s general procedure will be fashioned on the\r\nmodel of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster. To that end the first\r\nthing the new Parliament will have to do is to create its own\r\nestablishment of officers and clerks, to frame its Standing Orders\r\nrelating to the conduct of public business, and to settle any subsidiary\r\nrules that the Westminster precedents may suggest.\r\n\r\nHaving thus provided itself with the requisite machinery for the exercise\r\nof its powers, the Irish Parliament would naturally next proceed to bring\r\nunder its supervision the various existing agencies for the direction and\r\ncontrol of the public business of the country.\r\n\r\nAt present the business of Civil Government in Ireland is carried on\r\nthrough the following forty-seven Departments, Boards, and Offices, which\r\nI group with reference to the degree of control exercised over them by the\r\nIrish Government at the present time.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS, ETC., UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n      (1) Royal Irish Constabulary.\r\n      (2) Dublin Metropolitan Police.\r\n      (3) Prisons Board.\r\n      (4) Reformatory and Industrial School Office.\r\n      (5) Inspectors of Lunatics.\r\n      (6) General Registry of Vital Statistics.\r\n      (7) Registry of Petty Sessions Clerks.\r\n      (8) Resident Magistrates.(64)\r\n      (9) Crown Solicitors.\r\n      (10) Clerks of Crown and Peace.\r\n      (11) Office of Arms (Ulster King of Arms).\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS, ETC., UNDER THE PARTIAL CONTROL OF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n      (1) Land Commission.\r\n      (2) Commissioners of charitable donations and bequests.\r\n      (3) Public Record Office.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS, ETC., NOT UNDER CONTROL OF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT, BUT HAVING\r\nTHE CHIEF SECRETARY AS EX OFFICIO PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n      (1) Local Government Board.\r\n      (2) Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS, ETC., NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE IRISH GOVERNMENT EXCEPT AS\r\nREGARDS APPOINTMENTS AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE FRAMING OF RULES OF\r\nBUSINESS.\r\n\r\n      (1) Board of National Education.\r\n      (2) Board of Intermediate Education.\r\n      (3) Commissioners of Education. (Endowed Schools).\r\n      (4) National Gallery.\r\n      (5) Royal Hibernian Academy.\r\n      (6) Congested Districts Board.\r\n\r\nBOARDS EXERCISING STATUTORY POWERS IN IRELAND BUT NOT UNDER CONTROL OF THE\r\nIRISH GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n      (1) Public Loan Fund.\r\n      (2) Commissioners of Irish Lights.\r\n      (3) Queen’s University, Belfast.\r\n      (4) National University.\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENTS, ETC., NOT CONTROLLED BY THE IRISH GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n      (1) The Judiciary.\r\n      (_a_) The Supreme Court of Judicature and its officers.\r\n      (_b_) Recorders.(65)\r\n      (_c_) County Court Judges.\r\n      (2) Registry of Deeds.\r\n      (3) Local Registration of Titles.\r\n      (4) Railway and Canal Commission.\r\n      (5) Commissioners of Public Works.\r\n      (6) General Valuation and Boundary Survey of Ireland.\r\n      (7) Treasury Remembrancer’s Office.\r\n      (8) National School Teachers’ Superannuation Office.\r\n\r\nENGLISH CIVIL DEPARTMENTS WORKING IN IRELAND AND NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF\r\nTHE IRISH GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n      (1) Customs.\r\n      (2) Inland Revenue.\r\n      (3) General Post Office.\r\n      (4) Board of Trade (Dublin and other Ports).\r\n      (5) Quit Rent Office (Woods and Forests).\r\n      (6) His Majesty’s Stationery Office.\r\n      (7) Civil Service Commissioners.\r\n      (8) Inspector of Mines.\r\n      (9) Inspector of Factories.\r\n      (10) Registrar of Friendly Societies and Trades Unions, Building and\r\n      Co-operative Societies.\r\n      (11) Ordnance Survey of Ireland.\r\n      (12) Public Works Loan Commissioners.\r\n      (13) Exchequer and Audit Department.\r\n\r\nIt is thus apparent that at present the Irish Government exercises control\r\nover only a small portion of the official agencies working in the country.\r\nMany of these agencies—some of first-class importance and dealing with\r\nstrictly Irish business—are uncontrolled by the Irish Government, while\r\nthe supervision exercised over them by the Imperial Parliament is of the\r\nmost shadowy character. The congestion of public business in Westminster\r\neffectually prevents attention being paid to any Irish business—at least\r\nto any Irish business out of which party capital cannot be made.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, the first duty of the new Parliament will be to\r\nco-ordinate, and establish its control over, the _dísjecta membra_ of\r\nIrish Government. To that end it will, presumably, group into classes or\r\ndepartments the various “Boards,” “Offices,” and other official agencies\r\nenumerated above on the principle of common or cognate functions. Such a\r\nclassification is an essential preliminary to the establishment of\r\neffectual Parliamentary control over the transaction of public business. I\r\nproceed to suggest such a scheme of classification, but a preliminary word\r\nis necessary.\r\n\r\nSome controversy has taken place as to what is, and what is not, business\r\nof a “purely Irish nature,” with which alone, the Irish Government is to\r\nbe concerned under the promised Bill. In my opinion, the following\r\nDepartments, out of those enumerated above, namely:\r\n\r\n      (1) Customs,\r\n      (2) Excise,\r\n      (3) Post Office, Telegraphs, etc.,\r\n      (4) Treasury Remembrancer’s Office,\r\n      (5) Civil Service Commissioners,\r\n      (6) Exchequer and Audit Office, and\r\n      (7) Public Works Loan Commissioners,\r\n\r\ncan not be so classed, for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nThe control of the levy of Customs and Excise Revenue by the Irish\r\nLegislature, would imperil the fiscal solidarity of the United Kingdom,\r\nand be destructive of the further extension of Home Rule on federal lines.\r\nThe Imperial Parliament should continue to control these all-important\r\nDepartments, but power may be usefully reserved to the Irish Legislature\r\nto vary, under certain defined conditions, the duties on particular\r\narticles or commodities, without, however, any reservation of power to\r\nvary the articles themselves. For such a reservation, there is a precedent\r\nin the Isle of Man (Customs) Act of 1887, as I explained in an address\r\ndelivered before the Irish Bankers’ Institute last November. The\r\nsuggestion was further developed in an Article on Irish Finance, which I\r\ncontributed to the _Nineteenth Century and After_ for January, 1912. In\r\nthis connexion, it should be remembered that Mr. Gladstone’s Bills of 1866\r\nand 1893, excluded the Customs and Excise Revenue from Irish Control: and\r\nthat the present Leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, following, in\r\nthis respect, Mr. Parnell’s example, has recognized the propriety of the\r\nexclusion.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion I make preserves the principle, thus confirmed by high\r\nauthority, while it allows to Ireland, working in concert with Great\r\nBritain, the opportunity of adjusting her taxation to her own special\r\nnecessities.\r\n\r\nThe Administration of Posts and Telegraphs in Ireland is intimately\r\nassociated with the Department’s Administration in Great Britain; and\r\nthough Ireland has an indefeasible claim, which can be readily conceded,\r\nto the great bulk of the patronage within her shores, (patronage mostly of\r\na petty and purely local character) I fail to see in that claim sufficient\r\njustification for localizing the Irish part of the business and thereby\r\nincurring the risk of dislocating the working of a great Imperial\r\nDepartment. And my objection to transferring the Postal Department to the\r\nnew Government is emphasised by the fact that in Ireland this Department\r\nis worked at a loss of about a quarter of a million sterling annually.\r\nThere would, therefore, be a tendency on the part of the new Irish\r\nGovernment to curtail expenditure on the Post Office, to the detriment of\r\nthe public convenience of the United Kingdom, in order that the\r\nexpenditure on the Department should balance the income.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury Remembrancer’s Office will probably disappear with the system\r\nof which it is the symbol: but the Civil Service Commission calls for\r\nfurther consideration. As I am, at present, Chairman of the Royal\r\nCommission on the Civil Service, I feel myself precluded from writing on\r\nthis important matter with complete freedom; but this much I may say—in\r\nrecruiting her Civil Service Ireland will be well advised to follow the\r\nsame general system of appointment, promotion, and conditions of service\r\nas prevail in Great Britain, (though this uniformity need not be taken to\r\napply to scales of emolument). The enforcement of this principle will not\r\nmilitate against the establishment by the Irish Parliament, if so advised,\r\nof an Irish Civil Service as distinguished from the service which now\r\nexists for the United Kingdom as a whole. But I earnestly trust that if a\r\nseparate Irish Civil Service be established there will be no limitation of\r\ncandidature to Irish-born subjects of the Crown. Ireland would, in my\r\nopinion, commit a fatal mistake—fatal in more ways than one—if she imposed\r\nany impediment to the free competition by British-born subjects for\r\nappointments in the Irish Service, should one be created. She will gain\r\nfar more than she will lose from reciprocity in this connection.\r\n\r\nAssuming for the purpose in hand that the present general policy of\r\nrecruitment for the Civil Service will continue, the question arises\r\nwhether there should be an independent Civil Service Commission\r\nestablished in Dublin: or whether the Irish Government should ask the\r\nBurlington Gardens Commission to hold examinations in Ireland for the\r\nIrish service, associating with themselves some distinguished Irish\r\neducationalists. Personally I am strongly in favour of the latter\r\nalternative, on the ground of economy; and because of the advantage of\r\nusing experienced British agencies for common purposes. Good feeling and\r\nmutual understanding will be thereby promoted.\r\n\r\nTurning to the remaining Imperial Departments, I think the Exchequer and\r\nAudit Office should relinquish its Irish functions to a similar office\r\nrestricted in its operations to Irish finances only(66); while the Public\r\nWorks Loans Commissioners would probably cease to do business in\r\nIreland.(67) Loans to municipalities and other public bodies in Ireland\r\nwould, under the new dispensation, be probably made by the Irish Treasury\r\nacting on the advice of the Irish Board of Works.\r\n\r\nI had, at first, thought of adding the Department of “Woods and Forests”\r\n(Quit Rents) to the list of excluded Departments, but I trust that,\r\nfollowing the treatment proposed in Clause 24 of the Bill of 1893, this\r\nsource of income may be made over to the Irish Parliament. If not, the\r\nDepartment should swell the list of exclusions. In the same way I had at\r\nfirst intended including the Land Commission in the excluded list, because\r\nof the imperative necessity which exists of retaining the Finance and\r\nAdministration of Land Purchase under the control of the Imperial\r\nTreasury. I need not labour this point; all intelligent persons are agreed\r\nthat the use of British Credit is essential to the furtherance of Irish\r\nLand Purchase, that Ireland, of herself, could not finance her great Land\r\nPurchase undertaking, because the cost would be prohibitive and would\r\nbring to an end that great scheme on whose successful accomplishment the\r\npeace and prosperity of Ireland so greatly depend. If the Government\r\ndecides to exclude the Land Commission permanently from the control of the\r\nIrish Legislature no Irishman need object; but, for reasons to be stated\r\nin the sequel, I am disposed to think that the Land Commission might be\r\nbetter placed in a temporarily reserved, than in a permanently excluded,\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nWith these exceptions I think that all the other public Departments and\r\nOffices enumerated may be regarded as dealing with business of a purely\r\nIrish character, the administration of which may be localized to Ireland.\r\nAll of them, with the important addition of “Finance” and of certain other\r\nminor subjects which are known officially as “Votes,” I would group into\r\nDepartments of Government in the following way, premising that I do not\r\npretend to give an exhaustive list of “sub-heads,” which, indeed, must\r\nvary with changing circumstances and the growth of work. As I have said,\r\nthe object of this grouping or classification is to facilitate the\r\nintroduction of parliamentary control over every branch or kind of public\r\nbusiness in Ireland.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED SCHEME OF ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE REFORMED IRISH\r\nGOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n_Group I.—The Treasury._\r\n    (1) General Finance.\r\n        (_a_) Taxation, Bills before the Legislature.\r\n        (_b_) Budgets, Recoverable Loans, Local Taxation Account.\r\n        (_c_) Courts of Law, Legal Establishments, Legal Business.\r\n        (_d_) Other Civil Departments, Pensions, Valuation and Boundary\r\n                    Surveys.\r\n        (_e_) Trade and Commerce.\r\n        (_f_) Exchequer and Audit.\r\n    (2) Local Finance.\r\n        (_a_) Municipalities, Urban Councils.\r\n        (_b_) County and Rural Councils.\r\n    (3) Registry, Receipt and Issue of Letters.\r\n_Group II.—Law and Justice._\r\n    (1) Supreme Court of Justice and its Officers.\r\n    (2) Recorders.\r\n    (3) County Court Judges.\r\n    (4) Resident Magistrates.\r\n    (5) Crown Business.\r\n        (_a_) General.\r\n        (_b_) Law Officers.\r\n        (_c_) Crown Prosecutors, Crown Solicitors.\r\n        (_d_) Petty Sessions Clerks.\r\n    (6) Police.\r\n        (_a_) Royal Irish Constabulary.\r\n        (_b_) Dublin Metropolitan Police.\r\n    (7) Prisons, Reformatories, Criminal Lunatics.\r\n    (8) Miscellaneous.\r\n    (9) Registry, Receipt and Issue of Letters.\r\n_Group III.—Education, Science and Art._\r\n    (1) Primary.\r\n    (2) Secondary.\r\n    (3) University.\r\n    (4) Technical.\r\n    (5) College of Science.\r\n    (6) National Gallery, Public Libraries, Museums.\r\n    (7) Registry, etc., of Letters.\r\n_Group IV.—Local Government._\r\n    (1) Rural.\r\n    (2) Urban.\r\n    (3) Sanitation.\r\n    (4) Medical Relief, Hospitals.\r\n    (5) Poor Law Relief, Orphanages and Asylums.\r\n    (6) Crop Failure, Famine Relief.\r\n    (7) Labour questions, Housing of the working-classes.\r\n    (8) Audit of Local Accounts.\r\n    (9) Registry, etc., of Letters.\r\n_Group V.—Public Works._\r\n    (1) Roads and Buildings.\r\n    (2) Railways and Canals.\r\n    (3) Marine Works.\r\n    (4) Drainage, Irrigation and Reclamation.\r\n    (5) Mines and Minerals.\r\n    (6) Registry of Letters.\r\n_Group VI.—Agriculture._\r\n    (1) General.\r\n    (2) Relief of Agricultural Congestion.

There is undoubtedly, a strong\r\nfeeling among Irish Unionists, and among many moderate Nationalists, that,\r\nif Home Rule does come, Judicial Patronage, and the control over the\r\nPolice, should be in the beginning reserved or excepted from the general\r\ntransfer of control to the new Government which would take place when the\r\nBill becomes law. On the other hand, the Nationalist Party are, I\r\nunderstand, anxious that there should be no delay in transferring the\r\njudicial patronage. They have been dissatisfied with the exercise of\r\njudicial patronage in the past: and they wish for a distribution more to\r\ntheir liking in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nI have myself no fear that judicial patronage will be misused to the\r\ndetriment of any party by the Irish Government of the future; but Irish\r\nUnionists are apprehensive on the point; and in my opinion something\r\nshould be done to allay their fears. If the Bill should contain provisions\r\nsimilar to Clause 19 of the Bill of 1893, which maintained in the Irish\r\nSupreme Court two judges with salaries charged on the Consolidated Fund of\r\nthe United Kingdom, appointed by the King in Council, and removable only\r\nby his Order, the Unionist apprehensions might be, to some extent at all\r\nevents, removed. But as the Financial Provisions of the coming Bill will\r\nprobably be different from those of the Bill of 1893, a clause like Clause\r\n19 of that Bill may not be inserted.(70)\r\n\r\nIn that case, I think it would tend to the establishment of general\r\nconfidence if the patronage in connexion with judicial appointments were,\r\nduring the transition period, reserved and administered, as at present, by\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant. I think it would be good policy to abstain from every\r\ntransfer of authority from the Lord-Lieutenant to which the Irish minority\r\nmay at the outset reasonably object. There must be a period of\r\ntransition—be it seven years or ten years or even longer—during which the\r\nminority will be suspicious of such change as I am now concerned with. I\r\nwould let these suspicions wear themselves out, as in time they are sure\r\nto do with the growth of further knowledge and of that saner outlook on\r\nImperial and Irish affairs, which collaboration towards common objects\r\nbrings with it. It seems to me that in the reassurance of opponents and\r\nhesitating well-wishers, and even in the immunity, for a time, from the\r\npressure and annoyances of this class of patronage, the new Irish\r\nGovernment may well find, in its infancy, satisfaction for the temporary\r\nwithholding of a part of its prerogatives. It might be an instruction to\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant, that, during the transition period, (which need not\r\nbe long) the wishes of the Irish ministry, in regard to appointments to\r\njudicial vacancies, should be ascertained and fully considered before the\r\nvacancies are filled.\r\n\r\nBut if this view cannot prevail then I suggest that during the transition\r\nperiod the patronage in connexion with the Supreme Court should, at all\r\nevents, be reserved. It is highly desirable that the apprehensions of the\r\nIrish Unionists should be allayed in every practicable way.\r\n\r\nAdvantage should, I think, be taken of this opportunity to remove the\r\nIrish Chancellorship from the list of political appointments. Whatever\r\nstrong reasons or justification may exist in England for the Lord\r\nChancellor changing with the Government, there should be none that I can\r\ndiscover in the Ireland of the future, unless it be in connection with the\r\nappointment of Justices of the Peace. But fairness in distributing that\r\nsort of patronage can surely be secured by other means than a frequently\r\nrecurring and unnatural change of Chancellors, whereby the Pension List is\r\nheavily and unnecessarily burdened.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the Royal Irish Constabulary, I am clear that the\r\ncontrol should rest, as now, with the Lord-Lieutenant (that is, with the\r\nImperial Government) until Land Purchase has made further progress, and\r\nthe new Government has gained experience of administration; but it is only\r\nfair that during this period of reservation the Imperial Government should\r\nallow Ireland a drawback on the cost of the police force, the present\r\nstrength of which is excessive if judged from the Irish point of view.\r\n\r\nThe situation will, of course, be anomalous inasmuch as there will be an\r\nExecutive Government responsible to the Irish Parliament yet relieved of\r\nthe prime responsibility resting on all Governments—the maintenance of law\r\nand order. This anomaly cannot be avoided: it inevitably arises from the\r\npolitical conditions of the case. The best way of dealing with the\r\nsituation will be to maintain existing arrangements which are directed by\r\nthe Under-Secretary and to preserve the subordination of the Law Officers\r\nto the Lord-Lieutenant in all matters relating to the maintenance of\r\norder. But while the Minister for Law and Justice should have no control\r\nover the police during this transition period, his wishes in regard to any\r\nmatter will, of course, be carefully considered; his request for the\r\nperformance by the police of all duties not of a purely police character\r\nwhich they now customarily discharge, will be complied with, and his\r\nproposals to reduce the strength of the force, and thereby effect saving\r\nin the public expenditure, will no doubt be favourably considered by the\r\nLord-Lieutenant if the state of the country permits.\r\n\r\nI presume the Bill will indicate the kind of police force which in time\r\nwill take the place of the existing force. I confess I am not prepossessed\r\nin favour of the plan embodied in this connexion in the Bill of 1886 or\r\n1893. I think the best plan will be to retain the organization of the\r\nRoyal Irish Constabulary, and to reduce the present force by short\r\nrecruitment when the Imperial Government think that can be safely done. I\r\ndeprecate the creation of a local force under the control of the local\r\nauthorities.(71)\r\n\r\nFinally, the question whether the force to be locally employed should be\r\narmed, or not armed (as the Bill of 1893 proposed), may be left to be\r\ndecided at the time by the Imperial Government: but, in any case, it will,\r\nI think, be necessary for the Irish Government to maintain a sufficiently\r\nstrong armed body of police in Dublin and other suitable centres to deal\r\nwith emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe control over the staff of Resident Magistrates is so intimately bound\r\nup with the existing system of police administration that one cannot be\r\nsafely separated from the other, and this section of Law and Justice\r\nshould, in my opinion, also be reserved during the transition period. At\r\nthe same time I think the services of the Resident Magistrates can be more\r\nfully utilized in the business of general administration than they are at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThere is less reason for retaining the Dublin Metropolitan Police under\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant’s direct control during the transition period than for\r\nretaining the Royal Irish Constabulary; and if the national feeling would\r\nbe gratified by giving to the Irish Parliament, at once, the control of\r\nthe Dublin police, I would defer to that feeling. But my personal opinion\r\nis that the Irish Parliament in its earliest days would be wise to\r\nconcentrate upon self-organization, the establishment of control over the\r\ndepartmental system, and the taking stock of the condition of the country\r\nin all the various aspects of national life. It will then with greater\r\nassurance of success take over from the Imperial Government the\r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of order.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the Land Commission. There is a general\r\nagreement that the department of land purchase, which depends essentially\r\nupon the use of British credit, should remain with the Imperial\r\nGovernment. The only question is: should this department be permanently\r\nexcluded from Irish control, or only temporarily excluded, the period of\r\nexclusion being in the discretion of the Imperial Government? In view of\r\nthe temporary character of the Land Commission, the possibility that\r\nLegislation affecting land may be necessary before the Annuities generally\r\ncease, and the certainty that when they do cease, either generally or in\r\nany particular area, it will be desirable to remove all limitations on the\r\nfunctions of the Irish Legislature in reference to land, I am disposed to\r\nthink it, on the whole, better to treat the Land Commission as a\r\n“reserved” instead of an “excluded” subject, and thereby make its ultimate\r\ntransfer to Irish control a matter of executive action on the part of the\r\nImperial Government. But I admit the existence of strong reasons for total\r\nexclusion, and I should not question a decision in favour of the latter\r\ncourse.(72) Should it be excluded, I would suggest that it shall be open\r\nfor the Irish Government to bring to the notice of the Lord-Lieutenant any\r\nmatters in which the administration of the Land Commission seems to be\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion I desire to call attention to the Congested Districts\r\nBoard and the power which it at present exercises of purchasing land under\r\nthe Land Purchase Acts. It is imperatively necessary, if this Board is to\r\nbe retained in its existing or in any modified shape, that its work of\r\nrelieving congestion and improving the condition of the peasantry of the\r\nWest should be brought under the supervision and control of the Irish\r\nLegislature. But if the land purchase operations of the Land Commission\r\nare to be excluded or reserved from control by the Irish Legislature, it\r\nis very difficult to defend the subjection to such control of the land\r\npurchase functions of the Congested Districts Board. How can the British\r\nTreasury be reasonably asked to become responsible for prices fixed by an\r\nIrish body over which it will have no control whatever? Such a situation\r\nwould be utterly anomalous.\r\n\r\nThe anomaly can be avoided (as suggested in my Minute appended to the\r\nReport of the Royal Commission on Congestion, 1908) by relieving the\r\nCongested Districts Board of its functions as a purchasing authority and\r\nhaving purchases of land made for it, on its requisition, by the Land\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nHaving thus indicated my opinion as to the departments or sections of\r\ndepartments to be temporarily reserved from the control of the Irish\r\nParliament, I come to the question of how that control should be exercised\r\nover the departments remaining on the list. In this connexion I invite\r\nreference to Clauses 20-22 of the Irish Council Bill. That Bill (Clause\r\n19) contemplated the appointment of committees of council, with paid\r\nchairmen, to administer the departments into which public business was to\r\nbe distributed under the Bill. It was my own expectation, had the Council\r\nBill become law, that the chairmen of these Committees of Council would in\r\ncourse of time have become ministers for the departments concerned; but,\r\nin the beginning and until experience had been gained, it seemed desirable\r\nto give the embryonic ministers the help, and to impose on them the\r\nrestraint, of colleagues. Whether the future Irish Legislature will see\r\nprudence or wisdom in this course, one can only conjecture; but one may\r\ntrust that it may. In the following observations, however, and without\r\nmeaning to imply any preference for “Ministers” over “Chairmen of\r\nCommittees,” I shall employ the word “Minister.”(73)\r\n\r\nThe first Department on my list is the Treasury. Here the new Irish\r\nAdministration must break entirely fresh ground and build from the\r\nfoundation. An Irish Exchequer must be created, a system of Treasury\r\nRegulations and accounts must be evolved; an Irish Consolidated Fund must\r\nbe established; and a Bank must be selected with which the Irish\r\nGovernment will bank. (Much pressure will, I anticipate, be brought to\r\nbear on the Irish Ministry to distribute its favours in this connexion;\r\nbut, it would, I submit, be highly inconvenient to keep accounts with\r\nseparate banks). At present the Chief Secretary’s office in Dublin Castle\r\nhas a financial section, but the new Government will derive no inspiration\r\nfrom its procedure. It will be better to look for precedents in Whitehall.\r\nThey will show a Treasury Board composed of members of the Government but\r\nwith the responsibility resting on one called the Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer who is answerable to Parliament for the country’s finances and,\r\nsubject to the decision of the Cabinet, possesses complete control over\r\nthem (excepting the Army and Navy Estimates). It will, I suggest, be wise\r\nfor the Irish Legislature to follow this precedent, and place the Irish\r\nTreasury in charge of a Body of Commissioners (being Members of the\r\nParliament) with a Treasurer or Chancellor of the Exchequer, specially\r\nresponsible to it.\r\n\r\nThe governing principle, from the parliamentary point of view, of our\r\nfinancial system, is that no expenditure can be proposed to Parliament\r\nexcept by a Minister of the Crown.(74) I trust that the principle will be\r\nreproduced in the Irish Parliament, and rigidly enforced. In no other way\r\ncan an adequate safeguard be provided against irresponsible and hasty\r\nproposals for spending public money.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Treasury at present, exercises financial control over every\r\ndepartment and branch of the public service (over the Army and Navy\r\nestimates I believe the control is less effective than in other\r\ndirections). This is a wholesome practice, and it should be copied by the\r\nIrish Legislature with one qualification. At present, the financial\r\ncontrol of the Treasury is occasionally accompanied by a degree of\r\nadministrative interference which I venture to think is sometimes\r\ninjurious to the public interests. The Treasury is deficient in\r\nadministrative knowledge; and for this reason its interference has not\r\ninfrequently led to inefficiency. Some administrative restraint is, of\r\ncourse, inseparable from financial control; but when money is sanctioned\r\nfor a particular purpose, the administrative officers on the spot can\r\nregulate detailed expenditure better than gentlemen at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament should certainly provide a Public Accounts’ Committee;\r\nand a Comptroller and Auditor-General, as under the Exchequer and Audit\r\nAct of 1866; and I suggest for consideration, that the Departments should\r\nbe competent to challenge, before the Public Accounts’ Committee, any\r\nover-interference on the part of the Treasury in administrative details.\r\nWhile I should be glad to see in Ireland the most effective check upon\r\nwasteful expenditure, I deprecate the exercise of a meticulous\r\ninterference in administrative details.\r\n\r\nThe secretariat arrangements to be made in connection with the Department\r\nof Law and Justice, will depend on the extent of “temporary reservation”\r\nto be effected. If there is to be the larger reservation, during the\r\ntransition period which I have suggested above, nothing need now be done.\r\nMatters will continue, during that period, on their present footing. If\r\nthere is to be only partial reservation, the portion of the existing\r\noffice staff in Dublin Castle which deals with the unreserved sections can\r\nbe detached for employment under the Minister, who in this case would\r\ndoubtless also hold another portfolio. When the Department is brought\r\nfully under Irish control, there will be found in Dublin Castle gentlemen\r\nspecially competent to give effect to the policy of the Legislature in\r\nthis Department of Irish Government.\r\n\r\nBut, whether the Judicial Department is brought sooner or later under\r\nIrish control, an early opportunity should be taken of reviewing the\r\nentire judicial organization with the view of pruning away redundancies\r\nand placing it on a more economical basis. Few will be found to deny that\r\nthe existing staff of County Court Judges and legal officials of various\r\ngrades is excessive; and no one, with knowledge, will maintain that a\r\nSupreme Court of 14 Judges, costing with their subordinate officers\r\n£181,209 a year, is not too costly for a country with a population of 4-¼\r\nmillions. In the House of Commons Return (Cd. 210 of July, 1911), the\r\nnumber of civil servants of all grades in the Supreme and Appellate Courts\r\nof England (with their 39 judges) is shown as 461, while in the Supreme\r\nand Appellate Courts of Ireland (with their 14 judges) it is shown as 257!\r\n\r\nThe administration of Education is at present distributed between three\r\nBoards and the Irish Government and the circumstances call for drastic\r\nreorganization. The Boards of National and Intermediate Education should\r\nbe abolished, and a Department of Education created under the control of a\r\nMinister responsible to the Irish Legislature. Such a Minister would find\r\nready to his hand an official staff (working under the direction of a very\r\ncompetent “Commissioner of Education”) which will not at the outset\r\nrequire any large increase.\r\n\r\nIn the Irish Council Bill a Committee of Council for Education was\r\nproposed, which provided for the admission of gentlemen not being members\r\nof the Irish Council; the object being to conciliate public feeling which\r\nis notoriously sensitive upon this matter, and to secure special\r\nopportunities for representatives of the various religious creeds of\r\nmaking their views felt. I believe that the liberality of that provision\r\nwas very inadequately understood in 1907; but in the altered conditions of\r\nthe present time, I do not repeat the proposal. The Irish Parliament,\r\nunder the coming Bill, will be a stronger representation of the popular\r\nwill than the Irish Council would have been, at all events, at the outset.\r\n\r\nThis change of administrative control, direction, and responsibility in\r\nrespect of Education will, I trust, have a powerful effect in improving\r\nsecular instruction, which is at present notoriously inefficient; but it\r\nneed not (apart from any declaration of policy by the Irish Legislature),\r\ninvolve any change in the religious aspect of the teaching. Teaching in\r\nIrish primary schools of all creeds is in practice denominational (though\r\nnot so in theory). My hope is that it will remain so. What the change will\r\ninvolve is the control of the Department over the appointment, the\r\npromotion, the removal, the qualifications, and the conditions of service\r\nof every person employed in Irish schools. That is as it should be.\r\n\r\nThe “Endowed Schools” are conducted under schemes which have, I believe,\r\nbeen settled by the Judicial Tribunals, and I do not suggest any\r\ninterference with such schemes, but the efficiency of the secular teaching\r\nin those schools should be subject to the supervision of the Department of\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\nI come next to the Local Government Board, which consists at present of an\r\n_ex-officio_ President (the Chief Secretary) and three members, one of the\r\nthree being Vice-President and the real head of the Board. The appointment\r\nof a Minister, being a member of the Irish Legislature, in place of the\r\n_ex-officio_ President who never sits on the Board, will convert this\r\nBoard into a Department with a responsible Minister in charge. One member\r\nof the Board (not the medical member) may be dispensed with, and the\r\nExecutive Establishment calls for revision. This Board comes into contact\r\nwith the people in many intimate relations of their lives and on its\r\nsuccessful administration will largely depend the popularity of the new\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nThe next Department is the Board of Public Works and Buildings, which at\r\npresent is a Treasury Department independent of Irish control. For the\r\n“Chairman” should be substituted a Minister responsible to the Legislative\r\nAssembly. At present there are three members, but one of these may, I\r\nthink, be dispensed with at once. I look to this Department to confer\r\nbenefits, long delayed, on the country; I would, especially, instance,\r\ndrainage. Ireland stands in need of nothing more than a system of arterial\r\ndrainage carried out on a large scale.\r\n\r\nAt present the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland make recoverable\r\nloans on behalf of the Treasury for land improvement and such like\r\npurposes. In the scheme indicated above, the making of these loans would\r\ncome within the functions of the Finance Department. But the Department of\r\nWorks would naturally be the Treasury’s Agents advising on the necessity\r\nfor such loans and supervising the expenditure of them, when borrowed for\r\nlarge betterment undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe next Department is the Department of Agriculture and Technical\r\nInstruction. In the scheme outlined above Technical Instruction has been\r\nbrought under the Education Department, while the Congested Districts\r\nBoard has been brought under the supervision of the Department of\r\nAgriculture. The Act under which the Department of Agriculture at present\r\nworks provides for two Bodies, to assist and advise the Vice-President,\r\n(who, as in the case of the Local Government Board, is the working head of\r\nthe department)—a Board having a veto on expenditure, and a Council which\r\ngives general advice on policy. Both the Board and the Council were\r\ndevised to supply that popular element in which the system of Irish\r\nGovernment is at present lacking. Under the new dispensation this popular\r\nelement will be amply supplied. Both Bodies will therefore be unnecessary;\r\ntheir continuance would conduce to embarrassment and friction with the\r\nall-controlling Legislature. Both the Council and the Board should be\r\nabolished. The President and Vice-President should also disappear, and in\r\ntheir place should emerge a responsible Minister in charge of the\r\nDepartment. This Department seems to be, after the Judicial Department,\r\nthe most expensively organised in Ireland. It is true that it comprises\r\nsome branches which have elsewhere an independent _status_: but\r\nnotwithstanding this, I am convinced that a revision of its numerous and\r\ncostly establishments is needed in the interests of economy and\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nI have already suggested that the Congested Districts Board should be\r\nrelieved of the duty of purchasing land, the Land Commission being\r\nrequired to make these purchases on requisition from the Congested\r\nDistricts Board. I would add (in accordance with the principle suggested\r\nby paragraph 100 of the Report of the Royal Commission on Congestion in\r\nIreland, (1908)) that the creation of an Irish Legislature destroys the\r\njustification for this Board. The work can be better done by an Executive\r\nAgency working under the control of a Committee of Parliament. But if a\r\nBoard is retained it should not be the large Board we have now. A small\r\nBoard of five will be more conducive to efficiency and far more amenable\r\nto the control of the Legislature. That control I venture to add will be\r\nmost beneficially exercised in bringing about the abandonment of the\r\nCongested District Board’s present policy of spoon-feeding the congested\r\nvillages of the West; and of dealing with them not, to any extent, on\r\neleemosynary principles, but exclusively on those of self-help. The\r\nBoard’s methods of relieving congestion should be assimilated to the\r\npractice of the Land Commission on dealing with congested areas, if men\r\nnow living are to see the end of the Board’s activities.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with Registration, I think it is desirable to bring all kinds\r\nof registration under the control of one Minister, but the work is mostly\r\nof a routine character and a single Minister will doubtless find himself\r\nable to direct this and also the last Department remaining on my list.\r\n\r\nThis Department—for General Purposes—brings together the remaining Boards\r\nand Offices dealing with official work in Ireland; and under it may in\r\nfuture be brought any official business of a temporary character, not of\r\nsufficient importance to be dealt with by a separate Office, but yet of\r\nsuch importance that a vote is taken for it in Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\nI have placed “Fisheries” in this Department because that important\r\nindustry requires more attention than it has hitherto received, or than it\r\ncan receive from the Department of Agriculture. It will also be observed\r\nthat I have placed in this Department the subject of Thrift and Credit\r\nSocieties and Co-operative Banks: thus dissociating them from the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, which deals with them at present but with which\r\nthey have no necessary connexion. They have been made far too much the\r\nbattle-ground of contending parties. Some supervision by the Government\r\nover these co-operative agencies may perhaps be necessary, but they will\r\nflourish most when interference by the Government is least felt.\r\n\r\nIt remains to refer to the position and functions of the Lord-Lieutenant\r\nunder the new dispensation (it is, of course, to be presumed that no\r\nreligious disqualification will any longer attach to the office). On the\r\nassumption that the Executive power will continue vested in the King, all\r\nexecutive acts of the Irish Government must issue by authority of the\r\nLord-Lieutenant through whom will also be communicated the assent to, or\r\nthe withholding of assent from, Acts of the Irish Legislature. The Bill of\r\n1893 (Clause 5 (2)) provided for:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “An Executive Committee of the Privy Council in Ireland to aid and\r\n    advise in the government of Ireland being of such members and\r\n    comprising persons holding such offices under the Crown as His\r\n    Majesty, or if so authorised, the Lord-Lieutenant, may think fit,\r\n    save as may be otherwise directed by Irish Act.”(75)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be desirable that such a Committee of the Irish Privy Council\r\nshould be created to assist the Lord-Lieutenant. But while the majority of\r\nthe Committee should always be composed of Ministers, it would, I think,\r\nconciliate the minority, and otherwise make for efficiency, if some\r\nmembers on the Privy Council Committee, were taken from outside the\r\nGovernment. If the Committee were composed of ten members, seven might be\r\nMinisters, and three members might be taken from outside the Government:\r\nthe decision of the Council would be that of the majority.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am conscious of the fact, that this arrangement may be\r\nobjected to on the ground that it would expose the plans of the\r\nGovernment, in particular cases, to gentlemen who might not be of the\r\nParty in Office. But Privy Councillors are bound by oath to secrecy; and I\r\nthink the danger of a dishonourable betrayal of trust is incommensurate\r\nwith the advantages which this representation of outside feeling on the\r\nCommittee, would bring. Moreover, the Lord-Lieutenant would be free not to\r\nsummon any particular Privy Councillor to a session of the Committee, if\r\nthe Prime Minister objected to his presence. The proceedings of the Privy\r\nCouncil would be secret, and no Minutes of dissent would be recorded.\r\n\r\nI take it that under the coming Bill, the Lord-Lieutenant will have no\r\npower to initiate action otherwise than by suggestion to the Ministers\r\nconcerned, who, may, or may not, act on the suggestion. Ordinarily, the\r\nLord-Lieutenant in Council will accept the Minister’s advice: but when he\r\ndiffers, and persists in differing, he would be bound in the last resort\r\nto refer the matter to the British Cabinet. _Ex-concessis_, all\r\nproceedings of the Irish Legislature or Government will be subject to the\r\nultimate control of the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to provide for the representation of the Irish\r\nGovernment in the Imperial Parliament (a different thing from the\r\nrepresentation of Ireland, which, if the solidarity of the United Kingdom\r\nis to be preserved, must be maintained, though, as I have already said, in\r\na proportion “which should be sensibly less than the proportion existing\r\nbetween British Members and their electorates”). Some Member of the\r\nImperial Parliament must answer for that Government; and the question\r\narises whether the Member should be an Irish Member, designated by the\r\nIrish Government, as its representative, or a British Minister. In view of\r\nthe fact that the Acts of the Irish Government will be subject to the\r\ncontrol of the Imperial Parliament, and must, therefore, come regularly\r\nunder the cognizance of the British Ministry, I suggest that the duty\r\nshould be discharged by the British Home Secretary, pending the time when\r\nthe establishment of the Federal System (Home Rule all round) will call\r\nfor a more far-reaching Parliamentary adjustment.\r\n\r\nIf the Land Commission (Group VII.) be excluded from Irish control, the\r\nnumber of Ministers in charge of departments would be seven, reducible to\r\nsix by giving the portfolios of Groups VIII. and IX. to the same Minister,\r\nand to five if a separate Minister for Law and Justice be not at once\r\nappointed. With the Prime Minister, who might have charge of a department,\r\nor, as in Canada, might be President of the Privy Council, a Cabinet of\r\nseven or six as a minimum number would be composed; and this would seem to\r\nbe an adequate number, at all events to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe general result of the preceding suggestions should be that\r\nresponsibility for every agency engaged in the administration of public\r\nbusiness in Ireland will attach to a particular Minister, responsible to\r\nthe Irish Parliament; that interest in Irish public business will be\r\nenormously stimulated in Ireland, and that a salutary public control will\r\nbe effectively exercised. In particular, it may be expected that public\r\nmoney will be husbanded, and when expended, will be spent to the best\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible within the limits of a paper like this, to enumerate\r\nthe provisions of law, peculiar to Ireland which the organic changes\r\nindicated in the preceding paragraphs may necessitate. An enquiry into\r\nthat matter (as into the redundancy of Judicial, Executive and Secretariat\r\nestablishments) will no doubt be undertaken by the Irish Government on a\r\nsuitable opportunity. But it is probably correct to say that changes of\r\nsubstantive law will not be so much required as changes of practice,\r\nwhereby the administration of the law may be brought more into harmony,\r\nthan it is at present, with popular sentiment.\r\n\r\nIt is always to be remembered that the scheme of Home Rule or Devolution\r\nwhich is advocated in this paper, does not contemplate the creation of a\r\nbody of law for Ireland, different from that prevailing in Great Britain.\r\nIn all matters of _status_, property and personal rights, the laws of the\r\ntwo countries will, I presume, remain identical; and no legislation of a\r\nrestrictive, sectional, or sectarian character will be permissible in the\r\none country, which is not permitted in the other. It is also to be\r\npresumed that the decrees of English Courts will be as enforceable by\r\nIrish Courts and Authorities as they are now, and _vice versa_; and that,\r\nin fact, the Judicial and Executive Organisations will be as available,\r\nunder the new order of things, for carrying on His Majesty’s Government in\r\nboth countries, as they are now.\r\n\r\nIf this be understood, most of the doubts and fears, and forebodings of\r\nevil to come from this extension of Irish Local Government, will, I\r\npredict, be soon dissipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.—The Judicial Committee And The Interpretation Of The New\r\nConstitution. BY SIR FREDERICK POLLOCK\r\n\r\n\r\n“In this [the United States] and all other countries where there is a\r\nwritten constitution designating the powers and duties of the legislative,\r\nas well as of the other departments of the government, an act of the\r\nlegislature may be void as being against the constitution.” So James Kent\r\nwrote in his Commentaries when the foundation of American independence was\r\nstill within living memory, and an observer in search of constitutional\r\nautonomy under the British flag beyond the British Islands would have been\r\ndriven to find his best example in Barbados. Kent continues: “The judicial\r\ndepartment is the proper power in the government to determine whether a\r\nstatute be or be not constitutional”; for the interpretation of the\r\nconstitution which is the supreme law of the land is as much a judicial\r\nact as the interpretation of an ordinary written law. This is the view\r\nmost natural to minds trained in English legal and political tradition. It\r\nwas established in the United States by a decision of the Supreme Court at\r\nWashington early in the nineteenth century, and, though not previously\r\nfree from controversy, has been received ever since; and it has been\r\naccepted by British publicists and lawyers as applicable to the decision\r\nof causes involving constitutional questions throughout the British\r\nEmpire. As Chief Justice Marshall said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “If two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on\r\n    the operation of each. If the courts are to regard the\r\n    constitution, and the constitution is superior to any ordinary act\r\n    of the Legislature, the constitution, and not such ordinary act,\r\n    must govern the case to which they both apply.”(76)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principle, so far as I know, has never been disputed by any English\r\nauthority, but occasions for its application did not often arise before\r\nour own time. In strictness of law the King in Parliament has supreme\r\nlegislative power, as with or without Parliament he has supreme executive\r\npower, in every part of his dominions. But in fact very large powers of\r\ngovernment have been granted in various ways and at various times, and in\r\nthe cases which now concern us are coupled with an effectual\r\nunderstanding, though of a political rather than legal nature, that they\r\nshall not be recalled. It may be observed that a grant of this kind is\r\nquite possible without representative institutions. Extensive powers of\r\ngovernment and jurisdiction, including the highest “regalities” which\r\ncould be granted to a subject, were conferred on individuals by several of\r\nthe early colonial charters. William Penn’s charter is perhaps the best\r\nknown of these, and is a striking example. This, however, is remote from\r\nthe present purpose, as is the still wider subject of the political and\r\nsemi-political authorities granted by charter to the East India Company\r\nand other trading companies. We have now to attend only to the creation of\r\nautonomous powers by statutes of the Imperial Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe accustomed form in such creations is to confer in express words power\r\nto make laws for the peace, order (sometimes “welfare”), and good\r\ngovernment of the territory in question. Within the limits prescribed in\r\nits constitution, legislative power so created is full and perfect. The\r\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council has repeatedly laid down—not for\r\none Dominion only, but alike for British India, Ontario and New South\r\nWales—that it must not be likened to the merely vicarious authority of a\r\ndelegate or agent, and is not to be restrained by the rules applicable to\r\nagency. So far as it extends, it is a plenary power analogous to that of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament itself and not to a ministerial authority which\r\ncannot be delegated; and this applies to the federated units in a federal\r\nsystem no less than to central or unitary legislature.(77) It is,\r\ntherefore, not quite accurate, though useful in the first introduction of\r\nnovices to the subject, to liken the enactments of any such local\r\nlegislature to the by-laws made under statutory authority by a railway\r\ncompany or a town council. Such bodies can make the regulations they are\r\nempowered to make, but cannot delegate the framing of any regulation, or\r\nthe decision of questions arising under it, to the traffic manager or the\r\ntown clerk. But a local legislature, within the limits of subject-matter\r\noriginally fixed, can do all that its creator the Parliament of the United\r\nKingdom could have done. The working safeguard against legislation which,\r\nby improvidence or oversight, would conflict with Imperial requirements,\r\nis the refusal of royal assent by the local Governor on the advice of his\r\nMinisters, or, in the last resort, by the Home Government. Some of the\r\nearlier Acts establishing self-government, following the common form of\r\nthe old colonial charter, provided that local legislation should not be\r\nrepugnant to the laws of England. This might have been held to forbid such\r\nrevolutionary changes as abolishing the publicity of Courts of Justice or\r\ndepriving prisoners of the right to trial by jury. In our own time the\r\nquestion has been raised whether the sacred number of twelve jurymen could\r\nbe reduced by Order in Council in a criminal court established under the\r\nForeign Jurisdiction Acts in an Asiatic country.(78) But in 1865 it was\r\nexpressly declared by the Colonial Laws Validity Act that the enactments\r\nof colonial legislatures should not be called in question for repugnancy\r\nto the law of England in any other sense than repugnancy to some Act of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament or an order made under its authority.\r\n\r\nThese matters are only preliminary to the questions that arise under\r\nfederal constitutions, but they are necessary to be understood if we are\r\nto avoid confusion. In the case of a federated Dominion within the British\r\nEmpire the federal constitution is itself an Act of the Imperial\r\nParliament, and therefore all exercise of legislative power in the\r\nDominion, whether by the central legislature or by that of any constituent\r\nState or Province, must be consistent with its provisions, or otherwise it\r\nwill clearly be invalid to the extent of the repugnancy or excess. Every\r\nsuch constitution has to assign the bounds of central and local\r\nlegislation; in the case of Canada, for example, the field of action open\r\nto the Dominion Parliament at Ottawa and the legislatures of the several\r\nProvinces. In strict legal theory the Confederation Act of Canada or the\r\nCommonwealth Act of Australia can be amended at Westminster like any other\r\nAct of Parliament; but, as in fact these constituent Acts were framed by\r\nCanadian and Australian statesmen, so it is well understood that the Home\r\nParliament will not touch them except at the request of Canada or\r\nAustralia. With such request, there have been amendments and legislative\r\ninterpretations of the Canadian Constitution. If any Act of Parliament\r\nmight be called unconstitutional, uninvited intermeddling with the\r\nconstitution of a self-governing colony would be so. We may pause here to\r\ndraw one immediate consequence. Whenever Home Rule is enacted and\r\nestablished for Ireland, Parliament must harden its heart against all\r\nendeavours, from whatever quarter they may proceed, to obtain any\r\nalteration in the scheme save as it may be required by the regularly\r\nexpressed will of Ireland as a whole. This should be an understanding\r\noutside and above all party divisions, British or Irish; and it is equally\r\nnecessary whether or not a certain number of Irish members continue to sit\r\nat Westminster.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the possible conflicts of legislation under a federal\r\nconstitution. It will be convenient to use the more expressive and\r\ngenerally understood word “State” for the autonomous components of the\r\nfederation. The Canadian term “Province” is prior in time within the\r\nEmpire; but it might be misleading to readers unacquainted with Canadian\r\naffairs, as tending to suggest merely administrative functions like those\r\nof a County Council: a body which has many important duties and some\r\ndelegated legislative authority, but cannot reasonably be called\r\nautonomous. A federal constitution must assign some legislative powers\r\nexclusively to the federal legislature, and it may reserve or assign\r\nothers exclusively to the State legislatures. It may also leave a region\r\nin which the States have power to legislate, but subject to a concurrent\r\nand superior power in the federal authority. This is actually the case in\r\nCanada. Hence questions may arise of a more complicated kind than those\r\nwhich are open under unitary Home Rule; they may nevertheless be\r\ninstructive in simpler cases. The Judicial Committee has deliberately\r\nabstained from laying down any general system of interpretation or any\r\npresumption in favour of extending or limiting the powers of either\r\nFederal or State legislation. It is prepared to take some pains to\r\nreconcile apparently conflicting enactments, but beyond that no precise\r\nmethod can be formulated. The Court must deal with the problem of each\r\ncase on its own merits. “The true nature and character of the legislation\r\nin the particular instance under discussion must always be determined in\r\norder to ascertain the class of subject to which it really belongs.”(79)\r\nAgain: “In performing this difficult duty, it will be a wise course for\r\nthose on whom it is thrown to decide each case which arises as best they\r\ncan, without entering more largely upon an interpretation of the statute\r\nthan is necessary for the decision of the particular question in\r\nhand.”(80) It would seem obvious without argument that the courts of\r\nCanada, Australia, or in the future, Ireland, cannot be bound in any case\r\nto give effect to two conflicting enactments of the local and the central\r\nlegislative bodies at once, notwithstanding that some of the language used\r\nby the Judicial Committee a few years ago, on an appeal from the Supreme\r\nCourt of Victoria, suggests that there is no authority anywhere, short of\r\nan Act of the Imperial Parliament, capable of resolving such a\r\ncontradiction.(81)\r\n\r\nThe question remains what should be the ultimate court of appeal for\r\nquestions of this kind arising under an Irish Home Rule Act. According to\r\nour general forensic habit and tradition, it would be the court to which\r\nappeals are taken in the ordinary course from the Court of Appeal in\r\nIreland, namely the House of Lords. It appears however to have been\r\ndecided that this duty will be more appropriate to the Judicial Committee\r\nof the Privy Council. Now it is high time, for quite independent reasons,\r\nthat these two courts of last resort, which are composed in practice of\r\nthe same, or very nearly the same members, should be merged in a single\r\ntribunal of final appeal for the whole of the British Empire. In the\r\nmeanwhile the only material difference is that when noble and learned\r\npersons are sitting as the House of Lords they can and do express their\r\nindividual opinions in the form of speeches addressed to the House itself,\r\nand when they sit as “their Lordships” of the Privy Council, or “this\r\nBoard,” only one opinion is given as the Judicial Committee’s advice to\r\nHis Majesty. For my part I rather think that the suppression of dissenting\r\nopinions does not work well in cases of constitutional interpretation.\r\nSome decisions of the Judicial Committee within pretty recent memory have\r\nbeen hardly intelligible; one is tempted to conjecture that not all of the\r\nreasons for them commanded unanimous assent, and the reasons to which the\r\nwhole or the greater part of their Lordships could agree were not the best\r\nthat any of them could have given. Separate and dissenting opinions are\r\nfreely given in the Supreme Court of the United States, which has dealt\r\nwith the most delicate constitutional questions ever since its work began.\r\nIf I were an Irishman I think I should prefer the House of Lords to the\r\nJudicial Committee. But, as above said, it is hoped that before very long\r\nthey will cease to be distinct tribunals. Moreover there is a practical\r\nreason, which shall now be mentioned, for making the Judicial Committee\r\nthe final Court of Appeal in this behalf.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the published text of the Bill [cl. 29, sub.-cl. 1] that\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant or a Secretary of State—in ordinary political language\r\neither the Irish Government or the Home Government—may refer a question\r\nwhether any provision of an Irish Act or Bill is constitutional to be\r\nheard and determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. That\r\nCommittee is to decide who are the proper parties to argue the case. There\r\ndoes not seem to be any reason to apprehend that the parties interested\r\nwould make difficulties on the score of expense; they would be either\r\npublic authorities or representative associations. This provision is\r\nreally not a novelty but a special declaration, and perhaps an\r\nenlargement, of the very wide power given by the Act which established the\r\nJudicial Committee in 1833,(82) and empowered the King “to refer to the\r\nsaid Judicial Committee for hearing or consideration any such other\r\nmatters whatsoever as His Majesty shall think fit”: a power more than once\r\nexercised in our own time.(83) It is quite easy, however, for even learned\r\npersons who are not familiar with the practice of the Privy Council to\r\noverlook the existence of this enactment, and therefore the insertion of\r\nan express clause in the Home Rule Bill is judicious. Probably no one will\r\nseriously propose to deprive the Crown, as regards Ireland, of a power\r\nwhich it already has throughout the British Empire. But it is a matter\r\nfrom which party politics ought to be rigorously excluded. It should be\r\nunderstood that the power will not be exercised without a considered\r\nopinion of the law officers, in Ireland or here, that there is a\r\nsubstantial and arguable question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.—Constitutional Limitations Upon The Powers Of The Irish Legislation.\r\nBY SIR JOHN MACDONELL, C.B., LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurities For Religious Freedom\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest before dealing with the safeguards for religious\r\nliberty in Ireland to describe those adopted in other countries. This\r\nsurvey, made in no controversial spirit, may help to give a proper sense\r\nof perspective and proportion. A brief comparative study of the legal\r\nsafeguards for religious liberty may not perhaps help much to inspire the\r\nspirit of charity and toleration, which are its best supports. But we know\r\nour own position better when we know that of others. It is some gain also\r\nto find that others have had the same problems as ours, and have solved\r\nthem with more or less success. Certain fears are much abated when it is\r\nrecognised that it is proposed to make in Ireland an experiment of a kind\r\nwhich has been satisfactorily carried out elsewhere. Political justice has\r\nbeen found, in the countries to which I refer, compatible with religious\r\nfreedom. Why not in Ireland?\r\n\r\nConstitutional Limitations\r\n\r\nI. PROGRESS OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY\r\n\r\nIn most States to-day religious liberty exists with some qualifications—it\r\nis one of the most characteristic features of modern legislation. All\r\nreligious denominations are tolerated; some may be favoured; all are free\r\nso long as they do not come into conflict with generally accepted\r\nprinciples of morality. In most States there is a further advance; we find\r\na tendency, more and more accentuated, towards religious equality; more\r\nand more is it the policy of States to place all religious denominations\r\nupon the same footing. This principle is not carried out completely in all\r\nor indeed in most States. Certain churches are in a special sense State\r\nChurches. In some countries, the churches of large parts of the population\r\nare treated as “recognised churches,” to their advantage and to the\r\nexclusion, it may be, of others. In Austria, for example, there are six\r\nrecognised churches and religious societies; and a similar system exists\r\nin Hungary.\r\n\r\nI do not attempt to analyse the many causes of these movements. The fact\r\nat all events is that, whether as the result of the attrition, everywhere\r\ngoing on, of dogmatic creeds, or of the growth of the spirit of tolerance,\r\nor of indifference, or the rediscovery of charity as a fundamental\r\nprinciple of Christianity, or because toleration is the line of least\r\nresistance, or because it best accords with democracy, almost everywhere\r\nin modern times in Europe and America religious equality seems to be the\r\ncondition towards which States are moving. It is worthy of notice that\r\ncomplete freedom is demanded by many sincere adherents of churches who are\r\nimpatient of State control, and who believe that spiritual life thrives\r\nbest in an atmosphere of freedom. It is the creed, I am inclined to think,\r\nof an ever increasing number that the existence of a free Church in a free\r\nState is to the welfare of both.\r\n\r\nEven where the principle is questioned, practice tends to conform thereto.\r\nReluctantly and grudgingly conceded as a favour, religious toleration\r\nbecomes part of the habitual attitude of mind at first of the more\r\nenlightened and then of ordinary men. The principle of religious liberty\r\nor equality is still disputed by the Church of Rome.(84) The doctrines of\r\nGregory VII. and Innocent III. are still asserted as of old. The syllabus\r\nof Pius IX. condemns the principle of equality as enshrining an error not\r\nless pernicious because common; it is the vain attempt to equalise creeds\r\nincomparable with each other and radically different; such liberty is no\r\nbetter than liberty to err. That is the position taken up in the Papal\r\nSyllabus. But in modern times all churches, the Roman Catholic not\r\nexcepted, have yielded, often insensibly and reluctantly, to the pressure\r\nof facts. The ideal condition may be domination of the church; the\r\npractical problem in adverse circumstances is how to make the best\r\ncompromise. Vatican decrees notwithstanding, the powers which issue them\r\ncannot, and do not, press their claims as they once did. Immutable in\r\ndoctrine, they are found to be adaptive in practice. Churches which\r\nretract nothing alter their practice; they do not escape the influence of\r\nthe age and the country, Ireland not excepted, in which they work.\r\nEverywhere the tendency is towards religious equality; I find abundant\r\nevidence of it even in the policy of the Church of Rome. Many books have\r\nbeen written describing the recent increase of the pretensions of Papal\r\nabsolutism. There exists, so far as I am aware, no complete history of the\r\npolicy pursued by the Church of Rome in countries in which it cannot give\r\nfull effect to its doctrines respecting the true connection between Church\r\nand State. Such a history would reveal the existence and exercise of a\r\nsingularly adaptive power; the growth of a policy suitable for and\r\nacceptable in non-Catholic countries and under democratic rule. In the\r\nwonderfully rich system of the Canon law are devices suitable for all\r\ncircumstances. The Church may promulgate a decree in one country and not\r\nin another; the Tridentine decrees at the close of some four centuries are\r\nnot yet made universally obligatory. It may for centuries leave it\r\nuncertain whether a bull specially assertive of the power of the Church,\r\nis in force in a particular country. The doctrine of the Canon law as to\r\nthe efficacy of customs, and particularly local customs, permits of\r\nvariations in accordance with the necessities of time and place. _Semper\r\neadem_, but elastic and always opportunist—such is the character of the\r\nactual policy of the Church;(85) and there is no reason to think that it\r\nwill be otherwise in Ireland under popular government.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church has lately shown itself accommodating in Germany\r\nin regard to the marriage law. When Dr. Hogan of Maynooth College writes\r\nof “the peaceful character and disposition of the church and her\r\nreluctance to cause any disturbance of the social affairs of States or\r\ncommunities, even where the vast majority of the people are hostile to her\r\nreligious claims”; when he adds “if it can be shown that a new law (the\r\n_Ne temere_ decree) inflicts any serious grievance on Protestants in this\r\ncountry, we are satisfied that due consideration will be given to any\r\nrepresentations which may be made in this matter,” he is borne out by the\r\nrecent policy of his Church, even if one cannot admit the accuracy of his\r\nfurther statement: “Such has always been the policy and practice of the\r\nChurch in this matter.”—(_See_ _Irish Ecclesiastical Record_, February,\r\n1911). The system never breaks, but it bends—bends to the exigencies of\r\nnew situations, and particularly of democratic institutions, such as will\r\nexist in Ireland under Home Rule.\r\n\r\nII. SECURITIES FOR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY\r\n\r\nHow to obtain and still more how to secure such liberty or equality is a\r\nproblem in every modern State. The actual solutions, though many, fall\r\ninto a few groups(86); I enumerate the chief. There are countries with\r\nState Churches in which have gradually been made concessions to other\r\ndenominations. England is the typical example. Religious equality (so far\r\nas it exists) is the result of a long series of measures; the successive\r\nremoval of disabilities of Dissenters and Roman Catholics; of measures\r\nrelating to the tenure of public offices, and as to marriage, or oaths. No\r\none Act states any governing principle. After the fashion of English\r\nlegislation there has been movement from point to point, though, on the\r\nwhole, always, or with few relapses, in modern times, in one direction.\r\nThe securities for equality are found in a long series of individual\r\nstatutes. Such, also, may be said to have been the history of religious\r\nequality in Hungary; as in so many countries there has been a gradual\r\nabandonment of the old maxim _cujus regio, ejus religio_.\r\n\r\nI am concerned with the safeguards for equality within a State, and so I\r\nneed say little or nothing of the Gallican system, which was intended to\r\nsecure liberty against foreign intrusion. It was the liberty claimed by a\r\nchurch, which refused toleration to other denominations; the protests of a\r\nnational Church part of Catholicism against the intrusion of the Papacy;\r\nit was the assertion of claims, which, to quote Saint Simon, “_blessent\r\ndouloureusement la Cour de Rome_”; assertions of the doctrine that the\r\nFrench kings were in secular matters independent of the Pope, and that the\r\nPope’s spiritual authority was limited by the laws of the church. In some\r\ncountries, churches have secured a large measure of religious liberty or\r\nautonomy by means of Concordats with the civil Power. The typical case is\r\nthat of the Catholic Church in France, where such a system may be said to\r\nhave existed from the Concordat of Bologna, concluded between Francis I.\r\nand Leo X. in 1516, until recent times, with the exception of a short\r\nbreak at the Revolution; they may be said to have established an offensive\r\nand defensive alliance between Church and State.\r\n\r\nI come to systems and devices chiefly used in modern times to secure\r\nreligious liberty or equality. They are to be found in particular in\r\ncountries possessing written constitutions. Either they lay down with more\r\nor less clearness principles of religious equality, or, dealing\r\nspecifically with some pressing danger or difficulty, they provide a\r\nsafeguard as to it. The first striking example of this kind of restriction\r\nis to be found in America. Dread of the existence of an established Church\r\nand of its ultimate effects upon republican institutions was shared by the\r\nframers of the United States Constitution and most of the framers of the\r\nStates Constitutions. The provision which Jefferson caused to be inserted\r\nin the Virginia Bill of Rights and the article in the Massachusetts\r\nDeclaration of Rights have been copied with variations by the States.\r\nSpeaking generally, they provide for equality of treatment of religious\r\ndenominations (Stimson, “Federal and State Constitutions,” p. 137). In the\r\nConstitution of the United States there is only one Article on the subject\r\n(Amendment, Article 1). “Congress shall make no law respecting the\r\nestablishment(87) of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”\r\nIn the United States true equality exists; all denominations are treated\r\nalike; the modern tendency towards equality has triumphed as the result\r\npartly of national habits and partly of constitutional restrictions.\r\n\r\nI may here cite one or two examples of modern Constitutions which have\r\nlaid down principles designed to secure religious equality.(88) Naturally\r\nSwitzerland, with its population nearly equally divided into Catholics and\r\nProtestants, has been obliged to deal with this question, and so far as I\r\nam aware, it has done so with success. The principles of religious\r\nequality are embodied in the amended Constitution of 1874. I quote the\r\nchief provisions, because they are on the whole the most complete set of\r\nexisting safeguards which I have found.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “_Article_ 49.—La liberté de conscience et de croyance est\r\n    inviolable. Nul ne peut être constraint de faire partie d’une\r\n    association religieuse, de suivre un enseignement religieux,\r\n    d’accomplir un acte religieux, ni encourir des peines, de quelque\r\n    nature quelles soient, pour cause d’opinion religieuse.\r\n\r\n    “L’exercice des droits civils ou politiques ne peut être restreint\r\n    par des prescriptions ou des conditions de nature ecclésiastique\r\n    ou religieuse, quelles qu’elles soient.\r\n\r\n    “Nul ne peut, pour cause d’opinion religieuse, s’affranchir de\r\n    l’accomplissement d’un devoir civique.\r\n\r\n    “Nul n’est tenu de payer des impôts dont le produit est\r\n    spécialement affecté aux frais proprement dits du culte d’un\r\n    communauté religieuse à laquelle il n’appartient pas. L’exécution\r\n    ultérieure de ce principe reste réservée à la legislation\r\n    fédérale.\r\n\r\n    “_Article_ 50.—Le libre exercice des cultes est garanti dans les\r\n    limites compatibles avec l’ordre public et les bonnes mœurs.\r\n\r\n    “_Article_ 54.—Le droit de mariage est placé sous la protection de\r\n    la conféderation.\r\n\r\n    “Aucun empêchement au mariage ne peut être fondé sur des motifs\r\n    confessionels.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile declaring the principle of liberty of conscience, the Swiss Federal\r\nConstitution permits the cantons to give a privileged position to certain\r\nreligious denominations; they may give them subsidies; they may invest\r\nthem with certain prerogatives denied to other bodies less favoured. For\r\nexample, in Fribourg, the Catholic and the Protestants are put on a\r\nfooting of equality. Owing to the powers possessed by the separate cantons\r\nreligious equality is not so complete as at first sight might seem. No\r\nserious difficulty appears to have been experienced in giving effect to\r\nthe above provisions(89) which are not so complete as those found in the\r\nHome Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nIII. SAFEGUARDS IN COLONIES\r\n\r\nI come to legislation which may seem of a kind more helpful and\r\ninstructive than that of Continental countries. In the British Colonies\r\nthere is no connection between the State and Church. The sole important\r\nexception is in Canada, where “the church can compel by law the payment of\r\ndues by Roman Catholics, and thus obtains great privilege from, while\r\nindependent of, the State.”(90)\r\n\r\nIn framing the Constitution for the Canadian Dominions the religious\r\nquestion chiefly considered related to education; it was deemed necessary\r\nto guard against legislation which might impair existing rights. It was\r\nwith an eye to the possibility of injustice being done to the\r\ndenominational schools that special provisions were inserted in the North\r\nAmerican Act accordingly (30 & 31 Vic., c. 3, 1867, Section 93):\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In and for each province the Legislative may exclusively make\r\n    laws in relation to education, subject and according to the\r\n    following provisions:\r\n\r\n    “(1) Nothing in any such Act shall prejudicially affect any right\r\n    or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any\r\n    class of persons have by law in the province at the union;\r\n\r\n    “(2) All the powers, privileges and duties at the union law\r\n    conferred and imposed in Upper Canada on the separate schools and\r\n    school trustees of the Queen’s Roman Catholic subjects shall be\r\n    and the same are hereby extended to the dissentient schools of the\r\n    Queen’s Protestant and Roman Catholic subjects in Quebec;\r\n\r\n    “(3) Where in any province a system of separate or dissentient\r\n    schools exists by law at the union, or is thereafter established\r\n    by the Legislature of the province, an appeal shall lie to the\r\n    Governor-General in Council from any Act or decision of any\r\n    provincial authority affecting any right or privilege of the\r\n    Protestant or Roman Catholic minority of the Queen’s subjects in\r\n    relation to education;\r\n\r\n    “(4) In case any such provincial law as from time to time seems to\r\n    the Governor-General in Council requisite for the due execution of\r\n    this section is not made, or in case any decision of the\r\n    Governor-General in Council on any appeal under this section is\r\n    not duly executed by the proper provincial authority in that\r\n    behalf, then and in every such case, and as far only as the\r\n    circumstances of each case require, the Parliament of Canada may\r\n    make remedial laws for the due execution of the provisions of this\r\n    section, and of any decision of the Governor-General in Council\r\n    under this section.”(91)\r\n\r\n\r\nLately there have arisen religious difficulties to which this section has\r\nno application. By the Confederation Act (Section 91) the Dominion\r\nParliament has exclusive jurisdiction as to marriage and divorce;\r\njurisdiction which would appear to relate to capacity as to marriage. By\r\nSection 92 in each province the legislature may exclusively make laws as\r\nto “the solemnisation of marriage in the province,” which would appear to\r\nextend to all matters affecting the form and ceremony; a division of\r\npowers certain to produce sooner or later conflicts. Recently the _Ne\r\ntemere_ decree was promulgated in Canada. The effect upon Roman Catholics\r\nhas been considered in what is known as the Hebert case, the chief facts\r\nof which were these: Eugene Hebert and Emma Clouatre, both Roman\r\nCatholics, were married by a Protestant clergyman. The marriage was\r\ndeclared null and void by Archbishop Bruchesi. His decision was confirmed\r\nby Judge Laurendeau. But on appeal it was reversed by Judge Charbonneau,\r\nwho held that any officer qualified by the State to marry persons could\r\nmarry persons of any religious faith; that the _Ne temere_ decree had no\r\nlegal validity and was binding only upon the consciences of Roman\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\nTo quote a report of Judge Charbonneau’s judgment:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I do not think that the Roman congregation ever intended the _Ne\r\n    temere_ Decree to have a civil effect. It applies to Roman\r\n    Catholics only. As for the Archbishop’s nullification, it has the\r\n    same legal effect, but not more than the decree upon which it is\r\n    based. It simply declares that no Catholic marriage ceremony was\r\n    performed.”—(_Globe_, Toronto, February 23rd, 1912.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, there has been no appeal to the Judicial Committee, and\r\nI take it that Judge Charbonneau’s decision is binding in Canada.(92)\r\n\r\nIn the Constitution of the Australian Dominion is a provision similar to\r\nthat quoted above from the Constitution of the United States. (Section\r\n116):\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any\r\n    religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for\r\n    prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious\r\n    test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public\r\n    trust under the constitution.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis enactment, so far as I am aware, has not been the subject of\r\ninterpretation. Religious equality in Australia has virtually no history.\r\n\r\nIV. SAFEGUARDS FOR IRELAND\r\n\r\nI come to the position of things in Ireland. It may be well at the outset\r\nto make clear two points. The first is the present legal status of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church in that country. It is the same as that of any other\r\nvoluntary association; its position theoretically no better and no worse.\r\nIt possesses autonomy; it enjoys freedom as to doctrine and worship; its\r\nconstitution is not interfered with; it regulates clerical education; it\r\nnominates its bishops; it administers its property in its own way.\r\n\r\nIt may thus enjoy immense power, especially if there be no true national\r\nsystem of primary education; it may well be doubted whether it possesses\r\nas much power in any other country as in Ireland. But like other voluntary\r\nreligious associations the Catholic Church is not wholly withdrawn from\r\nthe supervision and control of the Law Courts. A series of decisions of\r\nour highest courts with reference to Churches in Ireland and Scotland, and\r\nthe colonies, have laid down certain principles equally applicable to the\r\nRoman Catholic Church and to all other religious bodies; in particular,\r\nthese principles: that the State can exercise control over all religious\r\nbodies possessing property when it is proved to be contravening its rules\r\nto the injury of members. In the case of societies resting upon a\r\nconsensual basis, Courts of Justice are bound when due complaint is made\r\nthat a member of the society has been injured as to his rights in any\r\nmatter of a mixed spiritual and temporal character, to inquire into the\r\nlaws or rules of the Society.(93) Further the authority of a Church cannot\r\nbe legally used for purposes inimical to the State or contrary to any\r\nstatute. It may make rules for its own members; it cannot enforce them\r\nagainst others; they are invalid against them if contrary to the terms of\r\nany statute. It may, for example, declare that it will not regard a\r\nmarriage with a deceased wife’s sister as valid; it may refuse to\r\nrecognise as members those who so marry. But such rules will not legally\r\ninvalidate a union which a statute has legalised. Probably this has not\r\nalways been fully borne in mind by those who have denounced the\r\npromulgation of the decree _Ne temere_ in Ireland. Resolutions have been\r\npassed against it here and in Ireland. Many Nonconformist bodies have\r\nprotested against the promulgation of the decree in British Dominions. The\r\ndecree is, I think, objectionable for several reasons, and not least\r\nbecause it discourages mixed marriages, an effect which seems to me\r\ndeplorable, for nothing is better calculated to put an end to\r\nuncharitableness and hatred than the frequency of such unions. But while\r\nsuch a decree may do harm, it will have no direct effect except as between\r\nthe members of the Catholic Church _in foro conscientiæ_. The Irish\r\nmarriage law, which with a few exceptions is the same as the English, is\r\nbinding on all Catholics and Protestants. Lord Llandaff who speaks at once\r\nas a lawyer and as a Catholic, puts this point clearly:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The invalidity was that of the sacramental and not of the legal\r\n    marriage, and what the Church said to one of her subjects in such\r\n    circumstances was: ‘You are married; you are a husband; but you\r\n    may not receive the sacrament, and therefore you are in a state of\r\n    sin, and in that sense your marriage in void, according to your\r\n    conscience, though not according to the law.’ ”(94)\r\n\r\n\r\nA movement of retrogression the promulgation of the decree may have been;\r\nbut every religious body must be free to lay down rules as to its\r\nmembership. To quote the letter of the Archbishop of Canterbury of\r\nNovember 8th, 1911, on this subject: “Any branch of the Church of Christ\r\nmust clearly have the power of defining the conditions of membership.”(95)\r\nIt is but fair to remember that the decree _Ne temere_ is part of a\r\nsettled policy. The Church of Rome has often shown its disapproval of\r\nmixed marriages which Benedict XIV. declared “abominable.”(96) It is but\r\nfair also to take note of the plea that this decree is the latest attempt\r\nto secure uniformity in regard to marriage law; attempts which have been\r\npursued since the _Tametsi_ decrees of the Council of Trent. Before the\r\nreform in the marriage law then effected there was much confusion and\r\nlooseness. All that was required for a valid marriage was that the\r\ncontracting parties should express to each other their mutual consent by\r\nwords _de præsenti_; a state of things which favoured fraud and led to\r\nuncertainty. The Tridentine change must appear to most lawyers to have\r\nbeen a great reform; marriage was to be solemnised in the presence of the\r\nparish priest of one of the parties and of two witnesses. But this\r\necclesiastical law is not even now in force in several countries. It was\r\npromulgated in most Catholic countries; it was never promulgated in purely\r\nProtestant countries, or in all countries with a mixed population. It\r\napplied to marriages between two Catholics but not necessarily to mixed or\r\nto Protestant marriages. It might be in force in one part of a country and\r\nnot in another. Thus the _Tametsi_ decree was in force in the greater part\r\nof the province of Armagh since the time of Elizabeth. Not until 1827 was\r\nit promulgated in the province of Dublin. Now we are told that it was to\r\nsecure still further uniformity that the decree _Ne temere_ was published.\r\nIt requires all persons baptized in the Catholic Church, and those who\r\nhave been converted to it from heresy or schism, to marry in the presence\r\nof the parish priest or ordinary of the place in which the marriage is to\r\nbe celebrated, otherwise the Church will regard it as null. If neither of\r\nthe contracting parties is a Catholic the Church recognises the marriage\r\nas valid wherever it is celebrated.(97) How far other motives may have\r\noperated I cannot say; it is only fair to bear in mind that the decree is\r\ndefended as a fresh effort to introduce certainty and definiteness as to a\r\nfundamental institution.\r\n\r\nI may here refer to the fears expressed as to the effects of the decree,\r\n_Motu Proprio, Quantavis Diligentia_ of October 9th, 1911; a decree which,\r\nit is said, might conceivably place every sincere Roman Catholic in\r\nantagonism with his duties to the State. The principle of that decree\r\nseems to me highly objectionable; it is an impossible attempt to revive\r\nthe past; a form of the greatest of all heresies, disbelief in spiritual\r\nforces unsupported by privilege. But here, too, it is well to understand\r\nthe case made by defenders of that decree, and before deploring its\r\neffects in Ireland to be certain that, in the view of the Catholic Church,\r\nit is in force there. When the Church was all powerful, there existed a\r\n_privilegium fori_ according to which no layman could bring a cleric\r\nbefore a lay tribunal; a privilege based upon the words of St. Paul to the\r\nCorinthians who resorted to the Pagan Courts. By various Concordats the\r\nPapacy had agreed to abrogate this right wholly or partly. In some\r\ncountries the privilege had become extinct. In October 1869, was issued\r\nthe bull of Pius IX., _Apostolicæ Sedis Moderationi convenit_ which\r\nappeared to revive the _privilegium fori_. This, however, is denied by\r\nRoman Catholic theologians; according to them where no such Concordat\r\nexists, a custom has grown up that breaches of ecclesiastical immunity are\r\nto be overlooked; in any case it operates only as to canonical\r\noffences.(98) Whether that interpretation is correct or not, I need not\r\nenquire. But obviously such a rule has no legal efficacy; and it would be\r\na strong measure to deny the Church the right to give to its adherents\r\nsuch monitions—for its commands are no more—as it thinks fit.\r\n\r\nV. FUTURE SAFEGUARDS\r\n\r\nIn the Home Rule Bills of 1886 and 1893 were elaborate provisions designed\r\nto secure equality of treatment. Thus the Irish Legislature was prohibited\r\nfrom making any law.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respecting the establishment or endowment of religion, or\r\n    prohibiting the free exercise thereof; imposing any disability or\r\n    conferring any privilege on account of religious belief;\r\n    abrogating or derogating from the right to establish any place of\r\n    denominational education or any denominational institution or\r\n    charity; prejudicially affecting the right of any child to attend\r\n    a school receiving public money without attending the religious\r\n    instruction at that school; or impairing without either the leave\r\n    of Her Majesty in Council first obtained on an address presented\r\n    by the legislative body of Ireland, or the consent of the\r\n    Corporation interested, the rights, property or privileges of any\r\n    existing corporation, incorporated by Royal Charter or local or\r\n    general Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n    (Summary of Clause 4 in Bills of 1886 and 1893.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo comments may be made upon these provisions. They were so minute as to\r\nbe at once a source of frequent irritation and certain to give rise to\r\nfrequent conflicts with the Irish Legislature and as to be calculated to\r\nencourage litigation. Further, they did not specifically deal with the\r\nsubject of marriage, an omission which, in view of the decree _Ne temere_,\r\nseems objectionable. They are replaced by a general clause to the\r\nfollowing effect:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In the exercise of their power to make laws under this Act the\r\n    Irish Parliament shall not make a law so as either directly or\r\n    indirectly to establish or endow any religion, or prohibit the\r\n    free exercise thereof, or give a preference, privilege or\r\n    advantage, or impose any disability or disadvantage, on account of\r\n    religious belief or religious or ecclesiastical status, or make\r\n    any religious belief or religious ceremony a condition of the\r\n    validity of any marriage.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHow far these provisions will be eluded probably no one can say with\r\ncertainty. It is difficult enough to ascertain the present situation in\r\nIreland without attempting to predict with confidence the future.\r\nStatements diametrically opposite are vouched for by persons of equal\r\nexperience and opportunity of knowledge. “Facts” in that country are so\r\nelusive. What is true in the south is fiction in the north, and _vice\r\nversa_. It may be admitted that machinery designed to protect minorities\r\ncounts for less than the spirit actuating those who work it. The greatest\r\nsecurity no doubt for religious liberty would be the presence of a general\r\nspirit of mutual forbearance; militant bigotry could not permanently exist\r\nalongside the prevalence of the spirit of charity; and Ulster, as well as\r\nother parts of Ireland, might make its contribution thereto. Some new\r\nforces there are working for toleration, I believe that they are\r\nincreasing. Among them are these: the action of democratic institutions in\r\nwhich persons of all creeds take part; the prosperity of the country\r\nbringing in its train to all parts of the country new ideas and hopes and\r\ninterests; the performance by Catholics and Protestants of common civic\r\nduties; the constant stream, strongly charged with secular elements,\r\nflowing between Ireland and the United States; the silent influence of\r\nliterature and newspapers permeated by a spirit which no priesthood can\r\nexorcise; the frequency of mixed marriages as proved by the action of the\r\nCatholic Church against them; the existence of urgent political and social\r\nquestions as to which men are not divided according to their religious\r\nbeliefs. These are so many manifestations of the modern spirit, from the\r\noperation of which Ireland no more than any other part of the western\r\nworld can escape. They may prove stronger than legal safeguards.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to measure the relative strength of these influences,\r\nbut I should be inclined to rate highest the ultimate effect of democracy,\r\nand of a Parliament in which must be a Protestant minority powerful by\r\ntheir talents, their wealth and their energy. Democracy has everywhere its\r\nown problems, as engrossing for it as any in which the Church is\r\ninterested. It will solve them in its own way, which may not be always the\r\nChurch’s. “Nothing,” says Mr. Bryce with reference to America, “excites\r\nmore general disapproval than any attempt by an ecclesiastical\r\norganisation to interfere in politics.” Under democratic institutions\r\nthere may be the same results in Ireland. The remodelling of primary\r\neducation will probably be one of the first struggles in which an Irish\r\nParliament will be engaged. The fight will be in the open, which is a\r\nclear gain. The Church may for a time succeed in retaining its present\r\nhold over the schools. It is quite as likely that it will lose ground, and\r\nthat the first Irish Minister of Education will be the first to incur\r\necclesiastical censure. There is much evidence of the growth of a\r\nwidespread toleration extending it may be hoped, to the northeast corner\r\nof Ulster:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Since the Local Government Act of 1898,” writes Mr. Annan Bryce,\r\n    “it has not been found that the priest interferes unless in the\r\n    rare cases where there is a question of personal morality, and\r\n    then not always with success.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opinions of three Lord-Lieutenants upon this point cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “After years of continuous residence in Ireland, watching affairs\r\n    and meeting people of every class and creed, I am profoundly\r\n    impressed with the baselessness of alarm about the consequences of\r\n    Home Rule.\r\n\r\n    “On Home Rule for Ireland, I repeat and emphasise the opinion of\r\n    my former telegrams, especially regarding apprehension of\r\n    religious intolerance.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Spencer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I have had some experience of Ireland, and yet I do not know any\r\n    specific instance where there has been the exercise of religious\r\n    intolerance on the part of the Roman Catholics against their\r\n    Protestant countrymen.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Crewe:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In 1886 and 1893 the animosity between classes, largely agrarian\r\n    in its origin, was far stronger than at present, and the line of\r\n    cleavage roughly followed that of religious difference. But even\r\n    in those days, as I well remember, it was evident that the\r\n    possibilities of intolerance in a self-governed Ireland were\r\n    deliberately and grossly exaggerated, with a party motive. Now,\r\n    when the various classes know each other better, and there is less\r\n    occasion for friction, the attempt to excite religious discord\r\n    will utterly fail, as I firmly believe.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe safeguards provided by the measure deal specifically with the subjects\r\nas to which fears of religious inequality exist: establishment and\r\nendowment, education and marriage; as compared with them, the provisions\r\nin the Canadian and Australian Acts are very imperfect. They guard, in\r\nexplicit terms, against the dangers to religious liberty and equality in a\r\nway in which probably no other Constitution does.\r\n\r\nA necessary supplement to any Legislature with limited jurisdiction is a\r\nCourt of Appeal. Under the proposed constitution, the Irish Courts will be\r\nfree to determine the constitutional character of any measures passed by\r\nthe Irish Parliament; and from their decisions an appeal will lie to the\r\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council, which will decide questions\r\nsimilar to those determined by it with reference to the Canadian and\r\nAustralian constitutions, and by the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nreviewing the constitutional character of State legislation. It may be\r\nsurmised that the Court will be faithful to the principles which it has\r\nlaid down in dealing with the powers of the Parliaments of the Dominions.\r\nIt has not hesitated to interfere in Canada with ecclesiastical sentences\r\nor censure which it believed invalid (see _e.g._, _Brown_ v. _Curé de\r\nMontreal_). It will, we may assume, do likewise in Ireland.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: He who believes in political freedom will believe also that\r\nreligious oppression cannot long co-exist with it. Never, so far as I\r\nknow, has ecclesiastical tyranny been enduring under democratic\r\ninstitutions; and I see no reason why the result should be different in\r\nthe new Ireland which the Land Acts and the Local Government Act have\r\ncreated. Full and free political life is the best, perhaps the only,\r\nsolvent of intolerance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.—Financial Relations(99) BY LORD WELBY\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Channel forbids Union, the Ocean forbids separation. I demand\r\n    the continued severance of the Parliament with a view to the\r\n    continued everlasting unity of the Empire.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTerse words in which a great statesman summed up the relation of Ireland\r\nto England. The Home Rule Bill will give the sanction of law to Grattan’s\r\naphorism. It bids Ireland manage her own affairs, freeing her in her own\r\nhouse from official bondage to an unsympathetic consort. If the Act of\r\nEnfranchisement is drawn in a trustful and large spirit, it will, we may\r\nfeel assured, end the feud of centuries, and create unity where the Act of\r\nUnion has created enmity.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Home Rule is wise in itself, and worthy the statesmanship of\r\na nation always bold in the hour of need, and, as experience of its\r\nworking is gained, it will commend itself more and more to the commonsense\r\nof a practical people, but the immediate success of the first Home Rule\r\nAct will depend greatly on the skill and wisdom with which the details of\r\na complicated measure are devised, facing fairly the financial evils\r\nconsequent on Tory obstinacy, and avoiding, in reasonable degree, offence\r\nto popular prejudice and existing interests.\r\n\r\nThe provisions which will adjust the financial relations between the two\r\nnations are not among the least difficult of those details, and Parliament\r\nmust solve the puzzling problem without delay. It must begin by\r\ntemporarily giving local government in Ireland a fair start at the cost of\r\nthe British tax-payer.\r\n\r\nLet us, in the first place, clear the ground from some doubtful arguments\r\nwhich, used as premises, will probably lead the unwary to false\r\nconclusions. A plea is often put forward that England is a rich country\r\nand Ireland a poor country, and it is argued that identical taxation\r\ntherefore wrongs Ireland. But England is not a rich country, in the broad\r\nsense. It is a country in which there is vast accumulation of wealth, but\r\nin which, also, there is a great mass of poverty—poverty probably\r\nexceeding the poverty of Ireland, and, therefore, identical taxation if it\r\nwrongs the poor of Ireland, wrongs still more the poor of England. Critics\r\narguing from this false premise contend that the extension of the\r\nIncome-tax to Ireland was a wrong, that is to say, the wealthy man living\r\nin Ireland, where living is relatively cheap, ought not to contribute to\r\nthe national expenditure on the same principle as the wealthy man living\r\nin England, where living is relatively dear; or, to put the argument in\r\nanother form, it is sound finance to take Income-tax from a man in\r\nEngland, struggling on a few hundreds a year. It is unsound finance to\r\ntake Income-tax from, say, the profits earned in Ireland by the Guinness\r\nfirm. Nationalists, misled by the plea of Ireland’s poverty, have relied\r\non this argument, and Conservatives also have used it chiefly to discredit\r\nMr. Gladstone, who extended the Income-tax to Ireland; but the argument is\r\nfalse in itself, and cannot be made the basis of sound financial\r\nlegislation. As a matter of fact, taxes on articles of general\r\nconsumption, on the necessaries of life, fall heavily on the poor, and the\r\nargument of over-taxation applies in great degree to the poor in the great\r\ntowns of England, and to the poor in Ireland. If, then, the poor of\r\nIreland are to be relieved, the poor of England must be relieved also, and\r\nidentical taxation would still be the result. The statesman must find a\r\ntruer gauge by which to measure the relative capacity of the two countries\r\nto bear taxation.\r\n\r\nAgain, during the long discussion on financial relations, much time has\r\nbeen wasted in criticising that provision of the Act of Union, which fixed\r\nthe respective contributions of Great Britain and Ireland to the common\r\npurposes of the Empire at the proportion of fifteen and two. That\r\nproportion, in fact, was not exacted, and it may be put aside as\r\ntheoretical.\r\n\r\nA summary of recent financial history in Ireland will enable the reader to\r\nunderstand the circumstances in which Parliament takes up the problem of\r\nHome Rule. Towards the close of the eighteenth century the condition of\r\nIreland was bad. England, selfish to the last degree in her commercial\r\npolicy, treated Ireland as little better than a conquered country, and\r\nruined her commercially and industrially by restrictions on her trade.\r\nProtestants and Catholics joined in patriotic resistance, and wrung at\r\nlast freedom of trade in 1779, and an independent Parliament in 1782.\r\nThenceforward for a time the financial administration of Ireland was\r\nregulated in accord with Irish interest. The country prospered financially\r\nunder the new order. Large sums were spent in promoting agriculture and\r\nmanufactures, and in grants for public works, and the country’s finance\r\nwas restored to order. During the years of peace, 1782 to 1793, Ireland\r\ncontributed on the average £584,000 to military—that is to the common\r\nexpenses of the Empire. The military expenditure of Great Britain in the\r\npeace years, 1786 to 1792, averaged £5,142,000. Ireland was then a most\r\nimportant factor in the State, for the population was to that of England\r\nin the proportion of nearly one to two.\r\n\r\nPitt desired to establish reciprocity between the two countries and at the\r\nsame time to obtain from Ireland a contribution on a fixed principle for\r\nthe Navy, wise proposals worthy of the Minister; but the two Parliaments\r\ncould not agree. That of England bowed to the pernicious claims of\r\nascendancy and to the supposed interests of the commercial classes. Pitt\r\nwas defeated. The French Revolution and a war lasting nearly twenty-two\r\nyears followed, and in the midst of the war broke out the Rebellion of\r\n1798. If the charge of the Irish debt at the outbreak of the war and the\r\naverage civil expenditure of Ireland between 1793 and the Union is\r\ndeducted from the average income of Ireland, the surplus constituted\r\nIreland’s real contribution to the common expenditure and it averaged\r\nabout £900,000 a year. The year 1800 marks a great change of policy. Pitt\r\nput an end to the independent Parliament of Ireland and passed the Act of\r\nUnion, bad in itself, and worse by the means which made it law. It sought\r\nto make the two countries one for all purposes of revenue, and that object\r\nwas kept steadily in view.\r\n\r\nFrom 1800 to 1817 the United Parliament imposed taxes on both England and\r\nIreland, but the Irish Treasury collected the Irish Revenue, defrayed the\r\nlocal expenditure of Ireland as sanctioned by the United Parliament and\r\nremitted the surplus in aid of the war expenditure. The greater part of\r\nthe burthen fell upon Great Britain, but Ireland’s share drained greatly\r\nher resources. Her revenue which had produced £1,837,000 in 1793, reached\r\n£7,305,000 in 1817, an increase of 300 per cent., while her contributions\r\nduring the years of war to the common expenditure calculated on the\r\nprinciple adopted in the preceding paragraph amounted to about £3,000,000.\r\nDuring the same period Great Britain contributed to the war out of revenue\r\nabout £43,000,000 on the annual average.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 the Irish Treasury was abolished, the exchequers of the two\r\ncountries were united, the British and Irish Revenues were paid alike into\r\nthe one exchequer. The Irish local expenditure was defrayed from that\r\nexchequer under the check of the English Treasury, and the United\r\nParliament imposed and repealed Irish taxes. From 1817 for many years\r\nIreland fared badly. Her representatives in Parliament served her ill.\r\nTories, Whigs, and independent members failed alike in making England\r\nunderstand Irish needs, and the British Parliament neglected Irish\r\ninterests. The years between 1817 and 1842 mark the first period of Irish\r\nfinancial history dating from the war. It was a period of stagnation. Both\r\ncountries required time to recover from the calamity incident to war; but\r\nthe recovery would have been more rapid, even under heavy taxation, had\r\nnot progress been retarded by the unwise legislation of protection, which\r\nfettered enterprise and restricted commerce. This evil, however, injured\r\nGreat Britain more than Ireland. In 1824 the separate Customs Departments\r\nof the two countries were abolished. The trade between Great Britain and\r\nIreland was treated as coasting, and from that time no official record has\r\nbeen kept of goods exported from and imported into both countries.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 the taxes levied in England were similar to, but not identical\r\nwith, those levied in Great Britain. Ireland was exempt from many taxes\r\nlevied here, and in some cases, such as spirits, she paid a lower rate of\r\nduty. A period of profound peace enabled the government to remit taxation;\r\nbut those remissions were chiefly made in deference to British interests,\r\nand in making them Irish interests were little considered. The truth of\r\nthis statement is illustrated by the Revenue Returns. The estimated\r\n“_true_”(100) Revenue of Great Britain fell from £51,500,000 in 1820 to\r\n£46,250,000 in 1840, although population, and with it consumption, had\r\nincreased. The “_true_” Revenue of Ireland in the same period rose from\r\n£5,250,000 to £5,500,000. But it must be added that many of the taxes\r\nremitted were taxes _not levied in Ireland_. In respect to them Great\r\nBritain had to a certain extent a claim to prior consideration.\r\n\r\nThe second period of financial history extended from 1842 to 1869, a\r\nperiod of rapid recovery and of great prosperity in Great Britain, but not\r\nso in Ireland. Famine fell upon her in 1846, and thinned her population,\r\nfollowed by emigration, which showed how poverty pressed upon the poor,\r\nwhile the Fenian movement of 1866 showed how widespread was the spirit of\r\nunrest. A highly cultivated Liberal statesman was Lord-Lieutenant during\r\nseveral years of the period. An interesting diary which he kept leaves the\r\nimpression that the leading statesmen of the day were not reading the\r\nsigns of the times, or gauging the gravity of a growing movement. This was\r\nhardly the period to choose for increasing the taxation of Ireland,\r\nnevertheless in 1853 Mr. Gladstone extended the Income-tax to Ireland,\r\ncounterbalancing it in part by the remission of loans granted to Ireland\r\nduring the famine—a very insufficient compensation. But the Income-tax did\r\nnot touch the poor, and as I have pointed out there was no reason why the\r\nwealthy and comparatively well-to-do classes in Ireland should not\r\ncontribute to the public expenditure like their brethren in Great Britain.\r\nThis plea, however, does not extend to the spirit duties which during 1853\r\nMr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli raised to the level of the spirit duties in\r\nGreat Britain. That tax undoubtedly was paid in great measure by the\r\npoorer classes.\r\n\r\nIn one direction there was improvement. In 1842 Sir Robert Peel acceded to\r\npower, and inaugurated at once the policy of liberating trade which has\r\nconferred such benefits on Great Britain, and in a minor degree on\r\nIreland. The era of prosperity which followed the adoption of the Free\r\nTrade policy increased greatly the consuming power of the people, and\r\nenabled Mr. Gladstone to largely reduce duties on the principal articles\r\nof food consumed by the poorer classes. For example, he and his successors\r\nreduced the tea duties from 2s. 2d. to 6d. and abolished the sugar duties.\r\nThis was undoubtedly the true method of remedying the evil which underlies\r\nthe plea that identical taxation wronged Ireland. I have shown that that\r\nevil was caused not by identical taxation, but by heavy taxes on food,\r\nwhich oppressed alike the poor of Ireland, and the more numerous poor of\r\nGreat Britain. The policy adopted met the local grievance, by modifying if\r\nnot removing the general grievance, and this remedy of the general\r\ngrievance was only rendered possible by the growing prosperity of Great\r\nBritain. The poor of Ireland had therefore their full share of the benefit\r\ncaused by the prosperity of Great Britain. The historian must give full\r\nweight to this consideration when he criticises the increase of the Irish\r\nspirit duty. There can be little doubt as to the verdict of history, if\r\nthe choice lies between cheap whisky and dear food on the one side, and\r\ncheap food and dear whisky on the other. Between 1860 and 1900 the Customs\r\nand Excise duties which were reduced exceeded the like duties increased by\r\nsome £22,000,000 a year, and Ireland had her share in the reduction.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 a Committee of the House of Commons inquired into the taxation of\r\nIreland, but it led to no useful result. In other directions the monotony\r\nof neglect continued. The Government and Parliament paid little or no\r\nattention to Irish needs. Ireland was the Cinderella of the three\r\nkingdoms, and fared accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe third period ranged from 1869 to 1896. It might be termed the Home\r\nRule period, for it includes the two Home Rule Bills of Mr. Gladstone, but\r\nit includes also other great measures relating to Ireland. Indeed, during\r\nthe whole period of seventeen years Ireland engrossed, to a great degree,\r\nthe attention of Parliament. The change was very remarkable. Up to 1869\r\nEngland was indifferent to, or bored by, Ireland. She was stupid. She did\r\nnot trouble herself to learn Irish wants, and she could not understand the\r\nspirit of Irish nationality. The Devon Commission, a Conservative\r\nCommission, appointed by a Conservative Minister, Sir Robert Peel,\r\nreported that 2,500,000 people in Ireland were on the verge of starvation,\r\nand gave warning of the evils, the perils, inherent in the Irish land\r\nsystem. England took no notice of either warning. The famine answered the\r\nfirst in cruel fashion. The second was pigeon-holed. Wise in her own Home\r\nadministration, wise of late years in her Colonial administration, she\r\nknew no remedy for Ireland but force, and force is no remedy. She\r\naccepted, almost as matters of ordinary administration, Coercion Acts\r\nwhich marked with a black stigma most years of the century, unable to see\r\nthat that fact alone was a disgrace to her statesmen, her Parliament, and\r\nher people.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Home Rule days I heard a great English statesman say: “The\r\nfirst duty of a Government is to bring the people into agreement with the\r\nlaw; till it does that it fails in its first duty, and England has\r\nhitherto failed to bring Ireland into agreement with the law”—a truth well\r\nand forcibly expressed.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 a man of great power and eloquence, wide views, and firm resolve\r\nbecame Prime Minister. He realised the habitual injustice of England to\r\nIreland, and he saw the perils impending. By his strength of will he\r\nforced an unwilling country and an indifferent Parliament to devote its\r\nserious attention to Irish questions. He disestablished the Church. He was\r\ndefeated on Irish education, but he laid the foundation of a land\r\nsettlement by conferring on the tenants, in spite of strenuous opposition\r\nfrom the Tories, the rights of fair rents, fixity of tenure, and free\r\nsale, and his measures were marked by an earnest desire to deal liberally\r\nwith Ireland to the utmost extent consistent with equity to the British\r\ntax-payer. Finally, when Ireland sent to Westminster more than four-fifths\r\nof her representatives pledged to Home Rule, he accepted this expression\r\nof the national will, and became a convert to the principle of Home Rule.\r\nI deal later in detail with his two Home Rule Bills of 1886 and 1893,\r\nwhich were defeated, and I need only here deal with finance of the third\r\nperiod, apart from the provision of the Home Rule Bills.\r\n\r\nBefore Mr. Gladstone was converted to Home Rule, Home Rule finance\r\nattracted little attention. That eminent statistician, Sir Robert Giffen,\r\nmade, indeed, in 1885, a singular suggestion to the _Statist_ newspaper,\r\nviz., that the Irish landlords should be bought out at the cost of the\r\nImperial Exchequer, and that the rent charge, which would then be payable\r\nby the purchasing tenant, should be given to an Irish authority, in lieu\r\nof payments from the Exchequer, for the internal administration of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir Robert wrote an article in the _Nineteenth Century Review_,\r\nMarch, 1886, a few weeks before the introduction of the first Home Rule\r\nBill, to show how unimportant, from a financial point of view, Ireland had\r\nbecome to us, and to suggest the expediency of devising some form of\r\nGovernment under which the special needs and circumstances of that country\r\nwould receive more and better attention than they did under the existing\r\narrangements. His figures might be, in some instances, doubtful, perhaps\r\neven incorrect, but it can hardly be denied that he made good his point.\r\nSir Robert was, we see, greatly in advance, not only of the ordinary\r\nBriton, but of financial experts generally, both as regards the land\r\nquestion and also that of the Government of Ireland.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most able thinker and writer on economic questions in the\r\nsecond half of the nineteenth century was the late Mr. Bagehot, and, in\r\nproof of the general indifference to Irish questions in England, it is\r\nnotable that his collected works, ranging over a wide field in politics\r\nand literature, contain no paper on the government or condition of\r\nIreland. Yet he had witnessed O’Connell, the famine, the depopulation of\r\nIreland, the Committee on Irish Taxation, and the Fenian outbreak in 1866.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mr. Goschen, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Conservative\r\nGovernment, moved for a Committee of the House of Commons to consider the\r\nfinancial relations of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The Committee was\r\ninstructed to inquire into the equity of their financial relations in\r\nregard to the resources and population of the three kingdoms. It had\r\nhitherto been much discussed whether Ireland could be regarded as a\r\nseparate financial entity from the rest of the kingdom. The Irish Taxation\r\nCommittee of 1864, of which Sir Stafford Northcote and Mr. Lowe were\r\nprominent members, had refused to admit the principle of such separate\r\nentity, and that had been generally the Conservative contention. But, in\r\nthe reference to the Committee of 1890, the Conservative Government\r\naccepted the principle. The Home Rule Bills of 1886 and 1893 were, of\r\ncourse, based upon it. Thus, 1890 marks an important advance in the\r\ndiscussion, and thenceforward, by consent of both parties, the separate\r\n“entity” was established.\r\n\r\nAfter the rejection of the second Home Rule Bill the Liberal Government\r\nappointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the financial relations of\r\nthe two countries and their relative taxable capacity. The Report of this\r\nCommission deserves attention, because it was exhaustive in its inquiries,\r\nbecause the information it laid before the public has since that time been\r\ngenerally used in discussion, and because many of the recommendations made\r\nwere far-reaching and suggestive. There was, as might be expected, great\r\ndifference of opinion. The Conservative members and the Nationalist\r\nmembers made their several Reports. Attention, however, may be directed to\r\none of the Reports, because it received the concurrence of the Nationalist\r\nmembers and of three English members—one of whom was a very high, if not\r\nthe highest, financial authority in the City of London, the two others\r\nretired Civil Servants who had been at the head of two great Departments\r\nof the State. Their conclusions were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “(1) That Great Britain and Ireland must, for the purpose of this\r\n    inquiry, be considered as separate entities.\r\n\r\n    “(2) That the Act of Union imposed upon Ireland a burthen which,\r\n    as events showed, she was unable to bear.\r\n\r\n    “(3) That the increase of taxation laid upon Ireland between 1853\r\n    and 1860 was not justified by the then existing circumstances.\r\n\r\n    “(4) That identity of rates of taxation does not necessarily\r\n    involve equality of burthen.\r\n\r\n    “(5) That whilst the actual tax revenue of Ireland is about\r\n    one-eleventh of that of Great Britain, the relative taxable\r\n    capacity of Ireland is very much smaller, and is not estimated by\r\n    any of us as exceeding one-twentieth.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three English members above mentioned presented a separate Report,\r\nrecording at length their views on the questions referred to the\r\nCommission. I call attention to it, because reference is frequently made\r\nto it in the Report of Sir Henry Primrose’s Committee, recently appointed\r\nto advise the Government upon the new Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nThey pointed out that the whole taxation of Ireland increased from\r\n£2,900,000 in 1820, to over £6,600,000 in 1893, and that by far the larger\r\npart of this increase was derived from taxes on articles of consumption\r\nwhich fell most heavily on the poor; that the increase resulted only\r\ntemporarily in an increase in the contribution to common expenditure which\r\nrose from £3,691,000 in 1820 to £5,396,000 in 1860, to fall to £1,966,000\r\nin 1893, for the greater part of the increase had been absorbed in\r\nincrease of Irish civil expenditure. This local expenditure amounted in\r\nIreland to 19s. 7d. per head, while in Great Britain it only amounted to\r\n11s. 9d. If the cost of administering Ireland had been reduced to the like\r\ncost in Great Britain, a saving of nearly £2,000,000 would have been\r\nrealised.\r\n\r\nThey thought that the expenditure in Ireland was conducted on a scale\r\ntotally unsuitable to that country, that the industrial taxation, borne in\r\nIreland mainly by the consumers of dutiable articles, was heavier than the\r\nmasses of the Irish people ought to bear, that Irish taxation ought not to\r\nexceed one twentieth part of taxation of the United Kingdom, but they\r\ndoubted whether Great Britain would consent to alter her whole system of\r\ntaxation to meet the evil to Ireland. They objected totally to seeking a\r\nremedy in increased grants and doles, and they suggested that Ireland\r\nshould levy her own taxes and provide for her own expenditure.\r\n\r\nLastly, in answer to the objection that Ireland might impose new Customs\r\nduties, they held that to be unlikely, since Ireland rather than Great\r\nBritain would suffer by such a policy, because the market of Great Britain\r\nis of greater importance to Ireland than that of Ireland to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Commission reported in 1896. The question of the financial\r\nrelations remained then in practical abeyance till 1907. In that year the\r\nGovernment of Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman proposed to establish an Irish\r\nCouncil under the Lord-Lieutenant entrusted with the control and direction\r\nof certain administrative Departments. A sum was to be charged on the\r\nConsolidated Fund to enable the Council to meet the expenditure of the\r\ntransferred Departments. This sum was fixed for the first five years at\r\n£4,164,000. This was simply a measure to decentralise administration, and\r\nto admit Irishmen to a share in Irish administration. It did not, however,\r\nobtain support in Ireland, and in consequence it was not pressed.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the last stages in the story of Irish finance. The\r\nGovernment of Mr. Asquith decided to introduce the Third Home Rule Bill in\r\nthe session of 1912, and in 1911 they appointed a Departmental Committee\r\nunder Sir Henry Primrose to advise them. The able report of that Committee\r\nhas been laid before Parliament, and it brings our information on the\r\nfinancial relations up to the latest date:\r\n\r\nThey state the “true” Irish Revenue in 1895-6 to have been £8,034,000.\r\n\r\nThey estimate “true” Revenue 1910-11 at 10,300,000.\r\n\r\nIncrease £2,266,000.\r\n\r\nThe “true” local expenditure in Ireland, 1895-6, £5,938,000.\r\n\r\nThe “true” local expenditure 1910-11, 11,344,000.\r\n\r\n£5,406,000.\r\n\r\nThus whereas Ireland in 1895-6 made a contribution of £2,066,000 to\r\nImperial Expenditure, in 1910-11, not only did she make no contribution to\r\nImperial Expenditure, but the British taxpayer was called on to contribute\r\nmore than £1,000,000 towards Irish local expenditure. But Irish local\r\nexpenditure is increasing under the heads of old-age pensions, land\r\npurchase, and expenses of the Government which will be established in\r\nIreland under Home Rule. The Committee in consequence estimate:\r\n\r\nThe Irish local expenditure in 1913-14 at £12,400,000.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Revenue at 10,350,000.\r\n\r\nDeficit £2,050,000.\r\n\r\nfor which provision must be made in the forthcoming measure.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the existing deficit, the Committee suggest that the\r\nBritish Exchequer should take over liability for all old-age pensions\r\nwhich had been actually granted at the date when the Home Rule Bill comes\r\ninto operation. They estimate that liability at £3,000,000 a year,\r\ngradually, of course, diminishing. If necessary, the liability in whole or\r\npart of the Irish Constabulary Pensions (£400,000) might also be\r\ntransferred to the British Exchequer. They advise that the obligation of\r\nIreland to contribute to the Imperial expenditure should be affirmed, but\r\nthat a settlement of the amount of the contribution should remain in\r\nabeyance; and lastly, that the guarantee of the Imperial Exchequer in\r\nrespect of the Land Stock should remain, but that means should be taken to\r\nsecure regular payment of the sum due from Ireland to the National Debt\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\nI shall contrast later the recommendations of the Committee with the\r\nactual provisions of the Home Rule Bill.\r\n\r\nI will now compare the finance of the three Home Rule Bills which have\r\nbeen submitted to Parliament, those of 1886, 1893 and 1912.\r\n\r\nTHE BILL OF 1886\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone made it an essential condition of his plan that there should\r\nbe an equitable distribution of Imperial charges and that Ireland should\r\npay her fair proportion to the common expenses of the Empire. In 1885 that\r\ncontribution was represented by the surplus of Irish Revenue remaining\r\nafter deduction of the expenditure in Ireland on Irish services. He\r\ncalculated in 1886 that the surplus above described provided a\r\ncontribution by Ireland to Imperial expenditure equivalent to £2 where\r\nGreat Britain contributed £23. This proportion contrasts with Mr. Pitt’s\r\narrangement in 1800 that Ireland should pay £2 where Great Britain paid\r\n£15. Mr. Gladstone proposed in future that where Great Britain paid £28,\r\nIreland should pay £2, a concession of moment to Ireland, and he supported\r\nit on the following ground: he measured the taxable capacity of the two\r\ncountries by (1) the Income-tax returns (2) the death duty returns, and\r\n(3) the valuation of property. Income-tax gave a proportion of £38 to £2,\r\nbut he held Income-tax an imperfect test, because it was paid in Ireland\r\non a lower valuation than in Great Britain and because many Irishmen\r\nreceive dividends on securities which pay Income-tax in England. He\r\nthought that £34 to £2 would be nearer the true proportion. He held the\r\ndeath duties to be a better test and they showed a proportion of £26 to\r\n£2, while the valuation, lower in Ireland than in Great Britain, gave a\r\nproportion of £24 to £2. Arguing from these premises, he held that his\r\nproposed contribution of £2 to £28 was an equitable and even a generous\r\narrangement, justified by the necessity of starting the Irish Legislative\r\nbody with a balance to its credit.\r\n\r\nA table is given showing how the contribution was appropriated.\r\n\r\nThe amount to be contributed by Ireland to Imperial expenditure being thus\r\nascertained, the more difficult part of the problem remained, viz., how to\r\nprovide the fund out of which the contribution would be payable and how to\r\nsecure its payment. The plan which commended itself to him as insuring the\r\nfiscal unity of the three kingdoms, and giving absolute security to the\r\nBritish Exchequer, left the imposition and collection of Customs and\r\nExcise duties with the Imperial Government, and under Imperial control.\r\nThis plan was to be carried into effect in the following manner. The\r\nCustoms and Excise were to be levied under Acts of the Imperial\r\nParliament, and were not to be subject to the control of the Irish\r\nLegislature. The Irish Legislature with that exception could impose taxes\r\non Ireland. Under the Land Purchase Bill, which was to be introduced\r\nconcurrently with the Home Rule Bill, a Receiver-General was to be\r\nappointed, into whose hands the Customs and Excise Duties and other taxes\r\nwere to be paid, including taxes imposed by the Irish Parliament. The\r\nImperial Receiver-General, having thus in hand all Imperial and local\r\ntaxes levied in Ireland, would in the first instance pay out of them the\r\nImperial charges. Apart from the Imperial charges there were other\r\ncharges, strictly Irish, such as Judges’ salaries, pensions, the salaries\r\nof existing civil servants, for the security of which the Bill provided.\r\nThe Bill bound the Irish Parliament to impose taxes sufficient to meet\r\nsuch charges, and ordered them to be paid by the Receiver-General. The\r\nReceiver-General was to keep an Imperial and an Irish account. The Irish\r\ncharges would of course be paid from the latter account. He was to carry\r\nthe Customs and Excise Duties in the first instance to the Imperial\r\naccount, and the local taxes to the Irish account, transferring to the\r\nIrish account the surplus of Custom and Excise, after payment of the\r\nImperial contribution. He was subsequently to pay the balance remaining on\r\nthe Irish account to the Irish Exchequer.\r\n\r\nAn Imperial Court of Exchequer was established in Ireland to watch over\r\nthe observance of the Act, and all Revenue acts were to be tried and\r\ndefaults punished in that Court. The Bill further enabled the Irish\r\nParliament to take over the Irish Post Office, if it should so desire,\r\nthough it was Mr. Gladstone’s opinion that it would be for the convenience\r\nof both countries if the Post Office were to remain under the control of\r\nthe Postmaster-General.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial contribution payable by Ireland was not to be increased for\r\nthirty years, though it might be reduced if the Imperial charge for Army,\r\nNavy and Imperial Civil expenditure for any year should be less than\r\nfifteen times the contribution paid by Ireland. In that case one-fifteenth\r\nof the diminution could be deducted from the Imperial contribution.\r\n\r\nExisting Civil Servants were retained in their offices at existing\r\nsalaries. If the Irish Government were to desire their retirement, they\r\nwould be retired on pensions. On the other hand, if at the end of two\r\nyears the officers themselves desired to retire, they could do so,\r\nreceiving pensions on the usual abolition of office scale.\r\n\r\nSupposing the Home Rule Bill to have become law the account of Irish\r\nfinance would have stood thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n    Imperial taxes:\r\n      Customs  £1,880,000\r\n      Excise   £4,300,000\r\n      Total  £6,180,000\r\n\r\n    Local taxes:\r\n      Stamps  £600,000\r\n      Income-tax 6d.  £550,000\r\n      Total  £1,150,000\r\n\r\n    Non-tax revenue:\r\n      Post Office  £1,020,000\r\n\r\n    Total: £8,350,000\r\n\r\n    EXPENDITURE.\r\n    Contributions to Imperial expenditure on basis of one-fifteenth of\r\n    Imperial expenditure:\r\n      Debt charges  £1,466,000\r\n      Army and Navy   £1,666,000\r\n      Civil charges  £110,000\r\n      Total  £3,242,000\r\n\r\n      Sinking Fund on one-fifteenth of capital of debt  £360,000\r\n      Constabulary(101)  £1,000,000\r\n      Local Irish Civil charges  £2,510,000\r\n    Collection of revenue:\r\n      Imperial taxes  £170,000\r\n      Local taxes  £60,000\r\n      Non-tax revenue  £604,000\r\n      Total  £834,000\r\n    Surplus  £404,000\r\n    Total  £8,350,000\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it is said that in 1885-1886 Ireland was paying to Imperial\r\nexpenditure in the proportion of £2 to £23, that proportion was calculated\r\non the whole gross Imperial expenditure, whereas Mr. Gladstone calculated\r\nthe proportion of £2 to £28 on a military expenditure materially cut down,\r\nfor he excluded from it charges which ought strictly to be called war\r\ncharges, a modification very favourable to Ireland and reducing\r\nconsiderably her true contribution.\r\n\r\nHe made another concession of great importance. He proposed to credit\r\nIreland with the entire receipts levied in Ireland, but that was not a\r\ntrue test of the amount of taxation paid by Ireland. There are goods which\r\npay duty in Great Britain, but which are consumed in Ireland, so\r\nconversely there are goods which pay duty in Ireland but are consumed in\r\nGreat Britain. For instance, spirits, porter, and tobacco are largely\r\nexported duty paid from Ireland and are consumed in Great Britain, and Mr.\r\nGladstone calculated that the excess of duties so paid in Ireland on goods\r\nconsumed in Great Britain amounted to no less a sum than, £1,400,000 a\r\nyear. That is of course British Revenue, and in striking a true account\r\nbetween the two countries it should be credited to Great Britain, not to\r\nIreland. The Home Rule Bill, however, gave it to Ireland, a direct grant\r\nof £1,400,000(102) from Great Britain to Ireland, and if that amount be\r\nsubtracted from the contribution of £2 to £28, it leaves the proportion £2\r\nto £52 instead of £2 to £23.\r\n\r\nIf we strike a balance between the contributions to be paid by Ireland to\r\nGreat Britain under the Home Rule Bill, and the grants to be paid to\r\nIreland, we shall arrive at the following result:\r\n\r\nContribution from Ireland to Great Britain     £3,602,000\r\nGrants from Great Britain to Ireland:\r\nDuties paid in Ireland on goods consumed in Great Britain\r\n            £1,400,000\r\nGrant toward the Constabulary     £500,000\r\nTotal: £1,900,000\r\n\r\nNet contribution from Ireland to Imperial purposes (or nearly in the\r\nproportion of 2 to 60)  £1,702,000\r\n\r\nIf the Imperial contribution _actually_ paid by Ireland in 1885 be equated\r\non like principle, the proportion stated above at 2 to 23 will be\r\nsimilarly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe Bill was defeated in the House of Commons, and therefore its\r\nprovisions did not undergo the test of scrutiny in Committee.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of this Bill illustrate the difficulties which attend the\r\nfinancial severance of the Irish from the British Government. High\r\nauthorities thought at the time that Mr. Gladstone, in 1886, should have\r\nproceeded in the first instance by way of Resolutions establishing the\r\nprinciples upon which the Bill would be subsequently founded, and there is\r\nmuch to be said for that view. The main principles of the measure would\r\nhave been established in the first instance after free and full\r\ndiscussion, and the details would have been adapted later to the\r\nprinciples then laid down. Mr. Gladstone himself, in his reply upon the\r\nSecond Reading (June 7th, 1886,) indicated a course somewhat similar in\r\nits result. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “If an interval is granted us, and the circumstances of the\r\n    present session require the withdrawal of the Bill, and it is to\r\n    be re-introduced with amendment at an early date in the autumn, it\r\n    is our duty to amend the Bill with every real amendment and\r\n    improvement, and with whatever is calculated to make it more\r\n    effective and more acceptable for the attainment of its end.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that there had been no sufficient time for the\r\ncollection of the data on which an effective measure could be founded, and\r\nthe collection of those data was a task of great difficulty, for the\r\nDepartments did not possess them. The Government came into power in\r\nFebruary, and the Bill was introduced on April 6th; thus there was no real\r\nopportunity for testing the value of the data collected in that short\r\ninterval, or for gauging beforehand objections both to the principles and\r\ndetails of the scheme adopted, and experience proved that some of the\r\nobjections were valid, though probably not insurmountable.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was based on two principles which would be especially liable to\r\ncriticism:\r\n\r\n(1) For thirty years Ireland was to contribute to Imperial charges as they\r\nthen existed a fixed annual sum.\r\n\r\n(2) The Customs and Excise duties as _collected_ in Ireland (_i.e._, not\r\nthe “true” revenue) were to be credited to the Irish Government.\r\n\r\nThe first of these principles would have been closely scrutinised in\r\nCommittee, but probably in the main it could have held its ground. In the\r\nfirst place, it reduced considerably the Imperial contribution, consisting\r\nhitherto of the balance of revenue after payment of Irish charges. As Mr.\r\nGladstone pointed out, the amount of military expenditure, on which the\r\nproportion of 2 to 28 was calculated, was considerably reduced, and Great\r\nBritain had to pay the difference, and so far the change was favourable to\r\nIreland. In the second place, Irish expenditure was increasing, and under\r\nthe existing system the balance of Irish revenue, constituting the Irish\r\nImperial contribution, was, as the sequel lamentably proved, diminishing,\r\nand, a result not foreseen at the time, the wasteful and unsound finance\r\nwhich financial partnership entailed upon Ireland ere long extinguished\r\nit. The grant of autonomy was an effective check on this continued waste,\r\notherwise the contribution of a fixed quota would soon have reduced the\r\nIrish Government to insolvency.\r\n\r\nThe grant to Ireland of the _collected_ not the _true_ duties of Customs\r\nand Excise was open to grave objection. It presented her with the duties\r\nlevied in Ireland on articles consumed in Great Britain, but if at any\r\ntime the habits of the people, such as decrease in drinking, reduced this\r\npractical gift—estimated at £1,400,000, or if changes in law or practice\r\ntransferred the payment of these duties from Ireland to Great Britain, the\r\nfinancial equilibrium of the scheme would be destroyed. This was a real\r\ndanger as under the bonding system the British trader could, if he\r\npleased, pay these duties in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe decision that Ireland was not to be represented at Westminster led to\r\na clumsy device for giving Ireland a voice in the Imperial Parliament when\r\nIrish interests were involved. This would be the resource if a war\r\ncontribution had to be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of 1886 can only, therefore, be regarded as a draft to be\r\ntested and modified in discussion and to form the basis of a revised and\r\namended scheme.\r\n\r\nTHE BILL OF 1893\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone introduced the second Home Rule Bill in February, 1893. In\r\nthe discussion he pointed out how incredibly wasteful the method of\r\ngoverning Ireland was; the Irish Civil Government grants, which had\r\naveraged from 1833 to 1837 £762,000, had risen between 1888 and 1892 to\r\n£4,042,000, and the cost of local government in Ireland was twice as much\r\nper head as the like cost in England.\r\n\r\nUnder the scheme of 1886 Irish representatives were not to sit in the\r\nImperial Parliament, but the Government found that under existing\r\nfinancial arrangements there must be financial connection, unless\r\nParliament was prepared to face a different system of trade laws between\r\nthe two countries, and provision must be made for that connection. Mr.\r\nGladstone, therefore, reversed the decision of the Government in 1886. He\r\nproposed to retain Irish representatives at Westminster, reduced in number\r\nto 80. They were not to vote on purely British questions, but in his\r\nopinion it would be difficult to make that distinction as far as the mass\r\nof business was concerned. The Irish representatives would not vote on any\r\ntax which was not to be levied in Ireland or on any grant of money for\r\nother than Imperial purposes as scheduled in the Bill. By this means\r\nIreland would have a voice, if emergency, such as war, rendered fresh\r\ntaxation necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the interval between 1886 and 1893 knowledge had been gained to some\r\nextent as to what constituted the “true” revenue of Ireland, and the\r\nInland Revenue thought it possible to levy in Great Britain the Excise\r\nduties collected in Ireland on articles consumed in Great Britain and\r\n_vice versa_. These Excise duties represented the greater part of the sum\r\nof £1,400,000, previously described as the difference between duties, so\r\nto speak, belonging to Ireland and duties collected in Ireland, a\r\ndifference estimated in 1893 at £1,800,000. If Ireland retained that\r\ndifference, as contemplated by the scheme of 1886, it was equivalent to a\r\ngrant from Great Britain to Ireland. On the other hand the Customs were\r\nnot able to make the separation thought possible by the Excise.\r\n\r\nWith these facts before him Mr. Gladstone made an entire change in the\r\nfinancial scheme. As in 1886, he held that Ireland must make a proper\r\ncontribution to Imperial expenditure, but he abandoned the principle,\r\nadopted in 1886, of obtaining that contribution by a quota of\r\none-fifteenth of Imperial expenditure, that is a contribution of £2 by\r\nIreland to £28 by Great Britain. He retained instead the whole of the\r\nCustoms revenue collected in Ireland as the Irish contribution. He\r\nproposed that Great Britain should pay any excess of the charge of\r\nconstabulary over £1,000,000, out of the contribution, the balance\r\nrepresenting Ireland’s share of Imperial expenditure. He justified the\r\nchange on the ground that as the management of trade was reserved to the\r\nImperial Government, the management of the Customs so closely connected\r\nwith trade should be Imperial also. The Customs were expected to produce a\r\nnet revenue of £2,370,000. He estimated it as equivalent to about 4 per\r\ncent. of Imperial expenditure whereas the actual contribution was about 12\r\nper cent. The contribution would, of course, vary as the net Customs\r\nrevenue rose or fell. On the other hand the Irish Government were to take\r\nall the rest of the “true” revenue of Ireland and to defray out of it all\r\nlocal Irish expenditure, including a fixed sum of £1,000,000 towards the\r\ncost of the constabulary and Dublin police, which were temporarily to\r\nremain Imperial services. Customs and Excise duties were to be regulated\r\nand collected by the Imperial authority which was also to fix postal\r\nrates; but all other taxes were to be imposed by the Irish Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe interests of existing judges, and existing civil servants, and of her\r\nconstabulary, which remained under the control of the Viceroy, were\r\nsecured. The constabulary would be gradually replaced by a force under the\r\ncontrol of the Irish authority. Two Exchequer Judges would be appointed to\r\nguard observance of the Act, and appeals lay to the Privy Council which\r\nwould try on the motion of the Viceroy, or of the Secretary of State, any\r\nquestion as to invalidity of an Irish Act. These arrangements might after\r\nfifteen years be subject to revision in pursuance of an address to Her\r\nMajesty from the House of Commons or the Irish Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe receipts and expenditure of the Irish Government under this scheme\r\nwould have stood as follows:\r\n\r\nRECEIPTS.\r\n(1) Excise true revenue exclusive of licences  £3,220,000\r\n(2) Local taxes:\r\n  Stamps, Income-tax, Excise licenses  £1,495,000\r\n(3) Postal revenue  £740,000\r\n(4) Other non-tax revenue   £205,000\r\nTotal £5,660,000\r\n\r\nEXPENDITURE.\r\n(1) Civil Government charges, except Constabulary   £3,210,000\r\n(2) Collection of Inland revenue  £160,000\r\n(3) Postal service  £790,000\r\n(4) Contribution to Irish Constabulary  £1,000,000\r\nTotal  £5,160,000\r\nSurplus  £500,000\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed the House of Commons, but the financial clauses were\r\ngreatly recast in Committee. The changes originated in the fact that the\r\nInland revenue had overestimated the “true” revenue of Excise by a very\r\nconsiderable sum, and the error would have reduced to an insignificant sum\r\nthe free starting balance for the Irish Government provided in the\r\noriginal scheme. Mr. Gladstone decided in consequence not to keep the\r\nCustoms revenue as Ireland’s contribution to Imperial expenditure, but to\r\nlet that revenue fall into the common stock of Irish revenue and to take\r\nout of that common stock one third of the “true” Irish revenue. This third\r\nwas to cover Ireland’s contribution to Imperial expenditure together with\r\none third of the cost of the Irish constabulary and Dublin police. Ireland\r\nwas to meet all her local charges out of the remaining Irish revenue. The\r\nImperial Government was to retain for six years the imposition and\r\ncollection of all taxes; the Irish Government having only supplementary\r\npowers of taxation. At the end of six years the Irish contribution was to\r\nbe revised, and Ireland would be empowered to impose taxes other than\r\nCustoms and Excise, and she would collect taxes, the Customs alone being\r\nretained by the Imperial authorities. The “true” revenue derived from the\r\nCustoms and Excise was to be ascertained by a Joint Committee of the\r\nTreasury and the Irish Government. The financial result of these changes\r\nis shown in the following figures:\r\n\r\n(1) Customs:\r\n    Revenue collected in Ireland £2,136,000\r\n    _Add_ estimated allowance for duties paid in Great Britain on articles\r\n                consumed in Ireland £266,000\r\n    Total estimated Irish revenue £2,402,000; Amount Payable to Irish\r\n                Exchequer Two-Thirds £1,601,000\r\n(2) Excise:\r\n    (_a_) Spirits. Revenue collected in Ireland £4,112,000\r\n    _Deduct_ duties ascertained to be paid in Ireland on spirits consumed\r\n                in Great Britain  £1,872,000\r\n    Total £2,240,000\r\n    (_b_) Beer.  Revenue collected in Ireland  £811,000\r\n    _Deduct_ estimated allowance for duties paid in Ireland on beer\r\n                consumed in Great Britain  £187,000\r\n    Total £624,000\r\n    (_c_) Licence duties collected in Ireland £194,000\r\nTotal estimated  £3,058,000; payable to Exchequer £2,039,000\r\n(3) Stamp duties collected in Ireland  £707,000 estimated, £471,000\r\n            payable\r\n(4) Income-tax collected in Ireland  £552,000 estimated, £368,000 payable\r\n(5) Crown Lands amount estimated to be due to £65,000 estimated,  £43,000\r\n            payable\r\nTotal  £6,784,000 estimated, £4,522,000 payable\r\n(6) Miscellaneous Irish Revenue  £138,000 estimated, £138,000 payable\r\nTotals  £6,922,000 estimated, £4,660,000 payable\r\n\r\nIrish Expenditure, 1892-3.\r\n(1) Civil Government charges  (exclusive of Constabulary and salary of\r\n            Lord-Lieutenant, but inclusive of local charges met out of\r\n            local taxation account)  £3,123,000\r\n(2) Constabulary charges (£1,459,000) two-thirds of  £973,000\r\n(3) Estimated deficit on postal account  £52,000\r\nTotal £4,148,000\r\nSurplus  £512,000\r\nTotal £4,660,000\r\n\r\nThe schemes of 1893 again illustrate the difficulties inherent in a\r\nseverance of the two Exchequers. The revise left more points open for\r\ndifference between the two Governments, and it had the serious defect of\r\nrevision after the short interval of six years.\r\n\r\nThe original scheme was far preferable. The retention of the Customs as\r\nthe Imperial contribution reduced opportunity for conflicts of opinion to\r\na minimum, and the interval of fifteen years before revision left ample\r\ntime for the new Irish Government to put its house in order. I venture to\r\nthink it would have been wise to make good the error in estimating the\r\n“true” revenue of Ireland (which invalidated the scheme) by an Imperial\r\nGrant, at all events for a time. Under the scheme the Imperial Government\r\nprovided £500,000 for the constabulary. If it had granted £300,000 or\r\n£400,000 more, the net Imperial contribution derived from the Customs\r\nwould have been reduced to say £1,400,000, not a large sacrifice for the\r\nend in view—reconciliation with Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Bill as amended passed the House of Commons but was thrown out in the\r\nLords. This Parliament refused to accept Mr. Gladstone’s proposals to give\r\nIreland Home Rule, and nineteen years elapsed before a third Home Rule\r\nBill was submitted to Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn the three schemes of 1886 and 1893 the Imperial contribution was very\r\nsimilar, perhaps somewhat larger in 1893. In all three schemes, also, the\r\nnet gain to the British Exchequer was reduced by the grant from that\r\nExchequer of £500,000 to the cost of the Irish Constabulary.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of devising a financial scheme fairly simple and workable,\r\nwhich was experienced in 1886 and 1893, has been disappointing, but not\r\ndiscouraging. It was inevitable but it can be surmounted.\r\n\r\nTHE BILL OF 1912\r\n\r\nIn 1911, Mr. Asquith pledged the Government to take up again in the\r\nensuing session the question of Home Rule. In 1910 the Conservative Party,\r\nat least a considerable part of it, in presence of a probable dissolution\r\non the Parliament Bill, showed, as in 1885, a disposition to coquette with\r\nHome Rule, but the movement came to nothing, and the Party settled into\r\ndetermined opposition to the Home Rule policy, submitting themselves to\r\nthe lead of the Ulster extremists, who preached sedition in no measured\r\nterms. In other respects, the prospects of Home Rule are fairly\r\nfavourable. England, apart from Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, still\r\nreturns a majority opposed to Home Rule, but public opinion does not show\r\nany signs of vigorous or violent opposition as in 1886. The Liberals, the\r\nIrish, and the Labour Party are united in its favour. The passing of the\r\nLand Acts is rapidly removing the agrarian evil, and the landlords have\r\nnot the same cause for anxiety as formerly. The grant of Local Government\r\nis working well, and in spite of much poverty the condition of the people\r\nis improving. Lastly, the passing of the Parliament Act has made it\r\npossible, in spite of opposition in the Lords, to pass a Home Rule Act\r\nwithin the limits of the present Parliament.\r\n\r\nOn April 11th, the Prime Minister introduced the Government Bill. He\r\nregarded it as the first step in a comprehensive policy of devolution. It\r\nretains permanently at Westminster 42 Irish Members, so that Ireland will\r\nhave a voice, not only on questions in the Imperial Parliament which\r\nconcern Ireland, but on questions of Imperial interest, such as war and\r\npeace. The Bill of 1886 reserved to the Imperial Parliament certain\r\nquestions. The Bill of 1893 also made necessary reservations, though its\r\ntendency was towards more complete autonomy; but in the interval between\r\n1893 and 1912 great changes have taken place, and the Imperial Government\r\nfinds itself hampered by new liabilities. The Old-Age Pension Act, the\r\nLand Purchase Act of 1903, the National Insurance Act, and Labour\r\nExchanges have added very greatly to Irish expenditure. On the other hand,\r\nthe contribution to Imperial expenditure, unluckily for the British\r\ntaxpayer, has disappeared. The problem is, therefore, a new one, and the\r\nGovernment solves it, at all events for the present, by keeping in its own\r\nhands a large number of Services, as will be seen hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn 1885-6 Ireland contributed a surplus of considerably more than\r\n£2,000,000 to Imperial expenditure; in 1895-6, £2,000,000.(103) The\r\nGovernment estimates the true revenue of Ireland in 1912-13 at\r\n£10,839,000; and the expenditure on Irish services at £12,354,000.\r\nTherefore the new Irish Government will start with a deficit of\r\n£1,515,000. That deficit is now charged on the British taxpayer. It\r\nresults from British management of Irish finance, for, on the one hand,\r\nIrish revenue is limited by the relatively limited means of Irish\r\ntaxpayers; on the other hand, England has regulated Irish expenditure on\r\nthe lavish scale of her own expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe Government lays down certain principles on which Home Rule finance\r\nwill be based:\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) Ireland must manage her own finance and must have powers of\r\n    taxation consistent with leaving to the Imperial Government a\r\n    field of taxation sufficiently wide for Imperial needs.\r\n\r\n    (2) The Budgets of the two countries must not hamper each other.\r\n\r\n    (3) Ireland must bear the cost of any increase arising hereafter\r\n    on Irish services, but she must benefit by economies in those\r\n    services.\r\n\r\n    (4) She must have power to reduce taxation if her economies permit\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scheme which will give effect to these principles may be described as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the Imperial Government retains in its own hands the\r\nimposition and collection of all Irish taxes, the Post Office duties alone\r\nexcepted, which will be transferred to the Irish Government. _Normal_\r\nincrease in Irish Revenue will not be applied to Irish services. It will\r\nreduce the deficit. The Irish Government, however, will have supplementary\r\npowers of taxation.\r\n\r\nAn Irish Exchequer and an Irish Consolidated Fund will be created, and an\r\nIrish Auditor-General appointed. Further, a joint Exchequer Board,\r\nconsisting of Treasury and Irish officers, will adjust the accounts\r\nbetween the two Exchequers, based upon what it declares to be the actual\r\ncost of Irish services when the Act comes into operation. If the Irish\r\nGovernment, using its supplementary powers of taxation, increases or\r\nreduces taxes, the Exchequer Board will vary accordingly the sum to be\r\npaid by the British to the Irish Exchequer on account of Irish\r\nexpenditure, and it will determine the effect of any other changes taking\r\nplace in the relations between the two Exchequers. Lastly, if and when\r\nnormal increase of Irish revenue puts an end, during a period of three\r\nyears, to the existing deficit, the Exchequer Board will make a report to\r\nthat effect, and the financial arrangement between the two countries will\r\nthen be reconsidered in order to secure a fair contribution from Ireland\r\nto Imperial expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe Government, as I have stated, estimates the revenue of 1912-13 at\r\n£10,839,000. That sum represents the whole “true” revenue of Ireland,\r\nviz., taxes and miscellaneous, £9,485,000; Post Office Revenue,\r\n£1,354,000. The Imperial Government adds to this revenue of £10,839,000 a\r\nfree gift of £500,000 at the cost of the British taxpayer, in order to\r\ngive the Irish Government a fair start. The total Irish income in the year\r\n1912-13 will therefore be £11,339,000.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the account, the Imperial Government retains in its\r\nown hand various Irish Services, termed in the Bill “_Reserved Services_,”\r\ndescribed later. It transfers from the British to the Irish Exchequer the\r\nsum allotted to Irish Expenditure (outside the Reserved Services),\r\nestimated in 1912-13 at £5,462,000, the cost of the Postal Service\r\n£1,600,000,(104) and £500,000, the free gift mentioned above, making a\r\ntotal transfer of £7,562,000.\r\n\r\nIf in the future the sum of £5,462,000 allotted to Irish Expenditure and\r\nthe free gift of £500,000 are exceeded, the Irish Legislature must provide\r\nthe necessary ways and means.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of £7,562,000 from the British to the Irish Exchequer leaves\r\na balance on the British Exchequer on the Irish Account of £3,777,000(105)\r\nfree to that extent to meet the charge of the Reserved Services.\r\n\r\nThese Reserved Services are:\r\n\r\n(1) Old-age Pensions                   £2,664,000\r\n(2) National Insurance Labour Exchange   £191,500\r\n(3) Land Purchase                        £761,000\r\n(4) Constabulary                       £1,377,500\r\n(5) Collection of Revenue                £298,000\r\nTotal                                  £5,292,000\r\n\r\nTherefore the excess of Irish Expenditure in 1912-13 over Irish Revenue as\r\nprovided results in a deficit of £1,515,000 payable by the British\r\ntaxpayer, and if the free gift of £500,000 by the British taxpayer\r\nincluded in the provided revenue be added, the total charge on the British\r\ntaxpayer in 1912-13 on account of Irish Expenditure is £2,015,000.\r\n\r\nThis annual gift of £500,000 is after three years to diminish yearly by\r\n£50,000, until a minimum of £200,000 is reached, which will eventually\r\nrepresent the gift of Great Britain to Ireland, until prosperity or good\r\nmanagement enables Ireland to pay her own way, and at the last to make a\r\ncontribution to Imperial Expenditure.\r\n\r\nThe Government estimates a normal growth in Irish Revenue of £200,000 a\r\nyear, which, to the extent it is realised, will reduce the deficit payable\r\nby the British taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial guarantee on Irish Land Stock is to continue in full force.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF FUTURE MODIFICATION\r\n\r\nIf the Imperial Parliament increases or reduces taxation, the change will\r\nnot affect the Irish Budget, for the transferred sum will remain\r\nunaltered.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Parliament will have power to reduce taxes levied in Ireland. It\r\nwill also have power to impose taxes. It may add at will to Excise duties,\r\nand if so the Customs duties on beer or spirits must vary with the Excise\r\nduties. It may levy new duties which do not interfere with the Imperial\r\nsystem of taxation—for instance, a house duty, or establishment licences.\r\nIt may add to Income-tax or death duties, and also to Customs duties\r\n(other than beer and spirits) provided that the addition does not exceed\r\n10 per cent. of their yield. This 10 per cent. resembles the “centimes\r\nadditionels” which are levied in foreign countries on direct taxes, and\r\nare applicable there to local expenditure. But the Irish Parliament must\r\nnot trench on Imperial taxes. This increase or reduction of Irish duties\r\nwill not affect the British Exchequer, but it will increase or diminish\r\nthe “sum transferred” to the Irish Exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Parliament will not have power to tax articles not subject to\r\nImperial taxes for the time being. If in the exercise of its power it\r\ndifferentiates Customs or Excise duties in the two countries, there will\r\nbe a differential duty on such goods passing from one to the other.\r\n\r\nPublic Works Loans granted before the passing of the Home Rule Act will\r\nremain under the management of the Imperial Government. Future loans will\r\nbe managed by the Irish Government.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Parliament will have power to raise loans on the security of the\r\n“transferred” revenue, sufficient provision being made for interest and\r\nsinking fund. If the Irish Government desires it, the Exchequer Board\r\nabove-mentioned, may issue an Irish Loan, deducting the charge from the\r\nsum “transferred” to Ireland.\r\n\r\nSuch are the provisions of the Bill. It cannot be denied that they appear\r\ncomplicated, but they will be found less so in practice. The machinery of\r\nfinancial administration in a great State is necessarily complicated, and\r\na radical change in that machinery involves a multitude of changes in\r\ndetail for which the reforming Act must provide. Root and branch opponents\r\nof Home Rule naturally criticise those provisions, and exaggerate with\r\n_Ulster_ vehemence the administrative difficulties which attend radical\r\nchange, but the advocates of great measures, while recognising\r\ndifficulties can take juster views of their extent, and they know that\r\nthey can be surmounted.\r\n\r\nIn the first place an expert body (the Exchequer Board) will interpret the\r\nfinancial provisions of the Act. It will consist of two members appointed\r\nby the Treasury and two by the Irish Government, and a chairman appointed\r\nby the Crown. Their decision is to be final. On these questions there is\r\ntherefore no power reserved to the Imperial Government, which might cause\r\nfriction. The Chairman should probably be a man of judicial rank. Possibly\r\na case might arise in which a revision of the Board’s decision would be\r\nneeded. So far this important section of the machinery is not complicated.\r\nIn the next place the Imperial Government remains responsible and liable\r\nfor all the “reserved” services. Here again there is no complication.\r\n_Thirdly_, the Customs and Excise Clauses appear complicated, but they are\r\nfor the most part machinery clauses, common to Revenue Acts. _Fourthly_,\r\nthe Free Trade Clause offends of course the Unionist-Protectionist party,\r\nbut its merits need not be discussed here. I venture to doubt where\r\nIreland is likely to set up a Protectionist policy against Great Britain.\r\nOur market is too important to her. If such a policy were established,\r\nhistory tells us that British Protectionists will not consult Irish\r\ninterests. Lastly a certain, but not a great, inconvenience will attend\r\nthe taking of an official record of goods passing between the two\r\ncountries essential to determining the true revenue of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThus the apparent complications of the Bill dwindle greatly on\r\nexamination. The Bill of 1912 is no doubt much less simple than that of\r\n1893 as introduced by Mr. Gladstone, but that Bill was not, however, so\r\nsimple as it appeared. It was based on the principle of autonomy, but it\r\nretained great powers in Imperial hands. In fact it gave autonomy as far\r\nas autonomy was practicable. Circumstances have changed much since 1893,\r\nand the problem is now in some respects easier. The pivot and crux of Mr.\r\nGladstone’s scheme, the Imperial contribution, has, for the time,\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Primrose’s Committee adopted unanimously and unhesitatingly the\r\nprinciple of simplicity. They recommend that the power of imposing and\r\nlevying all taxation in Ireland, subject to reservations on questions of\r\ntrade and of foreign relations should rest with the Irish Government. They\r\nurge that that policy accords with the general policy of Home Rule, as\r\nremoving causes of friction, as avoiding need for revision of the\r\narrangement (excepting a future question as to an Imperial contribution),\r\nit terminates the extravagance inherent in the partnership, and makes the\r\nresponsibility of the Irish Government for Irish administration complete.\r\n\r\nThe Committee examine the objections to the grant of complete power of\r\ntaxation, viz., that (1) it would break up the fixed unity of the realm;\r\n(2) that it would impair facilities of trade between the two countries;\r\n(3) and that it is at variance with the principle of a Customs Union, said\r\nto be a feature common to federations.\r\n\r\nOn the first point the Committee reply:\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) That in their view the Irish Government should have power to\r\n    impose Customs duties only for the purpose of raising revenue, and\r\n    that the Imperial Government should reserve questions of tariff,\r\n    and foreign relations. Thus fiscal unity on important points would\r\n    be maintained. For sixty years from the Union separate machinery\r\n    existed for the collection of different rates of duty in the two\r\n    countries. If Union could dispense with fiscal unity, _a fortíorí_\r\n    can any less close form of association do so.\r\n\r\n    (2) The Committee do not attach importance to the second\r\n    objection. The Custom House does not seriously trammel the\r\n    convenience of traders between this country and the Continent, and\r\n    it was found endurable when the variance between England and\r\n    Ireland was more formidable than now.\r\n\r\n    (3) On the third objection the Committee argue that a Customs\r\n    Union is indispensable, when the boundaries of federated states\r\n    form a ring fence. It is not indispensable when, in a case like\r\n    that of England and Ireland, the two countries are separated by\r\n    sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese reserves diminish, of course, the severe simplicity of the scheme,\r\nand the Committee’s answers to objections admit some inconvenience to\r\ntrade, but a great change like that of Home Rule must have some drawbacks,\r\nand in the opinion of Home Rulers, the end to be gained far more than\r\ncompensates for slight inconveniences which attend its execution. It is\r\ncertain, moreover, that, whatever may be the measure adopted, it will be\r\nnecessary to take means for ascertaining the “true” Revenue of Ireland,\r\nand to that extent there must be some slight interference with trade.\r\n\r\nI agree with the Committee in their preference for the simplicity of\r\ncomplete autonomy.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Primrose and his colleagues agree to a great extent with a\r\nMinority Report of the Financial Relations Committee (1896), signed by\r\nLord Farrer, Mr. Bertram Currie and myself. The advantages of complete\r\nautonomy are obvious, and I cannot avoid a regret that it has not been\r\npossible to adopt it. I note, however, that the greatest Irish authority\r\non Irish Government, Lord Macdonnell, though in favour of Home Rule, is\r\nentirely opposed to the grant of fixed autonomy to Ireland.\r\n\r\nWe must not misunderstand the relations of the Committee to the\r\nGovernment. They were not appointed to draw a Home Rule Bill. They were to\r\nascertain and consider the fiscal relations between Ireland and other\r\nparts of the United Kingdom as they exist to-day, paying special regard to\r\nthe changes which have taken place in revenue and expenditure since 1896,\r\nthe date of the Report of the Royal Commission; to distinguish between\r\nIrish Local Expenditure and Imperial Expenditure in Ireland; and to\r\nconsider, in the event of Home Rule being established, how the revenue\r\nrequired to meet the necessary expenditure should be provided. The\r\nfunction of the Committee was, therefore, purely financial. They had to\r\ncollect financial information, a necessary preliminary to a consideration\r\nof the Bill, and to advise as to the method of providing the revenue\r\nrequired. They had no mission to examine the political conditions which\r\nmust be satisfied by a Bill designed to effect a Constitutional\r\nRevolution. That was the function of the Cabinet. The Committee, limiting\r\nitself to its instructions, recommended the method of raising revenue\r\nwhich they thought wisest, independently of any but financial\r\nconsiderations. The Government consider the question from a wider point of\r\nview. Their measure must be founded on policy as well as finance. They do\r\nnot adopt the Committee’s recommendations. They decide to retain for a\r\ntime, more or less indefinite, a closer relation between the two financial\r\nsystems. Much as I should like greater simplicity, a study of their\r\nmeasure leads me to the conclusion that its provisions are, in the main,\r\nwise. Let us then consider how far the provisions of the actual Bill\r\nsatisfy the conditions needed to insure the success of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, and for an uncertain number of years, the Imperial\r\nGovernment keeps a tight hand upon the Irish Government. It reserves large\r\npowers enabling it to reject, postpone, or test the validity of Irish\r\nBills. It regulates and levies all taxes, and fixes postal rates. It\r\nsecures the interests of various classes of public servants, and retains\r\ntemporarily the police under its own control. It fixes Irish Local\r\nExpenditure at a certain sum, and it issues that sum yearly to the Irish\r\nGovernment together with a free gift of £500,000 a year for three years,\r\nfalling gradually to a permanent gift of £200,000. _Normal_ increase of\r\nIrish Revenue is appropriated to reduce the deficit to be borne by the\r\nBritish Exchequer. If, therefore, the Irish Government increases its own\r\nexpenditure beyond the fixed sum allotted to it, it must find the revenue\r\nrequired, and for that purpose powers of taxation are given to it.\r\n\r\nThe nursing hand of the mother is, in fact, present at every point of the\r\nBill, but it must be remembered that a hostile step-mother may, at any\r\ntime, replace the kindly mother.\r\n\r\nThere is no escape from the conclusion that these reservations restrict\r\nthe autonomous power of the Irish Government. On the other hand, the whole\r\nspirit of the Bill marks the greater part of them as temporary. The Bill,\r\nin fact, confers autonomy by gradual steps, and holds out prospects that\r\neventually the relations between the two countries will be simple and\r\nworkable. At the outset, and for some time onward, the Irish Government,\r\nfreed from liability for the costly “reserved” services which the\r\n“partnership” has bestowed or inflicted on Ireland, will occupy itself\r\nwith the organisation of its own home administration. It starts with no\r\nprevious experience of administration, and it is clearly desirable that it\r\nshould proceed by steps, gathering experience as it goes. Its field of\r\nwork at first should not be too wide, and six years is not too long a\r\nperiod for it to reform and reconstitute its administrative organisation.\r\nThis is its first duty, and it undertakes it under favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nIn six years the constabulary will be transferred automatically from the\r\ncharge of the Imperial Government to that of the Irish Government with the\r\nsum allotted to its support.(106) That sum will be increased by any saving\r\nwhich accrues to the British Exchequer from the transfer, and in\r\ndetermining that sum regard is to be had to the _prospect_ of any increase\r\nor decrease in the cost of the service, expected to arise from causes not\r\nbeing matters of administration.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the Irish Parliament may, at any time, on twelve\r\nmonths’ notice assume the legislative and executive control of three\r\nreserved services, viz., Old-age Pensions, National Insurance, and Labour\r\nExchanges. If they are taken over, the sum transferred with them will be\r\ndetermined on the same principle as in the case of the constabulary.\r\nAutonomy, therefore, in regard to these services is granted to the Irish\r\nGovernment, and they will only be retained under the control of the\r\nImperial Government, if, and so long as the Irish Government desires it.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General said in his speech on the introduction of the Bill\r\nthat the old-age pension charge is now practically at its maximum,\r\ngradually diminishing, and the Primrose Committee (paragraph 54), estimate\r\nthe charge at the time when the Bill becomes law at £3,000,000. The\r\nquestion then arises what will be the amount transferred, if the Irish\r\nGovernment, seeing its way to more economical administration, were to give\r\nat once the twelve months’ notice and take over the service at the end of\r\na year. It would not, I presume, be £2,664,000 the charge at which the\r\nTreasury in its “outline of financial provision” (paper 6154), estimated\r\nit in 1912-13, but £3,000,000, modified to some extent by the prospect of\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\nThe cost of National Insurance and Labour Exchanges is estimated by the\r\nTreasury in 1912-13 at £191,500, increasing by £300,000 in ten or fifteen\r\nyears. If the Irish Government were in like manner to take them over, the\r\namount transferred would, I presume, be £190,000 with a sum added\r\nrepresenting the prospect of increase.\r\n\r\nIn the event then of those services being taken over by the Irish\r\nGovernment, they would considerably exceed their charges as estimated by\r\nthe Treasury for 1912-13, and the excess would entail a corresponding\r\nincrease of charge on the British taxpayer, to be counterbalanced\r\ngradually by the normal increase of Irish revenue, which the\r\nPostmaster-General estimates, with due reserve, at £200,000 a year, and by\r\nthe gradual reduction (£50,000 a year) of the free gift of the British\r\ntaxpayer from £500,000 to £200,000.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that these increased charges on the British taxpayer\r\nare not the result of Home Rule, they are an inheritance from the\r\n“partnership.”\r\n\r\nWhen these services are transferred from the Imperial to the Irish\r\nGovernment, the Imperial Government will only retain control over the land\r\npurchase charges and the regulation and collection of taxes. The former\r\nwill apparently remain permanently with the Imperial Government, involving\r\nan estimated increase of charge on the British taxpayers of £450,000 a\r\nyear (Treasury Paper 6154). With regard to the latter, it is clearly\r\ndesirable that at the outset the Imperial Government should be responsible\r\nfor levying and collecting taxes. If difficulties on that subject should\r\narise in parts of Ireland, the Imperial Government will settle them with\r\nan authority which the new Irish Government cannot possess. Clause 26,\r\nhowever, holds out a possibility hereafter of extended autonomy to\r\nIreland. If for three years the revenue of Ireland exceeds the expenditure\r\non Irish services by the Imperial and Irish Governments, the Parliament of\r\nthe United Kingdom will revise the financial provisions of the Home Rule\r\nAct, with a view to securing a proper contribution from Irish revenues to\r\nImperial expenditure, and extending the powers of the Irish Government\r\n_with respect to the __ imposition and collection of taxes_, and if\r\nextension were then granted in a liberal spirit, there would be little\r\nleft to desire.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nI have thus traced the gradual progress towards autonomy contemplated by\r\nthe Act. It justifies the conclusion that the Government favours autonomy,\r\nbut seeks to achieve that end gradually and tentatively. With the path\r\nthus marked out, it lies with the nation to pursue steadily and resolvedly\r\nthe great end of reconciliation with Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to consider Home Rule in its financial aspect, without\r\ncasting a look backward and comparing the result which would have followed\r\nthe grant of Home Rule in 1886 with the result which has followed its\r\nrefusal. In the former case Ireland would have been reconciled long ago.\r\nShe would have been mistress in her own house, and it would have been her\r\ninterest as well as her policy so to conduct her administration as to\r\ninsure the success of her autonomy. She would have had full opportunity\r\nfor reorganising her establishments on a reasonable scale, substituting\r\nfor an expensive military police an ordinary police, with a saving, as Mr.\r\nGladstone once pointed out, of £900,000 a year. She would have been able\r\nto maintain the reasonable contribution to Imperial expenditure which it\r\nis her duty as an integral part of the United Kingdom to provide. It would\r\nhave been worth the while of Great Britain to make a great sacrifice at\r\nthe outset to attain this solution of the Irish problem, and long before\r\nnow the solution would have been complete.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative Party refused Home Rule. They have held power during\r\nsixteen out of the twenty-five years elapsed in the interval, and they\r\nhave had full opportunity to try their alternative policy. That policy has\r\nnot indeed been the twenty years of “resolute Government,” a euphemism for\r\ncoercion, advocated by Lord Salisbury. They have tried a policy of bribes\r\nand doles, with the result that the Imperial contribution of over\r\n£2,000,000 made in 1885 has been dissipated, and that Irish local\r\nexpenditure alone shows now a deficit of £1,500,000 and a steadily\r\nincreasing deficit. In short, a total burthen of between £3,500,000 and\r\n£4,000,000 has been inflicted on the British taxpayer. The Leader of the\r\nConservatives has now announced with splendid audacity that if the\r\n“partnership” continues, if the Conservatives are allowed still to\r\nmis-rule Ireland, and to maintain the baleful spirit of ascendancy, they\r\nwill endeavour to develop in every possible way the resources of Ireland.\r\nThat is to say, the policy of bribes and doles is to continue at the\r\nexpense of the British taxpayer. Let the British taxpayer note that, and\r\nlet him note also that the Conservative Party will find the ways and means\r\nfor these bribes and doles not by taxes on the wealthy, but by taxes on\r\nthe food of the people. Ireland will accept the doles; but she will not be\r\nsatisfied. She will still clamour at our gates for Home Rule, as she has\r\nclamoured since 1886, and she will get Home Rule, but the burthen on the\r\nBritish taxpayer will be then how much greater than now?\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\nThis Report of the Primrose Committee, the Treasury outline of financial\r\nprovisions, and the speech of the Postmaster-General on the introduction\r\nof the Bill offer some vague estimates, perhaps more properly guesses, of\r\nIrish finance, one of which, Old-age Pensions, extends to twenty years. It\r\nmay be interesting to throw these figures together, not (God forbid) as an\r\nestimate, but as illustrating opinion prevalent among the experts engaged\r\nin the preparation of the Bill.\r\n\r\nIncome:\r\n    Estimate for the year 1912-1913  10,839,000\r\n    _Add_ free gift of £500,000 to be reduced in nine years to  200,000\r\n    The Postmaster-General’s Estimate of £200,000 normal yearly increase\r\n                of revenue in twenty years  4,000,000\r\nIncome in twenty years (round figures) 15,000,000\r\n\r\nExpenditure:\r\n    Sum transferred to Ireland 1912-1913  5,462,000\r\n    Post Office, 1912-1913  1,600,000\r\n    Old-age pensions (Treasury Paper) 2,800,000\r\n    Land purchase (£761,000 in 1912-1913 increased by £450,000) 1,211,000\r\n    Insurance £191,500 in 1912-1913 increased by £300,000   491,500\r\n(Say) 11,564,500-11,600,000\r\n\r\nBalance available for Constabulary, collection of Revenue, Imperial\r\ncontribution and Irish services.\r\n\r\nIt must be recollected that the Irish Government has to provide for\r\nincrease of Irish services beyond £5,462,000 by taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.—The Judiciary, The Police, And The Maintenance Of Law And Order. BY\r\nTHOMAS F. MOLONY, K.C., HIS MAJESTY’S SECOND SERJEANT-AT-LAW, CROWN\r\nCOUNSEL FOR DUBLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) _The Judiciary_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland is at present constituted as\r\nfollows: The Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the\r\nRolls, the Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, two Lords Justices of\r\nAppeal, two Judges of the Chancery Division and six Puisne Judges of the\r\nKing’s Bench Division. On the occurrence of the next vacancy in the office\r\nof Lord Chief Baron the office is to be abolished and a Puisne Judge\r\nappointed instead. Since the year 1897, six judgeships have been abolished\r\nin Ireland, and a large saving thereby effected. The duties formerly\r\ndischarged by the Probate and Matrimonial Judge, the Admiralty Judge and\r\nthe two Bankruptcy Judges have been transferred to the King’s Bench\r\nDivision and the number of the Puisne Judges of the King’s Bench Division\r\nhas been reduced by two.(107) With every desire for economy it is believed\r\nthat the Supreme Court Bench cannot be further reduced without interfering\r\nwith the efficiency of the public service. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland\r\nis appointed by having the Great Seal delivered to him by the Crown, and\r\nall the other Judges are appointed by His Majesty by Letters Patent. There\r\nare also in Ireland five Recorders and sixteen County Court Judges, who\r\nare appointed by the Lord-Lieutenant. The County Court Judges in Ireland\r\nare also Chairmen of the Quarter Sessions of their respective counties. No\r\nJudge of the Supreme Court or of the County Court can be removed from his\r\noffice except upon the address of both Houses of Parliament. Under the\r\nHome Rule Bill the position of existing judges is to remain unchanged, and\r\nfuture judges are to be appointed by the Irish Executive, and can only be\r\nremoved by a joint address of both Houses of the Irish Parliament which\r\ngives them the same independence that the existing Judges now enjoy. Under\r\nthe Bill of 1893, the Imperial Executive was to have the appointment of\r\nJudges for six years after the passing of the Act, but there seems to be\r\nno justification for the suspensory period and it has been wisely dropped\r\nfrom the present measure. The Irish Executive will not be “irresponsible\r\nand inexperienced” as Mr. J. H. Campbell says in “Against Home Rule—The\r\nCase for the Union” (page 54), but will be composed of men who for many\r\nyears have served in the Imperial Parliament, and are well qualified from\r\ntheir ability and experience to at once take up the reins of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) _The Police_\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct police forces in Ireland. The Dublin Metropolitan\r\nforce(108) has jurisdiction over the Dublin Metropolitan District, which\r\nincludes the whole of the City of Dublin and portion of the County. It\r\nconsists of 2 Commissioners, 7 Superintendents, 25 Inspectors, 187\r\nSergeants and 1,060 Constables, and costs £154,181 per annum.(109) Portion\r\nof the cost is met by a police tax of 8d. in the £ on the rateable value\r\nof the district, but a substantial balance—in the present year amounting\r\nto £96,466—is borne by the Treasury. The Royal Irish Constabulary(110) has\r\njurisdiction over the rest of Ireland, including Belfast. It consists of 1\r\nInspector-General, 1 Deputy Inspector-General, 3 Assistant\r\nInspectors-General, 37 County Inspectors, 195 District Inspectors, 235\r\nHead Constables, 2,068 Sergeants and 8,182 Constables. It costs £1,413,069\r\nper annum, the whole of which is borne by the Treasury.(111) There is a\r\nfundamental difference between the two forces. The Dublin force has been\r\nfounded on the model of the London Metropolitan Police, and is essentially\r\na civilian force. It is admirably trained in police duties, and has always\r\ndischarged its duty to the satisfaction of the citizens. The Royal Irish\r\nConstabulary is drilled and trained in the use of the revolver, rifle, and\r\nsword in the same manner as are the armed forces of the Crown, and is in\r\nevery essential a military organization. There is a reserve force always\r\nkept at the Depôt in the Phœnix Park which at a moment’s notice is\r\navailable for service in any part of Ireland. The Bill proposes that the\r\ncontrol of the Dublin Metropolitan Police be transferred immediately to\r\nthe Irish Executive, but that the Royal Irish Constabulary shall remain\r\nunder Imperial control for six years. An Irish Executive which could not\r\ncontrol the police force of its own metropolis would be in a ridiculous\r\nposition, and no believer in self-government can object to the immediate\r\ntransfer of the Dublin force to the Irish Executive, and indeed, many\r\nthink that the same course ought to be adopted with regard to the Royal\r\nIrish Constabulary. It has for a long period, been a constant source of\r\ncomplaint that the numbers of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and its\r\nconsequent cost, are entirely out of proportion to the wants of the\r\ncountry. It was created in a time of agrarian disturbance which has long\r\nsince passed away, and now that Ireland has been for many years far more\r\nfree from serious crime than either England or Scotland, it is absurd that\r\nin Ireland it should cost 6s. 8d. per head of the population for police,\r\nwhile an equally efficient force can be provided, in England for 3s. 4d.\r\nper head, and in Scotland for 2s. 5d. per head. In Ireland there is one\r\npoliceman for every 365 inhabitants, while in England and Wales there is\r\nonly one for every 727 inhabitants.(112)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) _Law and Order_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of law and order is the first duty of a Government, and if\r\nit could be proved that the proposed measure of Home Rule for Ireland\r\nwould lead to crime and disorder, the cause would lose many of its more\r\nprominent adherents. To those, however, who are interested in the\r\nadministration of the law—and particularly the criminal law—it is obvious\r\nthat Home Rule will have the effect of still further diminishing crime,\r\nand will also enable considerable saving to be effected in the sums now\r\nspent on law charges and criminal prosecutions. At the present time, and\r\nindeed for many years past, Ireland has been practically crimeless. The\r\nJudges at the Spring Assizes, 1912, were unanimous in describing all the\r\ncounties in Ireland, except two, as peaceable and orderly, and free from\r\nserious crime. In two counties—Fermanagh and Carlow—there were no cases\r\nwhatever for trial, and it was only in Galway and Clare that\r\ndissatisfaction was expressed with the present state of affairs, and even\r\nin those counties the affected districts comprised a very limited area.\r\nThe following table taken from the report of the General Prisons Board for\r\nIreland for 1910, shows how the Government have been able to close prisons\r\nin consequence of the diminution of crime and reduction in the number of\r\nprisoners:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The number of prisons and bridewells,” says the report, “under\r\n    the control of the General Prisons Board on the 1st April,\r\n    1878—the date when the local prisons and bridewells were\r\n    transferred to the Board—and now is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    1878.             1910.\r\n    4 Convict         1 Convict\r\n    Prisons.          Prison.\r\n    38 Local          1 Joint Convict\r\n    Prisons.          and Local\r\n                      Prison.\r\n    95 Bridewells.    15 Local\r\n                      Prisons.\r\n                      6 Bridewells.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Unionist Associations of Ireland have recently published a handbook\r\ncalled “The Home Rule ‘Nutshell’ Examined by an Irish Unionist” in which\r\nit is stated (p. 69) “The only crime that is complained of in Ireland is\r\nthe organized crime due to the inspired agitation of the United Irish\r\nLeague. Without that Ireland would be _comparatively crimeless_.” No proof\r\nhas ever been given that the United Irish League has taken any part in the\r\norganization of crime, and beyond all doubt in many instances it has been\r\ninstrumental in preventing it. It cannot, of course, be denied that in\r\ncertain parts of the country instances of boycotting and cattle driving\r\noccur, but such occurrences will certainly not increase, and are more\r\nlikely to cease altogether when Ireland is governed by an Irish Executive\r\nchosen by the people, and responsible to the people for the good\r\ngovernment of the country. The Unionist complaint is, not so much that an\r\nIrish Executive will not be able to enforce the law, but that it will be\r\nunwilling to do so in certain cases, and will exercise a dispensing power\r\nas to whether the decrees of the Courts shall or shall not, in particular\r\ncases, be enforced.(113) If it were within the power of the Executive to\r\nprevent the police or military from being called upon to protect the civil\r\nofficers of the law in the discharge of their duties, it would, no doubt,\r\nbe possible to paralyze the administration of justice, but it is well\r\nsettled that a sheriff, or anybody charged with the execution of a writ of\r\na competent Court, has the right to require the assistance of constables,\r\nand indeed of any of the liege subjects of the Crown, and that the\r\nExecutive has no power to prevent such assistance being given. This was\r\nlaid down by the Common Law Judges in England in the well-known case of\r\n“_Miller_ v. _Knox_”(114) and still more emphatically by the Lord Chief\r\nBaron (Palles) of the Exchequer in Ireland in the case of the Woodford\r\nprisoners at the Connaught Winter Assizes of 1886.(115) The Lord Chief\r\nBaron said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I desire it to be thoroughly understood that the execution of the\r\n    decrees of the judiciary in this country does not depend—as it\r\n    does not, I believe, in any civilised country—upon the will of the\r\n    Executive who, for the moment, may happen to be in office. Into\r\n    the execution of our writ we cannot allow any question of party\r\n    politics to enter. If the law be wrong, let the law be altered by\r\n    the Legislature, and the judges will, at the moment, carry out the\r\n    law as altered. They cannot look beyond the law. They cannot, in\r\n    the administration of that law, contemplate alterations at a\r\n    future time. Their sworn duty is to give to him who asks it that\r\n    which he is entitled to by law. It is not competent to them, or to\r\n    any other person, to go behind the law and to ask whether, in his\r\n    own opinion, or in the opinion of others, the law is just or\r\n    unjust. With them the only consideration must be that is the law.\r\n    They are bound to pronounce the law. From that pronouncement there\r\n    is an appeal to the highest court in the realm. But when judgment\r\n    is once given—the judgment of a court of law, acting within the\r\n    scope of its jurisdiction—it is not competent to anyone in this\r\n    kingdom, I care not how high he may be, to say that a writ\r\n    regularly issued on foot of that judgment shall not be executed,\r\n    or to prevent those who by law are bound to aid in its execution\r\n    from giving that aid and assistance which the Constitution\r\n    requires.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the County Inspector of the Royal Irish Constabulary in County\r\nKerry, by the direction of the Executive, refused the assistance of the\r\nConstabulary to the Sheriff of the County, when he desired to execute\r\ncertain writs of the superior Courts in the night time. The Sheriff\r\nthereupon applied to the Queen’s Bench Division for an attachment against\r\nthe County Inspector, and the Court unanimously made the order.(116) The\r\nLord Chief Justice (Lord O’Brien) in giving judgment said (p. 238):\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I wish to point out that, according to the opinion of all the\r\n    judges who were called in to advise the House of Lords in the case\r\n    of _Miller_ v. _Knox_,(117) refusal, unjustified by the occasion,\r\n    as, in my opinion, the refusal in the present case was, to protect\r\n    the sheriff in the execution of his duty, when protection is\r\n    sought by him, in the honest exercise of his discretion, to enable\r\n    him to discharge his duty in the execution of civil process, is\r\n    punishable, by indictment, by criminal information, and, as was\r\n    established in _Miller_ v. _Knox_ by the summary process of this\r\n    court. The official, be he Under Secretary or Chief Secretary (I\r\n    do not, of course, refer to his Excellency the Lord-Lieutenant),\r\n    who directed Mr. Waters not to comply with the sheriff’s demand\r\n    for protection, has rendered himself amenable to the criminal law,\r\n    is liable to be tried by indictment, to have a criminal\r\n    information exhibited in this court against him, or to be attached\r\n    by the summary process of this court.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, therefore, that the Irish Executive will be bound\r\nto give assistance and protection to sheriffs or other lawful officers\r\nexecuting any legal process of a competent Court, and if such assistance\r\nis not given the Courts will be able to assert their supremacy in the\r\nvarious ways pointed out by the Lord Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nA great deal of capital has recently been made in the Unionist Press on\r\naccount of the promulgation of the _Motu Proprio_ “_Quantavis\r\nDiligentia_.” It has been asserted that this decree applies to Ireland and\r\nwill necessarily embarrass catholic officials in the discharge of their\r\npublic duty. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin has, however, fully\r\nexplained the meaning of the decree, and has shown that it does not apply\r\nto any country where there has prevailed against it, as there has long\r\nprevailed against it in Ireland, a custom invested with the conditions\r\nrequired by the Canon Law.(118) He further says (p. 36):\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The excommunication of the clause _Cogentes_, is not decreed\r\n    against all who oblige lay judges to compel the attendance of\r\n    ecclesiastics in their courts. It is decreed against those who do\r\n    this in violation of the Canon Law. There must first, then, be a\r\n    canonical offence. It is to that offence that the clause\r\n    _Cogentes_ attaches the penalty of excommunication. But, there\r\n    being no canonical offence in the discharge of their duty by our\r\n    Catholic Judges, and Catholic Law Officers of the Crown, our\r\n    Catholic Police Magistrates and Catholic Policemen, and our laity\r\n    in general—who were so ludicrously paraded before the public a few\r\n    weeks ago as the unhappy victims of the _Motu Proprio_—there is in\r\n    their case no offence to which an ecclesiastical penalty can be\r\n    attached, and so, no ecclesiastical penalty is incurred.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is to be feared in Ireland from the _Motu Proprio_ “_Quantavis\r\nDiligentia_,” and there is really no necessity for the restrictions\r\ncontained in Section 3 of the Bill, although no person will object to\r\ntheir insertion as a matter of precaution. The Unionists profess to be\r\nalarmed at the prospects of Ireland under Home Rule; but when their fears\r\nare analyzed they are seen to be illusory, and when their arguments are\r\nconsidered they are found to amount to a single assertion that a great\r\nmeasure of reform is not to be passed, and the will of the people is not\r\nto prevail, because a small minority is irrevocably opposed to any measure\r\nwhich will give to the Irish people power to manage their own affairs.\r\n\r\nWhen Unionists complain of an occasional case of boycotting or\r\ncattle-driving—and it is almost all they have to complain of now—they\r\nshould read Lord Durham’s report on Canada in 1838, and they will see how\r\nfavourably Ireland, even in its darkest hour, contrasts with the Canada of\r\nthat day. Lord Durham adopted the courageous policy of trusting the\r\npeople, and his policy brought peace, prosperity and contentment to that\r\ncountry. Mr. Asquith’s great measure is an embodiment of the same policy,\r\nand will be attended with the same results, and indeed the situation could\r\nnot be better summed up than it was by Mr. John Redmond in the House of\r\nCommons three years ago.(119)\r\n\r\n\r\n    “As it happened in Canada, so it will happen in Ireland—when you\r\n    throw responsibility on the shoulders of the people, and not till\r\n    then. Then respect for law will arise in Ireland; then confidence\r\n    in the administration of justice will arise; and when that day\r\n    comes, I am perfectly convinced that Ireland will become the most\r\n    peaceable and most law-abiding, as she is to-day the most\r\n    crimeless, part of your Empire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.—The Present Position Of The Irish Land Question. BY JONATHAN PIM,\r\nK.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\nThe following chapter contains an account of the change which has been\r\nwrought by legislation in the position of the Irish tenant farmer and\r\nlabourer during the last forty years. The change is large—the benefit and\r\nimprovement equally great. The task is, however, not much more than half\r\ncompleted. The holdings purchased, or agreed to be purchased, by tenants\r\nunder the Purchase Acts amount to about 378,000. There remain to be\r\npurchased about 227,000. The Congested Districts Board have done good work\r\nin the congested districts, but what has been done has hardly gone beyond\r\nthe experimental stage. The experiments have, to a large extent,\r\nsucceeded, but their very success enlarges the vista of work to be done in\r\nthe future. The work of the District Councils in providing better\r\ndwellings for agricultural labourers is perhaps more nearly completed.\r\nNevertheless, much still remains to be done.\r\n\r\nUnder the second section of the proposed Bill “to amend the provision for\r\nthe Government of Ireland,” the “general subject matter of the Acts\r\nrelating to Land Purchase in Ireland” is reserved. This would seem to\r\ninclude the Land Purchase work of the Congested Districts Board, but it is\r\ndoubtful if it would include any part of the Labourers’ Acts. Taken in\r\nconjunction with the whole scheme of the Bill, and especially with its\r\nfinancial provisions, the wisdom of this reservation is evident. That work\r\nwhich has gone so far and has been so beneficial in its operation should\r\nbe stopped, or even hampered, in its development, would be an injury\r\nwhich, even the undoubted benefits a Home Government will bring with it\r\nwould scarcely out-weigh. No doubt Ireland, if thrown altogether on her\r\nown resources, could, after a few years’ time, continue the work of land\r\npurchase and could finally complete it, but the interregnum would be most\r\nmischievous. All those who had not purchased would be dissatisfied, and\r\nthe Irish Government would be subjected to a pressure which they would\r\nfind it hard to resist. The danger would be two-fold. On the one hand the\r\nGovernment might attempt to raise money at an excessive rate of interest\r\nand would thereby embarrass themselves financially; on the other hand an\r\nattempt might be made to force the Government to pass a “Compulsory\r\nPurchase Act” and to fix the price of purchase at a much lower figure than\r\ncould be obtained under a system of free agreement. The Imperial\r\nGovernment itself runs no risk in reserving Land Purchase; on the\r\ncontrary, it will run less risk under Home Rule than it does now. At the\r\npresent moment, there is due to the Treasury a sum of about £71,000,000,\r\nmoney advanced for the purchase of land. The amount of the annual\r\ninstalments payable on this sum is about £2,226,785, and on the 31st of\r\nMarch, 1912, there was due for arrears the sum of £44,156.(120) The\r\npurchase annuitants have up to the present discharged their obligations in\r\na most faithful and honest manner. There is not the slightest reason to\r\nthink that they will act differently in the future, but if, as some\r\npolitical prophets seem to consider possible, they do, in the future,\r\nstrike against the payment of the instalments they themselves will be the\r\nprincipal sufferers, for under the proposed Bill the Treasury may, out of\r\nthe sum to be transferred to the Irish Government, before making the\r\ntransfer, deduct each year the amount then due on account of purchase\r\nannuities. This, if it happened to any large extent, would render fresh\r\ntaxation necessary—a contingency which would certainly not be desired by\r\nthe Irish Government. The proposed Bill does not contain any specific\r\nprovision giving power to the Irish administration, in the case of local\r\nrepudiation, to make the counties in which repudiation had taken place\r\nrepay to the Irish Treasury such sums as they had been forced to pay to\r\nthe Imperial Treasury. If such a provision were inserted, it would make\r\nthe position of the Treasury extremely secure.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gladstone introduced his first Home Rule Bill in 1886, the land\r\nwar was at its height. The country was, on the one hand, full of intense\r\nand unreasoning bitterness and resentment, and, on the other hand, of\r\nunreasoning terror of the consequences of the change of administration.\r\nThere are many persons, to-day convinced believers in the policy of Home\r\nRule, who do not regret that the Bill of 1886 failed to pass. Things were\r\nnot very much better in 1893, although, owing to the Land Act of 1881, the\r\nland war was slowly losing its fierceness. Since then a slow, but no less\r\ndeep and far-reaching, change has passed over the tenant farmers of\r\nIreland. The bitterness and discontent which rightly possessed them during\r\nthe whole of the last century have at last given way to more kindly and\r\ncontented feelings. This is due in a great measure to the large remedial\r\nmeasures passed first by Mr. Gladstone’s Government of 1880 to 1895, and\r\nafterwards by the Conservative Administration between 1896 and 1905; but\r\nit is perhaps even more due to the feeling which has slowly grown up among\r\nthe agricultural population that, at last, they are being listened to, and\r\nthat their wants are being attended to, imperfectly, no doubt, but still\r\nwith sympathy and with a desire to do what can be done to meet them.\r\nWhatever dangers may attend the granting of Home Rule now, they will not\r\nbe the dangers which terrified and controlled public opinion in 1886 and\r\n1893. Almost all the confusion, trouble, and crime of last century was due\r\nto the vicious absurdity of the Irish land code and to the miserable\r\ncondition of the Irish tenant farmers produced thereby. That is now\r\nchanged and Ireland has become a quiet and comparatively crimeless\r\ncountry. The danger which many foresee under a Home Government is of a\r\ndifferent kind. It is rather that the overwhelming peasant vote may render\r\nthe administration unduly parsimonious and so unwilling to place any\r\nadditional burden on the owners of land that a kind of political\r\nstagnation may arise therefrom. Ireland cannot, of course, be kept\r\npermanently out of the great movements of European thought, but, for the\r\nmoment, it may be safely alleged that in no part of Europe is property\r\nsafer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I. The Fair Rent Acts and the Land Purchase Acts.(121)\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Classes of Occupiers of Land in Ireland—Economic and Uneconomic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occupiers of Irish agricultural holdings are of two classes—those\r\nwhose farms are economic, and those whose farms are uneconomic. By an\r\neconomic holding is meant one of sufficient productive capacity to support\r\na family at a reasonable standard of comfort without help from outside\r\nsources. One class holds land of a fertility, quantity, and situation that\r\nenables the occupier to live at a reasonable standard of comfort out of\r\nthe produce, and pay a rent. The other class also lives on and partly out\r\nof land, but land of a character, quantity, or situation that will not\r\nsupport a family at a proper standard of living without extraneous help.\r\nIn the case of the first class, the fairness of the rent is the most\r\nimportant consideration; in the case of the second, the land and rent are\r\noften minor elements in the struggle for existence. The land is either so\r\nlimited in amount or of so unproductive a character that, without outside\r\nhelp such as the wages of labour, or help from friends and relations, the\r\nincome of this class would sink below the line necessary for subsistence,\r\nand actual starvation would ensue. It has often been pointed out that\r\nagricultural rent is in many cases paid in Ireland for farms out of which\r\nno true economic rent is earned. This means, as every economist knows,\r\nthat, were the ordinary and necessary cost of production, including the\r\nremuneration of labour, deducted from the returns from the cultivation of\r\nland, no surplus would remain for the payment of rent. Consequently, the\r\nrent paid for such land is not true agricultural rent. It is more of the\r\nnature of house-rent paid by working men in towns, who, out of the wages\r\nthat they earn in their various employments, spend certain portions in\r\nfood, clothing, and shelter. But the Irish peasant, who tries to support\r\nhis family on an insufficient farm, has not the advantage of having a\r\ndemand for his labour at hand. He has either to emigrate, to migrate, or\r\nto live below the proper standard of decency and comfort. Consequently, he\r\nis neither in the position of the farmer nor of the labourer. He is the\r\noccupier of a piece of land on which he builds his cabin, and pays a rent\r\nwhich is supposed to be agricultural, but which is really not earned out\r\nof the land, but is paid out of whatever other supplementary income he is\r\nable to obtain by working for wages in other countries; or by\r\ncontributions from outside sources. The Irish Fair Rent Acts are supposed\r\nto deal only with agricultural holdings. The rents fixed under them are\r\nintended to be agricultural and economic rents. It is evident to anyone\r\nwho has examined the circumstances of the small holdings of the West of\r\nIreland, that the rents assessed on them under the Land Acts in many cases\r\nare not agricultural rents, but are payments more of the nature of site\r\nrents, or the rents of non-agricultural holdings, which were not supposed\r\nto be subject to the provisions of the Irish Fair Rent Acts at all. Were\r\nthe Land Acts strictly administered, unquestionably the greater portion of\r\nthe small holdings on the western seaboard and other parts of Ireland\r\nwould have been excluded, and applications to fix agricultural rents on\r\nthem would have been dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfusion of Treatment of Occupiers of Economic and Uneconomic Holdings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of the view here put forward lies mainly in the fact that\r\nuntil the passing of the Act of 1891, under which the Congested Districts\r\nBoard was created, no attempt was made to distinguish between the two\r\nclasses of occupiers of Irish land. The occupiers of economic and\r\nuneconomic farms were subject to the same laws, and were treated in the\r\nsame manner. No attempt was ever made to distinguish between the man who\r\ncould make his rent out of his land and the man who could not. Both were\r\nincluded in the Fair Rent provisions of the Act of 1881, as it was\r\nadministered, and a rent was assessed on what was practically the site for\r\na cabin as if it were a farm. This confusion of treatment of two different\r\nproblems renders it necessary to trace the evolution of the Irish Land\r\nActs if we are to understand intelligently the problem that presents\r\nitself in dealing with congestion in Ireland, and it is accordingly\r\nproposed to sketch shortly the steps by which Irish land legislation has\r\nadvanced, and how it at present deals with the various classes of holdings\r\nthat have to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nSpecial treatment for the congested districts was not thought of in the\r\nearlier remedial Land Acts. The Act of 1881, if strictly administered, as\r\nwe have seen, would have excluded most of the holdings in such districts.\r\nAfter twenty years’ experience of this Act it was found that its\r\nprovisions, even though amended repeatedly, did not meet the special\r\ndifficulties. The Congested Districts were not withdrawn from the\r\noperations of the various Land Acts—merely additional powers were given\r\nfor ameliorating the condition of the people in the defined localities.\r\n\r\nThe Land Act of 1881 is naturally regarded in Ireland as the sheet-anchor\r\nof the peasant—as the Magna Charta of his rights. On the other hand, it\r\nhas been looked on by many land-owners as an unjustifiable invasion of\r\ntheir rights, and it has often been blamed for results which it recorded\r\nrather than caused. To justify that Act of 1881, we must understand the\r\npreceding conditions that governed the tenure of land in Ireland.\r\n\r\nComplaints against Irish rents are not confined to recent years or to the\r\nlast century. A continuous stream of emigration of Protestant dissenters\r\nfrom Ulster went on during the early part of the eighteenth century, and\r\nthe Irish Government of the day was much concerned at losing so many of\r\ntheir most loyal citizens. In 1729 the Lord-Lieutenant forwarded a report\r\non the subject to the King, which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “One great reason given by the people themselves for leaving the\r\n    Kingdom is the poverty to which that part of the country is\r\n    reduced, occasioned in a great measure, they say, by raising of\r\n    rents in many places above the real value of land, or what can be\r\n    paid out of the produce of them, if any tolerable subsistence be\r\n    allowed to the farmers using their utmost industry.”\r\n\r\n\r\nComplaint was also made of the uncertain tenures, the short leases, and\r\n“the usual method of late when lands are out of lease,” which was “to\r\ninvite and encourage all persons to make proposals and set them to the\r\nhighest bidder without regard to the tenants in possession.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRelation of Landlord and Tenant in Ireland prior to 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relation of landlord and tenant in Ireland was, down to the year 1860,\r\nbased on tenure, not on contract. The old feudal tenures imported from\r\nEngland were, during the last two or three centuries, modified and altered\r\nby the existing Irish customs. The result was that a period of much doubt\r\nand confusion arose, and an extraordinary collection of Acts dealing with\r\nland was placed on the Irish Statute Book. In the reign of George III.\r\nupwards of sixty of these Acts were passed for Ireland, while six sufficed\r\nfor England. The following reigns were equally productive in agrarian\r\nlegislation, and the condition of the occupiers became more and more\r\nunsettled and unsatisfactory, and “wild doctrines,” to quote the words of\r\nthe eminent authors of a standard work on Irish Land Tenure, published in\r\n1851, were agitated, including “extravagant demands for fixity of tenure\r\nand compulsory valuation of rents.”\r\n\r\nThe relation of landlord and tenant, based on tenure that prevailed down\r\nto the year 1860, gave no security of occupation to the tenant, and did\r\nnot protect his improvements, but the cost of ejectment and the legal\r\ndifficulties of proof that accompanied it exercised a powerful restraining\r\ninfluence in preventing capricious eviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition of Tenants under the Common Law as regards Eviction—in the case\r\nof Leaseholds.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth centuries, while\r\nmany Irish tenants held under leases or written contracts the great\r\nmajority were tenants from year to year. Under the Common Law both in\r\nEngland and Ireland, the right of the landlord to recover possession of\r\nthe land in the case of a lease or written contract depended on the\r\ncovenants and conditions in the contract, and no ejectment could take\r\nplace unless for “a condition broken.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Case of Yearly Tenancies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the case of tenancies not created by writing—tenancies from year to\r\nyear—there was no power of eviction for non-payment of rent under the\r\nCommon Law. The tenant of such a tenancy could only be ejected by a notice\r\nto quit, which notice must expire with the termination of the year of his\r\ntenancy. This system caused much difficulty to the landlord, as the onus\r\nlay on him of proving the commencement of the tenancy, and, frequently,\r\neven where the tenant had failed to pay the rent, eighteen months passed\r\nbefore possession could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Common Law of England and the tribunals that administered it\r\ndiscouraged the forfeiture of tenants’ interests, and the landlord was\r\nheld strictly to the technical proofs required by law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish Ejectment Code—how it Pressed against the Tenant.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Ireland a different course was followed. The Irish “Ejectment Code,”\r\nwhich originated in the reign of Queen Anne, had for its object, to quote\r\nan eminent Irish lawyer, the expediting and facilitating the eviction of\r\nthe tenant. It got rid of every formality by which the old Common Law\r\ndelayed and obstructed the forfeiture of the tenant’s estate. Statute\r\nafter Statute was passed for this purpose. The whole principle of the\r\nCommon Law was reversed. Chief Justice Pennefather judicially declared\r\nthat it was a code of law made solely for the benefit of the landlord, and\r\nagainst the interest of the tenant, and that it was upon this principle\r\nthat judges must administer and interpret it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacilities given for Evicting Leaseholders.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe landlord who sought to evict a tenant holding under lease was, down to\r\nthe year 1816, obliged to proceed in one of the Superior Courts of law, a\r\npractice which caused much expense and delay. When the European peace came\r\nin 1815, after the Battle of Waterloo, the fall in agricultural prices\r\nrendered it difficult, if not impossible, for tenants to pay the high\r\nrents which had been fixed while war prices ruled. An Act was immediately\r\npassed (56 George III., c. 88) which enabled an ejectment to be obtained\r\nin the County Courts at a small cost, and without delay. In this respect\r\nIreland was forty years ahead of England, as a similar jurisdiction was\r\nnot given to the English County Courts until 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nFacilities given for Evicting Yearly Tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish Ejectment Code applied only to tenants holding under leases or\r\nwritten contracts. As the country advanced, landlords gradually ceased to\r\ngive leases, and the great majority of small tenants held from year to\r\nyear. To meet this state of things the Civil Bill Court Act of 1851\r\nextended the ejectment for non-payment of rent to tenancies from year to\r\nyear. Under the English statutes no similar power was given, and the\r\nEnglish landlord was obliged in the case of non-payment of rent to first\r\nserve the tenant with a Notice to Quit, and then proceed to evict him by\r\nthe slow and costly process of an action in the Superior Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Land Act of 1860 (Deasy’s Act).\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this sketch it will be seen that the law governing the relations of\r\nlandlord and tenant in Ireland became more and more favourable to the\r\nowner. This tendency culminated in 1860, when, by “Deasy’s Act” (23 & 24\r\nVic., c. 154)—which was passed through Parliament without amendment—the\r\nrelation between landlord and tenant was defined as founded on contract\r\nand not upon tenure. The Act proceeded on the assumption that the land is\r\nthe exclusive property of the landlord, and that the tenant’s interest is\r\nnothing more than that of a person who has agreed to pay a certain\r\nremuneration for the use of the soil for a limited period. It simplified\r\nand increased the remedies of the landlord for recovering possession of\r\nthe land, and rendered efficient the law of ejectment for non-payment of\r\nrent and on notice to quit. Thus a default in payment of one year’s rent\r\nentitled a landlord to evict the tenant and get possession of the land,\r\nwith all improvements on it, even where such improvements many times\r\nexceeded in value the amount due. So also, by serving a Notice to Quit,\r\nthe landlord could similarly get rid of the tenant without cause, and take\r\npossession of the holding and all its improvements, no matter how valuable\r\nthese might be, and without having to pay any compensation. The governing\r\nprinciple of the Act was that whatever attached to the freehold became\r\npart of the freehold.\r\n\r\n\r\nPosition of the Irish Tenant from 1860-1870.—The Devon Commission reported\r\n(1844) that farm Improvements are made by the Tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years after the passing of “Deasy’s Act” the position of\r\nthe Irish tenant reached its nadir. He had no right of any kind, except\r\nsuch as the contract under which he held gave him. Almost all the\r\nimprovements which rendered the land capable of being worked were made by\r\nhim. He had built the houses, erected the fences, made the roads, drained\r\nand manured the land, reclaimed it from bog or mountain—generally at a\r\ncost out of all proportion to the return—and yet he could be turned out\r\nwithout compensation at the will of the owner, either by the service of a\r\nNotice to Quit or by ejectment for non-payment of one year’s rent. That\r\nthe tenants in Ireland made the improvements was universally admitted. The\r\nDevon Commission (presided over by a leading Irish landlord) in the year\r\n1844, reported:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It is well known that in England and Scotland before a landlord\r\n    offers a farm for letting, he finds it necessary to provide a\r\n    suitable farm-house, with necessary farm buildings for the proper\r\n    management of the farm. He puts the gates and fences in good\r\n    order, and he also takes upon himself a great part of the burden\r\n    of keeping the buildings in repair during the term; and the rent\r\n    is fixed with reference to this state of things. In Ireland the\r\n    case is wholly different. It is admitted on all hands, that\r\n    according to the general practice in Ireland, the landlord builds\r\n    neither dwelling house nor farm offices, nor puts fences, gates,\r\n    &c., into good order, before he lets his land to the tenant. The\r\n    cases in which the landlord does any of these things are the\r\n    exception. In most cases whatever is done in the way of building\r\n    or fencing is done by the tenant, and in the ordinary language of\r\n    the country—dwelling houses, farm buildings, and even the making\r\n    of fences, are described by the general word _improvements_, which\r\n    is thus employed to denote the general adjuncts to a farm, without\r\n    which, in England or Scotland, no tenant would be found to rent\r\n    it.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects of Political and Economic Changes on the Relations between\r\nLandlord and Tenant during the Nineteenth Century.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the last century the landlords, for political as well\r\nas commercial reasons, encouraged the increase of the tenantry. The\r\npolitical system that prevailed gave the landlord who had a large number\r\nof tenants considerable power. The economic conditions of the time made\r\nsmall tillage farming productive, and the demand caused by an ever-growing\r\nagricultural population increased the competition for land, and enabled\r\nthe rents to be raised. About the middle of the century all these\r\nconditions altered. The combined influence of the Famine and of the\r\nintroduction of Free Trade made it the interest of most landlords to get\r\nrid of their small tenants as expeditiously and as completely as possible.\r\nNow came the era of pasture and larger farms. Although the population\r\nrapidly decreased, the consolidation of farms kept up the competition for\r\nland, and rents rose rapidly. The clearances so common from the Famine to\r\n1870 were made in many cases quite irrespective of the non-payment of\r\nrent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttempts at Reform.—Land Act of 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis state of things led to outrage and constant agrarian disturbance.\r\nVarious suggestions for reform of the Land Laws were made, but such\r\nproposals were usually denounced as confiscatory. Mr. Butt’s proposal in\r\n1866 that sixty-three years’ leases, with power to the landlord of varying\r\nthe rent, when any accidental circumstances increased the value of the\r\nland, should be given by every landlord to his tenants, was described by\r\nLord Dufferin as “communistic” and “as subversive of the rights of\r\nproperty.” Mr. John Stuart Mill, speaking on a Land Bill introduced by Mr.\r\nChichester Fortescue (May 17th, 1865), denounced the policy of clearing\r\naway the small tenants to make room for capitalist farmers. “You cannot,”\r\nhe said, “evict a whole nation.” Various attempts to alter the law were\r\ndefeated, until at length, in 1870, Mr. Gladstone took the matter in hand,\r\nand passed his Landlord and Tenant Act—the beginning of a new Land Code.\r\n\r\nThe justification for the Act of 1870 was the same as for the Act of 1881,\r\nwhich followed it. The tenant had made all the improvements on the land,\r\nand yet had no legal property in them. He was liable to capricious\r\neviction from a holding, the value of which was often mainly due to his\r\nlabour, and he was subject to arbitrary increases of rent.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1870 did three things: (1) It gave compensation for\r\ndisturbance; (2) it gave compensation for improvements; and (3) it\r\nlegalised the Ulster Tenant Right Custom.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Compensation for Disturbance._\r\n\r\n    I.—Compensation for disturbance was strictly limited to such loss\r\n    as “_the Court shall find_” to have been sustained by the tenant.\r\n    The loss was often held to be the less the higher the rent. The\r\n    amount of compensation could in no case exceed £250, and was\r\n    limited to tenancies created after the passing of the Act. No\r\n    compensation was to be given to tenants who had sublet or\r\n    subdivided their holdings without the consent in writing of the\r\n    landlord, or to any tenant under a lease for thirty-one years or\r\n    upwards, and the landlord had a right of deduction from the amount\r\n    awarded, for deterioration, &c.\r\n\r\n    _Compensation for Improvements._\r\n\r\n    II.—The right to compensation for his improvements to be awarded\r\n    to a tenant when quitting his holding was subject to so large a\r\n    variety of exceptions as to greatly limit the number of tenants\r\n    able to take advantage of the provision.\r\n\r\n    Even when compensation was awarded, the landlord could deduct from\r\n    the amount any arrears due for rates and taxes and for the loss\r\n    due to the non-observance of express or implied covenants or\r\n    agreements, and the Court in awarding compensation was required in\r\n    reduction of the claim of the tenant to take into consideration\r\n    the time during which the tenant had enjoyed the advantages of\r\n    such improvements, and also any other benefits he had had.\r\n\r\n    _Ulster Custom._\r\n\r\n    III.—The legalization of the Ulster Custom did not prevent the\r\n    landlord from increasing the rent from time to time so as almost\r\n    to destroy the tenant’s interest. The Act did not define the\r\n    custom, and the onus lay on the tenant of establishing that the\r\n    particular usage under which he held was within it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three great reforms introduced by the Act of 1870, namely: (1) The\r\nright to compensation for disturbance; (2) to compensation for\r\nimprovements; and (3) the legalization of the Ulster Custom—could only be\r\nbrought into operation by proceedings before the County Court Judges, who\r\nwere thus entrusted with the administration of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure of the Act of 1870, Causes of.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1870 failed in its object mainly for three reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) The great variety and complexity of the exceptions from the\r\n    benefits of the Act.\r\n\r\n    (2) The principle of administration which, as a rule, tended to\r\n    reduce the compensation to as low a figure as possible.\r\n\r\n    (3) The insecurity of tenure of the tenant, and the right the\r\n    landlord still had of raising the rent at his pleasure. Thus the\r\n    legalization of the Ulster Custom was of little use, as the\r\n    landlord could practically destroy all the tenant’s interest under\r\n    it by raising the rent. The only remedy was to surrender the\r\n    holding and go before the County Court Judge for compensation,\r\n    which was usually much less than the tenant-right would fetch if\r\n    sold in the open market.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo protect the interest and property of the tenant in his holding and in\r\nhis improvements, both of which had now legal recognition—it was necessary\r\nto give him: (1) Security of tenure at a fair rent; and (2) a special and\r\nexpert tribunal to decide on the amount of the rent at which he was to\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Land Act of 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1881 effected these reforms. It gave the tenant the right to\r\nsell his interest in his holding—subject to the landlord’s right of\r\npre-emption—it gave fixity of tenure at a fair rent—subject to a fifteen\r\nyears’ re-valuation—and it established a special tribunal to fix the\r\nrents.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the present Irish Land Code—which comprises a large\r\nnumber of statutes—are contained in the Acts of 1870 and 1881. The Act of\r\n1870 recognised for the first time that the Irish tenant had a right of\r\noccupation and a property in his improvements. But the Act failed because\r\nit recognised these rights grudgingly, and left untouched the power of the\r\nlandlord to fix what rent he pleased. The Land Act of 1881 for the first\r\ntime safeguarded the property of the tenant, and reversed the policy of\r\nthe Act of 1860 (Deasy’s Act) by removing the Irish Land system from the\r\ndomain of contract, and, in a manner, bringing it back to tenure.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferences between the English and the Irish Land Systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the agrarian situation in Ireland it is necessary to keep in\r\nmind the fundamental difference between the English and the Irish systems,\r\nwhich was pointed out in the Report of the Devon Commission. In England,\r\nspeaking generally, agricultural farms are let by the owners fully\r\nequipped with buildings, fences, farm roads, and other improvements\r\nnecessary for the proper working of the holding. The tenant contracts to\r\npay a rent for the farm so equipped, and, if he finds that the particular\r\nholding does not suit him, he gives it up at the end of his contract term,\r\nand goes elsewhere. Under this system, what Adam Smith termed “the\r\nhiggling of the market!” is the easiest test of land value, as it is of\r\nall other commodities with regard to which competition is free. In\r\nIreland, on the other hand, the landlord, speaking generally, owns only\r\nthe soil. The equipment of each farm is the property of or has been\r\neffected by the tenant, who is practically a hereditary occupier. The\r\nhouses, fences, drainage, reclamation, farm roads, and other such\r\nnecessary improvements have been made by the tenant or his predecessors in\r\ntitle. The landlord owns the soil, and the tenant the necessary\r\nagricultural equipment. Consequently, the tenant is not free. He cannot\r\nwalk out at the end of his term and leave behind him his houses, roads,\r\nfences, and drains. Besides, if he goes out, he has nowhere else to\r\nsettle.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of competition is so great—as is natural in a country in the\r\ngreater part of which there is no other employment or industry than that\r\nof agriculture—that, very large sums, often far in excess of the value of\r\nthe land, measured by any standard of productive capacity are paid for the\r\nmere right to occupy. Again, the nature of the land, in large parts of\r\nIreland, is such as to prevent owners from working it on the English\r\nsystem of equipped farms. In the poorer parts of the country the land can\r\nonly be made to yield a profit to the owner by being worked by small\r\noccupying tenants, who, without any economic return, are willing to expend\r\ntheir labour and that of their families. Were such land to be handed back\r\nto the owners to be worked by them without the intervention of tenants no\r\nprofit could be obtained, and the land would go out of cultivation, being\r\nbelow the margin of economic profit.\r\n\r\nHere we have the explanation and the justification of the series of Land\r\nActs from 1870 to 1896. They were an attempt to adjust the law of landlord\r\nand tenant to the facts of the case. Before 1870 the law regarded the\r\nlandlord as the sole owner of the farm, while, in fact, the tenant was the\r\nco-owner. The Act of 1870 recognised, to a limited extent, the\r\nco-ownership, but gave insufficient relief. The Act of 1881 gave a more\r\ncomplete recognition and relief, and various amendments and extensions\r\nwere introduced by subsequent Statutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrish Land Purchase and the extent to which it has been carried on by\r\nState aid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSide by side with the legal recognition of dual ownership in Ireland there\r\nproceeded a system for the creation of a peasant proprietary by the aid of\r\nState loans, when both parties were agreed. The principal Acts under which\r\nadvances of public money to enable tenants to become proprietors of their\r\nholdings were made are:\r\n\r\nThe Irish Church Act, 1869.\r\nThe Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870.\r\nThe Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881.\r\nThe Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885.\r\nThe Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891 and 1896.\r\nThe Irish Land Act, 1903 and 1907.\r\nThe Evicted Tenant Act, 1907.\r\nThe Irish Land Act, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrish Church Act, 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this Act the Church Temporalities Commissioners were empowered to\r\nsell to tenants of Church Lands their holdings at prices to be fixed by\r\nthe Commissioners themselves. If the tenants refused to buy on the terms\r\noffered to them, the Commissioners could sell to the public. The Church\r\nTemporalities Commissioners were empowered, if they thought well, to take\r\npayment, as to one-fourth only, in cash and to leave the other\r\nthree-fourths outstanding as a legal charge on the holding, to be paid off\r\nin thirty-two years by sixty-four half-yearly instalments.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners sold in all to 6,057 tenants at an average price of\r\ntwenty-two and two-thirds years’ purchase of the rents, and the total\r\namount of the money advanced on loan was £1,674,841, which was issued by\r\nthe Commissioners of Public Works.\r\n\r\nThe terms of repayment and the rate of interest charged on loans were\r\nafterwards altered and reduced under the Purchase of Land Act of 1885,\r\nSection 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nLandlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder what are known as the “Bright Clauses” of this Act, the landlords\r\nand tenants of agricultural or pastoral holdings could arrange for a sale\r\nof their holdings with State aid to be carried out in the Landed Estates\r\nCourt. Upwards of two-thirds of the price agreed upon could be advanced by\r\nthe Board of Works, to be repaid in thirty-five years by an annuity, at\r\nthe rate of five per cent. on the loan. Under this Act 877 tenants\r\npurchased their holdings, and the amount of loans issued was £514,536. The\r\ntotal purchase money paid by the tenant purchasers for their holdings was\r\n£859,000, being at the rate of twenty-three and one-third years’ purchase\r\nof the rents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1881 (the “Gladstone Act”).\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this Act the Land Commission thereby established was empowered to\r\nmake advances to tenants for the purchase of their holdings, and was\r\nenabled to purchase estates for re-sale to the tenants. The limit of\r\nadvance was extended from two-thirds of the purchase-money (as in the Act\r\nof 1870) to three-quarters. The terms of repayment were the same—an\r\nannuity of five per cent. for thirty-five years.\r\n\r\nUpwards of 731 tenants purchased under this Act, and the advances made\r\namounted to £240,801. These included advances to 405 tenants on seven\r\nestates bought under the Act (Section 26) by the Land Commission in the\r\nLanded Estates Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1885 (the “Ashbourne Act”).\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this Act—commonly known as the “Ashbourne Act”—a sum of £5,000,000\r\nwas authorised to be advanced to the Land Commission to enable sales to be\r\ncarried out between landlords and tenants by agreement, and to enable the\r\nLand Commission to purchase estates in the Landed Estates Court for the\r\npurpose of re-selling them to the tenants. The Land Commission was\r\nempowered to advance the entire of the purchase-money subject to the\r\nretention of one-fifth by way of guarantee deposit for a period of about\r\nseventeen and a half years, by which time an equivalent amount of the\r\ncapital advanced had been repaid by means of the sinking fund. This\r\ndeposit could be utilised if the tenant purchaser made default in his\r\nrepayment, and if the amount in default could not otherwise be recovered.\r\nThus the landlord vendor was made a guarantor for the repayment of the\r\nannuity by the tenant purchaser. (Section 3.)\r\n\r\nThe advances made under this Act were to be repaid by annual instalments\r\n(which included interest and sinking fund), extending over a period of\r\nforty-nine years.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, the £5,000,000 given under the Act of 1883 being practically\r\nexhausted, an additional sum of £5,000,000 was advanced to the Land\r\nCommission for the purposes of land purchase (51 and 52 Vic., c. 49).\r\nUnder the “Ashbourne” Acts 25,367 tenants (on 1,355 estates) became\r\npurchasers of their holdings, and the loans made amounted to £9,992,536.\r\nThe rate of sale was seventeen years’ purchase of the rents. (Report of\r\nthe Irish Land Commission, 1902, p. 89.) Under these Acts 101 estates were\r\npurchased in the Landed Estates Court for re-sale to tenants, and loans\r\nwere issued to 2,029 tenants, amounting to £531,277.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurchase of Land Acts, 1891 and 1896 (the “Balfour Acts”).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funds advanced to the Irish Land Commission for the purposes of land\r\npurchase having again become exhausted, Mr. Balfour, in 1891, introduced a\r\nnew system under which the landlord or vendor was paid in a specially\r\ncreated guaranteed Land Stock (exchangeable for Consols at the option of\r\nthe vendor), equal in nominal amount to the purchase money. This stock\r\nbears interest at the rate of 2-¾ per cent. per annum, and cannot be\r\nredeemed until the expiration of thirty years from the date of the passing\r\nof the Act of 1891. The dividends and sinking fund payments required for\r\nthis stock are paid out of a “Land Purchase Account,” established by the\r\nLand Commission (Section 4), to which all moneys received on account of\r\nany purchase annuity for the discharge of an advance are paid. If this\r\nLand Purchase Account is at any time insufficient to meet the dividends\r\nand sinking fund payments (owing, for instance, to default in the\r\nrepayment of instalments), the deficiency is to be a charge on a\r\n“Guarantee Fund,” established for the purposes of the Act (Section 5).\r\nThis fund consists of a cash portion and a contingent portion. The cash\r\nportion is mainly made up of the Irish Probate Duty (now Estate Duty)\r\ngrant, and an Exchequer contribution, and the contingent portion consists\r\nof the Irish share of the local taxation (Customs and Excise) duties and\r\ncertain local grants (Section 5). Any deficiency in the Land Purchase\r\naccount is to be paid out of this Guarantee Fund. This financial\r\nexpedient, of course, throws the securing of the repayment of the advances\r\nfor land purchase on the ratepayers of the county, as any default will be\r\nrecouped by deductions from the various payments and contributions in aid\r\nof rates that make up the Guarantee Fund. The amount of stock that could\r\nbe issued for each county for purposes of Land Purchase was limited to\r\ntwenty-five times the share of the county in the guarantee fund by the Act\r\nof 1891 (Section 9). This limit, having been reached in the case of Co.\r\nWexford, by Mr. Wyndham’s Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1901 (1 Edw.\r\nVII., c. 3) the limit was extended to fifty times the share of that county\r\nin the guarantee fund. By the Act of 1903 (Section 46) the limit for each\r\ncounty was raised to thirty times its share in the guarantee fund, which\r\nlimit might be further raised to sixty times where the Treasury, on the\r\ncertificate of the Lord-Lieutenant, were of opinion that such increase in\r\nadvances could be made without any risk of loss to the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nTaken on the basis of the financial year 1909-10 the Guarantee Fund for\r\nall counties of Ireland amounted to £2,797,126. On the above figures the\r\ncapitalized value of the Guarantee Fund on the thirty times basis is at\r\npresent £83,913,780, but owing to increases beyond this thirty times limit\r\nwhich have been sanctioned by the Treasury, in certain counties the\r\npresent capitalized value of the fund stands at £89,323,685.\r\n\r\nThe total charge on the fund up to March 31st, 1910, was about 48-¾\r\nmillion pounds in respect of advances made on the security of the fund,\r\nand, taking pending applications for advances into account, the\r\napproximate charges amounted at that date to about 105 millions.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1891 was amended in various respects by Mr. Gerald Balfour’s\r\nAct of 1896, which introduced, among other changes, a method of reducing\r\nevery decade (up to thirty years after the advance was made), the annuity\r\nto be paid by the tenant purchaser. As under the “Ashbourne Act” of 1885,\r\nthis annuity was calculated at £4 per cent. on the purchase money, 2-¾ per\r\ncent. being for interest, and 1-¼ per cent. being for sinking fund. Under\r\nMr. Gerald Balfour’s system, during the first decade after the purchase\r\nthe annuity is calculated on the original advance, and during the second\r\nand third decades on the portion of the advance which is ascertained to be\r\nunpaid at the end of the previous decade. At the end of the third decade\r\nthe annuity is calculated on the amount of the advance then outstanding\r\nand runs until the entire debt is paid off. The Act of 1896 also permitted\r\nthe Land Commission to dispense with the whole or any part of the\r\nguarantee deposit required under the Act of 1885 if the security for the\r\nrepayment of the advance was considered to be sufficient without it\r\n(Section 29).\r\n\r\nThe number of loans issued under these Acts of 1891 and 1896 to tenant\r\npurchasers up to March 31st, 1910, was 46,828, amounting in all to\r\n£13,145,762, and being at the rate of 17.7 years’ purchase of the rents\r\n(Land Commission Report, 1910, p. 110).\r\n\r\n\r\nIrish Land Act, 1903 (the “Wyndham Act”).\r\n\r\n\r\nI have traced the history of the Irish Land Acts down to 1896. Some short\r\nActs were added to the code during the following years to clear away\r\ncertain difficulties, and in 1903 Mr. Wyndham brought in and passed his\r\nIrish Land Act, which may be said to have opened a new era in Irish\r\nagrarian legislation. Under it a new body known as Estates Commissioners\r\nwas formed, and included in the Land Commission to administer land\r\npurchase in Ireland.\r\n\r\nSales under previous Purchase Acts were carried out by holdings. A\r\nlandlord could agree with one or more of his tenants to sell them their\r\nfarms, and if the Land Commission, after examination, found that the\r\nparticular holding was security for the advance asked for by the tenant,\r\nsuch advance was made irrespective of any other sales on the estate. The\r\nAct of 1903 introduced the system of sales by “Estates.” A landlord, to\r\nobtain the benefit of the Act, is obliged to sell his entire estate, or\r\nsuch portion of it as the Land Commission considers fit to be regarded as\r\na separate estate for the purposes of the Act. The Commissioners, before\r\ndefining any lands to be an estate, have to consider all the circumstances\r\nof the district and of the property. Once the estate is “declared,” the\r\nholdings comprised in it are dealt with in accordance with the provisions\r\nof the Act. Those of them that are subject to judicial rents and are\r\nwithin certain “zones” laid down in the Act are freed from the liability\r\nto inspection as to security or equity of price. The Act presumes that a\r\nholding subject to a judicial rent which is sold at a price the annuity on\r\nwhich is from 10 to 30 per cent. less than the judicial rent, where that\r\nrent was fixed since the passing of the Act of 1896, or from 20 to 40 per\r\ncent. less where the rent was fixed before that date, is good security for\r\nthe payment of the annuity, and that the agreed price is equitable.\r\nHoldings not subject to the “zone” provisions are liable in inspection as\r\nto security and as to equity of price.\r\n\r\nThe Act also introduced the system of sales of estates to the\r\nCommissioners under Section 6 (the direct sales to tenants by landlords\r\nbeing under Section 1). When a landlord is willing to sell in this manner,\r\nthe Commissioners, after due enquiry as to the price that should be paid\r\nby each tenant for his holding, may offer to purchase the estate for the\r\npurpose of re-selling to the occupiers, provided that at least\r\nthree-fourths of the tenants agree to purchase their holdings from the\r\nCommissioners at the estimated price.\r\n\r\nTo encourage sales of estates, and to enable owners to get such a sum as\r\nwould give them their net income out of the purchase money, when\r\nreinvested in suitable securities, the Act provided that a bonus of 12 per\r\ncent. on the purchase money should be paid to the owner on the completion\r\nof the sale. At the same time the tenant was enabled to borrow the\r\npurchase money of his holding on easier terms. As we have seen, under the\r\nformer Purchase Acts, the annuity rate was fixed at 4 per cent., of which\r\n2-¾ per cent. was for interest and 1-¼ per cent. for a sinking fund, the\r\naccumulation of which, with compound interest, would repay the sum\r\nadvanced in about forty-three years. Under the Act of 1903 the annuity\r\nrate which the tenant had to repay was reduced to 3-¼ per cent., of which\r\n2-¾ per cent. is for interest and a ½ per cent. for sinking fund. This\r\nreduction in the sinking fund lengthens the period over which the\r\nrepayment will extend to sixty-eight and a half years, and, of course,\r\nrenders it practically impossible to continue the system of giving decadal\r\nreductions in the annuities. The decadal reductions, which were abolished\r\nby the Act of 1903, worked out at about 15 per cent. reduction in the\r\nannuity every ten years.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1903 also enabled owners to sell their demesnes and untenanted\r\nlands to the Commissioners, and to repurchase them, or so much of them as\r\nthe Commissioners approved, with the aid of advances made to them in the\r\nsame manner and under the same conditions as to tenant purchasers.\r\n\r\nThe Act also gave considerable powers to the Commissioners of dealing with\r\npoor and uneconomic holdings. It enabled (Section 2) parcels of untenanted\r\nlands on the sale of an estate to be sold to the following persons:\r\n\r\n\r\n    (_a_) A person being the tenant of a holding on the estate;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) A person being the son of a tenant of a holding on the\r\n    estate;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) A person being the tenant or proprietor of a holding not\r\n    exceeding five pounds in rateable value, situate in the\r\n    neighbourhood of the estate; and,\r\n\r\n    (_d_) A person who within twenty-five years before the passing of\r\n    this Act was the tenant of a holding to which the Land Law Acts\r\n    apply, and who is not at the date of the purchase the tenant or\r\n    proprietor of that holding: Provided that in the case of the death\r\n    of a person to whom an advance under this paragraph might\r\n    otherwise have been made, the advance may be made to a person\r\n    nominated by the Land Commission as the personal representative of\r\n    the deceased person.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis last class (_d_) was intended to provide for the reinstatement of\r\ntenants evicted from their holdings within the prescribed time.\r\n\r\nIt also gives power to the Commissioners to purchase untenanted lands for\r\nthe purpose of enlarging holdings and of creating new holdings, and to\r\nenable this work to be carried out satisfactorily, the Land Commission is\r\ngiven all the powers conferred on the Congested Districts Board by their\r\nAct of 1901 for facilitating re-sales of land.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Evicted Tenants Act, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nA large number of evicted tenants had been reinstated in their holdings\r\nunder the Act of 1903 or had been provided with new holdings where their\r\nformer holdings were not available. Large sums of money (drawn from the\r\nReserve Fund established under the Act of 1891, which was made available\r\nby Section 43 of the Act of 1903) were expended in equipping these\r\nholdings and in financing reinstated tenants where in the opinion of the\r\nEstates Commissioners this was necessary. The provisions of the Act of\r\n1903 were, however, found to be insufficient to carry out the intentions\r\nof the legislature, and in 1907 Mr. Birrell passed an Evicted Tenants Act\r\nwhich enabled the Estates Commissioners to acquire untenanted land\r\ncompulsorily for the purpose of providing holdings for tenants who, or\r\nwhose predecessors, had been evicted from their holdings since the year\r\n1878, and who had applied to the Commissioners before May 1st, 1907. Up to\r\nMarch 31st, 1911, as many as 12,398 persons had applied for holdings as\r\nEvicted Tenants. Of these 6,276 were rejected by the Commissioners after\r\nenquiry; 2,631 did not apply within the prescribed time; 2,830 were\r\nactually reinstated in holdings; and 661 were still under consideration by\r\nthe Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrish Land Act, 1909 (Mr. Birrell’s Act).\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter six years’ experience of the Act of 1903 it became evident that\r\nfurther legislation was required if Land Purchase was to go on. In two\r\nimportant matters Mr. Wyndham’s Act needed amendment. Under the financial\r\nprovisions of the Act the money required for advances to enable tenants to\r\npurchase their holdings was provided by the issue of a Stock bearing\r\ninterest at 2-¾ per cent. But it turned out that at no time after the\r\npassing of the Act could the money be raised on these terms, except at a\r\nlarge discount averaging over 12 per cent. The Act provided that a fund\r\nknown as the Irish Development Grant should bear any loss due to the issue\r\nof Stock at a discount. This Fund made available a sum of £160,000 a year.\r\nThe first issue of Stock under the Wyndham Act was made at 87, or a\r\ndiscount of 13 per cent. Thus, to provide £100 in cash over £113 of Stock\r\nhad to be issued. The interest on this “excess Stock” was not paid by the\r\ntenant purchasers, and was to be provided for out of the Development Grant\r\nso long as that Fund was available, and afterwards would fall on the\r\nGuarantee Fund, which meant the Irish Ratepayers. In the year 1909 it,\r\nhowever, appeared that the charge for “excess Stock” necessitated by the\r\ncontinual flotation of Stock at a large discount had so eaten into the\r\nDevelopment Grant that that Fund had become exhausted, and consequently\r\nall subsequent issues of Stock for Land Purchase purposes would have to be\r\nmade at the expense of the Ratepayer. Agreements amounting to 56 millions\r\nof Purchase Money were pending. To finance these Agreements a sum of about\r\n£250,000 a year for the period of sixty-eight and a half years would have\r\nto be provided by Irish Ratepayers, and were all the agricultural land in\r\nIreland to be sold the charge on the ratepayers would amount to an annual\r\nsum of £877,000.\r\n\r\nIt became evident that the Irish Ratepayers would not tolerate Land\r\nPurchase on these terms. Mr. Birrell, accordingly, by his Land Act passed\r\nin December, 1909, provided that the charge for excess Stock to finance\r\nall pending Purchase Agreements should be provided by the Treasury instead\r\nof the Ratepayers, thus relieving the latter of a capital sum that might\r\nexceed over £7,000,000. As regarded future Purchase Agreements, the Act\r\nprovided that the Vendors should be paid in 3 per cent. Stock, and that\r\nPurchasers should pay an Annuity of 3-½ per cent. instead of 3-¼ per cent.\r\n\r\nThe other matter in which the Act of 1903 required amendment was as\r\nregards the provision of the Bonus. A sum of 12 millions was provided by\r\nMr. Wyndham for the purpose of encouraging landlords to sell. On the\r\nassumption that £100,000,000 would be sufficient to complete Land\r\nPurchase, this Bonus Fund was distributed at the rate of 12 per cent. on\r\nthe Purchase Money advanced. This rate was to be continued for a period of\r\nfive years. On the expiration of that period (November 1st, 1908) it was\r\nfound that proceedings for sale of Estates had been instituted to an\r\namount of between 70 and 80 millions, and that the amount remaining to be\r\nsold would probably approximate to another 80 millions. The Treasury\r\naccordingly, in accordance with powers given them in the 1903 Act, reduced\r\nthe percentage from 12 to 3 per cent. at which rate it would remain for at\r\nleast five years were a new Act not passed. Mr. Birrell’s Act, however,\r\nremoved the 12 million limit, and provided for the payment of a graduated\r\nBonus at rates ranging from 3 to 18 per cent., according to the number of\r\nyears’ purchase of the rent at which the landlords sell. The old rate of\r\nBonus tempted landlords to stand out for a high price: the new graduated\r\nrate offers an inducement to them to sell at a low price. It was\r\ncalculated that under the new provisions the capital sum for Bonus would\r\namount to at least 15 millions, which is likely to cost over 17 millions,\r\nowing to the necessity for excess Stock.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, Agreements representing 56 millions of purchase money\r\nwere awaiting completion through the Land Commission in 1909. In 1903 it\r\nhad been calculated that the annual output of the Land Commission would be\r\nfive millions, and at that rate it would take more than eleven years to\r\ncomplete these agreements. The block was due partly to the difficulty of\r\nraising more than a limited amount of money in each year; partly to the\r\nimpossibility of any department dealing with more than a limited number of\r\nsales in a year; and partly to the great rush of applications in 1908 when\r\nthe bonus revision was impending. The Act of 1909, in order to relieve the\r\nblock, gave Vendors under pending agreements an option to take 2-¾ per\r\ncent. Stock at 92 (3 per cent. investment) in whole or part liquidation of\r\ntheir Purchase Money. By virtue of certain statutory regulations, all\r\nVendors who exercise this option will be paid in a special priority\r\nsometimes years sooner than if they elected to be paid entirely in Cash.\r\nCash Sales, Stock Sales, and Future Agreements are dealt with _pari\r\npassu_, each class claiming on a separate fund.\r\n\r\nLand Purchase under the voluntary system operated least of all in places\r\nwhere its operation would have been most beneficial, and the congested\r\ndistricts derived comparatively little benefit from the Act of 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable of Number of Purchasers and Amount of Advances under the various\r\nLand Purchase Acts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a summary of the number of tenant purchasers and\r\nthe amount of advances issued under the various Acts from 1869 to March\r\n31st, 1912:\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\nAct.

The Statutes Relating to the Relief of Congestion in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Classes of Occupiers in Ireland—Establishment of the Congested\r\nDistricts Board\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the earlier Statutes which have been summarised in the first part\r\nof this chapter deal with the rights and obligations of Irish Tenants\r\nwithout any attempt at Economic discrimination. No distinction was drawn\r\nbetween the occupiers of uneconomic holdings and those who were able to\r\nmake a living and pay a rent out of their farms. Some slight recognition\r\nof the fact that the smaller tenants had a special claim to protection was\r\nshown by the Compensation for Disturbance Clause (Section 3) of the Act of\r\n1870, which enacted that a tenant of a holding valued at £10 or under\r\nmight be awarded a sum not exceeding seven years’ rent, while a tenant\r\nabove £100 Valuation could not in any case receive more than one year’s\r\nrent. Beyond that, however, nothing was done. It took many years to get\r\nthe Irish Administration to understand that something more than “Fixity of\r\nTenure” was necessary if the periodical famines and endemic misery of the\r\npoorer occupiers of the West and South of Ireland were to be fought\r\nsuccessfully. It was, however, finally recognised that, in many parts of\r\nthe country, the average character of the holdings was below the level\r\nwhich is necessary in order to make a reasonable standard of living\r\npossible, and it was then resolved to adopt special means to meet the\r\nevil. The establishment of the Congested Districts Board in 1891 was the\r\noutcome of this resolve. It was the first attempt made to discriminate by\r\nlegislation between the two great classes of Irish occupiers, namely,\r\nthose whose holdings were capable of affording a means of livelihood and\r\nof paying a rent; and those who were so impoverished as to be incapable of\r\nsupporting themselves without assistance from outside.\r\n\r\nThe word “Congestion,” as applied to land, has acquired a special and\r\npeculiar meaning in Ireland. It has become a term of art, and, like many\r\nanother word of the kind, has travelled far from its original meaning. It\r\ndoes not mean, as might be supposed, “pressure of population.” The\r\ndefinition of a “Congested District” given in the Act of 1891, is a\r\ndistrict in which more than 20 per cent. of the population live in\r\nelectoral divisions of which the total rateable value, when divided by the\r\nnumber of the population, gives a sum of less than 30s. for each person.\r\nThis definition is, of course, arbitrary, and in fact includes many\r\ndistricts through which a man might drive for miles without seeing a human\r\nhabitation, and excludes districts in which the population is in truth\r\n“Congested.”\r\n\r\nThe word connotes not the over-population of particular localities, but\r\nrather the condition of the people in those localities. Owing to various\r\nreasons, mainly historical, a population which, having regard to the means\r\nof subsistence, may be called excessive, is to be found on the large area\r\nof poor land that extends along the western seaboard of Ireland from\r\nDonegal to Cork. In some regions it is really “congested” and, as in such\r\nplaces the poverty of the people is most pronounced and obtrusive, the\r\nproblem was supposed to be one of “congestion,” and so the word came to be\r\nused. The true area of congestion is, of course, the western part of the\r\nIsland, but it must not be supposed that the same problem does not arise\r\nin other parts of Ireland—(even in the province of Leinster)—in an acute\r\nform. This was recognised by the framers of the Land Act of 1909, and now\r\nthe Estates Commissioners are empowered to purchase compulsorily, not only\r\nany congested estate, but also, in the case of any estate which does not\r\nas a whole come within the definition of a “Congested Estate,” any\r\ntownlands forming part of the Estate which are themselves “Congested.” The\r\ndefinition of a “Congested Estate” is “an Estate not less than half the\r\narea of which consists of holdings not exceeding seven pounds in rateable\r\nvalue or of mountain or bog land or not less than a quarter of the area of\r\nwhich is held in rundale or intermixed plots.” There is a further power\r\ngiven to the Commissioners to acquire compulsorily untenanted lands. Under\r\nthese powers the Estates Commissioners will be able to do for the rest of\r\nIreland what the Board is doing for the Congested Districts, namely: to\r\nturn the present uneconomic holdings into economic ones by the addition\r\nthereto of other lands; and further, by the consolidation of holdings held\r\nin rundale or in intermixed plots, to put an end to the waste of effort\r\ninherent in such a system.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatutes Dealing with Congestion\r\n\r\n\r\n    (Act of 1891—Act of 1893—Act of 1894—Act of 1896—Act of 1899—Act\r\n    of 1901—Act of 1903—Act of 1909)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Congested Districts Board was founded under the authority of Section\r\n34 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, to continue for twenty\r\nyears, “and thereafter until Parliament shall otherwise determine.” It was\r\ngiven power (Section 39) to aid migration and emigration within a\r\ncongested districts county, to sell suitable seed potatoes and seed oats\r\nto occupiers, to aid and develop agriculture, forestry, the breeding of\r\nlive stock and poultry, weaving, spinning, fishing (including the\r\nconstruction of piers and harbours, the supply of fishing boats and gear,\r\nand industries connected with fishing), and any other suitable industries.\r\nPowers were also given for the enlargement of holdings whether subject to\r\npurchase annuities, or to rents to private owners, but these powers were\r\nso circumscribed and guarded, as to be unworkable. The Board was granted\r\nan income to commence with of £41,250 a year. In 1893 an Act was passed\r\n(56 & 57 Vic., c. 35) which gave the Board power to acquire land and to\r\nhold it as landlords for the enlargement of holdings and for the purpose\r\nof the Land Purchase Acts. In 1894 another Act was passed which enabled\r\nthe Board to give to the Land Commission, on selling to a tenant\r\npurchaser, a guarantee for the repayment of the annuity. Such guarantee\r\nenabled the Land Commission to dispense with their retention of any sum\r\nout of the purchase money as a guarantee deposit, a practice which, if\r\nfollowed, would have seriously crippled the operations of the Board. The\r\nLand Law Act of 1896 gave power to the Board to obtain an advance from the\r\nLand Commission for the purchase of estates “in like manner as if the\r\nBoard were a tenant purchasing his holding.” This Act contained some\r\nprovisions that greatly hampered the Board. Thus an advance could not be\r\nobtained by a tenant valued at under £10 for the repurchase of his holding\r\nfrom the Board. Also Section 40 (2) enabled Court tenants and temporary\r\ntenants to obtain advances under the Purchase Acts in the case of sales of\r\nestates under the section in the Land Judges’ Court. This meant that the\r\nlands that were most required by the Board for the Relief of Congestion\r\nwere commonly disposed of to graziers and others. The Congested Districts\r\nAct of 1899 cleared away these two obstacles to the work of the Board, and\r\nalso enabled the Land Commission to make advances for the redemption of\r\nhead rents and other “superior interests,” and increased the Parliamentary\r\nGrant from £6,500 to £25,000. The Congested Districts Board Act of 1901\r\ngave a limited power of dealing with obstructive tenants in the\r\nrearrangement of the estates purchased. It also gave the Board all the\r\npowers of entry on a holding subject to a statutory tenancy for the\r\npurposes of mining, quarrying, cutting timber or turf, opening or making\r\nroads, fences, drains, and water-courses, hunting, fishing, shooting,\r\netc., given to the landlord by Section 5 (subsection 5) of the Act of\r\n1881, and further extended these powers to holdings not subject to\r\nstatutory tenancies. The Act also enabled the Board to purchase land\r\noutside a congested districts county with the approval of the\r\nLord-Lieutenant. The Land Act of 1903 gave facilities to the Board for the\r\npurchase of estates, similar to those given to the Estates Commissioners\r\nunder the Act. It also gave the Board the discretionary power of deciding\r\nwhether an advance should be made to a purchaser; of what amount the\r\nadvance should be; and how far the security was sufficient. The collection\r\nof the purchase annuities so made, was, however, still left to the Land\r\nCommission. The Act added £20,000 to the annual income of the Board, to be\r\ndrawn from the Irish Development Grant (Section 38).\r\n\r\nUnder Mr. Birrell’s Act of 1909 the constitution, powers, duties and\r\nincome of the Board were reconstituted and enlarged. The new Board\r\nconsists of fourteen members, three of whom are _ex-officio_, namely, the\r\nChief Secretary, the Under-Secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant and the\r\nVice-President of the Department of Agriculture; nine are appointed by the\r\nCrown; and two are paid permanent members. The annual income of the Board\r\nwas raised from £86,250 to £250,000, and its operations were extended so\r\nas to comprise the counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo,\r\nGalway, Kerry, and parts of the counties of Clare and Cork. It was enacted\r\nthat thenceforward no Congested Estate could be sold under the Land\r\nPurchase Acts in a congested districts county to persons other than the\r\nCongested Districts Board without the consent of that Board; that the Land\r\nCommission before entering into an agreement for the purchase of any land\r\nin a congested districts county, should obtain the consent of the Board;\r\nand the power of purchasing estates and land compulsorily through the\r\nEstates Commissioners was given to the Board within all congested\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nUp to February 1st, 1911, the Congested Districts Board had purchased\r\nestates of the value of £1,813,568, and of this, lands of the value of\r\n£1,710,304 then remained unsold. The remainder, so far as they were\r\n“tenanted lands,” had been sold to the tenants, and, so far as they were\r\n“untenanted lands,” had been used in enlarging the neighbouring holdings\r\nor in the creation of new holdings. In the latter cases, the new farms\r\nwere fenced and drained and houses built thereon. On some estates where\r\nthe tenants held in rundale or had joint rights of grazing over parts of\r\nthe land, the Board “striped” the whole estate, giving to each tenant an\r\nenlarged and compact holding, properly drained and fenced. An example of\r\nthe excellent work done on such an estate can be seen by anyone who will\r\npay a visit to Clare Island at the mouth of Clew Bay in the County of\r\nMayo. An example of the work done in creating new holdings can perhaps\r\nbest be seen on the Dillon Estate in the County of Roscommon.\r\n\r\nSince the passing of the Act of 1909 the most extravagant ideas as to the\r\npowers of the Board have got abroad among the people of the congested\r\nareas, and applications are being made to them from every estate—almost\r\nfrom every parish—to purchase and divide up particular lands. The area of\r\nthe congested counties under their control amounts to 7,658,114 acres, or\r\nabout one-third of the whole of Ireland. Even assuming that a large number\r\nof these applications should not be granted, there still remains a residue\r\nof work to be done which would tax the capacity of a Board many times\r\nstronger both in resources and staff than the Congested Districts Board.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Board is possessed of large tracts of land which\r\nthey annually let on grazing contracts or which they stock themselves.\r\nThis is not as it should be, for, when the people see lands taken by the\r\nBoard used year after year as pasture, they begin to lose faith in the\r\ncapacity and usefulness of the institution.\r\n\r\nIt is not the fault of the Board. It would take a much bigger income than\r\nthey possess and a much bigger staff than they command, to cope with the\r\nwork which they have to do and which ought to be done.\r\n\r\nParliament has now given them enormous and compulsory powers. Immense\r\npressure will be put on them to exercise these powers, and in many cases\r\nif the powers were exercised it would be for the lasting benefit of the\r\ncountry. If the Board are to carry out fully the work which they have been\r\ncreated to do, the Government must in the near future again come to their\r\nassistance. With their present resources, their task is well-nigh\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III. Statutes Relating to the Provision of Allotments of Land and\r\nDwellings for Agricultural Labourers in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (Act of 1883—Act of 1885—Act of 1886—Act of 1891—Act of 1892—Act\r\n    of 1896—Act of 1903—Part IV. of the Irish Land Act, 1903—Act of\r\n    1906)\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Act of 1883 little or nothing had been done to meet the\r\nwant of better housing for the agricultural labourers in Ireland. Their\r\ncondition was deplorable. The houses in which they lived were almost\r\neverywhere throughout the country of the worst description. In fact, they\r\nwere little better than hovels.\r\n\r\nBy the Acts of 1883 to 1906, the Rural District Councils of Ireland were\r\nempowered to obtain loans to provide suitable dwellings and allotments of\r\nland for agricultural labourers. The loans might be applied, subject to\r\nthe approval of the Local Government Board, for any of the following\r\npurposes: the acquisition of land either for new cottages and allotments\r\nor for additional allotments; the acquisition of existing houses; the\r\nerection of new houses; the legal, engineering and incidental expenses in\r\nconnection with these purposes. The amount of land which might be allotted\r\nto any one labourer was not to exceed one statute acre.\r\n\r\nThe expression “agricultural labourer” is defined by Section 4 of the Act\r\nof 1886 as “a man or woman who does agricultural work for hire at any\r\nseason of the year on the land of some other person or persons, and shall\r\ninclude handloom weavers and fishermen doing agricultural work as\r\naforesaid and shall also include herdsmen.” By Section 93 of the Land Act\r\nof 1903 (Part IV. of which is construed as one of the Labourers Acts) the\r\nearlier definition is enlarged so as to include “any person (other than a\r\ndomestic or menial servant) working for hire in a rural district whose\r\naverage wages in the year preceding the lodgment of any representation\r\nunder the Labourers Acts affecting him do not exceed two shillings and\r\nsixpence a day, and who is not in occupation of land exceeding one quarter\r\nof an acre.” These definitions are very wide and, practically speaking,\r\nenable the Sanitary Authority to provide cottages and allotments for all\r\nlabourers in rural districts, who are thus placed on somewhat the same\r\nfooting as artisans in urban districts are placed under the Housing of the\r\nWorking Classes Act. The Rural District Councils are given power to\r\nacquire, compulsorily or by agreement, the necessary lands from the owner\r\neither by purchase of the fee simple or on a lease for a term not\r\nexceeding ninety-nine years. If the lands are acquired compulsorily in\r\nfee, the amounts to be paid to the owners and occupiers are fixed by an\r\narbitrator appointed by the Local Government Board; if the lands are\r\nacquired compulsorily for a term of years, the rents to be paid are fixed\r\nby the Land Commission.\r\n\r\nIf the Council cannot agree with the owner as to the price to be paid,\r\nthey must prepare a scheme showing the lands it is purposed to take, and\r\nthe scheme must be confirmed by an Inspector of the Irish Local Government\r\nBoard. Any person interested can appeal, at their option, either to the\r\nCounty Court Judge or to the Local Government Board. In either case the\r\ndecision is final. There is no appeal against the price fixed by the\r\narbitrator unless the amount awarded exceeds one thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nPrior to the passing of the Act of 1906, the loans for the purposes of the\r\nLabourers Acts were advanced by the Commissioners of Public Works and were\r\nrepayable by annuities which included principal and interest. The rates of\r\ninterest varied according to the number of years during which the\r\nannuities were payable, and at the passing of the Act of 1906 were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nPeriod.           Rate of           Annuity\r\n                  Interest.         covering\r\n                                    Principal and\r\n                                    Interest.\r\n20 years          3-½ per cent.     £7   0s.   9d.\r\n30 years          3-¾               £5  12s.   2d.\r\n40 years          4                 £5   1s.   1d.\r\n50 years          4-¼               £4  17s.   2d.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1906 enabled the Rural District Councils to obtain advances for\r\nthe purposes of the Labourers Acts up to 4-¼ millions from the Land\r\nCommission out of the Irish Land Purchase Fund, and provided that such\r\nadvances were to be repayable in like manner as the advances under the\r\nIrish Land Act of 1903, that is to say, by annuities at 3-¼ per cent.\r\n(covering both principal and interest) and payable for 68-½ years. This\r\nannuity rate has been continued in the case of advances for the purposes\r\nof the Labourers Acts by the Irish Land Act, 1909, which Act increased the\r\nannuity rate to 3-½ per cent. in respect of all advances for lands\r\npurchased under the Land Purchase Acts since September 15th, 1909.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the terms of repayment for loans under the\r\nLabourers Acts were made much easier by the Act of 1906 than they were\r\nunder the previous Labourers Acts. That Act further provided that only 64\r\nper cent. of the charge was to be borne by the local rates; the remaining\r\n36 per cent. being defrayed, as to 16 per cent. out of the Labourers’\r\nCottages Fund established by the Act, and as to 20 per cent. out of the\r\nIrish Development Grant. There was placed at the disposal of the Local\r\nGovernment Board the following sums for the purposes of the Labourers’\r\nCottages Fund: A capital sum of £150,000 taken from the Petty Sessions\r\nClerks’ Fund; a principal sum of £7,000 taken from the Ireland Development\r\nGrant, an annual sum of £6,000 to be deducted from the Exchequer\r\nContribution mentioned in Section 5 of the Land Purchase Act of 1891, and\r\nan annual sum of £9,000, equivalent to the savings to be effected by the\r\nabolition of two Irish Judgeships and a reduction in the salary of the\r\nLord Chancellor of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBy an amending Act passed in 1911 a further sum of £36,000 cash, and 2-½\r\nper cent. Consolidated Stock to the nominal value of £30,000, both taken\r\nout of the Fund of Suitors in the Supreme Court, were added to the\r\nLabourers’ Cottages Fund.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the change made by the Act of 1906 has been to reduce the\r\ncharge per £100 on the rates from £4 17s. 2d. (the lowest amount payable\r\nbefore that Act) to £2 1s. 7d. the amount payable now—a reduction of\r\nalmost 57 per cent.\r\n\r\nUnder the Acts of 1883 to 1896, 22,588 cottages were built, and the loans\r\nsanctioned amounted to £3,600,000. Under the Act of 1906, 12,821\r\nadditional cottages have been built, 5,057 are in course of erection, and\r\nothers have been sanctioned or are awaiting sanction. The loans sanctioned\r\nunder the Act amount to close on 4-¼ millions. This is the amount provided\r\nfor by the Act of 1906. Another million on the same terms as the 4-¼\r\nmillions was provided by the amending Act of last year.\r\n\r\nThe average cost of each cottage built has been £175, and the average rent\r\npaid for a cottage with half an acre of land is 10d. per week, and for a\r\ncottage with an acre of land about 1s. per week.\r\n\r\nThe Labourers Act of 1906 included agricultural labourers in the class of\r\npersons to whom a parcel of untenanted land might be allotted by the\r\nEstates Commissioners, where the agricultural labourer had for a period,\r\nnot less than five years immediately preceding, been resident on the\r\nestate or in the immediate neighbourhood thereof, but it provided that in\r\nno case should any advance be made to a labourer to purchase a parcel of\r\nland so long as he was in occupation of a tenancy under the Acts. The Act\r\nalso empowered the Estates Commissioners to make advances to Rural\r\nDistrict Councils, as trustees under Section 4 of the Irish Land Act,\r\n1903, to purchase parcels of untenanted land for the purposes of the\r\nLabourers Acts.\r\n\r\nThe Labourers Acts and their administration have been, on the whole,\r\nextremely successful. No legislation passed during the last thirty years\r\nwas more entirely needed, and none has been more beneficial to the\r\ncountry. The benefit is one which no one who travelled through Ireland\r\nthirty years ago, and who travels through it again to-day can fail to\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nWhere dilapidated hovels stood formerly, decent cottages stand to-day. A\r\ngreat deal still remains to be done, but what has been done has been, on\r\nthe whole, well done. Up to the present there has been no inquiry ever\r\nasked for into the working of the Acts. That fact in itself shows that no\r\nserious dissatisfaction has been felt with their administration. However,\r\nfrom time to time complaints are heard which should be attended to;\r\ncomplaints as to the unsuitability of the people for whom cottages have\r\nbeen built; as to the size or workmanship of the cottages; as to a number\r\nof the cottages, remaining untenanted; and more often as to jobbery in\r\nrespect of the sites chosen. Considering the amount of work done, it is\r\nsurprising that the complaints have been so few. Nevertheless, it would be\r\nwell that an inquiry should be held. It would tend to prevent any existing\r\nabuses from increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart IV. Compulsory Registration of Land in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1865 a Record of Title Act was passed for Ireland. Its\r\noperation was confined to lands sold through the Landed Estates Court.\r\nAbout 680 titles were recorded under it. It failed, largely because it was\r\nnot compulsory.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1891 the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act was passed.\r\nAll lands sold under the Land Purchase Acts and vested in purchasing\r\ntenants subject to land purchase annuities, are thereby required to be\r\nregistered in the central or local offices of the Land Registry. There is\r\na local office in each county in Ireland and a central office in the City\r\nof Dublin, which is also the local office as regards lands in the county\r\nof Dublin. When the holdings are vested in the purchasing tenants by the\r\nLand Commission that department furnishes to the Land Registry the\r\nnecessary particulars for the registration of the lands. These particulars\r\nare entered on the registers and the boundaries of the holdings are\r\ndelineated on the registry maps. A certificate, which is a copy of the\r\nfolio of the register, is then issued to the purchaser.\r\n\r\nAll subsequent dealings with the land must be registered, and no estate is\r\nacquired by the transferee of registered land until his name is put on the\r\nregister as owner of the lands transferred (Section 25).\r\n\r\nAll registered land is divisible on the death of the registered holder\r\nintestate “_as if it were personal estate_” (Section 85).\r\n\r\nLands acquired by Rural District Councils under the Labourers Acts are\r\nalso compulsorily registered in the Land Register.\r\n\r\nThe title of each purchasing tenant is registered on the application of\r\nthe Land Commission and without any application by him. As no\r\ninvestigation of any of these titles is possible, each holding is\r\nregistered “subject to equities,” that is, subject to any rights of third\r\npersons interested in the land. Before a transfer of the holding is\r\nexecuted these equities are, as a rule, discharged.\r\n\r\nWhen the work of the Land Purchase Acts has been completed, practically\r\nthe whole land of Ireland will be registered. The principal effect of such\r\nregistration will be to facilitate the sale of land by reducing the cost\r\nand simplifying the process of transfer. Registration of title exists\r\nwherever a peasant proprietary has been established. It is almost a\r\nnecessary concomitant of such ownership.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Act has been conceived on right lines, but it will in the near\r\nfuture need much amendment.\r\n\r\nIt needs simplification. The process of registration is too complicated\r\nand too slow; there are too many burdens on the lands which do not require\r\nregistration, and in consequence, there are too many matters which, on a\r\nsale, must be inquired into and so add to the price of transfer. Above\r\nall, registered land should be declared to be personal property and should\r\nnot merely be made to descend “_as if it were personal estate_.” These\r\nwords have already on numerous occasions occupied the attention of the\r\njudges, and their full meaning has not yet been made clear. The effect of\r\nthe various decisions is that, while registered land descends on a death\r\nintestate to the next of kin as if it were personal estate, for every\r\nother purpose it is to be regarded as “real estate.” To a lawyer the\r\nposition is full of interest; to the ordinary layman it is absurd; for the\r\ncommunity it is most mischievous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. A HISTORICAL ARGUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.—Irish Nationality. BY MRS. J. R. GREEN\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Justice requires power, intelligence, and will.”—(_Leonardo da\r\n    Vinci_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sinister information,” reported a Governor of Ireland under Henry VIII.,\r\n“hath been of more hindrance to the reformation of Ireland than all the\r\nrebels and Irishry within the realm.” The complaint is as true to-day as\r\nit was nearly four hundred years ago, for false tongues still gain power\r\nthrough ignorance. Irish history has the misfortune of being at the same\r\ntime trite and unknown. Men hear with the old acquiescence the old\r\nformulæ, and the well-known words carry to them the solace of the ancient\r\nprejudices.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed in these latter days a change of accusation. In former\r\ntimes Irishmen were marked off as an inferior people, but within the last\r\nfew years the attack is altered; and it is now the fashion to assume that\r\nthe Irish fail, not as individuals, but only in their corporate capacity.\r\nTo Irishmen is still denied “the delight of admiration and the duty of\r\nreverence.” Holding in their hearts the image of a nation, they are warned\r\nnot to ask whether it was a nation of any value, whether there has been\r\nany conspicuous merit which justifies the devotion that the Irish people\r\nfeel to their race, and which may claim the regard of others. For it is\r\nnot enough to have the mere instinct of passion for our country, unless\r\nour heart and reason are convinced that we give our allegiance to a people\r\nthat, in spite of human errors, has been of noble habit and distinguished\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThe policy of “Unionist” leaders is to meet the Irish desire for an\r\nuplifting pride in the life of the Irish commonwealth by a flat denial.\r\nIreland, we are told, is not, nor ever has been, nor ever can be, a\r\nnation. A disorganized and contentious people, incapable of rightly using\r\nany polity Irish or English, we have not, it is said, even the materials\r\nof a nation. We are only “material,” to use an old Irish expression, for\r\nan Empire. The island in fact was never a kingdom till England gave it a\r\nking worthy the name; so how could it be a nation? To the gift of a king\r\nEngland added her invention of a Parliament, but the failure of Parliament\r\nin Ireland was open and flagrant; how then talk about a nation?\r\n\r\n\r\n    “There are Englishmen and Scotchmen,” says Mr. Balfour, “who\r\n    really suppose that England has deprived Ireland of its own\r\n    national institutions, has absorbed Ireland, which had a polity\r\n    and a civilization of its own—has absorbed it in the wider sphere\r\n    of British politics; and who think that a great wrong has thereby\r\n    been done to a separate nationality.... It is a profound illusion.\r\n    It has no basis in historical fact at all.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe gives a history of his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Those whom the Nationalists choose more particularly and\r\n    especially to call Irishmen, namely, the original inhabitants of\r\n    Ireland—those who were there before the Celt and before the Saxon\r\n    and before the Norman—never had the chance of developing, they\r\n    never could have developed, a polity of their own, any more than\r\n    the Highlanders. That does not mean that they are in any sense\r\n    inferior, but it does mean that all this talk of restoring to\r\n    Ireland Irish institutions, and of governing Ireland according to\r\n    Irish ideas, has no historic basis whatever.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is for such wayward imaginings that the historic claim of Ireland is\r\ndenied. What meaning shall we give to this new dogma of the partiality of\r\nNationalists for some pre-Celtic race—whether Iberian, or whether (as some\r\nexplain the phrase) Finn MacCumhaill and his followers, ingeniously\r\nregarded by Mr. Balfour as having adorned Ireland before the Celtic age?\r\nWhere was the “Saxon” settlement in Ireland between the Celts and the\r\nNormans? What is the comparison of the Highlanders with the original\r\ninhabitants of Ireland? Why should Mr. Balfour’s doubts of a pre-Celtic\r\npolity put an end to all talk of Irish institutions and Irish ideas?\r\n\r\nTo come to somewhat later times, under the clan system, says Mr. Balfour,\r\nit was impossible to rise to civilization. “And when England dealt with\r\nIreland, Ireland was completely under the tribal system” (a theory false\r\nto history). The superior English polity in due time, however, spread its\r\nhand over Iberian chaos. “An Irish Parliament is a British invention”—the\r\nword, with Mr. Balfour’s easy adjustment of history to politics, is\r\nprobably chosen to give the Scotch a gratuitous share in the credit, with\r\na compliment to their spirit; for, as he says, “my Lowland ancestors in\r\nScotland had precisely the same contempt for my Highland fellow-countrymen\r\nas the English had for the Irish in Ireland”—(the word Lowland being here\r\nmisused in a non-historic sense). “Every political idea in Ireland is of\r\nEnglish growth—the Irish dependent Parliament, the Irish independent\r\nParliament—it is all of British extraction.” Mr. Balfour seems to imagine\r\nin his indifferent way that the “dependent form” was the first; he seems\r\nto guess that it was a single form, “_the_ dependent Parliament”; and he\r\ncalls his “independent Parliament” “a practically sovereign legislature.”\r\nIt would be hard to gather more fundamental errors into one sentence. At\r\nany rate in his simplified scheme both forms of “the British invention”\r\nfailed in Ireland. But in the success of the Union and the assembly at\r\nWestminster, England has established successfully what Mr. Balfour calls\r\n“the unity which we have inherited from our forefathers.”\r\n\r\nSuch are the “General Principles” which Mr. Balfour—speaking with all the\r\nauthority of an “Unionist” statesman, head of a great English party,\r\nleader for a generation of those who refuse to Ireland any claim to\r\nnational memory or national hope, absolute ruler for four years of that\r\nisland—has issued in his book “Aspects of Home Rule” to rally his\r\nfollowers. This confusion of fictions, in all their brave untruth,\r\nfurnishes the historic background and justification of the Unionist creed.\r\nWe might not easily expect an “Imperial” leader so far to forego respect\r\nfor himself or for his public.\r\n\r\nThere is an Old Irish proverb: “Three candles that illumine every\r\ndarkness: truth, nature, knowledge.” But Mr. Balfour is as a man for his\r\npleasure wandering in the dark among the tombs of vain things. And from\r\nplaces of death comes as of old “sinister information” to minister to\r\nignorance and prejudice, and to be still the hindrance to the reformation\r\nof Ireland.\r\n\r\nThese comprehensive charges cover the two strongly-contrasted periods of\r\nIrish history—the period of Gaelic civilization, and that of Norman, or\r\nlater of English settlement. All races are alike condemned. The one people\r\nhad no institutions. The other misused what were given to it. In either\r\ncase the fault is said to be “Irish”—the general word of contempt.\r\nConfounded together by Mr. Balfour for his own purposes, the two\r\naccusations have nothing in common, and must be separately considered if\r\nwe wish to think justly.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, observe that to both races is denied the praise of a\r\n“nation” or “nationality.”\r\n\r\nThe definition of a “nation” may be varied: every man has his opinion,\r\nfor, as the old Irish saying went, “’tis his own head he has on him.” But\r\nin the matter nature and history cannot be wholly set aside, and we may\r\nattach some importance to the unity of a country, the persistence of its\r\nrace, and the continuity of its life. If we consider outward form, who\r\never thinks of the map of Great Britain as a whole? The form that is in\r\nmen’s minds is of two configurations, one of England and one of Scotland,\r\ntwo countries mapped out on separate sheets. The names of the countries\r\nhave changed, Alban and Scotland; Britain and England; and the title of\r\nthe whole is a somewhat awkward evasion or compromise. Ireland on the\r\nother hand has its unchangeable boundaries fixed by the Ocean, its\r\nprovinces from immemorial times subordinate territories of the undivided\r\ncountry. Its successive peoples, perhaps for some four thousand years,\r\nhave never known it but by one name, Erin; or by the variations of that\r\nname as it passed into other speech, Iberia, Hibernia, Ire-land. The Old\r\nIrish knew it some fourteen hundred years ago as their “Fatherland.” As\r\nfar back as we can go the unity of the country as a whole is prominent in\r\ntheir thought; as, for example, in an ancient poem on the passing of the\r\npagan world and the triumph of Christianity:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “God’s counsel at every time concerning virgin Erin is greater\r\n    than can be told; though glittering Liffey is thine to-day, it has\r\n    been the land of others in their turn.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Irish period a legend of the coming to Tara of the most\r\nancient of all the sages carried to the people the same rapt love of\r\nIreland. When all the assembly rose up before him:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “There is no need to make rejoicing for me, for I am sure of your\r\n    welcome as every son is sure of his foster-mother, and this, then,\r\n    is my foster-mother,” said Fintan, “the island in which ye are,\r\n    even Erin, and the familiar knee of this island in which ye are,\r\n    namely, Tara. Moreover it is the mast and the produce, the flowers\r\n    and the food of this island that have sustained me from the deluge\r\n    until this day. And I am skilled in its feasts and its\r\n    cattle-spoils, its destructions and its courtships, in all that\r\n    have taken place from the deluge until now.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery race in turn that entered Ireland drank in the spirit of the soil:\r\nall became citizens of the one land. Even that gift of “English invention”\r\nand “British extraction,” the Pale Parliament, was by mere human nature\r\nand necessity stirred to loyalty for “the land of Ireland.” “More\r\nconveniently,” so they urged in a statute of 1460, “a proper coin distinct\r\nfrom the coin of the realm of England was to be had therein.” And the\r\nAnglo-Norman colonists decreed that of the coins they ordered one should\r\nbe called an “_Irelands_,” with that name engraven on it, and the other a\r\n“_Patrick_,” with the name and cross of the national Irish saint.\r\n\r\nThis persistence of the name of Ireland with its national pride, and its\r\nperpetual recalling of a distinct people, was displeasing to Englishmen in\r\nthe height of their “godly conquest.” If the name was extinguished the\r\nfact might be more easily denied. They pleaded, as we learn in the Carew\r\nPapers (I. 251-2), for its disappearance, in the true spirit of modern\r\nUnionism. When Paul IV. gave to Philip and Mary the title of King and\r\nQueen of Ireland:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Men of judgment, ... thought it a vanity, not seeing what profit,\r\n    either of authority or honour, it might bring to a King to have\r\n    many titles in the country which he possesseth, considering that\r\n    the Most Christian King is more honoured by the only title of King\r\n    of France, than if his state were divided into as many kingly\r\n    titles as he hath provinces.... But it seemed hard to induce\r\n    England to quit that which two kings had used, and the Queen, not\r\n    thinking much of it, had continued.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was indeed a power in nature far older than the habit of two English\r\nkings; and in spite of the Unionist grumblings the ancient name survived,\r\nand the ancient fact. Cardinal Pole was appointed legate to “the realms of\r\nEngland and Ireland.” Our ambassadors and consuls still carry with them\r\nabroad the significant title “of Great Britain and Ireland”; and we may\r\nread in a Russian newspaper concerned with the East, of the “policy of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland in Afghanistan.”\r\n\r\nThe persistence of race in Ireland was no less remarkable than the triumph\r\nof its name. There are some who profess to distinguish the Iberians. We\r\nknow that successive streams of immigrants, Danes, Normans, English,\r\nFrench, have been merged in the commonwealth. But the Registrar-General\r\ngives, in spite of outgoings of the Celtic and incomings of Teutonic\r\npeoples, an overwhelming majority of men of Celtic blood and name—a\r\nmajority which is in fact less than the truth, owing to the continual\r\nchange during centuries of Celtic into English surnames. But it is not on\r\npurity of race that Ireland, any more than other countries, would rely.\r\nDifference in blood was recognised, but it was not held a bar to\r\npatriotism. Ireland was the common country to which all races who entered\r\nit were bound by every human interest. It had a unity of its own, which as\r\n“the Pale” shrank and the sense of country deepened, laid hold on the\r\nminds of the later as of the earlier inhabitants. Belfast Orangemen\r\nindeed, as “the loyalists of Ireland,” accepted the doctrine in 1886 that\r\na Parliament in Dublin chosen by the whole Irish people “must be to them a\r\n_foreign_ and _alien_ assembly.” It was the echo of an old fiction. We\r\nknow that the ascendency of a constantly recruited English group, above\r\nall of safe men born in England and consequently held worthy of trust\r\nthere, was for seven centuries the favourite dream of English politicians;\r\nand that it invariably failed before the broader and humaner influences\r\nthat move communities of men dwelling side by side under the equal\r\nheavens. Faithful citizens of Norman or English stock did brave service\r\nfor their country: “Ireland-men” they called themselves, or “commonwealth\r\nmen,” or “good ‘country men’ as they would be gloriously termed.” What\r\nname indeed is there for men of Ireland to take unless they frankly own\r\ntheir country? The term chosen for them by _The Times_: “The British\r\nColony on the other side of St. George’s Channel” will scarcely endure.\r\n\r\nMr. Balfour is probably the last statesman to press a claim to ascendency\r\nin the partial favour of Great Britain for a selected group, “who, of all\r\nothers in the United Kingdom, surely deserve the protection of England and\r\nScotland.” It is a curious return in these days of equal citizenship to\r\nthe tyrannical distinctions of the middle ages—“wild Irish our enemies,\r\nIrish rebels, and obedient English,” who had varying claims on the\r\ndominating race according to their deserts.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the special charges urged against Gaelic life in\r\nIreland. The island may be the same, and the race of ancient date, and\r\nwith no less than their ancient pride; but what of that, if the people\r\ncould not have, nor ever did have, a polity of their own, nor any Irish\r\ninstitutions nor an Irish idea of government? “The fiction has been\r\nassiduously propagated,” says a Unionist writer in the _Morning Post_, “by\r\nthe Irish extreme section ... that the nationhood of Ireland is a thing\r\nwhich once had an actual objective existence.... But such teaching,\r\nhowever romantically attractive, is simply incompatible with the plain\r\nfacts of history. Ireland as a political entity dates from the period of\r\nthe conquest by England, when for the first time the princes and\r\nchieftains with their followers were fused into something like national\r\nunity.” So Macedon might have boasted that for the first time it had put\r\nsome order into Greece, given it a political entity, and brought it into\r\nline with modern Imperial civilization.\r\n\r\nIs this unhistoric statement all the Unionists have in the end got to give\r\nus of the Irish story? Is there nothing behind it—no trace of any soul of\r\nthe people in Ireland? How then was it that with so incomplete a military\r\nor political organization, they could defy for centuries the whole power\r\nof England? Ireland in fact drew her strength from a remarkable State\r\nsystem of her own. In the Gaelic form of civilization the national\r\nsentiment did not gather round a military king, as in the Teutonic states,\r\nbut round a common learning, literature, and tradition; and this exalted\r\nbelief in the spiritual existence of a nation, though it is not the\r\nEnglish idea of a kingdom, may belong nevertheless to a high order of\r\nhuman aspiration. It produced in Ireland a literature which has not been\r\nsurpassed among any people for its profound and ardent sense of\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nThe union of the Irish people lay in the absolute community of learning,\r\ninstitutions, and law. Irish law was one of the most striking products of\r\nIrish genius. If we know nothing of its beginnings, we see it as a body of\r\ncustom that spread over the entire country, varying not at all from\r\nprovince to province. Highly finished, highly technical, worked on for\r\nhundreds of years by successive commentators, it still remained the law of\r\nthe people, and claimed their allegiance—an allegiance could only have\r\nbeen possible to a law founded on reason and justice, and expedient and\r\nefficient in practice. If we take that which in an agricultural country\r\ncomes home to every peasant—the land system—the native law in Ireland was\r\nequal, enduring, and respected. The farmer was assured a fair rent and\r\ncompensation for improvements. No chief in Ireland could molest the people\r\nin their ancient privilege; he could neither evict them, nor take their\r\ngrazing-lands, nor make a forest waste and impose a forest law for his\r\nhunting. Five hundred years after the Norman invasion Irish farmers\r\nholding under the old Irish law were still paying the same rent that their\r\nforefathers had paid centuries before. It is certain that no system can\r\nwholly prevent misfortune, injustice, or usurpation; but there seems to\r\nhave been among the people a social content far beyond that in mediæval\r\nEngland, a long security of farmers, a passionate belief in their land\r\nsystem, an extraordinary tenacity in its defence against any other, and as\r\nfar as we can see no bitterness of classes. A satirist might mock at the\r\ndepth of the chief’s pocket, as deep as the pocket of the Church or of the\r\npoet; but the Irish no more wanted to get rid of the chief than of the\r\npoet or the priest. In Tudor times the only way in which a chief could be\r\nabsolutely alienated and divided from his people was by pledging him to\r\nthe English land system and government.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were further reminded of their essential unity by the great\r\ngenealogical compilations in which every element of the population, Celtic\r\nand aboriginal, free and unfree, were traced to a common ancestry. Pride\r\nin the country which they possessed was maintained by the _Dinnsenchus_ or\r\ncollection of topographical legends dealing with hundreds of places,\r\nmountains, rivers, earthworks, roads, strands, venerable trees, in every\r\nnook and corner of Ireland—none elsewhere—all evidently things of interest\r\nto the whole people. The dignity of their race and history was recalled to\r\nthem in the semi-legendary history of pagan Ireland—which is really a\r\ngreat epic in prose and verse, in two main sections, the Book of Invasions\r\nand the Irish Book of Kings. The subject of this work is simply Ireland.\r\nIt has no other connecting motive than to satisfy the desire of the Irish\r\nto possess a complete and brilliant picture of Ireland from all antiquity.\r\nThe charge was a solemn one, and carried out by generations of scholars\r\nwith exact fidelity. There is no parallel elsewhere to the writing down of\r\nthe great pagan epics five hundred years after Christianity, with no more\r\ndirect influence of Christianity on them than we might find in the Odyssey\r\nor the Iliad.\r\n\r\nNor was their language the least of the spiritual possessions of the\r\nGaelic people—that language which, following their people over Scotland,\r\nLowlands and Highlands and the Isles, remained for some fourteen centuries\r\nthe symbol of immemorial unity of their race. The pride of the race in\r\ntheir language was beyond that of any other people in Europe outside of\r\nthe Greeks and Romans. Grammars of Irish were written in the eighth or\r\nninth centuries, perhaps earlier, full of elaborate declensions and minute\r\nrules, accounts of obsolete words and forms and esoteric literary jargons,\r\ntreatises on the Ogham alphabet, dictionaries of celebrated men and women\r\nof Ireland from remote antiquity, numerous festilogies of the national\r\nsaints in prose and verse, with their pedigrees and legends. What mediæval\r\nlanguage in Europe had a school of grammarians, and at what date? It may\r\nseem strange to Englishmen that this affection should have stirred the\r\nhearts of pastoral and agricultural people; but no Irish man was far\r\nremoved from the immaterial and spiritual life of his country. The famous\r\nworks in verse and prose, the stories, the hymns, and the songs of heroes\r\nold and new, were known by heart, and handed down faithfully for centuries\r\nin thousands of cabins; and the Irish tiller of the ground in remote\r\nplaces has even in our own day a rich vocabulary of six or seven thousand\r\nwords. The pleasure and pride of art, so widely diffused among the mass of\r\nthe people by the Irish scheme of life and education, became a natural\r\npart of the Irishman’s thoughts. Their main concern in the Danish\r\ndevastations was the threatened destruction of an ancient order of\r\ncivilization. Before the “flood of outlanders,” says the “Colloquy of the\r\nSages,” written probably before 850, “every art will be buffoonery, and\r\nevery falsehood will be chosen.” Poems would be dark, music would be given\r\nover to boors, and embroidery to fools and base women so that no more\r\nbeauty of colour could be expected; everyone will turn his art into false\r\nteaching and false intelligence, to seek to surpass his teacher.\r\nInstruction and skill would end, they lamented, with lawful princes and\r\nsages, belief and offerings, the respect of ranks and families, due honour\r\nof the young to the old, the ordered hospitality of the wealthy, and the\r\nhigh justice on the hilltop: “On every hill-top treachery will adventure.”\r\n\r\nThe great expression of Gaelic life was the assembly of the people, those\r\n“parles upon hills” that seemed so grievous to Elizabethan rulers. In\r\nevery Federal State, such as Leinster or Munster, and in every petty\r\nState, they were the ever-recurring guarantee of the national\r\ncivilization. The feeling of the people is shown by the constant\r\nreferences to “frequent assemblies,” “an assembly according to rules,” “a\r\nlawful synod.” The serious organization of these gatherings in stately\r\nform had been brought to a fine art. The business and science of the\r\ncountry was there open to the whole democracy. Many were the directions\r\nfor the right conduct of those who took part in the assemblies—against\r\nstiffness of delivery, a muttering speech, hair-splitting, uncertain\r\nproofs, despising books, inciting the multitude, very violent urging,\r\nplaying a dangerous game to disconcert the meeting, above all against\r\nignorant or false pleading. The authority of the assembly in its\r\nexposition of the law was never questioned by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Irishmen,” wrote an English judge to Henry VIII., “doth observe\r\n    and keep such laws and statutes which they make upon hills in\r\n    their country firm and stable, without breaking them for any\r\n    favour or reward.”\r\n\r\n    “As touching their government in their corporations where they\r\n    bear rule,” wrote an Englishman, Payne, from Connacht in 1589, “is\r\n    done with such wisdom, equity, and justice, as demerits worthy\r\n    commendations. For I myself divers times have seen in several\r\n    places within their jurisdictions well near twenty causes decided\r\n    at one sitting, with such indifference that, for the most part,\r\n    both plaintiff and defendant hath departed contented; yet many\r\n    that make show of peace and desireth to live by blood do utterly\r\n    mislike this or any good thing that the poor Irishman doth.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA poem of about 1100 A.D. describes how the people of Leinster, by their\r\ntribes and families, celebrated their fair of Carman—Carman reputed to\r\nhave come “from delightful Athens westward.” Every third year they held\r\nthe feast and two years for the preparation. The kings sat in order in\r\ntheir Forud (a word cognate with _Forum_), surrounded by their councillors\r\nand retinue. “Each one sits in his lawful place, so that all attend to\r\nthem to listen.” The women were seated in the same manner, “a noble, most\r\ndelightful host, women whose fame is not small abroad.” There was a week\r\nfor considering the laws and rights of the provinces for the next three\r\nyears. “There aloud with boldness they proclaimed the rights of every law\r\nand the restraints.” “Annals there are verified, every division into which\r\nErin was divided; the history of the household of Tara—not insignificant,\r\nthe knowledge of every territory in Erin, the history of the women of\r\nillustrious families, of courts, prohibitions, conquests.” The accurate\r\nsynchronisms of noble races, “the succession of the sovereign kings, their\r\nbattles and their stern valour,” “Fenian tales of Finn, an untiring\r\nentertainment,” proverbs, maxims, royal precepts, occult poetry,\r\ntopographical etymologies, the precepts of law-givers and sages—all came\r\nin their turn; and inscribed tablets, and books of trees, satires, and\r\nsharp-edged runes.\r\n\r\nWhile the memory of their origin, laws, and the title of every man to his\r\nland, was thus imprinted on the people’s minds, every other element of\r\ntheir civilization was displayed. Every day of the seven there was a show\r\nof the national sport of horse-racing. Commerce had its three markets—a\r\nmarket of food; a market of live stock, cows and horses; and the great\r\nmarket of “the foreign Greeks,” where gold and noble clothes were wont to\r\nbe, carried from the branching harbours that brought hosts into the noble\r\nfair. There were trumpets and music of all sorts, and poets, exerting\r\ntheir utmost power till each art had its rightful meed in proper measure\r\nfrom the king. Professors of every sort, both the noble arts and the base\r\narts, were there selling and exhibiting their competitions and their\r\nprofessional works to kings, and rewards were given for every art that was\r\njust or lawful to be sold or exhibited or listened to. The people might\r\nenjoy the rivalry of rustic buffoonery, pipes, fiddles, chainmen, bonemen,\r\nand tube players, a crowd of babbling painted masks—all in their due\r\nplace. Everything was provided for—the slope of the steeds, the slope of\r\nthe cooking, the slope of the embroidering women. And finally the day of\r\nsolemnity, masses, adorations, and psalm singing, and the fast of all of\r\nthem together; and so the assembly came to an end “without breach of law,\r\nwithout crime, without deed of violence, without dishonour.”\r\n\r\nThe king who presided over these assemblies was not a ruler in the\r\nTeutonic military sense. Ireland was free from two sources of military\r\nrule—the danger of conquest, and the fear of any attempt to force on the\r\npeople a new and alien law. Protected by distance and the ocean, the\r\nisland was long secured from foreign conquest: nor did the Irish need a\r\ncentral military power to enforce a native code which was already strong\r\nin the allegiance of the people. In this situation of comparative security\r\nthe natural aim of the Irish was to preserve their local freedom. They\r\nobjected, as the English after them have done, to military establishments\r\nand to compulsory service as systems which were a danger to liberty—and\r\n“liberty,” as the English officials complained, “was the only thing that\r\nScots and Irish constantly contended for.” Herdsmen and ploughmen who\r\ncarried on the business of the country refused to serve as soldiers for\r\nmore than a few weeks in the year, and that only after sowing and reaping\r\nwas done, and the cattle driven to pasture. Ireland was not in fact a\r\nmilitary country. The dangers to peace lay mainly in the Gaelic law of\r\nsuccession to kingship and chieftainship, according to which the best man\r\nof the ruling kindred was elected by the freemen. Such a system provided\r\nfrequent occasions of fighting—in rivalries of candidates and revolts of\r\nambitious aspirants to power, all too ready to look for outside support,\r\nno matter where, from a neighbouring chief, a Norman baron, or an English\r\ndeputy. From such variety of petty conflicts the feudal law of\r\nprimogeniture saved other countries to some extent, though, as we know,\r\nthat too was very far from insuring peace or harmony at all times.\r\n\r\nIreland no doubt suffered under this very conservative system of election,\r\ncome down from the honoured past. The evils, however, were not incurable\r\nin a country left to itself. An attempt was already made to lessen them by\r\nthe custom of electing along with the chief a Tanist or successor; and we\r\ncan trace in Ireland also the growing custom of inheritance from father to\r\nson. The way of natural development was closed, not by the incompetence of\r\nthe Irish, but by foreign enemies, who were careful to aggravate the\r\nmischief. It was the Danish wars and their results, and far more the wars\r\nof the English lord deputies, which made the very life of the tribe depend\r\non military leadership and on that alone. The danger of local strife among\r\nindependent states was in like manner exaggerated beyond measure when the\r\ndeputies adopted the ferocious policy of advancing the English conquest by\r\nisolating the territories, and forcing them, on one plea or another, into\r\ncivil war with their neighbours. Every territory had to maintain a retinue\r\nof soldiers out of all proportion to the normal state. Natural conditions\r\nwere overturned, and statesmen then as now crippled the communities they\r\ngoverned with preparations for war in the interests of peace.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the growth in authority of the high-king was frustrated by\r\nexternal violence. During the Danish invasions the position of the\r\nhigh-king was of great importance as leader and centre of the national\r\nresistance, and head of the general assemblies of the country “to bring\r\nconcord among the men of Ireland.” After these wars, when Ireland came\r\nmore directly under European influences, efforts were made there, as in\r\nother countries, to shape a “kingdom” in the modern sense of a centralised\r\nmonarchy. Such efforts after unity, which in Ireland, as in every other\r\nEuropean country, were in any case slow and difficult, found a determined\r\nenemy in England from the time of Ruaidhri O’Conor and Henry II. onwards.\r\nIn English interests, under the English “Lord of Ireland,” the island was\r\nto have no home-born king “coming to Tara,” as the mediæval phrase went,\r\nand not even a strong governor of any kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “A phantom government,” wrote Richey, “planted at Dublin fulfilled\r\n    none of the duties of a ruler, but by its presence prevented the\r\n    formation of any other authority or form of rule.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any leader appeared among the Irish of authority in peace or power in\r\nwar, the whole force of England was immediately called in to his\r\ndestruction, and to reestablish confusion and strife. “Ireland were as\r\ngood as lost,” the English said, “if a wild wyrlinge should be chosen\r\nthere as king.”\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that the Irish system had sprung from the soul of a\r\npeople with an intense national consciousness, that it bound the various\r\nclans under obedience to one common law, that it gave to all the\r\ninhabitants, rich and poor, learned and simple, an enthusiasm for their\r\nrace and country which rooted that law in their hearts, and endowed it\r\nwith a tenacity of life that no political misfortune could destroy.\r\n\r\nThe people were inspired by more than material considerations, and through\r\ncenturies of suffering nothing but death could extinguish their passionate\r\nloyalty to their chief and devotion to their race. English governors could\r\nnever catch the reason or meaning of that patriotism. “It should seem,”\r\nsaid Perrott, the ostentatious proclaimer of English superiority, “that\r\nthey think, when once they leave their old customs, ... they are out of\r\nall frame or good fashion, according to that saying, _They which are born\r\nin Hell think there is no Heaven_.”\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nEngland, however, according to the Unionist teaching, offered a better\r\nthing. She “invented” for Ireland a Parliament. What did the Irish make of\r\nthat? Here we enter on a new range of denunciations—the inadequacy to\r\nEnglish ideas and benevolences, not of Iberians and Celts, but of Normans\r\nand of English themselves.\r\n\r\nEvery form of Parliament, the best that England could do, ended in\r\nIreland, according to Mr. Balfour, in a “series of failures.” Ireland was\r\nalready well accustomed in every one of its territories to meetings of\r\nnotables and assemblies for public business; and there was no special\r\ndifficulty in introducing among a people of their training a\r\nrepresentative Parliament. But from this “British invention” the Celtic\r\npeople were in effect shut out, either formally or practically. The\r\nParliament was conferred on Normans, who had so distinguished a history in\r\nEngland, and on English Protestants. And yet, we are told, every\r\nexperiment of an “Irish” Parliament failed; under the same malign\r\ninfluences, it would seem, as were set forth by a lord deputy under Henry\r\nVIII.: “As I suppose, it is predestinate to this country to bring forth\r\nsedition, inventions, lies, and such other naughty fruits, and also that\r\nno man shall have thanks for services done here.”\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been the view of Mr. Litton Falkiner, who in his Essays\r\nhas drawn attention to the conspicuous faults of the Parliament as shown\r\nin the history of Poyning’s Act. That statute, according to him, reduced\r\nIreland to legislative impotence, but the Parliament willingly and with no\r\ndifficulty passed it; and not only was the bridle placed in the mouth of\r\nthe Irish legislature with its own assent, but it was so placed by its own\r\ndesire, and the Parliament long and strenuously resisted its removal. An\r\nexplanation, suitable to Ireland, for this singularly irrational conduct\r\nis given.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Not the least curious feature in the history of the subsequent\r\n    operation of Poyning’s Law is the great inconvenience which it\r\n    occasioned to the English Government, and its corresponding\r\n    popularity with the anti-English element in the Irish\r\n    legislature.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion would seem to be that the atmosphere of the island so\r\ncontaminated the Anglo-Norman settlers that they exchanged reason for\r\nfantastic inconsequence, and replaced self-interest by an insanity of\r\n“patriotism.” We have here a typical illustration of the way in which the\r\n“Irish” Parliament has been thrown under rebuke, and the spirit of its\r\ncondemnation. It is interesting to ask whether the facts bear out this\r\ntheory of unreason, and of a wilfulness inexplicable and characteristic of\r\nthis island alone.\r\n\r\nThere is a close parallel between the history of Poyning’s Act in 1494 and\r\nthat of the Union in 1800, so that the one may help us to understand the\r\nother. In the fifteenth century, as in the eighteenth, trade and wealth\r\nwere increasing fast in Ireland with commercial intercourse of the\r\npeoples, and barriers were breaking down between the two races. In both\r\nthese centuries alike the commercial jealousies of England were quickened\r\nby the growth of Irish trade, and its political fears by a question of the\r\nCrown—by Irish preference to the House of York over that of Lancaster\r\nunder Henry VI.—and under George III., by views held in Ireland as to the\r\nRegency. Alike with Poyning’s Act and with the Union the proposed remedy\r\nwas to bring Ireland under closer subjection to England. The statute\r\nordered that no Parliament should be held in Ireland till the Council had\r\ncertified to the King under the great seal of Ireland all the causes and\r\nconsiderations, and the Acts that should pass in it; and had received the\r\nKing’s license under the great seal of England, as well in affirmation of\r\nthese Acts as to summon Parliament. The means used for carrying this Act\r\nand the Act of Union were practically the same; the promise on each\r\noccasion was that the Act would ensure the order and liberties of Ireland;\r\nwhile for the unconvinced there remained threats, military demonstrations,\r\nand bribery—both subtle and extensive. Every place of authority in the\r\ncountry was newly packed with English officials, all servants of the\r\nLancastrian party in power. A Parliament was called from which all the\r\ngreat earls were absent—Ormond, Desmond, Kildare. This mere shadow of a\r\nParliament—strangers, place-hunters, and men, as we shall see, under\r\nsentence of ruin, without natural leaders, controlled by English\r\nofficials—was required to accept the King’s decree for “the whole and\r\nperfect obedience of the country.” In Poyning’s Law notice was given of\r\nthe King’s intention to make an Act for the general resumption of his\r\nwhole revenues since 1327, an Act never equalled by any measure before or\r\nsince for throwing all civil rights and liberties into the hands of the\r\nCrown. From pieces of parchment hanging to it with the autograph of Henry\r\nVII. written at the top, it appears that savings were made in favour of\r\nvarious persons exempting them from the operation of this Act. Thus\r\naccording to their conduct or deserts at the passing of Poyning’s Law, men\r\nwould find ruin or protection at the King’s hand. Alike in their ignoble\r\nbeginnings, Poyning’s Law and the Act of Union remained in their later\r\ndevelopments the source of dissension and the great battle-ground between\r\nEnglish rulers and Irish subjects.\r\n\r\nSo much for the passing of the Act with “no difficulty.” How it was\r\nintended to work by Henry VII. we cannot tell, but the violent methods of\r\nlater Tudor sovereigns respected no barriers. Whenever Poyning’s Act stood\r\nin their way, the first remedy was an Act for its “repeal”—that is, an\r\n“exposition” how it was to be understood, or an enactment that all\r\nstatutes of that Parliament were valid, “notwithstanding Poyning’s Act.”\r\nNo Tudor ever proposed to “repeal” that part of the statute which limited\r\nthe freedom of Parliament: but only to abrogate the formalities which\r\ninterfered with his own direct method of government. The Dublin\r\nParliament, for its part, clearly saw that if the Act gave a tremendous\r\npower to the Crown, it yet held provisions which were a protection, so far\r\nas they went, from arbitrary tyranny. The preparing, before a Parliament\r\ncould be called, of Acts to which the Seal of Ireland had to be affixed\r\nbefore they went to receive the Seal of England, assured some discussion\r\nin Ireland, some degree of publicity, and some hindrance to unexpected\r\nlaws sprung upon it by a foreign and uncontrolled Executive, and rushed\r\nthrough by a packed majority. Parliament, in fact, held that law and\r\nrecognised order were safeguards to liberty; and its battle in Dublin was\r\nfor the security of law, even of Poyning’s Law, against the mere will of\r\nthe King and his ministers: a motive neither trivial nor irrational.\r\n\r\nThe first conflict arose with the Parliament of 1536-7, which was called\r\nto establish what we may call the Protestant succession, to declare Henry\r\nhead of the Church, to order the suppression of abbeys, and to decree vast\r\nconfiscations in Leinster to the King’s benefit (in many cases estates of\r\nmembers of the Parliament), with the purpose of new “Plantation.” It was\r\nnot likely that such laws would be peaceably drawn up in Dublin and\r\noffered to Henry in the form he preferred. On the first day of its\r\nsession, May 1st, 1536, therefore, the “repeal of Poyning’s Act” was\r\nordered—that is, to declare it void for that Parliament. The experiment\r\nwas new and untried, and the Houses obeyed. By the “repeal” Henry and\r\nCromwell were set free from every restriction. They could send over new\r\nand unforeseen bills, neither known nor discussed in Ireland, without\r\nagreement with the Irish Council, at any time before or after Parliament\r\nopened, and could alter bills during the session as they chose. Every\r\nshred of protection to the framing of bills in Ireland, or their\r\ndiscussion there, disappeared. The usurped powers were used to the\r\nuttermost. In seventeen days ten Acts had passed the Commons. Cromwell\r\nwrote to delay the Act for the Succession if it was still in an incomplete\r\nstage, probably for some changes. The King wrote to desire an astounding\r\nAct to confer on himself all the land in Ireland. But resistance had\r\nalready begun. Parliament had attempted to protect the country by\r\nproviding in their Repealing Act that a number of matters should be\r\nexcluded from its operation, such as the liberties of boroughs, etc., and\r\nthat no laws should be enacted by this Parliament but such as were for the\r\nhonour of the King, the increase of his revenue, _and_ the commonweal of\r\nthe land. As Acts poured over from England members pleaded that they were\r\ncontrary to these conditions, and prepared to carry the matter to a court\r\nof law. The struggle lasted eighteen months. Parliament was adjourned,\r\ncontrary to law, six times in the next year. Finally Commissioners were\r\nsent over in September, 1537, carrying with them a series of Acts drawn up\r\nin England, and added others of their own devising; all to be passed\r\n“notwithstanding Poyning’s Act.” The limitations which Parliament had\r\nattempted to set up in their “Repealing” Act were set aside by a new\r\n“repeal,” which declared the “mere truth” of the first to be that every\r\nBill was valid which concerned _either_ the King’s honour, _or_ the\r\nincrease of his revenue, _or_ the common weal of the land: and that anyone\r\nwho brought the question to a suit in any court of law should suffer as a\r\nfelon.\r\n\r\nIn this first battle, Parliament, taken by surprise, was defeated. Every\r\nattempted safeguard was thrown down, and nothing left but the royal\r\ntyranny. “The King’s causes in Parliament take good effect,” wrote the\r\nCommissioners; and twenty-four Acts were passed. Having finished their\r\nwork, and having discovered in searching among old Acts that this\r\nParliament was illegally held, they hastily dissolved it, making provision\r\nto hide its unlawful character.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of 1541 which gave to Henry the title of king was the only\r\none of the century in which we find no proposition to repeal Poyning’s\r\nAct. Other means had been used during four years of widespread and\r\ndeceitful negotiations (1537-1541) to ensure the King’s success. A series\r\nof false promises as to rights in land had been cunningly dispatched\r\nthrough the country. There was a careful scrutiny of the coming\r\nParliament. Lists were drawn up for Henry’s benefit. The House of Lords\r\nwas safe. The vast majority of prelates in it were docile nominees of the\r\nnew head of the Church. Of the score of peers on the list six were\r\nreported to Henry as having “neither wit nor company of men”; one was wise\r\nin counsel but without any soldiers; and nine were new creations, at the\r\nKing’s bidding—six of them scarcely a month old, some indeed still waiting\r\nfor their letters patent. In the Common House were divers knights and many\r\ngentlemen of fair possessions, but no list of these is given. The House\r\nhad evidently been packed: for an Act was passed repealing the old statute\r\nagainst non-residents and proroguing of Parliaments. There was indeed a\r\nconcession to placate opponents. “From henceforth” the knights and\r\nburgesses were to be resident, under penalty of fines—a provision well\r\ncalculated to disappoint the hopes it raised. Under these circumstances\r\nthe repeal of Poyning’s Act was for once dispensed with. Having secured\r\nhis title of King, Henry could fling away his Parliament, and no assembly\r\nmet again for thirteen years.\r\n\r\nQueen Mary called her one Parliament in 1556 to carry two Acts which\r\nsurpassed in terror and ferocity any yet proposed. The Act for the\r\nconfiscation and plantation of Leinster lands, ordered Leix and Offaly to\r\nbe turned into the King’s and Queen’s counties, the first shires made\r\nsince the time of John; and desired they should be “planted” with “good\r\nmen.” A second Act gave power to Commissioners to perambulate the whole\r\nrealm and divide it into shires as they thought convenient, without\r\nfurther reference to Parliament. Henceforth any Irish chief or Norman lord\r\nmight learn suddenly that by a mere decree of the Deputy his authority was\r\nabolished, his territory dissolved into a chaotic mass of helpless people,\r\nunder officers speaking a foreign tongue, and laws wholly unknown to them,\r\nthe land leased out according to English tenure, new taxes imposed, and a\r\nCommissioner with his hangmen placed in their midst to govern “in a course\r\nof discretion.”\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament met, two drafts of the Act for “the well-disposing” of\r\nLeinster lands were “lost.” The loss or embezzlement was perhaps contrived\r\nwith the hope of resisting any third Act that might arrive after the\r\nsession had opened, as contrary to Poyning’s Law. If so, the hope was\r\nvain. An Act was prepared to explain “how Poyning’s Act was to be exponed\r\nand taken,” and to enact that since events might happen, (as for example\r\nthe loss of unwelcome drafts) during the time of Parliament necessary to\r\nbe provided for, which at the time of the summoning of Parliament were not\r\nthought or agreed upon, therefore the Irish Government might send over\r\nconsiderations and causes for new ordinances, and that these being\r\nreturned under the Great Seal of England might be enacted, notwithstanding\r\nPoyning’s Act. A third draft was sent over, and the Act of Confiscation\r\npassed—the first of the Great Plantations.\r\n\r\nThat sinister measure, “An exposition of Poyning’s Act,” was again\r\nprepared for Elizabeth’s Parliament of 1560, which was called to declare\r\nthe Queen’s Title and her Supremacy over the Church. But the Houses\r\ndisappeared before it was brought in:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Lord-Deputy is said to have used force, and the speaker\r\n    treachery.... I heard,” said Dr. Lynch, “that it had been\r\n    previously announced in the House that Parliament would not sit on\r\n    that very day on which the laws against religion were enacted;\r\n    but, in the meantime, a private summons was sent to those who were\r\n    well known to be favourable to the new creed ... the few members\r\n    present assented, and the speaker won for himself the name of\r\n    being the chief author of the laws enacted against the Catholic\r\n    religion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Sussex sought to calm the rage of the Parliament by pledging\r\nhimself solemnly that the Statute of Uniformity should not be enforced\r\nduring Elizabeth’s reign. So violent was the opposition of lords and\r\nchieftains to “the laws against religion,” that Sussex, it was said,\r\nprorogued Parliament and went to England to consult the Queen. Thus it\r\nended after nineteen days.\r\n\r\nAfter this experience:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We have small disposition to assent to any Parliament,” wrote\r\n    Elizabeth to the Deputy in 1566. “Nevertheless, when we call to\r\n    remembrance the ancient manner of that our Realm, that no manner\r\n    of thing there ought to be commented or treated upon, but such as\r\n    we shall first understand from you, and consent thereunto ourself,\r\n    and consequently return the same under our great seal of this our\r\n    Realm of England; we are the better minded to assent to this your\r\n    request.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legal correctness of this regard for Poyning’s Act disappeared in the\r\ncourse of three years’ preparation for the new assembly. The Parliament\r\nmet in 1569 to find the Commons packed with strangers, contrary to the\r\nrenewed law which had been won from Henry VIII. in 1542 against the\r\npractice. The gentry of the Pale and the Dublin burgesses protested in\r\nvain against the return of strangers for boroughs which they had never\r\neven seen: “the more words the more choler.” Elizabeth’s vast schemes of\r\nconfiscation and breaking up of the old Irish society were met with\r\nhostility. Under pressure of the Deputy, therefore, a second session was\r\nheld to pass a single bill, the “Repeal of Poyning’s Act”; on the plea\r\nthat grievous sores known to the high court in Ireland could not be\r\nreformed as not having been certified to the Queen. This bill was bitterly\r\nopposed: “so jealous were they that they would not in long time enter into\r\nthe consideration thereof.” The remonstrants did in fact force some\r\nconcessions; that provisions made by the present Parliament for the common\r\nweal, the augmentation of the Queen’s revenues, and the assurance to her\r\nof lands and profits, which were certified under the Great Seal of\r\nIreland, and returned to Ireland under the Great Seal of England, should\r\nfirst be publicly proclaimed in six cities, and only after these\r\nproclamations should pass into law, “Poyning’s Act notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nThe way was now clear, and the next session brought the attainder of Shane\r\nO’Neill and the tremendous confiscation of Tyrone and other lands in\r\nUlster. A beginning was made of Munster confiscations. The Deputy was to\r\nappoint English-speaking clergy to all ecclesiastical dignities in\r\nMunster. Other Acts ordered all Ireland to be reduced to shire land; and\r\nabolished all Irish and Anglo-Norman chieftaincies or “captainships”\r\nexcept by special patent (thus depriving the chiefs of the benefit of\r\ntheir indentures), under penalty of death without benefit of clergy, as\r\nthe law was drafted in England; the Parliament substituted a fine and\r\npassed the decree with great opposition, for “the matter misliked them\r\nmore than the pain.” The Queen herself sent letters ordering Parliament to\r\npass a heavy impost which must ruin the Irish wine trade, in which matter\r\n“they showed themselves so unquiet that they were more like a bear-baiting\r\nof disordered persons than a Parliament of wise and grave men.” Taught by\r\nexperience, the Parliament now insisted on a law to limit the repeal of\r\nPoyning’s Act, in which they explained their reasons for objecting to any\r\nrepeal at any time. Before that Act, they said, when liberty was given to\r\nthe governors to call Parliament at their pleasure, “Acts passed as well\r\nto the dishonour of the Prince, as to the hindrance of their subjects, the\r\nremembrance whereof would indeed have stayed us from condescending to the\r\nrepeal of the said statute,” save for their persuasion that Sydney through\r\nhis motion meant only the honour of the Queen _and_ the common benefit of\r\nthe Realm (going back in these words to the first repeal of 1536); but\r\nthey feared that the like liberty might be abused by other governors, and\r\ntherefore enacted that none other should ever use the liberty of Sydney,\r\nand that no Bill should ever be certified into England for repealing or\r\nsuspending of Poynings’ Act unless it was first agreed on in a Session of\r\nParliament in Ireland, by the greater number of the Lords and the greater\r\nnumber of the Common House, that is by both Houses carrying the Bill by a\r\nseparate vote.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of 1569, distinguished by a high order of public spirit and\r\nlegal ability, was driven to its fatal close in a general war against\r\nthose “that banish Ireland and mean conquest,” a striking phrase of\r\nAnglo-Irish patriots.\r\n\r\nA new “Repeal of Poynings’ Act” was demanded of the Parliament in 1585.\r\nThe reason was again the same—for the more convenient passing of Acts to\r\ndeprive the people of Ireland of their land and their religion; Elizabeth\r\nmainly anxious about her property in land, and the deputy about religious\r\nuniformity. There was a Bill to extend to Ireland all the English laws\r\nagainst Popish recusants, and demand the Oath of Supremacy as a test of\r\nthe fidelity of Parliament: an Act for the attainder of Baltinglas;\r\nanother for the attainder of Desmond, and a hundred and sixty more\r\n“traitors,” and for the confiscation of Munster; one to limit the\r\nlandowners’ old-established rights of conveyancing of land as “likely to\r\ntend to disinherit the Queen’s Majesty.” Such Acts could never be passed\r\nunder the formalities of Poynings’ Law.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy, however, had to reckon with two new problems. Representatives\r\nof the Irish race sat in the Parliament, Hugh O’Neill in the Lords, some\r\nfourteen Irishmen in the Commons. And the effect of the enactment made by\r\nthe last Parliament was now seen in its enactment that “repeal” henceforth\r\nmust be carried by a majority in each of the two Houses, voting\r\nseparately. By fraudulently counting an absent vote Perrott declared the\r\nBill carried by one in the Lords: the Commons threw it out by thirty-five.\r\nHe prorogued Parliament for three days, and when it met again brought in\r\nthe Bill; again the Ireland Party in the Commons defeated the Englishmen\r\nwho supported the Government; and thus overthrew, in Perrott’s words, “the\r\nrepeal of Poynings’ Act that should have set them at liberty to treat of\r\nthat and all other things necessary for the State.” The opponents of\r\nsuspension, he said, desired only to make void the whole Parliament\r\nbecause they could abide no reformation in matters of religion or State;\r\nand would bring the new chiefs, O’Reillys, Maguires, and the rest, into\r\njealousy of the Parliament. The landowners and gentry, “the stirrers of\r\nParliament and the lawyers,” on their side declared they feared to give\r\ndespotic power to the Viceroy and distrusted his purpose, “some of the\r\nIrishmen either mistaking or conceiving it was framed to another intent\r\nthan it did pretend, whereby they drew on them the Deputy’s disfavour, and\r\ndispleasure on him from the Queen.”\r\n\r\nThe defeat of “repeal” showed the Houses their strength. The Lords dashed\r\nnew Acts proposed against treason and the trial of accessories—statutes\r\nnamely, said Perrott, for the safety of the Queen. The Commons wrecked the\r\nBill for Desmond’s attainder, striking out eight score names of “men of\r\nliving” and leaving only eight. They refused, moreover, to escheat lands\r\nprotected by law, and to tax land in a manner tyrannous and contrary to\r\nIrish custom. The “disturbers of Parliament” were met by five adjournments\r\nin eleven months; but the devices by which these sticklers for the law\r\nwere finally subdued is too long to tell here. Parliament met at last in\r\nApril, 1586, to register the royal will. The Lords read and passed the\r\nfour Acts for the attainder of rebels in Munster. The Commons still\r\nresisted for a week. The official intrigue to compel their submission is\r\nconfused by the bitter wrangle of the Deputy and the Treasurer for the\r\nhonour of the plot. Finally the Desmond confiscations were “wrought out”\r\nof the Parliament with so great difficulty, said Spenser, “that were it to\r\nbe passed again I dare undertake it would never be compassed”; and the\r\nDeputy gave the royal assent to the Bill by which over half a million\r\nacres of Desmond land were forfeited by Act of Parliament to the Crown, as\r\nthe O’Neill land had been forfeited nearly twenty years before. After\r\nwhich Parliament was dissolved, with an oration of Justice Walshe, the\r\nSpeaker, who, in “the universal comfort of all estates,” asked the Commons\r\n“what is there more of earthly felicity that can be required,” reminded\r\nthem that the escheated lands “accepted by the Queen of us” were of far\r\nless value than the smallest portion of Her Majesty’s charges for their\r\nbenefit, and mentioned how they had “willingly consented to attaint and\r\nstain in blood Her Majesty’s disloyal subjects and unbar the succession of\r\ntheir traitorous lines, to the end that the memory of their names may be\r\nquite extinguished.”\r\n\r\nThus after a hundred years the Parliament won its first success in\r\nrefusing the repeal of Poyning’s Act. Mr. Litton Falkiner calls us to\r\nwonder at the “curious circumstance” that “successive Parliaments of the\r\nsixteenth century declined on patriotic grounds to abrogate the very\r\nstatute the repeal of which was to become the greatest triumph of Irish\r\npatriotism in the eighteenth century,” and insinuates that we may here see\r\ndisplayed the captious and capricious spirit that infects the\r\n“predestinate” peoples of Ireland. Out of the old habit of contempt it has\r\nbeing boldly suggested by some that the independence of Parliament, by\r\nothers that the Catholic religion, were in no way valued by Irishmen until\r\nthey made the discovery that these could be used to annoy and disconcert\r\nEngland. Such unworthy suspicions must disappear as we watch the grave\r\nconflict of men threatened with ruin, imprisonment, death, in their\r\nstruggle to defend the first rights of law, property, and religion.\r\n\r\nIt was a slow battle, with rare and scanty triumphs for defenders of the\r\nconstitution. Long silence followed the first victory of the Parliament in\r\nrefusing the repeal of Poyning’s Act: it was not summoned again for\r\ntwenty-six years. Its next meeting was amid dark threatenings. The old\r\nsessions in Dublin had been honourably held in “the house called Christ’s\r\nChurch situate in the high place of the same, like as St. Paul’s in\r\nLondon”; Parliament was now ordered to hold its debates in the Castle,\r\nsurrounded by extra troops brought to overawe an assembly which was robbed\r\nof even the appearance of free deliberations. When they objected to being\r\nplaced over the Castle stores of powder (in a room which had been, in\r\nfact, lately wrecked by an accidental explosion of gunpowder) and made a\r\nreference to Guy Fawkes, their objections were set aside with a scornful\r\ntaunt “of what religion they were that had hatched such cockatrice’s\r\neggs.” From that time began a new and even more ominous story than before.\r\n\r\nA fatal doom in fact hung over the two Houses in Dublin. The Irish\r\nParliament, which at this time had no relation whatever with the English\r\nParliament, depended directly and solely on the King. The royal policy of\r\nTudors and Stuarts, in their different ways, was to fortify their personal\r\nauthority over Ireland and its Parliament, and by this means to strengthen\r\nthe despotic and military power of the Crown; and make Ireland, without or\r\nagainst its will, a peril to the liberties of England. The natural result\r\nwas to bring the Irish Parliament under the angry suspicion of the English\r\nParliament and people, and create a forced and disastrous hostility. Not\r\nonly was the constitutional party in Ireland cut off from the natural\r\nsupport of their brethren who were fighting the battle of liberty in\r\nEngland, and separated from its due share in the general struggle for\r\nliberty; but the royal policy finally drove the English Parliament to\r\ndetermine that all independent action of the Irish Parliament should be\r\nentirely suppressed, and thus brought about a constitutional revolution\r\nwhich for the first time subjected the Irish Parliament to the absolute\r\ncontrol, not of the King, but of the English Parliament itself. From this\r\ntime, it is evident, Poynings’ Act and its repeal took a new significance.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament which “England gave to Ireland,” that gift “of British\r\nextraction,” was, as we know, very far indeed from the Parliament which\r\nthe English won for themselves. The English Parliament had behind it in\r\neffect the people of England. The Irish Parliament was by the Castle\r\npolicy separated from the people of Ireland, who were utterly excluded, or\r\nif cautiously admitted were selected in small and discreet numbers from\r\namong those who had cut themselves off from their own people and pledged\r\nthemselves to the Government. It was sedulously weakened within by\r\nperpetual infusion among its high officials, its peers, its prelates, and\r\nits members from boroughs and shires, of strangers born across the sea—men\r\nwhose special mission was to “banish Ireland” and reduce all to\r\nsubservience to the interests of another country. Its Statutes were\r\ntreated with negligent contempt: “The same Statutes, for lack they be not\r\nin print, be unknown to the most part of your subjects here ... these of\r\nthe Irishrie which newly have submitted themselves be in great doubt of\r\nsuch uncertain and unknown laws,” the Deputy reported. In 1569 it was\r\nproposed, apparently without any reference to Parliament, to print such of\r\nthe Statutes “_as it was desirable for our subjects to take note of_”; in\r\n1571 Recorder Stanihurst carried to London the roll of 170 statutes which\r\nwere _thought meet_ to be printed by the new English settler, Carew,\r\n(perhaps the most hated of all by the Parliament itself) and a few\r\nofficials—a selection which was in London again corrected by Burghley, and\r\nthe printing still delayed.\r\n\r\nThat a Parliament hampered, mutilated, restricted, demoralised, should\r\nhave made such a stand for the country’s interests, testifies to the\r\nvigour of constitutional and national life in Ireland. Society indeed is\r\nso closely bound together in any country that the most imperfect and\r\nexclusive body of its inhabitants must feel to some degree the needs and\r\naspirations of the whole. Mr. A. M. Sullivan, in the last Home Rule\r\ncontroversy, rightly argued that it was not what the Parliament was that\r\nchiefly mattered, but where it was: “Anything will do, if it is only in\r\nIreland,” he said, “the Protestant Synod would do.” The same need for some\r\nrepresentative life of a people in their own land was felt by the Great\r\nEarl of Kildare over four hundred years ago. “You hear of our case as in a\r\ndream,” he cried to the London councillors, “and feel not the smart that\r\nvexeth us.”\r\n\r\nThe close of the old Irish polity, the fate of the Irish Parliaments, have\r\na deeper lesson to teach than the supposed faults of the Irish temper,\r\nIberian, Celtic, or Norman. The story of the old Gaelic State, and of the\r\nlater Anglo-Irish Commonwealth, both alike reveal a power of patriotism, a\r\npassion of human aspiration, which cannot find its final satisfaction in\r\nmaterial gifts; and which is ill understood by those who deny to Ireland\r\nfair fame, dignity, and a lofty patriotism, and offer in their place\r\noblivion, with a promise for the future of Tariff Reform and its financial\r\nconsequences. The series of failures that have through seven centuries\r\nfollowed the English dealing with Ireland have their inexorable lesson:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “That nothing has a natural right to last\r\n    But equity and reason; that all else\r\n    Meets foes irreconcilable, and at best\r\n    Lives only by variety of disease.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.—Ireland As A Dependency. BY PROFESSOR A. F. POLLARD\r\n\r\n\r\n“The ocean,” said Grattan, with reference to the connexion between Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, “protests against separation, and the sea against\r\nunion.” The protests of natural forces cannot be ignored, and the history\r\nof the relations between the two islands is filled with the efforts of\r\nstatesmen to find a middle way between the horns of this dilemma, and to\r\nadjust the estranging drift of the Irish Channel, the Irish climate, and\r\nracial divergence to the bonds of common interest imposed by the Atlantic\r\nOcean and foreign competition upon the British Isles. After a brief\r\neighteen years of uneasy legislative independence, the pendulum swung to\r\nthe other extreme, and the Act of Union inaugurated a century of restless\r\nincorporation; but, for five out of the six and a half centuries of\r\nEnglish parliamentary history, Ireland had a subordinate Parliament. Union\r\nhas been the exception, not the rule, in the relations of the kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe mere existence of an Irish Parliament was not, therefore, fatal to\r\nEngland’s security or to the growth of its Empire. A Parliament sat at\r\nDublin while England won the battles of Crecy and Agincourt, of Blenheim\r\nand the Nile, defied the menace of Rome, defeated the Spanish Armada, and\r\nlaid the foundations of British dominion in India, in Canada, in the West\r\nIndies, and in South Africa. Spaniards, it is true, landed at Smerwick in\r\n1579 and at Kinsale in 1601, and French troops landed at Carrickfergus in\r\n1760 and at Kilala in 1798; but Spaniards also landed at Penzance in 1593,\r\nand Frenchmen landed on English soil countless times from the days of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror to their descent at Fishguard in 1796. England has\r\never been saved by its navy and not by its parliamentary unions, and the\r\nattraction to foreign invaders has not been an Irish Parliament, but the\r\nexistence of Irish discontent. No invasion of Ireland, in spite of the\r\nIrish Parliament, came so near to success as did the Jacobite risings\r\nafter the Scottish Union.\r\n\r\nThe recapitulation of these facts is, perhaps, otiose, except to allay\r\nfears which sane politicians do not entertain; and it is more to the point\r\nto show that the causes of Irish dissatisfaction are historical, and are\r\nidentical with those which, under similar conditions, produced a similar\r\ndiscontent in England. The notion that the Irish are naturally turbulent\r\nand disloyal, while the English are by nature the reverse, is one which\r\ncould only have grown up after England had rid itself of those irritants\r\nwhich cause the Irish friction. Between the Norman Conquest and the\r\nRevolution of 1688 England rebelled against more than half its sovereigns:\r\nsome were imprisoned, some were expelled, some were assassinated, and some\r\nwere done to death in more decorous fashion; and English treason and\r\nturbulence were once quite as much bywords in Europe as ever Irish\r\ndisloyalty was in England. The conventional English pictures of Irish\r\ndisorder could easily be capped as late as the seventeenth century by\r\nFrench descriptions of English lawlessness and barbarity. A French\r\nguide-book, published in 1654, declared that England was inhabited by\r\ndemons and parricides, and a few years later another Frenchman averred\r\nthat the English were a cruel and ferocious race of wolves. The truth of\r\nthe matter is that English and Irish alike prefer to manage their own\r\naffairs in accord with their own ideas, and are only contented and loyal\r\nwhen this condition obtains. The Revolution of 1688 placed its realisation\r\nwithin the reach of the English people, and there has been no English\r\nrebellion since. But the sovereign remedy for disaffection was refused the\r\nIrish and the American colonists: the latter rebelled, and, being distant,\r\nachieved their independence. The Canadians followed suit in 1837, but\r\nfound peace and prosperity under a parliament of their own. South Africa\r\nwas converted to the cause of empire by the same expedient; only the\r\nIrish, who are most at England’s mercy, have been condemned to nurse their\r\ngrievance and denied the conditions of loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe remedy does not apply, we are told, to Irish disorders, firstly\r\nbecause parliamentary institutions are an exotic(122) unsuited to the\r\nIrish soil and temperament, and secondly because they have been weighed in\r\nIrish balances and found wanting. It is hard to see why they should be\r\nregarded as more exotic in Irish Dublin than in French Quebec: Sir Wilfrid\r\nLaurier cannot be termed a failure as a parliamentarian; British parties\r\nat Westminster have been inconvenienced by the parliamentary skill rather\r\nthan by the parliamentary incompetence of Irish members; and the present\r\nmenace to parliamentary institutions does not come from Ireland. Nor,\r\nindeed, is the argument one which we can employ with any consistency, for\r\nthere is hardly a word in our legal and constitutional terminology that is\r\nnot of foreign origin. Parliament itself is not of Anglo-Saxon derivation,\r\nand nearly all the things we cherish most have been imported from\r\nabroad—our racehorses and our religion, our alphabet and our algebra, our\r\ntrial by jury and our vote by ballot. Pure-bred civilisations have been\r\nrare, inelastic, and unprogressive, and the test of a nation’s political\r\ncapacity lies not in its rigid adherence to its original stock-in-trade,\r\nbut in its powers of assimilation and adaptability to its environment. It\r\nis no reproach to us that we have dethroned indigenous deities, nor to the\r\nIrish that they have appropriated our Parliamentary weapons; for it is a\r\npoor country which cannot borrow its neighbours’ wisdom and profit by\r\ntheir experience.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune for Ireland was that in the earlier stages of its\r\ndevelopment it borrowed so little, and retained so much of its primitive\r\ntribal decentralisation. England would have been no less unfortunate had\r\nWilliam the Conqueror only succeeded in establishing a Norman Pale on this\r\nside of the English Channel, and had England retained its connexion with\r\nNormandy. As it was, the Normans and Angevins cured us of our primitive\r\ntribalism, and then left England to work out its own salvation. The\r\nseverance of Normandy from England converted the descendants of William’s\r\ncompanions from a Norman garrison into an English aristocracy, while the\r\nsuccessors of Strongbow’s followers were maintained by the English\r\nconnexion as an alien garrison quartered in the barracks of a dwindling\r\nIrish Pale. At first, indeed, they had spread a thin veneer of\r\nAnglo-Norman conquest over the greater part of Ireland; but baronial feuds\r\nonly added to the distraction of native septs; and when Edward I.’s\r\npremature imperialism provoked a general Celtic reaction under Robert\r\nBruce in Scotland and Edward Bruce in Ireland, Anglo-Norman rule was\r\ndoomed. The conquerors either threw in their lot with the natives and\r\nbecame more Irish than the Irish, or withdrew within the Pale and\r\nmaintained a troubled existence by sowing division throughout the rest of\r\nthe realm. Hence the Irish were always the enemies, seldom the subjects of\r\nthe English Crown; and outside the Pale there was no English government of\r\nIreland during the middle ages. Constitutional relations only existed\r\nbetween England and the Pale; relations with Ireland outside the Pale were\r\nin that state of nature, in which, says Hobbes, the life of man is “nasty,\r\nshort, brutish, and mean.” The Government had not the means to govern; it\r\nfelt and it acknowledged no obligations of duty or humanity towards its\r\nfoes outside the Pale.\r\n\r\nThis Pale, about twenty miles broad and sixty miles long, was almost as\r\nnarrow and quite as lawless as the Welsh Marches or the Scottish Borders;\r\nand it was the nursery of the English-seedling-parliament in Ireland. A\r\nsort of parliament containing knights from a dozen shires had been\r\nsummoned in 1295; boroughs appear to have been represented first in 1310.\r\nIt was only designed to supply the financial needs of an English\r\nGovernment, and give statutory form to the edicts of Dublin Castle; and\r\nthe statutes of Kilkenny (1367), which penalised everything Irish, were\r\nmerely striking examples of the ferocity and the futility of its customary\r\nlegislation. Nevertheless, it began to strike feeble roots in Irish soil,\r\nand when, in 1374, Edward III.’s deputy directed the clergy and laity of\r\nthe Pale to send their representatives to Westminster, their constituents,\r\nwhile obeying, instructed them to reject all financial demands upon\r\nIreland made at St. Stephen’s. Demands made at Dublin were not, however,\r\nmuch more fruitful, and for thirty years in the fifteenth century only one\r\nIrish Parliament met. Spasmodic efforts by sovereigns and royal princes\r\nlike Richard II., Lionel and Thomas (Dukes of Clarence), and Richard (Duke\r\nof York,) alternated with longer periods, during which the Crown abandoned\r\nthe government to the greatest chieftain in the Pale, and made believe\r\nthat the power he wielded was due to his royal commission. Richard of\r\nYork, indeed, established a reputation for vigorous rule which won him the\r\nsupport of the Parliament of the Pale in his assertion of an independent\r\nkingship in Ireland after his defeat in England in 1459; and the\r\nAnglo-Irish, either out of gratitude to him or of spite to the Tudors,\r\nafterwards discovered Yorkist features in every pretender to Henry VII.’s\r\nthrone. Their favour to Lambert Simnel and Perkin Warbeck precipitated\r\nPoynings’ laws.\r\n\r\nThese famous enactments were aimed at Dublin Castle rather than at the\r\nDublin parliament. The Crown had always controlled Irish legislation, but\r\nthe control had been exercised through a deputy, who was often more\r\npowerful in Ireland than the Crown; this independence was to cease, and\r\nthe control of Irish legislation was transferred from the Irish deputy to\r\nthe English Privy Council. No Parliament was to be summoned in the Pale\r\nwithout the consent, and no legislation introduced without the approval,\r\nof that body. Acts previously passed by the English Parliament were\r\ndeclared in force in Ireland, and in practice the English Parliament\r\nproceeded to legislate for, though not to tax, Ireland without the\r\nconcurrence of its Parliament. Poynings also attempted to conquer the\r\nnative Irish, and to rule the Pale according to English ways; but the\r\nexpense proved greater than Henry VII. could bear, and, with the bit of\r\nPoynings’ laws in his mouth, the Earl of Kildare was sent back to govern\r\nthe Pale in the time-honoured fashion.\r\n\r\nIreland was one of the questions upon which Wolsey and Henry VIII.\r\ndisagreed. The Cardinal’s policy was to neglect Ireland and save expenses\r\nin that direction in order to act as the paymaster and to pose as the\r\narbiter of Europe, with the result that on the eve of his fall, England’s\r\nhold on Ireland was said to be weaker than it had been since the conquest.\r\nWhen Wolsey was gone, Henry’s imperialism found vent in Ireland as well as\r\nin other spheres, and it was stimulated by the appearance as early as 1528\r\nof Spanish emissaries at the courts of Irish chiefs. But the brutal hatred\r\nwhich later conflicts engendered did not inspire the Irish efforts of\r\nHenry VIII. His warfare in Ireland was less ferocious than that which he\r\nwaged on Scotland, or on the monks of England. If he confiscated the lands\r\nof Irish monasteries, he shared the spoils with Irish chiefs, and he also\r\nconfiscated the lands of habitual absentees; and if he proscribed the Earl\r\nof Kildare, he gave earldoms to O’Neill, O’Brien, and MacWilliam. Whatever\r\nplans for the expropriation of the Irish clans were propounded to his\r\nears, his own policy was not expropriation, but the conversion of Irish\r\nchiefs into Irish peers holding their lands of him as their king; and by\r\nthe common testimony of English and Irish alike, the land enjoyed greater\r\npeace and prosperity at the end of his reign than it had within living\r\nmemory. The destruction of papal jurisdiction was no grievance to the\r\nIrish, for pope after pope had prohibited their preferment and restricted\r\nIrish sees to men of English race. Even Edward VI.’s Acts of Uniformity,\r\nwhich were applied to Ireland without the authorisation of its Parliament,\r\nevoked no Irish rebellion; and so mild was religious conflict that there\r\nwas no Irish martyr under Protestant Edward VI. or under Catholic Mary.\r\n\r\nThe permanent schism between the two races was, indeed, due neither to\r\npolitics nor to religion, but to the expropriation of the Irish from their\r\nland. At the middle of the sixteenth century the antagonism between\r\nEnglish and Irish was slighter than that between English and Scots, or\r\nthat between Britons and Boers in 1900. Men can heal the wounds of the\r\nconquered, but those of the disinherited fester for ever, unless the race\r\ndies out or restitution is made. The Irish are the only white race that\r\nthe English have evicted in modern times. They ate up the land piecemeal\r\nbecause there was no Irish State to be subdued by political conquest;\r\nbecause their arts of division, which failed against Scottish national\r\nfeeling, succeeded against Irish septs; because the English conquest of\r\nIreland was, in fact, a barbarian conquest achieved by a more or less\r\ncivilised race centuries after the normal age of white barbarian conquests\r\nhad closed. No conquered States pay ransom with the wholesale confiscation\r\nof the lands of private individuals; that is a price which is only exacted\r\nfrom the disorganised and the defenceless.\r\n\r\nThis process began with an Act of Philip and Mary, supported by the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, which was still the Church of the English rulers rather\r\nthan that of the Irish people; and the Lord-Deputy Sussex was required to\r\npermit the Primate to “exercise and use all manner of ecclesiastical\r\ncensures against the disordered Irishry.” Leix and Offaly, where the\r\nO’Conors and O’Mores had rebelled under Edward VI., were confiscated to\r\nthe Crown and converted into King’s and Queen’s Counties. They were to be\r\nplanted partly with English settlers and partly with such Irish as would\r\nabjure their native language, laws, and customs. But it took more than\r\nhalf a century to carry out the plantation, and eighteen rebellions broke\r\nout before the natives could be eradicated from the soil; even when the\r\nmiserable remnants had been transplanted to Kerry, many of them straggled\r\nback to live as hirelings on lands that had been their own. Such was the\r\nnew model on which Ireland was to be moulded into “civility and good\r\ngovernment;” and in 1622 a Royal Commission pronounced this plantation to\r\nhave been well begun and prosperously continued.\r\n\r\nLiterally, it was a war of extermination, which spread into other parts of\r\nIreland, and brought political and religious issues in its train. A year\r\nafter the Plantation Act, but before Mary Tudor’s death, Sussex wrote that\r\nthe native Irish were denying England’s right to Ireland, and preparing to\r\nassist the French and Scots. The events of Elizabeth’s reign taught them\r\nto look rather to Spain and to the Papacy, and by degrees Philip II.,\r\nafter whom King’s County and its capital, Philipstown, had been named,\r\nbecame the patron of the Irish who suffered from the plantation. Religion,\r\ntoo, came into play. The first Jesuit missionaries had returned in despair\r\nfrom their labours on the unresponsive Irish soil. But expropriation left\r\nthe peasants with little solace save religion, and their religion would\r\nnot be that of their oppressor; to them Protestantism meant plantation.\r\nThe links between English Government and Roman Catholic hierarchy had been\r\nbroken; and Catholicism, which has no natural affinities with nationalism,\r\nbecame the adventitious ally of the Irish people in their resistance to\r\nthe intruding imperialism of their English foes.\r\n\r\nThis coalition of hostile forces supplied the English Government with what\r\nit considered convincing arguments for persisting in its course; fresh\r\nJesuit missions to Ireland, and intrigues between Irish chiefs and Spanish\r\nambassadors sped the policy of plantation by provoking rebellion in\r\nMunster. The way seemed to have been prepared by the death of 30,000 Irish\r\nfrom starvation in that province within six months, and the pick of\r\nEngland’s aristocracy, Raleigh, Grenville, Herbert, Spenser, and Norris,\r\nundertook the work of civilisation. They performed it mostly by bailiffs,\r\nwho let the land at rack-rents to its former proprietors; and the whole\r\nfabric vanished in the rebellion which flamed out in 1598 on the news of\r\nTyrone’s victories in Ulster. With the assistance of Spain, Tyrone shook\r\nEnglish rule in Ireland almost to its foundations; but they remained firm,\r\nembedded in the sea. The Spanish squadrons were annihilated in Kinsale and\r\nCastlehaven Harbours, and Tyrone was granted terms of peace. Ireland was\r\nconquered as it never had been before, but England had not yet learnt how\r\nto pacify a conquered country. Four years later Tyrone and Tyrconnell fled\r\nto Spain; the claims of their natural successors were set aside; and their\r\nlands were divided among the Scottish and English founders of modern\r\nUlster. Thousands of natives, however, remained as tenants on the land of\r\nwhich they had been robbed, “hoping,” wrote the Lord-Deputy, “at one time\r\nor other to find an opportunity of cutting their landlords’ throats.” The\r\nunique character and the success of the Ulster plantation were due less to\r\nthe original planters than to the Calvinistic Scots who found there a\r\nrefuge from Laud and the Stuarts, and like the Pilgrim Fathers regarded\r\nthemselves as a people chosen to root out the Amalekite and Philistine\r\nnatives. Like the founders of New England, too, their relations with the\r\nnatives were far worse than those of the southern planters in Ireland, and\r\nthe southern planters in North America.\r\n\r\nThirty years later the natives of Ulster found their opportunity, and\r\nwreaked on their landlords, in the massacre of 1641, vengeance for a\r\ngeneration of robbery and oppression. There ensued a decade of\r\nindescribable confusion, in which native Irish, Anglo-Irish, Ulster Scots,\r\nEnglish parliamentarians, and Royalists fought one another, until Cromwell\r\nrepaid the massacre of 1641 by those of Drogheda and Wexford, and by a\r\nfurther process of expropriation called the Cromwellian Settlement. More\r\nthan two-thirds of Irish land had now passed into the hands of Englishmen;\r\nand although the Cromwellians had to disgorge a part of their spoil at the\r\nRestoration, it was estimated by Sir William Petty in 1664 that not more\r\nthan one-third of the land belonged to the native Irish, including in that\r\ncategory the descendants of Anglo-Norman families; of the remainder, about\r\nhalf belonged to Elizabethan and Jacobean planters, and half to the\r\nCromwellians. Nor was the process yet complete: the new expropriation was\r\nfollowed in 1689-90 by yet another attempt on the part of the Irish to\r\nrecover their inheritance, and the failure of that attempt by further\r\nconfiscation. At the beginning of the eighteenth century three-quarters of\r\nthe land was owned by the English garrison, and the progress of the\r\ncentury was marked by fresh evictions. Political reasons had ceased, but\r\neconomic causes supplied their place; and wide stretches of pasture were\r\nneeded in order that the landlords might turn _their_ property to the most\r\nprofitable grazing purposes. Only land that would not do for cattle was\r\nleft to the Irish peasants; from the bogs there looked up, from the barren\r\nhills there looked down, the Roman Catholic disinherited upon the smiling\r\nmeadows of their Protestant supplanters.\r\n\r\nUpon this broadening basis of plantation was developed the Irish\r\nParliament, a Parliament doomed from the first by the very conditions of\r\nits being to a sterile and troubled existence. Here and there from the\r\ndays of Elizabeth a native name may be traced in the lists of its members,\r\nbut it was almost exclusively the Parliament of a caste, the instrument of\r\noppression. Ten counties only sent representatives to Elizabeth’s\r\nParliament of 1560; plantation increased the number to twenty-seven in\r\n1585; and the tale was fairly complete when, after the plantation of\r\nUlster, James I. next summoned a Parliament in 1613. But the “Irish\r\ninterest” which struggled therein against the “English interest”\r\nrepresented only the Anglo-Irish families, who had struck some roots in\r\nthe soil and resented the dictation of English officials. The “native\r\ninterest” had no voice in Parliament until O’Connell’s triumph in 1828.\r\nHence the pitiful impotence of this Parliament, the emptiness of the sound\r\nand fury of its constitutional debates. The beneficiaries of conquest\r\ncould not in logic use the armoury of consent. The dependence of the\r\ncolonists upon England placed their Parliament at the mercy of the English\r\nGovernment. They relied upon English force to expropriate the native Irish\r\nand to proscribe the Roman Catholic religion; and this reliance deprived\r\nthem of moral and material grounds of resistance to the political,\r\ncommercial, and industrial tyranny of their masters. The power which gave\r\nthe planters their land could laugh at their constitutional pretensions.\r\nSo the Dublin Parliament idly strove to emulate its exemplar at\r\nWestminster, and clamoured in vain for responsible government, for control\r\nof the Irish Executive. In spite of its Irish Parliament, Ireland has\r\nnever been given the chance of governing itself.\r\n\r\nBut nothing could eradicate the “protest of the sea” against union with\r\nEngland, or the tendency of dwellers on Irish soil to become Irishmen. The\r\nAnglo-Normans had grown _Hibernis ipsis Hiberniores_ in the middle ages,\r\nand nothing short of the Tudor Conquest would have perpetuated English\r\ndominion; for even the gentry of the Pale rebelled in Elizabeth’s reign\r\nagainst “cess,” a form of arbitrary taxation compared in its\r\nconstitutional bearings with ship-money. In their turn the Tudor planters\r\nwere gripped by the Irish soil, and resisted the rule of Strafford; and a\r\nfresh immigration of Cromwellian settlers alone enabled William of Orange\r\nto hold Ireland against Tyrconnell and James II. Even their descendants,\r\ntoo, became part of the “Irish interest” in the eighteenth century; and\r\nPitt’s Act of Union was England’s final effort to circumvent the\r\ninsinuating strength of Irish nature.\r\n\r\nThe more Ireland’s Parliament succumbed to Irish ideas, the more it was\r\nflouted by England, and the greater the efforts made to secure in it the\r\npredominance of the English interest. England, in spite of itself, was\r\ncreating an Irish nation. It had destroyed the system of septs which it\r\ncould divide and play off against one another; by imposing on all a\r\ngrinding tyranny it had crushed out local distinctions and family feuds,\r\nand had evoked a national spirit which could not be corrupted by bribes or\r\ndisarmed by division. Poynings’ Laws were the first attempt at the new\r\nmethods of control which led to the Act of Union. They were soon found\r\ninsufficient. Not only must Irish legislation be curbed by the English\r\nPrivy Council; the English Parliament must also have the power of\r\ninitiating and passing laws for Ireland; and this practice grew up against\r\nwhich Molyneux vainly protested in 1694. In 1719 the practice was\r\nconfirmed by an English statute, which transferred to the British House of\r\nLords the appellate jurisdiction claimed by the Irish peers, and expressly\r\nasserted the right of the British Parliament to legislate for Ireland and\r\noverride Irish laws. Similarly the Irish electorate was more and more\r\nrigidly restricted to the English interest; members of both houses were,\r\nby an English statute of William and Mary, required to be Protestants, and\r\nin 1727, by an English statute of George II., Catholics, who numbered\r\nfour-fifths of the Irish people, were excluded from the franchise.\r\n\r\nThe same fear of a nascent Irish nationalism was the real motive for the\r\nIrish penal code, which assumed its worst features under Anne, and was\r\nlargely extended under George I. and George II., although no Jacobite\r\nrebellion in Ireland threatened those sovereigns, and the only provocation\r\nwas the silent growth of Irish national feeling. That its cause was not\r\nreligious is clear, for there was little religious persecution, and the\r\npenal code in Ireland was at its worst in the heyday of English\r\nlatitudinarianism. The design was really to shut out the Irish by means of\r\ntheir religion from political and social influence. Hence their exclusion\r\nfrom the legal and teaching professions, from the university, from the\r\narmy and the navy, from corporations, grand juries and vestries; hence the\r\nbarbarous laws by which a son converted to Protestantism could reduce his\r\nCatholic father to a mere life-tenant, by which no Catholic could buy or\r\nbequeath land or inherit or receive it as a gift from Protestants, by\r\nwhich he could not act as a guardian, a constable, or a gamekeeper,\r\npossess a horse worth more than £5, or keep more than two apprentices. A\r\nProtestant husband who married a Catholic wife fell under this penal code;\r\na Protestant wife who married a Catholic husband was deprived of her\r\ninheritance; and an Act of George II. declared that mixed marriages should\r\nbe null, and that the priests who made them should be hanged. Some\r\nknowledge of Irish history is required in order to appreciate the virtuous\r\nindignation roused by the Pope’s _Ne Temere_ decree. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury, wives were bribed by the law to turn against Catholic husbands,\r\nand children against their Catholic fathers; the fractious wife, the\r\nunnatural son had only to feign conversion in order to secure immunity and\r\nreward for undutiful conduct, and to deprive those whom they had injured\r\nof the management and disposal of their estates. Such was the system\r\nbegotten by force and fraud through the breach of the Treaty of Limerick,\r\nwhen William III.’s generals, in order to pacify Ireland, guaranteed to\r\nthe Irish people the enjoyment of their religious liberties. The arts\r\nwhich earlier English Governments had used to set chief against chief and\r\nclan against clan, were now employed on a more generous scale to set a\r\ndominant caste against the people they ruled, and to place at the absolute\r\ndisposal of an alien garrison the lives, the liberties, the conscience,\r\nthe property, and the domestic happiness of the nation it had robbed,\r\nmaltreated, and betrayed.\r\n\r\nDominion, however, was not in the eighteenth century an end in itself, but\r\na means for securing wealth. The age of commercial rivalry had set in\r\nduring the latter half of the seventeenth century, and English traders,\r\nwho had clamoured for the destruction of the Protestant Dutch, valued\r\ntheir hold over Catholic Ireland as a means for exploiting its markets and\r\ncrushing its competition. One after another of Ireland’s infant industries\r\nwas massacred to satisfy English jealousy. Strafford’s boasted\r\nencouragement of Irish linen was a blind to cover his campaign against\r\nIrish woollens. In the reign of Charles II. the importation of Irish\r\ncattle into England was prohibited because it lowered English rents, and\r\nIreland’s magnificent harbours were kept empty by its exclusion from the\r\nNavigation Acts, lest its incipient colonial trade should compete with\r\nEngland’s. Deprived of their market for cattle, the Irish developed\r\nsheep-rearing and woollen manufactures; in 1699 the English Parliament\r\naccordingly prohibited the export of Irish manufactured wool to any\r\ncountry whatever. The hypocritical plea was anxiety to stimulate Irish\r\nlinen, which the English Parliament thereupon practically excluded by a\r\nduty of 30 per cent. Having thus impoverished Ireland, Englishmen based\r\ntheir case against Irish claims to self-government on the thriftlessness\r\nof its people.\r\n\r\nAll classes in Ireland, Catholics and Protestants, landlords and tenants,\r\ntraders and farmers, were, however, involved in this common misfortune,\r\nwhich in its helpless position the Irish Parliament was powerless to\r\navert; and in spite of the discord sown with malignant ingenuity between\r\nthe English, the Irish, and the native interests, in spite of the\r\nperverted skill of viceroys and primates in maintaining the English\r\nfaction by purchasing boroughs and corrupting parliaments, a common\r\nimpulse began to pervade the carefully dislocated members of the Irish\r\nbody politic. Scandals like “Wood’s Halfpence” provoked a national protest\r\nin Swift’s “Drapier’s Letters”; a common feeling began to mitigate the\r\nferocity of the penal code, and to inspire a united demand for Irish\r\nfreedom from English oppression. The opportunity came with the War of\r\nAmerican Independence. Formed to provide a defence which England could not\r\nafford, the Irish Volunteers demanded the price for their services, and\r\nEngland had to pay it in Grattan’s Parliament. The history of Ireland’s\r\npacked and bribed and muzzled Parliament affords no proof of Ireland’s\r\nincapacity to rule itself; rather it shows the lengths of cruelty and\r\nviolence to which English Parliaments, in spite of their political genius,\r\nof their “glorious Revolution” of 1688, of their vaunted love of civil and\r\nreligious liberty, have been driven by fruitless efforts to govern a\r\ngifted people against its will. England sought, and inevitably failed, to\r\nrule Ireland on principles the reverse of those on which were based its\r\nown proud liberties and democratic Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.—Ireland, 1782 And 1912(123) BY LORD FITZMAURICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events of 1782 will always loom large in history, and the views of the\r\nmembers of the Rockingham Ministry on the proper relations to be\r\nestablished between Great Britain and Ireland, and the possible course of\r\nevents had they met with a negotiator less intractable than Grattan, are\r\nsubjects of more than merely historical interest.\r\n\r\nIn that ministry the Duke of Portland was Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and\r\nhe took with him Colonel Fitzpatrick as Chief Secretary; Mr. Fox was\r\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Lord Shelburne was Secretary of\r\nState for the Home and Colonial Departments, and as such was responsible\r\nfor the government of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the claim of Ireland to be a distinct Kingdom, with a\r\nright to a separate Legislature of her own for all purposes, was the\r\nobject of the movement of which Grattan was the leader. That this claim\r\nwas founded on historic right, and had also on grounds of expediency to be\r\naccepted, was admitted by the Whig statesmen of the time in England. But\r\nthey also saw that there were subjects which the geographical position of\r\nthe two countries, their past history, and their industrial interests,\r\nrendered it desirable and indeed necessary should be recognized as common\r\nproperty. Ireland, in their opinion, was too near to be a separate State\r\nwith safety to the external relations of Great Britain; she was too\r\ndistant to be altogether incorporated with due regard to the efficient\r\nmanagement of her own internal affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Lord Rockingham came into office on March 27th, 1782. The\r\nmoment was one of the gloomiest in English history. The nation had just\r\nbeen stunned by the news of the great surrender at York Town; it was an\r\nopen question whether the intelligence of the surrender of Gibraltar might\r\nnot be expected to follow; the power of the fleet to cope successfully\r\nwith the combined navies of France, Spain, and Holland, was doubtful; an\r\ninvasion was discussed in every household in the land as a serious\r\npossibility, and the resources of the country to meet it were disputed by\r\ncompetent judges. The new Prime Minister was himself a dying man, though\r\nthe dangerous character of his illness was concealed; the two Secretaries\r\nof State were separated by mutual suspicions which were rapidly ripening\r\ninto estrangement. Ireland was in the hands of the armed Volunteers, and\r\nEngland’s difficulty was, as usual, Ireland’s opportunity. “The liberties\r\nof America were inseparable from ours,” Grattan said in 1799, referring to\r\nthis period; “they were the only hope of Ireland, and the only refuge of\r\nthe liberties of mankind.”(124) The satisfaction of Ireland was therefore,\r\nin 1782, the first condition of the safety of England, and imposed itself\r\non the Ministers as their most imperious duty.\r\n\r\nThe four grievances of Ireland were, in the words of Grattan, “a foreign\r\nlegislature, a foreign judicature, a legislative Privy Council, and a\r\nperpetual army,”(125) and they were set forth in the Amendment to the\r\nAddress carried by him in the Irish Parliament on April 17th.(126)\r\n\r\n\r\n    “My opinion,” Fox wrote to Fitzpatrick, on April 28th, “is clear\r\n    for giving them all they ask; but for giving it them so as to\r\n    secure us from further demands, and at the same time to have some\r\n    clear understanding with respect to what we are to expect from\r\n    Ireland in return for the protection and assistance which she\r\n    receives from those fleets which cost us such enormous sums and\r\n    her nothing. If they mean really well to their country, they must\r\n    wish some final adjustment which may preclude further disputes; if\r\n    they mean nothing but consequence to themselves, they will insist\r\n    upon these points being given up simply, without any reciprocal\r\n    engagement; and as soon as this is done, begin to attack whatever\r\n    is left, in order to continue the ferment of the country. In one\r\n    word, what I want to guard against is Jonathan Wild’s plan of\r\n    seizing one part in order to dispute afterwards about the\r\n    remainder.”(127)\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Rockingham, writing in an exactly similar strain, said: “that the\r\nessential points of the Irish demands having first been conceded, it would\r\nbe the duty of both countries to consider how finally to arrange, settle,\r\nand adjust all matters, whereby the union of power and strength, and\r\nmutual and reciprocal advantage, might be best permanently fixed;” and he\r\nspoke favourably of the appointment of “Commissioners” on both sides, to\r\ndraw up the heads of an agreement between the two countries.(128) Of a\r\nsimilar character was the language of Lord Shelburne.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “If,” he said, writing to the Duke of Portland, on the day\r\n    following that on which Fox had addressed the Chief Secretary,\r\n    “the ties by which the two kingdoms have been hitherto so closely\r\n    united are to be loosened or cut asunder, is your Grace yet\r\n    prepared to advise whether any, and if so what, substitutions are\r\n    thought of for the preservation of the remaining connection\r\n    between us? If by the proposed modification of Poynings’ Law, so\r\n    much power is taken from the two Privy Councils as they are now\r\n    constituted, are we to look for any agreement in any new\r\n    institution of Council, which may answer the purpose of keeping up\r\n    the appendancy and connection of Ireland to the Crown of Great\r\n    Britain, and of preventing that confusion which must arise in all\r\n    cases of common concern from two Parliaments with distinct and\r\n    equal powers, and without any operating centre.”(129)\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 11th, Fox, in another letter to Fitzpatrick, explained his views;\r\nwhat he intended, he said, was to grant the “concession of ‘internal\r\nlegislation’ as a preliminary, accompanied with a modification of\r\nPoyning’s Law and a temporary Mutiny Bill;” and he hoped that, having made\r\nthese concessions, “they might be able to treat of ’other matters’ so\r\namicably as to produce an arrangement that would preserve the connection\r\nbetween the two countries.”(130) The other matters were the Final\r\nJudicature and the question of the contribution of Ireland to Imperial\r\nexpenses. Shelburne suggested the formal negotiation of “the articles of a\r\ntreaty,” for as such, he said, he regarded his proposals;(131) and he\r\nurged a little judicious temporizing in the hope that the situation abroad\r\nmight in the interval improve. But Grattan, recognizing the immense\r\nadvantage which this situation gave him in negotiating with Great Britain,\r\nrefused to entertain any idea of compromise. There was not only, he said,\r\nto be no “foreign legislature, but there were to be no commissioners” to\r\nnegotiate a treaty,(132) and there was, above all, to be no delay in\r\ngranting all the demands of Ireland. With this information before him, the\r\nDuke of Portland, who from the time of his arrival in Dublin had up till\r\nthis moment encouraged both the Secretaries of State to believe that\r\nGrattan would come into their views, and might even make concessions(133)\r\nin regard to the final appeal in judicial matters, now informed them that\r\nthe claims of Ireland on all the four principal demands must be conceded,\r\nand conceded at once, as the whole country was in a state of the wildest\r\nexcitement, and was rapidly escaping control.(134) The concession of all\r\nthe Irish demands was accordingly decided upon. The preliminary steps were\r\ntaken on May 17th, by a resolution in both Houses of the British\r\nParliament, for effecting the repeal of the 6th of Geo. I., c. 5, the Act\r\nby which the right of the British Parliament to legislate for Ireland was\r\ndeclared; and the necessary Bill was then introduced and rapidly passed\r\ninto law.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, however, another resolution was adopted in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “That it is the opinion of this House that it is indispensable to\r\n    the interest and happiness of both kingdoms that the connection\r\n    between them should be established by mutual consent upon a solid\r\n    and permanent footing; and that an humble address be presented to\r\n    His Majesty, that His Majesty will be graciously pleased to take\r\n    such measures as His Majesty in his royal wisdom shall think most\r\n    conducive to that end.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn these resolutions Fox commented as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Ireland,” he said, “would have no reason to complain; the terms\r\n    acceded to by England were proposed by herself, and all her wishes\r\n    would now be gratified in the way which she herself liked best.\r\n    But as it was possible that if nothing more was to be done than\r\n    what he had stated to be his intention, Ireland might, perhaps,\r\n    think of fresh grievances and rise yearly in her demands, it was\r\n    fit and proper that something should be done towards establishing\r\n    on a firm and solid basis the future connection of the two\r\n    kingdoms. But that was not to be proposed by him here in\r\n    Parliament: it would be the duty of the Crown to look to that; the\r\n    business might be first begun by His Majesty’s servants in\r\n    Ireland, and if afterwards it should be necessary to enter into a\r\n    treaty, Commissioners might be sent from the British Parliament or\r\n    from the Crown, to enter upon it and bring the negotiation to a\r\n    happy issue, by giving mutual satisfaction to both countries, and\r\n    establishing a treaty which should be sanctified by the most\r\n    solemn forms of the Constitution of both countries.”(135)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the moment, however, the hope of commencing negotiations with these\r\nobjects had to be abandoned, and when, on May 27th, the Royal Message\r\nconveying the intention of His Majesty to concede all the demands of the\r\nIrish Parliament was delivered in Dublin, the Secretary to the\r\nLord-Lieutenant announced that no measures were then intended to be\r\ngrounded on the second English resolution of May 17th. For a time,\r\nhowever, the Duke of Portland continued to hope against hope, and to\r\nnourish the vain expectations with which from the beginning he had buoyed\r\nhimself up, and had misled his colleagues. During the month of June he\r\nallowed himself to be persuaded by Mr. Ogilvy, the husband of the Duchess\r\nof Leinster, and stepfather to Lord Edward Fitzgerald, that Grattan was\r\nnot really so intractable as he seemed to be, and in a secret and\r\nconfidential despatch, written on June 6th, he urged that the Irish\r\nParliament should not be at once prorogued, in order to give time for a\r\npossible arrangement in regard to common affairs. But on June 22nd he was\r\nreluctantly compelled to express his disappointment and mortification at\r\nfinding that his hopes had proved entirely fallacious, and that Mr. Ogilvy\r\nwas a person not to be relied upon. The prorogation of the Irish\r\nParliament was accordingly suffered to take place on July 27th, and here\r\nthe matter ended.(136) “Thus,” exclaimed Grattan to his applauding\r\naudience—“thus have you sealed a treaty with Great Britain; on her side\r\nthe restoration of the final judicature; the extinction of her legislative\r\nclaim; of her Privy Council; of her perpetual Mutiny Bill; the repeal of\r\nthe Act of legislative supremacy; on your side satisfaction! And thus are\r\nthe two nations compacted for ever in freedom and peace.”(137)\r\n\r\nSubsequently at the time of the Union a controversy arose in regard to\r\nthese events. Mr. Pitt asserted that the adjustment of 1782 was not\r\nconsidered by the British Ministers by whom it was effected as final in\r\nits character; but that, on the contrary, they were fully convinced of the\r\nnecessity of adopting some further measures to strengthen the connection\r\nbetween the two countries, and he produced the correspondence which had\r\npassed in 1782—extracts from which have been given above—as a reply to the\r\nlame attempt of General Fitzpatrick, who was still in Parliament, to deny\r\nthat any such negotiation had been desired by the members of Lord\r\nRockingham’s Ministry. General Fitzpatrick had declined to admit more than\r\nthat the Duke of Portland, during his residence in Ireland, might have\r\nentertained a vague idea of some farther arrangement for consolidating the\r\nconnection with Ireland, but had soon given it up; and Grattan in the\r\nIrish Parliament openly accused Lord Shelburne and the Duke of having\r\nconcealed their views from their colleagues, and said that, above all, Mr.\r\nFox knew nothing of the project contained in the despatch of June\r\n6th.(138) The truth is, that the Rockingham Ministry was in June a house\r\ndivided against itself, owing to differences of opinion as to the peace\r\nnegotiation with France and the United States, and was almost in the\r\nactual throes of dissolution. From a letter written by Fox in 1799 to\r\nFitzpatrick, it certainly appears that the so-called “Ogilvy” negotiation\r\nnever was communicated to him.(139) But the assertion of Mr. Pitt went far\r\nbeyond the Ogilvy negotiation—if negotiation it can be called. What Mr.\r\nPitt asserted was, not that the correspondence proved that in June, 1782,\r\nthe Ministers were actually intending to enter on any such negotiation,\r\nbut that the Prime Minister, the Lord-Lieutenant, and both Secretaries of\r\nState, from the very commencement of the correspondence in April,\r\nconsidered the arrangement insisted on by Grattan deficient, and lacking\r\nin finality, and were only prevented by the stress of adverse\r\ncircumstances and the impracticable character of the Irish leaders, from\r\ntrying to negotiate an agreement, by which Ireland should acknowledge that\r\n“the superintending power and supremacy were where Nature had placed\r\nthem”—viz., in the Government of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the view which the British Ministers in 1782 took of the\r\nrelations which it was desirable to establish between Great Britain and\r\nIreland—the relations which, had events been more favourable, they would\r\nhave established? Evidently it was not a legislative union, though they\r\nwished to retain the final judicial appeal in London. The object of the\r\nDuke of Portland, as he explained in the secret despatch of June 6th, was\r\nthat an Act of Parliament should be passed by the Legislatures of the\r\nrespective kingdoms, by which “the superintending power and supremacy” of\r\nGreat Britain in all matters of State and general commerce would be\r\nvirtually and effectively acknowledged; by which also a share of the\r\nexpense in carrying on a defensive or offensive war, either in support of\r\nour dominions or those of our allies, should be borne by Ireland in\r\nproportion to the state of her abilities; and that she should adopt every\r\nsuch regulation as might be judged necessary by Great Britain for the\r\nbetter ordering and securing her trade and commerce with foreign nations,\r\nor her own colonies and dependencies; consideration being duly had to the\r\ncircumstances of Great Britain. “This plan,” Lord Shelburne explained\r\nduring the debates of 1799, “had nothing to do with a legislative\r\nunion.”(140) “It related,” he said, “to what might be called the expense\r\nof the system which was carried on under the two Parliaments, in Army,\r\nNavy, commerce and finance, and in the great establishments of Church and\r\nState; and it did not imply ‘bringing the two Parliaments\r\ntogether.’ ”(141)\r\n\r\nFrom these passages it appears that what the Whig statesmen aimed at in\r\n1782 was to obtain, in the first place, a clear acknowledgment of the\r\nImperial supremacy, or, as they would have said in the language of the\r\ntime, of the power of Great Britain in “external” as distinct from\r\n“internal” legislation; and, in the next place, a contribution from\r\nIreland to the expenses of external administration and policy: the Fleet,\r\nthe Army, and the diplomatic and commercial establishments. “I humbly\r\nconceive,” said Burke, who was a member of the Rockingham Government, and\r\nthe trusted adviser of his official chief, “that the whole of the\r\nsuperior, and what I should call Imperial politics, ought to have its\r\nresidence here [in London]; and that Ireland, locally, civilly and\r\ncommercially independent, ought politically to look up to Great Britain in\r\nall matters of peace or war, and, in a word, with her to live and die. At\r\nbottom, Ireland has no other choice—I mean no other national choice.”(142)\r\n\r\nVery different were the views of the Irish Parliamentary leaders: not of\r\nGrattan only, but of his rival, Flood, as can be gathered from the perusal\r\nof the debates in the Irish Parliament, which culminated in the famous\r\nstruggle between Flood and Grattan on October 28th, 1782, when Flood,\r\nhaving denounced Grattan as a “mendicant patriot,” and Grattan having\r\nretorted by likening his rival “to a bird of prey with an evil aspect and\r\na sepulchral note,” the two leaders left the House in order to solve their\r\ndifferences by a duel, and were only prevented meeting in deadly combat by\r\nthe interposition of the Speaker, who wisely issued his warrant to\r\napprehend them both.\r\n\r\nThe contention of Flood was that the mere repeal of the Act of George I.\r\nwas insufficient, and did not prevent its revival at any future period;\r\nthat it really left the matter where it stood, and that it was therefore\r\nnecessary to bring in a Bill for declaring the sole and exclusive right of\r\nthe Irish Parliament to make laws in all cases whatsoever, internal and\r\nexternal, for the kingdom of Ireland. His desire was to trump Grattan’s\r\ncards, and destroy his popularity, which in the following year he all but\r\nsucceeded in doing, when a decision of Lord Mansfield in the Court of\r\nKing’s Bench enabled him to raise a cry that the independence of the Irish\r\nCourts of Judicature was in danger; and a further Act was forced on the\r\nBritish Government renouncing any claim to legislate and confirming the\r\nindependence of the Irish Courts of Justice.(143) The contention of\r\nGrattan was that the relations between Great Britain and Ireland were to\r\nbe ascertained from the record of the whole of the recent transactions,\r\nwhich were transactions between two independent nations having a common\r\nSovereign; and this being so, he said it was no more possible for Great\r\nBritain to reassert her legislative supremacy over Ireland than it would\r\nbe for her to do so over the American colonies, if the pending\r\nnegotiations resulted, as they evidently were about to do, in a\r\nrecognition of the independence of those colonies. Grattan, indeed, went\r\nso far as to say that the relations between Great Britain and Ireland were\r\nin future to be sought in the law of nations and not in the municipal\r\nlegislation of either country, which he said was no longer applicable. But\r\nboth the Irish leaders agreed that in one way or another the legislative,\r\nfinancial, and judicial links between the two countries were to be\r\nsevered, however much they differed as to the legal formulas which were to\r\nimpress and carry out these ideas.(144)\r\n\r\nThe following propositions can, then, be based on the events of 1782:\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) That the Irish leaders insisted on the freedom of Ireland from\r\n    interference by the British Parliament both in internal and\r\n    external affairs, or, as would now be said, both on Home and\r\n    Imperial questions.\r\n\r\n    (2) That the British Ministers were ready to concede the former,\r\n    and were not ready to yield the latter; but conceded both, owing\r\n    to the circumstances of the time, and considered the concession\r\n    final.\r\n\r\n    (3) That the British Ministers wished to obtain a contribution\r\n    from Ireland for Imperial purposes, and the maintenance of a final\r\n    appeal to an Imperial Court of Judicature.\r\n\r\n    (4) That the British Ministers do not appear to have proposed the\r\n    representation of Ireland in the British Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn substance the plan proposed by Mr. Gladstone in 1886 was the plan which\r\nGrattan rejected in 1782. The objection to any such plan is the\r\nprobability that if Ireland were to be asked, and were even to consent for\r\nthe moment to make an appreciable contribution to the common expenses of\r\nthe Empire, without being given through her representatives any share in\r\nthe Parliamentary control of the funds so voted, and in the discussion of\r\nImperial affairs—if, in other words, she was made a tribute-paying colony,\r\ninstead of being treated as a member of a Federal system having an\r\nundiminished area of taxation for National purposes—a fresh and formidable\r\ngrievance would arise in a few years, on the ground that taxation without\r\nrepresentation was an intolerable thing, and contrary to the first\r\nprinciples of the Constitution. It was with these considerations present\r\nto his mind that Mr. Butt, when leader of the Irish Home Rule Party, in\r\norder to get over the difficulty, had proposed that a Federal arrangement\r\nshould be instituted between Great Britain and Ireland—_i.e._, an\r\narrangement under which Great Britain and Ireland should agree to vest\r\ncertain powers in a purely Irish Legislature and certain others in the\r\nImperial Parliament. The late Mr. Sharman Crawford, who like Mr. Butt was\r\nan Ulsterman and a Protestant, held similar views at an earlier epoch, and\r\nput them prominently forward during the period which elapsed between the\r\nimprisonment of O’Connell and the collapse of the first Tenant-right\r\nmovement. With their opinion before us, it may be asked—why was no such\r\nplan proposed in 1782 by the English statesmen of the day? The answer is\r\nnot far to seek.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century knew little or nothing about Federal Government.\r\nThe Constitution of the United States, the parent of all the numerous\r\nlater schemes of Federalism, was still in the limbo of the future; and it\r\nwould be as idle to blame the Government of 1782 for not entering on a\r\njourney into the region of the unknown, especially at a moment of\r\nunexampled public difficulty, as it would be to blame the statesmen of the\r\npresent day for not anticipating the political discoveries of the next\r\ngeneration, whatever they may prove to be. It was owing no doubt to the\r\nidea of Federal Government being practically unknown to the men of 1782,\r\nand to the unwillingness of the English mind to strike out on a new and as\r\nyet untrodden path in the art of Government, that in all the discussions\r\nof that time there is little or no suggestion of instituting a Federal\r\nlink between Great Britain and Ireland. Some such suggestion was made\r\nduring the negotiations on the Scotch Union, but it was decisively\r\nrejected by England, and only weakly urged by Scotland. The period was, in\r\nfact, one when Europe was still under the influence of a set of ideas\r\nwhich worked in an exactly opposite direction to the ideas of nationality\r\nand Federalism. The period was indeed drawing to a close; but the whole\r\ntendency of history had for two centuries previously been in the direction\r\nof large agglomerations of territory and centralization of government,\r\nquite irrespective of questions of nationality and race, and that tendency\r\nwas still potent in 1782. The idea that the advantages of a national\r\nGovernment, extending over a large territory, might be combined with those\r\nof a decentralization of authority by a division of jurisdictions, was not\r\none which the statesmen of the day in Europe had begun seriously to\r\nconsider. Separation they understood, or an incorporate union: the\r\npossibility of an intermediate arrangement they ignored.\r\n\r\nAnd yet an experiment in Federal Government is not to be approached with a\r\nlight heart, and perhaps one thing only can be said about it with any\r\ncertainty, that whatever success has attended it, wherever in fact it has\r\nworked smoothly, it has been when the powers reserved to the Federal or\r\nNational Government have been those only which were strictly necessary,\r\nand in regard to which differences of opinion would presumably not arise\r\namongst the States forming the Union.\r\n\r\nIt is the more important to bear these considerations in mind, because of\r\nthe existence of a widely spread but erroneous idea in regard to the\r\nUnited States Constitution, to the effect that the Federal Government has\r\nvery numerous and extensive powers in internal affairs assured to it by\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Federal Court. This Court, it is said, can\r\nintervene, under the terms of the Constitution, to arrest the action of\r\nthe State Governments, and therefore, once given a Federal Court, the\r\nsuccess of the Federal experiment is assured.\r\n\r\nBut it is necessary to realize that it is only because the powers of the\r\nFederal Government are very strictly limited, and that the Federal Court\r\nis not overweighted with the assertion of rights, the exercise of which\r\nthe public opinion of the States might not support, that its jurisdiction,\r\nwhen asserted, is as a rule respected, while over the State Legislatures\r\nas such it has no power at all, by way of injunction or prohibition. Nor\r\nhave cases been wanting from which the precarious character of its powers,\r\nand its occasional lack of any sufficient sanction to enforce its decrees,\r\nmay be gathered, when it has happened that those decrees have not been in\r\naccord with the prevailing opinion of the State within which execution has\r\nhad to be carried out. In 1812, when a state of war existed with Great\r\nBritain, the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut refused obedience to\r\nthe orders of the Federal Government for the concentration of the militias\r\nof all the Northern States on the frontier, giving as their reason that\r\nthe Constitution only empowered the Federal Government to call out the\r\nmilitia in the case of “insurrection or actual invasion,” and that neither\r\nof these two eventualities had arisen. These doctrines met with general\r\napproval in the two States in question, and were endorsed by their\r\nGovernors, their Legislatures, and their tribunals, nor were the Federal\r\nCourts able to enforce obedience to the commands of the Government at\r\nWashington. By a strict limitation of the powers of the National\r\nGovernment to what is absolutely necessary in order to secure the\r\nexistence of the United States as a nation, the framers of the\r\nConstitution of 1787 did as much as it was possible to do, in order to\r\nrender their work permanent; but they were not able, as De Tocqueville\r\npointed out, even before the war of Secession had come to confirm the\r\nforesight of his views, altogether to avoid the dangers which are the\r\nnatural inheritance of all Federal forms of Government.\r\n\r\nThe possibility, then, of establishing a Federal connection of any kind\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland—that is to say, an arrangement under\r\nwhich certain powers would be vested in an Irish Legislature and\r\nExecutive, and certain others in a Parliament and Executive common to both\r\ncountries—depends entirely on whether it is believed not only that such a\r\ndivision of power can be successfully made upon paper—a feat which any\r\nconstitution-monger can accomplish—but also that public opinion in Ireland\r\nwill not interpose hopeless obstacles to the assertion of the reserved\r\nrights and powers of the Imperial Legislature and Executive.\r\n\r\nThat under a Federal arrangement there would be any real possibility of\r\nfrequent interference from London in Irish internal affairs is not\r\nprobable, even were such interference legal. The attempt could only end in\r\nfailure. Much has been said about the supremacy of the British or Imperial\r\nParliament; and some of those who have used this expression apparently\r\nmean that every Act of the Irish Legislature and Executive is in some way\r\nor another to be reviewed by the British Parliament and Executive; or that\r\nin defiance of the plain teaching of history there is to be no responsible\r\nIrish Executive. The certain result of this would be to destroy the sense\r\nof responsibility in the Irish Legislature, to create endless differences\r\nof opinion between the two countries, and to make Great Britain the\r\n“whipping-boy” of Ireland, whenever Ireland had done anything foolish, and\r\nthe British Parliament had not stepped in to prevent it. Reasonable men\r\nwill continue to differ about the grant of Home Rule; but whatever is\r\ngranted to Ireland in the way of legislative or executive right must be\r\ngiven fully and frankly, without looking backward. We must allow ourselves\r\nin this matter to listen to the voice of the statesmen of 1782. On the\r\nother hand, whatever is reserved must be clearly reserved, with ample\r\nguarantees for the arm of the Imperial Executive being long enough and\r\nstrong enough to put down resistance. But that the power of the Imperial\r\nParliament and Executive could, under any circumstances, be exerted\r\nfrequently and in many matters, is a dangerous and impotent delusion. That\r\npower can only be maintained by carefully selecting and limiting the\r\nobjects to which it is to relate; and by admitting Irish representatives\r\nto their full share—neither more nor less—of the control of Imperial\r\nquestions in the Imperial Parliament, and securing adequate machinery for\r\nthe execution of the decrees of the Imperial Government in Ireland when\r\nnecessary. The arguments against any petty and irritating interference\r\nwith the internal affairs of Ireland would be just as strong now as those\r\nwhich Lord Chatham used in 1774 against the proposed interference of the\r\nBritish House of Commons with the Absentee tax which the Irish Parliament\r\nwas in that year supposed to be about to pass:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The justice or policy of the tax,” he said, “is not the question;\r\n    and on these two, endless arguments may be maintained _pro_ and\r\n    _con_. The simple question is, have the Commons of Ireland\r\n    exceeded the powers lodged with them by the essential constitution\r\n    of Parliament? I answer, they have not, and the interference of\r\n    the British Parliament would in this case be unjust, and the\r\n    measure destructive of all fair correspondence between England and\r\n    Ireland for ever.”(145)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn what way would the British Parliament be more able to interfere in such\r\na case than it was in 1774?\r\n\r\nThat Great Britain, if she chooses, is strong enough to govern Ireland for\r\na prolonged period against the wishes of the majority of the people of\r\nIreland, is indeed true; and under a strong and consistent Administration,\r\nstrict and even justice might no doubt produce quiet and a considerable\r\ndegree of material prosperity, without the constitutional question being\r\ntouched. But the existence of outward calm and material prosperity has\r\nalways been a favourite plea with the opponents of political reform. And\r\nit is the most subtle and dangerous of all possible pleas, so soothing in\r\ncharacter, and making apparently so winning an appeal to plain common\r\nsense and to self-evident facts. “Now, after all this,” says Lord\r\nClarendon, when describing the period in which England was administered,\r\njudged, and legislated for by the Privy Council, “I must be so just as to\r\nsay that during the whole time that these measures were exercised, and\r\nthese new and extraordinary ways were run, this kingdom enjoyed the\r\ngreatest calm and the fullest measure of felicity that any people in any\r\nage for so long a time together (for the above-mentioned eleven or twelve\r\nyears) have been blessed with, to the wonder and envy of all the other\r\nparts of Christendom.” But a few years after the happy period described in\r\nsuch glowing terms by the great historian the Civil War broke out.\r\n\r\nIf the necessity for a political change exists, sooner or later it forces\r\nits way to the front, notwithstanding outward calm. It has been so before,\r\nand there is no reason to doubt that it will be so again, because the\r\nclaim made by Ireland depends on permanent facts which statesmen cannot\r\nalter notwithstanding occasional periods of material prosperity and\r\noutward calm. As the ultimate solution of existing difficulties it is\r\nindicated by the geography and by the history of the island; and these are\r\nthe two conditions of every political problem, which it is difficult to\r\nsurmount or evade. Time may indeed slowly soften the asperities produced\r\nby past errors and the crimes of bygone generations; but the geographical\r\nconditions of a problem remain fixed and unalterable, and in the long run\r\nwill be found to be the permanent factor which governs the situation. Not\r\nby empty formulas, such as “governing Ireland according to Irish ideas,”\r\nor, “extending all the liberties enjoyed by the subjects of Great Britain\r\nto those of the sister island,” shall we advance one yard on our way, or\r\nindeed do aught but make it clear to friend and foe alike, that we are\r\ncultivating contradictory ideas without even being apparently aware that\r\nwe are doing so. What we have to do is to resolve to take our stand on the\r\nfew firm bits of fact which emerge like stepping-stones traversing a\r\nquaking bog; and then we may get over, and some day perhaps climb the\r\ndistant hills which are on the other side. Otherwise we shall go on\r\n“filling our belly with the east wind” to the end of time; we shall fish\r\nall night and take nothing. These few firm bits of fact are those provided\r\nby history and geography. Open the map and look at the situation of Great\r\nBritain and of Ireland relatively to each other; observe how they lie\r\nnear, yet apart; how they are separated by intervening seas, but seas so\r\nnarrow as to be a bond quite as much as a bar; how they are inhabited by\r\nraces speaking the same language but professing different religions; and\r\nbear in mind that these are the features of the picture which cannot be\r\naltered. This being so, let us next suppose that some stranger ignorant of\r\nall the trivial details of the Irish question, on his arrival amongst us,\r\nwere asked to state what, in his opinion, with the above conditions placed\r\nbefore him, the institutions of two such islands relatively to one another\r\nwere likely to be, judging from his experience of other countries. Would\r\nhe not probably reply that the wise statesmen of Great Britain, of whose\r\nfame he had heard in foreign lands, had doubtless long ago come to the\r\nconclusion that their separation for some purposes, and their union for\r\nothers, was stamped on the map as the certain and inevitable condition of\r\nany satisfactory settlement of their mutual relations, and that, alike to\r\ntheir complete separation and to their complete union, there was one and\r\nthe same answer: _Opposuit natura_.\r\n\r\nBut, further, let us suppose him in his turn to inquire what the\r\nexperience of the past had been in this particular case; and whether the\r\ntwo countries at the present time were entirely united or entirely\r\nseparate, or were linked by some intermediate arrangement adapted to their\r\nrelative needs and springing out of them; and suppose that the answer was,\r\nas it would have to be, that after several centuries of aggravated strife,\r\nthey had first tried entire legislative separation, and had then abandoned\r\nit for an absolute incorporate union. Would he in that case be astonished\r\nif he was informed that history had vindicated geography, and that under\r\nneither of these two relations had peace, goodwill, and amity, been the\r\ndistinguishing characteristics of the relations of Great Britain and\r\nIreland?\r\n\r\nTo such a traveller it might perhaps be explained as an unexampled\r\nportent, that although constitutional liberty, limited only by the right\r\nof every Government to suppress crime and repress disorder, had been\r\nextended by the larger to the smaller country; that although an equal\r\nrepresentation, a wide suffrage and vote by ballot had also been given,\r\nand no alien Church any longer vexed the conscientious scruples of the\r\nmajority, and the land system of the country had also been reformed, yet\r\nso unreasonable were the minds of the Irish people that they refused to be\r\ncontented, and were now asking for a modification of the fundamental\r\narticles of the existing incorporate union, and that a constant agitation\r\nin consequence prevailed.\r\n\r\nMight he not reply that he had heard it said by them of old time, that it\r\nwas a mistake to be too much alarmed by the existence of political\r\nagitation; that absolute quiet is not a necessary sign of political health\r\neven in a constitutional State; that what is called union within a\r\npolitical system may be a very equivocal expression; that the true union\r\nis a harmony, the result of which is that all parties, however opposed in\r\nappearance, co-operate towards the common good; that union may even exist\r\nin a State where the eye at first seems only to recognize a busy\r\nconfusion; and that the contentment of the population with the\r\ninstitutions under which they live is the only solid guarantee of their\r\npermanence.(146) Englishmen, he might add, in conclusion, had themselves\r\nbeen occupied for two centuries in proclaiming these and similar liberal\r\nsentiments from one end of Europe to the other, and the time had now\r\nperhaps arrived for applying them nearer home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.—Grattan’s Parliament. BY G. P. GOOCH\r\n\r\n\r\nGrattan’s Parliament was born of the American War of Independence and was\r\nslain by the French Revolution. Brief as was its life, it forms the most\r\nbrilliant and interesting episode in Irish history. Never has the ancient\r\nand unconquerable spirit of nationality spoken in more eloquent accents\r\nthan during the years when Grattan, loyal alike to the British connection\r\nand to Irish ideals, had won for his countrymen a measure of\r\nself-government. Representing only the Protestant minority, clogged with\r\ncorruption, and containing its full share of selfish and reactionary\r\ninfluences, it was none the less the focus and the mouthpiece of national\r\nfeeling. Fairly to judge the Grattan Parliament we must not only recall\r\nits limitations and errors but contrast its throbbing vitality with the\r\nservitude that preceded its foundation and the creeping paralysis which\r\nfollowed its dissolution.\r\n\r\nA long sleep had succeeded the final expulsion of James II. from Ireland.\r\nThe penal code was perfected into a system accurately described by Burke\r\nas most perfectly fitted to degrade and brutalise the human spirit.\r\nCatholic Ireland was voiceless and wholly lacking in political\r\nconsciousness; and the silence of Protestants was only broken by a rare\r\nprotest from Molyneux, Swift, or Lucas. If any doubt remained under\r\nPoynings’ Laws as to the complete dependence on Great Britain, it was set\r\nat rest by the Declaratory Act passed at Westminster in 1719. The Viceroys\r\nbefore Townshend only spent a few weeks in Dublin every second year for\r\nthe biennial sessions of Parliament. The Lords Justices governed the\r\ncountry for its English masters by influence and corruption, and the Irish\r\npension list provided grants too degrading to be charged on English\r\nrevenues. A new era opened when Flood took his seat in 1759 and organised\r\nan Opposition, the programme of which included the limitation of\r\nparliaments, the revision of the pension list, the creation of a militia\r\nand the independence of the Irish Legislature. The first object was\r\nsecured in 1768 by the Octennial Act; but at the height of his power and\r\npopularity he was captured by the Government, which naturally desired to\r\ndisarm its most formidable foe. After an interval of independent support,\r\nthe great orator accepted a salaried office and a seat in the Privy\r\nCouncil in 1775. In the same year Grattan entered Parliament at the age of\r\ntwenty-nine, and quickly asserted his title to the leadership of the\r\nnational party which Flood, in an evil moment for himself and his country,\r\nhad abdicated.\r\n\r\nThe new leader was favoured by circumstances. While Flood clamoured for\r\nthe suppression of the American revolt, the Presbyterians of the north\r\nloudly applauded the colonists, many thousands of whom had recently\r\nemigrated from Ulster. The community of interest was fully realised on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic; but Ireland asked for political and commercial\r\nautonomy, not for independence. With the demand there rapidly emerged the\r\ninstrument of its realisation. Ireland was almost without troops when\r\nFrance declared war in 1778. When it became clear that the Government were\r\nunable to defend the island, the Protestant gentry came forward, and in a\r\nfew weeks a disciplined and enthusiastic force of 40,000 men was under\r\narms. Though organised for defence, the Volunteers, inspired by Charlemont\r\nand Grattan, determined to employ their strength in exacting concessions\r\nfrom the British Government. To use the words of Fox, the American war was\r\nthe Irish harvest. The larger part of the damage inflicted on Irish\r\ncommerce and manufactures by the legislation of the prominent partner was\r\nirreparable; but something might be saved from the wreck. The menacing\r\naspect of the Volunteers and the panic-stricken despatches from Dublin\r\nCastle convinced the North Ministry that there was no alternative but to\r\nyield. Foreign and colonial trade was thrown open, the embargo on exports\r\nwas removed, and Ireland was at last free to make use of her resources.\r\n\r\nThe easy overthrow of commercial restrictions encouraged Grattan to a\r\nbolder flight. In 1780 he moved his historic resolution “That no person on\r\nearth, save the King, Lords, and Commons of Ireland, has a right to make\r\nlaws for Ireland.” The motion was withdrawn after an impressive debate;\r\nbut when the Volunteer Convention, which met shortly after, unanimously\r\nadopted the demand for self-government, the British Ministry surrendered.\r\nIn April, 1782, the declaration of legislative independence was brought\r\nforward by Grattan in one of his noblest orations. “I found Ireland on her\r\nknees. She is now a nation. In that character I hail her, and, bowing in\r\nher august presence, I say, _Esto perpetua_!” A new and happier era seemed\r\nat last to be opening in the fortunes of Ireland and in her relations with\r\nGreat Britain. “I am convinced,” wrote Burke to Charlemont in words of\r\ngold, “that no reluctant tie can be a strong one, and that a natural,\r\ncheerful alliance will be a far more secure link of connection than any\r\nprinciple of subordination borne with grudging and discontent.” Grattan\r\nwas fully satisfied with the repeal of the Declaratory Act of 1719; but\r\nwhen the demand arose for an express renunciation of the authority of the\r\nBritish Parliament, the Coalition Ministry of Fox and North passed an Act\r\nunconditionally recognising the right of the Irish people to be bound only\r\nby laws enacted by the King and the Irish Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Grattan Parliament appeared to enter on its career with a fair capital\r\nof good will. Irishmen began to feel that they had a country; and though\r\nautonomy had been wrested in an hour of weakness by a show of force, there\r\nwas no trace of resentment in the debates at St. Stephen’s which\r\naccompanied the renunciation of power. The new constitution seemed to\r\nenable Ireland to work out her own salvation without let or hindrance. But\r\nthe powers which appeared so ample were in reality strictly limited. In\r\nthe first place, while the Irish Legislature became in theory the peer of\r\nthe British Legislature, the Irish Executive—the Lord-Lieutenant and the\r\nChief Secretary—continued to be appointed by and responsible to the\r\nBritish Ministry. Secondly, Irish Bills did not become law till they were\r\nsanctioned by the King and sealed by the Great Seal on the advice of\r\nBritish Ministers. Finally, a majority of the Irish Parliament rested not\r\non the free choice of the people or even of the Protestant population, but\r\non the owners of nomination boroughs, most of whom were bound to the\r\nExecutive by the possession or prospect of titles, pensions or sinecures.\r\nGovernment by patronage survived the Renunciation Act, and reduced the\r\nauthority of the Grattan Parliament to a shadow. The power of withholding\r\nsupplies was an empty privilege; for the greater part of the income of the\r\ncountry came from the hereditary revenue, which was independent of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties inherent in the novel situation were speedily revealed.\r\nIt was Grattan’s fervent wish that the Volunteers, their emancipating task\r\naccomplished, should dissolve and leave the parliament to carry out its\r\nwork. Flood, on the other hand, who had rejoined the ranks of the\r\nOpposition, had less confidence in the sincerity of the British\r\nGovernment, and desired to retain the weapon that had proved so effective,\r\nat any rate till a Reform Bill had placed the Legislature in a position to\r\nwithstand the insidious assaults of the Executive. Parliamentary reform\r\nwas the natural corollary of the Renunciation Act. Flood laid his\r\nproposals before the Volunteer Convention, and, armed with its approval,\r\ncarried them to College Green. His object was to emancipate parliament\r\nfrom the control of placemen and pensioners and to break the power of the\r\nborough-owners by the extension of the franchise. The fault of the measure\r\nwas that, contrary to the wishes of Grattan, it perpetuated the exclusion\r\nof Catholics from political rights. The Executive opposed the Bill on the\r\nground that it emanated from Prætorian bands, though the Volunteers\r\nthemselves were held in check by British troops. The whole open and secret\r\ninfluence of the Government was exerted, and the proposals were defeated.\r\nReform was the condition of genuine autonomy. Without it the Legislature\r\nwas clay in the hands of the potter. Though a share of the blame falls to\r\nthe members who saw their influence endangered, the main responsibility\r\nfor its defeat lies with the agents of the British Government. Having\r\ngranted legislative equality, England took care to secure that the Grattan\r\nParliament should possess the shadow but not the substance of power.\r\n\r\nThe next disappointment arose in the sphere not of politics but of\r\ncommerce. It was the wish both of Pitt, the disciple of Adam Smith, and of\r\nGrattan that commercial intercourse between the two countries should be\r\nfacilitated. But the offer to open the English market was accompanied by a\r\nproposal that Ireland should make a definite contribution to Imperial\r\nexpenditure. She already maintained an army of 15,000 men, a fifth of whom\r\nwere at the disposal of the British Government while the rest could be\r\nemployed outside Ireland with the consent of the Dublin Parliament. But\r\nPitt, convinced that free trade with England would stimulate Irish\r\nprosperity, felt justified in demanding a share of the increased revenue\r\nfor the Imperial navy. Grattan disliked the suggestion of anything which\r\ncould be represented as a tribute, and would have preferred voluntary\r\ngrants; but he waived his objection, and Pitt’s scheme, in the form of\r\nresolutions, was approved by the Irish Parliament. At this stage the\r\njealousy of the British commercial classes flamed out, and the scheme, on\r\nemerging from the debates at Westminster, was found to have been radically\r\naltered. As in its final form it curtailed the independence of the Irish\r\nParliament, Grattan strongly opposed it. A scheme which failed to satisfy\r\nEngland and had lost its friends in Ireland was not worth further effort.\r\nPitt had done his best, but had been overborne by the commercial\r\ninterests. When the Irish Parliament later declared its readiness to\r\ndiscuss a commercial treaty, it met with no response.\r\n\r\nPitt was bitterly disappointed by his failure, and lost a good deal of his\r\ninterest in Ireland. He adopted the view of successive Lords-Lieutenant\r\nthat genuine parliamentary reform was incompatible with the supremacy of\r\nthe Executive. “There can, I think, be little doubt,” pronounces Lecky,\r\n“that the prospect of a legislative union was already in his mind, and it\r\nwas probably the real key to much of his subsequent policy.” Dr. Holland\r\nRose quotes a significant letter of Pitt to the Viceroy, Lord Westmorland,\r\nin the autumn of 1792. “The idea of the present fermentation gradually\r\nbringing both parties to think of an Union with this country has long been\r\nin my mind. I hardly dare flatter myself with the hope of its taking\r\nplace; but I believe it, though itself not easy to be accomplished, to be\r\nthe only solution for other and greater difficulties.” Thus the Grattan\r\nParliament never had a fair chance. The dual system could only be worked\r\nby mutual good will, and if one of the partners withheld her aid, the\r\nexperiment was doomed. Pitt was not yet openly hostile; but he allowed his\r\nagents in Dublin to shape their own course. He recognised that the root of\r\nIrish crime was to be found in the tithe system, and suggested in 1786\r\nthat tithes should be commuted; yet when Grattan brought forward proposals\r\nwith this object he allowed the Executive to defeat them.\r\n\r\nPitt’s growing dislike of the system of 1782 was reinforced by the action\r\nof the Irish Parliament in the Regency crisis. When the King became insane\r\nin 1788, the Whigs contended that their patron, the Prince of Wales,\r\nshould automatically exercise the power of the Crown, while Pitt retorted\r\nthat it was for Parliament to appoint him Regent, and to define his\r\npowers. The Irish Parliament sided with the Whigs, Grattan and the\r\nNationalists on the constitutional ground that Pitt’s proposed safeguards\r\nwere unnecessary in Ireland, the camp-followers in view of the probable\r\nchange in the source of patronage. The controversy terminated with the\r\nKing’s restoration to health; but the Prime Minister never forgot nor\r\nforgave the encouragement rendered to his enemies at the crisis of his\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nPitt had attempted nothing for Ireland since the failure of his commercial\r\nproposals; but the ferment created by the seductive doctrines of the\r\nFrench Revolution determined him to conciliate the Catholics, to whom he\r\nhad always been friendly and whom he agreed with Burke in regarding as\r\nnaturally conservative. On being informed of his wishes in 1791 the Irish\r\nGovernment did its utmost to dissuade him, and succeeded in whittling down\r\nthe concessions till they were scarcely worth granting. Though Flood and\r\nCharlemont were immovably opposed to the extension of any kind of\r\npolitical rights to Catholics, and though Grattan always explicitly\r\nreserved Protestant ascendency, there was a large body of opinion prepared\r\nfor a fairly liberal policy; and the new organisation of United Irishmen,\r\nfounded in 1791 by Wolfe Tone, rested on the recognition of a common\r\neffective citizenship. In view of these circumstances, Pitt for the first\r\nand last time determined to overrule his agents. The Relief Bill of 1793\r\nenfranchised Catholics on the same terms as Protestants, admitted them to\r\njuries, to the magistracy, and to commissions in the Army and Navy,\r\nallowed them to receive degrees in Dublin University and to carry arms.\r\nThis generous measure, which the Executive hated but dared not oppose,\r\npassed without difficulty. Though the main merit belongs to Pitt, the\r\nacceptance of such far-reaching concessions by a Protestant body is a\r\nproof that, left to itself, it was not unwilling to concede substantial\r\ninstalments of justice to the Catholic majority. Recent attempts to\r\nminimise the importance of the Act, on the ground that the franchise\r\nwithout eligibility to Parliament was worthless, misjudge the situation.\r\nThe measure was hailed by Catholic opinion as a decisive breach with the\r\nintolerant traditions of a century; and its easy passage to the\r\nStatute-book suggests how different might have been the record and the\r\nfate of the Grattan Parliament had Pitt throughout encouraged its more\r\ngenerous intuitions and compelled his agents to support the policy which\r\nhe knew to be right.\r\n\r\nThe union of the Portland Whigs with Pitt in 1794 seemed to bring further\r\nreforms within sight. Grattan travelled to London to discuss the\r\nsituation, and met Fitzwilliam, who was designed for the Viceroyalty.\r\nFitzwilliam was known to favour Parliamentary Reform and Catholic\r\nEmancipation, and the liveliest hopes and fears were entertained of a\r\ndecisive change of system. On learning from Dublin that there was already\r\nopen talk of the dismissal of the Chancellor and other members of the\r\nAscendency party, Pitt was deeply annoyed. It would be best, he declared,\r\nthat Fitzwilliam should not go to Ireland; and, in any case, he must\r\nunderstand that no idea of a new system could be entertained, and that no\r\nsupporters of the Government should be displaced. Shortly before his\r\ndeparture Pitt and Grenville met Portland, Spencer, Windham and\r\nFitzwilliam to determine the policy to be pursued. No notes were made of\r\nthe conversation, and the Viceroy left England on January 4th, 1795,\r\nwithout written instructions, though well aware of Pitt’s general views\r\nand wishes. Three days after landing he dismissed Beresford, the head of\r\nthe Revenue and an inveterate enemy of Catholic claims, who possessed\r\nenormous borough influence and was often described as the King of Ireland.\r\nFitzwilliam afterwards stated that he told Pitt the step might be\r\nnecessary and that he had acquiesced by his silence. Pitt rejoined that he\r\nhad no recollection of the incident. In any case a man of such importance\r\nshould not have been removed without communicating with the Home\r\nGovernment. A few days later the Viceroy informed Portland, the Home\r\nSecretary, of the unanimity of Catholics and the readiness of Protestants\r\nfor a measure of emancipation. Despite pressing and repeated\r\ncommunications, Portland delayed his reply and finally urged him not to\r\ncommit himself. Next day Pitt wrote censuring the removal of Beresford,\r\nbut without mentioning the Catholic question. Fitzwilliam replied that\r\nPitt must choose between him and Beresford, and informed Portland that he\r\nwould not risk a rebellion by deferring the measure. A week later Portland\r\nwrote in peremptory terms that Grattan’s Bill, which enjoyed the Viceroy’s\r\nsupport, must go no further, and on the following day Fitzwilliam was\r\nrecalled.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroyalty had lasted six weeks; but Fitzwilliam is remembered while\r\nthe phantom rulers who preceded and followed him are forgotten. The\r\nepisode has a narrower and a wider aspect. That his dismissals were in\r\ncontravention of the understanding on which his appointment rested was\r\nadmitted by his personal and political friends in the Cabinet. But though\r\nthe Viceroy was guilty of disloyalty to his instructions, a strong case\r\ncan be made out for his policy. He knew that the prevailing system was\r\nthoroughly vicious, and he realised that if a policy of conciliation and\r\nreform was to be undertaken it could not be effectively carried out by men\r\nwho were opposed to it. As Pitt had explicitly vetoed a change of system,\r\nit would have been wiser to have refused the post. The aims of the two men\r\nwere fundamentally different. Though in favour of admitting Catholics to\r\nParliament, Pitt thought it safer to defer emancipation till a Union was\r\naccomplished, and therefore determined to preserve Government patronage\r\nand control for future emergencies. Fitzwilliam desired to govern Ireland\r\nin accordance with Irish ideas, in the spirit of the Constitution of 1782\r\nand with the help of men who were loyal to it. In his recent work, “The\r\nEnd of the Irish Parliament,” Mr. Fisher, who finds nothing to admire in\r\nthe Grattan Parliament and little in its founder, suggests that the\r\nFitzwilliam crisis was a storm in a tea-cup, and that the main issue\r\ninvolved was the substitution of the Ponsonbys for the Beresfords as the\r\ndispensers of patronage. But Irish tradition is in this case a safe guide\r\nas to the character and importance of the incident. Ireland instinctively\r\nfelt, as India was to feel nearly a century later in regard to Ripon, that\r\nFitzwilliam was a friend. The news of his recall was received with delight\r\nin Ascendency circles, and elsewhere with consternation. It was taken as a\r\ndefinite rejection of the Catholic claims, and increasing numbers\r\ndespaired of achieving any real reform by peaceful means. It revealed in a\r\nflash that the autonomy of Ireland was a sham. From this point the\r\nrebellion of 1798 and the Union were in sight.\r\n\r\nThe new Viceroy, Camden, was an anæmic personality, and with the\r\nestablishment of Maynooth the tale of reforms came to an end. The\r\nuncrowned king of Ireland and the brain of Dublin Castle was Fitzgibbon,\r\nwho as Attorney-General stood by Pitt in the Regency crisis and had been\r\nrewarded by the Chancellorship and the earldom of Clare. In his\r\ndiscriminating study of Clare, the late Litton Falkiner has advanced all\r\nthat can be said for the ablest and most ruthless of the opponents of the\r\nGrattan Parliament, pointing out that he remained on friendly terms with\r\nthe Opposition till 1789. Wholly destitute of national feeling, Clare\r\nopenly scoffed at the Catholic Relief Act of 1793, which the Government\r\nwas compelled to support. It was from him that emanated in 1795 the fatal\r\nsuggestion that the King could not assent to the repeal of laws affecting\r\nIrish Catholics without violating his Coronation oath. “In forcefulness\r\nand narrowness, in bravery and bigotry,” writes Dr. Holland Rose with\r\nentire truth, “he was a fit spokesman of the British garrison, which was\r\nresolved to hold every outwork of the citadel.” With Pitt’s glance fixed\r\non Union and Clare in virtual command of the machine, there was no place\r\nfor Grattan in his own Parliament. He disapproved the revolutionary\r\nrepublicanism of the United Irishmen and the ascendency principles of\r\nDublin Castle, and refused to encourage the one by attacking the other.\r\nAfter a final attempt in 1797 to procure the admission of Catholics to\r\nParliament and to introduce household franchise, he retired into private\r\nlife, his Letter to the Citizens of Dublin firing a parting shot at the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion of 1798 and the French invasions form no integral part of\r\nthe history of the Grattan Parliament; but they none the less sealed its\r\ndoom. In his speech on the Union, Clare frankly confessed that he had been\r\nworking for the Union since 1793, and he began to urge the policy on Pitt\r\nin the same year. Pitt, who had long regarded a Union followed by Catholic\r\nEmancipation as the ultimate solution of the Irish problem, was now\r\nconvinced that further delay was dangerous. In the early part of the\r\neighteenth century the idea of Union was by no means unpopular; but the\r\nAmerican war had shaken Ireland from her slumbers, and the debates on the\r\nCommercial Propositions and the Regency showed that the Grattan Parliament\r\nwas jealous of the slightest infringement of the settlement of 1782. But\r\nthe matter was not to be settled by argument, and no dissolution was\r\nallowed. The high-minded Cornwallis, who had succeeded Camden, groaned\r\nover his hateful task. “My occupation is most unpleasant, negotiating and\r\njobbing with the most corrupt people under heaven. How I long to kick\r\nthose whom my public duty obliges me to court! I despise and hate myself\r\nevery hour for engaging in such dirty work, and am supported only by the\r\nreflection that without an Union the British Empire must be dissolved.”\r\nThere was no national opposition to the measure. The Catholics were won by\r\nthe promises of Emancipation, though they were not informed that the King\r\nhad already declared his objections to it insuperable. The main fight was\r\nwaged by the Ulster Protestants from whom had sprung the Volunteers. When\r\nthe Irish Parliament met for the last time in January, 1800, a majority\r\nhad been secured by Cornwallis, Castlereagh, and Clare. Grattan had sought\r\nre-election and returned to utter an eloquent protest against the\r\ndestruction of the body that for ever bears his name. He predicted that\r\nthe Union would be one of Parliaments, not of peoples. To destroy the\r\nParliament was to destroy an organ of national intelligence, a source and\r\nsymbol of national life. “The thing it is proposed to buy is what cannot\r\nbe sold—liberty.” He reiterated his conviction that nature was on the side\r\nof autonomy. “Ireland hears the ocean protesting against separation, but\r\nshe hears the sea likewise protesting against Union.” The warnings of the\r\nmost spotless of Irish patriots were of no avail. The Grattan Parliament\r\nwas swallowed up. In his touching words, he watched by its cradle and\r\nfollowed its hearse.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal to be said for the assertion that after the rebellion\r\nof 1798 the continuance of the experiment of 1782 was a source of danger\r\nto Great Britain in her life and death struggle with France. But there is\r\nno ground for the contention that the constitution itself was\r\nintrinsically unworkable. Its congenital weakness was that the Executive\r\nwas responsible not to the Irish but to the British Parliament. Friction\r\nbetween the Legislature and the Executive was thus inevitable; but with\r\ntact and goodwill even this anomaly need not have stopped the working of\r\nthe machine. What would have happened had the British Ministry unselfishly\r\nco-operated with Grattan and the moderate Nationalists to secure urgent\r\npolitical and economic reforms we can but conjecture. But we know only too\r\nwell the effect of withholding such co-operation. There is scarcely a\r\ntrace in the voluminous correspondence of the Viceroys, except perhaps the\r\nDuke of Rutland, of any consideration for the good of the country over\r\nwhich they ruled. Their mandate was to watch the interest of England. When\r\nCornwallis proposed in 1798 that Castlereagh should become Chief\r\nSecretary, the King objected that the post ought to be held by a Briton;\r\nbut his scruples were allayed by the Viceroy’s assurance that his\r\ncandidate was “so very unlike an Irishman” that the appointment would be\r\nperfectly safe. There is no ground whatever for the notion that the\r\nParliament was a wholly corrupt and reactionary body. That Grattan was not\r\nprepared to endanger the Protestant Ascendency is true but irrelevant; for\r\nhe was ready to champion such measures of Parliamentary Reform and\r\nCatholic Emancipation as would have transformed Parliament into a\r\ntolerable mirror of Irish opinion. There can be little doubt that if the\r\nExecutive had lent its aid, such measures could have been carried as\r\neasily as the Relief Bill of 1793.\r\n\r\nIn his thoughtful and eloquent volume, “The Framework of Home Rule,” Mr.\r\nErskine Childers gently chides Home Rulers for wasting vain regrets on the\r\nGrattan Parliament, in which he loses interest after the rejection of\r\nFlood’s Reform Bill of 1783. No instructed Home Ruler would dream of\r\nsetting that celebrated body on a pedestal. We know too well that, in the\r\nwords of Litton Falkiner, it was a parliament of landlords, of placemen,\r\nand of Protestants. It was fundamentally conservative and aristocratic. It\r\nwas ever ready to pass Coercion Acts. It was no more a council of\r\ndisinterested patriots than the sister assembly at Westminster. On the\r\nother hand a large and influential section of its members was eager to\r\npurge it of its baser elements. “With every inducement to religious\r\nbigotry, it carried the policy of toleration in many respects further than\r\nthe Parliament of England. With many inducements to disloyalty, it was\r\nsteadily faithful to the connection. Nor should it be forgotten that it\r\nwas on the whole a vigilant and intelligent guardian of the material\r\ninterests of the country.”(147) Though cabin’d, cribbed, confined, it was\r\nat least in some degree an organ of public opinion and a symbol of\r\nnationality, as the Third Duma, tame though it be, has stood for the\r\nprinciple of representation in autocratic Russia. The duty of British\r\nstatesmen was to mend it, not to end it. If Grattan’s Parliament was a\r\nfailure, the Union was a greater failure. For the one experiment\r\nrecognised, however imperfectly, the separateness of Ireland, while the\r\nother started from its denial. To use the jargon of the Ascendency party,\r\nIreland was “loyal” before the Union and “disloyal” after it. The clear\r\nmoral of those chequered years for latter-day statesmen is that a\r\nresponsible Executive is of more importance than a co-equal legislature,\r\nand that having granted autonomy the British Parliament and British\r\nMinisters must strive to render it a success. Pitt’s Union was not\r\npartnership but subjection. The only true Union between countries so\r\ndifferent is to be found in loyal comradeship. Against such a relationship\r\nhistory cannot bear witness, for it has never been tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.—“The Government Of Ireland In The Nineteenth Century”. BY R. BARRY\r\nO’BRIEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you speak to Englishmen about English rule in Ireland they say: “Oh!\r\nyou Irish are always looking back. You always want to talk about the past.\r\nYou read nothing but ancient history. You never think of all we have done\r\nfor you in recent years. Come to modern times; forget the past.”\r\n\r\nWell, the point is, what are modern times? What date are we to fix for the\r\nbeginning of good government in Ireland—1800? Scarcely. I do not think\r\nthat the rankest Tory that ever lived will now attempt to defend English\r\nrule in Ireland between 1800 and 1828. In fact, this is what they call\r\nancient history. They will say to you: “Well, of course, we know that the\r\nCatholics ought to have been emancipated at the Union, and a great many\r\nother things ought to have been done! But what is the good of talking\r\nabout that now?” The good is, that the lessons of the past are the\r\nsafeguards of the future. Hence they must be learned.\r\n\r\n“Progress,” says Lamennais, “is in a straight line. To find it we must go\r\nback to the past.” Let us take the line of “progress” in Ireland\r\nthroughout the nineteenth century. In 1800 the Irish Parliament was\r\ndestroyed; the English Parliament took Ireland in hand. A new era was to\r\ndawn upon the country. The Catholics were to be emancipated, measures of\r\nsocial and political amelioration were to be passed, peace and prosperity\r\nwere to reign in the land. Such was the promise of the Union. How was it\r\nfulfilled? The Catholics were not emancipated; measures of social\r\namelioration were not carried; but the Statute book was filled with\r\nCoercion Acts passed to crush the efforts of the people in their struggle\r\nfor justice and freedom.\r\n\r\nA chronology of Ireland lies before me. Such entries as these meet the eye\r\nat every turn.\r\n\r\n1800-1801. Insurrection Act, Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, and Martial\r\n            Law.\r\n1803.      Insurrection Act.\r\n1804.      Habeas Corpus Suspension Act.\r\n1807-1810. Insurrection Act, Martial Law and Habeas Corpus Suspension Act.\r\n1814.      Habeas Corpus Suspension Act.\r\n1814-1818. Insurrection Act.\r\n1822-1824. Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, Insurrection Act.\r\n1825-1828. Act for Suppression of Catholic Association.\r\n\r\nNothing can give a better idea of the character of English Government in\r\nIreland during the first quarter of the century than the mere recital of\r\nthese Acts. And then when we look at the Statute book for the measures\r\npassed to ameliorate the condition of the people, to reconcile them to the\r\nloss of their Parliament, and to give them confidence in the English\r\nLegislature, what do we find? At the General Election of 1910, a pamphlet\r\nwas published in the county——. It bore the title—“What Mr. M—— has done\r\nfor the people of ——” You then turned over the leaves and found every page\r\na blank. So is it with the English Statute book, during the years\r\n1800-1829, as far as measures of justice for Ireland are concerned. Out of\r\na total population of 5,000,000 people at the time of the Union, 4,000,000\r\nwere Catholics. These Catholics, representing the old Irish race, were\r\ntreated as outlanders in their own country. Ireland was governed through\r\nthe Protestant minority who, (themselves the descendants of English\r\nsettlers), were, under England, the masters of the land. In 1798,\r\nCornwallis had written to Pitt:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It has always appeared to me a desperate measure for the British\r\n    Government to make an irrevocable alliance with a small party in\r\n    Ireland (which party has derived all its consequence from, and is,\r\n    in fact, entirely dependent upon the British Government), and to\r\n    wage eternal war against the Papists.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “desperate measure” which Cornwallis deplored, the British Government\r\nadopted. In 1802, Lord Redesdale, the Irish Lord Chancellor of the day,\r\nwrote: “The Catholics must have no more political power”; and he added: “I\r\nhave said that this country must be kept for some time as a garrison\r\ncountry—I meant a Protestant garrison.” The policy enunciated by Lord\r\nRedesdale was the policy enforced by the English statesmen of the Union. I\r\nthink it is Lord Acton who says somewhere that nothing stimulates the\r\nsentiment of nationality so much as the presence of a foreign ruler. The\r\nIrish people saw the hand of the foreign ruler everywhere, and national\r\nhatred was naturally intensified and perpetuated.\r\n\r\nBesides the question of Catholic emancipation—the question of political\r\nfreedom—there were many other questions calling for the immediate\r\nattention of Parliament. There was the church question, the tithe\r\nquestion, the question of the education of the people, and the eternal\r\nland question. The very existence of these questions was ignored by\r\nEnglish statesmen. Land was the staple industry of Ireland; yet it was\r\nworked under conditions which were fatal to the peace and prosperity of\r\nthe country. What were the conditions? The landlord let the land—perhaps a\r\nstrip of bog, barren, wild, dreary. The tenant reclaimed the bog; built,\r\nfenced, drained, did all that had to be done. When the tenant had done\r\nthese things, had made the land tenantable, the rent was raised. He could\r\nnot pay the increased rental—he had spent himself on the land; he needed\r\ntime to recoup himself for his outlay and labour. He got no time: when he\r\nfailed to pay, he was evicted—flung on the roadside, to starve, to die. He\r\ntook refuge in an Agrarian Secret Society, told the story of his wrong,\r\nand prayed for vengeance on the man whom he called a tyrant, and an\r\noppressor. Too often his prayer was heard, and vengeance was wreaked on\r\nthe landlord, or agent, and sometimes on both.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The landlord,” says Mr. Froude, “may become a direct oppressor.\r\n    He may care nothing for the people, and have no object but to\r\n    squeeze the most that he can out of them fairly or unfairly. The\r\n    Russian Government has been called despotism, tempered by\r\n    assassination. In Ireland landlordism was tempered by\r\n    assassination.... Every circumstance combined in that country to\r\n    exasperate the relations between landlord and tenant. The\r\n    landlords were, for the most part, aliens in blood and in\r\n    religion. They represented conquest and confiscation, and they had\r\n    gone on from generation to generation with an indifference for the\r\n    welfare of the people which would not have been tolerated in\r\n    England or Scotland.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish statesmen did not understand—did not try to understand—the Irish\r\nland question. They believed that force was the best—the only—remedy for\r\nagrarian disorders. They did not grasp the essential fact that rack-rents,\r\ninsecurity of tenure, and the confiscation of the tenants’ improvements by\r\nthe landlords, lay at the root of the trouble, and that legislation to\r\nprotect the tenant from injustice and oppression was the cure. The result\r\nwas that the staple industry of the country was paralysed, and periodical\r\nfamines, and constant outbursts of lawlessness and crime, almost\r\nthreatened the very existence of society. No stronger argument can be used\r\nto prove the incompetence of Englishmen to rule Ireland, than the\r\nignorance and incapacity shown by English statesmen throughout the\r\nnineteenth century, in dealing, or rather in refusing to deal, with this\r\nvital question of the land.\r\n\r\nEnglish statesmen saw nothing wrong in the exclusive establishment and\r\nendowment of the Church of the Protestant minority in a Catholic country,\r\nnor did they see just cause for complaint because Catholic peasants were\r\nforced, at the point of the bayonet, to pay tithes to Protestant parsons.\r\nProtestant education was assisted by the State. Nothing was done by the\r\nGovernment for the education of Catholics. Thus for the first twenty-eight\r\nyears of the century the policy of the English in Ireland was calculated\r\nto embitter religious feelings, and to inflame national animosities. When\r\nCatholic emancipation (granted under the pressure of a great revolutionary\r\nagitation) came in 1829 it did not improve the situation because the\r\npeople saw in it, not the measure of England’s justice, but the measure of\r\nher fears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nAll, then, that happened, between 1800 and 1829, served only to make the\r\nchasm which separated the two countries, deeper and wider. What happened\r\nbetween 1829 and 1835? I turn once more to my chronology:\r\n\r\n1830.      Arms Act.\r\n1831-1832. Stanley’s Arms Act.\r\n1833-1834. Grey’s Coercion Act.\r\n1834-1835. Grey’s Coercion (Continuance) Act amended.\r\n\r\nIreland remained as disaffected and disturbed as ever. Why? Because\r\nCatholic Emancipation (delayed for twenty-nine years), was, when carried,\r\npractically made a dead letter; the country was still governed, through\r\nthe Protestant minority, in opposition to the opinions and feelings of the\r\nmasses of the people; while the incompetence of Parliament to deal with\r\nthe tithe question, and the land question, led to an agrarian and tithe\r\nwar, which the Coercion Acts were powerless to stop. In 1831, indeed,\r\nParliament had established the “national” schools, but the scheme was not\r\nwhat the people wanted. Protestants and Catholics alike desired\r\ndenominational education, but the Government gave them a mixed system. For\r\nmany years the system was worked (by a board consisting of five\r\nProtestants and two Catholics in a country where Catholics were to\r\nProtestants as four to one) in an anti-Irish spirit, and it failed,\r\naccordingly, to win popular support or confidence. In truth, the people\r\nsaw in the “national” schools only institutions for anglicising the\r\ncountry. A Scotch Presbyterian practically managed the system. The books,\r\nwith one exception, were prepared by Englishmen or Scotchmen. Irish\r\nhistory and national poetry were boycotted. Patriotic songs were\r\nsuppressed. The limit of folly and absurdity was reached when Scott’s\r\n“Breathes there a man” was replaced in one of the books by these lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I thank the goodness and the grace\r\n      That on my birth have smiled,\r\n    And made me in these Christian days\r\n      A happy English Child.”(148)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1832 a worthless Irish Reform Act, under which the representation of\r\nthe country became “virtually extinguished,”(149) was passed against the\r\nprotest of the Irish members, all of whose amendments, aiming at making it\r\na genuine measure for the extension of the franchise, were contemptuously\r\nrejected. Ignorance and prejudice, the absence of all sense of justice, an\r\nutter inability to understand the Irish case, a determination to trample\r\non popular rights and to disregard public opinion—these were the\r\ncharacteristics of English statesmanship in Ireland between 1829 and 1835.\r\nMr. Lecky’s account of the manner in which Catholic Emancipation was\r\ncarried out is worth quoting:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In 1833—four years after Emancipation—there was not in Ireland a\r\n    single Catholic judge or stipendiary magistrate. All the high\r\n    sheriffs, the overwhelming majority of the unpaid magistrates and\r\n    of the grand jurors, the five inspectors-general, and the\r\n    thirty-two sub-inspectors of the police, were Protestants. The\r\n    chief towns were in the hands of narrow, corrupt, and for the most\r\n    part, intensely bigoted, corporations. For many years promotion\r\n    had been steadily withheld from those who advocated Catholic\r\n    Emancipation, and the majority of the people thus found their\r\n    bitterest enemies in the foremost places.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo wonder that, Lord Melbourne, in coming into office thirty-five years\r\nafter the Union, should have found Ireland still a centre of disaffection\r\nand disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Melbourne Ministry was kept in office from 1835 to 1841 by the Irish\r\nVote. O’Connell made a compact—the historic Lichfield House compact—with\r\nMinisters. It came to this: They were to introduce remedial measures for\r\nIreland, and he was, meanwhile, to suspend the demand for repeal of the\r\nUnion. He said to the Irish people:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I am trying an experiment, I want to see if an English Parliament\r\n    can do justice to Ireland. I do not think it can, but I mean to\r\n    give the present Government a chance, and see what they can do.\r\n    And I will suspend the demand for repeal to give them a fair\r\n    trial.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat came of that “fair trial” we shall now see.\r\n\r\nThe tithe question was the question of the hour. A tithe war had been\r\nraging, between 1830 and 1835, distracting the country, and forcing the\r\nattention of Parliament to Irish affairs. On March 20th, 1835, the\r\nGovernment of Sir Robert Peel took up the question, and Sir Henry\r\nHardinge, the English Chief Secretary in Ireland, moved a resolution to\r\nconvert tithes into a rent charge at 75 per cent. of the tithe. O’Connell,\r\nin dealing with Hardinge’s resolution, said that no measure relating to\r\ntithes would be satisfactory which did not contain a clause appropriating\r\nthe surplus revenues of the established church to purposes of general\r\nutility. Subsequently (on April 7th), Lord John Russell moved:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “That it is the opinion of this House that no measure upon the\r\n    subject of tithes in Ireland can lead to a satisfactory adjustment\r\n    which does not embody the principle of appropriation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis resolution was carried by a majority of twenty-seven. Whereupon the\r\nGovernment of Sir Robert Peel resigned, and Lord Melbourne became Prime\r\nMinister, with Lord John Russell as leader of the House of Commons. What\r\nwas the upshot of the Parliamentary struggle, lasting for three years,\r\nover the tithe question? Simply this. In 1838 an Act was passed,\r\nconverting tithe into a rent charge of 75 per cent. of the tithe, and\r\ncontaining no appropriation clause. Peel had proposed a Bill of the very\r\nsame kind in 1835. Russell objected to it, insisting on the necessity of\r\nan appropriation clause, and proposing the conversion of tithes into a\r\nrent charge of 68% of the tithe. Successful (by the Irish vote) in the\r\nCommons, but defeated in the Lords, he ultimately abandoned his conversion\r\nscheme, flung the appropriation clause to the winds, and passed what was\r\nreally Peel’s measure of 1835. Of course tithes were not abolished. The\r\npayment of them was, in the first instance, transferred from the tenants\r\nto the landlords, then the landlords added the tithes to the rent, so that\r\nthe unfortunate tenants were still mulcted in one way, if not in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, also, the Irish Poor Law was introduced under circumstances\r\nthoroughly characteristic of English methods in Ireland: In 1833, a Royal\r\nCommission was appointed to consider the subject of Irish destitution in\r\nreference to the advisability of establishing “workhouses” to alleviate\r\nIrish distress. The Commission consisted chiefly of Irishmen, though the\r\nChairman, Archbishop Whateley, was an Englishman. The Commissioners took\r\nthree years to consider the subject submitted to them; and, at the end of\r\nthat time, made a report which, in the light of subsequent events, must be\r\npronounced a statesmanlike document. They said, in effect, that the cure\r\nfor Irish distress was work, not workhouses. The labouring poor were\r\nable-bodied men who only needed employment, and scope for their energies;\r\nand should be provided with work which would develop the resources of the\r\ncountry, and remove the causes of poverty. A Vice-regal Poor Law Reform\r\nCommission, which reported in 1906, refers to the Report of the\r\nCommissioners of 1833, in the following language:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It will probably surprise most of those who study the condition\r\n    of Ireland, and who have considered how to improve it, to find\r\n    that a Commission that sat seventy years ago recommended land\r\n    drainage and reclamation on modern lines, the provision of\r\n    labourers’ cottages and allotments, the bringing of agricultural\r\n    instruction to the doors of the peasant, the improvement of land\r\n    tenure, the transfer of fixed powers from grand juries to county\r\n    boards, the employment of direct labour on roads by such county\r\n    boards, the sending of vagrants to colonies to be employed there\r\n    or to penitentiaries in this country; the closing of public-houses\r\n    on Sundays, and the prevention of the sale of groceries and\r\n    intoxicating drink in the same house for consumption on the\r\n    premises. Such were the recommendations of the Royal Commission of\r\n    Inquiry into the Condition of the Poorer Classes.”(150)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the sick and impotent poor the Royal Commission reported practically\r\nthat relief ought to be afforded by voluntary associations, controlled by\r\nState Commissioners, and whose revenues might be strengthened by the\r\nimposition of a contributory parochial rate. Emigration, as a temporary\r\nexpedient, was also recommended in certain cases.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Royal Commissioners was laid before Lord John Russell.\r\nLord John Russell flung the Report into the ministerial waste paper\r\nbasket, and despatched a young Englishman named Nicholls, a member of the\r\nEnglish Poor Law Commission, to report afresh on the subject. Mr. Nicholls\r\npaid a roving visit to Ireland. The Royal Commission had taken three years\r\nto consider the question. Mr. Nicholls disposed of it in six weeks. He, of\r\ncourse, made the report that was expected of him. He recommended the\r\nestablishment of workhouses. The Government brought in a Workhouse Bill,\r\nwhich was opposed by the Irish Members in committee, and on the third\r\nreading, but was carried, nevertheless, by overwhelming majorities.(151)\r\n\r\nIn concluding this story let me quote the following brief extracts from\r\nthe Vice-regal Commission of 1903-6:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I. The poverty of Ireland cannot be adequately dealt with by any\r\n    Poor Relief Law, such as that of 1838, but by the development of\r\n    the country’s resources, which is, therefore, most strongly urged.\r\n\r\n                  ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\n    “III. The present workhouse system should be abolished.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, after the lapse of three-quarters of a century, has the policy of\r\nthe Irish Commission of 1833 been vindicated, and the policy of the\r\nEnglish Parliament condemned.\r\n\r\nThe Government also took up the question of municipal reform. There were\r\nat the time sixty-eight municipalities in Ireland, all in the hands of the\r\nProtestant ascendency. It was the policy of O’Connell to preserve all\r\nthese municipalities and to reform them. The Government tried to carry out\r\nhis policy, but in vain. Then, in 1836, they carried through the House of\r\nCommons, a Bill creating a £10 household suffrage in seven of the largest\r\ncities, and a £5 one in the others, but the measure was rejected in the\r\nHouse of Lords which desired the abolition of the Irish municipalities\r\naltogether. In 1837 the Bill was again passed through the Commons, and\r\nagain rejected by the Lords. Peel then proposed, as a compromise—a £10\r\nrating franchise in twelve of the largest towns, and a similar franchise\r\nin the smaller, provided the Lord Lieutenant allowed them to be\r\nre-incorporated. Lord John Russell consented to this proposal on\r\nconditions that the franchise in the small towns—corporations _in\r\nposse_—should be reduced to £5. For two years longer a struggle was\r\ncarried on between the two parties, mainly over the question of the\r\nfranchise in the smaller towns (in the event of their being incorporated).\r\nFinally, in 1840, the Government gave way all along the line, passing an\r\nAct which abolished fifty-eight municipalities, and conferred a £10\r\nfranchise on the remaining ten.\r\n\r\nThe Melbourne Ministry fell in 1841. O’Connell had kept the Government in\r\noffice for five years. During that time they had passed useful measures\r\nfor England; but in their Irish legislation they failed utterly. The Tithe\r\nAct was a sham, the Poor Law, passed in the teeth of Irish Opposition, was\r\ndetested in Ireland, and the Municipal Reform Act has well been described\r\nby Sir Erskine May “as virtually a scheme of municipal disfranchisement.”\r\nWhen all was over, O’Connell said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The experiment which I have tried has proved that an English\r\n    Parliament cannot do justice to Ireland, and our only hope now is\r\n    in the Repeal of the Union.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then unfurled the banner of repeal, and threw himself heart and soul\r\ninto the movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Melbourne Ministry failed utterly in their Irish legislation,\r\nthe administration of the country by Thomas Drummond (Under-Secretary at\r\nDublin Castle, 1835-1840) was eminently successful. Though there were\r\nCoercion Acts on the Statute book they were not enforced. Drummond\r\ngoverned according to the ordinary law, and, by meting out even-handed\r\njustice to all, won popular support and confidence. However, on the fall\r\nof the Ministry, coercion again soon became the order of the day—thus:\r\n\r\n1843-1845. Arms Act.\r\n1847.      Crime and Outrage Act.\r\n1848-1849. Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, Crime and Outrage Act, Removal of\r\n            Aliens Act.\r\n\r\nBetween 1842 and 1845 Ireland rang with the demand for repeal. Great\r\nmeetings—monster meetings they were called—were held everywhere; and\r\nO’Connell, by a series of the most eloquent and vehement speeches ever\r\naddressed to public audiences, re-awakened the spirit of nationality and\r\nintensified the popular hatred of England. In the days of the Melbourne\r\nMinistry his policy was a policy of peace; but the English people would\r\nnot accept the olive branch. His policy now was a policy of war. His case\r\nfor repeal rested on two main propositions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “(1) Ireland was fit for legislative independence in position,\r\n    population, and natural advantages. Five independent kingdoms in\r\n    Europe possessed less territory or people; and her station in the\r\n    Atlantic, between the old world and the new, designed her to be\r\n    the _entrepôt_ of both, if the watchful jealousy of England had\r\n    not rendered her natural advantages nugatory.\r\n\r\n    “(2) She was entitled to legislative independence; the Parliament\r\n    of Ireland was as ancient as the Parliament of England, and had\r\n    not derived its existence from any Charter of the British Crown,\r\n    but sprang out of the natural rights of freedom. Its independence,\r\n    long claimed, was finally recognised and confirmed by solemn\r\n    compact between the two nations in 1782; that compact has since\r\n    been shamefully violated, indeed, but no statute of limitation ran\r\n    against the right of a nation.”(152)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government of Sir Robert Peel put forth its full strength to crush\r\nO’Connell, and the repeal movement. In 1844 O’Connell was tried by a\r\npacked bench and a packed jury for seditious conspiracy, found guilty, and\r\nsent to jail. His trial was one of the most scandalous incidents in the\r\nhistory of British rule in Ireland, during the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The most eminent Catholic in the Empire,” says Sir Charles Gavan\r\n    Duffy, “a man whose name was familiar to every Catholic in the\r\n    world, was placed upon his trial in the Catholic Metropolis of a\r\n    Catholic country before four judges and twelve jurors, among whom\r\n    there was not a single Catholic.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the condemnation of O’Connell by this tribunal was\r\ntoo much even for the House of Lords, which quashed the conviction and set\r\nO’Connell free.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 O’Connell died, and a terrible famine swept over the land\r\ndecimating the people. Before the famine the population of Ireland was\r\n8,175,124, three years afterwards it had sunk to 6,574,278. But that was\r\nnot the end. The “Young Ireland” party had sprung out of the repeal\r\nmovement. The “Young Irelanders” began as constitutional agitators. Like\r\nO’Connell himself they simply demanded the repeal of the Union. But they\r\ngradually became more extreme, and, ultimately, under the influence of the\r\nwave of revolution, which swept over Europe in 1848, drifted into\r\ninsurrection. The rising of 1848 was quickly put down, and the “Young\r\nIreland” leaders were banished beyond the seas. All seemed lost. Ireland\r\nwas in despair. Yet the seed, sown by O’Connell and the “Young\r\nIrelanders,” took root. The fruit was gathered in our own day. Home Rule\r\nsprang out of the one movement, and Fenianism out of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The spirit of National Independence,” says Mr. Froude, “is like a\r\n    fire, so long as a spark remains a conflagration can be kindled.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fire of nationality burned low during the Melbourne Administration;\r\nbut rekindled by O’Connell in 1842, and fanned into flame by “Young\r\nIreland,” it was not put out by the misfortunes and disasters in which the\r\nfirst forty-eight years of the Union closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that land was the staple industry of Ireland. Yet Government\r\nafter Government failed to realize that the enactment of laws for the\r\nprotection of the tenant—the protection of his improvements from\r\nconfiscation by the landlords, protection of himself from rack-rents and\r\narbitrary eviction—were necessary for the prosperity and peace of the\r\ncountry. In 1836 Mr. Sharman Crawford introduced a Bill proposing that the\r\ntenant should be entitled, on eviction, to compensation for improvements\r\nof a permanent nature made with the landlord’s consent; or without his\r\nconsent, provided that such improvements were, according to the Chairman\r\nof Quarter Sessions, necessary for the actual wants of the tenant. This\r\nmoderate Bill, strongly opposed by the landlords, was read a first time,\r\nbut it never reached another stage. Parliament having refused to protect\r\nthe tenants—refused indeed to take the slightest heed of their complaints\r\nand grievances—the tenants continued to protect themselves by forming\r\nsecret societies whose operations struck terror in the land. In 1838 the\r\nUnder-Secretary, Thomas Drummond, boldly told the Tipperary Magistrates,\r\nwho cried out for coercion, that landlordism was the cause of agrarian\r\ncrime, and that remedial legislation, not coercion, was the remedy. He\r\nsaid, in memorable words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Government has been at all times ready to afford the utmost\r\n    aid in its power to suppress disturbance and crime, and its\r\n    efforts have been successful so far as regards open violations of\r\n    the law.... But there are certain classes of crime, originating in\r\n    other causes which are much more difficult of repression. The\r\n    utmost exertion of vigilance and precaution cannot always\r\n    effectually guard against them, and it becomes of importance to\r\n    consider the causes which have led to a state of society so much\r\n    to be deplored, with a view to ascertain whether any corrective\r\n    means are in the immediate power of the Government or the\r\n    Legislature. When,” he continues, “the character of the great\r\n    majority of serious outrages occurring in many parts of Ireland,\r\n    though unhappily most frequent in Tipperary, is considered, it is\r\n    impossible to doubt that the causes from which they mainly spring\r\n    are connected with the tenure and occupation of land.\r\n\r\n    “Property,” he adds, “has its duties as well as its rights; to the\r\n    neglect of those duties in times past is mainly to be ascribed to\r\n    that diseased state of society in which such crimes take their\r\n    rise; and it is not in the enactment or enforcement of statutes of\r\n    extraordinary severity, but chiefly in the better and more\r\n    faithful performance of those duties, and the more enlightened and\r\n    humane exercise of those rights that a permanent remedy for such\r\n    disorders is to be sought.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother fierce outburst of agrarianism in 1842 startled English public\r\nopinion, and drew from _The Times_ a memorable condemnation of\r\nlandlordism. The great English journal wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “With feelings of mingled pain we have witnessed the reappearance\r\n    of that frightful system of murder and outrage which has so long\r\n    infested the south of Ireland, and in particular the unhappy\r\n    County of Tipperary.... The evil has arisen in the general system\r\n    upon which the occupation of land has been based and conducted,\r\n    and in the treatment of the occupier by the landlord.... A\r\n    landlord is not a tradesman; he stands to his tenantry, or he\r\n    ought to do so, in _loco parentis_; he is there as well for their\r\n    good as his own; they are not mere contractors with him, to hold\r\n    his land as capital, and pay him the full interest, or incur a\r\n    forfeiture; they are rather agents placed in his hands, and under\r\n    his care and protection, for the purpose of working the land, and\r\n    whose _natural_ relation with him cannot be determined except by\r\n    negligence or ill-conduct.\r\n\r\n    “If the land be treated as money, and tenantry as borrowers,\r\n    people may be sure that the landlord will be an usurer. This is\r\n    _generally_ true, but in Ireland the tenant who is thus treated as\r\n    though he had been an unfettered party to the original agreement,\r\n    has not the shadow of the character of a voluntary contractor. It\r\n    is with him, either to continue in the quarter of an acre which he\r\n    occupies, or to starve. There is no other alternative. Rack-rent\r\n    may be misery, but ejectment is ruin.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length in 1843 Sir Robert Peel appointed the famous Devon Commission to\r\nenquire into the occupation and tenure of land in Ireland. In 1845 the\r\nCommission reported that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “(1) All the improvements in the soil were made by the tenants.\r\n\r\n    “(2) That these improvements were subjected to confiscation, and\r\n    were confiscated by the landlord.\r\n\r\n    “(3) That the outrage system sprang from the ejectment system; and\r\n\r\n    “(4) That it was necessary for Parliament to intervene to compel\r\n    the landlord to recoup the tenant on eviction for his outlay on\r\n    the land.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Devon Commission proved the case of the tenants up to\r\nthe hilt. What was done?\r\n\r\nIn May, 1845, Lord Devon declared in the House of Lords that if a Bill\r\nwere passed giving tenants compensation for improvements made by them in\r\nthe land “it would much strengthen the industry of the people of Ireland.”\r\nIn the same year Lord Stanley, in behalf of the Government, introduced a\r\nBill proposing that tenants should be entitled to compensation, on\r\ndisturbance, for prospective improvements of a permanent nature, made with\r\nthe consent of the landlord; or, without his consent, provided the\r\nimprovements had been effected with the authority and approval of a\r\nCommissioner of Improvements, to be specially appointed for the purpose.\r\nThe functions of the Commissioners were to inspect the lands, and to\r\nexamine and inquire whether they would “bear” improvement; and then, if he\r\nthought well of it, to authorise the works contemplated by the tenant and\r\nto award, in case of eviction, such measure of compensation as was deemed\r\nfair and equitable. This Bill was read a second time, then referred to a\r\nSelect Committee, and abandoned. In 1846 substantially the same Bill was\r\nbrought forward by the Government, and read a first time. Then the\r\nGovernment fell and the Bill disappeared. In 1847, Mr. Sharman Crawford\r\nbrought forward a Bill to extend the Ulster Custom (practically fixity of\r\ntenure and free sale) to the rest of Ireland. The Government—a Liberal\r\nGovernment—took no interest in the subject. Crawford spoke to empty\r\nbenches and the Bill was defeated on the second reading by an overwhelming\r\nmajority. In 1848 Crawford brought forward his Bill again, and it was\r\nagain defeated. In the same year the Government brought forward a Bill\r\nwhich was the same as the Government Bill of 1846. It was read a second\r\ntime, then referred to a Select Committee and heard of no more that\r\nsession. So far Parliament had done nothing to carry out the\r\nrecommendations of the Devon Commission—nothing for the protection of the\r\ntenants. But in 1849 Lord John Russell passed a Bill for the relief of the\r\nlandlords—a Bill giving landlords facilities for selling their encumbered\r\nestates. This measure is well known as “The Encumbered Estates Act.” Let\r\nme quote what Lord Russell of Killowen said about it before the Parnell\r\nCommission:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It is hardly conceivable that a Legislature in which Ireland was\r\n    represented—imperfectly, it is true—that a Legislature purporting\r\n    to deal with Ireland should have so misconceived the position as\r\n    to have passed that Act. For what did it do? It sold the estates\r\n    of the bankrupt landlords to men with capital, who were mainly\r\n    jobbers in land, with the accumulated improvements and interests\r\n    of the tenants, and without the slightest protection against the\r\n    forfeiture and confiscation of these improvements and interests,\r\n    at the hands of the proprietor newly acquiring the estate. It was\r\n    intended, I doubt not, to effect good. It proved a cause of the\r\n    gravest evil.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a mockery of legislation! The Devon Commission had reported in favour\r\nof the tenant’s claims, and recommended the enactment of laws for his\r\nprotection. Parliament passed an Act introducing into Ireland a new set of\r\nlandlords who were worse than the old, and leaving the tenant hopelessly\r\nat their mercy.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the Irish Secretary of the day brought in a Bill (practically the\r\nsame as Lord Stanley’s Bill of 1845) giving the tenant compensation for\r\nimprovements. The Bill was read a second time, committed, and dropped. In\r\nthe same year Sharman Crawford again introduced his “Tenant Right” Bill,\r\nbut it was never read a second time.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1852 (when the Irish Parliamentary Party held the balance\r\nbetween English parties),(153) the Tory Government introduced a Bill\r\ngiving to the tenant compensation for improvements, prospective and\r\nretrospective, made by him in the land. The Bill was read a second time\r\nwithout opposition in December and then referred to a Select Committee.\r\nWhen the Whigs came into office in 1853 they took up the measure which,\r\nsubject to certain alterations, was approved of by the Select Committee.\r\nThe Bill was finally read a second time in the Lords and then dropped for\r\nthe session. It was reintroduced in 1854, and read a second time in the\r\nLords; referred to a Select Committee, condemned by the Committee, and\r\nlost. Between 1854 and 1860 Land Bill after Land Bill was introduced by\r\nthe Irish Parliamentary Party for the purpose of giving compensation to\r\ntenants for improvements, but all were rejected. Finally (in 1860),\r\nimitating the example of 1849, the Whig Government of the day passed a\r\nLand Act in the interests of the landlords. Let me describe this Act in\r\nthe words of Lord Russell of Killowen. “This was an Act passed to help the\r\nlandlords, and not one passed for the protection of the tenants. It turned\r\nthe relation between landlord and tenant from relation by tenure into\r\nrelation by contract;(154) it gave certain facilities in the matter of\r\nproceedings in ejectment; it recognized and formulated what had been an\r\nexisting law in Ireland—going back for a long period—a state of law\r\nunknown in this country. I mean the right of ejectment, pure and simple,\r\nfor non-payment of rent.” The recommendations of the Devon Commission were\r\nnot only not carried out but were absolutely ignored. Happily however the\r\nAct proved a dead letter. “This enactment,” said the Bessborough\r\nCommission of 1881, “has produced little or no effect. It may be said to\r\nhave given utterance to the wishes of the Legislature, that the\r\ntraditional rights of tenants should cease to exist, rather than to have\r\nseriously affected the conditions of their existence.” It was in reference\r\nto the Encumbered Estates Act, and this Act, that Mr. Gladstone once\r\nexclaimed in the House of Commons: “In our very remedies we have failed.”\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the Government brought in a Bill to amend the Act of 1860 in the\r\ninterest of the tenants, but it never became law. The Bill was again\r\nbrought forward in 1867 and again lost. While every Land Act in the\r\ninterest of the tenant between 1849 and 1867 was rejected, the Statute\r\nbook continued to be filled with Coercion Acts. Thus:\r\n\r\n1850-1855.  Crime and Outrage (Continuance) Act.\r\n1856, 1857. Peace Preservation Act.\r\n1858-1864.  Peace Preservation (Continuance) Act.\r\n1865.       Peace Preservation (Continuance) Act.\r\n1866-1869 (off and on). Habeas Corpus Suspension Act.\r\n\r\nAs Parliament treated the land question, so it treated the church\r\nquestion, and every question in which the Irish people were interested.\r\nTheir complaints, as Bright said, “were met with denial, with contempt,\r\nwith insult.” Ministers, indeed, slumbered peacefully as if there were no\r\nIrish question, until they were rudely awakened in 1867 by the ringing of\r\nthe “Chapel bell.” Fenianism—a Society founded to sever the connection\r\nbetween England and Ireland—brought Liberals and Tories to their bearings;\r\nand under the pressure of that great revolutionary organization (which set\r\nIreland in a blaze), the Church was disestablished in 1869, and the first\r\nLand Act (which in the slightest degree served the interests of the\r\ntenants) passed in 1870. This Act provided that tenants, when evicted,\r\nshould receive compensation for improvements, and in certain cases, for\r\ndisturbance. It also contained clauses for the creation of a peasant\r\nproprietary, and recognized and legalized the Ulster custom of tenant\r\nright. But the Act was a failure. The peasant proprietary clauses did not\r\nwork; rack-renting continued, evictions increased, and the general\r\ndiscontent remained the same as ever. In these circumstances the Irish\r\nmembers demanded fresh legislation, and introduced several Bills for this\r\npurpose between 1876 and 1881. They were all rejected by overwhelming\r\nmajorities. Then the Land League came; lawlessness and outrage came;\r\ntreason and anarchy came; and the Land Act of 1881 was passed in a storm\r\nof revolution. The reasons given by Lord Salisbury for not opposing the\r\nBill in the House of Lords are too remarkable, and too little known not to\r\nbe quoted. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In view of the prevailing agitation, and having regard to the\r\n    state of anarchy (in Ireland), I cannot recommend my followers to\r\n    vote against the second reading of the Bill.”\r\n\r\n\r\nand in the same speech he added:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “What will be the attitude of the tenant all this time? He, like\r\n    the landlord, will be looking to the future, but in a very\r\n    different temper. He knows perfectly well that all he has hitherto\r\n    got he has not got because he has moved your convictions, but\r\n    because he has moved your fears.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“The pivot of the Act of 1881,” to use the language of Mr. Forster, was\r\nthe “Land Court” established to stand between landlords and tenants, to\r\nfix fair or judicial rents. Previously, the landlord was master of the\r\nsituation. The competition for land placed the tenant at his mercy, and he\r\naccordingly fixed the rent at his own pleasure. But henceforth rents were\r\nto be fixed by legal tribunals; and while the tenant paid the rent so\r\nfixed, he could not be disturbed in his holding for a period of fifteen\r\nyears. Roughly speaking, the Act changed Irish tenancies from tenancies at\r\nwill practically to leaseholds, renewable every fifteen years, subject to\r\nrevision of rent by the Land Courts. It also recognised the tenant’s right\r\nto sell his holding, and provided facilities for the creation of a peasant\r\nproprietary.\r\n\r\nBut the Land Act of 1881 did not settle the land question. The system of\r\ndual ownership which it set up was agreeable neither to landlord nor\r\ntenant, and both now combined to demand fresh legislation for the purpose\r\nof enabling the tenants to purchase their holdings. The Act had destroyed\r\nthe prestige of the landlords; they were disgusted with the spectacle of\r\nseeing “briefless barristers,” (as the Judges of the Land Courts were\r\ncalled), “rambling about the country” and fixing rents independently of\r\ntheir wishes; their occupation as territorial magnates was gone and they\r\nwere now willing to dispose of their estates, if only they could obtain\r\ngood terms. The cry of the tenant always had been the “land for the\r\npeople,” and they raised that cry now louder than ever. Extraordinary as\r\nit may seem the English Tory party took the lead in responding to it. In\r\n1885 the first of a series of Tory Land Purchase Acts was passed. By this\r\nmeasure the state was empowered to advance the whole of the purchase money\r\nto tenants who had agreed with their landlords to purchase their holdings;\r\nforty-nine years were allowed for repayment of the purchase money, at the\r\nrate of 4 per cent. per annum. Between 1885 and 1912 six more Land\r\nPurchase Acts were placed on the Statute book. With a single exception,\r\nall these Acts were passed by Tories. Therefore the Tories take credit to\r\nthemselves for the policy of land purchase. But rather the credit belongs\r\nto Charles Stewart Parnell and the Land League, who, by the revolution of\r\n1881, not only made land purchase possible, but made it inevitable. I\r\ncannot here deal with these Acts in detail(155) but the following table\r\ngives a list of them and shows how they have worked. It also mentions\r\nother Acts which contain provisions for facilitating the creation of a\r\npeasant proprietary.\r\n\r\nAct.                   No. of Purchasers.

It was a subject of the\r\ngreatest magnitude affecting as it did the life of the country. Yet the\r\nImperial Parliament failed for three quarters of a century to realize the\r\nimportance and the gravity of the case; and even then did not grapple\r\nsuccessfully with it.\r\n\r\n“A sad and a discreditable story,” was his comment.\r\n\r\nNowhere, I repeat, can a stronger argument in favour of Home Rule be found\r\nthan in the history of the Irish Land Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one fact in connection with the Government of Ireland during the\r\nnineteenth century with which, I think, English Statesmen are but\r\nimperfectly acquainted, viz., that the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829\r\nwas an utter failure. It was thought that when Irish Catholics were\r\nadmitted to the English Parliament all would go well with Ireland. But the\r\nIrish Catholic member in the English Parliament was absolutely useless to\r\nIreland; and it was that uselessness which led to the Repeal Agitation,\r\nYoung Ireland, Fenianism, and the Home Rule movement.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the English Parliament in truth fostered the idea of Irish\r\nnationality. It is, perhaps, within the range of possibility, that good\r\nlegislation, and good administration might have put out the fire. I know\r\nnot. But as it was those who made the laws, and those who administered the\r\nlaws, fed the flame. Every Coercion Act was a nail in the coffin of the\r\nUnion; and a reminder that the foreigner ruled in the land. When O’Connell\r\nwas “master of the situation” in 1835, he thought that the opportunity had\r\nat length arrived of obtaining important remedial measures for Ireland. We\r\nknow how his hopes were disappointed. When the Irish Members held the\r\nbalance between English parties in 1852, they thought that the time had\r\ncome for securing a beneficial Land Act; but they also were doomed to\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nIn fact between 1829 and 1869 the Irish Members failed to place upon the\r\nStatute book one single measure for which the Irish people had loudly\r\ncalled; and the measures of 1869 and 1870 were due to Fenianism and not to\r\nparliamentary action.\r\n\r\nBetween 1870 and 1881 the efforts of the Parliamentarians were again\r\nmarked by failure, and we know, from Mr. Gladstone himself, that, there\r\nwould have been no Land Act in 1881 if there had been no Land League. In\r\n1884 household suffrage was extended to Ireland. The General Election of\r\n1885 made Parnell “master of the situation.” What was he able to do? He\r\ncertainly got the Home Rule _Bill_ of 1886 and converted the Liberal party\r\nto the cause; but he did not win Home Rule. Between 1892 and 1895 a\r\nLiberal Government was once more kept in office by the Irish vote. But\r\nthough a Home Rule Bill was carried through the Commons in 1893 Home Rule\r\nwas not won. Finally between 1895 and 1906 Home Rule was thrust into the\r\nbackground by an English majority.\r\n\r\nWell might Sir Spencer Walpole have written: “The treatment of Ireland\r\nmade representative Government in Ireland a fraud. It is absurd to say\r\nthat a country enjoys representative institutions if its delegates are\r\nuniformly out-voted by men of another race.”\r\n\r\nWhile the Irish representation in the Imperial Parliament was a fraud, the\r\nEnglish Administration of Ireland was an outrage on national sentiment.\r\nAfter Catholic Emancipation, as before, it was, in the main, based on\r\nProtestant Ascendency principles, which meant not Ireland for the Irish,\r\nbut Ireland for an English faction. As a rule no man in touch with popular\r\nfeeling was allowed to have a voice in the government of the country.\r\nCatholics as Catholics were habitually excluded from office. Since\r\nCatholic Emancipation there has not been a Catholic Lord-Lieutenant, nor a\r\nCatholic Chief Secretary. There have been 3 Catholic Under-Secretaries.\r\nThere have been 3 Lord Chancellors. In the High Court of Justice there are\r\n17 Judges; 3 of them are Catholics. There are 21 County Court Judges and\r\nRecorders; 8 of them are Catholics. There are 37 County Inspectors of\r\nPolice; 5 of them are Catholics. There are 202 District Inspectors of\r\nPolice; 62 of them are Catholics. There are 5,518 ordinary Justices of the\r\nPeace; 1,805 of them are believed to be Catholics. There are 68 Privy\r\nCouncillors; 8 of them are Catholics. And in other offices, through the\r\nwhole gamut of the administration, the same principle of exclusiveness was\r\nobserved. Nor was this all. Catholics who were appointed to office,\r\nfeeling that they were “suspect” as Catholics, only too often, in order to\r\nshow that their loyalty was above suspicion, became more Protestant than\r\nthe Protestants, and more English than the English. “We have now captured\r\nthe Castle,” I heard an Irish Catholic official say, in reference to a\r\nCatholic appointment which had recently been made. The retort was obvious.\r\n“No, but the Castle has captured you.” In truth, no matter what was the\r\nreligion of the official, he appeared before the people as the instrument\r\nof a foreign government, not as the servant of the Irish nation. Let us\r\nremember that it was in the year 1885, not in “ancient times,” that Mr.\r\nChamberlain said in memorable language:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I do not believe that the great majority of Englishmen have the\r\n    slightest conception of the system under which this free nation\r\n    attempts to rule the sister country. It is a system which is\r\n    founded on the bayonets of 30,000 soldiers encamped permanently as\r\n    in a hostile country. It is a system as completely centralised and\r\n    bureaucratic as that with which Russia governs Poland, or as that\r\n    which prevailed in Venice under the Austrian rule. An Irishman at\r\n    the moment cannot move a step—he cannot lift a finger in any\r\n    parochial, municipal, or educational work, without being\r\n    confronted with, interfered with, controlled by an English\r\n    official, appointed by a foreign Government, and without a shade\r\n    or shadow of representative authority.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1898 that popular control in local affairs was\r\nestablished by the County Councils’ Act.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen often say to me: “What an illogical and unreasonable people you\r\nIrish are. At the very time when we were showing our determination to do\r\njustice to Ireland, when we had disestablished the State Church in 1869,\r\nand passed the Land Act of 1870 at that very time, in the very year 1870,\r\nyou started the Home Rule movement.” Englishmen say many foolish things\r\nabout Ireland, because they know nothing about Irish history, and indeed\r\ngive very little serious thought to Irish affairs. The fact that the\r\nEnglish State Church was not disestablished for sixty-nine years after the\r\nUnion, and that an Act for the protection of the tenants and for securing\r\nthe proper cultivation of the soil was not passed until seventy years\r\nafter the Union; and that it took constant agitation and incessant\r\noutbursts of lawlessness and crime and finally a revolutionary convulsion\r\nto accomplish these things, was a sufficient justification for the\r\nestablishment of the Home Rule movement in 1870. Had the government of\r\nIreland in the nineteenth century been as good as it was bad, still I hope\r\nthat the Irish people would not have relinquished their national\r\nclaims—would not have sold their birthright for any mess of porridge; but\r\nthey did not get the porridge; rather vinegar and gall had been the\r\noffering of England to the “sister” isle during sixty-nine years of\r\n“Union.” I have said that the seed sown by O’Connell and Young Ireland\r\ntook root, so did the seed sown by England. Extremes meet. The\r\nagitator—the rebel—and the English Government combined to keep the spirit\r\nof nationality alive, and to make the demand for Home Rule inevitable and\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nIt was on May 19th, 1870, that the Home Rule Association was founded. It\r\nwas no wonder after seventy years of the Union that failed that the\r\nfollowing resolution should have been passed:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “That it is the opinion of this meeting that the true remedy for\r\n    the evils of Ireland is the establishment of an Irish Parliament\r\n    with full control over our domestic affairs.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objects of the Association were then set forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “To obtain for our country the right and privilege of managing our\r\n    own affairs by a Parliament assembled in Ireland, composed of Her\r\n    Majesty, the Sovereign, and her successors, and the Lords and\r\n    Commons of Ireland.\r\n\r\n    “To secure for that Parliament, under a federal arrangement, the\r\n    right of legislating for, and regulating all matters relating to\r\n    the internal affairs of Ireland, and control over Irish resources\r\n    and expenditure, subject to the obligation of contributing our\r\n    just proportion of the Imperial expenditure; [leaving to] an\r\n    Imperial Parliament the power of dealing with all questions\r\n    affecting the Imperial Crown and Government, legislation regarding\r\n    the Colonies and other dependencies of the Crown, the relations of\r\n    the United Empire with foreign States, and all matters\r\n    appertaining to the defence and stability of the Empire at\r\n    large....”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the General Election of 1874, 59 Home Rulers were returned to\r\nParliament. At the election of 1880 the number was increased to 61. At the\r\nelection of 1885 it was increased to 85, at which figure it stands to-day.\r\n\r\nOn June 30th, 1874, a motion by Isaac Butt for an enquiry into the subject\r\nof Home Rule was defeated in the House of Commons by 458 votes to 61.\r\nNineteen years afterwards a Bill to establish a Parliament and an\r\nExecutive in Dublin for the management of Irish Affairs was carried\r\nthrough the House of Commons by the Government of Mr. Gladstone. On the\r\nretirement of Mr. Gladstone from public life Home Rule received a set back\r\nin England, but to-day it holds the field once more.\r\n\r\nIf the Land Act of 1870 had been a success instead of a failure it could\r\nnot have checked the flowing tide. It was in 1871 that Mr. Lecky wrote:\r\n“The sentiment of nationality lies at the root of Irish discontent.” Ten\r\nyears earlier Goldwin Smith used the following remarkable language:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The real root of Irish disaffection is the want of national\r\n    institutions, of a national capital, of any objects of national\r\n    reverence and attachment, and, consequently, of anything deserving\r\n    to be called national life. The greatness of England is nothing to\r\n    the Irish. Her history is nothing, or worse. The success of\r\n    Irishmen in London consoles the Irish no more than the success of\r\n    Italian adventurers in foreign countries (which was very\r\n    remarkable) consoled the Italian people. The drawing off of Irish\r\n    talent, in fact, turns to an additional grievance in their mind.\r\n    Dublin is a modern Tara; a Metropolis from which the glory has\r\n    departed; and the Vice-Royalty, though it pleases some of the\r\n    tradesmen, fails altogether to satisfy the people. ’In Ireland we\r\n    can make no appeal to patriotism; we can have no patriotic\r\n    sentiments in our school books, no patriotic emblems in our\r\n    schools, because in Ireland everything patriotic is rebellious.’\r\n    These were the words uttered in my hearing, not by a complaining\r\n    demagogue, but by a desponding statesman.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween 1861 and 1871 the tide of nationality was rising. Fenianism\r\ndiverted it in the direction of separation. Isaac Butt brought it back to\r\nthe channel of legislative autonomy. The failure of the Land Act of 1870,\r\nthe refusal of Parliament to amend it, the renewal of Coercion, the\r\npolitical excitement caused by Fenianism and the definite demand for Home\r\nRule, swelled the tide and gave it fresh force. All the Land Acts passed\r\nbetween 1881 and 1909 have not changed the current of public feeling. Home\r\nRule has not been killed by kindness.\r\n\r\nThe class which long refused to remove Irish material grievances, now say,\r\nthat, since some of those grievances have been remedied, the Irish ought\r\nto abandon the demand for Home Rule. John Stuart Mill warned the class in\r\nquestion many years ago that if the removal of material grievances were\r\ndelayed, the time might come when the fight would be for an idea, and that\r\nthen the Irish problem would be more formidable than ever. The fight\r\nto-day is for an idea—the idea of nationality—and English Unionist\r\nstatesmen do not apparently understand it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Alas for the self-complacent ignorance of irresponsible rulers,\r\n    be they monarchs, classes, or nations! If there is anything sadder\r\n    than the calamity itself, it is the unmistakable sincerity and\r\n    good faith with which numbers of Englishmen confess themselves\r\n    incapable of comprehending it. They know not that the disaffection\r\n    which neither has nor needs any other motive than aversion to the\r\n    rulers, is the climax to a long growth of disaffection arising\r\n    from causes that might have been removed. What seems to them the\r\n    causelessness of the Irish repugnance to our rule, is the proof\r\n    that they have almost let pass the last opportunity they are ever\r\n    likely to have of setting it right. They have allowed what once\r\n    was indignation against particular wrongs, to harden into a\r\n    passionate determination to be no longer ruled on any terms by\r\n    those to whom they ascribe all their evils.”(157)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglishmen thoroughly appreciate the idea of nationality except when it\r\napplies to Ireland.\r\n\r\nMr. Redmond has been recently censured because he said, in effect, that\r\nmaterial prosperity is not everything. Yet what did Mr. Disraeli say in\r\nhis inaugural address to the University of Glasgow in 1873:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It is not true that physical happiness is the highest happiness;\r\n    it is not true that physical happiness is a principle on which you\r\n    can build up a flourishing and enduring commonwealth. A civilised\r\n    community must rest on a large realised capital of thought and\r\n    sentiment; there must be a reserved fund of public morality to\r\n    draw upon in the exigencies of national life. Society has a soul\r\n    as well as a body, the traditions of a nation are part of its\r\n    existence. Its valour and its discipline, its religious faith, its\r\n    venerable laws, its science and erudition, its poetry, its art,\r\n    its eloquence and its scholarship, are as much portions of its\r\n    existence as its agriculture, its commerce, and its engineering\r\n    skill. Nay, I would go further, I would say that without these\r\n    qualities, material excellence cannot be attained.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the true doctrine. The spirit of nationality is the spirit of\r\nlife. Material progress itself springs from national freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.—The History Of Devolution. BY THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to sketch the history of devolution in connection with\r\nIreland, two somewhat remarkable facts should be mentioned. A widespread\r\nimpression appears to exist that devolution as a means for solving the\r\nIrish political problem is a modern invention, and that I am, in a large\r\nmeasure, responsible for its introduction. I must in honesty disclaim the\r\nhonour. There is nothing new either in the expression or in its\r\napplication to Ireland. The term has been freely used by many statesmen,\r\nand, as I think I can demonstrate, the advocacy of a scheme of Devolution\r\nfor Ireland has not been confined to any one of the two great political\r\nparties of the State.\r\n\r\nThe second remarkable fact in connection with devolution, in its latest\r\nexpression, is the hostile attitude assumed towards it by the Nationalist\r\nparty. That the programme, modest as it was, published by the Irish Reform\r\nAssociation in 1904 should have been assailed by many Unionists was\r\nnatural enough, but that any Nationalists should have denounced it with\r\nequal or greater bitterness is very difficult to account for. The wiser\r\nspirits welcomed the movement. The leader of the party—Mr. John\r\nRedmond—alluding to us in America, said: “With these men with us Home Rule\r\nmay come at any moment,” and the Convention of the United Irish League of\r\nAmerica spoke of our action as “a victory unparalleled in the whole\r\nhistory of moral warfare.” But Mr. John Dillon and Mr. Michael Davitt took\r\na very different view and condemned us in no measured terms. Mr. Davitt at\r\nClonmacnoise on September 4th, 1904, said: “If we are foolish enough to be\r\nwiled by Lord Dunraven and Mr. George Wyndham, who is possibly behind this\r\nwooden-horse stratagem, we will richly merit the contempt of our race and\r\nfriends everywhere for so abject a surrender of the National Movement,”\r\nand at Enniscorthy, far from agreeing with Mr. Redmond that our assistance\r\nwas of the greatest value to the cause of Home Rule, he declared that: “No\r\nparty or leader can consent to accept the Dunraven substitute without\r\nbetraying a national trust.” Mr. Dillon at Sligo accused devolution of\r\nbeing a scheme to “break National unity in Ireland and to block the\r\nadvance of the Nationalist cause.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately these sentiments prevailed, and every effort was made to\r\ndiscredit and obstruct the movement. The attitude adopted towards\r\ndevolution is natural on the part of anyone whose aim is separation; but,\r\nfailing that, can be accounted for only by the animosity displayed by the\r\ninner group of the party to any expression of opinion, unauthorised by\r\ntheir official stamp. Devolution was anathematised simply because it was\r\nsuggested as a method of political reform by persons who did not\r\nnecessarily recognise the infallibility of the Party. It is impossible to\r\nbelieve that by any contortion of thought the theory was really looked\r\nupon as a cunningly constructed device for countering, or in some way\r\nundermining, Home Rule, for whatever opinion might be held about the\r\npersonal honesty of myself and those associated with me, very little\r\nexamination into the question would have sufficed to dispel that delusion.\r\nHome Rule up to a point necessarily implies devolution. Devolution is up\r\nto a point the same thing as Home Rule. The difference lies in this. Home\r\nRule may be held to mean, has been held to mean, and is now by some held\r\nto mean, repeal of the union and separation. Devolution means, and can\r\nonly mean, as applicable to the existing state of things—the delegation by\r\nthe one existing authority—the Imperial Parliament—of power to a\r\nParliament or body—call it what you will—created to exercise the power\r\ndelegated to it. The term of necessity implies supremacy and subordinacy.\r\nDevolution may be confined to administration, as for instance in the\r\nabortive Irish Councils Bill of 1907; or to legislative functions\r\nconferring a status analogous to that of Grattan’s Parliament, which while\r\nenjoying full legislative power exercised practically no executive\r\nauthority whatever; or it may embrace all the functions of government. The\r\ndevolution may be large or small, confined or comprehensive. There is no\r\nlimit save one to the delegating power of the central authority. It can\r\nconfer whatever legislative and executive functions it pleases, but it\r\ncannot divest itself of its power of resumption, and it must remain\r\nsupreme.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen therefore that devolution does not connote separation. It\r\nis incompatible with repeal, but it is compatible with—it is in fact\r\nindistinguishable from, any conception of Home Rule that acknowledges the\r\nsupremacy of the Imperial Parliament. It is applicable to propositions of\r\nreform however small or however large. The modest little Councils Bill\r\nalready alluded to proceeded by devolution. Complete reconstruction of the\r\nUnited Kingdom on federal lines can be accomplished only by devolution,\r\nfor to commence operations by restoring Wales to the position she occupied\r\nin 1284, and Scotland and Ireland to the status they respectively held in\r\n1707 and 1800, and then to invite them to enter a federal union would be\r\nan idea worthy of the pen of a Lewis Carroll in a sort of political “Alice\r\nin Wonderland.” Ireland’s political problem can be solved only in one of\r\ntwo ways. She must be granted either absolute independence tempered only\r\nby the precarious tie of a common Crown, or legislative and administrative\r\npowers delegated by a superior to a subordinate Parliament. By Home Rule\r\nseparation may be meant. Separation would, in my opinion, be disastrous to\r\nGreat Britain and fatal to Ireland. Devolution would be beneficial to\r\nboth, and it is because the term draws a clear distinction between\r\nindependence and any form of autonomy short of independence, that I prefer\r\nto call myself a Devolutionist rather than a Home Ruler.\r\n\r\nThat devolution to a local authority, or to local authorities, is the\r\nproper remedy for evils affecting Great Britain and Ireland, has been, for\r\nvarious reasons, admitted by responsible statesmen during the last fifty\r\nyears. As long ago as 1865 the late Lord Salisbury, then Lord Robert\r\nCecil, enquiring why “a people with so wonderful a soil, with such\r\nenormous resources (as the Irish) lagged so far behind the English in the\r\nrace?” and examining critically all the usual reasons assigned, came to\r\nthe conclusion that the cause was not to be found in any of them, but was\r\nto be sought for in the system of government. “I am afraid,” he said,\r\n“that the one thing which has been peculiar to Ireland has been the\r\nGovernment of England.” About the same time Lord Beaconsfield went so far\r\nas to indicate his desire for a federal arrangement. In a conversation\r\nwith the American Ambassador in London in the early ’seventies he stated\r\nthat: “If he had to deal with the situation he would propose to place\r\nIreland in a similar position that New York held in the Federal\r\nGovernment.” In 1879 Mr. Gladstone advocated devolution, and devolution on\r\nfederal lines, for the relief of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I desire,” he said, “I may almost say I intensely desire, to see\r\n    Parliament relieved of some portion of its duties.... We have got\r\n    an over-weighted Parliament; and if Ireland, or any other portion\r\n    of the country, is desirous and able so to arrange its affairs\r\n    that by taking the local part, or some local part, of its\r\n    transactions off the hands of Parliament, it can liberate and\r\n    strengthen Parliament for Imperial concerns, I say I will not only\r\n    accord a reluctant assent, but I will give a zealous support to\r\n    any such scheme.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter indicating that the only limit he knew to the extension of local\r\ngovernment was the limit imposed by the necessity of maintaining the\r\nsupremacy of the Imperial Parliament, he went on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I will consent to give to Ireland no principle, nothing that is\r\n    not upon equal terms offered to Scotland and to the different\r\n    parts of the United Kingdom. But I say that the man who shall\r\n    devise a machinery by which some portion of the excessive and\r\n    impossible task now laid upon the House of Commons shall be\r\n    shifted to the more free, and therefore more efficient, hands of\r\n    secondary and local authorities, will confer a blessing upon his\r\n    country that will entitle him to be reckoned among the prominent\r\n    benefactors of the land.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1885 Mr. Gladstone, the Duke of Devonshire and Mr. Chamberlain all\r\nspoke in favour of devolution. The “Radical programme,” published with a\r\npreface by Mr. Chamberlain, before the General Election of that year,\r\nadvocated the creation, in addition to County Councils and District\r\nCouncils, of elected National Councils for Ireland, Scotland, and (if\r\ndesired by the Welsh) Wales, to take over part of the duties of the\r\ncentral administration, and also to deal with private Bills, but\r\napparently not with other matters of legislation. The appointment of a\r\nSecretary for Scotland had not then been decided upon, but the subject was\r\nunder discussion, and the writer doubtless expected that greater attention\r\nto Scotch legislation would be secured by that means. In the course of his\r\nargument he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Before dealing, as we presently shall at some length, with the\r\n    case of Ireland, it seems well to say a few words on another\r\n    object of the first importance, which can be accomplished only in\r\n    connection with some such extension of the principles of local\r\n    government as we are now considering. Recent experience has made\r\n    it perfectly clear that Parliamentary Government is being exposed\r\n    to a strain for which it may prove unequal. The overwhelming work\r\n    thrown upon the Imperial Legislature is too much for its\r\n    machinery.... The Imperial evil is not less than the domestic.\r\n    What, for instance, can be more deplorable than the systematic\r\n    neglect at Westminster of Colonial and Indian topics of the\r\n    highest moment? It is obvious that no mere extension of local\r\n    government upon the ordinary and restricted lines will relieve the\r\n    Parliamentary congestion which has long since become a national\r\n    calamity.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Duke of Devonshire expressed, for so cautious a man, pretty\r\nstrong views on the imperfections of “Castle Government” and on the\r\nadvantages of devolution. Speaking in Belfast on November 5th, 1885, he\r\ndefended the Irish Government against accusations which he considered\r\nunjust, but added:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “At the same time, I am perfectly willing to admit that it is very\r\n    possible and even probable, that the Irish Government as now\r\n    constituted is not the best fitted in all respects to discharge,\r\n    still less to undertake new and more important duties. I would not\r\n    shrink from a great and bold reconstruction of Irish\r\n    government....”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe explained that, in his opinion, considerable power ought to be left in\r\nthe hands of the executive, but added:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I would endeavour so to frame those powers as to make them\r\n    capable of relaxation, perhaps ultimately of relinquishment, in\r\n    response to any proof we may receive from the Irish people of\r\n    their fitness for self-government, their fitness for the\r\n    assumption of those responsibilities.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLater in the same year, Mr. Gladstone, in his address to the electors of\r\nMidlothian, used the word “devolution” as, I believe, for the first time\r\nin connection with the Parliamentary problem due to the over-pressure of\r\nwork. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It has gratified me to find abundant proof that the country was,\r\n    and is, fully alive to the vital importance of devolution.... The\r\n    task of the House of Commons in our time has habitually exceeded\r\n    what had ever been imposed upon a legislative body in the whole\r\n    history of the world.... I desire to point out the three cardinal\r\n    points of the question. First, the congestion of business, now\r\n    notorious and inveterate, degrades the House of Commons by placing\r\n    it at the mercy of those among its members who seek for notoriety\r\n    by obstructing business, instead of pursuing the more honourable\r\n    road to reputation by useful service, or of those who, with more\r\n    semblance of warrant, seek to cripple the action of the House of\r\n    Commons in order to force the acceptance of their own political\r\n    projects. Secondly, it disappoints, irritates, and injures the\r\n    country by the suspension of useful legislation. And lastly, and\r\n    perhaps worst of all, it defeats the fundamental rule of our\r\n    Parliamentary system—that the majority shall prevail.... This\r\n    country will not, in the full sense, be a self-governing country\r\n    until the machinery of the House of Commons is amended, and its\r\n    procedure reformed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Mr. Gladstone had in his mind reform of procedure of\r\nthe nature of devolution to bodies within the House of Commons such as\r\nGrand Committees; but in view of his former utterances it is probable that\r\nhe foresaw the necessity for devolution on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain continued, even during the Home Rule controversy, faithful\r\nin his advocacy of devolution. In a manifesto to his supporters, issued on\r\nJuly 11th, 1886, he appealed to the moderate opinion in Great Britain for\r\na “delegation not a surrender of power,” on the part of the Imperial\r\nParliament. He outlined his political aims in the following succinct\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The objects to be kept in view are:\r\n\r\n    (1) To relieve the Imperial Parliament by devolution of Irish\r\n    local business, and to set it free for other and more important\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    (2) To secure the free representation of Irish opinion in all\r\n    matters of purely Irish concern.\r\n\r\n    (3) To offer to Irishmen a fair field for legitimate local\r\n    ambition and patriotism, and to bring back the attention of the\r\n    Irish people, now diverted to a barren conflict in the Imperial\r\n    Parliament, to the practical consideration of their own wants and\r\n    necessities.\r\n\r\n    And, lastly, by removing all unnecessary interference with Irish\r\n    Government on the part of Great Britain, to diminish the causes of\r\n    irritation and the opportunity of collision.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chamberlain was acutely aware of the intimate connection between\r\npolitical and agrarian reform, and outlined a general constructive policy\r\nwhich was adopted up to a point later on by the Unionist party under the\r\ninspiration of Mr. George Wyndham:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “It is clear,” said Mr. Chamberlain, “that suggested land reform\r\n    must precede the political change; and until the long-standing\r\n    quarrel between land-owners and land-occupiers has been\r\n    compounded, it will not be safe to trust the latter with full\r\n    control over the property of the former.... But, assuming that the\r\n    social war which now exists in Ireland were terminated by a\r\n    reasonable settlement, there are strong reasons for desiring, on\r\n    the one hand, to relieve the Imperial Parliament of some of the\r\n    constantly increasing burden of its local work, and, on the other\r\n    hand, to open up to Irishmen in their own country a larger field\r\n    of local ambition, together with greater liberty of action and\r\n    greater personal responsibility.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Devonshire also expressed himself in favour of devolution,\r\nprovided that “the powers which may be conferred on local bodies should be\r\ndelegated—not surrendered—by Parliament”; that “the subjects to be\r\ndelegated should be clearly defined; and the right of Parliament to\r\ncontrol and revise the action of legislative or administrative authorities\r\nshould be quite clearly reserved”; but he urged that “the administration\r\nof justice ought to remain in the hands of an authority which is\r\nresponsible to Parliament.”\r\n\r\nAs recently as April, 1893, in the course of an article in _The Nineteenth\r\nCentury_ Mr. Chamberlain stated that “every Liberal Unionist will readily\r\nagree” with a desire “to give to Ireland the management of such of its\r\naffairs as can be handed over to an Irish Assembly without any risk or\r\ndanger to this country, and, I hope that I may add, without the loss of\r\nhonour that would be involved if the property and the liberties of all Her\r\nMajesty’s subjects were not fully safeguarded.” It is evident that the\r\nLiberal Unionist seceders drew a sharp distinction between separation and\r\ndevolution. They objected to Mr. Gladstone’s Bills because rightly or\r\nwrongly they were convinced that they involved separation; but while\r\nopposing them on that ground they held fast to their belief in the\r\nefficacy of devolution.\r\n\r\nAfter 1893 devolution was little heard of, but about ten years later the\r\ntheory was revived in the movement with which I became associated. This\r\nmodern suggestion of devolution was an offspring of the Conference on the\r\nland question which was held during the winter of 1902. That Conference\r\nproduced a profound impression not only on the individuals composing it,\r\nbut also, with a few exceptions of a retrogressive or perverted type, upon\r\nthe classes represented, and consequently upon the whole community. The\r\nland had been for generations, and for centuries, the cause of bitter\r\nstrife. The parties represented—indeed some of the individuals\r\nrepresenting them had come straight out of the firing line to confer upon\r\na question bristling with difficulties and overlain with passion and\r\nprejudice. The Landlords’ Convention not unnaturally laughed to scorn the\r\nidea of a settlement or even of amicable discussion; but they were\r\nwrong—prejudice and passion were put aside and the difficulties were\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nThe Land Conference—an inspiration of the inarticulate moderate opinion\r\nexisting in Ireland—proved that frank and honest discussion between\r\nIrishmen holding opposing views could be productive of good results, and\r\nit naturally occurred to many of those interested that the tolerance, good\r\nfeeling and good sense displayed in settling so vexed a question might be\r\nutilised to find a solution for other problems, social, economic and\r\npolitical, presenting difficulties of a less formidable character.\r\n\r\nOn March 3rd, 1903, five members of the Land Conference Committee issued a\r\ncircular stating that it was “now becoming evident that only in a\r\nreasonable system of devolution of legislative powers is to be found the\r\nsolution of the problem that demands such urgent consideration. In no\r\nother way can Parliament be relieved from the ever-increasing strain of\r\npublic business or the legitimate aspirations of Ireland for some definite\r\nform of self-government be met.”\r\n\r\nThe idea was a good one, but somewhat premature. The Land Conference\r\nCommittee having been appointed for a definite purpose—the settlement of\r\nthe land question, which had not then been fulfilled, had no authority to\r\ndeal with any other matter. All men’s minds were still occupied with the\r\nconsideration of the land purchase problem, and obviously the moment was\r\nnot suitable for a further step forward. The matter was therefore allowed\r\nto drop; but in the summer of 1904, the way for the new—but yet old—policy\r\nseemed open. The Land Conference had fulfilled its purpose. The Committee\r\nwas about to dissolve, and it occurred to some of us that a meeting should\r\nbe held in Dublin with a view to inaugurating a general policy for the\r\nbetterment of Ireland. In preparation for the meeting I sketched out\r\nroughly what I thought our objects should be, and among them was a larger\r\ncontrol for Ireland over her local affairs. The Committee met on August\r\n25th, and two resolutions were passed, one dissolving the Committee and\r\nanother forming the Irish Reform Association. We then set to work to\r\nconsider a programme, and on August 26th we adopted the following as\r\nsetting forth the objects of the Association:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Believing, as we do, that the prosperity of the people of\r\n    Ireland, the development of the resources of the country, and the\r\n    satisfactory settlement of the land and other questions, depend\r\n    upon the pursuance of a policy of conciliation and goodwill and of\r\n    reform, we desire to do everything in our power to promote a union\r\n    of all moderate and progressive opinion, irrespective of creed or\r\n    class; to discourage sectarian strife and class animosities from\r\n    whatever source arising; to co-operate in re-creating and\r\n    promoting industrial enterprises; and to advocate all practical\r\n    measures of reform.\r\n\r\n    “While firmly maintaining that the parliamentary union between\r\n    Great Britain and Ireland is essential to the political stability\r\n    of the Empire, and to the prosperity of the two islands, we\r\n    believe that such union is compatible with the devolution to\r\n    Ireland of a larger measure of local government than she now\r\n    possesses.\r\n\r\n    “We consider that this devolution, while avoiding matters of\r\n    Imperial concern, and subjects of common interest to the Kingdom\r\n    as a whole, would be beneficial to Ireland, and would relieve the\r\n    Imperial Parliament of a mass of business with which it cannot now\r\n    deal satisfactorily, and which occupies its time to the detriment\r\n    of much more important concerns. In particular, we consider the\r\n    present system of financial administration to be wasteful and\r\n    inappreciative of the needs of the country.\r\n\r\n    “We think it possible to devise a system of Irish finance whereby\r\n    the expenditure could be conducted in a more efficient and\r\n    economic manner, and whereby the sources of revenue might be\r\n    expanded. We believe that a remedy for the present unsatisfactory\r\n    system can be found in such a decentralisation or localisation of\r\n    Irish finance as will secure to its administration the application\r\n    of local knowledge, interest and ability, without in any way\r\n    sacrificing the ultimate control over the estimates presented, or\r\n    in respect of the audit of money expended, at present possessed by\r\n    the Imperial Parliament. All moneys derived from administrative\r\n    reform, together with whatever proportion of the general revenue\r\n    is allocated to Irish purposes, should be administered subject to\r\n    the above conditions.\r\n\r\n    “We think that the time has come to extend to Ireland the system\r\n    of Private Bill Legislation which has been so successfully worked\r\n    in Scotland, with such modifications as Scotch experience may\r\n    suggest, as may be necessary to meet the requirements of this\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    “We are of opinion that a settlement of the question of higher\r\n    education is urgently needed, and that the whole system of\r\n    education in this country requires remodelling and co-ordinating.\r\n\r\n    “We desire to do all in our power to further the policy of land\r\n    purchase in the spirit of, and on the general lines laid down in,\r\n    the Land Conference Report.\r\n\r\n    “We consider that suitable provision for the housing of the\r\n    labouring classes is of the utmost importance, and we shall be\r\n    prepared to co-operate in any practical proposals having the\r\n    betterment of this class in view.\r\n\r\n    “Among many other problems already existing, or which may arise in\r\n    the future, the above-mentioned appear to us to comprise those\r\n    most deserving of immediate attention, and which afford the most\r\n    reasonable prospect of attaining practical results; towards their\r\n    solution we earnestly invite the co-operation of all Irishmen who\r\n    have the highest interests of their country at heart.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe programme was, as will be seen, socially and economically a\r\ncomprehensive one; but, so far as political reform was concerned, limited\r\nto the devolution of administrative functions and reform of Private Bill\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards we explained our views more in detail, and made a\r\nfurther suggestion in recommending a delegation, not only of\r\nadministrative, but also of legislative functions to the Irish body. On\r\nthis point, and after giving our reasons for desiring a Private Bill\r\nProcedure Act for Ireland, we said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “... But the disabilities under which Ireland labours are not\r\n    confined to Private Bill procedure. The problems that affect her\r\n    well-being, the peculiarities of her position and requirements are\r\n    such that similarity of treatment does not always involve equal\r\n    justice ... under existing circumstances the special needs of\r\n    Ireland do not, and cannot receive, adequate attention. Sufficient\r\n    relief cannot, in our opinion, be afforded by mere amendment in\r\n    the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. Some delegation of\r\n    authority is necessary. We believe that power to deal with much of\r\n    the business relating to Irish affairs which Parliament is at\r\n    present unable to cope with, might, with perfect safety and with\r\n    advantage both to Ireland and Parliament, be delegated to an Irish\r\n    body to be constituted for the purpose.... Parliament should take\r\n    power to refer to the Statutory Body not only business connected\r\n    with Private Bill Legislation, but also such other matters as in\r\n    its wisdom it may deem suitable for reference, under prescribed\r\n    conditions. The experience gained by this method of _ad hoc_\r\n    reference would materially assist Parliament in the ultimate\r\n    grouping into distinct classes of matters to be referred to the\r\n    Statutory Body.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe document is far too long to quote in full. We dealt critically with\r\nthe Irish problem as it presented itself to us then, and concluded with a\r\nrecommendation which, if it had been acted upon, would by now have borne\r\nfruit in the shape of information of great value, to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “... We do not consider it now opportune,” we said, “to make more\r\n    definite proposals on the points herein raised. We are prepared to\r\n    inquire fully into them if the Association so desire, but we\r\n    submit that inquiry can be best conducted by means of a Royal\r\n    Commission, and that the proper function of this Association is to\r\n    place its opinions and propositions before such a Commission. We\r\n    therefore recommend the Association to use its best endeavours to\r\n    secure the appointment of a Commission, and to instruct this or\r\n    some other Committee to prepare a detailed report for its\r\n    consideration, with a view to placing the same in evidence before\r\n    the Commission....”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn preparing this second programme we had the invaluable assistance of Sir\r\nAntony MacDonnell (now Lord MacDonnell of Swynford) who occupied the\r\nposition of Under-Secretary, but on somewhat peculiar terms. Our\r\nproposals, which are to be found in full in “The Outlook in Ireland,”\r\npublished for me by Mr. John Murray in 1907, may be considered as cramped\r\nand limited in character, but the circumstances in which we found\r\nourselves must be considered. We had to deal with existing conditions. A\r\nUnionist administration was in power. Home Rule was in abeyance, by many\r\nlooked upon as dead and decently buried out of sight for ever. But the\r\nChief Secretary and Under-Secretary were pledged to a policy of\r\nadministrative and economic reform, and the latter was known to be in\r\nfavour of some modification of the terms of the legislative union.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to re-open the controversy as to the connivance of the\r\nUnionist party, or any of its members, with the early work of myself and\r\nothers.(158) No ministerial or official comment was made on our first\r\nprogramme published on August 31st, 1904. Mr. Wyndham was away at the time\r\nand in his absence I consulted with the Permanent Under-Secretary for\r\nIreland, a proceeding which I felt sure, would meet with the Chief\r\nSecretary’s approval. The Unionist Lord-Lieutenant, the Earl of Dudley,\r\nwas also cognisant of the movement. The second programme was published on\r\nSeptember 26th of that year, and on the following day a letter from Mr.\r\nWyndham commenting upon it appeared in _The Times_. After criticising our\r\nproposals he said “without reserve or qualification that the Unionist\r\nGovernment is opposed to the multiplication of legislative bodies within\r\nthe United Kingdom,” and declared that such of our “aspirations” as were\r\n“unimpeachable” were “prejudiced and not enhanced when they are confused\r\nwith any plan, however tentative, for the multiplication of legislative\r\nassemblies within the limits of the United Kingdom.” Mr. George Wyndham,\r\nin order not to embarrass his party, resigned his office, but Lord Dudley\r\nremained Lord-Lieutenant after Mr. Walter Long had become Chief Secretary.\r\nIn some later correspondence, published in the spring of 1906, with Sir\r\nEdward Carson, Lord Dudley after relinquishing his office stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “(1) That though I fully explained to the late Prime Minister the\r\n    nature of my connection with what you describe as Sir A.\r\n    MacDonnell’s Home Rule scheme, he never conveyed to me any\r\n    intimation that he or the Government disapproved, strongly or\r\n    otherwise, of my conduct, though, of course, I can well believe\r\n    that you and a few other Ministers disapproved not only of the\r\n    devolution proposals, but also of any attempt at governing Ireland\r\n    in sympathy with Irish ideas.\r\n\r\n    “(2) That I was never asked for and never gave any assurance that\r\n    it was no longer my intention to act in a manner at variance with\r\n    my position as a Unionist Lord-Lieutenant. It was not my opinion\r\n    then, nor is it now, that I ever so acted, and I do not consider\r\n    that my knowledge of the devolution proposal, still less my\r\n    conviction that Ireland should be governed according to Irish\r\n    ideas, is inconsistent with the position which I occupied.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDevolution held the field when a Liberal administration came into power in\r\n1906 and found expression in the Councils Bill. That Bill practically gave\r\nto an Irish body control over the great spending departments. It embodied\r\ndevolution on a large scale, but entirely confined to administration. The\r\nLiberal party had passed a self-denying ordinance in respect to Home Rule\r\nwhile still in opposition. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, speaking at\r\nStirling on November 23rd, 1905, said it was “his desire to see the\r\neffective management of Irish affairs in the hands of a representative\r\nIrish authority”; but he advised Irish Nationalists thankfully to take “an\r\ninstalment of representative control” ... “or any administrative\r\nimprovement” ... “provided it was consistent, and led up to their larger\r\npolicy.” We have it on the authority of Mr. T. P. O’Connor that this\r\ndeclaration “was all that the Irish Nationalist party could have expected\r\nat that moment, and it enabled them to give their full support at the\r\nelections to the Liberal party”; and, in alluding to the private\r\nbreakfast-table conference between himself, a friend and Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, he informs us that “the exchange of views was brief,\r\nfor there was complete agreement as to both policy and tactics.” Mr.\r\nRedmond also, speaking at Motherwell a couple of days after the Stirling\r\nspeech, announced his readiness to accept any concession “which would\r\nshorten and smooth the way to Home Rule.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these plain declarations Mr. Redmond, having accepted the\r\nCouncils Bill in the House of Commons, moved its rejection at the National\r\nConvention and endeavoured to justify his action at the expense of\r\ndevolutionists by protesting “that the responsibility for this Bill\r\nlargely rests upon those who first encouraged this idea of devolution”—a\r\nprotest in which Mr. T. P. O’Connor joined him. The truth is that in their\r\nCouncils Bill the Government went in principle as far as they could under\r\nthe circumstances. The idea that they, or the Irish Reform Association in\r\ngeneral, and I myself in particular, were actuated by a desire to shelve\r\nHome Rule by substituting a measure of administrative reform, is\r\npre-eminently absurd. The tactics pursued by the Nationalist party towards\r\nthe Irish Reform Association and the Government were most unwise. The\r\nAssociation would, had it received the support it deserved, have certainly\r\norganised and rendered articulate a body of moderate opinion strong enough\r\nto neutralise any immoderate demonstration against the principle of Home\r\nRule on religious, racial, or social grounds. Had the Councils Bill been\r\namended and accepted by Ireland, and, as is probable, had it been passed\r\ninto law, Ireland would have had an opportunity, which she would have\r\navailed herself of, of proving her aptitude to manage her own affairs, and\r\nshe would be now in a position of inestimable advantage to her. But\r\nneither I nor the Reform Association considered the Bill as satisfying\r\nIreland’s reasonable demands. We looked upon it as valuable in itself _pro\r\ntanto_ and as the honest effort of a Government with self-imposed limits\r\nto do justice to Ireland. The Association having considered the matter,\r\npassed and published a series of resolutions which space forbids me from\r\nquoting in full. To summarise, we criticised the limited transfer of\r\ndepartmental authority, and considered the financial proposals of the Bill\r\ninsufficient. We regretted “that the Bill entirely excludes consideration\r\nof any powers of a legislative character.” But, as we thought the Bill\r\nconstituted an advance towards necessary reforms and was capable of\r\namendment in Committee, we expressed our regret at its summary rejection\r\nby the National Convention.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story of the devolution movement in its modern expression.\r\nDevolution is an elastic though not a vague term. As I have already said,\r\nit is incompatible with repeal of the Union. It predicates a union of some\r\nsort—connection with a superior delegating authority, but under that union\r\nand subject to that authority its powers of expansion are unlimited. If I\r\nmay be allowed to quote from myself, an evil habit, I thus defined my\r\nposition in 1907. I then declared it was:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “... my ambition to see:—\r\n\r\n    “(1) Cordial, honest co-operation among Irishmen for their\r\n    country’s good. A true, living sense of Irish nationality is\r\n    necessary. Ireland united can accomplish anything in reason.\r\n\r\n    “(2) The exercise of moderation and common-sense on the part of\r\n    Irishmen.\r\n\r\n    “(3) The creation of friendly, fraternal relations between Great\r\n    Britain and Ireland on both sides—‘let the dead bury their dead.’\r\n\r\n    “(4) Recognition by Ireland of: (_a_) Her Imperial mission, her\r\n    share in the larger nationality covered by the Flag, and her\r\n    consequent duties and responsibilities; and (_b_) of the political\r\n    necessities of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    “(5) Recognition by Great Britain of: (_a_) Irish nationality; and\r\n    (_b_) of the economic and social requirements of Ireland, and of\r\n    her just claim for exceptional treatment.”\r\n\r\n\r\nand I concluded by saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “... My political creed is clear and simple. One Parliament is my\r\n    centre; its ultimate effective supremacy is my circumference; but,\r\n    emanating from that centre, and within that circumscribing limit,\r\n    I desire to see the largest possible freedom of action and\r\n    self-governing power delegated to Ireland.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was the opinion I then held and, in its general principles, that is\r\nthe opinion I hold now. I have endeavoured to obtain such a measure of\r\ndevolution as was at the time practical of attainment. My ideal is\r\ndevolution on federal lines—that is to say, devolution of a character as\r\nnearly analogous as circumstances permit, to such an arrangement as would\r\nbe come to between co-ordinate legislatures federating for their mutual\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to recall the public declarations of statesmen of\r\nthe Victorian period in order to get a true conception of the devolution\r\nmovement in proper perspective. Among English statesmen of the front rank\r\nwe find Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Salisbury, the Duke of Devonshire, Mr.\r\nChamberlain and Mr. Gladstone all admitting the great fact that both for\r\nBritish and for Irish purposes, some scheme of devolution was necessary.\r\nIt would be easy to multiply instances and to give quotations in\r\nprofusion, but I have said enough to show that for the last half century\r\nstatesmen have, for various reasons, advocated devolution. Upon some the\r\nnecessity has been impressed by deliberate obstruction in the House of\r\nCommons, others have been actuated by a desire to relieve congestion and\r\nto restore dignity and efficiency to the Commons House of Parliament. Upon\r\nothers again the conviction has been forced that, under the system created\r\nby the Act of Union, Ireland cannot be well governed or contented; and a\r\nfew have foreseen that both for domestic and Imperial purposes\r\nreconstruction on federal lines is desirable. Yet, in spite of this\r\nremarkable expression of opinion, nothing has been done, though the\r\nnecessity for action has become more and more urgent with every passing\r\nyear, and though many of the objections felt in former days can no longer\r\nbe entertained. The doubts felt by the Duke of Devonshire as to the\r\nfitness of the Irish people to exercise self-governing power have been\r\ndispelled by experience of the working of the Act of 1898. The settlement\r\nof the land question rightly deemed by Mr. Chamberlain an essential\r\npreliminary to, or accompaniment of, political reform, has been half\r\naccomplished under the Act of 1903, and can be fully accomplished by\r\nreverting to the principles of that Act.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to reform procedure within the House of\r\nCommons and all of them have proved inadequate. Owing to an actual\r\nincrease of business, and to the growing complexity of domestic affairs,\r\nParliament is over-burdened with work to a far greater extent to-day than\r\nit was in the seventies and eighties. Since those days the idea of union\r\non federal lines in the Mother Country, as not only desirable in her\r\ninterest, but as also indicating the path to some larger form of union,\r\nhas become prevalent. It has become more and more evident that some scheme\r\nof devolution is necessary to enable the Parliamentary machine to deal\r\nwith the great industrial questions that perplex us, and to give adequate\r\nconsideration to the problems of Imperial policy which press for\r\nconsideration. Under these circumstances it is indeed extraordinary that\r\nthis great question has not been settled in the only way by which, in my\r\nhumble opinion, it can be settled satisfactorily and permanently, namely,\r\nby consent of both the great parties in the State; and it is passing\r\nstrange to see the leaders of one of the great parties, despite the\r\nopinions of their predecessors in title, taking up an irreconcilable\r\nattitude towards devolution of any kind. It would be most interesting, but\r\nimpossible, within the scope of this article to consider how far\r\ncontemporaneous events in Ireland, faulty tactics on the part of Irish\r\npoliticians, and the exigencies of party political warfare are\r\nrespectively chargeable with this lamentable legislative default. The fact\r\nis the question has never been considered on its merits. The party system\r\nis probably the principal offender, but impatience on the part of the\r\nIrish people, vagueness in the demands put forward by their leaders,\r\ninconvenient alliances, vacillating counsels, a short-sighted policy, and\r\nmistaken tactics are much to blame.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious circumstance in the historical development of this policy,\r\nthat Devolutionists in going forward have come back to the standpoint of\r\nthe greatest leader the Tory party ever had. Speaking in the House of\r\nCommons in 1844, Mr. Disraeli is reported in _Hansard_ as saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I always thought that the greatest cause of misery in Ireland was\r\n    identity of institutions with England. It has become a great\r\n    historical aphorism that Ireland is to be the great difficulty of\r\n    the Minister. Now this is an opinion in which I never shared. I\r\n    never believed that Ireland would be a great difficulty, because I\r\n    felt certain that a Minister of great ability and of great power\r\n    would, when he found himself at the head of a great majority,\r\n    settle that question. What, then, is the duty of the English\r\n    Minister? To effect by his policy all those changes which a\r\n    revolution would do by force. That is the Irish question in its\r\n    integrity. It is quite evident that to effect this we must have an\r\n    Executive in Ireland which shall bear a much nearer relation to\r\n    the leading parties and characters of the country than it does at\r\n    present.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThese principles Mr. Disraeli declared to be “Tory principles, the\r\nnational principles of the democracy of England.” When a quarter of a\r\ncentury later, and holding a most responsible position, he was challenged\r\nin the House of Commons as to this statement of his views, he still\r\ndeclared that: “in my historical conscience the sentiment of that speech\r\nwas right.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III. CONTEMPORARY VIEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.—Irish Nationalism And Liberal Principle. BY PROFESSOR L. T. HOBHOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the nineteenth century the cause of subject nationalities was\r\na constant stimulus to British Liberalism. Successive generations hoped\r\nand feared, wept and rejoiced with the rebels of Greece, of Italy, of\r\nHungary, of Poland, of the Balkans. Their successes and failures were\r\nevents of moment in the calendar of British Liberalism, for they were\r\nrecognised as essential parts of the democratic movement, and the\r\ndemocratic cause was in that century looked upon as one all the world\r\nover. Nor was this sentiment ineffective. The moral support of England was\r\nin those days recognised as an asset to a cause. Individuals gave direct\r\nand tangible assistance, and there were even times when diplomacy moved.\r\nNationalism, therefore, lay close to the heart of Liberalism. Yet there\r\nwas all the time one nationality whose claims were not so readily\r\nunderstood as those of Greek or Italian, Pole or Bulgar. Ireland was\r\nraising a cry, protesting against grievances, formulating demands, which\r\nto impartial ears sounded very like those of other subject peoples. Here\r\nit seemed was an oppressed nationality at the British Liberal’s own door,\r\nwith grievances which he could redress by his own efforts if he would.\r\nConscious—perhaps a little too conscious—of the rectitude of his\r\nintentions, the British Liberal had some difficulty in seeing himself in\r\nthe light of an oppressor. But under Mr. Gladstone’s leadership he learned\r\nhis lesson in two stages. He began by learning that there were very real\r\ngrievances to be redressed, grievances resulting from the political\r\nsubordination of Ireland, in particular the grievances of the Church\r\nEstablishment and of the land system. But in the course of his remedial\r\nefforts he learned further that though oppressive government may do much\r\nto hold a nationality together, the redress of grievances does not\r\nnecessarily loosen the bonds of national unity. While the Government of\r\n1880-85 still oscillated between concession and coercion, the more\r\nadventurous minds began to realize that what they had preached for Italy,\r\nHungary, and Poland must in its due measure, and with all reasonable\r\nregard to variation of circumstances, be offered to the Irish people. They\r\nwere ready for the second stage upon which Mr. Gladstone entered at the\r\nend of 1885, and in which, after a brief and memorable struggle, he\r\ncarried with him the bulk of the Liberal Party. They had learned that the\r\nsolution of the Irish question lay not in repressing Irish nationality,\r\nbut in trusting it with the responsibility of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe Unionist leaders who defeated Mr. Gladstone had nevertheless learnt\r\nfrom him the first of these two lessons. They acquired by degrees a\r\nworking knowledge of the material grievances of Ireland, and bit by bit\r\nthey dealt with them, confident that by so doing they would undermine the\r\nfoundations of the national demand. They reached the first stage of\r\nLiberal education, but refused to advance beyond it. Time, however, has\r\ndeclared against them. The twenty years of resolute government which Lord\r\nSalisbury once demanded have gone by, broken only by the three years in\r\nthe ’nineties, when Liberals held office without legislative power.\r\nIreland is orderly, and, by comparison with the past, prosperous. But\r\nIreland is still Nationalist. The result is to leave the main arguments\r\nfor Home Rule standing, while several of the old arguments against it are\r\nweakened or brought to naught. The Irish community is economically more\r\nvigorous, and so far more capable of self-support than it was in 1886. It\r\nis no longer a society which can be represented as honeycombed with\r\nconspiracies, or given up to disorder. It is no longer in the grip of a\r\nland system which necessitated an agrarian revolution, either as the\r\nprecursor or as the first act of a self-governing Parliament. It is no\r\nlonger so overtaxed that to maintain the fiscal balance with Great Britain\r\nwould be to impose a permanent tribute on the smaller and poorer island.\r\nBut it remains Nationalist, and the unsatisfied national sentiment of\r\nIreland remains not only a reproach to British Liberalism, but a flaw in\r\nthe fabric of our national security.\r\n\r\nI dwell on the permanence of Irish nationalism, because in dealing with\r\nnationality, we are confronted with one of those political forces which\r\nmay be very real and very stubborn, but which yet are neither measurable\r\nin statistics nor easily compressed into the four corners of a rigid\r\ndefinition. What precisely is a nationality, it may be asked, and why\r\nshould it be so much a matter of concern to Liberals? Liberalism is for\r\nself-government, it is true, but, provided that all parts of a country or\r\nof an empire are equally represented on a democratic franchise in the\r\ngoverning assembly of the whole, what has the principle of liberty to say\r\nfurther in the matter? Why should it be on the side of division or against\r\nunity? It is not ever so. On the contrary, national jealousies, rival\r\npatriotisms are constantly thwarting another branch of Liberal endeavour.\r\nIt must be frankly recognised that the development of nationality in\r\nEurope is in large measure responsible for the modern recrudescence of\r\nmilitarism. As a policy of peace and international goodwill, Liberalism\r\nhas to make some sacrifices, and take some risks in upholding nationality.\r\nWhat does it gain in return? If its ideal is humanitarian, why must it\r\ncountenance the national idea, self-centred and intolerant as the idea too\r\noften becomes?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question is written in the history of the dealings of\r\nGovernments with subject nationalities, Irish or other. The primary object\r\nof political Liberalism is to found Government on freedom. This end is not\r\ncompassed at a stroke by the simple method of establishing a well-oiled\r\nrepresentative machine. It involves, to deal with externals only, freedom\r\nof speech, of writing, of meeting, of organisation. It involves the\r\nsecurity of personal rights as much against the Executive Government as\r\nagainst any private aggression. But when a larger nation forcibly\r\nincorporates a smaller one in its system it is easy to see the difficulty\r\nof maintaining order on these lines. A free government in the full sense\r\nof the term must be founded on the voluntary adhesion of the mass of the\r\npeople. This adhesion is not necessarily impaired by the conflicts of\r\ninterest or conviction which are the inevitable incidents of public life\r\nin any community, and which compel now one section and now another to\r\nsubmit to laws or acts of government which it resents. As long as each\r\nclass feels that its claims, even if overborne in the end, will not be\r\nrejected without adequate understanding and fair consideration, there\r\nexist the elements of government by consent. But a smaller nation forcibly\r\nincorporated in a larger one does not feel this. The very constitution\r\nwhich is the pride of its masters is the badge of its own subjection. It\r\nmay have equality of franchise, but its representatives are in a permanent\r\nminority. By history, by sentiment, perhaps by religion, race, or\r\nlanguage, it has acquired differences of tone and habit. It regards public\r\nquestions from a different angle. Its emphasis is different, its\r\nessentials are trifles to other people, and their essentials are its\r\ntrifles. Its problems, even when on the surface they appear the same, have\r\na different historic background, are interwoven with special associations,\r\ncomplicated with local and peculiar sympathies and animosities. With these\r\nnuances the smaller nation can never hope that the majority will deal,\r\nbecause the majority can never understand them. Not only so but the\r\nsmaller people will have a pride, memory, and hope of its own. It may have\r\na larger patriotism if its self respect is first consulted, but as long as\r\nits independent being is ignored its only collective ambition will be to\r\nassert itself. Thus in the subject people the milk of social feeling is\r\nturned to gall. All that leads a free people to respect law, to support\r\nGovernment, to take pride in public prosperity, to sacrifice personal to\r\ncommon interest, will work in this case only towards discord and civil\r\nstrife, and the best men become in a sense the worst citizens. At least\r\nthey become the most resolute opponents of the established order. The more\r\nopposition develops, and this means the more life flourishes in the\r\nsubject people, the more the tension increases. Presently definite\r\nobstructions arise in the machinery of Government and the ruling\r\ndemocracy, however liberal in its original intentions, is driven into\r\n“exceptional” legislation. Constitutional rights are curtailed. Legal\r\nsecurities are suspended, freedom of speech is withheld. These\r\ndisabilities may either be confined to the disaffected people, in which\r\ncase the principle of equal rights disappears, or to save appearances as\r\nto equality they are made universal, in which case general liberty is\r\nimpaired. In either event this original condition is set at naught. The\r\nessentials of political liberty are violated. Wise and moderate\r\nstatesmanship may mitigate the mischief. Reactionary statesmanship may\r\ninflame it. But the seeds of trouble will always be there as long as the\r\nforeign body is embedded in the organic tissues.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, are we always to give way to sectional feeling?\r\nHistory has interwoven many races and they must surely learn to live\r\ntogether. What of French and British in Canada, or of British and Dutch in\r\nSouth Africa? What again of Ulster? If Ireland is a nation, does the\r\nnation include the Protestant half of Ulster or does it not? If yes, how\r\ncan any of our tests of unity stand? If not, how can we recognize Ireland\r\nas one nation and not as two? Let us take these questions in turn, and let\r\nus consider first the measure and importance to be attached to national\r\nsentiment. We are dealing here, it has been admitted, with a force which\r\nit is impossible to measure _a príorí_ by any external tests. We seem able\r\nto judge it only by the event. If in fact Irish nationalism had yielded to\r\nthe redress of definite grievances, if it had been practically possible to\r\nkill Home Rule by kindness, Unionist statesmanship would have been\r\njustified. I do not say justified by success, for success is not a judge\r\ngiving decision by rules of equity. It would have been justified rather in\r\nthe sense that it would have been experimentally proved to have been\r\nfounded on a true interpretation of the case. The Unionist case—at its\r\nbest—was that Irish nationalism was a passing and superficial sentiment.\r\nAt its core were certain real grievances, but it was swollen into a mass\r\nof imposing appearances, but of loose and flabby texture. The plan was to\r\nremove the grievances with one hand, while with the other every ebullition\r\nof sentiment into unruly speech or action was steadily repressed. Had the\r\nplan succeeded it would have shown that Irish nationality was an illusion,\r\nor at best a thin and insubstantial product of a passing historical phase.\r\nIn so far as it has failed it has shown that Irish nationality is a\r\nreality, deep rooted in the past, and to be reckoned with permanently in\r\nthe future. In a word the test of nationality lies in history. If the life\r\nof one people can be absorbed into that of another so that free Government\r\ncan proceed unimpeded, not violated by the habitual resort to “exceptional\r\nlegislation,” the union is justified by the event. If on the other hand\r\nthe demand for autonomy remains clear and persistent, through evil report\r\nand good report, through coercion and concession, through adversity and\r\nprosperity, in days of disorder when despair has reigned and in law\r\nabiding times rendered calm by hope, there is the proof that nationality\r\nis a vital principle, and a permanent force with which liberty must make\r\nits account.\r\n\r\nHow is it then that by the gift of autonomy, time has succeeded in fusing\r\nFrench and British peoples into the nation of Canada, and why do we see a\r\nsimilar fusion proceeding between British and Dutch in South Africa? The\r\nquestion arises partly out of the common confusion between race and\r\nnationality. Race is a matter of physical kinship, and kinship is one of\r\nthe bonds that tend to unite people and at the same time in a measure to\r\nseparate them from others. But it is only one bond among many. Most modern\r\nnations, our own conspicuously, are blends of many races, and are united\r\nnot so much by common ancestry as by the possession of a common country,\r\ncommon interests, common traditions, a common mode of life and sentiment.\r\nFurther, where two or more races are intermixed, there is no means of\r\nendowing them with independent Governments. The same writ must run over\r\nthe whole territory. Hence there are three possibilities. One is that one\r\nrace should hold the reins of power, as generally happens when white and\r\nblack live together. Another is that the country should be governed from\r\nwithout, and this will generally mean that the administration leans on one\r\nof the races within, and makes of it an “Ascendency” caste. The third is\r\nthat the two races should seek to live together and govern themselves with\r\nmutual toleration. This is the experiment which has succeeded in Canada,\r\nand is succeeding so far as the white races are concerned in South Africa,\r\nand which is to be tried in Ireland. In proportion as it succeeds the two\r\nraces blend, and a new nationality is formed.\r\n\r\nBut still it may be asked, why should not Ulster claim to be a nation?\r\nTrue, she is but a fragment of Ireland, but then Ireland is but a fragment\r\nof the United Kingdom, and St. George’s Channel is not so very formidable\r\na dividing line as to make all the difference. Our whole argument, it may\r\nbe said, has rested on the rights of minorities, and Ulster is a minority.\r\nWhy should not Ulster also be a nation? This at once suggests the\r\ncounter-question, does Ulster claim to be a nation? Let us bear in mind\r\nthat the term Ulster is a mode of speech, and that what is meant by it for\r\nthese purposes is half Ulster, or the city of Belfast with some adjacent\r\ncounties. Does Belfast, we should more rightly ask, profess and call\r\nitself a nation? Not if its desire is, what we have always understood it\r\nto be, to remain directly subject to the British Parliament. It is in\r\nfact, the focus of an old, but decayed Ascendency caste, and its desire is\r\nto retain what it can save from the wreck of the Ascendency system. With\r\nthis demand Liberalism can have no sort of sympathy. If Belfast would\r\ncondescend to put her case with a little more moderation, and a little\r\nallowance for the two sides of the question, it would be easier to meet\r\nher views. As long as she declines to make her account with the fact that\r\nthe great majority of Ireland is Nationalist, and that British Liberalism\r\nis resolved to do justice at last to nationalism, she rules herself out of\r\nthe discussion, and leaves it to British statesmen to act for her rather\r\nthan with her. Belfast is a Protestant and industrial centre in a land\r\nwhich is predominantly Catholic and agricultural. On both counts she may\r\nfear some inequality of treatment, and on both may legitimately receive\r\nguarantees. On the major question, that of religion, every Home Rule\r\nscheme has proposed ample guarantees and the present Bill does not fall\r\nshort under this head. The problem of financial and commercial interests\r\nis more complex, but it is difficult to see how an Irish Parliament,\r\nresponsible for the financial soundness of the country, could do anything\r\nto cripple the industries of Belfast without being fully aware that in so\r\ndoing it would be killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. The\r\ndiscussion of this question, however, I must leave to those who are\r\ndealing with the financial provisions of the Bill. On the main point we\r\nmay ask whether, if the Bill is to pass, Belfast will deliberately and\r\npersistently demand to be left out of its scope, and separated from\r\nIreland in the sense and degree in which Ireland will be separated from\r\nthe direct control of Great Britain. If such a demand is put forward not\r\nmerely in order to wreck Home Rule, but as a substantive proposal\r\nseriously intended, it will constitute a new fact. Belfast will then be,\r\nindeed, claiming recognition as a miniature nationality, and the claim\r\nwill be fairly weighed. At present it can only be regarded as highly\r\nimprobable that such a claim should be maintained or even put forward\r\nexcept in a fighting mood. That Belfast should sustain her opposition to\r\nthe whole Bill is perfectly natural, but given that there is to be Home\r\nRule as one of the fixed conditions of a settlement, her natural position\r\nis that of a centre and rallying point for the dispersed forces of Irish\r\nProtestantism. That this is her true function in the Irish Parliament,\r\nBelfast must be as well aware as she is that her influence in that\r\nParliament will be more than proportionate to her numerical strength.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of nationality as a centrifugal force, as one of the\r\ninfluences tending to division. But there is another side to the question.\r\nWhen a nation obtains self-government it undertakes a new responsibility.\r\nIt must keep its own peace, balance its own finances, have regard to its\r\nown common economic interests. This common responsibility does not make\r\nfor division. It makes for unity. It enforces a sober regard for the\r\nclaims of each part. It dictates a measure of mutual consideration which\r\nis not developed as long as one party within the country is taught to lean\r\nupon an outside power. In the past history of Ireland each party has alike\r\nbeen taught constantly to look to Westminster for its wants, to\r\nWestminster for redress of grievances, to Westminster perhaps for\r\nvengeance on its foes or at lowest for the means of keeping them in order.\r\nThis is not the atmosphere in which mutual toleration grows. When Irishmen\r\nunderstand that they must go of themselves unaided and uncontrolled from\r\nwithout they will learn like other men that they must pull together if\r\nthey are to keep off the rocks. The national element will have the\r\nmajority in the Irish Parliament, and the first object of this element\r\nwill be to make Home Rule a success. That they can do only by securing the\r\nco-operation, even if it be the grudging and unadmitted co-operation, of\r\nthe opposition. But Belfast is not bound to content herself with these\r\ngeneral probabilities. She has only to formulate intelligible demands\r\nconsistent with the establishment of a Dublin Parliament to be assured of\r\na respectful and considerate hearing. If she would be content to rest her\r\ncase on the same basis as that of Irish nationalism itself, recognising\r\nthat nationalism must have its rights and submitting only that she in turn\r\nis a lesser nation within a nation, it would be possible to deal with her.\r\nAs long as she stands on her own claims she rules herself out of the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThere are many who regard the recognition of nationality as at best a\r\nregrettable necessity. They lay stress on those centrifugal tendencies\r\nthat we have admitted and they feel that the greater need of mankind is\r\nfor unity. But the unity which they desire can only come through the\r\ndevelopment of life in many different centres and with luxuriant\r\ndivergencies of character. The doctrine of Mazzini that every nation had\r\nits own peculiar function to fulfil in the life of humanity was not pure\r\nfancy. It is easy to recognise that the leading modern nations have each,\r\nin fact, contributed something distinctive, something that would have been\r\nblurred and dulled if all had been of one speech and under one rule.\r\nDivision has meant unrest, friction, war, and suffering. But it has been a\r\nnecessary condition of collective vitality. Self-respect and\r\nself-confidence are necessary to a people that are to do great things, and\r\nthese they cannot enjoy to the full so long as they are conscious of a\r\nmastery that galls their pride. Ireland has contributed to our literature\r\nher peculiar strain of humour and of romance, tinged with the melancholy\r\nof her historic ill-fortune. The graver tone and gentler view she will\r\nnever lose, for they belong to a people who will always have behind them\r\nthe memory of the centuries of that undeserved suffering which opens the\r\neyes of men to the nature of the human tragedy. But the distinctive Irish\r\nquality may henceforward be shot with a brighter thread catching the light\r\nfrom her assured future as a nation. As a nation she has her part to play\r\nin the English-speaking Commonwealth, questioning the successful\r\npracticality of a dominant people with the irony, and tempering its prose\r\nwith the romance born in the centuries of her probation in the valley of\r\nthe shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.—The Imperial Parliament\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(I) The State Of Parliamentary Business. BY CECIL HARMSWORTH, M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one argument for conferring self-government on the people of\r\nIreland that appeals with irresistible force to many ordinary members of\r\nImperial Parliament. This is the urgent necessity for relieving Imperial\r\nParliament of “provincial” business and setting it free to devote its best\r\nenergies to the ever-increasing legislative and administrative needs of\r\nthe empire.\r\n\r\nEvery year the amount of business that falls to be transacted in the House\r\nof Commons grows in volume. Every year fresh proofs are afforded that the\r\nlegislative machinery of the House of Commons is not only unequal to the\r\nstrain imposed by the growing volume of business, but that it is incapable\r\neven of dealing effectively with the affairs that have always been\r\nregarded as coming within its special province. For instance, the House of\r\nCommons has practically lost all control over the details of finance. It\r\nis true that a fairly generous allowance of Parliamentary time is allotted\r\nto the Estimates, but the House rarely, if ever, comes to close grips with\r\nthe nation’s balance sheet, or indeed with the details of any particular\r\nvote. Yet a vigilant supervision over finance is one of the primary\r\nfunctions of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nHow far the recently established Select Committee on Estimates will be\r\nable to assist in promoting national economy remains to be seen. The\r\ncreation of such a body has not met with universal approval in the House\r\nitself. As in the case of all parliamentary Committees, no matter how\r\ninfluential their _personnel_, the House as a whole may not be found\r\nwilling to accept the decisions of the new Select Committee as\r\nauthoritative.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of Bill legislation, the condition of things is even worse.\r\nNotwithstanding the desperate shifts which have been resorted to in recent\r\nyears to secure the dispatch of business, we are confronted in every\r\nsucceeding session with greater congestion in the House of Commons. Big\r\nBills are hustled through with the aid of every undesirable expedient\r\nknown to parliamentary procedure, and little Bills in pathetic shoals are\r\nmassacred at the end of each session. The plain fact is that we have not\r\nsufficient time in which to do anything properly. No matter what strain we\r\nimpose on the physical endurance of Members, no matter how far we invade\r\nthe undoubted privileges of the House of Commons as a deliberative\r\nassembly, Parliament is less and less able to fulfil its manifold duties\r\nas the paramount legislature in a world-wide state. The damage to local\r\ninterests is scarcely less serious. Irish finance, for instance, and Irish\r\nlegislation suffer from the disability of Imperial Parliament to give them\r\ndue consideration.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed that the House of Commons is unconscious of its own\r\ndemerits as a legislative machine. It is nearly sixty years since Sir John\r\nPakington’s Committee was appointed to consider “whether by any alteration\r\nin the forms and proceedings of this House, the dispatch of public\r\nbusiness would be more effectually promoted.” Committees with similar\r\nreferences were set up in 1861, in 1878, and in 1886. As a result of these\r\ninquiries two Standing Committees were established at the instance of Mr.\r\nW. H. Smith in 1888. The relegation of measures of the second rank to the\r\ntwo Standing Committees was expected to lighten the legislative burdens of\r\nthe House of Commons very considerably, and this result was in some\r\nmeasure achieved. But the problem of congestion was so far from being\r\nsolved that it was thought necessary to appoint yet another Committee (Sir\r\nHenry Fowler’s) in 1906. This Committee recommended the setting up of four\r\nStanding Committees, and it is under this system that we are now working.\r\nWith considerable diffidence I advance the opinion that an even larger use\r\nof Standing Committees might be made than has yet been attempted. Part II.\r\nof the National Insurance Bill was sent “upstairs,” and the result amply\r\njustified what was regarded by cautious Parliamentarians as a daring\r\nexperiment. But this part of the Insurance Bill was in a large degree\r\nuncontroversial. The House of Commons is jealous, and naturally jealous,\r\nof its rights over controversial measures of the first class, and has\r\nnever yet shown any readiness to accept as conclusive the decisions of\r\nStanding Committees. Nor should it be forgotten that attendance on a\r\nStanding Committee imposes a severe strain on members who are also keenly\r\ninterested in the business of the House itself. By the time Mr. Speaker\r\ntakes the chair at a quarter to three o’clock, the members of such\r\nCommittees have often completed a very fair day’s work.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, other and more questionable expedients for facilitating the\r\ndispatch of business were coming into general use. It is to Mr. Joseph\r\nRonayne, a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party in the ’seventies of\r\nlast century, that we owe the policy of organised and scientific\r\nobstruction in the House of Commons, and, as a consequence, the drastic\r\nuse of the closure. Mr. Ronayne was a back-bench member of the Irish\r\nParty, of unobtrusive manners but of settled opinions. He was profoundly\r\ndissatisfied with the unaggressive tactics of Mr. Isaac Butt, the then\r\nleader of the Irish Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We will never make any impression on the House,” he said, “until\r\n    we interfere in English business. At present Englishmen manage\r\n    their own affairs in their own way, without any interference from\r\n    us. Then, when we want to get our business through, they stop us.\r\n    We ought to show them that two can play at this game of\r\n    obstruction. Let us interfere in English legislation; let us show\r\n    them that if we are not strong enough to get our own work done, we\r\n    are strong enough to prevent them from getting theirs.”(159)\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ronayne found in Mr. Joseph Gillis Biggar an apt pupil. Mr. Biggar\r\nused to say: “The English stop our Bills. Why don’t we stop their Bills?\r\nThat’s the thing to do. No Irish Bills; but stop English Bills. No\r\nlegislation; that’s the policy, sir, that’s the policy. Butt’s a fool, too\r\ngentlemanly; we’re all too gentlemanly.” Mr. Biggar’s oratory is happily\r\nnow only a tradition. It was not good oratory of any kind, but it effected\r\nits purpose. More skilful exponents of the art of obstruction have\r\nappeared since Mr. Biggar’s day, but none more successful. The expedient\r\nmay have been justifiable in the case of a small minority struggling\r\nunavailingly against an overwhelming and indifferent majority. It is quite\r\ntrue that during the mild reign of Mr. Butt the British political parties\r\ntreated legislative proposals emanating from the Irish Parliamentary Party\r\nwith scant courtesy. It is equally true that obstruction in the House of\r\nCommons proved a potent incentive to the more careful consideration of\r\nIrish claims. We have travelled far since those days, but obstruction\r\nremains as one of the most formidable weapons in the armoury of an\r\nopposition. The British political parties have, when in opposition, made\r\nfull use of a device that Mr. Butt regarded as “undignified, useless, and\r\nmischievous.” And not only is obstruction with us, but its hateful if\r\nnecessary corollary, the closure, has tended every year to become more\r\noppressive. The parliamentary historian of the future will note that it\r\nwas on June 10th, 1887, that “closure by guillotine,” that monstrous\r\nvariant of an accursed type, was first proposed in the House of Commons. A\r\nfew days later the guillotine fell on several of the most important\r\nclauses of a new Crimes Bill. So closely associated with Ireland are the\r\nmost recent and most detrimental changes in the procedure that governs the\r\ndebates in our Imperial Parliament!\r\n\r\nObstruction or no obstruction, closure by guillotine or by compartments\r\nhas come to stay as long as our Parliament attempts the otherwise\r\nimpossible task of legislating for several provinces, and an empire at the\r\nsame time. Nowadays almost every great Bill is subjected sooner or later\r\nto the guillotine. Let us see what this means. A debate in Committee, let\r\nus say, has been in progress for some days or weeks. Discussion has been\r\nfree, and only occasionally, perhaps, has the ordinary form of closure\r\nbeen exercised. A bare half dozen clauses have been disposed of. There\r\nremain four or five score more clauses and a motley group of schedules. It\r\nbecomes obvious that unless something is done to speed up the machinery,\r\nthe Bill will never get through the House. Then it is that the leader of\r\nthe House braces himself to his most unwelcome task, and, rising in his\r\nplace, proposes a rigid time-table for the discussion of the remaining\r\nclauses and schedules. A certain number of days are allotted, and to each\r\nportion of time is allotted a section of the Bill. Thus, a whole\r\nParliamentary day may be allotted to three clauses. The whole of this day,\r\nperhaps, is spent in debating the first line of the first of the three\r\nclauses. However this may be, the guillotine falls with remorseless\r\nseverity at the end of the allotted day, and only Government amendments to\r\nthe undiscussed parts of the three clauses are taken. Could anything be\r\nmore clumsy? Was it possible for the ingenuity of man to invent a less\r\nbusinesslike remedy for the congestion of business in Parliament? Indeed,\r\nthe absurdity of the system is universally acknowledged. I know of no more\r\ndistressing spectacle than that of the leader of the House of Commons\r\nexerting himself to excuse a policy that he, in common with all who\r\nreverence the House of Commons, holds in detestation. On such occasions as\r\nthis, the arguments advanced for what is confessedly a rude invasion of\r\nthe rights of free speech are of a set pattern. It is urged that the\r\ndebate has now been in progress for so many days or weeks, and that little\r\nadvance has been made. Regret is expressed that resort should be had to\r\nsuch an unpopular device as the guillotine. But by what other means, it is\r\nasked, is a Government to carry controversial measures? After all, the\r\ntime-table proposed is a generous one, having regard to all the\r\ncircumstances of the case, and is certainly more generous than that\r\nallowed by the party opposite on such and such an occasion in the past.\r\nThe leader of the Opposition, in rising, lays his hand on his heart and\r\ncalls the House to witness that if on former occasions he has made use of\r\nthe guillotine, he has done so far less frequently than the head of the\r\npresent administration, and with an entire absence of the levity that\r\nmarks the present proceedings. The guillotine resolution is carried. There\r\nare ineffectual ebullitions of wrath on the opposition side of the House,\r\nand there are sinking hearts on the Ministerial Benches. On every such\r\noccasion it is felt in all parts of the House that a deadly blow has been\r\naimed at the dignity and the prestige of Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut the House of Commons is meant to be a deliberative assembly! It holds\r\nstill the highest place among the democratic assemblies of the world, and\r\nits rules and forms and customs have been adopted with unquestioning\r\nveneration, wherever democratic communities have set up legislating for\r\nthemselves. In point of _personnel_, recent Parliaments have shown no\r\nfalling off from the standards of other days. In manners, in public\r\nspirit, in devotion to parliamentary duty, and in the range of their\r\nknowledge and experience, the members of the present Parliament compare\r\nmost favourably with their predecessors in any Parliament in our history.\r\nIf they are gagged and closured and guillotined, it is not because their\r\nspeeches would be unworthy of the place or of the occasion. The simple\r\nreason is that there is no time for them. The mother of Parliaments is\r\ntrying to do the work of four or five Parliaments, and is signally failing\r\nin the attempt.\r\n\r\nLet this be noted. Though the outcry against the guillotine closure,\r\nwhenever it is proposed to be exercised, is loudest on the opposition side\r\nof the House, the guillotine operates just as much to the disadvantage of\r\nprivate members on the Government side. They are expected to support the\r\nGovernment Bill in broad outline, but they are under no obligation to\r\nsupport it in every detail. They entertain, and are entitled to entertain,\r\ntheir own views as to points of detail, and are no more willing than\r\nmembers opposite that their pet amendments should be sacrificed\r\narbitrarily at the end of an allotted day. Indeed, since they are, _ex\r\nhypothesi_, devoted to the main principles of the Bill, they are likely to\r\nbe even more solicitous than members of the Opposition that the Bill\r\nshould be as perfect in detail as in its general scope. Little wonder that\r\nunder the operation of the guillotine, private Ministerial members tend\r\nmore and more to become passive and, in the long run, indifferent\r\nspectators of the drama that is enacted on the floor of the House when a\r\ngreat Bill is going through, and it is in this respect and not in any\r\nother, I think, that modern Parliaments are inferior to others.\r\n\r\nThere are other aspects of the question that might be dwelt on at some\r\nlength, if this were the proper occasion. Since it is recognised in all\r\nparts of the House that a great measure is not and cannot be adequately\r\ndiscussed under the guillotine closure, a dangerous practice has grown up\r\nof leaving difficult matters to be decided by Government departments or by\r\nnew authorities set up under the Act. Under the National Insurance Act,\r\nfor instance, the Commissioners are invested for certain purposes with all\r\nthe legislative prerogatives of the three estates of the realm! I must\r\nleave that matter to the constitutional authorities. I am concerned for\r\nthe moment merely to show that the guillotine closure is a clumsy,\r\nunbusinesslike, and dangerous expedient that cannot be regarded as having\r\nsolved in any satisfactory degree the eternal problem of congestion in a\r\nParliament that attempts to cope at the same time with the local affairs\r\nof three or four provinces, and with the affairs of an empire.\r\n\r\nRelief might doubtless be found in the more frequent use of what is known\r\nas the “kangaroo” closure. This method of dealing with business in\r\nCommittee was first regularized in 1908. Under this system, power is given\r\nto the Chairman to select such Amendments as he believes to be really\r\nimportant, to the exclusion of others. The burden of responsibility thus\r\nthrown on the Chair is felt to be enormous, and it is chiefly on this\r\naccount that the kangaroo closure has been very sparingly exercised.\r\n\r\nI say that the setting up of four Standing Committees, and the institution\r\nof the guillotine closure have so far failed to relieve appreciably the\r\npressure of business in the House of Commons. Another method has been\r\ntried that might reasonably have been expected to produce more fruitful\r\nresults. I refer to the prolongation of the session of Parliament. In 1906\r\nwe had an autumn sitting. In 1907 we sat until August 28th. In 1908 we had\r\nan autumn sitting. In 1909 we sat for practically the whole year. The\r\nsession of 1910 was agreeably diversified by a strenuously contested\r\nGeneral Election at either end of it. In 1911 we had yet another autumn\r\nsitting, and this year we are threatened with a continuous session\r\nextending from February until Christmas time. True enough, a good part of\r\nthe work of these sessions was wasted by the action of a House of Lords\r\nwhich has since lost some of its powers for obstructive mischief, but it\r\nwill be observed that of the first class measures destroyed by the Lords,\r\nonly two—the Education Bill (in a different form), and the Scotch Small\r\nHolders Bill—have subsequently made considerable demands on the attention\r\nof the House of Commons. The time gained by extending the sittings of\r\nthese several Parliaments has been chiefly wanted for new legislation.\r\nEven if the House of Lords had found it convenient to pass the Liberal\r\nmeasures which it rejected, the pressure of business in the House of\r\nCommons must have necessitated the resort to autumn sittings in two or\r\nthree of the years under consideration. Now, it is a commonplace that\r\nautumn sittings are permissible only in very exceptional circumstances.\r\nFrom the point of view of all Members of Parliament, autumn sittings are\r\nan unqualified disadvantage. Members, like other folk, want their\r\nholidays, and, unlike other folk, have constituencies to look after.\r\nMinisters of the Crown who are members of the House of Commons stand in\r\neven greater need of holidays than private members, and are not less under\r\nobligation to cultivate their constituencies. In addition, they need\r\nleisure for the preparation of the great Government measures that are to\r\nfigure in the King’s Speech, Departmental Bills for the ensuing session,\r\nand generally for the overhauling of the work of their departments. It is\r\nastonishing that the work of the great administrative departments should\r\nhave been done so well in recent years when regard is had to the extreme\r\npressure under which Ministers have been working. If Sir H.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman and Mr. Asquith had not had at their command an\r\nabundance of administrative talent of a high quality, there must have been\r\nduring the last six years many cases of failure in the management of the\r\nimportant Parliamentary Offices of State. One of the chief functions of a\r\nParliamentary Minister in charge of a department is the infusion of new\r\nideas, the re-assembling and adaptation of old machinery, the bringing up\r\nto date of an organisation that may have served its purpose well in the\r\npast but is no longer adequate to the enlarged requirements of modern\r\ntimes. For such work as this there must be time for cool deliberation. It\r\nis scarcely possible for the most capable Minister to devise schemes of\r\nadministrative reform amidst the excited rumours of the lobbies and the\r\ninnumerable distractions of life in the House of Commons. Less responsible\r\nmembers of the House of Commons than Ministers find that it is well-nigh\r\nimpossible to think clearly during the session of Parliament.\r\n\r\nOther methods have been proposed for saving time in an overburdened House\r\nof Commons. There is the proposal that measures that have reached a\r\ncertain incomplete stage in one session should be revived at the same\r\nstage in the next session of the same Parliament. A Select Committee of\r\nunusual authority discussed this matter in 1890. Among the members of the\r\nCommittee were Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Balfour, Mr. Chamberlain, Mr. John\r\nMorley, Mr. Goschen, Sir William Harcourt, the Marquis of Hartington, Mr.\r\nDillon, Sir Edward Clarke, Mr. T. W. Russell, Mr. Labouchere, and Mr.\r\nSexton. Proposals for abridging the procedure on partly considered Bills\r\nhad been mooted in 1848, in 1861, and again in 1869, but the objects in\r\nview of the earlier Committees entirely differed from those of the\r\nCommittee of 1890. The proposal emanated from the House of Lords, and the\r\noriginal design was to give the Upper House power to hang up Bills coming\r\nfrom the House of Commons. The Lords complained, as they have often\r\ncomplained since, that Bills were sent up to them at a period of the\r\nsession too late to admit of the exercise of the Lords’ rights of revision\r\nand amendment. They urged, too, and with some force, that Bills were\r\nfrequently sent up to them which had not been adequately discussed in the\r\nlower House. They desired, therefore, to possess themselves of the power\r\nto hold over such Bills to another session. Needless to say, such a\r\nproposal as this excited fierce opposition in the House of Commons, and\r\nthe deliberations of 1848, 1861, and 1869 came to nothing. The Committee\r\nof 1890 set out with wholly different intentions. Its object was merely to\r\nobviate reiterated arguments in the House of Commons on the same subjects\r\nand to save the time of the House. Thanks in a large measure to Mr.\r\nBalfour’s advocacy the Committee reported that the carrying over of Bills\r\nshould become the practice of the House, as it is indeed the practice of\r\nalmost every Parliament in Europe. A formidable minority, however, led by\r\nMr. Gladstone, reported against the proposal, and nothing has yet been\r\ndone to give effect to the wishes of the majority. To this day the\r\n“massacre of the innocents” is a melancholy feature of our proceedings at\r\nthe end of a session. I doubt myself whether “carrying over” will ever be\r\nadopted as a part of the established and regular practice of the House of\r\nCommons. Ministers look with cold disfavour on the proposal. They are\r\ngenerally suspicious of private members’ little Bills, and private members\r\nthemselves are not ordinarily enthusiastic about the legislative bantlings\r\nof other private members.\r\n\r\nOne other remedy has been suggested for hastening the dispatch of business\r\nin the House of Commons—the limitation of speeches. For every member who\r\nmade speeches in the House of Commons half a century ago fifty make\r\nspeeches now. It is not, I think, that we are more loquacious than our\r\nancestors or more greedy of the ready publicity that is accorded to any\r\nsort of speech in Parliament. Many interests are now represented in\r\nParliament that were not directly represented at all in the earlier days,\r\nand the problems of a more numerous population and of a more complex\r\ncivilisation make corresponding demands on the time of the House of\r\nCommons. The serious man who represents these great new interests in the\r\nHouse of Commons never consciously squanders the time of the House in\r\nunnecessary speech. No doubt the prevailing fashion of oratory is marked\r\nby diffuseness and lack of discipline, but it is to the comparatively\r\nmodern scandal of deliberate obstruction by speech that we owe the\r\nguillotine and all its attendant evils. From time to time there has been\r\nearnest debate as to whether a time limit to speeches should be fixed.\r\nThat any such policy is difficult of achievement is proved by the fact\r\nthat even the existing Standing Order against irrelevance and tedious\r\nrepetition has fallen into almost complete abeyance.\r\n\r\nWhat is the ultimate remedy for the congestion of business in the House of\r\nCommons? Who can doubt that it is the delegation of provincial business to\r\nprovincial assemblies? There has been, I say, no lack of expedients. The\r\nsetting up of four Grand Committees, the institution of the guillotine as\r\na regular feature of House of Commons procedure in regard to every\r\nfirst-class measure, the frequent resort to autumn sittings—these methods\r\nhave been tried and found wanting. Little prospect of relief is afforded\r\nby any projected limitation of speeches or by the carrying over of Bills.\r\nMeanwhile, as we have seen, the legitimate claims on the attention of\r\nParliament grow with the needs of a growing population and of an expanding\r\nempire. In part it is the problem of new wine in old bottles. Our\r\nParliament was not constructed for its present purposes. Originally it was\r\nthe legislature for England alone. The provincial affairs of Scotland were\r\nfirst imposed on it, and then those of Ireland. Concurrently, the\r\nmanagement of an empire, as varied in its legislative and administrative\r\nrequirements as the various climates it enjoys, has been added to our\r\nresponsibilities. You may if you like regard our present House of Commons\r\nas an Imperial Legislature stooping from time to time to the consideration\r\nof provincial business, or as a provincial Parliament rising in its\r\nmoments of inspiration to the discharge of high Imperial duties. The same\r\nParliament that has to decide to-day some small matter of purely local\r\nIrish or Scottish concern must settle a national strike to-morrow, approve\r\nthe naval strategy of the Empire, or frame the constitution for a people.\r\nTo the executive that is responsible to the same Parliament are entrusted\r\nall the tremendous issues of peace and war. It is a supreme testimony to\r\nthe genius of the British peoples for government that we have voyaged so\r\nfar without shipwreck everywhere except in the region of Irish affairs.\r\n\r\nBy all admissions we have made a mess of Ireland. With singular and\r\nunwonted perverseness we have refused for more than a hundred years to\r\napply to Ireland the principles of self-government that have justified\r\ntheir application in every province of the Empire that is mainly inhabited\r\nby people of our own race. We have risked and we have incurred the\r\ndisaffection of the Irish themselves; we have imposed on them and on\r\nourselves untold suffering and expense; we have imperilled the whole\r\nfabric of our Parliamentary institutions.\r\n\r\nIt is this last aspect of the problem to which earnest consideration is\r\ninvited in these few pages. The efficiency of Imperial Parliament is a\r\nmatter of Imperial concern. By no other means than by maintaining Imperial\r\nParliament at the highest pitch of efficiency can we be assured of good\r\ngovernment throughout the empire. I do not myself shrink from any of the\r\nlogical consequences of the line of argument I have adopted. A truly\r\nImperial Parliament representing England, Ireland and Scotland and, it may\r\nbe, each of the more important Dependencies of the Crown—that is the goal\r\ntowards which we should press. But the Irish claim, so far as the claims\r\nof the United Kingdom are concerned, was first presented, is most urgent,\r\nand must first be satisfied. If we could but rid our minds of party bias,\r\nHome Rule for Ireland would be universally regarded as the first step\r\nforward in the direction of Imperial efficiency. It is unquestionably a\r\ncondition precedent to the re-establishment of our control over our own\r\nlegislative machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(II) The Tendency Towards Legislative Disintegration. A Review Of The\r\nStatute Book. BY H. DE R. WALKER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland was the end of a\r\ndefinite epoch of political concentration. England, Scotland, and Ireland\r\nhad at last been brought under a single Parliament, with equal and\r\ncomplete legislative authority over the whole of the three Kingdoms. But\r\nUnion was not accompanied by uniformity, especially in the case of\r\nIreland. Ireland, when joined in a legislative union with Great Britain,\r\nwas in fact left in possession of separate Administrative, Financial and\r\nJudicial institutions. With the separate judicial system I am not further\r\nconcerned, but at a time when the grant of extended self-government to\r\nIreland is under consideration, I contend that it is of great utility to\r\nobserve how far Irish Administration and Irish Finance are actually\r\ndistinct and separate at the present time. Moreover, whatever may have\r\nbeen the intention of the statesmen of the period of the Union, it has\r\nalso been found to be necessary, owing to the diversity of the\r\ninstitutions, to pass in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, a large\r\nnumber of statutes solely applicable to Ireland. I do not assume that what\r\nis now separate should in every case be transferred to the new Irish\r\nAuthority, nor that what is now done in common should not be so\r\ntransferred; but I do contend that the existing differentiation should\r\nlargely guide us in connection with the forthcoming proposals. On the\r\nother side, our opponents might of course urge that, as we have already\r\ngot separate laws and separate administration for Ireland, we obtain under\r\nexisting arrangements all the diversity that is required, and that we have\r\nherein an argument against Home Rule rather than in its favour.\r\n\r\nWe must, therefore, carry the matter a step further. We may say that the\r\nseparate laws and separate administration, while not conclusive as to the\r\nneed for Home Rule, will be found to provide a basis for its inception if\r\nit can be shown on other grounds to be desirable; but, as it is not my\r\nintention to enter upon the general merits or demerits of Home Rule, I\r\npass on to submit the practical consideration that the separate laws and\r\nthe separate administration for Ireland, as worked in connection with a\r\nsingle Parliament, not only work badly in themselves, but are prejudicial\r\nto the orderly development of Parliamentary government. This is my case,\r\nand if I can prove it, we should either do away with these separate\r\narrangements or cease to work them in connection with a single Parliament.\r\nBut it will be easy to prove further that the separate arrangements cannot\r\nnow be consolidated. There is a continuous tendency to accentuate them in\r\naccordance with the requirements of the situation. We shall, therefore, be\r\ndriven to the conclusion that we must have recourse to a separate\r\nParliament for Ireland in order to be able to work these separate\r\narrangements in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nIn order to substantiate these contentions, I shall discuss the existing\r\nposition as regards Irish Legislation, at the same time giving some\r\nattention to Finance and Administration in their legislative aspects. The\r\nuniformity in Anglo-Irish Finances which has been developed during the\r\nnineteenth century is still qualified by a certain differentiation.\r\nSeparate departments of administration involve separate estimates of\r\nexpenditure; and separate laws may involve separate grants of money.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the Act of Union did not attempt to establish uniformity\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland in the matter of either administration\r\nor finance, but they followed the precedent of the Union between England\r\nand Scotland in the concentration of all legislative powers in a single\r\nbody, the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\nBut Union did not necessarily mean uniformity, and the united Parliament\r\nfound itself at once compelled to pass separate and different Acts for the\r\nseveral portions of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn this branch of our subject it will be convenient not to confine our\r\nattention to the separate Irish laws, but, since many laws are also passed\r\nseparately for England and for Scotland, to take a wider view and consider\r\nhow far Parliament legislates in common for the whole of the United\r\nKingdom, and how far separately for one or more of its component parts.\r\nAnd it follows therefrom that any conclusions that we may form as to the\r\ndelegation of legislative powers are likely to apply in kind if not in\r\ndegree to England and Scotland as to Ireland. In the administrative\r\nsphere, of course, the position is by no means the same as between the\r\nthree countries. Scotland has at present no important central department\r\nat Edinburgh other than its Local Government Board.\r\n\r\nIt was largely owing to the maintenance under the Union of the separate\r\nadministration in Ireland, combined with the retention during the first\r\nsixteen years of the separate exchequers, that Parliament was obliged to\r\nlegislate separately for the different portions of the United Kingdom.\r\nThese were the years of the Napoleonic wars, when very heavy taxation was\r\nimposed; and, not only was a separate Act passed, according to the custom\r\nof the time, for each article that was to be taxed, but this taxation was,\r\non account of the separate exchequers, imposed by separate Acts for Great\r\nBritain and for Ireland. In these circumstances it is not surprising to\r\nfind that the most numerous Statutes of the first twenty years of the\r\ncentury were those whose application was confined to Great Britain or to\r\nIreland, and that they considerably exceeded in number those which applied\r\nto the whole of the United Kingdom or to England alone. After the\r\namalgamation of the exchequers in 1817, the annual average of Statutes\r\napplying to Great Britain dropped at once from thirty-five to seven, and\r\ngradually decreased still further, since most of the financial measures\r\nwere passed thenceforward for the whole of the United Kingdom alike. But\r\nIreland, in spite of the financial amalgamation, continued to call for a\r\nlarge amount of separate legislation, and the annual average of Statutes\r\napplying solely to Ireland dropped no more than from thirty-one in the\r\ndecade 1811-20, to nineteen in the following decade, at which point it\r\nremained fairly constant during the greatest part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Throughout this period, the average annual number of what I call\r\n“United Kingdom” Statutes ranged between forty-nine in the decade 1861-70,\r\nand thirty-two in 1881-90, and of Statutes that applied solely to England\r\nbetween fifty-eight in 1881-90, and twenty-three in 1801-10. It should be\r\nadded that the numbers are those of the Public Acts alone, and they would\r\nbe much higher, particularly in the later years, if the Local and Private\r\nActs were included in the enumeration. But the public Statutes are\r\nobviously alone relevant in any enquiry as to the extent to which the\r\nUnion of the Parliaments has led to legislative uniformity, and it is very\r\nsignificant that, even upon these public matters, Parliament has been\r\nunable at any time since the Act of Union, to avoid the necessity for a\r\nlarge amount of separate legislation for Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe figures up to 1890 are taken from Mr. T. A. Spalding’s “Federation and\r\nEmpire,” which contains many interesting particulars, and I have worked\r\nout the figures for the two succeeding decades, but not exactly on the\r\nsame basis. Mr. Spalding includes the Provisional Order Confirmation Acts\r\nwhich were not distinguished from other Public Acts until the middle of\r\nlast century, but I omit them as not partaking of the character of general\r\nlegislation, and the number of separate Acts given for England, Scotland\r\nand Ireland is considerably reduced by this omission.\r\n\r\nIn my first table, which gives the total, not the annual average, I divide\r\nthe Public General Acts into two wide categories: those, which I term\r\n“United Kingdom” Statutes, that apply to the Dominions, the Colonies, or\r\nIndia, as well as those which apply to the United Kingdom as a whole; and\r\nthose, which I term “State” Statutes, that apply to England, Scotland or\r\nIreland alone, to any two of these three countries, or, in a very few\r\ncases, only to the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nPublic General Acts, 1891-1910.\r\n\r\n             United       State.       Total.\r\n             Kingdom.\r\n1891-1900    295          336          631\r\n1901-1910    252          206          458\r\nTotal        547          542          1,089\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that there is a curious approximation between the\r\nnumbers in the two columns, and nearly half the legislative output of\r\nParliament thus takes a form which is at any rate contrary to the spirit\r\nof the Act of Union. Excluding financial measures during the few years\r\nwhen the exchequers of Great Britain and Ireland continued to be separate,\r\nit would have been anticipated that the legislation under the Union would\r\nbe uniform, or at least tend to uniformity, and it is very significant\r\nthat, after more than a hundred years, so much separate legislation should\r\nstill be required for the several portions of the United Kingdom. But I\r\nwill postpone any further comments on this situation until I have shown\r\nhow the “State” Acts are divided up as between the three countries and\r\nwhat are the principal subjects with which they deal.\r\n\r\nFrom my classification of the “State” Acts according to countries, I have\r\nomitted the twenty-one Acts which apply solely to the Channel Islands and\r\nthe Isle of Man, one Scottish and Irish Act, and one Welsh Act; and, as to\r\nWales, I may take the opportunity to say that I do not prejudge its claim\r\nto separate treatment in any measure of Home Rule all round, but that I\r\nshall not specifically mention Wales in this paper, partly in order to\r\navoid the repeated enumeration of the four countries in the place of\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland, partly because the claim of the\r\nPrincipality, so far as it may be based on laws and administration that\r\nare distinct from those of England, is exceedingly weak. Education,\r\nhowever, is already separately administered, separate Insurance\r\nCommissioners have been appointed for Wales, and an important Welsh\r\nIntermediate Education Act was passed in 1889, just before the period that\r\nis covered by the following table.\r\n\r\n“State” ACTS, 1891-1910.\r\n\r\n            England.

We should, then, seek for some form of delegation which would\r\nremove English and Scottish, as well as Irish legislation, from the\r\npurview of the existing Parliament; but, in the meanwhile, the figures\r\nshow that the removal of the Irish business would relieve matters\r\nappreciably, and it is probable, without counting the Home Rule Bills,\r\nwhich should not be regarded as exclusively Irish measures, that the Irish\r\nlegislative proposals take more of the time of the House of Commons than\r\nwould be represented by the proportion which they bear to the total\r\nlegislative output.\r\n\r\nI now pass to the subject-matter of the Acts of Parliament; and I again\r\nturn to Mr. Spalding’s book. He has made a most interesting analysis of\r\nthe statutes up to the year 1890, from which it appears that Parliament\r\nhad been unable to legislate by Acts applying over the whole of the United\r\nKingdom whenever it had had to deal with the administration of justice and\r\nthe laws relating to any of the following subjects: the tenure and\r\noccupation of land; the holding, transfer, and devolution of property\r\n(including land); the Church; the poor; local government, rural and urban;\r\nroads, railways, and canals; and education.(160) These are the subjects,\r\nthat is to say, on which Parliament had been obliged to pass separate laws\r\nfor the different parts of the United Kingdom, and the study of this\r\ncentrifugal tendency seemed to me so important that I have continued (on\r\nthe next page) the analysis for the following twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe first impression derived from this table is that the division between\r\nthe subjects on which the legislation covers the whole of the United\r\nKingdom, and those on which it has a narrower application, is much the\r\nsame as during the earlier period. Parliament continues to legislate\r\nseparately for the “States” in the matters in which it has been its\r\npractice so to do, and this in itself is a very significant consideration\r\nin view of the strong contrary inducement resulting from the growing\r\ncongestion of Parliamentary business. Thus, taking the last three headings\r\non the list, we see that in regard to Education, the Poor, and the Church,\r\nall the legislation during the twenty years was of a “State” character,\r\nwhile the very numerous Acts relating to Local Administration were in\r\nalmost every instance equally limited in their application. When we pass\r\nto Law and Justice, and to Land and Agriculture, we find that the “State”\r\npredominance is not quite so marked, but even so, there were three times\r\nas many “State” as “United Kingdom” laws, and we conclude that, though the\r\npressure of Parliamentary business is against it, “State” legislation\r\ncontinues to hold the field over a wide and varied range of legislative\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nPublic General Acts.—United Kingdom.(161)\r\n\r\nDate.             1891-5    1896-1900   1901-5    1906-10   Total\r\nImperial.         24        12          13        15        64\r\nArmy and          15        25          18        14        72\r\nNavy.\r\nConditions        10        9           5         10        34\r\nof\r\nEmployment.\r\nBenefit.          6         5           2         5         18\r\nFinance.          37        30          29        28        124\r\nGeneral           40        21          20        31        112\r\nAdministration.\r\nTrade and         6         12          9         18        45\r\nCommerce.\r\nTraffic.          4         1           3                   8\r\nLaw and           16        4           5         14        39\r\nJustice.\r\nLand and          7         4           1         8         20\r\nAgriculture\r\nLocal             3         4           1         3         11\r\nAdministration\r\nEducation\r\nPoor Law\r\nChurch\r\nTotal             168       127         106       146       547\r\n\r\nStates (England, Scotland And Ireland, Separately, And Combinations Of Any\r\nTwo Of Them).\r\n\r\nDate.             1891-5      1896-1900   1901-5      1906-10     Total\r\nImperial.\r\nArmy and\r\nNavy.\r\nConditions\r\nof\r\nEmployment.\r\nBenefit.\r\nFinance.          3           10          4                       17\r\nGeneral           7           10          8           7           32\r\nAdministration.\r\nTrade and         9           6           9           12          36\r\nCommerce.\r\nTraffic.          4           4                                   8\r\nLaw and           40          43          9           31          123\r\nJustice.\r\nLand and          23          11          7           22          63\r\nAgriculture.\r\nLocal             49          55          23          34          161\r\nAdministration.\r\nEducation.        9           10          11          10          40\r\nPoor Law.         4           15          4           2           25\r\nChurch.           3           10          2           1           16\r\nTotal.            151         174         77          119         521\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the scale are the subjects on which Parliament is\r\nalways able to legislate for the whole of the United Kingdom by a single\r\nStatute. The Imperial Laws are those which are promoted by the Foreign,\r\nColonial, and India Offices, and concern our relations with Foreign Powers\r\nor with some portion of the British Empire. The Army and Navy laws include\r\nnot only the Naval and Military Works Acts, but any Acts dealing with the\r\nTerritorial and Reserve Forces. The next two classes may be bracketed\r\ntogether as Labour Laws, but are distinct according as they relate to the\r\nconditions of employment of the workers, for instance, in shops, coal\r\nmines, or factories, or to the benefits which accrue to them through\r\nWorkmen’s Compensation, Friendly and other Societies, and Old-Age\r\nPensions. In both these cases, also, all the laws apply to the whole of\r\nthe United Kingdom as do the great majority of the laws in the next two\r\nheadings of Finance and General Administration. The “State” Acts under\r\nFinance are those by which Parliament has made grants towards the local\r\nexpenditure upon education and towards the relief of the land from local\r\nburdens, and has done so separately for the three countries; and the\r\n“State” Acts of General Administration deal with the Central Departments\r\nwhich are maintained separately for England, Scotland, and Ireland. The\r\nheading of traffic is of dwindling importance, and the enumeration ends\r\nwith trade and commerce where the “United Kingdom” laws have a slight\r\nnumerical superiority.\r\n\r\nI have confined myself here to a few summary remarks upon the different\r\nlegislative headings as I have discussed the matter in greater detail\r\nelsewhere;(162) nor do I wish to enlarge upon the conclusions that might\r\nbe drawn from the figures. The South African War is evidently responsible\r\nfor the greater number of Military Acts in 1896-1900; and the slowing down\r\nof the Parliamentary machine during Mr. Balfour’s Administration is\r\nreflected in the smallness of the total legislative output in 1901-5.\r\nMoreover, since the Unionists were in power throughout 1901-5, and the\r\nLiberals throughout 1906-10, there is scope for a direct comparison of the\r\nrecords of the two Governments, but such considerations have no bearing\r\nupon our present purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I hope that the opponents as well as the supporters of\r\nHome Rule would agree that, since Home Rule involves a division of\r\nlegislative powers between the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the\r\nIrish Parliament, it is not only pertinent, but necessary, that we should\r\nmake ourselves acquainted with the lines upon which Parliament has, in\r\npractice, divided up its legislative business. For, while the point should\r\nnot be pressed too far, I would suggest that the separate Irish laws, and,\r\nfor that matter, the separate English and Scottish laws, constitute a kind\r\nof internal devolution, which is all the more significant because\r\nParliament has not been actuated by any preconceived purpose; and that the\r\nsubjects which are now dealt with by “State” laws are, for that very\r\nreason, those of which Parliament should naturally be relieved under any\r\nscheme of Home Rule. Similarly, it might be claimed that Parliament should\r\nretain those powers which it is now able to exercise in common for the\r\nwhole of the United Kingdom; but the position is not the same in the two\r\ncases. In its anxiety to economise time, Parliament does not hesitate to\r\nrender its measures applicable to the whole of the United Kingdom by\r\nappending to them clauses which regulate separately the application of the\r\nprovisions to Scotland and Ireland; and where these “application clauses,”\r\nas they are called, are long and complicated, it is probable that separate\r\nmeasures for the different parts of the United Kingdom could be adjusted\r\nmore closely to the local requirements. On the other hand, we may be sure\r\nthat Parliament would not have passed, for instance, separate Local\r\nGovernment Acts for England, Scotland and Ireland, each of which took up\r\nmuch of its time, unless it had been obliged to do so; and we may assume,\r\nwhenever such separate Acts are passed, that Parliament had some strong\r\nreason for its action, though, of course, I do not imply that Parliament\r\nhas legislated also for England and Scotland on every subject on which it\r\nhas passed an Act that related exclusively to Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that, while I have sufficiently described these\r\nseparate laws, I have not explained why they are passed, nor have I given\r\nany reason why they must be continued. The separate laws are passed\r\nbecause England, Scotland and Ireland have in many respects distinct and\r\ndifferent institutions. In Ireland, for instance, neither the position of\r\nthe Church, nor the organisation of the police or of the Courts of\r\nJustice, nor the law in regard to the tenure of land, nor the system of\r\neducation or of local government in general, is the same as in England or\r\nin Scotland; while Ireland is also subject to an exceptional code of\r\ncriminal law. And the institutions of England and Scotland differ also\r\nvery widely from one another. “After a long period of intimate union\r\nbetween England and Scotland,” said Lord Lothian, in 1887, in a speech in\r\nthe House of Lords upon the proposed enlargement of the powers of the\r\nSecretary for Scotland, “people are apt to forget how entirely distinctive\r\nand different the administration of Scotland is from that of England.\r\nThere is almost no point of resemblance. There are different forms of\r\nreligion and different social forms affecting almost every portion of\r\nScotland. There is a different code of education—an entirely different\r\ncode of education—and different systems of agriculture. There are also\r\ndifferent systems affecting the law of lunacy and parochial laws, and\r\nalmost every other department.”(163) And these differences between the\r\nthree countries, which are the direct cause of the distinctive laws, must\r\nsurely be regarded as permanent, seeing that they have persisted since the\r\nrespective Acts of Union. Neither Scotland nor Ireland would willingly\r\nsurrender its separate judicial and ecclesiastical institutions or its\r\nseparate machinery of administration. Indeed, the prevailing tendency\r\nfavours increased differentiation, and it has the support of Unionists as\r\nwell as of Liberals. The Unionists have recently created new Irish\r\nDepartments in Dublin, such as the Department of Agriculture and Technical\r\nInstruction, and when the Liberals had re-established the office of\r\nSecretary for Scotland after a lapse of nearly a century and a half, the\r\nUnionists proceeded to add considerably to its powers.\r\n\r\nWe may thus take it as axiomatic that, in the absence of Imperial\r\nFederation, or of a proposal such as Home Rule whereby Parliament can be\r\nrelieved of some of its legislative duties, it must continue to occupy\r\nitself with five different categories of laws: Imperial laws, affecting\r\nthe British Dominions beyond the seas; laws applying to the whole of the\r\nUnited Kingdom; and laws which relate exclusively to England, to Scotland\r\nand to Ireland. Moreover, while each legislative sphere has its parallel\r\nsphere of administration, the sole and supreme authority, except so far as\r\nthe Dominions look after their own affairs, is centred, as with the\r\nlegislative power, in a single body, the Government of the United Kingdom,\r\nwhich holds an absolutely unique position in the extent and variety of its\r\nresponsibilities. In both these functions, then, we may have serious\r\ndoubts as to how the system works, but I am unable to give any direct\r\nevidence in regard to the Executive. Though it is inherently improbable\r\nthat a small group of men should be able adequately to supervise so varied\r\na collection of interests, the subject is obviously one in which it is\r\nalmost impossible to obtain precise information. The Cabinet of 1880-5 was\r\nnot altogether happy in its multiplex activities, and complaints were rife\r\nof the neglect of home affairs during the South African War. Speaking\r\ngenerally, indeed, the Unionists, according to their adversaries,\r\nsubordinate domestic to Imperial interests, while the critics of the\r\nLiberals would say that the Liberals reverse the process. And there we may\r\nleave the question, while agreeing, I hope, that Home Rule, or preferably\r\nHome Rule all round, would be beneficial so far as it would relieve the\r\npressure upon a Cabinet that can scarcely fail to be overworked. And if\r\nthere is any doubt as to the Cabinet there can be no doubt that Parliament\r\nis overworked to a very grievous extent. Irrespective of the strain upon\r\nindividual numbers, it is admittedly unequal to the efficient discharge of\r\nits manifold functions. It cannot do all that it should do, and much of\r\nwhat it does do, it does without proper discussion. As to the first of\r\nthese shortcomings, I am glad to be able to quote from an article in the\r\n_Round Table_(164) for December, 1911, in which, after a detailed\r\ncomparison of the time that is available to the House of Commons with the\r\ndemands that are made upon it, the conclusion is reached that “the\r\nlegislative requirements of the country are too great for the available\r\nParliamentary time.” And, as to the absence of proper discussion, the\r\nreader may be referred to the remarks on every occasion when the use of\r\nthe guillotine closure is proposed, while the final inadequacy of the\r\nHouse of Commons is implicit in the recent admission of the Prime\r\nMinister, when proposing the guillotine motion upon the National Insurance\r\nBill, that, without a resort to this method of procedure, the House cannot\r\ncarry out the duties which it is required by the country and the interests\r\nof the Empire to discharge. Moreover, it should be borne in mind that, in\r\ntrying to get all this diverse work out of a single Parliament,\r\nGovernments have not only grievously restricted its legislative powers,\r\nbut have also reduced the opportunities for discussion on administration\r\nand finance which are at least equally important functions of any supreme\r\nParliamentary authority.\r\n\r\nBut the agitation in connection with the National Insurance Act will keep\r\npublic attention sufficiently focussed upon the manner in which Parliament\r\ndoes its legislative work, and I pass from the amount of the work to the\r\nconsequences arising from its variety. As the Cabinet must supervise both\r\ndomestic and Imperial affairs, and Parliament must deal separately with\r\nthese two branches of legislation, so the electorate should not overlook\r\neither the Imperial or domestic views of those who seek its suffrages. But\r\nan elector may be faced by the difficulty that he likes the Imperial views\r\nof one candidate and the domestic views of the other, while the same man\r\nmust represent him in both of these aspects in the House of Commons. In\r\n1900 the Liberal supporter of the South African War was confronted with\r\nthis dilemma in an acute form; and, in view of subsequent disputations, it\r\nmay be taken to have been unfortunate that the party which won the\r\nelections of 1900, almost entirely on Imperial considerations, should\r\nthereby have been placed also in charge of our domestic concerns. And\r\nthere was a similar confusion of issues in 1906, when, because a man was a\r\ntariff reformer or a free-trader, it did not necessarily follow that, in\r\nthe former event, he was for, or, in the latter, against, the Conservative\r\npolicy in regard to the liquor trade or religious instruction in the\r\nelementary schools. No small advantage, therefore, would accrue from Home\r\nRule all round in the fact that separate categories of issues would be\r\nplaced separately before the constituencies.\r\n\r\nAnd the electoral confusion is reproduced in the House of Commons; for\r\nthere can be no doubt that the Liberals suffered under this disability in\r\nthe Parliament of 1900, and the Conservatives in that of 1906. But, in the\r\ncase of the Member, the connection with so many diverse interests has also\r\nother objectionable consequences. Supposing he sits for an English\r\nconstituency, his responsibility extends to Scottish and Irish laws and\r\nadministration, as to which he will know little or nothing, while his\r\nconstituents will usually be indifferent as to what he may do.\r\nIllustrating this matter from my own experience as an English county\r\nMember, I may say, regarding my votes upon the Scottish Small Landholders\r\nand Valuation Bills, and the Irish Evicted Tenants and Land Bills, that\r\nnot one of these subjects brought me any letter from a constituent, or was\r\nthe occasion of any reference whatever in the course of any of my\r\npolitical meetings. And, since there is no reason to suppose that other\r\nEnglish constituencies would feel or act differently, all these votes of\r\nEnglish Members are in reality irresponsible, and they are to be condemned\r\nupon the principles of representative Government. For, in spite of the\r\nobservance of its outward forms, its true spirit is absent wherever there\r\nis a failure of the healthy interplay of influences between a Member and\r\nhis constituents; and here again, Home Rule all round could alone relieve\r\nthe situation. Through the establishment of separate Parliaments in\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland, a Member’s work in each of these bodies\r\nwould be confined, as regards public affairs, to matters by which his\r\nconstituents were or might be affected and in which there was the normal\r\nand proper relation between the electors and those whom they had elected.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a further evil effect arising from the inevitable\r\nindifference of constituents to much of the legislation which does not\r\napply to the country in which they live. In view of the divergence of\r\ninterests and diversity of classes represented in every Parliament, there\r\nis probably no legislature in which there is not a tendency to\r\n“log-rolling,” by which I mean arrangements among Members to support\r\nmeasures about which they do not care in return for help with measures in\r\nwhich they are particularly concerned. This temptation will be greater\r\nwhen the Parliament is not only overworked, as is the case here, but the\r\nstruggle is intensified by the rivalry between English, Scottish, and\r\nIrish claims upon its attention. In the resultant situation, indeed,\r\narrangements of a “log-rolling” character are likely to be made even upon\r\nthe wider issues, and the fact should not be overlooked that they are\r\nrendered more easy because so many laws are passed separately for England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland. In theory, of course, as Professor Dicey claims, it\r\nis the duty of a Member, whencesoever returned, to consult for the\r\ninterests of the whole nation, and not to safeguard the interests of\r\nparticular localities or countries; but in practice he cannot do it. The\r\nsubjects for legislation are so complicated that he cannot make himself\r\nacquainted with them as they affect each of the three countries, and the\r\npressure upon Parliament is so tremendous that he is almost bound to try\r\nto get for his own country a fair share of such time as is available. It\r\nis, therefore, wiser to bow to the inevitable, and enable the English,\r\nScottish, or Irish Member, as the case may be, to look after his own\r\nconcerns in his own Parliament, untroubled by the presence of others who\r\ndo not understand his business and will not be called to account by their\r\nconstituents for what they may do, while leaving the control of all common\r\naffairs, as at present, to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, valid reasons why Ireland has a pre-eminent claim to\r\npriority of treatment. Ireland has been much less successful than England\r\nor Scotland in securing that Parliamentary action should be in accordance\r\nwith the wishes of the majority of its Members in the House of Commons.\r\nWhere the representatives of three countries together constitute a\r\nlegislative body, it is probable that each of these countries will at some\r\ntime or other be under the sway of a majority different from that which\r\nwould be formed if its own representatives alone decided upon its\r\ncomposition; but it is clear that this fate is less likely to overtake the\r\ncountry which has a great numerical preponderance in the legislature in\r\nquestion. Thus, taking the period since 1885, England, holding 465 of the\r\n670 seats in the House of Commons, was only in this position from 1892-5,\r\nfor at the two elections in 1910 there was almost a tie in the return of\r\n226 Ministerialists and 239 supporters of the Opposition. And this great\r\npreponderance of one of the countries adds to the likelihood that the\r\nothers may have the majority of their own representatives in a minority of\r\nthe whole representation. I have not been discussing the separate case of\r\nWales, and so I will only say that, of the 30 Welsh Members, on no\r\noccasion in the twenty-seven years have the Unionists been able to muster\r\nmore than 8; and Scotland has scarcely responded more closely to the swing\r\nof the pendulum in England. Though the Unionists were in power for fifteen\r\nout of the twenty-seven years, they had a majority in Scotland, and that a\r\nvery small one, only in the Parliament of 1900. But Scotland on the whole\r\ndoes not come off badly, since it is not the practice of the Members from\r\nthe other countries to vote down the Scottish representatives. Where\r\nScotland does suffer is in their inability, owing to their numerical\r\nweakness, to secure a fair share of attention for Scottish domestic\r\nconcerns. A law on Scottish Education, for instance, though it got into\r\nthe Queen’s Speech for 1900, was not enacted until 1908, and the Scottish\r\nMembers never have more than one day in the Session for the discussion of\r\nall the Scottish Estimates. When we pass to Ireland, it is difficult to\r\nmake any similar comparison, for, though the Nationalists sit permanently\r\nin opposition in the House of Commons, it does not follow that they should\r\nbe classed as being opposed to the Liberals as well as to the Unionists.\r\nIf we regard them as opposed to both of the principal parties, then, when\r\nthe Liberals have been in power, every Irish Member with one single\r\nexception must be reckoned to have been among their opponents. But, if we\r\nprefer to base our calculations upon the sort of informal understanding\r\nwhich has existed during most of the time between the Liberals and the\r\nNationalists, we must confine our attention, from the present point of\r\nview, to the years of Unionist Government, and we find that, of the 103\r\nIrish representatives, the number of Irish Unionists during those periods\r\nhas never exceeded 23 and has been as low as 19. Thus, putting the various\r\nfigures which have been quoted into percentages, it becomes evident that\r\nEngland has had to live under a Liberal Government when the Unionists (in\r\n1892-5) had 58 per cent. of the total English representation; Scotland has\r\nhad to live under a Unionist Government when the Liberals (in 1886-92) had\r\n60 per cent. of the total Scottish representation; whereas Ireland has had\r\nto live under a Unionist Government when the Nationalists had as much as\r\n81 per cent. of the total Irish representation. And it must be borne in\r\nmind that, while England and Scotland are only rarely governed in\r\nopposition to the wishes of the majority of their representatives, Ireland\r\nhas continued to be preponderantly Nationalist irrespective of party\r\nfluctuations in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, Ireland, whether in its Nationalist or its\r\nUnionist constituencies, never expresses any other opinion than for or\r\nagainst Home Rule. We regret the confusion at all elections in the United\r\nKingdom between Imperial and domestic issues, but at least we get an idea\r\nof the views of the electorate in Great Britain on some big Imperial\r\nquestion, or as between Free Trade and Protection. In Ireland we get\r\nnothing of the kind; it is impossible to say, for instance, whether\r\nIreland is in favour of Tariff Reform or not; and the votes of the great\r\nmajority of its representatives in the House of Commons are usually given,\r\nnot with reference to the views of their constituents on the question\r\nunder discussion, but solely in relation to the attainment of Home Rule.\r\nNow, this attitude of the Nationalists is evidently adopted because Irish\r\ndomestic concerns are decided in the House of Commons by men who are not\r\nIrish representatives; and it may be remarked that Scotsmen, and even, to\r\nsome extent, Englishmen, are also liable to have their wishes on purely\r\ndomestic affairs over-ridden by the representatives of the other\r\ncountries, but that they do not, on that account, subordinate everything\r\nelse to the effort to release themselves from this anomaly.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from the consideration, as we have seen above, that the Irish\r\nhave been the principal sufferers, the Irish electorate are entitled, if\r\nthis is a free country, to choose the issue which shall be put forward,\r\nand we should sympathise with them when they ask to be allowed to manage\r\ntheir domestic affairs without interference, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of representative government. It is immaterial how far the\r\nIrish Nationalists have actually been able to get their own way in the\r\nHouse of Commons, for their efforts have usually been in vain until after\r\na lawless agitation in Ireland, which, as a means of securing redress for\r\ngrievances, is as demoralising to the legislator as to the elector. And\r\nwhen the law for which the Irish have asked has been passed without any\r\nsuch outside pressure, it is evident that the votes of the majority of the\r\nIrish representatives would have been useless unless sufficient English\r\nand Scottish Members had been willing to fall in with their wishes. Every\r\nIrish Nationalist knows, therefore, that a majority of the Irish\r\nrepresentatives is by itself utterly unable to carry a purely Irish\r\nmeasure through the House of Commons, however often it may have been\r\nadvocated, and however large may have been the Irish majorities in its\r\nfavour; and representative government cannot fail to be brought into\r\ndisrepute in Ireland, on account of its futility under existing\r\nconditions. Moreover, if representative institutions are to work well,\r\nthere should be, so far as is possible, in every constituency supporters\r\nand opponents of the Government on the current questions of the day, for\r\nit is only by constant discussion and interaction that we can secure a\r\nsound relation between Parliament and the country. But nothing of the kind\r\ntakes place in Ireland. Through their dissociation from the division into\r\nparties that prevails in Great Britain, the bulk of the Irish people are\r\nnot informed as to the views on topics other than Home Rule of the\r\nLiberals, Unionists, or Labour men. In the greater part of Ireland, the\r\nNationalist candidate is returned unopposed or is opposed only by another\r\nNationalist; and when this is so, the party in power, whether it be\r\nUnionist or Liberal, is usually without any machinery by which its case is\r\nput before the electorate. Elsewhere, in Ireland, the Unionists have their\r\norganisation against Home Rule, and so far the Liberals are even in a\r\nworse position, for, though they have had the supreme control of affairs\r\nfor the last six years, there are not half a dozen constituencies in\r\nIreland where they have any means by which they can learn the views of the\r\npeople or explain the policy of the Government. And yet Ireland, like the\r\nrest of the United Kingdom, is supposed to live under representative\r\ninstitutions! No doubt I may be reminded that the Nationalist Members are\r\nin touch with local opinion in Ireland, and that they are the informal\r\nallies of the Liberals; but the Nationalist attitude is concerned with\r\nlittle else but Home Rule, and it is just because, in existing\r\ncircumstances, the Irish do not declare themselves, or perhaps even form\r\nan opinion, on ordinary political issues, that our representative system\r\nhas broken down so much more severely in Ireland than in England or in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I conclude my survey of the practical working of the Act of\r\nUnion. I have shown that the domestic affairs of the three countries are,\r\nin continuance of what was done before the Union of the Parliaments, or as\r\nthe result of subsequent developments, ordered in many respects separately\r\nfor England, Scotland, and Ireland, and that there is no question in any\r\nquarter of the elimination of these separate arrangements. But they have\r\nled, as has been further demonstrated, to many difficulties in connection\r\nwith our system of Parliamentary government, and it is only by the\r\nsub-division of the responsibilities between two or more Parliaments that\r\nsuch difficulties can satisfactorily be overcome. We have, therefore,\r\nvalid grounds for the advocacy of Home Rule, apart from the particular\r\nclaims of Ireland, though they, of course, serve to strengthen the\r\nargument; and, in considering what form the proposals should take, we\r\ncannot do better than study carefully how far England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland are now governed in common and how far each of the three countries\r\nis governed separately. For the subjects in which there is now separate\r\ntreatment are those which would be transferred under Home Rule with the\r\nsmallest breach of continuity, or rather, in the natural course of our\r\nconstitutional evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(III) Colonial Forms Of Home Rule. BY SIR ALFRED MOND, BART., M.P.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important elements in the problem of Home Rule must be the\r\nrelation between the spheres of legislation to be retained by the existing\r\nParliament, and those to be allocated to the subordinate Irish\r\nLegislature. Such demarcation will be applied later to the other local\r\nParliaments which may be created for England, Scotland and Wales. The\r\ncreation of subordinate legislatures, together with the retention of a\r\ncentral Parliament, must necessarily lead to the study of federal systems\r\nalready in existence in the Empire, and of the mutual relations of similar\r\nbodies within such federations. It is true that a certain influential\r\nschool of political thought is rather disposed to compare the position of\r\nthe future Irish Parliament to that of the Dominion Parliaments in their\r\nrelations with the Parliament at Westminster. The effort, however, to draw\r\nan analogy between Ireland in her relations with Great Britain, and the\r\nrelations existing between the three Dominions and the United Kingdom is\r\nmost misleading. The difference between those dominions and Ireland is\r\nindeed far more striking than the similarity, whether they are compared\r\neither from the point of view of area, of present and future population,\r\nor of geographical position. The narrowness of the strip of sea that\r\nseparates Ireland from Great Britain places it from a military and naval\r\nstandpoint in a very different position to that of Canada, Australia, or\r\nSouth Africa. Whereas the great distance at which these Dominions are\r\nsituated imposes upon them the necessity of creating their own defensive\r\nforces, a separate Irish Navy or Army would have no _raison d’etre_.\r\nAgain, not only the distance but the different environment and climate of\r\nthese Dominions, and, particularly in the cases of Canada and South\r\nAfrica, their greater non-British population, naturally promote the\r\ndevelopment of a sense of national entity and therefore of a desire for a\r\ngreater measure of national independence than is felt or demanded by\r\nIreland, in spite of her strong national sentiment. Supposing for\r\nargument’s sake, that the whole of the Canadian, Australian, and South\r\nAfrican Dominions formed geographically with Great Britain one continuous\r\nterritory such as the United States of America, it is clear that there\r\nwould have been no call for granting the various Dominions the almost\r\nsovereign powers which they now enjoy. What would most probably arise in\r\nsuch a hypothetical case would be a single federal complex, comprising a\r\ncentral authority or parliament and a large number of state legislatures.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the form of government of these various Dominions and\r\ntheir relations to the Mother Country are largely a geographical accident.\r\nIt is impossible to conceive a system of “Home Rule all round” in which\r\nEngland, Scotland, Wales and Ireland would have the same positions and\r\npowers as Canada, Australia and South Africa, and would maintain the same\r\nrelations towards each other as all three Dominions now occupy towards the\r\nUnited Kingdom. Nor could such an idea be entertained by any one framing a\r\nconstitution, intended to be the commencement of the federalisation, first\r\nof the United Kingdom and afterwards in due time of the British Empire,\r\nwhen circumstances and the growth of public opinion render it possible to\r\nsecure the representation of the Dominions in an expanded Imperial\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn a truly federal system such as those of Canada and Australia, the\r\ncitizens who elect representatives direct to the Federal Parliament to\r\ndeal with the broader issues and interests of the Commonwealth, are\r\nnaturally fully represented. If the Irish Legislature is to be precluded\r\nfrom dealing with Imperial matters, it is obviously only just that the\r\nIrish people, as citizens of the Empire, should send a proportionate\r\nnumber of representatives to the Imperial Parliament to express their\r\nviews on Imperial subjects, and, under a perfect federal system, the\r\nexpression of their views would be confined to Imperial subjects. This\r\nwould consequently necessitate the continued presence of a certain number\r\nof Irish members at Westminster. In view of the fact that the “in and out”\r\nsystem, which caused so much criticism of Mr. Gladstone’s Bill, has been\r\nin force for over forty years in the Hungarian Parliament at Budapest, in\r\nwhich the Croatian representatives are only entitled to vote on matters\r\naffecting the whole Kingdom, while precluded from voting on those\r\naffecting Hungary alone, it is evident that the practical inconvenience\r\ncannot be anything like so great as has been imagined. But whatever\r\ninconvenience might result to the Government from the presence of Irish\r\nrepresentatives in such circumstances, it certainly cannot be allowed to\r\noutweigh the injustice of leaving such a large section of the British\r\nelectorate, as is the Irish people, unrepresented in a chamber which deals\r\nwith matters that may very seriously affect their interests. Mr. Asquith’s\r\nhint at the possibility of such a change in the Standing Orders of the\r\nHouse of Commons as will distribute legislative business between English\r\nand Scotch Standing Committees, suggests a method of combining the\r\nretention of the Irish members at Westminster, with their exclusion from\r\nparticipation in other than Imperial matters.\r\n\r\nOf course in framing a new constitution to meet at once the legitimate\r\nnational aspirations of the Irish people and the requirements of the\r\nImperial power, we cannot pedantically follow any existing model or\r\nprecedent, or drive any analogy too far. It is not intended, by drawing\r\nattention to the fact that the local rather than the Dominion Legislatures\r\nconstitute the better models, in any way to impair the prestige of the\r\nfuture Irish Parliament, or to lessen the readiness to meet all reasonable\r\ndemands of the Irish party and people, or to withhold powers necessary to\r\nmake self-government a success. But it is essential to bear in mind that\r\nthe primary condition of permanent success is a measure that will work\r\nwith the least possible friction on both sides while satisfying legitimate\r\nIrish demands.\r\n\r\nWith these points in view, it is therefore proposed to examine shortly the\r\nconstitutions of the three dominions already referred to, with the object\r\nof showing what are the powers reserved by them for the Federal\r\nGovernments and what are those attributed to the different States\r\ncomprised in the federations, in order to deduce from them some parallel\r\napplicable to the case of Ireland—of course, as already indicated, with\r\nsuch modifications as may be rendered necessary by special circumstances.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to begin with the Canadian Constitution as the oldest,\r\ndealing afterwards with the Constitutions of the Australian Commonwealth\r\n(1900) and of the South African Union (1909).\r\n\r\nThe British North America Act, 1867, expressly sets forth the classes of\r\nsubjects which can be dealt with by the Federal Parliament “for greater\r\ncertainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms\r\nof this section,” that is to say, the liberty given to the Central\r\nParliament “to make laws for the peace, order and good government of\r\nCanada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of\r\nsubjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the\r\nprovinces.” Thus, in Canada, the “residuary” or unspecified classes of\r\nsubjects are reserved for the Central or Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\nSection 92 provides that in each province the legislature may exclusively\r\nmake laws on the following subjects:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The amendment of the Constitution of the Province, except as\r\n    regards the office of Lieutenant-Governor;\r\n\r\n    Direct taxation within the province for provincial purposes;\r\n\r\n    The borrowing of money on the sole credit of the province;\r\n\r\n    The establishment and tenure of provincial offices, and the\r\n    appointment and payment of provincial officers;\r\n\r\n    The management and sale of the public lands;\r\n\r\n    The establishment, maintenance and management of prisons,\r\n    hospitals, asylums, charities, in and for the province;\r\n\r\n    Municipal institutions in the province;\r\n\r\n    Shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer, and other licences, for\r\n    provincial, local or municipal purposes.\r\n\r\n    Local works and undertakings, excepting:—\r\n\r\n    “(_a_) Lines of steam or other ships, railways, canals,\r\n    telegraphs, and other works and undertakings connecting the\r\n    province with any other or others of the provinces, or extending\r\n    beyond the limits of the province.\r\n\r\n    “(_b_) Lines of steam ships between the province and any British\r\n    or foreign country.\r\n\r\n    “(_c_) Such works as, although wholly situate within the province,\r\n    are before or after their execution declared by the Parliament of\r\n    Canada to be for the general advantage of Canada or for the\r\n    advantage of two or more of the provinces.”\r\n\r\n    The incorporation of companies with provincial objects; marriage\r\n    and property and civil rights in the province;\r\n\r\n    The administration of justice in the province, civil and criminal\r\n    jurisdiction, together with the imposition of punishment by fine,\r\n    penalty, or imprisonment, and generally all matters of a merely\r\n    local or private nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequent paragraphs provide that the provincial legislatures may\r\nexclusively make laws in relation to education, provide for uniformity of\r\nlaws in certain provinces, and also deal with agriculture and immigration,\r\nwith the proviso, however, that such laws shall have effect only so long\r\nand as far as they are not repugnant to any Act of the Canadian\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Australian Commonwealth, it is the powers of the\r\nCentral Parliament that are strictly defined and restricted, contrary to\r\nthe course followed in the Canadian Constitution. As an indication of the\r\npowers left to the State Parliaments it may be well to specify the powers\r\nof the Central Parliament as set forth in the Constitution Act, Paragraphs\r\n51 and 52:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States;\r\n    taxation; bounties; borrowing money; postal, telegraphic,\r\n    telephonic, and other like services; naval and military defence;\r\n    lighthouses, &c.; astronomical and meteorological observations;\r\n    quarantine, fisheries, census and statistics; currency, coinage\r\n    and legal tender; banking, other than State banking; insurance;\r\n    weights and measures; bills of exchange and promissory notes;\r\n    bankruptcy and insolvency; copyright, patents and trade marks;\r\n    naturalisation and aliens; foreign corporations, and trading or\r\n    financial corporations within the Commonwealth; marriage and\r\n    divorce; invalid and old-age pensions; the service and execution\r\n    throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process, and\r\n    the judgments of the courts of the States; the recognition\r\n    throughout the Commonwealth of the laws and judicial proceedings\r\n    of the States; immigration and emigration; the influx of\r\n    criminals; external affairs; control of railways for naval and\r\n    military transport; the acquisition, with the consent of a State,\r\n    of railways of the State; railway construction and extension;\r\n    conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes extending\r\n    beyond the limits of any State; etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nParagraph 107 provides that every power of the Parliament of a Colony\r\nshall, unless exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth, or\r\nwithdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as before. Paragraph\r\n109 stipulates, however, that when a State law is inconsistent with the\r\nlaw of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall,\r\nto the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.\r\n\r\nCertain powers specifically granted to the State Parliaments are set forth\r\nin the following paragraphs, which are of sufficient interest to be cited\r\ntextually:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “112. After uniform duties of customs have been imposed, a State\r\n    may levy on imports or exports, or on goods passing into or out of\r\n    the State, such charges as may be necessary for executing the\r\n    inspection laws of the State; but the net produce of all charges\r\n    so levied shall be for the use of the Commonwealth; and any such\r\n    inspection laws may be annulled by the Parliament of the\r\n    Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n    “113. All fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquids\r\n    passing into any State or remaining therein for use, consumption,\r\n    sale, or storage, shall be subject to the laws of the State as if\r\n    such liquids had been produced in the State.\r\n\r\n    “114. A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of\r\n    the Commonwealth, raise or maintain any naval or military force,\r\n    or impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the\r\n    Commonwealth, nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on\r\n    property of any kind belonging to a State.\r\n\r\n    “115. A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and\r\n    silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts.\r\n\r\n    “117. A subject of the Queen, resident in any State, shall not be\r\n    subject in any other State to any disability or discrimination\r\n    which would not be equally applicable to him if he were a subject\r\n    of the Queen resident in such other State.\r\n\r\n    “118. Full faith and credit shall be given, throughout the\r\n    Commonwealth to the laws, the Public Acts and records, and the\r\n    judicial proceedings of every State.\r\n\r\n    “120. Every State shall make provision for the detention in its\r\n    prisons of persons accused or convicted of offences against the\r\n    laws of the Commonwealth, and for the punishment of persons\r\n    convicted of such offences, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth\r\n    may make laws to give effect to this provision.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn South Africa where, owing to local circumstances, a purely federal\r\nsystem was held to be inappropriate, the powers granted to the subordinate\r\nprovincial legislatures are much more restricted than in Australia and\r\nCanada. In the “South Africa Act, 1909,” Paragraph 59 simply provides that\r\nthe (Central) “Parliament shall have full power to make laws for the\r\npeace, order, and good government of the union,” a formula similar to\r\nthose used in the Canadian and Australian Constitutions as also in the\r\nGladstonian Home Rule Bills. On the other hand, several paragraphs in\r\nSection 5 dealing with the provinces almost recall the centralising\r\ntendencies of France, such as for instance, the provision that the\r\nGovernor-General in Council is to appoint the administrator, or Chief\r\nExecutive Officer, of the province, in whose name all executive acts\r\nrelating to provincial affairs shall be done—an official who presents a\r\ncertain resemblance to the French Prefect.\r\n\r\nThe powers reserved to the Executive Committee of the Provincial Council,\r\npresided over by the Administrator, comprise:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Taxation within the province;\r\n\r\n    The borrowing of money on its sole credit;\r\n\r\n    Education, other than higher education;\r\n\r\n    Agriculture;\r\n\r\n    Hospitals, charitable, municipal and other local institutions;\r\n\r\n    Local works and undertakings within the province, other than\r\n    railways and harbours and bridges connecting two provinces;\r\n\r\n    The imposition of fines, penalties, or imprisonment for enforcing\r\n    provincial laws and generally all matters which, in the opinion of\r\n    the Governor-General in Council, are of a merely local or private\r\n    nature in the province.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking the Canadian Constitution as the most workable model, let us\r\nconsider in the light of that instrument what powers it would be\r\nreasonable to hand over to an Irish Legislature. There are two ways of\r\nproceeding in framing any such Constitution. One is to grant general\r\npowers with specific limitations, the course followed by Mr. Gladstone in\r\nhis two Home Rule Bills. The second is to specify the powers to be given\r\nto the subordinate Legislature, outside of which it cannot act. Good\r\nreasons may be advanced for both methods; but in view of the difficulty of\r\naccurately foreseeing all the needs and necessities to be provided for by\r\na new legislative body and the great risk of overlooking important\r\nmatters, the inclusion of which later on might encounter very serious\r\nobstacles, the method of giving general powers with exceptions and\r\nrestrictions specified in the Act seems the more workmanlike of the two.\r\n\r\nIf the latter course be adopted, following the precedent created in the\r\nBills of 1886 and 1893, the new Legislature will acquire general powers to\r\nmake the necessary laws for the peace, order and good government of\r\nIreland. The powers thus granted in general terms will of course be very\r\nextensive, comprising, as they must, the liberty of raising taxes,\r\nborrowing money, and dealing with education, public worship, property and\r\ncivil rights, land, factory and company laws, the administration of\r\njustice, licensing, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn connection with taxation the important question arises whether the\r\npower should be granted to any unit of a federal state to impose Customs\r\nDuties. In the models we have referred to no local legislature is entitled\r\nto deal with Customs or Tariffs. Indeed all three Constitutions expressly\r\nprovide that there shall be free trade within the limits of the\r\nfederation. It is inconceivable that a British Parliament should ever\r\ngrant, or that the Irish representatives should ever ask for, powers which\r\nwould enable Ireland to set up a radically different fiscal system to that\r\nadopted by the rest of the United Kingdom. Thus the precedents established\r\nby the Constitutions of the different Dominions would undoubtedly have to\r\nbe followed. There is a further question to consider, namely, how and to\r\nwhat extent it will be possible to reconcile any conflict that may arise\r\nbetween the powers exercised by the central and local legislatures in\r\ncollecting taxes. For instance is the income tax to be retained as a\r\npurely Imperial tax, or is the Irish Parliament to have power to levy,\r\neither in substitution for it or in addition to it, an income tax of its\r\nown? The same question arises with regard to excise duties. As no income\r\ntax is imposed in any of the three self-governing Dominions referred to,\r\ntheir constitutions throw no light on this point. Nor does the\r\nConstitution of the German Empire, as there the income tax is a state and\r\nnot an Imperial tax. A solution of this problem might be possible on two\r\nlines. One by allowing the Irish Government to impose its own income tax,\r\npaying a fixed contingent to the British Treasury. The second method would\r\nbe to allow the Irish Parliament to make additions to the British tax, in\r\nthe way that German municipalities are allowed to make additions to the\r\nState income tax. Something of this kind seems contemplated under the\r\nGovernment Bill.\r\n\r\nIn the Dominions licenses for the sale of alcoholic liquors, excise\r\nduties, and land taxes are all imposed by the States. They might also be\r\nvery well made State, that is to say Irish, taxes in Ireland. The future\r\nfinancial relations between Ireland and Great Britain, however, are dealt\r\nwith in another chapter.\r\n\r\nIn considering what subjects would naturally be withdrawn from the\r\njurisdiction of the future Irish Legislature, as of other subsequent\r\nBritish local legislatures, it will be well to see which of these\r\nexclusions are common to the Canadian and Australian Constitutions. These\r\nare: trade and commerce, indirect taxation, borrowing money, postal,\r\ntelegraphic, and telephonic services, naval and military defence,\r\nlighthouses, etc., quarantine, fisheries, census and statistics, currency,\r\ncoinage and legal tender, banking, other than State banking, weights and\r\nmeasures, bills of exchange and promissory notes, bankruptcy and\r\ninsolvency, copyrights patents and trade marks, naturalization and aliens,\r\nmarriage and divorce. There are also a few differences in the matter of\r\nexclusions between the two Dominions. For instance, Canada’s list of\r\nreservations for the Central Parliament begins with “The Public Debt and\r\nProperty,” for which there is no exactly corresponding heading in the\r\nAustralian Constitution. This Canadian list also includes navigation and\r\nshipping, savings banks, the criminal law and penitentiaries. On the other\r\nhand the subjects reserved for the Central Parliament in Australia,\r\ncomprise, _inter alia_, bounties, insurance, other than State insurance,\r\ntrading or financial corporations, invalid and old-age pensions,\r\nimmigration and emigration, “external affairs,” control of railways for\r\nmilitary and naval transport purposes, railway construction and extension,\r\nindustrial conciliation and arbitration, etc.\r\n\r\nThe essential exclusions from the jurisdiction of State Legislatures are,\r\nof course, national defence, treaty making powers, laws affecting foreign\r\ntrade and shipping, lighthouses, coinage and legal tender, trade marks,\r\npatents and copyrights to which might very well be added factory\r\nlegislation, company legislation and the laws affecting negotiable\r\ninstruments. It would seem a pity to break up the legislation on subjects\r\nthat are less of local than of general interest, thus adding to their\r\nlegal difficulties by diversity of legislation. As regards factory laws\r\nthe question of the position under international conventions of an Irish\r\nLegislature demands specially careful consideration. There are, at\r\npresent, two international conventions relating to factory laws, namely,\r\nthose concerning the prohibition of white phosphorus in match\r\nmanufacturing, and night work by women in industrial occupations. It is\r\nlikely that they will shortly be followed by others regulating the hours\r\nof work of women and young persons and prohibiting night work by boys\r\nunder eighteen. It is desirable that the advantages of such conventions\r\nshould be retained for the Irish industrial worker.\r\n\r\nThe justification of most of the exclusions just enumerated is\r\nsufficiently obvious and their enforcement in most of the Dominion\r\nConstitutions show that by common consent they have been accepted as\r\nreasonable, as for instance those dealing with national defence,\r\ntreaty-making, peace and war, and the rights and privileges of the Crown.\r\n\r\nThere remains, perhaps the most important point of all, namely the control\r\nor power of restriction to be exercised by the Imperial Parliament over\r\nthe legislation of the new Irish Legislature by means of a veto. The\r\nCanadian Constitution confers upon the Dominion Government the same powers\r\nof disallowance of Acts of the provincial legislatures as belonged to the\r\nImperial Government prior to 1867. According to Sir John Bourinot\r\n(“Parliamentary Procedure”), the Minister of Justice in 1868, laid down\r\ncertain principles of procedure which have been generally followed up to\r\nthe present time. On receipt of the Acts passed in any province they are\r\nimmediately referred to the Minister of Justice who reports upon them. If\r\nthe Minister considers an Act free from objection and his report is\r\napproved by the Governor-General in Council, such approval is forthwith\r\ncommunicated to the Provincial Government. The Minister of Justice makes\r\nseparate reports on those Acts which he may consider: (1) as being\r\naltogether illegal or unconstitutional; (2) as illegal or unconstitutional\r\nin part; (3) as, in case of concurrent legislation, clashing with the\r\nlegislation of the general Parliament; (4) as affecting the interests of\r\nthe Dominion generally. It has also been the practice (adds Sir John\r\nBourinot) in the case of measures only partially defective, not to\r\ndisallow the Act in the first instance, but, if the general interest\r\npermits such a course, to give the local government an opportunity of\r\nconsidering the objections to such legislation and of remedying the\r\ndefects thereof. In his book “How Canada is Governed,” Sir John Bourinot\r\nmakes some pertinent remarks upon the method of dealing with such cases:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Governor in Council can within one year from its receipt\r\n    disallow an Act of a provincial legislature, and consequently\r\n    prevent it becoming law.... As a rule it is the wiser policy to\r\n    obtain an opinion from the Courts in all cases of doubt ... rather\r\n    than use a political power which is regarded with suspicion by the\r\n    provinces. The law allows such reference to the Supreme Court in\r\n    Canada.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Australia, where the powers of the States were established long before\r\nthe Commonwealth came into existence, there is no direct power of veto,\r\nbut in 1903 and subsequently, Acts were passed by the Commonwealth\r\nParliament giving the High Court jurisdiction in matters arising under the\r\nConstitution or involving its interpretation. Thus, in the words of Mr. W.\r\nHarrison Moore, Dean of the Faculty of Law in the University of Melbourne,\r\nin his “Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia,” “the Commonwealth\r\nGovernment and the State Governments are in their relations independent\r\nand not hierarchical. There is no such general supervision of the State in\r\nthe exercise of the powers belonging to it as is enjoyed by the Dominion\r\nGovernment over the Provinces of Canada.... The observance by the\r\nCommonwealth Government and the States of the limits set to their powers\r\nis secured by the action of the courts whose judicial duties may involve\r\nthe determination of the validity of the authority under which acts are\r\ndone, whether that authority is the Crown, a subordinate legislature, or\r\nany whatsoever save the Imperial Parliament.”\r\n\r\nIf the Canadian example be followed the Imperial Parliament will retain\r\npowers of control of such a far reaching character over Irish legislation,\r\nas ought to dispel the fears of timid souls who are reluctant to entrust\r\nthe Irish people with the task of working out their own destiny. The\r\nCanadian veto has not been a dead letter, but has exercised its\r\nrestraining influence, both actively and passively, over the Provincial\r\nLegislatures, which have naturally been averse to allowing matters to come\r\nto a crisis necessitating its use. Further, to follow precedent, the\r\ninterpretation of the powers to be granted by the new Irish Constitution\r\nshould rest in the last resort in an appeal to the Privy Council.\r\n\r\nWith both these safeguards inserted in the Home Rule Bill much of the\r\nobjection commonly felt against the creation of an Irish Parliament, an\r\nobjection largely due to loose thinking, should disappear. It may be\r\nargued that both in Canada and Australia disputes do occasionally occur\r\nbetween the State Legislatures and the Central Parliaments as to their\r\nrespective rights. That is one of the inevitable disadvantages of a\r\nfederal regime, but, as a very distinguished Canadian statesman once said\r\nto the writer, the counterbalancing advantages of a de-centralized system\r\nfar outweigh all such drawbacks. No student of current politics can be\r\nblind to the fundamental fact that the amalgamating of the Parliaments of\r\nScotland, Ireland and England into one legislature, without at the same\r\ntime unifying the legislation of those countries, has produced a state of\r\ncongestion and overwork which cannot be permanently tolerated. In existing\r\ncircumstances neither matters affecting the whole Empire nor local\r\nlegislative needs can secure a sufficient expenditure either of energy or\r\ntime to do them justice. By partially reversing the process of unification\r\nthrough a devolution of powers to local legislatures we should be\r\nfollowing a precedent that has proved successful in other parts of the\r\nEmpire and in foreign countries while at the same time putting our action\r\ninto harmony with the true process of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.—Contemporary Ireland And The Religious Question\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(I) A Catholic View. BY MONSIGNOR O’RIORDAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is as characteristic of those who have fallen in fortune to talk of\r\ntheir wealth as it is of the consumptive to talk of their health. It is\r\nnatural. If they were conscious of having the reality they would not feel\r\nthe need of convincing others that they had it. For a like reason those\r\nspeak most of virtues and gifts who have them least. One rightly suspects\r\nthe spirit of those who keep insisting that all are intolerant who think\r\nand act on other principles and in other ways than theirs. The word\r\ntolerance has met the fate of other words which denote excellent things;\r\nit has come to be misused. “Tolerance,” like “religion,” “liberty,” etc.,\r\nhas become a shibboleth, and like these it has been run to death.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of tolerance we necessarily refer to evil of some sort. In\r\nthe matter of truth or untruth we are said to tolerate what is untrue, or\r\nwhat we think to be untrue. In the matter of right or wrong, we are said\r\nto tolerate what is wrong, or what we think to be wrong. If one says that\r\nhe is tolerant of that in another which he himself believes to be true or\r\nright, he speaks as one who does not understand what he says. It is the\r\nsame as saying that he is tolerant of his own convictions; in fact, that\r\nhe tolerates himself. One is said to be tolerant of that in another which\r\nhe thinks to be erroneous or wrong. Now, every principle which a man holds\r\nis a law to him. He may be mistaken; his principles may be false; but\r\nwhilst he holds them as his principles he cannot under pain of\r\ninconsistency disown them in word or deed. No man has proprietary rights\r\nin principles. One has no right to compromise them. One may not barter\r\nthem away, may not make them the basis of a policy of give and take. To do\r\nso would be to treat them not as principles but as mere opinions.\r\nPrinciples are things to stand on, not things to play with as with pawns\r\non a chessboard. He who, whilst he professes some principle of belief or\r\nconduct in religious or civil life, is ready to agree with his neighbour\r\nin the opposite shows little regard for truth and little sense of duty. He\r\nwho for the sake of some convenience is prepared to play with his\r\nprinciples has practically no principles at all. Such is one who professes\r\nuniversal toleration, although no person would be more pained at being\r\nthought an unprincipled man. It is a logical necessity for everyone to be\r\nintolerant of principles opposed to his own. In matters of mere _opinion_\r\none may be, and ought to be, tolerant of the opinions of others, since in\r\nface of those opinions he cannot claim an objective certainty for his own.\r\nLet us illustrate this. A rationalist who denies the existence of any\r\nhigher than natural causes cannot admit any event to be miraculous. He may\r\nascribe it to some hypothetical natural cause, or he may have no cause to\r\nassign; but he cannot on principle assign a supernatural cause, for the\r\nsimple reason that he ignores anything above the natural forces which come\r\nwithin the sphere of experience. Thus the rationalist who claims tolerance\r\nas his characteristic virtue is intolerant of any doctrine which supposes\r\nthe supernatural. He must be so, or he lets the ground go from under his\r\nfeet. Again, the Protestant on his principle of private judgment must be\r\nintolerant of any doctrine which supposes an infallible authority on earth\r\nclaiming a divine commission to teach us the meaning of divinely Revealed\r\nTruths. A Catholic who believes in a Church of divine institution, one,\r\nvisible, infallible, cannot be tolerant of a doctrine which makes\r\ndifferent Churches belong by equal right to Christianity, each whilst\r\nconflicting with the others claiming Christ for its Founder. For the same\r\nreason a Catholic cannot be tolerant of a theory which holds all religions\r\nto be equally useful; that is, equally useless. He cannot be tolerant of\r\nany theory which involves a denial of Catholic doctrine, since he\r\nacknowledges an infallible authority as the source of the Catholic\r\ndoctrine which he holds. I am now and here neither asserting nor denying\r\nany theory or any doctrine, Catholic or non-Catholic. I am only setting\r\nforth the inconsistency implied in the toleration of principles opposed to\r\none’s own, whatever those principles be. Is it then irreclaimable\r\nprejudice, or indifference to the obligation of principle, that makes some\r\npersons throw up their arms and raise a cry of horror when they hear that\r\nsome Catholic has been excommunicated for having denied or questioned some\r\nArticle of Catholic faith? What is taken as a matter of course and of\r\ncommon justice in every society and in every club in the country, namely\r\nthat one who is false to his society and unfaithful to its rules deserves\r\nexpulsion, is stigmatised as intolerance and moral tyranny in the Catholic\r\nChurch. There are certain rules in every association which a member may\r\nnot break under pain of expulsion. But a man may say what he likes, write\r\nwhat he likes, do as he likes; may deny every doctrine, despise every\r\nprinciple, and may nevertheless have, according to some, a right to remain\r\na member of the Catholic Church out of which only Romish intolerance would\r\ndrive him.\r\n\r\nEveryone then, whatever be his religious, philosophical, political, or\r\nsocial principles, must be intolerant of principles which are opposed to\r\nhis own. Tolerance, however, claims a place in matters of opinion. But\r\nmust not one think another’s opinions false if they are opposed to his\r\nown? Certainly; but, being only opinions, one has no right to claim a\r\nmonopoly of certainty for one’s own as against those of others. Opinions\r\nhave no claim to the privilege of principles. And what is true in theory\r\nof opinions holds in practice in matters of principle. One cannot, it is\r\ntrue, be tolerant of principles opposed to his own; but others must not\r\nsuffer at his hands because they own principles which are not his.\r\nEveryone must have credit for honesty, since one cannot fathom the depths\r\nof another’s conscience. The Catholic Church, not to speak of its\r\nindividual members, disowns such a pretension as that; _Ecclesia non\r\njudicat de internis_ is a maxim in Catholic theology. Thus, Catholic\r\nteaching, whilst it binds Catholics to be intolerant of principles and\r\ndoctrines which it condemns, obliges them also to be tolerant of those who\r\nhold those principles and doctrines for the sake of the sincerity which it\r\npresumes in those who hold them. If we compare this tolerance, imposed as\r\na duty by Catholic teaching, with the unlimited tolerance professed by\r\nsome who assert the autonomy of individual reason, we shall find a\r\ncontrast between, for instance, the noble tolerance of St. Francis de\r\nSales and the bigotry of Voltaire. They were fellow countrymen. Each had\r\ngreat natural gifts, mental acquirements, and uncommon literary power. St.\r\nFrancis lived a century before Voltaire, and, therefore, nearer to what\r\nwould now be called those traditions of bigotry from which Voltaire helped\r\nso much to set us free. Yet the latter let his pen splutter on all who\r\ndared to differ from him; the former in all his controversies dressed his\r\narguments with honey instead of vinegar. That charity which disposes one\r\nto see good faith and honesty of purpose in persons in spite of their\r\nerrors, is the only true source whence the spirit of toleration must flow\r\ninto civil society. Toleration coming from any other source can give no\r\nguarantee of permanence; for it begins with expediency, and ends with it.\r\nBut the toleration which separates a man’s sincerity from his possible\r\nerrors, and which in civil life ignores the latter for the sake of the\r\nformer, is founded on principle, and is above expediency or the changing\r\ncombination of human affairs.\r\n\r\nThe sincerity of a man who professes tolerance of principles which he\r\nbelieves to be false is to be suspected; he should be taken as one who is\r\npractically indifferent to truth or error. One can rely on the fidelity of\r\nhim who professes tolerance of others, in spite of some personal views of\r\ntheirs which he abhors, because of the sincerity with which, as he\r\npresumes, they entertain those views. But if they should so obtrude those\r\nviews into public life as to affect the rights of him who repudiates them,\r\nit becomes another matter. That would be an aggression on the civil rights\r\nof others; and no person should let himself be made a victim in the name\r\nof toleration.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a significant fact that Catholic Maryland, before American\r\nIndependence came, was the one State in America in which no person had to\r\nsuffer civil disabilities for conscience sake. Members of Protestant sects\r\nwho had to fly from the intolerance of more powerful Protestant sects in\r\nNew England States always found toleration and a home there. Bancroft, the\r\nProtestant historian of the United States, writes of Maryland:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Its history is the history of benevolence, gratitude, and\r\n    toleration. The Catholics who were oppressed by the laws of\r\n    England were sure to find a peaceful asylum in the quiet harbours\r\n    of the Chesapeake, and there, too, Protestants were sheltered from\r\n    Protestant intolerance.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an equally significant fact that later on the non-Catholics of\r\nMaryland, in the day of their power, placed grievous disabilities on the\r\nchildren of those Catholics who had given their exiled fathers a refuge in\r\ntheir hour of need.\r\n\r\nI will now consider how far those principles which I have set forth have\r\nfound application in Ireland. I know no country where tolerance and\r\nintolerance are more talked of than there. It is sometimes good to talk\r\ntolerance, but it is always better to practise it. The word is not heard\r\nso much from Irish Catholics. Their relation to it is that they are\r\nconstantly engaged in defending themselves from charges of intolerance\r\npoured out upon them from the vantage ground of ascendency. I doubt\r\nwhether it is worth while to assure our accusers that those charges are\r\nnot deserved. Those who call us intolerant in spite of our conduct will\r\ndiscard our assurance in spite of our word. He who is in the habit of\r\ncalling his neighbour intolerant is not likely to trust him as truthful.\r\nThere are in every race and class individuals of an intolerant spirit. It\r\nhas always been so, and will always be so. Those exceptions will remain in\r\nspite of the highest principles of a religion, a race, or a class. The\r\nspirit of intolerance will be found in individuals within a class, as well\r\nas between classes; and in actual life society subdivides itself down to\r\nthe units. Religion has been for the past few centuries the great cleavage\r\nline along which the spirit of intolerance is supposed to play in the\r\ndistribution of privileges and power in civil life in Ireland. How are we\r\nto determine on which side tolerance and intolerance lie? Not certainly by\r\nwitnesses on either side giving testimony in their own favour. We had\r\nbetter let facts speak then; or, if we accept the evidence of persons, we\r\nshould hear what they have to say only of those of the other side.\r\n\r\nThe Synod of Kilkenny met in May, 1642. It was held by the Catholic\r\nBishops of Ireland in connection with the Kilkenny Confederation. That\r\nConfederation was National and Catholic; part of its purpose was to\r\nsupport King Charles against those who sought to dethrone him. He did not\r\npersonally deserve much sympathy from the Irish Catholics; nevertheless,\r\nwho were the Loyalists then? Ireland was in a state of war, and the rebels\r\nwere not the Catholics. Now the 18th Decree of the Synod of Kilkenny is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Wee ordaine and decree that all and every such as from the\r\n    beginning of this present warre have invaded the possessions or\r\n    goods, as well moveable as unmoveable, spirituall or temporal, of\r\n    any Catholic whether Irish or English, _or also of any Irish\r\n    Protestant_ being not adversaries of this cause, and doe detaine\r\n    any such goods, shall be excommunicated, as by this present Decree\r\n    wee doe excommunicate them, if admonished they do not amend, &c.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Decree speaks for itself; it protects Protestants equally with\r\nCatholics. The “Lawes and Orders of Warre,” issued by Castlehaven the\r\nfollowing year, and the conduct of the Confederates throughout, show the\r\nsame spirit of toleration which is expressed in the Decree of the Bishops.\r\n\r\nAnother test of tolerance came with the restored power of Irish Catholics\r\nhalf a century later. How did they use their opportunity? Lecky knew it as\r\nwell as anyone of his time; he was moreover out of sympathy with the\r\nreligious and national ideals of the Irish Catholics. Now Lecky, referring\r\nto deeds of violence which took place in Ireland, writes (“History of\r\nIreland in the Eighteenth Century,” Vol. I., pp. 408, 409):\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Whoever will examine these episodes with impartiality may easily\r\n    convince himself that their connection with religion has, in most\r\n    cases, been superficial. Religious cries have been sometimes\r\n    raised, religious enthusiasm has been often appealed to in the\r\n    agony of the struggle; but the real causes have been conflicts of\r\n    races and classes, the struggle of a nationality against\r\n    annihilation, the invasion of property in land, or the pressure of\r\n    extreme poverty. Amongst the Catholics, at least, religious\r\n    intolerance has not been a prevailing vice, and those who have\r\n    studied closely the history and character of the Irish people can\r\n    hardly fail to be struck with the deep respect for sincere\r\n    religion in every form which they have commonly evinced.... In\r\n    spite of the fearful calamities that followed the Reformation, it\r\n    is a memorable fact that not a single Protestant suffered for his\r\n    religion in Ireland during all the period of the Marian\r\n    persecution in England. The treatment of Bedell during the\r\n    outbreak of 1641, and the Act establishing liberty of conscience\r\n    passed by the Irish Parliament of 1689 in the full flush of the\r\n    brief Catholic ascendency under James II., exhibit very remarkably\r\n    this aspect of the Irish character.”\r\n\r\n\r\nReferring to that Catholic Parliament of Ireland, he says (Vol. I., p.\r\n117):\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The members of the House of Commons were almost all new men,\r\n    completely inexperienced in public business, and animated by the\r\n    resentment of bitter wrongs. Many of them were sons of some of the\r\n    3,000 proprietors who, without trial and without compensation, had\r\n    been deprived by the Act of Settlement of the estates of their\r\n    ancestors. To all of them the confiscations of Ulster, the fraud\r\n    of Strafford, the long train of calamities were recent and vivid\r\n    events. Old men were still living who might have remembered them\r\n    all, and there was probably scarcely a man in the Irish Parliament\r\n    of 1689 who had not been deeply injured by them in his fortunes or\r\n    his family. It will hardly appear surprising to candid men that a\r\n    Parliament so constituted, and called together amidst the\r\n    excitement of a civil war, should have displayed much violence,\r\n    much disregard for vested interests. Its measures, indeed, were\r\n    not all criminal. By one Act, which was far in advance of the age,\r\n    it established perfect religious liberty in Ireland, &c.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom that time till our own the Catholics of Ireland have had little\r\nopportunity of showing whether they were tolerant or otherwise. During the\r\nlong and dreary meantime the problem before them was not what sort of\r\ncivil life they should live, but whether or how they could manage to live\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nSo late as 1759, Lord Chancellor Bowes, in giving judgment in a famous\r\ntrial in Dublin, declared that “The law did not suppose a papist to exist\r\nin Ireland.” I have no desire to recall the story of how toleration fared\r\nin Ireland down to recent times. It is not necessary, and it is a\r\ndisagreeable recollection. He would be very bold or very credulous who\r\nwould think of doubting or denying what that history has been. I take up\r\n“Thom’s Almanac” of half a century ago, and I find that so late as that\r\ntime the public offices were occupied almost exclusively by non-Catholics,\r\nfrom the Lord-Lieutenancy down to the Clerkship of Petty Sessions; and I\r\nthink that it was so down to the office of the rural process-server. How\r\ndid it come to pass that Catholics were kept outside, and that\r\nnon-Catholics got within? Surely not that Catholics willingly yielded all\r\npublic positions to their neighbours! The arrangement was therefore made\r\nby the other side. And what was the reason of that monopoly? Surely not\r\nthat no Catholic was capable of any civil position except that of paying\r\nrates and taxes to the Crown and rent to the landlord. The exclusion was\r\nclearly the political penalty which Catholicism had to pay for its\r\nprinciples; the monopoly was the political premium which was awarded to\r\nthose of the other side.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics of Ireland have been gradually working their way towards\r\ncivil equality. But every step has been disputed. Every claim for civil\r\nequality made by those who formed the vast majority of the population and\r\nwho bore the burden of civil duties was met with a charge of intolerance,\r\nand with a protest against intruding religion into the affairs of civil\r\nlife. That is to say, those who had already secured for themselves\r\npolitical and social privileges through religious exclusiveness raised the\r\ncry of religious exclusiveness against the vast majority of the population\r\nfor claiming their just share of civil rights as they bore their share of\r\ncivil duties. Catholics had either to remain resigned to their condition,\r\nor to protest against their faith being made a bar between them and civil\r\njustice. In doing so they have not sought to intrude religion into purely\r\ncivil affairs; they rather have sought to extrude religious intolerance\r\nwhich, having taken up its abode, slammed the door in their face. Thus\r\nwhen Catholics claimed their civil rights it was called religious\r\nexclusiveness; when their neighbours were privileged by religious\r\nexclusiveness it was called civil rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(II) Catholic Tolerance in Practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a century ago Wm. Parnell, an Irish Protestant who knew Irish\r\nCatholics and their history well, wrote that “The Irish Roman Catholics\r\nare the only sect that ever resumed power without exercising vengeance.”\r\nLet us see if he was a true prophet as well as a true historian. When he\r\nwrote his “Historical Apology of the Irish Catholics” they were helpless,\r\nand almost hopeless. During the past eighty years they have been gradually\r\nregaining instalments of their civil rights. Their numerical strength\r\ncould, in nearly every corner of the country, use those rights which they\r\nalready have as an instrument wherewith to avenge the past. Have they, in\r\nfact, used their power thus?\r\n\r\nFor the sake of saving space I pass over Government and other such\r\nnominations. A better test of tolerance and intolerance is to be found in\r\nthe statistics of public appointments to responsible positions which are\r\nelective. We get in that way a better key to the popular feeling.\r\n\r\nNow, in recent centuries, and till 1842, Dublin was not allowed to have a\r\nCatholic Lord Mayor. It elected O’Connell at its first opportunity. And\r\nwere the Protestant citizens ostracized henceforth? Since then it has had\r\n23 Protestant Mayors and 38 Protestant Sheriffs. At present, its City\r\nMarshal, its City Surveyor and his assistant, Superintendent Electrical\r\nEngineer and four assistants, Drainage Engineer and two assistants,\r\nSuperintendent Medical Officer of Health, Veterinary Inspector, Collector\r\nof Market Dues, and several other important offices are entrusted to\r\nnon-Catholics. And the Catholics form the vast majority of the population.\r\n\r\nIn Belfast, the non-Catholics are about twice the number of the Catholics.\r\nThe Corporation has never had a Catholic Mayor. Until a few years ago,\r\nwhen the City wards were re-distributed by order of Parliament, there was\r\nno Catholic Member of the Corporation. There are about 440 salaried\r\nofficials, of whom about 10 are Catholics; and that these hold no office\r\nof importance may be seen at once in the fact that their combined salaries\r\ndo not amount to more than £800 a year; whilst the Corporation pays in\r\nsalaries about £70,000 a year. The anomaly is felt; and the apology made\r\nfor it is that the Catholics hold offices quite in proportion to the rates\r\nthey pay. It is implied that the Catholics are poor and pay little rates.\r\nThe apology is not more creditable than the anomaly it is made to explain.\r\nIt appears to be the custom in Belfast for the landlords to pay rates for\r\nthe houses rented from them; the tenants thus pay rates in their rents.\r\nThat practice nullifies the apology.\r\n\r\nI pass now to the Counties. Co. Cork has a population of 403,000; of which\r\n365,000 are Catholics, and 38,000 are non-Catholics. Of the salaried\r\nofficials in the County, 151 are Catholics and 40 are non-Catholics.\r\n\r\nCo. Tipperary has a population of 160,500; of which 151,000 are Catholics,\r\nand 9,500 are non-Catholics. There are 60 salaried officials, of whom 43\r\nare Catholics and 17 are non-Catholics.\r\n\r\nCo. Kerry has a population of 165,000; of which 160,000 are Catholics, and\r\n5,000 are non-Catholics. There are 112 salaried officials, of whom 93 are\r\nCatholics and 19 are non-Catholics.\r\n\r\nCo. Clare has a population of 112,000; of which 110,000 are Catholics, and\r\n2,000 are Protestants. There are 68 salaried officials, of whom 62 are\r\nCatholics and 6 are Protestants.\r\n\r\nSo much for the South; let us pass to the North.\r\n\r\nCo. Antrim has a population of 196,000; of which 40,000 are Catholics and\r\n156,000 are non-Catholics. There are 65 salaried officials, of whom 5 are\r\nCatholics, and 60 are non-Catholics.\r\n\r\nCo. Armagh has a population of 124,000; of which 56,000 are Catholics, and\r\n68,000 are non-Catholics. There are 50 salaried officials, of whom 3 are\r\nCatholics and 47 are non-Catholics.\r\n\r\nCo. Tyrone has a population of 150,000; of which 82,000 are Catholics, and\r\n68,000 are non-Catholics. There are 52 salaried officials, of whom 5 are\r\nCatholics, and 47 are non-Catholics.\r\n\r\nCo. Fermanagh has a population of 65,000; of which 36,000 are Catholics\r\nand 29,000 are non-Catholics. There are 75 salaried officials, of whom 17\r\nare Catholics and 58 are non-Catholics. It will be observed also that in\r\nthose counties supposed to be Protestant, the Catholic population of\r\nTyrone, Armagh, and Fermanagh is 174,000, whilst the Protestant population\r\nis only 165,000. In Co. Antrim only, the Protestants are in a vast\r\nmajority. And in Ballymoney, Antrim, Portrush, and some other towns of\r\nthat county, there is not 1 Catholic in any elective body. On the other\r\nhand, I find that in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, where the Protestants are to\r\nthe Catholics in the proportion of 1:9 of the population, they are in the\r\nproportion of 1:4 in the Borough Council. In Kinsale, Co. Cork, where the\r\nProtestants bear an extremely small proportion to the Catholics, they are\r\nas 1:4 in the Borough Council.\r\n\r\nNine years ago, through much trouble and correspondence, I made an inquiry\r\ninto the provision made in Irish workhouses for the religious interests of\r\ntheir Protestant paupers. I made an analysis of the results, some of which\r\nI quote here from the 18th Chapter of “Catholicity and Progress in\r\nIreland” (pp. 346-350).\r\n\r\n\r\n    “In 1882 there were 163 workhouses in Ireland; but some have\r\n    disappeared, or have been amalgamated since then. At present there\r\n    are 48 of these in which there is _usually no Protestant_ inmate.\r\n    The Protestant Minister—\r\n\r\n    In 7 of these receives no salary.\r\n    In 1, a salary of £4 a year for attending to nobody.\r\n    In 5, £5, ditto\r\n    In 2, £6\r\n    In 17, £10\r\n    In 2, £12\r\n    In 4, £15\r\n    In 5, £20\r\n    In 4, £25\r\n    In 1, £30\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 25 workhouses with only _one_ Protestant pauper in each, and the\r\nProtestant chaplains receive in each £21 a year on an average. There are\r\n12 workhouses with only _two_ Protestant paupers in each on an average:\r\nthere is a Protestant chaplain for each; they receive on an average £21 a\r\nyear. There are 12 workhouses with only _three_ Protestant paupers in each\r\non an average. Each has a Protestant chaplain: they receive on an average\r\n£30 a year. There are 5 workhouses with only _four_ Protestant paupers in\r\neach on an average: their Protestant chaplains receive an average salary\r\nof £20 a year. There are 5 workhouses with only _five_ Protestant paupers\r\nin each on an average: their Protestant chaplains receive an average\r\nsalary of £33 a year. There are 7 workhouses with only _six_ Protestant\r\npaupers in each on an average: their Protestant chaplains receive salaries\r\nof £25 a year on an average. There is 1 workhouse with _seven_ Protestant\r\npaupers on an average: the Protestant chaplain receives £30 a year. There\r\nare 2 workhouses with _eight_ Protestant paupers in each on an average: in\r\n1 of these the Protestant chaplain gets £25 a year, in the other £30. In\r\nall those workhouses I have named there are 194 Protestant paupers on an\r\naverage; and the Protestant chaplains receive a combined salary of £2,000\r\na year for attending them. Now nearly all the Guardians of those\r\nworkhouses are Catholics; those who pay the poor rates are nearly all\r\nCatholics.\r\n\r\nI do not write these facts in complaint: rather with pride. I give them as\r\nevidence of the sort of religious “intolerance” which is practised by\r\nIrish Catholics on those few Protestant paupers; who indeed are so few\r\nthat their having to be in a workhouse at all is not creditable to the\r\nwealthy Protestants of Ireland. The money spent in the vain attempt to\r\nproselytize a certain degraded remnant of the Catholic poor, if spent on\r\nthose few Protestant paupers, would make workhouse life unnecessary for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(III) The Papal Decrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great noise has been made about the _Ne temere_ Decree, and the recent\r\n_Motu proprio_. They have been used to illustrate a phase of Catholic\r\n“intolerance” which is supposed to constitute a constant danger to\r\nsociety. I hope to make plain that those who have raised the cry have been\r\nshouting into space, and that, moreover, they have been throwing stones\r\nout of glass houses. Those laws have been made for Catholics only;\r\nCatholics only are bound by them; therefore only they have a right to\r\nprotest if there be any cause of complaint. Or are we to understand that\r\nCatholics are not free to have their own religious rules and usages\r\nwithout the approval of outsiders? It will be answered: Certainly, but\r\nthis _Ne temere_ Decree might affect Protestants also. How? Well, it\r\nordains that unless Catholics get married before an authorised priest the\r\nmarriage is null; they are not married. Hence, if a Catholic and a\r\nProtestant attempt to get married before a parson or a registrar, as the\r\nlaw of the land allows, there is no marriage in the eyes of the Catholic\r\nChurch, and the Catholic party is bound in conscience to disown it. That\r\nis what has been said; but it is not correct. What the Catholic party\r\nwould be bound in conscience to do in such a case is to set things right\r\nby making it a valid marriage. But what if the parties will not comply\r\nwith the _Ne temere_ law? Then they go their own way, and the Catholic\r\nChurch has no more to say to them. But if the Catholic party, getting\r\nconscience-stricken, should determine to disown it as a marriage, will not\r\nthe Protestant party be the sole sufferer? Not at all; because the\r\nProtestant party can appeal to the law of the land for conjugal rights,\r\nsince in the eyes of the law the marriage is valid; and an attempt by the\r\nCatholic party to contract marriage with anyone else would be punished as\r\nbigamy. On the other hand, if the Protestant party should for any reason\r\ndetermine to disown it as a marriage, the Catholic party cannot in\r\nconscience appeal to the law of the land for conjugal rights; because\r\naccording to the Catholic conscience there are no conjugal rights, since\r\nthere is no marriage. It should be observed that, also in the case of two\r\nCatholics, there is no marriage if they attempt to get married before any\r\nother priest than the authorized priest. The _Ne temere_ Decree was meant\r\nfor Catholics only. It was not at all meant for Protestants, and it can\r\nonly affect a Protestant through a Catholic. Now, the Catholic Church does\r\nnot wish a Protestant to marry a Catholic. Quite otherwise. In fact,\r\nCatholics are forbidden to marry Protestants without a special permission,\r\nwhich is not given without good cause assigned. But if any Protestants\r\nshould desire to marry Catholics, they know the conditions they have to\r\nfulfil. If they object to those conditions they are quite free to seek\r\nsome other partner less tied by religious conditions than a Catholic is.\r\nIf a Protestant say, “I like this Catholic, but I don’t like these\r\nconditions,” the Catholic reply is simple and straight: “If you want the\r\nCatholic you must take the conditions too; it is intolerant conceit for\r\nyou to expect that the Catholic Church should shape its discipline to make\r\nit fit in with some possible affections which might some time or other\r\npossess you.”\r\n\r\nThe result of all the noise made about this _Ne temere_ Decree has been\r\njust what those who have made the noise little thought of, and least of\r\nall desired; namely, it has left them without a shadow of excuse, or even\r\nthe semblance of a grievance. Their cry has become their nemesis. It has\r\nso promulgated the Decree that they, no more than Catholics, can plead\r\nignorance of it, or of the consequence of not observing it. Hence what\r\nthey in future do in regard to it, they will do with their eyes open; and\r\nif they count the cost they have only themselves to blame.\r\n\r\nBut if these remarks I have made help to silence the _Ne temere_ cry,\r\nanother like grievance is not far to seek. It is remarkable that, whilst\r\nthere are several Catholic marriage laws the import of which is exactly\r\nthe same as that of the _Ne temere_ Decree, we never hear a word said\r\nabout them. Here is one: A Protestant has a sister-in-law who is a\r\nCatholic. His wife dies. His Catholic sister-in-law marries him without\r\nthe necessary dispensation. That marriage is null in the eyes of the\r\nCatholic Church. But it is valid before the law of the land since the\r\nDeceased Wife’s Sister’s Marriage Act was passed. That Protestant and his\r\ndeceased wife’s Catholic sister are precisely in the same predicament in\r\nwhich a Protestant and a Catholic are who attempt marriage in defiance of\r\nthe _Ne temere_ Decree. There are other similar instances amongst the\r\nCatholic marriage laws. There have been for centuries. The _Ne temere_\r\nDecree itself is but a slightly modified form of one three centuries old.\r\nThus, if the _Ne temere_ cry is serious, the party who raised it have been\r\nstanding at the mouth of a volcano for generations, and have escaped\r\nunhurt. Why then have those other Catholic marriage laws been left in\r\nplace, whilst the _Ne temere_ Decree has raised a storm? The only\r\ndifference one can see is that the _Ne temere_ Decree happened to appear\r\non the eve of some parliamentary elections, and the consciences of some\r\nscrupulous persons were suddenly awakened to the danger it brought.\r\n\r\n_Tu quoque_ is not a logical reply; but at the tail of an argument it does\r\nnot come amiss. Well, then, in England the law recognises no other\r\nmarriages than those contracted before the parson or the registrar. Let a\r\nProtestant and a Catholic therefore get married before a priest, without\r\nthe presence or knowledge of the parson or the registrar, it is a valid\r\nmarriage in the eyes of the Catholic Church and binds the conscience of\r\nthe Catholic party; but it is no marriage in the eyes of the law. So far\r\nthe case is the exact converse of the _Ne temere_ Decree. But it goes\r\nfarther; for it holds not only in the case of a Protestant and Catholic\r\nbut also in the case of two Catholics. The law of the land will not\r\nrecognise a marriage contracted by two Catholics in their own church and\r\nbefore their own priest, unless the registrar or the parson be present. On\r\nthe contrary, the _Ne temere_ Decree does not in any sense touch the case\r\nof two Protestants. Now, Catholics think, and justly so, that a priest is\r\nquite as qualified a witness for the marriage of Catholics as the parson\r\nis for the marriage of Protestants, or as the registrar is for the\r\nmarriage of either. The Catholics have in this a real grievance; and they\r\nfeel it; yet their consciences have not been so wounded nor their hearts\r\nso broken as to think of exhibiting them bleeding before their country\r\nupon election hustings. Political consciences show strange phenomena.\r\n\r\nWhat is decreed by the _Motu proprio_ has been in force since the\r\nConstitution _Apostolicae Sedis_ was published in 1869. Yet during those\r\nforty-two years nobody seems to have been hurt by it; and nobody seems to\r\nhave been concerned except Catholics till lately. The _Motu proprio_\r\nobliges Catholics, under threat of excommunication not to bring\r\necclesiastics before lay tribunals without the permission of their bishop.\r\nIt binds ecclesiastics equally with lay Catholics. It does not, and\r\ncannot, touch non-Catholics in any sense; a very plain proof of which is\r\nthat it threatens with excommunication those to whom it applies. That\r\ncensure of excommunication should convince anyone that the _Motu proprio_\r\ncannot possibly apply to non-Catholics. They are not within the Church;\r\nand how could those be put outside it who have not been within it? It\r\napplies to Catholics only, whether lay or cleric. But not to all\r\nCatholics. The Holy Office issued a Decree in 1870 in which it declared\r\nthat “the excommunication does not affect subordinates, even though they\r\nbe judges.” A Catholic functionary acting in his official capacity does\r\nnot come under the Decree. It will at once then be seen how unfair are the\r\nfollowing words spoken by Mr. Campbell, who represents the Dublin\r\nUniversity in Parliament. Speaking at a meeting in Dublin on January 4th,\r\n1912, he said of two Irish Catholic Judges: “They might be called upon any\r\nday in the exercise of their duty to their Sovereign to put the law in\r\nforce against a Catholic priest. If they did so, _ipso facto_ they\r\nincurred excommunication.” He thus explained the meaning of the _Motu\r\nproprio_ for his audience, in face of the following words which he also\r\nread for his audience. The excommunication is against “those who compel,\r\nwhether directly or indirectly, lay judges to summon ecclesiastical\r\npersons before lay tribunals.” Thus the excommunication is against _those\r\nwho compel_ the judges; so that Mr. Campbell’s interpretation implies that\r\n_the judges_ are one and the same with _those who compel them_. Catholics,\r\nthen, and Catholics only (clerics as well as lay) are forbidden to bring\r\necclesiastics before lay tribunals, without the permission of their\r\nbishop; which permission, the Holy Office decrees, “the bishop shall never\r\nrefuse, in case he fails to reconcile the parties.” If a Catholic (lay or\r\necclesiastic) thinks that an ecclesiastic, for instance, owes him a debt,\r\nand the ecclesiastic denies it and refuses to pay, the Catholic (priest or\r\nlayman) who makes the claim is bound by the _Motu proprio_ to have\r\nrecourse to the bishop first, in order to have the matter arranged\r\namicably. If the bishop fails to settle it, he is not left free to give or\r\nrefuse his consent to have the case brought before the Civil Court. The\r\nHoly Office decrees that “he shall never refuse.” Even in those times and\r\ncountries when and where Ecclesiastical Courts existed to try the civil\r\ncases of clerics, the purpose of the _Privilegium Fori_ was not to grant\r\necclesiastics any immunity from the civil law of their country, but to\r\nprovide that in their civil cases they should be tried by an\r\nEcclesiastical Court. The privilege was not as to the law of the land, but\r\nas to the court that was to try them according to that law.\r\n\r\nWhat the _Motu proprio_ orders is just what Catholic instinct moves every\r\nCatholic worthy of the name to do. In Ireland and everywhere, Catholics,\r\nand many Protestants also, if they think they have a cause of complaint\r\nagainst a priest, for debt or otherwise, make known their case first to\r\nhis bishop. If the bishop fails to compose the question, then they bring\r\nthe case before the lay tribunals; permission to do which, as the Holy\r\nOffice lays down, the bishop “shall never refuse.”\r\n\r\nI have explained the meaning and scope of this _Motu proprio_ as though it\r\napplied to Ireland. But according to the evidence of Cardinal Cullen, the\r\nhighest authority on Canon Law who has lived in these countries for a\r\ncentury, the Caput _Cogentes_ of the _Apostolicae Sedis_ does not hold in\r\nIreland; and that being so, the _Motu proprio_ does not apply to Ireland,\r\nfor it is a confirmation of the Caput _Cogentes_.\r\n\r\nWhat this awful _Motu proprio_ orders, then, is just what fraternal\r\ncharity, a sense of the fitness of things, even common sense, would\r\nsuggest. So befitting does the procedure ordered by the _Motu proprio_\r\nappear to a writer in the January number of _The Review of Reviews_ that\r\nhe says, “it might very well be extended to all Christian men, whether lay\r\nor clerical”; and he suggests that the civil authorities in England would\r\ndo wisely to take a leaf out of the book of Pius X.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, something parallel to it exists in every society.\r\nThere is not an association of any kind in England, Ireland, or elsewhere,\r\nwhich has not some rules which bind its members under pain of expulsion.\r\nIn Chapter VII. of his “Middle Ages,” Hallam writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The spiritual Courts in England, whose jurisdiction is so\r\n    multifarious, and in general so little of a religious nature, had,\r\n    till lately, no means of compelling an appearance much less of\r\n    enforcing a sentence, but by excommunication.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHe writes in a note:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “By a recent Statute, the 33 Geo. III., c. 127, the writ, _de\r\n    excommunicato capiendo_, as a process in contempt was abolished in\r\n    England, but retained in Ireland.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth in England and in Ireland there are, of course, rules for expulsion,\r\nor excommunication, in every union, society, and club in the country. But\r\na rule more like the _Motu proprio_ than any that I know of, is in the\r\nconstitutions of the Dublin University which Mr. Campbell represents in\r\nParliament. According to Letters Patent 13 Charles I.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “All domestic differences shall be examined, and if possible\r\n    decided within the College.... He who brings another into Court,\r\n    without the consent of the Provost and the majority of the Senior\r\n    Fellows, shall be expelled from the College.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is in every particular like the _Motu proprio_ of which Mr. Campbell\r\nspoke, in a Catholic city and country, as “an arrogant and insolent\r\ndecree” which “aims a deadly blow at the sanctity and security of\r\nproperty.” I do not believe that he was conscious of the offensiveness of\r\nhis words. But such has been the fruit and habit of Protestant privilege\r\nin Ireland. Some, even men of position and education like Mr. Campbell,\r\nremain as if unconscious that the “old order changes.” They fail to fit\r\nthemselves into the change which a century has made; and “If in the green\r\nwood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?” Catholics,\r\nwhilst they have their own thoughts about the constitutions and rules of\r\nother Religious Bodies than theirs, do not meddle with or question them.\r\nThe _Ne temere_ Decree and the _Motu proprio_ are, as I have explained,\r\nfor the discipline of us Catholics exclusively. We do not seek for them\r\nthe approval of outsiders. But we cannot help thinking that the diatribes\r\nto which we have been subjected in connection with those two Pontifical\r\nActs have been inspired rather by political and social jealousy than by a\r\nspirit of toleration or love of fair play. I hope that most non-Catholics\r\nwho read what I have written will be disposed to agree with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(IV) Some Protestant Views.\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) A Church Of Ireland View. BY CANON COURTENAY MOORE, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is under a deep sense of both privilege and responsibility that I\r\ncontribute this article—of privilege because I feel very sensibly the\r\nhonour done me in asking me to write it—and of responsibility because of\r\nthe service it may or may not prove to be. A word about myself may be\r\npardoned and may not be inappropriate.\r\n\r\nI should know something about Ireland, as I was born in Ulster, in which\r\nprovince I lived for seventeen years, and naturally I then and there\r\nlearned to know something of the manners and customs and feelings of\r\nUlstermen. From Ulster I migrated to Leinster, where I spent eight years\r\nin the city of Dublin, six of these years in the University of Dublin, in\r\nwhich ancient seat of learning I was for four years a student in Arts, and\r\nfor two in the Divinity School. On my ordination in 1865, I entered on\r\nclerical life in the Diocese of Cloyne, County of Cork; in which diocese I\r\nhave remained ever since for the long period of close on forty-seven\r\nyears. Therefore I say I ought to know something of Ireland and the Irish\r\nquestion; having been born in Ireland and having lived so long in it in\r\nthree out of the four provinces. Moreover, I have been a regular student\r\nof Irish history, to some extent of the Irish language, and of Irish\r\nArchæology, and, as an Irish Antiquary, I have seen much of my native land\r\nin each and every Province. Strangers seem to think it very easy to make\r\nup their mind on the Irish question—you have only to take a return-ticket\r\nfrom Euston to Killarney, or from Paddington to Rosslare and the thing is\r\ndone! I once heard His Grace Dr. Healy, the Archbishop of Tuam, tell a\r\nstory about the way to acquire an English accent. He said that a certain\r\nDublin Alderman, with a fine Dublin brogue, crossed from Kingstown to\r\nHolyhead; the passage was a rough one; there was much of “the wonderful\r\nup-and-down motion, that comes from the treacherous ocean.” So much indeed\r\nthat the poor alderman lay sick in his berth in Holyhead harbour, and\r\nreturned in the same boat without landing. But—“lo and behold you, sir,”\r\nas we say in Ireland—he came home with a fine English accent, which he\r\nnever lost in later life! Well, some English visitors seem to have the\r\nsame impression about the rapidity and facility with which they can make\r\nup the Irish question. “God help them” is all one can say. I am really not\r\njesting or romancing at all! Within the present week an English literary\r\nlady called on me to interview me. Unfortunately I was out at the time,\r\nbut she left a message to the effect that “she was going to write a book\r\non Ireland,” and wished to talk to me about it! She had only been in the\r\ncountry a few days when she came to this conclusion! This reminds me of\r\nthe story of a certain English nobleman who, when making the grand tour of\r\nEurope, found himself at Rome. He had an interview with the Pope of the\r\nperiod. He asked him could he see and know Rome in a few days time? The\r\nPope replied: “You will imagine you know a good deal of it by that time.”\r\n“Well in a few weeks?” “You will then know less.” “In a few months?”\r\n“Still less.” “In a few years?” “Hardly anything at all.”\r\n\r\nWell, is not this a parallel for the Irish question? It requires the study\r\nof a life-time almost to grapple with it at all—at least in any fairly\r\nsatisfactory and complete form—in any really candid and impartial way. I\r\nmay perhaps be permitted to say that another educational force in my own\r\ntraining on the subject has been, that I love intensely the country and\r\nthe people. Froude opens his charming essay “A Fortnight in Kerry” thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “We have heard much of the wrongs of Ireland, the miseries of\r\n    Ireland, the crimes of Ireland; every cloud has its sunny side;\r\n    and, when all is said, Ireland is still the most beautiful island\r\n    in the world, and the Irish themselves, though their temperament\r\n    is ill-matched with ours, are still amongst the most interesting\r\n    of peoples.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affectionate feeling should not be left out of consideration by\r\noutsiders who wish to understand the Irish Question. It has exercised an\r\nundying and indestructible influence upon the people of the country, and\r\nin certain respects a most beneficial influence. For example, many\r\noutsiders foolishly imagine that Irishmen are very volatile and variable;\r\nin some minor respects they may be, but in the main, no—it is absolutely\r\notherwise. Can you find in the history of any other country greater\r\nfidelity to her own religious and political ideals than Ireland has shown\r\nover and over again—as we say “ever and always?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the preface to this paper seems unduly prolonged, but the reader\r\nmust bear with it somewhat further, as it is necessary.\r\n\r\nAn objector may say to me that I have no right to speak for my fellow\r\nIrish Churchmen _en masse_, as regards their relations with their Roman\r\nCatholic fellow countrymen. Well, in answer to such an objection, which\r\nmay be natural enough, there are several replies. I intend to speak from\r\nmy own first-hand, definite, personal, life-long experiences, such as they\r\nhave been. And is not the inference sufficiently fair and logical that\r\nothers of my clerical brethren, similarly situated, have had just the\r\nsame, or much the same, experiences if they would record them? I do not\r\nclaim that our Roman Catholic neighbours have been kinder to me than to\r\nother Protestant clergy. Testimony from us in the South and West of\r\nIreland is more valuable than testimony from Ulster. In Leinster, Munster\r\nand Connaught, we are brought more directly and distinctly face to face\r\nwith the Roman Church. She has a dominant, nay, a pre-dominant position in\r\nthese three provinces, and yet I hold that this vast numerical superiority\r\nof position does not lead to intolerant or unkindly action. I believe that\r\nthere is far more real kindly feeling and kindly intercourse between\r\nProtestants and Roman Catholics in these Irish provinces than there is in\r\nUlster—and, therefore, I maintain that Irish Protestant Churchmen who live\r\nin these provinces, have a far better right to judge and speak of the\r\nrelative attitude of the two churches than the people of Ulster. For we,\r\nwho do so live, have a larger knowledge and experience and outlook than\r\nthe men of Ulster, whose views are in every sense narrower—geographically,\r\npolitically and religiously. They indeed need to be reminded of the German\r\nproverb: “Hinter dem Berge sind auch Leute” (Behind the mountains there\r\nare also people). We all need to study this saying. Behind the mountains\r\nof our knowledge, of our civilisation, of our success and activity; behind\r\nthe mountains, let us also say, of our ignorance, of our pride and\r\nprejudice, of our contempt—there are also men.\r\n\r\nOf course it is much pleasanter to be able to feel kindly and to speak\r\nkindly of the great majority of one’s fellow-countrymen if it can be done\r\ntruthfully, as we believe it can—than to have to say and do the contrary.\r\nEven allowing for a certain element of unreality and exaggeration and\r\ninsincerity, is not the uniform tone of too many political speeches much\r\ntoo violent and even occasionally too vitriolic? But I have little or no\r\ntemptation to err in this respect, as the bulk of what remains to be said\r\nin this paper is chiefly concerned with facts. Two years after my\r\nordination, the Fenian Rising occurred; this took place in 1867. I saw\r\nsomething of it, not of the Fenians themselves, but of the flying columns\r\nwhich were then scouring the country in pursuit of them. The police\r\nbarrack at Kilmallock was attacked, and Protestant gentry living near\r\nKilfinane in the same county, viz., Limerick, left their houses for\r\nseveral nights and took refuge with the Constabulary. There was at that\r\ntime living at Kilfinane as rector, the Rev. George Wren. He was, as a\r\nclergyman, greatly beloved and respected. When some of his parishioners,\r\nmost of them gentry, were leaving their homes for police protection, the\r\nRoman Catholic farmers in the parish waited on the Rev. George Wren at the\r\nrectory, and begged and intreated of him not to leave it, assuring him\r\nthat “no one should lay a wet finger” on him or any member of his family.\r\nIn consequence of this interview the Rev. Mr. Wren held his ground, and\r\nwas the only Protestant gentleman in the immediate district who did so. It\r\nwas exceedingly creditable to him, and to the deputation who waited on\r\nhim. I have never forgotten this incident.\r\n\r\nI remember well the excitement produced in Irish church circles by Mr.\r\nGladstone’s Church Act in 1869 and 1870; how it was denounced, condemned\r\nand deplored; how it was described as fraught with wreck and ruin to\r\nProtestant interests. One clerical speaker warned Queen Victoria that she\r\nmight have “her Crown kicked into the Boyne” (if she gave her Royal\r\nassent), as James II. had. A friend of my own, a captain in the Army,\r\nassured me he was prepared to wade knee-deep in blood to fight the Bill.\r\n\r\nWe are not unaccustomed to politicians of this type even now! Well, Mr.\r\nGladstone passed his Church Act, which has proved in many respects a great\r\nblessing to the Irish Church. She gained self-action and independence\r\nthereby; her finances have been so skilfully administered and the\r\nliberality of her members has been so great that she has now a realised\r\ncapital of over nine millions! It is estimated that for her numbers she\r\nis, in money, the richest Church in Christendom. None of us who belong to\r\nher would revert, were the offer open to us, to the state of her condition\r\nand circumstances prior to 1869—“Out of the eater came forth meat, and out\r\nof the strong came forth sweetness.” How true that parable of Samson’s has\r\noften proved with regard to changes which were, at first, denounced and\r\ndreaded, and afterwards regarded with gratitude! Generally, the effect\r\nproduced on Irish public opinion by Mr. Gladstone’s Church Act, on the\r\nwhole, was in time beneficial. It removed what was at least a “sentimental\r\ngrievance” from Roman Catholics. It also taught them before very long that\r\nthe Church of Ireland could exist as a voluntary institution; and some\r\nNationalists from time to time have even said that the efficient and\r\ncapable management of the Representative Church Body of the Church funds\r\nwas an object lesson in favour of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nEvery one at all familiar with this subject knows that 1881 was a very\r\nterrible year in Ireland; it is unnecessary to enlarge upon the painful\r\nfact. Then, or thereabouts, I went to see a land-agent whose life had\r\nseveral times been attempted. It was in the summer; he was writing at a\r\ntall, stand-up desk, on the upper ledge of which lay a revolver. I sat\r\ndown by an open window to enjoy the fresh air, from which he immediately\r\npulled me away and deposited me in a corner of the room under shelter of a\r\nwall, not of glass. Presently we adjourned to the dining-room for lunch.\r\nThis was also an arsenal or place of arms; a double-barrelled gun lay on a\r\nsofa. When my friend opened a press to obtain “the materials”—Irishmen\r\nwill know what is meant—I saw therein a brace of horse-pistols. After\r\nlunch we went out for a walk, my friend carrying his gun under his arm,\r\nand, I suppose, his revolver in his pocket. A policeman armed with a\r\nloaded rifle, followed a few yards in our rear. Life under such\r\ncircumstances could not have been very agreeable. Would anyone like to\r\nrevert to it? Surely not. In the same year I was visiting an Irish\r\nlandlord who was very seriously ill; his home was about four miles distant\r\nfrom my glebe house; sometimes I had to go to see him by night. One\r\nmorning the doctor, who had been with the patient for several hours, was\r\nanxiously inquired of by the ladies of the family how their father was.\r\n“Well, all I have to say to you,” said the doctor, “is, that you may be\r\nvery thankful that your father is allowed to die quietly in his bed such\r\ntimes as these.”\r\n\r\nWell, what has improved such terrible times? Has it not been remedial\r\nlegislation in different directions—legislation respecting the Church, the\r\nLand, and Education. Yet in all such cases remedial legislation has been\r\ninitially denounced by a certain party as “Socialism,” “Sacrilege,” or by\r\nsome equally strong expletive. And yet, what has been the result of these\r\nso-called “Socialistic” and “Sacrilegious” measures? Has it not, on the\r\nwhole, and in the main, been good, decidedly and undeniably good? Let us\r\napply our Blessed Lord’s text: “By their fruits ye shall know them.” “Can\r\nany man gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?” So, then, when I\r\nlook back to these past painful experiences, and see how all proposed\r\nremedial legislation was, in the first instance, denounced and vilified,\r\nand when I recall how the results in time have refuted all the prophets of\r\nevil, I am quite inclined to say, is not the balance of evidence in favour\r\nof the view that something very much the same will be the case, and will\r\nhappen with Home Rule? It is now constantly described by one leader as “A\r\nNefarious Conspiracy.” Of course, different Parliamentary orators have\r\ntheir own favourite vocabularies, but is it not very much a case of:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “All now is wrangle, abuse and vociferance.”\r\n\r\n    “One is incisive, corrosive;\r\n      Two retorts nettled, curt, crepitant;\r\n    Three makes rejoinder, expansive, explosive;\r\n      Four overbears them all, strident and strepitant;\r\n    Five.... O Danaides, O Sieve.”\r\n\r\n    “Now they ply axes and crowbars;\r\n      Now they prick pins at a tissue;\r\n    Fine as a skein of the Casuist Escobar\r\n      Worked on the bone of a lie—To what issue?\r\n    Where is our gain at the Two-bars?”\r\n\r\n\r\nJuvenal said of some Roman lawyers of his own day: “Iras et verba locant.”\r\nThey still do it.\r\n\r\nHere perhaps I may with advantage introduce some remarks made by me in\r\nCork City on March 21st at a meeting of the County Technical Instruction\r\nCommittee on the occasion of proposing a vote of congratulation to our\r\nChairman the Bishop of Cloyne, on having gained a verdict in his favour in\r\nhis Libel Action against the _Dundee Courier_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I would like, Sir, to say a few words just in explanation of this\r\n    motion. It is the first opportunity that we have had of doing this\r\n    since the trial, and as other public bodies have passed votes of\r\n    congratulation to the Bishop, it is specially becoming that we\r\n    should do so, as he is Chairman of our Committee. I first made the\r\n    acquaintance of the Bishop in 1893, when I was making a little\r\n    antiquarian tour in the County Kildare with another antiquary, and\r\n    on arriving at Maynooth we ordered some dinner at the hotel there.\r\n    I was anxious to see Maynooth College, we went on there, and we\r\n    happened to see Dr. Browne, who was then President of Maynooth;\r\n    and he with true Irish hospitality at once invited us to stay to\r\n    dine, which we did, and I had a pleasant experience of his\r\n    hospitality and kindness on that occasion. And I must say that my\r\n    own experience of him since he became Bishop of Cloyne has always\r\n    been the same, that by tact and kindness and courtesy he has\r\n    gained our regard and respect. I think I might venture to say in\r\n    connection with the present controversy about the introduction of\r\n    Home Rule into the country—which has, of course, caused a great\r\n    deal of excitement—it would not be natural to expect that such a\r\n    measure would be received in silence, but surely it is possible\r\n    that the people who want to discuss this question should discuss\r\n    it on non-controversial grounds. I think, for example, it should\r\n    be discussed on financial grounds or on constitutional grounds,\r\n    and apart altogether from religious grounds. But I fear there are\r\n    too many controversial politicians, and that this religious\r\n    element in the discussion has not only dominated it, but has\r\n    become predominant, and is greatly to be regretted; and it seems\r\n    to me that this action against the _Dundee Courier_ is an\r\n    illustration of this, and that the Bishop found it necessary to\r\n    vindicate his character against unfounded charges which were\r\n    capable of being made political capital of. It seems to me that\r\n    the argument comes to this, that people raise controversial\r\n    arguments which involve the very serious charge that the lives of\r\n    the Protestants and the property of the Protestants in the country\r\n    would hardly be safe under the new Parliament. Now this is a very\r\n    serious indictment, and I wonder whether the people who make this\r\n    consider its seriousness and the injury it does to both sides. I\r\n    think it does those people who make this charge much harm—it tends\r\n    to make them censorious and uncharitable, and it naturally\r\n    embitters the people against whom this charge is made—that is,\r\n    four-fifths of the population of the whole country. I am afraid\r\n    that there are too many of these controversial politicians at\r\n    work. I have lived all my clerical life in the County Cork for\r\n    over forty years, and my own impression when I hear charges of\r\n    this kind flung broadcast about the people of Ireland is this—that\r\n    the people who make them really can’t know how happily, for\r\n    example, we get on in the province of Munster, how much kindness\r\n    there is, and how much real good feeling—genuine good feeling\r\n    prevails between Protestant and Catholic.”\r\n\r\n    “I can certainly say for myself with perfect truth that during my\r\n    long residence in this county, for a period of over forty years, I\r\n    never received anything but kindness and consideration, and during\r\n    that long period the county has been agitated very seriously. I\r\n    remember the Fenian Rising in 1867, the Church Act in 1869 and\r\n    1870, and I remember other troubles in the county, but, personally\r\n    speaking, I never received anything but kindness and\r\n    consideration. A short time after my ordination I was told by a\r\n    senior clergyman of the diocese how to act towards the people. He\r\n    said: ‘I will give you a recipe—be friendly to the people in this\r\n    county and you will find that they will be friendly to you,’ and I\r\n    certainly found them so without a single exception or\r\n    contradiction.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was from home when this meeting took place, but on his return\r\nhe wrote me a very kind and complimentary letter from which I quote a few\r\nsentences:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Bishop’s House,\r\n\r\n    “Queenstown.\r\n\r\n    “_April 2nd_, 1912.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR CANON COURTENAY MOORE,—Allow me to congratulate you most\r\n    sincerely on the tone and character of your speech, which has done\r\n    much to foster among us all, charity, peace and brotherhood. I\r\n    have heard all manner of men speaking of your action on that\r\n    occasion in the highest terms of praise.”\r\n\r\n    “When there lies round about us so much good to be done by our\r\n    common united forces, why should we spoil the opportunity of doing\r\n    good by senseless and generally ill-founded suspicion and\r\n    quarrels?\r\n\r\n    “Yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n    “ROBERT BROWNE.\r\n\r\n    “_Bishop of Cloyne_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI desire to add an extract here from a letter written to me by the late\r\nRev. Father Horgan, P.P. of Kilworth, Co. Cork. He was a very cultivated\r\nman; he had been for eight years in the Irish College at Rome and had also\r\nmade a voyage round the world. He had “read in the book of the world,” and\r\nin addition to his extensive and accurate knowledge of theology he had\r\nacquired a great knowledge of Art from his residence in Rome. About two\r\nyears before his death he wrote me a very touching letter from which the\r\nfollowing is an extract:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “I have given up all thoughts of change of place. My outlook and\r\n    my hope are homewards, and may the good God support and strengthen\r\n    us both to and through the end which awaits us to our rest.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI fear there may be too much egotism and too little reticence in my\r\nplacing such kindly and even confidential communications as these before\r\nthe public, yet my motive for doing so is simply to show how much real\r\nkindly feeling and friendly intercourse exist between members of the Roman\r\nCatholic and Anglican Churches in Ireland, especially in those districts\r\nwhere the vast numerical predominance of the former Church might, as some\r\nsuppose and suggest, provoke her to intolerance, which in my opinion is\r\nnot the case at all. Of course I do not profess to do more than offer a\r\ngeneral opinion founded on my own personal experience, and on my knowledge\r\nof Irish history in the past. But when I look back upon the past and think\r\nfor example on the state of Ireland during the “Tithe Wars,” as described\r\nby such a writer as Lecky, and on my own recollections of Ireland in the\r\ndays of the Land League, and compare with these periods the present happy\r\nand peaceful condition of the country, and ask myself what has produced\r\nsuch a blessed and beneficial change, is not the answer plain enough that\r\nit has been the progress of healing and remedial legislation? Well, then,\r\nif impending legislation in the direction of Home Rule is a further\r\nconcession to national sentiment and likely to prove a further development\r\nof and outlet for national knowledge of what the country requires, and an\r\napplication of her own energies and resources for the purpose, why should\r\none dread and deprecate the experiment? I have lived through too many\r\nIrish crises to be afraid of another. I do not venture to speak\r\ndogmatically, still less despairingly, but I feel on the whole that this\r\nnew departure will tend to good like its predecessors. I am inclined to\r\nask, why should the Roman Catholic people of Ireland persecute\r\nProtestants, if Home Rule be granted—some will say, oh, because they will\r\nthen have greatly increased power and influence in their own hands, and\r\nthey will therefore be tempted to use it, and will use it in this\r\ndirection. I find it hard to believe this, I am very slow to believe it,\r\njudging from my own experience of Ireland. May I not put it in this way\r\nplausibly and reasonably enough: why should not such an extension of\r\nself-government gratify the Irish National Party, and produce even better\r\nand still more kindly feeling towards their Protestant fellow countrymen\r\nthan already exists? If we must make a calculus of probabilities in such\r\nan event, ought we not to take into account the mollifying influence of\r\nthe possession of increased powers, just as much as the temptation to\r\nmisuse them in the direction of intolerance. Besides, will it not be the\r\npolicy of the leaders of the Home Rule movement, should it become an\r\naccomplished fact, to conciliate—much rather than to coerce—those who\r\noppose the movement? As Mr. Redmond has recently said, “some repudiate\r\nIreland, but Ireland will not repudiate them.” We may for a time in the\r\nnear future have a period of some unrest, anxiety, possibly even danger,\r\nbut we must hope that this will pass. Certain Irish proverbs show\r\nsomething of the tone of the national mind. Here are a few: are they not\r\nvery instructive and descriptive?\r\n\r\n\r\n    “One must cut the gad nearest the throat.”\r\n\r\n    “The first thread is not of the piece.”\r\n\r\n    “A small share of anything is not worth much, but a small share of\r\n    sense _is_ worth much.”\r\n\r\n    “It isn’t day yet.”\r\n\r\n    “Nil lā fòs e.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these proverbs show that Ireland has “learned to labour and to wait:”\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Look not mournfully into the past,\r\n    It comes not back again ...\r\n    Wisely improve the present, it is thine.\r\n    Go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly\r\n                heart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) A Presbyterian View, BY REV. J. B. ARMOUR, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of Home Rule for Ireland has been discussed from all sides\r\nnow for more than a quarter of a century: and at present it holds the\r\nfield. Everything from the constitutional, commercial, and religious\r\naspect of the problem has been said in an italicised form. The history of\r\nthe controversy has shown considerable change of view, at least on the\r\npart of the opponents of the measure, and the bitterness against the idea\r\nhas become in many cases a mere scream, a sign that the foundation of\r\ntheir objections to the proposal is giving way. At the first mention of\r\nHome Rule, the majority of the constitutional lawyers entered the lists,\r\nand satisfied themselves that the measure would violate the constitution,\r\nlead to the dismemberment of the Empire, and the final separation of\r\nIreland from the Crown. The stipendiary politician, of whom we have many,\r\nespecially in the North of Ireland, said: “I thank thee, O Jew, for\r\nteaching me that word,” and rang the changes on the word “separation,”\r\ndubbing every adherent of the Liberal cause as a separatist. The saner\r\nconstitutional lawyers have come to the conclusion that the idea of\r\nseparation has no foundation in fact, and could not, if mooted, have the\r\nslightest hope of success. A community which has not the power of raising\r\nan Army or a Navy could hardly venture on rebellion. Ireland is largely an\r\nagricultural country, and, seeing that the farmers in a few years will be\r\nsitting under their own vine and fig tree, possessors as well as tillers\r\nof the soil, it is almost unthinkable that even five per cent. of the\r\npopulation would think of risking their all in an enterprise which could\r\nnot be successful, and, if successful, would close against them their best\r\nmarkets. The Irish people are sometimes credited with a double dose of\r\noriginal sin and folly, but their sense of humour would save them from\r\nsuch a cut-throat policy. The soldiers they have sent into the British\r\nArmy, taken from the lower strata of social life, have proved as loyal to\r\nthe British Crown as the Scotch Highlanders. The Curragh, and other camps\r\nfor soldiers in Ireland, will not be broken up when Home Rule comes. The\r\nfear of Home Rule leading to separation has receded to the background of\r\nthe controversy, and is now the monopoly of obscure politicians.\r\n\r\nI am asked to say something on the question from a Presbyterian point of\r\nview. It is a little difficult to state the number of those in favour of\r\nthe measure, and of those not actively opposed thereto, especially as\r\nthose who pose as exponents of Presbyterianism have set themselves, with\r\nconsiderable success, to destroy the right of free speech and to ban the\r\nright of private judgment as a pestilential heresy—two of the essential\r\nfactors in living Protestantism. To hamstring these principles is to leave\r\nProtestantism with a name to live, though it is dead. These Anti-Home\r\nRulers have been threatening, and are carrying out their threat, to\r\nboycott any parson who shows signs of scepticism about the infallibility\r\nof their _credo_. Boycotting is a serious offence, if practised in any\r\nform in the South and West of Ireland, but it is the eleventh Commandment\r\nof the Anti-Home Rulers among the Protestants, and is being observed with\r\ngreater strictness than any of the Ten Words. Under the reign of\r\nTERRORISING PREJUDICE it is not easy to indicate the number of those,\r\nespecially in the Presbyterian Church, who refuse to make Anti-Home Rule\r\nan article of a standing or falling Church. But the drastic methods used\r\nto repress free speech, and the right of private judgment on a political\r\nquestion, are indications that the secret disciples of Home Rule are not\r\nonly a large but an increasing number. As one who has believed in Home\r\nRule for many years, as one who, while treated with courtesy and\r\nkindliness by leading Unionists, has been thrice stoned by their noisy\r\nfollowers, I venture to give an _apologia pro mea vita_.\r\n\r\n(_a_) I accept the principle of Home Rule for Ireland because it is the\r\nprinciple of the Presbyterian Church Government applied to secular\r\naffairs; a principle which has worked well in the Colonies where there are\r\nmixed races and religions; a principle which is a fundamental one in the\r\nUnited States of America; a principle which, truly democratic, has proved\r\nitself the salt of social life wherever applied, and, in the case of our\r\nColonies, has been a link binding the Colonies with hooks of steel to the\r\nBritish Crown. Why or how it will lead to red ruin and the breaking up of\r\nlaws in Ireland is not very clear, save to the “dryting prophets” of the\r\ndolorous breed. As a matter of fact, that principle of Protestantism was\r\nsuggested to the Catholics by Protestants. The idea of Home Rule for\r\nIreland was bred in the brain of some Fellows of T.C.D. Isaac Butt was its\r\nCicero, and Parnell brought the idea into practical politics. Home Rule is\r\nthe child of Protestant parents, and its adherents in all the branches of\r\nProtestant Churches are many. All the Unionists of the saner type admit\r\nthe common sense of the principle, and they say that if Ireland were\r\nScotland they would have nothing to say against an Irish Parliament for\r\npurely local purposes. But they insist that a true principle, if\r\nadministered by Irishmen, would lead to a reign of terror and tyranny. The\r\nanswer to that is this. The Conservative Government has already granted\r\nthe half of the principle in the establishment of County Councils, which\r\nLord Salisbury said would be more mischievous than Home Rule pure and\r\nsimple—though in spite of his _ex-cathedra_ opinion he set them up. The\r\nIrish Conservative papers at the time said bitterly that the Councils were\r\nthe half-way house to Home Rule. In existence now for years, they have\r\nworked wonderfully well without a tithe of the evil predicted to follow in\r\ntheir train. People argue on the question as if the Irish representatives\r\nwould never take a statesmanlike view of any matter for the public good,\r\nand as if Protestantism would have no share in the deliberations of an\r\nIrish Parliament with a fourth of the representatives in Dublin\r\nProtestants, and with an upper House nominated with a view to the\r\nprotection of minorities. The belief that democracy in Ireland would\r\nbecome a persecutor of Protestants and a robber of the commercial classes\r\ncan only arise in the minds of those who hate democracy and all its works,\r\nthough the democratic principle wherever tried has been the parent of much\r\nthat is good in social life. It is becoming the conviction of the thinking\r\nportion of the Protestant world that the question MUST be settled by the\r\none party or the other on lines satisfactory to Irishmen generally; and\r\nnotwithstanding the whirling words uttered by the landlords and their\r\nentourage at Balmoral, it is firmly believed that Mr. Bonar Law would like\r\nto have a hand in establishing an Irish Parliament for Irish affairs.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Home Rule would undo to a large extent the evils of the paper Union\r\nof 1800, modifying racial animosities, introducing a new spirit of\r\npatriotism and healing the sores of long standing. The means by which the\r\nUnion of Ireland with England was effected were so destructive of\r\neverything moral in political life that every thinking man denounces them\r\nas infamous, and they are without a defender past or present. It is\r\ntolerably certain that 90 per cent. of the Protestants of Ireland,\r\nincluding a large number of the landlords who refused to be bribed, were\r\nas bitter against the destruction of the Irish Parliament as their\r\ndescendants are against its restoration. Listening to the harangues\r\nagainst an Irish Parliament, one can only conclude that the applauding\r\nauditors regard their ancestors as fools. To have a dance on the graves of\r\none’s ancestors may be a new amusement, but it is hardly respectful to the\r\nmemory of brave men whose opinions of the hurtful effects to Ireland from\r\nthe Union and the loss of a legislature have been fully justified by\r\nevents. Nobody can say that the Union has been a success. For fully\r\nseventy years of the nineteenth century the government of Ireland was a\r\nlegalised tyranny, the whole political power of making and administering\r\nlaws for Ireland was in the hands of the landlords, who were allowed to\r\nrob and spoil at their will the Irish tenants, Protestant and Catholic. A\r\ntenant’s Protestantism did not save him from a rack rent; it often\r\nincreased the rack rents. For generations the tenants of Ireland had to\r\npay between five and ten millions beyond what was just and fair, and those\r\nmillions might as well have been cast into the Irish Channel as far as\r\nbringing any benefit to Ireland was concerned. The Imperial Parliament is\r\nheavily in debt to Ireland for the spoliation of the Irish farmers and\r\nlabourers which it permitted. Irishmen of all creeds, as they look back on\r\na long spell of slavery, have no right to join in singing pæans to the\r\nUnion. If changes were made in the laws bringing a modicum of justice to\r\nIrishmen, giving them a right to call their votes their own, and a right\r\nto part of the property they created, the predecessors of the Unionists of\r\nto-day have no claim to credit for the changes, as they fought with the\r\nsame savageness they are showing towards Home Rule against the\r\nintroduction of the ballot, and took as their motto “tenants’ rights are\r\nlandlords’ wrongs.” The thanks of Irishmen are due to the Liberal Party,\r\nled by Mr. Gladstone, and backed powerfully by the Nationalist Members.\r\nUnionists of every colour are dwelling on the prosperity of Ireland,\r\nquoting statistics about the tremendous increase of sheep and swine. They\r\nforget two things, one of which is that Ireland since the Union has lost\r\n50 per cent. of its inhabitants, but they say “What of that? We have a\r\nlarge increase of sheep and swine, the true index of a nation’s\r\nprosperity.” The Founder of our faith did not agree with the Unionist\r\nconception of the relative value of sheep and men. He said: “How much is a\r\nman better than a sheep,” a saying which covers an Irish Catholic as well\r\nas a Protestant Home Ruler. Men are better than sheep, Unionists\r\nnotwithstanding. Then they forget that Ireland’s prosperity, whatever it\r\nis, began with Mr. Gladstone’s legislation, which the Conservatives held\r\nwould ruin the country and break up the Empire. His legislation was the\r\nintroduction of the democratic principle into politics, and democracy has\r\nproved itself worthy of acceptation. Home Rule is the extension of the\r\ndemocratic idea, and in spite of all that has been said in strident tones\r\nagainst the measure, its acceptance will tend to social health and wealth,\r\nand not one hundredth part of the evil its opponents associate with its\r\npassing can result therefrom. The prophecies about the evils resulting\r\nfrom Liberal legislation have been falsified in every instance. The Ballot\r\nAct would have upset the Throne, according to the Tories, but the Throne\r\nis on a firmer basis now than it has been since the days of the Conqueror.\r\nThe disestablishment of the Irish Church was to ruin religion, but after\r\nmore than forty years religion in the Episcopal Church of Ireland is\r\nhealthier than ever. Home Rule will “heal the breaches of many\r\ngenerations.”\r\n\r\n(_c_) Home Rule in Ireland, so far from ruining Protestantism, will give\r\nProtestantism a chance of being judged on its own merits. _Hitherto\r\nProtestantism has been handicapped by its political associations._ The\r\nsystem so long in vogue of compelling the Irish peasant to pay tithe for\r\nthe support of an established Church where the peasant never worshipped,\r\nevoked the dislike of the majority of our countrymen for Protestantism and\r\nall its works. If that cause of active hatred was removed, the fact that\r\nProtestantism was still the religion of the majority of the landlords who\r\ndemanded more than their pound of flesh from the tenants did not commend\r\nthat form of religion as a gospel of love. Then the fact, so evident\r\nstill, that the bureaucracy which is ruling Ireland is largely Protestant,\r\nthe highest positions of dignity and emolument in connection with the\r\nState machinery being held, not by Protestants of all sects but by those\r\nbelonging to a certain sect, has not been conducive to unprejudiced views\r\nof Protestantism as a religious system. The fear that the management of\r\nthe State machinery will not remain in the hands of the descendants of the\r\nascendency party is perhaps the strongest factor in opposition to Home\r\nRule. As far as the Presbyterian Church is concerned, its members cannot\r\npossibly under Home Rule have a less share in the offices of emolument and\r\ndignity than they have had all down the years from 1800 to 1912.\r\nProtestantism will enter on a new career as a spiritual rather than a\r\npolitical force, and will prove its right to have its share in our\r\ncountry’s welfare. Persecution for conscience sake is a game played out,\r\nas the practice of persecution for religious opinions has hurt the\r\npersecutor more than the persecuted. Persecution cripples industry, and,\r\nas the world has become very practical, fears of persecution are to be\r\nlargely discounted, especially as it would be rather difficult to\r\npersecute the fourth of the inhabitants. _Some_ of those who are\r\nexploiting the persecuting bogey for political ends have not much religion\r\nto persecute. The fears of a militant Catholic Duke who hates Home Rule,\r\nand who is credited with intriguing at Rome against it, ought to modify\r\nthe fears of timid Protestants who urge that Home Rule must necessarily\r\nmean Rome Rule. To their credit, Irish Catholics, alone in the Catholic\r\nworld, have never been known to persecute for religious beliefs. A martyr\r\nfor conscience sake has never been heard of in Erin. On April 11th of this\r\nyear, a letter was addressed to Mr. Redmond, signed by the leading\r\nProtestants of Dublin, in which they assert that Protestants have always\r\nbeen treated with courtesy by their Catholic neighbours in the south and\r\nwest, and in which they repudiate the idea of persecution in the future.\r\nThey send Mr. Redmond a considerable subscription for his fund as a proof\r\nthat their letter is not words, but an expression of well-grounded\r\nconviction. I have no fear for true Protestantism in the future, either in\r\nIreland or elsewhere, though political Protestantism has had its day.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Instead of diminishing, Home Rule will increase, the commerce of\r\nIreland. It is curious that, at all the Conventions called to denounce\r\nHome Rule, the fear of the ruin of commerce has been more prominent than\r\nthe fear of the destruction of the Protestant religion. They have been\r\nreversing the great rule of life “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His\r\nrighteousness and these things shall be added unto you.” So obviously has\r\nthe commercial side been thrust into the front rank of this controversy\r\nthat a cynical friend—worthy to be a brother of the Member for Sark—has\r\nsuggested that the meetings should have been opened by a hymn to commerce:\r\n“O God of Commerce help us, for the man from Waterford intends to cut down\r\nyour groves.” A more fantastic idea or one more devoid of all probability\r\nnever took possession of men. Democracy has always been favourable to\r\ncommerce, and commercial prosperity follows in its train. To imagine that\r\na Parliament in Dublin would heap taxes on the rich is unthinkable, as any\r\ntaxes on Ulster would weigh as heavily on other parts of Ireland. The\r\nIrish people of any creed are not fond of paying taxes, and one might take\r\nit for granted that a change in the administration of Irish affairs will\r\nnot necessitate increased taxation. The administration of the Government\r\nmachinery in Ireland is the costliest in any country, and is bound to\r\ndecrease largely as the country settles. The cost of bills promoted by\r\nIrish Corporations for needed corporate improvements is enormous, and it\r\nfrightens social reformers from attempting to get things which stand in\r\nthe way of public good set right. No statement was ever further from the\r\ntruth than that which is made so often, that the Imperial Parliament is\r\nready to amend every real Irish grievance. There are hundreds of necessary\r\nreforms which would contribute to the prosperity of the country. These\r\ncannot be attempted because of the cost and the difficulty of getting them\r\ndiscussed in the Imperial Parliament. If settled in Dublin, they could be\r\nbetter done at one fifth of the expense. The Commerce of Ireland stands to\r\ngain by Home Rule. An increase of commerce always leads to a spirit of\r\ntolerance.\r\n\r\nTo those of my fellow religionists who are frightened by the very\r\nterm—Home Rule, I would say “Who is he that will harm you if ye are\r\nfollowers of that which is good?”\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) A Nonconformist View. BY REV. W. CRAWFORD, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be a matter of constant surprise, to those who have been\r\naccustomed to distinguish political from religious questions, to find\r\nreligion for ever obtruded into discussions of the Irish problem. Can’t\r\nmen follow their religious convictions under any form of government? they\r\nwill impatiently cry; why then complicate an already difficult subject by\r\nimporting considerations on which some men appear always to be least\r\nreasonable? But it may as well be recognised at once that “religion” is\r\ngenerally at the base of the opposition to Home Rule, and that the British\r\ngovernment of Ireland, as it is responsible for that peculiar feature of\r\nthe case, must in all equity find a solution of the problem and a remedy\r\nfor those evils which have embittered Irish life for centuries, and which\r\nto-day stand as the one great obstacle to England’s last act of reparation\r\nfor the wrongs of the past. An alien Church has been disestablished; a\r\ntyrannical land system is at enormous cost being revolutionised; and now\r\nthe traditional animosity of Protestant to Roman Catholic, manifested in\r\nthe general opposition of the Churches of the Reformation in Ireland to\r\nthe demand for Home Rule, and enforced by every argument which the history\r\nof centuries can afford, must be dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe errors of a dark past cannot be undone; but each successive measure of\r\nconciliation has brought increased contentment and prosperity to the\r\ncountry; and, sure as there is a God in heaven, the repeal of the last and\r\ngreatest wrong, an Act of Union which no honest historian can defend, will\r\nbe the harbinger of lasting peace. To deal at once with the Protestant\r\nattitude to Home Rule, the Churches in an overwhelming majority stand\r\nsolid against it. The opposition is confined to no class, being, if\r\nanything, more bitter and unreasoning in the lower grades of society. It\r\nis impossible to give any accurate estimate of the number of Protestant\r\nHome Rulers, and the much advertised totals of 95 to 98 per cent. of\r\nUnionists are mere fictions, as there never has been a poll taken on the\r\nquestion; and for easily understood reasons those in favour of suspected\r\nor unfashionable causes are slow to declare their opinions or convictions.\r\nLiberalism is essentially “vulgar” in Ireland; and Nationalism is taboo in\r\nall polite society. That exclusive clique, among whom heredity, tradition,\r\nand “Church principles” reign supreme, has had a long ascendency in\r\nIreland. In affluence amid poverty, with every advantage of education and\r\ninfluence over the unprivileged many, their pride has been to stand aloof\r\nfrom popular causes, and to decry every agitation for redress. Isolated\r\nLiberals, too few and scattered to form a community, have had to lie low,\r\nor risk their social position and business prospects. Of late years there\r\nhas been some access of courage, and an increasing number in all\r\nprofessions and trades, except those directly dependent for support on the\r\nupper classes, have greatly ventured in taking a stand on the people’s\r\nside. Among the younger generations, the choicest spirits, true followers\r\nof Davis Emmett and Fitzgerald, have always been found on the popular\r\nside; but, on the whole, heredity prevails, tradition rules, and\r\nconvention, under the guise of religion and Empire, drills the Protestant\r\nmass on the side of Unionism.\r\n\r\nUlster is the crux of the Home Rule problem; and Protestantism is the\r\n_raison d’étre_ of its opposition; as we are being ever reminded by Church\r\nassemblies, Orange lodges, and political orators whose interest in the\r\nwelfare of so Puritan a faith is admirable indeed, and full of promise for\r\ntheir future. The “religion” may sometimes appear to be of a peculiar\r\npolitical cast, and difficult to reconcile with ordinary Christianity; but\r\nsuch as it is, in it a serious fact has to be reckoned with. Its genesis,\r\nas well as the present condition of Ireland, can be understood only in the\r\nlight of the history of the last four centuries. The attitude of\r\nProtestantism generally does not need a separate discussion, being marked\r\nby the same characteristics (as it originated, for the most part, in the\r\nsame events) as that of the North of Ireland. It is in the confiscations\r\nand plantations of the seventeenth century that the origin of political\r\nProtestantism is to be found. That nefarious plan of conquest and\r\ngovernment was old as the Normans; but it is to the later phases of it\r\nadopted by the English rulers from James I. to Cromwell that the\r\nestablishment of the Protestant races and families now in possession of\r\nthe land may be traced. Recollect that the planters were English and\r\nScotch Protestants put in possession of the lands and homes of Irish Roman\r\nCatholics, who were relegated to Connaught, and farther, or held in\r\ncomplete subjection by the conquering race. Their religion was proscribed,\r\nand all civil rights were denied them. No doubt the object was rather to\r\nextinguish a nation, than a creed; but the fact remains that in his\r\npaternal solicitude, “the interests of His Majesty’s _Protestant_ subjects\r\nwere his greatest care, and must first be provided for” (17 & 18 Charles\r\nII.); and the “mere Irish” were sacrificed for the purpose. The\r\n“settlements” of Ireland resulted in the fact that to a very large extent\r\nthe history of Ireland until to-day is involved in the land question, and\r\nin the doings of contending religious factions.\r\n\r\nThus favoured by the State, and supported in their armed possession of\r\nproperty and ascendency, the Irish Protestants developed at once the\r\nmasterful qualities so natural to the British in relation to subject\r\nraces, loyalty to their benefactors whose garrison they were, stern\r\nadherence to the religion which was the badge of their predominance, and a\r\nfirm determination, at all cost to others, to maintain a state of affairs\r\nso favourable to their welfare here and hereafter.\r\n\r\nTo hark back thus to a distant past, seeking the origin of the events of\r\nthe present, may appear unnecessarily provocative of bad feeling. It is\r\npleasanter to dwell on the social amenities and Christian charities which\r\nhave often marked the relations of Roman Catholic and Protestant\r\nneighbours, and do so more than ever to-day; but in view of the present\r\nstruggle they are merely misleading accidents, and the intolerant spirit\r\nthat displays itself in threats of armed resistance, or in the “Ulster” of\r\nRudyard Kipling with its:\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The faith in which we stand,\r\n      The Laws we made and guard,\r\n    Our honour, lives and land,\r\n      Are given for reward.\r\n    To Murder done by night,\r\n      To Treason taught by day,\r\n    To folly, sloth and spite,\r\n      And we are thrust away.”\r\n\r\n\r\nis more truly characteristic of the historical fairness and temper of that\r\npast in which we seek the origin of the problem now confronting the\r\nBritish people. The history of the past dominates minds on both sides of\r\nthe conflict. Peasants have very long memories, and traditions wrought\r\ninto every fibre of their being control their outlook on current events in\r\na way quite inexplicable to those who enjoy a wider range of vision and\r\nare occupied with modern interests. The horrors of Scullabogue and the\r\nheroism of Saintfield are still recounted with vivid detail in the cabins\r\nof Wexford and Down; and the relative condition of the two nations in\r\nIreland must be radically altered before the bitter memories of the past\r\nand the passions they evoke in the name of religion, will cease to\r\nfrustrate all movements toward peace and progress. The mention of “two\r\nnations” will be eagerly seized by opponents as a fatal objection to the\r\nestablishment of a native government. And so it would be, if the\r\ndifferences were ineradicable in their nature, or agreement on the\r\nprinciples of government impossible between men of different faith in\r\nIreland; but the past has abundantly proved that neither supposition is\r\ntrue. In every century as men have been uninfluenced by the machinations\r\nof party leaders, or freed from clerical control, they have agreed to\r\nstruggle for the good of their common country. Presbyterians have led “the\r\nrebels” in many a bloody fight, the liberties of Ireland were never more\r\ngloriously vindicated than in the Protestant Parliament of Grattan, and\r\nthe latest struggle for legislative independence has found its earliest\r\nand most trusted leaders among the Protestant gentry. “More Irish than the\r\nIrish themselves,” there have always been found some, yielding to the\r\nglamour of Irish climate, character and life, who have forgotten the\r\nanimosities of religion to combine in prayer and sacrifice for the good of\r\ntheir adopted country. Further, the principles on which the Home Rule\r\ndemand is based are those professed by men of every creed in the free\r\ncountries of the world, and in Ireland, too, when men are not blinded by\r\nprejudice or traditional fears. The two nations will be welded into one;\r\nand “Ireland a nation” will become something more than a patriotic toast,\r\nwhen, for the first time in history, the representatives of all creeds\r\nform its Parliament, for Ireland can as ill afford to lose the dour\r\nvirtues of the Ulster-Scot as of the most dreamy Munster Celt.\r\n\r\nThe refusal to recognise Irishmen’s right to Nationality, when English,\r\nWelsh and Scots are “nations” is a curious relic of the old attitude\r\ntowards(165) “England’s oldest foe.” They inhabit, at all events, one\r\nland, and it is an island. A people variously constituted, they breathe\r\nits air, cultivate its soil, speak the same language with even a brogue of\r\ntheir own, enjoy the usual intercourse of ordinary human beings in social,\r\ncommercial, educational and political pursuits, with common interests,\r\nproblems, difficulties, and aspirations (_pace_ Ulster). They have a\r\nhistory more ancient than that of Saxon England, and a continuous\r\nChristianity as devoutly held for seventeen centuries as in any country of\r\nEurope; they have marked characteristics, admirable or otherwise,\r\naccording to taste and temper, but which the world of art, literature and\r\nreligion seems to value. But because their ideals do not commend\r\nthemselves to some thrifty settlers on their lands they are to be denied\r\nthe status and privileges of a nation.\r\n\r\nIn any attempt to reach the truth as to the justice and expediency of\r\ngranting Home Rule to Ireland, it is absolutely futile to waste time in\r\nanswering the stock arguments of party platforms, special pleading to\r\nsupport a foregone conclusion, half-truths backed up by most remarkable\r\nincidents, “fresh in the memory” of the speaker, or invented by his heated\r\nimagination. To contradict falsehoods, debate plausible conclusions, or\r\nquote instances to the contrary is equally vain, for the distinction\r\nbetween _propter_ and _post hoc_ is often as inscrutable to the ordinary\r\nmind in politics as it is in medicine. We must fall back on recognized\r\nprinciples; and leave it to our opponents, on whom the burden lies, to\r\nshow reason why these should not be applied to Ireland as to other parts\r\nof the British Empire, or why Irishmen, because mostly Catholics, are to\r\nbe refused the natural rights of freemen.\r\n\r\n“What in the world do you want?” is the cry indignantly repeated in\r\nBelfast conventions, as if it had not been answered a thousand times.\r\nWell, once more; it is self-government, so far as that is compatible with\r\nthe interests of the Empire, to which Ireland belongs and must still\r\nbelong unless a mighty convulsion of nature puts it elsewhere. It is the\r\nright of every civilized and progressive people, the grant of which to its\r\ndependencies is the glory of the British Empire, and in preparation for\r\nwhich it governs its subject races in India or Africa. Is Ireland less fit\r\nafter nine centuries of English government to rule itself on\r\nconstitutional lines than Canada or the South African Union? Possibly it\r\nis; for the centuries have been a weary apprenticeship in misgovernment\r\nrather than in constitutional methods; but all the more surely does the\r\nlong experiment stand condemned, and it may well give place to saner\r\nmethods. As in personal, so in national life, the sole condition of mature\r\ndevelopment is responsibility. The father or ruler who jealously denies it\r\nto one come to years of discretion is a bungler or a tyrant, ignorant of\r\nthe first principles of education. For all these centuries the Irish race\r\nhas been in leading strings; and those most guilty of multiplying and\r\ntightening the bonds are naturally the enemies of its independence and of\r\nthe only method ever discovered by God or man to secure the growth of\r\nvirtue, the acquisition of strength, or the fulfilment of personal and\r\nnational promise. Experience is the best, the only, teacher of practical\r\npolitics; and the mistakes and losses in life incurred by folly or\r\nignorance are our best discipline. To charge a people with incapacity who\r\nhave never been trusted with power is the resort of stupid malice.\r\nIrishmen have vindicated before the world their fitness to fight its\r\nbattles, or command its armies; as captains of industry they have led in\r\nevery land, and the British Empire above all is indebted to the statesmen,\r\nproconsuls, travellers, scholars and divines that have issued from the\r\nrace. What a people to be denied the elementary rights of self-government!\r\nIf Unionists are sincere in deploring the absence of a true spirit of\r\ncitizenship in the Irish, what have they ever done to encourage it?\r\nSympathy with men’s difficulties, appreciation of their virtues,\r\nco-operation in their efforts, Christian charity and trust—these, and not\r\nsuspicion, distrust, misrepresentation and opposition, should have been\r\nthe Protestant contribution to the growth and happiness of a people, whom\r\nin private life they themselves always admit to be generous friends and\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nSelf-government must be based on representation, and the right of\r\nmajorities. Recognized universally in the Empire, this simple dictate of\r\njustice is to be denied to Irishmen in their own land, because the great\r\nmajority is Roman Catholic. “It is not constitutional” said Gladstone in\r\n1886, “to refuse the demand of five-sixths of the duly elected\r\nrepresentatives of a country”; and ever since then the representation has\r\nnever changed nor has the demand abated. That it is resisted in the name\r\nof Religion, not Politics, we are not allowed for one moment to forget;\r\nand no one in Protestant circles is unfamiliar with the assertion, how\r\nardently Home Rule would be welcomed if it were not for the Priest in\r\npolitics and the dread of “Rome Rule.” But let it be recognized that under\r\nfree institutions it is the right of the majority to rule, irrespective of\r\ntheir religious creed; and that to deny that right in Ireland is to\r\nestablish a tyranny of the minority—an oligarchy in these days of\r\nDemocracy! Nothing can exceed the sincerity of men, good but blinded by\r\nprejudice, when on Belfast platforms they declare their desire for\r\nequality and hatred of ascendency. But what a ludicrous fallacy they fall\r\ninto when with the same breath they assert their resolve never to submit\r\nto the Government of the great majority of their fellow countrymen. In\r\nother words they, a small minority, contend for a union with the\r\nParliament of another country for this express purpose, that by the aid of\r\nits votes they may override the unanimous wish of three-fourths of the\r\npeople of their own land. This is the very gist of the Anti-Home Rule\r\ndemonstration in Belfast on April 9th. It was not Irish in any true sense.\r\nThe platforms crowded with sixty members of Parliament representing\r\nBritish Constituencies, presided over by noblemen such as a Grand Master\r\nof Orangemen and a great coal owner who has practically ceased to be an\r\nIrish landowner, addressed by eminent counsel who have transferred their\r\nservices to the English bar for reasons best known to themselves,\r\nex-ministers and aspirants to office in a Unionist administration—it was a\r\nbrave show of party political force; but nothing can hide or minimize the\r\nfact that it is all avowedly an effort to support and intensify the claim\r\nof about half the population of Ulster, and one-fourth of the population\r\nof Ireland, to resist and overthrow the rights of Irishmen to the\r\nprivileges of representative government. If the Unionists of Ireland\r\nsincerely desire equality and disavow ascendency in their own country, let\r\nthem prove it by being willing to accept the conditions of life and\r\nlegislation naturally imposed by the will of a majority, in the discussion\r\nof which they will possess and exercise a fair, or according to their\r\nability, a preponderating degree of influence. But let them cease to\r\ndemand in their country the predominance of social, political and\r\nreligious ideals, natural perhaps to England and Scotland now, but alien\r\nto Ireland, and secured only by foreign, that is non-Irish, votes.\r\n\r\nThe representation of minorities on a complete system of proportional\r\nvoting is an absolute necessity in Ireland. Considering the number of the\r\npopulation, there is very marked and wide-spread variety of opinion. The\r\nOrangemen of the cities are often democratic Radicals, however much evil\r\nassociations may at times corrupt their good manners; Catholic Irishmen,\r\neven the clergy (notwithstanding the _semper eadem_ cry), are sharply\r\ndivided by lines of severance that will appear when the present unnatural\r\ncombinations pass out of sight, Unionist and Nationalist becoming\r\nmeaningless; Nonconformists here, as elsewhere, differ from Episcopalians\r\non important subjects; Molly Maguires, Sinn Feiners, Gaelic Leaguers have\r\nsomething to say as regards Irish life worth hearing; and all must find a\r\nvoice in any true representation of the country’s thought and purpose. The\r\nUnited Kingdom, too, probably needs such a reform in representation, and\r\ncannot do better than witness the trial of the experiment on the political\r\nbody of the sister island.\r\n\r\nIt is on such fundamental principles of government the argument for Home\r\nRule stands, and Liberalism at all events would be untrue to its very\r\ngenius in hesitating to confer the boon. Irish Home Rule has been the\r\ntouchstone of Liberalism, and it is not by any accident that Unionists,\r\nwho abandoned their old creed to refuse Ireland’s plea, became arrant\r\nTories, and have ceased to exist as a political party.\r\n\r\nThe objections made by Protestants are formidable and specious. They\r\nappeal to passion rather than to reason; they exploit religion in\r\nopposition to Christianity; they ignore history and flourish on\r\njournalism; they forget humanity’s claims in their zeal for sectional\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nThe stock argument in Belfast appears to be that in the interests of\r\n“Empire” Home Rule is impossible. Yet Ireland was under the British Crown\r\nwhen 42,000 volunteers were enrolled under Lord Charlemont and the Duke of\r\nLeinster to protect her shores from foreign foes; the stigma of the word\r\n“Separatist” has been repudiated by every responsible Irish statesman; and\r\nso long as Britain’s naval and military power lasts, the secession of 4\r\nmillions of people within one hour’s sail is an absolute impossibility,\r\nshould any one desire “the dismemberment of the Empire.” Let candid\r\nEnglishmen consider a simple question; which is the more likely and the\r\nmore intimidating, menace to the Empire: a discontented, disloyal and\r\nimpoverished Ireland, or one proud in its self-dependence, grateful to its\r\nbenefactor, and united by every consideration of mutual protection and\r\nbenefit? Or which will be of most credit to Britain in the estimation of\r\nher Colonies and of the civilized world?\r\n\r\nTimid Ulstermen deplore “the loss of their birthright in the Empire”;\r\ntheir civil and religious liberties, they say, are imperilled, their\r\ncommercial prosperity is sure to suffer. It is hard even to imagine the\r\nconception they have formed of their countrymen. Is it as fools or rogues,\r\nslaves or tyrants, they wish to caricature the inhabitants of the land, in\r\nwhich they so reluctantly dwell, for the delectation of ignorant\r\nforeigners? For none other can be imposed on by such diatribes. Are\r\nIrishmen engaged in a struggle for 150 years to gain independence and the\r\nrights of men, to signalize their victory by denying civil and religious\r\nliberty to their fellows; or are a people whose own industries have been\r\nruined in the past by legal restraints on trade, whose enterprise and\r\nefforts to establish new industries and foster old ones are being rewarded\r\nwith a few gleams of prosperity, dull or wicked enough to wish to injure\r\ncommercial or manufacturing triumphs in the north of which they are proud?\r\nAsk the commercial travellers from Ulster, who enter every town in\r\nIreland, whether their wares are scouted and themselves insulted because\r\nof Orange bluff or threats. No! Irishmen are neither fools nor bigots.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary method of producing prejudice on these topics is to recount\r\nthe crimes and outrages that have darkened the past of Irish agrarian\r\nlife. No one can deny their existence, or palliate their enormity. They\r\nwere the inevitable incidents of war; one of the most bitter ever waged\r\nover such a period of years. It was a war of rebellion against\r\nmisgovernment, of revenge for political crimes, a frantic struggle for\r\nlife and home on the part of a peasantry down-trodden, ejected, starved;\r\nit was the last and successful phase of a great agrarian movement to\r\nsecure the rights of free born men in the land they tilled. Many crimes\r\nhave been committed, but who can distribute the blame? and any fair\r\nhistorian will recollect the exasperation under which they were committed,\r\nthe failure of every attempt at redress, the findings of Royal Commissions\r\ndisregarded and the promises of politicians forgotten, the evictions and\r\nlegalized tyranny of rack-renting landlords, and the steady decrease of\r\nthis violence as constitutional agitation has gained a hearing and a more\r\nhumane spirit has inspired Parliamentary action. But such crimes as were\r\ncommitted were never acts of religious persecution or violations of the\r\ncivil liberties of Protestants as such. Roman Catholics who opposed the\r\nnational movement, or sided with the party accountable for the wrong,\r\nsuffered also; and it is absolutely unjust and unhistorical to quote the\r\nviolence of an angry and a maddened people as prophetic, or even\r\nsuggestive, of similar wrongs likely to be perpetrated under an Irish\r\nGovernment. If the Irish Roman Catholics desired to persecute Protestants,\r\nthere has been plenty of opportunity to do so; and, in three-fourths of\r\nthe country, life could have been made intolerable and impossible to\r\nfarmers and merchants dependent on the goodwill of their neighbours. Yet a\r\nuniversal testimony to the contrary is borne by Protestants of every class\r\nand party in the middle and southern counties where Romanism is\r\npredominant. The charges of intolerance freely levelled at the Protestant\r\nof the north in connection with certain notorious incidents of the\r\npolitical campaign have been repelled and, it was supposed, answered by\r\nreference to the boycotting outrages of the land struggle; but what\r\nunprejudiced critic would ever admit that such incidents could be\r\nparalleled with, or afford any justification for, the petty tyranny to\r\nwhich men have been subjected in Ulster, because they dared to differ in\r\nopinion from the majority and to utter the expression of their deliberate\r\nconvictions?\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious arguments relied on now against Home Rule, is the\r\nprosperity of Ireland under the Union. It used to be Ireland’s miserable\r\npoverty and thriftlessness that were assigned as proof of its unfitness\r\nfor self-government; now the blessed effects of the self same Union have\r\nproduced such prosperity that self-government is not needed or even\r\nwanted!\r\n\r\nA daring orator in Belfast proclaimed “the independent Parliament of\r\nIreland a dismal failure, and the Imperial Parliament a distinct success.”\r\nThe improved condition of Ireland is a matter of deep gratification,\r\nspecially as a foretaste of a better future. But to boast of the\r\nprosperity of a country with its population reduced by one-half in fifty\r\nyears, with its poor little agricultural holdings of a £10 valuation\r\nextending to one-half of the total, its sodden fields and ill-drained\r\nlands, its treeless hills and undeveloped mineral resources, its famished\r\npeasants and shoeless children carrying sods of peat to the village\r\nschool, is a heartless jibe emanating from the wealthy capital of the\r\nNorth. The “distinct success” of a century of so-called Union government\r\nis an equally audacious flight of fancy. Most people would wish to find a\r\ncontented people, living under the ordinary laws of constitutional\r\ngovernment, advancing industries, growing population, and plentiful food\r\nas the tokens of a distinct success under a government of ever-increasing\r\nwealth and power: but seven famines desolated the land during the century;\r\n“for thirty-five years after the Union, Ireland was ruled for three years\r\nout of every four by laws giving extraordinary powers to the Government;\r\nand in the next fifty years (1835-1885) there were only three without\r\nCoercion and Crime Acts.”(166) That for the boasted success of Unionism in\r\nIreland! The present prosperity is due to the National movement, in\r\nresponse to which Gladstone secured the tenant right for the farmer, and\r\ndisestablished the Church, commencing that long series of beneficent but\r\nbelated reforms which have inspired the Irish people with hope, and of\r\nwhich the last and crowning gift of independent self-government awaits\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\nTo return to the more distinctly religious aspects of the question, though\r\nall that means liberty and progress ought to appeal to every Protestant’s\r\nwarmest sentiments, let us examine briefly the alleged dangers arising\r\nfrom the power of the Roman Catholic priesthood and their influence on a\r\nnational government. It is ungenerous to forget all but the seamy side of\r\nthe Priest’s influence in Ireland. In many a dark day he was the poor\r\nman’s only champion, and he has won a place of love in the people’s heart\r\nnot lightly granted or easily lost. But no one familiar with Irish life\r\nfails to notice a change in the relations of priest and people whether it\r\nbe a portent of good or evil. The spread and consolidation of democratic\r\nfeeling, the many ties between the cabin in Ireland and the children’s\r\nhome in America, the spread of education and the influence of the Press,\r\nare exercising in Ireland, as similar causes do elsewhere, a deep\r\ninfluence on the simple piety, or as some call it, the superstition of the\r\npeople. The cry “no priest in politics” prevails as never before; and that\r\ntheir sphere of influence in limited to questions of faith and morals is\r\nbeing widely recognized by the clergy themselves. Influences at work in\r\nEuropean Catholic countries must more and more reach Ireland, and possibly\r\nits danger is not from clericalism but from a slackening hold of the only\r\nform of Christianity that has ever won the heart of the people. At all\r\nevents Roman Catholicism in Ireland has never been an aggressive force\r\nforcing its faith on other communions, but seems content to be let alone\r\nand to minister to its own adherents unmolested, as it has not been in the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nWhen Protestant interests such as education, temperance, Sunday\r\nobservance, marriage laws, and morals generally, are said to be in\r\nimminent danger, what is it that is meant exactly? On such subjects there\r\nare interests that are essential, and others that are matters of opinion:\r\nvery important to those who think them right, but of no weight to others.\r\nAs to legislation on these questions, if Protestants imagine they have any\r\nclaim or chance to impose their views in a National Parliament as they\r\nhave been accustomed to do, or try to do, by aid of English votes at\r\nWestminster, the sooner they are disillusioned the better. But if they are\r\nsatisfied to secure essential interests, such as thoroughness in\r\neducation, increased sobriety by temperance reform, sanctity for marriage,\r\nand liberty for Sunday observance according to the conviction of each,\r\nwhat ground have they to fear that the influence of the Roman Catholic\r\nclergy will be cast on the side opposed to their aims? There is a very\r\nwonderful ignorance in the mind of the ordinary Protestant as to the\r\nattitude of the Catholic clergy on moral and social questions. In\r\ntemperance, for instance, no Church in Ireland can rival in extent or\r\nefficiency the work of the Capuchin Fathers, the Redemptorists, or the\r\nPioneers, an organization formed by a Jesuit priest, and rivalling in\r\nthoroughness and success the “Catch-my-Pal” crusade of the Presbyterian\r\nChurch. In education, too, of every grade the Roman Catholic Church\r\nadvances with extraordinary zeal. True, there are Protestants who complain\r\nof the Roman Catholic opposition to “mixed education”—a palpably unfair\r\ncomplaint, whose underlying motive is a sectarian hope to weaken the hold\r\nof religion on the people. There has been nothing like unanimity among the\r\nProtestant Churches on the same subject. Each of them has tried its best\r\nto secure in the educational sphere its own denominational interests. It\r\nwas the cry “Hands off Trinity” that killed Mr. Bryce’s University Bill,\r\nwhich would have united the youth of Ireland in one grand university, in\r\nwhich Trinity might have been the proud leader of Irish University\r\neducation. That legislation on education should be demanded on the lines\r\nof a mixed system is quite unreasonable, being a matter of very divided\r\nopinion; but as to the keen and successful competition of the Roman\r\nCatholic schools and colleges with all the older institutions in the\r\ncountry there is no question among those who know.\r\n\r\nAs to the moral interests of the community, it is a rather daring\r\nassumption that they will be imperilled under a distinctly Nationalist\r\ngovernment. The reputation of the Irish race for pre-eminence in the\r\ndomestic virtues is a well established fact, and no incidents of later\r\nyears can cast even a passing shadow on the fair fame of her sons and\r\ndaughters. The standard of religious observance on such a matter as Sunday\r\nmay be different from that of the Protestant Churches. In practice the\r\nlatter have not much to boast; and experience gives no reason whatever to\r\nfear any interference with the freest pursuit of their religious\r\nconvictions. The decree _Ne temere_ and cases of the undoubted miscarriage\r\nof justice arising from it have created much discussion and distrust as to\r\nthe validity, under an Irish Parliament, of the marriage bond. The\r\nsanctity of that bond in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church, to whom it\r\nis a Sacrament, cannot be doubted; and if the object of the decree is, as\r\nit appears to be, to prevent mixed marriages, it ought to win the approval\r\nof many Protestants who strongly condemn such alliances; but it is for the\r\ncivil law and the Executive of any government to provide that marriages\r\nlegally celebrated shall be upheld by all the power of the State. And\r\nIreland, according to Mr. Asquith’s Home Rule Bill, has no reason to dread\r\nany failure in that duty. As to the decree commonly known as _Motu\r\nproprio_, it never has been promulgated, or acted on, in Ireland or\r\nelsewhere in the British dominions. It was unearthed, after centuries of\r\nexistence, by a party newspaper, and exploited for all it was worth, and a\r\ngreat deal more, to embitter anti-Catholic prejudices, and score a point\r\nin the Irish discussion.\r\n\r\nAs to Guarantees, opinion is much divided among Protestants. They are at\r\nbest a temporary device to allay fear; and can never be a substitute for\r\nthe real and honourable safeguards to be found in freedom and publicity of\r\ndiscussion, the spread of enlightenment and toleration, the growing spirit\r\nof Christian brotherhood and goodwill. The provisions in the Government\r\nBill appear to be ample; but all paper guarantees are easily evaded, and\r\nit is on more permanent and spiritual assurances Protestants must rely.\r\n\r\nSeldom has Protestantism had a finer chance than she will have in Ireland\r\nunder self-government, if only, inspired with the spirit of her Master and\r\nthe love of her native liberty, she seeks not to grasp power, but to\r\nrender service, if her idea of character be not the “old man” with his\r\nhaunting memories of wrong done and suffered, but the “new man” of the\r\nGospel, inspired by a fresh enthusiasm for the realisation of the Divine\r\npurpose in regenerated human society. No Protestant Church will perhaps\r\never be the Church of Ireland, as one powerful communion with a touch of\r\nthe old arrogance claims to be; yet Protestantism may add something to the\r\nnational piety and progress, nay, she may be another bulwark to the\r\nChristian faith in days of strain and stress, if she can exhibit to a\r\nnaturally religious people a tangible proof of the possibility of uniting\r\nthe Apostolic creed with the intellectual demands of modern progress, and\r\nin this way help to save the youth of Ireland from a desolating\r\nmaterialism. Thus Protestantism may yet be enabled to make some pious\r\nreparation for many an unholy deed done in her name to the most generous\r\npeople under the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 Professor Dicey in “A Leap in the Dark” (1911), p. 118. _Cf._ Mr.\r\n      Balfour in _The Times_, May 3rd, 1912.\r\n\r\n    2 “The Law of Constitution,” Sixth Edition, p. 162, where Professor\r\n      Dicey makes a rather unhappy attempt to force the Dominion\r\n      Constitution into the category of Federalism.\r\n\r\n    3 The opinion of Laband (“Staatsrecht,” I., _passim_) as to its being\r\n      found in the totality of allied Governments represented by the\r\n      Bundesrath is probably nearest the truth.\r\n\r\n    4 Laband, “Die Entwickelung des Bundesraths,” Jahrbuch des\r\n      oeffentlichen Rechts, 1907, Vol. I., p. 18.\r\n\r\n    5 Maitland, _Domesday Book and Beyond_, p. 345.\r\n\r\n    6 It is difficult to understand what Professor Dicey means by saying\r\n      “unity is increasing throughout the Empire.” His argument seems like\r\n      a play upon the words unity and union. In merchant shipping,\r\n      copyright and other such matters, the whole tendency is towards\r\n      differentiation.\r\n\r\n    7 There are innumerable cases, _e.g._ _Cruikshank’s case_ and the\r\n      _Slaughter House case_.\r\n\r\n_    8 Cf._ Mr. Balfour, _The Times_, May 3rd.\r\n\r\n_    9 Cf._ “Pacificus” in _The Times_, April 30th.\r\n\r\n   10 I refer, of course, to the decisions of the Supreme Court—decisions\r\n      almost revolutionary in their character—in connection with the\r\n      annexation of Hawaii, the Philippines and Porto Rico. See in\r\n      particular _Downes_ v. _Bidwell_, 182 U.S., 244; also _Territory of\r\n      Hawaii_ v. _Makichi_, 23 S.C. Rep., 787, and _Dorr_ v. _United\r\n      States_, 195 U.S., 138.\r\n\r\n   11 It cannot be contended with any show of reason that the grant of a\r\n      constitution legally carries with it a grant of the Executive power\r\n      such as to divest the Imperial Government of its authority. There is\r\n      but a solitary opinion to the opposite effect—that of Higginbottom,\r\n      C. J. of Victoria, in _Musgrove_ v. _Toy_ (Victorian Law Reports,\r\n      XIV., 349).\r\n\r\n   12 The veto of the central Government on the local legislature is the\r\n      most decisive departure from the Federal principle. The Judicial\r\n      Committee have always regarded it, in the case of the British North\r\n      America Act, as a conclusive reason for rejecting the application of\r\n      the Federal doctrines of the U.S. Courts to the interpretation of\r\n      the Canadian Constitution. See _infra_, and _cf. Bank of Toronto_ v.\r\n      _Lambe_, 12 App. Cas., 575.\r\n\r\n   13 Difficulties arise when, as in the case of the Australian\r\n      Commonwealth, an attempt is made to reconcile the principles of the\r\n      American Constitution with those of the English Constitution. The\r\n      State Governments in Australia, equally with the Federal Government,\r\n      are carried on in the name of the Crown; what, then, becomes of the\r\n      prerogative doctrine that the Crown is not bound by a taxing\r\n      statute, when the Federal Executive attempts to levy Customs duties\r\n      under a Federal statute upon the property of a State Government? The\r\n      High Court found itself compelled to distinguish between several\r\n      capacities of the Crown in a Federal system. See _A-G. of New South\r\n      Wales_ v. _Collector of Customs_, 5 C.L.R., 818.\r\n\r\n_   14 In re Neagle_, 135 U.S. Rep., p. 1.\r\n\r\n_   15 Cf._ Sir William Anson, in the _Law Quarterly Review_, 1886.\r\n\r\n   16 There is, however, a provision in Clause XXVI. of the Bill Providing\r\n      that, in the event of a revision of the financial arrangements being\r\n      recommended by the Joint Exchequer Board, with a view to securing an\r\n      Imperial contribution from Irish revenues, and “extending the powers\r\n      of the Irish Parliament and the Irish Government with respect to the\r\n      imposition and collection of taxes,” there shall be summoned to the\r\n      Imperial Parliament such number of members of the _Irish_ House of\r\n      Commons as will raise the representation of Ireland in that\r\n      Parliament from its reduced figure of forty-two to such a number\r\n      (say seventy) as will represent Ireland’s claim to representation on\r\n      a population basis. That is to say, the Irish Parliament will send\r\n      some twenty-eight of its members to reinforce the forty-two members\r\n      who are directly elected to the Imperial Parliament by the\r\n      constituencies. It is only proper that Ireland should not be\r\n      required to contribute to Imperial purposes except with the consent\r\n      of the full representation to which she is entitled. But the clause\r\n      will require more careful definition: for example, the Irish\r\n      Parliament ought to be required to choose these twenty-eight\r\n      delegates in proportion to the representation of Irish parties in\r\n      the Imperial Parliament, so as not to “pack” the delegation. It can\r\n      hardly be denied that the provision makes a change in the\r\n      constitution of the Imperial Parliament itself, and a somewhat\r\n      anomalous one. It ought to be carefully considered in Committee. So,\r\n      also, ought the powers of the Joint Exchequer Board, whose decisions\r\n      are to be “final and conclusive.”\r\n\r\n   17 Clause XLI.\r\n\r\n   18 Clause XLI. (2).\r\n\r\n   19 The power of the Dominion Parliament to make laws for the peace,\r\n      order, and good government of Canada has, however, been so\r\n      interpreted as to permit of a large degree of concurrent\r\n      legislation. See _Russell_ v. _The Queen_, 7 App. Cas. 829. The\r\n      Dominion Government can also exercise a veto on provincial\r\n      legislation when it runs counter to the “settled policy” of the\r\n      Dominion. But in these respects the Canadian Constitution diverges\r\n      from the true Federal type.\r\n\r\n_   20 The King_ v. _Barger_, Commonwealth Law Reports, VI., p. 41.\r\n\r\n_   21 Riel_ v. _The Queen_, 10 App. Cas. 675.\r\n\r\n   22 Cf. _Reg._ v. _Burah_, 3 App. Cas. 889; _Hodge_ v. _The Queen_, 9\r\n      App. Cas. 117; _Powell_ v. _The Apollo Candle Company_, 10 App. Cas.\r\n      282.\r\n\r\n   23 The Imperial Parliament can, of course, legislate for any part of\r\n      the world (_Cf._ _Earl Russell’s_ Case, 1901, App. Cas. 446), but\r\n      its power is limited in practice.\r\n\r\n_   24 Cf._ _Bank of Toronto_ v. _Lambe_, 12 App. Cas. 575.\r\n\r\n   25 In _McCulloch_ v. _Maryland_, 4 Wheaton 316.\r\n\r\n   26 I am concerned here only with the justification for the omission of\r\n      constitutional restrictions. The Bill, as compared with its\r\n      predecessors, is conspicuous in this respect. Such restrictions as\r\n      it actually contains are dealt with by Sir John Macdonell in Chapter\r\n      IV.\r\n\r\n   27 Let me cite in illustration _Tilonko_ v. _The Attorney-General of\r\n      Natal_, L.R. (1907), A.C. 93 and 461, and _Philips_ v. _Eyre_\r\n      (1869), Q.B.\r\n\r\n_   28 Walker_ v. _Sauvinet_, 92 U.S. 90.\r\n\r\n_   29 Cf._ Clause IV. (8) of the 1893 Bill.\r\n\r\n   30 Such legislation must affect alike all persons similarly situated,\r\n      _cf._ _Yick Wo_ v. _Hopkins_, 118 U.S. 356.\r\n\r\n_   31 Cf._ on this subject the decision of the Judicial Committee in\r\n      _Union Colliery Co. of British Columbia_ v. _Bryden_ (1899) A.C.\r\n      580.\r\n\r\n   32 “Towards a Social Policy” (1905).\r\n\r\n   33 For example, the statutory limitations of the doctrine of common\r\n      employment which was based on the common law doctrine that the\r\n      workman had freely contracted to undertake the risks of his\r\n      employment.\r\n\r\n   34 Mr. Justice O. W. Holmes, of the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\n      writes to me on the subject of constitutional restrictions as\r\n      follows: “The police power is a ’conciliatory phrase’ to cover the\r\n      fact that if the infringement is not very big it will be sustained.\r\n      The police power would warrant a State law limiting the height of\r\n      buildings in a certain region to, say, 70 feet; but if you limited\r\n      them to 5 feet you would have to fall back on Eminent Domain and pay\r\n      for it—so that the beginning of constitutional rights may be\r\n      measured in feet. In other words, constitutional restrictions cannot\r\n      be carried to extremes, but end in a penumbra.”\r\n\r\n   35 The best example of this liberalising interpretation of the police\r\n      power is the famous _Slaughter House Case_ (16 Wall. 36). _Cf._ as\r\n      to regulation of the liquor trade _Barbemeyer_ v. _Iowa_ (18 Wall.\r\n      129), and _Mayler_ v. _Kansas_ (123 U.S. 623). For a general review\r\n      of cases bearing on the restrictive words of the Fourteenth\r\n      Amendment and their qualification by the necessity of allowing State\r\n      Legislatures the benefit of the police power, see the case of the\r\n      Utah Miners Act, 18 Supreme Court Reporter 383.\r\n\r\n_   36 Cf._ the leading case of _Metropolitan Asylums Board_ v. _Hill_ and\r\n      _cf._ _Partington_ v. _The Attorney-General_, L.R. 4 H.L. 122.\r\n\r\n   37 The decisions of the Supreme Court at Washington in the annexation\r\n      cases are a remarkable example of this. Their decision in the case\r\n      of _Dorr_ v. _United States_ that trial by jury did not extend to\r\n      the Philippines, on the ground that it was not a right fundamental\r\n      in its nature, set up a distinction which is not to be found in the\r\n      Constitution itself, and therefore left it to the court to decide\r\n      principles of constitutional law which are unwritten. _Cf. Harvard\r\n      Law Review XIX._ 547.\r\n\r\n   38 As to the safeguard against legislation affecting the rights of\r\n      religious minorities and to laws of marriage, see Sir John\r\n      Macdonell’s remarks in Chapter IV. _infra_.\r\n\r\n_   39 Cf. Philips __v.__ Eyre_ _supra_.\r\n\r\n   40 This would apply to the Tenure of Office Act.\r\n\r\n   41 The mere fact that the Crown had given its consent to an Irish Act\r\n      would not make that Act _intra vires_ if it exceeded the powers of\r\n      the Irish Legislature. It might subsequently be declared _ultra\r\n      vires_ by a Court at any time.\r\n\r\n   42 I am not at all sure that this provision was necessary. The Crown\r\n      already has the power under 3 & 4 Will. IV. cap 41, sec. 4 to refer\r\n      to the Judicial Committee any such matters whatsoever as it may\r\n      think fit. The Canadian Government has a similar power conferred on\r\n      it by the Supreme Court Act, 1875, extended by 54 & 55 Vict.,\r\n      enabling the Governor-General in Council to refer to the Supreme\r\n      Court certain specified matters, particularly questions touching the\r\n      validity of provincial or Dominion legislation. The decision of the\r\n      court operates as a declaratory judgment, on which an appeal may be\r\n      taken to the Judicial Committee. For example of its exercise _cf._\r\n      the Manitoba Schools Case. See Sir Frederick Pollock’s remarks in\r\n      Chapter III.\r\n\r\n   43 The English judges, even when favourable to the claims of the early\r\n      Irish Parliament, insisted on this limitation. _Cf._ the Case of the\r\n      Merchants of Waterford; Year Book, Ric. III., fol. 12.\r\n\r\n_   44 Cf._ Section 264 of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894; also the\r\n      Fugitive Offenders Act of 1881 (44 & 45 Vict., cap. 69).\r\n\r\n_   45 Cf._ the Naturalization Act of 1870.\r\n\r\n   46 The law as to treason is not necessarily the same in the Colonies.\r\n      _Cf. Riel_ v. _The Queen_, 10 App. Cas. 675, and also _R._ v.\r\n      _Marais_, L.T. Rep. LXXXV., p. 363.\r\n\r\n   47 There can, I think, be no doubt as to the necessity. I know but one\r\n      opinion, and not a very authoritative one, to the contrary, namely\r\n      that of a Chief Justice of the Colony of Victoria. See _Musgrove_ v.\r\n      _Toy_ V.L. Rep. XIV. 349, and _supra_.\r\n\r\n   48 Even, however, if there had not been such an express grant of the\r\n      executive power in the Act, the Irish Parliament might, I think,\r\n      have assumed it by legislation. A colonial Legislature can, subject,\r\n      of course, to the veto of the Crown, confer on the Colonial\r\n      Government the prerogatives in so far as they are necessary to the\r\n      domestic government of the colony. _Cf._ Lefroy, “Legislative Power\r\n      in Canada,” p. 180.\r\n\r\n   49 No doubt the statutory powers exercisable under the first two Acts\r\n      would come within the control of the Irish Government.\r\n\r\n   50 His office is not the creation of statute except in so far as it was\r\n      necessary to place his salary on the Estimates. His office has,\r\n      however, frequently received statutory recognition in connection\r\n      with the creation of new Departments. _Cf._ the Irish Local\r\n      Government Board Act (1872), Section 3.\r\n\r\n   51 I have examined with some care the theory of Second Chambers in my\r\n      articles in _The Nineteenth Century_, for November, 1910, and June,\r\n      1911. I may also refer the reader to my book on “The House of Lords\r\n      and the Constitution,” and particularly to the Lord Chancellor’s\r\n      preface to the same. Foreign examples are dealt with in the reprint\r\n      of the author’s lectures on “The Place of a Second Chamber in the\r\n      Constitution” (1911).\r\n\r\n   52 There is this much to be said for nomination, that it does fulfil\r\n      the condition laid down by Alexander Hamilton and by Story as the\r\n      first canon of the bi-cameral theory—namely, that the basis of the\r\n      two chambers should be radically different. See Story’s Commentaries\r\n      (ed. Bigelow) Vol. I., Section 690. This is not so easy to secure by\r\n      election in modern times when there is suspicion of any other than a\r\n      democratic franchise.\r\n\r\n   53 Clause XII.

Under this section the question\r\n      whether the Royal assent should be given to a Bill of the Irish\r\n      Parliament could certainly be referred to the Judicial Committee,\r\n      but it seems doubtful whether an Act already passed could be so\r\n      dealt with, as the matter would then be beyond the competence of an\r\n      Order in Council.\r\n\r\n   83 See Prof. Harrison Moore in _Law Quart. Rev._, xx. 236.\r\n\r\n   84 The Syllabus of March 8th, 1861 (Proposition 57) condemned the\r\n      proposition that “any other religion than the Roman Catholic may be\r\n      established by the State.”\r\n\r\n   85 To illustrate this, I quote first from a Roman Catholic writer of\r\n      distinction: “Religious liberty may be introduced when it is\r\n      required for the common good, to prevent greater evils, or when it\r\n      has been a necessity” (Hergenröther, Vol. II., p. 364). “Where\r\n      modern States exist with freedom of conscience and several religious\r\n      denominations with equal rights, it is impossible further to carry\r\n      out the principles of the Church. In these days the Church is\r\n      confined to the purely ecclesiastical domain, and her whole\r\n      endeavours must be directed to preserve her necessary freedom, or if\r\n      she does not possess it, to win it back” (Hergenröther, Vol. I., p.\r\n      65). The next quotation is from a modern Protestant historian “The\r\n      Pope would like to have freedom of conscience in Sweden and Russia;\r\n      but he does not wish for it on principle, but only as a means which\r\n      may be used by Providence to propagate the truth in those countries.\r\n      Pius IX. and Mgr. Pie were agreed that only in countries where the\r\n      Catholics are in a minority might religious freedom be wished for by\r\n      Catholics” (Nielsen “History of the Papacy in the Nineteenth\r\n      Century,” Vol. II., p. 263). See also _Ueber die Entwickelung des\r\n      Katolischen Kirchenrechts im 19. Jahrhundert_, Von Dr. Fritz\r\n      Fleiner.\r\n\r\n   86 Mr. Gladstone (“Church and State,” p. 185) enumerates eight\r\n      principles adopted by modern Governments with regard to the support\r\n      of religion and the treatment of its varieties. He subsequently\r\n      reduces them to four; the first in which heresy and schism were\r\n      visited with civil penalty _pro salute animæ_ for the cure of the\r\n      individual. The second in which they were similarly visited, but\r\n      chiefly in the view of preventing the infection of society within\r\n      which limits they had appeared. The third in which disqualifications\r\n      of a civil kind are imposed instead of penalties. The fourth is that\r\n      in which all forms of religion claim from Government a precisely\r\n      equal regard, as respects either civil privileges or positive\r\n      assistance (pp. 187, 188). Zeller (“Staat und Kirche,” p. 6) reduces\r\n      the principles to three; substantial identity of Church and State;\r\n      complete separation; partial separation and identity.\r\n\r\n   87 As to meaning of “establishment,” see _Bradfield_ v. _Roberts_\r\n      (1899), 175 U.S. 291.\r\n\r\n   88 The German _Reichsgesetz_ of July 3rd, 1869, expressly repeals all\r\n      civic disqualifications based upon religion (Laband, Vol. I., p.\r\n      148).\r\n\r\n   89 See as to cases which have come before the Swiss Courts (Buckhardt,\r\n      p. 484).\r\n\r\n   90 Keith: “Responsible Government in the Dominions,” Vol. III., 1423n.\r\n      In Gignac’s “Compendium Juris Canonici ad Usum Cleri Canadensis”\r\n      (1901) is a statement of the large rights which the Catholic Church\r\n      has acquired in Canada in virtue of treaties.\r\n\r\n   91 See, as to the effect of this section, _Barrett_ v. _City of\r\n      Winnipeg_ (1892) A.C. 445; also _Brophy_ v. _Attorney-General of\r\n      Manitoba_ (1895) A.C. 202.\r\n\r\n   92 “There is at present no general marriage law for the Dominion, and\r\n      it is disputed whether the Dominion Parliament has power to pass\r\n      such an Act. Each province has legislated with respect to this\r\n      subject. The Government of the Dominion have just referred to the\r\n      Supreme Court (March 11th) a stated case regarding the respective\r\n      jurisdictions of the Dominion and provinces in regard to a marriage\r\n      law. The Quebec provinces argued that there is no power on the part\r\n      of the Dominion Parliament to submit such a case to the Supreme\r\n      Court.

If in the\r\n      six years of Imperial control the cost rises to (say)\r\n      £1,500,000-£1,500,000 will be the sum transferred; but the Bill does\r\n      not say what is to happen if the cost were to fall to (say)\r\n      £1,300,000.

III., c. 28.\r\n\r\n  144 Much interesting light has been thrown on the history of the\r\n      struggle in 1782-1783 between Grattan and Flood, by the publication\r\n      of the Diary and Correspondence of Lord Charlemont, in the Reports\r\n      of the Historical MSS. Commission, Twelfth Report, Appendix Part X.,\r\n      1891. The abstract doctrine of the legislative supremacy of the\r\n      British Parliament, and not only the practical application of that\r\n      doctrine, was strenuously disputed by many of the leaders of\r\n      Colonial Opinion in America as well as in Ireland at the\r\n      commencement of the XVIIIth century, as a reference to the\r\n      literature of the Stamp Act and the Declaratory Act of 1766 will\r\n      show. The doctrine itself was one of the consequences of the\r\n      Revolution of 1688, which true to the general principle of exalting\r\n      the importance of the British Parliament, abolished on the one hand\r\n      the right of the Crown to tax the Colonies by virtue of its\r\n      prerogative, and on the other asserted a right in the British\r\n      Parliament to legislate and tax in the “settled” Colonies of the\r\n      Crown concurrently with the local representative assemblies, and, if\r\n      necessary, over their heads. The same class of arguments were used\r\n      both by Colonial and by Irish statesmen against the claims of the\r\n      British Parliament to interfere as between them and the Crown; but\r\n      the Irish case was always the stronger of the two, because her\r\n      advocates were able to start from the admitted right and position of\r\n      Ireland as a kingdom, with a Crown of her own. To the claims of the\r\n      British Parliament, the Whig statesmen, recognising their danger in\r\n      practice, tried to set constitutional limitations, and hence grew up\r\n      the distinction, on which the elder Pitt relied, between the right\r\n      of Great Britain to impose by law internal taxation within the\r\n      Colonies for the purposes of revenue, and her right to levy external\r\n      taxation for the regulation of Colonial trade. This distinction,\r\n      however, from a legal point of view, Lord Mansfield showed, would\r\n      not bear examination, and he laid down the law to be, that the\r\n      Parliament of Great Britain had an absolute legislative supremacy\r\n      over her Colonies—and by implication over Ireland—in all cases\r\n      whatever, whether for internal or external objects; whether to\r\n      impose a tax, or to regulate trade; whether to levy money, or to\r\n      make general enactments; and this doctrine it was which was recorded\r\n      in the Declaratory Act of George III. of 1766, relating to the\r\n      Colonies, the counterpart of the Declaratory Act of George I.,\r\n      relating to Ireland.
