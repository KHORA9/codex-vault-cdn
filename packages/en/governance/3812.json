He hit the line hard and did not flinch. And his laugh\r\nshook the skies.\r\n\r\nCame Wilson. And the Typical American was troubled about his soul.\r\nRooted firmly in the church-going past, he carried the banner of\r\nthe Lord, Democracy, idealistic, bent on perfecting that old\r\nincorrigible Man, he cuts off the right hand that offends him and\r\nvotes for prohibition and woman suffrage, a Round Head in a Ford.\r\n\r\nEight years and we have the perfectly typical American, Warren\r\nGamaliel Harding of the modern type, the Square Head, typical of\r\nthat America whose artistic taste is the movies, who reads and\r\nfinds mental satisfaction in the vague inanities of the small town\r\nnewspaper, who has faith in America, who is for liberty, virtue,\r\nhappiness, prosperity, law and order and all the standard\r\ngeneralities and holds them a perfect creed; who distrusts anything\r\nnew except mechanical inventions, the standardized product of the\r\nsyndicate which supplies his nursing bottle, his school books, his\r\ninformation, his humor in a strip, his art on a screen, with a\r\nquantity production mind, cautious, uniformly hating divergence\r\nfrom uniformity, jailing it in troublous times, prosperous, who has\r\nhis car and his bank account and can sell a bill of goods as well\r\nas the best of them.\r\n\r\nPeople who insist upon having their politics logical demand to know\r\nthe why of Harding. Why was a man of so undistinguished a record as\r\nhe first chosen as a candidate for President and then elected\r\nPresident?\r\n\r\nAs a legislator he had left no mark on legislation. If he had\r\nretired from Congress at the end of his term his name would have\r\nexisted only in the old Congressional directories, like that of a\r\nthousand others. As a public speaker he had said nothing that\r\nanybody could remember. He had passed through a Great War and left\r\nno mark on it. He had shared in a fierce debate upon the peace that\r\nfollowed the war but though you can recall small persons like\r\nMcCumber and Kellogg and Moses and McCormick in that discussion you\r\ndo not recall Harding. To be sure he made a speech in that debate\r\nwhich he himself says was a great speech but no newspaper thought\r\nfit to publish it because of its quality, or felt impelled to\r\npublish it in spite of its quality because it had been made by\r\nHarding.\r\n\r\nHe neither compelled attention by what he said nor by his\r\npersonality. Why, then, without fireworks, without distinction of\r\nany sort, without catching the public eye, or especially deserving\r\nto catch it, was Warren Harding elected President of the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nOne plausible reason why he was nominated was that given by Senator\r\nBrandegee at Chicago, where he had a great deal to do with the\r\nnomination. \"There ain't any first raters this year. This ain't any\r\n1880 or any 1904. We haven't any John Shermans or Theodore\r\nRoosevelts. We've got a lot of second raters and Warren Harding is\r\nthe best of the second raters.\"\r\n\r\nOnce nominated as a Republican his election of course inevitably\r\nfollowed. But to accept Mr. Brandegee's plea in avoidance is to\r\nagree to the eternal poverty of American political life, for most\r\nof our presidents have been precisely like Warren G. Harding,\r\nfirst-class second raters.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harding, a woman of sound sense and much energy, had an\r\nexcellent instructive answer to the \"why.\" The pictures of the\r\nhouse in Marion, the celebrated front porch, herself and her\r\nhusband were taken to be exhibited by cinema all over the land. She\r\nsaid, \"I want the people to see these pictures so that they will\r\nknow we are just folks like themselves.\"\r\n\r\nWarren Harding is \"just folks.\" A witty woman said of him, alluding\r\nto the small town novel which was popular at the time of his\r\ninauguration, \"Main Street has arrived in the White House.\"\r\n\r\nThe Average Man has risen up and by seven million majority elected\r\nan Average Man President. His defects were his virtues. He was\r\nchosen rather for what he wasn't than for what he was,--the\r\ninconspicuousness of his achievements. The \"just folks\" level of\r\nhis mind, his small town man's caution, his sense of the security\r\nof the past, his average hopes and fears and practicality, his\r\nstandardized Americanism which would enable a people who wanted for\r\na season to do so to take themselves politically for granted.\r\n\r\nThe country was tired of the high thinking and rather plain\r\nspiritual living of Woodrow Wilson. It desired the man in the White\r\nHouse to cause it no more moral overstrain than does the man you\r\nmeet in the Pullman smoking compartment or the man who writes the\r\ncaptions for the movies who employs a sort of Inaugural style,\r\nfreed from the inhibitions of statesmanship. It was in a mood\r\nsimilar to that of Mr. Harding himself when after his election he\r\ntook Senators Freylinghuysen, Hale, and Elkins with him on his trip\r\nto Texas. Senator Knox observing his choice is reported to have\r\nsaid, \"I think he is taking those three along because he wanted\r\ncomplete mental relaxation.\" All his life Mr. Harding has shown a\r\npredilection for companions who give him complete mental\r\nrelaxation, though duty compels him to associate with the Hughes\r\nand the Hoovers. The conflict between duty and complete mental\r\nrelaxation establishes a strong bond of sympathy between him and\r\nthe average American.\r\n\r\nThe \"why\" of Harding is the democratic passion for equality. We are\r\nstandardized, turned out like Fords by the hundred million, and we\r\ncannot endure for long anyone who is not standardized. Such an one\r\ncasts reflections upon us; why should we by our votes unnecessarily\r\nasperse ourselves? Occasionally we may indulge nationally, as men\r\ndo individually, in the romantic belief that we are somebody else,\r\nthat we are like Roosevelt or Wilson--and they become typical of\r\nwhat we would be--but always we come back to the knowledge that we\r\nare nationally like Harding, who is typical of what we are. \"Just\r\nfolks\" Kuppenheimered, movieized, associated pressed folks.\r\n\r\nMen debate whether or not Mr. Wilson was a great man and they will\r\nkeep on doing so until the last of those passes away whose judgment\r\nof him is clouded by the sense of his personality. But men will\r\nnever debate about the greatness of Mr. Harding, not even Mr.\r\nHarding himself. He is modest. He has only two vanities, his vanity\r\nabout his personal appearance and his vanity about his literary\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\nThe inhibitions of a presidential candidate, bound to speak and say\r\nnothing, irked him.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I could make better speeches than these\" he told a\r\nfriend during the campaign, \"but I have to be so careful.\"\r\n\r\nIn his inaugural address he let himself go, as much as it is\r\npossible for a man so cautious as he is to let himself go. It was a\r\ngreat speech, an inaugural to place alongside the inaugurals of\r\nLincoln and Washington, written in his most capable English,\r\nHarding at his best. It is hard for a man to move Marion for years\r\nwith big editorials, to receive the daily compliments of Dick\r\nCressinger and Jim Prendergast, without becoming vain of the power\r\nof his pen. It is his chief vanity and it is one that it is hard\r\nfor him who speaks or writes to escape. He has none of that egotism\r\nwhich makes a self-confident man think himself the favorite of\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nHe said after his nomination at Chicago, \"We drew to a pair of\r\ndeuces and filled.\" He did not say it boastfully as a man who likes\r\nto draw to a pair of deuces and who always expects to fill. He said\r\nit with surprise and relief. He does not like to hold a pair of\r\ndeuces and be forced to draw to them. He has not a large way of\r\nregarding losing and winning as all a part of the game. He hates to\r\nlose. He hated to lose even a friendly game of billiards in the\r\nMarion Club with his old friend Colonel Christian, father of his\r\nsecretary, though the stake was only a cigar.\r\n\r\nWhen he was urged to seek the Republican nomination for the\r\nPresidency he is reported to have said, \"Why should I. My chances\r\nof winning are not good. If I let you use my name I shall probably\r\nin the end lose the nomination for the Senate. (His term was\r\nexpiring.) If I don't run for the Presidency I can stay in the\r\nSenate all my life. I like the Senate. It is a very pleasant\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate is like Marion, Ohio, a very pleasant place, for a\r\ncertain temperament. And Mr. Harding stayed in Marion all his life\r\nuntil force--a vis exterior; there is nothing inside Mr. Harding\r\nthat urges him on and on--until force of circumstances, of\r\npolitics, of other men's ambitions, took him out of Marion and set\r\nhim down in Washington, in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe process of uprooting him from the pleasant place of Marion is\r\nreported to have been thus described by his political transplanter,\r\nthe present Attorney General, Mr. Daugherty: \"When it came to\r\nrunning for the Senate I found him, sunning himself in Florida,\r\nlike a turtle on a log and I had to push him into the water and\r\nmake him swim.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a similar thing happened when it came to running for the\r\nPresidency. It is a definite type of man who suns himself on a log,\r\nwho is seduced by pleasant places like Marion, Ohio, whom the big\r\ntown does not draw into its magnetic field, whose heart is not\r\nexcited by the larger chances of life. Is he lazy? Is he lacking in\r\nimagination? Does he hate to lose? Does he want self-confidence? Is\r\nhe over modest? Has he no love for life, life as a great adventure?\r\nWhatever he is, Mr. Harding is that kind of man, that kind of man\r\nto start out with.\r\n\r\nBut this is only the point of departure, that choice to remain in a\r\npleasant place like Marion, not to risk what you have, your sure\r\nplace in society as the son of one of the better families, the\r\nreasonable prospect that the growth of your small town will bring\r\nsome accretion to your own fortunes, the decision not to hazard\r\ngreatly in New York or Chicago or on the frontier. Life asks little\r\nof you in those pleasant places like Marion and in return for that\r\nlittle gives generously, especially if you are, to begin with, well\r\nplaced, if you are ingratiatingly handsome, if your personality is\r\nagreeable--\"The best fellow in the world to play poker with all\r\nSaturday night,\" as a Marionite feelingly described the President\r\nto me, and if you have a gift of words as handsome and abundant as\r\nyour looks.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding is a handsome man, endowed with the gifts that\r\nreinforce the charm of his exterior, a fine voice, a winning smile,\r\na fluency of which his inaugural is the best instance; an ample\r\nman, you might say. But he is too handsome, too endowed, for his\r\nown good, his own spiritual good. The slight stoop of his\r\nshoulders, the soft figure, the heaviness under the eyes betray in\r\nsome measure perhaps the consequences of nature's excessive\r\ngenerosity. Given all these things you take, it may be, too much\r\nfor granted. There is not much to stiffen the mental, moral, and\r\nphysical fibers.\r\n\r\nGiven such good looks, such favor from nature, and an environment\r\nin which the struggle is not sharp and existence is a species of\r\nmildly purposeful flanerie. You lounge a bit stoop-shoulderedly\r\nforward to success. There is nothing hard about the President. I\r\nonce described him in somewhat this fashion to a banker in New York\r\nwho was interested in knowing what kind of a President we had.\r\n\r\n\"You agree,\" he said, \"with a friend of Harding's who came in to\r\nsee me a few days ago. This friend said to me 'Warren is the best\r\nfellow in the world. He has wonderful tact. He knows how to make\r\nmen work with him and how to get the best out of them. He is\r\npolitically adroit. He is conscientious. He has a keen sense of his\r\nresponsibilities. He has unusual common sense.' And he named other\r\nsimilar virtues, 'Well,' I asked him, 'What is his defect?' 'Oh,'\r\nhe replied, 'the only trouble with Warren is that he lacks\r\nmentality.'\"\r\n\r\nThe story, like most stories, exaggerates. The President has the\r\naverage man's virtues of common sense and conscientiousness with\r\nrather more than the average man's political skill and the average\r\nman's industry or lack of industry. His mentality is not lacking;\r\nit is undisciplined, especially in its higher ranges, by hard\r\neffort. There is a certain softness about him mentally. It is not\r\nan accident that his favorite companions are the least intellectual\r\nmembers of that house of average intelligence, the Senate. They\r\nremind him of the mental surroundings of Marion, the pleasant but\r\nunstimulating mental atmosphere of the Marion Club, with its\r\nsuccessful small town business men, its local storekeepers, its\r\nbanker whose mental horizon is bounded by Marion County, the value\r\nof whose farm lands for mortgages he knows to a penny, the lumber\r\ndealer whose eye rests on the forests of Kentucky and West\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe President has never felt the sharpening of competition. He was\r\na local pundit because he was the editor. He was the editor because\r\nhe owned the Republican paper of Marion. There was no effective\r\nrival. No strong intelligence challenged his and made him fight for\r\nhis place. He never studied hard or thought deeply on public\r\nquestions. A man who stays where he is put by birth tends to accept\r\nauthority, and authority is strong in small places. The acceptance\r\nof authority implies few risks. It is like staying in Marion\r\ninstead of going to New York or even Cleveland. It is easier, and\r\noften more profitable than studying hard or thinking deeply or\r\ninquiring too much.\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Harding's is a mind that bows to authority. What his party\r\nsays is enough for Mr. Harding. His party is for protection and Mr.\r\nHarding is for protection; the arguments for protection may be\r\nreadily assimilated from the editorials of one good big city\r\nnewspaper and from a few campaign addresses. His party is for the\r\nremission of tolls on American shipping in the Panama Canal and Mr.\r\nHarding is for the remission of tolls. Mr. Root broke with his\r\nparty on tolls and Mr. Harding is as much shocked at Mr. Root's\r\ndeviation as the matrons of Marion would be over the public\r\ndisregard of the Seventh Commandment by one of their number. His\r\nparty became somehow for the payment of Colombia's Panama claims\r\nand Mr. Harding was for their payment.\r\n\r\nA story tells just how Senator Kellogg went to the President to\r\noppose the Colombia treaty. After hearing Mr. Kellogg Mr. Harding\r\nremarked, \"Well, Frank, you have something on me. You've evidently\r\nread the treaty. I haven't.\"\r\n\r\nA mind accepting authority favors certain general policies. It is\r\nnot sufficiently inquiring to trouble itself with the details. Mr.\r\nHarding is for all sorts of things but is content to be merely for\r\nthem. A curious illustration developed in Marion, during the visits\r\nof the best minds. He said to the newspaper men there one day, \"I\r\nam for voluntary military training.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you train, Mr. President,\" asked one of the\r\njournalists, \"officers or men?\"\r\n\r\nThe President hesitated. At last he said, \"I haven't thought of\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said one of his interlocutors, \"the colleges are training a\r\nlot of officers now.\"\r\n\r\nThis brought no response.\r\n\r\nAnother who had experience in the Great War remarked, \"In the last\r\nwar we were lacking in trained non-coms; it would be a good idea to\r\ntrain a lot of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" rejoined Mr. Harding eagerly, \"That would be a good idea.\"\r\n\r\nA more inquiring mind would have gone further than to be \"for\r\nvoluntary military training.\" A quicker, less cautious, if no more\r\nthorough mind would have answered the first question, \"What would\r\nyou train, officers or men?\" by answering instantly \"Both.\"\r\n\r\nIn that colloquy you have revealed all the mental habits of Mr.\r\nHarding. He was asked once, after he had had several conferences\r\nwith Senator McCumber, Senator Smoot, Representative Fordney, and\r\nothers who would be responsible for financial legislation, \"Have\r\nyou worked out the larger details of your taxation policy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally not!\" was his reply. That \"naturally\" sprang I suppose\r\nfrom his habit of believing that somewhere there is authority.\r\nSomewhere there would be authority to determine what the larger\r\ndetails of the party's financial policy should be.\r\n\r\nNow, this authority is not going to be any one man or any two men.\r\nThe President, his friends tell us, is jealous of any assumption of\r\npower by any of his advisers. He is unwilling to have the public\r\nthink that any other than himself is President. A man as handsome\r\nas Harding, as vain of his literary style as he is, has an ego that\r\nis not capable of total self-effacement. He will bow to impersonal\r\nauthority like that of the party, or invoke the anonymous\r\ngovernance of \"best minds,\" calling rather often on God as a well\r\nestablished authority, but he will not let authority be personal\r\nand be called Daugherty, or Lodge or Knox or whomever you will.\r\n\r\nThe President's attitude is rather like that of the average man\r\nduring the campaign. If you said to a voter on a Pullman, \"Mr.\r\nHarding is a man of small public experience, not known by any large\r\npolitical accomplishment,\" he would always answer optimistically,\r\n\"Well, they will see to it that he makes good.\" Asked who \"They\"\r\nwere he was always vague and elusive, gods on the mountain perhaps.\r\nThere is an American religion, the average man's faith: it is\r\n\"Them.\" \"They\" are the fountain of authority.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Harding knew little competition in Marion so he has known\r\nlittle competition in public life which in this country is not\r\ngenuinely competitive. Mr. Lloyd George is at the head of the\r\nBritish government because he is the greatest master of the House\r\nof Commons in a generation and he is chosen by the men who know him\r\nfor what he is, his fellow members of the House of Commons. An\r\nAmerican President is selected by the newspapers, which know little\r\nabout him, by the politicians, who do not want a master but a\r\nslave, by the delegates to a national convention, tired, with hotel\r\nbills mounting, ready to name anybody in order to go home. The\r\npresidency, the one great prize in American public life, is\r\nattained by no known rules and under conditions which have nothing\r\nin them to make a man work hard or think hard, especially one\r\nendowed with a handsome face and figure, an ingratiating\r\npersonality, and a literary style.\r\n\r\nThe small town man, unimaginative and of restricted mental horizon\r\ndoes not think in terms of masses of mankind. Masses vaguely appall\r\nhim. They exist in the big cities on which he turned his back in\r\nhis unaudacious youth. His contacts are with individuals. His\r\ndemocracy consists in smiling upon the village painter and calling\r\nhim \"Harry,\" in always nodding to the village cobbler and calling\r\nhim \"Bill,\" in stopping on the street corner with a group, which\r\nhas not been invited to join the village club, putting his hand on\r\nthe shoulder of one of them and calling them \"Fellows.\"\r\n\r\nPolitics in the small town is limited to dealing with persons, to\r\nenlisting the support of men with a following at the polls.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding once drew this picture of his idea of politics. \"If I\r\nhad a policy to put over I should go about it this way,\" he said.\r\n\"You all know the town meeting, if not by experience, by hearsay.\r\nNow if I had a program that I wanted to have adopted by a town\r\nmeeting I should go to the three or four most influential men in my\r\ncommunity. I should talk it out with them. I should make\r\nconcessions to them until I had got them to agree with me. And then\r\nI should go into the town meeting feeling perfectly confident that\r\nmy plan would go through. Well it's the same in the nation as in\r\nthe town meeting, or in the whole world, if you will. I should\r\nalways go first to the three or four leading men.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harding thinks of politics in this personal way. He does not\r\nconceive of it as the force of ideas or the weight of morality\r\nmoving the hearts of mankind. Mankind is only a word to him, one\r\nthat he often uses,--or perhaps he prefers humanity, which has two\r\nmore syllables--a large loose word that he employs to make his\r\nthought look bigger than it really is, something like the stage\r\ndevice for making an ordinary man seem ten feet tall.\r\n\r\nThus he will never try to move the mass of the people as his\r\npredecessors have. He will not \"go to the country.\" He will not\r\nbring public opinion to bear as a disciplinary force in his\r\nhousehold. He will treat the whole United States as if it were a\r\nMarion, consulting endless \"best minds,\" composing differences,\r\nseeking unity, with the aid of his exceptional tact.\r\n\r\nThis attitude has its disadvantages. If you have a passion for\r\nideas and an indifference for persons you can say \"yes\" or \"no\"\r\neasily; you may end by being dictatorial and arrogant, as Mr.\r\nWilson was; but you will not be weak. If, on the contrary, you are\r\nindifferent to ideas and considerate of persons you find it hard to\r\nsay \"Decided\" to any question. And somewhere there must be\r\nauthority, the passing of the final judgment and the giving of\r\norders.\r\n\r\nBut he compensates for his own defects. Almost as good as greatness\r\nis a knowledge of your own limitations; and Mr. Harding knows his\r\nthoroughly. Out of his modesty, his desire to reinforce himself,\r\nhas proceeded the strongest cabinet that Washington has seen in a\r\ngeneration. He likes to have decisions rest upon the broad base of\r\nmore than one intelligence and he has surrounded himself for this\r\npurpose with able associates. His policies will lack imagination,\r\nwhich is not a composite product, but they will have practicality,\r\nwhich is the greatest common denomination of several minds; and he,\r\nmoreover, is himself unimaginative and practical.\r\n\r\nWhatever superstructure of world organization he takes part in,\r\nbehind it will be the reality, a private understanding with the\r\nbiggest man in sight; for this reason the fall of Lloyd George and\r\nthe succession of a Labor government in England will disconcert him\r\nterribly. The democratic passion for equality, which dogs the\r\ntracks of the great, he mollifies by reminding the nation always\r\nthat he is \"just folks,\" by opening the White House lawn gates, by\r\ncalling everyone by his first name. So constant is his aim to\r\nappease it that I wonder if he is not sometimes betrayed into\r\naddressing his Secretary of State as \"Charley.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe explanation of President Wilson will be found in a certain\r\ninferiority. When all his personal history becomes known, when his\r\npapers and letters have all been published and read, when the\r\nmemoirs of others have told all that there is to be told, there\r\nwill stand clear something inadequate, a lack of robustness, mental\r\nor nervous, an excessive sensitiveness, over self-consciousness,\r\nshrinking from life, a neurotic something that in the end brought\r\non defeat and the final overthrow. He was never quite a normal man\r\nwith the average man's capacity to endure and enjoy but a strange,\r\nimpeded, self-absorbed personality.\r\n\r\nHistory arranged the greatest stage of all time, and on it placed a\r\nlot of little figures, \"pigmy minds\"--all save one, and he the\r\nnearest great, an unworldly person summoned from a cloister, with\r\nthe vision of genius and the practical incapacity of one who has\r\nrun away from life, hating men but loving all mankind, eloquent but\r\ninarticulate in a large way, incapable of true self expression in\r\nhis chosen field of political action, so self-centered that he\r\nforgot the world's tragedy and merged it into his own, making great\r\nthings little and little things great, one of \"life's ironies,\" the\r\neverlasting refutation of the optimistic notion that when there is\r\na crisis fate produces a man big enough to meet it.\r\n\r\nThe world finds it hard to speak of Mr. Wilson except in superlatives.\r\nA British journalist called him the other day, \"the wickedest man in\r\nthe world.\" This was something new in extravagance. I asked, \"Why\r\nthe wickedest?\" He said, \"Because he was so unable to forget himself\r\nthat he brought the peace of the world down in a common smash with\r\nhis own personal fortunes.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand General Jan Christian Smuts, writing with that\r\nperspective which distance gives, pronounces it to be not Wilson's\r\nfault but the fault of humanity that the vision of universal peace\r\nfailed. Civilization was not advanced enough to make peace without\r\nvindictiveness possible.\r\n\r\nThis debate goes on and on. Mr. Wilson is either the worst hated or\r\nthe most regretted personality of the Great War. The place of no\r\none else is worth disputing. Lloyd George is the consummate\r\npolitician, limited by the meanness of his art. Clemenceau is the\r\npersonification of nationality, limited by the narrowness of his\r\nview. Mr. Wilson alone had his hour of superlative greatness when\r\nthe whole earth listened to him and followed him; an hour which\r\nended with him only dimly aware of his vision and furiously\r\nconscious of pin pricks.\r\n\r\nYou observe this inadequacy in Mr. Wilson, this incapacity to\r\nendure, at the outset of his career. It is characteristic of\r\ncertain temperaments that when they first face life they should run\r\naway from it as Mr. Wilson did when, having studied law and having\r\nbeen admitted to the bar, he abandoned practice and went to teach\r\nin a girls' school. That was the early sign in him of that sense of\r\nunfitness for the more arduous contacts of life which was so\r\nconspicuous a trait during his presidency. He could not endure\r\nmeeting men on an equal footing, where there was a conflict of\r\nwills, a rough clash of minds, where no concession was made to\r\nsensitiveness and egotism.\r\n\r\nSome nervous insufficiency causes this shrinking, like the quick\r\nretreat from cold water of an inadequate body. Commonly a man who\r\nruns away from life after the first contact with it hates himself\r\nfor his flight and there begins a conflict inside him which ends\r\neither in his admission of defeat and acknowledgment of his\r\nunfitness or in his convincing himself that his real motive was\r\ncontempt of that on which he turned his back. If he admits to\r\nhimself that he is really a little less courageous, a little more\r\nsensitive, a little less at home in this world, then he is gone. If\r\nhe does satisfy himself that he is superior, has higher ideals,\r\nworthier ends, despises the ordinary arts of success he becomes\r\narrogant, merely in self defense.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson's \"intellectual snobbism\" was this kind of arrogance,\r\nacquired for moral self preservation, like that of the small boy\r\nwho when his companions refuse to play with him says to himself\r\nthat he is smarter than they are, gets higher marks in school, that\r\nhe has a better gun than they have or that he, when he grows up,\r\nwill be a great general while they are nobody. Almost everyone who\r\nfeels himself unequal in some direction can satisfy himself that he\r\nexceeds in others. It is a common and human sort of arrogance, and\r\nMr. Wilson had it inordinately.\r\n\r\nHe hated and contemned the law, in which life had given him his\r\nfirst glimpse of his frailty. He would have no lawyers make the\r\npeace or draft the covenant of the league of nations. Lawyers were\r\npitiful creatures,--he kept one of them near him, Mr. Lansing,\r\nadmirably chosen, to remind him of how contemptible they were,\r\nliving in fear of precedents, writing a barbarous jargon out of\r\ndeeds and covenants, impeding the freedom of the imagination with\r\ntheir endless citations.\r\n\r\nHe despised politicians, he despised business men, he despised the\r\nwhole range of men who pursue worldly arts with success. He\r\ndespised the qualities which he had not himself, but like all men\r\nwho are arrogant self protectively he was driven to introspection\r\nand analyzed himself pitilessly.\r\n\r\nThe public got glimpses of these analyses. Sometimes he called that\r\nsomething in him which left him less fit for the world than the\r\naverage, a little regretfully, \"his single track mind.\" Sometimes\r\nit leaped to light as an object of pride, his arrogance again, a\r\npride that was \"too great to fight,\" like the common run of men,--in\r\nthe law courts or on the battlefields. He kept asking himself\r\nthe question, \"Why am I not as other men are?\", and sometimes his\r\nnature would rise up in protest and he would exclaim that he was as\r\nother men were and would pathetically tell the world that he was\r\n\"misunderstood,\" that he was not cold and reserved but warm and\r\ngenial and kindly, only largely because the world would see him as\r\nhe was.\r\n\r\nBut always the one safe recourse, the one assurance of personal\r\nstability was arrogance. Contempt was the most characteristic habit\r\nof his mind. Out of office he is no sage looking charitably at the\r\nfumbling of his successor.\r\n\r\nA friend who has seen him since his retirement describes him as\r\nwatching \"with supreme contempt\" the executive efforts of Mr.\r\nHarding. Washington gossip credits him with inventing the phrase,\r\n\"the bungalow mind,\" to describe the present occupant of the White\r\nHouse. Another remark of his about the new President is said to\r\nhave been \"I look forward to the new administration with no\r\nunpleasant anticipations, except those caused by Mr. Harding's\r\nliterary style.\"\r\n\r\nThere is always his contrast of others with himself to their\r\ndisadvantage, mentally or morally, as writers, or leaders, or\r\nstatesmen. So full a life as Mr. Wilson led in the last dozen or\r\nmore years ought to have made him less self-conscious. A robuster\r\nperson would have hated with a certain zest, continued with a\r\ncertain gaiety, laughed as he fought, found something to respect in\r\nhis foes, seen the curtain fall upon his own activities with a\r\ncertain cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nHe seems deficient in resources. He had not that gusto which richly\r\nendowed natures ordinarily have. He found no fun in measuring his\r\nstrength with other men's. There was a certain overstrain about\r\nhim, which made him cushion himself about with non-resistant\r\npersonalities. He lacked curiosity. His fine mind seemed to want\r\nthe energy to interest itself in the details of any subject that\r\nfilled it, and this was one of his fatal weaknesses at the Peace\r\nConference. Perhaps it was a deficiency of vital force. Moreover he\r\ncame to his great task tired. His life till he was past fifty was\r\none of defeat. There was the early disappointment and turning back\r\nfrom law practice, the giving up of his youthful ambition for a\r\npublic career to which he had trained himself passionately by the\r\nstudy of public speaking. Dr. Albert Shaw, who was his fellow\r\nstudent at Johns Hopkins, says that in the University Mr. Wilson\r\nwas the finest speaker, except possibly the old President of the\r\nCollege, Dr. Daniel Coit Gilman.\r\n\r\nThen there were the long years of poverty as a college professor,\r\nwhen he overworked at writing and university extension lectures, to\r\nmake his small salary as a teacher equal to the support of his\r\nfamily, his three children and his aged parents. There was his\r\nfailure at literature, for his \"History of the United States\"\r\nbrought him neither fame nor money, the public finding it dull and\r\nunreadable.\r\n\r\nThen the crowning unsuccess as President of Princeton; for when his\r\nluck changed and a political career opened to him as Governor of\r\nNew Jersey, with trustees and alumni against him, nothing seemed to\r\nbe before him but resignation and a small professorship in a\r\nSouthern College. It was a straightened life that he had led when\r\nhe came to Washington for the first time as President, scandalizing\r\nthe servants of the White House with the scantness of his personal\r\neffects. There had been neither the time nor the means nor probably\r\nthe energy for larger human contacts. And something inherent always\r\nheld him back from the world, something which diverted him to\r\nacademic life, which when he was writing his \"Congressional\r\nGovernment\", his best book, held him in Baltimore, almost a suburb\r\nof Washington, where he read what he wrote to his fellow-students\r\nat Johns Hopkins, whose livelier curiosity took them often to the\r\ngalleries of the House and the Senate about which he was writing\r\nfrom a distance.\r\n\r\nThose to whom life is kinder than it was during many years to Mr.\r\nWilson have naturally a zest for it. Robuster natures than his even\r\nthough life averts her face, often preserve a zest for it.\r\nConscious of his powers he seems to have fortified himself against\r\nfailure with scorn. He had a scorn for the intellects of those who\r\nsucceed by arts which he did not possess. He had scorn for\r\npoliticians. He had a scorn for wealth. He had a scorn for his\r\nenemies. He had a scorn for Republicans. He had a scorn for the men\r\nwith whom he had to deal in Europe, the heads of the Allied\r\nGovernments.\r\n\r\nAbove all he scorned Lloyd George, an instinct telling him that the\r\nBritish Premier had a thousand arts where he himself, unschooled in\r\nconference with equals, had none. He said of Lloyd George just\r\nbefore he sailed for Paris, suspecting him of treachery to the\r\nLeague of Nations, \"I shall look him in the eye and say to him Damn\r\nyou, if you do not accept the League I shall go to the people of\r\nGreat Britain and say things to them that will shake your\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he made this threat he could not foresee that the compromise\r\nof the Peace would leave him with so little character that British\r\nLiberals, their faith destroyed, should in the end couple his name\r\nwith their own Premier's and exclaim, \"Your man Wilson talks like\r\nJesus Christ, but he acts like Lloyd George!\"\r\n\r\nMore than all others he scorned Lodge. The Massachusetts Senator\r\nwho had put by scholarship for politics and had won the opportunity\r\nto do menial service for a political machine hated the man who had\r\nchosen scholarship, for whatever motive, and come out with the\r\nPresidency. You hate the man you might perhaps have been if you had\r\nchosen more boldly, more according to your heart--if you are like\r\nMr. Lodge.\r\n\r\nA life of demeaning himself to politicians, of waiting for dead\r\nmen's shoes in the Senate, had, however, brought some compensations\r\nto Lodge, among others an inordinate capacity to hurt. The\r\nMassachusetts Senator could get under the President's skin as no\r\nother man could. Washington is a place where every whisper is heard\r\nin the White House.\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge's favorite private charge uttered in a tone of withering\r\nscorn was that the President failed to respond as a man would to\r\nthe national insult offered by Germany in sinking the Lusitania\r\nbecause there was something womanish about him and he would tell,\r\nto prove it, how Wilson went white and almost collapsed over the\r\nnews that blood had been shed through the landing of American\r\nmarines at Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\nThe President hardly failed to hear this. Perhaps it reminded him\r\nof that something in him which he was always trying to forget, that\r\nsomething which diverted his life toward failure at the outset,\r\nwhich once betrayed him, with a strange mixture of the arrogance\r\nand inferiority, into his famous words \"too proud to fight.\"\r\n\r\nAt any rate mutual comprehension and hatred between these two men\r\nwas instinctive, each having the opposite choice in the beginning\r\nand neither in his heart perhaps ever having forgiven himself\r\nwholly for his choice. Mr. Wilson could never get Mr. Lodge wholly\r\nout of his mind in the last two years of his Presidency, a\r\ndisability which prevented him from looking quite calmly and sanely\r\nat public questions.\r\n\r\nThe story of the President's appeal for a Democratic Congress in\r\n1918 which has never been fully told, illustrates the bearing this\r\nLodge obsession had upon Mr. Wilson's later fate. When the\r\nCongressional election was approaching ex-Congressman Scott Ferris,\r\nthen acting as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, went\r\nto the President and told him that there was danger of losing both\r\nhouses of Congress, the lower house not being important, but the\r\nSenate as a factor in foreign relations, Mr. Ferris suggested, was\r\nindispensable to the Democratic party. Mr. Wilson was more hopeful\r\nbut agreed to take under advisement some sort of appeal to the\r\ncountry. It was not desired that this should be anything more than\r\na letter, perhaps to Mr. Ferris, intended for publication, and\r\npointing out the need of support for the President's policies in\r\nthe next Congress.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward Mr. Tumulty, the President's Secretary, brought\r\nto the Shoreham Hotel in Washington an appeal to the country for a\r\nDemocratic Congress and read it to several Democrats gathered there\r\nfor the purpose, including Homer S. Cummings, who, by that time,\r\nhad become acting Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and\r\nwas in charge of the campaign. Mr. Cummings doubted the wisdom of\r\nan appeal, couched in such terms as the one Mr. Tumulty read. He\r\ntook it to Vance McCormick, Chairman of the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, who, because he was Chairman of the War Trade Board, was\r\nnot taking part in the election. Mr. McCormick agreed with Mr.\r\nCummings that the appeal as written would do more harm than good to\r\nthe Democratic party, saying that the war had not been conducted on\r\na partisan basis, that some of his own associates on the War Trade\r\nBoard were Republicans and that Mr. Wilson should ask for the\r\nreelection of all who had been loyal supporters of the war, whether\r\nRepublicans or Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe appeal to the country as it then stood contained a bitter\r\ndenunciation of Senator Lodge. What Wilson chiefly saw in a\r\nRepublican victory was himself at the mercy of the man he hated\r\nworst, the Massachusetts Senator. Mr. McCormick thought that if the\r\nPresident was going to name names he must, at least, denounce\r\nClaude Kitchen, the Democratic leader of the House, as well as\r\nSenator Lodge. If Mr. Wilson would ask for the reelection of those\r\nwho had been loyal, of whatever party, listing the offenders, of\r\nboth parties, including Mr. Lodge if he must, Mr. McCormick\r\nbelieved that the impression on the country would be favorable and\r\nthus a Democratic Congress might be elected.\r\n\r\nBeing agreed, Mr. Cummings and Mr. McCormick went to the White\r\nHouse and argued for a less partisan appeal. All they accomplished\r\nwas the striking of Mr. Lodge's name out of the appeal by\r\nconvincing Mr. Wilson that he could not attack the Republican\r\nSenator while ignoring the worse offenses of Mr. Kitchen and Champ\r\nClark in his own party.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the President made the appeal more purely personal\r\nand more partisan than before. He could not get the Lodge obsession\r\nout of his mind. He could not bring himself to ask for the election\r\nof members of Mr. Lodge's party. The wisdom of Mr. Cummings and Mr.\r\nMcCormick was soon vindicated. The appeal with Mr. Lodge's name out\r\nwas only a shade less impolitic than it would have been with his\r\nname in. It gave Mr. Lodge his majority in the Senate and turned\r\nthe peace into a personal issue between the two \"scholars in\r\npolitics.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time Mr. Wilson had lost his sense of actuality. He could\r\nask the nation for a Congress to his liking as a personal due. He\r\ncould condemn Mr. Lodge as an enemy of those purposes with which we\r\nentered the war, simply because Mr. Lodge could hurt him as no\r\nother man could. The President had been talking for some months to\r\nthe whole world and the whole world had listened with profound\r\nattention. His mission had taken, unconsciously perhaps, a\r\nMessianic character. His enemies were the enemies of God. The\r\nordinary metes and bounds of personality had broken down. The state\r\nof mind revealed in the appeal as originally written was the state\r\nof mind of the Peace Conference and of the fight over the Treaty\r\nand the League which succeeded the Peace Conference. All that\r\nhappened afterwards, including the pitiful personal tragedy, had\r\nbecome inevitable.\r\n\r\nFor a while at Paris amid the triumphs of his European reception\r\nand the successes of the first few months up to the adoption of the\r\nLeague covenant Mr. Wilson forgot Mr. Lodge, forgot him too\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nIt was my fortune to see him at the apex of his career. He was\r\nabout to sail for America on that visit which he made here in the\r\nmidst of the treaty making. His League covenant had just been\r\nagreed to. The world had accepted him. Fate had led him far from\r\nthose paths of defeat and obscurity into which his sensitiveness\r\nand shyness had turned him as a youth. He was elated and confident.\r\nHe looked marvelously fresh and young, his color warm and youthful,\r\nhis eye alive with pleasure.\r\n\r\nHe talked long and well, answered questions freely, told stories of\r\nhis associates at the peace table, especially of one who never read\r\nthe memoranda his secretaries prepared, who was so deaf that he\r\ncould not hear a word spoken in conference and who spoke so loudly\r\nthat no one could interrupt him. \"What could one do,\" Mr. Wilson\r\nasked, \"to penetrate a mind like that?\" M. Clemenceau, who unlike\r\nthis other commissioner, had eyes and saw not, had ears and neither\r\nwould he hear, had said to him once, in response to a firm\r\nnegative, \"You have a heart of steel!\" \"I felt like replying to\r\nhim,\" flashed Mr. Wilson, \"I have not the heart to steal!\"\r\n\r\nSo well poised, so sure of himself he felt that he could do an\r\nextraordinary thing. He could laugh off a mistake. Robuster natures\r\naccept mistakes as a child accepts tumbles. Mistakes for Mr. Wilson\r\nwere ordinarily crises for his arrogancy.\r\n\r\nYou may judge, then, how confident he was at that supreme moment.\r\nHe could brush aside a great mistake lightly. Someone asked him,\r\n\"What about the freedom of the seas?\"\r\n\r\n\"The freedom of the seas!\" he answered, \"I must tell you about\r\nthat. It's a great joke on me. I left America thinking the freedom\r\nof the seas the most important issue of the Peace Conference. When\r\nI got here I found there was no such issue. You see the freedom of\r\nthe seas concerns neutrals in time of war. But when we have the\r\nLeague of Nations there will be no neutrals in time of war. So, of\r\ncourse, there will be no question of the freedom of the seas. I\r\nhadn't thought the thing out clearly.\"\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the decline began. Mr. Wilson had unwisely chosen\r\nto have his victory first and his defeats afterward, always bad\r\ngeneralship.\r\n\r\nCompromise followed compromise, each one destructive. The fourteen\r\npoints were impaired until Mr. Wilson hated to be reminded of them\r\nby Lloyd George, in the case of Dantzig and the Polish corridor.\r\nThe dawn of a better world grew dubious. The ardor of mankind\r\ncooled. They were at first incredulous, then skeptical.\r\n\r\nThe President saw only slowly the consequences of that chaffering\r\nto which Mr. Lloyd George and M. Clemenceau led him. He was a poor\r\nmerchant. He dealt in morals and could cast up no daily balance. He\r\nwas busy with details for which his mind had no sufficient\r\ncuriosity or energy. Mr. Keynes, in his remarkable description of\r\nMr. Wilson making peace, says that his mind was slow.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it was slow in political trading about the council table,\r\njust as a philosopher may be slow in the small talk of a five\r\no'clock tea.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson was out of his element in the conference; Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge and M. Clemenceau were in theirs. Gradually the conviction\r\nentered Mr. Wilson's soul that what was being destroyed at Paris\r\nwas Mr. Wilson. The figure of Senator Lodge began to rise across\r\nthe Atlantic, malevolent and evil, the Lodge against whom he had\r\nwanted to appeal to the American people.\r\n\r\nThe strain was telling upon him. He had to sit beside his\r\ndestroyers with that smiling amiability which Mr. Lansing records\r\nin his book. He had to deal with men on a basis of equality, a\r\nthing which he had run away from doing in his youth, which all his\r\nlife had made too great demands upon his sensitive, arrogant\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nOne whose duty it was to see him every night after the meetings of\r\nthe Big Three reports that he found him with the left side of his\r\nface twitching. To collect his memory he would pass his hand\r\nseveral times wearily over his brow. The arduousness of the labor\r\nwas not great enough to account for this. M. Clemenceau at nearly\r\neighty stood the strain and an assassin's bullet as well. Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge thrived on what he did. But the issue was not personal with\r\nthem. Neither was assisting, with difficult amiability, at his own\r\ndestruction. The time came when he might have had back some of the\r\nground he had given. Mr. Lloyd George offered it to him. He would\r\nnot have it. What it was proposed to amend was not so much the\r\npeace treaty as Mr. Wilson himself, and he could not admit that he\r\nneeded amendment.\r\n\r\nThe issue had become personal and Mr. Lodge, upon Mr. Wilson's\r\nreturn, with malevolent understanding, kept it personal. The\r\nRepublicans made their fight in the one way that made yielding by\r\nthe President impossible. They made it nominally on the League but\r\nreally on Mr. Wilson. The President might have compromised on the\r\nLeague, but he could not compromise on Mr. Wilson. Of such\r\ninvolvement in self there could be only one end.\r\n\r\nLike a poet of one poem, Mr. Wilson is a statesman of one vision,\r\nan inspiring vision, but one which his own weakness kept him from\r\nrealizing. His domestic achievements are not remarkable, his\r\nadministration being one in which movements came to a head rather\r\nthan one in which much was initiated. He might have cut the war\r\nshort by two years and saved the world much havoc, if he had begun\r\nto fight when the Lusitania was sunk. Once in the war he saw his\r\ncountry small and himself large; he did not conceive of the nation\r\nas winning the war by sending millions of men to France; he saw\r\nhimself as winning the war by talking across the Atlantic. At the\r\nPeace Conference he did not conceive of his country's winning the\r\npeace by the powerful position in which victory had left it; he saw\r\nhimself as winning the peace by the hold he personally had upon the\r\npeoples of Europe. Like Napoleon, of whom Marshal Foch wrote\r\nrecently, \"Il oublia qu'un homme ne peut etre Dieu; qu'au-dessus de\r\nl' individu, il y a la nation,\" he forgot that man can not be God;\r\nthat over and above the individual there is the nation.\r\n\r\nIn politics he knew at first better than any other, again to quote\r\nFoch, that \"above men is morality.\" This knowledge brought him many\r\nvictories. But at critical junctures, as in his 1918 appeal to the\r\nvoters and in the treaty fight, he forgot that morality was above\r\none man, himself. He excelled in appeals to the heart and\r\nconscience of the nation, a gift Mr. Harding has not; the lesser\r\narts of the politician, tact and skill in the handling and\r\nselecting of men, were lacking.\r\n\r\nHe forgot in his greatness and aloofness the national passion for\r\nequality; which a more brilliant politician, Mr. Roosevelt,\r\nappeased by acting as the people's court jester, and which a\r\nshrewder politician, Mr. Harding, guards against by reminding the\r\ncountry that he is \"just folks\"; and in the end the masses turned\r\nupon him, like a Roman mob on a defeated gladiator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE HARVEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something inscrutably ludicrous in the anxiety, bordering\r\nupon consternation, that lurks in the elongated and grotesque\r\nshadow that George Harvey casts upon Washington. The Republican\r\nfathers, who now feel a sense of responsibility, after a lapse of\r\nmany years, for the future of party and country, do not yet know\r\nhow to take him.\r\n\r\nAs a campaign asset his value could be expressed in intelligible\r\nterms. But as a party liability, or asset,--many a good Republican\r\nwishes he knew which,--he remains an enigma. There is not one of\r\nthe array of elders of either political persuasion who, while\r\nlaughing at his satirical sword-play, does not watch him covertly\r\nout of the corner of the eye, trembling at the potential ruin they\r\nconsider him capable of accomplishing.\r\n\r\nWith all his weaknesses,--principally an almost hilarious political\r\nirregularity,--but two Republican hands were raised against him in\r\nthe Senate when he was nominated for the Court of Saint James. When\r\nhe rather unbecomingly filliped John Bull on the nose in his maiden\r\nspeech as the premier ambassador, incidentally ridiculing some of\r\nhis own countrymen's war ideals, President Harding and Secretary\r\nHughes, gravely and with rather obvious emphasis, tried to set the\r\nmatter aright as best they could. But there was no hint of\r\nreprimand; only a fervent hope that the mercurial Harvey would\r\nremain quiescent until the memory of the episode passed.\r\n\r\nThe quondam editor, now the representative of his country on the\r\nSupreme Council, in which capacity he is even more important than\r\nas Ambassador, represents a new strain in American politics. His\r\nmental habits bewilder the President, shock the proper and somewhat\r\nconventional Secretary of State, and throw such repositories of\r\nnational divinity as Senators Lodge and Knox into utter confusion.\r\n\r\nHarvey plays the game of politics according to his own rules, the\r\nunderlying principle of which is audacity. He knows very well that\r\nthe weak spot in the armor of nearly all politicians of the old\r\nschool is their assumption of superiority, a sort of mask of\r\nbenignant political venerability. They dread satire. They shrink\r\nfrom ridicule. A well-directed critical outburst freezes them.\r\nSuch has been the Harvey method of approach. Having reduced his\r\nsubjects to a state of terror, he flatters them, cajoles them, and\r\nfinally makes terms with them; but he always remains a more or less\r\nunstable and uncertain quantity, potentially explosive.\r\n\r\nThere is not much of the present Harvey to be gleaned from his\r\nearlier experiences, except the pertinacity that has had much to do\r\nwith his irregular climb up the ladder. He was born in Peacham,\r\nVermont, where as a boy after school hours he mounted a stool in\r\nhis father's general store and kept books. At the end of the year\r\nhis accounts were short a penny. Because of this he received no\r\nChristmas gift not, as he has said, because his father begrudged\r\nthe copper more than any other Vermont storekeeper, but because he\r\nwas meticulously careful himself and expected the younger\r\ngeneration to be likewise.\r\n\r\nThis experience must have been etched upon Harvey's memory; no one\r\ncan be more meticulous when his interest is aroused. To money he is\r\nindifferent, but a misplaced word makes him shudder. Writing with\r\nhim is an exhausting process, which probably accounts for the fact\r\nthat his literary output has been small. But the same power of\r\nanalysis and attention to detail have been most effective in his\r\npolitical activities. In these his divination has been prophetic\r\nand in his manipulation of contending elements he shows a dexterity\r\nthat has baffled even the professional politicians.\r\n\r\nHarvey began his journalistic career upon the Peacham Patriot.\r\nThence, with a borrowed ten dollar bill, he went to Springfield,\r\nserving his apprenticeship on the Republican, the best school of\r\njournalism in the country at that time. Later, on the Chicago\r\nEvening News, on the staff of which were Victor Lawson, Eugene\r\nField, and Melville Stone, he completed his training.\r\n\r\nWhen he joined the staff of the New York World at the age of\r\ntwenty-one he was a competent, if not a brilliant newspaper man.\r\nHis first important billet was the New Jersey editorship. This\r\nassignment across the river might very easily have been the first\r\nstep toward a journalistic sepulcher, but not for Harvey. He made\r\nuse of the post to garner an experience and knowledge of New Jersey\r\npolitics that were to have an important bearing upon the career of\r\nWoodrow Wilson later. At the same time he attracted the attention\r\nof Joseph Pulitzer who appointed him managing editor of the World\r\nbefore he was thirty.\r\n\r\nWhile directing the World's policy during the second Cleveland\r\ncampaign, Harvey met Thomas F. Ryan and William C. Whitney, the\r\nfinancial backers of the Democratic party. This prepared the way\r\nfor his step from Park Row to Wall Street after his break with\r\nPulitzer.\r\n\r\nBut the ways of Wall Street were not for Harvey. Nevertheless he\r\nwas cautious enough to help himself to some of the profits that\r\nwere forthcoming in those days of great amalgamations. With\r\ncommendable foresight, however much he might have despised the\r\nmethods then prevalent in the fields of high finance, he acquired\r\nenough to make him independent, to follow his own bent, and\r\nstrangely enough, in the acquiring he came to the conclusion that\r\nthe Republic could not survive if the plundering of the people by\r\nthe \"interests\" continued as it was proceeding at that time.\r\n\r\nHe withdrew from the Street and eventually purchased The North\r\nAmerican Review. In the meantime J. P. Morgan and Company had\r\nunderwritten the bonds of the Harper publishing house and the elder\r\nMorgan asked Harvey to take charge of the institution. This he\r\nagreed to do with the understanding that he should be permitted to\r\ndirect the policy of Harper's Weekly, one of the assets of the\r\nfirm, without interference from the bankers.\r\n\r\nWith his peculiar faculty for detecting the weaknesses of\r\nfinanciers and politicians, Harvey now had before him an\r\nopportunity which was not afforded by the sedate old North American\r\nReview and he promptly took advantage of it. He had seen enough of\r\nthe union of finance and politics to place little faith in either\r\nof the old parties. One was corrupt and powerful; the other was\r\nweak and parasitical. In both organizations money was a compelling\r\nconsideration. Not being accustomed to think in terms of party\r\nallegiance Harvey decided that the only remedy for a very bad\r\nsituation was a militant Democracy. He had the organ; next he\r\nneeded the leader.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, quite accidentally, he was present at Woodrow\r\nWilson's inauguration as president of Princeton University. The\r\nprofessor appealed to the editor,--why, one can only conjecture.\r\nPerhaps it was a common abhorrence of machine politics, a passion\r\nfor phrase turning, for there is a similarity in the methods of the\r\ntwo which separates them from the rank and file of ordinary\r\npoliticians. Harvey scrutinized Wilson more carefully, making a\r\npolitical diagnosis by a careful examination of his works, and\r\ndecided that he was the man to turn the trick.\r\n\r\nBut the gap between the presidency of Princeton and the Presidency\r\nof the United States was too wide to be taken at one leap. Harvey\r\nconcluded that the governorship of New Jersey must be the\r\nintermediate step. The Democratic year of 1910 provided the\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey politicians did not care about the college\r\nprofessor. They had already chosen a candidate, but Harvey induced\r\nthem to change their minds. How this was accomplished is an\r\nabsorbing political tale, too long to be narrated here. The New\r\nJersey political leaders of that period will tell you that if Mr.\r\nWilson's \"forward-looking\" men had controlled the convention he\r\nnever would have been nominated. They will also tell you how Joseph\r\nPatrick Tumulty opposed the nomination. They will even whisper that\r\nthe contests were settled rather rapidly that memorable evening.\r\nAfter the nomination was announced, Mr. Wilson's managers escorted\r\nhim to the convention hall where he addressed a group of delegates\r\nwho were none too enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nAs they motored back to the hotel Mr. Wilson is reported to have\r\nasked: \"By the way, gentleman, what was my majority?\"\r\n\r\nTo which Mr. Nugent replied cryptically: \"It was enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe question, at least in the presence of these gentlemen, it is\r\nsaid was never asked again.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about the break between Mr. Harvey and Mr.\r\nWilson. The published correspondence gives a fairly accurate\r\npicture of what happened at the Manhattan Club on the morning of\r\nthe parting. I do not believe that Mr. Wilson dropped Colonel\r\nHarvey because he feared he was under Wall Street influence. The\r\nHarvey version sounds more plausible. According to this the\r\nerstwhile university professor had learned the technique of\r\npolitical strategy. He no longer felt that he was in need of\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\n\"I was not surprised at the excuse he gave a little later when the\r\nbreak came,\" said Harvey. \"I would not have been surprised at any\r\nexcuse he offered.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey retired from the campaign. Harper's Weekly had been\r\nwrecked, whether or not by the espousal of the Wilson cause, and he\r\nsold it to Norman Hapgood who buried it in due course. George\r\nHarvey might or might not have had visions of an appointment to the\r\nCourt of St. James at that time. It is at least certain that his\r\ndisappointment was keen, taking a form of vindictiveness which will\r\nsurvive as a distinct blot upon his career. In the preconvention\r\ncampaign he aligned himself with the Champ Clark forces, but it was\r\ntoo late to undo the work he had done.\r\n\r\nThis episode is necessary to an understanding of what happened\r\nlater. His transfer from the Democratic to the Republican party was\r\na characteristically bold move. How genuine his later allegiance\r\nmay be is a question which more than one Republican would like to\r\nhave answered, but there is no doubt of the success of his coup. He\r\nis, at least where he wanted to be, occupying the post which he\r\nconsiders, in point of importance, next to the presidency itself,\r\nMr. Hughes notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States entered the war Harvey found himself in the\r\nsecluded position of editor of the North American Review. This did\r\nnot suit his disposition at all and he was very unhappy. He was too\r\nold to fight and it was not likely that he would be invited to\r\nWashington. In the meantime stories of mismanagement in the conduct\r\nof the war began to trickle out of the capital in devious\r\nundercurrents. The press, in a passive spirit of patriotism, was\r\nsilent. Here was the opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1918, the first edition of the \"North American Review\r\nWar Weekly\" appeared. Its editor announced that its purpose was to\r\nhelp win the war by telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing\r\nbut the truth. He defied the Creels, the Daniels, and the\r\nBurlesons, adopting the motto, \"To hell with the censors and\r\nbureaucrats.\"\r\n\r\nThe journal was an instant success. Not only was it read with\r\navidity but the Washington politicians were flabbergasted at the\r\naudacity of a man who dared to print what the press associations\r\nand the dailies would not touch. I do not think there can be any\r\ndoubt of the genuineness of Harvey's motives at this time. His\r\njournal was rigidly non-partisan. He spared no one whom he\r\nconsidered as an encumbrance in the winning of the war.\r\n\r\nThe most striking evidence of his attitude toward the Republican\r\nparty at this time is found in the edition of the \"Weekly\" of March\r\n9, 1918. Will H. Hays had just been elected chairman of the\r\nRepublican National Committee. He made a speech extolling the\r\nvirtues of his party. Of this Harvey made a stinging analysis\r\ndenouncing Hays for invoking partisan spirit at so perilous an\r\nhour, concluding with this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"As for Mr. Hays, with his insufferable claptrap about absolute\r\nunity as a blanket under which to gather votes while the very\r\nexistence of the nation is threatened more ominously than anybody\r\nwest of the Alleghanies--or in Washington, for that matter,--seems\r\nto realize, the sooner he goes home and takes his damned old party\r\nwith him, the better it will be for all creation.\"\r\n\r\nSurely no uncertain language! One might have supposed that the\r\nChairman of the Republican Committee would have done nothing of the\r\nkind, but he did. Again the Harvey method was effective. Hays\r\ninstead of resenting the denunciation wrote Harvey a rather abject\r\nletter, expressing the fear that he might have made a mistake in\r\ndiscussing politics during the war and asked for an interview.\r\n\r\nHere another Harvey characteristic came into play. He did not\r\nassume the lofty role of mentor or prophet; he very tactfully and\r\ngently tucked the young Indianian under his wing. Thenceforth there\r\nwere no more oratorical blunders.\r\n\r\nMr. Hays began to exhibit some capacity for leadership; his\r\nspeeches improved. From that day until the election of 1920 he\r\nnever made one without George Harvey's counsel and approval.\r\n\r\nThis is as typical of Harvey as his audacity. He has a gentleness\r\nand charm quite unexpected in so savage a commentator. He will\r\ndiscuss and advise but he will not argue; and all of the time he\r\nwill probe with uncanny accuracy for the weaknesses of those with\r\nwhom he is dealing. It is rather by the weaknesses of others than\r\nby his own strength that he triumphs.\r\n\r\nEight months after his meeting with Hays, Harvey came to Washington\r\nwhere his shadow was cast over the destinies of the Republican\r\nparty, which at that time consisted of a dozen elements with little\r\nin common except a hatred of Woodrow Wilson.\r\n\r\nIt was an ideal situation for the exercise of Harvey's peculiar\r\ntalents. He met various factional leaders and before many weeks his\r\nhouse became their rendezvous, the G. H. Q. of the forces who were\r\nto encompass the defeat of Wilson. Harvey flattered and cajoled and\r\ncounselled, enjoying himself immensely all of the time. This\r\ndiversion was much more to his liking than the academic dignity of\r\nthe editorship of the \"North American Review\".\r\n\r\nWhen President Wilson sailed away on his disastrous mission to\r\nParis, Harvey's \"Weekly\" threw aside all restraint. It cut and\r\nslashed indiscriminately the President's policies. For the first\r\ntime Harvey took on the guise of a Republican among Republicans. He\r\neven aided and abetted, with amused cynicism, the groping and\r\nfumbling of Republican leaders who were dazzled at the sudden break\r\nin the political clouds which had so long enshrouded them. He\r\nhelped raise the funds used to counteract the league propaganda and\r\ntoured the country in opposition to it.\r\n\r\nThe next shift in scenes was as much beyond Mr. Harvey's power of\r\nmanipulation as it was beyond most of the Republicans who now\r\nsagaciously give the impression that their hands were on the ropes.\r\nStories have been told of the great part Mr. Harvey played in the\r\nnomination of Mr. Harding. Mr. Harvey did not go to Chicago with\r\nthe intention of supporting Mr. Harding any more than any other of\r\nthe candidates, except Wood and Hiram Johnson, whom he despised.\r\n\r\nHe and the Senate oligarchy that coyly took the credit for\r\nnominating Mr. Harding turned to him when it was manifest that the\r\nmachinery was stalled. Mr. Harding owes his nomination to a mob of\r\nbewildered delegates. It was not due to a wisely conceived nor\r\nbrilliantly executed plan.\r\n\r\nI doubt very much that George Harvey and President Harding had much\r\nin common until Harvey was invited to Marion. At that time the\r\n\"irreconcilables\" were beginning to be afraid that Elihu Root and\r\nWilliam H. Taft were about to induce Mr. Harding to accept a\r\ncompromise on the League of Nations. Harvey served the purpose of\r\nrestoring the equilibrium. At the same time it is quite probable\r\nthat the President was impressed by a mind so much more agile than\r\nhis own. It was reasonably certain that it would not be diverted or\r\nmisled by the intricacies of European diplomacy. And there was\r\nnever any doubt of Harvey's Americanism.\r\n\r\nThe President's selection of Mr. Harvey for the London post is, of\r\ncourse, accounted for in other ways. There are some persons who\r\nprofess to believe that Mr. Harding preferred to have the militant\r\neditor in London and his \"Weekly\" in the grave rather than to have\r\nhim as a censor of Washington activities under the new regime. It\r\ncan be said definitely that a sigh of relief went up from many a\r\nRepublican bosom when the sacrilegious journal was brought to a\r\ntimely end. And this did not happen, it is to be observed, until\r\nthe nomination of George Harvey to the Court of St. James was duly\r\nratified and approved by the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut if the \"Weekly\" has passed, the Republicans are still acutely\r\nconscious that Mr. Harvey is alive,--has he not reminded them of it\r\nin his first ambassadorial utterances?--and the journal is not\r\nbeyond resuscitation. That is why Washington does not know whether\r\nto be chagrined or angry, whether to disavow or to condone. The\r\ndiscomfited Republicans frankly do not know what to think of it and\r\nprobably will not so long as the amazing ambassador makes his own\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES EVANS HUGHES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mais resiste-t-on a' la vertu? Les gens qui n'eurent point de\r\nfaiblesses sont terribles,\" observed Sylvestre Bonnard of the\r\nredoubtable Therese.\r\n\r\nThis fearsomeness of the good is an old story. Horace remarked it,\r\nwhen, walking about near Rome, pure of heart and free from sin, he\r\nmet a wolf. The beast quailed before his virtue and ran away,--to\r\nbark at the statue of the she wolf giving suck to Romulus, by way\r\nof intelligent protest.\r\n\r\nA similar prevalence of virtue and a similar romantic quality,\r\nwhere it is least to be expected, was disclosed in a recent\r\nencounter between Charles Evans Hughes, Secretary of State, and one\r\nof the irreconcilables, when Mr. Hughes, integer vitae scelerisque\r\npurus had just commissioned Colonel George Harvey to take the seat\r\nonce occupied by Woodrow Wilson in the Supreme Council.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this appointment reached the Capitol, Senator\r\nBrandegee, of Connecticut, hurried down to that structure across\r\nthe street from the White House whose architectural style so\r\nmarkedly resembles the literary style of President Harding, the\r\nState War and Navy Building, official residence of Mr. Hughes.\r\n\r\nHarvey being, in a sort, Brandegee's ambassador to the Court of\r\nSaint James, the Senator's object was to tell Mr. Hughes what\r\nHarvey should do in the Supreme Council. Mr. Brandegee has the gift\r\nof direct and forceful speech. In his earnestness, he dispenses\r\nwith the elegancies and amenities. The upper ranges of his voice\r\nare not conciliatory.\r\n\r\nIn this tone, he developed views regarding this country's foreign\r\nrelations with which Mr. Hughes could not agree. The Secretary of\r\nState combatted the Senator from Connecticut precisely as he\r\ncombats counsel of the other side when a $500,000 fee is at stake.\r\nThe discussion was energetic and divergent.\r\n\r\nMr. Brandegee hurried back to the Capitol and summoned other\r\nsenators to his office, all those who were especially concerned\r\nabout the exposure of Colonel Harvey to European entanglements.\r\n\r\nHe was excited. His voice was nasal. His language, in that select\r\ngathering, did not have to be parliamentary. He told the senators\r\nthat they could expect the Versailles treaty by the next White\r\nHouse messenger; that \"that whiskered,\"--but nothing lies like\r\ndirect quotes,--that \"that whiskered\" Secretary of State would soon\r\nget us into the League of Nations, being able for his purposes to\r\nwind President Harding about his little finger!\r\n\r\nHis excitement in such an emergency naturally communicated itself\r\nto his hearers. What to do? It was unanimously decided that the\r\nonly adequate course was for Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to resign as\r\nChairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, by way of\r\nprotest.\r\n\r\nHenry Cabot Lodge running away from his chairmanship would be Henry\r\nCabot Lodge behaving as romantically as Horace's wolf. The good are\r\nterrible, as Anatole France said in the words with which this\r\nsketch begins. It is not so much that you can not resist them, as\r\nthat they lead you to make such fools of yourselves.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes prevails, however, not merely by his virtue, but by his\r\nintelligence. His is the best mind in Washington; to this everyone\r\nagrees, and it is not excessive praise, for minds are not common in\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding has not a remarkable one, the people having decided by\r\nseven million majority that it was best not to have one in the\r\nWhite House, choosing instead, a good heart, excellent intentions,\r\nand reasonable common sense. Mr. Hoover has a fine business\r\ninstinct, great but diffused mental energy, but hardly an organized\r\nmind. From this point the Cabinet grades down to the Secretary of\r\nLabor, who, when Samuel Gompers, Jr., his Chief Clerk, addressed\r\nhim before visitors as, \"Mr. Secretary,\" said, \"Please don't call\r\nme, 'Mr. Secretary,' Sam. Call me, 'Jim.' I'm more used to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call me Jim\" is the mental sea level of the Administration, by\r\nwhich altitudes are measured, so let us not exalt Mr. Hughes' mind\r\nunduly, but merely indicate what its habits are. Its operations\r\nwere described to me by a member of the Cabinet, who said that no\r\nmatter what subject was up for discussion at a Cabinet meeting, it\r\nwas always the Secretary of State who said the final convincing\r\nword about it, summing it all up, saying what everyone else had\r\nbeen trying to say but no one else had entirely succeeded in\r\nsaying, simplifying it, and all with an air of service, not of\r\nself-assertion.\r\n\r\nMr. Harding, speaking to an intimate friend, said he had \"two\r\nstrong advisers,--Hughes and Hoover.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a satisfaction, even though it is not a delight, to come in\r\ncontact with a mind like Mr. Hughes'; it is so definite, so hard\r\nand firm and palpable. You feel sure that it rests somewhere on the\r\neternal verities. It is never agnostic. It has none of the malaise\r\nof the twentieth century. Mr. Justice Brandeis, when Mr. Hughes was\r\ngovernor of New York and a reformer and progressive, said of him,\r\n\"His is the most enlightened mind of the eighteenth century.\"\r\n\r\nI think the Justice put it a century or two too late, for by the\r\neighteenth century skepticism had begun to undermine those firm\r\nfoundations of belief which Mr. Hughes still possesses. For him a\r\nstraight line is the shortest distance between two points,--Einstein\r\nto the contrary, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nConclusions rest upon the absolute rock of principle, as morality\r\nfor his preacher father rested upon the absolute rock of the Ten\r\nCommandments. There is no doubt, no uncertainty, no nuance, no on\r\nthe one hand, on the other, no discursiveness, no yielding to the\r\nseductions of fancy, but a stern keeping of the faith of the\r\nsyllogism; a thing is so or it is not so. Mr. Hughes never\r\nhesitates. He never says, \"I must think about that.\" He has thought\r\nabout it. Or he turns instantly to his Principle and has the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nYou speak of Mr. Hughes to ten men in the Capitol, and nine of them\r\nwill say to you, \"Of course it is easy to understand; his is the\r\none real mind in Washington.\"\r\n\r\nEveryone is impressed, for, starting with no other initiation into\r\nthe mysteries of foreign relations than having had a father born in\r\nWales and having spent his vacations in England, probably in the\r\nlake region studying the topography of Wordsworth's poetry,--a\r\ncertain oft detected resemblance to Wilson must make Wordsworth his\r\nfavorite poet, as he was Wilson's,--in ten days was he not a great\r\nSecretary of State; and in three months the greatest Secretary of\r\nState? To be sure, back of him was the strongest nation on the\r\nearth, left so by the war, the one nation with resources, the\r\ncreditor of all the others, to which a successful foreign policy\r\nwould be naturally easy if it could only decide what that policy\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\nIt was left to Mr. Hughes to say what it should be. His discovery\r\nof the word \"interests,\" amazed Washington; it was so obvious, so\r\nsimple that no one else had thought of it. Mr. Hughes' mind works\r\nlike that;--hard, cold, unemotional, not to be turned aside, it\r\nsimplifies everything, whether it be a treaty fight that has\r\nconfused everyone else in the land, or a rambling Cabinet\r\ndiscussion; whether it be the mess in which the war left Europe, or\r\nthe chaos in which watchful waiting left Mexico. His is a mind that\r\ndelights in formulae. He has one for Europe. He has one for Mexico.\r\nIt is an analytical, not a synthetical mind, a lawyer's mind, not a\r\ncreator's, like Wilson's, with, perhaps it may turn out, a fatal\r\nhabit of over-simplification. Life is not a simple thing after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBut effective simplification is instantly overwhelming; and he made\r\nhis brief announcement, a few days after taking office, that the\r\nUnited States had won certain things as a belligerent, that it had\r\nnot got them, that he was going after them, that other countries\r\ncould expect nothing from us until they had recognized our rights\r\nand our interests; he had completely routed the Senate, which had\r\nbeen opposing Wilson's ideals with certain ideals of its own,\r\npitting Washington's farewell address against \"breaking the heart\r\nof the world,\" in a mussy statement of sentimentality.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes talked of islands and oil and dollars; and the country\r\ncame to its senses. Mr. Wilson had pictured us going into world\r\naffairs as an international benefactor; it was sobby and suggested\r\na strain on our pocketbooks. The Senate had pictured us staying out\r\nof them because our fathers had warned us to stay out and because\r\nthe international confidence men would cheat us; it was\r\nSunday-school-booky and unflattering. Mr. Hughes said we should go\r\nin to the extent of obtaining what was ours, and that we should stay\r\nout to the extent of keeping the others from obtaining what certainly\r\nwas not theirs. It sounded grown-up; as a Nation we belonged not to\r\nthe sob-sisterhood, neither were we tied to the apronstring of the\r\nMothers of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOur national self-respect was restored. Truly, it required a mind\r\nto discover \"interests\" in the cloud of words that Mr. Wilson and\r\nthe Senate had raised. Of course, it is all clear now, when\r\neverybody scorns idealism and talks glibly of interests. \"Hobbs\r\nhints blue, straight he turtle eats; Nobbs prints blue, claret\r\ncrowns his cup.\" But it was Hughes who \"fished the murex up,\" who\r\npulled \"interests\" out of the deep blue sea of verbal fuddlement.\r\n\r\nAnd thinking of our dollars, thanks to Mr. Hughes, we are made sane\r\nand whole, clearsighted and unafraid, standing erect among the\r\nnations of the earth asking lustily for Yap.\r\n\r\nOur foreign relations had been the subject of passion. Mr. Hughes\r\nmade them the subject of reason. Mr. Wilson could think of nothing\r\nbut his hatred of Lodge, which rendered an agreement with the\r\nSenate impossible, and his hatred of Lloyd George and Marshal Foch,\r\nwhich rendered cooperation with the Allies and through it\r\nachievements in the foreign field that would have reconciled the\r\npublic to his policies, equally impossible.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes looked at his task objectively. He saw the power of the\r\nUnited States. He saw how easy it was to exert that power\r\ndiplomatically. He saw the simple and immediate concerns of the\r\nUnited States. Foch says that he won the war, \"by smoking his\r\npipe,\" meaning by keeping cool and regarding his means and ends\r\nwith the same detachment with which he would study an old campaign\r\nof Napoleon. I do not know on what sedative Mr. Hughes wins his\r\ndiplomatic victories, as he does not smoke a pipe;--perhaps by\r\nreading the Sunday School Times. But like the French Marshal, he\r\nknows the secret of keeping his head. It is a great quality of mind\r\nnot to lose it when you most need it. Mr. Hughes has it. Perhaps\r\nthis is why Washington remarks his mind; he always has it with him.\r\n\r\n\"I am not thinking of myself in my work here,\" he said once. \"I\r\ndon't care about immediate acclaim. I am counsel for the people of\r\nthis country. If a generation from now they think their interests\r\nhave been well represented, that will be enough.\"\r\n\r\nHe is coldly objective.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes comes by his coolness naturally. He was born to it,\r\nwhich is the surest way to come by anything. Men have hated him for\r\nit, coolness being a disconcerting quality, ever since he emerged\r\nfrom obscurity in New York during the insurance investigation,\r\ncalling it his \"coldness\" and adding by way of good measure the\r\nfurther specification, his \"selfishness.\"\r\n\r\nIf the last characterization is to stand, it should be amended to\r\nread, his \"enlightened selfishness.\" He has a good eye for his own\r\ninterests. Roosevelt disliked him for it, because when governor and\r\nagain when candidate for president, he refused to gravitate into\r\nthe Roosevelt solar system, taking up his orbit like the rest of\r\nthem about the Colonel. But think what happened to that system when\r\nthe great sun of it went out!\r\n\r\nHis political associates in New York hated him, accused him of\r\nbeing \"for nothing but Hughes,\" when he quit them in the fight \"to\r\nhand the government back to the people\" and went, on the invitation\r\nof President Taft, upon the Supreme Bench. But it was his only way\r\nout. If he had gone on working with them, he would still be\r\n\"handing the government back to the people\" along with,--but who\r\nwere the great figures of 1910? He knows an expiring issue and its\r\nembarrassments by an unerring instinct. He finds a new one, such as\r\n\"our national interests,\" with as sure a sense.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while casting a glance at him \"smoking his pipe,\" when\r\nother real and false opportunities presented themselves to him; one\r\nfinds discrimination. He refuses a Republican nomination for Mayor\r\nof New York City when there is not a chance of electing a\r\nRepublican Mayor of New York City. He accepts a Republican\r\nnomination for Governor of New York State, when the putting up of\r\nHearst as the Democratic candidate makes the election of a\r\nRepublican as Governor of New York State morally certain. He\r\nrefuses the Republican nomination for President, in 1912, when\r\nanother, viewing himself and his party less objectively, through\r\nvanity perhaps, might have believed that his own nomination was the\r\none thing needed to prevent that year's Republican cataclysm. Four\r\nyears later he accepts the Republican nomination for President,\r\nwhen as the result showed, there is at least a reasonable chance to\r\nwin. He takes the post of Secretary of State when neglected\r\nopportunities lie ready to his hand and when the force of world\r\nevents requires little more than his intelligent acquiescence to\r\nbring him diplomatic success.\r\n\r\nHis discovery of \"interests\" was no accident. It sprang from that\r\nhard unemotional simplifying habit of his mind.\r\n\r\nWhen one writes of Mr. Hughes, men ask, pardonably, \"Which Mr.\r\nHughes? The old Mr. Hughes, or the new Mr. Hughes?\" for he has had,\r\nas the literary critics would say, his earlier and his later\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nBut it is chiefly manner, a smile recently achieved, a different\r\nway of wearing the beard, a little less of the stern moralist, a\r\nlittle more of the man of the world. A connoisseur of Hughes, who\r\nhas studied him for nearly twenty years, after a recent\r\nobservation, pronounced judgment: \"It's the same Hughes, a trifle\r\nless cold, but just as dry.\" And the Secretary of State himself,\r\nwhen one of the weeklies contained an article on \"The New Mr.\r\nHughes,\" remarked, \"People did not understand me then, that is\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nThese two eminent authorities being substantially agreed for the\r\nfirst time during many divergent years, there must be something in\r\nit. Mr. Hughes must be a gradually emerging personality. You take\r\nthat new warmth, recently detected; Mr. Hughes himself knows it was\r\nalways there. It is like the light ray of a star which has needed a\r\nmillion years to reach the earth; it was always there but it\r\nrequired a long time to get across.\r\n\r\nThen the beard:--when Mr. Hughes was \"handing the government back\r\nto the people\" in New York, it was a preacher's beard; you might\r\nhave encountered its like anywhere among the circuit riders. Now it\r\nis a foreign secretary's beard; you might encounter it in any\r\nEuropean capital,--a world statesman's beard. The change of beard\r\nreveals the smile, which was probably always there, and the\r\nsplendid large teeth. The nose, standing out in bolder relief, is\r\nhandsomer and more distinguished. You see more of Mr. Hughes than\r\nyou used to and you gain by the improved vision.\r\n\r\nSomething has dropped from him, however, beside the ends of the\r\nwhiskers. I met him first when he was about to run for President in\r\n1916. An icy veil, like frozen mist, seemed to hang between us. We\r\ntalked through it ineffectively. When I saw him again as Secretary\r\nof State, that chill barrier had fallen away; to recur to my\r\nfigure, he gradually emerges.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes of the later manner is, however, I am persuaded after\r\nlong familiarity with his career, more truly Hughesian than the\r\nHughes of the earlier manner; just as the Henry James of the later\r\nmanner is more explicitly Jamesian than the James of the earlier\r\nmanner, and the Cabot Lodge of the present is much more\r\nirretrievably Cabotian than the Cabot Lodge who years ago stood\r\nwith reluctant feet where the twin paths of scholarship and\r\npolitics meet,--and part.\r\n\r\nI should say that Mr. Hughes was Bryan plus the advantages, which\r\nMr. Bryan never enjoyed, of a correct Republican upbringing and a\r\nmind. The Republican upbringing and the mind have come of late\r\nyears to preponderate. Looking at Mr. Hughes to-day, you could not\r\ntell him from a Republican, except perhaps by his mind, though such\r\nesoteric Republicans as Brandegee, Cabot Lodge, and Knox profess an\r\nability to distinguish.\r\n\r\nBut when he was \"handing the government back to the people\" in New\r\nYork, there was too much Bryan about him. The Republicans would\r\nhave none of him, except as a choice of evils,--the greater evil\r\nbeing defeat. They called him ribald names. They referred to him\r\nscornfully as \"Wilson with whiskers,\" when they ran him,\r\nreluctantly, for the Presidency in 1916. His opponent being also of\r\nthe Bryan school, and a minister's son at that, Hughes striving for\r\nan issue, failed to make it clear which was which, a doubt that\r\nremained until the last vote from California was finally counted\r\nafter the election. This was the Mr. Hughes of the earlier manner.\r\n\r\nLatterly, Mr. Hughes has succeeded in establishing the distinction\r\nwhich he did not succeed in making during that campaign. When he\r\nconfronted the task of Secretary of State, he carefully studied the\r\ninternational career of Woodrow Wilson, as a sort of inverse\r\nNapoleon, a sort of diplomatic bad example.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" he said to himself, \"was a mistake of Wilson,\" and he noted\r\nit. \"And this,\" he observed thoughtfully, \"was another mistake of\r\nWilson. I shall avoid it.\" \"This,\" he again impressed on his\r\nmemory, \"was where Lloyd George and Clemenceau trapped him. I shall\r\nkeep out of that pit.\"\r\n\r\nHis head, like a book of etiquette, is full of \"Don'ts,\" diplomatic\r\n\"Don'ts,\" all deduced from the experience of Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe former President met Europe face to face. Mr. Hughes thanks his\r\nstars for the breadth of the Atlantic. The former President put his\r\nLeague of Nations first on his program. Mr. Hughes puts his League\r\nof Nations last, to be set up after every other question is\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThe former President tried to sell the Country pure idealism. Now\r\nas a people we have the habit of wars in which we seek nothing, but\r\nafter which, in spite of ourselves, a little territory, a few\r\nislands, or a region out of which we subsequently carve half a\r\ndozen States, is found adhering to us. Mr. Wilson offered us a war\r\nin which, of course, we sought nothing and found, at the end of it,\r\nnot the customary few trifles of territory, but the whole\r\nembarrassing, beggarly world adhering to us. The thumbscrew and the\r\nrack could not wring from Mr. Hughes the admission that we are\r\nafter anything more lofty than our interests.\r\n\r\nOne of the present Secretary's \"Don'ts\" of similar derivation is\r\n\"Don't have a fight with the Senate unless you make sure first that\r\nyou have the public with you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes does not run away from fights; he likes them. But\r\nbelieving God to be on the side with the most battalions, and\r\nintending scrupulously to observe this last \"Don't,\" in order to\r\nsecure the necessary popular support, he is as Secretary of State,\r\n\"handing the government back to the people,\" just as he did when\r\ngovernor,--a little less self-consciously, perhaps, a little less\r\nnoisily, but still none the less truly.\r\n\r\nHe is the most democratic Secretary of State this Country has ever\r\nhad, and this includes Bryan to whose school, as has just been\r\nremarked, he originally belonged. If we are ever to have democratic\r\ncontrol of foreign relations, it will be by the methods of Mr.\r\nHughes, because of the training and beliefs of Mr. Hughes, and as a\r\nconsequence of the most undemocratic control of foreign relations\r\nwhich our Constitution attempted to fasten upon us.\r\n\r\nA successful foreign policy requires public understanding and\r\nsupport. The makers of the Constitution established in our\r\ngovernment a nice balance of powers between the various\r\ndepartments, beautifully adjusted until someone thought of putting\r\na stone into one side of the balance. That stone is the people. The\r\nFathers of the Constitution had not noticed it. The executive put\r\nit into its end of the balance some years ago, and the legislative\r\nhas been kicking the beam ever since. One nice bit of balancing was\r\nthat between the Senate and the Executive on treaty making. In\r\nforeign relations, the President can do everything, and he can do\r\nnothing without the approval of two thirds of the Senate. It is a\r\nnice balance, which broke the heart of John Hay, frittered away the\r\nsentimentalities of Mr. Bryan, and destroyed Mr. Wilson.\r\n\r\nNo one ever thought of putting the stone into it until the Senate\r\ndid so two years ago, by discussing the Versailles treaty in the\r\nopen, right before the public. The people got into the scale, and\r\nMr. Wilson hit the sky.\r\n\r\nMr. Hughes observed what happened. He is determined that the stone\r\nthis time shall go in on his end of the balance. He talks to the\r\ncountry daily. He takes the people into his confidence, telling all\r\nthat can be told and as soon as it can be told. He makes foreign\r\nrelations hold front pages with the Stillman divorce case. He makes\r\nno step without carrying the country with him. He comes as near\r\nconducting a daily referendum on what we shall do for our\r\n\"interests\" as in a country so big as ours can be done; and that is\r\ndemocratic control of foreign relations, initiated by the Senate,\r\nfor its own undoing.\r\n\r\nInto that balance where he is placing the stone, he will put more\r\nof mankind's destinies than any other man on earth holds in his\r\nhands to-day. His has been a long way up from the shy, sensitive\r\nyouth that one who knew him when he was beginning the law describes\r\nto me. He was then unimaginably awkward, incapable of unbending, a\r\nwet blanket socially. An immense effort of will has gone into\r\nfashioning the agreeable and habitual diner-out of to-day, into\r\nprofiting by the mistakes of the New York governorship, of the\r\ncampaign of 1916.\r\n\r\nOne sees still the traces of the early stiffness; the face is\r\nsensitive; the eyes drop, seldom meeting yours squarely; when they\r\ndo, they are the mild eyes of the Church! I suppose the early\r\nexperiences of the Church help him.\r\n\r\nHis attitude toward Colonel Harvey's and other of the President's\r\ndiplomatic appointments takes its color from his good father's\r\nattitude toward the problem of evil. God put evil in the world, and\r\nit is not for man to question. The President sends the Harveys\r\nabroad; they are not Mr. Hughes', but his own personal representatives.\r\nIt is not for Mr. Hughes to question.\r\n\r\nHe grows a better Republican every day. And the Republicans of the\r\nSenate are not reconciled. They feel like the man who saw the\r\nhippopotamus:\r\n\r\n    If he should stay to tea, I thought,\r\n    There won't be much for us.\r\n\r\nThere won't be much for them. Enthusiasm grows among them over his\r\nadmirable fitness for reinterment on the Supreme Bench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD M. HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of Colonel Edward M. House was fully revealed by a story\r\nof his youth, which he told me at Paris in the concluding moments\r\nof the Peace Conference. He was elated and confident. The\r\ncompromises in which he delighted had been made. The gifts had all\r\nbeen bestowed--of territory which men will have to fight for to\r\nkeep, of reparations which will never be paid, of alliances which\r\nwill never be carried out, of a League of Nations which the\r\nColonel's own Nation will never enter.\r\n\r\nLooking the work over with that blindness with which men are struck\r\nwho are under the dominion of another and stronger man's mind, his\r\ngentle soul was flooded with happiness. He was as near boasting as\r\none of his modest habits could be, as his mind turned to the wisdom\r\nof his youth which had brought forth this excellent fruit.\r\n\r\n\"I got my first real sight of politics,\" he said, \"when I was a boy\r\nin Cornell University. My great chum there was young Morton, a son\r\nof the Republican war governor of Indiana. The Hayes-Tilden\r\ncontest over the Presidency was being decided. Morton and I used to\r\nrun away from Ithaca to Washington during that absorbing fight. By\r\nreason of his father's position in the Democratic party, he could\r\nget in behind the scenes as few young men could; and he took me\r\nwith him. I saw the whole amazing thing. I made up my mind then and\r\nthere that only three or four men in this country counted, and that\r\nthere was little chance of rising to be one of those three or four\r\nby the ordinary methods.\"\r\n\r\nHe was, when he said this, at the apex of his career, behind the\r\nscenes of the greatest World Congress ever held, following the\r\ngreatest War the world had ever known. And he had been behind the\r\nscenes as had no other man, in Europe as a privileged onlooker with\r\nboth belligerents, and in America as the confidant of tremendous\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nHe was there, as in his college days, at the Hayes-Tilden contest,\r\nby grace of a friend whose influence had been sufficient to secure\r\nhim his opportunities. The parallel was in his mind, and he\r\nregarded it with self-approval. He had chosen his course and chosen\r\nit wisely. It had led him to the greatest peace-making in history.\r\n\r\nThere was a little more self-revelation. He and Morton had prepared\r\nfor college with Yale in view. But Morton had flunked his entrance\r\nexaminations at Yale and afterward succeeded in passing the Cornell\r\ntests. House had gone to Cornell to be with his friend, an early\r\nindication of a capacity for self-effacement, for attachment to the\r\nnearest great man at hand who could take him behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of Colonel House is that he has been possessed all his\r\nlife, almost passionately, with that instinct which makes boys run\r\nto fires. His fastening upon the favorably placed, whether it was\r\nMorton in his youth, or Wilson in his maturity, was not ordinary\r\nself-seeking, not having for its object riches or power or\r\ninfluence. It was merely desire to see for the pure love of seeing.\r\n\r\nHis is a boundless curiosity about both men and events. His eyes\r\nare the clue to his character. Boardman Robinson, with the\r\ncaricaturist's gift for catching that feature which exhibits\r\ncharacter, said to me one day during the War, \"I just passed\r\nColonel House on the street. The most wonderful seeing eyes I ever\r\nsaw!\"\r\n\r\nNature had made Colonel House all eyes--trivial in figure,\r\nundistinguished, slightly ludicrous, almost shambling, shrinking\r\nunder observation so that he gained a reputation for mystery, with\r\nonly one feature to catch your attention, a most amazingly fine\r\npair of eyes. It was as if nature had concentrated on those eyes,\r\ntreating all the puny rest of him with careless indifference. They\r\nare eyes that delight in seeing, eyes to seek a place in the first\r\nrow of the grand stand of world events, eyes that turn steadily\r\noutward upon objective reality. Not the eyes of a visionary--House\r\ngot his visions of the brotherhood of man and the rest of it at\r\nsecond-hand from Wilson--eyes that glow not with the internal fires\r\nof a great soul, but with the intoxication of the spectacle.\r\n\r\nAnd with the eyes nature had given House an unerring instinct for\r\ngetting where, with his small figure, he could see. The ego of the\r\npassionate spectator is as peculiar as that of the book collector\r\nor the curiosity hunter. Given a shoulder tall enough the\r\ndiminutive House perches upon it, like a small boy watching a\r\ncircus parade from his father's broad back, whether the shoulder be\r\nMorton's in his youth, or Wilson's in his maturity.\r\n\r\nSome have tried to explain House by saying that he had the vanity\r\nof loving familiarity with the great; but I doubt if House cared\r\nfor kings, as kings, any more than a bibliomaniac cares for jade.\r\nHe wanted to see; and kings were merely tall objects on which to\r\nperch and regard the spectacle.\r\n\r\nHe remained simple and unaffected by his contacts with Europe, did\r\nnone of the vulgar aping of the toady, coming away from the Peace\r\nConference an unconscious provincial, who said \"Eye-talian\" in the\r\ncomic-paper way, and Fiume pronouncing the first syllable as if he\r\nwere exclaiming \"Fie! for shame!\"--an unspoiled Texan who must have\r\ncared as little what kings and potentates thought of him as a\r\nnewsboy watching a baseball game cares for the accidental company\r\nof a bank president.\r\n\r\nThe world has been good to Colonel House, according to his\r\nstandards. He has realized his ambition to the fullest. Life has\r\ngiven him all he wanted, the privilege of seeing, more abundantly\r\nthan to any other in his generation, perhaps in all time; for he is\r\nhistory's greatest spectator.\r\n\r\nHe is glad. His heart is full. He wishes to give in return. He is\r\nthe kindest-hearted man who has ever had empires at his disposal.\r\nHe wants to give, give, give. He wants to make happy. He was the\r\nfairy godmother of Europe, the diplomatic Carnegie, who thought it\r\na disgrace to die diplomatically rich.\r\n\r\nFor many months I saw him almost daily at Paris. His was a heart of\r\ngold, whether in personal or international relations; but a heart\r\nof gold does not make a great negotiator. Perverse and nationalistic\r\nraces of men, incredulous of the millenium, keep their hearts of gold\r\nat home when they go out to deal with their neighbors.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for Colonel House to say no. He might go so far as\r\nto utter the first letter of that indispensable monosyllable; but\r\nbefore he accomplished the vowel, his mind would turn to some happy\r\n\"formula\" passing midway between no and yes. He was fertile in\r\nthese expedients. Daily he would talk of some new \"formula,\" for\r\nFiume, for Dantzig, for the Saar Valley, for the occupation of the\r\nRhine, for Shantung, always happily, always hopefully. The amiable\r\nWilliam Allen White hit off his disposition perfectly when he said\r\nHouse's daily prayer was, \"Give us this day our daily compromise.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he split a hair between the south and southwest side, it was\r\nnot for logistic pleasure; it was to divide it with splendid\r\njustice and send each of two rival claimants away happy in the\r\npossession of exactly half of the slender filament, so that neither\r\nwould be empty handed. I never saw a man so overjoyed as he was one\r\nday late in April or early in May when M. Clemenceau had left his\r\nrooms in the Hotel Crillon with the promise of Franco-American\r\ndefensive alliance.\r\n\r\n\"The old man,\" he said, \"is very happy. He has got what he has been\r\nafter. I can't tell you just now what it is. But he has got it at\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\nHe had been the donor, for Mr. Wilson, of the exact southwest side\r\nof a hair, the promise to submit, without recommendations, an\r\nalliance to the United States Senate, which had little prospect of\r\never being accepted by this country. The sight of the French\r\nPremier's happiness made him radiant.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely because representatives of foreign governments\r\nfound Colonel House easy to see when they could not gain access to\r\nPresident Wilson that kept a throng running to his quarters in the\r\nCrillon; it was because there they found the line of least\r\nresistance. There was the readiest sympathy. There was the greatest\r\ndesire to accommodate. He sought always for a formula that would\r\nsatisfy the claims of all.\r\n\r\nA man so ready to compromise is actuated by no guiding principle.\r\nMr. Scott, the editor of the \"Manchester Guardian\", said when\r\nPresident Wilson was in England; \"Yes, Lloyd George is honestly for\r\nthe League of Nations. But that won't prevent him from doing things\r\nat Paris which will be utterly inconsistent with the principle of\r\nsuch a league. It isn't intellectual dishonesty; but Lloyd George\r\nhasn't a logical mind. He doesn't understand the implications of\r\nhis own position.\"\r\n\r\nNeither did Colonel House at Paris. The League of Nations was an\r\nemotion with him, not a principle. It was a tremendous emotion. He\r\nspoke of it in a voice that almost broke. I remember his glowing\r\neyes and the little catch in his throat as he said, at Paris, \"The\r\npoliticians don't like the League of Nations. And if they really\r\nknew what it would do to them, they would like it still less.\"\r\n\r\nBut, for all that naive faith in the wonders it would do, Colonel\r\nHouse had not thought out the League of Nations, and was quite\r\nincapable of thinking it out, for he is not a man of analytical\r\nmind; and what mental power he had was inhibited by the glow of his\r\nfeelings. His temperature was above the thinking point. Thus, like\r\nMr. Lloyd George, he could make compromises that played ducks and\r\ndrakes with his general position, since he had no real\r\nunderstanding of the League, which was not an intellectual\r\nconviction with him, arduously arrived at, but which possessed his\r\nsoul as by an act of grace, like an old-fashioned religious\r\nconversion.\r\n\r\nHe was loyal at heart to Mr. Wilson and to everything that was Mr.\r\nWilson's, his mind being absorbed into Mr. Wilson's, and having no\r\nindependent existence. There are natures which demand an utter and\r\nunquestioning loyalty in those to whom they yield their confidence,\r\nand Mr. Wilson's was of that sort, as a remark of his about\r\nSecretary Colby will indicate.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lansing was removed from office, the country was astounded\r\nto learn that he was to be succeeded by Bainbridge Colby. The\r\nPresident communicated his decision first to one of the few who\r\nthen had access to his sick room. This adviser ventured to\r\nexpostulate.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Colby,\" he said, \"is brilliant, but he is uncertain. His whole\r\ncareer has lacked stability. He is not known to have the qualities\r\nwhich the Nation has been taught to expect in a Secretary of\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate,\" replied the President sharply, \"he is loyal.\"\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Colonel House was loyal.\r\n\r\nThe ego of Mr. Wilson demanded and received utter loyalty from him,\r\na loyalty that forbade thinking, forbade criticism, forbade\r\nindependence of any sort. Moreover, Colonel House was in contact\r\nwith a mind much stronger than his, with a personality much more\r\npowerful than his. He was caught into the Wilson orbit. He revolved\r\nabout Mr. Wilson. He got his light from Mr. Wilson, who had that\r\npower, which Colonel Roosevelt had, of irradiating minor\r\npersonalities. Colonel House was nothing until he gravitated to Mr.\r\nWilson. He is going back to be nothing to-day, nothing but a kind,\r\nlovable man, a gentle soul rather unfitted for the world, with an\r\nextraordinary capacity for friendship and sympathy, and that fine\r\npair of eyes.\r\n\r\nI remember at Paris the affecting evidences of the little man's\r\nloyalty to his great friend, of whom he could not speak without\r\nemotion. He was never tired of dilating upon the wonder of\r\nPresident Wilson's mind:\r\n\r\n\"I never saw,\" he would say, \"so quick a mind, with such a capacity\r\nfor instant understanding. The President can go to the bottom of\r\nthe most difficult question as no one else in the world can.\"\r\n\r\nHouse's endless \"formulae\" always bore the self-effacing condition,\r\n\"if Mr. Wilson approves.\" \"If Mr. Wilson approves\" was the D. V. of\r\nColonel House's religion. Too much awe of another mind is not good\r\nfor your own, or carries with it certain implications about your\r\nown.\r\n\r\nColonel House's loyalty to Mr. Wilson did not, however, make him\r\nhate the men at Paris who stood across the President's path. The\r\npersonal representative's heart was too catholic for that. He--\r\n\r\n  Liked what e're he looked on\r\n  And his looks went everywhere.\r\n\r\nHe had a kindly feeling for the \"old man,\" Clemenceau. He was a\r\nwarm friend of Orlando, with whom Mr. Wilson had his quarrel over\r\nFiume. He though well of Lloyd George, whom Mr. Wilson went abroad\r\nhating.\r\n\r\nThe Peace Conference was to him a personal problem. Peace was peace\r\nbetween Wilson and Clemenceau and Lloyd George and Orlando.\r\nCompromises were an accommodation among friends.\r\n\r\nI never saw a man so utterly distressed as he was when President\r\nWilson threatened to break up the Peace Conference and sent for the\r\nGeorge Washington to take him home from Brest. It was as if his own\r\ndearest friends had become involved in a violent quarrel. He did\r\nnot see the incident in terms of the principles involved, but only\r\nas the painful interruption of kindly personal relations. Men speak\r\nof him sometimes as the one of our commissioners who knew Europe;\r\nand Europeans, appreciating his sympathy, have fostered this idea\r\nby referring to his understanding of European problems.\r\n\r\nBut the Europe Colonel House knew was a personal Europe. The\r\ncountries on his map were Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and Orlando.\r\nThe problems of his Europe were Lloyd George, Clemenceau, and\r\nOrlando. He knew what Lloyd George wanted. He knew what Clemenceau\r\nwanted. He knew what Orlando wanted. That was enough.\r\n\r\nHis kindness of heart, his desire for pleasant personal relations,\r\nhis incapacity to think in terms of principles, whether of the\r\nLeague of Nations or not, betrayed him in the matter of Shantung.\r\nWhether the Peace Conference should return Shantung to China, or\r\nleave it to Japan to return to China was to him, he often said,\r\n\"only a question of method. There is no principle involved.\" The\r\nJapanese were a sensitive people, why should a kind heart question\r\nthe excellence of their intentions with respect to China? Shantung\r\nwould of course be returned. It was only a question of how.\r\n\r\nThe simple heart of Colonel House did not save him, either as a\r\ndiplomat or as a friend. The failures at Paris plunged Mr. Wilson\r\ninto depression in which he went as far down into the valley as he\r\nhad been up on the heights during his vision--of a world made\r\nbetter by his hand. In his darker moments he saw nothing but enmity\r\nand disloyalty about him--even, a little later, \"usurpation\" in the\r\ncase of the timorous and circumspect Mr. Lansing.\r\n\r\nColonel House says that he does not yet know what caused the breach\r\nbetween the President and himself. Relations stopped; that was all.\r\n\r\nThis is what occurred: Shortly after Colonel House had convinced\r\nthe President that the disposal of Shantung was only a question of\r\nmethod he disappeared from Paris \"to take a rest\"; and it became\r\nknown that after all he was not to sit in the Council of the League\r\nof Nations representing America, as Mr. Wilson had originally\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nAt this time, a close friend of President Wilson and one of his\r\nmost intimate advisers, said to me, \"The most insidious influence\r\nhere is the social influence.\"\r\n\r\nBritish entertainment of members of the House family had been\r\nmarked and assiduous, and the flattery had had its effect, though\r\nnot probably upon the Colonel, who remained unspoiled by social\r\ncontacts to the last. Nevertheless, a member of Mr. Wilson's family\r\nhad called the President's attention to the social forces that the\r\nBritish were bringing to bear. The President by this time was in a\r\nmood to be made angry and suspicious. Doubt was lodged in his mind.\r\nAnd when he found this country critical of the Shantung settlement,\r\nthat doubt became a conviction; the British through social\r\nattentions, had wheedled House into a position favorable to their\r\nallies, the Japanese. The loyal House was convicted of the one\r\nunforgivable offense, disloyalty.\r\n\r\nWhen the casting off of House became, later, in this country\r\nunmistakable, I inquired regarding it of the friend and adviser of\r\nthe President whom I have just mentioned, and he repeated to me,\r\nforgetting that he used them before, the exact words he had said at\r\nParis, \"The most insidious influence at the Peace Conference was\r\nthe social influence.\"\r\n\r\nThe most insidious influence with Colonel House was the kindness of\r\nhis own heart. He had too many friends. His view of international\r\nrelations was too personal. Principles will make a man hard, cold,\r\nand unyielding, and Colonel House had no principles, or had them\r\nonly parrot-like from Mr. Wilson. He was the human side of the\r\nPresident, who for those contacts which his office demanded had\r\nfound a human side necessary and accordingly annexed the amiable\r\nTexan.\r\n\r\nWilson's human side had offended him, and he cut it off,\r\naccordingly to the scriptural injunction against the offending\r\nright hand. The act was cruel, but it was just, as just as the\r\ndismissal of Mr. Lansing; for House failed Wilson at Paris, being\r\none of Wilson's greatest sources of weakness there. His excessive\r\noptimism, his kindheartedness, his credulity, his lack of\r\nindependence of mind, his surrender of his imagination to a\r\nstronger imagination, his conception of politics not as morals but\r\nas the adjustment of personal differences, left Wilson without a\r\ncapable critical adviser at the Conference.\r\n\r\nWhen House talked to Wilson, it was a weaker Wilson talking to the\r\nreal Wilson. Colonel House in retirement and since the breach, is\r\nstill Colonel House, kindhearted and unobtrusive. He has seen, and\r\nhe is satisfied. He has a fine and perhaps half-unconscious loyalty\r\nto the great man from whose shoulders he surveyed the world. His is\r\nan ego that brushes itself off readily after a fall and asks for no\r\nalms of sympathy.\r\n\r\nHe does not, like Mr. Lansing, fill five hundred octavo pages with\r\n\"I told you so,\" and you can not conceive of his using that form of\r\nself-justification.\r\n\r\nI hope to see him some day playing Santa Claus in a children's\r\nChristmas celebration at a village church!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBERT HOOVER\r\n\r\n\r\nOne reads in the press daily of Hughes and Hoover, or Mellen and\r\nHoover, or Davis and Hoover, or Wallace and Hoover. If it is a\r\nquestion of foreign relations, it is the Secretary of State and\r\nHoover. If it has to do with using our power as a creditor nation\r\nto compel the needy foreigners to buy here, in spite of the tariff\r\nwall we are going to erect against their selling here, it is the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury and Hoover. If strikes threaten, it is\r\nthe Secretary of Labor and Hoover. If the farmers seek more direct\r\naccess to the markets, it is the Secretary of Agriculture and\r\nHoover.\r\n\r\nIt is always \"and Hoover.\" What Mr. Hughes does not know about\r\ninternational affairs--and that is considerable--Mr. Hoover does.\r\nWhat Mr. Mellen does not know about foreign finance--and that is\r\nless--Mr. Hoover does. What Mr. Davis does not know about labor--and\r\nthat is everything--Mr. Hoover does. What Mr. Wallace does not\r\nknow about farm marketing--and that is nothing--Mr. Hoover does.\r\n\r\nHerbert Hoover is the most useful supplement of the administration.\r\nHe possesses a variety of experiences, gained in making money\r\nabroad, in administering the Belgian relief, in husbanding the\r\nworld's food supply after our entrance into the War, in helping\r\nwrite the peace treaty, which no one else equals. He is as handy as\r\na dictionary of dates or a cyclopedia of useful information,\r\ninvaluable books, which never obtain their just due; for no one\r\never signs his masterpiece with the name of its coauthor, thus, by\r\n\"John Smith and the Cyclopedia of Useful Information.\"\r\n\r\nA bad particle to ride into fame behind, that word \"and,\" begetter\r\nof much oblivion! Who can say what goes after the \"and\" which\r\nfollows the name McKinley, or Hayes, or Cleveland, or even\r\nRoosevelt? Who has sufficient \"faith in Massachusetts\" to remember\r\nlong the decorous dissyllable connected by \"and\" with the name\r\nHarding? The link, \"and,\" is not strong enough to hold. You recall\r\nthe \"and\"; that is all; as in the case of that article of food,\r\norigin of many \"calories,\" to use Mr. Hoover's favorite word, in\r\nthe quick-serve resorts of the humble, where it supplements ably\r\nand usefully, but without honorable mention, slender portions of\r\nbeef, pork, and ham.\r\n\r\nTo describe briefly, in a phrase, what has happened to Hoover; two\r\nyears ago, it was \"Hoover\"; to-day, it is \"and Hoover.\"\r\n\r\nWhy the connective? Because, to put it bluntly, however great his\r\nother gifts are--and they are remarkable--he lacks political\r\nintelligence. He reminds one now of a great insect caught in the\r\nmeshes of a silken web. He struggles this way and that. He flutters\r\nhis wings, and the web of politics fastens itself to him with a\r\nhundred new contacts.\r\n\r\nFacing possible elimination from public life, he accepted a dull\r\nand unromantic department under President Harding. He was told that\r\nhe could \"make something of it.\" Modern Greeks bearing gifts always\r\nbring you an opportunity which \"you, and you alone, can make\r\nsomething of.\" He is trying to make something of it, something more\r\nthan Mr. Harding and the party advisers intended when they gave him\r\nthe Secretaryship of Commerce. He is trying to dramatize some turn\r\nof fate and be once more a \"big figure.\" He is tireless. He arrives\r\nat his office fabulously early. Clerks drop in their tracks before\r\nhe leaves at night. He has time to see everyone who would see him;\r\nfor he can never tell when \"the man with the idea\" will knock at\r\nhis door. Unlike the British naval officer charged with the duty of\r\nexamining inventions to win the War, who is described by Guedalla as\r\nsitting like an inverted Micawber \"waiting for something to turn\r\ndown,\" he is waiting for something to turn up. He does more than\r\nwait; he works twenty hours a day trying to turn something up.\r\n\r\nAnd he will turn something up. The chances are that he will do as\r\nmuch for the infant foreign trade of this country as Alexander\r\nHamilton did for the infant finances of this country. He promises\r\nto be the most useful cabinet officer in a generation. But this is\r\nless than his ambition. If he were an unknown man, it would be\r\nenough; but you measure him by the stature of Hoover of the Belgian\r\nRelief. Like the issue of great fathers, he is eclipsed by a\r\npreceding fame. As well be the son of William Shakespeare as the\r\npolitical progeny of Hoover, The Food Administrator!\r\n\r\nThe War spoiled life for many men; for Wilson, for Baruch, for\r\nHoover. After its magnificent amplifications of personality, it is\r\nhard to descend to every day, and be not a tremendous figure, but a\r\nsuccessful secretary of an unromantic department.\r\n\r\nHe might concentrate with advantage to his future fame. A brief\r\nabsence from front pages, under the connective \"and,\" would cause\r\nthe public heart to grow fonder when he did \"make something\" of his\r\nown department.\r\n\r\nBut two disqualifications stand in his way;--his lack of political\r\nintelligence, and his consequent inability to make quick decisions\r\nin a political atmosphere. His present diffusion of his energies\r\nsprings, I think, from indecision; for in politics he can not make\r\nup his mind, as he can in business, where the greatest profit lies.\r\n\r\nI first heard of this weakness of his when he was Food\r\nAdministrator in Washington, and when other members of the Wilson\r\nWar Administration, equal in rank with him and having to cooperate\r\nwith him, complained frequently of his slowness. He had able\r\nsubordinates, they said, the leading men in the various food\r\nindustries, and they had to make up his mind for him. I set this\r\ncharge down, at the time, to jealousy and prejudice, Mr. Hoover\r\nbeing always an outsider in the Wilson administration; but the long\r\ndelay and immense difficulty he made over deciding, although all\r\nhis life a Republican, whether he was or was not a Republican in\r\nthe campaign of 1920, seemed all the proof of indecision that was\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like heresy about one who has been advertised as he has;\r\nbut remember that we know little about him except what the best\r\npress agents in history have said of him. He achieved his\r\nprofessional success in the Orient, far from observation, and his\r\nfinancial success far from American eyes. His public career in the\r\nrelief of Belgium and in the administration of food was the object\r\nof world-wide good will. And, moreover, indecision in politics is\r\ncommon enough among men who are strong and able in other activities.\r\nMr. Taft was a great judge but wrecked his administration as\r\nPresident by inability to make up his mind. Senator Kellogg was a\r\nbrilliantly successful lawyer; but in public life he is so hesitant\r\nthat Minnesota politicians speak of him as \"Nervous Nelly,\" and\r\neven Mr. Taft, during the Treaty fight, rebuked him to his face\r\nfor lack of courage.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoover's face is not that of a decisive character. The brow is\r\nample and dominant; there is vision and keen intelligence; but the\r\nrest of the face is not strong, and it wears habitually a wavering\r\nself-conscious smile. This smile, as if everybody were looking at\r\nhim, makes him remind one as he comes out of a Cabinet meeting of a\r\nsmall boy in a classroom carrying a bouquet of flowers up to his\r\nteacher. He has, moreover, a strain of pessimism in his nature,\r\nwhich may account for his indecision. You catch him in moods of\r\nprofound depression. He was in one just before his appointment to\r\nthe Cabinet, when his European relief work was not going to his\r\nliking, and when the politicians, he felt, were forcing him into a\r\nposition of little scope and opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn politics, he has enough vanity and self-consciousness to be\r\naware constantly of forces opposed to him, covert, hostile,\r\nunscrupulous, personal forces--forces that he does not understand.\r\nGive him a mining problem, he can reckon with the forces of nature\r\nthat have to be overcome. Give him a problem of finance, he knows\r\nthe enmities of finance. He is in his element. In politics he is\r\nnot. He is baffled.\r\n\r\nAn illustrative incident occurred in the spring of 1920, when both\r\nparties were talking of him as their candidate for President and he\r\nwas uncertain whether he was a Republican or not. Mr. Hearst, in\r\nhis newspapers, published an attack upon him, saying that he was\r\nmore Briton than American, and to prove it printed a list of\r\nBritish corporations of which he was a director.\r\n\r\nAll his suspicions were aroused over this everyday occurrence of\r\npolitics. Where had Mr. Hearst obtained the unfortunate\r\ninformation? He saw plots and treachery. Someone in his confidence\r\nmust have betrayed him for money. A careful investigation was made,\r\nand it was discovered that the editor had drawn upon \"Who's Who,\"\r\nto which Mr. Hoover himself had furnished the information before he\r\nbegan thinking of the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThe politicians tricked him so completely in the preconvention\r\ncampaign of 1920 that he has the best reasons for distrusting\r\nhimself. He was always, during that campaign, a candidate for the\r\nRepublican nomination to the Presidency. At the very time when his\r\nspokesman, Julius Barnes, was saying for him that he could not\r\nchoose between the two parties until he had seen their candidates\r\nand read their platforms, and when the Democrats were most\r\nseriously impressed with his availability, the manager of his paper\r\nin Washington said to me, \"This talk of Hoover for the Democratic\r\nnomination is moonshine. He won't take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not,\" I asked him.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" he replied, \"he does not think it is worth having,\" a\r\nquite practical reason which differed wholly from the official\r\nexplanation that Mr. Hoover was waiting to see which party was\r\nprogressive so that he might oppose reaction.\r\n\r\nHis subsequent support of the more conservative candidate and the\r\nmore conservative party bore out the truth of what his newspaper\r\nmanager had said. And in reality, Mr. Hoover is as conservative as\r\nMr. Harding himself, being a large capitalist with all the\r\nconservatism of the capitalist class.\r\n\r\nA little while ago, Mr. Roosevelt had made it unfashionable to\r\nadmit that you were conservative. You wished it to be understood\r\nthat you were open-minded--\"forward looking,\" as Mr. Wilson, who\r\nturned reactionary at the test, called it; that you were broad,\r\nsympathetic, free from mean prejudices, progressive, in short. Our\r\nvery best reactionaries of to-day all used to call themselves\r\nprogressive. Some still do.\r\n\r\nThe young editor of a metropolitan newspaper, born to great wealth,\r\nand imbibing all the narrowness of the second generation, once\r\nasked me in those bright days when everybody was thrilling over his\r\n\"liberality,\" \"Would you call me a radical, or just a progressive?\"\r\nHe was \"just a progressive.\" In a somewhat similar sense, Mr.\r\nHoover was quite unconsciously \"just a progressive\"--a belated\r\nfollower of a pleasant fashion, having lived abroad too long when\r\nhe made his announcement to note the subtle changes that had taken\r\nplace in our thinking--the rude shock that Russia had given to our\r\n\"liberality.\"\r\n\r\nBut living abroad, it is only fair to add, has created a difference\r\nbetween his conservatism and that, let us say, of Judge Gary. He\r\nhas grown used to labor unions and even to labor parties, so that\r\nthey do not frighten him. His is conservatism, none the less,\r\ndefinite conservatism, if more enlightened than the obscurant\r\nAmerican variety.\r\n\r\nHis hesitation and indecision in the spring of 1920 thus did not\r\nspring from doubt of the Republican party's progressiveness. He\r\nalways desired the Republican nomination; but his vanity would\r\nsuffer by the open seeking of it and the defeat which seemed\r\nlikely; and his sensitiveness would suffer from the attacks, like\r\nthat of Mr. Hearst, which an open candidacy would entail; for he is\r\nat once vain and thin-skinned.\r\n\r\nSpringing thus from reluctance to make up his mind, the\r\nannouncement was received as the evidence of a very large mind.\r\nAmong the public, Mr. Hoover was taken for a man who cared more for\r\nprinciple than for party or for politics. Among the politicians, he\r\nassumed the proportions of a portent, with a genius for politics\r\nsecond only to that of Roosevelt himself, who in a difficult\r\nsituation could take the one position and say the one thing that\r\nmight force his nomination.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats pricked up their ears. Mr. Wilson, sick and\r\ndiscouraged, began to entertain hopes of a candidate who would save\r\nthe Democracy from ruin. Homer Cummings, National Chairman of Mr.\r\nWilson's party, began to regard Mr. Hoover's possible nomination\r\nfavorably. The Republican managers became alarmed. They knew from\r\nMr. Hoover's friends that he, as his Washington newspaper manager\r\nhad said, thought the Democratic nomination not worth having; but\r\nthey feared lest by the course he was pursuing he might make it\r\nworth having, might take it, and might rob them of the election\r\nwhich they felt safely theirs. If they could induce him to declare\r\nhis Republicanism, the Democrats would drop him, the public would\r\ncease to be interested in him as a dramatic personality too big for\r\nparty trammels, and they themselves could ignore him.\r\n\r\nIt was decided to have him read out of the Republican party as a\r\nwarning to him of how he was imperiling his hopes of the only\r\nnomination he valued, and at the same time have Republican leaders\r\ngo to him or his friends and advise him and them that if he would\r\nonly declare his Republicanism, a popular demand would force his\r\nnomination at Chicago.\r\n\r\nSenator Penrose was chosen as the Republican whose pontifical\r\ndamnation would most impress Mr. Hoover. The late W. Murray Crane,\r\nwhom I have heard described at Mr. Roosevelt's dinner table as \"the\r\nUriah Heap of the Republican party,\" was the emissary who would\r\nadvise Mr. Hoover to confess the error of his ways and seek the\r\nabsolution of Penrose. A diary kept at Republican National\r\nHeadquarters in New York reveals the visits there at the time the\r\nplan was made of Mr. Crane and others who took part in the\r\nenterprise. Mr. Penrose got up from a sick bed and thundered: under\r\nno circumstances would he permit the nomination of Mr. Hoover.\r\n\r\nThe plot succeeded. In a few days, Mr. Hoover declared that he\r\nwould not take the Democratic nomination. The Democrats dropped\r\nhim. The public was bewildered by his finding out that he was a\r\nRepublican after saying that he could not tell whether he was one\r\nor not until he had seen the Republican candidate and the platform.\r\n\r\nAt the Chicago Convention he received the support of Mr. Crane,\r\nGovernor Miller, of New York, and, on the last ballot, of William\r\nAllen White, who having voted for Harding on the just previous\r\nballot, said he wanted to \"leave the bandwagon and ride with the\r\nundertaker.\"\r\n\r\nThis guilelessness of Mr. Hoover in politics will prevent him from\r\nrealizing his larger ambitions; but is a source of strength to him\r\nin his present position, with American business men who have\r\nlearned to distrust politicians. At any rate, he is no politician;\r\nhe thinks as business men think; his interests are their interests;\r\nand when he comes to them bearing gifts,--the aid and cooperation\r\nof the United States Government in their efforts to win foreign\r\ntrade,--they do not take him for a Greek.\r\n\r\nHe possesses great special knowledge which they desire: he knows\r\nmuch about economics and enjoys the advantage of believing that he\r\nknows all; he has immense prestige, as a result of all the\r\nadvertising he received during the War; they come to Washington and\r\nsit at his feet like children; he gives them fatherly lectures,\r\neven upon the morals of their business, which must be clean, to\r\nenter this foreign trade of his, with the Government behind it.\r\nThey make mental resolutions of reform. To no politician, to no\r\none, even with an instinct for politics, would they listen as they\r\nlisten to him. He speaks to American business with immense\r\nauthority. His selection is an example of that unusual instinct for\r\nputting the right man in the right place which President Harding\r\nhas, when he chooses to exercise it.\r\n\r\nThe post was disappointing to Mr. Hoover; but it was the one in\r\nwhich he will be most useful. Not a lawyer, he would hardly have\r\ndone for Secretary of State, in spite of his exceptional knowledge\r\nof foreign conditions. Not a banker, he lacked the technical\r\nequipment for Secretary of the Treasury. Not a politician, he\r\nshould have, and he has a place in which there are the least\r\npossible politics. Mr. Harding denatured him politically by giving\r\nhim the one business department in the Cabinet. Even Hiram Johnson\r\nmay come no longer to hate him.\r\n\r\nFor his present task, besides his special knowledge, his remarkable\r\nindustry, his tireless application to details, he has one great\r\ngift, his extraordinary talent for publicity. There is no one in\r\nWashington, not even Mr. Hughes, who knows so well as he does how\r\nto advertise what he is doing.\r\n\r\nAs business recovers and foreign trade develops, the magazine pages\r\nwill blossom with articles about what American enterprise is\r\nachieving in foreign lands, about the cooperation between American\r\nbusiness and the American government, and, once more, about Mr.\r\nHoover. Finding markets for American wares all over the earth will\r\nbe made a romance only second in interest to the feeding of\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nIt was not an accident that he was better advertised than any\r\ngeneral, admiral, or statesman of the War. It was not all due to\r\nthe good will of the public, to the work which he did in Belgium\r\nand in this country, nor to the extraordinary press agents whose\r\nservices he was able to command because of that good will. Back of\r\nit all was his own instinct for publicity, his sense of what\r\ninterests the people, his assiduous cultivation of editors and\r\nreporters. He has magazine and newspaper contacts only exceeded by\r\nthose of Roosevelt in his time, and a sense of the power of\r\npublicity only exceeded by Roosevelt's.\r\n\r\nWhen he was threatening to win the Democratic nomination for the\r\nPresidency in spite of the fact that he was not a Democrat, a\r\nsupporter of McAdoo complained bitterly to me, \"Confound him! He\r\nhas a genius for self-advertising. He is not half the man McAdoo\r\nis. He hasn't McAdoo's courage, optimism, force, or general\r\nstatesmanship; but he has this infernal talent for getting himself\r\nin the papers. There is not much to him but press agenting; but how\r\ncan you beat that?\"\r\n\r\nBut though his own name has come to count for more than the causes\r\nhe represents, so that the best way to obtain aid is to ask for it\r\nwith \"Hoover\" in big letters and with the suffering children of\r\nCentral Europe in small letters, still he remains only a name to\r\nthe American people. They know that he always wears a blue suit of\r\nclothes cut on an invariable model, which he adopted years ago.\r\nThey know that he worked his way through college as a waiter. They\r\nknow that he grew rich as a mining engineer in the East. That is\r\nall. They think of him as a symbol of efficiency, as one who may\r\nsave their money, as one who may find markets for them and develop\r\ntheir trade, as one who may help the world upon its feet again\r\nafter the War, as a superman, if you will; but not as a man, not as\r\na human being.\r\n\r\nAll his advertising has made him appeal to the American\r\nimagination, but not to the American heart. He is a sort of\r\nefficiency engineer, installing his charts and his systems into\r\npublic life,--and who loves an efficiency engineer? There are no\r\nstories about him which give him a place in the popular breast. It\r\nis impossible to interest yourself in Hoover as Hoover; in Hoover\r\nas the man who did this, or the man who did that, or the man who\r\nwill do this or that, yes,--but not in Hoover, the person.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that he has little personality. On close contact, he\r\nis disappointing, without charm, given to silence, as if he had\r\nnothing for ordinary human relations which had no profitable\r\nbearing on the task in hand. His conversation is applied efficiency\r\nengineering; there is no lost motion, though it is lost motion\r\nwhich is the delight of life. At dinner, he inclines to bury his\r\nface in his plate until the talk reaches some subject important to\r\nhim, when he explodes a few facts, and is once more silent.\r\n\r\nHad he a personality with his instinct for publicity, he would be\r\nanother Roosevelt. But he is a bare expert.\r\n\r\nI doubt if he really thinks of human beings as human beings; on the\r\ncontrary, some engineering graph represents humanity in his mind.\r\nIt is characteristic of him that he always speaks of the relief of\r\nstarving populations not in terms of human suffering, but in terms\r\nof chemistry. The people, of whatever country he may be feeding,\r\nhave so many calories now, last month they had so many calories; if\r\nthey had ten calories more, they could maintain existence. Many\r\ntimes have I heard this formula. It is a weakness in a democracy to\r\nthink of people in terms of graphs, and their welfare in terms of\r\ncalories; that is, if you hope to be President of that democracy--\r\nnot if you are content to be its excellent Secretary of Commerce.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to Washington as a Food Administrator, he brought with\r\nhim an old associate, a professor from California. A few days later\r\nthe professor's wife arrived and went to live at the same house\r\nwhere Mr. Hoover and her husband resided. Mr. Hoover knew her well.\r\nShe and her husband had long been his friends. He met her in the\r\nhall, shook hands with her, welcomed her and then lapsed into\r\nsilence. After some moments, he said, \"Well,--\" and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hoover,\" she said, \"I know you are a busy man. You don't have\r\nto stand here trying to think of something to say to me. I know you\r\nwell enough not to be offended if you don't talk to me at all while\r\nI am here.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed and took her at her word. He had the habit of too great\r\nrelevancy to be human. If he could have said more than \"Well\" to\r\nthat woman, he might have been President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CABOT LODGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Henry Cabot Lodge was elected to Congress thirty-four years\r\nago there were no portents in the heavens, but there was rejoicing\r\nin his native city of Boston and in many other places. It was\r\nhailed as the dawn of a new era. Young, he was only thirty-seven,\r\nwell educated, a teacher of history, and with six serious books to\r\nhis credit, he was a new figure in politics; Providence, moving in\r\nits mysterious way, had designed him to redeem politics from its\r\nbaseness and set a shining example.\r\n\r\nEverything was in his favor; he was not only learned, so learned,\r\nin fact, that he was promptly dubbed the \"scholar in politics,\" but\r\nhe was rich, and therefore immune from all sordid temptation; he\r\nwas a gentleman. Mr. Lodge's forbears had been respectable\r\ntradesmen who knew how to make money and to keep it--and the latter\r\ntrait is strongly developed in their senatorial descendant. From\r\nthem he inherited a fortune; he had been educated in a select\r\nprivate school and then gone through Harvard, whence he emerged\r\nwith an LL.B. and a Ph.D. attached to his name. By all the\r\nestablished canons he was a \"gentleman\" as well as a scholar. In\r\nthe intervals between teaching and writing he had found time to be\r\nadmitted to the Boston bar.\r\n\r\nWith that equipment it could be safely predicted Mr. Lodge would go\r\nfar. He has. To-day he is the leader of the Republican party in the\r\nSenate of the United States.\r\n\r\nHe early justified the promise. While still a Congressional\r\nfreshman he drafted and introduced into the House the \"Force Bill,\"\r\nwhich came to a violent death in the Senate. That Bill was not only\r\na prophecy but it is a resume of Mr. Lodge's career. It is\r\npartisanship gone mad.\r\n\r\nOn the pretense that it was intended to secure fair elections in\r\nthe South, but actually, as described by a member of the House at\r\nthe time, to prevent elections being held in several districts, it\r\nplaced the election machinery in the control of the Federal\r\nGovernment, which, through the Chief Supervisor of Elections, to be\r\nappointed by the President, and his Praetorian Guard of Deputy\r\nMarshals, would have controlled every election and returned an\r\noverwhelming Republican majority from the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe Bill was typical of Mr. Lodge and the way he plays politics.\r\nThe Force Bill would probably have ended ingloriously the political\r\ncareer of any other man, but Mr. Lodge had the luck of being a\r\ngentleman born in Boston. Boston is slow to forget. A quarter of a\r\ncentury after the Civil War, Boston still remembered that conflict,\r\nits heart still bled for the negro deprived of his vote; and a\r\nBoston gentleman could do no wrong--to the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nThe House amused Mr. Lodge, but it was too promiscuous for a person\r\nof his delicate sensibilities who shrank from intimate contact with\r\nthe uneducated and the socially unwashed. Henry Cabot Lodge always\r\ncreates the impression that it is a condescension on his part to\r\nGod to have allowed Him to create a world which is not exclusively\r\npossessed by the Cabots and the Lodges and their connections.\r\n\r\nAll that is only an unfortunate manner. He is really the friend of\r\nthe people, abominating snobbishness and aristocratic pretensions;\r\nin his younger days, when he was campaigning for Congress, he was\r\nknown to have slapped a constituent on the back and called him\r\nfamiliarly by his first name; even now, although he has long ceased\r\nto be a politician and has been canonized as a statesman, the old\r\nimpulses are strong in him. When the time draws near for his\r\nreelection to the Senate, he goes back to Massachusetts, there to\r\ntake part with the common people in their simple pleasures, and\r\naffably to extend a cold and clammy hand to voters, who still\r\nvenerate him as a scholar in politics and a gentleman. So it will\r\nbe easily understood why one of Mr. Lodge's temperament should\r\nearly have cast his covetous eye on the Senate, and at the first\r\nopportunity moved over to that more select atmosphere, which he did\r\nin 1893.\r\n\r\nWhen Senator Lodge entered public life the flagrant spoils system\r\nwas rampant. A little band of earnest men was fighting to reform\r\nthe civil service so as to make it a permanent establishment with\r\nmerit and fitness the tests for appointment instead of political\r\ninfluence. It was a cause naturally to appeal to the \"best people\"\r\nof Boston, and Mr. Lodge, being one of them, having inflexible\r\nprinciples and a high code of honor, threw himself eagerly into the\r\nreform movement and became its apostle. His principles were so\r\nstern and unyielding, he demanded such an exalted standard of\r\nprivate and public morality, that, although he worshipped the\r\nRepublican Party with a devotion almost as great as the memory of\r\nthat grandfather who laid the foundation of the family fortunes,\r\nwith a sorely stricken heart he was compelled to differ with Mr.\r\nBlaine and to flirt with those Ruperts of American politics, the\r\nMugwumps.\r\n\r\n\"The man who sets up as being much better than his age is always to\r\nbe suspected,\" says a historian, \"and Cato is perhaps the best\r\nspecimen of the rugged hypocrite that history can produce.\"\r\n\r\nAs a summary of the character of Cato, this is admirable, but no\r\none would call Mr. Lodge \"rugged.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge's principles, it has been observed, are inflexible and\r\nrest on solid foundation, but like good steel they can bend without\r\nbreaking. An ardent civil service reformer, a champion of public\r\nmorality, so long as offices were being awarded to the faithful, he\r\nsaw no reason why he should be the victim of his own self denying\r\nordinance. Early in his career he became a very successful purveyor\r\nof patronage, developing a keen scent for vacant places or a post\r\nfilled by a Democrat. As a theoretical civil service reformer Mr.\r\nLodge left nothing to be desired; as a practical spoilsman he had\r\nfew equals. A Senator's usefulness to his friends is much greater\r\nthan that of a member of the House, and if a Senator works his pull\r\nfor all that it is worth he can accomplish much. Mr. Lodge was not\r\nidle.\r\n\r\nWith his grandfathers and his fortune Mr. Lodge inherited a violent\r\nand bitter dislike of England. Probably no man--not even the most\r\nextreme Irish agitator--is more responsible for the feeling\r\nexisting against England than Mr. Lodge; because the outspoken\r\nIrish agitator is known for what he is and treated accordingly;\r\ncarrying out Mr. Roosevelt's thought, he will be execrated by\r\ndecent people; but Mr. Lodge, posing as the impartial historian and\r\nthe patriotic statesman, is applauded.\r\n\r\nJust as Mr. Lodge gained a certain fame when he was a member of the\r\nHouse from the Force Bill, which his own party repudiated, so he\r\nsignalized his admission into the Senate by proposing to force\r\nEngland to adopt free silver. It was an opportunity to strike at\r\nEngland in a vital spot; it was as statesmanlike and patriotic as\r\nhis attempt to deprive the South of their representatives.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland was fighting with splendid courage to save the\r\ncountry from free silver, caring nothing for politics and animated\r\nsolely by the highest and most disinterested motives, and Mr. Lodge\r\nwas thinking only of his spite. President Cleveland, said a Boston\r\npaper, deserved and had the right to expect Mr. Lodge's support,\r\ninstead of which \"we find our junior Senator introducing a\r\nlegislative proposition intended to appeal at once to the\r\nanti-British prejudices of a good many Americans, and to the desire\r\nof the then preponderating sentiment of the country to force a silver\r\ncurrency upon the American people. It was an effort to strike at\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge proposed that all imports from Great Britain or her\r\ncolonies should pay duties double those of the regular rates, and\r\nany article on the free list should be made dutiable at thirty-five\r\nper cent; these additional and discriminating duties were to remain\r\nin force until Great Britain assented to and took part in an\r\ninternational agreement \"for the coinage and use of silver.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge's free silver amendment shared the same tomb with his\r\nForce Bill; in the Senate fortunately there were men with broader\r\nvision and less passion.\r\n\r\nIn his biography in the Congressional Directory (written by\r\nhimself) and in the numerous biographies and sketches which have\r\nbeen published with such frequency (Mr. Lodge has a weakness for\r\nseeing himself in print) curiously enough no mention can be found\r\neither of the Force Bill or the attempt to coerce England with a\r\nsilver club. One can only explain this reticence by excessive\r\nmodesty.\r\n\r\nTwo years later Mr. Lodge deserted his silver allies and was as\r\nenthusiastic in support of the gold standard as he had previously\r\nbeen zealous for the purification of the civil service. A Boston\r\npaper said that he \"was made to realize, by the influences brought\r\nto bear upon him, that he must advocate the gold standard or else\r\nprovoke the active hostility of the prominent business men of this\r\nState.\" That perhaps is as infamous as anything ever written. That\r\nany influences, even those \"of the prominent business men of\r\nMassachusetts,\" could cause Mr. Lodge to swerve from his\r\nconvictions no one will believe. He must have had convictions when\r\nhe sought to drive England to a silver standard, he must have been\r\nconvinced that it was for the good of the United States as well as\r\nthe whole world, he must have satisfied himself, for Mr. Lodge\r\nnever permits his emotions to control his intelligence, that his\r\naction was wise and patriotic. But although Mr. Lodge will not\r\nsurrender his convictions he has no scruples about consistency.\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge's principles are so stern that he refused to consent to\r\nColombia being paid for the territory seized by President\r\nRoosevelt. Mr. Lodge made a report (this was when Mr. Wilson was\r\nPresident, and I mention it merely as an historical fact) in which\r\nhe denounced Colombia's claim as blackmail, resented it as an\r\ninsult to the memory of Mr. Roosevelt, and declared in approved\r\ncopybook fashion (being fond of platitudes), that friendship\r\nbetween nations cannot be bought. Later (this was when Mr. Harding\r\nwas President, and I mention it merely as an historical fact) as\r\nChairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, he brought in a\r\nreport urging the ratification of the treaty, and discovered that\r\nMr. Roosevelt had really been in favor of the treaty, expunged the\r\nunpleasant word blackmail from his lexicon, and sapiently observed,\r\nso impossible is it for him not to indulge in platitudes, that\r\nsometimes a nation has to pay more for a thing than it is really\r\nworth; a reflection that would have done credit to the oracular\r\nwisdom of Captain Jack Bunsby.\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge attacked the treaty of peace with Germany while it was\r\nstill in process of negotiation and severely criticised Mr. Wilson\r\nfor not having consulted the Senate. That the Senate has no right\r\nto ask about the details of a treaty before the President sends it\r\nin for ratification is a constitutional axiom which Mr. Lodge, with\r\nhis customary mental infidelity, caressed at one time and spurned\r\nat another.\r\n\r\nWhen the treaty with Spain was before the Senate (that was when Mr.\r\nMcKinley was President, and I mention it merely as an historical\r\nfact) it was attacked by some of the Democrats. To silence these\r\ncriticisms Mr. Lodge said, \"We have no possible right to break\r\nsuddenly into the middle of a negotiation and demand from the\r\nPresident what instructions he has given to his representatives.\r\nThat part of treaty making is no concern of ours.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democrats attempted to defeat the ratification of the treaty,\r\nand if that was done, said Mr. Lodge, \"we repudiate the President\r\nand his action before the whole world, and the repudiation of the\r\nPresident in such a matter as this is, to my mind, the humiliation\r\nof the United States in the eyes of the civilized world.\" The\r\nPresident could not be sent back to say to Spain \"with bated\r\nbreath\" (even in his most solemn moments Mr. Lodge cannot resist\r\nthe commonplace) \"we believe we have been too victorious and that\r\nyou have yielded us too much and that I am very sorry that I took\r\nthe Philippines from you.\"\r\n\r\nBut that was precisely what Mr. Lodge demanded should and must be\r\ndone when Mr. Wilson brought back the peace treaty. Inconsistency,\r\nas I have before remarked, Mr. Lodge cares nothing about, but his\r\npatriotism and partisanship are so inextricably intertwined that it\r\nis always difficult to discover whether in his loftiest flights it\r\nis the patriot who pleads or the partisan who intrigues.\r\n\r\nThus, in the debate on the Spanish treaty, Mr. Lodge delivered\r\nhimself of these noble sentiments: \"I have ideals and beliefs which\r\npertain to the living present, and a faith in the future of my\r\ncountry. I believe in the American people as they are to-day and in\r\nthe civilization they have created,\" and many more beautiful words\r\nto the same effect. It was the language of a statesman with\r\naspirations and convictions. It sounded splendidly. Mr. Lodge is a\r\nclassical scholar, and one wonders whether he remembers his\r\nEpictetus: \"But you utter your elegant words only from your lips;\r\nfor this reason they are without strength and dead, and it is\r\nnauseous to listen to your exhortations and your miserable virtue;\r\nwhich is talked of everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the late Senator Wolcott, one of the most brilliant orators\r\nof his day, who explained why Mr. Lodge's oratory left men cold.\r\nWolcott was commenting on a speech delivered by Lodge a few days\r\nearlier and someone said to him that men listened to Lodge with\r\neyes undimmed.\r\n\r\n\"To bring tears from an audience,\" said Wolcott, \"the speaker must\r\nfeel tears here (and he pointed to his throat), but Lodge can speak\r\nfor an hour with nothing but saliva in his throat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge's dislike of Mr. Wilson was almost malignant. Rumor\r\nascribes it to professional jealousy. Before Mr. Wilson came into\r\nprominence Mr. Lodge was the only scholar in politics, but Mr.\r\nWilson was so far his superior in erudition, especially in Mr.\r\nLodge's chosen profession of history, that he resented being\r\ndeprived of his monopoly. Perhaps there is another reason. Mr.\r\nLodge has cherished two ambitions, neither of which has been\r\ngratified. The Presidency has been the ignis fatuus he has pursued;\r\nhe was the residuary legatee of Mr. Roosevelt's bankrupt political\r\nestate in 1916, it will be recalled; last year, after his fight on\r\nthe treaty, he considered himself the logical candidate and\r\nbelieved he had the nomination in his grasp. He has longed to be\r\nSecretary of State, and it was a bitter disappointment when Mr.\r\nHarding did not invite him to enter the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nMr. Lodge is a curious and not uninteresting study in psychology.\r\nHe has no great talent, but he is not without some ability; in his\r\nyouth he was an industrious plodder and fond of study. He has read\r\nmuch but absorbed little; he is well educated in the narrow sense\r\nof the schoolmaster, but he has no philosophic background; his is\r\nthe parasitic mind that sucks sustenance from the brains of others\r\nand gives nothing in return. He is without the slightest\r\nimagination and is devoid of all sense of humor; and without these\r\ntwo, imagination, which is the gift of the poet, and humor, which\r\nis the dower of the philosopher, no man can see life whole.\r\n\r\nHe has genius almost for misunderstanding public sentiment. To him\r\nmay be applied Junius' characterization of the Duke of Grafton: \"It\r\nis not that you do wrong by design, but that you should never do\r\nright by mistake.\"\r\n\r\nWith all these defects, the defects of heritage and environment and\r\ntemperament, so much was expected from Mr. Lodge, and so much he\r\nmight have done, that it is a disappointment he has accomplished so\r\nlittle. He has been thirty-four years in Congress, and his career\r\ncan be summed up in three achievements--the Force Bill, the attempt\r\nto wreck England by driving her to silver coinage, and the part he\r\ntook in defeating the treaty of peace with Germany. The Force Bill\r\nand the silver amendment his biographers have charitably forgotten;\r\nwill the future biographer deal as gently with the closing years of\r\nhis life? And if so, what material will the biographer have?\r\n\r\nMacaulay, reviewing Barere's Memoirs--and allowing for the\r\ndifference in time and manners and morals there is a strange\r\nsimilarity between the leader of the French Revolution and the\r\nleader of the Senate--said, \"We now propose to do him, by the\r\nblessing of God, full and signal justice.\"\r\n\r\nWe think we may say, with proper humility, that, by the blessing of\r\nGod, we have done Senator Henry Cabot Lodge full and signal\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERNARD M. BARUCH\r\n\r\n\r\nA clever woman magazine writer once asked Bernard M. Baruch for\r\nsome information about the peace treaty. The question was not in\r\nhis special field, the economic sections of the treaty, and he told\r\nher so.\r\n\r\n\"It took him one sentence to say that he could not tell me what I\r\nwanted to know,\" she described the interview afterward. \"And then\r\nhe talked to me for two hours about himself. He told me of his\r\nstart in life as a three-dollar-a-week clerk, how rich he was, his\r\nphilosophy of life; how you should recognize defeat when it was\r\ncoming, accept it before it was complete and overwhelming and start\r\nout afresh, how liberal and advanced were his social views, how\r\nwith all his wealth he was ready to accept a capital tax as perhaps\r\nthe best way out of the bog in which the war had left the world,\r\nhow democratic he was in his relations with his employees and his\r\nservants. It all seemed as amazing to him as if he were describing\r\nsomeone else, or as if it had just happened the day before.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is only to women and to journalists that men talk so\r\nfrankly about themselves, to the most romantic and best trained\r\nlistening sex and profession, who perforce survey the heights from\r\nbelow. But this young woman's experience was, I have reason to\r\nbelieve, a common one.\r\n\r\nIs it vanity? You say that a man who talks so much about himself\r\nmust be vain. To conclude that he is vain is not to understand Mr.\r\nBaruch. Is a child vain when it brings some little childish\r\naccomplishment, some infantile drawing on paper, and delightedly\r\nand frankly marvels at what he has done? It is given to children\r\nand to the naive openly to wonder at themselves without vanity,\r\nwith a deep underlying sense of humility, and in Mr. Baruch's case\r\nthe unaffected delight in himself proceeds from real humility.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-five years in the jungle of Wall Street, there\r\nis--contradictions multiply in his case--much of the child about Mr.\r\nBaruch, simple, trustful--outside of Wall Street,--incapable of\r\nconcealment,--outside of Wall Street--of that which art has taught\r\nthe rest of us to conceal. His humility makes him wonder; his\r\nnaivete makes him talk quite frankly, unrestrained by the\r\nconventions that balk others. After all, is not wondering at\r\nyourself a sign of humility? A vain man, become great by luck, by\r\nforce of circumstances, by the possession of gifts which he does\r\nnot himself fully understand, would still take himself for granted.\r\nHe would not be a romance to himself, but a solid, unassailable\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nFor Baruch the great romance is Baruch, the astonishing plaything\r\nof fate, who started life as a three-dollar-a-week broker's clerk;\r\nmade millions, lost millions, made millions again, lost millions\r\nagain; finally, still young, quit Wall Street with a fortune that\r\nleft the game of the market dull and commonplace, seeking a new\r\noccupation for his energies; became during the war next to the\r\nPresident, the most powerful man in Washington; emerged from the\r\nwar, which wrecked most reputations, with a large measure of\r\ncredit, prepared by the amazing past for an equally amazing future.\r\nA career like that makes it impossible for the man who knows it\r\nbest not to expect anything. Why not the \"Disraeli of America?\"--a\r\nphrase he once, rather confidentially, employed concerning his\r\nanticipated future.\r\n\r\nDid you ever see a portrait bust smiling, not softly with the eyes\r\nor with a slight relaxation of the mouth, but firmly, definitely,\r\nlastingly smiling, with some inward source of satisfaction? Look at\r\nJo Davidson's bust of Baruch, among the famous men at the Peace\r\nConference.\r\n\r\nI once saw the various sketches in clay that went to the making of\r\nthat portrait--the subject was proving elusive to the sculptor.\r\nThere were two obvious traits to be represented; the unusual knot\r\nin the brow between the eyes and the smile, without which it was\r\nevident that you had not Baruch. The extraordinary concentration in\r\nthe forehead was easy enough to transfer to clay; but the smile\r\nkept defying the artist. When a smile was traced in the clay it\r\nsoftened the face out of character, destroyed that intensity which\r\nthe central massing of the brow denoted; and when the smile was\r\ndeleted the face lost all its brilliance, became merely intense,\r\nconcentrated, racial, acquisitive perhaps, clearly not Mr. Baruch's\r\nface. Ultimately the sculptor succeeded in wedding a smile to that\r\nbrow, and the bust went on exhibition with those of Wilson, Foch,\r\nHouse, Clemenceau, and the others; but the union was never more\r\nthan a compromise, a marriage of convenience for the artist.\r\n\r\nThat smile is as inevitable a part of Baruch as his engaging\r\nnaivete in talking about himself. It is always there, brilliant,\r\nunrelated to circumstances. It does not spring from a sense of\r\nhumor,--Mr. Baruch, like the rest of the successful, has not a\r\nmarked sense of humor; a sense of the irony of fate he has,\r\nperhaps, but not more. It does not denote gaiety, nor sympathy, nor\r\nsatire; it is not kind nor yet unkind; it does not relax the\r\nfeatures, which remain tense as ever even when smiling; it suggests\r\nsatisfaction, self-confidence, and a secret inner source of\r\ncontentment. It is with Mr. Baruch when he is tired, or ought to be\r\ntired; the romance of Baruch is an internal spring of refreshment.\r\nIt does not leave him when he is angry, if he is ever angry; the\r\nromance of Baruch diverts him. Though always there, it is not a\r\nfixed smile, a mask, something worn for the undoing of Wall Street;\r\nit is a real smile. Somewhere subconsciously there abides the\r\npicture of the poor clerk become amazingly rich, of power in\r\nWashington, of a beckoning future with possibilities as\r\nextraordinary as the wonders of the past. Life is not logical,\r\ndull, commonplace, a tissue of cause and effect; it proceeds\r\ndelightfully by daily miracles. The American Disraeli is no further\r\naway to-day than was the Baruch of to-day from the Baruch of\r\nyesterday. Enough to account for a smile in marble, bronze, or in\r\nwhatever metal the human face is made of.\r\n\r\nTake the miracle of the War Administration. It was not vanity but\r\nhumility, the kind of humility that would have saved Wilson, that\r\nserved Mr. Baruch there. He came to Washington out of Wall Street\r\nand Wall Street is always anathema. More than that he came out of\r\nthat part of Wall Street which is beyond the pale; he did not\r\nbelong to the right monied set there; which is to be anathema with\r\nthat part of the community to which Wall Street itself is not\r\nanathema; moreover he had been unjustly accused in connection with\r\nthe famous Wall Street \"leak.\" And he entered an administration\r\nwhich was the center of much prejudice and hatred. Yet he was\r\nmodest enough, however, to assume that his personality did not\r\ncount, that it was the work to be done which mattered, and that he\r\ncould depend upon the friendliness both of the Republicans and of\r\nthe great industrial interests of the country to that work if it\r\nshould be properly done.\r\n\r\nThe belief Mr. Wilson has and a much lesser man, Hiram Johnson,\r\nhas, that men are thinking exclusively about them personally and\r\nnot about the causes they advocate or the measures they propose is\r\na more dangerous form of vanity than the habit of admiring oneself\r\naudibly. It requires colossal egotism to imagine the existence of\r\nmany enemies and Mr. Baruch is genuinely humble in the matter of\r\nenmity. After watching him during the war, in an administration\r\nwhich was enemy mad, I fancy he counts his genuine foes on the\r\nfingers of one hand. Moreover he was quite impersonal about his\r\ntask. He did not do everything himself on the theory that no one\r\nelse was quite big enough to do it. There is no practical snobbism\r\nabout him. His knowledge of the industries of the country was that\r\nof the speculator; it was not that of the practical industrialist,\r\nand he knew it.\r\n\r\nHe surrounded himself with the best men he could find. He trusted\r\nthem implicitly, his habit being not to distrust men until he finds\r\nthat they can be trusted but to trust them unless he finds that\r\nthey cannot be trusted--also a modest and naive trait. He was never\r\ntired of praising Legg, Replogle, Summers, and the other business\r\nmen whom he brought to Washington, praising himself, of course, for\r\nhis skill in choosing them--he never achieves self-forgetfulness--but\r\ngiving them full credit for the work of the War Industries Board.\r\nAnd he inspired an extraordinary loyalty among his associates, big\r\nand little. He treated the Republicans as he treated big business\r\nas if all had only one interest, above politics and personalities,\r\nand that was to win the war. And when President Wilson, in response\r\nto Republican criticism of the war organization, gave him real power\r\nto mobilize American industry, the Republicans applauded the bestowal\r\nof authority as constructive and took credit to themselves for\r\naccomplishing it.\r\n\r\nBaruch and Hoover, alone of the business men who came to Washington\r\nduring the war achieved real successes in the higher positions, and\r\nhe showed vastly the greater capacity of the two to operate in a\r\npolitical atmosphere. A man who was nothing but a Wall Street\r\nspeculator, not an industrial organizer, organized successfully the\r\nbiggest industrial combination the world has ever seen; a man who\r\nwas suspect of American business got on admirably with American\r\nbusiness, and a man who had not been in politics accomplished the\r\nimpossible task of adjusting himself to work under political\r\nconditions. It is another chapter in the romance of Baruch.\r\n\r\nHe cannot explain it, so why should not he wonder about it quite\r\nopenly and quite delightedly, with all his engaging naivete? That\r\ninability to explain anything is one of the characteristics of Mr.\r\nBaruch. When you begin to apprehend it you begin to see why he is a\r\nromance to himself. He cannot explain himself to himself, nor to\r\nanyone else, no matter how much he tries. And even more, he cannot\r\nexplain his opinions, his conclusions, his decisions to anyone in\r\nthe world with all the words at his command. He can never give\r\nreasons. Mentally nature has left him, after a manner, incommunicado.\r\nHis mind does not proceed as other men's minds do.\r\n\r\nThe author of the \"Mirrors of Downing Street\" describes Lord\r\nNorthcliffe's mind as \"discontinuous.\" If I had never talked to\r\nLord Northcliffe I should be led to suppose that his mind resembled\r\nMr. Baruch's. But the British journalist's mental operations are a\r\nmodel of order and continuity compared to those of the former\r\nAmerican War Industries Chairman. Like the heroes of the ancient\r\npoems Mr. Baruch's mind has the faculty of invisibility. You see it\r\nhere; a moment later you see it there, and for the life of you\r\ncannot tell how it got from here to there, a gift of incalculability\r\nwhich must have been of great service in Wall Street, but which does\r\nnot promote understanding nor communication. And the more Mr. Baruch\r\ntries to give you the connecting links between here and there the\r\nworse off you are, both of you.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary mind is logical and is confined within the three\r\ndimensions of the syllogism. You watch it readily enough shut in\r\nits little cage whose walls are the major premise, the minor\r\npremise, and the conclusion. There is no escape as we say, from the\r\nconclusion. There is no escape anywhere.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Baruch's mind escapes easily. It possesses the secret of\r\nsome fourth mental dimension, known only to the naive and the\r\nillogical, or perhaps supralogical. He has brilliant intuitions,\r\nhunches, premonitions, the acute perceptions of some two or three\r\nextra senses that have been bred or schooled out of other men.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he is like Lloyd George, who is not logical but achieves\r\nhis successes through two or three senses which ordinary men have\r\nnot; however, unlike Lloyd George, he cannot simulate logic and,\r\nafter jumping to his conclusions, reduce them to the understanding\r\nof the three-dimensional mind. It is a grief to him that he cannot;\r\nfor if he could make a speech, that is to say, translate himself,\r\nthat figure of Disraeli would, he thinks, be less remote. But when\r\nyour mental operations are a succession of miracles, you may have\r\nbrilliant intuitions and extraordinary prevision about the mineral\r\nsupplies necessary to win the war,--which he had--you may have\r\nwonder, like the naive and the poets, about that extraordinary\r\nthing yourself, or about that still more extraordinary thing which\r\nis life or destiny, but you cannot move the masses.\r\n\r\nStill there are compensations. A perfectly logical mind would have\r\nexplained all the wonder away, reduced the miracle of personality\r\nto a stolid operation of cause and effect, quite self-approbatively\r\nno doubt, and made Mr. Baruch talk of himself as the rest of the\r\ngreat do, modestly, after this fashion: \"Behold me! I am what I am\r\nbecause when I was nine years old I saved nine cents and resolved\r\nthen and there always to save as many cents each year as I was\r\nyears old. Young man, SAVE!\"\r\n\r\nThere is no fun in being not a wonder but a copy book. And a\r\nperfectly logical mind would flirt with Disraeli warily. It would\r\nsay, \"One does not at fifty change from business to politics with\r\nsuccess. Disraeli didn't start out in Wall Street. As the Germans\r\nsay, 'what will become vinegar sours early.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Baruch slips easily through the three sides of this reasoning.\r\nLife is not logical. Fate is not logical. He is not logical.\r\n\r\nHe has had his taste of public life under Wilson and he wants more.\r\nI venture to say that he would give every one of his many millions\r\nand be as poor, well, poorer than any member of the present\r\ncabinet, to be in the place Mr. Hughes occupies to-day.\r\n\r\nEveryone who knows him has heard him say that when he entered\r\noffice he resolved to quit business because he learned so much as\r\nhead of the War Industries Board that it would be improper for him\r\never to go into the market again. There is more to it than that;\r\npublic life has given him a profound distaste for mere money-making.\r\nHe wrote to Senator Kenyon the other day that he had not\r\nmade a dollar since he went to work for the government. I believe\r\nthat to be true for I have found him an extraordinarily truthful\r\nand honest man. He has that desire for public distinction which is\r\nso often characteristic of his race. He has the idealism, a\r\ncharacteristic also of the race which gave to the world two great\r\nreligions. He has the same passion for public service now that he\r\nonce had for the market. And he belongs to a race, which, in spite\r\nof all our national catholicity on the subject of races, has never\r\nyet produced its Disraeli in America, and to a party out of power,\r\nperhaps for a long time, and he spent his youth learning a trade\r\nwhich is not the trade he would follow now.\r\n\r\nAll of this accounts for his restlessness. He is still youthful and\r\nhas enormous energies and no occupation for them. He loves personal\r\npublicity and has an instinct for it, not so keen as Hoover's or\r\nWill H. Hays', but still keen.\r\n\r\nWhither shall he turn? To the organization of his party? There he\r\nmay buy the right to be lampooned and in the end, if his party\r\nsucceeds, to be introduced into the Cabinet apologetically, as Hays\r\nand Daugherty were, on the plea that the President must appoint a\r\nnumber of party workers. To the Senate? It is a body which affords\r\nescape from the boredom of small town life for men who have grown\r\nrich on the frontier or in the dull Middle West. It carries with it\r\nan excuse to live in Washington, some social position there, and a\r\ntitle envied in Marion, Reno, Butte, or Salt Lake City. Senators\r\nwho start young serve long and obediently, suppressing all their\r\nnatural instincts for self-expression, and attain if they are\r\nlucky the scant distinction of a committee chairmanship in a\r\nlegislature that has steadily tended toward submergence. To the\r\nHouse? Individuals are lost in the House. And the Presidency comes\r\nto few, and by chance.\r\n\r\nKnowing his ambition for public distinction and his wealth, men go\r\nto him every day to sell him the road to power and influence, and,\r\nif you will, public service. Let him have the Democratic\r\norganization on condition of paying its debts and financing its\r\nactivities. One faction of the Democratic party recently sought\r\ncontrol, spreading the understanding that Mr. Baruch would, in the\r\nevent of its success, open wide his pocket book. After the meeting\r\nof the National Committee at which this faction met its defeat I\r\nsaid to a prominent member of the victorious group: \"Now that you\r\nhave won you will probably get Baruch's money. He is restless,\r\neager to find an outlet for his energies, less interested in any\r\npersonality than in his party. Hang on and wait and he must come to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he replied, lowering his voice confidentially, \"That\r\nis just the way I diagnose it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at this very time the Republicans, hearing much of Mr. Baruch's\r\nmoney and its use to build up such an intensive organization for\r\nthe Democrats, as Chairman Hays with a million or two at his\r\ndisposal had erected for them, considered seriously whether or not\r\nit would not be wise themselves to occupy Mr. Baruch's energies and\r\ndivert his ambitions away from party organization. They debated\r\nputting Mr. Baruch on the commission to reorganize the executive\r\ndepartments of the government. All had their eyes on the same\r\nambition and the same wealth!\r\n\r\nSeveral daily newspapers in New York, and I know not how many\r\nmagazines and weeklies, have been offered at one time or another to\r\nMr. Baruch, for it is known that one of his ideas of public service\r\nis to own and edit a great liberal journal, a \"Manchester Guardian\"\r\nof America. But an opportunity to buy a newspaper in New York is an\r\nopportunity to invest $3,000,000 or $4,000,000, to lose $500,000 or\r\nmore for several years thereafter and to become the national figure\r\nthat Mr. Ochs is, or Mr. Reid is, or Mr. Munsey is, certainly\r\nsomething far short of the American Disraeli or even the Baruch of\r\nthe War Industries Board.\r\n\r\nMr. Baruch, you will observe, has no vulgar illusions about what\r\nmoney will buy. He likes money. It brings with it a certain\r\npersonal enlargement. It adds to the romance of himself in his own\r\neyes, as well as in the eyes of others. It procures the flattering\r\nears of journalists, and a place on front pages, and, if one\r\ninclines toward ostentation, even the ownership of a newspaper\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBut money will not buy a commanding place in public life. And even\r\nif it would buy such a place he would not be content to do other\r\nthan earn one. He wants to repeat the thrills of his youth in the\r\nmarket, in the thrills of a second youth in Washington. He is\r\nincurably romantic.\r\n\r\nTo sum him all up in a sentence--he has an extraordinary sense of\r\nwonder and an unequalled sense of reality, the sense of wonder\r\ndirected toward himself, the sense of reality directed largely but\r\nnot exclusively elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIHU ROOT\r\n\r\n\r\nElihu Root might have been so much publicly and has been so little\r\nthat a moral must hang somewhere upon his public career.\r\n\r\nHe might have been many things. He might have been President of the\r\nUnited States if his party ever could have been persuaded to\r\nnominate him. He might have been one of the great Chief Justices of\r\nthe Supreme Court if a President could have been persuaded to\r\nappoint him. He might have given to the United States Senate that\r\nweight and influence which have disappeared from it, if he had had\r\na passion for public service. He might have been Secretary of State\r\nin the most momentous period of American foreign relations if a\r\ncertain homely instinct in Mr. Harding had not led him to prefer\r\nthe less brilliant Mr. Hughes. He might have made history. But he\r\nhas not. Out of his eight years in the Cabinet and six years in the\r\nSenate nothing constructive came that will give his name a larger\r\nplace in history than that of Rufus Choate, another remarkable\r\nadvocate who was once Attorney General.\r\n\r\nDistrust has always barred his way, distrust of a mind and\r\ncharacter to which problems appear as exercises in ingenuity rather\r\nthan questions of right and justice. His greatest opportunity for\r\nconstructive statesmanship was offered in the making of the New\r\nYork State constitution. But when it became known that Mr. Root had\r\ndominated the Constitutional Convention, that the proposed\r\nconstitution was Mr. Root's constitution, that was enough; the\r\nvoters rejected it in the referendum.\r\n\r\nDistrust spoiled the mission to Russia during the war. The Russians\r\ndistrusted him while he was with them. President Wilson distrusted\r\nhis report when he returned. And Mr. Wilson's successor equally\r\ndistrusted him when he chose a man to finish the work which Mr.\r\nWilson had badly done or to correct the work that Mr. Wilson had\r\nleft undone at Paris.\r\n\r\nLight on President Harding's attitude toward Mr. Root is thrown by\r\nan incident at Marion during the campaign. The Republican candidate\r\nhad made his speech of August 28th in which he indicated his views\r\nupon the League of Nations. Two days later a newspaper arrived in\r\nMarion containing a dispatch from abroad where Mr. Root then was,\r\nat work upon the international court.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent represented Mr. Root as \"amazed\" at the position\r\nMr. Harding had taken.\r\n\r\nThe candidate came to the headquarters early that morning. One of\r\nthe headquarters attaches handed him a copy of the paper. Mr.\r\nHarding read the dispatch and was angry.\r\n\r\n\"That man Root,\" he exclaimed, \"has done more harm to the\r\nRepublican party than any other man in it! He is always pursuing\r\nsome end of his own or of some outside interest.\" He started away;\r\nthen turned back, still angry, and added: \"You remember the Panama\r\nCanal tolls incident. That was an example of the kind of trouble he\r\nhas always been making for the party.\"\r\n\r\nMany reasons have been given why the President passed over the\r\nobvious man for Secretary of State. Mr. Root himself, who would\r\nhave taken the place gladly as an opportunity for his extremely\r\nkeen intelligence, but who did not seek it, thinks that the Senate,\r\nflushed with its recent victory over Mr. Wilson and desiring itself\r\nto dominate foreign relations, conspired to prevent his choice. The\r\nSenators did oppose Mr. Root, but their lack of influence with the\r\nPresident has been sufficiently exposed by events.\r\n\r\nThe real obstacle to Mr. Root's appointment was Mr. Harding's\r\ndistrust of him, the instinctive feeling of a simple direct nature\r\nagainst a mind too quick, too clever, too adroit, too invisible in\r\nmany of its operations. Mr. Harding, being commonplace himself,\r\nlikes a more commonplace kind of greatness than Mr. Root's. Those\r\nwho were close to him said the President feared that Mr. Root would\r\n\"put something over on him.\" A certain moral quality in Mr. Hughes\r\noutweighed Mr. Root's special experience and wider reputation.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt used to tell a story boastfully of his own\r\npracticality which throws much light on Mr. Root and upon the\r\nreason for Mr. Root's comparative failure as a public man.\r\n\r\n\"When I took Panama,\" he would say, \"I found all the members of my\r\nCabinet helpful except one. Mr. Root readily found numerous\r\nprecedents. Mr. Taft was sympathetic and gave every assistance\r\npossible. Mr. Knox alone was silent. At last I turned to him in the\r\nCabinet meeting and I said, 'I should like to hear from the\r\nAttorney General on the legality of what we are doing.' Mr. Knox\r\nlooked up and said, 'Mr. President, if I were you I should not have\r\nthe slightest taint of legality about the whole affair.'\"\r\n\r\nSuch was Mr. Root. Public questions always were likely to occur to\r\nhim first as exercises in mental adroitness rather than as moral\r\nproblems. His extremely agile mind finds its chief pleasure in its\r\nown agility. Then he was always the advocate, always instinctively\r\ndevoting himself to bolstering up another man's cause for him.\r\n\r\n\"He is a first class second,\" said Senator Penrose, objecting to\r\nhim as a candidate for President at the Republican Convention of\r\n1916, \"but he is not his own man.\"\r\n\r\nHe is always someone else's mouthpiece and publicly he is chiefly\r\nremembered as Mr. Roosevelt's mouthpiece. When he came to New York\r\nand made the speech that elected Hughes Governor and made possible\r\nHughes as Secretary of State he said, \"I speak for the President.\"\r\nHe equally spoke for the President when he delivered that other\r\nremembered address, warning the States that unless they mended\r\ntheir ways the Federal Government would absorb their vitality.\r\n\r\nThe law is a parasitic profession and Mr. Root's public career is\r\nparasitic. He lacks originality, he lacks passion--there is no\r\nplace for passion in that clear mind--he lacks force. He elucidates\r\nother men's ideas, works out or puts into effect their policies,\r\npresents their case, is, by temperament, by reason of gifts\r\namounting almost to genius, of defects that go with those gifts\r\nalways and everywhere, the lawyer. His public career has been\r\ncontrolled by this circumstance.\r\n\r\nI doubt if he ever had a real love of public life. He turned to it\r\nlate, after he had made his success in the profession of his\r\nchoice, and he carried over into it the habits of the law. He\r\nalways seemed to be taking cases for the public. He took a case for\r\nMr. McKinley as Secretary of War because the War Department needed\r\nreorganization and the case promised to be interesting. He took a\r\ncase for Mr. Roosevelt as Secretary of State because Mr. Roosevelt\r\nwas the most interesting client in the world. He took a case for\r\nNew York State, to remodel its constitution, a case that ended\r\ndisastrously. He took a case for Mr. Wilson in Russia and another,\r\nthe League of Nations, to form its international court for it. He\r\nwas willing to take a case for Mr. Harding to make a going concern\r\nof the world for him following the smash-up of the war, something\r\nlike the task of counsel of a receivership, the most interesting\r\nreceivership of all time.\r\n\r\nFor a few years Mr. Roosevelt made public life interesting to Mr.\r\nRoot who, it looked then, might devote the rest of his career to\r\nnational affairs.\r\n\r\nIt was a sparkling period for America. We have never had an \"age\"\r\nin the history of this country like the age of Elizabeth or the age\r\nof Louis XIV, or the age of Lorenzo, the Magnificent; time is too\r\nshort and democracy too rigid for such splendors; but the nearest\r\nequivalent to one was the \"age,\" let us call it that, of Theodore\r\nRoosevelt. There was the central figure--an age must have a central\r\nfigure--a buoyant personality with a Renaissance zest for life, and\r\na Renaissance curiosity about all things known, and unknown, and a\r\nboundless capacity for vitalizing everyone and everything with\r\nwhich he came in contact.\r\n\r\nDull moments were unknown. Knighthood was once more in flower,\r\nwearing frock coats and high hats and reading all about itself in\r\nthe daily press. Lances were tilted at malefactors of great wealth,\r\nin jousts where few were unhorsed and no blood spilled. Fair\r\nmaidens of popular rights were rescued; great deeds of valor done.\r\nLegends were created, the legend of Leonard Wood, somewhat damaged\r\nin the last campaign, the legend of the Tennis Cabinet, with its\r\nGarfields and its Pinchots, now to be read about only in the black\r\nletter books of the early twentieth century, and the legend of\r\nElihu Root, still supported in a measure by the evidences of his\r\nhighly acute intelligence, but still like everything else of those\r\nbright days, largely a legend.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt, the Magnificent, made men great with a word, and his\r\nwords were many. His great were many likewise, great statesmen,\r\ngreat public servants, great writers, great magazine editors, great\r\ncowboys from the West, great saints and great sinners, great\r\ncombinations of wealth and great laws to curb them; everything in\r\nscale and that a great scale. Mr. Root acquired his taste for\r\npublic life in that \"age\" just as Mr. Hoover, Mr. Baruch and a\r\ndozen others did theirs in the moving period of the Great War. It\r\nis easy to understand how.\r\n\r\nLike all remarkable ages this age was preceded by discoveries. The\r\nUnited States had just fought a war which had ended in a great\r\nvictory, over Spain. The American people were elated by their\r\nachievement, aware of their greatness, talked much and surely of\r\n\"destiny,\" the period in Washington being but a reflection of their\r\nown mood. Their mental horizon had been immensely widened by the\r\npossession, gained in the war, of some islands in the Pacific whose\r\nexistence we had never heard of before.\r\n\r\nUntil that time there had been for us only two nations in the\r\nworld, the United States and England, the country with which we had\r\nfought two wars, and innumerable national campaigns. Historically\r\nthere had of course been another country as friendly as England had\r\nsometimes been inimical, France, but France had ceased to be a\r\nnation and became a succession of revolutions.\r\n\r\nManila Bay had been a series of revelations, besides teaching us\r\nthat Philippines is spelled with two \"ps\" and only one \"l.\" We had\r\nthere discovered Germany, a country whose admirals had bad sea\r\nmanners. We knew at once that our next war would be with Germany,\r\nalthough the day before Dewey said, \"You may fire when you are\r\nready, Gridley,\" we would as soon have thought that our next war\r\nwould be with Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThere too we had an interesting and surprising experience with\r\nEngland, hitherto known chiefly for her constant designs on the\r\nnational dinner pail. She behaved in striking and pleasing contrast\r\nwith Germany. Blood, on that bright day, May 1, 1898, began to be\r\nthicker than water. Learning once more had come out of the East.\r\nFrom Manila Bay flowed such a tide of new ideas, such a\r\nreassessment of old conceptions as had not visited the world since\r\nthe discovery of Greek and Latin letters put an end to the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nPerceiving our widened interest, John Hay, as Secretary of State,\r\ntook our foreign relations on a grand Cook's tour of the world. He\r\nshowed us Europe and the Orient. In honor of Manila Bay he invented\r\nthat brilliant fiction, the \"open door\" in the East. Turning our\r\nattention to the world we discovered the General Staff. Hitherto\r\nour army had fought mostly with the scattered Indian tribes of the\r\nWest and you cannot use a General Staff in conducting six separate\r\nwars at once, each no bigger than a good-sized riot. But as Admiral\r\nPerry had opened the eyes of the Hermit Kingdom of Japan, so\r\nAdmiral whatever-his-name-was who consented to be sunk by Dewey,\r\nthe unremembered hero of this great enlightenment, had opened the\r\neyes of this Hermit Republic of the West to the world across the\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nWe had to have a General Staff. Mr. Root, as Secretary of War, gave\r\nus one, faithfully copied from the best European models. Roosevelt,\r\nthe Magnificent, stood by and said \"Bully.\" Everything was of this\r\norder; so it was to a tremendously interesting job that Mr. Root\r\nsucceeded when he took the place of John Hay as Secretary of State.\r\nThe mood of the hour was expansive and a luminous personality\r\npervaded the national life.\r\n\r\nBut public service cannot always be so interesting as it is at its\r\nfullest moments. The luminous personality went out. And Mr. Root's\r\nnext experience, in the United States Senate, was disillusioning.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is a body in which you grow old, ungracefully waiting\r\nfor dead men's shoes. The infinite capacity for taking pains which\r\nSenators have is not genius. If the gods have been good to you, as\r\nthey were to Henry Cabot Lodge, you enter the upper house young, a\r\nscholar and idealist, with the hope of the Presidency as the reward\r\nof generous service. Where the race is to the slow you lay aside\r\nyour winged gifts one by one and your ambition centers finally not\r\non the Presidency but on some committee chairmanship clung to by a\r\npertinacious octogenarian.\r\n\r\nHope deferred makes you avaricious of little favors, until when a\r\nBritish journalist writes of you as one did of Henry Cabot Lodge,\r\nmaking his speech before the last Republican national convention at\r\nChicago, that you \"looked like an elderly peer addressing a labor\r\ngathering,\" your cup of happiness, is full to the brim, as Henry\r\nCabot Lodge's was,--whether because you are compared to a lord or\r\nbecause other people, lesser than Senators, are put into their\r\nproper inferior place. Mr. Lodge is the perfect flower of the\r\nSenate. It is a flower that does not bloom in a night. It is almost\r\na century plant.\r\n\r\nInto this Senate came Mr. Root, full stature, as he might walk into\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, preceded by his reputation.\r\nOn Olympus one may spring full grown like Minerva from the head of\r\nJove. But not in the Senate, where strong prejudice exists against\r\nany kind of cerebral generation. A young Senator from Ohio, Mr.\r\nHarding, arrived in the upper House early enough to see the portent\r\nof Mr. Root there. He keeps to this day a sense of its unbecomingness.\r\n\r\nFrom his desk on the floor Mr. Root talked to the country, but the\r\nSenate did not listen. One does not speak in the Senate by the\r\nauthority of intellect or of personality. One speaks by the\r\nauthority of dead men's shoes.\r\n\r\nNot being a big committee chairman, Mr. Root was not of counsel in\r\nthe big cases. He tried to associate himself with counsel but the\r\ntraditions of the Senate and the jealousy of Senators were against\r\nhim. He had not the passion for public service that makes Reed\r\nSmoot and Wesley Jones miraculously patient with the endless\r\ndetails of legislation. After six years he quit.\r\n\r\n\"I am tired of it,\" he said to Senator Fall, \"the Senate is doing\r\nsuch little things in such a little way.\" It was different from\r\npublic life under Roosevelt where one did not notice size of what\r\nthey did--one has not yet noticed the size of what they did--for\r\nthe grandeur of the way they did it.\r\n\r\nI have said that Mr. Root's mind with its advocate's bent always\r\noccupied itself with the justification of other men's views, his\r\nchief's or his party's. There was one notable exception, his break\r\nwith the Republicans while he was in the Senate on the question of\r\ndiscriminating in favor of American shipping through the Panama\r\nCanal. A clever lawyer's argument can be made that when the United\r\nStates said \"all nations\" in its treaty with Great Britain\r\nregarding the Canal it meant all nations except itself. But Mr.\r\nRoot declined to make it, holding that plain morality and a greater\r\nrespect for the obligations of a treaty than Bethman Hollweg\r\nexpressed when he called them scraps of paper required this country\r\nto charge just the same tolls for American ships using the canal as\r\nfor British ships or any other ships using it.\r\n\r\nThe general Republican argument is that thus interpreted, the\r\nHay-Pauncefote treaty is so foolish and so inconvenient a treaty that\r\nMr. Hay must not have meant what he said when he wrote it, and\r\nreally did mean something that he wholly failed to say. The reasons\r\nfor contending that Mr. Hay meant no tolls for the United States\r\nand tolls for England, when he wrote the same tolls for everybody\r\nare highly ingenious and as it was a Democratic President who was\r\nasserting that Mr. Hay used language in its ordinary sense, Mr.\r\nRoot as a Republican might have been expected to declare that Mr.\r\nHay used it in quite the reverse of its ordinary sense. But he did\r\nnot. He supported the Democratic President and treated the\r\nRepublican position as if it had not the slightest taint of\r\nlegality in it, to the lasting shock of Mr. Harding, on whose side\r\nthe precedents are, for nations do say \"all nations,\" and are later\r\nfound to mean all nations but themselves when their virtuous\r\npromises to make no exceptions in their own favor turn out to be\r\ninconvenient.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Root took a high moral stand on the treaty it was said\r\namong Republican Senators that he was thinking more of the\r\ntranscontinental railroads which were fighting competition by water\r\nthan he was of the sanctity of international engagements. The\r\nprobability is that he was probably thinking more of John Hay and\r\nElihu Root than he was of either. He was in the Cabinet when John\r\nHay as Secretary of State made the treaty. Senator Lodge, the only\r\nother Senator to agree with Mr. Root and disagree with his party\r\nabout the meaning of all nations, was John Hay's closest friend.\r\nProbably both of them, intimately associated with Mr. Hay, had\r\ntheir part in the making of the treaty. They had perhaps the\r\nsensitiveness of authors about their capacity to say exactly what\r\nthey meant. They wanted to recognize their own international piece\r\nwhen it was put on the stage by the commercially minded producers\r\nof the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty is interesting and\r\nunfamiliar. Attaching Pauncefote's name to the treaty was a\r\ndelicate act of international courtesy since there is Pauncefote's\r\nword for it, privately spoken, that he had nothing to do with the\r\nwriting of it.\r\n\r\nHay draughted the treaty by himself probably with the cognizance of\r\nRoot and Lodge, the great lawyer who was his associate in the\r\nCabinet and his closest personal friend in the Capitol. Hay then\r\nhanded it to Pauncefote, the British minister here. Pauncefote\r\ntransmitted it to the foreign office in London which received it\r\nwith surprise and probably with satisfaction, for the Clayton-Bulwer\r\ntreaty which it in a sense revived, had been forgotten for nearly\r\nhalf a century. Delay is the rule of foreign offices.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Hay's treaty was not so generous as it seemed on first\r\nreading, a suspicion which seems to have been justified by the\r\ninterpretation put upon it by the final authority upon international\r\nengagements, the Republican National Convention at Chicago. And if\r\nit was as generous as it seemed let not America think Great Britain\r\ntoo eager in accepting it, let America pay a little to overcome the\r\nreluctance of Great Britain in setting her approval upon the new\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nAt last, after much apparent hesitation, the foreign office agreed\r\nto the new treaty in consideration of America's throwing in, with\r\nit an arbitration of the Bering Sea dispute. President Roosevelt\r\ninterpreted Mr. Hay's arbitration contract much as the Republican\r\nNational Convention interpreted Mr. Hay's treaty, by appointing\r\nAmerican arbitrators who promised beforehand, in giving a fair and\r\nimpartial hearing to the Canadian claims, always to vote for the\r\nAmerican position and to resign and be succeeded by others if they\r\nfound that they could not do so.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, the prevailing distrust of Mr. Root? His public morals\r\nregarding the Hay-Pauncefote treaty were better than those of his\r\nparty, even if we accept the view that they were dictated by\r\nnothing more than a certain mental integrity, a certain consistency\r\nwith himself. He was as virtuous in the taking of the Panama Canal\r\nas the virtuous Mr. Roosevelt. He had the advocate's honesty of\r\nbeing true to his client, whether his client was the public or the\r\ngreat corporations. Mentality was uppermost in him, so that he took\r\nprimarily a logical rather than a moral view of all questions; but\r\nalso so much that he could not pretend, could not act, and thus he\r\nwas more honest than the politicians.\r\n\r\nHis statesmanship was discontinuous, being an interesting avocation\r\nrather than a career. Of it little has been permanent. His General\r\nStaff soon lapsed into incompetence; if it had not, it might have\r\nbeen the danger to American national life that the German General\r\nStaff was to German national life. Recently it was merged with the\r\nhigh command. As Secretary of State he was not creative, Mr.\r\nHarding turning back to the solid ground of American international\r\npolicy, rested upon John Hay's open door and Knox's dollar\r\ndiplomacy. Root in foreign relations merely succeeded with the\r\nSenate where Hay had failed. Always the advocate, he takes other\r\nmen's ideas, Hay's or Wilson's and justifies them or makes them\r\npractical. His New York constitution failed, being unjustly\r\nsuspected. His world court has little better hope of acceptance,\r\nfor Mr. Hughes is not a voluntary sharer of glory.\r\n\r\nIn spite of it all, some greatness remains, the impression of a\r\npowerful though limited intelligence. His career was to give us a\r\nmoral. It is: if you have an adroit and energetic mind you will\r\nfind public affairs uninteresting; except in their occasional\r\nphases. If you have such a mind and must enter politics, hide it;\r\notherwise democracy will distrust you. Whatever you do, be dull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIRAM JOHNSON\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram Johnson would have enjoyed the French Revolution, if accident\r\nhad made him radical at that time. He would have been stirred by\r\nthe rising of the people; he would have given tongue to their\r\ngrievances in a voice keyed to lash them to greater fury. He would\r\nhave been excited by it as he never has been by the little risings\r\nof the masses which he has made vocal. In all the noisy early\r\nphases of it, he would have made the loudest noise. And he would\r\nhave gone to the block when the real business of the revolution\r\nbegan with the fanatics at its helm.\r\n\r\nIn the Russian Revolution, he would have been a Kerensky; and he\r\nwould have fled when the true believers in change arrived. He is\r\nthe orator of emeutes, who is fascinated by a multitude in a\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nJohnson is not a revolutionary. Not in the least, not any more than\r\nHenry Cabot Lodge is. But revolution has a fierce attraction for\r\nhim. He once said to me, speaking bitterly during the campaign, of\r\nMr. Harding's prospective election, \"The war has set back the\r\npeople for a generation. They have bowed to a hundred repressed\r\nacts. They have become slaves to the government. They are\r\nfrightened at the excesses in Russia. They are docile; and they\r\nwill not recover from being so for many years. The interests which\r\ncontrol the Republican party will make the most of their docility.\r\nIn the end, of course, there will be a revolution, but it will not\r\ncome in my time.\"\r\n\r\nThat \"it will not come in my time\" was said in a tone of regret. It\r\nwas not so much that the Senator wanted revolution. I do not\r\nbelieve he did. But he wanted his chance, that outburst of popular\r\nresentment which would bring him to the front, with the excitement,\r\nthe sense of power that would come from the response of the nation\r\nwhen his angry voice translated into words its elemental passion.\r\n\r\nTurbulent popular feeling is breath in Johnson's nostrils. Twice he\r\nhas thoroughly enjoyed its intoxication.\r\n\r\nHis political life was blank paper when the tumult of popular\r\nindignation swept California at the time Francis J. Heney, who was\r\nprosecuting the San Francisco grafters, was shot in the court room.\r\nHe had thought nothing politically, he had felt nothing\r\npolitically. He had neither convictions, nor passions, nor morals,\r\npolitically speaking. He grew up in soil which does not produce\r\nlofty standards. Something of the mining-camp spirit still hung\r\nover California, which had been settled by adventurers, forty-niners,\r\ngold seekers, men who had left the East to \"make a new start\" where\r\nthere was pay dirt. The State had a wild zest for life which was\r\nuntrammeled by Puritanism. San Francisco had its Barbary Coast\r\nand in every restaurant its private dining rooms for women.\r\nJohnson himself was sprung from a father who was a \"railroad\r\nlawyer,\" the agent of privileges in procuring special favors, by\r\nmethods once well known, from the state legislature. The atmosphere\r\nof his youth was not one to develop a sensitive conscience or a\r\nhigh conception of public morals.\r\n\r\nJohnson at this time was a practicing attorney, not noted for the\r\nquality of his community service. The administration of San\r\nFrancisco had been a scandal for years. Few cared. It was a\r\n\"corrupt and contented\" city. The corruption grew worse. Lower and\r\nmeaner grafters rose to take the place of the earlier and more\r\nrobust good fellows who trafficked in the city o' shame. Graft lost\r\nclass, and lost caste. It was ultimately exposed in all its\r\nshocking indecency. The light and licentious town developed a\r\nconscience. Public indignation arose and reached its height, when\r\nthe grafters ventured too far in the shooting of the attorney\r\ncharged with their prosecution.\r\n\r\nJohnson then felt for the first time something he had never felt\r\nbefore--the stirring of the storm of angry popular feeling. It woke\r\nsomething in him, something that he did not know existed before--his\r\ninstinct for the expression of public passion; his love of the\r\nplatform with yelling multitudes in front of him.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself into the fray on the side of civic virtue. The\r\ndisturbance to the complacency of San Francisco disturbed the\r\ncomplacency of the State, which had calmly endured misgovernment\r\nfor many years. Misgovernment procured by the railroad, the public\r\nutility corporations, the other combinations of wealth, through\r\ntheir agents, and through the corrupt politicians. Johnson became\r\nthe spokesman of public protest and the reform governor of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nAfter that came battling for the Lord at Armageddon--the most\r\nintoxicating experience in American political history, for a man of\r\nJohnson's temperament. It was a revolution, not in a government,\r\nbut in a party. Bonds were loosed. Immense personal enlargement\r\ncame to those who had known the ties of regularity. It was an hour\r\nof freedom, unbridled political passion, unrestrained political\r\nutterance. Docility did not exist. Vast crowds thrilled with new\r\nhopes yelled themselves hoarse over angry words.\r\n\r\nAssociation with Roosevelt on the Progressive ticket lifted Johnson\r\nfrom a local to a national importance. The whole country was the\r\naudience which leaped at his words. It was a revolution in tittle,\r\na taste, a sample of what the real thing would be, with its\r\nbreaking of restraints, its making of the mob a perfect instrument\r\nto play upon, its unleashing of passion to which to give tongue.\r\nJohnson has felt its wild stimulation and like a man who has used\r\ndrugs the habit is upon him.\r\n\r\nMoreover, his one chance lies that way. I have said that he is, by\r\naccident, radical. Let us imagine a great outburst of popular\r\npassion for reaction. And suppose that Johnson was, when it\r\narrived, a political blank, as he was when Heney was shot. Johnson\r\nwould have raised his angry voice against radicalism, just as\r\nreadily as for it.\r\n\r\nThe essential thing with him is popular passion, not a political\r\nphilosophy. He has no political philosophy. He has no real\r\nconvictions. He does not reason or think deeply. His mentality is\r\nslight. He is the voice of many; instinctively he gives tongue to\r\nwhat the many feel; that is all.\r\n\r\nSuppose the strong-lunged Californian were a political blank, just\r\nreaching the national consciousness, when the reaction against\r\nWilson began and when the public swung to conservatism.\r\n\r\nYou know those vast tin amplifiers employed in big convention\r\nhalls, or in out-door meetings, to carry the voice of the speaker\r\nto the remotest depths of the audience; Johnson is a vast tin\r\namplifier of the voice of the mass. When the people had become\r\n\"docile\" he would have thundered \"docility\" to the uttermost bounds\r\nof the universe, if he had not by earlier utterances been\r\ndefinitely placed on the side opposed to docility.\r\n\r\nBut he had been definitely placed in the battle of Armageddon. A\r\nthousand ennuies located him for all political time. No convictions\r\nhold him where he is in case there be profit in changing sides;\r\nother men habitually conservative would have the preference over\r\nhim on the other side. In this sense he is accidently radical,\r\naccidently because he happened to emerge in politics at a radical\r\nmoment. That takes into account only the mental background of his\r\npolitical position. There is an element that was not chance. Public\r\npassion is almost invariably radical, springing as it does from the\r\nresentment of inequality, and Johnson is the tongue of public\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nIs he dangerous? He is, only if public passion becomes dangerous\r\nand only up to the point where the speakers of revolution pass from\r\nthe stage and the doers of it rig up their chopping blocks. At\r\npresent he furnishes the words, the ugly words, which men throw\r\ninstead of stones at the objects of their hate. He is the safety\r\nvalve of gathering passion. Men listen to him and feel that they\r\nhave done something to vindicate their rights. They applaud him to\r\nshake the roof, and vote for Mr. Harding.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to speak of his magnetism over crowds. He has no\r\nmagnetism in personal contact. He walks toward you as if he were\r\nabout to deliver a blow, an impression that is strengthened by his\r\nsquare menacing figure. His voice is unpleasant. His smile is wry.\r\nHe not unusually has a complaint to make against the public,\r\nagainst the press, against fate, against you personally. He is not\r\ninterested in people, as Roosevelt was to so an amazing degree, and\r\nas magnetic persons usually are. He is cold, hard, and selfish. His\r\nquarrels are numerous, with the campaign managers of the Armageddon\r\nfight, with his own campaign manager of 1920, with the newspaper\r\ncorrespondents. He is habitually pessimistic, and pessimism and\r\nmagnetism do not go together.\r\n\r\nHis complaint that the people were docile and would not recover\r\ntheir confidence and self-assertion in his time, was a bit of his\r\ninevitable gloom. His dark habit of thought hung over his campaign\r\nfor the presidential nomination of 1920, preventing his making a\r\nreal effort in many states, and lay in the way of his success. He\r\nhas few friends, love having been left out of his make-up. I do not\r\nspeak of family affection--but love in its larger implications.\r\nThose who surround him--clerks and secretaries--have the air of\r\nrepressed, starving personalities.\r\n\r\nThat which gathers the crowds and sets them shouting is not his\r\nmagnetism but the perfect expression of their passion. For them and\r\nfor it he is a sounding board. His voice with its hard angry tone,\r\nits mechanical rise and fall, has the ring of a hundred guillotines\r\nin operation. Having little culture, unintellectual, he is\r\nprimitive as the mass before him. He talks their language and an\r\ninstinct all his own gives him an exact sense of their emotions.\r\n\r\nAnd what he says leaves the impression of tremendous sincerity. His\r\nsincerity does not arise from reasoned convictions but from hatred;\r\ndeep and abiding hatred.\r\n\r\nSenator Borah once said, \"The difference between Johnson and me is\r\nthat I regard questions from the point of view of principles while\r\nhe regards them from the point of view of personalities. When a man\r\nopposes me I do not become angry at him. On the next issue he may\r\nagree with me. When a man opposes Johnson he hates him. He feels\r\nthat the opposition is directed personally against him, not against\r\nthe policy that separates them.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson's opponents are the elements of reaction, the malefactors\r\nof great wealth, the supporters of that social inequality which the\r\ncrowd resents. They stood in his path in California. They made\r\nimpossible his nomination at Chicago. When the bitter enders,\r\nduring the treaty fight, planned to send him on a tour of the\r\ncountry, these monied men closed their pocketbooks, exclaiming to\r\nSenator Knox, \"What do you mean to do? Advertise this man Johnson\r\nand make him the Republican candidate for President? Not with our\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\nOnly the raising of a fund by Senator McCormick and some of the old\r\nProgressives, gave him his chance to speak. He hates them and when\r\nhe attacks them it is with all the force and sincerity of his soul.\r\nIt is no mere question of hatred, such as Roosevelt would employ to\r\ndramatize and make personal the issues he was representing to the\r\npeople; it is bitter, revengeful detestation. It makes Johnson the\r\nmost sincere man before the country to-day. And that pessimistic\r\nstrain in his nature causes the darkness of his diatribe to seem\r\nall the more true.\r\n\r\nBut he swallows for expediency as other men swallow their\r\nconvictions for it, and wrath is the bitterer dose. During the 1920\r\ncampaign he trafficked with Senator Penrose, the representative of\r\nhated wealth, for support at Chicago, offering, it has not been\r\ndisclosed what considerations, for his aid.\r\n\r\nHe was ready at that time to take back his speech advocating the\r\ngovernment ownership of railroads, a gesture against \"the\r\ninterests,\" made at the bidding of Hearst, at the beck of whose\r\nagents he is prone to bestir himself.\r\n\r\nIt must be an irksome livery, that of Hearst, for he hates all\r\nservice and overshadowing. Equally irksome is his service to\r\nregularity under the rod of the Republican party. But he bows to\r\nit, and supports Harding whom he hates. He bobs up like a\r\nJack-in-the-box and makes his laudatory speech whenever the name of\r\nRoosevelt comes up, though in his heart he must reverence none too\r\ndeeply that overshadowing personality.\r\n\r\nHe has no roots except in the mob and no hope except in its aroused\r\nresentment against inequality. Not being interested in individuals\r\nhe has not that personal organization possessed by Roosevelt, with\r\nhis army of correspondents, friends and idolators, in every hamlet.\r\n\r\nAnd of course he has little hope of ever controlling his party\r\norganization. He is curiously alone.\r\n\r\n\"There are only three men in the world whom I trust,\" he once said\r\nto a friend. There is no reason to regard this as an exaggeration.\r\nHis attitude toward his associates in the Senate is this: \"If I\r\nwere crossing a desert with any one of them and there was only one\r\nwater bottle, I should insist upon carrying that bottle.\"\r\n\r\nOn such pessimism and distrust it is impossible to build political\r\nsuccess. It can come only when his pessimism and distrust coincide\r\nwith like pessimism and distrust in the masses. He waits the day,\r\nbut gloomily, without confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILANDER CHASE KNOX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I like Knox and I admire him tremendously, but I will not ask him\r\nto be my Secretary of State. He is too indifferent.\"\r\n\r\nThis characterization of the junior Senator from Pennsylvania,\r\nattributed to his late colleague President Harding, summarizes very\r\naptly his strength and his weakness. One can very easily admire him\r\nand, when he drops the mask of dignity, which seems almost pompous\r\nin so diminutive a figure, one cannot help liking him. But in spite\r\nof his successes,--which his enemies attribute to luck, and he\r\nprobably attributes to intellectual superiority,--he has never\r\nquite achieved greatness and will probably go down in history as\r\none of the lesser luminaries in the political heavens.\r\n\r\nKnox IS indifferent, especially to those who do not know him\r\nintimately. It is not because he has been without ambition. On the\r\ncontrary he has longed to soar like the eagle but he has the wings\r\nof the sparrow and whatever exertion he has made has ended in a\r\nfeeble and futile fluttering.\r\n\r\nI doubt if any man in public life has had so many honors thrust\r\nupon him. He has held three great offices of the Republic without\r\nso much as raising a hand for any of them. Unlike most men he did\r\nnot travel the mucky road of politics to reach Washington nor\r\ncompromise with circumstance to gain distinction. Three Presidents\r\ninvited him to sit at their cabinet tables. Three times the\r\nRepublican machine in Pennsylvania invited him to sit in the\r\nSenate. With graceful dignity he accepted all of these invitations\r\nnot, indeed, unconscious of the fact that the selection in each\r\ncase was a very happy one.\r\n\r\nI do not mean by this that he is conceited. He is merely conscious\r\nof the fact that intellectually he is somewhat superior to his\r\ncolleagues, most of whom, strangely enough, quite agree with him.\r\nThey consult him and accept his counsel with almost childlike\r\nfaith. To the mediocre politicians and provincial lawyers who\r\nconstitute the bulk of the Senate and House of Representatives, he\r\nis a figure apart, who looks upon their antics with a kindly, but\r\nnever amused, tolerance.\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing of politics,\" he said to me a short time ago. \"I\r\nhave never been interested in politics as such.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark is rather enigmatical to the average member, who would,\r\nordinarily, look upon the author as a dolt or pretender. They do\r\nnot dare to do either in the case of Mr. Knox; therefore, the\r\nconclusion that he is indifferent. Never have the men associated\r\nwith Mr. Knox questioned his capacity.\r\n\r\nRobert Lansing, when he was Secretary of State, said of him;\r\n\"Senator Lodge will not understand the treaty but he will fight for\r\nit for political reasons. Senator Knox will understand it\r\nthoroughly.\"\r\n\r\nThe observation seems almost prophetic in the light of what has\r\nsince been disclosed. Mr. Lansing's faith in Mr. Knox's judgment\r\nseems to have been fully justified. I know of no one who has held\r\nmore steadfastly the respect of colleagues in the Senate or at the\r\nCabinet table, nor who has been more easily successful up to a\r\ncertain point or so singularly unsuccessful beyond it. He has done\r\nvaliant service for his country but he has failed lamentably to\r\nreach the heights from which he could look upon broader horizons.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of his career no one strove more whole heartedly.\r\nDestiny smiled upon him and the White House seemed to beckon. He\r\nwas not unaware of the opportunity nor was there anyone more eager\r\nto grasp it. But he discovered that he could not stir the\r\nenthusiasm that begets political power. The secret, which enabled\r\nmany other men, many of whom he despised, to succeed, was not his.\r\n\r\nA temperamental dislike of the methods of politicians was followed\r\nby a strong animosity towards those who crossed his political path\r\nand some of those who went along beside it. He became hypercritical\r\nof those with whom he associated and allowed a natural germ of\r\ncynicism to develop and flourish within him. Little by little he\r\nhas withdrawn from the active combat, a philosopher in politics\r\nenamored of public life but unwilling to suffer the inconveniences\r\nit involves.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder then that his colleagues in the Senate, especially\r\nthe younger members, are somewhat in fear of the incisive tongue,\r\nfor he wields it frequently and contemptuously. When after his\r\nelection, Mr. Harding went South with Senator Frelinghuysen,\r\nSenator Davis Elkins, and Senator Hale, the older Senators, not,\r\nperhaps, without a tinge of disappointment at having been left out,\r\nmarveled at the entourage the President had selected for himself,\r\nbut Knox was cynically undisturbed.\r\n\r\n\"It is quite simple,\" he said, \"I see nothing mysterious about it\r\nat all. The President wants relaxation--complete mental\r\nrelaxation.\"\r\n\r\nNo less biting was his comment on Robert Lansing when that\r\ngentleman started on the high road of public service as Counselor\r\nof the State Department. The bandy-legged messenger who guards the\r\ndoor of the Secretary of State is the negro, Eddie Savoy. Eddie, in\r\nhis way, is a personage. For forty years he has ushered\r\ndiplomatists in and out of the Secretary's office; his short bent\r\nfigure gives the only air of permanence to an institution which\r\nseems to be in a constant state of flux. When the Lansing\r\nappointment was announced Mr. Knox observed: \"I would as soon ask\r\nEddie Savoy an opinion on foreign affairs as Robert Lansing.\"\r\n\r\nThe roots of Mr. Knox's superciliousness dip down deep into the\r\nrelationships begun a score of years ago. To understand him as he\r\nis it is necessary to understand him as he was when his career was\r\nbefore him. William McKinley asked him to become Attorney General\r\nin his Cabinet. He was then forty-two years old, a political\r\nnobody. What reputation he had was confined to Pittsburg and a\r\nselected few of the steel millionaires in Wall Street, but among\r\nthe selected few were names to be conjured with, such as Andrew\r\nCarnegie and Henry C. Frick. Whether President McKinley's interest\r\nin Knox was spontaneous or prompted by Mr. Frick I do not know. Mr.\r\nKnox likes to believe that Mr. Frick did not enter into the\r\nequation. Mr. Knox declined, saying that he could not sacrifice his\r\nlucrative practice but that in four years he would accept the\r\ninvitation if the President cared to renew it.\r\n\r\nIt was renewed. At the age of forty-six, Mr. Knox quit the bar for\r\npolitics, or, as he would say, statecraft. His appointment evoked a\r\nstorm of protest from such immaculate journals as the New York\r\nWorld. They dubbed him, \"Frick's man,\" and predicted that the\r\nDepartment of Justice would be turned into a Wall Street anteroom\r\nfor the convenience of the capitalistic combinations then flouting\r\nthe Sherman anti-trust law. The charges, of course, were as wide of\r\nthe mark as most of the ebullitions of the yellow journals.\r\n\r\nMr. Knox began his public career by attacking the Northern\r\nSecurities merger, against the judgment of some of the highest-paid\r\nlawyers of the country. The Supreme Court sustained him. It was the\r\ngreatest victory the government ever won under the Sherman law.\r\nThereafter Mr. Knox, who had been labeled a corporation lawyer, was\r\nproclaimed a trust buster. By the time he was fifty he had become\r\nthe greatest Attorney General in a half century. Certainly the mark\r\nhe set has never been reached by any of his successors.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Roosevelt came into the White House Mr. Knox was at the\r\npinnacle of his career and was as much admired by his new chief as\r\nby his martyred predecessor. In ability Mr. Roosevelt considered\r\nhim next to Elihu Root, for which Mr. Root was never quite\r\nforgiven. It is generally known that President Roosevelt believed\r\nthat Mr. Root was the best qualified man in the country to succeed\r\nhim, but at the same time, being an astute politician, he knew that\r\nhe could not be elected. His attitude to his Secretary of State was\r\nthe same as Senator Lodge's toward himself, when he said in 1920:\r\n\"I know that I would make an excellent President, but I realize\r\nthat I would make a poor candidate.\"\r\n\r\nRoot being out of it because of this obvious defect, President\r\nRoosevelt proceeded to groom Mr. Knox for the nomination. Mr. Knox\r\nat the President's suggestion, prepared and delivered several\r\nspeeches in the hope that he would awaken popular enthusiasm. The\r\nattempt failed dismally.\r\n\r\nThere was not a responsive throb, not even a vague echo. Mr. Knox\r\nknew that he possessed not the merest shred of the leadership\r\nnecessary to a presidential candidate.\r\n\r\nHe went back to the Senate, where he had succeeded Matthew Quay\r\nupon his resignation from the Cabinet, sadder if wiser, while\r\nWilliam H. Taft draped upon his broad shoulders the mantle of\r\nRoosevelt.\r\n\r\nMr. Knox has never quite recovered from that disappointment, but he\r\ndid not altogether abandon hope. He accepted a place in the Taft\r\nCabinet as Secretary of State, more for the opportunities it\r\noffered than for the pleasure of the associations, for Mr. Knox's\r\nattitude toward President Taft was never more than passive\r\ntolerance tinged with contempt. This new venture was no more\r\nsuccessful than the old. He made it quite evident that a new regime\r\nwas to be established in the State Department. The policies\r\noriginated by John Hay and developed with singular brilliancy by\r\nMr. Root were shunted into the background and a new era was\r\nproclaimed. It is unnecessary to comment on the dismal essay at\r\n\"dollar diplomacy\" and the Mexican policy of that period. The\r\nsimple fact is that Mr. Knox's name is not associated with a single\r\nsuccessful foreign policy. Some might have succeeded but\r\nunfortunately the energy displayed at the outset of his career in\r\nthis new field was soon dissipated. Mr. Knox disliked the methods\r\nof diplomacy. He lacked both the patience and the finesse. He went\r\nto the Department, over which he was supposed to preside, but\r\nrarely. For weeks at a time Washington saw nothing of him. The\r\nadministration of the Department was left largely to Huntington\r\nWilson, whose ineptitude was colossal.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Mr. Knox the extent of his failure was somewhat\r\nscreened from public view by the dust and clatter of the collapse\r\nof the Taft Administration, but it left its mark on him. He had\r\nfailed dismally to eclipse his predecessor, Elihu Root. He had\r\neliminated himself from all consideration as one of the very great\r\nstatesmen of his period. He was a bitterly disappointed man. Not\r\nonly his associates but the members of the diplomatic corps were\r\nmade to feel the sting of his resentment against overwhelming\r\ncircumstances. Such references as that directed at the French\r\nAmbassador, M. Jules Jusserand, now dean of the diplomatic corps,\r\nwhom he called \"the magpie,\" cost him many friends.\r\n\r\nUpon the inauguration of President Wilson Mr. Knox slipped quietly\r\naway to Valley Forge. Public life, however, still had for him its\r\nattractions, and when Senator Oliver retired, he returned to the\r\nSenate. During the war his great talents were dormant. He merely\r\ncame and went, a curious little detached figure apparently quite\r\nunresponsive to the emotions which swept the country during that\r\neventful period.\r\n\r\nWith the signing of the armistice he aroused himself from his\r\napparent torpor. Although he was quite without feeling during the\r\nstress and storm, the situation created by the presentation of the\r\nTreaty of Versailles with its interwoven League of Nations stirred\r\nhis intellectual interest. He became the leader of the little band\r\nof \"irreconcilables\" who girded their armor to prevent what they\r\nregarded as a catastrophic sacrifice of American interests. At the\r\nsame time Mr. Knox narrowly missed another opportunity to lift\r\nhimself conspicuously above the heads of stump speakers who, for\r\nthe most part, to-day comprise the Senate.\r\n\r\nDuring that memorable fight Senator Lodge incurred the enmity at\r\none time or another of every faction in the Senate. He could not be\r\ntrusted to maintain the same position over night, shifting as\r\nexpediency demanded until most of his colleagues, particularly the\r\nirreconcilables, were exasperated beyond endurance. At one of the\r\nmost critical periods Senator Borah appealed to Senator Knox to\r\nwrest the leadership from the Massachusetts Senator, with\r\nintimations that he would have the support of the \"bitter enders\"\r\nat the forthcoming convention at Chicago. Mr. Knox does not love\r\nMr. Lodge but he refused to consider the proposal. He was\r\nindifferent. His last great political opportunity went glimmering.\r\n\r\nAs I have said Mr. Knox can be very charming but I doubt that he\r\nsincerely admires any of the public men with whom he has been\r\nassociated, or can call any of them, from the purely personal\r\nviewpoint, his friends, with the possible exception of Andrew\r\nMellon, whom he caused to be appointed Secretary of the Treasury.\r\nOf course, he likes many of his colleagues, after a fashion,\r\nespecially those who admire him, but that is another matter. The\r\nintimacy usually implied in the term friendship does not enter into\r\nsuch relations.\r\n\r\nFor some of the more important men he has known, he has shown a\r\nvery distinct dislike. It is said of him that he thought President\r\nHarding overlooked a real opportunity when he failed to invite him\r\nto become Secretary of State, but his disappointment was somewhat\r\nmollified by the fact that Mr. Root was not asked to take the post.\r\n\r\nMr. Knox prefers to look upon Mr. Root as a lucky lawyer who has\r\ntaken to himself much of the credit of John Hay's great work. He\r\nshows an even less regard for Mr. Lodge's talents. And he is\r\ndoubtful of Mr. Hughes.\r\n\r\nHis attitude towards the Secretary of State dates back to the\r\ninsurance scandals. At that time Mr. Frick asked Mr. Knox to make\r\nan investigation and suggest a course of action to avert a national\r\ndisaster. This Mr. Knox did in his thorough and painstaking way. A\r\nlittle later, when Mr. Hughes was appointed to make a public\r\ninquiry, the Knox report was laid before him, and according to the\r\nauthor of it, he followed precisely the lines therein indicated\r\ncreating for himself a national reputation and laying the\r\nfoundation of a public career. Credit was not given Mr. Knox. It\r\nhas been suggested that the incident might have been an\r\nillustration of two great minds seeking the same channel. Mr. Knox\r\ndoes not think so.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his disappointments and failures, the dignified little\r\nSenator from Pennsylvania who has been so many times on the verge\r\nof greatness, seems to think that he could have done just a little\r\nbetter than any of those who have achieved it, had circumstance\r\ngiven him the opportunity. Perhaps he might. It is a compliment\r\nthat few men merit to be called merely indifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT LANSING\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who believes in luck should study the career of Robert Lansing.\r\nMr. Lansing probably thinks that the goddess of chance played him a\r\nscurvy trick, after having admitted him to the Olympian heights, to\r\nbreak him as suddenly as she made him.\r\n\r\nRobert Lansing's real misfortune was not knowing how to play his\r\nluck. It is curious the fear men have of death. The former\r\nSecretary of State's only hope of immortality was to commit\r\npolitical suicide, and he lacked the courage or the vision to fall\r\nupon his sword.\r\n\r\nWhen Woodrow Wilson was elected President for the first time he\r\nappointed Mr. Bryan Secretary of State. The opinion Mr. Wilson\r\nentertained of Mr. Bryan we all know. Mr. Wilson was not given to\r\nletting his thoughts run wild, but on one occasion, with pen in\r\nhand, he permitted himself the luxury of saying what he thought and\r\nexpressed the pious hope that somebody would knock the distinguished\r\nNebraskan into a cocked hat and thus dispose of the perpetual\r\ncandidate who was the Old Man of the Sea to the Democratic Party.\r\n\r\nCircumstances alter cases; Mr. Wilson as a private citizen could\r\nsay and think what he pleased; as President he was compelled to\r\nmake Mr. Bryan Secretary of State. As Mr. Bryan knew nothing of\r\nhistory and less of European politics and had a superb disdain of\r\ndiplomacy--diplomacy according to the tenets of Bryanism being an\r\nunholy and immoral game in which the foreign players were always\r\ntrying to outmaneuver the virtuous and innocent American--he was\r\nprovided with a political nurse, mentor, and guardian in the person\r\nof John Bassett Moore, who had a long and brilliant career as an\r\ninternational lawyer and diplomatist. Mr. Bryan busied himself with\r\nfinding soft jobs for deserving Democrats, preaching and\r\ninculcating the virtues of grape juice to the diplomatic corps, and\r\nconcocting plans whereby the sword was to be beaten into a\r\ntypewriter and war become a lost art. Meanwhile Mr. Moore was doing\r\nthe serious work of the Department.\r\n\r\nNo two men were more unlike than Mr. Bryan and Mr. Moore; Mr. Bryan\r\na bundle of loosely tied emotions to whom a catchy phrase or an\r\nunsound theory is more precious than a natural law or the wisdom of\r\nthe philosopher; Mr. Moore an intellect who has subordinated his\r\nemotions, and to whom facts are as important as mathematics to an\r\nengineer. It was an incompatible union; it could not last. Mr.\r\nMoore became impatient of his chief's vagaries and, about a year\r\nlater, returned to the dignified quiet of Columbia University.\r\n\r\nThis was early in 1914. Now for the random way in which chance\r\nweaves her skein. Mr. Moore went out of the Department and left the\r\noffice of Counselor vacant, an office, up to that time, so little\r\nknown that the public, if it gave the matter any thought, believed\r\nits occupant was the legal adviser of the Department, while, as a\r\nmatter of fact, he is the Under Secretary, which is now the\r\nofficial designation.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of his career Mr. Lansing was connected with the\r\nDepartment as an adviser on international affairs and had\r\nrepresented the United States in many international arbitrations.\r\nHe was known to a small and select circle of lawyers specializing\r\nin international law, but to the public his name meant nothing. He\r\nhad always been a good Democrat, although he was married to the\r\ndaughter of the late John W. Foster, who wound up a long and\r\nbrilliant diplomatic life as Secretary of State in President\r\nHarrison's Cabinet after Mr. Blaine's resignation.\r\n\r\nMr. Lansing had made Washington his home for many years, and when\r\nthe new Democratic Administration came into power he believed his\r\nservices to the party entitled him to recognition, and he sought\r\nthe appointment of Third Assistant Secretary of State. The Third\r\nAssistant Secretary is the official Social Secretary of the\r\nGovernment. When royalty or other distinguished persons come to\r\nthis country as the guests of the nation the Third Assistant\r\nSecretary is the Master of Ceremonies. He has to see that all the\r\nforms are properly complied with and nothing happens to mar the\r\nvisitors' enjoyment; he sends out invitations, in the name of the\r\nState Department, to the funerals of Ambassadors or the\r\ninauguration of the President. But for some reason Mr. Lansing's\r\npraiseworthy ambition was defeated.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore had knowledge, learning, and experience, but he was\r\ndenied the gift of divination. Had he known that a few months later\r\na half crazed youth in an unheard of place was to be the\r\nunconscious agent to set the whole world aflame, undoubtedly he\r\nwould have put up with Mr. Bryan's curious ideas and peculiar\r\nmethods and stuck to his desk at the State Department, and Mr.\r\nLansing would never have been heard of. But at the turning point in\r\nMr. Moore's career his luck deserted him and Mr. Lansing became the\r\nbeneficiary. Mr. Lansing, who would have been satisfied with the\r\nappointment of Third Assistant Secretary of State, a minor place in\r\nthe hierarchy, was appointed by Mr. Wilson Counselor of the\r\nDepartment of State.\r\n\r\nThe appointment created no excitement. In March, 1914, foreign\r\naffairs had little interest for the American people. There was\r\nMexico, of course, and Japan; there were the usual routine\r\nquestions to form the customary work of the department; but the\r\nskies were serene; murder, rape, and sudden death no one thought\r\nof; Lloyd's, which will gamble on anything from the weather to an\r\nocean tragedy, would have written a policy at a ridiculously low\r\npremium on the maintenance of the peace of Europe; any statesman\r\nrash enough to have predicted war for the United States within\r\nthree years would have aroused the concern of his friends and the\r\nprofessional solicitude of his physician. Apparently Mr. Lansing\r\nhad tumbled into an easy and dignified post which would not unduly\r\ntax his physical or mental strength. He could congratulate himself\r\nupon his good fortune.\r\n\r\nA few months later the situation changed. The State Department\r\nbecame not only the center about which the whole machinery of the\r\nGovernment revolved but on it was focused the attention of the\r\ncountry and the thoughts of Europe. The Counselor of the Department\r\nwas lifted out of his obscurity; despatches to the belligerents\r\nsigned \"Lansing\" were published in the newspapers, statements were\r\nissued by him, he was interviewed; he received Ambassadors, and\r\nwhen an Ambassador visited the State Department the nerve centers\r\nof the whole world were affected. Again, a few months later, in\r\nJune, 1915, Mr. Bryan kindly accommodated Mr. Wilson by knocking\r\nhimself into a cocked hat, and Mr. Lansing was appointed Secretary\r\nof State. Few men had risen so rapidly. He had no reason to\r\ncomplain of his luck.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson made some extraordinary appointments--a close observer\r\nhas said he could read motives but not men--and his appointment of\r\nMr. Lansing at a time of crisis would have been inexplicable were\r\nit not logical as Mr. Wilson reasoned. Mr. Wilson did not invite as\r\nhis associates his intellectual equals or those who dared to oppose\r\nhim; it was necessary that the State Department should have a\r\ntitular head, but Mr. Wilson was resolved to be his own Secretary\r\nof State and take into his own hands the control of foreign policy.\r\nNo great man, no man great enough to be Secretary of State when the\r\nworld was in upheaval, would have consented to that indignity; no\r\nman jealous of his own self-respect could have remained Mr.\r\nWilson's Secretary of State for long. A Secretary of State or any\r\nother member of the Cabinet must of course subordinate his judgment\r\nto that of the President, for the President is the final court of\r\nappeal. But Mr. Wilson went further than that; he heaped almost\r\nunparalleled affront upon Mr. Lansing; he made the great office of\r\nSecretary of State ridiculous, and he invested its incumbent with\r\nno greater authority than that of a copyist.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Wilson reads men better than his critics believed;\r\nperhaps Mr. Wilson had fully taken the measure of Mr. Lansing and\r\nknew how far he could go.\r\n\r\nNature never intended Mr. Lansing to be a leader of men, to fight\r\nfor a great cause, or to engage in physical or intellectual combat.\r\nHis life has been too soft for that, and he is naturally indolent.\r\nHe is fond of, and has more than the amateur's appreciation for,\r\nmusic, painting, poetry, and the classics of literature. He has\r\ndabbled in verse, he sketches and he has written, but without\r\nbrilliancy. Accident made him a lawyer, but he was really intended\r\nto be an artist; he would have produced no masterpiece, for genius\r\nis not in him, but he would have been happy in his work and perhaps\r\nhave given inspiration to men of greater talent. Without being a\r\nfanatic or dogmatic, he is strongly religious; religion to him has\r\na meaning and is not merely a convention; he has a code which he\r\nhas always observed and ideals which he has preserved; he is\r\ncharitable in his judgments and has never allowed his prejudices to\r\ninfluence his actions; he is, to use a word so often misapplied, a\r\ngentleman, and his motto is Noblesse oblige. Typical of the\r\nstandard he sets for himself was the admirable restraint he showed\r\nafter his abrupt dismissal from the Cabinet. He neither sought\r\nvindication through the newspapers, nor posed as a victim, nor\r\nsoothed his feelings by denunciations of the President; he did not\r\nmake a nuisance of himself by inflicting the recital of his\r\ngrievances upon his friends or hinting darkly at revelations. He\r\nkept quiet and went about his affairs as a gentleman should.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, should a man with so many fine qualities have\r\ncut such a sorry figure? The answer perhaps is that he suffers from\r\nthe defects of his qualities, fine as we must admit them to be; too\r\nfine, perhaps, for a coarser world.\r\n\r\nWhen a weak and somewhat easy-going man, immensely pleased with his\r\nown exalted position, has to deal with a man of iron will, ruthless\r\nin his methods, he is necessarily at a disadvantage. Considering\r\nMr. Lansing's temperamental defects and the effect of his training,\r\nhis failure is no mystery.\r\n\r\nUntil Mr. Lansing became Secretary of State he had never known\r\nresponsibility. Practically his entire life had been spent as a\r\nsubordinate, carrying out with zeal and intelligence the tasks\r\nassigned to him, but always in obedience to a stronger mind.\r\nNothing more weakens character or intellect than for a man\r\nhabitually to turn to another for direction or inspiration; always\r\nto play the part of an inferior to a mental superior. For years Mr.\r\nLansing had been connected with many international arbitrations\r\nwhich, theoretically, was a magnificent training for a future\r\nSecretary of State, and actually would have destroyed the creative\r\nand administrative usefulness of a much stronger man than Robert\r\nLansing.\r\n\r\nIn the whole mummery of international relations there is nothing\r\nmore farcical than an international arbitration. It is always\r\npreceded by great popular excitement. A ship is seized, a boundary\r\nis run a few degrees north or south of the conventional line,\r\nsomething else equally trivial fires the patriotic heart. The flag\r\nhas been insulted, the offending nation is a land grabber, national\r\nhonor must be vindicated. Secretaries of State write notes,\r\nambassadors are instructed, the press becomes rabid, speeches are\r\nmade; the public is advised to remain calm, but it is also assured\r\nthere will be no surrender. After a few weeks the public forgets\r\nabout the insult or the way in which it has been robbed; but the\r\nresponsible officials who have never allowed themselves to become\r\nexcited, continue the pleasing pastime of writing notes.\r\n\r\nMonths, sometimes years, drag on, then a new Secretary of State or\r\na Foreign Minister, to clean the slate, proposes that the childish\r\nbusiness be ended by an international arbitration. More weeks, more\r\noften months, are spent in agreeing upon the terms of reference,\r\nand finally the dispute goes before an \"impartial arbitral\r\ntribunal.\" Both sides appoint agents and secretaries, an imposing\r\narray of counsel, technical experts; and as the counsel are always\r\nwell paid they have a conscientious obligation to earn their fees.\r\n\r\nMore months are required to prepare the case, which frequently runs\r\ninto many printed volumes; and the more volumes the better pleased\r\neverybody is, as size denotes importance. The arbitrators, although\r\nthey are governed by principles of law, know what is expected of\r\nthem, and they rarely disappoint. Almost invariably their decision\r\nis a compromise, so nicely shaded that while neither side can claim\r\nvictory neither side suffers the humiliation of defeat. As by that\r\ntime both nations have long forgotten the original cause of the\r\nquarrel their people are quite content when they are told the\r\ndecision is in their favor. As junior counsel Mr. Lansing's name\r\nappears in many international arbitrations, and it was precisely\r\nthe work for which he was fitted.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Lansing had been a man of more robust fiber, he would have\r\nreturned his portfolio to Mr. Wilson as early as 1916, for the\r\nPresident was writing notes to the belligerents and did not, even\r\nas a perfunctory courtesy, consult his Secretary of State; he made\r\nit only too patent he did not consider his advice worth asking. Mr.\r\nLansing was too fond of his official prominence to surrender it\r\neasily, and that is another curious thing about the man. Somewhat\r\nvain, holding himself in much higher estimation than the world did,\r\nfew men have so thoroughly enjoyed office as he. But he remained\r\nthe quiet and unassuming gentleman he had always been; and he\r\ncertainly could not have deluded himself into believing that there\r\nwas a still higher office for him to occupy.\r\n\r\nMr. Lansing could not screw up his courage to resign in 1916. The\r\nfollowing year the United States was at war and he naturally could\r\nnot desert his post; but in 1919 Mr. Lansing was given another\r\nopportunity, and still he was obdurate. He has told us in his\r\npublic confession that he tried to persuade the President not to go\r\nto Paris. Mr. Wilson, as usual, remained unpersuaded, and Mr.\r\nLansing humbly followed in his train.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, Mr. Lansing could not resign, but in Paris he was\r\neven more grossly humiliated; he was completely shut out from the\r\nPresident's confidence; he wrote letters to Mr. Wilson which the\r\nPresident did not deign to answer; so little did Mr. Lansing know\r\nwhat was being done that he sought information from the Chinese\r\nDelegates! It sounds incredible, it seems even more incredible that\r\na Secretary of State should put himself in such an undignified\r\nposition, and having done so should invite the world to share his\r\nignominy. But he has set it down in his book as if he believed it\r\nwas ample defense, instead of realizing that it is condemnation.\r\n\r\nCurious contradictions! One might expect a sensitive man, a man who\r\nhas never courted publicity, who has none of the genius of the\r\nself-advertiser, to crave forgetfulness for the Paris episode, to\r\nshrink from publicly exposing himself and his humiliations, but Mr.\r\nLansing seemingly revels in his self-dissection. The President\r\nslaps his face; in his pride he summons all the world to look upon\r\nthe marks left by the Executive palm. He feels the sting, and he\r\nenters upon an elaborate defense to show it is the stigmata of\r\nmartyrdom. A treaty was framed of which he disapproved, yet he\r\ncould sign it without wrench of conscience. Unreconciled to\r\nresignation in Paris, he returned to Washington as if nothing had\r\nhappened, again to resume his subservient relations to the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nOpportunity, we are told, knocks only once at a man's door, but\r\nwhile opportunity thundered at Mr. Lansing's portal \"his ear was\r\nclosed with the cotton of negligence.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in 1920 Mr. Wilson dismissed him, brutally, abruptly, with\r\nthe petulance of an invalid too tired to be fair; for a reason so\r\nobviously disingenuous that Mr. Lansing had the sympathy of the\r\ncountry. He should either have told the truth then and there or\r\nforever have held his peace; and had he remained mute out of the\r\nmystery would have grown a myth. The fictitious Lansing would have\r\nbecome an historical character. But he must needs write a book. It\r\ndoes not make pleasant reading. It does not make its author a hero.\r\n\r\nIt does, however, answer the question the curious asked at the time\r\nof his appointment: \"Why did the President make Mr. Lansing\r\nSecretary of State?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOIES PENROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most striking victim of the American propensity for\r\nexaggeration is the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Boies\r\nPenrose. He has a personality and contour that lend themselves to\r\ncaricature. Only a few deft strokes are needed to make his\r\nponderous figure and heavy jowl the counterpart of a typical boss,\r\nan institution for which the American people have a pardonable\r\naffection in these days of political quackery. For, when the worst\r\nis said of the imposing array of bosses from Tweed down to the\r\npresent time, they could be forgiven much because they were what\r\nthey were. That is why, perhaps, the altogether fanciful picture of\r\nPenrose, propped on his pillows with his telephone at his bedside\r\ndirecting the embattled delegates at Chicago, who in sheer\r\ndesperation turned to Warren G. Harding, is dwelt upon fondly by a\r\ndeluded public.\r\n\r\nPenrose does not despise the appurtenances of bossism. If the truth\r\nwere told he probably likes the idea of being represented as the\r\nhard-fisted master of party destinies. He knows that such a\r\nreputation inspires awe if not respect, on the part of the rank and\r\nfile, from the humble precinct worker to the gentleman of large\r\naffairs who provides the necessary campaign funds. It has its\r\nvalue, sentimental as well as practical, for the American people\r\nlikes to set up its own political idols. The politicians who for\r\nthe moment guide the destinies of the nation are so misdrawn, so\r\nilluminated with virtues and endowed with vices quite foreign to\r\nthem, that they frequently achieve a personality quite fictitious,\r\nbut which, none the less, passes current in the popular mind as\r\ngenuine.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more grotesque, for example, than the picture of\r\nSenator Smoot, who is merely a sublimated messenger boy, as one of\r\nthe arbiters of the Republican policies; or of Senator Lodge, by\r\nsheer strength of leadership, restraining the discordant Republican\r\nelements in the Senate from kicking over the traces. This is\r\njournalist \"copy\" written for a popular imagination which finds the\r\ntruth too tepid.\r\n\r\nBoies Penrose serves the purpose of appeasing national appetite for\r\nwhat the magazine editors call \"dynamic stuff.\"\r\n\r\nBut the real Boies Penrose is not all as he is pictured. At a\r\ncursory glance he might appear to be a physiological, psychological,\r\nand political anachronism. At least he is sufficiently different\r\nfrom his colleagues to be, if not actually mysterious, not easily\r\nunderstandable. There is something fundamental about him. He\r\ninspires a certain awe which may not be magnetic but has the same\r\neffect upon those who surround him; where he sits is the head of\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nI doubt if Lodge or Knox or Hughes could ever fathom the secret of\r\nhis power; they are not cast in the same mould. His colleagues\r\nsmile at his idiosyncracies--behind his back--but they approach him\r\nwith the respect due to a master. Many of them admire him, not a\r\nfew hate him, but all of them fear him. It is rather a singular\r\nthing that Senator La Follette, himself at the pinnacle of his\r\nchampionship of the Wisconsin progressive idea, was probably on\r\nfriendlier terms with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania than any\r\nof the other leaders of those reactionary forces with whom he was\r\ntilting. He knew where Penrose stood and it is not at all\r\nimprobable that behind the Penrose reticence there was a modicum of\r\nadmiration for the methods of the redoubtable little colleague, who\r\nin his way, was a more inexorable boss than Penrose himself ever\r\ndreamed of being. The mutual understanding was there, even if it\r\nnever became articulate.\r\n\r\nPenrose has peculiarities which put him in a niche quite his own.\r\nHe eschews conversation as an idle affectation. He dislikes to\r\nshake hands, preferring the Chinese fashion of holding his on his\r\nown expansive paunch. When he finds it necessary to talk at all he\r\nspeaks the precise truth as he sees it without consideration for\r\nthe feelings of those he happens to be addressing. The results are\r\nfrequently so ludicrous, particularly when he enters a colloquy on\r\nthe Senate floor, that he is given credit for a much more\r\npronounced sense of humor than he actually possesses. I doubt that\r\nhe is always conscious of the element of humor and I suspect that\r\nif he realized that his observations were to evoke laughter he\r\nwould deliberately choose a less satirical or flippant method of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThis temperamental characteristic was illustrated by an episode in\r\nthe Senate chamber not long ago. Penrose, entering, found his chair\r\noccupied by a Democratic colleague who had overestimated his\r\ncapacity for the doubtful stuff that is purveyed in these days of\r\nVolsteadism and whose condition was apparent to everyone on the\r\nfloor and in the galleries. Penrose is, perhaps, the most widely\r\nknown personage in the Senate. His towering figure makes him\r\nconspicuous. But the most of the myriads of trippers who visit the\r\nCapitol do not know one senator from another. They rely for\r\nidentification upon little charts showing the arrangements of the\r\nseats on the floor each one of which is labeled with a senator's\r\nname.\r\n\r\nNow Penrose, might or might not have suspected that these trippers\r\nfollowing their charts, would pick out the snoring recumbent figure\r\nas his own. He decided to remove all possibility of error and\r\naddressing the chair with usual solemnity said, \"Mr. President, I\r\ndesire the chair to record the fact that the seat of the senior\r\nSenator from Pennsylvania has not been occupied by himself at the\r\npresent session. It is occupied by another.\" The galleries roared;\r\nthe somnolent Senator shambled over to his own side of the aisle\r\nand Senator Penrose was given credit, by the unwise, for humor\r\nquite unintended.\r\n\r\nLife with Mr. Penrose is a much more serious business than most\r\npeople imagine. And it became even more serious a little while ago\r\nwhen illness laid hold of him and his brother, a physician,\r\nprescribed dietary rules restricting the freedom that he had once\r\nexercised without restraint. There was something lion-like in the\r\ngaunt figure in the rolling chair which he occupied when he\r\nreturned to the Senate from his sick bed. It was amazing that he\r\nrecovered; it was even more amazing that he should have submitted\r\nto the rigorous rules laid down by his doctor, even if that doctor\r\nwas his own brother. The bated breath with which Pennsylvania\r\npoliticians awaited bulletins from his bedside was a striking\r\nacknowledgment of the power he wields.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of Boies Penrose is an amusing commentary upon\r\nAmerican politics in more ways than one. Three years after he was\r\ngraduated from Harvard College he was elected to the Pennsylvania\r\nState Legislature on a reform ticket. His election was made the\r\noccasion for great rejoicing on the part of the good people of\r\nPhiladelphia. And well might they rejoice. They had at last driven\r\na wedge into the sinister political machine that had brought the\r\ncity of brotherly love into disrepute as a boss-ridden municipality.\r\n\r\nTheir young leader had wealth, which has its advantages, and social\r\nposition, which to a Philadelphian is as dear as life itself.\r\nMoreover he had ability and all that makes for success. His fame as\r\na reform leader spread throughout the land and across the seas.\r\nJames Bryce, in his first edition of his American Commonwealth\r\ncited him as an example of the sterling type of young Americans who\r\nwere arousing themselves at that time to rescue the municipal and\r\nstate governments from the grip of the vicious boss system.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent editions of the American Commonwealth you will\r\nfind no reference to Mr. Penrose. Something had happened to him and\r\nto the reform movement. Whether he was struck by a bolt from the\r\nheavens or a bolt from Matthew Stanley Quay is immaterial. The fact\r\nis that after a few years' residence in Harrisburg, the seat of the\r\ngovernment of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, he counseled with\r\nhimself and solemnly decided that Providence had never selected him\r\nto be the apostle of the political millenium.\r\n\r\nMost men are born radicals and die conservatives. The development\r\nis gradual and represents the result of years of experience. But\r\nPenrose repented while there was time to make amends for his error.\r\nHe sought a very short cut. He went directly from the legislature\r\nto the Republican organization of Philadelphia and stood as its\r\ncandidate for mayor. But his late friends, the reformers, happened\r\nto be in the ascendency that year and he was defeated.\r\n\r\nThe story told of him at that time, whether true or not, that he\r\nannounced his willingness to take as his bride any estimable young\r\nlady the organization might select, since the fact that he was a\r\nbachelor was given by his henchmen as the reason of his defeat, is\r\ntypical of him. The \"organization,\" the Republican Party,\r\nconstitutes his political creed and philosophy. He has devoted his\r\nlife to it. The \"party\" is his life, his religion, his family, his\r\nhobby. Down in his soul he believes that the destiny of the\r\nAmerican people is so inextricably interwoven with its fortunes\r\nthat its destruction would be nothing less than national hari kari.\r\n\r\nHe does not believe that the Republican Party is perfect, but he\r\nbelieves that it is as perfect as any political organization is\r\never likely to be. He has no illusions concerning the men it\r\nchooses for high places. He is never disturbed by stories of\r\npolitical corruption or graft unless they are serious enough to\r\njeopardize forthcoming elections. Otherwise they are merely\r\nunpleasant incidents that arise in the life of every business\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIf he were supreme he would not tolerate political corruption, any\r\nmore than he would tolerate murder; but since he is not supreme and\r\ncannot dictate to all men, he accepts their efforts in the interest\r\nof the organization even though their hands may be slightly soiled.\r\nLike the wise general who raises a volunteer army he is not\r\nmeticulous in the choice of his privates, providing they are\r\ncapable of performing the tasks assigned to them. No seeker after\r\nsouls ever believed the end justifies the means more sincerely than\r\nBoies Penrose believes his vote-seekers are justified in stretching\r\nthe code a bit for the benefit of the organization--particularly if\r\nit is actually endangered.\r\n\r\nJust as he believes in the Republican Party he believes in a high\r\ntariff--the higher the better. Prosperity without protection is\r\ninconceivable. During a Washington career of more than twenty years\r\nhe has been constantly caricatured as the tool of the interests--the\r\nman upon whom they could rely to raise the tariff wall an inch\r\nor two for their personal benefit.\r\n\r\nHe has raised it whenever he has had the opportunity to do so, but\r\nnot for the reason assigned. He is no man's tool. The suggestion\r\nthat Boies Penrose personally has ever profited financially through\r\npolitics is too absurd to be entertained for a moment. Of course,\r\nhe expects the interests, whom the party serves with tariff\r\nprotection, to save the party at the polls and they usually do so.\r\nBut that in the opinion of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania is\r\nthe essence of sound politics.\r\n\r\nUnbelievable as it may sound in these days, Senator Penrose\r\nactually thinks that most men are dependent for their daily bread\r\nupon the success of a very small group of financiers, magnates, or\r\nwhatever you care to call the great leaders of the world of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nYears of experience has convinced him that the human race is\r\ncomposed, for the most part, of hopelessly improvident people and\r\nthat a great part of the globe would be depopulated through\r\nstarvation and disease if it were not for the foresight, ability,\r\nand thrift of the handful of leaders whom Divine Providence has\r\nprovided. He looks upon himself as one of the instruments of\r\nProvidence and he sincerely believes that the policies which he has\r\nsupported since his early experience with the reformers are\r\nresponsible for the happiness and prosperity of many a family. He\r\nwould consider it the height of absurdity for any of these poor,\r\nworthy, but ignorant people to expect the comforts which they have\r\nenjoyed without the protection afforded their employers by the\r\nRepublican Party.\r\n\r\nBy this somewhat unpopular method of reasoning, he believes that he\r\nof all the men in public life has made the most persistent and\r\nconsistent fight for the masses. It is undoubtedly this calm faith\r\nand sincere belief in his own rectitude which has enabled him to\r\nhold the tremendous power he has exerted since Nelson Aldrich\r\nretired from the Senate.\r\n\r\nI have presented his political philosophy in some detail because he\r\nis probably the most misjudged man in Washington. People are\r\ninclined to look upon him as a glorified boss who deals in politics\r\nas other men deal in commodities;--it is hardly a fair estimate of\r\nthe man. He considers himself the chosen leader of the most\r\nintelligent people of a great commonwealth who is rendering\r\ntremendous service to the country. I do not agree with that\r\nestimate either. But taken all and all it seems to me that the\r\ncountry owes him a debt of gratitude for having been sincere when\r\nanother course would have been more profitable. It is a relief to\r\nfind one at least who has never been called a hypocrite.\r\n\r\nSenator Penrose does not hate Democrats; he does not consider them\r\nimportant enough for that; he merely despises them. They are to his\r\nmind an inferior class of human beings who should not be intrusted\r\nwith the affairs of the nation. Reformers irritate him. They are\r\neither self-seeking hypocrites or deluded. In neither case has he\r\nthe time nor inclination to listen to their suggestions or heed\r\ntheir maledictions.\r\n\r\nHe had an abiding hatred for Theodore Roosevelt when he was in the\r\nWhite House, but he supported him loyally so long as he was the\r\nleader of the Party. When Colonel Roosevelt bolted the hatred ran\r\nthe last gamut. He was classed as an arch criminal for having\r\nsmashed the organization.\r\n\r\nPenrose is an enigma to those who know him only casually,\r\nespecially those who view life through the rose glasses of culture.\r\nThey marvel at the extent to which he has been able to dictate to\r\nmen who appear to be his superiors. I have heard him called a cave\r\nman by some, by others a boor; but he is neither. He observes the\r\namenities of life so far as they are necessary, but only so far. He\r\nis impatient of mediocrity; he will not tolerate stupidity and he\r\nloathes hypocrisy. I would not say that he has bad manners; he has\r\nnone at all.\r\n\r\nThroughout the recent eclipse of the Republican Party, which began\r\nwith the Roosevelt default, no member remained more steadfast than\r\nthe Pennsylvania leader. He accepted the inevitable and bided his\r\ntime like the politicians of the old school of which he is one of\r\nthe few conspicuous surviving examples. Expediency does not enter\r\ninto his make-up; he made no effort to keep himself in the\r\nlimelight, for he is by the Party, of the Party, and for the Party.\r\n\r\nNow that the Party is back again, in power, more than one of his\r\ncolleagues suspect that Penrose, if his health permits, will emerge\r\nfrom the background as the real leader of the Senate majority. His\r\npolitical past is against him. But he knows men and his tutelage\r\nunder Aldrich has not been forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM E. BORAH\r\n\r\n\r\nTaken at its best, life, to William E. Borah, is little more than a\r\ntroublesome pilgrimage to the grave.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that he is a misanthrope or a seer of distorted\r\nvision. On the contrary his sympathies are broad and he has an\r\nelusive charm, more apparent in the early years of his political\r\ncareer than now. But, for some reason, probably temperamental, he\r\nis in the habit of dwelling upon the dangers that beset the\r\nrepublic--dangers which are sometimes very real. Nevertheless an\r\nhour in his presence is more often than not depressing; it leaves\r\none with a sense of impending calamity. There are few bright spots\r\non his horizon.\r\n\r\nIt is not altogether to his discredit that his more venerable\r\ncolleagues look upon him as a young man--he is fifty-six; nor does\r\nit imply merely arrested political development. For all of his\r\npessimism he maintains a certain freshness, if belligerency, of\r\nspirit which is puzzling not only to those who have long since\r\naccustomed themselves to the party yoke but to those whom\r\nexperience has taught the art of compromise. For Borah hates the\r\ndiscipline that organization entails, in spite of his respect for\r\norganization, and he dislikes compromise however often he is driven\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThis may be accounted for by the fact that he was not obliged to\r\nfight his way laboriously upward on the lower rungs of politics--he\r\nlanded in the Senate from an Idaho law office in one pyrotechnical\r\nleap when he was only forty two--and by the fact that in his make-up\r\nhe is singularly unpolitical. Disassociating him from his\r\nsenatorial environment it is much easier to imagine him as a\r\ndevotee of academic culture, a university professor, a moral\r\ncrusader, even a poet, than as a politician.\r\n\r\nThere is in his make-up an underlying Celtic strain which may\r\naccount for his moodiness, his emotionalism, and his impulsiveness.\r\nThese characteristics are constantly cropping up. For many years he\r\nhas buried himself in a somber suite of rooms in the Senate office\r\nbuilding as far away from his colleagues as he could get. There he\r\nlives in an atmosphere of academic quiet. There he reads and\r\nstudies incessantly, far from the maddening crowd of politics. This\r\ndetachment has probably bred a suspicion that marks his actions. He\r\nhas no intimates, no associates who call him \"Bill.\" He is not a\r\nsocial being. He is rarely seen where men and women congregate. He\r\nis virtually unknown in that strange bedlam composed largely of\r\nsocial climbers and official poseurs called Washington society. He\r\nneither smokes, drinks, nor plays. What relaxation he gets is on\r\nthe back of a western nag in Rock Creek Park where he may be seen\r\nany morning cantering along--alone. He does not ride for pleasure;\r\nhis physician ordered it and it is a very businesslike matter. If\r\nhe experiences any of the exhilaration that comes to men in the\r\nsaddle he contrives to conceal it.\r\n\r\nOn the floor of the Senate he is quite a different person. There\r\nhis unmistakable genius for oratory is given full sweep and when he\r\nspeaks his colleagues usually listen, not because they agree with\r\nwhat he says but because they are charmed by the easy and melodious\r\nflow of his words. There is a hint of Ingersoll in his speeches\r\nwhich are full of alliteration and rhythmic phrases. He has a sense\r\nof form sadly lacking in his stammering and inarticulate\r\ncolleagues, for oratory in the Senate is probably at its lowest\r\nebb. But, strangely enough, it is only occasionally that he makes a\r\nlasting impression. His eloquence ripples like water and leaves\r\nscarcely more trace.\r\n\r\nMr. Borah's entire political career has been characterized by an\r\nimpulsiveness which has given him a halo of popularity but has\r\nnever enabled him to garner the fruits of plodding labor. At one\r\ntime or another this has led him to break with nearly every faction\r\nwith which he has been identified. The \"regular\" Republicans have\r\nfelt that they never could rely upon him; the \"progressive\" element\r\nhas found him inconstant and at intervals he has threatened to pull\r\ndown the party house of the Republicans and to bring destruction to\r\none or other of the leaders whom he dislikes.\r\n\r\nThis was illustrated by an observation he made to me one spring\r\nmorning in 1919 when the Republican attitude toward the League of\r\nNations was still in the formative process. Borah was \"convinced\"\r\nthat Elihu Root and Will H. Hays were conspiring to induce the\r\nRepublicans to accept the League and he said, quite seriously, that\r\nhe had about come to the conclusion that it would be necessary to\r\nwreck the Republican Party to save the country. Root, he told me,\r\nwas pro-British to the last degree and Hays, he said, was cajoled\r\nby the great international bankers who trembled at the delay of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"If such men are to lead the Republican Party,\" he declared, \"the\r\nsooner it is destroyed the better.\" Of course, he did not take the\r\nstump. He has failed so often to carry out his threats of rebellion\r\nthat they no longer inspire the fear they once did. Although he has\r\nrepeatedly turned against the organization he has managed to escape\r\nbeing an outlaw. This singular trait of political conservatism came\r\nconspicuously into play in 1912 when Roosevelt turned upon the\r\nmachine. All through the stormy days of that stormy Chicago\r\nconvention Senator Borah could be found at the side of that one\r\nleader for whom he had a consistent regard. He was with him up to\r\nthe very last moment before the die was cast. He was almost\r\nsuccessful at the eleventh hour in inducing Mr. Roosevelt to\r\nabandon his mad project. They were closeted together on the evening\r\nof the clamorous meeting of the progressives in a hotel across the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\"We have come to the parting of the ways, Colonel,\" Borah said to\r\nhis chief. \"This far I have gone with you. I can go no further.\" He\r\nurged Roosevelt not to take the step which would mean the\r\ndisruption of the party and defeat. Roosevelt wavered. But before\r\nhe could reach the decision Borah sought a committee from the\r\noutlaw meeting, burst into the room, and enthusiastically announced\r\nthat the stage was set for the demonstration that was to mark a new\r\npolitical era.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt, hat in hand, turned to Borah and said, \"You see, I can't\r\ndesert my friends now.\" The ex-President went his way and Borah\r\ncame back to the old Republican fold.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to this he has followed his own way which,\r\nfortunately for the Republican Party, has been within organization\r\nlimits, but his relations with his fellows are neither intimate nor\r\nserene. Some of the Republicans, who can be forgiven for not\r\nunderstanding a man who respects neither party decrees nor\r\ntraditions, feel that Borah is so American that he possesses one of\r\nthe characteristics of the aboriginal Indian--in other words, that\r\nhe is cunning, that he will not play the game according to\r\norganization rules. He has a habit of making too many mental\r\nreservations. I am not quite sure that these allegations could be\r\nsupported before an impartial tribunal. I am rather inclined to the\r\nbelief that to maintain his position in the Senate Borah has had to\r\nbecome a shrewd trader.\r\n\r\nFortunately for himself he is too much of a personage to be ignored\r\nor suppressed, and manages to be a power in a party which has no\r\nlove for him.\r\n\r\nHe is virtually a party to himself. He cannot be controlled by the\r\nordinary political methods. His constituency is small and evidently\r\ndevoted to him and his state is remote; he is not compelled to do\r\nthe irksome political chores that cost Senators their political\r\nindependence. However doubtful he might be as a positive asset his\r\ndexterity and power of expression are such that he would be very\r\ndangerous as a liability. A report that Borah is on the rampage\r\naffects Republican leaders very much as a run on a bank affects\r\nfinancial leaders. They are not quite sure when either is going to\r\nstop. Borah knows that most of the men with whom he is dealing are\r\nclay and estimates with uncanny accuracy the degree to which he can\r\ncompel them to meet his demands.\r\n\r\nThis method has not always been successful. It was singularly\r\nunsuccessful in the case of Senator Penrose. Borah is the\r\nantithesis of Penrose, whom he dislikes intensely. Several years\r\nago he interpreted a remark made by the Senator from Pennsylvania\r\nto another Senator as a thrust at his own political ethics, or lack\r\nof them. It was a petty affair at most and Penrose never admitted\r\nthe accuracy of Borah's construction, but Borah has had nothing to\r\ndo with him since. When the present Congress was in process of\r\norganization Borah announced that he would bolt the party caucus if\r\nPenrose were slated for the chairmanship of the Finance Committee\r\nto which he was entitled according to the rule of seniority. It was\r\na ticklish situation. The Republicans had a bare majority in the\r\nSenate and if any of them deserted the organization it might mean\r\nDemocratic control. The leaders were disturbed and tried to mollify\r\nthe defiant Senator from Idaho with every means at hand even giving\r\nassurance that the Senator from Pennsylvania would vote against the\r\nPeace Treaty and the League of Nations which was supposed to\r\nrepresent his vital interest at that time. He refused to compromise\r\nand announced that Penrose must go. He was offered every committee\r\nassignment that he or his friends wanted, and accepted them, but as\r\na matter of right.\r\n\r\nPenrose was determined not to be displaced to satisfy what he\r\nregarded as a colleague's whim. He sat silent in his office\r\nreceiving reports from hour to hour on Borah's state of mind. On\r\nthe day before the caucus Borah whispered that he intended to make\r\ncharges against the Pennsylvania leader that would provide a\r\nsensation regardless of any effect they might have upon the party\r\nor the country. The report was brought to Penrose. Instead of\r\ntrembling he sent word to Borah that he might say what he pleased\r\nconcerning his political career but that if he made any personal\r\ncharges he would regret them to his dying day. Borah appeared to\r\nunderstand. He did not even attend the caucus and Penrose was duly\r\nelected. Whether he was trading for committee assignments or\r\ninitiated the fight on political grounds is a question he alone can\r\nanswer, if anyone should have the temerity to ask it.\r\n\r\nThe same violence of his likes and dislikes is shown in his\r\nattitude toward the British and his espousal of the Irish cause. At\r\nthe time of the visit of the British mission to Washington,\r\nVice-President Marshall designated Senator Borah a member of the\r\ncommittee appointed to escort the British visitors into the\r\nchamber. This Borah resented as a personal affront.\r\n\r\n\"Marshall has a distorted sense of humor,\" he said. \"He knows I\r\ndislike the British and that I despise the hypocrite Balfour.\" This\r\nfeeling was probably due in large measure to the Irish lineage\r\nwhich Borah can trace in his ancestry as well as a temperamental\r\ndislike of the British methods of maintaining control over subject\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to label Senator Borah from a political standpoint.\r\nHis most striking characteristic is his inconsistency. For a long\r\ntime in the early days of the progressive movement he displayed a\r\nmarked inclination to be \"irregular\" and he is to be found voting\r\nfor most measures for which the \"progressives\" claimed sponsorship,\r\nbut when the more radical leaders began to advocate the recall of\r\nthe judiciary, Borah rose up and delivered an invective the memory\r\nof which lingers in the Capitol. It was one of the few speeches he\r\nhas made that had a permanent effect and, strangely enough, it was\r\nthe kind of speech that might have well been delivered by Root or\r\nKnox.\r\n\r\nThere has always been reason to believe that Borah was never more\r\nenamored of La Follette in his prime, or of Hiram Johnson, than he\r\nhas been of the \"reactionary\" leaders with whom he has been\r\noftentimes in open conflict. When the latter deluded himself with\r\nthe hope of securing the Republican nomination, Borah was supposed\r\nto be his chief supporter. When Johnson had eliminated Lowden and\r\nWood, and seemed to have eliminated Harding, Borah showed more\r\ninterest in the Knox candidacy. He wanted Knox at the head of the\r\nticket mainly because he knew that Knox was an implacable foe of\r\nthe League of Nations. On that fateful Friday night in Chicago when\r\nthe signs of the trend toward Harding had begun to appear, the\r\nSenator from Idaho was anxious and prepared to place Knox's name in\r\nnomination and begged Johnson to swing his delegates in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBorah has succeeded very well in concealing his own ambitions,\r\npossibly because he is more cautious than some of his impetuous\r\ncolleagues, or because the opportunity has never come for an\r\navowal. But among those who have followed his career there is a\r\nvery strong suspicion that his one great desire was to be the\r\nsuccessor of Roosevelt. This might be one reason for his antagonism\r\ntoward the politicians of the old regime, such as Penrose, who have\r\nbarred his way in that direction, and his fitful devotion to\r\nprogressivism championed by others. The failure to realize this\r\nambition might account in some measure for his later reticence and\r\nhis suspicion of politicians in general. He has shown a pronounced\r\ndistrust of them. The only exception has been the audacious\r\nAmbassador to the Court of Saint James who in his REVIEW and in his\r\nWEEKLY flattered the Senator from Idaho with an absence of\r\nrestraint that might have made a more trusting person skeptical.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Idaho has too many years before him to justify\r\npredictions concerning his career. Whatever faults he might have\r\nthey do not entirely obscure his virtues. It is possible that the\r\noccasion might arise for him to serve as the spokesman of a popular\r\ncause, which he would do with undoubted earnestness and eloquence,\r\nin which event he might still become a dominating figure in\r\nAmerican politics.",
