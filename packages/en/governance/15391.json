In consideration of the favor\r\nwith which the compilation of Professor Johnston had been received, and\r\nof its value to all who are interested in the study of American history,\r\nthe present editor has deemed it wise to make as few omissions as\r\npossible from the former volumes. The changes have been chiefly in the\r\nway of additions. The omission, from the first volume, of Washington's\r\nInaugural and President Nott's oration on the death of Hamilton is the\r\nresult, not of a depreciation of the value of these, but of a desire to\r\nutilize the space with selections and subjects which are deemed more\r\ndirectly valuable as studies in American political history. Madison's\r\nspeech on the adoption of the Constitution, made before the Virginia\r\nConvention, is substituted for one of Patrick Henry's on the same\r\noccasion. Madison's is a much more valuable discussion of the issues and\r\nprinciples involved, and, besides, the volume has the advantage of\r\nHenry's eloquence when he was at his best, at the opening of the\r\nAmerican Revolution. In compensation for the omissions there are added\r\nselections, one each from Otis, Samuel Adams, Gallatin, and Benton. The\r\ncompleted first volume, therefore, offers to the student of American\r\npolitical history chapters from the life and work of sixteen\r\nrepresentative orators and statesmen of America.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the changes made in the selections, the editor has added\r\nbrief biographical sketches, references, and textual and historical\r\nnotes which, it is hoped, will add to the educational value of the\r\nvolumes, as well as to the interest and intelligence with which the\r\ncasual reader may peruse the speeches.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher of American history, I have found no more luminous texts on\r\nour political history than the speeches of the great men who have been\r\nable, in their discussions of public questions, to place before us a\r\ncontemporary record of the history which they themselves were helping to\r\nmake. To the careful student the secondary authorities can never supply\r\nthe place of the great productions, the messages and speeches, which\r\nhistoric occasions have called forth. The earnest historical reader will\r\napproach these orations, not with the design of regarding then merely as\r\nspecimens of eloquence or as studies in language, but as indicating the\r\ngreat subjects and occasions of our political history and the spirit and\r\nmotives of the great leaders of that history. The orations lead the\r\nstudent to a review of the great struggles in which the authors were\r\nengaged, and to new interest in the science of government from the\r\nutterances and permanent productions of master participants in great\r\npolitical controversies. Certainly, there is no text-book in political\r\nscience more valuable than the best productions of great statesmen, as\r\nreflecting the ideas of those who have done most to make political\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWith these ideas in mind, the editor has added rather extensive\r\nhistorical notes, with the purpose of suggesting the use of the speeches\r\nas the basis of historical study, and of indicating other similar\r\nsources for investigation. These notes, together with explanations of\r\nany obscurities in the text, and other suggestions for study, will serve\r\nto indicate the educational value of the volumes; and it is hoped that\r\nthey may lead many teachers and students to see in these orations a text\r\nsuitable as a guide to valuable studies in American political history.\r\n\r\nThe omissions of parts of the speeches, made necessary by the exigencies\r\nof space, consist chiefly of those portions which were but of temporary\r\ninterest and importance, and which would not be found essential to an\r\nunderstanding of the subject in hand. The omissions, however, have\r\nalways been indicated so as not to mislead the reader, and in most\r\ninstances the substance of the omissions has been indicated in the\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThe general division of the work has been retained: 1. Colonialism, to\r\n1789. Constitutional Government, to 1801. 3. The Rise of Democracy, to\r\n1815. 4. The Rise of Nationality, to 1840. 5. The Slavery Struggle, to\r\n1860. 6. Secession and Civil War, to 1865. The extension of the studies\r\ncovering these periods, by the addition of much new material has made\r\nnecessary the addition of a fourth volume, which embraces the general\r\nsubjects, (1) Reconstruction; (2) Free Trade and Protection; (3)\r\nFinance; (4) Civil-Service Reform. Professor Johnston's valuable\r\nintroductions to the several sections have been substantially retained.\r\n\r\nBy the revision, the volumes will be confined entirely to political\r\noratory. Literature and religion have, each in its place, called forth\r\nworthy utterances in American oratory. These, certainly, have an\r\nimportant place in the study of our national life. But it has been\r\ndeemed advisable to limit the scope of these volumes to that field of\r\nhistory which Mr. Freeman has called \"past politics,\"--to the process by\r\nwhich Americans, past and present, have built and conducted their state.\r\nThe study of the state, its rise, its organization, and its development,\r\nis, after all, the richest field for the student and reader of history.\r\n\"History.\" says Professor Seeley, \"may be defined as the biography of\r\nstates. To study history thus is to study politics at the same time. If\r\nhistory is not merely eloquent writing, but a serious scientific\r\ninvestigation, and if we are to consider that it is not mere\r\nanthropology or sociology, but a science of states, then the study of\r\nhistory is absolutely the study of politics.\" It is into this great\r\nfield of history that these volumes would direct the reader.\r\n\r\nNo American scholar had done more, before his untimely death, than the\r\noriginal editor of these orations, to cultivate among Americans an\r\nintelligent study of our politics and political history. These volumes,\r\nwhich he designed, are a worthy memorial of his appreciation of the\r\nvalue to American students of the best specimens of our political\r\noratory.\r\n\r\nJ. A. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nAll authorities are agreed that the political history of the United\r\nStates, beyond much that is feeble or poor in quality, has given to the\r\nEnglish language very many of its most finished and most persuasive\r\nspecimens of oratory. It is natural that oratory should be a power in a\r\nrepublic; but, in the American republic, the force of institutions has\r\nbeen reinforced by that of a language which is peculiarly adapted to the\r\ndisplay of eloquence. Collections of American orations have been\r\nnumerous and useful, but the copiousness of the material has always\r\nproved a source of embarrassment. Where the supply is so abundant, it is\r\nexceedingly difficult to make selections on any exact system, and yet\r\nimpossible to include all that has a fair claim to the distinctive stamp\r\nof oratory. The results have been that our collections of public\r\nspeeches have proved either unsatisfactory or unreasonably voluminous.\r\n\r\nThe design which has controlled the present collection has been to make\r\nsuch selections from the great orations of American history as shall\r\nshow most clearly the spirit and motives which have actuated its\r\nleaders, and to connect them by a thread of commentary which shall\r\nconvey the practical results of the conflicts of opinion revealed in the\r\nselections. In the execution of such a work much must be allowed for\r\npersonal limitations; that which would seem representative to one would\r\nnot seem at all representative to others. It will not be difficult to\r\nmark omissions, some of which may seem to mar the completeness of the\r\nwork very materially; the only claim advanced is that the work has been\r\ndone with a consistent desire to show the best side of all lines of\r\nthought which have seriously modified the course of American history.\r\nSome great names will be missed from the list of orators, and some great\r\naddresses from the list of orations; the apology for their omission is\r\nthat they have not seemed to be so closely related to the current of\r\nAmerican history or so operative upon its course as to demand their\r\ninsertion. Any errors under this head have occurred in spite of careful\r\nconsideration and anxious desire to be scrupulously impartial.\r\n\r\nVery many of the orations selected have been condensed by the omission\r\nof portions which had no relevancy to the purpose in hand, or were of\r\nonly a temporary interest and importance. Such omissions have been\r\nindicated, so that the reader need not be misled, while the effort has\r\nbeen made to so manage the omissions as to maintain a complete logical\r\nconnection among the parts which have been put to use. A tempting method\r\nof preserving such a connection is, of course, the insertion of words or\r\nsentences which the speaker might have used, though he did not; but such\r\na method seemed too dangerous and possibly too misleading, and it has\r\nbeen carefully avoided. None of the selections contain a word of foreign\r\nmatter, with the exception of one of Randolph's speeches and Mr.\r\nBeecher's Liverpool speech, where the matter inserted has been taken\r\nfrom the only available report, and is not likely to mislead the reader.\r\nFor very much the same reason, footnotes have been avoided, and the\r\nspeakers have been left to speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nSuch a process of omission will reveal to any one who undertakes it an\r\nunderlying characteristic of our later, as distinguished from our\r\nearlier, oratory. The careful elaboration of the parts, the restraint of\r\neach topic treated to its appropriate part, and the systematic\r\ndevelopment of the parts into a symmetrical whole, are as markedly\r\npresent in the latter as they are absent in the former. The process of\r\nselection has therefore been progressively more difficult as the\r\nsubject-matter has approached contemporary times. In our earlier\r\norations, the distinction and separate treatment of the parts is so\r\ncarefully observed that it has been comparatively an easy task to seize\r\nand appropriate the parts especially desirable. In our later orations,\r\nwith some exceptions, there is an evidently decreasing attention to\r\nsystem. The whole is often a collection of _disjecta membra_ of\r\narguments, so interdependent that omissions of any sort are exceedingly\r\ndangerous to the meaning of the speaker. To do justice to his meaning,\r\nand give the whole oration, would be an impossible strain on the space\r\navailable; to omit any portion is usually to lose one or more buttresses\r\nof some essential feature in his argument. The distinction is submitted\r\nwithout any desire to explain it on theory, but only as a suggestion of\r\na practical difficulty in a satisfactory execution of the work.\r\n\r\nThe general division of the work has been into (1) Colonialism, to 1789;\r\n(2) Constitutional Government, to 1801; (5) the Rise of Democracy, to\r\n1815; (4) the Rise of Nationality, to 1840; (5) the Slavery struggle, to\r\n1860; (6) Secession and Reconstruction, to 1876; (7) Free Trade and\r\nProtection. In such a division, it has been found necessary to include,\r\nin a few cases, orations which have not been strictly within the time\r\nlimits of the topic, but have had a close logical connection with it. It\r\nis hoped, however, that all such cases will show their own necessity too\r\nclearly for any need of further ex-planation or excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIALISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said by an excellent authority that the Constitution was\r\n\"extorted from the grinding necessities of a reluctant people.\" The\r\ntruth of the statement is very quickly recognized by even the most\r\nsurface student of American politics. The struggle which began in 1774-5\r\nwas the direct outcome of the spirit of independence. Rather than submit\r\nto a degrading government by the arbitrary will of a foreign Parliament,\r\nthe Massachusetts people chose to enter upon an almost unprecedented war\r\nof a colony against the mother country. Rather than admit the precedent\r\nof the oppression of a sister colony, the other colonies chose to\r\nsupport Massachusetts in her resistance. Resistance to Parliament\r\ninvolved resistance to the Crown, the only power which had hitherto\r\nclaimed the loyalty of the colonists; and one evil feature of the\r\nRevolution was that the spirit of loyalty disappeared for a time from\r\nAmerican politics. There were, without doubt, many individual cases of\r\nloyalty to \"Continental interests\"; but the mass of the people had\r\nmerely unlearned their loyalty to the Crown, and had learned no other\r\nloyalty to take its place. Their nominal allegiance to the individual\r\ncolony was weakened by their underlying consciousness that they really\r\nwere a part of a greater nation; their national allegiance had never\r\nbeen claimed by any power.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the confederation was apparent even before its complete\r\nratification. The Articles of Confederation were proposed by the\r\nContinental Congress, Nov. 15, 1777. They were ratified by eleven States\r\nduring the year 1778, and Delaware ratified in 1779. Maryland alone held\r\nout and refused to ratify for two years longer. Her long refusal was due\r\nto her demand for a national control of the Western territory, which\r\nmany of the States were trying to appropriate. It was not until there\r\nwas positive evidence that the Western territory was to be national\r\nproperty that Maryland acceded to the articles, and they went into\r\noperation. The interval had given time for study of them, and their\r\ndefects were so patent that there was no great expectation among\r\nthinking men of any other result than that which followed. The national\r\npower which the confederation sought to create was an entire nonentity.\r\nThere was no executive power, except committees of Congress, and these\r\nhad no powers to execute. Congress had practically only the power to\r\nrecommend to the States. It had no power to tax, to support armies or\r\nnavies, to provide for the interest or payment of the public debt, to\r\nregulate commerce or internal affairs, or to perform any other function\r\nof an efficient national government. It was merely a convenient\r\ninstrument of repudiation for the States; Congress was to borrow money\r\nand incur debts, which the States could refuse or neglect to provide\r\nfor. Under this system affairs steadily drifted from bad to worse for\r\nsome six years after the formal ratification of the articles. There\r\nseemed to be no remedy in the forms of law, for the articles expressly\r\nprovided that no alteration was to be made except by the assent of every\r\nState. Congress proposed alterations, such as the temporary grant to\r\nCongress of power to levy duties on imports; but these proposals were\r\nalways vetoed by one or more states.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, in a private letter, Hamilton had suggested a convention of the\r\nStates to revise the articles, and as affairs grew worse the proposition\r\nwas renewed by others. The first attempt to hold such a convention, on\r\nthe call of Virginia, was a failure; but five States sent delegates to\r\nAnnapolis, and these wisely contented themselves with recommending\r\nanother convention in the following year. Congress was persuaded to\r\nendorse this summons; twelve of the States chose delegates, and the\r\nconvention met at Philadelphia, May, 14, 1787. A quorum was obtained,\r\nMay 25th, and the deliberations of the convention lasted until Sept.\r\n28th, when the Constitution was reported to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties which met the convention were mainly the results of the\r\ndivision of the States into large and small States. Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, the States which\r\nclaimed to extend to the Mississippi on the west and cherished\r\nindefinite expectations of future growth, were the \"large\" States. They\r\ndesired to give as much power as possible to the new national\r\ngovernment, on condition that the government should be so framed that\r\nthey should have control of it. The remaining States were properly\r\n\"small\" states, and desired to form a government which would leave as\r\nmuch power as possible to the States. Circumstances worked strongly in\r\nfavor of a reasonable result. There never were more than eleven States\r\nin the convention. Rhode Island, a small State, sent no delegates. The\r\nNew Hampshire delegates did not appear until the New York delegates\r\n(except Hamilton) had lost patience and retired from the convention.\r\nPennsylvania was usually neutral. The convention was thus composed of\r\nfive large, five small, and one neutral State; and almost all its\r\ndecisions were the outcome of judicious compromise.\r\n\r\nThe large States at first proposed a Congress in both of whose Houses\r\nthe State representation should be proportional. They would thus have\r\nhad a clear majority in both Houses, and, as Congress was to elect the\r\nPresident, and other officers, the government would thus have been a\r\nlarge State government. When \"the little States gained their point,\" by\r\nforcing through the equal representation of the States in the Senate,\r\nthe unsubstantial nature of the \"national\" pretensions of the large\r\nStates at once became apparent. The opposition to the whole scheme\r\ncentred in the large States, with very considerable assistance from New\r\nYork, which was not satisfied with the concessions which the small\r\nStates had obtained in the convention. The difficulty of ratification\r\nmay be estimated from the final votes in the following State\r\nconventions: Massachusetts, 187 to 163; New Hampshire, 57 to 46;\r\nVirginia, 89 to 79, and New York, 30 to 27. It should also be noted that\r\nthe last two ratifications were only made after the ninth State (New\r\nHampshire) had ratified, and when it was certain that the Constitution\r\nwould go into effect with or with-out the ratification of Virginia or\r\nNew York. North Carolina did not ratify until 1789, and Rhode Island not\r\nuntil 1790.\r\n\r\nThe division between North and South also appeared in the convention. In\r\norder to carry over the Southern States to the support of the final\r\ncompromise, it was necessary to insert a guarantee of the slave trade\r\nfor twenty years, and a provision that three fifths of the slaves should\r\nbe counted in estimating the population for State representation in\r\nCongress. But these provisions, so far as we can judge from the debates\r\nof the time, had no influence against the ratification of the\r\nConstitution; the struggle turned on the differences between the\r\nnational leaders, aided by the satisfied small States, on one side, and\r\nthe leaders of the State party, aided by the dissatisfied States, large\r\nand small, on the other. The former, the Federalists, were successful,\r\nthough by very narrow majorities in several of the States. Washington\r\nwas unanimously elected the first President of the Republic; and the new\r\ngovernment was inaugurated at New York, March 4, 1789.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Henry in the Virginia House of Delegates has been chosen\r\nas perhaps the best representative of the spirit which impelled and\r\nguided the American Revolution. It is fortunate that the ablest of the\r\nnational leaders was placed in the very focus of opposition to the\r\nConstitution, so that we may take Hamilton's argument in the New York\r\nconvention and Madison's in the Virginia convention, as the most\r\ncarefully stated conclusions of the master-minds of the National party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES OTIS\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS. (BORN 1725, DIED 1783.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE WRITS OF ASSISTANCE--BEFORE THE SUPERIOR COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS,\r\nFEBRUARY, 1761.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONORS: I was desired by one of the court to look\r\ninto the books, and consider the question now before them concerning\r\nWrits of Assistance. I have accordingly considered it, and now appear\r\nnot only in obedience to your order, but likewise in behalf of the\r\ninhabitants of this town, who have presented another petition, and out\r\nof regard to the liberties of the subject. And I take this opportunity\r\nto declare, that whether under a fee or not (for in such a cause as this\r\nI despise a fee), I will to my dying day oppose with all the powers and\r\nfaculties God has given me, all such instruments of slavery on the one\r\nhand, and villainy on the other, as this writ of assistance is.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me the worst instrument of arbitrary power, the most\r\ndestructive of English liberty and the fundamental principles of law,\r\nthat ever was found in an English law-book. I must therefore beg your\r\nhonors' patience and attention to the whole range of an argument, that\r\nmay perhaps appear uncommon in many things, as well as to points of\r\nlearning that are more remote and unusual: that the whole tendency of my\r\ndesign may the more easily be perceived, the conclusions better descend,\r\nand the force of them be better felt. I shall not think much of my pains\r\nin this cause, as I engaged in it from principle. I was solicited to\r\nargue this cause as Advocate-General; and because I would not, I have\r\nbeen charged with desertion from my office. To this charge I can give a\r\nvery sufficient answer. I renounced that office, and I argue this cause\r\nfrom the same principle; and I argue it with the greater pleasure, as it\r\nis in favor of British liberty, at a time when we hear the greatest\r\nmonarch upon earth declaring from his throne that he glories in the name\r\nof Briton, and that the privileges of his people are dearer to him than\r\nthe most valuable prerogatives of his crown; and as it is in opposition\r\nto a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods of history\r\ncost one king of England his head, and another his throne. I have taken\r\nmore pains in this cause than I ever will take again, although my\r\nengaging in this and another popular cause has raised much resentment.\r\nBut I think I can sincerely, declare, that I cheerfully submit myself to\r\nevery odious name for conscience' sake; and from my soul I despise all\r\nthose whose guilt, malice, or folly has made them my foes. Let the\r\nconsequences be what they will, I am determined to proceed. The only\r\nprinciples of public conduct, that are worthy of a gentleman or a man,\r\nare to sacrifice estate, ease, health, and applause, and even life, to\r\nthe sacred calls of his country.\r\n\r\nThese manly sentiments, in private life, make the good citizens; in\r\npublic life, the patriot and the hero. I do not say that, when brought\r\nto the test, I shall be invincible. I pray God I may never be brought to\r\nthe melancholy trial, but if ever I should, it will be then known how\r\nfar I can reduce to practice principles which I know to be founded in\r\ntruth. In the meantime I will proceed to the subject of this writ.\r\n\r\nYour honors will find in the old books concerning the office of a\r\njustice of the peace, precedents of general warrants to search suspected\r\nhouses. But in more modern books, you will find only special warrants to\r\nsearch such and such houses, specially named, in which the complainant\r\nhas before sworn that he suspects his goods are concealed; and will find\r\nit adjudged, that special warrants only are legal. In the same manner I\r\nrely on it, that the writ prayed for in this petition, being general, is\r\nillegal. It is a power that places the liberty of every man in the hands\r\nof every petty officer. I say I admit that special writs of assistance,\r\nto search special places, may be granted to certain persons on oath; but\r\nI deny that the writ now prayed for can be granted, for I beg leave to\r\nmake some observations on the writ itself, before I proceed to other\r\nacts of Parliament. In the first place, the writ is universal, being\r\ndirected \"to all and singular justices, sheriffs, constables, and all\r\nother officers and subjects\"; so that, in short, it is directed to every\r\nsubject in the king's dominions. Every one with this writ may be a\r\ntyrant; if this commission be legal, a tyrant in a legal manner, also,\r\nmay control, imprison, or murder anyone within the realm. In the next\r\nplace, it is perpetual, there is no return. A man is accountable to no\r\nperson for his doings. Every man may reign secure in his petty tyranny,\r\nand spread terror and desolation around him, until the trump of the\r\narchangel shall excite different emotions in his soul. In the third\r\nplace, a person with this writ, in the daytime, may enter all houses,\r\nshops, etc., at will, and command all to assist him. Fourthly, by this\r\nwrit, not only deputies, etc., but even their menial servants, are\r\nallowed to lord it over us. What is this but to have the curse of Canaan\r\nwith a witness on us: to be the servant of servants, the most despicable\r\nof God's creation? Now one of the most essential branches of English\r\nliberty is the freedom of one's house. A man's house is his castle; and\r\nwhilst he is quiet, he is as well guarded as a prince in his castle.\r\nThis writ, if it should be declared legal, would totally annihilate this\r\nprivilege. Custom-house officers may enter our houses when they please;\r\nwe are commanded to permit their entry. Their menial servants may enter,\r\nmay break locks, bars, and everything in their way; and whether they\r\nbreak through malice or revenge, no man, no court can inquire. Bare\r\nsuspicion without oath is sufficient. This wanton exercise of this power\r\nis not a chimerical suggestion of a heated brain. I will mention some\r\nfacts. Mr. Pew had one of these writs, and when Mr. Ware succeeded him,\r\nhe endorsed this writ over to Mr. Ware; so that these writs are\r\nnegotiable from one officer to another; and so your honors have no\r\nopportunity of judging the persons to whom this vast power is delegated.\r\nAnother instance is this: Mr. Justice Walley had called this same Mr.\r\nWare before him, by a constable, to answer for a breach of the\r\nSabbath-day acts, or that of profane swearing. As soon as he had\r\nfinished, Mr. Ware asked him if he had done. He replied, \"Yes.\" \"Well\r\nthen,\" said Mr. Ware, \"I will show you a little of my power. I command\r\nyou to permit me to search your house for uncustomed goods\"; and went on\r\nto search the house from the garret to the cellar; and then served the\r\nconstable in the same manner! But to show another absurdity in this\r\nwrit: if it should be established, I insist upon it every person, by the\r\n14th Charles Second, has this power as well as the custom-house\r\nofficers. The words are: \"it shall be lawful for any person or persons\r\nauthorized,\" etc. What a scene does this open! Every man prompted by\r\nrevenge, ill-humor, or wantonness to inspect the inside of his\r\nneighbor's house, may get a writ of assistance. Others will ask it from\r\nself-defence; one arbitrary exertion will provoke another, until society\r\nbe involved in tumult and in blood:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRICK HENRY\r\n\r\nOF VIRGINIA. (BORN 1736, DIED 1799)\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVENTION OF DELEGATES, MARCH 28, 1775\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nNo man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as\r\nabilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the\r\nHouse. But different men often see the same subject in different lights;\r\nand, therefore, I hope that it will not be thought disrespectful to\r\nthose gentlemen, if, entertaining as I do, opinions of a character very\r\nopposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without\r\nreserve. This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is\r\none of awful moment to this country. For my own part I consider it as\r\nnothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to\r\nthe magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It\r\nis only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfil the\r\ngreat responsibility Which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep\r\nback my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offence, I\r\nshould consider myself as guilty of treason toward my country, and of an\r\nact of disloyalty toward the majesty of heaven, which I revere above all\r\nearthly-kings.\r\n\r\nMr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope.\r\nWe are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the\r\nsong of that syren, till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part\r\nof wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we\r\ndisposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and\r\nhaving ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal\r\nsalvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am\r\nwilling to know the whole truth; to know the worst and to provide for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of\r\nexperience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past.\r\nAnd judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the\r\nconduct of the British ministry for the last ten years, to justify those\r\nhopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and\r\nthe House? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been\r\nlately received? Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet.\r\nSuffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how\r\nthis gracious reception of our petition comports with these war-like\r\npreparations which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and\r\narmies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown\r\nourselves so unwilling to be reconciled, that force must be called in to\r\nwin back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the\r\nimplements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings\r\nresort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array. If its\r\npurpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other\r\npossible motives for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of\r\nthe world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No,\r\nsir, she has none. They are meant for us; they can be meant for no\r\nother. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which\r\nthe British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to\r\noppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for\r\nthe last ten years. Have we any thing new to offer on the subject?\r\nNothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is\r\ncapable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and\r\nhumble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been\r\nalready exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves\r\nlonger. Sir, we have done every thing that could be done, to avert the\r\nstorm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated;\r\nwe have supplicated: we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and\r\nhave implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the\r\nministry and parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our\r\nremonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our\r\nsupplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with\r\ncontempt, from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may\r\nwe indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no longer\r\nany room for hope. If we wish to be free--if we mean to preserve\r\ninviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long\r\ncontending--if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which\r\nwe have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never\r\nto abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained,\r\nwe must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to\r\nthe God of Hosts is all that is left us!\r\n\r\nThey tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable\r\nan adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week,\r\nor the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a\r\nBritish guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather\r\nstrength by irresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of\r\neffectual resistance, by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the\r\ndelusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and\r\nfoot? Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of the means which\r\nthe God of nature bath placed in our power. Three millions of people,\r\narmed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which\r\nwe possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against\r\nus. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just\r\nGod who presides over the destinies of nations; and who will raise up\r\nfriends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the\r\nstrong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides.\r\nsir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now\r\ntoo late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat, but in\r\nsubmission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be\r\nheard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable--and let it come! I\r\nrepeat it, sir, let it come!\r\n\r\nIt is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry peace,\r\npeace--but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale\r\nthat sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of\r\nresounding arms. Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we\r\nhere idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life\r\nso dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains\r\nand slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may\r\ntake; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS (BORN 1722, DIED 1803.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE--IN PHILADELPHIA, AUGUST I, 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRYMEN AND BRETHREN: I would gladly have declined an honor, to which\r\nI find myself unequal. I have not the calmness and impartiality which\r\nthe infinite importance of this occasion demands. I will not deny the\r\ncharge of my enemies, that resentment for the accumulated injuries of\r\nour country, and an ardor for her glory, rising to enthusiasm, may\r\ndeprive me of that accuracy of judgment and expression which men of\r\ncooler passions may possess. Let me beseech you then, to hear me with\r\ncaution, to examine without prejudice, and to correct the mistakes into\r\nwhich I may be hurried by my zeal.\r\n\r\nTruth loves an appeal to the common sense of mankind. Your unperverted\r\nunderstandings can best determine on subjects of a practical nature. The\r\npositions and plans which are said to be above the comprehension of the\r\nmultitude may be always suspected to be visionary and fruitless. He who\r\nmade all men hath made the truths necessary to human happiness obvious\r\nto all.\r\n\r\nOur forefathers threw off the yoke of Popery in religion; for you is\r\nreserved the honor of levelling the Popery of politics. They opened the\r\nBible to all, and maintained the capacity of every man to judge for\r\nhimself in religion. Are we sufficient for the comprehension of the\r\nsublimest spiritual truths, and unequal to material and temporal ones?\r\nHeaven hath trusted us with the management of things for eternity, and\r\nman denies us ability to judge of the present, or to know from our\r\nfeelings the experience that will make us happy. \"You can discern,\" say\r\nthey, \"objects distant and remote, but cannot perceive those within your\r\ngrasp. Let us have the distribution of present goods, and cut out and\r\nmanage as you please the interests of futurity.\" This day, I trust, the\r\nreign of political protestantism will commence.\r\n\r\nWe have explored the temple of royalty, and found that the idol we have\r\nbowed down to, has eyes which see not, ears that hear not our prayers,\r\nand a heart like the nether millstone. We have this day restored the\r\nSovereign, to whom alone men ought to be obedient. He reigns in heaven,\r\nand with a propitious eye beholds His subjects assuming that freedom of\r\nthought and dignity of self-direction which He bestowed on them. From\r\nthe rising to the setting sun, may His kingdom come.\r\n\r\nMen who content themselves with the semblance of truth, and a display of\r\nwords, talk much of our obligations to Great Britain for protection. Had\r\nshe a single eye to our advantage? A nation of shopkeepers are very\r\nseldom so disinterested. Let us not be so amused with words; the\r\nextension of her commerce was her object. When she defended our coasts,\r\nshe fought for her customers, and convoyed our ships loaded with wealth,\r\nwhich we had acquired for her by our industry. She has treated us as\r\nbeasts of burthen, whom the lordly masters cherish that they may carry a\r\ngreater load. Let us inquire also against whom she has protected us?\r\nAgainst her own enemies with whom we had no quarrel, or only on her\r\naccount, and against whom we always readily exerted our wealth and\r\nstrength when they were required. Were these colonies backward in giving\r\nassistance to Great Britain, when they were called upon in 1739, to aid\r\nthe expedition against Carthagena? They at that time sent three thousand\r\nmen to join the British army, although the war commenced without their\r\nconsent. But the last war, 't is said, was purely American. This is a\r\nvulgar error, which, like many others, has gained credit by being\r\nconfidently repeated. The dispute between the Courts of Great Britain\r\nand France, related to the limits of Canada and Nova Scotia. The\r\ncontroverted territory was not claimed by any in the colonies, but by\r\nthe Crown of Great Britain. It was therefore their own quarrel. The\r\ninfringement of a right which England had, by the treaty of Utrecht, of\r\ntrading in the Indian country of Ohio, was another cause of the war. The\r\nFrench seized large quantities of British manufactures, and took\r\npossession of a fort which a company of British merchants and factors\r\nhad erected for the security of their commerce. The war was therefore\r\nwaged in defence of lands claimed by the Crown, and for the protection\r\nof British property. The French at that time had no quarrel with\r\nAmerica; and, as appears by letters sent from their commander-in-chief,\r\nto some of the colonies, wished to remain in peace with us. The part\r\ntherefore which we then took, and the miseries to which we exposed\r\nourselves, ought to be charged to our affection for Britain. These\r\ncolonies granted more than their proportion to the support of the war.\r\nThey raised, clothed, and maintained nearly twenty-five thousand men,\r\nand so sensible were the people of England of our great exertions, that\r\na message was annually sent to the House of Commons purporting: \"That\r\nhis majesty, being highly satisfied of the zeal and vigor with which his\r\nfaithful subjects in North America had exerted themselves in defence of\r\nhis majesty's just rights and possessions, recommend it to the House, to\r\ntake the same into consideration, and enable him to give them a proper\r\ncompensation.\"\r\n\r\nBut what purpose can arguments of this kind answer? Did the protection\r\nwe received annul our rights as men, and lay us under an obligation of\r\nbeing miserable?\r\n\r\nWho among you, my countrymen, that is a father, would claim authority to\r\nmake your child a slave because you had nourished him in his infancy?\r\n\r\n'T is a strange species of generosity which requires a return infinitely\r\nmore valuable than anything it could have bestowed; that demands as a\r\nreward for a defence of our property, a surrender of those inestimable\r\nprivileges, to the arbitrary will of vindictive tyrants, which alone\r\ngive value to that very property.\r\n\r\nCourage, then, my countrymen! our contest is not only whether we\r\nourselves shall be free, but whether there shall be left to mankind an\r\nasylum on earth, for civil and religious liberty? Dismissing, therefore,\r\nthe justice of our cause as incontestable, the only question is, What is\r\nbest for us to pursue in our present circumstances?\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of dependence on Great Britain is, I believe, generally\r\nexploded; but as I would attend to the honest weakness of the simplest\r\nof men, you will pardon me if I offer a few words on that subject.\r\n\r\nWe are now on this continent, to the astonishment of the world, three\r\nmillions of souls united in one common cause. We have large armies, well\r\ndisciplined and appointed, with commanders inferior to none in military\r\nskill, and superior in activity and zeal. We are furnished with arsenals\r\nand stores beyond our most sanguine expectations, and foreign nations\r\nare waiting to crown our success by their alliances. There are instances\r\nof, I would say, an almost astonishing Providence in our favor; our\r\nsuccess has staggered our enemies, and almost given faith to infidels;\r\nso that we may truly say it is not our own arm which has saved us.\r\n\r\nThe hand of Heaven appears to have led us on to be, perhaps, humble\r\ninstruments and means in the great Providential dispensation which is\r\ncompleting. We have fled from the political Sodom; let us not look back,\r\nlest we perish and become a monument of infamy and derision to the\r\nworld! For can we ever expect more unanimity and a better preparation\r\nfor defence; more infatuation of counsel among our enemies, and more\r\nvalor and zeal among ourselves? The same force and resistance which are\r\nsufficient to procure us our liberties, will secure us a glorious\r\nindependence and support us in the dignity of free, imperial states. We\r\ncan not suppose that our opposition has made a corrupt and dissipated\r\nnation more friendly to America, or created in them a greater respect\r\nfor the rights of mankind. We can therefore expect a restoration and\r\nestablishment of our privileges, and a compensation for the injuries we\r\nhave received from their want of power, from their fears, and not from\r\ntheir virtues. The unanimity and valor, which will effect an honorable\r\npeace, can render a future contest for our liberties unnecessary. He who\r\nhas strength to chain down the wolf, is a mad-man if he lets him loose\r\nwithout drawing his teeth and paring his nails.\r\n\r\nFrom the day on which an accommodation takes place between England and\r\nAmerica, on any other terms than as independent states, I shall date the\r\nruin of this country. A politic minister will study to lull us into\r\nsecurity, by granting us the full extent of our petitions. The warm\r\nsunshine of influence would melt down the virtue, which the violence of\r\nthe storm rendered more firm and unyielding. In a state of tranquillity,\r\nwealth, and luxury, our descendants would forget the arts of war, and\r\nthe noble activity and zeal which made their ancestors invincible. Every\r\nart of corruption would be employed to loosen the bond of union which\r\nrenders our resistance formidable. When the spirit of liberty which now\r\nanimates our hearts and gives success to our arms is extinct, our\r\nnumbers will accelerate our ruin, and render us easier victims to\r\ntyranny. Ye abandoned minions of an infatuated ministry, if peradventure\r\nany should yet remain among us!--remember that a Warren and a Montgomery\r\nare numbered among the dead. Contemplate the mangled bodies of your\r\ncountrymen, and then say, What should be the reward of such sacrifices?\r\nBid us and our posterity bow the knee, supplicate the friendship, and\r\nplough, and sow, and reap, to glut the avarice of the men who have let\r\nloose on us the dogs of war to riot in our blood, and hunt us from the\r\nface of the earth? If ye love wealth better than liberty, the\r\ntranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom--go from\r\nus in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the\r\nhands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may\r\nposterity, forget that ye were our countrymen.\r\n\r\nTo unite the Supremacy of Great Britain and the Liberty of America, is\r\nutterly impossible. So vast a continent and of such a distance from the\r\nseat of empire, will every day grow more unmanageable. The motion of so\r\nunwieldy a body cannot be directed with any dispatch and uniformity,\r\nwithout committing to the Parliament of Great Britain, powers\r\ninconsistent with our freedom. The authority and force which would be\r\nabsolutely necessary for the preservation of the peace and good order of\r\nthis continent, would put all our valuable rights within the reach of\r\nthat nation.\r\n\r\n*     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nSome who would persuade us that they have tender feelings for future\r\ngenerations, while they are insensible to the happiness of the present,\r\nare perpetually foreboding a train of dissensions under our popular\r\nsystem. Such men's reasoning amounts to this--give up all that is\r\nvaluable to Great Britain, and then you will have no inducements to\r\nquarrel among yourselves; or suffer yourselves to be chained down by\r\nyour enemies, that you may not be able to fight with your friends.\r\n\r\nThis is an insult on your virtue as well as your common sense. Your\r\nunanimity this day and through the course of the war is a decisive\r\nrefutation of such invidious predictions. Our enemies have already had\r\nevidence that our present constitution contains in it the justice and\r\nardor of freedom, and the wisdom and vigor of the most absolute system.\r\nWhen the law is the will of the people, it will be uniform and coherent;\r\nbut fluctuation, contradiction, and inconsistency of councils must be\r\nexpected under those governments where every revolution in the ministry\r\nof a court produces one in the state. Such being the folly and pride of\r\nall ministers, that they ever pursue measures directly opposite to those\r\nof their predecessors.\r\n\r\nWe shall neither be exposed to the necessary convulsions of elective\r\nMonarchies, nor to the want of wisdom, fortitude, and virtue, to which\r\nhereditary succession is liable. In your hands it will be to perpetuate\r\na prudent, active, and just legislature, and which will never expire\r\nuntil you yourselves lose the virtues which give it existence.\r\n\r\nAnd, brethren and fellow-countrymen, if it was ever granted to mortals\r\nto trace the designs of Providence, and interpret its manifestations in\r\nfavor of their cause, we may, with humility of soul, cry out, \"Not unto\r\nus, not unto us, but to thy Name be the praise.\" The confusion of the\r\ndevices among our enemies, and the rage of the elements against them,\r\nhave done almost as much towards our success as either our councils or\r\nour arms.\r\n\r\nThe time at which this attempt on our liberties was made, when we were\r\nripened into maturity, had acquired a knowledge of war, and were free\r\nfrom the incursions of enemies in this country, the gradual advances of\r\nour oppressors enabling us to prepare for our defence, the unusual\r\nfertility of our lands and clemency of the seasons, the success which at\r\nfirst attended our feeble arms, producing unanimity among our friends\r\nand reducing our internal foes to acquiescence,--these are all strong\r\nand palpable marks and assurances, that Providence is yet gracious unto\r\nZion, that it will turn away the captivity of Jacob.\r\n\r\nWe have now no other alternative than independence, or the most\r\nignominious and galling servitude. The legions of our enemies thicken on\r\nour plains; desolation and death mark their bloody career; whilst the\r\nmangled corpses of our countrymen seem to cry out to us as a voice from\r\nheaven: \"Will you permit our posterity to groan under the galling chains\r\nof our murderers? Has our blood been expended in vain? Is the only\r\nreward which our constancy, till death, has obtained for our country,\r\nthat it should be sunk into a deeper and more ignominious vassalage?\"\r\nRecollect who are the men that demand your submission; to whose decrees\r\nyou are invited to pay obedience! Men who, unmindful of their relation\r\nto you as brethren, of your long implicit submission to their laws; of\r\nthe sacrifice which you and your forefathers made of your natural\r\nadvantages for commerce to their avarice,--formed a deliberate plan to\r\nwrest from you the small pittance of property which they had permitted\r\nyou to acquire. Remember that the men who wish to rule over you are they\r\nwho, in pursuit of this plan of despotism, annulled the sacred contracts\r\nwhich had been made with your ancestors; conveyed into your cities a\r\nmercenary soldiery to compel you to submission by insult and murder--who\r\ncalled your patience, cowardice; your piety, hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nCountrymen! the men who now invite you to surrender your rights into\r\ntheir hands are the men who have let loose the merciless savages to riot\r\nin the blood of their brethren--who have dared to establish popery\r\ntriumphant in our land--who have taught treachery to your slaves, and\r\ncourted them to assassinate your wives and children.\r\n\r\nThese are the men to whom we are exhorted to sacrifice the blessings\r\nwhich Providence holds out to us--the happiness, the dignity of\r\nuncontrolled freedom and independence.\r\n\r\nLet not your generous indignation be directed against any among us who\r\nmay advise so absurd and madd'ning a measure. Their number is but few\r\nand daily decreased; and the spirit which can render them patient of\r\nslavery, will render them contemptible enemies.\r\n\r\nOur Union is now complete; our Constitution composed, established, and\r\napproved. You are now the guardians of your own liberties. We may justly\r\naddress you, as the _Decemviri_ did the Romans, and say: \"Nothing that\r\nwe propose, can pass into a law without your consent. Be yourselves, O\r\nAmericans, the authors of those laws on which your happiness depends.\"\r\n\r\nYou have now, in the field, armies sufficient to repel the whole force\r\nof your enemies, and their base and mercenary auxiliaries. The hearts of\r\nyour soldiers beat high with the spirit of freedom--they are animated\r\nwith the justice of their cause, and while they grasp their swords, can\r\nlook up to Heaven for assistance. Your adversaries are composed of\r\nwretches who laugh at the rights of humanity, who turn religion into\r\nderision, and would, for higher wages, direct their swords against their\r\nleaders or their country. Go on, then, in your generous enterprise, with\r\ngratitude to Heaven for past success, and confidence of it in the\r\nfuture. For my own part, I ask no greater blessing than to share with\r\nyou the common danger and common glory. If I have a wish dearer to my\r\nsoul, than that my ashes may be mingled with those of a Warren and a\r\nMontgomery, it is--that these American States may never cease to be free\r\nand independent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER HAMILTON,\r\n\r\nOF NEW YORK. (BORN 1757, DIED 1804.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EXPEDIENCY OF ADOPTING THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n--CONVENTION OF NEW YORK,\r\n\r\nJUNE 24, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am persuaded, Mr. Chairman, that I in my turn shall be indulged, in\r\naddressing the committee. We all, in equal sincerity, profess to be\r\nanxious for the establishment of a republican government, on a safe and\r\nsolid basis. It is the object of the wishes of every honest man in the\r\nUnited States, and I presume that I shall not be disbelieved, when I\r\ndeclare, that it is an object of all others, the nearest and most dear\r\nto my own heart. The means of accomplishing this great purpose become\r\nthe most important study which can interest mankind. It is our duty to\r\nexamine all those means with peculiar attention, and to choose the best\r\nand most effectual. It is our duty to draw from nature, from reason,\r\nfrom examples, the best principles of policy, and to pursue and apply\r\nthem in the formation of our government. We should contemplate and\r\ncompare the systems, which, in this examination, come under our view;\r\ndistinguish, with a careful eye, the defects and excellencies of each,\r\nand discarding the former, incorporate the latter, as far as\r\ncircumstances will admit, into our Constitution. If we pursue a\r\ndifferent course and neglect this duty, we shall probably disappoint the\r\nexpectations of our country and of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of a revolution, which received its birth from the\r\nusurpations of tyranny, nothing was more natural, than that the public\r\nmind should be influenced by an extreme spirit of jealousy. To resist\r\nthese encroachments, and to nourish this spirit, was the great object of\r\nall our public and private institutions. The zeal for liberty became\r\npredominant and excessive. In forming our confederation, this passion\r\nalone seemed to actuate us, and we appear to have had no other view than\r\nto secure ourselves from despotism. The object certainly was a valuable\r\none, and deserved our utmost attention. But, sir, there is another\r\nobject equally important, and which our enthusiasm rendered us little\r\ncapable of regarding: I mean a principle of strength and stability in\r\nthe organization of our government, and vigor in its operations. This\r\npurpose can never be accomplished but by the establishment of some\r\nselect body, formed peculiarly upon this principle. There are few\r\npositions more demonstrable than that there should be in every republic,\r\nsome permanent body to correct the prejudices, check the intemperate\r\npassions, and regulate the fluctuations of a popular assembly. It is\r\nevident, that a body instituted for these purposes, must be so formed as\r\nto exclude as much as possible from its own character, those infirmities\r\nand that mutability which it is designed to remedy. It is therefore\r\nnecessary that it should be small, that it should hold its authority\r\nduring a considerable period, and that it should have such an\r\nindependence in the exercise of its powers, as will divest it as much as\r\npossible of local prejudices. It should be so formed as to be the centre\r\nof political knowledge, to pursue always a steady line of conduct, and\r\nto reduce every irregular propensity to system. Without this\r\nestablishment, we may make experiments without end, but shall never have\r\nan efficient government.\r\n\r\nIt is an unquestionable truth, that the body of the people in every\r\ncountry desire sincerely its prosperity; but it is equally\r\nunquestionable, that they do not possess the discernment and stability\r\nnecessary for systematic government. To deny that they are frequently\r\nled into the grossest errors by misinformation and passion, would be a\r\nflattery which their own good sense must despise. That branch of\r\nadministration especially, which involves our political relations with\r\nforeign states, a community will ever be incompetent to. These truths\r\nare not often held up in public assemblies: but they cannot be unknown\r\nto any who hear me. From these principles it follows, that there ought\r\nto be two distinct bodies in our government: one, which shall be\r\nimmediately constituted by and peculiarly represent the people, and\r\npossess all the popular features; another, formed upon the principle,\r\nand for the purposes, before explained. Such considerations as these\r\ninduced the convention who formed your State constitution, to institute\r\na Senate upon the present plan. The history of ancient and modern\r\nrepublics had taught them, that many of the evils which these republics\r\nhad suffered, arose from the want of a certain balance and mutual\r\ncontrol indispensable to a wise administration; they were convinced that\r\npopular assemblies are frequently misguided by ignorance, by sudden\r\nimpulses, and the intrigues of ambitious men; and that some firm barrier\r\nagainst these operations was necessary; they, therefore, instituted your\r\nSenate, and the benefits we have experienced have fully justified their\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in their reasoning, have placed the interests of the several\r\nStates, and those of the United States in contrast; this is not a fair\r\nview of the subject; they must necessarily be involved in each other.\r\nWhat we apprehend is, that some sinister prejudice, or some prevailing\r\npassion, may assume the form of a genuine interest. The influence of\r\nthese is as powerful as the most permanent conviction of the public\r\ngood; and against this influence we ought to provide. The local\r\ninterests of a State ought in every case to give way to the interests of\r\nthe Union; for when a sacrifice of one or the other is necessary, the\r\nformer becomes only an apparent, partial interest, and should yield, on\r\nthe principle that the small good ought never to oppose the great one.\r\nWhen you assemble from your several counties in the Legislature, were\r\nevery member to be guided only by the apparent interests of his county,\r\ngovernment would be impracticable. There must be a perpetual\r\naccommodation and sacrifice of local advantages to general expediency;\r\nbut the spirit of a mere popular assembly would rarely be actuated by\r\nthis important principle. It is therefore absolutely necessary that the\r\nSenate should be so formed, as to be unbiased by false conceptions of\r\nthe real interests, or undue attachment to the apparent good of their\r\nseveral States.\r\n\r\nGentlemen indulge too many unreasonable apprehensions of danger to the\r\nState governments; they seem to suppose that the moment you put men into\r\na national council, they become corrupt and tyrannical, and lose all\r\ntheir affection for their fellow-citizens. But can we imagine that the\r\nSenators will ever be so insensible of their own advantage, as to\r\nsacrifice the genuine interest of their constituents? The State\r\ngovernments are essentially necessary to the form and spirit of the\r\ngeneral system. As long, therefore, as Congress has a full conviction of\r\nthis necessity, they must, even upon principles purely national, have as\r\nfirm an attachment to the one as to the other. This conviction can never\r\nleave them, unless they become madmen. While the constitution continues\r\nto be read, and its principle known, the States must, by every rational\r\nman, be considered as essential, component parts of The Union; and\r\ntherefore the idea of sacrificing the former to the latter is wholly\r\ninadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe objectors do not advert to the natural strength and resources of\r\nState governments, which will ever give them an important superiority\r\nover the general government. If we compare the nature of their different\r\npowers, or the means of popular influence which each possesses, we shall\r\nfind the advantage entirely on the side of the States. This\r\nconsideration, important as it is, seems to have been little attended\r\nto. The aggregate number of representatives throughout the States may be\r\ntwo thousand. Their personal influence will, therefore, be\r\nproportionably more extensive than that of one or two hundred men in\r\nCongress. The State establishments of civil and military officers of\r\nevery description, infinitely surpassing in number any possible\r\ncorrespondent establishments in the general government, will create such\r\nan extent and complication of attachments, as will ever secure the\r\npredilection and support of the people. Whenever, therefore, Congress\r\nshall meditate any infringement of the State constitutions, the great\r\nbody of the people will naturally take part with their domestic\r\nrepresentatives. Can the general government withstand such an united\r\nopposition? Will the people suffer themselves to be stripped of their\r\nprivileges? Will they suffer their Legislatures to be reduced to a\r\nshadow and a name? The idea is shocking to common-sense.\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstances already explained, and many others which might be\r\nmentioned, results a complicated, irresistible check, which must ever\r\nsupport the existence and importance of the State governments. The\r\ndanger, if any exists, flows from an opposite source. The probable evil\r\nis, that the general government will be too dependent on the State\r\nLegislatures, too much governed by their prejudices, and too obsequious\r\nto their humors; that the States, with every power in their hands, will\r\nmake encroachments on the national authority, till the Union is weakened\r\nand dissolved.\r\n\r\nEvery member must have been struck with an observation of a gentleman\r\nfrom Albany. Do what you will, says he, local prejudices and opinions\r\nwill go into the government.\r\n\r\nWhat! shall we then form a constitution to cherish and strengthen these\r\nprejudices? Shall we confirm the distemper, instead of remedying it. It\r\nis undeniable that there must be a control somewhere. Either the general\r\ninterest is to control the particular interests, or the contrary. If the\r\nformer, then certainly the government ought to be so framed, as to\r\nrender the power of control efficient to all intents and purposes; if\r\nthe latter, a striking absurdity follows; the controlling powers must be\r\nas numerous as the varying interests, and the operations of the\r\ngovernment must therefore cease; for the moment you accommodate these\r\ndifferent interests, which is the only way to set the government in\r\nmotion, you establish a controlling power. Thus, whatever constitutional\r\nprovisions are made to the contrary, every government will be at last\r\ndriven to the necessity of subjecting the partial to the universal\r\ninterest. The gentlemen ought always, in their reasoning, to distinguish\r\nbetween the real, genuine good of a State, and the opinions and\r\nprejudices which may prevail respecting it; the latter may be opposed to\r\nthe general good, and consequently ought to be sacrificed; the former is\r\nso involved in it, that it never can be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nThere are certain social principles in human nature from which we may\r\ndraw the most solid conclusions with respect to the conduct of\r\nindividuals and of communities. We love our families more than our\r\nneighbors; we love our neighbors more than our countrymen in general.\r\nThe human affections, like the solar heat, lose their intensity as they\r\ndepart from the centre, and become languid in proportion to the\r\nexpansion of the circle on which they act. On these principles, the\r\nattachment of the individual will be first and forever secured by the\r\nState governments; they will be a mutual protection and support. Another\r\nsource of influence, which has already been pointed out, is the various\r\nofficial connections in the States. Gentlemen endeavor to evade the\r\nforce of this by saying that these offices will be insignificant. This\r\nis by no means true. The State officers will ever be important, because\r\nthey are necessary and useful. Their powers are such as are extremely\r\ninteresting to the people; such as affect their property, their liberty,\r\nand life. What is more important than the administration of justice and\r\nthe execution of the civil and criminal laws? Can the State governments\r\nbecome insignificant while they have the power of raising money\r\nindependently and without control? If they are really useful; if they\r\nare calculated to promote the essential interests of the people; they\r\nmust have their confidence and support. The States can never lose their\r\npowers till the whole people of America are robbed of their liberties.\r\nThese must go together; they must support each other, or meet one common\r\nfate. On the gentleman's principle, we may safely trust the State\r\ngovernments, though we have no means of resisting them; but we cannot\r\nconfide in the national government, though we have an effectual\r\nconstitutional guard against every encroachment. This is the essence of\r\ntheir argument, and it is false and fallacious beyond conception.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the jurisdiction of the two governments, I shall\r\ncertainly admit that the Constitution ought to be so formed as not to\r\nprevent the States from providing for their own existence; and I\r\nmaintain that it is so formed; and that their power of providing for\r\nthemselves is sufficiently established. This is conceded by one\r\ngentleman, and in the next breath the concession is retracted. He says\r\nCongress has but one exclusive right in taxation--that of duties on\r\nimports; certainly, then, their other powers are only concurrent. But to\r\ntake off the force of this obvious conclusion, he immediately says that\r\nthe laws of the United States are supreme; and that where there is one\r\nsupreme there cannot be a concurrent authority; and further, that where\r\nthe laws of the Union are supreme, those of the States must be\r\nsubordinate; because there cannot be two supremes. This is curious\r\nsophistry. That two supreme powers cannot act together is false. They\r\nare inconsistent only when they are aimed at each other or at one\r\nindivisible object. The laws of the United States are supreme, as to all\r\ntheir proper, constitutional objects; the laws of the States are supreme\r\nin the same way. These supreme laws may act on different objects without\r\nclashing; or they may operate on different parts of the same common\r\nobject with perfect harmony. Suppose both governments should lay a tax\r\nof a penny on a certain article; has not each an independent and\r\nuncontrollable power to collect its own tax? The meaning of the maxim,\r\nthere cannot be two supremes, is simply this--two powers cannot be\r\nsupreme over each other. This meaning is entirely perverted by the\r\ngentlemen. But, it is said, disputes between collectors are to be\r\nreferred to the federal courts. This is again wandering in the field of\r\nconjecture. But suppose the fact is certain; is it not to be presumed\r\nthat they will express the true meaning of the Constitution and the\r\nlaws? Will they not be bound to consider the concurrent jurisdiction; to\r\ndeclare that both the taxes shall have equal operation; that both the\r\npowers, in that respect, are sovereign and co-extensive? If they\r\ntransgress their duty, we are to hope that they will be punished. Sir,\r\nwe can reason from probabilities alone. When we leave common-sense, and\r\ngive ourselves up to conjecture, there can be no certainty, no security\r\nin our reasonings.\r\n\r\nI imagine I have stated to the committee abundant reasons to prove the\r\nentire safety of the State governments and of the people. I would go\r\ninto a more minute consideration of the nature of the concurrent\r\njurisdiction, and the operation of the laws in relation to revenue; but\r\nat present I feel too much indisposed to proceed. I shall, with leave of\r\nthe committee, improve another opportunity of expressing to them more\r\nfully my ideas on this point. I wish the committee to remember that the\r\nConstitution under examination is framed upon truly republican\r\nprinciples; and that, as it is expressly designed to provide for the\r\ncommon protection and the general welfare of the United States, it must\r\nbe utterly repugnant to this Constitution to subvert the State\r\ngovernments or oppress the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON,\r\n\r\nOF VIRGINIA. (BORN 1751, DIED 1836.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EXPEDIENCY OF ADOPTING THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION--CONVENTION OF\r\nVIRGINIA,\r\n\r\nJUNE 6, 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN:\r\n\r\nIn what I am about to offer to this assembly, I shall not attempt to\r\nmake impressions by any ardent professions of zeal for the public\r\nwelfare. We know that the principles of every man will be, and ought to\r\nbe, judged not by his professions and declarations, but by his conduct.\r\nBy that criterion, I wish, in common with every other member, to be\r\njudged; and even though it should prove unfavorable to my reputation,\r\nyet it is a criterion from which I by no means would depart, nor could\r\nif I would. Comparisons have been made between the friends of this\r\nconstitution and those who oppose it. Although I disapprove of such\r\ncomparisons, I trust that in everything that regards truth, honor,\r\ncandor, and rectitude of motives, the friends of this system, here and\r\nin other States, are not inferior to its opponents. But professions of\r\nattachment to the public good, and comparisons of parties, at all times\r\ninvidious, ought not to govern or influence us now. We ought, sir, to\r\nexamine the Constitution exclusively on its own merits. We ought to\r\ninquire whether it will promote the public happiness; and its aptitude\r\nto produce that desirable object ought to be the exclusive subject of\r\nour researches. In this pursuit, we ought to address our arguments not\r\nto the feelings and passions, but to those understandings and judgments\r\nwhich have been selected, by the people of this country, to decide that\r\ngreat question by a calm and rational investigation. I hope that\r\ngentlemen, in displaying their abilities on this occasion, will, instead\r\nof giving opinions and making assertions, condescend to prove and\r\ndemonstrate, by fair and regular discussion. It gives me pain to hear\r\ngentlemen continually distorting the natural construction of language.\r\nAssuredly, it is sufficient if any human production can stand a fair\r\ndiscussion. Before I proceed to make some additions to the reasons which\r\nhave been adduced by my honorable friend over the way, I must take the\r\nliberty to make some observations on what was said by another gentleman\r\n(Mr. Henry). He told us that this constitution ought to be rejected,\r\nbecause, in his opinion, it endangered the public liberty in many\r\ninstances. Give me leave to make one answer to that observation--let the\r\ndangers with which this system is supposed to be replete, be clearly\r\npointed out. If any dangerous and unnecessary powers be given to the\r\ngeneral legislature, let them be plainly demonstrated, and let us not\r\nrest satisfied with general assertions of dangers, without proof,\r\nwithout examination. If powers be necessary, apparent danger is not a\r\nsufficient reason against conceding them. He has suggested, that\r\nlicentiousness has seldom produced the loss of liberty; but that the\r\ntyranny of rulers has almost always effected it. Since the general\r\ncivilization of mankind, I believe there are more instances of the\r\nabridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent\r\nencroachments of those in power, than by violent and sudden usurpations;\r\nbut on a candid examination of history, we shall find that turbulence,\r\nviolence, and abuse of power, by the majority trampling on the rights of\r\nthe minority, have produced factions and commotions which, in republics,\r\nhave, more frequently than any other cause, produced despotism. If we go\r\nover the whole history of ancient and modern republics, we shall find\r\ntheir destruction to have generally resulted from those causes. If we\r\nconsider the peculiar situation of the United States, and go to the\r\nsources of that diversity of sentiment which pervades its inhabitants,\r\nwe shall find great danger to fear that the same causes may terminate\r\nhere in the same fatal effects which they produced in those republics.\r\nThis danger ought to be wisely guarded against. In the progress of this\r\ndiscussion, it will perhaps appear, that the only possible remedy for\r\nthose evils, and the only certain means of preserving and protecting the\r\nprinciples of republicanism, will be found in that very system which is\r\nnow exclaimed against as the parent of oppression. I must confess that I\r\nhave not been able to find his usual consistency in the gentleman's\r\narguments on this occasion. He informs us that the people of this\r\ncountry are at perfect repose; that every man enjoys the fruits of his\r\nlabor peaceably and securely, and that everything is in perfect\r\ntranquillity and safety. I wish sincerely, sir, this were true. But if\r\nthis be really their situation, why has every State acknowledged the\r\ncontrary? Why were deputies from all the States sent to the general\r\nconvention? Why have complaints of national and individual distresses\r\nbeen echoed and re-echoed throughout the continent? Why has our general\r\ngovernment been so shamefully disgraced, and our Constitution violated?\r\nWherefore have laws been made to authorize a change, and wherefore are\r\nwe now assembled here? A federal government is formed for the protection\r\nof its individual members. Ours was itself attacked with impunity. Its\r\nauthority has been boldly disobeyed and openly despised. I think I\r\nperceive a glaring inconsistency in another of his arguments. He\r\ncomplains of this Constitution, because it requires the consent of at\r\nleast three fourths of the States to introduce amendments which shall be\r\nnecessary for the happiness of the people. The assent of so many, he\r\nconsiders as too great an obstacle to the admission of salutary\r\namendments, which he strongly insists ought to be at the will of a bare\r\nmajority, and we hear this argument at the very moment we are called\r\nupon to assign reasons for proposing a Constitution which puts it in the\r\npower of nine States to abolish the present inadequate, unsafe, and\r\npernicious confederation! In the first case, he asserts that a majority\r\nought to have the power of altering the government, when found to be\r\ninadequate to the security of public happiness. In the last case, he\r\naffirms that even three fourths of the community have not a right to\r\nalter a government which experience has proved to be subversive of\r\nnational felicity; nay, that the most necessary and urgent alterations\r\ncannot be made without the absolute unanimity of all the States. Does\r\nnot the thirteenth article of the confederation expressly require, that\r\nno alteration shall be made without the unanimous consent of all the\r\nStates? Can any thing in theory be more perniciously improvident and\r\ninjudicious than this submission of the will of the majority to the most\r\ntrifling minority? Have not experience and practice actually manifested\r\nthis theoretical inconvenience to be extremely impolitic? Let me mention\r\none fact, which I conceive must carry conviction to the mind of any\r\none,--the smallest State in the Union has obstructed every attempt to\r\nreform the government; that little member has repeatedly disobeyed and\r\ncounteracted the general authority; nay, has even supplied the enemies\r\nof its country with provisions. Twelve States had agreed to certain\r\nimprovements which were proposed, being thought absolutely necessary to\r\npreserve the existence of the general government; but as these\r\nimprovements, though really indispensable, could not, by the\r\nconfederation, be introduced into it without the consent of every State,\r\nthe refractory dissent of that little State prevented their adoption.\r\nThe inconveniences resulting from this requisition of unanimous\r\nconcurrence in alterations of the confederation, must be known to every\r\nmember in this convention; it is therefore needless to remind them of\r\nthem. Is it not self-evident, that a trifling minority ought not to bind\r\nthe majority? Would not foreign influence be exerted with facility over\r\na small minority? Would the honorable gentleman agree to continue the\r\nmost radical defects in the old system, because the petty State of Rhode\r\nIsland would not agree to remove them?\r\n\r\nHe next objects to the exclusive legislation over the district where the\r\nseat of the government may be fixed. Would he submit that the\r\nrepresentatives of this State should carry on their deliberations under\r\nthe control of any one member of the Union? If any State had the power\r\nof legislation over the place where Congress should fix the general\r\ngovernment, it would impair the dignity and hazard the safety of\r\nCongress. If the safety of the Union were under the control of any\r\nparticular State, would not foreign corruption probably prevail in such\r\na State, to induce it to exert its controlling influence over the\r\nmembers of the general government? Gentlemen cannot have forgotten the\r\ndisgraceful insult which Congress received some years ago. And, sir,\r\nwhen we also reflect, that the previous cession of particular States is\r\nnecessary, before Congress can legislate exclusively anywhere, we must,\r\ninstead of being alarmed at this part, heartily approve of it.\r\n\r\nBut the honorable member sees great danger in the provision concerning\r\nthe militia. Now, sir, this I conceive to be an additional security to\r\nour liberties, without diminishing the power of the States in any\r\nconsiderable degree; it appears to me so highly expedient, that I should\r\nimagine it would have found advocates even in the warmest friends of the\r\npresent system. The authority of training the militia and appointing the\r\nofficers is reserved to the States. But Congress ought to have the power\r\nof establishing a uniform system of discipline throughout the States;\r\nand to provide for the execution of the laws, suppress insurrections,\r\nand repel invasions. These are the only cases wherein they can interfere\r\nwith the militia; and the obvious necessity of their having power over\r\nthem in these cases must flash conviction on any reflecting mind.\r\nWithout uniformity of discipline, military bodies would be incapable of\r\naction; without a general controlling power to call forth the strength\r\nof the Union, for the purpose of repelling invasions, the country might\r\nbe overrun and conquered by foreign enemies. Without such a power to\r\nsuppress insurrections, our liberties might be destroyed by intestine\r\nfaction, and domestic tyranny be established.\r\n\r\nGive me leave to say something of the nature of the government, and to\r\nshow that it is perfectly safe and just to vest it with the power of\r\ntaxation. There are a number of opinions; but the principal question is,\r\nwhether it be a federal or a consolidated government. In order to judge\r\nproperly of the question before us, we must consider it minutely, in its\r\nprincipal parts. I myself conceive that it is of a mixed nature; it is,\r\nin a manner, unprecedented. We cannot find one express prototype in the\r\nexperience of the world: it stands by itself. In some respects, it is a\r\ngovernment of a federal nature; in others, it is of a consolidated\r\nnature. Even if we attend to the manner in which the Constitution is\r\ninvestigated, ratified, and made the act of the people of America, I can\r\nsay, notwithstanding what the honorable gentleman has alleged, that this\r\ngovernment is not completely consolidated; nor is it entirely federal.\r\nWho are the parties to it? The people--not the people as composing one\r\ngreat body, but the people as composing thirteen sovereignties. Were it,\r\nas the gentleman asserts, a consolidated government, the assent of a\r\nmajority of the people would be sufficient for its establishment, and as\r\na majority have adopted it already, the remaining States would be bound\r\nby the act of the majority, even if they unanimously reprobated it. Were\r\nit such a government as is suggested, it would be now binding on the\r\npeople of this State, without having had the privilege of deliberating\r\nupon it; but, sir, no State is bound by it, as it is, without its own\r\nconsent. Should all the States adopt it, it will be then a government\r\nestablished by the thirteen States of America, not through the\r\nintervention of the legislatures, but by the people at large. In this\r\nparticular respect, the distinction between the existing and proposed\r\ngovernments is very material. The existing system has been derived from\r\nthe dependent, derivative authority of the legislatures of the States;\r\nwhereas this is derived from the superior power of the people. If we\r\nlook at the manner in which alterations are to be made in it, the same\r\nidea is in some degree attended to. By the new system, a majority of the\r\nStates cannot introduce amendments; nor are all the States required for\r\nthat purpose; three fourths of them must concur in alterations; in this\r\nthere is a departure from the federal idea. The members to the national\r\nHouse of Representatives are to be chosen by the people at large, in\r\nproportion to the numbers in the respective districts. When we come to\r\nthe Senate, its members are elected by the States in their equal and\r\npolitical capacity; but had the government been completely consolidated,\r\nthe Senate would have been chosen by the people, in their individual\r\ncapacity, in the same manner as the members of the other house. Thus it\r\nis of complicated nature, and this complication, I trust, will be found\r\nto exclude the evils of absolute consolidation, as well as of a mere\r\nconfederacy. If Virginia were separated from all the States, her power\r\nand authority would extend to all cases; in like manner, were all powers\r\nvested in the general government, it would be a consolidated government;\r\nbut the powers of the federal government are enumerated; it can only\r\noperate in certain cases: it has legislative powers on defined and\r\nlimited objects, beyond which it cannot extend its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nBut the honorable member has satirized, with peculiar acrimony, the\r\npowers given to the general government by this Constitution. I conceive\r\nthat the first question on this subject is, whether these powers be\r\nnecessary; if they be, we are reduced to the dilemma of either\r\nsubmitting to the inconvenience, or losing the Union. Let us consider\r\nthe most important of these reprobated powers; that of direct taxation\r\nis most generally objected to. With respect to the exigencies of\r\ngovernment, there is no question but the most easy mode of providing for\r\nthem will be adopted. When, therefore, direct taxes are not necessary,\r\nthey will not be recurred to. It can be of little advantage to those in\r\npower, to raise money in a manner oppressive to the people. To consult\r\nthe conveniences of the people, will cost them nothing, and in many\r\nrespects will be advantageous to them. Direct taxes will only be\r\nrecurred to for great purposes. What has brought on other nations those\r\nimmense debts, under the pressure of which many of them labor? Not the\r\nexpenses of their governments, but war. If this country should be\r\nengaged in war, (and I conceive we ought to provide for the possibility\r\nof such a case,) how would it be carried on? By the usual means provided\r\nfrom year to year? As our imports will be necessary for the expenses of\r\ngovernment, and other common exigencies, how are we to carry on the\r\nmeans of defence? How is it possible a war could be supported without\r\nmoney or credit? And would it be possible for government to have credit,\r\nwithout having the power of raising money? No, it would be impossible\r\nfor any government, in such a case, to defend itself. Then, I say, sir,\r\nthat it is necessary to establish funds for extraordinary exigencies,\r\nand give this power to the general government; for the utter inutility\r\nof previous requisitions on the States is too well known. Would it be\r\npossible for those countries, whose finances and revenues are carried to\r\nthe highest perfection, to carry on the operations of government on\r\ngreat emergencies, such as the maintenance of a war, without an\r\nuncontrolled power of raising money? Has it not been necessary for Great\r\nBritain, notwithstanding the facility of the collection of her taxes, to\r\nhave recourse very often to this and other extraordinary methods of\r\nprocuring money? Would not her public credit have been ruined, if it was\r\nknown that her power to raise money was limited? Has not France been\r\nobliged, on great occasions, to recur to unusual means, in order to\r\nraise funds? It has been the case in many countries, and no government\r\ncan exist unless its powers extend to make provisions for every\r\ncontingency. If we were actually attacked by a powerful nation, and our\r\ngeneral government had not the power of raising money, but depended\r\nsolely on requisitions, our condition would be truly deplorable: if the\r\nrevenues of this commonwealth were to depend on twenty distinct\r\nauthorities, it would be impossible for it to carry on its operations.\r\nThis must be obvious to every member here: I think, therefore, that it\r\nis necessary for the preservation of the Union, that this power should\r\nbe given to the general government.\r\n\r\nBut it is urged, that its consolidated nature, joined to the power of\r\ndirect taxation, will give it a tendency to destroy all subordinate\r\nauthority; that its increasing influence will speedily enable it to\r\nabsorb the State governments. I cannot bring myself to think that this\r\nwill be the case. If the general government were wholly independent of\r\nthe governments of the particular States, then indeed, usurpation might\r\nbe expected to the fullest extent: but, sir, on whom does this general\r\ngovernment depend? It derives its authority from these governments, and\r\nfrom the same sources from which their authority is derived. The members\r\nof the federal government are taken from the same men from whom those of\r\nthe State legislatures are taken. If we consider the mode in which the\r\nfederal representatives will be chosen, we shall be convinced, that the\r\ngeneral never will destroy the individual governments; and this\r\nconviction must be strengthened by an attention to the construction of\r\nthe Senate. The representatives will be chosen, probably under the\r\ninfluence of the State legislatures: but there is not the least\r\nprobability that the election of the latter will be influenced by the\r\nformer. One hundred and sixty members representing this commonwealth in\r\none branch of the legislature, are drawn from the people at large, and\r\nmust ever possess more influence than the few men who will be elected to\r\nthe general legislature. Those who wish to become federal\r\nrepresentatives, must depend on their credit with that class of men who\r\nwill be the most popular in their counties, who generally represent the\r\npeople in the State governments: they can, therefore, never succeed in\r\nany measure contrary to the wishes of those on whom they depend. So\r\nthat, on the whole, it is almost certain that the deliberations of the\r\nmembers of the federal House of Representatives will be directed to the\r\ninterests of the people of America. As to the other branch, the Senators\r\nwill be appointed by the legislatures, and, though elected for six\r\nyears, I do not conceive they will so soon forget the source whence they\r\nderive their political existence. This election of one branch of the\r\nfederal, by the State legislatures, secures an absolute independence of\r\nthe former on the latter. The biennial exclusion of one third will\r\nlessen the facility of a combination, and preclude all likelihood of\r\nintrigues. I appeal to our past experience, whether they will attend to\r\nthe interests of their constituent States. Have not those gentlemen who\r\nhave been honored with seats in Congress often signalized themselves by\r\ntheir attachment to their States? Sir, I pledge myself that this\r\ngovernment will answer the expectations of its friends, and foil the\r\napprehensions of its enemies. I am persuaded that the patriotism of the\r\npeople will continue, and be a sufficient guard to their liberties, and\r\nthat the tendency of the Constitution will be, that the State\r\ngovernments will counteract the general interest, and ultimately\r\nprevail. The number of the representatives is yet sufficient for our\r\nsafety, and will gradually increase; and if we consider their different\r\nsources of information, the number will not appear too small.\r\n\r\nSir, that part of the proposed Constitution which gives the general\r\ngovernment the power of laying and collecting taxes, is indispensable\r\nand essential to the existence of any efficient, or well organized\r\nsystem of government: if we consult reason, and be ruled by its\r\ndictates, we shall find its justification there: if we review the\r\nexperience we have had, or contemplate the history of nations, there too\r\nwe shall find ample reasons to prove its expediency. It would be\r\npreposterous to depend for necessary supplies on a body which is fully\r\npossessed of the power of withholding them. If a government depends on\r\nother governments for its revenues; if it must depend on the voluntary\r\ncontributions of its members, its existence must be precarious. A\r\ngovernment that relies on thirteen independent sovereignties for the\r\nmeans of its existence, is a solecism in theory, and a mere nullity in\r\npractice. Is it consistent with reason, that such a government can\r\npromote the happiness of any people? It is subversive of every principle\r\nof sound policy, to trust the safety of a community with a government\r\ntotally destitute of the means of protecting itself or its members. Can\r\nCongress, after the repeated unequivocal proofs it has experienced of\r\nthe utter inutility and inefficacy of requisitions, reasonably expect\r\nthat they would be hereafter effectual or productive?\r\n\r\nWill not the same local interests, and other causes, militate against a\r\ncompliance? Whoever hopes the contrary must for ever be disappointed.\r\nThe effect, sir, cannot be changed without a removal of the cause. Let\r\neach county in this commonwealth be supposed free and independent: let\r\nyour revenues depend on requisitions of proportionate quotas from them:\r\nlet application be made to them repeatedly, and then ask yourself, is it\r\nto be presumed that they would comply, or that an adequate collection\r\ncould be made from partial compliances? It is now difficult to collect\r\nthe taxes from them: how much would that difficulty be enhanced, were\r\nyou to depend solely on their generosity? I appeal to the reason of\r\nevery gentleman here, and to his candor, to say whether he is not\r\npersuaded that the present confederation is as feeble as the government\r\nof Virginia would be in that case; to the same reason I appeal, whether\r\nit be compatible with prudence to continue a government of such manifest\r\nand palpable weakness and inefficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. -- CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitutional government in the United States began, in its national\r\nphase, with the inauguration of Washington, but the experiment was for a\r\nlong time a doubtful one. Of the two parties, the federal and the\r\nanti-federal parties, which had faced one another on the question of the\r\nadoption of the Constitution, the latter had disappeared. Its\r\nconspicuous failure to achieve the fundamental object of its existence,\r\nand the evident hopelessnesss of reversing its failure in future,\r\nblotted it out of existence. There was left but one party, the federal\r\nparty; and it, strong as it appeared, was really in almost as precarious\r\na position as its former opponent, because of the very completeness of\r\nits success in achieving its fundamental object. Hamilton and Jefferson,\r\ntwo of its representative members, were opposed in almost all the\r\npolitical instincts of their natures; the former chose the restraints of\r\nstrong government as instinctively as the latter clung to individualism.\r\nThey had been accidentally united for the time in desiring the adoption\r\nof the Constitution, though Hamilton considered it only a temporary\r\nshift for something stronger, while Jefferson wished for a bill of\r\nrights to weaken the force of some of its implications. Now that the\r\nConstitution was ratified, what tie was there to hold these two to any\r\nunited action for the future? Nothing but a shadow--the name of a party\r\nnot yet two years old. As soon, therefore, as the federal party fairly\r\nentered upon a secure tenure of power, the divergent instincts of the\r\ntwo classes represented by Hamilton and Jefferson began to show\r\nthemselves more distinctly until there was no longer any pretence of\r\nparty unity, and the democratic (or republican) party assumed its place,\r\nin 1792-3, as the recognized opponent of the party in power. It would be\r\nbeside the purpose to attempt to enumerate the points in which the\r\nnatural antagonism of the federalists and the republicans came to the\r\nsurface during the decade of contest which ended in the downfall of the\r\nfederal party in 1800-1. In all of them, in the struggles over the\r\nestablishment of the Bank of the United States and the assumption of the\r\nState debts, in the respective sympathy for France and Great Britain, in\r\nthe strong federalist legislation forced through during the war feeling\r\nagainst France in 1798, the controlling sympathy of the republicans for\r\nindividualism and of the federalists for a strong national government is\r\nconstantly visible, if looked for. The difficulty is that these\r\npermanent features are often so obscured by the temporary media in which\r\nthey appear that the republicans are likely to be taken as a merely\r\nState-rights party, and the federalists as a merely commercial party.\r\n\r\nTo adopt either of these notions would be to take a very erroneous idea\r\nof American political history. The whole policy of the republicans was\r\nto forward the freedom of the individual; their leader seems to have\r\nmade all other points subordinate to this. There is hardly any point in\r\nwhich the action of the individual American has been freed from\r\ngovernmental restraints, from ecclesiastical government, from sumptuary\r\nlaws, from restrictions on suffrage, from restrictions on commerce,\r\nproduction, and exchange, for which he is not indebted in some measure\r\nto the work and teaching of Jefferson between the years of 1790 and\r\n1800. He and his party found the States in existence, understood well\r\nthat they were convenient shields for the individual against the\r\npossible powers of the new federal government for evil, and made use of\r\nthem. The State sovereignty of Jefferson was the product of\r\nindividualism; that of Calhoun was the product of sectionalism.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if Jeffersonian democracy was the representative of\r\nall the individualistic tendencies of the later science of political\r\neconomy, Hamiltonian federalism represented the necessary corrective\r\nforce of law. It was in many respects a strong survival of colonialism.\r\nTogether with some of the evil features of colonialism, its imperative\r\ndemands for submission to class government, its respect for the\r\ninterests and desires of the few, and its contempt for those of the\r\nmany, it had brought into American constitutional life a very high ratio\r\nof that respect for law which alone can render the happiness and\r\nusefulness of the individual a permanent and secure possession. It was\r\nimpossible for federalism to resist the individualistic tendency of the\r\ncountry for any length of time; it is the monument of the party that it\r\nsecured, before it fell, abiding guaranties for the security of the\r\nindividual under freedom.\r\n\r\nThe genius of the federalists was largely practical. It was shown in\r\ntheir masterly organization of the federal government when it was first\r\nentrusted to their hands, an organization which has since been rather\r\ndeveloped than disturbed in any of its parts. But the details of the\r\nwork absorbed the attention of the leaders so completely that it would\r\nbe impossible to fix on any public address as entirely representative of\r\nthe party. Fisher Ames' speech on the Jay treaty, which was considered\r\nby the federalists the most effective piece of oratory in their party\r\nhistory, has been taken as a substitute. The question was to the\r\nfederalists partly of commercial and partly of national importance. John\r\nJay had secured the first commercial treaty with Great Britain in 1795.\r\nIt not only provided for the security of American commerce during the\r\nEuropean wars to which Great Britain was a party, and obtained the\r\nsurrender of the military posts in the present States of Ohio and\r\nMichigan; it also gave the United States a standing in the family of\r\nnations which it was difficult to claim elsewhere while Great Britain\r\ncontinued to refuse to treat on terms of equality. The Senate therefore\r\nratified the treaty, and it was constitutionally complete. The\r\ndemocratic majority in the House of Representatives, objecting to the\r\ntreaty as a surrender of previous engagements with France, and as a\r\nfailure to secure the rights of individuals against Great Britain,\r\nparticularly in the matter of impressment, raised the point that the\r\nHouse was not bound to vote money for carrying into effect a treaty with\r\nwhich it was seriously dissatisfied. The speech of Gallatin has been\r\nselected to represent the republican view. It is a strong reflection of\r\nthe opposition to the Treaty. The reply of Ames is a forcible\r\npresentation of both the national and the commercial aspects of his\r\nparty; it had a very great influence in securing, though by a very\r\nnarrow majority, the vote of the House in favor of the appropriation.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty in fixing on any completely representative\r\noration to represent the republican point of view covering this period.\r\nGallatin's speech on the Jay Treaty together with Nicholas' argument for\r\nthe repeal of the sedition law may serve this purpose. The speech of\r\nNicholas shows the instinctive sympathy of the party for the individual\r\nrather than for the government. It shows the force with which this\r\nsympathy drove the party into a strict construction of the Constitution.\r\nIt seems also to bear the strongest internal indications that it was\r\ninspired, if not entirely written, by the great leader of the party,\r\nJefferson. The federalists had used the popular war feeling against\r\nFrance in 1798, not only to press the formation of an army and a navy\r\nand the abrogation of the old and trouble-some treaties with France, but\r\nto pass the alien and sedition laws as well. The former empowered the\r\nPresident to expel from the country or imprison any alien whom he should\r\nconsider dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States. The\r\nlatter forbade, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, the printing or\r\npublishing of any \"false, scandalous, or malicious writings\" calculated\r\nto bring the Government, Congress, or the President into disrepute, or\r\nto excite against them the hatred of the good people of the United\r\nStates, or to stir up sedition. It was inevitable that the republicans\r\nshould oppose such laws, and that the people should support them in\r\ntheir opposition. At the election of 1800, the federal party was\r\noverthrown, and the lost ground was never regained. With Jefferson's\r\nelection to the presidency, began the democratic period of the United\r\nStates; but it has always been colored strongly and naturally by the\r\nfederal bias toward law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERT GALLATIN,\r\n\r\nOF PENNSYLVANIA. (BORN 1761, DIED 1849.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE BRITISH TREATY\r\n\r\n--HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, APRIL 26, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN:\r\n\r\nI will not follow some of the gentlemen who have preceded me, by\r\ndwelling upon the discretion of the legislature; a question which has\r\nalready been the subject of our deliberations, and been decided by a\r\nsolemn vote. Gentle-men who were in the minority on that question may\r\ngive any construction they please to the declaratory resolution of the\r\nHouse; they may again repeat that to refuse to carry the treaty into\r\neffect is a breach of the public faith which they conceive as being\r\npledged by the President and Senate. This has been the ground on which a\r\ndifference of opinion has existed since the beginning of the discussion.\r\nIt is because the House thinks that the faith of the nation cannot, on\r\nthose subjects submitted to the power of Congress, be pledged by any\r\nconstituted authority other than the legislature, that they resolved\r\nthat in all such cases it is their right and duty to consider the\r\nexpediency of carrying a treaty into effect. If the House think the\r\nfaith of the nation already pledged they can not claim any discretion;\r\nthere is no room left to deliberate upon the expediency of the thing.\r\nThe resolution now under consideration is merely \"that it is expedient\r\nto carry the British treaty into effect,\" and not whether we are bound\r\nby national faith to do it. I will therefore consider the question of\r\nexpediency alone; and thinking as I do that the House has full\r\ndiscretion on this subject, I conceive that there is as much\r\nresponsibility in deciding in the affirmative as in rejecting the\r\nresolution, and that we shall be equally answerable for the consequences\r\nthat may follow from either.\r\n\r\nIt is true, however, that there was a great difference between the\r\nsituation of this country in the year 1794, when a negotiator was\r\nappointed, and that in which we are at present; and that consequences\r\nwill follow the refusal to carry into effect the treaty in its present\r\nstage, which would not have attended a refusal to negotiate and to enter\r\ninto such a treaty. The question of expediency, therefore, assumes\r\nbefore us a different and more complex shape than when before the\r\nnegotiator, the Senate, or the President. The treaty, in itself and\r\nabstractedly considered, may be injurious; it may be such an instrument\r\nas in the opinion of the House ought not to have been adopted by the\r\nExecutive; and yet such as it is we may think it expedient under the\r\npresent circumstances to carry it into effect. I will therefore first\r\ntake a view of the provisions of the treaty itself, and in the next\r\nplace, supposing it is injurious, consider, in case it is not carried\r\ninto effect, what will be the natural consequences of such refusal.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the treaty relate either to the adjustment of past\r\ndifferences, or to the future intercourse of the two nations. The\r\ndifferences now existing between Great Britain and this country arose\r\neither from non-execution of some articles of the treaty of peace or\r\nfrom the effects of the present European war. The complaints of Great\r\nBritain in relation to the treaty of 1783 were confined to the legal\r\nimpediments thrown by the several States in the way of the recovery of\r\nBritish debts. The late treaty provides adequate remedy on that subject;\r\nthe United States are bound to make full and complete compensation for\r\nany losses arising from that source, and every ground of complaint on\r\nthe part of Great Britain is removed.\r\n\r\nHaving thus done full justice to the other nation, America has a right\r\nto expect that equal attention shall be paid to her claims arising from\r\ninfractions of the treaty of peace, viz., compensation for the negroes\r\ncarried away by the British; restoration of the western posts, and\r\nindemnification for their detention.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the first claim, which has been objected to as\r\ngroundless, I will observe that I am not satisfied that the construction\r\ngiven by the British government to that article of the treaty is\r\njustified even by the letter of the article. That construction rests on\r\nthe supposition that slaves come under the general denomination of\r\nbooty, and are alienated the moment they fall into possession of an\r\nenemy, so that all those who were in the hands of the British when the\r\ntreaty of peace was signed, must be considered as British and not as\r\nAmerican property, and are not included in the article. It will,\r\nhowever, appear by recurring to Vattel when speaking of the right of\r\n\"Postliminium,\" that slaves cannot be considered as a part of the booty\r\nwhich is alienated by the act of capture, and that they are to be ranked\r\nrather with real property, to the profits of which only the captors are\r\nentitled. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that the construction\r\ngiven by America is that which was understood by the parties at the time\r\nof making the treaty. The journals of Mr. Adams, quoted by a gentleman\r\nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Coit, prove this fully; for when he says that the\r\ninsertion of this article was alone worth the journey of Mr. Laurens\r\nfrom London, can it be supposed that he would have laid so much stress\r\non a clause, which, according to the new construction now attempted to\r\nbe given, means only that the British would commit no new act of\r\nhostility--would not carry away slaves at that time in possession of\r\nAmericans? Congress recognized that construction by adopting the\r\nresolution which has been already quoted, and which was introduced upon\r\nthe motion of Mr. Alexander Hamilton; and it has not been denied that\r\nthe British ministry during Mr. Adams' embassy also agreed to it.\r\n\r\nBut when our negotiator had, for the sake of peace, waived that claim;\r\nwhen he had also abandoned the right which America had to demand an\r\nindemnification for the detention of the posts, although he had conceded\r\nthe right of a similar nature, which Great Britain had for the detention\r\nof debts; when he had thus given up everything which might be supposed\r\nto be of a doubtful nature, it might have been hoped that our last\r\nclaim--a claim on which there was not and there never had been any\r\ndispute--the western posts should have been restored according to the\r\nterms of the treaty of peace. Upon what ground the British insisted, and\r\nour negotiator conceded, that this late restitution should be saddled\r\nwith new conditions, which made no part of the original contract, I am\r\nat a loss to know. British traders are allowed by the new treaty to\r\nremain within the posts without becoming citizens of the United States;\r\nand to carry on trade and commerce with the Indians living within our\r\nboundaries without being subject to any control from our government. In\r\nvain is it said that if that clause had not been inserted we would have\r\nfound it to our interest to effect it by our own laws. Of this we are\r\nalone competent judges; if that condition is harmless at present it is\r\nnot possible to foresee whether, under future circumstances, it will not\r\nprove highly injurious; and whether harmless or not, it is not less a\r\npermanent and new condition imposed upon us. But the fact is, that by\r\nthe introduction of that clause, by obliging us to keep within our\r\njurisdiction, as British subjects, the very men who have been the\r\ninstruments used by Great Britain to promote Indian wars on our\r\nfrontiers; by obliging us to suffer those men to continue their commerce\r\nwith the Indians living in our territory, uncontrolled by those\r\nregulations which we have thought necessary in order to restrain our own\r\ncitizens in their intercourse with these tribes, Great Britain has\r\npreserved her full influence with the Indian nations. By a restoration\r\nof the posts under that condition we have lost the greatest advantage\r\nthat was expected from their possession, viz.: future security against\r\nthe Indians. In the same manner have the British preserved the\r\ncommercial advantages which result from the occupancy of those posts, by\r\nstipulating as a permanent condition, a free passage for their goods\r\nacross our portages without paying any duty.\r\n\r\nAnother article of the new treaty which is connected with the provisions\r\nof the treaty of 1783 deserves consideration; I mean what relates to the\r\nMississippi. At the time when the navigation of that river to its mouth\r\nwas by the treaty of peace declared to be common to both nations, Great\r\nBritain communicated to America a right which she held by virtue of the\r\ntreaty of 1763, and as owner of the Floridas; but since that cession to\r\nthe United States, England has ceded to Spain her claim on the Floridas,\r\nand does not own at the present time an inch of ground, either on the\r\nmouth or on any part of that river. Spain now stands in the place of\r\nGreat Britain, and by virtue of the treaty of 1783 it is to Spain and\r\nAmerica, and not to England and America, that the navigation of the\r\nMississippi is at present to be common. Yet, notwithstanding this change\r\nof circumstances, we have repeated that article of the former treaty in\r\nthe late one, and have granted to Great Britain the additional privilege\r\nof using our ports on the eastern side of the river, without which, as\r\nthey own no land thereon, they could not have navigated it. Nor is this\r\nall. Upon a supposition that the Mississippi does not extend so far\r\nnorthward as to be intersected by a line drawn due west from the Lake of\r\nthe Woods, or, in other words, upon a supposition that Great Britain has\r\nnot a claim even to touch the Mississippi, we have agreed, not upon what\r\nwill be the boundary line, but that we will hereafter negotiate to\r\nsettle that line. Thus leaving to future negotiation what should have\r\nbeen finally settled by the treaty itself, in the same manner as all\r\nother differences were, is calculated for the sole purpose, either of\r\nlaying the foundation of future disputes, or of recognizing a claim in\r\nGreat Britain on the waters of the Mississippi, even if their boundary\r\nline leaves to the southward the sources of that river. Had not that\r\nbeen the intention of Great Britain the line would have been settled at\r\nonce by the treaty, according to either of the two only rational ways of\r\ndoing it in conformity to the treaty of 1783, that is to say, by\r\nagreeing that the line should run from the northernmost sources of the\r\nMississippi, either directly to the western extremity of the Lake of the\r\nWoods, or northwardly till it intersected the line to be drawn due west\r\nfrom that lake. But by repeating the article of the treaty of 1783; by\r\nconceding the free use of our ports on the river, and by the insertion\r\nof the fourth article, we have admitted that Great Britain, in all\r\npossible events, has still a right to navigate that river from its\r\nsource to its mouth. What may be the future effects of these provisions,\r\nespecially as they regard our intercourse with Spain, it is impossible\r\nat present to say; but although they can bring us no advantage, they may\r\nembroil us with that nation: and we have already felt the effect of it\r\nin our late treaty with Spain, since we were obliged, on account of that\r\nclause of the British treaty, to accept as a gift and a favor the\r\nnavigation of that river which we had till then claimed as a right.\r\n\r\nBut if, leaving commercial regulations, we shall seek in the treaty for\r\nsome provisions securing to us the free navigation of the ocean against\r\nany future aggressions on our trade, where are they to be found? I can\r\nadd nothing to what has been said on the subject of contraband articles:\r\nit is, indeed, self-evident, that, connecting our treaty with England on\r\nthat subject with those we have made with other nations, it amounts to a\r\npositive compact to supply that nation exclusively with naval stores\r\nwhenever they may be at war. Had the list of contraband articles been\r\nreduced--had naval stores and provisions, our two great staple\r\ncommodities, been declared not to be contra-band, security would have\r\nbeen given to the free exportation of our produce; but instead of any\r\nprovision being made on that head, an article of a most doubtful nature,\r\nand on which I will remark hereafter, has been introduced. But I mean,\r\nfor the present, to confine my observations to the important question of\r\nfree bottoms making free goods. It was with the utmost astonishment that\r\nI heard the doctrine advanced on this floor, that such a provision, if\r\nadmitted, would prove injurious to America, inasmuch as in case of war\r\nbetween this country and any other nation, the goods of that nation\r\nmight be protected by the English flag. It is not to a state of war that\r\nthe benefits of this provision would extend; but it is the only security\r\nwhich neutral nations can have against the legal plundering on the high\r\nseas, so often committed by belligerent powers. It is not for the sake\r\nof protecting an enemy's property; it is not for the sake of securing an\r\nadvantageous carrying trade; but it is in order effectually to secure\r\nourselves against sea aggressions, that this provision is necessary.\r\nSpoliations may arise from unjust orders, given by the government of a\r\nbelligerent nation to their officers and cruisers, and these may be\r\nredressed by application to and negotiation with that order. But no\r\ncomplaints, no negotiations, no orders of government itself, can give\r\nredress when those spoliations are grounded on a supposition, that the\r\nvessels of the neutral nation have an enemy's property on board, as long\r\nas such property is not protected by the flag of the neutral nation; as\r\nlong as it is liable to be captured, it is not sufficient, in order to\r\navoid detention and capture, to have no such property on board. Every\r\nprivateer, under pretence that he suspects an enemy's goods to be part\r\nof a cargo, may search, vex, and capture a vessel; and if in any corner\r\nof the dominions of the belligerent power, a single judge can be found\r\ninclined, if not determined, to condemn, at all events, before his\r\ntribunal, all vessels so captured will be brought there, and the same\r\npretence which caused the capture will justify a condemnation. The only\r\nnation who persists in the support of this doctrine, as making part of\r\nthe law of nations, is the first maritime power of Europe, whom their\r\ninterest, as they are the strongest, and as there is hardly a maritime\r\nwar in which they are not involved, leads to wish for a continuation of\r\na custom which gives additional strength to their overbearing dominion\r\nover the seas. All the other nations have different sentiments and a\r\ndifferent interest. During the American war, in the year 1780, so fully\r\nconvinced were the neutral nations of the necessity of introducing that\r\ndoctrine of free bottoms making free goods, that all of them, excepting\r\nPortugal, who was in a state of vassalage to, and a mere appendage of,\r\nGreat Britain, united in order to establish the principle, and formed\r\nfor that purpose the alliance known by the name of the armed neutrality.\r\nAll the belligerent powers, except England, recognized and agreed to the\r\ndoctrine. England itself was obliged, in some measure, to give, for a\r\nwhile, a tacit acquiescence. America, at the time, fully admitted the\r\nprinciple, although then at war.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1780, every nation, so far as my knowledge goes, has\r\nrefused to enter into a treaty of commerce with England, unless that\r\nprovision was inserted. Russia, for that reason, would not renew their\r\ntreaty, which had expired in 1786; although I believe that, during the\r\npresent war, and in order to answer the ends of the war, they formed a\r\ntemporary convention, which I have not seen, but which, perhaps, does\r\nnot include that provision. England consented to it in her treaty with\r\nFrance, in 1788, and we are the first neutral nation who has abandoned\r\nthe common cause, given up the claim, and by a positive declaration\r\ninserted in our treaty, recognized the contrary doctrine. It has been\r\nsaid that, under the present circumstances, it could not be expected\r\nthat Great Britain would give up the point; perhaps so; but the\r\nobjection is not, that our negotiator has not been able to obtain that\r\nprinciple, but that he has consented to enter into a treaty of commerce\r\nwhich we do not want, and which has no connection with an adjustment of\r\nour differences with Great Britain, without the principle contended for\r\nmaking part of that treaty. Unless we can obtain security for our\r\nnavigation, we want no treaty; and the only provision which can give us\r\nthat security, should have been the _sine qua non_ of a treaty. On the\r\ncontrary, we have disgusted all the other neutral nations of Europe,\r\nwithout whose concert and assistance there is but little hope that we\r\nshall ever obtain that point; and we have taught Great Britain that we\r\nare disposed to form the most intimate connections with her, even at the\r\nexpense of recognizing a principle the most fatal to the liberty of\r\ncommerce and to the security of our navigation.\r\n\r\nBut, if we could not obtain anything which might secure us against\r\nfuture aggressions, should we have parted, without receiving any\r\nequivalent, with those weapons of self-defence, which, although they\r\ncould not repel, might, in some degree, prevent any gross attacks upon\r\nour trade--any gross violation of our rights as a neutral nation? We\r\nhave no fleet to oppose or to punish the insults of Great Britain; but,\r\nfrom our commercial relative situation, we have it in our power to\r\nrestrain her aggressions, by restrictions on her trade, by a total\r\nprohibition of her manufactures, or by a sequestration of the debts due\r\nto her. By the treaty, not satisfied with receiving nothing, not\r\nsatisfied with obtaining no security for the future, we have, of our own\r\naccord, surrendered those defensive arms, for fear they might be abused\r\nby ourselves. We have given up the two first, for the whole time during\r\nwhich we might want them most, the period of the present war; and the\r\nlast, the power of sequestration, we have abandoned for ever: every\r\nother article of the treaty of commerce is temporary; this perpetual.\r\n\r\nI shall not enter into a discussion of the immorality of sequestering\r\nprivate property. What can be more immoral than war; or plundering on\r\nthe high seas, legalized under the name of privateering? Yet\r\nself-defence justifies the first, and the necessity of the case may, at\r\nleast in some instances, and where it is the only practicable mode of\r\nwarfare left to a nation, apologize even for the last. In the same\r\nmanner, the power of sequestration may be resorted to, as the last\r\nweapon of self-defence, rather than to seek redress by an appeal to\r\narms. It is the last peace measure that can be taken by a nation; but\r\nthe treaty, by declaring, that in case of national differences it shall\r\nnot be resorted to, has deprived us of the power of judging of its\r\npropriety, has rendered it an act of hostility, and has effectually\r\ntaken off that restraint, which a fear of its exercise laid upon Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that by the treaty we have promised full compensation to\r\nEngland for every possible claim they may have against us, that we have\r\nabandoned every claim of a doubtful nature, and that we have consented\r\nto receive the posts, our claim to which was not disputed, under new\r\nconditions and restrictions never before contemplated; that after having\r\nobtained by those concessions an adjustment of past differences, we have\r\nentered into a new agreement, unconnected with those objects, which have\r\nheretofore been subjects of discussion between the two nations; and that\r\nby this treaty of commerce and navigation, we have obtained no\r\ncommercial advantage which we did not enjoy before, we have obtained no\r\nsecurity against future aggressions, no security in favor of the freedom\r\nof our navigation, and we have parted with every pledge we had in our\r\nhands, with every power of restriction, with every weapon of\r\nself-defence which is calculated to give us any security.\r\n\r\nFrom the review I have taken of the treaty, and the opinions I have\r\nexpressed, it is hardly necessary for me to add, that I look upon the\r\ninstrument as highly injurious to the interests of the United States,\r\nand that I earnestly wish it never had been made; but whether in its\r\npresent stage the House ought to refuse to carry it into effect, and\r\nwhat will be the probable consequences of a refusal, is a question which\r\nrequires the most serious attention, and which I will now attempt to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nShould the treaty be finally defeated, either new negotiations will be\r\nmore successful or Great Britain will refuse to make a new arrangement,\r\nand leave things in the situation in which they now are, or war will be\r\nthe consequence. I will, in the course of my observations, make some\r\nremarks on the last supposition. I do not think that the first will be\r\nvery probable at present, and I am of opinion that, under the present\r\ncircumstances, and until some change takes place in our own or in the\r\nrelative political situation of the European nations, it is to be\r\napprehended that, in such a case, new negotiations will either be\r\nrejected or prove unsuccessful. Such an event might have perhaps\r\nfollowed a rejection of the treaty even by the Senate or by the\r\nPresident. After the negotiator employed by the United States had once\r\naffixed his signature it must have become very problematical, unless he\r\nhad exceeded his powers, whether a refusal to sanction the contract he\r\nhad made would not eventually defeat, at least for a time, the prospect\r\nof a new treaty. I conceive that the hopes of obtaining better\r\nconditions by a new negotiation are much less in the present stage of\r\nthe business than they were when the treaty was in its inchoate form\r\nbefore the Executive; and in order to form a just idea of the\r\nconsequences of a rejection at present, I will contemplate them upon\r\nthis supposition, which appears to me most probable, to wit, that no new\r\ntreaty will take place for a certain period of time.\r\n\r\nIn mentioning my objections to the treaty itself, I have already stated\r\nthe advantages which in my opinion would result to the United States\r\nfrom the non-existence of that instrument; I will not repeat, but\r\nproceed at once to examine what losses may accrue that can be set off\r\nagainst those advantages.\r\n\r\nThe further detention of the posts, the national stain that will result\r\nfrom receiving no reparation for the spoliations on our trade, and the\r\nuncertainty of a final adjustment of our differences with Great Britain,\r\nare the three evils which strike me as resulting from a rejection of the\r\ntreaty; and when to those considerations I add that of the present\r\nsituation of this country, of the agitation of the public mind, and of\r\nthe advantages that will arise from union of sentiments, however\r\ninjurious and unequal I conceive the treaty to be, however repugnant it\r\nmay be to my feelings, and perhaps to my prejudices, I feel induced to\r\nvote for it, and will not give my assent to any proposition which will\r\nimply its rejection. But the conduct of Great Britain since the treaty\r\nwas signed, the impressment of our seamen, and their uninterrupted\r\nspoliations on our trade, especially by seizing our vessels laden with\r\nprovisions, a proceeding which they may perhaps justify by one of the\r\narticles of the treaty, are such circumstances as may induce us to pause\r\nawhile, in order to examine whether it is proper, immediately and\r\nwithout having obtained any explanation thereon, to adopt the resolution\r\non the table, and to pass, at present, all the laws necessary to carry\r\nthe treaty into effect.\r\n\r\nWhatever evils may follow a rejection of the treaty, they will not\r\nattend a postponement. To suspend our proceedings will not throw us into\r\na situation which will require new negotiations, new arrangements on the\r\npoints already settled and well understood by both parties. It will be\r\nmerely a delay, until an explanation of the late conduct of the British\r\ntowards us may be obtained, or until that conduct may be altered. If, on\r\nthe contrary, we consent to carry the treaty into effect, under the\r\npresent circumstances, what will be our situation in future? It is by\r\ncommitting the most wanton and the most unprovoked aggressions on our\r\ntrade; it is by seizing a large amount of our property as a pledge for\r\nour good behavior, that Great Britain has forced the nation into the\r\npresent treaty. If by threatening new hostilities, or rather by\r\ncontinuing her aggressions, even after the treaty is made, she can force\r\nus also to carry it into effect, our acquiescence will be tantamount to\r\na declaration that we mean to submit in proportion to the insults that\r\nare offered to us; and this disposition being once known, what security\r\nhave we against new insults, new aggressions, new spoliations, which\r\nprobably will lay the foundation of some additional sacrifices on ours?\r\nIt has been said, and said with truth, that to put up with the\r\nindignities we have received without obtaining any reparation, which\r\nwill probably be the effect of defeating the treaty, is highly\r\ndishonorable to the nation.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it is still more so not only tamely to submit to a\r\ncontinuation of these national insults, but while they thus continue\r\nuninterrupted, to carry into effect the instrument we have consented to\r\naccept as a reparation for former ones. When the general conduct of\r\nGreat Britain towards us from the beginning of the present war is\r\nconsidered; when the means by which she has produced the treaty are\r\nreflected on, a final compliance on our part while she still persists in\r\nthat conduct, whilst the chastening rod of that nation is still held\r\nover us, is in my opinion a dereliction of national interest, of\r\nnational honor, of national independence.\r\n\r\nBut it is said, that war must be the consequence of our delaying to\r\ncarry the treaty into effect. Do the gentlemen mean, that if we reject\r\nthe treaty, if we do not accept the reparation there given to us, in\r\norder to obtain redress, we have no alternative left but war? If we must\r\ngo to war in order to obtain reparation for insults and spoliations on\r\nour trade, we must do it, even if we carry the present treaty into\r\neffect; for this treaty gives us no reparation for the aggressions\r\ncommitted since it was ratified, has not produced a discontinuance of\r\nthose acts of hostility, and gives us no security that they shall be\r\ndiscontinued. But the arguments of those gentlemen, who suppose that\r\nAmerica must go to war, apply to a final rejection of the treaty, and\r\nnot to a delay. I do not propose to refuse the reparation offered by the\r\ntreaty, and to put up with the aggressions committed; I have agreed that\r\nthat reparation, such as it is, is a valuable article of the treaty; I\r\nhave agreed, that under the present circumstances, a greater evil will\r\nfollow a total rejection of, than an acquiescence in, the treaty. The\r\nonly measure which has been mentioned, in preference to the one now\r\nunder discussion, is a suspension, a postponement, whilst the present\r\nspoliations continue, in hopes to obtain for them a similar reparation,\r\nand assurances that they shall cease.\r\n\r\nBut is it meant to insinuate that it is the final intention of those who\r\npretend to wish only for a postponement, to involve this country in a\r\nwar? There has been no period during the present European war, at which\r\nit would not have been equally weak and wicked to adopt such measures as\r\nmust involve America in the contest, unless forced into it for the sake\r\nof self-defence; but, at this time, to think of it would fall but little\r\nshort of madness. The whole American nation would rise in opposition to\r\nthe idea; and it might at least have been recollected, that war can not\r\nbe declared, except by Congress, and that two of the branches of\r\ngovernment are sufficient to check the other in any supposed attempt of\r\nthis kind.\r\n\r\nIf there is no necessity imposed upon America to go to war, if there is\r\nno apprehension she will, by her own conduct, involve herself in one,\r\nthe danger must arise from Great Britain, and the threat is, that she\r\nwill make war against us if we do not comply. Gentlemen first tell us\r\nthat we have made the best possible bargain with that nation; that she\r\nhas conceded everything, without receiving a single iota in return, and\r\nyet they would persuade us, that she will make war against us in order\r\nto force us to accept that contract so advantageous to us, and so\r\ninjurious to herself. It will not be contended that a delay, until an\r\namicable explanation is obtained, could afford even a pretence to Great\r\nBritain for going to war; and we all know that her own interest would\r\nprevent her. If another campaign takes place, it is acknowledged, that\r\nall her efforts are to be exerted against the West Indies. She has\r\nproclaimed her own scarcity of provisions at home, and she must depend\r\non our supplies to support her armament. It depends upon us to defeat\r\nher whole scheme, and this is a sufficient pledge against open\r\nhostility, if the European war continues. If peace takes place, there\r\nwill not be even the appearance of danger; the moment when a nation is\r\nhappy enough to emerge from one of the most expensive, bloody, and\r\ndangerous wars in which she ever has been involved, will be the last she\r\nwould choose to plunge afresh into a similar calamity.\r\n\r\nBut to the cry of war, the alarmists do not fail to add that of\r\nconfusion; and they have declared, even on this floor, that if the\r\nresolution is not adopted government will be dissolved. Government\r\ndissolved in case a postponement takes place! The idea is too absurd to\r\ndeserve a direct answer. But I will ask those gentlemen, by whom is\r\ngovernment to be dissolved? Certainly not by those who may vote against\r\nthe resolution; for although they are not perhaps fortunate enough to\r\nhave obtained the confidence of the gentlemen who voted against them,\r\nstill it must be agreed, that those who succeed in their wishes, who\r\ndefeat a measure they dislike, will not wish to destroy that government,\r\nwhich they hold so far in their hands as to be able to carry their own\r\nmeasures. For them to dissolve government, would be to dissolve their\r\nown power. By whom, then, I again ask, is the government to be\r\ndissolved? The gentlemen must answer--by themselves--or they must\r\ndeclare that they mean nothing but to alarm. Is it really the language\r\nof those men, who profess to be, who distinguish themselves by the\r\nself-assumed appellation of friends to order, that if they do not\r\nsucceed in all their measures they will overset government--and have all\r\ntheir professions been only a veil to hide their love of power, a\r\npretence to cover their ambition? Do they mean, that the first event\r\nwhich shall put an end to their own authority shall be the last act of\r\ngovernment? As to myself, I do not believe that they have such\r\nintentions; I have too good an opinion of their patriotism to allow\r\nmyself to admit such an idea a single moment; but I think myself\r\njustifiable in entertaining a belief, that some amongst them, in order\r\nto carry a favorite, and what they think to be an advantageous measure,\r\nmean to spread an alarm which they do not feel; and I have no doubt,\r\nthat many have contracted such a habit of carrying every measure of\r\ngovernment as they please, that they really think that every thing must\r\nbe thrown into confusion the moment they are thwarted in a matter of\r\nimportance. I hope that experience will in future cure their fears. But,\r\nat all events, be the wishes and intentions of the members of this House\r\nwhat they may, it is not in their power to dissolve the government. The\r\npeople of the United States, from one end of the continent to the other,\r\nare strongly attached to their Constitution; they would restrain and\r\npunish the excesses of any party, of any set of men in government, who\r\nwould be guilty of the attempt; and on them I will rest as a full\r\nsecurity against every endeavor to destroy our Union, our Constitution,\r\nor our government.\r\n\r\nIf the people of the United States wish this House to carry the treaty\r\ninto effect immediately, and notwithstanding the continued aggressions\r\nof the British, if their will was fairly and fully expressed, I would\r\nimmediately acquiesce; but since an appeal has been made to them, it is\r\nreasonable to suspend a decision until their sentiments are known. Till\r\nthen I must follow my own judgment; and as I cannot see that any\r\npossible evils will follow a delay, I shall vote against the resolution\r\nbefore the committee, in order to make room, either for that proposed by\r\nmy colleague, Mr. Maclay, or for any other, expressed in any manner\r\nwhatever, provided it embraces the object I have in view, to wit, the\r\nsuspension of the final vote--a postponement of the laws necessary to\r\ncarry the treaty into effect, until satisfactory assurances are obtained\r\nthat Great Britain means, in future, to show us that friendly\r\ndisposition which it is my earnest wish may at all times be cultivated\r\nby America towards all other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHER AMES,\r\n\r\nOF MASSACHUSETTS. (BORN 1758, DIED 1808.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE BRITISH TREATY, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, APRIL 28, 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be strange, that a subject, which has aroused in turn all the\r\npassions of the country, should be discussed without the interference of\r\nany of our own. We are men, and therefore not exempt from those\r\npassions; as citizens and representatives, we feel the interests that\r\nmust excite them. The hazard of great interests cannot fail to agitate\r\nstrong passions. We are not disinterested; it is impossible we should be\r\ndispassionate. The warmth of such feelings may becloud the judgment,\r\nand, for a time, pervert the understanding. But the public sensibility,\r\nand our own, has sharpened the spirit of inquiry, and given an animation\r\nto the debate. The public attention has been quickened to mark the\r\nprogress of the discussion, and its judgment, often hasty and erroneous\r\non first impressions, has become solid and enlightened at last. Our\r\nresult will, I hope, on that account, be safer and more mature, as well\r\nas more accordant with that of the nation. The only constant agents in\r\npolitical affairs are the passions of men. Shall we complain of our\r\nnature--shall we say that man ought to have been made otherwise? It is\r\nright already, because He, from whom we derive our nature, ordained it\r\nso; and because thus made and thus acting, the cause of truth and the\r\npublic good is more surely promoted.\r\n\r\nThe treaty is bad, fatally bad, is the cry. It sacrifices the interest,\r\nthe honor, the independence of the United States, and the faith of our\r\nengagements to France. If we listen to the clamor of party intemperance,\r\nthe evils are of a number not to be counted, and of a nature not to be\r\nborne, even in idea. The language of passion and exaggeration may\r\nsilence that of sober reason in other places, it has not done it here.\r\nThe question here is, whether the treaty be really so very fatal as to\r\noblige the nation to break its faith. I admit that such a treaty ought\r\nnot to be executed. I admit that self-preservation is the first law of\r\nsociety, as well as of individuals. It would, perhaps, be deemed an\r\nabuse of terms to call that a treaty, which violates such a principle. I\r\nwaive also, for the present, any inquiry, what departments shall\r\nrepresent the nation, and annul the stipulations of a treaty. I content\r\nmyself with pursuing the inquiry, whether the nature of this compact be\r\nsuch as to justify our refusal to carry it into effect. A treaty is the\r\npromise of a nation. Now, promises do not always bind him that makes\r\nthem. But I lay down two rules, which ought to guide us in this case.\r\nThe treaty must appear to be bad, not merely in the petty details, but\r\nin its character, principle, and mass. And in the next place, this ought\r\nto be ascertained by the decided and general concurrence of the\r\nenlightened public.\r\n\r\nI confess there seems to be something very like ridicule thrown over the\r\ndebate by the discussion of the articles in detail. The undecided point\r\nis, shall we break our faith? And while our country and enlightened\r\nEurope, await the issue with more than curiosity, we are employed to\r\ngather piecemeal, and article by article, from the instrument, a\r\njustification for the deed by trivial calculations of commercial profit\r\nand loss. This is little worthy of the subject, of this body, or of the\r\nnation. If the treaty is bad, it will appear to be so in its mass. Evil\r\nto a fatal extreme, if that be its tendency, requires no proof; it\r\nbrings it. Extremes speak for themselves and make their own law. What if\r\nthe direct voyage of American ships to Jamaica with horses or lumber,\r\nmight net one or two per centum more than the present trade to Surinam;\r\nwould the proof of the fact avail any thing in so grave a question as\r\nthe violation of the public engagements?\r\n\r\nWhy do they complain, that the West Indies are not laid open? Why do\r\nthey lament, that any restriction is stipulated on the commerce of the\r\nEast Indies? Why do they pretend, that if they reject this, and insist\r\nupon more, more will be accomplished? Let us be explicit--more would not\r\nsatisfy. If all was granted, would not a treaty of amity with Great\r\nBritain still be obnoxious? Have we not this instant heard it urged\r\nagainst our envoy, that he was not ardent enough in his hatred of Great\r\nBritain? A treaty of amity is condemned because it was not made by a\r\nfoe, and in the spirit of one. The same gentleman, at the same instant,\r\nrepeats a very prevailing objection, that no treaty should be made with\r\nthe enemy of France. No treaty, exclaim others, should be made with a\r\nmonarch or a despot; there will be no naval security while those\r\nsea-robbers domineer on the ocean; their den must be destroyed; that\r\nnation must be extirpated.\r\n\r\nI like this, sir, because it is sincerity. With feelings such as these,\r\nwe do not pant for treaties. Such passions seek nothing, and will be\r\ncontent with nothing, but the destruction of their object. If a treaty\r\nleft King George his island, it would not answer; not if he stipulated\r\nto pay rent for it. It has been said, the world ought to rejoice if\r\nBritain was sunk in the sea; if where there are now men and wealth and\r\nlaws and liberty, there was no more than a sand bank for sea monsters to\r\nfatten on; a space for the storms of the ocean to mingle in conflict.\r\n\r\nWhat is patriotism? Is it a narrow affection for the spot where a man\r\nwas born? Are the very clods where we tread entitled to this ardent\r\npreference because they are greener? No, sir, this is not the character\r\nof the virtue, and it soars higher for its object. It is an extended\r\nself-love, mingling with all the enjoyments of life, and twisting itself\r\nwith the minutest filaments of the heart. It is thus we obey the laws of\r\nsociety, because they are the laws of virtue. In their authority we see,\r\nnot the array of force and terror, but the venerable image of our\r\ncountry's honor. Every good citizen makes that honor his own, and\r\ncherishes it not only as precious, but as sacred. He is willing to risk\r\nhis life in its defence, and is conscious that he gains protection while\r\nhe gives it. For, what rights of a citizen will be deemed inviolable\r\nwhen a state renounces the principles that constitute their security? Or\r\nif his life should not be invaded, what would its enjoyments be in a\r\ncountry odious in the eyes of strangers and dishonored in his own? Could\r\nhe look with affection and veneration to such a country as his parent?\r\nThe sense of having one would die within him; he would blush for his\r\npatriotism, if he retained any, and justly, for it would be a vice. He\r\nwould be a banished man in his native land. I see no exception to the\r\nrespect that is paid among nations to the law of good faith. If there\r\nare cases in this enlightened period when it is violated, there are none\r\nwhen it is decried. It is the philosophy of politics, the religion of\r\ngovernments. It is observed by barbarians--a whiff of tobacco smoke, or\r\na string of beads, gives not merely binding force but sanctity to\r\ntreaties. Even in Algiers, a truce may be bought for money, but when\r\nratified, even Algiers is too wise, or too just, to disown and annul its\r\nobligation. Thus we see, neither the ignorance of savages, nor the\r\nprinciples of an association for piracy and rapine, permit a nation to\r\ndespise its engagements. If, sir, there could be a resurrection from the\r\nfoot of the gallows, if the victims of justice could live again, collect\r\ntogether and form a society, they would, however loath, soon find\r\nthemselves obliged to make justice, that justice under which they fell,\r\nthe fundamental law of their state. They would perceive, it was their\r\ninterest to make others respect, and they would therefore soon pay some\r\nrespect themselves, to the obligations of good faith.\r\n\r\nIt is painful, I hope it is superfluous, to make even the supposition,\r\nthat America should furnish the occasion of this opprobrium. No, let me\r\nnot even imagine, that a republican government, sprung, as our own is,\r\nfrom a people enlightened and uncorrupted, a government whose origin is\r\nright, and whose daily discipline is duty, can, upon solemn debate, make\r\nits option to be faithless--can dare to act what despots dare not avow,\r\nwhat our own example evinces, the states of Barbary are unsuspected of.\r\nNo, let me rather make the supposition, that Great Britain refuses to\r\nexecute the treaty, after we have done every thing to carry it into\r\neffect. Is there any language of reproach pungent enough to express your\r\ncommentary on the fact? What would you say, or rather what would you not\r\nsay? Would you not tell them, wherever an Englishman might travel, shame\r\nwould stick to him--he would disown his country. You would exclaim,\r\nEngland, proud of your wealth, and arrogant in the possession of\r\npower--blush for these distinctions, which become the vehicles of your\r\ndishonor. Such a nation might truly say to corruption, thou art my\r\nfather, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my sister. We should say\r\nof such a race of men, their name is a heavier burden than their debt.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the posts (inevitable if we reject the treaty) is a\r\nmeasure too decisive in its nature to be neutral in its consequences.\r\nFrom great causes we are to look for great effects. A plain and obvious\r\none will be, the price of the Western lands will fall. Settlers will not\r\nchoose to fix their habitation on a field of battle. Those who talk so\r\nmuch of the interest of the United States, should calculate how deeply\r\nit will be affected by rejecting the treaty; how vast a tract of wild\r\nland will almost cease to be property. This loss, let it be observed,\r\nwill fall upon a fund expressly devoted to sink the national debt. What\r\nthen are we called upon to do? However the form of the vote and the\r\nprotestations of many may disguise the proceeding, our resolution is in\r\nsubstance, and it deserves to wear the title of a resolution to prevent\r\nthe sale of the Western lands and the discharge of the public debt.\r\n\r\nWill the tendency to Indian hostilities be contested by any one?\r\nExperience gives the answer. The frontiers were scourged with war till\r\nthe negotiation with Great Britain was far advanced, and then the state\r\nof hostility ceased. Perhaps the public agents of both nations are\r\ninnocent of fomenting the Indian war, and perhaps they are not. We ought\r\nnot, however, to expect that neighboring nations, highly irritated\r\nagainst each other, will neglect the friendship of the savages; the\r\ntraders will gain an influence and will abuse it; and who is ignorant\r\nthat their passions are easily raised, and hardly restrained from\r\nviolence? Their situation will oblige them to choose between this\r\ncountry and Great Britain, in case the treaty should be rejected. They\r\nwill not be our friends, and at the same time the friends of our\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nBut am I reduced to the necesity of proving this point? Certainly the\r\nvery men who charged the Indian war on the detention of the posts, will\r\ncall for no other proof than the recital of their own speeches. It is\r\nremembered with what emphasis, with what acrimony, they expatiated on\r\nthe burden of taxes, and the drain of blood and treasure into the\r\nWestern country, in consequence of Britain's holding the posts. Until\r\nthe posts are restored, they exclaimed, the treasury and the frontiers\r\nmust bleed.\r\n\r\nIf any, against all these proofs, should maintain that the peace with\r\nthe Indians will be stable without the posts, to them I urge another\r\nreply. From arguments calculated to produce conviction, I will appeal\r\ndirectly to the hearts of those who hear me, and ask, whether it is not\r\nalready planted there? I resort especially to the convictions of the\r\nWestern gentlemen, whether supposing no posts and no treaty, the\r\nsettlers will remain in security? Can they take it upon them to say,\r\nthat an Indian peace, under these circumstances, will prove firm? No,\r\nsir, it will not be peace, but a sword; it will be no better than a lure\r\nto draw victims within the reach of the tomahawk.\r\n\r\nOn this theme my emotions are unutterable. If I could find words for\r\nthem, if my powers bore any proportion to my zeal, I would swell my\r\nvoice to such a note of remonstrance, it should reach every log-house\r\nbeyond the mountains. I would say to the inhabitants, wake from your\r\nfalse security; your cruel dangers, your more cruel apprehensions are\r\nsoon to be renewed; the wounds, yet unhealed, are to be torn open again;\r\nin the daytime, your path through the woods will be ambushed; the\r\ndarkness of midnight will glitter with the blaze of your dwellings. You\r\nare a father--the blood of your sons shall fatten your cornfield; you\r\nare a mother--the war-whoop shall wake the sleep of the cradle.\r\n\r\nOn this subject you need not suspect any deception on your feelings. It\r\nis a spectacle of horror, which cannot be overdrawn. If you have nature\r\nin your hearts, it will speak a language, compared with which all I have\r\nsaid or can say will be poor and frigid.\r\n\r\nWill it be whispered that the treaty has made me a new champion for the\r\nprotection of the frontiers? It is known that my voice as well as vote\r\nhave been uniformly given in conformity with the ideas I have expressed.\r\nProtection is the right of the frontiers; it is our duty to give it.\r\n\r\nWho will accuse me of wandering out of the subject? Who will say that I\r\nexaggerate the tendencies of our measures? Will any one answer by a\r\nsneer, that all this is idle preaching? Will any one deny, that we are\r\nbound, and I would hope to good purpose, by the most solemn sanctions of\r\nduty for the vote we give? Are despots alone to be reproached for\r\nunfeeling indifference to the tears and blood of their subjects? Have\r\nthe principles on which you ground the reproach upon cabinets and kings\r\nno practical influence, no binding force? Are they merely themes of idle\r\ndeclamation introduced to decorate the morality of a newspaper essay, or\r\nto furnish petty topics of harangue from the windows of that\r\nstate-house? I trust it is neither too presumptuous nor too late to ask.\r\nCan you put the dearest interest of society at risk without guilt and\r\nwithout remorse.\r\n\r\nIt is vain to offer as an excuse, that public men are not to be\r\nreproached for the evils that may happen to ensue from their measures.\r\nThis is very true where they are unforeseen or inevitable. Those I have\r\ndepicted are not unforeseen; they are so far from inevitable, we are\r\ngoing to bring them into being by our vote. We choose the consequences,\r\nand become as justly answerable for them as for the measures that we\r\nknow will produce them.\r\n\r\nBy rejecting the posts we light the savage fires--we bind the victims.\r\nThis day we undertake to render account to the widows and orphans whom\r\nour decision will make, to the wretches that will be roasted at the\r\nstake, to our country, and I do not deem it too serious to say, to\r\nconscience and to God. We are answerable, and if duty be any thing more\r\nthan a word of imposture, if conscience be not a bug-bear, we are\r\npreparing to make ourselves as wretched as our country.\r\n\r\nThere is no mistake in this case--there can be none. Experience has\r\nalready been the prophet of events, and the cries of future victims have\r\nalready reached us. The Western inhabitants are not a silent and\r\nuncomplaining sacrifice. The voice of humanity issues from the shade of\r\ntheir wilderness. It exclaims that, while one hand is held up to reject\r\nthis treaty, the other grasps a tomahawk. It summons our imagination to\r\nthe scenes that will open. It is no great effort of the imagination to\r\nconceive that events so near are already begun. I can fancy that I\r\nlisten to the yells of savage vengeance, and the shrieks of torture.\r\nAlready they seem to sigh in the west wind-already they mingle with\r\nevery echo from the mountains.\r\n\r\nIt is not the part of prudence to be inattentive to the tendencies of\r\nmeasures. Where there is any ground to fear that these will prove\r\npernicious, wisdom and duty forbid that we should underrate them. If we\r\nreject the treaty, will our peace be as safe as if we executed it with\r\ngood faith? I do honor to the intrepid spirits of those who say it will.\r\nIt was formerly understood to constitute the excellence of a man's faith\r\nto believe without evidence and against it.\r\n\r\nBut, as opinions on this article are changed, and we are called to act\r\nfor our country, it becomes us to explore the dangers that will attend\r\nits peace, and to avoid them if we can.\r\n\r\nIs there any thing in the prospect of the interior state of the country\r\nto encourage us to aggravate the dangers of a war? Would not the shock\r\nof that evil produce another, and shake down the feeble and then\r\nunbraced structure of our government? Is this a chimera? Is it going off\r\nthe ground of matter of fact to say, the rejection of the appropriation\r\nproceeds upon the doctrine of a civil war of the departments? Two\r\nbranches have ratified a treaty, and we are going to set it aside. How\r\nis this disorder in the machine to be rectified? While it exists its\r\nmovements must stop, and when we talk of a remedy, is that any other\r\nthan the formidable one of a revolutionary one of the people? And is\r\nthis, in the judgment even of my opposers, to execute, to preserve the\r\nconstitution and the public order? Is this the state of hazard, if not\r\nof convulsion, which they can have the courage to contemplate and to\r\nbrave, or beyond which their penetration can reach and see the issue?\r\nThey seem to believe, and they act as if they believed, that our union,\r\nour peace, our liberty, are invulnerable and immortal--as if our happy\r\nstate was not to be disturbed by our dissentions, and that we are not\r\ncapable of falling from it by our unworthiness. Some of them have, no\r\ndoubt, better nerves and better discernment than mine. They can see the\r\nbright aspects and the happy consequences of all this array of horrors.\r\nThey can see intestine discords, our government disorganized, our wrongs\r\naggravated, multiplied, and unredressed, peace with dishonor, or war\r\nwithout justice, union, or resources, in \"the calm lights of mild\r\nphilosophy.\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever they may anticipate as the next measure of prudence and\r\nsafety, they have explained nothing to the house. After rejecting the\r\ntreaty, what is to be the next step? They must have foreseen what ought\r\nto be done; they have doubtless resolved what to propose. Why then are\r\nthey silent? Dare they not avow their plan of conduct, or do they wait\r\ntill our progress toward confusion shall guide them in forming it?\r\n\r\nLet me cheer the mind, weary, no doubt, and ready to despond on this\r\nprospect, by presenting another, which it is yet in our power to\r\nrealize. Is it possible for a real American to look at the prosperity of\r\nthis country without some desire for its continuance--without some\r\nrespect for the measures which, many will say, produced, and all will\r\nconfess, have preserved, it? Will he not feel some dread that a change\r\nof system will reverse the scene? The well-grounded fears of our\r\ncitizens in 1794 were removed by the treaty, but are not forgotten. Then\r\nthey deemed war nearly inevitable, and would not this adjustment have\r\nbeen considered, at that day, as a happy escape from the calamity? The\r\ngreat interest and the general desire of our people, was to enjoy the\r\nadvantages of neutrality. This instrument, however misrepresented,\r\naffords America that inestimable security. The causes of our disputes\r\nare either cut up by the roots, or referred to a new negotiation after\r\nthe end of the European war. This was gaining everything, because it\r\nconfirmed our neutrality, by which our citizens are gaining everything.\r\nThis alone would justify the engagements of the government. For, when\r\nthe fiery vapors of the war lowered in the skirts of our horizon, all\r\nour wishes were concentred in this one, that we might escape the\r\ndesolation of the storm. This treaty, like a rainbow on the edge of the\r\ncloud, marked to our eyes the space where it was raging, and afforded,\r\nat the same time, the sure prognostic of fair weather. If we reject it,\r\nthe vivid colors will grow pale,--it will be a baleful meteor portending\r\ntempest and war.\r\n\r\nLet us not hesitate, then, to agree to the appropriation to carry it\r\ninto faithful execution.\r\n\r\nThus we shall save the faith of our nation, secure its peace, and\r\ndiffuse the spirit of confidence and enterprise that will augment its\r\nprosperity. The progress of wealth and improvement is wonderful, and,\r\nsome will think, too rapid. The field for exertion is fruitful and vast,\r\nand if peace and good government should be preserved, the acquisitions\r\nof our citizens are not so pleasing as the proofs of their industry--as\r\nthe instruments of their future success. The rewards of exertion go to\r\naugment its power. Profit is every hour becoming capital. The vast crop\r\nof our neutrality is all seed-wheat, and is sown again to swell, almost\r\nbeyond calculation, the future harvest of prosperity. And in this\r\nprogress, what seems to be fiction is found to fall short of experience.\r\n\r\nI rose to speak under impressions that I would have resisted if I could.\r\nThose who see me will believe that the reduced state of my health has\r\nunfitted me, almost equally for much exertion of body or mind.\r\nUnprepared for debate, by careful reflection in my retirement, or by\r\nlong attention here, I thought the resolution I had taken to sit silent,\r\nwas imposed by necesity, and would cost me no effort to maintain. With a\r\nmind thus vacant of ideas, and sinking, as I really am, under a sense of\r\nweakness, I imagined the very desire of speaking was extinguished by the\r\npersuasion that I had nothing to say. Yet, when I come to the moment of\r\ndeciding the vote, I start back with dread from the edge of the pit into\r\nwhich we are plunging. In my view, even the minutes I have spent in\r\nexpostulation have their value, because they protract the crisis, and\r\nthe short period in which alone we may resolve to escape it.\r\n\r\nI have thus been led, by my feelings, to speak more at length than I\r\nintended. Yet I have, perhaps, as little personal interest in the event\r\nas any one here. There is, I believe, no member who will not think his\r\nchance to be a witness of the consequences greater than mine. If,\r\nhowever, the vote shall pass to reject, and a spirit should rise, as it\r\nwill, with the public disorders, to make confusion worse confounded,\r\neven I, slender and almost broken as my hold upon life is, may outlive\r\nthe government and constitution of my country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN NICHOLAS\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PROPOSED REPEAL OF THE SEDITION LAW\r\n\r\n--HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, FEB. 25, 1799\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Select Committee had very truly stated that only the second and\r\nthird sections of the act are complained of; that the part of the law\r\nwhich punishes seditious acts is acquiesced in, and that the part which\r\ngoes to restrain what are called seditious writings is alone the object\r\nof the petitions. This part of the law is complained of as being\r\nunwarranted by the Constitution, and destructive of the first principles\r\nof republican government. It is always justifiable, in examining the\r\nprinciple of a law, to inquire what other laws can be passed with equal\r\nreason, and to impute to it all the mischiefs for which it may be used\r\nas a precedent.\r\n\r\nIn this case, little inquiry is left for us to make, the arguments in\r\nfavor of the law carrying us immediately and by inevitable consequence\r\nto absolute power over the press.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that the Constitution has given any express\r\nauthority, which they claim, for passing this law, and it is claimed\r\nonly as implied in that clause of the Constitution which says: \"Congress\r\nshall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper\r\nfor carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers\r\nvested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or\r\nin any department or officer thereof.\" It is clear that this clause was\r\nintended to be merely an auxiliary to the powers specially enumerated in\r\nthe Constitution; and it must, therefore, be so construed as to aid\r\nthem, and at the same time to leave the boundaries between the General\r\nGovernment and the State governments untouched. The argument by which\r\nthe Select Committee have endeavored to establish the authority of\r\nCongress over the press is the following: \"Congress has power to punish\r\nseditious combinations to resist the laws, and therefore Congress must\r\nhave the power to punish false, scandalous, and malicious writings;\r\nbecause such writings render the Administration odious and contemptible\r\namong the people, and by doing so have a tendency to produce opposition\r\nto the laws.\" To make it support the construction of the committee, it\r\nshould say that \"Congress shall have power over all acts which are\r\nlikely to produce acts which hinder the execution of,\" etc. Our\r\nconstruction confines the power of Congress to such acts as immediately\r\ninterfere with the execution of the enumerated powers of Congress,\r\nbecause the power can only be necessary as well as proper when the acts\r\nwould really hinder the execution. The construction of the committee\r\nextends the power of Congress to all acts which have a relation, ever so\r\nmany degrees removed, to the enumerated powers, or rather to the acts\r\nwhich would hinder their execution. By our construction, the\r\nConstitution remains defined and limited, according to the plain intent\r\nand meaning of its framers; by the construction of the committee, all\r\nlimitation is lost, and it may be extended over the different actions of\r\nlife as speculative politicians may think fit. What has a greater\r\ntendency to fit men for insurrection and resistance to government than\r\ndissolute, immoral habits, at once destroying love of order, and\r\ndissipating the fortune which gives an interest in society? The doctrine\r\nthat Congress can punish any act which has a tendency to hinder the\r\nexecution of the laws, as well as acts which do hinder it, will,\r\ntherefore, clearly entitle them to assume a general guardianship over\r\nthe morals of the people of the United States. Again, nothing can have a\r\ngreater tendency to ensure obedience to law, and nothing can be more\r\nlikely to check every propensity to resistance to government, than\r\nvirtuous and wise education; therefore Congress must have power to\r\nsubject all the youth of the United States to a certain system of\r\neducation. It would be very easy to connect every sort of authority used\r\nby any government with the well-being of the General Government, and\r\nwith as much reason as the committee had for their opinion, to assign\r\nthe power to Congress, although the consequence must be the prostration\r\nof the State governments.\r\n\r\nBut enough has been said to show the necessity of adhering to the common\r\nmeaning of the word \"necessary\" in the clause under consideration, which\r\nis, that the power to be assumed must be one without which some one of\r\nthe enumerated powers cannot exist or be maintained. It cannot escape\r\nnotice, however, that the doctrine contended for, that the\r\nAdministration must be protected against writings which are likely to\r\nbring it into contempt, as tending to opposition, will apply with more\r\nforce to truth than falsehood. It cannot be denied that the discovery of\r\nmaladministration will bring more lasting discredit on the government of\r\na country than the same charges would if untrue. This is not an alarm\r\nfounded merely on construction, for the governments which have exercised\r\ncontrol over the press have carried it the whole length. This is\r\nnotoriously the law of England, whence this system has been drawn; for\r\nthere truth and falsehood are alike subject to punishment, if the\r\npublication brings contempt on the officers of government.\r\n\r\nThe law has been current by the fair pretence of punishing nothing but\r\nfalsehood, and by holding out to the accused the liberty of proving the\r\ntruth of the writing; but it was from the first apprehended, and it\r\nseems now to be adjudged (the doctrine has certainly been asserted on\r\nthis floor), that matters of opinion, arising on notorious facts, come\r\nunder the law. If this is the case, where is the advantage of the law\r\nrequiring that the writing should be false before a man shall be liable\r\nto punishment, or of his having the liberty of proving the truth of his\r\nwriting? Of the truth of facts there is an almost certain test; the\r\nbelief of honest men is certain enough to entitle it to great\r\nconfidence; but their opinions have no certainty at all. The trial of\r\nthe truth of opinions, in the best state of society, would be altogether\r\nprecarious; and perhaps a jury of twelve men could never be found to\r\nagree in any one opinion. At the present moment, when, unfortunately,\r\nopinion is almost entirely governed by prejudice and passion, it may be\r\nmore decided, but nobody will say it is more respectable. Chance must\r\ndetermine whether political opinions are true or false, and it will not\r\nunfrequently happen that a man will be punished for publishing opinions\r\nwhich are sincerely his, and which are of a nature to be extremely\r\ninteresting to the public, merely because accident or design has\r\ncollected a jury of different sentiments.\r\n\r\nIs the power claimed proper for Congress to possess? It is believed not,\r\nand this will readily be admitted if it can be proved, as I think it\r\ncan, that the persons who administer the government have an interest in\r\nthe power to be confided opposed to that of the community. It must be\r\nagreed that the nature of our government makes a diffusion of knowledge\r\nof public affairs necessary and proper, and that the people have no mode\r\nof obtaining it but through the press. The necessity for their having\r\nthis information results from its being their duty to elect all the\r\nparts of the Government, and, in this way, to sit in judgment over the\r\nconduct of those who have been heretofore employed. The most important\r\nand necessary information for the people to receive is that of the\r\nmisconduct of the Government, because their good deeds, although they\r\nwill produce affection and gratitude to public officers, will only\r\nconfirm the existing confidence, and will, therefore, make no change in\r\nthe conduct of the people. The question, then, whether the Government\r\nought to have control over the persons who alone can give information\r\nthroughout a country is nothing more than this, whether men, interested\r\nin suppressing information necessary for the people to have, ought to be\r\nentrusted with the power, or whether they ought to have a power which\r\ntheir personal interest leads to the abuse of. I am sure no candid man\r\nwill hesitate about the answer; and it may also safely be left with\r\ningenuous men to say whether the misconduct which we sometimes see in\r\nthe press had not better be borne with, than to run the risk of\r\nconfiding the power of correction to men who will be constantly urged by\r\ntheir own feelings to destroy its usefulness. How long can it be\r\ndesirable to have periodical elections for the purpose of judging of the\r\nconduct of our rulers, when the channels of information may be choked at\r\ntheir will?\r\n\r\nBut, sir, I have ever believed this question as settled by an amendment\r\nto the Constitution, proposed with others for declaring and restricting\r\nits powers, as the preamble declares, at the request of several of the\r\nStates, made at the adoption of the Constitution, in order to prevent\r\ntheir misconstruction and abuse. This amendment is in the following\r\nwords: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\r\nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the\r\nfreedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably\r\nto assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"\r\nThere can be no doubt about the effect of this amendment, unless the\r\n\"freedom of the press\" means something very different from what it\r\nseems; or unless there was some actual restraint upon it, under the\r\nConstitution of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this\r\namendment, commensurate with that imposed by this law. Both are\r\nasserted, viz., that the \"freedom of the press\" has a defined, limited\r\nmeaning, and that the restraints of the common law were in force under\r\nthe United States, and are greater than those of the act of Congress,\r\nand that, therefore, either way the \"freedom of the press\" is not\r\nabridged.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted by the select committee, and by everybody who has gone\r\nbefore them in this discussion, that the \"freedom of the press,\"\r\naccording to the universally received acceptation of the expression,\r\nmeans only an exemption from all previous restraints on publication, but\r\nnot an exemption from any punishment Government pleases to inflict for\r\nwhat is published. This definition does not at all distinguish between\r\npublications of different sorts, but leaves all to the regulation of the\r\nlaw, only forbidding Government to interfere until the publication is\r\nreally made. The definition, if true, so reduces the effect of the\r\namendment that the power of Congress is left unlimited over the\r\nproductions of the press, and they are merely deprived of one mode of\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was certainly intended to produce some limitation to\r\nlegislative discretion, and it must be construed so as to produce such\r\nan effect, if it is possible. To give it such a construction as will\r\nbring it to a mere nullity would violate the strongest injunctions of\r\ncommon-sense and decorum, and yet that appears to me to be the effect of\r\nthe construction adopted by the committee. The effect of the amendment,\r\nsay the committee, is to prevent Government taking the press from its\r\nowner; but how is their power lessened by this, when they may take the\r\nprinter from his press and imprison him for any length of time, for\r\npublishing what they choose to prohibit, although it maybe ever so\r\nproper for public information? The result is that Government may forbid\r\nany species of writing, true as well as false, to be published; may\r\ninflict the heaviest punishments they can devise for disobedience, and\r\nyet we are very gravely assured that this is the \"freedom of the press.\"\r\n\r\nA distinction is very frequently relied on between the freedom and the\r\nlicentiousness of the press, which it is proper to examine. This seems\r\nto me to refute every other argument which is used on this subject; it\r\namounts to an admission that there are some acts of the press which\r\nCongress ought not to have power to restrain, and that by the amendment\r\nthey are prohibited to restrain these acts. Nov, to justify any act of\r\nCongress, they ought to show the boundary between what is prohibited and\r\nwhat is permitted, and that the act is not within the prohibited class.\r\nThe Constitution has fixed no such boundary, therefore they can pretend\r\nto no power over the press, without claiming the right of defining what\r\nis freedom and what is licentiousness, and that would be to claim a\r\nright which would defeat the Constitution; for every Congress would have\r\nthe same right, and the freedom of the press would fluctuate according\r\nto the will of the legislature. This is, therefore, only a new mode of\r\nclaiming absolute power over the press.\r\n\r\nIt is said there is a common law which makes part of the law of the\r\nUnited States, which restrained the press more than the act of Congress\r\nhas done, and that therefore there is no abridgment of its freedom. What\r\nthis common law is I cannot conceive, nor have I seen anybody who could\r\nexplain himself when he was talking of it. It certainly is not a common\r\nlaw of the United States, acquired, as that of England was, by\r\nimmemorial usage. The standing of the Government makes this impossible.\r\nIt cannot be a code of laws adopted because they were universally in use\r\nin the States, for the States had no uniform code; and, if they had, it\r\ncould hardly become, by implication, part of the code of a Government of\r\nlimited powers, from which every thing is expressly retained which is\r\nnot given. Is it the law of England, at any particular period, which is\r\nadopted? But the nature of the law of England makes it impossible that\r\nit should have been adopted in the lump into such a Government as this\r\nis, because it was a complete system for the management of all the\r\naffairs of a country. It regulated estates, punished all crimes, and, in\r\nshort, went to all things for which laws were necessary. But how was\r\nthis law adopted? Was it by the Constitution? If so, it is immutable and\r\nincapable of amendment. In what part of the Constitution is it declared\r\nto be adopted? Was it adopted by the courts? From whom do they derive\r\ntheir authority? The Constitution, in the clause first cited, relies on\r\nCongress to pass all laws necessary to enable the courts to carry their\r\npowers into execution; it cannot, therefore, have been intended to give\r\nthem a power not necessary to their declared powers. There does not seem\r\nto me the smallest pretext for so monstrous an assumption; on the\r\ncontrary, while the Constitution is silent about it, every fair\r\ninference is against it.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, therefore, I am fully satisfied that no power is given\r\nby the Constitution to control the press, and that such laws are\r\nexpressly prohibited by the amendment. I think it inconsistent with the\r\nnature of our Government that its administration should have power to\r\nrestrain animadversions on public measures, and for protection from\r\nprivate injury from defamation the States are fully competent. It is to\r\nthem that our officers must look for protection of persons, estates, and\r\nevery other personal right; and, therefore, I see no reason why it is\r\nnot proper to rely upon it for defence against private libels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF DEMOCRACY.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural address of President Jefferson has been given the first\r\nplace under this period, notwithstanding the fact that it was not at all\r\nan oration. The inaugural addresses of presidents Washington and Adams\r\nwere really orations, although written, depending for much of their\r\neffect on the personal presence of him who delivered the address; that\r\nof Jefferson was altogether a business document, sent to be read by the\r\ntwo houses of Congress for their information, and without any of the\r\nadjuncts of the orator.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, nevertheless, to spare the inaugural address of the\r\nfirst Democratic President, for it is pervaded by a personality which,\r\nif quieter in its operation, was more potent in results than the most\r\nburning eloquence could have been. The spirit of modern democracy, which\r\nhas become, for good or evil, the common characteristic of all American\r\nparties and leaders, was here first put into living words. Triumphant in\r\nnational politics, this spirit now had but one field of struggle, the\r\npolitics of the States, and here its efforts were for years bent to the\r\nabolition of every remnant of limitation on individual liberty. Outside\r\nof New England, the change was accomplished as rapidly as the forms of\r\nlaw could be put into the necessary direction; remnants of\r\necclesiastical government, ecclesiastical taxes of even the mildest\r\ndescription, restrictions on manhood suffrage, State electoral systems,\r\nwere the immediate victims of the new spirit, and the first term of Mr.\r\nJefferson saw most of the States under democratic governments. Inside of\r\nNew England, the change was stubbornly resisted, and, for a time, with\r\nsuccess. For about twenty years, the general rule was that New England\r\nand Delaware were federalist, and the rest of the country was\r\ndemocratic. But even in New England, a strong democratic minority was\r\ngrowing up, and about 1820 the last barriers of federalism gave way;\r\nConnecticut, the federalist \"land of steady habits,\" accepted a new and\r\ndemocratic constitution; Massachusetts modified hers; and the new and\r\nreliably democratic State of Maine was brought into existence. The \"era\r\nof good feeling\" signalized the extinction of the federal party and the\r\nuniversal reign of democracy. The length of this period of contest is\r\nthe strongest testimony to the stubbornness of the New England fibre.\r\nEstimated by States, the success of democracy was about as complete in\r\n1803 as in 1817; but it required fifteen years of persistent struggle to\r\nconvince the smallest section of the Union that it was hopelessly\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nThe whole period was a succession of great events. The acquisition of\r\nLouisiana, stretching from the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains, laid,\r\nin 1803, the foundations of that imperial domain which the steamboat and\r\nrailroad were to convert to use in after-years. The continental empire\r\nof Napoleon and the island empire of Great Britain drifted into a\r\nstruggle for life or death which hardly knew a breathing space until the\r\nlast charge at Waterloo, and from the beginning it was conducted by both\r\ncombatants with a reckless disregard of international public opinion and\r\nneutral rights which is hardly credible but for the official records.\r\nEvery injury inflicted on neutral commerce by one belligerent was\r\npromptly imitated or exceeded by the other, and the two were perfectly\r\nin accord in insisting on the convenient doctrine of international law,\r\nthat, unless neutral rights were enforced by the neutral against one\r\nbelligerent, the injury became open to the imitation of the other. In\r\nthe process of imitation, each belligerent took care to pass at least a\r\nlittle beyond the precedent; and thus, beginning with a paper blockade\r\nof the northern coast of the continent by the British Government, the\r\nprocess advanced, by alternate \"retaliations,\" to a British proclamation\r\nspecifying the ports of the world to which American vessels were to be\r\nallowed to trade, stopping in England or its dependencies to pay taxes\r\nen route. These two almost contemporary events, the acquisition of\r\nLouisiana and the insolent pretensions of the European belligerents,\r\nwere the central points of two distinct influences which bore strongly\r\non the development of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe dominant party, the republicans, had a horror of a national debt\r\nwhich almost amounted to a mania. The associations of the term, derived\r\nfrom their reading of English history, all pointed to a condition of\r\naffairs in which the rise of a strong aristocracy was inevitable; and,\r\nto avoid the latter, they were determined to pay off the former. The\r\npayment for Louisiana precluded, in their opinion, the support of a\r\nrespectable navy; and the remnants of colonialism in their party\r\npredisposed them to adopt an ostrich policy instead. The Embargo act was\r\npassed in 1807, forbidding all foreign commerce. The evident failure of\r\nthis act to influence the belligerents brought about its repeal in 1809,\r\nand the substitution of the Non-intercourse act. This prohibited\r\ncommercial intercourse with England and France until either should\r\nrevoke its injurious edicts. Napoleon, by an empty and spurious\r\nrevocation in 1810, induced Congress to withdraw the act in respect to\r\nFrance, keeping it alive in respect to England. England refused to admit\r\nthe sincerity of the French revocation, to withdraw her Orders in\r\nCouncil, or to cease impressing American seamen. The choice left to the\r\nUnited States was between war and submission.\r\n\r\nThe federalist leaders saw that, while their party strength was confined\r\nto a continually decreasing territory, the opposing democracy not only\r\nhad gained the mass of the original United States, but was swarming\r\ntoward and beyond the Mississippi. They dropped to the level of a mere\r\nparty of opposition; they went further until the only article of their\r\npolitical creed was State sovereignty; some of them went one step\r\nfurther, and dabbled in hopeless projects for secession and the formation\r\nof a New England republic of five States. It is difficult to perceive\r\nany advantage to public affairs in the closing years of the federal\r\nparty, except that, by impelling the democratic leaders to really\r\nnational acts and sympathies, it unwittingly aided in the development of\r\nnationality from democracy.\r\n\r\nIf the essential characteristic of colonialism is the sense of\r\ndependence and the desire to imitate, democracy, at least in its earlier\r\nphases, begets the opposite qualities. The Congressional elections of\r\n1810-11 showed that the people had gone further in democracy than their\r\nleaders. \"Submission men\" were generally defeated in the election; new\r\nleaders, like Clay, Calhoun, and Crawford, made the dominant party a war\r\nparty, and forced the President into their policy; and the war of 1812\r\nwas begun. Its early defeats on land, its startling successes at sea,\r\nits financial straits, the desperation of the contest after the fall of\r\nNapoleon, and the brilliant victory which crowned its close, all\r\ncombined to raise the national feeling to the highest pitch; and the\r\nfederalists, whose stock object of denunciation was \"Mr. Madison's war,\"\r\nthough Mr. Madison was about the most unwilling participant in it, came\r\nout of it under the ban of every national sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Mr. Quincy, in many points one of the most eloquent of our\r\npolitical history, will show the brightest phase of federalism at its\r\nlowest ebb. One can hardly compare it with that of Mr. Clay, which\r\nfollows it, without noticing the national character of the latter, as\r\ncontrasted with the lack of nationality of the former. It seems, also,\r\nthat Mr. Clay's speech carries, in its internal characteristics,\r\nsufficient evidence of the natural forces which tended to make democracy\r\na national power, and not a mere adjunct of State sovereignty, wherever\r\nthe oblique influence of slavery was absent. For this reason, it has\r\nbeen taken as a convenient introduction to the topic which follows, the\r\nRise of Nationality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON,\r\n\r\nOF VIRGINIA, (BORN 1743, DIED 1826.)\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON, AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES,\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:\r\n\r\nCalled upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our\r\ncountry, I avail myself of the presence of that portion of my\r\nfellow-citizens which is here assembled, to express my grateful thanks\r\nfor the favor with which they have been pleased to look toward me, to\r\ndeclare a sincere consciousness, that the task is above my talents, and\r\nthat I approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments, which the\r\ngreatness of the charge, and the weakness of my powers, so justly\r\ninspire. A rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land,\r\ntraversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry,\r\nengaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right,\r\nadvancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye; when I\r\ncontemplate these transcendent objects, and see the honor, the\r\nhappiness, and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue\r\nand the auspices of this day, I shrink from the contemplation, and\r\nhumble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking. Utterly, indeed,\r\nshould I despair, did not the presence of many, whom I see here, remind\r\nme, that, in the other high authorities provided by our Constitution, I\r\nshall find resources of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal, on which to rely\r\nunder all difficulties. To you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with\r\nthe sovereign functions of legislation, and to those associated with\r\nyou, I look with encouragement for that guidance and support which may\r\nenable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked,\r\namidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world.\r\n\r\nDuring the contest of opinion through which we have passed, the\r\nanimation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect\r\nwhich might impose on strangers unused to think freely, and to speak and\r\nto write what they think; but this being now decided by the voice of the\r\nnation, announced according to the rules of the Constitution, all will\r\nof course arrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in\r\ncommon efforts for the common good. All too will bear in mind this\r\nsacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases\r\nto prevail, that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that the\r\nminority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, and\r\nto violate which would be oppression. Let us then, fellow-citizens,\r\nunite with one heart and one mind, let us restore to social intercourse\r\nthat harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself\r\nare but dreary things. And let us reflect, that having banished from our\r\nland that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and\r\nsuffered, we have yet gained little, if we countenance a political\r\nintolerance, as despotic, as wicked, and as capable of as bitter and\r\nbloody persecutions. During the throes and convulsions of the ancient\r\nworld, during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking through\r\nblood and slaughter his long-lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the\r\nagitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful\r\nshore; that this should be more felt and feared by some, and less by\r\nothers, and should divide opinions as to measures of safety; but every\r\ndifference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called\r\nby different names brethren of the same principle. We are all\r\nRepublicans; we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who wish\r\nto dissolve this Union, or to change its republican form, let them stand\r\nundisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may\r\nbe tolerated, where reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed,\r\nthat some honest men fear that a republican government cannot be strong;\r\nthat this government is not strong enough. But would the honest patriot,\r\nin the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a government which\r\nhas so far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic and visionary fear,\r\nthat this government, the world's best hope, may, by possibility, want\r\nenergy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the contrary,\r\nthe strongest government on earth. I believe it the only one where every\r\nman, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law, and\r\nwould meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern.\r\nSometimes it is said, that man cannot be trusted with the government of\r\nhimself. Can he then be trusted with the government of others? Or, have\r\nwe found angels in the form of kings, to govern him? Let history answer\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nLet us then, with courage and confidence, pursue our own federal and\r\nrepublican principles; our attachment to union and representative\r\ngovernment. Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the\r\nexterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe; too high-minded to\r\nendure the degradation of the others, possessing a chosen country, with\r\nroom enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth\r\ngeneration, entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of\r\nour own faculties, to the acquisition of our own industry, to honor and\r\nconfidence from our fellow-citizens, resulting not from birth, but from\r\nour actions and their sense of them, enlightened by a benign religion,\r\nprofessed indeed and practised in various forms, yet all of them\r\ninculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love of man,\r\nacknowledging and adoring an overruling Providence, which, by all its\r\ndispensations, proves that it delights in the happiness of man here, and\r\nhis greater happiness hereafter; with all these blessings, what more is\r\nnecessary to make us a happy and prosperous people? Still one thing\r\nmore, fellow-citizens, a wise and frugal government, which shall\r\nrestrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free\r\nto regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall\r\nnot take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the\r\nsum of good government; and this is necessary to close the circle of our\r\nfelicities.\r\n\r\nAbout to enter, fellow-citizens, upon the exercise of duties which\r\ncomprehend every thing dear and valuable to you, it is proper you should\r\nunderstand what I deem the essential principles of our government, and\r\nconsequently, those which ought to shape its administration. I will\r\ncompress them within the narrowest compass they will bear, stating the\r\ngeneral principle, but not all its limitations. Equal and exact justice\r\nto all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political;\r\npeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling\r\nalliances with none; the support of the State governments in all their\r\nrights, as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns,\r\nand the surest bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies; the\r\npreservation of the general government in its whole constitutional\r\nvigor, as the sheet-anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad; a\r\njealous care of the right of election by the people, a mild and safe\r\ncorrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where\r\npeaceable remedies are unprovided; absolute acquiescence in the\r\ndecisions of the majority, the vital principle of republics, from which\r\nthere is no appeal but to force, the vital principle and immediate\r\nparent of despotism; a well-disciplined militia, our best reliance in\r\npeace, and for the first moments of war, till regulars may relieve them;\r\nthe supremacy of the civil over the military authority; economy in the\r\npublic expense, that labor may be lightly burdened; the honest payment\r\nof our debts, and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement\r\nof agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid; the diffusion of\r\ninformation, and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public\r\nreason; freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of\r\nperson, under the protection of the _habeas corpus_, and trial by juries\r\nimpartially selected. These principles form the bright constellation,\r\nwhich has gone before us, and guided our steps through an age of\r\nrevolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages, and blood of our\r\nheroes, have been devoted to their attainment; they should be the creed\r\nof our political faith, the text of civic instruction, the touchstone by\r\nwhich to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander from\r\nthem in moments of error or of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our\r\nsteps, and to regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty, and\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nI repair, then, fellow-citizens, to the post you have assigned me. With\r\nexperience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties\r\nof this, the greatest of all, I have learned to expect that it will\r\nrarely fall to the lot of imperfect man, to retire from this station\r\nwith the reputation and the favor which bring him into it. Without\r\npretensions to that high confidence you reposed in our first and\r\ngreatest revolutionary character, whose pre-eminent services had\r\nentitled him to the first place in his country's love, and destined for\r\nhim the fairest page in the volume of faithful history, I ask so much\r\nconfidence only as may give firmness and effect to the legal\r\nadministration of your affairs. I shall often go wrong through defect of\r\njudgment. When right, I shall often be thought wrong by those whose\r\npositions will not command a view of the whole ground. I ask your\r\nindulgence for my own errors, which will never be intentional; and your\r\nsupport against the errors of others, who may condemn what they would\r\nnot, if seen in all its parts. The approbation implied by your suffrage,\r\nis a great consolation to me for the past; and my future solicitude will\r\nbe, to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance,\r\nto conciliate that of others, by doing them all the good in my power,\r\nand to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all.\r\n\r\nRelying then on the patronage of your good-will, I advance with\r\nobedience to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become\r\nsensible how much better choices it is in your power to make. And may\r\nthat infinite Power which rules the destinies of the universe, lead our\r\ncouncils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for your peace\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN RANDOLPH,\r\n\r\n--OF VIRGINIA' (BORN 1773, DIED 1833.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE MILITIA BILL--HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, DEC. 10, 1811.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER:\r\n\r\nThis is a question, as it has been presented to this House, of peace or\r\nwar. In that light it has been argued; in no other light can I consider\r\nit, after the declarations made by members of the Committee of Foreign\r\nRelations.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Foreign Relations have, indeed, decided that the\r\nsubject of arming the militia (which has been pressed upon them as\r\nindispensable to the public security) does not come within the scope of\r\ntheir authority. On what ground, I have been, and still am, unable to\r\nsee, they have felt themselves authorized to recommend the raising of\r\nstanding armies, with a view (as has been declared) of immediate war--a\r\nwar not of defence, but of conquest, of aggrandizement, of ambition--a\r\nwar foreign to the interests of this country; to the interests of\r\nhumanity itself. * * *\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from smiling at the liberality of the gentleman in\r\ngiving Canada to New York in order to strengthen the northern balance of\r\npower; while, at the same time, he forewarns her that the western scale\r\nmust preponderate. I can almost fancy that I see the Capitol in motion\r\ntoward the falls of Ohio; after a short sojourn, taking its flight to\r\nthe Mississippi, and finally alighting at Darien; which, when the\r\ngentleman's dreams are realized, will be a most eligible seat of\r\ngovernment for the new republic (or empire) of the two Americas! But it\r\nseems that in 1808 we talked and acted foolishly, and to give some color\r\nof consistency to that folly we must now commit a greater.\r\n\r\nI hope we shall act a wise part; take warning by our follies since we\r\nhave become sensible of them, and resolve to talk and act foolishly no\r\nmore. It is, indeed, high time to give over such preposterous language\r\nand proceedings. This war of conquest, a war for the acquisition of\r\nterritory and subjects, is to be a new commentary on the doctrine that\r\nrepublicans are destitute of ambition; that they are addicted to peace,\r\nwedded to the happiness and safety of the great body of their people.\r\nBut it seems this is to be a holiday campaign; there is to be no expense\r\nof blood, or of treasure on our part; Canada is to conquer herself; she\r\nis to be subdued by the principles of fraternity! The people of that\r\ncountry are first to be seduced from their allegiance and converted into\r\ntraitors, as preparatory to making them good citizens! Although I must\r\nacknowledge that some of our flaming patriots were thus manufactured, I\r\ndo not think the process would hold good with a whole community. It is a\r\ndangerous experiment. We are to succeed in the French mode, by the\r\nsystem of fraternization--all is French. But how dreadfully it might be\r\nretorted on the southern and western slave-holding States. I detest this\r\nsubornation of treason. No; if we must have them, let them fall by the\r\nvalor of our arms; by fair, legitimate conquest; not become the victims\r\nof treacherous seduction.\r\n\r\nI am not surprised at the war spirit which is manifesting itself in\r\ngentlemen from the South. In the year 1805-6, in a struggle for the\r\ncarrying trade of belligerent colonial produce, this country was most\r\nunwisely brought into collision with the great powers of Europe. By a\r\nseries of most impolitic and ruinous measures, utterly incomprehensible\r\nto every rational, sober-minded man, the Southern planters, by their own\r\nvotes, have succeeded in knocking down the price of cotton to seven\r\ncents, and of tobacco (a few choice crops excepted) to nothing; and in\r\nraising the price of blankets (of which a few would not be amiss in a\r\nCanadian campaign), coarse woollens, and every article of first\r\nnecessity, three or four hundred per centum. And now, that by our own\r\nacts, we have brought ourselves into this unprecedented condition, we\r\nmust get out of it in any way, but by an acknowledgment of our own want\r\nof wisdom and forecast. But is war the true remedy? Who will profit by\r\nit? Speculators; a few lucky merchants, who draw prizes in the lottery;\r\ncommissaries and contractors. Who must suffer by it? The people. It is\r\ntheir blood, their taxes that must flow to support it.\r\n\r\nI am gratified to find gentlemen acknowledging the demoralizing and\r\ndestructive consequences of the non-importation law; confessing the\r\ntruth of all that its opponents foretold, when it was enacted. And will\r\nyou plunge yourselves in war, because you have passed a foolish and\r\nruinous law, and are ashamed to repeal it? But our good friend, the\r\nFrench emperor, stands in the way of its repeal, and we cannot go too\r\nfar in making sacrifices to him, who has given such demonstration of his\r\nlove for the Americans; we must, in point of fact, become parties to his\r\nwar. Who can be so cruel as to refuse him that favor? My imagination\r\nshrinks from the miseries of such a connection. I call upon the House to\r\nreflect, whether they are not about to abandon all reclamation for the\r\nunparalleled outrages, \"insults, and injuries\" of the French government;\r\nto give up our claim for plundered millions; and I ask what reparation\r\nor atonement they can expect to obtain in hours of future dalliance,\r\nafter they shall have made a tender of their person to this great\r\ndeflowerer of the virginity of republics. We have, by our own wise (I\r\nwill not say wiseacre) measures, so increased the trade and wealth of\r\nMontreal and Quebec, that at last we begin to cast a wistful eye at\r\nCanada. Having done so much toward its improvement, by the exercise of\r\n\"our restrictive energies,\" we begin to think the laborer worthy of his\r\nhire, and to put in a claim for our portion. Suppose it ours, are we any\r\nnearer to our point? As his minister said to the king of Epirus, \"May we\r\nnot as well take our bottle of wine before as after this exploit?\" Go\r\nmarch to Canada! leave the broad bosom of the Chesapeake and her hundred\r\ntributary rivers; the whole line of sea-coast from Machias to St.\r\nMary's, unprotected! You have taken Quebec--have you conquered England?\r\nWill you seek for the deep foundations of her power in the frozen\r\ndeserts of Labrador?\r\n\r\n\"Her march is on the mountain wave, Her home is on the deep!\"\r\n\r\nWill you call upon her to leave your ports and harbors untouched only\r\njust till you can return from Canada, to defend them? The coast is to be\r\nleft defenceless, while men of the interior are revelling in conquest\r\nand spoil. * * *\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the report laid on the table, than the vultures were\r\nflocking around their prey--the carcass of a great military\r\nestablishment. Men of tainted reputation, of broken fortune (if they\r\never had any), and of battered constitutions, \"choice spirits tired of\r\nthe dull pursuits of civil life,\" were seeking after agencies and\r\ncommissions, willing to doze in gross stupidity over the public fire; to\r\nlight the public candle at both ends. Honorable men undoubtedly there\r\nare ready to serve their country; but what man of spirit, or of\r\nself-respect, will accept a commission in the present army? The\r\ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Grundy) addressed himself yesterday\r\nexclusively to the \"Republicans of the House.\" I know not whether I may\r\nconsider myself as entitled to any part of the benefit of the honorable\r\ngentleman's discourse. It belongs not, however, to that gentleman to\r\ndecide. If we must have an exposition of the doctrines of republicanism,\r\nI shall receive it from the fathers of the church, and not from the\r\njunior apprentices of the law. I shall appeal to my worthy friends from\r\nCarolina (Messrs. Macon and Stanford), \"men with whom I have measured my\r\nstrength,\" by whose side I have fought during the reign of terror; for\r\nit was indeed an hour of corruption, of oppression, of pollution. It was\r\nnot at all to my taste--that sort of republicanism which was supported,\r\non this side of the Atlantic, by the father of the sedition law, John\r\nAdams, and by Peter Porcupine on the other. Republicanism! of John Adams\r\nand William Cobbett! * * *\r\n\r\nGallant crusaders in the holy cause of republicanism. Such republicanism\r\ndoes, indeed, mean any thing or nothing. Our people will not submit to\r\nbe taxed for this war of conquest and dominion. The government of the\r\nUnited States was not calculated to wage offensive foreign war; it was\r\ninstituted for the common defence and the general welfare; and whosoever\r\nshould embark it in a war of offence, would put it to a test which it is\r\nby no means calculated to endure. Make it out that Great Britain has\r\ninstigated the Indians on a late occasion, and I am ready for battle,\r\nbut not for dominion. I am unwilling, however, under present\r\ncircumstances, to take Canada, at the risk of the Constitution, to\r\nembark in a common cause with France, and be dragged at the wheels of\r\nthe car of some Burr or Bonaparte. For a gentleman from Tennessee, or\r\nGenesee, or Lake Champlain, there may be some prospect of advantage.\r\nTheir hemp would bear a great price by the exclusion of foreign supply.\r\nIn that, too, the great importers are deeply interested. The upper\r\ncountry of the Hudson and the lakes would be enriched by the supplies\r\nfor the troops, which they alone could furnish. They would have the\r\nexclusive market; to say nothing of the increased preponderance from the\r\nacquisition of Canada and that section of the Union, which the Southern\r\nand Western States have already felt so severely in the Apportionment\r\nbill. * * *\r\n\r\nPermit me now, sir, to call your attention to the subject of our black\r\npopulation. I will touch this subject as tenderly as possible. It is\r\nwith reluctance that I touch it at all; but in cases of great emergency,\r\nthe State physician must not be deterred by a sickly, hysterical\r\nhumanity, from probing the wound of his patient; he must not be withheld\r\nby a fastidious and mistaken delicacy from representing his true\r\nsituation to his friends, or even to the sick man himself, when the\r\noccasion calls for it. What is the situation of the slave-holding\r\nStates? During the war of the Revolution, so fixed were their habits of\r\nsubordination, that while the whole country was overrun by the enemy,\r\nwho invited them to desert, no fear was ever entertained of an\r\ninsurrection of the slaves. During a war of seven years, with our\r\ncountry in possession of the enemy, no such danger was ever apprehended.\r\nBut should we, therefore, be unobservant spectators of the progress of\r\nsociety within the last twenty years; of the silent but powerful change\r\nwrought, by time and chance, upon its composition and temper? When the\r\nfountains of the great deep of abomination were broken up, even the poor\r\nslaves did not escape the general deluge. The French Revolution has\r\npolluted even them. * * *\r\n\r\nMen, dead to the operation of moral causes, have taken away from the\r\npoor slave his habit of loyalty and obedience to his master, which\r\nlightened his servitude by a double operation; beguiling his own cares\r\nand disarming his master's suspicions and severity; and now, like true\r\nempirics in politics, you are called upon to trust to the mere physical\r\nstrength of the fetter which holds him in bondage. You have deprived him\r\nof all moral restraint; you have tempted him to eat of the fruit of the\r\ntree of knowledge, just enough to perfect him in wickedness; you have\r\nopened his eyes to his nakedness; you have armed his nature against the\r\nhand that has fed, that has clothed him, that has cherished him in\r\nsickness; that hand which before he became a pupil of your school, he\r\nhad been accustomed to press with respectful affection. You have done\r\nall this--and then show him the gibbet and the wheel, as incentives to a\r\nsullen, repugnant obedience. God forbid, sir, that the Southern States\r\nshould ever see an enemy on their shores, with these infernal principles\r\nof French fraternity in the van. While talking of taking Canada, some of\r\nus are shuddering for our own safety at home. I speak from facts, when I\r\nsay, that the night-bell never tolls for fire in Richmond, that the\r\nmother does not hug her infant more closely to her bosom. I have been a\r\nwitness of some of the alarms in the capital of Virginia. * * *\r\n\r\nAgainst whom are these charges brought? Against men, who in the war of\r\nthe Revolution were in the councils of the nation, or fighting the\r\nbattles of your country. And by whom are they made? By runaways chiefly\r\nfrom the British dominions, since the breaking out of the French\r\ntroubles. It is insufferable. It cannot be borne. It must and ought,\r\nwith severity, to be put down in this House; and out of it to meet the\r\nlie direct. We have no fellow-feeling for the suffering and oppressed\r\nSpaniards! Yet even them we do not reprobate. Strange! that we should\r\nhave no objection to any other people or government, civilized or\r\nsavage, in the whole world! The great autocrat of all the Russias\r\nreceives the homage of our high consideration. The Dey of Algiers and\r\nhis divan of pirates are very civil, good sort of people, with whom we\r\nfind no difficulty in maintaining the relations of peace and amity.\r\n\"Turks, Jews, and infidels\"; Melimelli or the Little Turtle; barbarians\r\nand savages of every clime and color, are welcome to our arms. With\r\nchiefs of banditti, negro or mulatto, we can treat and trade. Name,\r\nhowever, but England, and all our antipathies are up in arms against\r\nher. Against whom? Against those whose blood runs in our veins; in\r\ncommon with whom, we claim Shakespeare, and Newton, and Chatham, for our\r\ncountrymen; whose form of government is the freest on earth, our own\r\nonly excepted; from whom every valuable principle of our own\r\ninstitutions has been borrowed: representation, jury trial, voting the\r\nsupplies, writ of habeas corpus, our whole civil and criminal\r\njurisprudence; against our fellow Protestants, identified in blood, in\r\nlanguage, in religion, with ourselves. In what school did the worthies\r\nof our land, the Washingtons, Henrys, Hancocks, Franklins, Rutledges of\r\nAmerica, learn those principles of civil liberty which were so nobly\r\nasserted by their wisdom and valor? American resistance to British\r\nusurpation has not been more warmly cherished by these great men and\r\ntheir compatriots; not more by Washington, Hancock, and Henry, than by\r\nChatham and his illustrious associates in the British Parliament. It\r\nought to be remembered, too, that the heart of the English people was\r\nwith us. It was a selfish and corrupt ministry, and their servile tools,\r\nto whom we were not more opposed than they were. I trust that none such\r\nmay ever exist among us; for tools will never be wanting to subserve the\r\npurposes, however ruinous or wicked, of kings and ministers of state. I\r\nacknowledge the influence of a Shakespeare and a Milton upon my\r\nimagination, of a Locke upon my understanding, of a Sidney upon my\r\npolitical principles, of a Chatham upon qualities which, would to God I\r\npossessed in common with that illustrious man! of a Tillotson, a\r\nSherlock, and a Porteus upon my religion. This is a British influence\r\nwhich I can never shake off. I allow much to the just and honest\r\nprejudices growing out of the Revolution. But by whom have they been\r\nsuppressed, when they ran counter to the interests of my country? By\r\nWashington. By whom, would you listen to them, are they most keenly\r\nfelt? By felons escaped from the jails of Paris, Newgate, and\r\nKilmainham, since the breaking out of the French Revolution; who, in\r\nthis abused and insulted country, have set up for political teachers,\r\nand whose disciples give no other proof of their progress in\r\nrepublicanism, except a blind devotion to the most ruthless military\r\ndespotism that the world ever saw. These are the patriots, who scruple\r\nnot to brand with the epithet of Tory, the men (looking toward the seat\r\nof Col. Stewart) by whose blood your liberties have been cemented. These\r\nare they, who hold in such keen remembrance the outrages of the British\r\narmies, from which many of them are deserters. Ask these self-styled\r\npatriots where they were during the American war (for they are, for the\r\nmost part, old enough to have borne arms), and you strike them dumb;\r\ntheir lips are closed in eternal silence. If it were allowable to\r\nentertain partialities, every consideration of blood, language,\r\nreligion, and interest, would incline us toward England: and yet, shall\r\nthey alone be extended to France and her ruler, whom we are bound to\r\nbelieve a chastening God suffers as the scourge of a guilty world! On\r\nall other nations he tramples; he holds them in contempt; England alone\r\nhe hates; he would, but he cannot, despise her; fear cannot despise; and\r\nshall we disparage our ancestors?\r\n\r\nBut the outrages and injuries of England--bred up in the principles of\r\nthe Revolution--I can never palliate, much less defend them. I well\r\nremember flying, with my mother and her new-born child, from Arnold and\r\nPhilips; and we were driven by Tarleton and other British Pandours from\r\npillar to post, while her husband was fighting the battles of his\r\ncountry. The impression is indelible on my memory; and yet (like my\r\nworthy old neighbor, who added seven buckshot to every cartridge at the\r\nbattle of Guilford, and drew fine sight at his man) I must be content to\r\nbe called a Tory by a patriot of the last importation. Let us not get\r\nrid of one evil (supposing it possible) at the expense of a greater;\r\n_mutatis mutandis_, suppose France in possession of the British naval\r\npower--and to her the trident must pass should England be unable to\r\nwield it--what would be your condition? What would be the situation of\r\nyour seaports, and their seafaring inhabitants? Ask Hamburg, Lubec! Ask\r\nSavannah! * * *\r\n\r\nShall republicans become the instruments of him who has effaced the\r\ntitle of Attila to the \"scourge of God!\" Yet, even Attila, in the\r\nfalling fortunes of civilization, had, no doubt, his advocates, his\r\ntools, his minions, his parasites, in the very countries that he\r\noverran; sons of that soil whereon his horse had trod; where grass could\r\nnever after grow. If perfectly fresh, instead of being as I am, my\r\nmemory clouded, my intellect stupefied, my strength and spirits\r\nexhausted, I could not give utterance to that strong detestation which I\r\nfeel toward (above all other works of the creation) such characters as\r\nGengis, Tamerlane, Kouli-Khan, or Bonaparte. My instincts involuntarily\r\nrevolt at their bare idea. Malefactors of the human race, who have\r\nground down man to a mere machine of their impious and bloody ambition!\r\nYet under all the accumulated wrongs, and insults, and robberies of the\r\nlast of these chieftains, are we not, in point of fact, about to become\r\na party to his views, a partner in his wars? * * *\r\n\r\nI call upon those professing to be republicans to make good the\r\npromises, held out by their republican predecessors, when they came into\r\npower; promises which, for years afterward, they honestly, faithfully\r\nfulfilled. We have vaunted of paying off the national debt, of\r\nretrenching useless establishments; and yet have now become as\r\ninfatuated with standing armies, loans, taxes, navies, and war as ever\r\nwere the Essex Junto!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF LOUISIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOSIAH QUINCY,\r\n\r\n--OF MASSACHUSETTS.' (BORN 1772, DIED 1864.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE ADMISSION OF LOUISIANA--HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JAN. 14, 1811.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER:\r\n\r\nI address you, sir, with anxiety and distress of mind, with me, wholly\r\nunprecedented. The friends of this bill seem to consider it as the\r\nexercise of a common power; as an ordinary affair; a mere municipal\r\nregulation, which they expect to see pass without other questions than\r\nthose concerning details. But, sir, the principle of this bill\r\nmaterially affects the liberties and rights of the whole people of the\r\nUnited States. To me it appears that it would justify a revolution in\r\nthis country; and that, in no great length of time it may produce it.\r\nWhen I see the zeal and perseverance with which this bill has been urged\r\nalong its parliamentary path, when I know the local interests and\r\nassociated projects which combine to promote its success, all opposition\r\nto it seems manifestly unavailing. I am almost tempted to leave, without\r\na struggle, my country to its fate. But, sir, while there is life, there\r\nis hope. So long as the fatal shaft has not yet sped, if Heaven so will,\r\nthe bow may be broken and the vigor of the mischief-meditating arm\r\nwithered. If there be a man in this House or nation, who cherishes the\r\nConstitution, under which we are assembled, as the chief stay of his\r\nhope, as the light which is destined to gladden his own day, and to\r\nsoften even the gloom of the grave, by the prospects it sheds over his\r\nchildren, I fall not behind him in such sentiments. I will yield to no\r\nman in attachment to this Constitution, in veneration for the sages who\r\nlaid its foundations, in devotion to those principles which form its\r\ncement and constitute its proportions. What then must be my feelings;\r\nwhat ought to be the feelings of a man, cherishing such sentiments, when\r\nhe sees an act contemplated which lays ruin at the foot of all these\r\nhopes? When he sees a principle of action about to be usurped, before\r\nthe operation of which the bands of this Constitution are no more than\r\nflax before the fire, or stubble before the whirlwind? When this bill\r\npasses, such an act is done; and such a principle is usurped.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, there is a great rule of human conduct, which he who\r\nhonestly observes, cannot err widely from the path of his sought duty.\r\nIt is, to be very scrupulous concerning the principles you select as the\r\ntest of your rights and obligations; to be very faithful in noticing the\r\nresult of their application; and to be very fearless in tracing and\r\nexposing their immediate effects and distant consequences. Under the\r\nsanction of this rule of conduct, I am compelled to declare it as my\r\ndeliberate opinion, that, if this bill passes, the bonds of this union\r\nare, virtually, dissolved; that the States which compose it are free\r\nfrom their moral obligations, and that as it will be the right of all,\r\nso it will be the duty of some, to prepare, definitely, for a\r\nseparation: amicably, if they can; _violently, if they must_.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Quincy was here called to order by Mr. Poindexter, delegate from\r\nthe Mississippi territory, for the words in italics. After it was\r\ndecided, upon an appeal to the House, that Mr. Quincy was in order, he\r\nproceeded.)\r\n\r\nI rejoice, Mr. Speaker, at the result of this appeal. Not from any\r\npersonal consideration, but from the respect paid to the essential\r\nrights of the people, in one of their representatives. When I spoke of\r\nthe separation of the States, as resulting from the violation of the\r\nConstitution contemplated in this bill, I spoke of it as a necessity,\r\ndeeply to be deprecated; but as resulting from causes so certain and\r\nobvious as to be absolutely inevitable, when the effect of the principle\r\nis practically experienced. It is to preserve, to guard the Constitution\r\nof my country, that I denounce this attempt. I would rouse the attention\r\nof gentlemen from the apathy with which they seem beset. These\r\nobservations are not made in a corner; there is no low intrigue; no\r\nsecret machination. I am on the people's own ground; to them I appeal\r\nconcerning their own rights, their own liberties, their own intent, in\r\nadopting this Constitution. The voice I have uttered, at which gentlemen\r\nstartle with such agitation, is no unfriendly voice. I intended it as a\r\nvoice of warning. By this people, and by the event, if this bill passes,\r\nI am willing to be judged, whether it be not a voice of wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe bill which is now proposed to be passed has this assumed principle\r\nfor its basis; that the three branches of this national government,\r\nwithout recurrence to conventions of the people in the States, or to the\r\nLegislatures of the States, are authorized to admit new partners to a\r\nshare of the political power, in countries out of the original limits of\r\nthe United States. Now, this assumed principle, I maintain to be\r\naltogether without any sanction in the Constitution. I declare it to be\r\na manifest and atrocious usurpation of power; of a nature, dissolving,\r\naccording to undeniable principles of moral law, the obligations of our\r\nnational compact; and leading to all the awful con-sequences which flow\r\nfrom such a state of things. Concerning this assumed principle, which is\r\nthe basis of this bill, this is the general position, on which I rest my\r\nargument; that if the authority, now proposed to be exercised, be\r\ndelegated to the three branches of the government by virtue of the\r\nConstitution, it results either from its general nature, or from its\r\nparticular provisions. I shall consider distinctly both these sources,\r\nin relation to this pretended power.\r\n\r\nTouching the general nature of the instrument called the Constitution of\r\nthe United States there is no obscurity; it has no fabled descent, like\r\nthe palladium of ancient Troy, from the heavens. Its origin is not\r\nconfused by the mists of time, or hidden by the darkness of passed,\r\nunexplored ages; it is the fabric of our day. Some now living, had a\r\nshare in its construction; all of us stood by, and saw the rising of the\r\nedifice. There can be no doubt about its nature. It is a political\r\ncompact. By whom? And about what? The preamble to the instrument will\r\nanswer these questions.\r\n\r\n\"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect\r\nunion, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the\r\ncommon defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of\r\nliberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this\r\nConstitution, for the United States of America.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, we the people of the United States, for ourselves and our\r\nposterity; not for the people of Louisiana; nor for the people of New\r\nOrleans or of Canada. None of these enter into the scope of the\r\ninstrument; it embraces only \"the United States of America.\" Who these\r\nare, it may seem strange in this place to inquire. But truly, sir, our\r\nimaginations have, of late, been so accustomed to wander after new\r\nsettlements to the very ends of the earth, that it will not be time ill\r\nspent to inquire what this phrase means, and what it includes. These are\r\nnot terms adopted at hazard; they have reference to a state of things\r\nexisting anterior to the Constitution. When the people of the present\r\nUnited States began to contemplate a severance from their parent State,\r\nit was a long time before they fixed definitely the name by which they\r\nwould be designated. In 1774, they called themselves \"the Colonies and\r\nProvinces of North America.\" In 1775, \"the Representatives of the United\r\nColonies of North America.\" In the Declaration of Independence, \"the\r\nRepresentatives of the United States of America.\" And finally, in the\r\narticles of confederation, the style of the confederacy is declared to\r\nbe \"the United States of America.\" It was with reference to the old\r\narticles of confederation, and to preserve the identity and established\r\nindividuality of their character, that the preamble to this\r\nConstitution, not content, simply, with declaring that it is \"we the\r\npeople of the United States,\" who enter into this compact, adds that it\r\nis for \"the United States of America.\" Concerning the territory\r\ncontemplated by the people of the United States, in these general terms,\r\nthere can be no dispute; it is settled by the treaty of peace, and\r\nincluded within the Atlantic Ocean, the St. Croix, the lakes, and more\r\nprecisely, so far as relates to the frontier, having relation to the\r\npresent argument, within \"a line to be drawn through the middle of the\r\nriver Mississippi, until it intersect the northernmost part of the\r\nthirty-first degree of north latitude, thence within a line drawn due\r\neast on this degree of latitude to the river Apalachicola, thence along\r\nthe middle of this river to its junction with the Flint River, thence\r\nstraight to the head of the St. Mary's River, and thence down the St.\r\nMary's to the Atlantic Ocean.\"\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular to draw the minds of gentlemen, distinctly,\r\nto the meaning of the terms used in the preamble; to the extent which\r\n\"the United States\" then included; and to the fact, that neither New\r\nOrleans, nor Louisiana, was within the comprehension of the terms of\r\nthis instrument. It is sufficient for the present branch of my argument\r\nto say, that there is nothing, in the general nature of this compact,\r\nfrom which the power, contemplated to be exercised in this bill,\r\nresults. On the contrary, as the introduction of a new associate in\r\npolitical power implies, necessarily, a new division of power, and\r\nconsequent diminution of the relative proportion of the former\r\nproprietors of it, there can, certainly, be nothing more obvious, than\r\nthat from the general nature of the instrument no power can result to\r\ndiminish and give away, to strangers, any proportion of the rights of\r\nthe original partners. If such a power exist, it must be found, then, in\r\nthe particular provisions in the Constitution. The question now arising\r\nis, in which of these provisions is given the power to admit new States,\r\nto be created in territories beyond the limits of the old United States.\r\nIf it exist anywhere, it is either in the third section of the fourth\r\narticle of the Constitution, or in the treaty-making power. If it result\r\nfrom neither of these, it is not pretended to be found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThat part of the third section of the fourth article, on which the\r\nadvocates of this bill rely, is the following: \"New States may be\r\nadmitted by the Congress, into this Union; but no new State shall be\r\nformed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other State, nor any\r\nState be formed by the junction of two or more States, or parts of\r\nStates, without the consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned,\r\nas well as of the Congress.\"\r\n\r\nI know, Mr. Speaker, that the first clause of this paragraph has been\r\nread, with all the superciliousness of a grammarian's triumph--\"New\r\nStates may be admitted by the Congress into this Union,\"--accompanied\r\nwith this most consequential inquiry: \"Is not this a new State to be\r\nadmitted? And is there not here an express authority?\" I have no doubt\r\nthis is a full and satisfactory argument to every one who is content\r\nwith the mere colors and superficies of things. And if we were now at\r\nthe bar of some stall-fed justice, the inquiry would insure the victory\r\nto the maker of it, to the manifest delight of the constables and\r\nsuitors of his court. But, sir, we are now before the tribunal of the\r\nwhole American people; reasoning concerning their liberties, their\r\nrights, their Constitution. These are not to be made the victims of the\r\ninevitable obscurity of general terms; nor the sport of verbal\r\ncriticism. The question is concerning the intent of the American people,\r\nthe proprietors of the old United States, when they agreed to this\r\narticle. Dictionaries and spelling-books are here of no authority.\r\nNeither Johnson, nor Walker, nor Webster, nor Dilworth, has any voice in\r\nthis matter. Sir, the question concerns the proportion of power\r\nreserved, by this Constitution, to every State in this Union. Have the\r\nthree branches of this government a right, at will, to weaken and\r\nout-weigh the influence, respectively secured to each State in this\r\ncompact, by introducing, at pleasure, new partners, situate beyond the\r\nold limits of the United States? The question has not relation merely to\r\nNew Orleans. The great objection is to the principle of the bill. If\r\nthis principle be admitted, the whole space of Louisiana, greater, it is\r\nsaid, than the entire extent of the old United States, will be a mighty\r\ntheatre, in which this government assumes the right of exercising this\r\nunparalleled power. And it will be; there is no concealment, it is\r\nintended to be exercised. Nor will it stop until the very name and\r\nnature of the old partners be overwhelmed by new-corners into the\r\nconfederacy. Sir, the question goes to the very root of the power and\r\ninfluence of the present members of this Union. The real intent of this\r\narticle, is, therefore, an injury of most serious import; and is to be\r\nsettled only by a recurrence to the known history and known relations of\r\nthis people and their Constitution. These, I maintain, support this\r\nposition, that the terms \"new States,\" in this article, do not intend\r\nnew political sovereignties, with territorial annexations, to be created\r\nwithout the original limits of the United States. * * *\r\n\r\nBut there is an argument stronger even than all those which have been\r\nproduced, to be drawn from the nature of the power here proposed to be\r\nexercised. Is it possible that such a power, if it had been intended to\r\nbe given by the people, should be left dependent upon the effect of\r\ngeneral expressions, and such, too, as were obviously applicable to\r\nanother subject, to a particular exigency contemplated at that time?\r\nSir, what is this power we propose now to usurp? Nothing less than a\r\npower changing all the proportions of the weight and influence possessed\r\nby the potent sovereignties composing this Union. A stranger is to be\r\nintroduced to an equal share without their consent. Upon a principle\r\npretended to be deduced from the Constitution, this government, after\r\nthis bill passes, may and will multiply foreign partners in power at its\r\nown mere motion; at its irresponsible pleasure; in other words, as local\r\ninterests, party passions, or ambitious views may suggest. It is a power\r\nthat from its nature never could be delegated; never was delegated; and\r\nas it breaks down all the proportions of power guaranteed by the\r\nConstitution to the States, upon which their essential security depends,\r\nutterly annihilates the moral force of this political conduct. Would\r\nthis people, so wisely vigilant concerning their rights, have\r\ntransferred to Congress a power to balance, at its will, the political\r\nweight of any one State, much more of all the States, by authorizing it\r\nto create new States, at its pleasure, in foreign countries, not\r\npretended to be within the scope of the Constitution, or the conception\r\nof the people at the time of passing it? This is not so much a question\r\nconcerning the exercise of sovereignty, as it is who shall be\r\nsovereign--whether the proprietors of the good old United States shall\r\nmanage their own affairs in their own way; or whether they, and their\r\nConstitution, and their political rights, shall be trampled under foot\r\nby foreigners, introduced through a breach of the Constitution. The\r\nproportion of the political weight of each sovereign State constituting\r\nthis Union depends upon the number of the States which have voice under\r\nthe compact. This number the Constitution permits us to multiply at\r\npleasure within the limits of the original United States, observing only\r\nthe expressed limitations in the Constitution. But when, in order to\r\nincrease your power of augmenting this number, you pass the old limits,\r\nyou are guilty of a violation of the Constitution in a fundamental\r\npoint; and in one, also, which is totally inconsistent with the intent\r\nof the contract and the safety of the States which established the\r\nassociation. What is the practical difference to the old partners\r\nwhether they hold their liberties at the will of a master, or whether by\r\nadmitting exterior States on an equal footing with the original States,\r\narbiters are constituted, who, by availing themselves of the contrariety\r\nof interests and views, which in such a confederacy necessarily will\r\narise, hold the balance among the parties which exist and govern us by\r\nthrowing themselves into the scale most comformable to their purpose? In\r\nboth cases there is an effective despotism. But the last is the more\r\ngalling, as we carry the chain in the name and gait of freemen.\r\n\r\nI have thus shown, and whether fairly, I am willing to be judged by the\r\nsound discretion of the American people, that the power proposed to be\r\nusurped in this bill, results neither from the general nature nor the\r\nparticular provisions of the Federal Constitution; and that it is a\r\npalpable violation of it in a fundamental point; whence flow all the\r\nconsequences I have indicated.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" says the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rhea), \"these people have\r\nbeen seven years citizens of the United States.\" I deny it, sir. As\r\ncitizens of New Orleans, or of Louisiana, they never have been, and by\r\nthe mode proposed they never will be, citizens of the United States.\r\nThey may girt upon us for a moment, but no real cement can grow from\r\nsuch an association. What the real situation of the inhabitants of those\r\nforeign countries is, I shall have occasion to show presently. \"But,\"\r\nsays the same gentleman: \"if I have a farm, have not I a right to\r\npurchase another farm, in my neighborhood, and settle my sons upon it,\r\nand in time admit them to a share in the management of my household?\"\r\nDoubtless, sir. But are these cases parallel? Are the three branches of\r\nthis government owners of this farm, called the United States? I desire\r\nto thank heaven they are not. I hold my life, liberty, and property, and\r\nthe people of the State from which I have the honor to be a\r\nrepresentative hold theirs, by a better tenure than any this National\r\nGovernment can give. Sir, I know your virtue. And I thank the Great\r\nGiver of every good gift, that neither the gentleman from Tennessee, nor\r\nhis comrades, nor any, nor all the members of this House, nor of the\r\nother branch of the Legislature, nor the good gentleman who lives in the\r\npalace yonder, nor all combined, can touch these my essential rights,\r\nand those of my friends and constituents, except in a limited and\r\nprescribed form. No, sir. We hold these by the laws, customs, and\r\nprinciples of the commonwealth of Massachusetts. Behind her ample\r\nshield, we find refuge, and feel safety. I beg gentlemen not to act upon\r\nthe principle, that the commonwealth of Massachusetts is their farm.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" the gentleman adds, \"what shall we do, if we do not admit the\r\npeople of Louisiana into our Union? Our children are settling that\r\ncountry.\" Sir, it is no concern of mine what he does. Because his\r\nchildren have run wild and uncovered into the woods, is that a reason\r\nfor him to break into my house, or the houses of my friends, to filch\r\nour children's clothes, in order to cover his children's nakedness. This\r\nConstitution never was, and never can be, strained to lap over all the\r\nwilderness of the West, without essentially affecting both the rights\r\nand convenience of its real proprietors. It was never constructed to\r\nform a covering for the inhabitants of the Missouri and Red River\r\ncountry. And whenever it is attempted to be stretched over them, it will\r\nrend asunder. I have done with this part of my argument. It rests upon\r\nthis fundamental principle, that the proportion of political power,\r\nsubject only to internal modifications, permitted by the Constitution,\r\nis an unalienable, essential, intangible right. When it is touched, the\r\nfabric is annihilated; for, on the preservation of these proportions,\r\ndepend our rights and liberties.\r\n\r\nIf we recur to the known relations existing among the States at the time\r\nof the adoption of this Constitution, the same conclusions will result.\r\nThe various interests, habits, manners, prejudices, education,\r\nsituation, and views, which excited jealousies and anxieties in the\r\nbreasts of some of our most distinguished citizens, touching the result\r\nof the proposed Constitution, were potent obstacles to its adoption. The\r\nimmortal leader of our Revolution, in his letter to the President of the\r\nold Congress, written as president of the convention which formed this\r\ncompact, thus speaks on this subject: \"It is at all times difficult to\r\ndraw, with precision, the line between those rights which must be\r\nsurrendered, and those which may be reserved; and on the present\r\noccasion this difficulty was increased by a difference among the several\r\nStates, as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular\r\ninterests.\"\r\n\r\nThe debates of that period will show that the effect of the slave votes\r\nupon the political influence of this part of the country, and the\r\nanticipated variation of the weight of power to the West, were subjects\r\nof great and just jealousy to some of the best patriots in the Northern\r\nand Eastern States. Suppose, then, that it had been distinctly foreseen\r\nthat, in addition to the effect of this weight, the whole population of\r\na world beyond the Mississippi was to be brought into this and the other\r\nbranch of the Legislature, to form our laws, control our rights, and\r\ndecide our destiny. Sir, can it be pretended that the patriots of that\r\nday would for one moment have listened to it? They were not madmen. They\r\nhad not taken degrees at the hospital of idiocy. They knew the nature of\r\nman, and the effect of his combinations in political societies. They\r\nknew that when the weight of particular sections of a confederacy was\r\ngreatly unequal, the resulting power would be abused; that it was not in\r\nthe nature of man to exercise it with moderation. The very extravagance\r\nof the intended use is a conclusive evidence against the possibility of\r\nthe grant of such a power as is here proposed. Why, sir, I have already\r\nheard of six States, and some say there will be, at no great distance of\r\ntime, more. I have also heard that the mouth of the Ohio will be far to\r\nthe east of the centre of the contemplated empire. If the bill is\r\npassed, the principle is recognized. All the rest are mere questions of\r\nexpediency. It is impossible such a power could be granted. It was not\r\nfor these men that our fathers fought. It was not for them this\r\nConstitution was adopted. You have no authority to throw the rights and\r\nliberties and property of this people into \"hotch-pot\" with the wild men\r\non the Missouri, nor with the mixed, though more respectable, race of\r\nAnglo-Hispano-Gallo-Americans, who bask on the sands in the mouth of the\r\nMississippi. I make no objection to these from their want of moral\r\nqualities or political light. The inhabitants of New Orleans are, I\r\nsuppose, like those of all other countries, some good, some bad, some\r\nindifferent.* * *\r\n\r\nI will add only a few words, in relation to the moral and political\r\nconsequences of usurping this power. I have said that it would be a\r\nvirtual dissolution of the Union; and gentlemen express great\r\nsensibility at the expression. But the true source of terror is not the\r\ndeclaration I have made, but the deed you propose. Is there a moral\r\nprinciple of public law better settled, or more conformable to the\r\nplainest suggestions of reason, than that the violation of a contract by\r\none of the parties may be considered as exempting the other from its\r\nobligations? Suppose, in private life, thirteen form a partnership, and\r\nten of them undertake to admit a new partner without the concurrence of\r\nthe other three, would it not be at their option to abandon the\r\npartnership, after so palpable an infringement of their rights? How much\r\nmore, in the political partnership, where the admission of new\r\nassociates, without previous authority, is so pregnant with obvious\r\ndangers and evils! Again, it is settled as a principle of morality,\r\namong writers on public law, that no person can be obliged, beyond his\r\nintent at the time of contract. Now who believes, who dare assert, that\r\nit was the intention of the people, when they adopted this Constitution,\r\nto assign, eventually, to New Orleans and Louisiana, a portion of their\r\npolitical power; and to invest all the people those extensive regions\r\nmight hereafter contain, with an authority over themselves and their\r\ndescendants? When you throw the weight of Louisiana into the scale, you\r\ndestroy the political equipoise contemplated at the time of forming the\r\ncontract. Can any man venture to affirm that the people did intend such\r\na comprehension as you now, by construction, give it? Or can it be\r\nconcealed that, beyond its fair and acknowledged intent, such a compact\r\nhas no moral force? If gentlemen are so alarmed at the bare mention of\r\nthe consequences, let them abandon a measure which, sooner or later,\r\nwill produce them. How long before the seeds of discontent will ripen,\r\nno man can foretell. But it is the part of wisdom not to multiply or\r\nscatter them. Do you suppose the people of the Northern and Atlantic\r\nStates will, or ought to, look on with patience and see Representatives\r\nand Senators, from the Red River and Missouri, pouring themselves upon\r\nthis and the other floor, managing the concerns of a sea-board fifteen\r\nhundred miles, at least, from their residence; and having a\r\npreponderancy in councils, into which, constitutionally, they could\r\nnever have been admitted? I have no hesitation upon this point. They\r\nneither will see it, nor ought to see it, with content. It is the part\r\nof a wise man to foresee danger and to hide himself. This great\r\nusurpation, which creeps into this House, under the plausible appearance\r\nof giving content to that important point, New Orleans, starts up a\r\ngigantic power to control the nation. Upon the actual condition of\r\nthings, there is, there can be, no need of concealment. It is apparent\r\nto the blindest vision. By the course of nature, and conformable to the\r\nacknowledged principles of the Constitution, the sceptre of power, in\r\nthis country, is passing toward the Northwest. Sir, there is to this no\r\nobjection. The right belongs to that quarter of the country. Enjoy it;\r\nit is yours. Use the powers granted as you please. But take care, in\r\nyour haste after effectual dominion, not to overload the scale by\r\nheaping it with these new acquisitions. Grasp not too eagerly at your\r\npurpose. In your speed after uncontrolled sway, trample not down this\r\nConstitution. * * *\r\n\r\nNew States are intended to be formed beyond the Mississippi. There is no\r\nlimit to men's imaginations, on this subject, short of California and\r\nColumbia River. When I said that the bill would justify a revolution and\r\nwould produce it, I spoke of its principle and its practical\r\nconsequences. To this principle and those consequences I would call the\r\nattention of this House and nation. If it be about to introduce a\r\ncondition of things absolutely insupportable, it becomes wise and honest\r\nmen to anticipate the evil, and to warn and prepare the people against\r\nthe event. I have no hesitation on the subject. The extension of this\r\nprinciple to the States contemplated beyond the Mississippi, cannot,\r\nwill not, and ought not to be borne. And the sooner the people\r\ncontemplate the unavoidable result the better; the more hope that the\r\nevils may be palliated or removed.\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, what is this liberty of which so much is said? Is it to\r\nwalk about this earth, to breathe this air, to partake the common\r\nblessings of God's providence? The beasts of the field and the birds of\r\nthe air unite with us in such privileges as these. But man boasts a\r\npurer and more ethereal temperature. His mind grasps in its view the\r\npast and future, as well as the present. We live not for ourselves\r\nalone. That which we call liberty is that principle on which the\r\nessential security of our political condition depends. It results from\r\nthe limitations of our political system, prescribed in the Constitution.\r\nThese limitations, so long as they are faithfully observed, maintain\r\norder, peace, and safety. When they are violated, in essential\r\nparticulars, all the concurrent spheres of authority rush against each\r\nother; and disorder, derangement, and convulsion are, sooner or later,\r\nthe necessary consequences.\r\n\r\nWith respect to this love of our Union, concerning which so much\r\nsensibility is expressed, I have no fears about analyzing its nature.\r\nThere is in it nothing of mystery. It depends upon the qualities of that\r\nUnion, and it results from its effects upon our and our country's\r\nhappiness. It is valued for \"that sober certainty of waking bliss\" which\r\nit enables us to realize. It grows out of the affections, and has not,\r\nand cannot be made to have, any thing universal in its nature. Sir, I\r\nconfess it: the first public love of my heart is the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts. There is my fireside; there are the tombs of my ancestors.\r\n\r\n  \"Low lies that land, yet blest with fruitful stores,\r\n   Strong are her sons, though rocky are her shores;\r\n   And none, ah! none, so lovely to my sight,\r\n   Of all the lands which heaven o'erspreads with light.\"\r\n\r\nThe love of this Union grows out of this attachment to my native soil,\r\nand is rooted in it. I cherish it, because it affords the best external\r\nhope of her peace, her prosperity, her independence. I oppose this bill\r\nfrom no animosity to the people of New Orleans; but from the deep\r\nconviction that it contains a principle incompatible with the liberties\r\nand safety of my country. I have no concealment of my opinion. The bill,\r\nif it passes, is a death-blow to the Constitution. It may, afterward,\r\nlinger; but, lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be\r\nconsummated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY\r\n\r\n\r\n--OF KENTUCKY. (BORN 1777, DIED 1852.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE WAR OF 1812--HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, JAN. 8, 1813.\r\n\r\nSIR, gentlemen appear to me to forget that they stand on American soil;\r\nthat they are not in the British House of Commons, but in the chamber of\r\nthe House of Representatives of the United States; that we have nothing\r\nto do with the affairs of Europe, the partition of territory and\r\nsovereignty there, except so far as these things affect the interests of\r\nour own country. Gentlemen transform themselves into the Burkes,\r\nChathams, and Pitts of another country, and, forgetting, from honest\r\nzeal, the interests of America, engage with European sensibility in the\r\ndiscussion of European interests. If gentlemen ask me whether I do not\r\nview with regret and horror the concentration of such vast power in the\r\nhands of Bonaparte, I reply that I do. I regret to see the Emperor of\r\nChina holding such immense sway over the fortunes of millions of our\r\nspecies. I regret to see Great Britain possessing so uncontrolled a\r\ncommand over all the waters of the globe. If I had the ability to\r\ndistribute among the nations of Europe their several portions of power\r\nand of sovereignty, I would say that Holland should be resuscitated and\r\ngiven the weight she enjoyed in the days of her De Witts. I would\r\nconfine France within her natural boundaries, the Alps, Pyrenees, and\r\nthe Rhine, and make her a secondary naval power only. I would abridge\r\nthe British maritime power, raise Prussia and Austria to their original\r\ncondition, and preserve the integrity of the Empire of Russia. But these\r\nare speculations. I look at the political transactions of Europe, with\r\nthe single exception of their possible bearing upon us, as I do at the\r\nhistory of other countries and other times. I do not survey them with\r\nhalf the interest that I do the movements in South America. Our\r\npolitical relation with them is much less important than it is supposed\r\nto be. I have no fears of French or English subjugation. If we are\r\nunited we are too powerful for the mightiest nation in Europe or all\r\nEurope combined. If we are separated and torn asunder, we shall become\r\nan easy prey to the weakest of them. In the latter dreadful contingency\r\nour country will not be worth preserving.\r\n\r\nNext to the notice which the opposition has found itself called upon to\r\nbestow upon the French Emperor, a distinguished citizen of Virginia,\r\nformerly President of the United States, has never for a moment failed\r\nto receive their kindest and most respectful attention. An honorable\r\ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Quincy), of whom I am sorry to say it\r\nbecomes necessary for me, in the course of my remarks, to take some\r\nnotice, has alluded to him in a remarkable manner. Neither his\r\nretirement from public office, his eminent services, nor his advanced\r\nage, can exempt this patriot from the coarse assaults of party\r\nmalevolence. No, sir. In 1801 he snatched from the rude hand of\r\nusurpation the violated Constitution of his country, and that is his\r\ncrime. He preserved that instrument, in form, and substance, and spirit,\r\na precious inheritance for generations to come, and for this he can\r\nnever be forgiven. How vain and impotent is party rage, directed against\r\nsuch a man. He is not more elevated by his lofty residence, upon the\r\nsummit of his own favorite mountain, than he is lifted, by the serenity\r\nof his mind, and the consciousness of a well-spent life, above the\r\nmalignant passions and bitter feelings of the day. No! his own beloved\r\nMonticello is not less moved by the storms that beat against its sides\r\nthan is this illustrious man by the howlings of the whole British pack,\r\nset loose from the Essex kennel. When the gentleman to whom I have been\r\ncompelled to allude shall have mingled his dust with that of his abused\r\nancestors, when he shall have been consigned to oblivion, or, if he\r\nlives at all, shall live only in the treasonable annals of a certain\r\njunto, the name of Jefferson will be hailed with gratitude, his memory\r\nhonored and cherished as the second founder of the liberties of the\r\npeople, and the period of his administration will be looked back to as\r\none of the happiest and brightest epochs of American history; an oasis\r\nin the midst of a sandy desert. But I beg the gentleman's pardon; he has\r\nalready secured to himself a more imperishable fame than I had supposed;\r\nI think it was about four years that he submitted to the House of\r\nRepresentatives an initiative proposition for the impeachment of Mr.\r\nJefferson. The house condescended to consider it. The gentleman debated\r\nit with his usual temper, moderation, and urbanity. The house decided\r\nupon it in the most solemn manner, and, although the gentleman had\r\nsomehow obtained a second, the final vote stood one for, and one hundred\r\nand seventeen against, the proposition. * * *\r\n\r\nBut sir, I must speak of another subject, which I never think of but\r\nwith feelings of the deepest awe. The gentleman from Massachusetts, in\r\nimitation of some of his predecessors of 1799, has entertained us with a\r\npicture of cabinet plots, presidential plots, and all sorts of plots,\r\nwhich have been engendered by the diseased state of the gentleman's\r\nimagination. I wish, sir, that another plot, of a much more serious and\r\nalarming character--a plot that aims at the dismemberment of our\r\nUnion--had only the same imaginary existence. But no man, who has paid\r\nany attention to the tone of certain prints and to transactions in a\r\nparticular quarter of the Union, for several years past, can doubt the\r\nexistence of such a plot. It was far, very far from my intention to\r\ncharge the opposition with such a design. No, I believe them generally\r\nincapable of it. But I cannot say as much for some who have been\r\nunworthily associated with them in the quarter of the Union to which I\r\nhave referred. The gentleman cannot have forgotten his own sentiment,\r\nuttered even on the floor of this house, \"peaceably if we can, forcibly\r\nif we must,\" nearly at the very time Henry's mission was undertaken. The\r\nflagitiousness of that embassy had been attempted to be concealed by\r\ndirecting the public attention to the price which, the gentleman says,\r\nwas given for the disclosure. As if any price could change the\r\natrociousness of the attempt on the part of Great Britain, or could\r\nextenuate, in the slightest degree, the offence of those citizens, who\r\nentertained and deliberated on a proposition so infamous and unnatural *\r\n* * But, sir, I will quit this unpleasant subject. * * *\r\n\r\nThe war was declared because Great Britain arrogated to herself the\r\npretension of regulating our foreign trade, under the delusive name of\r\nretaliatory orders in council--a pretension by which she undertook to\r\nproclaim to American enterprise, \"thus far shalt thou go, and no\r\nfurther\"--orders which she refused to revoke after the alleged cause of\r\ntheir enactment had ceased; because she persisted in the practice of\r\nimpressing American seamen; because she had instigated the Indians to\r\ncommit hostilities against us; and because she refused indemnity for her\r\npast injuries upon our commerce. I throw out of the question other\r\nwrongs. So undeniable were the causes of the war, so powerfully did they\r\naddress themselves to the feelings of the whole American people, that\r\nwhen the bill was pending before this House, gentlemen in the\r\nopposition, although provoked to debate, would not, or could not, utter\r\none syllable against it. It is true, they wrapped themselves up in\r\nsullen silence, pretending they did not choose to debate such a question\r\nin secret session. While speaking of the proceedings on that occasion I\r\nbeg to be permitted to advert to another fact which transpired--an\r\nimportant fact, material for the nation to know, and which I have often\r\nregretted had not been spread upon our journals. My honorable colleague\r\n(Mr. McKee) moved, in committee of the whole, to comprehend France in\r\nthe war; and when the question was taken upon the proposition, there\r\nappeared but ten votes in support of it, of whom seven belonged to this\r\nside of the house, and three only to the other. * * *\r\n\r\nIt is not to the British principle (of allegiance), objectionable as it\r\nis, that we are alone to look; it is to her practice, no matter what\r\nguise she puts on. It is in vain to assert the inviolability of the\r\nobligation of allegiance. It is in vain to set up the plea of necessity,\r\nand to allege that she cannot exist without the impressment of HER\r\nseamen. The naked truth is, she comes, by her press-gangs, on board of\r\nour vessels, seizes OUR native as well as naturalized seamen, and drags\r\nthem into her service. It is the case, then, of the assertion of an\r\nerroneous principle, and of a practice not conformable to the asserted\r\nprinciple--a principle which, if it were theoretically right, must be\r\nforever practically wrong--a practice which can obtain countenance from\r\nno principle whatever, and to submit to which, on our part, would betray\r\nthe most abject degradation. We are told, by gentlemen in the\r\nopposition, that government has not done all that was incumbent on it to\r\ndo, to avoid just cause of complaint on the part of Great Britain; that\r\nin particular the certificates of protection, authorized by the act of\r\n1796, are fraudulently used. Sir, government has done too much in\r\ngranting those paper protections. I can never think of them without\r\nbeing shocked. They resemble the passes which the master grants to his\r\nnegro slave: \"Let the bearer, Mungo, pass and repass without\r\nmolestation.\" What do they imply? That Great Britain has a right to\r\nseize all who are not provided with them. From their very nature, they\r\nmust be liable to abuse on both sides. If Great Britain desires a mark,\r\nby which she can know her own subjects, let her give them an ear-mark.\r\nThe colors that float from the mast-head should be the credentials of\r\nour seamen. There is no safety to us, and the gentlemen have shown it,\r\nbut in the rule that all who sail under the flag (not being enemies),\r\nare protected by the flag. It is impossible that this country should\r\never abandon the gallant tars who have won for us such splendid\r\ntrophies. Let me suppose that the genius of Columbia should visit one of\r\nthem in his oppressor's prison, and attempt to reconcile him to his\r\nforlorn and wretched condition. She would say to him, in the language of\r\ngentlemen on the other side: \"Great Britain intends you no harm; she did\r\nnot mean to impress you, but one of her own subjects; having taken you\r\nby mistake, I will remonstrate, and try to prevail upon her, by\r\npeaceable means, to release you; but I cannot, my son, fight for you.\"\r\nIf he did not consider this mere mockery, the poor tar would address her\r\njudgment and say: \"You owe me, my country, protection; I owe you, in\r\nreturn, obedience. I am no British subject; I am a native of old\r\nMassachusetts, where lived my aged father, my wife, my children. I have\r\nfaithfully discharged my duty. Will you refuse to do yours?\" Appealing\r\nto her passions, he would continue: \"I lost this eye in fighting under\r\nTruxton, with the Insurgence; I got this scar before Tripoli; I broke\r\nthis leg on board the Constitution, when the Guerriere struck.\" * * * I\r\nwill not imagine the dreadful catastrophe to which he would be driven by\r\nan abandonment of him to his oppressor. It will not be, it cannot be,\r\nthat his country will refuse him protection. * * *\r\n\r\nAn honorable peace is attainable only by an efficient war. My plan would\r\nbe to call out the ample resources of the country, give them a judicious\r\ndirection, prosecute the war with the utmost vigor, strike wherever we\r\ncan reach the enemy, at sea or on land, and negotiate the terms of a\r\npeace at Quebec or at Halifax. We are told that England is a proud and\r\nlofty nation, which, disdaining to wait for danger, meets it half way.\r\nHaughty as she is we triumphed over her once, and, if we do not listen\r\nto the counsels of timidity and despair, we shall again prevail. In such\r\na cause, with the aid of Providence, we must come out crowned with\r\nsuccess; but, if we fail, let us fail like men, lash ourselves to our\r\ngallant tars, and expire together in one common struggle, fighting for\r\nFREE TRADE AND SEAMEN'S RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. -- THE RISE OF NATIONALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of execrable financial management, of the criminal blunders of\r\npolitical army officers, and of consequent defeats on land, and quite\r\napart from brilliant sea-fights and the New Orleans victory, the war of\r\n1812 was of incalculable benefit to the United States. It marks more\r\nparticularly the point at which the already established democracy began\r\nto shade off into a real nationality.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party began its career as a States-rights party.\r\nPossession of national power had so far modified the practical operation\r\nof its tenets that it had not hesitated to carry out a national policy,\r\nand even wage a desperate war, in flat opposition to the will of one\r\nsection of the Union, comprising five of its most influential States;\r\nand, when the Hartford Convention was suspected of a design to put the\r\nNew England opposition to the war into a forcible veto, there were many\r\nindications that the dominant party was fully prepared to answer by a\r\nforcible materialization of the national will. In the North and West, at\r\nleast, the old States-rights formulas never carried a real vitality\r\nbeyond the war of 1812. Men still spoke of \"sovereign States,\" and\r\nprided themselves on the difference between the \"voluntary union of\r\nStates\" and the effete despotisms of Europe; but the ghost of the\r\nHartford Convention had laid very many more dangerous ghosts in the\r\nsection in which it had appeared.\r\n\r\nThe theatre of the war, now filled with comfortable farms and populous\r\ncities, was then less known than any of our Territories in 1896. There\r\nwere no roads, and the transportation of provisions for the troops, of\r\nguns, ammunition, and stores for the lake navies, was one of the most\r\ndifficult of the problems which the National Government was called upon\r\nto solve. It cannot be said that the solution was successfully reached,\r\nfor the blunders in transportation were among the most costly,\r\nexasperating, and dangerous of the war. But the efforts to reach it\r\nprovided the impulse which soon after resulted in the settlement of\r\nWestern New York, the appearance of the germs of such flourishing cities\r\nas Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse, the opening up of the Southwest\r\nTerritory, between Tennessee and New Orleans, and the rapid admission of\r\nthe new States of Indiana, Illinois, Mississippi, and Missouri. But the\r\nimpulse did not stop here. The inconveniences and dangers arising from\r\nthe possession of a vast territory with utterly inadequate means of\r\ncommunication had been brought so plainly to public view by the war that\r\nthe question of communication influenced politics in every direction. In\r\nNew York it took shape in the construction of the Erie Canal (finished\r\nin 1825). In States farther west and south, the loaning of the public\r\ncredit to enterprises of the nature of the Erie Canal increased until\r\nthe panic of 1837 introduced \"repudiation\" into American politics. In\r\nnational politics, the necessity of a general system of canals and\r\nroads, as a means of military defence, was at first admitted by all,\r\neven by Calhoun, was gradually rejected by the stricter constructionists\r\nof the Constitution, and finally became a tenet of the National\r\nRepublican party, headed by John Quincy Adams and Clay (1825-29), and of\r\nits greater successor the Whig party, headed by Clay. This idea of\r\nInternal Improvements at national expense, though suggested by Gallatin\r\nand Clay in 1806-08, only became a political question when the war had\r\nforced it upon public attention; and it has not yet entirely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of such a system required money, and a high tariff of\r\nduties on imports was a necessary concomitant to Internal Improvements.\r\nThe germ of this system was also a product of the war of 1812. Hamilton\r\nhad proposed it twenty years before; and the first American tariff act\r\nhad declared that its object was the encouragement of American\r\nmanufactures. But the system had never been effectively introduced until\r\nthe war and the blockade had forced American manufactures into\r\nexistence. Peace brought competition with British manufacturers, and the\r\nAmerican manufacturers began to call for protection. The tariff of 1816\r\ncontained the principle of Protection, but only carried it into practice\r\nfar enough to induce the manufacturers to rely on the dominant party for\r\nmore of it. This expectation, rather than the Federalist opposition to\r\nthe war, is the explanation of the immediate and rapid decline of the\r\nFederal party in New England. Continued effort brought about the tariff\r\nof 1824, which was more protective; the tariff of 1828, which was still\r\nmore protective; and the tariff of 1830, which reduced the protective\r\nelement to a system.\r\n\r\nThe two sections, North and South, had been very much alike until the\r\nwar called the principle of growth into activity. The slave system of\r\nlabor, which had fallen in the North and had survived and been made\r\nstill more profitable in the South by Whitney's invention of the cotton\r\ngin in 1793, shut the South off from almost all share in the new life.\r\nThat section had a monopoly of the cotton culture, and the present\r\nprofit of slave labor blinded it to the ultimate consequences of it. The\r\nslave was fit for rude agriculture alone; he could not be employed in\r\nmanufactures, or in any labor which required intelligence; and the\r\nslave-owner, while he desired manufactures, did not dare to cultivate\r\nthe necessary intelligence in his own slaves. The South could therefore\r\nfind no profit in protection, and yet it could not with dignity admit\r\nthat its slave system precluded it from the advantages of protection, or\r\nbase its opposition to protection wholly on economic grounds. Its only\r\nrecourse was the constitutional ground of the lack of power of Congress\r\nto pass a protective tariff, and this brought up again the question\r\nwhich had evolved the Kentucky resolutions of 1798-9. Calhoun, with\r\npitiless logic, developed them into a scheme of constitutional\r\nNullification. Under his lead,\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, in 1832, declared through her State Convention that the\r\nprotective tariff acts were no law, nor binding on the State, its\r\nofficers or citizens. President Jackson, while he was ready and willing\r\nto suppress any such rebellion by force, was not sorry to see his\r\nadherents in Congress make use of it to overthrow protection; and a\r\n\"compromise tariff,\" to which the protectionists agreed, was passed in\r\n1833. It reduced the duties by an annual percentage for ten years. The\r\nnullifiers claimed this as a triumph, and formally repealed the\r\nordinance of nullification, as if it had accomplished its object. But,\r\nin its real intent, it had failed wretchedly. It had asserted State\r\nsovereignty through the State's proper voice of a convention. When the\r\ntime fixed for the execution of the ordinance arrived, Jackson's\r\nintention of taking the State's sovereignty by the throat had become so\r\nevident that an unofficial meeting of nullifiers suspended the ordinance\r\nuntil the passage of the compromise tariff had made it unnecessary. For\r\nthe first time, the force of a State and the national force had\r\napproached threateningly near collision, and no State ever tried it\r\nagain. When the tariff of 1842 reintroduced the principle of protection,\r\nno one thought of taking the broken weapon of nullification from its\r\nresting-place; and secession was finally attempted only as a sectional\r\nmovement, not as the expression of the will of a State, but as a\r\nconcerted revolution by a number of States. It seems certain that\r\nnationality had attained force enough, even in 1833, to have put State\r\nsovereignty forever under its feet; and that but for the cohesive\r\nsectional force of slavery and its interests, the development of\r\nnationality would have been undisputed for the future.\r\n\r\nNew conditions were increasing the growth of the North and West, and\r\ntheir separation from the South in national life, even when\r\nnullification was in its death struggle. The acquisition of Louisiana in\r\n1803 had been followed in 1807 by Fulton's invention of the steamboat,\r\nthe most important factor in carrying immigration into the new\r\nterritories and opening them up to settlement. But the steamboat could\r\nnot quite bridge over the gap between the Alleghanies and the\r\nMississippi. Internal improvements, canals, and improved roads were not\r\nquite the instrument that was needed. It was found at last in the\r\nintroduction of the railway into the United States in 1830-32. This\r\nproved to be an agent which could solve every difficulty except its own.\r\nIt could bridge over every gap; it could make profit of its own, and\r\nmake profitable that which had before been unprofitable. It placed\r\nimmigrants where the steamboat, canal, and road could at last be of the\r\nhighest utility to them; it developed the great West with startling\r\nrapidity; it increased the sale of government lands so rapidly that in a\r\nfew years the debt of the United States was paid off, and the surplus\r\nbecame, for the first time, a source of political embarrassment. In a\r\nfew years further, aided by revolutionary troubles in Europe,\r\nimmigration became a great stream, which poured into and altered the\r\nconditions of every part of the North and West. The stream was\r\naltogether nationalizing in its nature. The immigrant came to the United\r\nStates, not to a particular State. To him, the country was greater than\r\nany State; even that of his adoption. Labor conditions excluded the\r\nSouth from this element of progress also. Not only were the railroads of\r\nthe South hampered in every point by the old difficulty of slave labor;\r\nimmigration and free labor shunned slave soil as if the plague were\r\nthere prevalent. Year after year the North and West became more national\r\nin their prejudices and modes of thought and action; while the South\r\nremained little changed, except by a natural reactionary drift toward a\r\nmore extreme colonialism. The natural result, in the next period was the\r\ndevelopment of a quasi nationality in the South itself.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the railway had brought its own difficulties, though\r\nthese were not felt severely until after years. In the continent of\r\nEurope, the governments carefully retained their powers of eminent\r\ndomain when the new system was introduced. The necessary land was loaned\r\nto the railways for a term of years, at the expiration of which the\r\nrailway was to revert to the State; and railway troubles were\r\nnon-existent, or comparatively tractable. In the United States, as in\r\nGreat Britain, free right of incorporation was supplemented by what was\r\nreally a gift of the power of eminent domain. The necessary land became\r\nthe property of the corporations in fee, and it has been found almost\r\nequally difficult to revoke the gift or to introduce a railway control.\r\n\r\nDemocracy took a new and extreme line of development under its alliance\r\nwith nationality. As the dominant party, about 1827-8, became divided\r\ninto two parties, the new parties felt the democratic influence as\r\nneither of their predecessors had felt it. Nominations, which had been\r\nmade by cliques of legislators or Congressmen, began to be made by\r\npopular delegate conventions about 1825. Before 1835, national, State,\r\nand local conventions had been united into parties of the modern type.\r\nWith them came the pseudo-democratic idea of \"rotation in office,\"\r\nintroduced into national politics by President Jackson, in 1829, and\r\nadopted by succeeding administrations. There were also some attempts to\r\ndo away with the electoral system, and to make the federal judiciary\r\nelective, or to impose on it some other term of office than good\r\nbehavior; but these had neither success nor encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe financial errors of the war of 1812 had fairly compelled the\r\nre-establishment of the Bank of the United States in 1816, with a\r\ncharter for twenty years, and the control of the deposits of national\r\nrevenue. Soon after Jackson's inauguration, the managers of the new\r\ndemocratic party came into collision with the bank on the appointment of\r\na subordinate agent. It very soon became evident that the bank could not\r\nexist in the new political atmosphere. It was driven into politics;\r\na new charter was vetoed in 1832; and after one of the bitterest\r\nstruggles of our history, the bank ceased to exist as a government\r\ninstitution in 1836. The reason for its fall, however disguised by\r\nattendant circumstances, was really its lack of harmony with the\r\nnational-democratic environment which had overtaken it. Benton's\r\nspeech presents a review of this bank struggle and of accompanying\r\npolitical controversies.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery agitation, which began in 1830, was as evidently a\r\nproduct of the new phase of democracy, but will fall more naturally\r\nunder the next period.\r\n\r\nWebster's reply to Hayne has been taken as the best illustration of that\r\nthoroughly national feeling which was impossible before the war of 1812,\r\nand increasingly more common after it. It has been necessary to preface\r\nit with Hayne's speech, in order to have a clear understanding of parts\r\nof Webster's; but it has not been possible to omit Calhoun's speech, as\r\na defence of his scheme of nullification, and as an exemplification of\r\nthe reaction toward colonialism with which the South met the national\r\ndevelopment. It has not seemed necessary to include other examples of\r\nthe orations called forth by the temporary political issues of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT Y. HAYNE,\r\n\r\n---OF SOUTH CAROLINA. (BORN 1791, DIED 1840.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON MR. FOOT'S RESOLUTION IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, JAN. 21, 1830\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SPEAKER:\r\n\r\nMr. Hayne said, when he took occasion, two days ago, to throw out some\r\nideas with respect to the policy of the government in relation to the\r\npublic lands, nothing certainly could have been further from his\r\nthoughts than that he should have been compelled again to throw himself\r\nupon the indulgence of the Senate. Little did I expect, said Mr. H., to\r\nbe called upon to meet such an argument as was yesterday urged by the\r\ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Webster). Sir, I question no man's\r\nopinions; I impeach no man's motives; I charged no party, or State, or\r\nsection of country with hostility to any other, but ventured, as I\r\nthought, in a becoming spirit, to put forth my own sentiments in\r\nrelation to a great national question of public policy. Such was my\r\ncourse. The gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Benton), it is true, had\r\ncharged upon the Eastern States an early and continued hostility toward\r\nthe West, and referred to a number of historical facts and documents in\r\nsupport of that charge. Now, sir, how have these different arguments\r\nbeen met? The honorable gentleman from Massachusetts, after deliberating\r\na whole night upon his course, comes into this chamber to vindicate New\r\nEngland; and instead of making up his issue with the gentleman from\r\nMissouri, on the charges which he had preferred, chooses to consider me\r\nas the author of those charges, and losing sight entirely of that\r\ngentleman, selects me as his adversary, and pours out all the vials of\r\nhis mighty wrath upon my devoted head. Nor is he willing to stop there.\r\nHe goes on to assail the institutions and policy of the South, and calls\r\nin question the principles and conduct of the State which I have the\r\nhonor to represent. When I find a gentleman of mature age and\r\nexperience, of acknowledged talents and profound sagacity, pursuing a\r\ncourse like this, declining the contest offered from the West, and\r\nmaking war upon the unoffending South, I must believe, I am bound to\r\nbelieve, he has some object in view which he has not ventured to\r\ndisclose. Mr. President, why is this? Has the gentleman discovered in\r\nformer controversies with the gentleman from Missouri, that he is\r\novermatched by that senator? And does he hope for an easy victory over a\r\nmore feeble adversary? Has the gentleman's distempered fancy been\r\ndisturbed by gloomy forebodings of \"new alliances to be formed,\" at\r\nwhich he hinted? Has the ghost of the murdered coalition come back, like\r\nthe ghost of Banquo, to \"sear the eyeballs\" of the gentleman, and will\r\nnot down at his bidding? Are dark visions of broken hopes, and honors\r\nlost forever, still floating before his heated imagination? Sir, if it\r\nbe his object to thrust me between the gentleman from Missouri and\r\nhimself, in order to rescue the East from the contest it has provoked\r\nwith the West, he shall not be gratified. Sir, I will not be dragged\r\ninto the defence of my friend from Missouri. The South shall not be\r\nforced into a conflict not its own. The gentleman from Missouri is able\r\nto fight his own battles. The gallant West needs no aid from the South\r\nto repel any attack which may be made upon them from any quarter. Let\r\nthe gentleman from Massachusetts controvert the facts and arguments of\r\nthe gentleman from Missouri, if he can--and if he win the victory, let\r\nhim wear the honors; I shall not deprive him of his laurels. * * *\r\n\r\nSir, any one acquainted with the history of parties in this country will\r\nrecognize in the points now in dispute between the Senator from\r\nMassachusetts and myself the very grounds which have, from the\r\nbeginning, divided the two great parties in this country, and which\r\n(call these parties by what names you will, and amalgamate them as you\r\nmay) will divide them forever. The true distinction between those\r\nparties is laid down in a celebrated manifesto issued by the convention\r\nof the Federalists of Massachusetts, assembled in Boston, in February,\r\n1824, on the occasion of organizing a party opposition to the reelection\r\nof Governor Eustis. The gentleman will recognize this as \"the canonical\r\nbook of political scripture\"; and it instructs us that, when the\r\nAmerican colonies redeemed themselves from British bondage, and became\r\nso many independent nations, they proposed to form a NATIONAL UNION (not\r\na Federal Union, sir, but a NATIONAL UNION).\r\n\r\nThose who were in favor of a union of the States in this form became\r\nknown by the name of Federalists; those who wanted no union of the\r\nStates, or disliked the proposed form of union, became known by the name\r\nof Anti-Federalists. By means which need not be enumerated, the\r\nAnti-Federalists became (after the expiration of twelve years) our\r\nnational rulers, and for a period of sixteen years, until the close of\r\nMr. Madison's administration in 1817, continued to exercise the\r\nexclusive direction of our public affairs. Here, sir, is the true\r\nhistory of the origin, rise, and progress of the party of National\r\nRepublicans, who date back to the very origin of the Government, and who\r\nthen, as now, chose to consider the Constitution as having created not a\r\nFederal, but a National, Union; who regarded \"consolidation\" as no evil,\r\nand who doubtless consider it \"a consummation to be wished\" to build up\r\na great \"central government,\" \"one and indivisible.\" Sir, there have\r\nexisted, in every age and every country, two distinct orders of men--the\r\nlovers of freedom and the devoted advocates of power.\r\n\r\nThe same great leading principles, modified only by the peculiarities of\r\nmanners, habits, and institutions, divided parties in the ancient\r\nrepublics, animated the Whigs and Tories of Great Britain, distinguished\r\nin our own times the Liberals and Ultras of France, and may be traced\r\neven in the bloody struggles of unhappy Spain. Sir, when the gallant\r\nRiego, who devoted himself and all that he possessed to the liberties of\r\nhis country, was dragged to the scaffold, followed by the tears and\r\nlamentations of every lover of freedom throughout the world, he perished\r\namid the deafening cries of \"Long live the absolute king!\" The people\r\nwhom I represent, Mr. President, are the descendants of those who\r\nbrought with them to this country, as the most precious of their\r\npossessions, \"an ardent love of liberty\"; and while that shall be\r\npreserved, they will always be found manfully struggling against the\r\nconsolidation of the Government AS THE WORST OF EVILS. * * *\r\n\r\nWho, then, Mr. President, are the true friends of the Union? Those who\r\nwould confine the Federal Government strictly within the limits\r\nprescribed by the Constitution; who would preserve to the States and the\r\npeople all powers not expressly delegated; who would make this a Federal\r\nand not a National Union, and who, administering the Government in a\r\nspirit of equal justice, would make it a blessing, and not a curse. And\r\nwho are its enemies? Those who are in favor of consolidation; who are\r\nconstantly stealing power from the States, and adding strength to the\r\nFederal Government; who, assuming an unwarrantable jurisdiction over the\r\nStates and the people, undertake to regulate the whole industry and\r\ncapital of the country. But, sir, of all descriptions of men, I consider\r\nthose as the worst enemies of the Union, who sacrifice the equal rights\r\nwhich belong to every member of the confederacy to combinations of\r\ninterested majorities for personal or political objects. But the\r\ngentleman apprehends no evil from the dependence of the States on the\r\nFederal Government; he can see no danger of corruption from the\r\ninfluence of money or patronage. Sir, I know that it is supposed to be a\r\nwise saying that \"patronage is a source of weakness\"; and in support of\r\nthat maxim it has been said that \"every ten appointments make a hundred\r\nenemies.\" But I am rather inclined to think, with the eloquent and\r\nsagacious orator now reposing on his laurels on the banks of the\r\nRoanoke, that \"the power of conferring favors creates a crowd of\r\ndependents\"; he gave a forcible illustration of the truth of the remark,\r\nwhen he told us of the effect of holding up the savory morsel to the\r\neager eyes of the hungry hounds gathered around his door. It mattered\r\nnot whether the gift was bestowed on \"Towzer\" or \"Sweetlips,\" \"Tray,\"\r\n\"Blanche,\" or \"Sweetheart\"; while held in suspense, they were all\r\ngoverned by a nod, and when the morsel was bestowed, the expectation of\r\nthe favors of to-morrow kept up the subjection of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Senator from Massachusetts, in denouncing what he is pleased to call\r\nthe Carolina doctrine, has attempted to throw ridicule upon the idea\r\nthat a State has any constitutional remedy by the exercise of its\r\nsovereign authority, against \"a gross, palpable, and deliberate\r\nviolation of the Constitution.\" He calls it \"an idle\" or \"a ridiculous\r\nnotion,\" or something to that effect, and added, that it would make the\r\nUnion a \"mere rope of sand.\" Now, sir, as the gentleman has not\r\ncondescended to enter into any examination of the question, and has been\r\nsatisfied with throwing the weight of his authority into the scale, I do\r\nnot deem it necessary to do more than to throw into the opposite scale\r\nthe authority on which South Carolina relies; and there, for the\r\npresent, I am perfectly willing to leave the controversy. The South\r\nCarolina doctrine, that is to say, the doctrine contained in an\r\nexposition reported by a committee of the Legislature in December, 1828,\r\nand published by their authority, is the good old Republican doctrine of\r\n'98--the doctrine of the celebrated \"Virginia Resolutions\" of that year,\r\nand of \"Madison's Report\" of '99. It will be recollected that the\r\nLegislature of Virginia, in December, '98, took into consideration the\r\nalien and sedition laws, then considered by all Republicans as a gross\r\nviolation of the Constitution of the United States, and on that day\r\npassed, among others, the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"The General Assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it\r\nviews the powers of the Federal Government, as resulting from the\r\ncompact to which the States are parties, as limited by the plain sense\r\nand intention of the instrument constituting that compact, as no further\r\nvalid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact;\r\nand that in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of\r\nother powers not granted by the said compact, the States who are the\r\nparties there-to have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for\r\narresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their\r\nrespective limits the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above resolution, the General Assembly of Virginia\r\n\"appealed to the other States, in the confidence that they would concur\r\nwith that commonwealth, that the acts aforesaid (the alien and sedition\r\nlaws) are unconstitutional, and that the necessary and proper measures\r\nwould be taken by each for cooperating with Virginia in maintaining\r\nunimpaired the authorities, rights, and liberties reserved to the States\r\nrespectively, or to the people.\" * * *\r\n\r\nBut, sir, our authorities do not stop here. The State of Kentucky\r\nresponded to Virginia, and on the 10th of November, 1798, adopted those\r\ncelebrated resolutions, well known to have been penned by the author of\r\nthe Declaration of American Independence. In those resolutions, the\r\nLegislature of Kentucky declare, \"that the government created by this\r\ncompact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the\r\npower delegated to itself, since that would have made its discretion,\r\nand not the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all\r\nother cases of compact among parties having no common judge, each party\r\nhas an equal right to judge for itself as well of infractions as of the\r\nmode and measure of redress.\" * * *\r\n\r\nSir, at that day the whole country was divided on this very question. It\r\nformed the line of demarcation between the federal and republican\r\nparties; and the great political revolution which then took place turned\r\nupon the very questions involved in these resolutions. That question was\r\ndecided by the people, and by that decision the Constitution was, in the\r\nemphatic language of Mr. Jefferson, \"saved at its last gasp.\" I should\r\nsuppose, sir, it would require more self-respect than any gentleman here\r\nwould be willing to assume, to treat lightly doctrines derived from such\r\nhigh sources. Resting on authority like this, I will ask, gentlemen,\r\nwhether South Carolina has not manifested a high regard for the Union,\r\nwhen, under a tyranny ten times more grievous than the alien and\r\nsedition laws, she has hitherto gone no further than to petition,\r\nremonstrate, and to solemnly protest against a series of measures which\r\nshe believes to be wholly unconstitutional and utterly destructive of\r\nher interests. Sir, South Carolina has not gone one step further than\r\nMr. Jefferson himself was disposed to go, in relation to the present\r\nsubject of our present complaints--not a step further than the statesmen\r\nfrom New England were disposed to go under similar circumstances; no\r\nfurther than the Senator from Massachusetts himself once considered as\r\nwithin \"the limits of a constitutional opposition.\" The doctrine that it\r\nis the right of a State to judge of the violations of the Constitution\r\non the part of the Federal Government, and to protect her citizens from\r\nthe operations of unconstitutional laws, was held by the enlightened\r\ncitizens of Boston, who assembled in Faneuil Hall, on the 25th of\r\nJanuary, 1809. They state, in that celebrated memorial, that \"they\r\nlooked only to the State Legislature, which was competent to devise\r\nrelief against the unconstitutional acts of the General Government. That\r\nyour power (say they) is adequate to that object, is evident from the\r\norganization of the confederacy.\" * * *\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen, Mr. President, that the South Carolina doctrine is\r\nthe Republican doctrine of '98,--that it was promulgated by the fathers\r\nof the faith,--that it was maintained by Virginia and Kentucky in the\r\nworst of times,--that it constituted the very pivot on which the\r\npolitical revolution of that day turned,--that it embraces the very\r\nprinciples, the triumph of which, at that time, saved the Constitution\r\nat its last gasp, and which New England statesmen were not unwilling to\r\nadopt when they believed themselves to be the victims of\r\nunconstitutional legislation. Sir, as to the doctrine that the Federal\r\nGovernment is the exclusive judge of the extent as well as the\r\nlimitations of its power, it seems to me to be utterly subversive of the\r\nsovereignty and independence of the States. It makes but little\r\ndifference, in my estimation, whether Congress or the Supreme Court are\r\ninvested with this power. If the Federal Government, in all, or any, of\r\nits departments, is to prescribe the limits of its own authority, and\r\nthe States are bound to submit to the decision, and are not to be\r\nallowed to examine and decide for themselves when the barriers of the\r\nConstitution shall be overleaped, this is practically \"a government\r\nwithout limitation of powers.\" The States are at once reduced to mere\r\npetty corporations, and the people are entirely at your mercy. I have\r\nbut one word more to add. In all the efforts that have been made by\r\nSouth Carolina to resist the unconstitutional laws which Congress has\r\nextended over them, she has kept steadily in view the preservation of\r\nthe Union, by the only means by which she believes it can be long\r\npreserved--a firm, manly, and steady resistance against usurpation. The\r\nmeasures of the Federal Government have, it is true, prostrated her\r\ninterests, and will soon involve the whole South in irretrievable ruin.\r\nBut even this evil, great as it is, is not the chief ground of our\r\ncomplaints. It is the principle involved in the contest--a principle\r\nwhich, substituting the discretion of Congress for the limitations of\r\nthe Constitution, brings the States and the people to the feet of the\r\nFederal Government, and leaves them nothing they can call their own.\r\nSir, if the measures of the Federal Government were less oppressive, we\r\nshould still strive against this usurpation. The South is acting on a\r\nprinciple she has always held sacred--resistance to unauthorized\r\ntaxation. These, sir, are the principles which induced the immortal\r\nHampden to resist the payment of a tax of twenty shillings. Would twenty\r\nshillings have ruined his fortune? No! but the payment of half of twenty\r\nshillings, on the principle on which it was demanded, would have made\r\nhim a slave. Sir, if acting on these high motives--if animated by that\r\nardent love of liberty which has always been the most prominent trait in\r\nthe Southern character, we would be hurried beyond the bounds of a cold\r\nand calculating prudence; who is there, with one noble and generous\r\nsentiment in his bosom, who would not be disposed, in the language of\r\nBurke, to exclaim, \"You must pardon something to the spirit of liberty?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n\r\n--OF MASSACHUSETTS. (BORN 1782, DIED 1852.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIN REPLY TO HAYNE, IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, JANUARY 26, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nWhen the mariner has been tossed for many days in thick weather, and on\r\nan unknown sea, he naturally avails himself of the first pause in the\r\nstorm, the earliest glance of the sun, to take his latitude, and\r\nascertain how far the elements have driven him from his true course. Let\r\nus imitate this prudence, and before we float further on the waves of\r\nthis debate, refer to the point from which we departed, that we may at\r\nleast be able to conjecture where we now are. I ask for the reading of\r\nthe resolution before the Senate.\r\n\r\n(The Secretary read the resolution, as follows:)\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the Committee on Public Lands be instructed to inquire\r\nand report the quantity of public land remaining unsold within each\r\nState and Territory, and whether it be expedient to limit for a certain\r\nperiod the sales of the public lands to such lands only as have\r\nheretofore been offered for sale, and are now subject to entry at the\r\nminimum price. And, also, whether the office of Surveyor-General, and\r\nsome of the land offices, may not be abolished without detriment to the\r\npublic interest; or whether it be expedient to adopt measures to hasten\r\nthe sales and extend more rapidly the surveys of the public lands.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus heard, sir, what the resolution is which is actually before\r\nus for consideration; and it will readily occur to everyone, that it is\r\nalmost the only subject about which something has not been said in the\r\nspeech, running through two days, by which the Senate has been\r\nentertained by the gentleman from South Carolina. Every topic in the\r\nwide range of our public affairs, whether past or present--every thing,\r\ngeneral or local, whether belonging to national politics or party\r\npolitics--seems to have attracted more or less of the honorable member's\r\nattention, save only the resolution before the Senate. He has spoken of\r\nevery thing but the public lands; they have escaped his notice. To that\r\nsubject, in all his excursions, he has not paid even the cold respect of\r\na passing glance.\r\n\r\nWhen this debate, sir, was to be resumed, on Thursday morning, it so\r\nhappened that it would have been convenient for me to be elsewhere. The\r\nhonorable member, however, did not incline to put off the discussion to\r\nanother day. He had a shot, he said, to return, and he wished to\r\ndischarge it. That shot, sir, which he thus kindly informed us was\r\ncoming, that we might stand out of the way, or prepare ourselves to fall\r\nby it and die with decency, has now been received. Under all advantages,\r\nand with expectation awakened by the tone which preceded it, it has been\r\ndischarged, and has spent its force. It may become me to say no more of\r\nits effect, than that, if nobody is found, after all, either killed or\r\nwounded, it is not the first time in the history of human affairs, that\r\nthe vigor and success of the war have not quite come up to the lofty and\r\nsounding phrase of the manifesto.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, sir, in declining to postpone the debate, told the\r\nSenate, with the emphasis of his hand upon his heart, that there was\r\nsomething rankling here, which he wished to relieve. (Mr. Hayne rose,\r\nand disclaimed having used the word rankling.) It would not, Mr.\r\nPresident, be safe for the honorable member to appeal to those around\r\nhim, upon the question whether he did in fact make use of that word. But\r\nhe may have been unconscious of it. At any rate, it is enough that he\r\ndisclaims it. But still, with or without the use of that particular\r\nword, he had yet something here, he said, of which he wished to rid\r\nhimself by an immediate reply. In this respect, sir, I have a great\r\nadvantage over the honorable gentleman. There is nothing here, sir,\r\nwhich gives me the slightest uneasiness; neither fear, nor anger, nor\r\nthat which is sometimes more troublesome than either, the consciousness\r\nof having been in the wrong. There is nothing, either originating here,\r\nor now received here by the gentleman's shot. Nothing originating here,\r\nfor I had not the slightest feeling of unkindness toward the honorable\r\nmember. Some passages, it is true, had occurred since our acquaintance\r\nin this body, which I could have wished might have been otherwise; but I\r\nhad used philosophy and forgotten them. I paid the honorable member the\r\nattention of listening with respect to his first speech; and when he sat\r\ndown, though surprised, and I must even say astonished, at some of his\r\nopinions, nothing was farther from my intention than to commence any\r\npersonal warfare. Through the whole of the few remarks I made in answer,\r\nI avoided, studiously and carefully, every thing which I thought\r\npossible to be construed into disrespect. And, Sir, while there is thus\r\nnothing originating here which I have wished at any time, or now wish,\r\nto discharge, I must repeat, also, that nothing has been received here\r\nwhich rankles, or in any way gives me annoyance. I will not accuse the\r\nhonorable member of violating the rules of civilized war; I will not say\r\nthat he poisoned his arrows. But whether his shafts were, or were not,\r\ndipped in that which would have caused rankling if they had reached\r\ntheir destination, there was not, as it happened, quite strength enough\r\nin the bow to bring them to their mark. If he wishes now to gather up\r\nthose shafts, he must look for them elsewhere; they will not be found\r\nfixed and quivering in the object at which they were aimed.\r\n\r\nThe honorable member complained that I slept on his speech. I must have\r\nslept on it, or not slept at all. The moment the honorable member sat\r\ndown, his friend from Missouri rose, and, with much honeyed commendation\r\nof the speech, suggested that the impressions which it had produced were\r\ntoo charming and delightful to be disturbed by other sentiments or other\r\nsounds, and proposed that the Senate should adjourn. Would it have been\r\nquite amiable in me, Sir, to interrupt this excellent good feeling? Must\r\nI not have been absolutely malicious, if I could have thrust myself\r\nforward, to destroy sensations thus pleasing? Was it not much better and\r\nkinder, both to sleep upon them myself, and to allow others also the\r\npleasure of sleeping upon them? But if it be meant, by sleeping upon his\r\nspeech, that I took time to prepare a reply to it, it is quite a\r\nmistake. Owing to other engagements, I could not employ even the\r\ninterval between the adjournment of the Senate and its meeting the next\r\nmorning, in attention to the subject of this debate. Nevertheless, Sir,\r\nthe mere matter of fact is undoubtedly true. I did sleep on the\r\ngentleman's speech, and slept soundly. And I slept equally well on his\r\nspeech of yesterday, to which I am now replying. It is quite possible\r\nthat in this respect, also, I possess some advantage over the honorable\r\nmember, attributable, doubtless, to a cooler temperament on my part;\r\nfor, in truth, I slept upon his speeches remarkably well.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman inquires why HE was made the object of such a reply.\r\nWhy was he singled out? If an attack has been made on the East, he, he\r\nassures us, did not begin it; it was made by the gentleman from\r\nMissouri. Sir, I answered the gentleman's speech because I happened to\r\nhear it; and because, also, I choose to give an answer to that speech,\r\nwhich, if unanswered, I thought most likely to produce injurious\r\nimpressions. I did not stop to inquire who was the original drawer of\r\nthe bill. I found a responsible indorser before me, and it was my\r\npurpose to hold him liable, and to bring him to his just responsibility\r\nwithout delay. But, sir, this interrogatory of the honorable member was\r\nonly introductory to another. He proceeded to ask me whether I had\r\nturned upon him in this debate, from the consciousness that I should\r\nfind an overmatch, if I ventured on a contest with his friend from\r\nMissouri. If, sir, the honorable member, _modestiae gratia_, had chosen\r\nthus to defer to his friend, and to pay him compliments, without\r\nintentional disparagement to others, it would have been quite according\r\nto the friendly courtesies of debate, and not at all ungrateful to my\r\nown feelings. I am not one of those, sir, who esteem any tribute of\r\nregard, whether light and occasional, or more serious and deliberate,\r\nwhich may be bestowed on others, as so much unjustly withholden from\r\nthemselves. But the tone and the manner of the gentleman's question\r\nforbid me thus to interpret it. I am not at liberty to consider it as\r\nnothing more than a civility to his friend. It had an air of taunt and\r\ndisparagement, something of the loftiness of asserted superiority, which\r\ndoes not allow me to pass it over without notice. It was put as a\r\nquestion for me to answer, and so put as if it were difficult for me to\r\nanswer whether I deemed the member from Missouri an overmatch for myself\r\nin debate here. It seems to me, sir, that this is extraordinary\r\nlanguage, and an extraordinary tone, for the discussions of this body.\r\n\r\nMatches and overmatches! Those terms are more applicable elsewhere than\r\nhere, and fitter for other assemblies than this. Sir, the gentleman\r\nseems to forget where and what we are. This is a Senate, a Senate of\r\nequals, of men of individual honor and personal character, and of\r\nabsolute independence. We know no masters, we acknowledge no dictators.\r\nThis is a hall for mutual consultation and discussion; not an arena for\r\nthe exhibition of champions. I offer myself, sir, as a match for no man;\r\nI throw the challenge of debate at no man's feet. But then, sir, since\r\nthe honorable member has put the question in a manner that calls for an\r\nanswer, I will give him an answer; and I tell him, that, holding myself\r\nto be the humblest of the members here, I yet know nothing in the arm of\r\nhis friend from Missouri, either alone or when aided by the arm of his\r\nfriend from South Carolina, that need deter even me from espousing\r\nwhatever opinions I may choose to espouse, from debating whenever I may\r\nchoose to debate, or from speaking whatever I may see fit to say, on the\r\nfloor of the Senate. Sir, when uttered as matter of commendation or\r\ncompliment, I should dissent from nothing which the honorable member\r\nmight say of his friend. Still less do I put forth any pretensions of my\r\nown. But when put to me as a matter of taunt, I throw it back, and say\r\nto the gentleman, that he could possibly say nothing less likely than\r\nsuch a comparison to wound my pride of personal character. The anger of\r\nits tone rescued the remark from intentional irony, which otherwise,\r\nprobably, would have been its general acceptation. But, sir, if it be\r\nimagined by this mutual quotation and commendation; if it be supposed\r\nthat, by casting the characters of the drama, assigning to each his\r\npart, to one the attack, to another the cry of onset; or if it be\r\nthought that, by a loud and empty vaunt of anticipated victory, any\r\nlaurels are to be won here; if it be imagined, especially, that any, or\r\nall of these things will shake any purpose of mine, I can tell the\r\nhonorable member, once for all, that he is greatly mistaken, and that he\r\nis dealing with one of whose temper and character he has yet much to\r\nlearn. Sir, I shall not allow myself, on this occasion, I hope on no\r\noccasion, to be betrayed into any loss of temper; but if provoked, as I\r\ntrust I never shall be, into crimination and recrimination, the\r\nhonorable member may, perhaps, find that in that contest, there will be\r\nblows to take as well as blows to give; that others can state\r\ncomparisons as significant, at least, as his own, and that his impunity\r\nmay possibly demand of him whatever powers of taunt and sarcasm he may\r\npossess. I commend him to a prudent husbandry of his resources.\r\n\r\nOn yet another point, I was still more unaccountably misunderstood. The\r\ngentlemen had harangued against \"consolidation.\" I told him, in reply,\r\nthat there was one kind of consolidation to which I was attached, and\r\nthat was the consolidation of our Union; that this was precisely that\r\nconsolidation to which I feared others were not attached, and that such\r\nconsolidation was the very end of the Constitution, the leading object,\r\nas they had informed us themselves, which its framers had kept in view.\r\nI turned to their communication, and read their very words, \"the\r\nconsolidation of the Union,\" and expressed my devotion to this sort of\r\nconsolidation. I said, in terms, that I wished not in the slightest\r\ndegree to augment the powers of this government; that my object was to\r\npreserve, not to enlarge; and that by consolidating the Union I\r\nunderstood no more than the strengthening of the Union, and perpetuating\r\nit. Having been thus explicit, having thus read from the printed book\r\nthe precise words which I adopted, as expressing my own sentiments, it\r\npasses comprehension how any man could understand me as contending for\r\nan extension of the powers of the government, or for consolidation in\r\nthat odious sense in which it means an accumulation, in the Federal\r\nGovernment, of the powers properly belonging to the States.\r\n\r\nI repeat, sir, that, in adopting the sentiments of the framers of the\r\nConstitution, I read their language audibly, and word for word; and I\r\npointed out the distinction, just as fully as I have now done, between\r\nthe consolidation of the Union and that other obnoxious consolidation\r\nwhich I disclaim. And yet the honorable member misunderstood me. The\r\ngentleman had said that he wished for no fixed revenue,--not a shilling.\r\nIf by a word he could convert the Capitol into gold, he would not do it.\r\nWhy all this fear of revenue? Why, sir, because, as the gentleman told\r\nus, it tends to consolidation. Now this can mean neither more nor less\r\nthan that a common revenue is a common interest, and that all common\r\ninterests tend to preserve the union of the States. I confess I like\r\nthat tendency; if the gentleman dislikes it, he is right in deprecating\r\na shilling of fixed revenue. So much, sir, for consolidation. * * *\r\n\r\nProfessing to be provoked by what he chose to consider a charge made by\r\nme against South Carolina, the honorable member, Mr. President, has\r\ntaken up a crusade against New England. Leaving altogether the subject\r\nof the public lands, in which his success, perhaps, had been neither\r\ndistinguished nor satisfactory, and letting go, also, of the topic of\r\nthe tariff, he sallied forth in a general assault on the opinions,\r\npolitics, and parties of New England, as they have been exhibited in the\r\nlast thirty years.\r\n\r\nNew England has, at times, so argues the gentleman, held opinions as\r\ndangerous as those which he now holds. Suppose this were so; how should\r\nhe therefore abuse New England? If he find himself countenanced by acts\r\nof hers, how is it that, while he relies on these acts, he covers, or\r\nseeks to cover, their authors with reproach? But, sir, if in the course\r\nof forty years, there have been undue effervescences of party in New\r\nEngland, has the same thing happened nowhere else? Party animosity and\r\nparty outrage, not in New England, but elsewhere, denounced President\r\nWashington, not only as a Federalist, but as a Tory, a British agent, a\r\nman who in his high office sanctioned corruption. But does the honorable\r\nmember suppose, if I had a tender here who should put such an effusion\r\nof wickedness and folly into my hand, that I would stand up and read it\r\nagainst the South? Parties ran into great heats again in 1799 and 1800.\r\nWhat was said, sir, or rather what was not said, in those years, against\r\nJohn Adams, one of the committee that drafted the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and its admitted ablest defender on the floor of Congress?\r\nIf the gentleman wishes to increase his stores of party abuse and frothy\r\nviolence, if he has a determined proclivity to such pursuits, there are\r\ntreasures of that sort south of the Potomac, much to his taste, yet\r\nuntouched. I shall not touch them. * * * The gentleman's purveyors have\r\nonly catered for him among the productions of one side. I certainly\r\nshall not supply the deficiency by furnishing him samples of the other.\r\nI leave to him, and to them, the whole concern. It is enough for me to\r\nsay, that if, in any part of their grateful occupation, if, in all their\r\nresearches, they find any thing in the history of Massachusetts, or of\r\nNew England, or in the proceedings of any legislative or other public\r\nbody, disloyal to the Union, speaking slightingly of its value,\r\nproposing to break it up, or recommending non-intercourse with\r\nneighboring States, on account of difference in political opinion, then,\r\nsir, I give them all up to the honorable gentleman's unrestrained\r\nrebuke; expecting, however, that he will extend his buffetings in like\r\nmanner, to all similar proceedings, wherever else found. * * *\r\n\r\nMr. President, in carrying his warfare, such as it is, into New England,\r\nthe honorable gentleman all along professes to be acting on the\r\ndefensive. He chooses to consider me as having assailed South Carolina,\r\nand insists that he comes forth only as her champion, and in her\r\ndefence. Sir, I do not admit that I made any attack whatever on South\r\nCarolina. Nothing like it. The honorable member, in his first speech,\r\nexpressed opinions, in regard to revenue and some other topics, which I\r\nheard with both pain and surprise. I told the gentleman I was aware that\r\nsuch sentiments were entertained out of the Government, but had not\r\nexpected to find them advanced in it; that I knew there were persons in\r\nthe South who speak of our Union with indifference or doubt, taking\r\npains to magnify its evils, and to say nothing of its benefits; that the\r\nhonorable member himself, I was sure, could never be one of these; and I\r\nregretted the expression of such opinions as he had avowed, because I\r\nthought their obvious tendency was to encourage feelings of disrespect\r\nto the Union, and to impair its strength. This, sir, is the sum and\r\nsubstance of all I said on the abject. And this constitutes the attack\r\nwhich called on the chivalry of the gentleman, in his own opinion, to\r\nharry us with such a foray among the party pamphlets and party\r\nproceedings in Massachusetts! If he means that I spoke with\r\ndissatisfaction or disrespect of the ebullitions of individuals in South\r\nCarolina, it is true. But if he means that I assailed the character of\r\nthe State, her honor, or patriotism, that I reflected on her history or\r\nher conduct, he has not the slightest grounds for any such assumption. *\r\n* * I shall not acknowledge that the honorable member goes before me in\r\nregard for whatever of distinguished talent or distinguished character\r\nSouth Carolina has produced. I claim part of the honor, I partake in the\r\npride of her great names. I claim them for my countrymen, one and all,\r\nthe Laurenses, the Rutledges, the Pinckneys, the Sumpters, the\r\nMarions,--Americans all, whose fame is no more to be hemmed in by State\r\nlines than their talents and patriotism were capable of being\r\ncircumscribed within the same narrow limits. In their day and generation\r\nthey served and honored the country, and the whole country; and their\r\nrenown is of the treasures of the whole country. Him whose honored name\r\nthe gentleman himself bears--does he esteem me less capable of gratitude\r\nfor his patriotism, or sympathy for his sufferings, than if his eyes had\r\nfirst opened upon the light of Massachusetts, instead of South Carolina?\r\nSir, does he suppose it in his power to exhibit a Carolina name so\r\nbright as to produce envy in my bosom? No, sir; increased gratification\r\nand delight, rather. I thank God that, if I am gifted with little of the\r\nspirit which is able to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet none, as\r\nI trust, of that other spirit which would drag angels down. When I shall\r\nbe found, sir, in my place here in the Senate, or elsewhere, to sneer at\r\npublic merit, because it happens to spring up beyond the little limits\r\nof my own State or neighborhood; when I refuse, for any such cause, or\r\nfor any cause, the homage due to American talent, to elevated\r\npatriotism, to sincere devotion to liberty and the country; or, if I see\r\nan uncommon endowment of Heaven, if I see extraordinary capacity and\r\nvirtue, in any son of the South; and if, moved by local prejudices or\r\ngangrened by State jealousy, I get up here to abate the tithe of a hair\r\nfrom his just character and just fame, may my tongue cleave to the roof\r\nof my mouth!\r\n\r\nSir, let me recur to pleasing recollections; let me indulge in\r\nrefreshing remembrances of the past; let me remind you that, in early\r\ntimes, no States cherished greater harmony, both of principle and\r\nfeeling, than Massachusetts and South Carolina. Would to God that\r\nharmony might again return! Shoulder to shoulder they went through the\r\nRevolution, hand in hand they stood round the administration of\r\nWashington, and felt his own great arm lean on them for support. Unkind\r\nfeeling, if it exist, alienation, and distrust, are the growth,\r\nunnatural to such soils, of false principles since sown. They are weeds,\r\nthe seeds of which that same great arm never scattered.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall enter upon no encomium of Massachusetts; she\r\nneeds none. There she is. Behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is\r\nher history; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least, is secure.\r\nThere is Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and there\r\nthey will remain for ever. The bones of her sons, falling in the great\r\nstruggle for Independence, now lie mingled with the soil of every State\r\nfrom New England to Georgia, and there they will lie forever. And, sir,\r\nwhere American Liberty raised its first voice, and where its youth was\r\nnurtured and sustained, there it still lives, in the strength of its\r\nmanhood, and full of its original spirit. If discord and disunion shall\r\nwound it, if party strife and blind ambition shall hawk and tear it, if\r\nfolly and madness, if uneasiness under salutary and necessary restraint\r\nshall succeed in separating it from that Union, by which alone its\r\nexistence is made sure, it will stand, in the end, by the side of that\r\ncradle in which its infancy was rocked; it will stretch forth its arm\r\nwith whatever of vigor it may still retain, over the friends who gather\r\nround it; and it will fall at last, if fall it must, amidst the\r\nprofoundest monuments of its own glory, and on the very spot of its\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThere yet remains to be performed, Mr. President, by far the most grave\r\nand important duty which I feel to be devolved upon me by this occasion.\r\nIt is to state, and to defend, what I conceive to be the true principles\r\nof the Constitution under which we are here assembled. I might well have\r\ndesired that so weighty a task should have fallen into other and abler\r\nhands. I could have wished that it should have been executed by those\r\nwhose character and experience give weight and influence to their\r\nopinions, such as cannot possibly belong to mine. But, sir, I have met\r\nthe occasion, not sought it; and I shall proceed to state my own\r\nsentiments, without challenging for them any particular regard, with\r\nstudied plainness, and as much precision as possible.\r\n\r\nI understand the honorable gentleman from South Carolina to maintain\r\nthat it is a right of the State Legislatures to interfere whenever, in\r\ntheir judgment, this government transcends its constitutional limits,\r\nand to arrest the operation of its laws.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain this right, as a right existing under the\r\nConstitution, not as a right to overthrow it on the ground of extreme\r\nnecessity, such as would justify violent revolution.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain an authority on the part of the States,\r\nthus to interfere, for the purpose of correcting the exercise of power\r\nby the General Government, of checking it and of compelling it to\r\nconform to their opinion of the extent of its powers.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain, that the ultimate power of judging of the\r\nconstitutional extent of its own authority is not lodged exclusively in\r\nthe General Government, or any branch of it; but that, on the contrary,\r\nthe States may lawfully decide for themselves, and each State for\r\nitself, whether, in a given case, the act of the General Government\r\ntranscends its power.\r\n\r\nI understand him to insist, that, if the exigencies of the case, in the\r\nopinion of any State government, require it, such State government may,\r\nby its own sovereign authority, annul an act of the General Government\r\nwhich it deems plainly and palpably unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThis is the sum of what I understand from him to be the South Carolina\r\ndoctrine, and the doctrine which he maintains. I propose to consider it,\r\nand compare it with the Constitution. Allow me to say, as a preliminary\r\nremark, that I call this the South Carolina doctrine only because the\r\ngentleman himself has so denominated it. I do not feel at liberty to say\r\nthat South Carolina, as a State, has ever advanced these sentiments. I\r\nhope she has not, and never may. That a great majority of her people are\r\nopposed to the tariff laws, is doubtless true. That a majority, somewhat\r\nless than that just mentioned, conscientiously believe these laws\r\nunconstitutional, may probably also be true. But that any majority holds\r\nto the right of direct State interference at State discretion, the right\r\nof nullifying acts of Congress by acts of State legislation, is more\r\nthan I know, and what I shall be slow to believe.\r\n\r\nThat there are individuals besides the honorable gentleman who do\r\nmaintain these opinions, is quite certain. I recollect the recent\r\nexpression of a sentiment, which circumstances attending its utterance\r\nand publication justify us in supposing was not unpremeditated. \"The\r\nsovereignty of the State,--never to be controlled, construed, or decided\r\non, but by her own feelings of honorable justice.\"\r\n\r\n[Mr. HAYNE here rose and said, that, for the purpose of being clearly\r\nunderstood, he would state that his proposition was in the words of the\r\nVirginia resolution as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That this assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that it\r\nviews the powers of the Federal Government, as resulting from the\r\ncompact to which the States are parties, as limited by the plain sense\r\nand intention of the instrument constituting that compact, as no farther\r\nvalid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact;\r\nand that, in case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of\r\nother powers not granted by the said compact. The States that are\r\nparties thereto have the right, and are in duty bound to interpose for\r\narresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their\r\nrespective limits the authorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nMr. WEBSTER resumed:]\r\n\r\nI am quite aware, Mr. President, of the existence of the resolution\r\nwhich the gentleman read, and has now repeated, and that he relies on it\r\nas his authority. I know the source, too, from which it is understood to\r\nhave proceeded. I need not say that I have much respect for the\r\nconstitutional opinions of Mr. Madison; they would weigh greatly with me\r\nalways. But before the authority of his opinion be vouched for the\r\ngentleman's proposition, it will be proper to consider what is the fair\r\ninterpretation of that resolution, to which Mr. Madison is understood to\r\nhave given his sanction. As the gentleman construes it, it is an\r\nauthority for him. Possibly, he may not have adopted the right\r\nconstruction. That resolution declares, that, in the case of the\r\ndangerous exercise of powers not granted by the General Government, the\r\nStates may interpose to arrest the progress of the evil. But how\r\ninterpose, and what does this declaration purport? Does it mean no more\r\nthan that there may be extreme cases, in which the people, in any mode\r\nof assembling, may resist usurpation, and relieve themselves from a\r\ntyrannical government? No one will deny this. Such resistance is not\r\nonly acknowledged to be just in America, but in England also. Blackstone\r\nadmits as much, in the theory, and practice, too, of the English\r\nConstitution. We, sir, who oppose the Carolina doctrine, do not deny\r\nthat the people may, if they choose, throw off any government when it\r\nbecomes oppressive and intolerable, and erect a better in its stead. We\r\nall know that civil institutions are established for the public benefit,\r\nand that when they cease to answer the ends of their existence they may\r\nbe changed. But I do not understand the doctrine now contended for to be\r\nthat, which, for the sake of distinction, we may call the right of\r\nrevolution. I understand the gentleman to maintain, that, without\r\nrevolution, without civil commotion, without rebellion, a remedy for\r\nsupposed abuse and transgression of the powers of the General Government\r\nlies in a direct appeal to the interference of the State governments.\r\n\r\n[Mr. HAYNE here arose and said: He did not contend for the mere right of\r\nrevolution, but for the right of constitutional resistance. What he\r\nmaintained was, that in a case of plain, palpable violation of the\r\nConstitution by the General Government, a State may interpose; and that\r\nthis interposition is constitutional.\r\n\r\nMr. WEBSTER resumed:]\r\n\r\nSo, sir, I understood the gentleman, and am happy to find that I did not\r\nmisunderstand him. What he contends for is, that it is constitutional to\r\ninterrupt the administration of the Constitution itself, in the hands of\r\nthose who are chosen and sworn to administer it, by the direct\r\ninterference, in form of law, of the States, in virtue of their\r\nsovereign capacity. The inherent right in the people to reform their\r\ngovernment I do not deny; and they have another right, and that is, to\r\nresist unconstitutional laws, without overturning the government. It is\r\nno doctrine of mine that unconstitutional laws bind the people. The\r\ngreat question is, Whose prerogative is it to decide on the\r\nconstitutionality or unconstitutionality of the laws? On that, the main\r\ndebate hinges. The proposition, that, in case of a supposed violation of\r\nthe Constitution by Congress, the States have a constitutional right to\r\ninterfere and annul the law of Congress is the proposition of the\r\ngentleman. I do not admit it. If the gentleman had intended no more than\r\nto assert the right of revolution for justifiable cause, he would have\r\nsaid only what all agree to. But I cannot conceive that there can be a\r\nmiddle course, between submission to the laws, when regularly pronounced\r\nconstitutional, on the one hand, and open resistance, which is\r\nrevolution or rebellion, on the other. I say, the right of a State to\r\nannul a law of Congress cannot be maintained, but on the ground of the\r\ninalienable right of man to resist oppression; that is to say, upon the\r\nground of revolution. I admit that there is an ultimate violent remedy,\r\nabove the Constitution and in defiance of the Constitution, which may be\r\nresorted to when a revolution is to be justified. But I do not admit,\r\nthat, under the Constitution and in conformity with it, there is any\r\nmode in which a State government, as a member of the Union, can\r\ninterfere and stop the progress of the General Government, by force of\r\nher own laws, under any circumstances whatever.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to inquire into the origin of this government and the\r\nsource of its power. Whose agent is it? Is it the creature of the State\r\nLegislatures, or the creature of the people? If the Government of the\r\nUnited States be the agent of the State governments, then they may\r\ncontrol it, provided they can agree in the manner of controlling it; if\r\nit be the agent of the people, then the people alone can control it,\r\nrestrain it, modify, or reform it. It is observable enough, that the\r\ndoctrine for which the honorable gentleman contends leads him to the\r\nnecessity of maintaining, not only that this General Government is the\r\ncreature of the States, but that it is the creature of each of the\r\nStates, severally, so that each may assert the power for itself of\r\ndetermining whether it acts within the limits of its authority. It is\r\nthe servant of four-and-twenty masters, of different wills and different\r\npurposes, and yet bound to obey all. This absurdity (for it seems no\r\nless) arises from a misconception as to the origin of this government\r\nand its true character. It is, sir, the people's Constitution, the\r\npeople's government, made for the people, made by the people, and\r\nanswerable to the people. The people of the United States have declared\r\nthat this Constitution shall be supreme law. We must either admit the\r\nproposition, or deny their authority. The States are, unquestionably,\r\nsovereign, so far as their sovereignty is not affected by this supreme\r\nlaw. But the State Legislatures, as political bodies, however sovereign,\r\nare yet not sovereign over the people. So far as the people have given\r\npower to the General Government, so far the grant is unquestionably\r\ngood, and the Government holds of the people, and not of the State\r\ngovernments. We are all agents of the same supreme power, the people.\r\nThe General Government and the State governments derive their authority\r\nfrom the same source. Neither can, in relation to the other, be called\r\nprimary, though one is definite and restricted, and the other general\r\nand residuary. The National Government possesses those powers which it\r\ncan be shown the people have conferred on it, and no more. All the rest\r\nbelongs to the State governments, or to the people themselves. So far as\r\nthe people have restrained State sovereignty by the expression of their\r\nwill, in the Constitution of the United States, so far, it must be\r\nadmitted, State sovereignty is effectually controlled. I do not contend\r\nthat it is, or ought to be, controlled farther. The sentiment to which I\r\nhave referred propounds that State sovereignty is only to be controlled\r\nby its own \"feeling of justice\"--that is to say, it is not to be\r\ncontrolled at all, for one who is to follow his own feelings is under no\r\nlegal control. Now, however men may think this ought to be, the fact is\r\nthat the people of the United States have chosen to impose control on\r\nState sovereignties. There are those, doubtless, who wish they had been\r\nleft without restraint; but the Constitution has ordered the matter\r\ndifferently. To make war, for instance, is an exercise of sovereignty;\r\nbut the Constitution declares that no State shall make war. To coin\r\nmoney is another exercise of sovereign power; but no State is at liberty\r\nto coin money. Again, the Constitution says that no sovereign State\r\nshall be so sovereign as to make a treaty. These prohibitions, it must\r\nbe confessed, are a control on the State sovereignty of South Carolina,\r\nas well as of the other States, which does not arise \"from her own\r\nfeelings of honorable justice.\" The opinion referred to, therefore, is\r\nin defiance of the plainest provisions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThere are other proceedings of public bodies which have already been\r\nalluded to, and to which I refer again, for the purpose of ascertaining\r\nmore fully what is the length and breadth of that doctrine denominated\r\nthe Carolina doctrine, which the honorable member has now stood up on\r\nthis floor to maintain. In one of them I find it resolved, that \"the\r\ntariff of 1828, and every other tariff designed to promote one branch of\r\nindustry at the expense of others, is contrary to the meaning and\r\nintention of the federal compact, and such a dangerous, palpable, and\r\ndeliberate usurpation of power, by a determined majority, wielding the\r\nGeneral Government beyond the limits of its delegated powers, as calls\r\nupon the States which compose the suffering minority, in their sovereign\r\ncapacity, to exercise the powers which, as sovereigns, necessarily\r\ndevolve upon them when their contract is violated.\"\r\n\r\nObserve, sir, that this resolution holds the tariff of 1828, and every\r\nother tariff designed to promote one branch of industry at the expense\r\nof another, to be such a dangerous, palpable, and deliberate usurpation\r\nof power, as calls upon the States, in their sovereign capacity, to\r\ninterfere by their own authority. This denunciation, Mr. President, you\r\nwill please to observe, includes our old tariff of 1816, as well as all\r\nothers; because that was established to promote the interest of the\r\nmanufacturers of cotton, to the manifest and admitted injury of the\r\nCalcutta cotton trade. Observe, again, that all the qualifications are\r\nhere rehearsed and charged upon the tariff, which are necessary to bring\r\nthe case within the gentleman's proposition. The tariff is a usurpation;\r\nit is a dangerous usurpation; it is a palpable usurpation; it is a\r\ndeliberate usurpation. It is such a usurpation, therefore, as calls upon\r\nthe States to exercise their right of interference. Here is a case,\r\nthen, within the gentleman's principles, and all his qualifications of\r\nhis principles. It is a case for action. The Constitution is plainly,\r\ndangerously, palpably, and deliberately violated; and the States must\r\ninterpose their own authority to arrest the law. Let us suppose the\r\nState of South Carolina to express the same opinion, by the voice of her\r\nLegislature. That would be very imposing; but what then? It so happens\r\nthat, at the very moment, when South Carolina resolves that the tariff\r\nlaws are unconstitutional, Pennsylvania and Kentucky resolve exactly the\r\nreverse. They hold those laws to be both highly proper and strictly\r\nconstitutional. And now, sir, how does the honorable member propose to\r\ndeal with this case? How does he relieve us from this difficulty upon\r\nany principle of his? His construction gets us into it; how does he\r\npropose to get us out?\r\n\r\nIn Carolina the tariff is a palpable, deliberate usurpation; Carolina,\r\ntherefore, may nullify it, and refuse to pay the duties. In Pennsylvania\r\nit is both clearly constitutional and highly expedient; and there the\r\nduties are to be paid. And yet we live under a government of uniform\r\nlaws, and under a constitution, too, which contains an express\r\nprovision, as it happens, that all duties shall be equal in all States.\r\nDoes not this approach absurdity?\r\n\r\nIf there be no power to settle such questions, independent of either of\r\nthe States, is not the whole Union a rope of sand? Are we not thrown\r\nback again precisely upon the old Confederation?\r\n\r\nIt is too plain to be argued. Four-and-twenty interpreters of\r\nconstitutional law, each with a power to decide for itself, and none\r\nwith authority to bind any body else, and this constitutional law the\r\nonly bond of their union! What is such a state of things but a mere\r\nconnection during pleasure, or to use the phraseology of the times,\r\nduring feeling? And that feeling, too, not the feeling of the people,\r\nwho established the Constitution, but the feeling of the State\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nIn another of the South Carolina addresses, having premised that the\r\ncrisis requires \"all the concentrated energy of passion,\" an attitude of\r\nopen resistance to the laws of the Union is advised. Open resistance to\r\nthe laws, then, is the constitutional remedy, the conservative power of\r\nthe State, which the South Carolina doctrines teach for the redress of\r\npolitical evils, real or imaginary. And its authors further say, that,\r\nappealing with confidence to the Constitution itself, to justify their\r\nopinions, they cannot consent to try their accuracy by the courts of\r\njustice. In one sense, indeed, sir, this is assuming an attitude of open\r\nresistance in favor of liberty. But what sort of liberty? The liberty of\r\nestablishing their own opinions, in defiance of the opinions of all\r\nothers; the liberty of judging and deciding exclusively themselves, in a\r\nmatter in which others have as much right to judge and decide as they;\r\nthe liberty of placing their own opinion above the judgment of all\r\nothers, above the laws, and above the Constitution. This is their\r\nliberty, and this is the fair result of the proposition contended for by\r\nthe honorable gentleman. Or, it may be more properly said, it is\r\nidentical with it, rather than a result from it. * * *\r\n\r\nSir, the human mind is so constituted, that the merits of both sides of\r\na controversy appear very clear, and very palpable, to those who\r\nrespectively espouse them; and both sides usually grow clearer as the\r\ncontroversy advances. South Carolina sees unconstitutionality in the\r\ntariff; she sees oppression there also, and she sees danger.\r\nPennsylvania, with a vision not less sharp, looks at the same tariff,\r\nand sees no such thing in it; she sees it all constitutional, all\r\nuseful, all safe. The faith of South Carolina is strengthened by\r\nopposition, and she now not only sees, but resolves, that the tariff is\r\npalpably unconstitutional, oppressive, and dangerous; but Pennsylvania,\r\nnot to be behind her neighbors, and equally willing to strengthen her\r\nown faith by a confident asseveration resolves, also, and gives to every\r\nwarm affirmative of South Carolina, a plain, downright, Pennsylvania\r\nnegative. South Carolina, to show the strength and unity of her opinion,\r\nbrings her assembly to a unanimity, within seven voices; Pennsylvania,\r\nnot to be outdone in this respect any more than in others, reduces her\r\ndissentient fraction to a single vote. Now, sir, again, I ask the\r\ngentleman, What is to be done? Are these States both right? Is he bound\r\nto consider them both right? If not, which is in the wrong? or, rather,\r\nwhich has the best right to decide? And if he, and if I, are not to know\r\nwhat the Constitution means, and what it is, till those two State\r\nlegislatures, and the twenty-two others, shall agree in its\r\nconstruction, what have we sworn to, when we have sworn to maintain it?\r\nI was forcibly struck, sir, with one reflection, as the gentleman went\r\non in his speech. He quoted Mr. Madison's resolutions, to prove that a\r\nState may interfere, in a case of deliberate, palpable, and dangerous\r\nexercise of a power not granted. The honorable member supposes the\r\ntariff law to be such an exercise of power; and that consequently a case\r\nhas arisen in which the State may, if it see fit, interfere by its own\r\nlaw. Now it so happens, nevertheless, that Mr. Madison deems this same\r\ntariff law quite constitutional. Instead of a clear and palpable\r\nviolation, it is, in his judgment, no violation at all. So that, while\r\nthey use his authority in a hypothetical case, they reject it in the\r\nvery case before them. All this, sir, shows the inherent futility, I had\r\nalmost used a stronger word, of conceding this power of interference to\r\nthe State, and then attempting to secure it from abuse by imposing\r\nqualifications of which the States themselves are to judge. One of two\r\nthings is true; either the laws of the Union are beyond the discretion\r\nand beyond the control of the States; or else we have no constitution of\r\ngeneral government, and are thrust back again to the days of the\r\nConfederation. * * *\r\n\r\nI must now beg to ask, sir, whence is this supposed right of the States\r\nderived? Where do they find the power to interfere with the laws of the\r\nUnion? Sir, the opinion which the honorable gentleman maintains, is a\r\nnotion founded in a total misapprehension, in my judgment, of the origin\r\nof this government, and of the foundation on which it stands. I hold it\r\nto be a popular government, erected by the people; those who administer\r\nit, responsible to the people; and itself capable of being amended and\r\nmodified, just as the people may choose it should be. It is as popular,\r\njust as truly emanating from the people, as the State governments. It is\r\ncreated for one purpose; the State governments for another. It has its\r\nown powers; they have theirs. There is no more authority with them to\r\narrest the operation of a law of Congress, than with Congress to arrest\r\nthe operation of their laws. We are here to administer a constitution\r\nemanating immediately from the people, and trusted by them to our\r\nadministration. It is not the creature of the State governments.\r\n\r\nThis government, sir, is the independent off-spring of the popular will.\r\nIt is not the creature of State legislatures; nay, more, if the whole\r\ntruth must be told, the people brought it into existence, established\r\nit, and have hitherto supported it, for the very purpose amongst others,\r\nof imposing certain salutary restraints on State sovereignties. The\r\nStates cannot now make war; they cannot contract alliances; they cannot\r\nmake, each for itself, separate regulations of commerce; they cannot lay\r\nimposts; they cannot coin money. If this Constitution, sir, be the\r\ncreature of State legislatures, it must be admitted that it has obtained\r\na strange control over the volitions of its creators.\r\n\r\nThe people, then, sir, erected this government. They gave it a\r\nconstitution, and in that constitution they have enumerated the powers\r\nwhich they bestow on it. They have made it a limited government. They\r\nhave defined its authority. They have restrained it to the exercise of\r\nsuch powers as are granted; and all others, they declare, are reserved\r\nto the States, or the people. But, sir, they have not stopped here. If\r\nthey had, they would have accomplished but half their work. No\r\ndefinition can be so clear as to avoid the possibility of doubt; no\r\nlimitation so precise, as to exclude all uncertainty. Who, then, shall\r\nconstrue this grant of the people? Who shall interpret their will, where\r\nit may be supposed they have left it doubtful? With whom do they repose\r\nthis ultimate right of deciding on the powers of the government? Sir,\r\nthey have settled all this in the fullest manner. They have left it with\r\nthe government itself, in its appropriate branches. Sir, the very chief\r\nend, the main design, for which the whole Constitution was framed and\r\nadopted, was to establish a government that should not be obliged to act\r\nthrough State agency, or depend on State opinion or State discretion.\r\nThe people had had quite enough of that kind of government under the\r\nConfederation. Under that system, the legal action, the application of\r\nlaw to individuals, belonged exclusively to the States. Congress could\r\nonly recommend; their acts were not of binding force, till the States\r\nhad adopted and sanctioned them. Are we in that condition still? Are we\r\nyet at the mercy of State discretion and State construction? Sir, if we\r\nare, then vain will be our attempt to maintain the Constitution under\r\nwhich we sit.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, the people have wisely provided, in the Constitution itself, a\r\nproper, suitable mode and tribunal for settling questions of\r\nconstitutional law. There are in the Constitution grants of powers to\r\nCongress, and restrictions on these powers. There are also prohibitions\r\non the States. Some authority must, therefore, necessarily exist, having\r\nthe ultimate jurisdiction to fix and ascertain the interpretation of\r\nthese grants, restrictions, and prohibitions. The Constitution has\r\nitself pointed out, ordained, and established that authority. How has it\r\naccomplished this great and essential end? By declaring, sir, that \"the\r\nConstitution and the laws of the United States made in pursuance\r\nthereof, shall be the supreme law of the land, any thing in the\r\nConstitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\nThis, sir, was the first great step. By this the supremacy of the\r\nConstitution and the laws of the United States is declared. The people\r\nso will it. No State law is to be valid which comes in conflict with the\r\nConstitution, or any law of the United States passed in pursuance of it.\r\nBut who shall decide this question of interference? To whom lies the\r\nlast appeal? This, sir, the Constitution itself decides also, by\r\ndeclaring, \"that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising\r\nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" These two\r\nprovisions cover the whole ground. They are, in truth, the keystone of\r\nthe arch! With these it is a government, without them a confederation.\r\nIn pursuance of these clear and express provisions, Congress\r\nestablished, at its very first session, in the judicial act, a mode for\r\ncarrying them into full effect, and for bringing all questions of\r\nconstitutional power to the final decision of the Supreme Court. It\r\nthen, sir, became a government. It then had the means of\r\nself-protection; and but for this, it would, in all probability, have\r\nbeen now among things which are past. Having constituted the Government,\r\nand declared its powers, the people have further said, that, since\r\nsomebody must decide on the extent of these powers, the Government shall\r\nitself decide; subject, always, like other popular governments, to its\r\nresponsibility to the people. And now, sir, I repeat, how is it that a\r\nState legislature acquires any power to interfere? Who, or what gives\r\nthem the right to say to the people: \"We, who are your agents and\r\nservants for one purpose, will undertake to decide, that your other\r\nagents and servants, appointed by you for another purpose, have\r\ntranscended the authority you gave them!\" The reply would be, I think,\r\nnot impertinent: \"Who made you a judge over another's servants? To their\r\nown masters they stand or fall.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I deny this power of State legislatures altogether. It cannot stand\r\nthe test of examination. Gentlemen may say, that, in an extreme case, a\r\nState government may protect the people from intolerable oppression.\r\nSir, in such a case the people might protect themselves without the aid\r\nof the State governments. Such a case warrants revolution. It must make,\r\nwhen it comes, a law for itself. A nullifying act of a State legislature\r\ncannot alter the case, nor make resistance any more lawful. In\r\nmaintaining these sentiments, sir, I am but asserting the rights of the\r\npeople. I state what they have declared, and insist on their right to\r\ndeclare it.\r\n\r\nThey have chosen to repose this power in the General Government, and I\r\nthink it my duty to support it like other constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nFor myself, sir, I do not admit the competency of South Carolina or any\r\nother State to prescribe my constitutional duty; or to settle, between\r\nme and the people the validity of laws of Congress for which I have\r\nvoted. I decline her umpirage. I have not sworn to support the\r\nConstitution according to her construction of the clauses. I have not\r\nstipulated by my oath of office or otherwise, to come under any\r\nresponsibility, except to the people, and those whom they have appointed\r\nto pass upon the question, whether laws, supported by my votes, conform\r\nto the Constitution of the country. And, sir, if we look to the general\r\nnature of the case, could any thing have been more preposterous than to\r\nmake a government for the whole Union, and yet leave its powers subject,\r\nnot to one interpretation, but to thirteen or twenty-four\r\ninterpretations? Instead of one tribunal, established by all,\r\nresponsible to all, with power to decide for all, shall constitutional\r\nquestions be left to four-and-twenty popular bodies, each at liberty to\r\ndecide for itself, and none bound to respect the decisions of others;\r\nand each at liberty, too, to give a new constitution on every new\r\nelection of its own members? Would any thing, with such a principle in\r\nit, or rather with such a destitution of all principle be fit to be\r\ncalled a government? No, sir. It should not be denominated a\r\nconstitution. It should be called, rather, a collection of topics for\r\neverlasting controversy; heads of debate for a disputatious people. It\r\nwould not be a government. It would not be adequate to any practical\r\ngood, or fit for any country to live under.\r\n\r\nTo avoid all possibility of being misunderstood, allow me to repeat\r\nagain in the fullest manner, that I claim no powers for the government\r\nby forced or unfair construction. I admit that it is a government of\r\nstrictly limited powers; of enumerated, specified, and particularized\r\npowers; and that whatsoever is not granted is withheld. But\r\nnotwithstanding all this, and however the grant of powers may be\r\nexpressed, its limit and extent may yet, in some cases, admit of doubt;\r\nand the General Government would be good for nothing, it would be\r\nincapable of long existing, if some mode had not been provided in which\r\nthose doubts as they should arise, might be peaceably but\r\nauthoritatively solved.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, let me run the honorable gentleman's doctrine a\r\nlittle into its practical application. Let us look at his probable\r\n_modus operandi_. If a thing can be done, an ingenious man can tell how\r\nit is to be done, and I wish to be informed how this State interference\r\nis to be put in practice, without violence, bloodshed, and rebellion. We\r\nwill take the existing case of the tariff law. South Carolina is said to\r\nhave made up her opinion upon it. If we do not repeal it (as we probably\r\nshall not), she will then apply to the case the remedy of her doctrine.\r\nShe will, we must suppose, pass a law of her legislature, declaring the\r\nseveral acts of Congress, usually called the tariff laws, null and void,\r\nso far as they respect South Carolina, or the citizens thereof. So far,\r\nall is a paper transaction, and easy enough. But the collector at\r\nCharleston is collecting the duties imposed by these tariff laws. He,\r\ntherefore, must be stopped. The collector will seize the goods if the\r\ntariff duties are not paid. The State authorities will undertake their\r\nrescue, the marshal, with his posse, will come to the collector's aid,\r\nand here the contest begins. The militia of the State will be called out\r\nto sustain the nullifying act. They will march, sir, under a very\r\ngallant leader; for I believe the honorable member himself commands the\r\nmilitia of that part of the State. He will raise the NULLIFYING ACT on\r\nhis standard, and spread it out as his banner! It will have a preamble,\r\nsetting forth, that the tariff laws are palpable, deliberate, and\r\ndangerous violations of the Constitution! He will proceed, with this\r\nbanner flying, to the custom-house in Charleston,\r\n\r\n         \"All the while,\r\n   Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds.\"\r\n\r\nArrived at the custom-house, he will tell the collector that he must\r\ncollect no more duties under any of the tariff laws. This he will be\r\nsomewhat puzzled to say, by the way, with a grave countenance,\r\nconsidering what hand South Carolina herself had in that of 1816. But,\r\nsir, the collector would not, probably, desist at his bidding. He would\r\nshow him the law of Congress, the treasury instruction, and his own oath\r\nof office. He would say, he should perform his duty, come what come\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nHere would ensue a pause; for they say that a certain stillness precedes\r\nthe tempest. The trumpeter would hold his breath awhile, and before all\r\nthis military array should fall on the custom-house, collector, clerks,\r\nand all, it is very probable some of those composing it would request of\r\ntheir gallant commander-in-chief to be informed upon a little point of\r\nlaw; for they have doubtless, a just respect for his opinions as a\r\nlawyer, as well as for his bravery as a soldier. They know he has read\r\nBlackstone and the Constitution, as well as Turenne and Vauban. They\r\nwould ask him, therefore, somewhat concerning their rights in this\r\nmatter. They would inquire whether it was not somewhat dangerous to\r\nresist a law of the United States. What would be the nature of their\r\noffence, they would wish to learn, if they, by military force and array,\r\nresisted the execution in Carolina of a law of the United States, and it\r\nshould turn out, after all, that the law was constitutional? He would\r\nanswer, of course, treason. No lawyer could give any other answer. John\r\nFries, he would tell them, had learned that some years ago. \"How, then,\"\r\nthey would ask, \"do you propose to defend us? We are not afraid of\r\nbullets, but treason has a way of taking people off that we do not much\r\nrelish. How do you propose to defend us?\" \"Look at my floating banner,\"\r\nhe would reply; \"see there the nullifying law!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it your opinion, gallant commander,\" they would then say, \"that, if\r\nwe should be indicted for treason, that same floating banner of yours\r\nwould make a good plea in bar?\" \"South Carolina is a sovereign State,\"\r\nhe would reply. \"That is true; but would the judge admit our plea?\"\r\n\"These tariff laws,\" he would repeat, \"are unconstitutional, palpably,\r\ndeliberately, dangerously.\" \"That may all be so; but if the tribunal\r\nshould not happen to be of that opinion, shall we swing for it? We are\r\nready to die for our country, but it is rather an awkward business, this\r\ndying without touching the ground! After all, that is a sort of hemp tax\r\nworse than any part of the tariff.\"\r\n\r\nMr. President, the honorable gentleman would be in a dilemma, like that\r\nof another great general. He would have a knot before him which he could\r\nnot untie. He must cut it with his sword. He must say to his followers,\r\n\"Defend yourselves with your bayonets\"; and this is war--civil war.\r\n\r\nDirect collision, therefore, between force and force, is the unavoidable\r\nresult of that remedy for the revision of unconstitutional laws which\r\nthe gentleman contends for. It must happen in the very first case to\r\nwhich it is applied. Is not this the plain result? To resist by force\r\nthe execution of a law, generally, is treason. Can the courts of the\r\nUnited States take notice of the indulgence of a State to commit\r\ntreason? The common saying, that a State cannot commit treason herself,\r\nis nothing to the purpose. Can she authorize others to do it? If John\r\nFries had produced an act of Pennsylvania, annulling the law of\r\nCongress, would it have helped his case? Talk about it as we will, these\r\ndoctrines go the length of revolution. They are incompatible with any\r\npeaceable administration of the government. They lead directly to\r\ndisunion and civil commotion; and therefore it is, that at their\r\ncommencement, when they are first found to be maintained by respectable\r\nmen, and in a tangible form, I enter my public protest against them all.\r\n\r\nThe honorable gentleman argues that, if this Government be the sole\r\njudge of the extent of its own powers, whether that right of judging be\r\nin Congress or the Supreme Court, it equally subverts State sovereignty.\r\nThis the gentleman sees, or thinks he sees, although he cannot perceive\r\nhow the right of judging, in this matter, if left to the exercise of\r\nState legislatures, has any tendency to subvert the government of the\r\nUnion. The gentleman's opinion may be, that the right ought not to have\r\nbeen lodged with the General Government; he may like better such a\r\nConstitution as we should have had under the right of State\r\ninterference; but I ask him to meet me on the plain matter of fact. I\r\nask him to meet me on the Constitution itself. I ask him if the power is\r\nnot found there, clearly and visibly found there?\r\n\r\nBut, sir, what is this danger, and what are the grounds of it? Let it be\r\nremembered that the Constitution of the United States is not\r\nunalterable. It is to continue in its present form no longer than the\r\npeople who established it shall choose to continue it. If they shall\r\nbecome convinced that they have made an injudicious or inexpedient\r\npartition and distribution of power between the State governments and\r\nthe General Government, they can alter that distribution at will.\r\n\r\nIf any thing be found in the national Constitution, either by original\r\nprovision or subsequent interpretation, which ought not to be in it, the\r\npeople know how to get rid of it. If any construction, unacceptable to\r\nthem, be established so as to become practically a part of the\r\nConstitution, they will amend it, at their own sovereign pleasure. But\r\nwhile the people choose to maintain it as it is, while they are\r\nsatisfied with it, and refuse to change it, who has given, or who can\r\ngive, to the legislatures a right to alter it, either by interference,\r\nconstruction, or otherwise? Gentlemen do not seem to recollect that the\r\npeople have any power to do any thing for themselves. They imagine there\r\nis no safety for them, any longer than they are under the close\r\nguardianship of the State legislatures. Sir, the people have not trusted\r\ntheir safety, in regard to the General Constitution, to these hands.\r\nThey have required other security, and taken other bonds. They have\r\nchosen to trust themselves, first, to the plain words of the instrument,\r\nand to such construction as the Government themselves, in doubtful\r\ncases, should put on their powers, under their oaths of office, and\r\nsubject to their responsibility to them, just as the people of a State\r\ntrust to their own governments with a similar power. Secondly, they have\r\nreposed their trust in the efficacy of frequent elections, and in their\r\nown power to remove their own servants and agents whenever they see\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThirdly, they have reposed trust in the judicial power, which, in order\r\nthat it might be trustworthy, they have made as respectable, as\r\ndisinterested, and as independent as was practicable. Fourthly, they\r\nhave seen fit to rely, in case of necessity, or high expediency, on\r\ntheir known and admitted power to alter or amend the Constitution,\r\npeaceably and quietly, whenever experience shall point out defects or\r\nimperfections. And, finally, the people of the United States have at no\r\ntime, in no way, directly or indirectly, authorized any State\r\nlegislature to construe or interpret their high instrument of\r\ngovernment; much less to interfere, by their own power, to arrest its\r\ncourse and operation.\r\n\r\nIf, sir, the people in these respects had done otherwise than they have\r\ndone, their Constitution could neither have been preserved, nor would it\r\nhave been worth preserving. And if its plain provisions shall now be\r\ndisregarded, and these new doctrines interpolated in it, it will become\r\nas feeble and helpless a being as its enemies, whether early or more\r\nrecent, could possibly desire. It will exist in every State but as a\r\npoor dependent on State permission. It must borrow leave to be; and will\r\nbe, no longer than State pleasure, or State discretion, sees fit to\r\ngrant the indulgence, and to prolong its poor existence.\r\n\r\nBut, sir, although there are fears, there are hopes also. The people\r\nhave preserved this, their own chosen Constitution, for forty years, and\r\nhave seen their happiness, prosperity, and renown grow with its growth,\r\nand strengthen with its strength. They are now, generally, strongly\r\nattached to it. Overthrown by direct assault, it cannot be; evaded,\r\nundermined, NULLIFIED, it will not be, if we, and those who shall\r\nsucceed us here, as agents and representatives of the people, shall\r\nconscientiously and vigilantly discharge the two great branches of our\r\npublic trust, faithfully to preserve and wisely to administer it.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have thus stated the reasons of my dissent to the\r\ndoctrines which have been advanced and maintained. I am conscious of\r\nhaving detained you and the Senate much too long. I was drawn into the\r\ndebate with no previous deliberation, such as is suited to the\r\ndiscussion of so grave and important a subject. But it is a subject of\r\nwhich my heart is full, and I have not been willing to suppress the\r\nutterance of its spontaneous sentiments. I cannot, even now, persuade\r\nmyself to relinquish it, without expressing, once more my deep\r\nconviction, that, since it respects nothing less than the union of the\r\nStates, it is of most vital and essential importance to the public\r\nhappiness. I profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily\r\nin view the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the\r\npreservation of our Federal Union. It is to that Union we owe our safety\r\nat home, and our consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that Union\r\nthat we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us most proud of our\r\ncountry. That Union we reached only by the discipline of our virtues in\r\nthe severe school of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities of\r\ndisordered finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined credit. Under its\r\nbenign influences, these great interests immediately awoke, as from the\r\ndead, and sprang forth with newness of life. Every year of its duration\r\nhas teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its blessings; and\r\nalthough our territory has stretched out wider and wider, and our\r\npopulation spread farther and farther, they have not outrun its\r\nprotection or its benefits. It has been to us all a copious fountain of\r\nnational, social, and personal happiness.\r\n\r\nI have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the Union, to see what\r\nmight lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have not coolly weighed\r\nthe chances of preserving liberty when the bonds that unite us together\r\nshall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself to hang over the\r\nprecipice of disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I can fathom\r\nthe depth of the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe\r\ncounsellor in the affairs of this Government, whose thoughts should be\r\nmainly bent on considering, not how the Union may be best preserved, but\r\nhow tolerable might be the condition of the people when it should be\r\nbroken up and destroyed. While the Union lasts we have high, exciting,\r\ngratifying prospects spread out before us, for us and our children.\r\nBeyond that I seek not to penetrate the veil. God grant that in my day\r\nat least that curtain may not rise! God grant that on my vision never\r\nmay be opened what lies behind! When my eyes shall be turned to behold\r\nfor the last time the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the\r\nbroken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union, on States\r\ndissevered, discordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or\r\ndrenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their last feeble and\r\nlingering glance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the Republic, now\r\nknown and honored through-out the earth, still full high advanced, its\r\narms and trophies streaming in their original lustre, not a stripe\r\nerased or polluted, not a single star obscured, bearing for its motto,\r\nno such miserable interrogotary as \"What is all this worth?\" nor those\r\nother words of delusion and folly, \"Liberty first and Union afterward\";\r\nbut everywhere, spread all over in characters of living light, blazing\r\non all its ample folds, as they float over the sea and over the land,\r\nand in every wind under the whole heavens, that other sentiment, dear to\r\nevery true American heart,--Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and\r\ninseparable!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN C. CALHOUN\r\n\r\n--OF SOUTH CAROLINA. (BORN 1782, DIED 1850.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON NULLIFICATION AND THE FORCE BILL,\r\n\r\nIN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, FEB. 15, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nAt the last session of Congress, it was avowed on all sides that the\r\npublic debt, as to all practical purposes, was in fact paid, the small\r\nsurplus remaining being nearly covered by the money in the Treasury and\r\nthe bonds for duties which had already accrued; but with the arrival of\r\nthis event our last hope was doomed to be disappointed. After a long\r\nsession of many months, and the most earnest effort on the part of South\r\nCarolina and the other Southern States to obtain relief, all that could\r\nbe effected was a small reduction in the amount of the duties, but a\r\nreduction of such a character that, while it diminished the amount of\r\nburden, it distributed that burden more unequally than even the\r\nobnoxious act of 1828; reversing the principle adopted by the bill of\r\n1816, of laying higher duties on the unprotected than the protected\r\narticles, by repealing almost entirely the duties laid upon the former,\r\nand imposing the burden almost entirely on the latter. It was thus that,\r\ninstead of relief--instead of an equal distribution of burdens and\r\nbenefits of the government, on the payment of the debt, as had been\r\nfondly anticipated,--the duties were so arranged as to be, in fact,\r\nbounties on one side and taxation on the other; thus placing the two\r\ngreat sections of the country in direct conflict in reference to its\r\nfiscal action, and thereby letting in that flood of political corruption\r\nwhich threatens to sweep away our Constitution and our liberty.\r\n\r\nThis unequal and unjust arrangement was pronounced, both by the\r\nadministration, through its proper organ, the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nand by the opposition, to be a permanent adjustment; and it was thus\r\nthat all hope of relief through the action of the General Government\r\nterminated; and the crisis so long apprehended at length arrived, at\r\nwhich the State was compelled to choose between absolute acquiescence in\r\na ruinous system of oppression, or a resort to her reserved\r\npowers--powers of which she alone was the rightful judge, and which\r\nonly, in this momentous juncture, could save her. She determined on the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe consent of two thirds of her Legislature was necessary for the call\r\nof a convention, which was considered the only legitimate organ through\r\nwhich the people, in their sovereignty, could speak. After an arduous\r\nstruggle the States-right party succeeded; more than two thirds of both\r\nbranches of the Legislature favorable to a convention were elected; a\r\nconvention was called--the ordinance adopted. The convention was\r\nsucceeded by a meeting of the Legislature, when the laws to carry the\r\nordinance into execution were enacted--all of which have been\r\ncommunicated by the President, have been referred to the Committee on\r\nthe Judiciary, and this bill is the result of their labor.\r\n\r\nHaving now corrected some of the prominent misrepresentations as to the\r\nnature of this controversy, and given a rapid sketch of the movement of\r\nthe State in reference to it, I will next proceed to notice some\r\nobjections connected with the ordinance and the proceedings under it.\r\n\r\nThe first and most prominent of these is directed against what is called\r\nthe test oath, which an effort has been made to render odious. So far\r\nfrom deserving the denunciation that has been levelled against it, I\r\nview this provision of the ordinance as but the natural result of the\r\ndoctrines entertained by the State, and the position which she occupies.\r\nThe people of Carolina believe that the Union is a union of States, and\r\nnot of individuals; that it was formed by the States, and that the\r\ncitizens of the several States were bound to it through the acts of\r\ntheir several States; that each State ratified the Constitution for\r\nitself, and that it was only by such ratification of a State that any\r\nobligation was imposed upon its citizens. Thus believing, it is the\r\nopinion of the people of Carolina that it belongs to the State which has\r\nimposed the obligation to declare, in the last resort, the extent of\r\nthis obligation, as far as her citizens are concerned; and this upon the\r\nplain principles which exist in all analogous cases of compact between\r\nsovereign bodies. On this principle the people of the State, acting in\r\ntheir sovereign capacity in convention, precisely as they did in the\r\nadoption of their own and the Federal Constitution, have declared, by\r\nthe ordinance, that the acts of Congress which imposed duties under the\r\nauthority to lay imposts, were acts not for revenue, as intended by the\r\nConstitution, but for protection, and therefore null and void. The\r\nordinance thus enacted by the people of the State themselves, acting as\r\na sovereign community, is as obligatory on the citizens of the State as\r\nany portion of the Constitution. In prescribing, then, the oath to obey\r\nthe ordinance, no more was done than to prescribe an oath to obey the\r\nConstitution. It is, in fact, but a particular oath of allegiance, and\r\nin every respect similar to that which is prescribed, under the\r\nConstitution of the United States, to be administered to all the\r\nofficers of the State and Federal Governments; and is no more deserving\r\nthe harsh and bitter epithets which have been heaped upon it than that\r\nor any similar oath. It ought to be borne in mind that, according to the\r\nopinion which prevails in Carolina, the right of resistance to the\r\nunconstitutional acts of Congress belongs to the State, and not to her\r\nindividual citizens; and that, though the latter may, in a mere question\r\nof _meum_ and _tuum_, resist through the courts an unconstitutional\r\nencroachment upon their rights, yet the final stand against usurpation\r\nrests not with them, but with the State of which they are members; and\r\nsuch act of resistance by a State binds the conscience and allegiance of\r\nthe citizen. But there appears to be a general misapprehension as to the\r\nextent to which the State has acted under this part of the ordinance.\r\nInstead of sweeping every officer by a general proscription of the\r\nminority, as has been represented in debate, as far as my knowledge\r\nextends, not a single individual has been removed. The State has, in\r\nfact, acted with the greatest tenderness, all circumstances considered,\r\ntoward citizens who differed from the majority; and, in that spirit, has\r\ndirected the oath to be administered only in the case of some official\r\nact directed to be performed in which obedience to the ordinance is\r\ninvolved. * * *'\r\n\r\nIt is next objected that the enforcing acts, have legislated the United\r\nStates out of South Carolina. I have already replied to this objection\r\non another occasion, and will now but repeat what I then said: that they\r\nhave been legislated out only to the extent that they had no right to\r\nenter. The Constitution has admitted the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates within the limits of the several States only so far as the\r\ndelegated powers authorize; beyond that they are intruders, and may\r\nrightfully be expelled; and that they have been efficiently expelled by\r\nthe legislation of the State through her civil process, as has been\r\nacknowledged on all sides in the debate, is only a confirmation of the\r\ntruth of the doctrine for which the majority in Carolina have contended.\r\n\r\nThe very point at issue between the two parties there is, whether\r\nnullification is a peaceful and an efficient remedy against an\r\nunconstitutional act of the General Government, and may be asserted, as\r\nsuch, through the State tribunals. Both parties agree that the acts\r\nagainst which it is directed are unconstitutional and oppressive. The\r\ncontroversy is only as to the means by which our citizens may be\r\nprotected against the acknowledged encroachments on their rights. This\r\nbeing the point at issue between the parties, and the very object of the\r\nmajority being an efficient protection of the citizens through the State\r\ntribunals, the measures adopted to enforce the ordinance, of course\r\nreceived the most decisive character. We were not children, to act by\r\nhalves. Yet for acting thus efficiently the State is denounced, and this\r\nbill reported, to overrule, by military force, the civil tribunal and\r\ncivil process of the State! Sir, I consider this bill, and the arguments\r\nwhich have been urged on this floor in its support, as the most\r\ntriumphant acknowledgment that nullification is peaceful and efficient,\r\nand so deeply intrenched in the principles of our system, that it cannot\r\nbe assailed but by prostrating the Constitution, and substituting the\r\nsupremacy of military force in lieu of the supremacy of the laws. In\r\nfact, the advocates of this bill refute their own argument. They tell us\r\nthat the ordinance is unconstitutional; that it infracts the\r\nconstitution of South Carolina, although, to me, the objection appears\r\nabsurd, as it was adopted by the very authority which adopted the\r\nconstitution itself. They also tell us that the Supreme Court is the\r\nappointed arbiter of all controversies between a State and the General\r\nGovernment. Why, then, do they not leave this controversy to that\r\ntribunal? Why do they not confide to them the abrogation of the\r\nordinance, and the laws made in pursuance of it, and the assertion of\r\nthat supremacy which they claim for the laws of Congress? The State\r\nstands pledged to resist no process of the court. Why, then, confer on\r\nthe President the extensive and unlimited powers provided in this bill?\r\nWhy authorize him to use military force to arrest the civil process of\r\nthe State? But one answer can be given: That, in a contest between the\r\nState and the General Government, if the resistance be limited on both\r\nsides to the civil process, the State, by its inherent sovereignty,\r\nstanding upon its reserved powers, will prove too powerful in such a\r\ncontroversy, and must triumph over the Federal Government, sustained by\r\nits delegated and limited authority; and in this answer we have an\r\nacknowledgment of the truth of those great principles for which the\r\nState has so firmly and nobly contended. * * *\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been said, I may say that neither the\r\nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Clayton), nor any other who has spoken on the\r\nsame side, has directly and fairly met the great question at issue: Is\r\nthis a Federal Union? a union of States, as distinct from that of\r\nindividuals? Is the sovereignty in the several States, or in the\r\nAmerican people in the aggregate? The very language which we are\r\ncompelled to use when speaking of our political institutions, affords\r\nproof conclusive as to its real character. The terms union, federal,\r\nunited, all imply a combination of sovereignties, a confederation of\r\nStates. They never apply to an association of individuals. Who ever\r\nheard of the United State of New York, of Massachusetts, or of Virginia?\r\nWho ever heard the term federal or union applied to the aggregation of\r\nindividuals into one community? Nor is the other point less clear--that\r\nthe sovereignty is in the several States, and that our system is a union\r\nof twenty-four sovereign powers, under a constitutional compact, and not\r\nof a divided sovereignty between the States severally and the United\r\nStates? In spite of all that has been said, I maintain that sovereignty\r\nis in its nature indivisible. It is the supreme power in a State, and we\r\nmight just as well speak of half a square, or half of a triangle, as of\r\nhalf a sovereignty. It is a gross error to confound the exercise of\r\nsovereign powers with sovereignty itself, or the delegation of such\r\npowers with the surrender of them. A sovereign may delegate his powers\r\nto be exercised by as many agents as he may think proper, under such\r\nconditions and with such limitations as he may impose; but to surrender\r\nany portion of his sovereignty to another is to annihilate the whole.\r\nThe Senator from Delaware (Mr. Clayton) calls this metaphysical\r\nreasoning, which he says he cannot comprehend. If by metaphysics he\r\nmeans that scholastic refinement which makes distinctions without\r\ndifference, no one can hold it in more utter contempt than I do; but if,\r\non the contrary, he means the power of analysis and combination--that\r\npower which reduces the most complex idea into its elements, which\r\ntraces causes to their first principle, and, by the power of\r\ngeneralization and combination, unites the whole in one harmonious\r\nsystem--then, so far from deserving contempt, it is the highest\r\nattribute of the human mind. It is the power which raises man above the\r\nbrute--which distinguishes his faculties from mere sagacity, which he\r\nholds in common with inferior animals. It is this power which has raised\r\nthe astronomer from being a mere gazer at the stars to the high\r\nintellectual eminence of a Newton or a Laplace, and astronomy itself\r\nfrom a mere observation of insulated facts into that noble science which\r\ndisplays to our admiration the system of the universe. And shall this\r\nhigh power of the mind, which has effected such wonders when directed to\r\nthe laws which control the material world, be forever prohibited, under\r\na senseless cry of metaphysics, from being applied to the high purposes\r\nof political science and legislation? I hold them to be subject to laws\r\nas fixed as matter itself, and to be as fit a subject for the\r\napplication of the highest intellectual power. Denunciation may, indeed\r\nfall upon the philosophical inquirer into these first principles, as it\r\ndid upon Galileo and Bacon, when they first unfolded the great\r\ndiscoveries which have immortalized their names; but the time will come\r\nwhen truth will prevail in spite of prejudice and denunciation, and when\r\npolitics and legislation will be considered as much a science as\r\nastronomy and chemistry.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this part of the subject, I understood the Senator\r\nfrom Virginia (Mr. Rives) to say that sovereignty was divided, and that\r\na portion remained with the States severally, and that the residue was\r\nvested in the Union. By Union, I suppose the Senator meant the United\r\nStates. If such be his meaning--if he intended to affirm that the\r\nsovereignty was in the twenty-four States, in whatever light he may view\r\nthem, our opinions will not disagree; but according to my conception,\r\nthe whole sovereignty is in the several States, while the exercise of\r\nsovereign power is divided--a part being exercised under compact,\r\nthrough this General Government, and the residue through the separate\r\nState Governments. But if the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Rives) means to\r\nassert that the twenty-four States form but one community, with a single\r\nsovereign power as to the objects of the Union, it will be but the\r\nrevival of the old question, of whether the Union is a union between\r\nStates, as distinct communities, or a mere aggregate of the American\r\npeople, as a mass of individuals; and in this light his opinions would\r\nlead directly to consolidation. * * *\r\n\r\nDisguise it as you may, the controversy is one between power and\r\nliberty; and I tell the gentlemen who are opposed to me, that, as strong\r\nas may be the love of power on their side, the love of liberty is still\r\nstronger on ours. History furnishes many instances of similar struggles,\r\nwhere the love of liberty has prevailed against power under every\r\ndisadvantage, and among them few more striking than that of our own\r\nRevolution; where, as strong as was the parent country, and feeble as\r\nwere the colonies, yet, under the impulse of liberty, and the blessing\r\nof God, they gloriously triumphed in the contest. There are, indeed,\r\nmany striking analogies between that and the present controversy. They\r\nboth originated substantially in the same cause--with this\r\ndifference--in the present case, the power of taxation is converted into\r\nthat of regulating industry; in the other, the power of regulating\r\nindustry, by the regulation of commerce, was attempted to be converted\r\ninto the power of taxation. Were I to trace the analogy further, we\r\nshould find that the perversion of the taxing power, in the one case,\r\nhas given precisely the same control to the Northern section over the\r\nindustry of the Southern section of the Union, which the power to\r\nregulate commerce gave to Great Britain over the industry of the\r\ncolonies in the other; and that the very articles in which the colonies\r\nwere permitted to have a free trade, and those in which the\r\nmother-country had a monopoly, are almost identically the same as those\r\nin which the Southern States are permitted to have a free trade by the\r\nact of 1832, and in which the Northern States have, by the same act,\r\nsecured a monopoly. The only difference is in the means. In the former,\r\nthe colonies were permitted to have a free trade with all countries\r\nsouth of Cape Finisterre, a cape in the northern part of Spain; while\r\nnorth of that, the trade of the colonies was prohibited, except through\r\nthe mother-country, by means of her commercial regulations. If we\r\ncompare the products of the country north and south of Cape Finisterre,\r\nwe shall find them almost identical with the list of the protected and\r\nunprotected articles contained in the list of last year. Nor does the\r\nanalogy terminate here. The very arguments resorted to at the\r\ncommencement of the American Revolution, and the measures adopted, and\r\nthe motives assigned to bring on that contest (to enforce the law), are\r\nalmost identically the same.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression to the consideration of the bill.\r\nWhatever difference of opinion may exist upon other points, there is one\r\non which I should suppose there can be none; that this bill rests upon\r\nprinciples which, if carried out, will ride over State sovereignties,\r\nand that it will be idle for any advocates hereafter to talk of State\r\nrights. The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Rives) says that he is the\r\nadvocate of State rights; but he must permit me to tell him that,\r\nalthough he may differ in premises from the other gentlemen with whom he\r\nacts on this occasion, yet, in supporting this bill, he obliterates\r\nevery vestige of distinction between him and them, saving only that,\r\nprofessing the principles of '98, his example will be more pernicious\r\nthan that of the most open and bitter opponent of the rights of the\r\nStates. I will also add, what I am compelled to say, that I must\r\nconsider him (Mr. Rives) as less consistent than our old opponents,\r\nwhose conclusions were fairly drawn from their premises, while his\r\npremises ought to have led him to opposite conclusions. The gentleman\r\nhas told us that the new-fangled doctrines, as he chooses to call them,\r\nhave brought State rights into disrepute. I must tell him, in reply,\r\nthat what he calls new-fangled are but the doctrines of '98; and that it\r\nis he (Mr. Rives), and others with him, who, professing these doctrines,\r\nhave degraded them by explaining away their meaning and efficacy. He\r\n(Mr. R.) has disclaimed, in behalf of Virginia, the authorship of\r\nnullification. I will not dispute that point. If Virginia chooses to\r\nthrow away one of her brightest ornaments, she must not hereafter\r\ncomplain that it has become the property of another. But while I have,\r\nas a representative of Carolina, no right to complain of the disavowal\r\nof the Senator from Virginia, I must believe that he (Mr. R.) has done\r\nhis native State great injustice by declaring on this floor, that when\r\nshe gravely resolved, in '98, that \"in cases of deliberate and dangerous\r\ninfractions of the Constitution, the States, as parties to the compact,\r\nhave the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose to arrest the\r\nprogress of the evil, and to maintain within their respective limits the\r\nauthorities, rights, and liberties appertaining to them,\" she meant no\r\nmore than to proclaim the right to protest and to remonstrate. To\r\nsuppose that, in putting forth so solemn a declaration, which she\r\nafterward sustained by so able and elaborate an argument, she meant no\r\nmore than to assert what no one had ever denied, would be to suppose\r\nthat the State had been guilty of the most egregious trifling that ever\r\nwas exhibited on so solemn an occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS H. BENTON, OF MISSOURI. (BORN 1782, DIED 1858.)\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EXPUNGING RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n--UNITED STATES SENATE, JANUARY 12, 1837\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:\r\n\r\nIt is now near three years since the resolve was adopted by the Senate,\r\nwhich it is my present motion to expunge from the journal. At the moment\r\nthat this resolve was adopted, I gave notice of my intention to move to\r\nexpunge it; and then expressed my confident belief that the motion would\r\neventually prevail. That expression of confidence was not an ebullition\r\nof vanity, or a presumptuous calculation, intended to accelerate the\r\nevent it affected to foretell. It was not a vain boast, or an idle\r\nassumption, but was the result of a deep conviction of the injustice\r\ndone President Jackson, and a thorough reliance upon the justice of the\r\nAmerican people. I felt that the President had been wronged; and my\r\nheart told me that this wrong would be redressed! The event proves that\r\nI was not mistaken. The question of expunging this resolution has been\r\ncarried to the people, and their decision has been had upon it. They\r\ndecide in favor of the expurgation; and their decision has been both\r\nmade and manifested, and communicated to us in a great variety of ways.\r\nA great number of States have expressly instructed their senators to\r\nvote for this expurgation. A very great majority of the States have\r\nelected senators and representatives to Congress, upon the express\r\nground of favoring this expurgation. The Bank of the United States,\r\nwhich took the initiative in the accusation against the President, and\r\nfurnished the material, and worked the machinery which was used against\r\nhim, and which was then so powerful on this floor, has become more and\r\nmore odious to the public mind, and musters now but a slender phalanx of\r\nfriends in the two Houses of Congress. The late Presidential election\r\nfurnishes additional evidence of public sentiment. The candidate who was\r\nthe friend of President Jackson, the supporter of his administration,\r\nand the avowed advocate for the expurgation, has received a large\r\nmajority of the suffrages of the whole Union, and that after an express\r\ndeclaration of his sentiments on this precise point. The evidence of the\r\npublic will, exhibited in all these forms, is too manifest to be\r\nmistaken, too explicit to require illustration, and too imperative to be\r\ndisregarded. Omitting details and specific enumeration of proofs, I\r\nrefer to our own files for the instructions to expunge,--to the\r\ncomplexion of the two Houses for the temper of the people,--to the\r\ndenationalized condition of the Bank of the United States for the fate\r\nof the imperious accuser,--and to the issue of the Presidential election\r\nfor the answer of the Union.\r\n\r\nAll these are pregnant proofs of the public will, and the last\r\npreeminently so: because, both the question of the expurgation, and the\r\nform of the process, were directly put in issue upon it. * * *\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, that we have ascertained the will of the people on this\r\ngreat question, the inquiry presents itself, how far the expression of\r\nthat will ought to be conclusive of our action here. I hold that it\r\nought to be binding and obligatory upon us; and that, not only upon the\r\nprinciples of representative government, which requires obedience to the\r\nknown will of the people, but also in conformity to the principles upon\r\nwhich the proceeding against President Jackson was conducted when the\r\nsentence against him was adopted. Then everything was done with especial\r\nreference to the will of the people. Their impulsion was assumed to be\r\nthe sole motive to action; and to them the ultimate verdict was\r\nexpressly referred. The whole machinery of alarm and pressure--every\r\nengine of political and moneyed power--was put in motion, and worked for\r\nmany months, to excite the people against the President; and to stir up\r\nmeetings, memorials, petitions, travelling committees, and distress\r\ndeputations against him; and each symptom of popular discontent was\r\nhailed as an evidence of public will, and quoted here as proof that the\r\npeople demanded the condemnation of the President. Not only legislative\r\nassemblies, and memorials from large assemblies, were then produced here\r\nas evidence of public opinion, but the petitions of boys under age, the\r\nremonstrances of a few signers, and the results of the most\r\ninconsiderable elections were ostentatiously paraded and magnified, as\r\nthe evidence of the sovereign will of our constituents. Thus, sir, the\r\npublic voice was everything, while that voice, partially obtained\r\nthrough political and pecuniary machinations, was adverse to the\r\nPresident. Then the popular will was the shrine at which all worshipped.\r\nNow, when that will is regularly, soberly, repeatedly, and almost\r\nuniversally expressed through the ballot-boxes, at the various\r\nelections, and turns out to be in favor of the President, certainly no\r\none can disregard it, nor otherwise look at it than as the solemn\r\nverdict of the competent and ultimate tribunal upon an issue fairly made\r\nup, fully argued, and duly submitted for decision. As such verdict, I\r\nreceive it. As the deliberate verdict of the sovereign people, I bow to\r\nit. I am content. I do not mean to reopen the case nor to re-commence\r\nthe argument. I leave that work to others, if any others choose to\r\nperform it. For myself, I am content; and, dispensing with further\r\nargument, I shall call for judgment, and ask to have execution done,\r\nupon that unhappy journal, which the verdict of millions of freemen\r\nfinds guilty of bearing on its face an untrue, illegal, and\r\nunconstitutional sentence of condemnation against the approved President\r\nof the Republic.\r\n\r\nBut, while declining to reopen the argument of this question, and\r\nrefusing to tread over again the ground already traversed, there is\r\nanother and a different task to perform; one which the approaching\r\ntermination of President Jackson's administration makes peculiarly\r\nproper at this time, and which it is my privilege, and perhaps my duty,\r\nto execute, as being the suitable conclusion to the arduous contest in\r\nwhich we have been so long engaged. I allude to the general tenor of his\r\nadministration, and to its effect, for good or for evil, upon the\r\ncondition of his country. This is the proper time for such a view to be\r\ntaken. The political existence of this great man now draws to a close.\r\nIn little more than forty days he ceases to be an object of political\r\nhope to any, and should cease to be an object of political hate, or\r\nenvy, to all. Whatever of motive the servile and time-serving might have\r\nfound in his exalted station for raising the altar of adulation, and\r\nburning the incense of praise before him, that motive can no longer\r\nexist. The dispenser of the patronage of an empire, the chief of this\r\ngreat confederacy of States, is soon to be a private individual,\r\nstripped of all power to reward, or to punish. His own thoughts, as he\r\nhas shown us in the concluding paragraph of that message which is to be\r\nthe last of its kind that we shall ever receive from him, are directed\r\nto that beloved retirement from which he was drawn by the voice of\r\nmillions of freemen, and to which he now looks for that interval of\r\nrepose which age and infirmities require. Under these circumstances, he\r\nceases to be a subject for the ebullition of the passions, and passes\r\ninto a character for the contemplation of history. Historically, then,\r\nshall I view him; and limiting this view to his civil administration, I\r\ndemand, where is there a chief magistrate of whom so much evil has been\r\npredicted, and from whom so much good has come? Never has any man\r\nentered upon the chief magistracy of a country under such appalling\r\npredictions of ruin and woe! never has any one been so pursued with\r\ndireful prognostications! never has any one been so beset and impeded by\r\na powerful combination of political and moneyed confederates! never has\r\nany one in any country where the administration of justice has risen\r\nabove the knife or the bowstring, been so lawlessly and shamelessly\r\ntried and condemned by rivals and enemies, without hearing, without\r\ndefence, without the forms of law and justice! History has been\r\nransacked to find examples of tyrants sufficiently odious to illustrate\r\nhim by comparison. Language has been tortured to find epithets\r\nsufficiently strong to paint him in description. Imagination has been\r\nexhausted in her efforts to deck him with revolting and inhuman\r\nattributes. Tyrant, despot, usurper; destroyer of the liberties of his\r\ncountry; rash, ignorant, imbecile; endangering the public peace with all\r\nforeign nations; destroying domestic prosperity at home; ruining all\r\nindustry, all commerce, all manufactures; annihilating confidence\r\nbetween man and man; delivering up the streets of populous cities to\r\ngrass and weeds, and the wharves of commercial towns to the encumbrance\r\nof decaying vessels; depriving labor of all reward; depriving industry\r\nof all employment; destroying the currency; plunging an innocent and\r\nhappy people from the summit of felicity to the depths of misery, want,\r\nand despair. Such is the faint outline, followed up by actual\r\ncondemnation, of the appalling denunciations daily uttered against this\r\none MAN, from the moment he became an object of political competition,\r\ndown to the concluding moment of his political existence.\r\n\r\nThe sacred voice of inspiration has told us that there is a time for all\r\nthings. There certainly has been a time for every evil that human nature\r\nadmits of to be vaticinated of President Jackson's administration;\r\nequally certain the time has now come for all rational and well-disposed\r\npeople to compare the predictions with the facts, and to ask themselves\r\nif these calamitous prognostications have been verified by events? Have\r\nwe peace, or war, with foreign nations? Certainly, we have peace with\r\nall the world! peace with all its benign, and felicitous, and\r\nbeneficent influences! Are we respected, or despised abroad? Certainly\r\nthe American name never was more honored throughout the four quarters of\r\nthe globe than in this very moment. Do we hear of indignity or outrage\r\nin any quarter? of merchants robbed in foreign ports? of vessels\r\nsearched on the high seas? of American citizens impressed into foreign\r\nservice? of the national flag insulted anywhere? On the contrary, we see\r\nformer wrongs repaired; no new ones inflicted. France pays twenty-five\r\nmillions of francs for spoliations committed thirty years ago; Naples\r\npays two millions one hundred thousand ducats for wrongs of the same\r\ndate; Denmark pays six hundred and fifty thousand rix-dollars for wrongs\r\ndone a quarter of a century ago; Spain engages to pay twelve millions of\r\nreals vellon for injuries of fifteen years' date; and Portugal, the last\r\nin the list of former aggressors, admits her liability and only waits\r\nthe adjustment of details to close her account by adequate indemnity. So\r\nfar from war, insult, contempt, and spoliation from abroad, this\r\ndenounced administration has been the season of peace and good will and\r\nthe auspicious era of universal reparation. So far from suffering injury\r\nat the hands of foreign powers, our merchants have received indemnities\r\nfor all former injuries. It has been the day of accounting, of\r\nsettlement, and of retribution. The total list of arrearages, extending\r\nthrough four successive previous administrations, has been closed and\r\nsettled up. The wrongs done to commerce for thirty years back, and under\r\nso many different Presidents, and indemnities withheld from all, have\r\nbeen repaired and paid over under the beneficent and glorious\r\nadministration of President Jackson. But one single instance of outrage\r\nhas occurred, and that at the extremities of the world, and by a\r\npiratical horde, amenable to no law but the law of force. The Malays of\r\nSumatra committed a robbery and massacre upon an American vessel.\r\nWretches! they did not then know that JACKSON was President of the\r\nUnited States! and that no distance, no time, no idle ceremonial of\r\ntreating with robbers and assassins, was to hold back the arm of\r\njustice. Commodore Downes went out. His cannon and his bayonets struck\r\nthe outlaws in their den. They paid in terror and in blood for the\r\noutrage which was committed; and the great lesson was taught to these\r\ndistant pirates--to our antipodes themselves,--that not even the entire\r\ndiameter of this globe could protect them, and that the name of American\r\ncitizen, like that of Roman citizen in the great days of the Republic\r\nand of the empire, was to be the inviolable passport of all that wore it\r\nthroughout the whole extent of the habitable world. * * *\r\n\r\nFrom President Jackson, the country has first learned the true theory\r\nand practical intent of the Constitution, in giving to the Executive a\r\nqualified negative on the legislative power of Congress. Far from being\r\nan odious, dangerous, or kingly prerogative, this power, as vested in\r\nthe President, is nothing but a qualified copy of the famous veto power\r\nvested in the tribunes of the people among the Romans, and intended to\r\nsuspend the passage of a law until the people themselves should have\r\ntime to consider it? The qualified veto of the President destroys\r\nnothing; it only delays the passage of a law, and refers it to the\r\npeople for their consideration and decision. It is the reference of a\r\nlaw, not to a committee of the House, or of the whole House, but to the\r\ncommittee of the whole Union. It is a recommitment of the bill to the\r\npeople, for them to examine and consider; and if, upon this examination,\r\nthey are content to pass it, it will pass at the next session. The delay\r\nof a few months is the only effect of a veto, in a case where the people\r\nshall ultimately approve a law; where they do not approve it, the\r\ninterposition of the veto is the barrier which saves them the adoption\r\nof a law, the repeal of which might afterwards be almost impossible. The\r\nqualified negative is, therefore, a beneficent power, intended as\r\nGeneral Hamilton expressly declares in the Federalist, to protect,\r\nfirst, the executive department from the encroachments of the\r\nlegislative department; and, secondly, to preserve the people from\r\nhasty, dangerous, or criminal legislation on the part of their\r\nrepresentatives. This is the design and intention of the veto power; and\r\nthe fear expressed by General Hamilton was, that Presidents, so far from\r\nexercising it too often, would not exercise it as often as the safety of\r\nthe people required; that they might lack the moral courage to stake\r\nthemselves in opposition to a favorite measure of the majority of the\r\ntwo Houses of Congress; and thus deprive the people, in many instances,\r\nof their right to pass upon a bill before it becomes a final law. The\r\ncases in which President Jackson has exercised the veto power have shown\r\nthe soundness of these observations. No ordinary President would have\r\nstaked himself against the Bank of the United States and the two Houses\r\nof Congress in 1832. It required President Jackson to confront that\r\npower--to stem that torrent--to stay the progress of that charter, and\r\nto refer it to the people for their decision. His moral courage was\r\nequal to the crisis. He arrested the charter until it could be got to\r\nthe people, and they have arrested it forever. Had he not done so, the\r\ncharter would have become law, and its repeal almost impossible. The\r\npeople of the whole Union would now have been in the condition of the\r\npeople of Pennsylvania, bestrode by the monster, in daily conflict with\r\nhim, and maintaining a doubtful contest for supremacy between the\r\ngovernment of a State and the directory of a moneyed corporation.\r\n\r\nSir, I think it right, in approaching the termination of this great\r\nquestion, to present this faint and rapid sketch of the brilliant,\r\nbeneficent, and glorious administration of President Jackson. It is not\r\nfor me to attempt to do it justice; it is not for ordinary men to\r\nattempt its history. His military life, resplendent with dazzling\r\nevents, will demand the pen of a nervous writer; his civil\r\nadministration, replete with scenes which have called into action so\r\nmany and such various passions of the human heart, and which has given\r\nto native sagacity so many victories over practised politicians, will\r\nrequire the profound, luminous, and philosophical conceptions of a Livy,\r\na Plutarch, or a Sallust. This history is not to be written in our day.\r\nThe contemporaries of such events are not the hands to describe them.\r\nTime must first do its office--must silence the passions, remove the\r\nactors, develop consequences, and canonize all that is sacred to honor,\r\npatriotism, and glory. In after ages the historic genius of our America\r\nshall produce the writers which the subject demands--men far removed\r\nfrom the contests of this day, who will know how to estimate this great\r\nepoch, and how to acquire an immortality for their own names by\r\npainting, with a master's hand, the immortal events of the patriot\r\nPresident's life.\r\n\r\nAnd now, sir, I finish the task which, three years ago, I imposed on\r\nmyself. Solitary and alone, and amidst the jeers and taunts of my\r\nopponents, I put this ball in motion. The people have taken it up, and\r\nrolled it forward, and I am no longer anything but a unit in the vast\r\nmass which now propels it. In the name of that mass I speak. I demand\r\nthe execution of the edict of the people; I demand the expurgation of\r\nthat sentence which the voice of a few senators, and the power of their\r\nconfederate, the Bank of the United States, has caused to be placed on\r\nthe journal of the Senate; and which the voice of millions of freemen\r\nhas ordered to be expunged from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's American Eloquence, Volume I.
