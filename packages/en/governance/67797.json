WATSON\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sam Spencer_\r\n\r\nNot long ago the Voting Trustees of the Southern Railway Company wrote to\r\nSamuel Spencer, President of that robber combine, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“We congratulate you upon the success achieved in the extension and\r\noperation of the property which have resulted in nearly doubling the\r\nextent of its lines, trebling its gross earnings, and increasing its\r\nnet earnings above fixed charges, _over five hundred and twenty-five\r\nper cent._ in the period of eleven years which have elapsed since its\r\nformation.”\r\n\r\nBully for Sam!\r\n\r\nHe set out to please the men who bought him, and he has done it.\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street rascals who grabbed up the railroads in the Southern\r\nStates knew very well that they themselves could not do the work which\r\nwas required for the success of their schemes. The Belmonts and the\r\nMorgans could not in person approach the editors, the politicians, the\r\nlegislators and the federal judges.\r\n\r\nStrategy requires that local men be used in the looting of any given\r\nstate or section. One traitor inside the citadel is worth ten thousand\r\nsoldiers on the outside, when the object is to take the citadel. To bribe\r\nsomebody from within to open the gates is far more effective, vastly more\r\nto be desired, than to attempt to breach the walls or batter down the\r\ngates.\r\n\r\nConsequently when Western states are to be plundered, the Wall\r\nStreet corporations use Western men as their tools. Local Western\r\ncorruptionists sell out to Wall Street, and do in Western states the\r\ndirty work of their Wall Street masters.\r\n\r\nSo in the South, the Wall Street robber-gangs do not operate in person;\r\nthey act through Southern agents.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this subtle policy, the Wall Street corporations, who\r\ngobbled up the various lines which now compose the Southern Railway\r\nSystem, put at the head of it a Southern man, a Georgian, of the name of\r\nSamuel Spencer.\r\n\r\nThey chose wisely. They generally choose wisely. The expert workman does\r\nnot better know how to select his tools than such men as Belmont, Morgan,\r\nRyan, Rogers and Rockefeller know how to pick out the men who can do what\r\nWall Street expects.\r\n\r\nThe Wall Street rascals had faith in Sam Spencer, and Sam has justified\r\nthat confidence.\r\n\r\nNever did any robber-chief have an abler lieutenant than Belmont, the\r\nRothschild agent, has had in Sam.\r\n\r\nThe task to which they set him was hard. It demanded that he freeze his\r\nheart and stifle his conscience. It demanded that he shut out from his\r\nview of life every other purpose whatsoever, save the heaping up of\r\ndividends for a ravenous gang of Wall Street rascals.\r\n\r\nTo make his work seem good in the sight of the men who had bought him it\r\nwas necessary that he combine railroads which the law said should not be\r\ncombined, that he destroy competition where the law said it should live,\r\nthat he charge excessive rates to shippers and passengers when the law\r\nsaid the rates should be reasonable.\r\n\r\nHe has done this in spite of the law, in spite of the people.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “One traitor inside the citadel is worth ten thousand\r\nsoldiers on the outside.”]\r\n\r\nEditors have been bribed into collusion or silence; politicians have been\r\nsoftened with boodle; lobbyists have been kept in clover; legislators\r\nhave been duped or corrupted. Railroad Commissions have been seduced or\r\ndefied, federal judges have been mellowed with favors, blandishments,\r\nindirect temptings which poor human nature can seldom resist.\r\n\r\nBully for Sam!\r\n\r\nHe is victorious all along the line. From Washington City he rules the\r\nSouth. In his native State of Georgia he is monarch of all he surveys.\r\nHe made Terrell governor, and he means to make Howell governor. He\r\ncontrolled nearly all the daily papers, but he wanted another—so he had\r\nJim English to cut the ground from under the feet of John Temple Graves\r\nand scoop the _Atlanta News_.\r\n\r\nHamp McWhorter is his hireling, and Hamp keeps the mechanism of\r\ncorruption oiled. Hamp keeps the Legislature in pliant mood. Hamp jollies\r\nand greases the local politician. Hamp peddles the free passes. Hamp\r\npicks and chooses the “local attorneys.” Hamp “sees” the editor who\r\nappears to require “seeing.”\r\n\r\nBut the Brain and Will of the whole plot are those of Sam Spencer.\r\n\r\nFor eleven years that God-given brain and will have been concentrated\r\nupon one purpose, only one—to heap up riches for Wall Street rascals!\r\nGreat has been the result. Sam Spencer’s masters are so highly pleased\r\nwith his work that THEY congratulate HIM!\r\n\r\nHow interesting! It seems to me that _they_ are the fellows to be\r\ncongratulated. Sam has doubled the amount of their property, he has\r\ntrebled the gross income from that property, and has increased their\r\n_net_ revenues _over 525 per cent_!\r\n\r\nColossal profits these. _How were they made?_\r\n\r\nBy such a system of dishonesty, extortion, law-breaking, and reckless\r\ndisregard of human life as has rarely been known, even in the history of\r\nmodern commercialism.\r\n\r\nThe merchants and farmers throughout the Southern States have been\r\nruthlessly robbed. The melon growers, the fruit men, the truck gardeners\r\nhave, in thousands of cases, been so hounded and harried and victimized\r\nby excessive charges, secret rebates and discriminations in favor of\r\nother shippers, that they have been literally driven out of the field,\r\nbroken and despairing.\r\n\r\nRoadbeds, bridges, safety appliances, have been so wantonly neglected\r\nthat almost every mile of the Southern Railway System from Washington\r\nsouthward has known its tragedy, where men, women and children were\r\ndashed to sudden, horrible death.\r\n\r\nIt was not the hard necessity of poverty that drove Sam Spencer to a\r\npolicy so heartless as this. He had the means wherewith to put his roads\r\nin first-class order, had he wished to spend the funds in that way. It\r\nwas not necessary for him to rob the men who were obliged to patronize\r\nhis roads. If a fair, legitimate profit upon actual investment was\r\nall that he sought, he could have got it without doing the slightest\r\ninjustice to any human being.\r\n\r\nBut he wanted more than that. A reasonable return upon the actual\r\ninvestment was not enough. So, he neglected the bridge until it fell,\r\nwith its sickening horror, its shrieking mass of passengers doomed to\r\nfrightful death. He neglected the safety appliances, and the full force\r\nof workmen, until some rotten crosstie, or defective rail, or open\r\nswitch, or telegram which the dulled brain of an overworked engineer\r\nfailed to comprehend, brought about derailments and collisions, with the\r\nheartrending consequence of crushed and burning cars, of crushed and\r\nburning men, women and children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The merchants and farmers throughout the Southern states\r\nhave been ruthlessly robbed.”]\r\n\r\nHad the same proportion of the earnings been used to improve the\r\nproperty, as is the universal custom in Europe, there would have been the\r\nsame security to the passenger that there is in Europe.\r\n\r\nBut the net profit to Wall Street would have been only a fair return upon\r\nthe money actually invested—as it is in Europe.\r\n\r\nWall Street demands more than that. Sam Spencer’s task was to get what\r\nWall Street wanted.\r\n\r\nHave I not already said that Wall Street knows how to pick out its man?\r\n\r\nIt never chose a better tool for its purpose than Sam Spencer.\r\n\r\nHe has doubled the _amount_ of their property.\r\n\r\nThat is good.\r\n\r\nBut he has done better than that.\r\n\r\nHe has trebled the gross earnings.\r\n\r\nAnd that is good, too.\r\n\r\nBut he has done still better than that.\r\n\r\nHe has increased the NET earnings more than FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE\r\nPER CENT!\r\n\r\nGood, _better_, BEST.\r\n\r\nThat enormous profit had to be made out of somebody.\r\n\r\nFreight rates and passenger rates are taxes which the transportation\r\ncompanies levy upon freight and passengers. When Sam Spencer added 525\r\nper cent. to the net revenue of his masters, he had to tax it out of the\r\npeople who patronized the Southern Railroad.\r\n\r\nWho were these people? Mostly, Southern people. The tax was levied upon\r\nthe South, and paid by the South.\r\n\r\nSam Spencer is a Southern man?\r\n\r\nBless you, yes!\r\n\r\nWall Street hired him to systematize the robbery of his own people, and\r\nhe has done it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “We lost fewer lives to the invading host of Sherman than\r\nwe have lost to the railroads under Sam Spencer.”]\r\n\r\nDuring the eleven years of his rule he has plundered his own people of\r\nmore money than they lost by Sherman’s “Marching through Georgia.”\r\n\r\nThe people of the South have lost more to the Wall Street railway\r\ncorporations than they lost to the whole of Sherman’s army.\r\n\r\nThe battles of the Civil War were bloody, for it was Greek meet Greek,\r\nand it was, in truth, the tug of war. Especially were the battles bloody\r\nwhen Sherman came down against us, for he brought Western troops—the best\r\nthat the Union had.\r\n\r\nBut we lost fewer lives to the invading host of Sherman than we have lost\r\nto the railroads during the eleven years that Sam Spencer has been one\r\nof their most relentless and unscrupulous lieutenants.\r\n\r\nHe and his allies in plunder and crime killed and wounded, last year, the\r\nstaggering total of 92,000 human beings.\r\n\r\nThe ghastly record grows bloodier every year.\r\n\r\nHuman life is nothing; dividends are everything.\r\n\r\n_Five hundred and twenty-five per cent!_\r\n\r\nAnd Sam Spencer’s bosses pat _him_ on the back and congratulate _him_.\r\n\r\nAh, yes; they were feeling good. They expanded. They bubbled over.\r\n\r\nAs who should say: “Sam, you are a trump. When we bought you, we believed\r\nwe had bought a good thing; now we know it. You have been tried, and you\r\nhave proven true. We set you to the task of plundering your own people,\r\nand you have not flinched from the job. You have skinned them to the\r\nqueen’s taste. You have doubled our estate, trebled the earnings, and so\r\nsqueezed the train-crews, the section hands, the roadbed, the shipper and\r\nthe passenger, that you have swelled our profits more than 525 per cent.\r\nWe congratulate _you_—and, WE pocket the money.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ungrateful Negro_\r\n\r\n_From a Newspaper_\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN FLAG INSULTED BY NEGRO BISHOP IN MACON.\r\n\r\nDENOUNCED GLORIOUS EMBLEM AS A CONTEMPTIBLE RAG AT THE STATE NEGRO\r\nCONVENTION.\r\n\r\nMACON, GA., Feb. 16.—In an address before the five hundred delegates\r\nattending the convention of negroes in this city to discuss racial\r\nproblems, Bishop H. M. Turner declared the American Flag to be a dirty\r\nand contemptible rag. He further said that hell was an improvement on the\r\nUnited States when the negro was involved.\r\n\r\nIn closing he said:\r\n\r\n    “I have heard of both white and black men perpetrating rape\r\n    upon innocent, angelic women, but no negro in this country has\r\n    been tried by the courts and found guilty of the heinous crime\r\n    of rape in fifteen years.\r\n\r\n    “I know that bloody-handed and drunken mobs have said so, but\r\n    what Christian people would accept what they say? Yet there\r\n    are millions of men who pretend to be moral and claim to be\r\n    sensible in this country, who go to these drunken mobs to get\r\n    information relative to the conduct of colored men.”\r\n\r\nHow it came to pass is a question which human wisdom may not solve, but\r\nin the earliest dawn of history we find the races of men separated by\r\ncolor and by characteristics, very much as they are at this time.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the comings and goings, the migrations and conquests,\r\nthe discoveries and colonizations, the world is pretty nearly the same\r\nold world, so far as the distinct races of men are concerned. The Jew is\r\nstill the Jew, the Gentile still the Gentile. All the currents of the\r\nages have not washed the yellow man white, nor turned the red man yellow,\r\nnor the black man red. The hot sun of the tropics pours down upon the\r\nheads of the sons of men as fervidly as in the days of Abraham, Isaac\r\nand Jacob, but it has not been able to kink the hair, flatten the nose,\r\nblubber the lips or blacken the hide of a single man, woman or child of\r\nthe Aryan race. The Chinaman, racially, is what he was in the time of\r\nConfucius; the Hindoo is yet the dark man whom Khrishna sought to lead to\r\nthe higher life.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, the home of the negro, there has been a monotonous repetition\r\nof the same old facts which historians learned from monumental\r\ninscriptions and indestructible tablets thousands upon thousands of years\r\nold.\r\n\r\nThe African negro has always been a distinct type, an inferior type,\r\na savage type, a non-progressive type. Left to himself, he wore no\r\nclothing, built no houses, had no commerce, systematized no production\r\nof any sort and never had the faintest conception of doing anything to\r\nimprove himself or his condition. He killed for the day the game he\r\nneeded for the day. For the future, he made as little provision as the\r\nIndian and the Esquimau.\r\n\r\nBeyond the herding of cattle he had no instinct for accumulation. His\r\nnormal state was that of warfare against some other black tribe. His\r\nreligion was the grossest superstition. He offered up to his heathen gods\r\nthe sacrifice of the negro child; and when his appetite for four-legged\r\nanimals was sated, he changed his diet by cooking and eating another\r\nnegro.\r\n\r\nWhere the sexual relations of the men and women were not promiscuous,\r\nthey were polygamous. Strictly speaking, there was no such thing as\r\nmorals known among them. Property rights which certain men had, or\r\nclaimed, in certain women might be respected, but the conception of\r\nvirtue was not reached.\r\n\r\nThey never evolved an alphabet. They never advanced beyond the crudest,\r\nrudest, most brutal tribe-life.\r\n\r\nThey had chiefs, or kings; and these kings exercised, despotically, the\r\npower of life and death over their ignorant subjects.\r\n\r\nThey had conjurers and witch doctors, and it was one of the time-honored\r\ncustoms that the witch doctors should “smell out,” for death, the\r\nwretched creatures whom the king wanted to kill, or whom the witch\r\ndoctors themselves wished to put out of the way.\r\n\r\nThousands upon thousands of years ago, negro warriors sold their negro\r\ncaptives into slavery. Negro husbands would offer their wives and\r\ndaughters to foreign travelers. Negro fathers would sell their children.\r\nIn some of the oldest monumental inscriptions of the human race, the\r\nnegro appears as the chained slave of foreign masters.\r\n\r\nAnybody on earth who wanted to buy him could do it. His king was ready to\r\nsell him; his father was ready to sell him. The Egyptian, the Greek, the\r\nRoman owned black slaves as far back as the records go; and the historian\r\nGibbon did no more than express the universal experience and opinion of\r\nthe ages when he wrote that the negro was a distinctly inferior race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “His normal state was that of warfare against some other\r\nblack tribe.”]\r\n\r\nOf all the negroes that have ever lived Tchaka was the greatest. He ruled\r\nin Africa, in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of immense natural power. His ambition was boundless, his\r\nsoul untroubled by fear or scruple. Absolute master of a strong tribe, he\r\nhurled it against other tribes, one after another, until he had conquered\r\nand devastated an imperial territory. In his march to dominion, it is\r\nestimated that he caused the slaughter of a million human beings, all of\r\nwhom were his brothers in black. But he never built a city; never put a\r\nship on the sea; never made two blades of grass grow where one had grown\r\nbefore. He founded no institutions of any kind. He was densely ignorant\r\nand superstitious himself, and he had no conception of anything higher or\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nTo kill, to conquer, to feast, to indulge bestial lust, to inspire\r\nterror, to exploit and mercilessly abuse the abject servility of the\r\nnegroes over whom he ruled were his “pleasures of living.”\r\n\r\nIt was believed that he caused the death of his own mother; it is _known_\r\nthat when he buried her he buried fourteen young negro girls with\r\nher—_buried them alive_!\r\n\r\nIt is _known_ that, during the “period of mourning” which followed, he\r\ncaused the death of some thousands of maddened and helpless negroes. It\r\nis also known that his sisters got his brothers to assassinate him. Then\r\none of these brothers murdered the other, and so became king of that\r\nhappy land.\r\n\r\nIn Africa where the negro is still to be seen in his natural state, you\r\ncan still buy negroes from negroes. Husbands will yet sell wives, fathers\r\nwill yet barter daughters and sons. The buying and selling of negroes\r\ngoes on now just as it did in the days of the Pharaohs. There is not\r\nso much of it as there used to be—to the regret, doubtless, of African\r\nchiefs who have negroes they would like to sell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One of the San Domingo Nobility.]\r\n\r\nNot long ago there was a story which went the usual rounds. An English\r\ntraveler was about to set out from a certain coast town of Africa upon\r\na journey into the interior. He expected to be gone for several months.\r\nIn fitting himself out with camp equipage, he bought a negro girl to\r\ncarry along—to serve as his mistress. Her father sold her, and the\r\nonly surprise that was caused by the transaction was the amount paid.\r\nThe Englishman gave about one hundred dollars for the girl and it was\r\ngenerally considered an extravagant figure. As to the girl, she seemed\r\nproud to have been selected, and gratified at having been sold so high.\r\nWhen the Englishman had finished his trip, he probably sold her at a\r\ndiscount to some other white man who desired a complete camp outfit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExcepting those portions of Africa wherein the white man has set his\r\nfoot and impressed his will, the negro is at this day the same lustful,\r\nbrutal, besotted cannibal and voodoo slave that he was thousands of years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica, the white man has to steer for him, and control him.\r\n\r\nHe did not even know what to do with bananas till Col. Baker, a white\r\nman, came along and taught him.\r\n\r\nIn Liberia, he has gone back to heathenism and savagery, because the\r\nwhite man’s strong hand is not there to guide and control.\r\n\r\nIn San Domingo, he had—as a starting point—one of the fairest\r\ncivilizations the world has known. Aided by the yellow fever, the black\r\nman drove out the white; and now he has gone back into chaos, voodooism,\r\ncannibalism and imbecility.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, negroes can run a bank, for they can see white men\r\nrunning banks all around them and they are quick at imitation.\r\n\r\nHow is it in San Domingo, where the black man rules the white?\r\n\r\nApparently there is not a bank in San Domingo. If there is, it cannot be\r\ntrusted. Why do I say this?\r\n\r\nBecause that portion of the San Domingan custom-house receipts which was\r\nto be paid to the creditors of the negro republic had to be deposited in\r\na New York bank for safe-keeping.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, the negroes can run colleges, manufacturing\r\nestablishments, automobile street-car lines, newspapers and magazines.\r\nWhy? Because they see how the whites run colleges, manufactories, and\r\nautomobiles, newspapers and magazines.\r\n\r\nIn San Domingo there is no Tuskeegee, Hampton or Howard. In San Domingo\r\nthere are no flourishing manufactories created and operated by negroes;\r\nand no up-to-date automobile street-car lines, such as the negroes\r\nstarted in Nashville, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe negroes of San Domingo ought to have a commerce—one of the most\r\nprofitable in the world; but they haven’t. Their navy is a myth,\r\nand their army a joke. One revolution chases after another with such\r\nconfusing rapidity that when our Senate meets to debate the ratification\r\nof the San Domingan treaty which Roosevelt had arranged, the “President”\r\nwith whom Roosevelt had made the treaty is a fugitive, whose “Cabinet”\r\nhas compelled him to take to the woods.\r\n\r\nThere used to be an “Order of Nobility” in San Domingo, with its Marquis\r\nof Lemonade and its Duke of Marmalade; but as these eminent Noblemen have\r\nfailed to show up in the later turmoils I fear their titles have become\r\nextinct, or that the “Order of Nobility” has been abolished.\r\n\r\nWhich is a pity. It would have been something worth living for to have\r\nseen the Duke of Marmalade paying a visit to this country, receiving the\r\nadoring attentions which New York’s “Swell Set” pay to all “noblemen”\r\nwhomsoever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNowhere else in the universe is the negro treated so well as in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nHe was once a slave, but his own people sold him. Either he was a captive\r\nin war who would have been slain, broiled and eaten, if the English or\r\nDutch sailor had not come along and offered to buy him; or he was in the\r\npower of his chief, his father or his brother, and was by them offered\r\nfor a price.\r\n\r\nSome of the blacks who were brought to this country may have been\r\nkidnapped, but, as a rule, there was no need for kidnapping. Negroes\r\ncould be bought for a song all along the Coast and all through the\r\ninterior of Africa. The most successful “kidnapper” was New England rum.\r\n\r\nYes, it is a literal historical fact that the negro was sold into slavery\r\nby his own people, just as Joseph was sold by his brethren.\r\n\r\nIn the long run what was the consequence to the negro?\r\n\r\nHe was changed from a savage into a semi-civilized man.\r\n\r\nIn his native land he had been an ignorant serf whose life depended upon\r\nthe temper of a despotic brute—his chief.\r\n\r\nHe exchanged a slavery for a slavery; and the slavery to which he was\r\nbrought lifted him from a brute into a man.\r\n\r\nWe taught him how to work; we taught him how to read; we taught him how\r\nto think; we taught him how to live.\r\n\r\nTo free him from the bondage into which his own brethren had sold him,\r\na million white men rose in arms. There were four years of terrible,\r\nhorrible strife; half a million white men fell in battle; six billions\r\nof dollars were devoured in the flames of Civil War; and over all that\r\nperiod of strife, and over the host which finally triumphed, waved the\r\nflag which the freed negro—freed at such frightful cost—now safely\r\ndenounces as a dirty and contemptible rag!\r\n\r\nWhen the “Brothers’ War” was over and while the former owner of the\r\nslaves was prostrate, those who had fought that the black man might be\r\nfree, clothed him in the garments of citizenship, giving him the ballot,\r\ngiving him office, giving him power, at the same time that tens of\r\nthousands of white men were outlawed.\r\n\r\n“Show to the world that you are capable of government,” said the white\r\nphilanthropist to the blacks; and the result was a hideous carnival of\r\nmismanagement, incompetency and gross rascality which at last made even\r\nthe professional white philanthropist sick and ashamed.\r\n\r\nTaking out of the hands of the blacks the political power which he had\r\nshown himself unfit to wield, the whites have ever since occupied toward\r\nhim the attitude of a guardian over a ward, manifesting for him a helpful\r\nsympathy, aiding his advancement with substantial contributions, leading\r\nhim upward and onward by precept, example and wholesome control.\r\n\r\nSchools were established for him. Churches were built for him. White men\r\nand white women devoted their lives to lifting the black man, the black\r\nwoman, the black child into the nobler, purer paths. White men taxed\r\nthemselves to put an end to the negro’s ignorance and superstition. The\r\nwhite man opened his purse to endow colleges for the negro’s special\r\nbenefit. The white man opened the door of opportunity to the black, and\r\ngave him a chance in every field of human endeavor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “We taught him how to work; we taught him how to read; we\r\ntaught him how to think; we taught him how to live.”]\r\n\r\nNot for one month could the negro prosper in the United States, if the\r\nwhite man became his enemy.\r\n\r\nIn one month, we could by concert of action, so smite the negro that his\r\nmushroom growth would wither like the severed gourd-vine. The maddest\r\nthing, the most suicidal thing that the black man could do would be to\r\narouse the enmity of the whites.\r\n\r\nWhen that day comes, if it shall ever come, the white man will not any\r\nmore stop to count the cost of annihilating, or of driving out the\r\nblacks, than Spain halted to count the cost of smiting and driving out\r\nthe Moor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the United States the negro is seen at his best, because of the\r\nconstant example, guidance and control of the whites.\r\n\r\nNowhere else on the planet has the negro the religious establishment\r\nwhich he has copied from us, with our earnest help.\r\n\r\nNowhere else has he the educational system which he has patterned after\r\nours, aided at every step by us.\r\n\r\nNowhere else has he the banks, manufactures, newspapers, magazines,\r\nmodernized farms, elegant professional offices which he has fashioned\r\nupon our models, amid our plaudits of approval and encouragement.\r\n\r\nBy the hundreds, by the thousands, the negro has been admitted to\r\npositions of honor and trust. He has been in the Senate; he has been in\r\nthe House of Representatives; he has been in the State Legislatures; he\r\nhas served on juries; he is in the army; he is on the police force.\r\n\r\nIn the proud, aristocratic city of Charleston doth not the redoubtable\r\nDr. Crum, a negro, sit at the Receipt of Customs, drawing a fatter\r\nsalary than was ever enjoyed by Matthew, the Apostle of Christ?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “To free him from bondage half a million white men fell in\r\nbattle.”]\r\n\r\nThere are no Dr. Crums in Africa or Liberia. And in San Domingo it is\r\nthe white man who sits at the receipt of customs—nobody being willing to\r\ntrust the negro with his own money.\r\n\r\nHath not our Roosevelt declared that when Judson Lyons, Register of the\r\nTreasury, goes out, another negro shall take his place? _Thus it shall\r\ncontinue to happen that Uncle Sam’s paper money will not be good in law\r\nuntil a negro has set his name to it._\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a white man, in the United States, gave a negro school\r\na million dollars in a lump. Doctor Booker Washington got the money. I\r\nwonder how long the learned Doctor would have to live in Africa, Liberia,\r\nor San Domingo before he could get a million dollars with which to\r\noperate a school.\r\n\r\nReally, it sometimes occurs to me that if such negroes as Bishop Turner\r\nare honest in their denunciations of the United States, they would pack\r\nup their belongings and go right back to dear old Africa, the home of the\r\nrace. Nothing on earth prevents their doing so.\r\n\r\nRather than go to hell _I_ would go to Africa; and if I believed I was\r\nliving in a land which was worse than hell, I would even try San Domingo,\r\nfor a change.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat _bosh_, nonsense and self-assertive insolence is embodied in Bishop\r\nTurner’s denunciation of the Flag and of the Government!\r\n\r\nPoor, down-trodden negro!\r\n\r\nWhat a doleful howl he sets up when he is asked to ride in a separate\r\ncar; and when he is told that separate churches, separate schools,\r\nseparate hotels, and separate social life is best for both races. How he\r\nraves and froths at the mouth when we tell him that for his own sake, as\r\nwell as ours, we who have, with desperate difficulty and hardship and\r\nsacrifice, built up our civilization, cannot afford to allow it to fall\r\ninto the power of the inferior race. We have seen what they did with\r\nthis same Civilization in San Domingo when the French Revolution, most\r\nunwisely, entrusted it to the blacks.\r\n\r\nReconstruction days taught us that the San Domingan experience would\r\nbe repeated here, if the negro rule continued. To save ourselves from\r\nsuch a calamity, _and to save the negro from himself_, we put back into\r\nthe hands of the whites that civilization which had been the outcome of\r\ncenturies of effort on the part of the whites.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Negro Convention of today has not met to howl but to\r\nbrag, what a beautiful, brilliant picture their orators can paint, as\r\nthey proclaim the progress and prosperity of the negro. What wonderful\r\nstatistics they use to prove that the negro has advanced in knowledge\r\nmore rapidly than the whites of Russia, of Hungary, of Italy and of\r\nSpain! What a glittering array of accumulated millions do they claim, in\r\nlands, chattels and hereditaments! With what vociferous gusto do they\r\n“point with pride” to their farms, their stores, their banks, their\r\nnewspapers, their magazines! To listen to them when they have assembled\r\nto jubilate instead of to howl, you would suppose that, so far as the\r\nnegro was concerned, the horn of plenty was full, the land flowing\r\nwith milk and honey. Even Bishop Turner, with an amazingly unconscious\r\ninconsistency, fills his letter of so-called denial with boastings of\r\nthe handsome homes in which the negroes live, the furniture which the\r\nwhite man just ought to go and see, the “library” which would delight the\r\nscholar, the piano music and the organ melodies which, in negro homes,\r\nsoothe the ear and charm the sense.\r\n\r\nLet us admit that every bit of this bragging and boasting is founded upon\r\nsolid fact. Then, in the name of common sense, let me inquire: “_Where,\r\noh, where, is the negro race doing all these marvelous things?_”\r\n\r\nIn what country, under what flag, is he piling up these millions of\r\nmoney? Under what government is he outstripping the Russian, the\r\nSpaniard, the Austrian? Where is it that he has bought so many farms,\r\nestablished so many banks, built such fine houses, secured such\r\nattractive furniture, and gotten an organ for ’Liza Jane and a piano for\r\nSusan Ann?\r\n\r\nIs it in Africa? No. In Liberia? _No._ In San Domingo? No.\r\n\r\nThe negro is doing the splendid things to which he “points with pride”\r\n_in that country whose flag is a dirty rag, in that land which is worse\r\nthan hell_!\r\n\r\nPoor, down-trodden negro!\r\n\r\nHe makes an idle wager in Baltimore that he will kiss a white girl, in a\r\nwhite hotel; and he walks up to her in the public dining room, puts his\r\nhands upon her and kisses her!\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, he sits down in a white restaurant, and beckons a white\r\nwoman waitress to come and wait upon him; and when she refuses, he goes\r\nstraight to a magistrate, swears out a warrant, has the girl arrested,\r\nand sends her to prison!\r\n\r\nPoor down-trodden negro! In New York City, and perhaps in other cities,\r\nnegro men hold white women in a state of slavery, _to minister to their\r\nlusts_; and the political power of these negroes is so great that the\r\nlawful authorities have been utterly unable to free these white slaves\r\nfrom the bestial degradation in which they are held by their black\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nIn Washington City—but that would require a chapter to itself. If there\r\nis a Paradise on this earth, a Garden of Eden filled with ceaseless joy\r\nfor the non-producing, insolent, self-assertive blacks, it is our Capital\r\nCity of Washington, where more than two thousand negro men and women draw\r\nGovernment pay in federal offices.\r\n\r\nOh, that Bishop Turner had described to the Macon Convention one of\r\nthose “Receptions” at the mansion of Judson Lyons, Register of the\r\nTreasury—such as Judson often held. Oh, that the Bishop had told the\r\nConvention how many of Judson’s colored guests came in automobiles,\r\nwhich were left lining the sidewalk and obstructing the street. Oh, that\r\nthe Bishop had described to the Convention the similarity between the\r\nnegro “Reception” at the mansion of the Register of the Treasury and the\r\nwhite reception of the President of the United States!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Poor down-trodden negro!... he is sometimes compelled to\r\ntake dinner with John Wanamaker and lunch with Theodore Roosevelt.”]\r\n\r\nPoor, down-trodden negro! In this land which is worse than hell, it\r\nactually happens that he is sometimes compelled to take dinner with John\r\nWanamaker, and to lunch with Theodore Roosevelt!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe amazement within me grows as I dwell upon the black man’s woes, and\r\nI marvel that Doctor Washington, Judson Lyons, Bishop Turner “and others\r\namong ’em” do not pack right up and go straight back to dear old Africa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd to think that the man who declared this country to be worse than\r\nhell is a “negro preacher.” I had supposed that if there was any human\r\nbeing who found the United States an ideal abode, it was the “negro\r\npreacher.” He is the one incumbent whom I had been led to believe had a\r\nmighty rich thing in salary, and a still richer thing in “_perqueesits_.”\r\nIf I had been asked to go out and find the man who could unreservedly\r\nindorse the proposition that life _is_ worth living, I should have struck\r\na bee line for the nearest negro preacher.\r\n\r\nOf course, if I had been unable to find _him_, my next choice would have\r\nbeen the negro school-teacher.\r\n\r\nThe army of negro preachers is a shining host, waving palms of victory,\r\nand apparently happy; the army of negro school-teachers is another\r\nshining host, waving palms of victory, and apparently happy.\r\n\r\nThe white man’s money, directly and indirectly, supplies the sinews of\r\nwar to both these shining hosts—a fact which it did not suit the purpose\r\nof Bishop Turner to mention in the convention which had met to howl, and\r\nwhich, consequently, was bound to howl.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, in Liberia, in San Domingo, negro preachers have not\r\nflourished, increased, or put their hands upon so many good things as\r\nthey have done in poor, little, old North America. And the shining hosts\r\nof negro school-teachers, flush with the white man’s money, do not wave\r\nany palms of victory beyond the limits of the country which is worse than\r\nhell, the country whose flag is a dirty, contemptible rag “where the\r\nnegro is involved.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTake out of your pocket a five-dollar or one-dollar treasury note, or\r\ncertificate, and look at the name signed to give it validity.\r\n\r\n“_Judson W. Lyons, Register of the Treasury._”\r\n\r\nDo you find it?\r\n\r\nWell, that name has been a legal necessity to every treasury note issued\r\nby the Federal Government during the last eight years.\r\n\r\nJudson W. Lyons is a negro.\r\n\r\nFor the last eight years he has been holding the high, responsible and\r\nwell-paid office of Register of the Treasury of the United States.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this Judson W. Lyons went down to Macon, Georgia, to attend\r\na convention of negroes, and in this convention he heard Bishop H. M.\r\nTurner, a negro, denounce the flag of his country as “A CONTEMPTIBLE AND\r\nDIRTY RAG;” and Judson did not open his mouth to protest.\r\n\r\nHe also heard this ungrateful Bishop declare that—“_Hell is an\r\nimprovement on the United States when the negro is involved_.”\r\n\r\nStill, Judson W. Lyons sat there in apparent acquiescence—he an officer\r\nof the Government!\r\n\r\nNow when you are told that every blessed son and son-in-law of Bishop H.\r\nM. Turner was appointed to office under President Cleveland, and when you\r\nbear in mind that Judson Lyons has so long been in the enjoyment of a\r\nFederal office which pays him $8,000 per year, you can form a fair idea\r\nof a radical defect in negro character. It is _Ingratitude_.\r\n\r\nBishop Turner has been treated with the utmost consideration by the\r\nwhites. He enjoys a larger income than he could hope to draw as witch\r\ndoctor in Africa, or as voodoo man in San Domingo. He lives on the fat of\r\nthe land, grows juicy himself, and yet runs no risk of being hot-potted\r\nby hungry brethren—as he would in his native land of Africa. He dresses\r\nin a manner which would have stunned King Tchaka; and to see him take his\r\necclesiastical ease in a Pullman car is a sight for the sore-eyed.\r\n\r\n_What is the Bishop angry about?_\r\n\r\nApparently for the reason that “drunken mobs” in the North, South, East\r\nand West diabolically persist in accusing the negro of committing rape.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop says that the negro is innocent. Being innocent, he is\r\nnecessarily as innocent as a new-born babe. The Bishop declares that “no\r\nnegro has been tried by the courts and found guilty of this crime of rape\r\nin fifteen years.”\r\n\r\nThis statement makes the other twin for Booker Washington’s assertion\r\nthat “not more than six” graduates of negro colleges have ever gone\r\nwrong. A more precious pair of Siamese-twin lies have not been put in\r\ntype since the decease of the late lamented Baron Munchausen.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that Bishop Turner, if he continues to cultivate the evil\r\nspirit which broke loose in the Macon Convention, will some day know,\r\nby experience, whether hell IS an improvement over the United States;\r\nbut, before that time comes, I would suggest that he step down to San\r\nDomingo and soak himself in the luxuries of that region for awhile, as a\r\npreparation for the other place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “In New York a negro is at the head of the white slave\r\ntraffic.”]\r\n\r\n_Note._—Public opinion expressed itself so hotly concerning his attack\r\non the flag that Bishop Turner felt driven into a perfunctory and\r\ninvolved denial; but having read this so-called denial I am convinced\r\nthat the bishop did use substantially the words reported, because of\r\nthe significant fact that his so-called denial contains language quite\r\nas offensive, quite as insulting, as that which he surlily pretends to\r\ndisclaim. Had this been the first time that Bishop Turner had denounced\r\nthe Government that has done so much for his race, had it been the\r\nfirst time he had outrageously vilified the people among whom he lives,\r\nthere might be room for doubt concerning the Macon speech. But Bishop\r\nTurner has for years been speaking and writing in precisely the vein\r\nwhich appears in the reports that went out from Macon. He has become\r\nconspicuous as a chronic assailant of the whites. Therefore I have not\r\nthe slightest doubt that he used at Macon in substance, if not in the\r\nvery words, the reports as telegraphed all over the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Indignant Wisconsin Editor_\r\n\r\nMr. John L. Sturtevant, whose card informs the interested universe that\r\nhe, the said John L., is editor of _The Waupaca Post_, of Waupaca, Wis.,\r\nflew into a passion when he read the February number of this Magazine.\r\n\r\nThe why and the wherefore of his sudden rage are best explained in a\r\nred-hot letter which I now give in full, just as it came sizzling from\r\nthe frying pan:\r\n\r\n                                                     Feb. 17, 1906.\r\n\r\n    _Thomas E. Watson, New York._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: In the February number of your magazine, on page 400,\r\n    under the caption “Best on Earth” you state: “The big Milwaukee\r\n    First National Bank burst and the people lost $1,450,000.” The\r\n    statement is absolutely false. F. G. Bigelow, president of the\r\n    bank, appropriated that amount from the bank’s funds to his own\r\n    use, but the bank did not burst nor did the “people,” in the\r\n    sense in which you use the word, lose one cent. The loss fell\r\n    upon the stockholders and was fully paid from the surplus which\r\n    the bank had accumulated during an honorable and successful\r\n    career. Your magazine is full of just such reckless and\r\n    libelous statements as this, which make thoughtful readers look\r\n    with distrust upon the few truths it contains. Intentionally,\r\n    or otherwise, you constantly do grave injury to many people and\r\n    the pity of it is your readers who do not think or reason are\r\n    led along the paths of populism, socialism and anarchy.\r\n\r\n                         Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n                                                  J. L. STURTEVANT.\r\n\r\nTouching the falsehood to which the furious John L. refers, I have this\r\nto say: My article was based upon a “special” sent out from Chicago which\r\nwent the rounds of the Press, and which was not contradicted.\r\n\r\nThe “special” from which I took the facts, appeared, on December 19,\r\n1905, in the _Augusta Herald_, one of the most reliable and conservative\r\nDemocratic daily papers in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe indignant Sturtevant does not deny that the bank was looted of the\r\nsum stated by me, but because I said that “the people” lost the money\r\nhe charges me with having made a statement that was “absolutely false.”\r\nSturtevant alleges that the money was not stolen from “the people” but\r\nfrom “the stockholders!”\r\n\r\nHe is equally indignant because I said that the bank “burst.” He alleges\r\nthat the stockholders were able to stand the theft of nearly a million\r\nand a half dollars, and that the bank didn’t burst.\r\n\r\nAn Editor of a Magazine is at a disadvantage when compared to the Editor\r\nof _The Waupaca Post_, of Waupaca, Wisconsin. Sturtevant evidently stands\r\nat the head-waters of information, and gets his news fresh from the\r\nspring. That’s one of the luxuries of living and editing at Waupaca.\r\n\r\nA poor devil of a Georgia editor, like me, has to take his information\r\nsecond-hand. In spite of all that I can do, it is impossible for me to be\r\nthere, all over the world, when things are happening.\r\n\r\nSturtevant was close to Milwaukee when Bigelow looted his bank, and\r\ntherefore, knew at first hand what the facts were. On the contrary, I\r\nwas thousands of miles off, and had to rely upon telegraphic despatches,\r\npublished in reputable newspapers.\r\n\r\nIn the “special” from Chicago which appeared in the _Herald_, of Augusta,\r\nGa., December 19, 1905, this language appears:\r\n\r\n“The three big bank WRECKS which are still fresh in the public mind on\r\naccount of their size and recent date are: the Enterprise National Bank\r\nof Allegheny, Penn.; The First National Bank of Topeka, Kans.; the FIRST\r\nNATIONAL BANK OF MILWAUKEE, WIS.!”\r\n\r\nThen in a tabulated statement, the “special” gave sums which were\r\nclassified as “losses.”\r\n\r\nIn this separate list of “losses” occasioned by “THE BANK WRECKS,” the\r\nFirst National Bank of Milwaukee, heads the table with $1,450,000.\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of my statement in the Magazine being reckless and\r\nfalse, it was carefully based upon a “special” sent out from Chicago\r\nin December, which at the time my paragraphs were written had gone\r\nunchallenged for more than a month.\r\n\r\nEven when corrected by Mr. Sturtevant, how much good is done to the\r\nNational Banking system whose claim to be “the best on earth” I was\r\nridiculing? My point was that the lootings of this boasted “best system\r\non earth” were so frequent and so colossal that it was absurd to claim\r\nthat the system was “the best on earth.” How does the Waupaca Champion of\r\nlooted banks improve matters by explaining that the president of the bank\r\nmerely stole a million and a half from _the stockholders_?\r\n\r\nHow does he weaken my attack by saying that the bank was able to stand\r\nthe huge robbery?\r\n\r\nIs bank rottenness saved from denunciation because the looted bank\r\nhappened to be rich enough to survive the blow?\r\n\r\nIs bank gutting made respectable because the stockholders alone were\r\ngutted?\r\n\r\nSuppose the stockholders had not been rich enough to make good the\r\nloss; suppose the bank had not possessed “a surplus” of that immense\r\nsize—wouldn’t “the loss” have fallen upon “the people,” and wouldn’t the\r\nbank have “burst”?\r\n\r\nAh, Mr. Sturtevant! When you say that a National Bank has gained such\r\ntremendous profits out of the privilege of creating money and lending\r\nit to the people at high rates of interest that a robbery which runs up\r\ninto the millions does not stagger it in the least, you simply convince\r\nthe intelligent reader that National Banks reap far greater gains out of\r\nSpecial Privilege than their champions are in the habit of admitting.\r\n\r\nAs to the “other” reckless and libelous statements which the Waupaca\r\nEditor says I have been making in the Magazine, I can only invite him to\r\nname them.\r\n\r\nThe Magazine is here to stay, and it is not conscious of having made\r\nreckless and libelous statements.\r\n\r\nThe columns are open to brother Sturtevant, and to all others, who wish\r\nto challenge any statements made therein.\r\n\r\nWhenever I am shown to be wrong, I will gladly make correction, and, if\r\nneed be, apology.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, the other fellow happens to be wrong, I will\r\nendeavor, in a mild, conciliatory but earnest spirit to show him his\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nBrother Sturtevant, of Waupaca, asserts that I am constantly doing grave\r\ninjury to many people.\r\n\r\nI appeal to Sturtevant to furnish me a list—a partial one, at least—of\r\nthe people whom I am constantly injuring so gravely.\r\n\r\nIf he can establish the fact that in the 200,000 words or more, which I\r\nhave written for the Magazine, a grave injury has been inflicted upon any\r\nman, woman or child, I stand ready to make the fullest amends.\r\n\r\n_Make good, brother Sturtevant!_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Man and the Land\r\n\r\nCertain good friends of mine were shocked, a few months ago, when they\r\nlearned that I was one of those monsters who believe in the private\r\nownership of land.\r\n\r\nSome of them deplored my ignorance, and urged me to go straightway and\r\nread “Progress and Poverty.” Well, I had read Henry George’s book soon\r\nafter its publication, and had once had the precious advantage of serving\r\na term in Congress with the great Tom Johnson; yet I never had been able\r\nto see the distinction, _in principle_, between the private ownership of\r\na cow and the private ownership of a cow-lot.\r\n\r\nSome men are just that stupid, and when Ephraim gets “sot” on a thing of\r\nthat kind, even Louis Post, of _The Public_, has to let him alone.\r\n\r\nCertain other friends made the point on me that I did not understand\r\nCount Tolstoy. That is possible. In his various ramblings into various\r\nspeculative matters, Tolstoy, like our own Emerson, gets lost, sometimes,\r\nin mazes of his own making; and he uses language which may delight\r\nprofessional commentators, but which is sorely vexatious to an average\r\ncitizen who really wants to know what the philosophers are driving at.\r\n\r\nTolstoy is careful to avoid _History_. The flood of light which might be\r\nthrown upon the land question by the records of the human race is shut\r\nout altogether.\r\n\r\nAnd _this_ is the weak spot in the armor of every champion who enters\r\nthe list against the Private Ownership of Land. If History makes any one\r\nthing plain, it is that a Civilization was never able to develop itself\r\non any other basis than that of Private Ownership.\r\n\r\nLike other champions of his theory, Tolstoy forgets the elemental traits\r\nof Human Nature. He forgets how _unequal_ we are by Nature; how we\r\ndiffer, in character, capacity, taste and purpose; how few there are who\r\nwill labor for the “good of all,” and how universal is the rule that each\r\nman labors, first of all, for _himself_.\r\n\r\nHe forgets that every beast of the field has its prototype in some\r\nmembers of the human family; he forgets that the _man_-tiger is now more\r\nnumerous than the four-footed sort; that the _man_-fox is more cunning\r\nthan his wild brother; that the _man_-wolf hunts with every human herd;\r\nthat the _man_-sloth is marked by nature with her own indelible brand;\r\nthat some men are born timid as the deer are; that some are born without\r\nfear as the lion is; that the human hog grunts and gorges, and makes\r\nhimself a nauseating nuisance, on the streets, in hotels, in the Pullman\r\ncars—in fact everywhere, but most of all where people have to eat and\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThis is the fundamental error which doctrinaires are prone to make. _They\r\nforget what Human Nature actually is, always has been, and perhaps,\r\nalways will be._\r\n\r\nThey argue about ideal conditions, unmindful of the fact that ideal\r\nconditions require ideal men—and that we haven’t got the ideal men.\r\n\r\nEvery society, every state, must from necessity be made up of the Good,\r\nthe Bad, and the Indifferent and the law-makers of that society, that\r\nstate, will from necessity be compelled to frame laws suited to _that_\r\ncommunity. Hence, the laws will not be absolutely the best, considering\r\nthe question as an abstract question, but they will be the best which\r\n_that_ community is capable of receiving.\r\n\r\nAll legislation, like all Society, is a compromise.\r\n\r\nIn a state of Nature I would be absolutely free. But I would be alone. To\r\nprotect myself in person, property or family, I would have to rely upon\r\nmy individual arm. My absolute freedom would be an absolute isolation and\r\na relative helplessness.\r\n\r\nI would find that I could not endure such a life. I would therefore seek\r\ncompanionship among other men who felt the same needs that I felt, and we\r\nwould come together for the “good of all.” One hundred families coming\r\ntogether in this way form the nucleus of Society, of the State. Each man\r\ngives up a portion of his individual freedom when he enters this union of\r\nfamilies which forms such a nucleus.\r\n\r\nWhy does he surrender a portion of his wild, natural, individual freedom?\r\nWhy does he agree to be bound by the will of the Community instead of\r\nhis _own_ will? Why does he consent to be _governed_ by the public when\r\nhe had previously been his own ruler? He does it because it is to his\r\ninterest to do it. He finds that, while he has surrendered much, he\r\nhas gained more. _The Community_ throws around him the protection of a\r\nhundred strong arms where previously he had but his own.\r\n\r\n_The Community_, in a hundred ways, ministers to his wants, his\r\nweaknesses, his desires, his prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Community gives more than it took.\r\n\r\nAssociation which improves the Community tends to improve each member\r\nthus associated; and from this association come all those blessings which\r\nwe call Civilization.\r\n\r\nResolve the Association back into its elements; let each individual\r\nseparate from the mass; let each one say, “I’m my own man,”—and what\r\nbecomes of Civilization?\r\n\r\nIt perishes, of course.\r\n\r\nNow where will Tolstoy find the basis of Society _in Nature_?\r\n\r\nIn the human instinct for _getting-together_. And that instinct seems to\r\ngrow out of our hopes, and our fears, our profound belief that we _need_\r\nour fellow-man, and that we are not strong enough to stand alone, _no\r\nmatter how much we would like to do so_.\r\n\r\nDeep down in your heart you will find the primeval, natural craving for\r\nindependence, individuality, separate living, separate doing. With the\r\ngreat common mass of humanity this tendency has been weakened by disuse\r\nuntil it is not an active principle. It is like a muscle which has lost\r\nits strength from inaction. Hence, the common man goes with the herd,\r\njust as a flock of sheep follows the bell-wether.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSociety, then is a matter of convention: _Nature_ did not frame it.\r\n\r\nNor does _Nature_ impose upon us the relation of Husband and Wife.\r\n\r\nWhy do we adopt the present marriage system, which differs in so many\r\nrespects from Nature, and from former practices of the human race?\r\n\r\nSimply because we believe it to be _an improvement_. We _know_ it is\r\nbetter than the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes: we _believe_ it\r\nto be better than Polygamy; we _hope_ that it will some day be a more\r\nradiant success than the Divorce Courts would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\nNow as to the land.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the earth was given to the human family as a home for the\r\nfamily. Undoubtedly, Nature teaches that the earth belongs in common to\r\nthe entire human race.\r\n\r\nThus it was in the beginning. But, just as the wild horse became the\r\nproperty of the bold tribesman who caught it and tamed it; just as the\r\nnatural fruit of the forest belonged to him who gathered it; just as the\r\ncave or hollow tree became the dwelling of the first occupant, so the\r\nwell in the thirsty plain became the property of him that had dug down to\r\nthe waters; and the pasturage which one had taken up might not be taken\r\naway from him by another.\r\n\r\nMine was the bark hut which my labor had built; mine the canoe which my\r\nhands had hollowed out; mine the bow and arrows which I had fashioned;\r\nmine the herds and flocks, the goats and asses which I had tamed and\r\nreared and cared for till they had multiplied.\r\n\r\nShould the idler, or the thief of the tribe, take from me that which my\r\nlabor had produced? Must _my_ canoe belong to the whole tribe? Must my\r\ngarment which I had made out of the skins of the wild beast belong to the\r\nsloth who loafed in the tent while I risked my life in the woods?\r\n\r\n_Nature said_, NO!\r\n\r\nNature, speaking through elemental instinct said: “That which _your_\r\nlabor made is _yours_.”\r\n\r\nYours the hut, yours the canoe, yours the garment of skins, yours the bow\r\nand arrows—and that was the beginning of _Private Property in Personalty_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut look again at the ways of Nature and of the tribe.\r\n\r\nPasturage failed after awhile; natural fruits were no longer sufficient\r\nto sustain life; game disappeared from the forest; fish grew scarce in\r\nthe streams. Something had to be done to make good the shortage. The\r\nsoil was there, suggesting cultivation. The products of Nature must be\r\nsupplemented by human industry. But before the soil could be cultivated,\r\nthe trees had to be cut away; cattle and wild beasts had to be fenced\r\nout; the virgin earth had to be made the bride of toil before the\r\nfruitful seed would bring forth harvests.\r\n\r\nNow _who was to do the work_?\r\n\r\nThe Idler wouldn’t; the Feeble couldn’t; the Hunter didn’t; _the strong,\r\nclear-headed Laborer made the farm_.\r\n\r\nThose who assail private ownership of land say that “the man who makes a\r\nfarm doesn’t make it in the sense that one makes a basket or a chair.”\r\nThey see clearly that, if they admit that _the pioneer who goes into the\r\nwilderness or the swamps and creates a farm, is to be put on the same\r\nfooting as the man who goes into the woods, gets material and makes a\r\ncanoe, or a chair or a basket_, it is “farewell world” to their theory\r\nabout the land. Therefore they say that THE FARM WAS ALREADY THERE,\r\nwaiting for the farmer. All the farmer had to do was to go there and\r\ntickle the soil with a hoe, and it laughed with the harvest.\r\n\r\nHow very absurd! You might just as well say that the willows that\r\nbent over the waters of the brook _were baskets waiting for the tardy\r\nbasketmaker to come and get them_. You might just as well say that the\r\nhide on the cow’s back was a pair of ladies’ shoes waiting for the lady\r\nto come and fit them to her dainty feet.\r\n\r\nMust we get rid of our common sense, our practical knowledge, before we\r\ncan argue a case of this sort? Do not these doctrinaires know that they\r\nare denying physical facts, plain everyday experience, when they say\r\nthat a piece of wild land in the desert, in the swamps, on the mountain\r\nside, or in the woody wilderness _is a farm waiting for the farmer_?\r\nSheer nonsense never went further. But they are compelled to this extent\r\nbecause of the necessities of their case. They see at once that if ever\r\nthey admit my position that _the laborer takes raw materials with which\r\nnature supplies him, and out of those raw materials creates something\r\nthat did not exist before_, then the laborer is entitled to that which\r\nhis labor creates.\r\n\r\nNow, do you mean to tell me, that for thousands of years there were farms\r\nwaiting the pioneers here in North America? Consider for a moment what\r\nthe New England, or the Southern, or the Western farmer had to do before\r\nhe had _made a farm_. He had to go into the woods with an axe in one hand\r\nand a rifle in the other. Very frequently he was shot down before he\r\ncould make his farm, just as Abraham Lincoln’s grandfather was killed.\r\nVery frequently he died from the fever engendered in the woods before he\r\nhad made his farm, just as Andrew Jackson’s father did, in the effort _to\r\nmake a farm_ in the wilderness of North Carolina. Supposing the farmer\r\nwas able to snatch up his gun quick enough to shoot the Indian who was\r\ntrying to shoot him, and supposing that his constitution was strong\r\nenough to resist the malarial atmosphere in which he had to labor while\r\ncreating that farm, what was the process through which he went _in making\r\nthat farm_? He had to cut off an enormous growth of timber. He had to\r\ngrub up stumps and roots. He had to plow and cross-plow the soil until it\r\nhad become a seed bed. He had to inclose the farm to keep out the wild\r\nanimals which would have devoured his crop. If in a rocky section, he had\r\nto remove the stones which encumbered the ground. If in a damp, swampy\r\nsection, he had to exercise skill, as well as labor, in draining the\r\nsoil. After four or five years, the laborer _had made a farm_—something\r\n_as different from the wild land which he found in the woods as the pine\r\ntree is from the lumber which lies upon the lumber-yard_; as different as\r\nthe wool on the sheep’s back is from the coat which you wear; something\r\nas different as the willow and the bamboo are from the chairs and the\r\nbaskets which are made from them.\r\n\r\nNow, the doctrinaires say that it would be a sufficient reward to that\r\nlaborer _to give him the crop that he made on the land_. Would it? For\r\nwhat length of time will you give him those crops? If you ask the\r\nlaborer, he will say, “_I made this farm_; I risked my life in the work:\r\nI shortened my days by the labor, the exposure, the drudgery of making\r\nthis farm. I never would have gone to this amount of toil if I had not\r\nbelieved that society would secure me in the possession of the farm after\r\nI made it.”\r\n\r\nHaving established him in his security of possession, which I say is\r\ntantamount to title, suppose that laborer wants to change his farm for\r\na stock of manufactured goods, or for silver and gold, or for horses,\r\nor for another piece of land, do you mean to say he shall not have the\r\nright to do it? If so, you limit his title, and you have not the right\r\nto do so. _That which he made he ought to have the right to dispose of\r\non such terms as please him._ His title having originated in the sacred\r\nrights of labor, you should not limit his enjoyment or his disposition\r\nof that which his labor created. If you recognize his right to exchange\r\none product of his labor for another, you recognize his right to exchange\r\nall products of his labor for others. In other words, by plain course\r\nof reasoning, you arrive at the principle that the bargain and sale of\r\nlands is founded upon the right of the laborer to exchange the product of\r\nhis labor with those who may have product of labor which he could use to\r\nbetter advantage than he can use his own.\r\n\r\nNow, let us see. The laborer who made the farm dies. What shall become of\r\nit? Away back in the origin of property, OCCUPANCY was the first title\r\nrecognized. As long as one individual, or one tribe, occupied a certain\r\nspot their right to use it was recognized, but no longer. When possession\r\nwas abandoned, the next individual, or the next tribe who occupied that\r\nspot, had the right of possession. When tribes ceased to wander about,\r\nthe occupancy of the spot which the tribe had taken possession of became\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the title to that spot grew up in the tribe along with\r\npermanent possession. _No civilization was ever created by wandering\r\ntribes._ It is only when the tribe fixes its permanent residence in\r\nsome particular spot, recognized as exclusively its own, that there is\r\nany such thing as law and order and civilization. It is clear enough\r\nwhen we consider one tribe in its relations to other tribes. Let us\r\nconsider the tribe in its relations to its members. Each individual in\r\nthe beginning had a title _by occupancy_ to the spot which he cultivated,\r\nand this security of possession lasted so long as the occupancy lasted.\r\nIf the tribesman abandoned his spot of land, with the intent to surrender\r\nthe same, then the next fortunate tribesman who came along could take\r\npossession of it and hold it. But, in the course of time, this created\r\ngreat inconvenience, because, as favored spots became more desirable,\r\nthe competition to get them was fiercer. Hence, there were feuds, bloody\r\nstruggles, disorders in the tribe. Consequently, by natural evolution\r\nsociety was forced, first, to recognize the right of the individual as\r\nlong as he wished to occupy the spot which he had taken possession of;\r\nsecond _to provide for the succession to that title when the spot became\r\nvacant_.\r\n\r\nThe learned men tell us that, at the death of the occupant, his own\r\nfamily, _his own children_, being naturally the first who would know that\r\nhe was dead, _were naturally the first who would take possession after\r\nhis death_. Therefore, the sons of the deceased tenant always became\r\nthe first occupants of the vacant land which had been left vacant by\r\nthe death of their father. This succession of the sons to the fathers\r\nbecoming universal, was finally recognized by the law of the tribe; and\r\nin the course of time it was recognized further in the law which allowed\r\nthe tenant to make a will and to say who should take his property after\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\nThus by slow and almost imperceptible degrees, the tribe recognized,\r\nfirst, the right of the man who had made a farm to hold it as long as\r\nhe lived; second, the right of his children to follow in his footsteps\r\nand to receive the benefit of that which their father had created by\r\nhis labor; third, and last, came the law of wills and testaments which\r\nallowed the tribesman to say what should go with his property after his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIf the occupant died without heirs and without having made a will, the\r\nland went back to the tribe, or the state, to be disposed of as public\r\nproperty. This principle is recognized to this day in the doctrine of\r\nescheats.\r\n\r\nProperty in land differs in nowise from property in horses and cows.\r\nThe law of property is the same naturally in real estate as in personal\r\nestate, and I can conceive of no revenue in any community which is so\r\njust as that which lays itself with an equal burden upon all kinds of\r\nproperty in proportion to the amount thereof. In the beginning, one\r\ntribesman, like Abraham or Lot, might have his cattle browsing upon a\r\nthousand hills, while another tribesman might have made a little farm\r\nin some secluded valley, or upon some thirsty, rocky mountain-side\r\nwhere vines were planted, or where olive trees bore their fruit to the\r\nindustrious citizen who had year in and year out watched and tended their\r\ngrowth. Would there be any justice in compelling those little farmers to\r\nsupply the revenue for the common purpose of the tribe, and not compel a\r\ncontribution _pro rata_ from the men who owned “exceeding many flocks and\r\nherds”?\r\n\r\nThe trouble about these doctrinaires is that they start at the present\r\nday and reason backward, while I start at the fountain head and reason\r\ndown. I take things as history shows them to have been; they take things\r\nas they think they ought to have been.\r\n\r\nThe doctrinaire further says that if the tribesman who made a farm had\r\nbeen satisfied to fence in his farm, only, _the common_ would have\r\nremained after all had been supplied. In this country, we have millions\r\nof acres of “commons” now waiting any one “member of the tribe” who wants\r\nto go and take his share. The truth of it is, the doctrinaire doesn’t\r\nwant to go out into the wild land and _make a farm_. He wants to stay\r\nwhere he is, and _take one that some other fellow has made_. Especially\r\ndoth he crave a slice of the Astor estate, which doctrinaires have\r\ntalked of so much that they can almost identify their shares therein.\r\n\r\nOne of the doctrinaires quotes the following from “Progress and Poverty”:\r\n“If a fair distribution of land were made among the whole population,\r\ngiving to each his equal share, and laws enacted which would impose a\r\nbarrier to the tendency to concentration, by forbidding the holding by\r\nanyone of more than a fixed amount, what would become of the increased\r\npopulation?”\r\n\r\nI do not consider it any part of my task to assail the position taken\r\nin “Progress and Poverty,” but I think it a satisfactory answer to the\r\nforegoing question to say that in the very nature of things posterity\r\nmust be the heirs-at-law of the conditions of those who went before. To\r\nsay that we can so frame a social fabric as flexibly and automatically\r\nto give an equal share of everything to every child born into the world\r\nhereafter, regardless of whether that child’s parents were thrifty,\r\nindustrious, virtuous people, or, on the other hand, were thriftless,\r\nindolent, vicious people, seems to me to be one of the wildest dreams\r\nthat ever entered the human mind. No matter how equal material conditions\r\nmight be made today by legislation, the inherent inequality in the\r\ncapacities of men, physically, mentally, spiritually, would evolve\r\ndifferences tomorrow. There is no such thing as equality among men, and\r\nno law will ever give it to them. What the father gains the children\r\nlose; and the grandchildren may regain. While one man runs the race of\r\nlife and wins it; another man, equally tall and strong will run the race\r\nand lose it. Just why, it is, in some cases, difficult to tell.\r\n\r\nSome men naturally lead; some naturally follow; some naturally command;\r\nothers naturally obey: some are naturally strong; others are naturally\r\nweak. The law of life to some is activity; others say that they were\r\nborn tired; and there is a certain pathos in their excuse for indolence,\r\nfor they _were_ born tired. One man is naturally brave—physically,\r\nmorally—and he will venture. Another man is naturally a coward—physically\r\nor morally—and he will not venture. A dozen different traits, or\r\ncombination of traits, make failure or success in life, and to say that\r\nsuccess or failure, vice and virtue, good and bad, are the results of\r\nenvironment and social conditions, is as misleading, _as a general\r\nstatement of fundamental facts_, as to say that the dove and the hawk,\r\nthe tiger and the sheep, the rattlesnake and the harmless “black runner”\r\nare the results of environment. Nature in its act of creation made the\r\ndifference between the fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, the\r\nfish of the sea, the men and women who inhabit the earth. From the\r\nremotest ages, of which we have record, human nature has been the same\r\nthat it is today. Paganism presented precisely the same types of man in\r\nits savagery and its civilization that Christianity now presents in its\r\nsavagery and civilization. “There is nothing new under the sun,” and the\r\nvery theories which the doctrinaires now think are matters of modern\r\ndiscovery, unknown to our ancestors, and which would have been adopted\r\nhad our ancestors been as wise as we, were discussed in the days of\r\nAristotle and had the very best thought of the sages of antiquity.\r\n\r\nLet it be remembered, however, that I have always qualified the Private\r\nOwnership of Land by acknowledging the supremacy of the State. The tribe,\r\nthe community, the State, the Government holds supreme power over the\r\nlife and liberty of citizens, and over the ownership of the soil. The\r\nState calls for me to give up my individual pursuits, my individual\r\nliberty, my individual preference, and to take my place as a soldier in\r\nthe ranks of the army. I am compelled to obey; that is an obligation\r\nwhich rests upon me as a member of society. Thus the State can demand\r\nmy life of me whenever the State declares that it is necessary for the\r\ndefence of the State. In like manner, the State can restrain me of my\r\nliberty. For instance, in times of epidemics, we have shotgun quarantine\r\nwhich destroys my liberty of movement. I would be shot down like a dog\r\nif I sought to break through the lines of quarantine, although to make\r\nsuch an escape might mean my individual salvation, whereas obedience to\r\nlaw amounts to sentence of death. In this case, as in the other, the\r\nState practically demands my life as an individual as a sacrifice for\r\nthe good of the greater number of citizens. So, as to property, no man\r\nholds an absolute title to land as against the State. The Government,\r\nacting for all the tribe, for all the people, can tear down or burn my\r\nhouse to stop the spread of fire. It can confiscate my property for\r\npublic purposes, when the public need requires it. It can take my land\r\nfor public buildings, for canals, for railroads, or for new dirt roads\r\nthrough the country. My rights in the premises would be recognized in\r\nthe payment to me of damages. My individual rights would be assessed in\r\nso many dollars and cents. Thus my home, which might be almost as dear\r\nto me as my life, would be coldly valued in money, and although I left\r\nit with bitter regrets, even with bitter tears and a bitter sense of\r\nwrong, I would have to surrender my individual preference to what is\r\nsupposed to be by constituted authorities the necessity of the State.\r\nThis right of the public to take away any portion of the soil from the\r\nindividual, and to dedicate it to the use of the public, is called\r\nthe right of Eminent Domain, and is a remnant of the old system which\r\nrecognized that the title to all the lands was in the King. Of course the\r\nKing stood for the State. Centered in the personal sovereign were those\r\nsovereign rights which belong to the people as a whole, and the people\r\nas a whole, represented by the King, were admitted to be the owners\r\nof the ultimate fee in the land, and could compel any individual to\r\nsurrender his individual holdings for the benefit of the entire people,\r\njust compensation having first been paid to the individual. It is in that\r\nsense that I say private ownership of land is just as holy a principle,\r\njust as equitable, as private ownership in the basket which I made from\r\nthe rushes I gathered along the stream, or from the splints which I rived\r\nout from the white oak; just as sacred as my right to the boat which I\r\nhollowed out from the forest tree, or the bark hut, or the hut of skins,\r\nwhich my labor erected to shelter me and my family.\r\n\r\nThe doctrinaire asks: “Could he not be as secure in his possession if the\r\nland were owned and exaction made by all the people?” Certainly. That is\r\nmy contention. The whole tribe _did_ exercise dominion over the land, but\r\nto encourage the individual member of the tribe to improve a particular\r\nportion of the wild land, the tribe agreed to protect the individual in\r\nthat which his labor had created, namely a _farm_. My contention now is\r\nthat the ultimate ownership of the land is in all the people; but society\r\nhad a perfect right to divide it on such terms as were thought best and\r\nto guarantee to each individual “security of possession,” or _title_, to\r\nthat which he had produced. The great trouble with Mr. Doctrinaire is\r\nthat he does not begin at the beginning. If he would study the condition\r\nof the human race as it gradually evolved from the patriarchal state, the\r\ntribal state, the nomad state, into that fixed and complex status which\r\nwe now call “Christian Civilization,” he would readily understand how\r\nprivate ownership of land was the axis upon which the improvement of the\r\nconditions of the individual and of the State turned. As long as tribes\r\nwandered about from province to province, with their herds of goats, or\r\nsheep, or cattle, nibbling the grass which nature put up, and moving\r\nonward to another pasture as fast as one was exhausted, there could be\r\nnothing but tent life, nothing but personal property. The house had to\r\nmove every time the family moved. Therefore, when the herds devoured the\r\ngrass in one place, and the tribe had to move to another, tents were\r\nstruck, the few household goods were packed on the backs of the wives, or\r\non the backs of other beasts of burden, and the family moved. When man\r\nand beast multiplied to such an extent that nature no longer supplied a\r\nsufficiency of food, it became necessary for the tribe to settle down,\r\nand to divide the territory upon which they settled among the various\r\nmembers of the tribe. That was done in Germany, as well as in various\r\nother countries, but I take Germany because the German tribes were our\r\nown ancestors. They divided the lands every year. It was seldom the case\r\nthat the same tribesman occupied the same home for more than one year.\r\nLike the Methodist preachers of today, their homes were always on the\r\ngo. The farmer’s home in those days was precisely like the Methodist\r\npreachers’ homes today—a matter to be fixed at the annual conference.\r\nThe Methodist preacher who today is preaching in the town may next year\r\nbe sent into the remote rural precincts: the mountain parson may next\r\nyear be sent to the seaboard. The church is fixed and the parsonage is\r\nstationary, but the preacher and his wife and his children are forever\r\nmoving. Now in precisely the same manner the tribesmen of the German\r\ntribes used to be going from farm to farm, and there were no considerable\r\nimprovements made while that state of affairs existed. Why? Because we\r\nare just so constituted that we do not care to build houses for other\r\npeople to live in, if we know it. When we start out to beautify a home,\r\nwe may never enjoy it, but we expect to do so at the time, and without\r\nthat expectation there would be no beautiful homes.\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire thinks because each tribesman would try to grab the\r\nbest piece of land, there was original injustice in allowing private\r\nownership. If he will think for a moment, he will realize that the native\r\nselfishness of man does not make against the private ownership of land\r\nto any further extent than it does to the private ownership of personal\r\nproperty. When the tribesmen went out to hunt, each hunter sought\r\nto bring down the finest stag. Each hunter naturally wanted to hunt\r\nwhere the best game was to be found. Hence those eternal wars between\r\nthe Indian tribes which brought down the population on the American\r\ncontinent. Hence also those feuds and tribal wars which desolated the\r\nEast in the times of nomad life.\r\n\r\nWe find Abraham and Lot in a bitter dispute over a certain pasture; but\r\nas to the well which Abraham “had digged” there was no resisting his\r\nclaim, that _well was his property_. Why? Because in the quaint language\r\nof the Bible, “He had digged that well.” In other words, while nature put\r\nthe water in under the soil, and while nature made the soil itself, it\r\nwas Abraham’s judgment which selected the place where he could find the\r\nwater, and it was Abraham’s labor that removed the earth which covered\r\nthe water. In other words, Abraham _made the well_, in precisely the same\r\nsense that the pioneer in the wilderness _makes a farm_.\r\n\r\nBut, as I said, the competitive principle, each one wanting to get what\r\nis best, reveals itself in all directions. Every fisherman has always\r\nwanted the best fishing grounds. Nations have been brought to war by this\r\ncause, to say nothing of tribal disputes and individual contests.\r\n\r\nNowhere have I contended that it was private ownership of land that\r\nmade it possible for the laborer to claim and retain the product of his\r\nlabor. I could not have said that because I know quite well that personal\r\nproperty preceded property in land. In other words, the laborers acquired\r\na full title to the rude garments in which they clothed themselves, the\r\nrude implements which they used in the chase, their weapons, canoes,\r\netc., long before they ever made farms. This has been explained fully\r\nelsewhere and does not at all antagonize the statement that _after_\r\na tribesman has acquired by his labor an interest in the land, _the\r\ngovernment of the tribe may be so arranged that the produce of the\r\nland will be taken away from the land-owner as fast as he produces\r\nit_. Instead of robbery by taxation in land—products preceding private\r\nownership in land—the reverse is the case. To fleece the laborer of what\r\nhe produces on his farm was the after-thought of those who governed the\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nThis is shown by the wretchedness of the peasant class in Russia today.\r\nHistorians tell us that the Russian peasant formerly owned a very\r\nconsiderable portion of the land, just as the French peasants did,\r\nand in addition to the individual ownership which was in the Russian\r\npeasantry, there was a large quantity of communal land which belonged\r\nto each community of peasants as a whole. In the process of time, the\r\nruling class in Russia put such burdens upon the peasant proprietor that\r\nhe gradually lost his land and became a serf. Of course, Mr. Doctrinaire\r\nrecalls that in 1860 the serfs of Russia were freed, and they were given\r\na large portion of the land which had been taken away from them by the\r\nRussian nobles. They also held the communal lands. What has been the\r\nresult? The ruling classes have put such heavy burdens in the way of dues\r\nand taxes upon the peasants that their ownership of the land, communal\r\nand individual, has brought them none of the blessings which they\r\nanticipated. Thus we have a striking and contemporaneous illustration of\r\nthe great truth which I have sought to emphasize, namely, that the mere\r\nownership of land does not emancipate the people.\r\n\r\nArthur Young, the famous “Suffolk Squire,” rode horseback over the rural\r\ndistricts of France, just before the Revolution broke out. He found\r\nthat the French peasants owned their own farms. He made a close and\r\nsympathetic study of their condition.\r\n\r\nAnd what was that condition?\r\n\r\nWretched to the very limit of human endurance. The king, the noble, and\r\nthe priest were literally devouring the Common People. Privilege, Titles,\r\nTaxes, Feudal dues were driving the masses to despair, to desperation.\r\n\r\nYet the French peasant had “access to the land.”\r\n\r\nIn England, at that time, the peasants did not own land, and yet their\r\ncondition was incomparably better than that of the French.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because they were _not_ ground down by Taxes and Feudal dues.\r\n\r\nCould you ask a more convincing illustration?\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire makes the point that when one member of the tribe decided\r\nto undertake the arduous task of making a farm out of a few acres of the\r\nmillions which belonged to the tribe, this industrious member of the\r\ncommunity “robbed” all the others when he claimed as his own that which\r\nhis hands had made. I can see no more “robbery” in this case than in that\r\nof another tribesman who went and cut down one of the millions of forest\r\ntrees which belonged to the tribe, and with painful labor hollowed out\r\nthis tree and created a canoe. At the time the one tribesman made the\r\ncanoe, every other tribesman had the same chance to do the same thing.\r\nAt the time the one tribesman went into the woods and made a farm every\r\nother tribesman had the same right. If Mr. Doctrinaire thinks that the\r\nfirst occupant of any particular spot did not have the right to locate a\r\nfarm, he might as well say that the first finder of the cavern, or the\r\nhollow tree, did not have the right to occupy that which he had first\r\nfound, and yet he knows perfectly well that this right of discovery and\r\noccupancy was always recognized from the beginning of time and that\r\nfrom the very nature of things it had to be recognized to prevent the\r\nbloodiest feuds in every tribe. (A curious survival of this Right of\r\nDiscovery is to be seen even now in the claim to the “Bee Tree” by the\r\nfirst to find it.)\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire says, impliedly, that if the tribesman had fenced in no\r\nmore than the spot out of which he had made a farm, injustice would not\r\nhave been done to the tribe: but he says the tribesman went further and\r\nfenced in a great deal more—“vast areas,” which he could not use, and\r\nalso “claimed” these as his own. How does Mr. Doctrinaire know that?\r\nI did not state anything of the sort. Nor does the historian state\r\nanything of the sort. I was tracing title to land to its origin, and\r\nI contended that the origin of title to land was labor. Consequently,\r\nmy contention was that the tribesman fenced in that which his labor\r\nhad redeemed from the wilderness—his original purpose in fencing it in\r\nbeing _partly_ to identify what was his own, _partly_ to assert his\r\nexclusive possession, _but chiefly_ to protect his crop from the ravages\r\nof the wild animals that were still roaming at large in the forest. Mr.\r\nDoctrinaire must remember that the fencing of the farm was one of the\r\nmost tremendous difficulties that the pioneer met with. _He_ had no\r\nbarbed wire; _he_ had no woven wire, _he_ had no convenient sawmill from\r\nwhich he could haul plank. No; _he_ had to cut down enormous trees, and\r\nby the hardest labor known to physical manhood, he had to split those\r\ntrees into rails, and with these rails fence in that little dominion\r\nwhich he rescued from “the wild,” that little oasis in a great desert of\r\nsavagery.\r\n\r\nTo put up the fence was heroic work. To keep it up was just as heroic,\r\nfor forest fires destroyed it from time to time, and the pioneer had\r\nto replace the barrier against the encroachment of animal life and the\r\ninroads of savagery with as great a tenacity and as sublime a courage as\r\nthat of the people of Holland, who tore their country from the clutches\r\nof the ocean and barred out the sea with dikes. Tell me, that after the\r\npioneer had created this little paradise of his—rude though it might have\r\nbeen—amidst the terrors and the toils and sacrifices of that life in the\r\nwilderness, _it should be taken from him by the first man who coveted it,\r\nand who said, “HERE, TAKE YOUR CROP, THAT IS ALL YOU ARE ENTITLED TO:\r\nTAKE YOUR CROP AND GIVE ME YOUR FARM!”_ Would that have been _right_, at\r\nthe time private property was first recognized by our people in Germany?\r\nWould that have been right at the time our pioneer farmers in New England\r\nand Virginia created their farms, endured difficulties and dangers which\r\nmake them stand out in heroic outline on the canvas of history? No, by\r\nthe splendor of God! It would have been robbery and nothing less than\r\nrobbery for the tribe to have confiscated the farm which the pioneer\r\nof America had made—partly with his rifle, partly with his axe, partly\r\nwith his spade—and throw it into the common lot where the idler and the\r\ncriminal would have just as much benefit from it as the pioneer _who had\r\nmade the farm_.\r\n\r\nAs to _the abuse of land ownership_, that is an entirely different\r\nquestion. I agree that there should be no monopoly of land for\r\nspeculative purposes. The platform of the People’s Party has constantly\r\nkept that declaration as a part of its creed. The abuse of land ownership\r\nis quite a different thing from land ownership itself. I am not defending\r\nany of its abuses. I am simply saying that _the principle_ is sound. All\r\nthose things which belong to the class of _private utilities_ should\r\nbe left to private ownership, because I believe in individualism; but\r\nall those things which partake of the nature of public utilities should\r\nbelong to the public.\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire says that railroads have their power based in the fixed\r\nprinciple of private ownership of land. I deny this utterly. It was\r\nalways necessary for the civilized community to have public roads.\r\nEven the Indians had their great trails which were in the nature of\r\npublic roads. A public road never of itself did anything injurious to a\r\ncommunity. The taking of land for a public road confers a benefit upon\r\nthe entire community. It is for that reason it is laid out. The amount\r\nof land which is taken for a road, whether you cover it with blocks of\r\nstone, as the Romans did, or whether you cover it with iron rails, as\r\nmodern corporations do, can inflict no injury whatever upon the community\r\n_unless you go further_. For instance, if you erect toll gates on the\r\npublic highways and vest in some corporation the right to charge toll\r\non freight and passengers at those toll rates, then you have erected a\r\ntyranny which can rob the traveler and injure the community. In that\r\ncase, you can clearly see it is _not the road_, it is _not the land over_\r\nwhich the road passes, that is hurting the individual and the public.\r\n_The thing which hurts is that franchise_ which empowers the corporation\r\nto tax the citizens and the property of the citizens as they pass along\r\nthat highway. In like manner, the road which the transportation companies\r\nuse could never have inflicted harm upon individuals or communities. _The\r\nthing which hurts is the franchise_ which empowers the corporation to rob\r\nthe people with unjust freight and passenger tolls as they pass along the\r\nhighway.\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire mires up badly in trying to evade the point which I\r\nmade about Italy. I contended that while it was true that great estates\r\nwere the ruin of Italy, there had to be some general cause at work,\r\ninjurious to the average man, before the soil could be concentrated into\r\nthese great estates. This is very obvious to anyone who will stop to\r\nthink a moment. Mr. Doctrinaire thinks that the great estates in Italy\r\nwere acquired by simply claiming the land and fencing it in, by “each\r\nindividual claiming far more than he could use.” If all the land of\r\nItaly had been claimed and enclosed, the power that these land claimers\r\nhad over subsequent comers is obvious; but _how_ did “the claimers” get\r\nthe lands? The most superficial knowledge of Roman History ought to\r\nconvince Mr. Doctrinaire that _Italy was cut up into small holdings_\r\nuntil one branch of the government, the aristocracy, represented by the\r\nSenate, gathered into its own hands by persistent encroachment all the\r\npowers of the State. After that had been done, they fixed the machinery\r\nof government so that the aristocracy were almost entirely exempt from\r\npublic burdens, whereas the common people had to bear not only their\r\njust portion, but also the portion which the aristocracy shirked.\r\nThe ruling class, the patricians, not only escaped their burdens in\r\nupholding the State but they _appropriated to themselves_ the revenue\r\nwhich the Roman State exacted from the lower class, the plebeians. The\r\nresult was that the Italian peasant found himself unable to sustain the\r\nburdens which the government put upon him and he abandoned his farm,\r\njust as the French peasant quit the land, for the same reason, prior\r\nto the French Revolution. In other words, _the small proprietor had to\r\nsell out to the patrician_, and the patricians got these great estates\r\nin the same manner that Rockefeller, for instance, got the estate\r\nwhich he now holds at Tarrytown. The Standard Oil King did not simply\r\nstretch his wires and “claim” land. He bought out the people who found\r\nthemselves unable or unwilling to hold their lands. Rockefeller stood\r\nrelatively on the same ground of advantage held by the Roman patricians.\r\nGovernmental favoritism, and special privilege, the power of money which\r\nhe had attained through unjust laws, made him more able to buy than the\r\nindividual owners around him were to hold. _Therefore he absorbed the\r\nsmall estates_, and his estate became the “great estate,” just as such\r\ngreat estates were created in Italy.\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire can see the process going on around us. He can see how\r\ngreat estates absorb small estates. Our legislation for one hundred years\r\nhas been in the interest of capital against labor. A plutocracy which\r\nenjoys the principal benefits of government, and contributes almost\r\nnothing to the support of the government, has been built up: charters\r\nhave been granted by which large corporations exploit the public; and in\r\nthis way great estates, whether in stocks or bonds, or gold, or land,\r\nhave been created.\r\n\r\nThe same principles, the same favoritism, the same privilege, working\r\nin different ways, brought about the same results in France before the\r\nRevolution, in Rome before its downfall, in Egypt, in Persia, in the\r\nBabylonian Empire. If there is any one word which can be appropriately\r\nused as an epitaph for all the dead nations of antiquity, that word is\r\n“_privilege_.” The government was operated by a ruling class for the\r\nbenefit of that class, and the result was national decay, national death.\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire asks me: “How did the ruling class at Rome come\r\nto control the money?” I might answer by asking him: “How did the\r\ncontrolling class in the United States come into control of the money?”\r\nHe would certainly admit that they have got control of it. How did\r\nthey get it? They took into their own hands, in the days of Alexander\r\nHamilton, the control of governmental machinery. They erected a tariff\r\nsystem to give special privileges to manufacturers. Out of this has come\r\nthe monopoly which the manufacturers enjoy of the American market, and\r\nthe natural evolution of the tariff act which Alexander Hamilton put upon\r\nour statute book more than one hundred years ago, produced The Trusts.\r\n\r\nAgain, the power to create a circulating medium to be used as money and\r\nto expand and contract this circulating medium, thereby controlling the\r\nrise and fall of markets, was a vicious principle embedded into our\r\nsystem by, Alexander Hamilton, more than one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nAgain, the granting of charters to private companies to exploit\r\npublic utilities is another means by which our patrician class has\r\nsecured the control of money. Now at Rome there was a similar process.\r\nInstrumentalities were different, the names of things were different,\r\nbut the ruling class at Rome had the power of fixing the taxes, and they\r\nappropriated to themselves the proceeds of these taxes. They had the\r\npower of legislation in their hands and exploited the public for their\r\nown benefit. In this way they secured, of course, the control of money.\r\nThe one advantage of paying no tax themselves and of appropriating to\r\nthemselves the taxes which they levied upon the plebeians was sufficient\r\nto give them not only the control of money, but the control of the land\r\nand of the man. In fact that tremendous power, to fix the taxes and to\r\nappropriate the public revenue, is all that the ruling class of any\r\ncountry need have in order to establish an intolerable despotism over\r\nthe unfavored classes.\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire has the fatal habit of crawling backwards with his logic.\r\nHe says that the Roman Patrician could not have controlled the money\r\nuntil he got control of the land. The slightest reflection ought to\r\nconvince him that this cannot be true. No class of men ever secured the\r\ncontrol of money by merely controlling the land. Just the reverse is the\r\nuniversal truth. Without any exception whatsoever governmental machinery,\r\nthe taxing system, usury, expansion and contraction of the currency hold\r\nthe land-owner at their mercy. The land-owner, as such, never had them at\r\nhis mercy and he never will.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the crawl-backwards method of reasoning is given\r\nwhen Mr. Doctrinaire says that _usury grew out of land monopoly instead\r\nof land monopoly growing out of usury_. When a man gets himself into\r\nsuch a state of mind that he can deliberately write a statement of that\r\nsort for publication, he is beyond reach of any ordinary process of\r\nconviction and conversion. My statement was that usury is a vulture that\r\nhas gorged itself upon the vitals of nations since the beginning of time.\r\nMr. Doctrinaire says this is not true. On the other hand, he says that\r\nland monopoly came first, and _then_ usury. If the rich people got all\r\nthe land first, so that they had a land monopoly, upon whom did they\r\npractice usury? _How could they fatten on those who had nothing?_ If Mr.\r\nDoctrinaire is at all familiar with the trouble between the Russians and\r\nthe Jews in Russia he knows that one of the accusations brought by the\r\nRussian against the Jew is that the Russian land-owner has been devoured\r\nby the money-lending Jew. If he knows anything about our agricultural\r\ntroubles in the South and in the West, he knows that the Southern and\r\nWestern farmer complains that he has been devoured by usury. If he\r\nknows anything about the history of the Russian serf, he knows that the\r\nmoney-lending patricians made serfs out of the small land-owners by\r\nusury. If he will study the subject, he will find that in Rome, Egypt and\r\nAssyria the small land-owner was devoured by usury, had to part with his\r\nproperty and thus surrender to those who were piling up great fortunes by\r\ngovernmental privilege and by the control of money.\r\n\r\nTake the Rothschild family for an example. Did they have a land monopoly\r\nwhich made it possible for them to wield the vast powers of usury?\r\nTheirs is a typical case. Study it a moment. A small Jewish dealer and\r\nmoney-lender in Frankfort is chosen by a rascally ruler of one of the\r\nGerman States as a go-between in a villainous transaction whereby the\r\nlittle German ruler sells his subjects into military service to the\r\nKing of England. These soldiers, who were bought, are known to history\r\nas the Hessians, and they fought against us in the Revolutionary War.\r\nThis was the beginning of the Rothschild fortune, the transaction having\r\nbeen very profitable to the Rothschild who managed it. Later, during\r\nthe Napoleonic Wars, the character of a Rothschild for trustworthiness\r\nbecame established among princes and kings who were confederated against\r\nNapoleon and many of the financial dealings of that day were made through\r\nhim. Of course, these huge financial transactions were profitable to\r\nthe Rothschild. Again, a certain German ruler, during those troublesome\r\ntimes, entrusted all of his cash to the safe-keeping of a Rothschild,\r\nthe purpose being to put the money where Napoleon would not get it. For\r\nmany years the Rothschild had the benefit of this capital, and he put\r\nit out to the very best advantage in loans and speculations, here and\r\nthere. By the time Napoleon was overthrown at Waterloo the Rothschild\r\nfamily had become so rich and strong that it spread over the European\r\nworld. One member of the family took England, another France, another\r\nAustria, another Belgium, the parent house remaining in Germany, and to\r\nthis day the Rothschild family is the dominant financial influence of\r\nthe European world. In other words, _by the power of money and the power\r\nof usury_, they were able to make a partition of Europe and they are more\r\ntruly the rulers of nations than are the Hapsburgs, the Hohenzollerns,\r\nthe Romanoffs, or any other one dynasty which nominally wields the\r\nsceptre.\r\n\r\nNow, can Mr. Doctrinaire ask for a better illustration of the truth of\r\nmy statement that the power of money is not based upon the monopoly\r\nof land; and that the monopoly of land is the fruitage of the tree of\r\nusury? Originally, the Rothschilds owned no land. It was only after they\r\nhad become so rich that they were compelled to look around for good\r\ninvestments that they began to buy real estate. Their vast fortune,\r\nwhich staggers the human mind in the effort to comprehend it, was not\r\nthe growth of land monopoly, but _was the growth of usury_. What the\r\nRothschilds have done in modern times, men of like character did in\r\nancient times, and just as the modern world will decay and collapse if\r\nthese evil accumulations be not prevented, so in ancient times people\r\nwent to decay and extinction because no method of reform was found in\r\ntime to work salvation.\r\n\r\nMr. Doctrinaire asks me what is the cause of the Standard Oil monopoly. I\r\nthought that if there was any one thing we all agreed about it was that\r\nthe Standard Oil monopoly had its origin in violations of law, in the\r\nillegal use of those public roads which are called transportation lines,\r\nthe secret rebate, the discriminating service, the favoritism which the\r\ntransportation company can exercise in favor of one shipper against all\r\nothers, to the destruction of competition. You might end land monopoly,\r\nbut as long as the railroad franchises exist, the Standard Oil monopoly\r\nwill exist, if they can get the favored illegal treatment which they\r\ngot in the building up of their monopoly and which they still have in\r\nsustaining it. The power of Privilege in securing money, and the power\r\nof money in destroying competition, was never more strikingly evident\r\nthan in the colossal growth of Standard Oil. Mr. Doctrinaire might own\r\nhalf the oil wells in America, but unless he made terms with the Standard\r\nhe would never get his oil on the market at a profit. The Big-Pistol\r\nis not the ownership of the oil-well. The Big-Pistol is the mis-use of\r\nfranchises.\r\n\r\nWith all the power that is in me, I am fighting the frightful conditions\r\nwhich beset us, but I know, as well as I know anything, that the\r\nprinciple of the private ownership of land has had nothing whatever to do\r\nwith our trouble.\r\n\r\nRepeal the laws which grant the Privileges that lead to Monopoly;\r\nequalize the taxes; make the rich support the government in proportion to\r\ntheir wealth; restore public utilities to the public; put the power of\r\nself-government back into the hands of the people by Direct Legislation;\r\nrestore our Constitutional system of finance; pay off the National debt\r\nand wipe out the National banking system; quit giving public money to\r\npet banks for private benefit; remove all taxes from the necessaries of\r\nlife; establish postal savings banks; return to us the God-given right to\r\nfreedom of trade.\r\n\r\nWith these reforms in operation, millionaires would cease to multiply and\r\nfewer Americans would be paupers. Trusts would not tyrannize over the\r\nlaborer and the consumer, Corporations could not plunder a people whose\r\npolitical leaders they have bought. Some statesman might again declare as\r\nLegaré declared twenty years before the Civil War: “WE HAVE NO POOR.”\r\n\r\nEnglish travelers might have no occasion to say, as Rider Haggard said\r\nlast year, that our condition was becoming so intolerable that there must\r\nbe reform or revolution. On the contrary, the English travelers might say\r\nonce more, as Charles Dickens said in 1843, that an Angel with a flaming\r\nsword would attract less attention than a beggar in the streets.\r\n\r\nAnd with these reforms accomplished any man in America who wanted to work\r\na farm of his own could do it.\r\n\r\nI cannot promise that he would get one of the corner lots of the Astor\r\nestate, but I have no doubt whatever that if he really wanted a farm,\r\nand were willing to take it a few miles outside of the city, town, or\r\nvillage, he could get just as much land as he cared to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom Comment\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott used to say that he had never met any man from whom he\r\ncould not learn something. No matter how ignorant the humblest citizen\r\nmay appear to be, the chances are that he knows a few things which you do\r\nnot know; and if you will “draw him out” you will add to your knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia negro who happened to pass along the road while the Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court of the United States was puzzling his brains\r\nover the problem of mending his broken sulky-shaft, knew exactly the one\r\nthing which John Marshall did not know.\r\n\r\nThe great lawyer was at his wit’s end, helpless and wretched. How could\r\nhe mend that broken shaft and continue his journey? He did not know and\r\nhe turned to the negro for instruction.\r\n\r\nWith an air of superiority which was not offensive at that particular\r\ntime, the negro drew his pocket-knife, stepped into the bushes, cut a\r\nsapling, whittled a brace and spliced the broken shaft.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chief Justice expressed his wonder, admiration and pleasure, the\r\nnegro calmly accepted the tribute to his talent and walked off, remarking,\r\n\r\n“_Some_ folks has got sense and some ain’t got none.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat little story is a hundred years old, but it’s a right good little\r\nstory. A school-teacher, whom I loved very dearly, told it to me when\r\nI was a kid. He was the only man I ever knew who had it in him to be a\r\ngreat man, and who refused to strive for great things because, as he\r\nsaid, “_It isn’t worth the trouble_.”\r\n\r\nHe was naturally as great an orator as Blaine or Ben Hill. He was far and\r\naway a loftier type than Bryan, for he had those three essentials which\r\nBryan lacks—humor, pathos and self-forgetful intensity of feeling. But\r\nafter one of his magnificent displays of oratory he would sink back into\r\njolly indolence, and pursue the even tenor of his way, teaching school.\r\n“It is not worth while. Let the other fellows toil and struggle for fame\r\nand for office, I don’t care. They are not worth the price.”\r\n\r\nFew knew what was in this obscure teacher, but those few knew him to be a\r\ngiant.\r\n\r\nOnce, at our College Commencement, the speaker who had been invited\r\nto make the regular address was the crack orator of the state. He was\r\nconsidered a marvel of eloquence. Well, he came and he delivered his\r\nmessage; and it was all very chaste and elegant and superb. Indeed, a\r\nfine speech.\r\n\r\nHe sat down amid loud applause. Everybody satisfied. Then the obscure\r\ngenius to whom I have referred rose to talk. By some chance the faculty\r\nhad given him a place on the program.\r\n\r\nI looked at my old school-teacher as he waddled quietly to the front. I\r\nsaw that his face was pale and his eyes blazing with fire. I felt that\r\nthe presence and the speech of the celebrated orator had aroused the\r\nindolent giant. I knew he would carry that crowd by storm—would rise,\r\nrise into the very azure of eloquence and hover above us like an eagle in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nAnd he did.\r\n\r\nMen and women, boys and girls, laughed and cheered and cried, and hung\r\nbreathless on his every word, as no crowd ever does unless a born orator\r\ngets hold of them. Actually I got to feeling sorry for the celebrity\r\nwho had made the set speech. He sat there looking like a cheap piece of\r\nneglected toy-work of last Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe faces of the leading people after my old teacher had sat down, were\r\na study. The expression seemed to say, “Who would have thought it was in\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nI don’t think he ever made another speech.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant eyes will blaze no more. The merry smile faded long ago.\r\nThe great head, that was fit to bear a crown, lies low for all the years\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nHe left no lasting memorial of his genius. Only, as through a glass\r\ndarkly, you may see him, in a book called “Bethany,” written by one in\r\nwhom he, the unambitious, kindled the spark of an ambition which will\r\nnever die.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere being no smokers in the “smoker,” I went in there to stretch out.\r\nThe Florida East Coastline train was working its way down the peninsula,\r\nand was doing it very leisurely.\r\n\r\nInto the “smoker” came a young fellow with whom I opened conversation. It\r\nturned out that he had been pretty much all over Europe. He had toured\r\nGermany several times. On the Sir Walter Scott principle, I sought\r\nknowledge from him, and he told me several interesting things.\r\n\r\nOne evening he had been at Heidelberg when the soldiers mounted guard.\r\nThis being a regular function many civilians had assembled to see it.\r\n\r\nAn officer was putting the men through some of their exercises, when, at\r\nthe order to “ground arms,” one of the privates let his gun down too slow.\r\n\r\nThe officer flew into a rage, rushed up to the soldier, slapped his jaws,\r\nkicked him repeatedly on the shins, struck him with the flat of his\r\nsword, and _spat time and again in the man’s face_!\r\n\r\nOf course the officer was cursing the private for every vile thing he\r\ncould lay his tongue to, all the while.\r\n\r\nSaid my informant, “He not only spat in the man’s face once, but he did\r\nit four or five times.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI asked, “Was there no murmur of disgust or indignation in the crowd of\r\ncitizens who were looking on?”\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” he said. “The people took the occurrence as a matter of\r\ncourse. It happens so often.”\r\n\r\nThen the young man rose up in the smoker, and showed me how the private\r\nhad stood in his place, rigid, staring straight ahead, not daring to\r\nchange his position or expression while enduring the kicks and spits of\r\nthe officer. Not a word of protest or complaint did he venture to utter.\r\n\r\n_That’s Militarism, gone crazy._\r\n\r\nNot long ago one of our high-priced city preachers declared publicly that\r\nwe Americans needed an Emperor to head our army.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDo you recall a story which went the rounds of the newspapers a few\r\nyears ago? In substance it hinted that William Hohenzollern, Emperor of\r\nGermany, had compelled one of his young officers to kill himself.\r\n\r\nMy traveller related to me the particulars as he had learned them in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was holding a banquet, a revel, on board his yacht, the\r\n_Hohenzollern_: wine had been drunk freely; loose talk was going on. The\r\nEmperor made some insulting reference to the mother of a lieutenant who\r\nwas seated near him.\r\n\r\nUpon the impulse of the moment, the brave boy did a most natural thing—he\r\nslapped the brutal defamer of his mother in the mouth.\r\n\r\nConsternation paralyzed the Emperor and all his guests.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant left the yacht; no one tried to stop him. Going ashore,\r\nhe made ready to quit the world; and next morning he rode his bicycle\r\ndeliberately off a precipice and fell headlong to his voluntary death.\r\n\r\nAnd the high-priced, city preacher declared that _we_ needed an Emperor!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great was really a great man.\r\n\r\nRiding along the streets of Berlin one day, he saw a crowd looking up at\r\na placard on a wall, Reining his horse, the old King inquired, “What is\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nHe was told that the placard contained a lot of violent abuse of himself.\r\n\r\n“Hang it lower, so that the people can read it better,” ordered the King,\r\nand he rode on.\r\n\r\nThe pompous despot who now sits upon the throne of Frederick the Great\r\nputs girls and old women, as well as boys and men, in jail if they dare\r\nto say, or to write, anything disrespectful of _him_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIs democracy gaining ground anywhere? Are not those historic allies,\r\nthe Church and the State, encroaching steadily upon the masses? Are not\r\nthe High Priest and the War Lord constantly putting a greater distance\r\nbetween themselves and the Common People?\r\n\r\nDoes not _the individual citizen_ have less power and recognition now\r\nthan at any other time since the founding of our Government?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoor General Wheeler! After all his efforts to please Northern sentiment,\r\nthey would not permit him to be buried with the Confederate flag in his\r\ncoffin!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Nation_ is a mighty good paper, but it ought not to class General N.\r\nB. Forrest as “a scout” and “guerrilla.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Forrest was named by General Lee, during the last year of the\r\nwar, as the best soldier that the Civil War had developed.\r\n\r\nForrest was greater than his commanding general at Fort Donelson, at\r\nMurfreesborough, and at Chickamauga. He finally swore that he would not\r\nobey any more fool orders from blundering superiors, and he struck out\r\nfor himself. During the short time that he held independent command his\r\nachievements, considering his resources, rivalled those of Stonewall\r\nJackson in the Valley Campaign.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNor should _The Nation_ be too hard upon the West Point officers who\r\nfollowed their native states out of the Union. Justice to those officers\r\nrequires one to remember that they were taught at West Point that the\r\nStates had the right to secede from the Union.\r\n\r\nIf _The Nation_ will consult the text-book from which Generals Lee,\r\nJohnston, Beauregard and Wheeler were instructed in Constitutional Law,\r\nit will discover that these young officers simply put in practice that\r\nwhich their teachers had taught them to be their right.\r\n\r\nThe book to which I refer is Rawle’s work upon Constitutional Law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter General Wheeler had tried so hard to win the heart of the North,\r\n_don’t_ you think they might have allowed the Confederate flag to rest\r\nupon his folded hands?\r\n\r\n_That_ was the flag which he had followed in the storm of actual war.\r\nThe Cuban business was nothing. It was child’s play, and pitiful child’s\r\nplay at that. But the Civil War was real, was colossal, rent a continent\r\nasunder, and shook the world. It was the Confederate flag which had led\r\nWheeler to his fame. His youth, his first and best, had been given to\r\n_that_; of all the banners on earth none could have been dearer, holier\r\nto him than _that_.\r\n\r\nTo look upon it was to bring back the years and the deeds which had\r\nbrought him glory. It associated itself with the heroes who had listened\r\nto his battle-cry, and who had sanctified their sacrifice to duty with\r\ntheir blood. It spoke to him of the hopes and the griefs and the despair\r\nof his home, the South; it recalled the enthusiasm and the heartbreak;\r\nthe splendid devotion of noble women, and the resignation of conquered\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nSurely, surely the Confederate flag must have been the dearest emblem of\r\nDuty and Sacrifice to General Joe Wheeler.\r\n\r\n_Don’t_ you think that Charity might have softened the heart of the North\r\nto the old warrior who was dead, and that they might have let him rest\r\nunder the “Conquered Banner?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The House: I give you warning, old man; it’s loaded!_\r\n\r\n    _Bart, in Minneapolis Journal_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _If George Washington Came to the Capital Today_\r\n\r\n    _Morris, in Spokane Spokesman-Review_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Stirring War Drama Entitled: “Chased By the Enemy;\r\nor, Curfew Shall Not Ring This Evening”_\r\n\r\n    _Opper, in N.

SHIBLEY\r\n\r\n_President of the People’s Sovereignty League and Editor of the\r\nReferendum News._\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderneath the existing political and legislative evils in this country\r\nthere is found a common cause—the rule of the few through machine\r\npolitics. The powers of sovereignty are exercised by the few. Proof of\r\nthis is the fact that the evils complained of are banished, or are in\r\nprocess of disappearing, wherever the people have established their\r\nsovereignty—have established the right to a direct vote on public\r\nquestions. This system is the initiative and referendum. It is exercised\r\nin combination with representatives, and the system as a whole is termed\r\nGuarded Representative Government—the people’s sovereignty is guarded.\r\n\r\nThis improved system of representative government is an evolutionary\r\nproduct, and being such it will gradually extend throughout the world. A\r\npractical question is: How best can its spread be promoted? To arrive at\r\nan answer, one must study the methods whereby the improved systems came\r\ninto being.\r\n\r\nWe find that the forerunners were third parties and non-partisan\r\norganizations. The first declaration by a political party in this country\r\nwas the Socialist Labor Party in 1889. Next came a declaration by the\r\nKnights of Labor in 1891. The same year there appeared “The Referendum in\r\nAmerica,” by Ellis Paxton Oberholtzer, Ph.D. The next year J. W. Sullivan\r\npublished his book, “Direct Legislation.” During the year the National\r\nDirect Legislation League was organized. There was also published,\r\nduring 1892, “Direct Legislation by the People,” by Nathan Cree of\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nOn July 4th of the same year, 1892, the newly organized People’s Party\r\ncommended “to the favorable consideration of the people and the reform\r\npress the legislative system known as the initiative and referendum.”\r\nAnd state conventions of the People’s Party and the allied parties also\r\npaid considerable attention to the initiative and referendum. During the\r\nAutumn the American Federation of Labor gave its emphatic endorsement\r\nto the initiative and referendum by commending “to affiliated bodies\r\nthe careful consideration of this principle and the inauguration of an\r\nagitation for its incorporation into the laws of the respective states.”\r\n\r\nThe same year the National Grange adopted a resolution recommending to\r\nthe state and subordinate granges the Swiss legislation method known as\r\nthe referendum and the initiative.\r\n\r\nThe following year the People’s Party, wherever it was in power,\r\nendeavored to submit to the people a constitutional amendment for the\r\ninitiative and referendum, but as a two-thirds vote was required there\r\nwas a temporary failure.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the People’s Party at its national convention came out strongly\r\nfor the initiative and referendum, as also did the National Party\r\nconvention, composed of 299 delegates who seceded from the Prohibition\r\nconvention. The Socialist Labor Party also reaffirmed its people’s\r\nsovereignty plank of 1892.\r\n\r\nThe first legislation in this country for the initiative and referendum\r\nwas by the People’s Party in Nebraska, 1897. The voters in municipalities\r\nwere empowered to petition for the adoption of the initiative and\r\nreferendum system for local affairs, and the system was to be adopted\r\nif approved by a majority of those who should vote upon the question.\r\nHon. John W. Yeiser was chiefly instrumental in securing the law, and he\r\nendeavored to secure its adoption in Omaha, but without success.\r\n\r\nThe same year, 1897, the People’s Party representatives in the South\r\nDakota Legislature combined with the Silver Republicans and Democrats to\r\nsubmit a constitutional amendment for the initiative and referendum. Most\r\nof the Republicans in the Legislature fell in line and voted with the\r\npromoters of the reform. At the next election, 1898, the voters adopted\r\nthe system. Afterward the Republican party, which then had a majority\r\nin each house, enacted the statute to put it in operation. Since then\r\ntwo sessions of the Legislature have been held and the effects of the\r\nreferendum (the people’s veto) have been splendid. The following words\r\nare credited to the Republican Governor, Hon. Charles Herried, by a\r\nmember of the Toronto Parliament:\r\n\r\n“Since this referendum law has been a part of our constitution we\r\nhave had no chartermongers or railway speculators, no wildcat schemes\r\nsubmitted to our Legislature. Formerly our time was occupied by\r\nspeculative schemes of one kind or another, but since the referendum has\r\nbeen a part of the constitution these people do not press their schemes\r\non the Legislature, and hence there is no necessity for having recourse\r\nto the referendum.”\r\n\r\nThe initiative in South Dakota was crippled by inserting a “joker”! The\r\nsystem provides that five per cent. of the voters may propose bills to\r\nthe Legislature, “which measures the Legislature shall _enact_ and submit\r\nto a vote of the electors of the state.”\r\n\r\nThe year (1898) that the voters of South Dakota balloted upon the\r\nquestion of adopting the improved system of representative government,\r\nthe People’s Party, Silver Republicans and Democrats in Utah submitted\r\nto the voters of the state the question of adopting a constitutional\r\namendment for the referendum and initiative. At the next election the\r\nvoters adopted the system; but the Republican party gained control of the\r\nLegislature and refused to enact a statute for putting the constitutional\r\namendment into operation. Two years later the same thing occurred.\r\n\r\nThe same year that the Fusionist Legislature in Utah submitted the\r\namendment a similar thing was done by a Republican legislature in\r\nOregon. A proposal for an amendment in Oregon has to pass two successive\r\nlegislatures; therefore the question was a live issue in the next\r\ncampaign—1900. The People’s Party, the Democratic and the Republican\r\nstate platforms each pledged that, should the party be placed in power in\r\nthe Legislature, it would permit the voters to ballot upon the question.\r\nThe Republican party secured a majority in the Legislature and submitted\r\nthe question. In the next campaign, 1902, the question was again a live\r\nissue, for it was to be balloted upon by the voters; and again all the\r\nparties declared for the improved system and advised the voters of the\r\nstate to adopt it, as also did the Granges and Organized Labor, likewise\r\nboth the United States senators and the Republican governor, and nearly\r\nall the prominent men in political life in Oregon, together with most of\r\nthe newspapers in the state. All advised the adoption of the system, and\r\nthe vote of the people was 11 to 1 for the system.\r\n\r\nGovernor Geer’s advice to the voter was: “If the referendum amendment is\r\nadopted by the people and made use of after adoption, it will be helpful\r\nall around as a restraining influence over careless legislatures. Even\r\nif not often brought into requisition, the fact that it is a part of the\r\nstate Constitution, ready to be used as a check against ill-advised\r\nlegislation at any time, will justify its adoption. It may not be needed\r\nnow any more than it was 100 years ago, but there have often been times\r\nin the past when even ‘Our Fathers’ could have been wisely checked by\r\nthis wholesome reservation of the rights of the people.”\r\n\r\nIn Nevada, at the legislative session of 1901, the Fusionist party had\r\na majority in the Legislature and voted to submit to the people the\r\nquestion of adopting the referendum. The next Legislature gave its\r\nconsent and submitted a constitutional amendment for the initiative.\r\nAt the following election the voters adopted the referendum, but the\r\nLegislature elected was Republican and it refused to consent to the\r\nsubmission of the constitutional amendment for the initiative.\r\n\r\nThe same year in Illinois, 1901, a Republican Legislature and governor\r\nestablished the advisory initiative in municipalities and in state\r\naffairs. Through this system the voters in Chicago have voted three times\r\nfor municipal ownership of street railways and the instructions are being\r\nobeyed.\r\n\r\nThe Republican senators from Illinois, Cullom and Hopkins, are both on\r\nrecord as favoring the initiative and referendum.\r\n\r\nSince 1901 the progress of the initiative and referendum has been through\r\nthe systematic questioning of candidates by non-partisan organizations.\r\nThe start in this direction came from the successful experiences of\r\nWinnetka, Illinois. These experiences began in 1896 and continued from\r\nyear to year with unvarying success.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WINNETKA SYSTEM\r\n\r\nWinnetka is a suburb of Chicago, peopled largely by bright and active\r\nbusiness men. Certain would-be monopolists proposed to the village\r\ncouncil that it grant them a forty-year franchise for a gas plant. This\r\nwas opposed by the citizens, for they wanted public ownership of city\r\nmonopolies. They possessed a publicly-owned waterworks system and aimed\r\nto keep themselves from the clutches of private monopoly. Fortunately,\r\nat the time the gas franchise was asked for, there was being held each\r\nmonth a public meeting to consider public questions. It was called the\r\n“town meeting.” At the next town meeting, after the gas question came\r\nup, a resolution was adopted asking the village council to submit the\r\nquestion to the people. A deputation of leading citizens called upon the\r\ncity council at its next meeting and Mr. Lloyd was accorded the privilege\r\nof speaking. After a warm time the council reluctantly agreed to submit\r\nthe question to the voters and abide by their decision. The polls were\r\nopened and the proposed franchise received only 4 votes, with 180 against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis settled the gas franchise and it did much more, for at the next\r\ncaucus for nominating village trustees it was proposed and decided that\r\nonly those men should be nominated who would stand up before their\r\nfellow-voters and promise, if nominated and elected, to submit all\r\nimportant questions to a vote of the people and abide by their decision.\r\nThis was agreed to by the voters present, and each nominee for village\r\ntrustee stood before his fellow-citizens and promised.\r\n\r\nThus was the system installed, for there were no competing nominations.\r\nThe casting of ballots on election day was a mere form.\r\n\r\nFrom that day until the present time the people of Winnetka have been the\r\nsovereign power as to ordinances. They are a Self-emancipated People.\r\n\r\nReviewing the foregoing, it is seen that the pledges for installing the\r\nreferendum system were secured by questioning candidates, while the\r\nsystem itself is through rules of procedure, which may be incorporated\r\nin the rules themselves or in an ordinance or statute. The system is\r\nthe advisory referendum, the candidates being pledged to carry out the\r\npeople’s advice. This they have done in Winnetka and elsewhere, as we\r\nshall show. But the system is intended for use only until the usual form\r\ncan be installed. In fact, it is through an advisory initiative that a\r\nchange in the Federal Constitution is to be secured, and in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the election in 1900 the writer, who was a delegate\r\nto the People’s Party National Convention of that year, withdrew from\r\nthe Bureau of Economic Research and began devoting his entire time and\r\nenergies to spreading the news concerning the Winnetka System, the\r\nprimary aim being to help establish the people’s sovereignty in national\r\naffairs and to do so without waiting to change the written words of the\r\nFederal Constitution—a practically unalterable instrument until such\r\ntime as the advisory initiative is installed. The following July the\r\nsecond social and political conference at Detroit approved the Winnetka\r\nSystem—the advisory initiative and advisory referendum—as also did the\r\nNational Direct Legislation League.\r\n\r\nAnd Prof. Frank Parsons, president of the National Referendum League,\r\nsaid: “The Winnetka System is clearly great in its possibilities—a bridge\r\nready for immediate use to the promised land.”\r\n\r\nMr. Eltweed Pomeroy, president of the National Direct Legislation League,\r\nwrote: “I am also glad that you demonstrate that direct legislation\r\nis not only a great scheme which will be of inestimable value in its\r\nentirety, but that it is more than that, and can be applied on a small\r\nscale here and now, and that almost anyone can exercise influence enough\r\nto secure a first step.”\r\n\r\nMr. Louis P. Post, editor of _The Public_, visited Winnetka during\r\nAugust, 1901, and in his paper of September 7 described the system,\r\nsaying in conclusion:\r\n\r\n    This Winnetka Plan of securing the advantages of direct\r\n    legislation without waiting for party action, has special\r\n    merit. It can, for one thing, be easily made the subject of\r\n    effective non-partisan organization. For another, if the\r\n    organization were to become influential, it would completely\r\n    effect its purpose. Meanwhile, here and there locally the\r\n    purposes would be effected even though balked and delayed\r\n    in the larger government divisions. Moreover, the plan has\r\n    been for years in actual and effective operation at Winnetka.\r\n    Finally, it contemplates a spontaneous command from the people\r\n    as to public servants, not a petition from them as to public\r\n    masters.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor, at a meeting\r\nin Washington, D. C., September 20, 1901, considered briefly the Winnetka\r\nSystem, and the following is the published report:\r\n\r\n    It was decided to issue an address to all affiliated\r\n    organizations, requesting them to endeavor to secure the\r\n    passage of local ordinances and laws for the initiative and\r\n    referendum _on measures relating to local interests_, and thus\r\n    to secure the beginning of this system of direct legislation,\r\n    _with the view of subsequently enlarging the scope of that\r\n    method of enacting laws in the interests of the people_.\r\n\r\nThus the new system—the systematic questioning of candidates for the\r\nestablishment of the people’s sovereignty—began and was endorsed\r\nthroughout the land. During the four and a half years that have since\r\nelapsed the system has made steady and rapid progress.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1901, President Gompers, of the American Federation of\r\nLabor, in his annual message recommended the system, and the convention\r\nordered that it be explained in the _American Federationist_, “in\r\norder that Trade Unionists may be able to study it as carefully as it\r\ndeserves.” Accordingly it was published in an eighty page extra number\r\nand 20,000 copies were circulated in addition to the regular mailing list.\r\n\r\nGov. Altgeld wrote concerning this extra number: “It presents the subject\r\nof the initiative and referendum and representative government in the\r\nmost lucid, striking, and comprehensive manner that I have ever seen.”\r\nHe added: “Through the agency of the labor organizations it ought to get\r\ninto every neighborhood, and in time it will create a sentiment that will\r\nbe irresistible.”\r\n\r\nGov. Altgeld’s prediction is correct. The very first year after the\r\nissuance of the extra number of the _Federationist_ the Winnetka System\r\nwas established in Detroit, Mich., Toronto, Canada, and Geneva, Ill.;\r\nwith the pledging of the Missouri Legislature for the submission of a\r\nconstitutional amendment for the initiative and referendum; also the\r\nsystematic questioning of candidates by organized labor in several other\r\nstates, and the questioning of candidates as to the initiative and\r\nreferendum by the granges in the state of Washington. The net result\r\nof questioning candidates was a majority vote for the initiative and\r\nreferendum in six legislatures; also the pledging of nine of the sixteen\r\ncongressmen of Missouri for a national system of advisory initiative\r\nand advisory referendum, and the pledging of the United States senators\r\nelected from Missouri and Illinois. During the course of the campaign\r\nthe actions of four state conventions of the two great parties were\r\nreversed—the Republican state conventions in Missouri, California and\r\nMontana; and the Democratic state convention in Montana. The states where\r\nthe majority vote in the legislature was secured were Missouri, Colorado,\r\nCalifornia, Montana, North Dakota and Massachusetts. In Illinois there\r\nwas a two-thirds vote in the House, but the Senate refused to act. This\r\nIllinois vote was caused by an instruction from the voters through an\r\nadvisory referendum taken under the 1901 act of the Legislature. The vote\r\nof the people was 5 to 1 for the establishment of the improved system.\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting of the legislatures, after the autumn elections, the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor at its annual convention established a\r\nnational system for the questioning of candidates, the interrogatories to\r\napply to such measures as the organization should deem most important.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1903, legislatures were elected in but ten states and, as\r\norganized labor in these states had not yet been educated to the use of\r\nthe questioning system, except in Massachusetts, little was accomplished\r\nfor the initiative and referendum. In Massachusetts the labor people\r\nfound themselves almost alone in demanding the people’s sovereignty, and\r\nduring 1903 were quiescent. But in Kentucky Hon. J. A. Parker did valiant\r\nwork. Through his paper, _The Home Tribune_, he called for workers for\r\nthe referendum in Kentucky. At a joint state convention of the Allied\r\nPeople’s Party and the United Labor Party, a platform was enunciated in\r\nwhich existing political and legislative evils were outlined; and it\r\nwas pointed out that the remedy is an improved system of government—the\r\nestablishment of the people’s sovereignty through the initiative\r\nand referendum, to be exercised in combination with representative\r\ngovernment. _The proposed change, it was declared, was the open door\r\nthrough which all the desired legislative reforms would come._ It was\r\nfurther declared that candidates of the Democratic and Republican parties\r\nshould be questioned, and wherever a reliable candidate would pledge in\r\nwriting for the improved system of government, no opposing candidate of\r\nthe Allied Party should be nominated, and that every possible effort\r\nwould be made to help elect the pledged candidate. The result in Mr.\r\nParker’s own words at the close of the campaign was as follows:\r\n\r\n    In all my work I found but little antagonism. The one obstacle\r\n    was the bitter, unreasonable campaign carried on in this state,\r\n    in which all principle was lost sight of, and the issue made on\r\n    the hanging of Caleb Powers. The election was a riot of fraud\r\n    and dishonor, and showed too clearly what little hope there can\r\n    be in partisan action. The last election, not only in Kentucky,\r\n    but all over the nation _has shown that to gain any substantial\r\n    reform we must concentrate all effort on pledging candidates,\r\n    AND IF THIS EFFORT IS SUPPORTED BY INTELLIGENT LOCAL EFFORT\r\n    WE CAN WIN IN ANY STATE._ An instance of this is found in a\r\n    senatorial district in this state, where Dr. J. S. Dossey\r\n    had enrolled perhaps 300 volunteers for Majority Rule. The\r\n    Republican signed our pledge, and, the Democrat ignoring the\r\n    matter until after the time fixed as a limit, I wrote letters\r\n    to our workers stating the situation. Within forty-eight hours\r\n    came the Democrat’s pledge with a strong letter to support it,\r\n    declaring that if elected he would give our bill his hearty\r\n    support.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1904, the Presidential contest absorbed a large\r\ndegree of attention, yet the people’s sovereignty cause was triumphant\r\nin four states—Montana, Nevada, Texas and Delaware—with considerable\r\nprogress in many others; and a 33⅓ per cent. increase in pledged\r\ncongressmen in Missouri, i.e., twelve of the sixteen are pledged to the\r\npeople’s sovereignty in national affairs through the advisory initiative\r\nand advisory referendum, as also are five of the Chicago congressmen,\r\nand scattering ones throughout the country. The Pennsylvania granges,\r\nwhich are very strong, established a magazine of their own and questioned\r\ncandidates for the initiative and referendum and other measures.\r\n\r\nThe next year, 1905, like 1903, was a year in which few legislatures\r\nwere elected, yet one state and probably two were rescued from machine\r\nrule—Ohio and possibly Massachusetts. In Ohio the required three-fifths\r\nof the Legislature are pledged to the submission of a constitutional\r\namendment for the initiative and referendum; and in Massachusetts it\r\nis hoped that an advisory referendum system will be established. The\r\nOhio campaign is especially noteworthy in that most of the Republican\r\ncandidates refused to pledge, while the Democratic candidates pledged\r\nuniversally, the initiative and referendum being part of the state\r\nplatform. Election day was a surprise to every one, for many of the\r\npeople’s sovereignty candidates were elected where it was supposed they\r\nwere hopelessly beaten. The Democratic gain in the Senate was 47.5 per\r\ncent.—an unprecedented landslide. The change was not caused by the\r\nAnti-Saloon League’s work, for the Republican candidates were pledged\r\nto its cause. The change was due to the independent voters, who had\r\nbeen apprised of the attitude of candidates through the publication of\r\nthe answers to the initiative and referendum question. Early in October\r\nthe State Federation of Labor at its annual convention instructed that\r\nall candidates for the Legislature should be questioned as to the\r\ninitiative and referendum, and the replies published. The Woman’s\r\nSuffrage Association also questioned candidates as to the initiative\r\nand referendum. Referendum Leagues were active, and years ago the Union\r\nReform Party had specialized on the initiative and referendum, thereby\r\ninstructing the voters—a lesson which they evidently did not forget.\r\n\r\nThis same year the State Federation of Labor increased most materially\r\ntheir activity for the people’s sovereignty. The Pennsylvania Federation\r\nof Labor set the pace. At its annual convention it provided not only for\r\nthe questioning of political candidates, but took steps to provide for a\r\npeople’s sovereignty committee within each union, and arranged in other\r\nways for an educational and non-partisan campaign for the initiative and\r\nreferendum. A fraternal delegate was received from the state grange,\r\nwhich also is working for the people’s sovereignty. Later in the year the\r\nNew Jersey State Federation of Labor adopted the Pennsylvania program,\r\nand a few weeks afterward the New York State Federation did likewise. At\r\nthe annual convention of the American Federation of Labor, representing\r\none-eighth of the people of the United States, the executive council\r\nreport recited the rapid spread of the people’s sovereignty cause through\r\nthe questioning of candidates, and said:\r\n\r\n    The systematic questioning of candidates, to which reference\r\n    has been made, is gaining in importance each year. More and\r\n    more our state branches, central bodies and local unions are\r\n    realizing the system’s usefulness. It enables our people to\r\n    prevent the evasion of issues by party machines, and the\r\n    self-interests of candidates cause them to answer favorably in\r\n    most cases. And the success of organized labor’s political work\r\n    without engaging in party politics strengthens the union in the\r\n    sentiment of its members and increases their number.\r\n\r\n    Co-operation is also advanced with other interests, such\r\n    as organized farmers. In Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Indian\r\n    Territory and Texas the organized farmers, with organized wage\r\n    earners, are questioning candidates as to the establishment\r\n    of the people’s sovereignty in place of machine rule. This is\r\n    accomplished without a formal alliance.\r\n\r\n    We recommend the general use of the questioning-of-candidates\r\n    system.\r\n\r\nThe state Granges in sixteen commonwealths have declared for the\r\ninitiative and referendum. These states are: Oregon, Washington,\r\nColorado, Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois,\r\nMissouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode\r\nIsland and Maine.\r\n\r\nThe Farmers’ Union, a rapidly growing organization (described in WATSON’S\r\nMAGAZINE for February) has adopted the initiative for use within the\r\nassociation. The National American Woman’s Suffrage Association declared\r\nlast year for the initiative and referendum, and this year’s convention\r\nhas urgently requested action by the state associations. Last year in\r\nOhio the Woman’s Suffrage Association questioned candidates as to the\r\ninitiative and referendum, and this year it is likely that the suffrage\r\nassociation in every state will apply the system. The Referendum Leagues\r\nare also questioning candidates.\r\n\r\nAll these organizations have learned or are learning that the questioning\r\nof candidates immediately terminates the machine’s power to sidetrack\r\nthe live issues, provided there is an organization to take the case to\r\nthe voters. One individual in a state can easily co-ordinate the forces\r\nfor the questioning of candidates, and thereby secure the immediate\r\ntermination of the machine’s power to evade the live issues. One person\r\nin a state has repeatedly secured this result; in fact, every reform\r\nwithin a state is largely due to the engineering tact and skill of some\r\none individual. Today, as never before, it is easy and practically\r\ncostless to terminate machine rule by establishing the initiative and\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW THIRD PARTY\r\n\r\nHeretofore the essential element in questioning candidates as to people’s\r\nsovereignty has been a State Referendum League, in order that the\r\nbusiness and professional interests shall be represented. But in January\r\na new departure occurred in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Referendum\r\nLeague changed its form of organization to the REFERENDUM PARTY OF\r\nPENNSYLVANIA. The platform is as follows:\r\n\r\n    The Referendum Party urges the following legislative action as\r\n    the only certain peaceable means of forever eradicating the\r\n    gigantic evils that have gradually crept into our system of\r\n    government:\r\n\r\n    1. The calling of a constitutional convention to revise the\r\n    state constitution.\r\n\r\n    2. Granting to the people the right to veto unjust laws or\r\n    ordinances by direct vote; this right to be exercised only if a\r\n    vote is demanded on any law or ordinance, by petition signed by\r\n    two percentum of the voters of the state or locality affected.\r\n\r\n    3. Granting to the people the right to enact, by direct\r\n    majority vote, needed laws which their Legislature fails or\r\n    refuses to enact.\r\n\r\n    This is known as the Referendum System. Wherever it has been\r\n    in operation it has effectually stamped out bribery, graft,\r\n    bossism and ring rule, and has made “government by the people\r\n    and for the people” a practical reality instead of a mere\r\n    theory.\r\n\r\n    The Referendum Party invites the co-operation of all who favor\r\n    this action.\r\n\r\nThe members of the preliminary committee on organization are:\r\n\r\n    Clarence V. Tiers, Chairman, Pittsburg, Pa.,\r\n    Clement V. Horn, Wilkinsburg, Pa.,\r\n    H. F. Lea, Bellevue, Pa.,\r\n    H. W. Noren, Allegheny, Pa.,\r\n    Walter Becker, Allegheny, Pa.,\r\n    John C. Innes, Pittsburg, Pa.,\r\n    George D. Porter, Philadelphia, Pa.,\r\n    John E. Joos, Allegheny, Pa.,\r\n    Nathaniel Green, Swissvale, Pa.,\r\n    J. Ludwig Koethen, Jr., Pittsburg, Pa.,\r\n    Hon. W. F. Hill, (Master State Grange) Chambersburg, Pa.,\r\n    James Wm. Newlin, (Member of Constitutional Convention 1873)\r\n      Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\nReformers will watch with great interest this new experiment in third\r\nparty politics. By limiting the demand to a constitutional convention\r\nand the initiative and referendum, and proposing to endorse such of the\r\nreliable candidates as pledge for the people’s sovereignty, the program\r\nis largely that of a Referendum League, plus the possibility of making\r\nan independent nomination. But a league can circulate nomination papers;\r\nin fact, every league impliedly stands ready to do so, if necessary. One\r\nthing is clear; that the _Pennsylvania situation was such that the change\r\nto a Referendum Party put life and vigor into the referendum movement_.\r\nNot only were hundreds of enthusiastic offers of support sent in, it is\r\nsaid, and from every quarter of the state, but leaders in the minority\r\nparty and in the Lincoln party were brought to a point where they found\r\nit desirable to take immediate notice of the organization.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this is that the granges in the state, large in number and\r\nstrong in membership, and organized labor, have not only declared for the\r\ninitiative and referendum, but are systematically questioning candidates\r\nand publishing their replies. All that is needed to give great political\r\npower to these voters is an organization that stands ready to nominate\r\nreferendum candidates. The mere existence of such an organization will\r\naccomplish most of its purposes. In this connection the experience of Jo\r\nA. Parker, in Kentucky, described above, should be borne in mind; also\r\nthe fact that the People’s Party Conference of 1902 at Louisville almost\r\nadopted the program which Mr. Parker applied in Kentucky the following\r\nyear. But in states where the minority party is under progressive\r\nleadership it is probable that a State Referendum League is the best\r\npossible instrument.\r\n\r\nIsn’t it clear that the thing for the People’s Party to do is to complete\r\nat once the establishment of the initiative and referendum in America by\r\ngoing at it through the Kentucky or Pennsylvania program? Or that the\r\nworkers in a state should organize an Initiative and Referendum League?\r\n\r\nIf we review the foregoing pages several things become clear:\r\n\r\n1. That machine rule can be terminated and the people’s sovereignty\r\nre-established without waiting to change the written constitution. All\r\nthat is required is a majority vote in the city council, legislature\r\nor congress. By this means an advisory-vote system can be established\r\nand then the candidates for public office can be pledged to obey the\r\nwill of their constituents when expressed by referendum vote. This is\r\nmerely the re-establishment of a direct vote system for instructing\r\nrepresentatives—a system as old as representative government itself. The\r\nPresident of the United States is selected through an advisory vote by\r\nthe people and public questions are also being determined by advisory\r\nvote; for example, municipal ownership of street railways in Chicago.\r\n\r\n2. The basis of machine rule is an evasion of vital issues by both the\r\nleading parties. This power can be terminated at once by the systematic\r\nquestioning of candidates as to vital issues, provided an organization\r\nor candidate stands ready to take the case to the people. Another way\r\nof stating the reason for questioning candidates is that the people are\r\nentitled to know how the candidates will vote if elected.\r\n\r\n3. A third party organization can question candidates and declare that\r\nunless there is within each district a clear-cut written pledge by a\r\nreputable candidate, it will place one in nomination.\r\n\r\nOr the program can be to place on the third-party ticket some of the old\r\nline party candidates, except in those states where fusion is prohibited\r\nby law.\r\n\r\n4. The People’s Party during its palmy days was a leading factor in\r\npopularizing the initiative and referendum, and in securing its adoption,\r\nand today, by centering its effort on the termination of machine rule\r\nthrough the establishment of the initiative and referendum, it can at\r\nonce complete the rehabilitation of the American system of government.\r\nNot only can the remaining states be redeemed within the next two years,\r\nbut it is thoroughly practicable to exert in national affairs this year\r\nan influence that shall result in a pledged majority in the national\r\nHouse and Senate—the pledges to be for the advisory initiative and\r\nadvisory referendum. The entire body of organized labor is centering its\r\nefforts in this direction, the referendum leagues are demanding it, and\r\nall that is needed to secure immediate victory is a political party that\r\nstands ready to put up candidates. The mere existence of such a party\r\nwill win the day. How best can the desired end be attained?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Basket And A Fortune\r\n\r\nBy Louise Forsslund]\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF “THE STORY OF SARAH”, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The Old Men’s Home, Indian Village, Long Island.\r\n                                                       June 10, 19—\r\n\r\n    To the Matron of the Old Ladies’ Home, Shoreville, Long Island.\r\n\r\n    Dear Miss: The writer of this letter has had a windfall and\r\n    he wants one of your woman-folks to have a share in it. He\r\n    has lived in an old folks’ home himself for ten years, hand\r\n    running, and he has a feeling for them others. My cousin\r\n    Obadiah Hawkins died up to Lakeland last week. He never would\r\n    so much as lend me a penny whilst he was living, but now he’s\r\n    dead, he’s left me ten thousand dollars in ready money and a\r\n    house and a home. There’s a pump in the kitchen. He never was\r\n    no hand for investments and the money was all in an old silver\r\n    water pitcher. It’s all good and the matron here has counted\r\n    it over. I always wanted a home of my own and never was able\r\n    to afford one. I always wanted a wife of my own and never\r\n    could get up gumption enough to ask any woman to share my bad\r\n    luck. Now the luck has turned. I got the home. All I need is\r\n    the wife. I be going to drive over this afternoon and see if\r\n    you got anybody that’s willing. I put it that way ’cause I\r\n    ain’t much account if I have come into a tidy little fortune.\r\n    I wear a wig and have spells of lumbago. It’s the lumbago what\r\n    brought me here. There ain’t a lazy bone in my body. As for the\r\n    requirements of the lady. She must be under seventy years old;\r\n    she mustn’t wear a wig or dye her hair. I want one respectable\r\n    suit of hair between us. She mustn’t squint or take snuff,\r\n    and if she is sot on keeping chickens—some women be—she must\r\n    keep them in the coop. I’ll build the coop. And she must love\r\n    flowers and garden sass.\r\n\r\n    Expecting them to be on deck this afternoon at three o’clock, I\r\n    am,\r\n\r\n                     Yours most respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                     Samuel Jessup.\r\n\r\nA moment’s intense silence followed the matron’s public reading of this\r\nletter in the large hall which served as the community room of the Old\r\nLadies’ Home. The matron, her young gray eyes twinkling and shining,\r\nlooked from one old face to the other. Some were broadly grinning under\r\ntheir crowns of gray hair, some were hurt and scornful, some were only\r\npuzzled and amazed—these belonging to the old ladies who had held their\r\nshriveled, shaking hands as trumpets before their ears during the reading\r\nof the letter. And some faces were marred by a shrewd, keen, calculating\r\nlook as if to exclaim: “I wonder if—!” The matron looked at them all, her\r\nsmile slowly growing broader, then quickly she looked down at her desk\r\nand said with business-like briskness:\r\n\r\n“That is a very honest letter. I wish you could all give it your serious\r\nattention. There is no fraud in it, for I have telephoned to the Old\r\nMen’s Home, and Mr. Jessup is a noble, straightforward character. Now,\r\nare any of you willing to see him this afternoon? I suggest that all\r\nthose who can not or who will not give Mr. Jessup a chance for their\r\nhands this afternoon, leave the hall.”\r\n\r\nThere was a curious reluctance on the part of the old ladies to move.\r\nThere was much wagging of heads, much nudging of elbows, whispers and\r\nwinks and murmurs from every quarter, but no one stirred. Those who\r\nreally had no personal interest or legitimate right to an interest in Mr.\r\nJessup’s quest for a wife stayed to see what the others might do. The\r\nmatron repeated her request. Then old Mrs. Smith, bent and humpbacked,\r\ntook up her cane and hobbled slowly toward the stairway.\r\n\r\n“Ef he wanted me,” she declared with mock asperity, “he should oughter\r\ncome twenty year ago. Ye notice,” she added, looking over her shoulder\r\nwith her sharp, shrewd peaked face, “he didn’t tell how old _he_ was.”\r\n\r\n“He’s sixty-nine,” laughed the matron. “Most men of his age would have\r\ninsisted on a wife of eighteen.”\r\n\r\nThere was a scurrying sound among the group of old ladies and suddenly\r\nthere darted across the hall a younger, slimmer, straighter figure than\r\nMrs. Smith’s.\r\n\r\n“Miss Ellie!” protestingly called the matron, “where are you going?”\r\n\r\nMiss Ellie paused, her face flushed with shame to think she had not fled\r\nfrom the hall before. She paused and looked at the matron. However old\r\nshe was, Miss Ellie did not look more than fifty years. Her hair was\r\nluxuriant, half silver, half gold, faded, yet giving a curious effect of\r\na halo of moonlight. The flush mounted higher up the spinster’s cheeks\r\nuntil it crept over her forehead to the edge of her hair. For a moment\r\nshe stood thus, looking at the youthful matron. Then, with a world of\r\nreproach in her tones, she said simply: “Miss Jessica!” Then she went up\r\nthe stairs with quick and trembling limbs, but with an air of dignity\r\nthat acted as a rebuke upon those lingering the hall.\r\n\r\n“Proud Miss Ellie!” murmured Jessica, herself feeling ashamed.\r\n\r\n“I do think,” began Mrs. Honan in a loud, strident key, “I do think\r\nmyself that the man didn’t show very fine feeling. The idea of him\r\na-spectin’ a woman ter jump at his head. Ef he wanted a wife, why didn’t\r\nhe come a-lookin’ around modest an’ quiet-like in the good, old fashioned\r\nway?”\r\n\r\nWith that she swept out of the hall. She was down on the register as\r\nhaving passed her seventy-third birthday, and anyway, she mused, she\r\nhad always preferred a yard full of chickens to a yard full of flowers,\r\nbecause chickens are more lively. They keep you better company, she\r\nsaid. Then, with or without verbal excuse, one woman after another left\r\nthe hall. There were two with the deplorable squint, several far on the\r\nshaded side of seventy, some who wore honest wigs, and some too honest\r\nto proclaim either that they did not dye their hair or that they had\r\nnever sniffed at the contents of a snuffbox. Then there were the dear\r\nold ladies loyal to their dead husbands, the old ladies who did not care\r\nto give up the serene, uneventful security of the Old Ladies’ Home for\r\na house shared only with a man afflicted with lumbago and very decided\r\nnotions. However, ten remained, openly ashamed, yet not sufficiently\r\nashamed to reject Samuel Jessup’s hand before they had seen him.\r\n\r\n“It don’t mean that none of us promise to take him, oh no!” said Mrs.\r\nYoung, a woman living in the memories of her long reign as a belle. “It\r\nonly means that we’d like to get a good look at him. We’ve had plenty of\r\nchances all our lives. We ain’t none of us here because no man wanted\r\nus—neither us widders nor us maidens. We’re here from ch’ice, Miss\r\nJessica, from _ch’ice_! But still if there’s another ch’ice open to\r\nus with a real, kind honest man—his letter shows he’s that, bless his\r\nheart!—we’d each of us ten like to have one tenth of a show at him.”\r\n\r\nThen, greatly flustered at having spoken with such unmaidenly freedom\r\non such a subject, Mrs. Young moved away from the desk across the hall\r\nand out of doors, where she could take a good long breath. After she had\r\ngone, one of the nine remaining candidates wondered aloud how Mrs. Young\r\nwould look without her false front, for of course no one would deceive\r\nSamuel Jessup as to her quantity of hair.\r\n\r\n“But the rest of it?” whispered another. “You can’t wash all that dye off\r\nin one day, can you?”\r\n\r\n“Waal!” retorted a third, coming hotly to Mrs. Young’s rescue, “a man who\r\nwears a wig hasn’t no right ter be so particular.”\r\n\r\nSaid the first one firmly: “She shouldn’t deceive him.”\r\n\r\nAnswered a third: “Deceive him all she wants ter as long as it’s in\r\nsomethin’ no man would have wit enough ter find out.”\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock to the minute, Samuel Jessup appeared, emerging from a\r\nclosed coach together with a plump middle-aged woman who carried with\r\nextraordinary care a large market basket covered with a red tablecloth.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!” exclaimed Mrs. Young, peeking with half the household\r\nfrom the upper hall windows. “He’s been an’ picked up a wife on the road\r\nan’ come to offer his apologies.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed merrily at the possible joke against them all. And yet what a\r\npity that would be, too, for Samuel was a pleasant, self-reliant looking\r\nlittle man with his head hanging sideways as if he had never lifted it\r\nfrom a one-sided attack of the mumps. Somehow this attitude made him\r\nappear younger. But the wig! That was too much in evidence and they all\r\ndecided that it must be clipped at once. Samuel did not scan the house\r\nwith lover-like eagerness as he came up the steps. Instead, he watched\r\nthe basket with intense interest—so intense that he stumbled on the way.\r\n\r\n“I bet he’s got a dog in it!” cried one of the candidates. “I will not\r\nstand no leetle measly pet dog around the house, a-sheddin’ hair all over\r\nthe parlor sofy. I ain’t agoin’ downstairs!”\r\n\r\nBut she went with the others and met Mr. Jessup. The woman with the\r\nbasket was nowhere in sight, having been relegated to the dining-room. No\r\nattempt whatever was made to explain her to the old ladies. Samuel Jessup\r\nwas immediately enthroned by the matron in her private office; and one\r\nby one in alphabetical order of their names, Jessica sent the candidates\r\nto him, thinking that this would be more delicate than to have them all\r\nface him at once. Delicacy in this affair did not seem so difficult after\r\ncoming face to face with little Mr. Jessup. Very modestly, and with his\r\nhead more on one side than ever, he told the matron that she must convey\r\nto the ladies his doubts as to any one of them accepting him. He thought\r\nit was very kind of them to receive him anyway, and—this with a quick\r\nkeen look into Jessica’s wise and bonny face—he hoped that they would not\r\nlaugh at him.\r\n\r\nThe first five filed out of the room after only a few moments’\r\nconversation, each briefly explaining in her turn why Mr. Jessup “hadn’t\r\ntook” with her. One did not like the way he held his head. One never\r\ncould stand that wig. She knew that it got askew every time he took a\r\nnap. One thought him too much like her dead husband. One thought him too\r\nunlike her departed John to make a happy union possible. One said she\r\nnever could bear a pump dribbling water in the kitchen; and he was too\r\nstubborn and “sot” in his ways to take it out. Then went in the sixth—she\r\nwho had not rebuked the deceit of Mrs. Young’s dyed hair and she who\r\nhated pet dogs. After a longer period, she came out and with customary\r\ncandor bluntly declared that she would have had Samuel Jessup in a\r\nminute, but she saw that she did not take with him.\r\n\r\n“The woman that gits him will be lucky,” she declared, “basket and all.”\r\nNothing more would she tell. Then into the private room went the seventh\r\nold lady. She immediately demanded of Samuel an explanation of the woman\r\nand the basket; whereupon Samuel said that he refused to be questioned by\r\nany woman and he knew that they could not get along well together. She\r\ncame out sniffing contemptuously, and vowed that in her opinion there\r\nwas something very mysterious about this man. Number Eight went in even\r\nmore eagerly, on tip-toe. She had read romances all her life. She loved\r\nmysteries and she was so sensitive about living in an Old Ladies’ Home\r\npartly on charity that she would have married any man that asked her.\r\nAlmost any man—but not quite. She and Samuel Jessup talked together for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n“I am sure we would git along,” said Samuel at last, his heart stirred\r\nto sympathy for one who hated a Home of this sort with the same proud\r\nhatred that he had borne. “But,” he went on, “before I let you decide, I\r\nbe agoin’ to take you into the dining-room and show you the basket. What\r\nbelongs in the basket belongs with me an’s agoin’ with me. I ain’t much\r\nter git, but come an’ see the basket!”\r\n\r\nHer romantic old heart beating high with excitement, Miss Ruby tip-toed\r\nahead of him, across a tiny, dark back hall into the dining-room. On the\r\nvery threshold she paused, her eyes popping out of her head as she looked\r\nwithin; then she uttered a faint scream and went scuttling into a corner\r\namong the shadows of the dim passage.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Mr. Jessup!” she called tragically. “Good-bye!” and there\r\nended Samuel Jessup’s affair with Miss Ruby.\r\n\r\nA humorous light twinkled in the old man’s eye as he went back into\r\nJessica’s office and waited for the ninth candidate. She was a woman\r\nfamous in the Home for always managing to find some one to wait upon her,\r\nand she wanted a house of her own with several servants, an unobtrusive\r\nhusband, and stained glass windows in the parlor.\r\n\r\n“I kinder fancied stained glass winders myself,” said Samuel. “But you\r\ncan’t be keepin’ a hull passel o’ servants. One servant gal—that’s all I\r\nagree to, ma’am.”\r\n\r\nShe thought that one servant might do if they put out the washing. Samuel\r\nlooked dubious for a moment, seeing himself a henpecked husband, and then\r\nthat twinkle came again into his wholesome eye.\r\n\r\n“Before we decide, m’am, I want ter show you what I got in that there\r\nbasket. Me an’ the basket be inseparable.”\r\n\r\nShe preceded him into the dining-room, her shoulders high and her nose\r\nuplifted. She stood for some moments staring at the contents of the\r\nbasket, the basket’s owner, and the basket’s guardian staring at her.\r\nSlowly her face grew rigid. She shook her head once. She strove to speak,\r\nswallowed hard and then gasped;\r\n\r\n“How dast you presume, Samuel Jessup!”\r\n\r\nSamuel winked at the guardian of the basket and chuckled soft and low.\r\nBut then he realized that he really wanted a wife, a companion in his\r\nold age, a mistress for the snug little home, and now there was but one\r\ncandidate left. To be sure he might find some one outside the Home,\r\nbut he had wanted in truth to share all that he had—the basket not\r\nexcepted—with one who had tasted as he had the well buttered bread of\r\ncharity in an old folks’ home. Soberly he went back to the private room,\r\nand Mrs. Young came drifting leisurely in to him. She congratulated\r\nherself on being the last. She wanted never to be twitted with having\r\nfailed to give the others every possible chance, and she knew that had\r\nshe entered the private room first the result would have been the same.\r\nShe would be the wife selected by Mr. Jessup if she wanted him. A woman\r\nwith real charm for old men, a woman who could have graced many a home in\r\nher lazy, yet pleasingly frivolous ways, she felt that Samuel could not\r\nresist her if she chose to throw her charm around him.\r\n\r\n“This is a very ridiculous position,” she began, with a quavering little\r\ntrill of laughter. “I never went a-seekin’ a man before. They always\r\nsought me.”\r\n\r\nThis was more than Samuel’s natural gallantry could withstand. He took\r\nher small lean fingers in his and drew her down beside him on the couch.\r\nHer fingers twined around his hand. She wore jewels—relics of bygone\r\nsplendors—which seemed pitifully out of keeping with her present state.\r\nTo Samuel they told a long, familiar story, and sent a feeling of pity\r\nout from him to her.\r\n\r\n“Mis’ Young,” he said gently. “I am jest as much obliged to all of you\r\nfolks fer seein’ me as I kin be.”\r\n\r\n“To us _all_?” she asked and lifted her eyes.\r\n\r\nThey had been very fine blue eyes once and now they were bright in spite\r\nof their puffy lids. And her thin hair, parted simply in the middle, was\r\nmore becoming than the false front had been. He wondered that she had no\r\ngray hairs, but was too straightforward himself to suspect the deception.\r\nWhat a very pretty woman she still was, and, with that not displeasing\r\ngirlish attempt at flirtation, how exceedingly feminine!\r\n\r\n“Obliged to us _all_?” she repeated, her eyes still uplifted, her hand\r\nstill clinging to his. She remembered how eloquently hands can speak and\r\nso did Samuel, but of a sudden he felt that his horny old hand had become\r\ntongue-tied. He knew that she wanted him to say: “I be obliged to _you_\r\nin perticular, Mis’ Young.”\r\n\r\nAnd he did stumble through some such gallant speech, but all the while he\r\nwas thinking: “So I have got to take this! This frivolous old lady with\r\na spot of red paint on either cheek and a pair of penciled eye-brows.”\r\nWhy had he not mentioned rouge in his letter? Mrs. Young still looked at\r\nhim, still held his hand, remembering of old the value of long looks and\r\nof silence. Of a truth many and many a man had she captivated in this\r\nway in the days of long ago and once again in her mind’s eye she could\r\nsee suitor after suitor at her feet. She had refused them all, after the\r\nfirst one had given her his name and then gone into the unknown world.\r\nEven after coming into the Old Ladies’ Home, she had refused offers of\r\nmarriage, and yet, now of a sudden, she wished to share the good fortune\r\nand the ill fortune of Samuel Jessup. She laid her free hand on his\r\nshoulder and murmured a line from her favorite Browning—Browning who was\r\na mere name and scarcely that to Samuel:\r\n\r\n    “Grow old along with me,\r\n    The best is yet to be.”\r\n\r\nSamuel was embarrassed. He pushed his wig back from his brow and, going\r\nopposite to the natural, sidewise slant of his head, it gave him a rakish\r\nexpression, delightful to Mrs. Young’s eye. Then all of a kindle with the\r\nlight of an eager hope went Samuel’s own brown orbs.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” he said glibly, “but the best ain’t _ter be_. It’s here,\r\nright now, in the dinin’-room. Come along with me.”\r\n\r\nHe was so mixed as to his own desires and emotions that he half hoped,\r\nhalf feared that she would stand the test, but when she saw the basket\r\nand its contents, first horror crossed her face, then the shadow of\r\na deep disappointment fell among the wrinkles and the rouge and the\r\npenciled eye-brows. Sadly she faced Samuel Jessup as if certain of his\r\nanswer before her questioning:\r\n\r\n“And you insist on a-keeping it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s mine. It belongs ter me. I had it jest half a day, but now all the\r\nwomen in the country couldn’t make me give it up. I don’t want ter be\r\nimperlite,” added Samuel in a milder tone, “but them’s the facts. Me an’\r\nthe basket, or ‘Good-bye, Samuel.’”\r\n\r\nShe interpreted him literally. Holding out her fragile, jeweled hand, she\r\nclasped his warmly, yet with honest sadness and compassion:\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Samuel. If it hadn’t been for the basket—.” She paused, slowly\r\nwithdrawing her hand, and then went on again: “You’re makin’ an awful\r\nmistake. Who’d a thought it of a man o’ your age! I shall never forget\r\nyou. Good-bye, Samuel.”\r\n\r\nWith one swift, half hungering, half frightened glance at the basket,\r\nshe slipped out of the room. Samuel did not laugh and his eyes did not\r\ntwinkle as he went up to the matron’s desk.\r\n\r\n“Miss Jessica, they’ve all practically refused me. What shall I do?” He\r\nhad a vision of an endless quest of an eligible, willing old lady from an\r\nold folks’ home.\r\n\r\nMiss Jessica thought a long while, biting the end of her pencil, and at\r\nlast she said slowly, half reluctantly:\r\n\r\n“There is one more—who—answers your requirements, but she was too proud\r\nto enter the lists.”\r\n\r\nSamuel’s face lit up. Proud women can be very tender and only a tender\r\nsoul could accept the basket. Moreover, a woman with sufficient spirit to\r\nresent his action today was a woman after his own heart. He lifted his\r\nhead from its sidewise slant and, throwing back his shoulders, looked\r\nJessica square in the eyes:\r\n\r\n“What’s the woman’s name?”\r\n\r\n“Miss Ellie Smith.”\r\n\r\n“Waal, I be goin’ ter change it!” vowed Mr. Jessup. “Whar be she?”\r\n\r\nThe matron hesitated, wondering whether she could play the part of the\r\ntraitor to dignified, self-reliant Miss Ellie, but Jessica was very\r\nyoung. She looked down the long years that these two had traveled, and\r\nseeing how dusty and stony and hard the road had been, wondered why they\r\nshould not come into a restful, fragrant garden at last. Ellie, she knew,\r\neven yet, with the help of the right man, could make the garden. And now\r\nas she looked keenly into Samuel Jessup’s eyes—eyes shaded by iron-gray\r\nbrows, but deep, dark brown eyes, limpid, sparkling, full of tenderness\r\nand an appealing hunger for tenderness—she felt that Samuel could play an\r\nall-sufficient Adam to Ellie’s Eve, in the garden.\r\n\r\n“Miss Ellie’s all alone in the kitchen, hulling strawberries for supper,”\r\nshe said very low. Then bending far over her desk, as if completely\r\nabsorbed in her books, she went on: “It’s the south dining-room door. Go\r\nright in, take the basket with you—no, no, not that woman, too—and ask\r\nMiss Ellie if she won’t take charge of your basket for an hour or so.”\r\n\r\nSamuel grinned. He wagged his head back and forth until his wig shook\r\nin sympathetic anticipation. Years and years seemed to fall from him,\r\nuntil with his small, thick-set figure and his sparkling, youthful eyes\r\nhe looked like a boy getting ready to steal apples. With short, firm,\r\nquicksteps he entered the dining-room. No one would have thought him a\r\nvictim of lumbago from his gait now. Then of a sudden, Miss Jessica, no\r\nlonger able to contain herself, went into her private room, where he had\r\nconsulted with the ten, and danced around with glee.\r\n\r\n“Miss Ellie, you darling!” she whispered to herself. “I know you’ll do\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nMiss Ellie, in a prim, dainty blue gingham dress, with a great bib apron\r\nenveloping her slender figure, sat at the south kitchen window hulling\r\nberries, the basket of red fruit on the table beside her, a yellow\r\nearthen bowl in her lap. Her silver-gold hair caught sunbeam lights from\r\nthe window until each single thread danced and twinkled. Little curls\r\nof silver gold nestled against the nape of her slender neck. Her face\r\nwas that of an April lady’s—first the clouds chased across it, clouds of\r\ncontempt, of anger and of regret; and then it took on a soft blaze of\r\ntenderness and of passionate longing.\r\n\r\nShe did not want Mr. Samuel Jessup or any other man. She scorned the\r\nwoman who might take him today for his home and that little sum of money;\r\nbut why—why had she with all her power of loving and of attracting love,\r\nall the unspent passion of motherhood that had been her ruling passion\r\nsince the doll-baby age—why had she come to see sixty-one without finding\r\nMr. Right? Lovers in moderate numbers she had had in the days of long\r\nago, and old people do not forget the loves of the springtime, but all\r\nthe while—all through the spring and the summer and this swiftly passing\r\nautumn—or was it really winter-time?—there had never come to her one\r\nwhom she would rejoice to call her mate! Him she did not regret so much\r\nnowadays, or she regretted him with a vague, indistinct feeling. He\r\nmight have liked strong drink and smoked a strong pipe indoors. But the\r\nchildren! Ah, the children that had never come!\r\n\r\nShe had outlived all her people. There were no nieces, no nephews, no one\r\nin all the world whom she could call her own, and there had never been\r\nand never could be a little grandchild to pull at her skirts.\r\n\r\n“Dran-ma! I love oo, dran-ma!” Only yesterday she had heard a little\r\nchild lisp this into the ears of Mrs. Young.\r\n\r\n“Dran-ma, I love oo, dran-ma!” whispered Ellie, bending far over the\r\nberries with the hot gushing of tears coming into her eyes.\r\n\r\nBoth the ache of motherhood and the ache of grandmotherhood were upon\r\nher. Never to have felt the touch of her own babe at her breast! And,\r\nnow that old age had withered the breast, never to hear the prattle of\r\ngrandchildren in her ears! And her ears were still so finely attuned,\r\nunlike the average grandmother! Miss Ellie looked up from her berries at\r\nthe window. Her eyes were too dim to see, and wiping the tears away she\r\nlooked out of the window again, down the garden. So, young girls stare\r\nwistfully as if they would look to the very end of the world and discover\r\nwhat, in the very end, may come to them.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room door opened. Miss Ellie turned back to her task. She\r\nscorned to look up and ask her fellow inmate of the Home who had won\r\nSamuel Jessup. It was probably Mrs. Homan coming to help with the supper.\r\nSteps came across the kitchen. Ellie bent far over the yellow bowl and\r\nwent on with her berry hulling. It needed a great many berries to supply\r\nthat supper table. The sunbeam darted down from the top of Ellie’s head\r\nto seek out with its twinkling, gold-shod feet the silver-gold curls in\r\nEllie’s neck. The steps paused close beside Ellie. Suddenly the spinster\r\nrealized that they were not Mrs. Homan’s steps and she looked up. Scorn,\r\nindignation, amazement, and then something more subtle, something which\r\none sees in faces everywhere all over the world, and something which\r\nmakes the world more beautiful, crossed her face. There stood Samuel\r\nJessup with the huge market basket in one hand. He held out the basket to\r\nMiss Ellie. He looked at her eagerly, almost with piteous appeal, as if\r\nto say:\r\n\r\n“They would have none of it, but—_you_! _You?_”\r\n\r\nThe red table cover had been thrown off the basket. There lay the\r\ncontents before Miss Ellie’s eyes. A big white pillow and resting upon\r\nit, a baby—a real, live, pink-and-white, wide-awake baby. More than this,\r\na baby who at first sight of Miss Ellie holding poised in her hand a\r\nhuge, red strawberry, struggled up into a sitting position, held out his\r\ntwo pudgy, dimpled little hands and cried with the softest, most ecstatic\r\nlittle cry imaginable: “Dranny!”\r\n\r\nThe baby’s grandmother had died last week, but neither Miss Ellie nor the\r\nbaby knew that, and Samuel Jessup kept a wise silence.\r\n\r\nTrembling, agitated, scarcely able to see or hear for the moment\r\nfollowing the baby’s cry, Miss Ellie put down the red berry, placed\r\nthe bowl on the table, and then turned to take the baby. She asked no\r\nquestions. She simply took him. She knew that he was hers. Even now\r\nagain—would her heart burst with joy and her ears lose their power of\r\nhearing!—even now again he was murmuring and mumbling: “Dranny! Dranny!”\r\nNow she knew that she would hear the prattle of one she called grandchild\r\nin her ears and guide with her shriveled old hands the unsteady movements\r\nof these little feet. Samuel Jessup counted not at all just then; but if\r\nhe had attempted to take away that baby, she would have fought him like a\r\nmother-tigress.\r\n\r\nSamuel had meant to say much. He said nothing, but simply put his hand\r\nagainst his throat and looked at her. He saw her devour with eyes and\r\nlips the tender little form—saw her seek out the baby wrinkles in the fat\r\nlittle dimpled neck—saw her munch hungrily at the baby’s yellow curls—saw\r\nher feel every bone of the little body through the stiff starchy white\r\ndress as if she loved each one more than the other. And then at length he\r\nwatched her unfasten the shoes, pull off the tiny white socks and then\r\nadore with the pent-up passion of the lonely years the adorable little\r\nrosy heel of his baby.\r\n\r\nSamuel cleared his throat with a loud noise and walked across the room.\r\nHe noticed a red calico curtain at the cupboard door and wondered\r\nwhether Miss Ellie had made it. In his mind’s eye, he saw another\r\nkitchen, smaller than this, cosier, but still with red calico curtains\r\nat the cupboard door and crisp white swiss ones—as crisp as the baby’s\r\ndress—at the windows. He knew that Miss Ellie would not want to get\r\nthose curtains stained up with tobacco smoke—she looked so dainty—so\r\nhe would volunteer to do his smoking on the back porch. If she left the\r\nwindow open, he could look through and talk to her and the little one.\r\nHe came beside Miss Ellie’s chair and stood looking down at her lovely\r\nhead and the baby’s cheek pressed against her own. The baby, quieted with\r\nhappiness against that breast, was profoundly still.\r\n\r\nThrough the open door came a wonderful fragrance—as the fragrance of\r\nyouthful love—blown in from the syringa bush beside the kitchen door.\r\nThey must plant a syringa beside the kitchen door-step in the new home,\r\nthought Samuel. Out of the stillness, he spoke, his voice very husky.\r\n\r\n“You be a woman arter my own heart—I knowed it when I see you a-settin’\r\nhere a-hullin’ berries. It’s more than I ’spected. I never dreamed it\r\ncould be: I was that old. But, Miss Ellie, you be—you be—” He lost his\r\nvoice entirely for a space and fearfully, reverently, he lifted in his\r\ntrembling fingers one of the silver-gold curls that lay on her neck,\r\nlifted it and immediately let it fall in place again. “You be,” he\r\nwhispered, “a woman arter my own heart. I never found sech a one when I\r\nwas young. I know it now, fer ef I had, I wouldn’t ’a’ been afeared of no\r\nbad luck fer neither her ner me. I’d a took her an’—” another pause and\r\nthen with brave, masculine assurance, “she’d ’a’ took me.”\r\n\r\nMiss Ellie did not move, she did not speak. She felt that his voice was\r\nvery far away, away off back in her youth where she had dreamed of the\r\nmate who was yet to come. Closer she pressed her cheek to the baby’s and\r\nso assured herself that baby and the man who had brought her the baby\r\nwere real and belonged to today.\r\n\r\nSamuel was speaking again, his hand now on the back of her chair, so that\r\nit brushed against the ruffle that ran across the shoulders of her apron.\r\n\r\n“I allers wanted children, an’ when I got too old to have the hope o’\r\never a-marryin’, I used ter say ter myself: ‘Oh, ef they was only leetle\r\ngrand-younguns now!’ Then the fortune come. Says I fust thing: ‘I’ll\r\nhave a baby. I’ll be a granddaddy yit.’ Thar wa’n’t much mean about me.\r\nI be sixty-nine, but I wanted my own home, an’ my own wife, an’ my own\r\nbaby. But I wanted the baby most of all. So the fust thing I done when\r\nthe money come was ter go to that thar Margaret Jane Orphan Asylum an git\r\nthis here baby. He hadn’t been there but a week. Jest lost his grandma\r\nan’ his grandpa—didn’t yer, yer pore leetle cuss, yer? He’s legally\r\nadopted. His name is Samuel Biggs Jessup, Jr. Ain’t he a wallopin’ fine\r\nfeller!”\r\n\r\nSamuel exploded at the last. His bashfulness, his self-depreciation,\r\nhis afraidness, were all gone. He bent over, his hands on his knees,\r\nand looked into the baby’s face. The baby’s face was very close to\r\nEllie’s. The baby’s face was dimpled and smiling, while over Ellie’s\r\nface there was a flush of joyous young motherhood together with the\r\nproud, all-wondering delight of grandmotherhood, and blending with both,\r\na sweet shame and shrinking such as no one but a virgin can wear. Oh,\r\nexquisite, young-old Miss Ellie! Your eyes swimming in unshed tears were\r\nso beautiful then with the inner light that Samuel blinked to see them.\r\n\r\n“Miss Ellie,” he whispered. Very still was the kitchen. The syringa\r\noutside the door shook out its perfume just for these two. The wind\r\nmurmured through the fragrant flowers—it murmured:\r\n\r\n“Again and again and again! Even for the old, this same old story!”\r\n\r\n“Ellie,” whispered Samuel. “I want you even more than I want the baby.\r\nWill you marry me?”\r\n\r\nAgain the silence fell, and after a long while, the voice of Ellie’s\r\ndream-swept, ideal-keeping youth came from within the curves of the\r\nbaby’s cheek where her lips were hiding:\r\n\r\n“Samuel, you been a long time comin’.” Her voice faltered and then\r\ngathering a girlish tremor went on, “But, even ef you hadn’t brought the\r\nbaby, I should say you was wuth all the waitin’.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Control or Ownership?_\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES Q. DE FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nFew men who have studied the question, and who are free to make a frank\r\nstatement of their views, see much hope for a “square deal” in railroad\r\nrates under private ownership. Most of those who really want a square\r\ndeal, however, are giving the President their moral support, not because\r\nthey expect him to solve the problem with his formula of “control,” but\r\nbecause they feel that the agitation he has caused and is fomenting will\r\ninure to the benefit of the public ownership and operation idea. His\r\nopponents charge as much—and they are correct. Many of their arguments\r\nagainst control are valid, too, if we grant that private ownership in\r\nthis age of our civilization is best. Of course, we do not grant that.\r\n\r\nIt seems certain at this writing (March 4) that the Hepburn-Dolliver bill\r\nwill become a law—one of those dead letters, so many of which already\r\nencumber our Federal and State statute books. That it cannot and will not\r\nbe enforced, except in a few spectacular instances to fool the multitude,\r\nis as certain as anything in human affairs. The roads will continue to\r\ntake all that the traffic will bear, to give rebates, and to water stock\r\nin the good old way. If any doubt this, let them read the intensely\r\ninteresting letters in various newspapers sent out each week from\r\nWashington by Lincoln Steffens. Mr. Steffens has, after most thorough\r\ninvestigation, reached the conclusion that our people are suffering not\r\nso much because of bribery and corruption as from having abdicated in\r\nfavor of the railroads and other big corporations. It is not necessary\r\nnow for a railroad corporation to bribe a congressman or senator—because\r\nmost of these supposed people’s representatives are actually the railroad\r\nrepresentatives, and many of them heavy stockholders.\r\n\r\nMr. Steffens can lay no claim to a patent on this information by right of\r\noriginal discovery, for Populists said the same thing (only not so aptly,\r\nperhaps), twelve to fifteen years ago. But he is reaching an audience\r\nthat the Populists did not and possibly never could reach. And he tells\r\nthe story so well that we must accord him the highest meed of praise. I\r\ncannot refrain from quoting a paragraph concerning the spectacle he sees\r\nin Washington (New York _World_, March 4):\r\n\r\n    “We, the people of the United States, are the petitioners.\r\n    (For railroad rate legislation). We are coming here asking\r\n    through the President that that bill (Hepburn-Dolliver) be\r\n    passed so as to relieve us from certain abuses practised\r\n    everywhere by our chartered common carriers, the railroads.\r\n    And the representatives of those railroads and their allied\r\n    corporations sit here enthroned; and they decide upon our case.\r\n    They may decide in our favor but—the intolerable fact of it all\r\n    is—they decide. They rule; they may be good rulers; but they\r\n    rule.”\r\n\r\nThat is the deliberate statement of a man who has gained an enviable\r\nreputation for thorough-going investigation. He is not a demagogue or a\r\nwriter of penny-dreadfuls. He is on the ground and supports every one of\r\nhis general statements with concrete examples.\r\n\r\nMr. Steffens blames the people for the present state of affairs. I\r\nheartily agree with him. But I believe we should try to reason out where\r\nthe first big mistake was made and arrive at a conclusion as to the best\r\nway out of the difficulty, unless, perchance, our people really like the\r\nrule of railroad oligarchy. I believe it is a useless task to chide the\r\npeople for lack of civic righteousness, for indifference, for supineness,\r\nfor failure to go to the primaries, etc., unless we point out clearly how\r\ncomplete sovereignty may be secured. It is useless to scold a man for\r\nnot filling his lungs with oxygen, if you advise him to stay in a room\r\novercharged with carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nThe present state of affairs is due primarily to two great causes, or\r\nreally to one cause operating through two different channels:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The private ownership of railroads.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The private control of the issue and circulation of money.\r\n\r\nThe latter cause, in my judgment, is immeasurably greater than the\r\nformer; but public opinion is now directed toward the former, so that\r\na discussion of it is sure of a careful hearing. I do not insist that\r\npermitting the private ownership of railroads was an irremediable\r\nmistake; in fact, there is much good argument in favor of the contention\r\nthat under private ownership the roads were developed faster and better\r\nthan they, in all likelihood, would have been under public ownership. And\r\nwe may admit, without at all prejudicing our case, that in the evolution\r\nof railroading, private ownership was best at the start. This is not\r\ncapable of demonstration—but we need not quarrel over it.\r\n\r\nA railroad is a highway; and a highway is one of the attributes of\r\nsovereignty. Whoever owns and controls the road is to that extent a\r\nsovereign. And under our aggravated system of _laissez faire_, ownership\r\nand control always go together, except with the slightest modifications.\r\nHence, with private ownership of railroads, it was inevitable that we\r\nshould reach just such a state of affairs as Mr. Steffens pictures.\r\nWhy shouldn’t “representatives of those railroads and their allied\r\ncorporations” sit here enthroned?\r\n\r\nThe owners of those roads are absolute sovereigns over the principal\r\navenue for the distribution of commodities; and under our highly\r\ndeveloped methods of production, with extreme division of labor, a great\r\ndistribution of commodities is absolutely essential. With power to tax at\r\nwill all users of highways, their owners can control, in a great measure,\r\nall productive industry.\r\n\r\nI am not a believer in total depravity. I can see no necessity or reason\r\nfor calling railroad magnates hard names, or accusing them of unpatriotic\r\nscheming for power—except, possibly, for the purpose of arousing a\r\nlethargic people to a sense of their own wrongs. Being an actual\r\nsovereign, because owning the highways—the real, vital highways—and\r\npossessing the power to tax, I can understand how the railroads were,\r\nin a great measure, compelled to unite _de jure_ and _de facto_\r\nsovereignty. With non-railroad or anti-railroad men in the legislative,\r\nadministrative and judicial bodies, “sand-bagging” and hold-ups were\r\ncommon. In self-defense (for no man ever lived who likes to be deprived\r\nof power), the railroads bribed and corrupted. They were by no means the\r\nsole culprits. The taker of a bribe is just as despicable as the giver.\r\nBut gradually the system evolved to its present state—the union of all\r\nsovereign powers. The Government persisted in its refusal to go into\r\nthe railroad business—so the railroads quite naturally went into the\r\ngoverning business.\r\n\r\nWe cannot undo what has been done. We cannot turn back the wheels of time\r\nand begin all over again with public ownership of railroads; but we can,\r\nand I think we will, in not many years hence, take over the railroads\r\nand make them public property, operating them by Government officials.\r\nThe union of sovereign powers is now complete: the owners of highways\r\nand “their allied corporations,” by their representatives, are now\r\nenthroned as the actual Government. This is as it should be, except that\r\nthe ownership is too limited. _It should be made to include the whole\r\npeople._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Will It Come to this at Niagara?_\r\n\r\n    _Morris, in Spokane Spokesman Review_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_What, Doctor, All of This?_”\r\n\r\n    _Warren, in Boston Herald_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Puzzle.—Which Way Is He Going?_\r\n\r\n    _Handy, in Duluth News Tribune_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _R.

NORMAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Don’t think that I ain’t willin’ for you to have the home-place like pa\r\nwanted you to, Indie,” said the thin, tired voice that was fast wearing\r\ninto silence, “’cause I am. It’s no more ’n right after all you’ve done\r\nfor me ’n pa. The t’others has all got homes o’ their own an’ you ain’t\r\ngot nobody to fall back on. But, Indie, promise me you won’t close the\r\ndoor agin poor Tom if he should come back. Give him shelter an’ welcome\r\nfor my sake, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nIndie promised solemnly. Her thoughts went back to one still, tranquil\r\nnight years before, when the doors of that same home had been closed\r\nagainst the wayward son by the father who vowed never to look upon his\r\nboy’s face again. The mother—a frail, submissive, toil-worn woman—had\r\nmourned in secret, but her prayers had been unanswered.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been dreadful good to us,” the dying voice murmured; “I hope the\r\nLord will make it up to you somehow, Indie. Do you reckon the girls will\r\ngit here ’fore I die?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Aunt Viney, I really b’lieve they will. But you go to sleep if you\r\ncan. I’ll wake you as soon as they git here.”\r\n\r\nBy and by the sick woman fell into a gentle doze that deepened into the\r\nsleep that knows no earthly waking. The married daughters came too late,\r\nbut if they were greatly grieved over their mother’s death they made\r\nlittle outward sign. They stayed at the home place for two days, during\r\nwhich the will was read. It deeded all that remained of the Pasely farm,\r\nthat had been divided and subdivided to supply marriage portions for\r\nfour, to Indie, in consideration of her faithful services for the old\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\n“Maybe you can ketch Lem Powers with this bait,” was Louise’s spiteful\r\ncomment, after the reading was over. “Everyone knows you always wanted\r\nhim bad enough.”\r\n\r\nMary, the eldest cousin, laughed dryly. “Indie can’t complain of the way\r\nour folks treated her,” she said with ill-concealed bitterness. “This\r\nfarm is worth a thousand dollars above the mortgage money. It ain’t many\r\npoor relations that has property like this left to ’em.”\r\n\r\n“I guess Indie knows that she didn’t come by it plum honest,” the third\r\ncousin remarked. “She knowed how to work around the old folks so’s to git\r\n’em to leave her what they had. Well, we ain’t the kind to make trouble\r\neven if we _have_ been wronged.”\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone, Indie abandoned herself to a passion of helpless,\r\npiteous grief. She recalled one cruel hour long ago when her cousin\r\nLouise had accused her of caring, unasked, for friendly, pleasant Lem\r\nPowers, whose off-hand calls on the family stood out in Indie’s memory as\r\nthe brightest events of her lonely, toilful life. Indie was twenty-three\r\nand plain, for the flower-like prettiness of her early childhood had long\r\nsince succumbed to the triple blight of care and drudgery and loneliness.\r\nIt had been known among her neighbors and acquaintances that Indie, at\r\nthe age of eighteen, had never been “spoke for,” wherefore she had meekly\r\naccepted the stigma of spinsterhood that comes very early to the Southern\r\ncountry girl and had withdrawn from the mild frivolities of youth to\r\nbecome a household drudge in her uncle’s family in order that her cousins\r\nmight have more leisure and freedom. After the death of her hard-working\r\nuncle, she had stayed with her ailing aunt while the girls married and\r\nleft her.\r\n\r\n“I wisht I’d died instid of Aunt Viney,” Indie sobbed in utter loneliness.\r\n\r\nFor two years Indie lived quietly and comfortably in the old home, paying\r\nher simple expenses by raising garden truck for the town hotel. Then a\r\nletter came from Tom’s widow imploring his people to send her enough\r\nmoney to defray Tom’s funeral expenses to avert his threatened burial\r\nin the potter’s field. It was a pathetic appeal, involving the brief\r\nstory of Tom’s struggles, how he had worked his way with his little\r\nfamily from Texas to the old home state, where he had obtained employment\r\nin a factory. He had met his death through a boiler explosion the day\r\nbefore the letter was written. Tom had always hoped for a reconciliation\r\nin spite of his father’s unyielding hardness, the widow wrote. In\r\nconclusion, she begged his people not to allow his body to be consigned\r\nto a nameless grave.\r\n\r\nIndie went straight to Mr. Griggs, the real estate agent, who held the\r\nfour-hundred-dollar mortgage on her farm, and asked him to lend her a\r\nhundred dollars. He refused gently but firmly.\r\n\r\n“Why, Indie, by the time you sell that farm it may not be worth five\r\nhundred dollars in all,” he said. “The interest on the mortgage is about\r\ndue now and here you are wanting to borrow more!”\r\n\r\n“It’s for a particular purpose that can’t wait a day,” Indie told him\r\nanxiously, trembling in every nerve with the fear of disappointment.\r\n\r\n“I can’t help that. Business is business you know, and every man must\r\nlook out for his own interests. There is only one way to get that money\r\nand that is to sell the place as it stands before the debts eat it up\r\ncompletely. I know a party that would buy, probably.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I couldn’t sell the only home I’ve got,” Indie said piteously.\r\n\r\n“It’ll come to that in the end, anyhow,” Griggs answered indifferently.\r\n“My advice is to get rid of it now, while there is a few dollars in it\r\nfor you. Anyway, you can’t raise that hundred you want any other way. If\r\nI was in your place I’d sell and go down to Birmingham and get work in\r\nthe factory, where you’ll make something besides a mere living.”\r\n\r\nIndie’s heart almost stopped beating at the very thought of leaving the\r\nold familiar haunts for a strange city. Yet, Tom must have a decent\r\nburial at any cost to herself.\r\n\r\n“What could you get for the farm?” Indie asked huskily.\r\n\r\n“Eight or nine hundred I reckon.”\r\n\r\n“Could you let me have the hundred right now if I agree to sell the\r\nplace?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll sell—because I’ve got to have that money right off.”\r\n\r\nIndie hurried home and began to put things to rights. She packed up her\r\npersonal belongings and moved all her humble furniture into one room,\r\nwhere it could be easily got at in case she should send for it a little\r\nlater, if she were fortunate enough to secure steady work in the factory\r\nwhich Mr. Griggs had referred to. He had even given her a clipping from\r\nthe Sunday paper containing an advertisement calling for twenty new\r\nhands, “experience not necessary.”\r\n\r\nIndie was sweeping the back yard when some one strode up the pebbled walk\r\nwith brisk, business-like steps, which she mistook for Mr. Griggs’s walk,\r\nfor he had promised to stop in on his homeward way. But it was not the\r\nagent. It was Indie’s old friend Lem Powers, whom she had so timidly\r\navoided for years. His broad-brimmed hat was turned up squarely in front,\r\nframing his dark, strong, sunny face in a sort of a rough halo.\r\n\r\n“Evenin’, Indie,” said he, with a tug at his up-standing hat-brim. “Do\r\nyou happen to have a wrench about the place? My buggy wheel’s locked an’\r\nI ain’t got no tools with me.”\r\n\r\nIndie shook down her sleeves hurriedly, keenly conscious of her\r\nunpleasing appearance. “Won’t you set down while I hunt up the wrench?”\r\nshe asked, nodding toward the veranda bench. “I’ve done packed up\r\neverything, but I can find the wrench easy’s not.”\r\n\r\n“Packed up!” the young man echoed in blank astonishment, with a sweeping\r\nglance at the denuded premises. “Why, you don’t aim to move, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I expect to leave Shallow Ford to-morrer mornin’,” Indie answered\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\n“You don’t say so? Goin’ to live with your cousins?”\r\n\r\n“No, oh no,” Indie answered quickly, with a dry smile. “None of them\r\nain’t never asked me to live with ’em, and even if they had I wouldn’t\r\ngo.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know you had other kin.”\r\n\r\n“I ain’t. I aim to go to Birmingham to work in the factory. I seen a\r\nadvertisement callin’ for twenty new hands and I thought it would be a\r\ngood chance to get started.”\r\n\r\n“Whatever put that idee into your head, I’d like to know? I don’t b’lieve\r\nyou’ll like the work one bit, Indie,” the young man said with grim\r\nconviction. “It ain’t healthy, to begin with. Don’t you rec’lect how pale\r\nan’ peekedy them Baldwins looked when they come back here on a visit\r\nafter havin’ worked in the thread factory down at Birmingham? They didn’t\r\nhave the sperit of a jack rabbit between ’em, an’ their ways was plum\r\nchanged too—sorter forrard like. You won’t like the sort of company they\r\nkeep, Indie.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got to go now,” said Indie, doggedly, “cause I’ve done put the\r\nplace for sale. Mr Griggs thinks he can sell it without any trouble.”\r\n\r\n“He may. Indie, is it on account of the mortgage you’re leavin’?”\r\n\r\nIndie shook her head. She could not tell Lem her real motive.\r\n\r\n“’Cause if it is,” said Lem, earnestly, “I’d be only too glad to stand\r\ngood for the debt if you’ll let me.”\r\n\r\nIndie’s pale face reddened painfully, and her head went back an inch or\r\ntwo, for she had her pride in spite of her helplessness. “I couldn’t ever\r\nraise enough truck to pay off the debt, anyhow,” she answered coldly.\r\n\r\n“You could rent the place an’ pay off that way. I do wish you would let\r\nyour old friends do a little something for you, Indie,” he pleaded,\r\ngrowing red and embarrassed under her increasing coldness.\r\n\r\n“It’s too late to rent now, ’cause it’s way past corn-plantin’ time,”\r\nIndie objected, “an there ain’t nothin started but two acres o’ roastin’\r\nears an’ some garden truck.”\r\n\r\n“I should think you’d hate to leave the old place,” Lem observed, letting\r\nhis bright gaze wander over the green pasture strip and the narrow creek\r\nbottoms where the young corn waved idly in the evening breeze.\r\n\r\nIndie’s thin face clouded with the shadow of regret, but she made no\r\nreply, for she would not have admitted, on pain of death, that her heart\r\nached with the pathos of renunciation.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t there nary thing I can do for you, Indie?” Lem asked, after\r\nan awkward pause, in what seemed to the listener a very off-hand,\r\nindifferent voice.\r\n\r\n“No thanky. There ain’t a thing to do but to take the cow over to board\r\nwith the Bankses. Seems like I can’t bear the thoughts of sellin’ her\r\nto out-an’-out strangers, so I thought I’d board her till some of the\r\nneighbors gits ready to buy her. Miss Clayton’s goin’ to keep Billy for\r\nme till I get settled, so’s I can take him.”\r\n\r\nBilly, the big tortoise-shell cat that purred on the door step, lifted\r\nhis head at the sound of his own name and blinked contentedly, whereupon\r\nLem stooped and stroked his glossy fur. “I guess Billy’ll miss you if no\r\none else does,” he remarked dryly.\r\n\r\nThen he rose and held out a big brown hand. “Well, good-bye, Indie, an’\r\ngood luck to you,” said he. “If ever I can do anything for you, let me\r\nknow, will you?”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” said Indie gravely.\r\n\r\nIndie went away the next morning—a morning full of balm and peace. Fresh,\r\nfragrant winds scattered the rose petals thickly over her shoulders as\r\nshe hurried down the garden path to meet the stage. She did not trust\r\nherself to glance back, for some strange, dumb emotion tugged at her\r\nheart-strings and soundless voices called to her out of the sweet silence\r\nthat enveloped earth and sky.\r\n\r\nShe shivered as she entered the hot, sultry, dust-laden train with its\r\nburden of dull, spiritless travelers. “It must be the air,” she murmured\r\nto herself as she sank into a seat. “These cars is awful clost with the\r\nsun beatin’ down on ’em an no air stirrin’. Now, if a body was at home\r\nthey could open the doors an’ winders an’ set in the shade.”\r\n\r\n“Home! Home! Home!” said the swiftly revolving wheels that bore her\r\nrelentlessly away from the old, sweetly familiar scenes toward an\r\nunknown, lonely future. She watched the green fields and woods that\r\nwhirled past the windows until they grew less and less frequent, with\r\ndingy little stations squatted between them. The landscape changed and\r\nthe car grew hotter and the smoke thicker, for the train was approaching\r\nthe factory district of Birmingham, the Alabama metropolis. Children,\r\nwith unclean, pallid, faces, stared up at the car windows as the train\r\npulled through their grimy quarters, and men in blackened, greasy clothes\r\nlounged along the tracks in the occasional shade of a sweltering brick\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nIndie found the squalid home of Tom’s widow after much patient wandering\r\nabout the uneven, unswept streets. Many minutes passed before her ring\r\nwas answered; then a white-faced woman opened the door a very little way.\r\nYes, she was Mrs. Pasely. Did anyone want to see her?\r\n\r\n“I am Tom’s cousin, Indie,” the caller announced simply. “I’ve brung the\r\nmoney for Tom’s funeral.”\r\n\r\nThe widow cried a little at first while she told Indie of Tom’s tragic\r\ndeath, but her mind was too absorbingly occupied over the funeral to\r\npermit of the luxury of self-pity. She dressed hurriedly and went out\r\nto communicate with the undertaker, leaving Indie with the children,\r\nthree little, frail, colorless, old-young beings, who reminded Indie of\r\ncellar-grown plants. The widow was not long away; late that afternoon the\r\ntwo women and their three charges followed Tom’s remains to consecrated\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“I never can tell you how thankful I am,” was all Mrs. Pasely said to\r\nIndie concerning her sacrifice, “for now I feel at rest about poor Tom\r\nbein’ laid away like he ought to be. If the baby was just well I’d try\r\nto start out an’ make a livin’ and do my best without Tom,” she added\r\nmournfully, “but it seems like I ain’t got no heart to do nothin’ while\r\nhe’s so weak and puny. He ain’t been to say real well since we left\r\nTexas, where we lived right out in the country. I’ve tried everything I\r\ncould think of but nothin’ don’t do him no good as I can see. The doctor\r\nsays he won’t never git well till I take him back to the country, an\r\nmaybe not then. Me’n Minnie’s got promise of work in the factory next\r\nweek, but if little Tom ain’t no better I can’t leave him with jest Jim\r\nto look after him. If we only could git back to Texas agin we’d all git\r\nwell an’ stout, an’ I wouldn’t care if we _was_ poor. All I care about is\r\nfor little Tom to git well.”\r\n\r\nOh, if she could only take them all back to the farm with her, thought\r\nIndie. A great wave of home longing surged through her heart as she\r\nthought of the peace and beauty of the deserted home. She knew just where\r\nthe shadows of noontide lay darkest over the old rose-bordered yard—knew\r\nthat the back veranda where she always ate her simple midday meals with\r\nBilly purring at her feet was just then in the thickest shadow of the\r\nchina-berry trees, and that all was still and sweet and tranquil in\r\nthat far-off haven of rest. Instead of factory walls there were green,\r\nblossomed hedges; instead of the strident clamor of motor cars and mill\r\ngongs there was a ceaseless chorus of song birds, and instead of the hot,\r\nsmoke-tainted air of the city, there was the fine, earthy fragrance of\r\nthe good sweet soil that lay fallow while so many weary toilers sweltered\r\nin their city prisons.\r\n\r\nIndie made Tom’s widow understand the whole situation, then she offered\r\nherself in any capacity that could serve little Tom, who had the look\r\nthat she dimly remembered in young Tom when she first went to live with\r\nhis parents. Indie would take work in the factory as she had planned to\r\ndo and board with Tom’s widow to help along all she could, or she would\r\ntake them all back to the farm and work very hard to make a mere living\r\nwhile little Tom had a chance for his life.\r\n\r\n“Why, I’d be willin’ to work day an’ night on a farm!” the widow answered\r\nearnestly. “I’m jest plum certain Tom will git well way off there in the\r\ncountry. Oh, do take us back with you! Me’n Minnie an’ Jim can make a\r\nreal good crop between us. You’ll see!”\r\n\r\nThat was what Indie wanted. She would sacrifice the last thing that\r\nremained to her—her pride—and ask Lem to help her by standing good for\r\nthe hundred-dollar note, and far the rest she would work as she had never\r\nworked before.\r\n\r\n“We’ll go tomorrow,” Indie announced. “You git right to work packin’ up\r\nwhat you want to take.”\r\n\r\nThe world was aflame with the splendid fires of sunset when the little\r\nparty alighted before the farm gate on the following evening. “I’m real\r\nglad it’s light enough for you to see the flowers an’ things,” said\r\nIndie, as she led the way up the rose-bordered walk that seemed to greet\r\nher with sweet familiarity. “Good thing I left the key under the porch\r\nsteps right where I could find it handy. There, now walk right in an’ set\r\ndown, while I kindle a fire an’ git some supper.”\r\n\r\nShe had bought a few eatables the last thing before leaving Birmingham,\r\nwhich she speedily converted into a tempting meal. Her guests rewarded\r\nher industry to a gratifying degree, even to little Tom, who seemed to\r\nhave acquired a good appetite which delighted his frail, worried mother\r\nbeyond bounds. “He ain’t et like that in I dunno when!” she exclaimed\r\nwith tears of joy.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon Indie’s usual bedtime when her ministration ended. She\r\nslipped out for a quiet rest on the front door-step to enjoy the peace\r\nand loveliness of the perfect spring night, but hardly had she seated\r\nherself when the garden gate creaked rustily and someone strode up the\r\nwalk with heavy strides. At the sight of the dim figure on the step the\r\nintruder stopped precipitately.\r\n\r\n“Who’s there?” asked a familiar voice.\r\n\r\nIndie rose tremblingly. “It’s Indie Bright,” she answered. “Did you want\r\nto see me?”\r\n\r\n“Indie!” exclaimed a voice so thrillingly joyous that the listener felt\r\nherself quiver from head to foot with a strange, inexplicable ecstasy.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t it Lem Powers?” she asked. “Has anything happened?”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I’d like to know,” came the surprised answer. “I thought you\r\nwas gone!”\r\n\r\nIndie told her story briefly, carefully deflecting all merit from\r\nherself. “I’m real glad it happened that way,” she finished, “for I did\r\nhate to sell the old place.”\r\n\r\nLem drew a deep breath. “You’re jest five hours too late, Indie,” he said\r\nin a queer voice, “for the agent sold the farm this afternoon at four\r\no’clock.”\r\n\r\nIndie felt the solid earth recede beneath her. “Sold it!” she echoed\r\nfearsomely. “Oh, Lem, whatever _shall_ I do!”\r\n\r\n“I dunno. There ain’t no use in tryin’ to buy it back, ’cause the man\r\nthat bought it won’t part with it for anything, except——”\r\n\r\nHe paused and went a step nearer. “Except you’ll give him what he’s\r\nalways wanted—yourself. Indie, I never did want no other girl but you,\r\nan’ never will.”\r\n\r\nIndie shrank away, but a strong, warm hand found hers in the shadow,\r\nwhile the low earnest voice went on to tell her of a miracle that\r\nthrilled every fibre of her being with unspeakable happiness.\r\n\r\n“I aimed to ask you the day you told me about leavin’,” Lem confessed,\r\n“but by the way you talked I thought it wouldn’t be no use, so I bought\r\nthe place hopin’ you’d want to come back some day.”\r\n\r\n“Lem,” said Indie, after a long, happy silence, “I never had no idee\r\nthat—that you ever wanted me. I thought it was Cousin Louise you wanted.”\r\n\r\n“Louise—after I’d seen you!” Lem cried incredulously. “Why that would be\r\nlike chosin’ a bit o’ glass instid of a real diamond. It was Louise as\r\ntold me how you’d took a dredful dislike to me from the very first, an’\r\nof course I couldn’t help but believe it by the way you always acted when\r\nI was around. I tell you, Indie, that made a heap o’ difference to me.\r\nI’d a done anything in the hull world for you an’ would yit if you’d only\r\nlet me.”\r\n\r\nIndie drew a deep breath that sounded strangely like a stifled sob. “Oh,\r\nLem, that’s just the way I’ve always felt about you,” she confessed very\r\nsoftly and hesitatingly.\r\n\r\nAfter a long, long while, during which the years and their burden of care\r\nand loneliness and heart-ache slipped away from Indie’s heart like an\r\nwornout garment, she drew her hands away from Lem’s close clasp. “You’d\r\nbetter go now, Lem,” she said very gently, “’cause it’s gitting late an’\r\nI don’t want to wake the folks up after they’ve got to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Indie. I’ll be back tomorrow to see about putting in a late\r\ncrop o’ corn for Tom’s folks to work out. We’ll jest let ’em keep the\r\nplace free of rent for a while an’ see to it that they make enough to\r\nkeep ’em. You can look after ’em all you want to, for it ain’t but a\r\nlittle piece from our place over here. Good night, Indie.”\r\n\r\nIndie lingered in the soft, starry dusk for a few moments after Lem had\r\ngone, to gloat over her great happiness; and presently something dark and\r\nsmall scuttled out of the lilac hedge and bounded into her lap with a mew\r\nof welcome. It was Billy, quivering with elation and delight.\r\n\r\nIndie caught her pet to her breast with a cry of rapture. “Oh, Billy,\r\nBilly, ain’t it lovely to be home again!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Our Civilization_\r\n\r\nBY COUNT LYOF TOLSTOY\r\n\r\n\r\nMen say that civilization, our civilization, is a great good. But they\r\nwho have this conviction belong to the minority who live not only in this\r\ncivilization but by it; who live in ease, almost idleness, in comparison\r\nto the lot of workmen.\r\n\r\nAll such men; kings, emperors, presidents, princes, ministers,\r\nfunctionaries, soldiers, proprietors, investors, merchants, engineers,\r\ndoctors, scientists, professors, priests, writers, are so sure our\r\ncivilization is a great good that they cannot bear the thought that it\r\nshould disappear or that it should even be changed.\r\n\r\nAsk, however, of the great mass of agricultural people, slave people,\r\nChinese, Hindus, Russians—ask nine-tenths of humanity whether this\r\ncivilization, which seems a superlative good to those who are not\r\nagriculturists, is really a blessing or not? Strangely enough,\r\nnine-tenths of humanity will reply in the negative.\r\n\r\nWhat they need is soil, fertilizer, irrigation, sun, rain, forests,\r\nharvests, and simple farming implements that one can make without\r\nabandoning the agricultural life. As for civilization, either they know\r\nnothing of it, or it presents itself to them under the aspect of the\r\ndebauchery of cities, with their prisons and their bagnios; or under the\r\naspect of taxes and useless monuments, of museums, of palaces; or under\r\nthe aspect of duties which prevent the free circulation of products; or\r\nunder the aspect of cannon, of armor and of armies that ravage whole\r\ncountries. And they say, if that is civilization it is of no use to them,\r\nand that, it is even hurtful to them. The men who enjoy the advantages\r\nof civilization maintain that it is good for all humanity; but in this\r\ncase they cannot bear testimony because they are both judges and parties\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nOne cannot deny that we are now far along the road of technical progress;\r\nbut what is far along on that road? A little minority lives on the back\r\nof the work people; and the work people, they who serve the men that\r\nenjoy civilization in the whole Christian world, continue to live as they\r\nlived five or six centuries ago, profiting only from time to time of the\r\nleavings of civilization.\r\n\r\nEven if they live better, the breach that separates their lot from that\r\nof the rich classes is rather wider than it was six centuries ago. I\r\ndo not say, as many think, that, since civilization is not an absolute\r\ngood we should throw out at one stroke the structure men have devised\r\nfor the struggle against nature; but I do say that, to make sure this\r\nstructure shall really serve men well, it is necessary that all and not\r\nonly a small minority enjoy it. No one must be deprived of his due by\r\nothers under the pretext that these benefits will return one day to his\r\ndescendants.\r\n\r\nThe good and reasonable life consists in choosing, of many ways that lie\r\nopen, the way that is best.\r\n\r\nTherefore Christian humanity in the present situation should choose\r\nbetween two things: either to continue along the path of wickedness in\r\nwhich existing civilization gives the greatest number of benefits to the\r\nsmallest number of people, keeping the others in poverty and slavery; or\r\nimmediately, without postponing it to a future more or less remote, to\r\nrenounce in part, or wholly, the advantages which this civilization has\r\ngiven to certain privileged ones, thereby preventing the liberation of\r\nthe majority of men from poverty and serfdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Coal Miner’s Story_\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES S. MOODY, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average worthy citizen reclining beside an open coal-grate, reading\r\nthe press accounts of the latest coal strike, has little interest in the\r\nmatter further than his interest in the probable effect of the labor\r\ndisturbance upon the price of his winter’s fuel. When he reaches that\r\npart of the narrative that tells of the troops having been ordered to the\r\nscene of action, the powerful arm of the military invoked to put down\r\nthe uprising among the working-men, he heaves a sigh of relief that now\r\nthe strike will be of short duration and the price of coal will not be\r\nadvanced. Seldom does he consider the matter from the standpoint of the\r\nman who mines the coal.\r\n\r\nWere that one big lump glowing warmly in the centre of the grate gifted\r\nwith the power of speech, it would tell a tale that might well harrow up\r\nthe feelings of the most callous. Alas! it is dumb, just as the man who\r\ndug it out of the bowels of the earth is dumb. It glows its heat away,\r\ncrumbles into gray ash, and the worthy citizen retires to his rest with\r\nmind untroubled by any unpleasant thought of want or penury among those\r\nwho go down into the unwholesome deeps of the mine and toil all day shut\r\nout from God’s gracious light that he and you and I may enjoy comfort and\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nAt one time of my life the relentless wheel of Fate in its ceaseless\r\nrevolving whirled me to its nadir, and spilled me into the squalid chaos\r\nof a coal-mining town, and, not content with that, hurled me into the\r\nnethermost hell of all that seething vortex of toil and poverty.\r\n\r\nThat the worthy citizen may see something of that side of the shield—the\r\nside sable—I will attempt to tell it, not with the graces of one skilled\r\nof pen, but in all its plain, naked, glaring hideousness.\r\n\r\nAt this point allow me to crave pardon for the frequent use of the\r\npersonal pronoun. I am speaking as a coal-miner, and can tell it better\r\nby using the first person.\r\n\r\nI was raised in the Far West. My life had been spent among the green\r\nmountains of the Pacific Coast, and I knew but little of the land beyond\r\nthe Rockies. When ambition came, as it comes to youth everywhere, I\r\ndreamed of other lands where that ambition might find its full fruition.\r\nI left the mountain home, and set out to conquer the world of my dreams.\r\nMy journey ended at the little town of Excello, in Northern Missouri. I\r\nwas moneyless, and, as I soon ascertained, friendless. Disappointment\r\nglared at me from every door. Every vocation in life seemed filled, and\r\nall the avenues leading thereto were crowded with men eager to push the\r\npossessor of a job from his place and occupy it in his stead. I tried\r\nevery possible chance for work, but without avail. Not even a country\r\ndistrict school, with all its manifold possibilities of poverty, was open\r\nto the stranger.\r\n\r\nNot far from Excello, the Kansas and Texas Coal company have opened up\r\nextensive mines at Ardmore. At last, desperate and in absolute despair, I\r\nturned to the coal mines that wait with black, widespread maws to suck in\r\nsuch flotsam of humanity as I was then. I set out from Excello on foot in\r\nthe bleak dawn of a March morning, for the only Mecca left open to me.\r\nA donkey-engine drawing a train of coal-cars soon overtook me, and the\r\nengineer stopped his train and took me on. It was but a trivial act of\r\nkindness to a stranger, but it stands out so distinct and vivid by reason\r\nof its rarity that I must speak of it here. Motives of the most sordid\r\nmeanness so completely actuate the principles of those people that the\r\nsimple act of one of them giving a tramp a ride glows from out the grime\r\nof greed like a gem.\r\n\r\nThe little engine grumbled and rattled its way down the banks of a dirty\r\nyellow stream, dignified by being called a river, until it halted beside\r\nthe head-house of one of the mines, and I was permitted to take my first\r\nview of Ardmore, one of the worlds that I had come so far to conquer. Ah,\r\nthe irony of it all! What a contrast to the mental picture that the boy\r\nhad painted upon the canvas of fancy not so many weeks before!\r\n\r\nFirst the tall head-house and hoist, with the coal-screens all under\r\none roof standing black and grimy at the mine’s mouth. Then the long\r\nincline, up which crawled the laden cars from the mine, looking for all\r\nthe world like filthy serpents from some subterranean world. Off to one\r\nside towered the culm-pile, emitting its choking sulphurous smoke and\r\npolluting the muddy water of the little stream that wound about its base.\r\nOff yonder, on either side of the same stream, perched a double row of\r\nsqualid grimy shacks, like gigantic carrion birds waiting to pounce upon\r\nthe filth that flowed down the current of the river. These were the homes\r\nof the miners. Home! What a travesty on the sweetest word in any tongue!\r\nIn the distance clustered the offices of the Company and the Company\r\nstore, that most powerful tentacle of the giant octopus by which the\r\nCompany holds its operatives.\r\n\r\nI made my way down the narrow sidewalkless street, past the rows of\r\nmiserable huts with their reeking front yards filled with children in\r\nno less degree reeking, past that bane of all mining towns, the low\r\ndoggery, where for a few cents the miner buys the vilest of vile liquor,\r\non to the town proper. The contrast between the two was startling. The\r\nofficials must perforce reside where they collect their tithes, but\r\nthey strive to make life bearable. Every house was neatly painted and\r\nevery lawn set with trees and smoothly kept. I saw ill-clad women and\r\nlow-browed men black with the grime of the mine entering a large building\r\nwhich I rightly surmised to be the Company store. The offices were on the\r\nother side, and those who entered there did so with an air of the utmost\r\nservility, as though they fully expected to be kicked into the street.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful what an influence one’s surroundings will have upon their\r\ncharacter. Here I had been in Ardmore, only thirty minutes and I caught\r\nmyself approaching that office in the same servile manner affected by all\r\nwhom I saw enter there. I stood for some minutes hesitating before the\r\nportals where sat enthroned those who held my destiny in their hands.\r\nCold and hunger are grim and determined drivers, however, and both were\r\nflaying me with their whips. Summoning my manhood I entered, approached\r\nthe employment window and begged the right to earn my bread. The clerk\r\ngave me one keen look that swept me from head to foot and tersely\r\nassigned me to servitude in Mine 33, the one I had passed in the morning.\r\nHe handed me an order on the store that entitled me to a miner’s outfit\r\nto be paid for out of the first money earned. He also assigned me a\r\nnumber by which I was henceforth to be designated in all my dealings with\r\nthe Company. I became Number 337, and if I differed in any particular\r\nfrom the man bearing that same number in the Jefferson City penitentiary\r\nI was unable to detect that difference. True, I was permitted to walk the\r\nstreets unmolested, but the product of my toil belonged to the Kansas\r\nand Texas Coal Company. I felt relieved. I had passed from the ranks\r\nof the unemployed. Henceforth I was to be a sovereign American citizen\r\nenjoying, as such, the Constitutional right to earn my bread.\r\n\r\nI passed into the store and purchased such things as appeared needful,\r\nusing one of the miners as a model from which to deduce my needs. A\r\ncoarse pair of heavy shoes, ducking overalls and shirt, a pit cap with\r\nplace in front to carry the lamp, the lamp itself, a gallon of lard oil\r\nfor the same, a dinner-pail called a “deck” and the necessary picks and\r\nshovel about completed the outfit.\r\n\r\nOne of the clerks rather grudgingly answered my question regarding a\r\nboarding-place by informing me that there was a house on the hill that\r\nmade a practice of feeding miners. Carrying my bundle, I called at the\r\ndesignated house and secured board and lodging. The house was slightly\r\nbetter than those I had passed before and, standing upon higher ground,\r\nwas rather less filthy. I soon found that the miner is expected to do\r\nwithout all the luxuries and generally all the necessities of life. Water\r\nseemed the only article that could be obtained in plenty and for that I\r\nsoon had reason to be truly grateful. The table fare was of the coarsest\r\nand cheapest variety possible. It possessed the sole merit of sustaining\r\nlife, and that to me at the time overbalanced all other considerations.\r\nThe beds were arranged in rows in an upper room. Two people were expected\r\nto occupy one bed. I had assigned to be my bed-fellow a young Cornishman,\r\nand I suspect the landlady selected him for that position owing to the\r\nfact that he was slightly less dirty than her other boarders.\r\n\r\nThat evening my “buddy,” that is, the man who was to be my working\r\ncompanion, called to see me. He was a man of middle-age who had spent\r\nhis life in the mines. He had the pronounced stoop that I noticed in all\r\nthe miners and which I very soon acquired. His skin was of that sickly\r\nyellow hue characteristic of convicts and coal-miners, brought about by\r\nbeing shut out from the light of day. It seems that I drew a very lucky\r\nnumber in having this man assigned me for “buddy.” The other miners told\r\nme that he possessed a “machine.” That is, after years of toil in the\r\nmines he had been able to save enough to buy a drilling-machine that\r\nretails at the Company store for fourteen dollars. Wonderful fortune!\r\nAlmost a lifetime spent in labor, and all that he had to show for it was\r\na fourteen-dollar drilling-machine! We talked long into the evening and\r\nI found him not without ideas that were expressed in a crude way, but\r\nabove all, and, what was of vastly more importance to me just then, he\r\nwas a practical miner. I do not know what he might have thought about it,\r\nbut he had the tact not to hint anything about objecting to a green hand\r\nas “buddy.” Indeed, I suspect that the Company would hardly tolerate any\r\ncriticism of their actions in that regard.\r\n\r\nI appeared next morning clad in the habiliments of a coal-miner. My\r\n“deck” was filled and handed me and I followed the long line of stooping\r\nfigures headed for the mines. We paused at the mouth of the pit and\r\nlighted our lamps and swung them from the front of our caps. Then,\r\nstooping still lower, passed down the long incline that leads into the\r\ncoal vein. Soon the gloom surrounded us, and the flickering yellow-light\r\nfrom the burning lamp became our only guidance. Once upon the level of\r\nthe coal body, the air became oppressive and warm. Used as I had always\r\nbeen to the free air of the mountains, I paused and gasped for breath.\r\nI was merely one atom of the inward moving black stream and was pushed\r\nonward. I soon grew accustomed to the lack of oxygen and before many\r\ndays learned to exist upon a minimum supply of that article just as I\r\nlearned to exist upon a limited supply of many other articles that in my\r\nignorance I had considered essential.\r\n\r\nI neglected to state that I had been met at the pit mouth by my “buddy,”\r\nwho escorted me through the mazes of the underground streets of the\r\nmine to the Third West, which was the field of our future efforts for\r\nsome time to come. On the way in he conversed very cheerfully about the\r\ncondition of one of his children who was ill with pneumonia and not\r\nexpected to live the day through. I half suspect that he secretly hoped\r\nthat the Death Angel would come, and not only relieve the little one of\r\nher sufferings, but relieve him of one hungry mouth to feed.\r\n\r\nIt was over a mile from the surface to where our work lay. It consisted\r\nin “turning off a room”—that is, making an entrance into the bare face\r\nof the coal at right-angles to the direction of the tunnel. This was\r\nnecessarily slow work and we accomplished but little the first day.\r\nAll day long I sat upon my heels and picked a narrow trench from top\r\nto bottom into the resisting body of the coal. Long ere night came my\r\ncramped limbs refused to move another inch. I was simply racked from\r\nhead to foot with pain. There never was a more welcome sound than the\r\nsignal at the head of the entry to begin firing. Soon the boom of shots\r\nreverberated down the entry like the sound of cannonading, and the miners\r\nbegan straying out past us. We gathered up our tools and, placing them\r\nin a safe place, followed them. Ah, the blessed exhilaration of that air\r\nas I reached the surface! It was like being conveyed into another and\r\nbetter world. I glanced at my “buddy.” He had not changed one muscle of\r\nexpression. With dogged, shambling footsteps he was setting off toward\r\none of the miserable shacks.\r\n\r\nCuriously I watched the miners as they appeared. All nations seemed\r\ngathered there. Italians, Czechs, Russians, Finns, Hungarians, Slavs,\r\nCornishmen, Americans, yes and negroes. While the colored man was not\r\npermitted to become a miner in that particular mine, he was employed in\r\nvarious other capacities. I saw children of tender years going from work,\r\ntheir dinner-pails upon their arms, the stoop already in their shoulders,\r\nthe hectic flush already in their cheeks. “Merciful God,” I thought,\r\n“this greedy giant, not content with sucking the life-blood of men, must\r\nrob the school as well to sate its lust!” I learned afterward that there\r\nwas a child-labor law on the statute books of good old Missouri, but\r\nthat it was openly and flagrantly violated, and that the Commissioner of\r\nLabor was a party to the violation.\r\n\r\nI passed on homeward. Every step seemed weighted with lead. I dragged\r\nmyself up the long hill and entered the house. I was shown the wash-room\r\nand my particular washing-tub filled with steaming hot water. The room\r\nwas already filled with miners taking a bath. I stripped and found that\r\nthough I had been in the mine but a day my body was black with coal-dust.\r\nThe next half-hour I spent in trying to remove the grime, with but poor\r\nsuccess. The other miners finished their ablutions and departed. I was\r\nshocked at the manner in which the most of them performed that important\r\nduty. A dash of water on the head and neck, a wet towel over the body,\r\nrubbing off the most evident particles, a brisk scrubbing of the head,\r\nneck and ears, and they were ready for supper. I was so long at my bath\r\ntrying to accomplish the impossible that the landlady tapped on the\r\ndoor and informed me that supper only waited my appearance. I overheard\r\none of the miners designate me as “that new dude” when I entered the\r\ndining-room. To be cleanly, then, was considered among these sons of\r\ntoil as being a species of foppishness. (I soon learned to perform my\r\nablutions more scientifically, and remove a maximum amount of coal-dust\r\nin a minimum length of time.) I was too tired to eat, too weary to sleep.\r\nAll night long I tossed about in that comfortless bed and sighed for the\r\ncoming of morning. It came at last and dawned upon another day of labor.\r\n\r\nToday we drilled our first hole and placed the first shot. I had the\r\nsatisfaction of loading my first box of coal, affixing my leather tag to\r\nit and starting it on its journey toward the weighing office, thereby\r\nsatisfying a small part of the Company’s claim against me for the\r\nclothes I wore. My “buddy” had lost his child the night before, and this\r\nafternoon the little one was to be buried in the graveyard on the hill\r\nback of the town. He asked me, as though requesting a favor, whether he\r\nmight attend the funeral! Asked me, almost a stranger, whether he might\r\nattend the funeral of his own child! Heavens, what a system! My heart was\r\nso heavy that I could not work, but he seemed to take it all as a matter\r\nof course. In fact I detected a cheerful note in his voice as he informed\r\nme of the demise.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon I had nothing to do but carry the picks out to the\r\nblacksmith-shop to be sharpened, for which service we are to pay the\r\nsmith each a dollar per month. After they were prepared I returned with\r\nthem to the mine and employed the time in looking into the other rooms\r\nwhere the miners were at work. In almost every instance I found them\r\nidle. Inquiry revealed the fact that they were waiting for coal-boxes.\r\nThey had plenty of coal to load, but no boxes to load it in. The Company\r\nmakes it a practice to allow no man to get ahead. Once he falls into\r\ntheir grasp the idea is to keep him there. Even at thirty-five cents per\r\nlong ton, the price paid, the miner could make fair wages if he were\r\nfurnished boxes, but the Company does not intend that he shall make fair\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nOur room advanced rapidly now, and we always had coal ahead to load what\r\nboxes came to us, which were few enough. The most we ever got in any\r\none day was six, that is three for each of us, and could we succeed in\r\nplacing a ton in each one we would have made the munificent sum of $1.05.\r\nOut of that princely wage we were supposed to pay for board, lodging,\r\nhospital fees, blacksmith, and powder. By the way, there is the greatest\r\nsteal perpetrated by the coal companies. They furnish the miner with his\r\npowder at a cost to him of $2.50 per keg. Of course they do not say in\r\nso many words that he shall not buy his powder from other dealers at 90\r\ncents per keg, but if he does do that they see to it that his tenure in\r\nthe mine is very short, and they have divers ways of disposing of him\r\nwithout discharging him outright.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of mining soft coal. The method used in Mine 33\r\nwas what is known technically as “shooting off the solid,” that is,\r\ndrilling a deep hole in the solid coal body and blasting it down very\r\nmuch as rock is blasted in railroad building operations. This method,\r\nwhile it procures the greatest amount of coal with the least expenditure\r\nof labor, is at the same time very expensive to the miner who must buy\r\nhis powder and in addition to his regular blacksmith tax must pay for the\r\nsharpening of all the drill bits.\r\n\r\nIt is in these blasting operations that so many men in soft-coal mines\r\nlose their lives. The force of the blast loosening the coal at the same\r\ntime jars the slate roof of the mine. When the workman returns and starts\r\npicking down the standing column of “shot” coal the treacherous top gives\r\nway, and, like a deadfall, buries the unfortunate man beneath tons of\r\nslate. Then there are three bells signaled to the top and down comes\r\nthe padded car, if the man is not entirely dead, and he is carted away\r\nto the hut miscalled a hospital. The next day some of his friends are\r\naround with a paper and each miner is supposed to contribute a box of\r\ncoal to the relief of the injured miner. Should the accident, however,\r\nresult in the instant death of the man there is no such ceremony as\r\ncalling the padded car. He is simply dumped into an empty coal box and\r\nhauled to the surface with the next trip going out. Once there, his very\r\nexistence is forgotten in the mine and work goes on as before. The same\r\nformality regarding the gift of the box of coal is gone through with for\r\nthe benefit of his widow and orphans. In all my mining experience I never\r\nknew of a miner refusing to subscribe to a fund of this kind, though they\r\ncould ill afford to do so out of the scanty wage they were earning. You\r\nfeel inclined to do it, for you know not what instant you will yourself\r\nrequire like assistance.\r\n\r\nOne method employed by the Company in getting rid of an objectionable\r\nminer is so ingenuous in its simplicity that it deserves mention. They\r\nhave what is known as a sulphur bell. If a miner loads a lump of sulphur\r\ninto his box that is so large that he might be supposed to detect it the\r\nmen at the screens pull a rope that rings a bell in the weighing-office\r\nand the unfortunate miner has a check placed against his number. He\r\nnot only has that box of coal docked about half, but he gets a demerit\r\nas well. Three of these demerits results in his dismissal from the\r\nmine. Now, let us illustrate. In the first place, there is so much of\r\nthe sulphurous mineral scattered through the coal body that it is an\r\nabsolute impossibility to remove all of it down there in the half light\r\nof the underground world. There is hardly a box of coal that reaches the\r\nweighing scales that does not contain several pounds of the substance.\r\nThat some miners do place lumps of it in their boxes to increase the\r\nweight is perfectly true. A miner becomes objectionable to the powers\r\nthat be by reason of talking too much (for some of them _do_ think and\r\nexpress their thoughts to their fellows) and the powers that be decide\r\nto get rid of him. They could simply call him into the office and hand\r\nhim his time, but that is not the policy. The word is passed to the man\r\nat the bottom of the screens to “bell” Number so and so out. The Argus\r\neye of the man is upon every box of coal that comes sliding down the\r\nincline. He hears this man’s number called and detects a lump of sulphur\r\nsliding along with the descending coal. He reaches up, yanks the bell\r\nrope and that miner is one-third out of a job. It may take several days\r\nto complete the task, but Fate is no more certain than that it will be\r\ncompleted. Usually a miner who knows himself to be under the ban and sees\r\na sulphur check opposite his number takes the hint and calls for his\r\ntime. Wonderfully simple. Charmingly effective.\r\n\r\nAnother and equally effective method is that of slow starvation. The\r\nbanned miner finds that he is not getting an equal number of boxes\r\nwith his fellows. He complains to the driver and obtains but scant\r\nsatisfaction. Things go on until pay-day and he finds himself behind\r\nwith the company. He is questioned very closely as to the reason for this\r\nand solemnly warned not to allow it to occur again. Naturally it does\r\noccur again and he is forced to look elsewhere for work.\r\n\r\nThese instances are, however, comparatively rare. It is the policy of the\r\noctopus to hold securely every victim who falls into the slimy toils.\r\nOnly when a man has the courage to assert his manhood does he become\r\nobjectionable to the company. So complete is the system that there are\r\nfew such.\r\n\r\nIt does not require one skilled in the economics of the labor problem\r\nto point out the glaring evils of a coal-mining system. They are so\r\nevident that even he who runs may read. They are so patent that even the\r\ndull creatures who toil under them feel in a blank way that something\r\nis wrong. Just what, they cannot say. They realize that they are always\r\nhungry, always toiling and always in debt. There are three things that\r\nthe strong arm of the judiciary should suppress—child labor, peonage, and\r\nweight frauds.\r\n\r\nI have purposely placed child labor first, for it deserves the first\r\nplace. Children of very tender years are forced into the mines, where\r\nthey serve in various capacities, some of them even being utilized by\r\ntheir parents in the actual mining operations. This is done that the\r\nparent may obtain an extra supply of coal boxes by reason of his having a\r\n“buddy,” though the coal is all loaded out under his number. Principally,\r\nhowever, the little fellows are employed as “trappers,” to open and\r\nclose the immense valves that direct the air current down the various\r\nentries. All day long these infants stand in the noisome draft and swing\r\nback and forth those heavy doors. With the strong current of air pushing\r\nor pulling against these valves it is no light task for even a man to\r\nperform. Then the damp air, playing about the half clad figure, induces\r\ncolds, pneumonia and consumption. It is a rare thing to see one of these\r\nlittle “trappers” who is not coughing with some form of respiratory\r\ntrouble. The parents lie cheerfully regarding the child’s age, and the\r\nchild itself lies just as cheerfully. Poor creatures, they are hardly to\r\nbe blamed! The few pennies that are thus obtained help to keep the almost\r\nempty pot boiling at the squalid home.\r\n\r\nThe system of peonage is worse far than African slavery ever could have\r\nbeen. From year’s end to year’s end the miner never sees money. He is\r\npaid in coupon books good at the store for the necessities of life and\r\nthat is all he is expected to have, and precious few of them. In almost\r\nevery instance the Company has sold to the miner one of the miserable\r\nhouses, for which he is to pay a certain sum every month. The Company\r\nproudly boast that their miners own their own homes. The miner is given a\r\ncontract to be held in escrow (by the Company) whereby upon the payment\r\nof the purchase price he is to have a deed to the property. It is a very\r\nsignificant fact that there were only eighteen deeds on record in Macon\r\nCounty covering these properties. In other words, only eighteen miners\r\nactually owned their homes. It was never the intention of the Company to\r\nallow the miner to secure title to his “home.” If any considerable number\r\nof them showed symptoms of making good on the payments, the Company had\r\nmany ways of causing them to default and thus violate the ironclad terms\r\nof the contract.\r\n\r\nThe contention regarding weights is one of long standing. The miner is\r\nsupposed to mine a long ton of 2240 pounds. In reality he mines nearer\r\n3000 pounds. The scales are hidden from the view of the miner and the\r\nweigh boss cheerfully deducts from the weight of the miner’s box anything\r\nthat he sees fit and he usually sees fit to deduct about one fourth. This\r\nsystematic robbery is carried on all the time. Could the miner obtain\r\nwhat his labor actually produces, his condition would be less miserable.\r\nHe does not obtain it, however, and he seems powerless to bring about\r\nchange. Now we will return to my own personal experiences in the mine.\r\nOur room was a good one, save that the slate top was very treacherous\r\nand we took particular care to keep it well timbered. My “buddy” was a\r\nthorough miner and fully knew the virtue of propping the top perfectly.\r\nThe room had been driven up some sixty yards when the accident happened,\r\nthat brought home to me the dangers of mining.\r\n\r\nWe fired a fourteen-foot hole in the evening, before leaving the mine.\r\nThe next morning my “buddy” arrived before I did, and began loading the\r\nbox that was standing in the room. Upon my arrival I found the box half\r\nfilled, but my “buddy” nowhere in sight. A mass of slate had fallen and I\r\nknew instinctively that my “buddy” was beneath the mass. I called some of\r\nthe nearby miners and, after propping the top, we fell to work removing\r\nthe debris. First an arm showed; then the entire body was exposed to\r\nview. He had been instantly killed. I loaded the body into the half\r\nfilled box and accompanied it to the top. It became my duty to inform\r\nthe wife of the misfortune. She, poor woman, took the news stolidly,\r\nas though she had long expected it. Indeed, I think they grow to look\r\nforward to the time when the husband will be carried in, crushed out of\r\nall semblance to a human being. We buried him in the bleak graveyard on\r\nthe hill and, as his “buddy,” it became my duty to carry around the paper\r\nthat asked assistance for the widow. In her stolid way, I suppose, she\r\nwas grateful for the charity, but she never showed it by any emotion of\r\nthe face, taking the whole thing as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nIt had been a very wet Spring and the falling rain had completely\r\nsaturated the ground and, soaking through, had loosened the slate and\r\nsoapstone top until falls were of almost daily occurrence. As yet we had\r\nnot been visited with any that were disastrous in nature. A few tons of\r\nrock in some of the rooms, a miner killed or hurt, was about all. In\r\nJune, however, occurred the fall that imprisoned several hundred of the\r\nminers in the West entries for two days. Down toward the beginning of\r\nthe first West an old deserted room caved in, carrying with it the top\r\nabove the entry proper. For several days the miners had noted that the\r\nroom was “working,” that is, the top was pressing upon the props. This\r\nwas evidenced by the collection of fine flakes of slate that covered\r\nthe room and the entry when we entered the mine in the morning. With\r\ncharacteristic negligence the matter was passed up and nothing done but\r\nto remove the iron track from the room. One day I paused at the mouth\r\nof the room, attracted by a peculiar noise. At intervals there was a\r\nsound like the snapping of an overwrought violin string. I afterward\r\nlearned that the sound was produced by the bending props throwing off\r\nfine splinters. That evening when we passed out the props were snapping\r\nas they broke under the enormous pressure. A faraway rumbling was heard,\r\nlike wagons passing over a covered bridge. The room was certain to fall\r\nduring the night, the old miners said.\r\n\r\nIt did not, however, for it was still “working” the next morning.\r\nSometime during the forenoon I heard a sound as of distant artillery\r\nfire. Boom, boom, boom,—the sound came up the entry, causing a current of\r\nair to flare the lights hither and yon. This continued for an hour; then\r\nthe room caved. There was a crash of falling stone, a sound impossible\r\nto describe in any other words than terrible, a great gust of wind, and\r\nevery lamp in the entry was extinguished. We rushed down the entry to\r\nfind that all egress was shut off. The fall of the room had carried with\r\nit the entry as well, and we were prisoners behind thirty feet of solid\r\nrock. The pit boss instantly ordered every man to put out his light and\r\nlie down. Every cubic foot of air must now be conserved, for it would\r\nbe hours at least before the pipe could be driven in to supply fresh.\r\nThere we lay in the Stygian blackness in that foul atmosphere waiting the\r\nsignal from the relief party. Hours passed, and no signal from the other\r\nside. Every minute the air became more foul until at last we were panting\r\nfor breath, the sweat running from every pore. Then came the faint tap\r\nthat told us the rescue party was driving the pipe. Never a sound came\r\nwith such melody to my ears. It seemed an age before the steel-nosed pipe\r\nbroke through and a welcome rush of oxygen was forced in by the air-pump.\r\nThe pit boss signaled along the pipe that all was well. Then the work of\r\nrescue began. All day they picked out and carted away the fallen rock.\r\nAll night the work went on without ceasing. Another day and another night\r\nfollowed before they broke through the barrier, and we streamed out of\r\nthe mine, hungry, thirsty and weary from loss of sleep.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to realize that while in time I might become an\r\naccomplished coal-miner, my chances for living a long life to enjoy that\r\ntrade were exceedingly limited. I decided to sever my connection with the\r\nKansas and Texas Coal Company, fully realizing that the Company would not\r\nmourn much at my loss, and I had no intention of falling on its neck to\r\nweep at the parting.\r\n\r\nThe incident that crystallized my half-formed ideas into immediate action\r\ntook place in the room one day when I approached nearer the swift current\r\nof the Dark River than I cared to do. By accident the driver shoved a\r\nbox into our room (by this time I had a new “buddy”) and we had no coal\r\nwith which to load it. A box was so valuable that we could not afford to\r\nallow it to be taken out unloaded, so we cast about for sufficient coal\r\nfor the purpose. Sometime since we had shot a small blast on the pillar\r\nand the pit boss, coming in, had ordered us to let it stand as we were\r\ntoo far to the south. This shot was still standing. The coal was loose\r\nand needed only to be mined off for us to have sufficient coal to load\r\nout the box. That duty devolved upon me, and I shoved the box back and\r\nbegan mining off the shot. In a short time I had it all cut round save\r\na small portion that I could not reach with the pick. I returned to the\r\n“face” and procured a long chum drill and with it began to cut down the\r\nstanding coal. I was seated tailor-like upon the floor, my legs doubled\r\nunder me. When the coal mass gave way it rolled toward me and pressing\r\nthe drill across my body pinioned me beneath it. I felt no danger, for my\r\n“buddy” could soon extricate me from the position. I called to him and\r\nhe started in my direction. As he did so I glanced up and was horrified\r\nto see several yards of the slate top easing downward. Frantically I\r\ngrasped the drill that was binding me down and gave it a wrench. It gave\r\nand another wrench broke it in twain. To flop over and crawl on my hands\r\nand knees out of the way of danger was only the work of an instant. As\r\nI did so the great slab fell, tearing off my shoe soles as though they\r\nwere but paper. I owe my life to the fact that the top did not give way\r\ninstantly, but broke gradually. So thoroughly frightened was I that I sat\r\nin a stupor for some time. When I had sufficiently recovered to be able\r\nto walk I made my way out of the mine, went to my boarding place, removed\r\nmy pit garments and bade Ardmore a lasting and affectionate farewell.\r\n\r\nI have torn a few soiled and tattered leaves from my book of life and\r\nhave here given them to you. That the story is not well told I fully\r\nrealize.

MORGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOSE THAT ARE JOINED TOGETHER\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES FORT]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are standing on an Eighth Avenue corner, looking down a side street\r\ntoward the ugly black streak made by the Ninth Avenue elevated railroad.\r\nYou see peddlers, right hands curving at the sides of their mouths, left\r\nhands holding pails of potatoes; a woman with a basket of wash, which\r\nis tucked under a sheet; many fire escapes that look like a jumbling of\r\ngiant gridirons, when seen from the corner. You notice the signs over\r\ndoorways: a gilded boot; a carpenter’s sign projecting a little farther;\r\nglazier’s sign, of stained-glass squares trying to eclipse signs of\r\nshoemaker and carpenter; tailor’s sign almost obscuring all of them.\r\nIn the tailor-shop windows are prints of the latest fashions, labeled,\r\n“Types of American Gents.” American gents, going to work, in overalls and\r\nsweaters, pause to enjoy the very latest in riding, golf, and hunting\r\ncostumes, and perhaps go in to order a three-dollar pair of breeches.\r\nThe tailor shop occupies the first floor of a three-story frame house—a\r\ngrimy-looking house; its grimy clapboards are stained by streaks of rain\r\ndripping from the rusty fire-escape.\r\n\r\nThe McGibneys lived in the second-floor rooms. McGibney was log-shaped;\r\nhe seemed as big around at his ankles as at his chest, and, though\r\nhe wore collars, it was because everyone else wore collars, and not\r\nbecause his neck was perceptible. Close-cropped hair, a rather sharp\r\nnose, bright, alert eyes, cheeks red and all other visible parts of him\r\npinkish. Mrs. McGibney was a plump, delicately featured little woman,\r\nwho could express most amazing firmness upon her small features. When\r\nshe had household cares, she worried; when she had household duties, she\r\nbustled. And it would surely please you to look at Mrs. McGibney when\r\nshe worried; left forefinger beginning over the fingers of the right\r\nhand; left forefinger lodging on right little finger, Mrs. McGibney\r\npausing to look into space, counting up to assure herself that the\r\nbutcher had not cheated; forefinger beginning again and dealing with the\r\ngrocer, this time; another fixed look into space to be sure the grocer\r\nhad not imagined a can of tomatoes or a pound of flour. It would please\r\nyou, because you would know that not one penny, worked so hard for by\r\nMcGibney, would be wasted. When Mrs. McGibney bustles—ah, now that is\r\npretty! That means a very keen sense of responsibility, nothing shirked,\r\nnothing that will make McGibney’s comfort neglected. Bustling to the oven\r\ndoor, opening and shutting it; fingers dabbing at under lip and sizzling\r\non under side of a flat iron; frying-pan moved back on the stove; quick,\r\nshort steps to the table to roll out breadcrumbs; dash to a window to\r\nsharpen a knife on the sill—when Mrs. McGibney bustles!\r\n\r\nEvening! Both of them in the cheerful kitchen. Very cheerful kitchen!\r\nThree conch-shells, like big pink ears, up on the mantelpiece, and four\r\npalm leaves, painted green, stuck in a flower pot, just like a bit of\r\nFlorida. The dish-pan, on the stove murmuring; a subdued rattle and\r\ngood-natured growling of bubbles forming on the bottom of the pan, and\r\ndishes fluttering on them. The oil-cloth was bright and new-looking,\r\nexcept in the corner where heavy McGibney sat. There, chair legs had\r\nindented as if someone had beaten around at random with a hammer. And in\r\nhis corner, reading the newspaper, sat McGibney, his wife sitting beside\r\nthe table his elbow was on, frowning, puzzling, and counting her fingers.\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. McGibney, “I can keep expenses down to five dollars a\r\nweek, but you mustn’t charge on my book what you spend. I don’t think I\r\nought to mark down the cent for your newspaper, do you? I’m not going to\r\nhave my book any more than it’s got to be. I’ll cross off this two cents\r\nfor a stamp. Now, you know you oughtn’t to charge me for that; it was for\r\nyour own letter—don’t sit like that! How often have I told you you ruin\r\nthe oil-cloth?”\r\n\r\nMcGibney not only continued to tilt back and dig into the oil-cloth but\r\nrocked himself on the hind legs of the chair; one is sometimes tempted to\r\ntorment severe little women when they are too serious.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t care; you’re not harming me. Go ahead, if you feel like\r\npaying for new oil-cloth.” McGibney could not sit straight without some\r\ndemonstration to cover his accession; he put out fingers like tongs and\r\npinched just above her knee. If you are an old married man, you know just\r\nhow far from dignified and severe that immediately made McGibney. Then\r\nMcGibney sat straight, sat as if he would have sat straight anyway.\r\n\r\nA rap on the door. Mrs. McGibney put away her account book as if it were\r\nwrong to keep account-books; McGibney sat crooked as if it were wrong\r\nto sit straight. No matter what one is doing, one feels that someone\r\nelse coming makes a difference. Mrs. McGibney started toward the door,\r\nwent to the stove instead, and covered the dish-pan; started again but\r\npaused to twitch a curtain; finally got to the door and opened it, but\r\nhad glanced back twice and had motioned to McGibney to put away a bag of\r\ncrackers.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s you, Clara?” exclaimed Mrs. McGibney. “Why, come right in!”\r\n\r\nInto the room came a stocky person, with a broad, flat, amiable face.\r\nEverything about her seemed to suggest that she was made to work hard\r\nand suffer, usually not complain, but, quite without reasoning, flash\r\ninto short-lived rebellion against hardships now and then. Like your\r\nimpression of peasantry more than a century ago, down-trodden, without\r\nleaders, should be your impression of Clara. In her heavy arms was a huge\r\nbundle, done up in a sheet, four corners of the sheet hanging loose at\r\ntop. She appeared to be carrying a monstrous turnip, all white, loose\r\nends like white turnip-tops.\r\n\r\n“Why, good evening!” said Clara awkwardly, turning to the right, turning\r\nto the left, with her huge bundle, looking for a place to set it down,\r\nbut still clinging to it, her chin buried in the top of it, the big\r\nbundle making her look like a pouter-pigeon.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. McGibney,” said Clara, turning to the right, to the left, still\r\nclinging, “I don’t like to ask you, knowing you ain’t got accommodations,\r\nbut could you lend me the loan of your ironing-board for the night? I’ve\r\nflew the coop on him for good and all this time, and tomorrow will get a\r\nroom for myself; but, if you can let me have your ironing-board, I can\r\nsleep on it here, on the floor tonight. This is my wash, which I brought\r\nwith me, not to leave him so much as a stitch that’s mine. Would it be\r\ntoo much to ask for your ironing-board?”\r\n\r\n“Why, put down that heavy bundle, Clara!” cried Mrs. McGibney, having\r\ndabbed at the bundle, but missed it; “it’s sopping wet!”\r\n\r\n“Sopping wet!” repeated Mrs. McGibney, as if pleased. And she was\r\npleased, for here was an occasion for her to bustle around the room.\r\nVery much did Mrs. McGibney like to bustle around a room. And Clara, by\r\nthe door, sat at the table at the other end of which McGibney sat.\r\n\r\n“It’s wet because I just took it in off the line, not to leave him\r\nanything of mine,” said Clara. She moved uneasily in her chair. And she\r\nwinked, as if in physical distress.\r\n\r\n“I can’t move my line, because the rain’s made it too tight,” said Mrs.\r\nMcGibney, “but we can hang up the wash here to dry. Ironing-board?\r\nIroning-board, how are you!” She pounced upon the huge turnip, seizing\r\nturnip-tops, plucking them apart. “No, but we can make you comfortable\r\nin the front room, Clara.” Sheet spread out and wash in a mound. “And\r\nyou’ve carried this with you all the way through the streets? I’ll fix up\r\nlines.” Two parallel lines, rigged up one from each end of the table to\r\nthe opposite wall, sheets thrown over them; kitchen looking like Monday\r\nmorning in your back yard. Room divided into three compartments: Clara\r\nin one, by the door; middle one, including the table, reserved for Mrs.\r\nMcGibney; McGibney isolated in the third. Mrs. McGibney hung wash on the\r\nbacks of chairs, and, forgetting how picture frames collect dust, jumped\r\nup at comers of picture frames, with more wash. Then she returned to her\r\nchair, which was in the middle compartment.\r\n\r\n“Not bothering you too much,” began timid Clara. An expression of pain\r\nsuddenly shot across her broad face. “Oh,” she breathed, “I guess that\r\nmust be the tintypes! Anyway, don’t bother about me. Oh! yes, I’m sure\r\nit’s the tintypes. Tintypes has such sharp corners, even if there is pink\r\npaper frames to them. I had nowhere else to carry my belongings, which\r\nI’d not leave behind, as I have flew the coop on him.”\r\n\r\nClara stuck one foot out and lifted her skirt somewhat. Untied a\r\nhandkerchief from somewhere, though I have heard that the material is\r\nusually more elastic—never mind; in a most matter-of-fact way, Clara\r\nuntied the handkerchief. As if it were the most natural thing in the\r\nworld to do, and very serious about it, she delved and drew forth an\r\nalarm clock, a comb, shoe-strings, a looking-glass, a tea-strainer, a box\r\nof matches, the tintypes——\r\n\r\n“It was the tintypes!” cried Clara. “I knew, because they got such sharp\r\ncorners and was sticking me, all the way over, most every step I took.”\r\n\r\nMrs. McGibney and McGibney, who drew his sheet aside, stared at the\r\nastonishing collection on the table and then laughed heartily. Clara,\r\nlooking calm and unintelligent, drew forth a can of baking powder.\r\nNothing to laugh at could she see, but the others seemed amused, so she\r\nsmiled sympathetically with them.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Clara, no longer timid, for it was her way to be awkward at\r\nfirst and then feel as much at home as anybody, “I’ve flew the coop on\r\nhim forever. I’ve said I meant it before, but this time I do mean it.\r\nAnd he can be so nice when he wants to be. You know that yourself, Mrs.\r\nMcGibney.”\r\n\r\n“He always seemed a perfect little gentleman whenever I saw him,”\r\ndeclared Mrs. McGibney.\r\n\r\n“It’s a shame you two can’t get along better!” was heard from behind\r\nMcGibney’s sheet. “I’ve always found Tommy all right.”\r\n\r\nAnd Clara exclaimed: “He’s the nicest little man in the world! This time\r\nI have flew the coop on him forever.” She smiled at her sheet, so that no\r\none within hearing should be depressed, just because she had troubles.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know!” said Clara, with her broad, slow smile, “it’s pretty hard\r\nfor a woman to come home from her day’s work, and find the man stretched\r\non the floor before her sleeping it off. Isn’t it?” she asked, as if by\r\nno means sure and wishing to hear what others thought.\r\n\r\nFrom behind two sheets:\r\n\r\n“It certainly is hard!”\r\n\r\nRumbling up over McGibney’s sheet:\r\n\r\n“You hadn’t ought to put up with it! It is hard!”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t it!” cried Clara, as if crying. “There, I was right, after all!\r\nI thought, myself, it was hard, and here’s others thinks the same. And\r\nthen, when you’re getting along nice, both working and laying by a\r\nlittle, and going to buy the brass lamp in Mason’s window, and get a\r\nwhole half-ton of coal instead of by the bag, which is robbery, and then\r\nhe goes out to change the savings into one big bill which you’d never be\r\ntempted to break, and comes back in the morning without one cent—” Clara\r\npaused. She would not like to be ridiculed for regarding trifles too\r\nseriously. “I don’t think he does right by me—does he?”\r\n\r\nBoth sheets agitated. Over both sheets:\r\n\r\n“He certainly don’t do right by you!”\r\n\r\n“Does he!” cried Clara, almost excited, also triumphant, hearing her own\r\nsuspicions verified.\r\n\r\n“He oughter be ashamed of hisself!” rumbled McGibney.\r\n\r\nClara looked up, and there was a slow heavy frown, instead of the slow\r\nheavy smile.\r\n\r\n“There’s worse than him!” she said sharply.\r\n\r\n“I’ll never speak to him again!” declared Mrs. McGibney.\r\n\r\n“You might speak to worse, Mrs. McGibney. I’m sure he always spoke most\r\nkind of you——”\r\n\r\n“How could he speak otherwise of me?” demanded Mrs. McGibney in quick\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n“Now! now! now!” rumbled McGibney, thrusting his sheet aside and looking\r\nwarningly at his wife.\r\n\r\n“Not making you a sharp answer, Mrs. McGibney,” pursued thick, slow,\r\nheavy Clara, “he never said nothing but kind words of you. There’s lots\r\nworse than him and he was always a good husband to me, excepting when he\r\nwas bad, and I hope I’ll never lay my two eyes onto him again.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. McGibney looked at the McGibney sheet as if to say, “You’d best\r\nalways keep quiet!” and her resentment was over, for she was fond of\r\nClara and had known her many years.\r\n\r\n“I’ll get a pint of beer,” said McGibney. “Can I leave youse two without\r\nthere being a clinch? You like a little ale in it, don’t you, Clara?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t never mind me!” said Clara restlessly. “I just remember I left the\r\ngas burning and him sleeping his buns off. Do you think the gas would\r\ngo out and then start up again and not burning? I’ve heard tell of such\r\ncases. Not meaning to go back to him, maybe I’d better go back and turn\r\nthe gas out.”\r\n\r\n“Do go back, Clara!” urged Mrs. McGibney, feeling through the sheet for\r\nClara’s hand and impulsively seizing Clara’s nose, trying again for the\r\nhand, closing fingers upon Clara’s ear, Clara leaning over, with head\r\nnear her knees, “Give him another chance. A wife’s place is at home.\r\nDon’t mind what others tell you—your husband is dearer to you than all\r\nthe rest of the world. Go back and make him promise to do better.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wish him no harm,” said Clara, hesitatingly. “This time I’ve\r\nflew the coop on him forever, even if he is the nicest little man in the\r\nworld when he has a mind to be—if I thought the gas would go out on him,\r\nI might go back and turn down the gas, anyway.”\r\n\r\nOh, then, here was a fine chance for Mrs. McGibney to bustle. Down came\r\neverything on the lines, as if it were Monday night in the back yard.\r\nDown came everything from the backs of chairs and from picture frames.\r\nBack into a bundle with everything! Big white turnip again, loose,\r\nsprawling turnip-tops.\r\n\r\n“I might try him again for a week, anyway,” decided Clara. Out and\r\naway and back home with her big white, turnip and its pouter-pigeon\r\neffect, too bulky for her arms to go around, her chin lost in fluttering\r\nturnip-tops; back home with bundle, alarm clock, looking-glass, box of\r\nbaking-powder and tintypes taken one almost impossibly happy day at Coney\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nAn evening or two later. McGibney out for a walk. Mrs. McGibney up to\r\nher elbows in the washing that had driven him out, for if he had remained\r\nin he would have had to carry boilers of water to the stove from the sink\r\nin the hall. So McGibney had said, “Marietta, I ain’t getting fresh air\r\nenough. I don’t sleep good unless I take a little walk in the evening.”\r\nMrs. McGibney had to fill the boiler one dishpanful at a time and that\r\nwas satisfactory to McGibney.\r\n\r\nRap on the door. Mrs. McGibney quickly concealed socks with holes in them\r\nand turned to the door. Vain little Mrs. McGibney! She paused to rummage\r\nthrough the wash until she found curtains. They were very fine lace\r\ncurtains. The very fine curtains were placed where a caller would surely\r\nsee them and note how very fine they were. Then Mrs. McGibney’s hand did\r\naround and around on the door knob, hand slippery with soap-suds, until\r\nthe slipperiness wore off and she could open the door. She exclaimed:\r\n“Why, Tommy! come right in.” The “nicest little man in the world” was an\r\nuneasy, squirming, twisting, little man; bald-headed; Hebraic nose like\r\na number six inclining at forty-five degrees; chin with a dimple looking\r\nlike a bit gouged out of it; very neat; fussy. And a very polite little\r\nman, scraping, bowing, grinning.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Tommy. You won’t have much room to stir. The old man is out,\r\nbut will be back almost any minute. Sit down, but first I’ll trouble you\r\nto fill the boiler for me, if you don’t mind. How is Clara?”\r\n\r\nTommy seemed to scrape and bow to the boiler, before lifting it, seemed\r\nto scrape with his right foot and bow to the wash-tub as he passed it and\r\nwent scraping and bowing down to the sink, filled the boiler, came back\r\nwith it, set it on the stove and stood grinning, prepared to scrape and\r\nbow, if given half a chance to, until invited again to sit down.\r\n\r\n“My!” said Mrs. McGibney, “the wash does gather on one so!”\r\n\r\nTommy opened his eyes wide and wrinkled his forehead to express\r\nprofoundest sympathy. Not only with eyes and forehead, but with elbows,\r\nfeet, knees and hands, it was his way to show how very attentively he\r\nlistened to anyone speaking to him; ready to laugh heartily at anything\r\nhe might be expected to smile at; equally ready to commiserate with\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\n“Are you feeling pretty well?”—soap dabbed on a McGibney shirt. “How\r\nis—” laundry-brush up and down where the soap was, which was at elbows;\r\nMcGibney _would_ lean on elbows. “Clara? Is she—” up and down with the\r\nshirt on the wash-board—“feeling pretty—” wringing out and dropping shirt\r\non pile, on a newspaper, “well?” Pile too high and toppling over, top\r\npieces falling on the floor outside the newspaper. Not a speck on them,\r\nbut rubbing over for them, anyway.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, ma’am; Clara is very well. I have left her.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve what? You’ve left her?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, ma’am!” said Tommy, head bobbing, shoulders, arms, knees, all\r\nof him bobbing. “I called to see would you keep these tintypes for me?\r\nI’m going to Maddy-gascar, where I hear there’s openings.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Tommy, what’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“She don’t keep the house picked up—not saying a word against her,”\r\nanswered Tommy. “These tintypes is mine, and she can have everything\r\nelse; but these is mine, and it was my money paid for them down to Coney\r\nIsland, me and her in them, and all I got in the world I care about, and\r\nwill you keep them for me till I can send for them from Maddy-gascar?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course I’ll do that, Tommy; but you know you’d never do such a\r\nthing as leave Clara. That would be very wrong of you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, indeed, ma’am, very wrong of me! Not saying one word against\r\nher, she lies in bed all day and won’t so much as do any sweeping.\r\nThere’s never any cooking, and I’m tired to death of the delicatessens\r\nand rather go to Maddy-gascar and eat spiders, me going in the spider-web\r\nindustry there. She don’t do no wash like you, Mrs. McGibney, but just\r\nrinses out in cold water. She’s so lazy she washes dishes by rubbing\r\nnewspapers on them. That ain’t so bad as when she does wash them; she\r\nwashes clothes in the dish-pan and then washes dishes after them—not that\r\nI’d say one word against her. So, will you mind the tintypes with her and\r\nme in them, ma’am? They’re all I have to care about, ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, now Tommy—” But how could one possibly argue with Tommy? With eyes\r\nand forehead and elbows and knees, he would most emphatically agree with\r\neverything said to him.\r\n\r\n“Your wife is a very good woman.”\r\n\r\nOf course she was! Best in the city! Best in the whole world! But would\r\nMrs. McGibney care for the tintypes?\r\n\r\n“It’s very wrong of you, Tommy!”\r\n\r\nWrong? Shocking! Heartless! Wicked, shocking, heartless Tommy! Of course\r\nhe was, and he admitted every word of it; but would Mrs. McGibney take\r\ncare of the tintypes until he could send from “Maddy-gascar” for them?\r\n\r\nTommy left the tintypes on the mantelpiece, hoping he was disturbing\r\nnothing by so doing; imploring Mrs. McGibney not to bother with them\r\nif she thought they would take up too much room, begging her to throw\r\nthem in the ashes or burn them, or jump on them if they should be the\r\nslightest annoyance to her; then he went away.\r\n\r\nBack in five minutes. Well, after all, “Maddy-gascar” was pretty far away\r\nand he had heard stories about the Esquimaux there, so he would take the\r\ntintypes back with him; Clara might wonder where they were. Five minutes\r\nlater. Back again. Perhaps Mrs. McGibney had better not say anything to\r\nanyone about the tintype matter. Bowing, bobbing, scraping.\r\n\r\nOh, not a word would Mrs. McGibney say! Rest assured of that! Indeed, she\r\nhad quite enough to do in attending to her own affairs. Mrs. McGibney\r\npromised to say nothing, and like a busy little housewife with too much\r\nto do to waste time gossiping, breathed not a word of it till McGibney\r\ncame in.\r\n\r\n“It’s all Tommy’s fault!” said McGibney.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid Clara is a good deal to blame,” said Mrs. McGibney.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, always stand up for the man, of course!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, take the woman’s part every time, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nThe next time the McGibneys saw Clara, there was no persuading her to go\r\nhome. She had no home.\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Clara, “when we found there wasn’t no use in our trying\r\nto get along together, we just broke up and gave away everything in the\r\nrooms and went down the stairs and down the stoop together. We didn’t so\r\nmuch as say good-bye nor nothing; he went up the street and I went down.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right!” declared McGibney, “when two people can’t get along\r\ntogether, it’s best for them to part, I say!”\r\n\r\n“You say!” cried indignant Mrs. McGibney. And scornful Mrs. McGibney!\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m entitled to speak, ain’t I?” grumbled McGibney.\r\n\r\n“No!” firmly. “Leastwise, not when you talk like that.” She looked her\r\nscorn and continued:\r\n\r\n“No, Clara, there’s nobody dearer to any woman than her own husband.”\r\nLooked at McGibney as if he were a pile of wash just toppled over into\r\nthe ash-pan. “Your husband will be with you when others are far away.”\r\nLooked at him as if he were two piles of wash toppled over into three\r\nash-pans. “There ain’t any luck in any such advice as he’s giving you.\r\nI know how I love my own dear husband, and you know you’re the same,\r\nand you’ll find what the world is when you’re alone in it.” Glared her\r\nindignation, scorn, contempt for McGibney, who mumbled, with an air of\r\nsagacity, astonishing to himself:\r\n\r\n“Ain’t wimmen the queer things, though!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve flew the coop on him forever!” said Clara, with her broad, amiable,\r\nunintelligent smile. “I got a little hall room for myself, and—me go back\r\nto him? Oh, my! is that a step on the stairs? I wouldn’t wish it, not for\r\nthe world, for him to find me here! I never want to see the face of him\r\nagain!” Clara looked around for a place to hide; ran to the door of the\r\nfront room, and, with her hand on the knob, stood listening.\r\n\r\n“’Tain’t him! It’s someone going upstairs,” she said, smiling her relief.\r\n“I’ll never go back to him.”\r\n\r\nA week later. Clara again. And Clara was out of breath.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mrs. McGibney, has the man come yet? I thought I saw him over on\r\nNinth Avenue, and I run clear around the block for fear he’d be after\r\nme and track me here. I was just buying a bit of furniture and going to\r\nstart rooms for myself, when I get a few bits together. And is it too\r\nmuch to ask you to store them for me till I get rooms, Mrs. McGibney?”\r\n\r\n“We’re only too glad—” began Mrs. McGibney.\r\n\r\n“Oh, on your life, don’t stir! It’s him! He mustn’t know where I am,\r\nor he might try to get me back! I don’t never want to see him again!”\r\nwhispered Clara. “On your life, not giving no orders, don’t stir, or\r\nhe’ll know you’re in and see me here.”\r\n\r\nThere was a rap on the door.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my! Look out—would he hear us?”\r\n\r\nOut in the hall:\r\n\r\n“McGibney! Anyone know where McGibney lives?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” breathed Clara, “that’s all right. It’s the furniture men.”\r\n\r\nAnd two men from a Ninth Avenue furniture store came in with a bureau.\r\nAt least they set it in the hall, and turned to hasten down the stairs;\r\npaused to do little better than that, and rolled the bureau half way into\r\nthe room; turned to run back to the store, but, in turning, thrust back\r\nwith their heels, and pushed the bureau quite into the room, which was\r\nconscientious enough delivering of goods to suit anybody.\r\n\r\n“I bought that!” said Clara, proudly. The bureau was rolled into the\r\nfront room, and she helped, her hands caressing more than pushing. There\r\nwas no back to the bureau. The varnish was worn off. Some one had broken\r\nopen the top drawer, splintering the wood on each side of the keyhole.\r\n\r\n“It’s mine!” said Clara rapturously. “It took three days of hard\r\nscrubbing on hands and knees, for me to buy that. It’ll be every bit\r\nas good as new, with a few boards nailed on the back, and a little oil\r\nrubbed over it.”\r\n\r\nThe bureau was rolled to a corner of the front room, but Clara could not\r\nleave it, hovering over it, stooping and pulling out drawers, one by one,\r\ngazing delightedly at the disgraceful old wreck.\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Clara. “The other day when I was scrubbing the restaurant\r\nfloor, there was customers looking at me, and they says, ‘Look at that\r\npoor woman! Ain’t some got hard lots in life!’ They needn’t of pitied me!\r\nI was earning that! Just a few boards and a little oil is all it needs,\r\nand I’ll get as fine a home together as anybody’s got—what’s that?”\r\n\r\nClara ran to the kitchen to listen.\r\n\r\n“I’m so afraid he’ll find me that I do be hearing sounds all the time!”\r\nshe said. “Ain’t that bureau something elegant? I’ll have my own bit of a\r\nhome and never see him again.” Then, as McGibney came out to the kitchen,\r\nshutting the front-room door behind him, she asked;\r\n\r\n“Ain’t that sounds of excitement in the street? Maybe there’s a fire!”\r\nClara ran to the front room and pretended to look out the window. She had\r\nheard nothing; it was only a pretext to get back to the disgraceful old\r\nwreck. On her own hands and knees she had earned it.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t it nice!” said Clara, ecstatically. “I got my eye on a gilt-framed\r\nmirror I’ll buy next week. It’s nice, ain’t it?”\r\n\r\nClara went away. Back in five minutes.\r\n\r\n“I guess maybe I left my rolled-up apron in the front room.” Whether she\r\nhad or not, she stood looking at the bureau; turned to go; looked again;\r\nmoved it to get a better light on it; stepped toward the door; paused\r\nand looked back.\r\n\r\n“I bought that!”\r\n\r\nAnd she went away, leaving McGibney standing in the front room. With an\r\nexpression of deep melancholy he stood looking at the clumsy, broken\r\nbureau. He looked at his best furniture surrounding it—fragile, gilded\r\nchairs, on a big rug better than any other rug in the neighborhood—a\r\nsideboard with French plate glass in it; the very fine curtains. He was\r\na log-shaped man, and not remarkably æsthetic, but his eye was sorely\r\noffended.\r\n\r\n“Oh, well,” said the melancholy, log-shaped man, “if us poor folks\r\ndon’t help each other, who will?” And the eye of Mrs. McGibney was\r\nequally offended; but Mrs. McGibney was not melancholy, for here was an\r\nopportunity for her to bustle. Out with the sofa and around in front\r\nof the bureau! The standing lamp placed where it would help to conceal\r\nthe bureau. To hide the bureau was quite a problem, but Mrs. McGibney\r\nrejoiced in it. She bustled.\r\n\r\nThe next Saturday night Clara bought a wicker rocking-chair.\r\nFearful-looking old rocking-chair! Interstices of it filled with white\r\npaint; all paint worn off wherever arms, legs, and backs had rested on it.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice, ain’t it?” said Clara, dreamily, fondly.\r\n\r\nMcGibney sat straight, as if he had just dug through the oil-cloth and\r\nfeared reprimanding. Then he fell back limply.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ve-ry,” he said, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“It’ll fill out your front room nice, while I’m waiting for it, won’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, ye-es; it’ll be ve-ry nice.”\r\n\r\n“And so comfortable!” said Clara. She sat in the chair and clumsily\r\nrocked it. “Try it, Mrs. McGibney! You ain’t got no idea how comfortable\r\nit is. You sit in it, Mr. McGibney. Just lie back and push with your feet\r\nand see what a comfort it is. My! I can just see myself in it, me with my\r\nshoes off and resting after the day. Such comfort in it! I don’t guess I\r\never made such a bargain before. But what do you think? That mirror I was\r\nso set on was bought! That’s mean, ain’t it? I was awful provoked when\r\nI heard it. Just the same, I got my eye on a stove that’s fine and well\r\nworth the four dollars they ask for it. It’s all nickel in front, and\r\nonly one of the bricks broken, and can be fixed with five cents’ worth of\r\nfire-clay. It’ll look nice in your front room, won’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Ve-ry nice!” answered distressed McGibney.\r\n\r\nClara got up to go. Had to sink back and take another rock in the chair,\r\nso comfortable after the day’s work, and one’s shoes off. It was indeed\r\nworth scrubbing for! Up to go. Well, just one more rock—away back and\r\nslowly down again, you know. And you, too, look again at it! My! but what\r\na bargain! And Clara bought it! On her own hands and knees she had earned\r\nit. Before going away, Clara lingered at the door. Perhaps they would\r\nlaugh at her if she should take another rock, but she might look at the\r\nchair for another moment.\r\n\r\n“Ain’t this pretty oil-cloth you got!” Looking only at the chair.\r\n\r\n“I must get a kitchen table like yours.” Looking only at her own\r\nrocking-chair. She left McGibney staring gloomily, but saying, sturdily:\r\n\r\n“Us poor folks must help each other!”\r\n\r\nMrs. McGibney bustled.\r\n\r\nIt was a different Clara when seen again. Her face was flushed; the\r\nunintelligent but soft eyes were like eyes that could not see outward\r\nthings, as if they were engaged in the unusual occupation of looking\r\nwithin at her own mind. Convince Clara that she had a grievance, and\r\nthick, obstinate brooding replaced uncomplaining stolidity.\r\n\r\nBy force of habit, Clara’s slow, amiable smile flickered, but her eyes\r\nwere as if turned upon brooding within.\r\n\r\n“Someone’s did that a-purpose!” said Clara, slowly, deliberately,\r\nstaring, seeming to see neither McGibney nor Mrs. McGibney. “Me that\r\nthought I didn’t have a enemy in the world! Where would I get a enemy,\r\nme always kind to everybody? I had my heart set on that stove that only\r\nneeded a little fire-clay. Someone’s bought it, just to annoy me. When\r\nthe mirror went, I didn’t think nothing of it, but the stove too, is to\r\nannoy me. They won’t make nothing by that, and bad luck will come upon\r\nthem for it.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Clara, it only happened that way,” reasoned Mrs. McGibney. “Nobody\r\nwould go and be as mean as that to you, specially as they’d have to spend\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“It’s tricks done me!” declared sullen, dogged Clara. “Oh, there’s\r\nsomebody at the door. Maybe it’s him after me. Say I’m not here, Mrs.\r\nMcGibney! On your life, don’t let him find me! I got to work for my\r\nliving, anyway, and I’ll work for myself and not divide with no man.\r\nNever—oh, I guess it’s the kitchen table!”\r\n\r\n“A kitchen table, Clara?” demanded McGibney. “Did you say a kitchen\r\ntable?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Clara, brightening. “It’s nice! You can put it in the centre\r\nof your front room and maybe have ornaments onto it. It’s a very nice\r\nkitchen table.”\r\n\r\nDoor opened; a table thrust into the room; heels flying down the stairs.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you think it’s nice?” Clara asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Nice?” repeated honest McGibney. “Oh, is that the table?”\r\n\r\nScratched legs to it; two plain boards forming the top of it; heads of\r\nnails sunk in the boards, and once filled with putty; putty fallen out.\r\n\r\nClara shook it to show that the legs were firm. She would varnish\r\nit and cover it with a beautiful table cover she had seen in the\r\nfive-and-ten-cent store, though there was one just as good in the\r\nthree-and-nine-cent store.\r\n\r\n“Next week,” said brightened Clara, “it’s going to be portcheers.\r\nThey’re chenille and grand for a doorway. No room ain’t complete without\r\nportcheers.” She again shook the table to show how firm the legs were and\r\nthen went away.\r\n\r\nMcGibney and Mrs. McGibney stood out on the front stoop of the\r\nrust-stained frame house, looking at the tailor, who was putting up a new\r\nsign: “Pants pressed, ten cents. Full-dress suits cleaned and pressed,\r\none dollar.” McGibney thought of “full-dress” suits and looked down the\r\nstreet, at rags and dirt and ashes. It was Saturday night and they were\r\ngoing over to Ninth Avenue, to Paddy’s Market. Along came Clara, reaching\r\nthe stoop, starting up the stoop, half up the stoop before she saw the\r\nMcGibneys.\r\n\r\n“Oh, is it you?” said Clara, with only the beginning of the slow, amiable\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“The portcheers is gone!” she said, without excitement. “My heart was\r\nset on them—the portcheers has gone. Would you say to me, now, that it\r\nonly happens that way, Mrs. McGibney? Is there somebody playing mean, low\r\ntricks on me, or ain’t there? Does three times in succession just happen?\r\nThe portcheers was bought last Monday. Was that only accident? Oh, but\r\nI came around to see would you lend me fifty cents? There’s a hat-rack\r\nI want. It’s meant for a front hall, but the mirror in it is nice and\r\nthere’s a bit of marble to it, and it’ll look nice in my rooms, where,\r\nto my longest day, no man’ll ever hang his hat on it, unless you, Mr.\r\nMcGibney, when you and Mrs. McGibney come and see me. I don’t like to ask\r\nyou for fifty cents, Mrs. McGibney, and you just going to do your bit of\r\nmarketing.”\r\n\r\n“There’s fifty dollars in the bank that you can have any time you say so,\r\nClara!” exclaimed McGibney.\r\n\r\n“We’d rather have you owing it than have it in the bank, Clara,” said\r\nMrs. McGibney, “because the bank might bust.”\r\n\r\nClara looked embarrassed. “Don’t you want to come look at the hat-rack?”\r\nshe asked. “It’ll set your front room off fine!” The McGibneys pinched\r\neach other’s arms, as if saying, “Oh, Lord, preserve us!” All three went\r\ndown the street toward Ninth Avenue, Clara preferring one side of the\r\nstreet; then, thinking the other side was darker, choosing the darker\r\nside so that if they should meet “him” he might not recognize them.\r\n\r\nTorches on wagons, wagonloads of oranges, twenty for twenty-five cents;\r\npairs of rabbits slung on headless barrels, plump rabbits hanging\r\noutside, furry rags, shot to pieces, inside the barrels; piles of soup\r\ngreens and mounds of cabbages; cries of “Everything cheap! Only a few\r\nmore left!” Paddy’s Market! Then the second-hand furniture store, with\r\nbed springs and pillows outside it; stoves with covers and legs in the\r\novens; rolls of matting; everything second-hand, even crockery and\r\ntea-kettles. Clara went into the store, Mrs. McGibney having paused to\r\ndig a thumb-nail into potatoes to see whether they were frozen, McGibney\r\nlingering with her, because he would have to carry the potatoes.\r\n\r\nClara came back to the sidewalk. Again her eyes were unseeing. “The\r\nhat-rack,” said Clara, staring at nothing visible, “is sold. I ain’t been\r\ngone from here ten minutes. It’s sold. Everything I got my heart on is\r\nsold. I don’t know who’s doing it, but they’ll never have a day’s luck\r\nfor it.”\r\n\r\n“But what could I do, lady?” The furniture man came cringing out to her.\r\n“You know you didn’t leave no deposit. Would you like to look at some\r\nmats for your front hall? You didn’t leave no deposit, so what could I\r\ndo? I got a very heavy, rich and elegant mat here for your front hall;\r\nthough the number of a house is onto it.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Jack,” said McGibney. “Who’s buying up all the things this\r\nlady looks at? Is it any particular party?”\r\n\r\n“Come to think of it, it is,” answered the furniture man. “He’s the gent\r\ntook the unfurnished rooms upstairs. ‘What’s he look like?’ Well, he bows\r\nmost polite every time my wife waits on him and I see his head was some\r\nbald——”\r\n\r\n“Wait for me!” said Clara. “Up on the next floor, you say? Just only wait\r\none minute for me, Mrs. McGibney, and I’ll only go to tell him what I\r\nthink of this latest meanness he’s playing me. Then I’ll be through with\r\nhim forever. This is the last trick he’ll play me!” And she went to the\r\nstairs leading to the rooms over the store.\r\n\r\n“It must be Tommy,” said McGibney.\r\n\r\n“And I always took him for such a perfect little gentleman,” was Mrs.\r\nMcGibney’s comment.\r\n\r\n“Just wait a minute!” Clara had said; but, after several minutes,\r\nMcGibney became uneasy.\r\n\r\n“I’ll go up and see,” he said. “It maybe ain’t Tommy, and Clara may start\r\nmixing it with some stranger that’s got as much right to the furniture as\r\nher.”\r\n\r\nBut it was Tommy, for, as the McGibneys went up the stairs, Clara’s\r\nwords, plainly audible, told them so.\r\n\r\n“Never!” they heard—“Was it my dying day, I’d never forgive you. It was\r\ntoo cruel and I’ll never forget it.”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t she the stubborn thing!” snapped Mrs. McGibney.\r\n\r\n“Did I live to be as old as Mickthusalem, I’d not forgive you for it!\r\nOh, Tommy, how could you go up the street when I went down? To treat me\r\nso! Don’t never mind nothing else; play me tricks and scold me and don’t\r\ndo right nor anywheres near right, but how could you do that? Oh, Tommy,\r\nhow could you go up the street when I went down? Me expecting your feet\r\nafter me every second, me looking back at the corner. You going up, and\r\nme going down! Rob me of them portcheers I see you got there, and play me\r\ntricks with that mirror, and do like you want to about all the hall-racks\r\nin the world, but you never come to find me when I was hiding away! Have\r\nthe red portcheers and welcome to everything my heart was set on, but you\r\nnever come to me when I was hiding, and how could I tell you where I was\r\nhiding away? Oh, I been so unhappy without you, Tommy; there’s nobody\r\ngot any sympathy for a deserted wife, but just a jeer at her and say,\r\n‘No wonder he left, if you take one look at her big platter face’—but my\r\neyes is nice and my hair is lovely, I was always told. Take away the red\r\nportcheers my heart was set on, Tommy, and I know you don’t love me,\r\nbut we belong to each other, just the same, but don’t—oh, if you ain’t\r\nlooking to break my heart—don’t never again go up a street when I’m going\r\ndown!”\r\n\r\nThe McGibneys saw them standing in the centre of the room, arms about\r\neach other, hands patting each other’s shoulder-blades.\r\n\r\nTommy began to whimper. Arms mothered him. Steady tapping away on his\r\nshoulder-blades. Then Tommy blubbered outright:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Clara, I been missable! I been missable something fierce, living\r\nalone! I ain’t ate nor slept, but been working straight along and got\r\na good job and doing pretty good, and so much as a day’s work you’ll\r\nnever have to do. No! not if it’s your longest day!” A bow and a bob\r\nand a scrape, for he had discovered the McGibneys standing irresolute\r\nin the hall. He continued to blubber and he continued to tap away at\r\nshoulder-blades.\r\n\r\n“But why didn’t you come to find me, Tommy, when I was hiding away? I\r\ntold the Finnigans and everybody, so you must of known where I was hiding\r\naway!”\r\n\r\nClara would not have seen a hundred McGibneys. Clara was tapping most\r\nmightily with both hands upon shoulder-blades.\r\n\r\n“On account of the brass lamp!” blubbered Tommy. A bob and a bow and a\r\nscrape! “I done fierce bad spending our savings that was for the brass\r\nlamp, and I couldn’t go find you where you was hid till I had that here,\r\nin this new home, for you to see, and be complete, and then you’d know\r\nI was sorry and it would prove I was going to do right. But it wasn’t\r\ntricks, Clara! Honest, it wasn’t tricks! Me standing on the other side\r\nof the street, and looking in the store window at you, and no overcoat,\r\nbecause I needed every cent to show I was going to do right. And you look\r\nat the mirror. I say, ‘Clara likes that mirror. Then Clara must have\r\nthat!’ Me standing with my toes all pinched up, as my shoes is bad, and\r\nyou looking at them red portcheers. Then Clara must have red portcheers!\r\nMe jumping up and down, like I’m froze, but standing there every Saturday\r\nnight to see what Clara likes and Clara’s going to have that!” Bobbing,\r\nbowing, and scraping toward the hall, from Tommy; from Clara, rather a\r\nlook of resentment toward the hall.\r\n\r\nA final tap on shoulder blades and: “Why, come in and see where we’re\r\ngoing to start up again!”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t it strange!” said calm, stolid Clara. “He found me, after all!”\r\n\r\nAnd from all four of them, and all four meaning every word:\r\n\r\n“In all the world, there ain’t nobody like your own! If it ain’t but big\r\nenough to hold a trunk, there’s no place like your own!”\r\n\r\n“And,” said supremely happy Tommy and Clara, “now we’ll celebrate!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Will It Keep Them Off?_\r\n\r\n    _Carter, in New York American_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Money Power_\r\n\r\n\r\n“All things come to him that waits.” Fifteen or sixteen years ago, when\r\nthe Farmers’ Alliance was flourishing throughout the West and South, it\r\nwas a matter of common occurrence to hear some old horny-handed farmer,\r\non a Saturday at the county seat, disputing with his neighbor about\r\nexisting conditions. Almost invariably the Alliance man blamed the “money\r\npower” for causing things to go criss-cross. Occasionally the country\r\nmerchant or small banker would butt into the discussion. “The money\r\npower,” he would say, with infinite scorn, “Humph! Why, you poor fool,\r\nthere ain’t any such thing as ‘the money power.’ Might as well talk of\r\nthe agricultural power, or the mercantile power. There are rich bankers\r\nand rich farmers and rich merchants—but that don’t make them a ‘power’ in\r\nthe sense you use that term.”\r\n\r\nFor a number of years the “money power” has been given a much needed rest\r\nin the West and South. Most of the pioneers there have substituted the\r\nterm “plutocracy.” But in the East reformers are just now beginning to\r\nsit up and take notice. One hears the term frequently. “Roosevelt,” said\r\nJacob Riis, in a recent interview in the _New York Herald_, “is fighting\r\nthe greatest tyrant of them all. Slavery affected only the South, but the\r\nMoney Power means the enslavement of all human beings and all homes.”\r\nMany an old, long-whiskered farmer said the same thing just as well\r\nfifteen years ago—and the _Herald_ called him an anarchist.\r\n\r\n“The Senate,” says Ernest Crosby in the March _Cosmopolitan_, “is now the\r\nagent of the Money Power—the representative of Wall Street.” Absolutely\r\ntrue; and no one can doubt the sincerity of either Mr. Crosby or the\r\n_Cosmopolitan_; but when the farmers of the West and South said the same\r\nthing fifteen years ago, they were greeted with hoots and jeers from the\r\nEast. I don’t say that Messrs. Riis and Crosby joined in the hooting and\r\njeering; I am quite sure they did not; but they are accorded a respectful\r\nhearing in making statements for the making of which thousands of\r\nrespectable men fifteen years ago were branded as anarchists, wild-eyed\r\nfanatics, lunatics, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe world _do move_.\r\n\r\n                                                                 L. H. B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Russian Apostle of Populism_\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS C. HUTTON\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago a grayheaded prisoner, neglected, gaunt, unbefriended,\r\ndied in the dungeons of Schlüsselburg, and today a thousand Russian\r\ncities are ringing with the name of Mikal Bakunin, the apostle of\r\nPopulism, one of the many reformers who were stoned by a contemporary\r\npublic and sainted by its descendants.\r\n\r\nRussia spurned the impassioned orator; Germany exiled him, after a few\r\nmonths of toleration, and now his projects are discussed by millions who\r\nseem determined to give them a fair trial.\r\n\r\n“A pack of knout-serving flunkeys,” Bakunin called the German officials\r\nwho enforced the frontier-laws in the interest of the Czar, and soon\r\nafter a messenger in uniform served him with a copy of the Prussian\r\npress-laws, and a hint at the expedience of making himself invisible.\r\n\r\nHis virulent tongue hurt him a good deal, and his popularity was somewhat\r\nmodified by his social radicalism; but the long neglect of his revenue\r\nplan is one of the strangest facts in the literature of political\r\neconomy. One might as well reject Kepler’s solar hypothesis, because the\r\ngreat astronomer got a little cloudy on the question of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, Bakunin only whispered his matrimonial theories, but\r\nshouted his tax-protests before multitudes who ought to have known better\r\nthan to class them with his chimeras.\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, his main reform plan is this: That governments ought to\r\nearn their own revenues as they cast their own cannon and build their\r\nown battleships.\r\n\r\n“Look at your great Government stud-farm of Trakehnen,” said he, in a\r\nspeech on the old Breslau market-square. “Model stables, model granaries,\r\nfine pastures, all more than self-supporting, monthly auctions of forage\r\nand surplus horses. Oats are barreled in airy magazines, and, for greater\r\nsecurity, the granary warden breeds cats, and hires two boys to take care\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n“All lovely, so far. But now suppose those boys were to break in a\r\nprivate cottage and snatch away a poor youngster’s kitten, on the\r\npretext that the Government might have need of it? At sight of a club,\r\nthe little lad would have to let his pet go, but could you blame him\r\nfor growling?—Why don’t you get oats of your own? And let my little\r\nkitten alone?—And that is exactly what I am growling about when I see\r\ntax-collectors confiscate a poor man’s last milch-cow or nanny-goat.”\r\n\r\nThe orator then described the estate of Prince Gorkas, a semi-independent\r\nland-magnate near Tiflis, in the southern Caucasus. The Prince’s tenants\r\npay a moderate rent; freeholders keep his good will by buying his cattle\r\nand coal. Free schools, fairly good, and no tax-collectors—a pattern of\r\nwhat an empire ought to be on a large scale. Foreseeing the eventual\r\nneed of money for the purchase of a neighboring estate, the Prince had\r\na mountain-side planted with plum trees, to sell the dried fruit. His\r\nengineers opened a mine of cannel-coal, and soon had a large market.\r\nTheir master hoarded and was thought capable of driving a sharp bargain,\r\nbut gossips would have risked the lunatic-asylum if they had spread a\r\nreport that Prince Gorkas had broken into the little crossroad store and\r\nhelped himself to a share of the old storekeeper’s savings.\r\n\r\nFruit plantations are also managed by the Shah of Persia, and mines of\r\nvast values by the Russian Government. Prussia and Austria own extensive\r\ntimber forests and realize a handsome profit after paying reasonable\r\nwages to thousands of wardens, rangers and woodcutters.\r\n\r\nSaxony operates national mines and large national glass-works.\r\n\r\nDo kings need ordnance? Let them hire foundries to cast it for them. Do\r\nthey need gunpowder? Hire chemists to mix it for them.\r\n\r\nDo they need money? Why, let them hire business-men to earn it for them.\r\nNot the faintest ghost of a doubt but it can be done.\r\n\r\nA little more difficult than raising royal race-horses? Perhaps so. But\r\ndoes that give His Majesty the right to race down a peddler and take his\r\nmoney away from him? Now reflect, and do not let your verdict be biased\r\nby the idea that might makes right, or that a long-established absurdity\r\nbecomes reasonable.\r\n\r\nWhy collect revenues by Government highway robbery, by Government hold-up\r\nmethods, by harpies in Government uniform, when the test of practical\r\nexperience proves that revenues can be raised by Government industries?\r\n\r\nWould you bring the State in unfair competition with individuals?\r\n“Don’t for one moment,” says Bakunin, “believe that lie of lazybones.\r\nSecretaries of Finance find it easier to hire marauders than to hire\r\nskilled mechanics, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nWho is hurt by the great stockfarm at Trakehnen? It could be enlarged\r\ntwenty times, and still give private enterprise a chance to raise\r\nprize-horses at a considerable profit. Who complains about Government\r\nforestry? It gives bread to hundreds of thousands; it protects the\r\nfountains of fertilizing streams; it prevents droughts, but does not\r\nprevent individuals from conducting timber-plantations at a profit\r\nexceeding that of grain farms.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian Government owns coal-mines, but private mine-owners will\r\ncontinue to prosper till they exhaust the supply of the mineral. No\r\nglass-worker has ever objected to the Government glass-works of Saxony.\r\nThey invite co-operation; the demand for artistic glass products exceeds\r\nthe supply.\r\n\r\nIf Government mines and factories, why not Government commerce, and,\r\nabove all, Government real estate transactions—Government landlordism\r\nto an extent that will hurt no other landlord, and benefit millions of\r\ntenants?\r\n\r\nFound new communities on the plan of reserving a certain percentage of\r\nbuilding lots for state purposes, and lease those reservations for five\r\nto ten years to the highest bidder. If the Government erects buildings,\r\nlet them be models of their kind—fire-proof storehouses, sanitary\r\ntenements.\r\n\r\nGovernment plantations ought to be drained till gnat-plagues are no more;\r\nequipped with improved machinery, with airy cottages; a blessing to all\r\nconcerned, and yet an undoubted source of revenue, since experience\r\nproves that wholesale farming operations are the most profitable.\r\n\r\nOne tobacco plantation of the French Government yields a yearly net\r\nrevenue of 2,000,000 francs, and the only objection is the nature of\r\nthe crop; national agriculture could raise profitable harvests without\r\ncatering to a stimulant habit. Government commission houses should import\r\nJamaica bananas, rather than Jamaica rum.\r\n\r\nOn the Bakunin plan, national revenue industries should, as a rule,\r\nselect their ground where the strain of competition is the least likely\r\nto be felt. After that, objectors should be referred to a chronicle of\r\nsuch alternatives as trust despotism.\r\n\r\n“No governments,” he asks, “decline to dirty their hands delving for\r\nboodle? Oh, ye prayerful pirates! Lineal descendants of the bushwhacker\r\nprinces who preferred clubs to spades! Below their dignity to cut wood,\r\nbut did cut purses and throats. Too highborn to clean out a pig-sty, but\r\ndid clean out peddlers and often whole caravans.\r\n\r\n“And now the descendants of those beautiful buccaneers, too proud to\r\nmine or farm, but not ashamed to fall upon a poor farmer’s homestead\r\nand confiscate his last horse! Not too dignified to hold up a crippled\r\nhuckster and collar two-thirds of his hard earned pennies. Too sensitive\r\nto work the windlass of a silvermine, but rough-handed enough to wring\r\nsilver from a consumptive shopkeeper. Our grandiose rulers, I should say,\r\nare in small business when they break in to snatch a widow’s kettle and\r\ncot-bed.\r\n\r\n“Yet that’s done every day in the year. Statistics claim that somewhere\r\non earth a child is born every second. And at least every minute sees the\r\nbirth of a child that will have to die of hunger, because its mother’s\r\nbread has been filched by tax-collectors.\r\n\r\n“Have Governments a right to supply their needs at the expense of widows\r\nand orphans, while thousands of able-bodied young men stand ready to earn\r\nrevenue for them?”\r\n\r\nHigh tariff bullies, says the Russian reformer, are marine highway\r\nrobbers. At first sight, the burden of spoliation seems shifted to the\r\nshoulders of foreigners, but, look closer, and you find natives obliged\r\nto buy imports at extortion rates.\r\n\r\nPassengers, waiting to be examined by custom-house officers, says\r\nBakunin, always remind him of travelers, lined up to be searched by\r\nfootpads.\r\n\r\n“How commerce revives,” he says, “wherever those shackles are partly\r\nremoved! How would it flourish if they were altogether abolished?\r\nTraffic that now obliges skippers to starve their sailors could be made\r\nabundantly profitable.”\r\n\r\nA hundred years before the birth of Henry George, a revenue system,\r\nclosely resembling the “Single Tax” plan, was recommended by the father\r\nof Gabriel Mirabeau, and by the Roget School of French Communists.\r\n\r\n“It _would_ relieve some classes of our wage-earners,” says Bakunin, “but\r\nwould burden others, and why harass them, if we can undoubtedly find ways\r\nto get along without direct taxation?”\r\n\r\nWhy make land the scapegoat of a sin that might be avoided?\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the Russian Government got its clutches on the bold reformer,\r\nand silenced him by the usual argument of despots. The voice that had\r\nentranced mass-meetings in a hundred cities of southern and western\r\nEurope was stifled in the catacombs of Schlüsselburg.\r\n\r\nBut Time, the All-Avenger, has made the martyr’s name a rallying cry of\r\nEast-European reformers, and America should honor the memory of Mikal\r\nBakunin as that of a hero and pioneer of reform—a man whose marvelous\r\ngift of intuition had recognized all the ideals of Populism, all its\r\nprinciples and promises, but who succumbed to the superhuman task of\r\neffecting its progress under the handicap of a monarchical government.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Naturally_\r\n\r\nKNICKER—There goes a man who would rather fight than eat.\r\n\r\nBOCKER—Soldier?\r\n\r\nKNICKER—No, dyspeptic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCIANNA’S KEEP\r\n\r\nBY ELLIOT WALKER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’ve got twenty dollars for the rent an’ fifteen more for what’s likely\r\nto come up,” observed Enos Matchett cheerfully, as he put down his\r\nteacup. “There’s nothin’ to worry about this first of month, anyhow. Eh,\r\nMartha?”\r\n\r\nHis wife fingered her napkin in a nervous way, usual to her when the\r\nappalling call of their landlord was due, not to mention others who\r\nfished from pockets soiled packages of rubber-banded slips to draw out\r\ntentatively and none too expectantly those alarming accounts marked at\r\ntheir tops with the discredited name of Enos Matchett.\r\n\r\nPoor Martha. The “Oh! Yes. I’ll speak to my husband about it,” and the\r\nhundred other subterfuges were growing gaunt with repetition. She had a\r\nregular repertory of excuses to apply as conditions demanded. For a first\r\npresentation a fixed and nonchalant smile and a “come ’round next month,”\r\ncaused quick riddance of the unwelcome. “Next month,” it was, “I declare,\r\nI guess Mr. Matchett overlooked that little bill. Perhaps, you’d better\r\nleave it so he’ll keep it in mind.”\r\n\r\nFrom then on, rang the changes of high prices, hard times and\r\nhonest intentions until at last came the sharp, bullying threat of\r\nthe collection lawyer and the crawling process of paying by small\r\ninstallments.\r\n\r\nSometimes she tore up the bills, sometimes they went into the fire,\r\nnever, until her last bridge had collapsed, did she worry Enos.\r\n\r\nHe worked, hopefully, from morning to night at odd jobs and occasional\r\nbits of carpentry. A fortunate month might fatten their attenuated\r\nexchequer to a bulge of sixty dollars, but the months were not all\r\nfortunate and there was seldom a penny came in that remained over a\r\nfortnight. To meet the rent was imperative. That had to be met. For the\r\nrest—wits, hopes, and a somewhat shattered faith in the Lord’s providence.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the Lord endowed average femininity with a high scorn of\r\nbills and an abnormal intelligence in the evasion of payment much was\r\ndone for man.\r\n\r\nEnos, undoubtedly, would have become as flighty and irresponsible as was\r\nLucianna, upstairs, had he been obliged to face the shafts which his\r\nworried better half so successfully foiled to the last ditch.\r\n\r\nNow, Martha gazed across the table at him, with the smile of one\r\ntemporarily relieved from anxiety.\r\n\r\n“That’s good,” she answered. “It’s queer how we’ve kep’ along.”\r\n\r\n“Ain’t it?” responded Mr. Matchett. “I was consid’rable pestered ten\r\ndays ago as to how we’d come out this month, but Miss Joslyn paid me,\r\nan’ I had a week steady on Doctor Bullen’s fence. No one in particular\r\na-hurryin’ us jest now, I s’pose?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t think of any special tormentor,” returned Martha, biting her thin\r\nlips. Indeed, no obvious projection in the wall of torment occurred to\r\nher at the moment. Their creditors were “lined up,” in equal aggression.\r\nOne was as bad as another.\r\n\r\nEnos tugged at his gray mustache—a sparse adornment, getting white at the\r\nends.\r\n\r\n“Guess we’ll blow a dollar on something for Lucianna then,” he ventured\r\ngenerously.\r\n\r\n“Guess not!” exclaimed Martha, with decision. “The child’s got\r\ntoys enough. Feedin’ her is more to the point. I never see such an\r\nappetite. She’s happy. Let her alone and put your money where ’twill be\r\nappreciated.”\r\n\r\nLucianna, now a child supposed to have attained twenty-five years, and a\r\nvery queer one at that, had employed most of her day in making faces at\r\nsuch of the passers who did not meet her approval, and smiling at those\r\nwho did. These courtesies were accentuated by taps on the window panes.\r\n\r\nThe poor harmless creature could be allowed little liberty as she ran\r\naway and sat on doorsteps, proclaiming herself a burglar of kittens.\r\nGiven a kitten, or stealing one, Lucianna would go home delighted.\r\n\r\nThe influx of kittens became too trying. Enos, a soft-hearted man, would\r\ndo no murder. Martha, steeled to crime through desperation, had disposed\r\nof several, really unfit to exist, and found homes for more. Lucianna\r\nforgot them over night. Therefore, it had lately become necessary to\r\nconfine her to her room, where she was allowed one kitten during the day.\r\n\r\nThis satisfied Lucianna completely. Besides, she possessed six dolls,\r\ntoys galore, and when these joys palled there was the window.\r\n\r\nWhatever possessed the Matchetts to make a home for the unfortunate girl\r\nwas a mystery to their acquaintances, as she was no kin. Years before,\r\nwhen life was younger and brighter, with Enos at a paying job, and\r\nMartha ambitious for a servant yet unable to afford a regular domestic,\r\nLucianna, then a pretty child of about thirteen, had appeared and asked\r\nfor something to eat.\r\n\r\nShe was well grown and seemed strong, although exhausted by walking and\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nMartha took her in, and an idea seized the good woman, after certain\r\nquestions had been put and answered.\r\n\r\nIt was their plain duty to keep this little stranger until somebody\r\nclaimed her, and in the event of no one turning up for the waif, why not\r\ntrain her for service?\r\n\r\nLucianna was reticent about her past career. Enos thought she lied.\r\nMartha said she was too young to remember. It seemed a case of no mother,\r\na father who had gone away leaving her with unkind people who did not\r\nlove her.\r\n\r\nIn corroboration of this last statement Lucianna exposed a plump arm\r\ndecorated with small bruises of various ages and colors.\r\n\r\n“Pinches,” she explained, snuffling. This settled Enos, who went down\r\ncellar and split more kindlings than he had ever done at one bout.\r\n\r\nWhen he came up, perspiring and still glaring, Lucianna had been fed and\r\nput to bed. Martha was washing the soiled socks, and singing thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Seems nice to have a child in the house,” she remarked.\r\n\r\n“We’ll keep her along,” returned Mr. Matchett. “Good little thing.”\r\n\r\n“As gold,” affirmed his wife.\r\n\r\nThis was the advent of Lucianna. Beyond the fact of her surname being\r\nCrowson, her clothes plain, her eyes blue, her light hair cut short, and\r\nthat she bore marks of abuse, the worthy couple knew nothing.\r\n\r\nNeither did they go out of their way for information. Lucianna proved\r\naffectionate, willing and useful, with a passion for cats.\r\n\r\nIn a year she had become almost as their own. Enos worshiped her. Martha\r\ndid, too, but made Lucianna work, as befitted her position as helper.\r\n\r\nAnother year and the girl developed peculiarities that worried them. She\r\neyed them shyly. She grimaced at Enos most impertinently when he trod on\r\nher cat’s tail. Martha spanked her. Lucianna laughed.\r\n\r\nA few months more and she became erratic, irresponsible and useless, but\r\nalways good natured. As Enos expressed it, “Lucianna had gone back to\r\nbein’ a kid.”\r\n\r\nSome money went for medical advice. There was but one opinion.\r\n“Weak-minded. The patient might grow worse, but hardly probable if kindly\r\ntreated. With great care under expert treatment she might improve. Such\r\ncases were outside the regular practice. Would recommend a sanitarium,\r\nor an asylum. Of course, if they wished to have her remain at home, no\r\nobjection could be raised; but a burden—a burden.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll keep her along,” announced Enos. “We’ve got hands and hearts yet,\r\nhain’t we?”\r\n\r\n“God forgive me for spankin’ her,” wept Martha. “The poor thing couldn’t\r\nhelp her actions, an’ she never held it against me. Jest laughed, she\r\ndid, takin’ it all in good part.”\r\n\r\n“She sha’n’t go to no asylum,” cried Mr. Matchett, rising to the\r\noccasion. “Sanitariums an’ expert doctors ain’t for our pockets. She come\r\nto us for carin’, growed to be our little girl, an’ by Josh! Lucianna\r\nwill be kep’ along.”\r\n\r\nShe was; and always reported to be “about the same.”\r\n\r\nTen years of it—ten long, trying, down-hill years, but neither Enos\r\nMatchett nor his wife had ever wavered in loyalty or love to their\r\ncharge. Indeed, the worse things got, the more they thought of Lucianna.\r\n\r\nHer daily airing (on the wiry arm of Martha), her whims, her playthings,\r\nwere all attended to, religiously.\r\n\r\nIf, as frequently happened, she made a bright remark, her devoted keepers\r\nnodded sagely, saying, “She’s gettin’ better.”\r\n\r\nAs for the expense, whatever their thoughts in secret, both kept a\r\nguarded silence. Only this evening had Martha for the first time\r\ndeprecated the failing of Enos to “blow a dollar for Lucianna.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, curiously, and grunted.\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said he, recklessly. “Got fifteen ahead.”\r\n\r\nMartha’s tongue uncurbed at this unseemly boast. Her long nose twitched.\r\n\r\n“Ahead!” she snorted. “You stay in my place tomorrow, Enos Matchett. You\r\nmind the door for one mornin’ and see how much you’re _ahead_.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” returned Enos, his placid features animating resentfully.\r\n“I can spare the time till noon. No need of snappin’ at me as I see. No\r\nsense in deprivin’ Lucianna of a little pleasure, neither. There’s nobody\r\npressin’ us hard—said so yourself. What’s a dollar, anyway?”\r\n\r\nAlas! to the contempt of Mr. Matchett for the single dollar was due much\r\nof their financial tribulation.\r\n\r\n“I’m going up to visit with the girl,” he added. “_She_ won’t be snappy.”\r\n\r\nThis parting thrust rankled in Martha’s bosom, and the supper table was\r\ncleared with rather unnecessary clatter. The improvident, easy-going Enos\r\nalways let her have her own way. He turned over his earnings to her more\r\ncareful hands, spending very little on himself, and trusted implicitly to\r\nwifely wisdom in all household matters. A real quarrel between them had\r\nnever occurred.\r\n\r\nResponsibility, shifted from his fat shoulders to her narrow ones, was\r\nboth agreeable and natural to Enos. His make-up was that of the man\r\nwho never “troubled trouble,” until cornered. Then he became actually\r\nbelligerent and invited war. Up to this rare point Mr. Matchett bluffed\r\ngood-humoredly.\r\n\r\nWhen assailed by creditors on the street he was invariably in a hurry to\r\nperform some important and paying job—a fictitious pleasantry.\r\n\r\n“Can’t bother about that now,” he would grin. “Drop ’round to the house\r\nan’ see Mis’ Matchett. She ’tends to the finances, an’ if she hasn’t\r\nspent all I give her lately, you’ll get something.”\r\n\r\nThis ingenious disposition of duns was not meant to be unkind.\r\n\r\n“Martha’ll fix him,” Enos would chuckle, trotting along. “She don’t mind.”\r\n\r\nSo the brunt fell on Martha, and it was patiently borne.\r\n\r\nBut nerves grow irritable under constant pricking until they are ready\r\nto snap. Martha did mind. Of late she had felt like hiding whenever the\r\ndoor-bell rang. It took a long breath, a determined effort, a clutch at\r\nher quick beating heart for an appearance of unconcern, and her poor\r\nbrain quivered with apprehension at its dearth of successful excuses.\r\n\r\n“Let him have a turn,” she muttered, wiping the dishes. “The rent\r\ncollector won’t be ’round ’till afternoon, but there’s a-plenty of others\r\nlikely to show up. His fifteen dollars will get melted fast enough. _I_\r\ncould sprinkle it right, but he don’t know how. The first feller will get\r\nit all, an’ then——”\r\n\r\nMartha paused to laugh, dismally. There was another side. How about\r\nfuture calls from those turned down by Enos? He might lose his temper.\r\nAll the worse for her.\r\n\r\n“I’m most hopin’ nobody’ll come,” she faltered. “I ain’t so sure of\r\ngettin’ the best of this.”\r\n\r\nHowever, the following morning saw her marching off smilingly, with\r\nLucianna in high feather at the prospect of a long stroll.\r\n\r\nEnos regarded their departure with complacence, expecting an undisturbed\r\nsession. At the most, some small bill might be presented. He knew\r\njust how he would pay it; carelessly, with a jaunty, indifferent air,\r\nas if the amount was a trifle. This was his unvarying attitude of\r\nsettlement—when he settled.\r\n\r\nWith newspapers and a pipe, it would be quite a holiday. He established\r\nhimself comfortably, soon forgetting indebtedness in perusing the details\r\nof late murders.\r\n\r\nShortly after nine o’clock came a ring of the bell—a feeble peal—Enos\r\nwent to the door.\r\n\r\nThe caller was a stranger to him,—a dapper, gentlemanly man whose\r\npleasant face bore an embarrassed expression.\r\n\r\n“I—I wish to see Mrs. Matchett,” he began.\r\n\r\n“Out for a walk,” said Enos, a bit pompously. “Any message? I’m Mr.\r\nMatchett.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” the man pursed his lips and hesitated. “I—I wanted to speak with\r\nyour wife about an account. Something of her own, you know—er—wearing\r\napparel. If I could get the money today it would be a great convenience.”\r\n\r\nEnos laughed indulgently.\r\n\r\n“Clothes, eh? You needn’t be modest about that. I don’t rec’lect her\r\nhavin’ any new ones for years, but it’s all right, I guess. I’m payin’\r\nthe bills. Trot it out an’ I’ll settle right now an’ glad to.”\r\n\r\nThe man looked relieved. “If it’s perfectly convenient?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” puffed Enos. “I’ve got the stuff ready for any little thing\r\nthat may come up.”\r\n\r\nHe unfolded the paper and glanced at the total under a short list of\r\nitems. It was just thirty-five dollars.\r\n\r\nMatchett gazed at the figures, too appalled to change countenance beyond\r\na drop of the jaw.\r\n\r\nSlowly, he pulled out his precious roll, and counted the money into the\r\nother’s hands.\r\n\r\n“Receipt that bill!” he grunted.\r\n\r\n“I’m ever so much obliged,” said the man glibly, his eyes on the paper as\r\nhe signed the long name of a well known dry goods house, “and I wish you\r\nwould explain to Mrs. Matchett.”\r\n\r\n“I will,” returned Enos shortly.\r\n\r\n“You see, we’ve sold out recently,” pursued his caller. “We are\r\ncollecting all old accounts. This, as you perceive, is very old. We have\r\nnever bothered Mrs. Matchett. I hated to come, really I did, but the\r\npresent conditions made it imperative. Before your wife purchased the\r\ngoods, she went to Mr. Morley—head of the old firm, you know, and told\r\nhim so honestly that she couldn’t tell when she would be able to pay, and\r\nher reasons for buying, that it quite tickled the old gentleman. He came\r\nto me—I have charge of the dress goods department—Parker is my name.\r\n\r\n“Says he, ‘Parker, wait on this lady and I’ll speak to the bookkeeper\r\nas to the bill.’ He gave orders to keep it back, so it’s never been\r\npresented. Very unusual and unbusinesslike, of course, but Mr. Morley had\r\npeculiarities. Pity he died. Our new head is a very different sort. Very\r\nstrict. So I felt it was my place to see Mrs. Matchett, as I sold her the\r\ngoods and she would remember. Ladies are apt to forget their little bills\r\nif not reminded. I think your wife will remember.”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” said Enos. “Well, the thing’s paid and that’s all.” His\r\nvoice was steady, but deeper than usual.\r\n\r\n“That’s all. Yes, sir. Sorry to trouble you, and very many thanks. I’m\r\nmuch relieved to find it was no inconvenience. So many people complain of\r\nhard times. Good day.”\r\n\r\nMr. Parker skipped down the steps. Mr. Matchett locked the door.\r\n\r\nHe went to the most remote room in the house and sat for two hours in\r\na state of apathetic despair, broken only by short bursts of wrath.\r\nOh, Martha should long recollect this day! Several times the bell rang\r\ninsistently, but Enos paid no heed.\r\n\r\nAt last he settled on a plan of action and went wearily down to unlock\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe two women came in, shortly before noon. In the sunshine and freedom,\r\nMartha had cast care to the winds. Her eyes were bright. In her thin\r\ncheeks played a faint color. Lucianna had behaved beautifully. Now, she\r\ngiggled at sight of Enos, and clamored for dinner.\r\n\r\n“We’ll have some soon,” said Martha, stirring about. “Had a quiet\r\nmorning, husband?” mischievously.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t seen a bill against me,” replied Mr. Matchett, calmly. “I’ve\r\nset still till I’ll be glad to get into the air. Let’s eat, an’ I’ll be\r\nstartin’.”\r\n\r\nThe eye-brows of his wife lifted in wonder. After all, she was glad of\r\nthe news. It would have been too bad to have Enos upset.\r\n\r\nHe ate in silence while she chatted volubly of her outing, not remarking\r\nhis lack of attention.\r\n\r\n“Through?” he asked, as Martha rolled her napkin and sat back.\r\n\r\n“All through,” she smiled.\r\n\r\n“Well, _I_ ain’t,” said the man, leaning forward, his eyes stern and\r\nreproachful. “Nor you, neither. We’ve a bit of dessert to chew on,\r\nMartha Matchett. I told you I hadn’t seen a bill against _me_. I’ve seen\r\none against you, an’ I’ve paid it! Yes, marm. Paid it! Here!” he thrust\r\nthe paper at her.\r\n\r\n“Dear God!” moaned the woman, after a lightning glimpse. “It’s come on\r\nto me at last. Oh! Enos, husband, don’t look so at me. It was for Cousin\r\nMinna’s weddin’—four years ago;—I wanted to go. I didn’t have no dress,\r\nnor fixin’s. You was away. I went to Mr. Morley’s store an’ had ’em\r\ncharged. He said I could pay when I had the money. I’ve never had it. The\r\ndress I’ve never worn since. I—I hid it away till I could pay for it,\r\nEnos—oh, dear, oh, dear.”\r\n\r\nShe sobbed, piteously, staring wildly at him through her tears.\r\n\r\n“An’—you—paid—it,” came her horrified gasps. “Every—cent—we had.”\r\n\r\n“You can attend to the rent, Martha,” the voice of Enos was unmoved as he\r\narose. “I’m goin’ to rake lawns.”\r\n\r\nHe went out without another word or look, leaving her weeping and rocking\r\nto and fro.\r\n\r\nFrom the outside he gazed at the house. It was a pretty cottage of a\r\ncheap kind. They had lived there for three years, and Martha’s vines\r\nhad grown. Her flower bed, so carefully tended, how pretty it was! On\r\nthe opposite side of the road lay a great vacant lot—a pasture on the\r\ncity outskirts. Trees were there—and cows. In summer, children played\r\namong the grasses. In winter, they coasted. It was just the place for\r\nLucianna—for Martha—for Enos, too.\r\n\r\n“Got to leave it,” groaned the man. “No use talkin’. It’s pay or get\r\nout. Plenty wants it—and old Craddock won’t wait again. Third time we’ll\r\nhave moved. Confound Minna’s weddin’ an’ a deceivin’ woman. If I’d known\r\nit—oh! if I only had—but I said I’d pay an’ I did. Now, _let_ her do some\r\npayin’.”\r\n\r\nLucianna tapped on the window and beamed at him. His answering smile was\r\na ghastly farce. Tears were on the round cheeks of Enos as he hurried\r\naway. Last night he had been so confident and happy. He stumbled, walking\r\non.\r\n\r\nNo suspicious moisture showed on Martha’s cheeks, as she marched over her\r\ndoorsill twenty minutes later. Her tears had dried. A hard determination\r\nglittered in the black eyes. Under her hastily arranged bonnet, Mrs.\r\nMatchett’s face, strained and set, was tense with resolve.\r\n\r\nLucianna did not witness her departure, else there would have been\r\nwailing and much pounding on the window. Fortunately the girl had fallen\r\nasleep. Only on occasions of great moment was she left alone. This was\r\none of them.\r\n\r\nMartha hastened along.\r\n\r\nThe old sign of “Morley, Cowperthwait, Rensellaer and Company” still\r\nremained over the entrance of the great department store—but the kindly\r\nold founder was gone.\r\n\r\nMartha knew that—she had read of his death, and the passage of the\r\nbusiness into new hands. But that old bill wouldn’t be a worry. She had\r\na whole string of excuses and explanations for the lingering liquidation\r\nof her debt in the case of the resurrection of this buried but haunting\r\nghost. Now, Enos had “gone and paid it,” to the ruin of them all.\r\n\r\nThrough the throng she pushed and elbowed. How changed everything was.\r\nHow busy and big. Martha had not entered that growing emporium since the\r\ndate of her reckless purchase.\r\n\r\nFor a second her heart failed at the enormity of her mission. Then she\r\nclenched her teeth and grabbed a passing bundle boy by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Say!” she exclaimed, hoarsely. “I want to see the head of the firm, the\r\nman who is attendin’ to Mr. Morley’s work. Where is he?”\r\n\r\nThe startled lad pulled away, blinked and grinned.\r\n\r\n“Guess not,” he retorted. “He’ll take yer skelp off. He won’t talk to\r\nnobody this time o’ day.”\r\n\r\n“It’s important, I tell you,” cried the woman, fiercely. “It’s a money\r\nmatter an’ I _will_ see him.”\r\n\r\n“Gwan ter trouble, then!” said the boy, pointing a mischievous finger at\r\na closed door marked “No admittance.” “I’ll call de ambulance. He ain’t\r\nno Mr. Morley. I see you come out a flyin’ in jest two seconds.”\r\n\r\nBut Martha was past him, her grasp on the knob, and the door closed\r\nbehind her as he stared.\r\n\r\n“Here! Here!” ejaculated a stout, bald man, turning impatiently from his\r\ndesk with a twist of his revolving chair. “You’ve made a mistake, madam.\r\nGo right out, please.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t,” said Martha. “I’m here on important business—an’ I’ll state it\r\nbefore I move one step. You’ve taken Mr. Morley’s place. You’re the head\r\nof things, an’ I’ve come straight to you.”\r\n\r\nA queer smile crossed the broad face. The man took out his watch. “I’ll\r\ngive you just one minute,” he said, coolly. “What’s the trouble. Talk\r\nfast, now.”\r\n\r\nMartha talked fast.\r\n\r\n“I got thirty-five dollars worth of stuff here most four years ago,”\r\nshe began, excitedly. “Mr. Morley said I could pay when convenient. Now\r\nyou’ve sent to my house when I was out, an’ my husband paid it. I want\r\nthat money back.”\r\n\r\nHer listener laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“Why! Why!” he coughed. “My dear woman, you have a very accommodating\r\nhusband; that’s evident. Four years! What were you thinking of? Madam,\r\nthe account should never have run so long. You owed it. It’s been paid.\r\nThe transaction is closed. We cannot give you back the money. What a\r\nridiculous request!”\r\n\r\nThe woman drew in her breath, shudderingly.\r\n\r\n“People must settle their obligations, you know,” pursued the man patting\r\nhis fat leg. “That is the rule of business. If _I_ owed you anything I\r\nshould pay it. If you owe me, you have to pay also. Such a demand as\r\nyours is absurd. Can’t you see that?”\r\n\r\n“I can see me an’ Enos turned out of our little home.” Martha’s voice\r\nwas stony. “The money for that bill of mine was every penny we had. The\r\nrent’s got to be met before night. My husband’s an honest man—too honest\r\nto have any credit. I can see him growin’ old an’ gray in some shanty. I\r\ncan see a poor half-witted girl cryin’ for the room she loves. These are\r\nthe things I can see. Yes, sir, that’s the worst of it. Lucianna won’t\r\nunderstand——”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” interrupted the merchant sharply. “Who?”\r\n\r\n“Lucianna, sir. Not our own daughter, but most the same, poor thing.\r\nWe’ve been glad to have her, an’ make her a home, an’ never minded the\r\ncost. She was so little when she came to us for shelter, smart an’ bright\r\nas anybody with her blue eyes an’ yellow hair, winnin’ us like she was\r\nour born baby. ’Twasn’t her fault she got queer. We wouldn’t put the\r\nchild where she’d be abused again, so we kep’ her. Now, to root her out\r\nfrom comfort into the Lord knows what—I can’t bear to think of it. Me an’\r\nEnos might get along somehow, but there’s Lucianna. I want that money\r\nback!”\r\n\r\nMartha’s tone became sharp as she remembered her errand. Tears had\r\nblinded her eyes during the rapid explanation, quite forgetful for the\r\nmoment of all save the coming deprivations of her loved ones.\r\n\r\nNow, she winked them away to glare at the man in the chair. His ruddy\r\nface had gone to a dreadful whiteness. His hands were working. A strange\r\nsound came from the thick throat before he stammered feebly:\r\n\r\n“I—I—lost—a little girl. Her—this—one—do you know the last name?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve most forgot—she’s had ours for so long.” Martha began to tremble.\r\n“Let’s see? Yes. Say, it can’t be, your name is Crowson? That’s hers,\r\nLucianna Crowson.”\r\n\r\n“My God!” the stout man sprang up. “It is! It is! Everything points to\r\nher being the same. It must be so.”\r\n\r\nHe seized Martha’s hands with such vehemence that she recoiled with a\r\nstartled, backward step.\r\n\r\n“Don’t act so crazy!” came her alarmed exclamation. “You let go an’ be\r\ncareful. The blood’s clean to the top of your head. Set down an’ behave.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! Yes!” cried Crowson, releasing her, to pace the small room with a\r\nbroken laugh and a fierce curse. “Wait! I’ll be myself in a minute. She’s\r\nmy girl—I tell you. They wrote me she was dead—the people I left her\r\nwith—after the child was cured. I’m her father, my dear woman. Don’t mind\r\nme, I’ll pull up directly. Wait!”\r\n\r\nMartha shrank against the wall, as he laughed wildly and growled\r\nimprecations.\r\n\r\nPresently he steadied, tightening his muscles and breathing deep.\r\n\r\n“I’m all right,” said he, huskily. “You must excuse this, Mrs.—Mrs.—”\r\n\r\n“Matchett,” answered his caller. “Certainly! ’Tain’t no wonder you felt\r\nshook up, if you’re really Lucianna’s father.”\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt about it;” the man sat heavily in his chair. “Listen!\r\nShe was eleven years old when she fell off her pony and injured her head.\r\nI was a comparatively poor man then, but I got the best surgeons. For\r\nmonths my little one lay in a hospital. We had no settled home. My wife\r\ndied long before. Business called me away. When I returned Lucianna was\r\npronounced cured. At least it was deemed safe to place her with some\r\nfamily where she would have every care, and no excitement. Should the\r\ntrouble recur, an operation would be necessary.\r\n\r\n“I found a home for her. Matters were arranged. Again I went West.\r\nLetters reached me regularly for many months. All seemed to be going\r\nwell, in fact so satisfactorily that I, immersed in the starting of\r\na business, ceased to worry. Yes, it must have been two years before\r\nI stopped my remittances, although those crafty letters had grown\r\ninfrequent.\r\n\r\n“I wrote the Harpinsons that I would be East soon and intended to take\r\nthe child back with me.\r\n\r\n“Then I received the shocking news of her death. Diphtheria, they said,\r\nand very sudden. A malignant case, and—well—the burial had been at night.\r\nEverything was done as if she belonged to them. As soon as quarantine was\r\nover they were going to move and would inform me of their location.”\r\n\r\nMartha stood with her mouth open.\r\n\r\n“Did they?” she hissed. “We must have had Lucianna for a good while\r\nbefore those critters said she was dead.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Crowson, frowning. “They bled me as long as possible.\r\nI received one more letter, postmarked Boston—a few details of no\r\nimportance, but I had no suspicions. Since then, my letters have come\r\nback stamped, ‘no such party at address.’”\r\n\r\n“But—” broke in Martha.\r\n\r\nHe held up an appealing hand.\r\n\r\n“I know, I know,” he interrupted. “I should have gone on at once. Yet\r\nwhat could be done? The quarantine—the detention from business—the added\r\ngrief. My child was gone. All was over. Nothing seemed left to me save\r\nstrenuous work and the making of money. I own three stores like this, the\r\nresult of losing Lucianna. Now I have found her, I’ll not work so hard.”\r\n\r\n“She won’t know you from Adam,” said Martha, jealously.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps—in—time,” replied Crowson, stroking his forehead. “Thank God!\r\nI’ve the means to find out.”\r\n\r\n“Have we got to give up Lucianna?” quavered the woman. “If—if it’s for\r\nher good, I s’pose I could stand it, but what will Enos say? She won’t\r\nwant to go, neither.”\r\n\r\nThe man turned his head suddenly, and coughed.\r\n\r\n“We will fix everything right,” he said, gently. “I’ll take no step\r\nwithout your consent. Let’s see! To get back to business—” he smiled,\r\nwhimsically. “You mustn’t think a personal matter can influence our\r\nregulations. That bill of yours must be settled.”\r\n\r\nMartha jumped. In her excitement she had quite forgotten the landlord,\r\nthe house and the gravity of the Matchett situation.\r\n\r\nSpeechless, she drew herself up. Could this hard-headed man be so devoid\r\nof humanity, after what had happened, as to refuse her assistance?\r\n\r\n“Still,” he went on in his matter-of-fact tone, “I’ll give you a little\r\nmore time on it. Till next week, say. Here is the money, but say nothing\r\nabout it. Quite against rules, you know.”\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a wallet and handed her four bank notes, three tens and a\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n“Thanks!” said Martha, counting them mechanically. “I s’pose you want\r\nthis;” she held out the receipted bill.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes—I must have that.” He put it carefully in a pigeon-hole.\r\n\r\n“I’m ever so much obliged,” murmured the woman, “an’ I’ll try to scrape\r\nup something by next week. I s’pose you’ll be ’round to see Lucianna—an’\r\ntalk with Mr. Matchett.”\r\n\r\n“Very soon.” Crowson’s mouth trembled at the corners. “How long have you\r\nhad Lucianna?”\r\n\r\n“Twelve years come Saturday. Enos was sayin’ so night before last. We\r\ncall it her birthday, an’ most always give her something. Not this year,\r\nthough. Can’t afford it.”\r\n\r\nThe merchant figured on a pad. “Twelve. Six hundred and twenty-four,” he\r\nwhispered. Then aloud. “The Harpinsons charged me ten dollars a week for\r\nLucianna’s keep. It was none too much.”\r\n\r\n“They skinned you,” said Martha, adjusting her bonnet. She felt dazed\r\nand tired; quite bewildered at the prospect of losing Lucianna, uneasy\r\nregarding Enos, yet thankful for the temporary financial respite.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got to hurry home,” she announced. “There’s nothing more to say\r\nexcept that I’ll do my best to settle my bill and I’m obliged to you. I’m\r\nmighty glad for you, sir, but the thought of what we’re losing makes me\r\nfairly sick. It ain’t right to say so, but I most wish I hadn’t come.”\r\nShe turned with a choke.\r\n\r\n“One moment,” said Crowson. “I want your address. What is your full name,\r\nMrs. Matchett?”\r\n\r\n“Martha.”\r\n\r\n“Any middle name?”\r\n\r\n“Hum! Lupkins,” returned Martha reluctantly. “We live at 462 Goodland\r\nAvenue—used to be Squash Street. You’ll find us easy enough—good day.”\r\n\r\n“One thing more. It will take only a minute. You have arranged your old\r\naccount. There’s another you seem to have overlooked.” He touched a\r\nbutton on his desk.\r\n\r\n“There ain’t another!” declared Martha, defiantly. “I don’t owe a cent\r\nhere besides this.”\r\n\r\nThe door opened quickly. A young man bustled in.\r\n\r\n“Hinkley,” ordered Mr. Crowson, and his eyes twinkled, “draw a check at\r\nonce to the order of Martha L. Matchett for six thousand two hundred and\r\nforty dollars.”\r\n\r\nWhen Enos crawled into supper, he was a weary, conscience-smitten person.\r\nHis anger had dissipated. What should come he knew not, but Martha’s\r\nfeelings must be considered, first of all. He pictured her in the depths\r\nof despair—forlorn, distracted, possibly “packing.”\r\n\r\nAn appetizing odor filled the house. Enos sniffed.\r\n\r\n“Beefsteak an’ onions an’ coffee,” he commented, gratefully. “Jest my\r\nlikin’s. She wants to make up. Where did she get the meat?”\r\n\r\nDrawing his chair to the table, Mr. Matchett gazed at his spouse with a\r\ndismayed visage.\r\n\r\nSurely there was something wrong here. The display of luxuries, Martha’s\r\nunnaturally bright eyes, her compressed lips, the new black dress, her\r\nair of superiority.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” said Martha. “Pitch in. I’ve got a nice supper an’\r\ndressed up to show you how smart I can be under afflictions.”\r\n\r\nEnos took a mouthful.\r\n\r\n“I—I guess Craddock didn’t come for the rent,” he essayed. “Never knew\r\nhim to skip us before.”\r\n\r\n“He come,” replied Martha, loftily.\r\n\r\n“An’ you—” the man’s fork shook against his plate.\r\n\r\n“Paid him, of course,” said Martha, airily. “You told me to attend to it.”\r\n\r\nHer husband half rose from his seat. “You ain’t right, my dear,” he said,\r\nsoothingly—“what’s affected you?”\r\n\r\n“Set down!” commanded the woman, laughing. “We’ve found a friend, an’ our\r\ngirl’s found a father. It’s all straight, Enos. In case you want a bit of\r\nspendin’ money, I’ve endorsed this over to you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Matchett did sit down. His countenance underwent many changes as he\r\nfingered the check. “Wh—what’s it for?” he stuttered.\r\n\r\n“Lucianna’s keep,” said Martha.\r\n\r\nOn the pleasant days, when the roads are fine, an automobile stops before\r\nthe Matchett’s door. Presently it rolls slowly away. Martha sits very\r\nerect by the side of a golden-haired companion, and an Angora kitten\r\nnestles between them. There is a good deal of laughing and talking, and\r\nsometimes passers stare, but no one in the big car minds. The stout man\r\nin front with the chauffeur turns, smiling at the women.\r\n\r\n“Pretty distressing for us all, the removal of that lesion,” he says,\r\n“but she’s reading little books, now.”\r\n\r\nAnd when Enos asks a question with his eyes, upon Martha’s return from\r\nthese trips, he gets the same old words: “She’s gettin’ better.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Who Pays the Taxes?_\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM H. TILTON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe residents of a small New Jersey village were recently called together\r\nfor the purpose of considering the advisability of incorporating the\r\nvillage into a borough; and the Philadelphia newspapers reported that\r\nan application for incorporation had been signed by a large number of\r\n“taxpayers and citizens.” What is meant by this dividing of the people\r\ninto two distinct classes? This question becomes of more than passing\r\nimportance in view of the fact that the case cited is not an isolated\r\none. For instance, during the political campaign of 1905, in New York\r\nCity, a prominent newspaper spoke editorially of the candidacy of William\r\nR. Hearst for Mayor on a municipal ownership platform as an “appeal to\r\nthe _untaxed_ and an attack upon the _taxpayers_.”\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the National Reciprocity League, in an address at\r\nChicago, is reported to have said that “Municipal ownership and operation\r\nof street railways had become a craze; that people who do _not pay_ taxes\r\nare the most enthusiastic supporters of the craze, as those who _pay_\r\ntaxes are opposed to the idea.”\r\n\r\nThe late Charles T. Yerkes, in reference to the election of Judge Dunne\r\nas Mayor of Chicago on a municipal ownership platform, said: “The city\r\nwill run heavily in debt. Will the poor man suffer? No; because the poor\r\nman does not pay taxes. Men with property pay taxes; these will suffer.”\r\nMr. Yerkes did not say just what kind of _property_ was meant; but as\r\nthe returns of personal property in Chicago are said to be less today\r\nthan they were twenty years ago (although the city is three times as\r\nlarge, with six times the wealth), it is evident that the owners of that\r\nkind of property—stock-owners of that kind of property—stocks, bonds,\r\nmortgages, paintings, jewelry, silver services, etc.—are not going to\r\nsuffer to any great extent if they can help it. Then it must be the real\r\nestate owner, again, who is expected to do the suffering, because of the\r\nincrease of taxes, should there be any such increase.\r\n\r\nDay after day we read in the newspapers communications in reference to\r\npublic questions which are signed “Taxpayer,” or “Property Owner,” as\r\nif that fact should give more weight or influence to their opinions or\r\nsuggestions. Others go still further. A Pittsburg preacher in a recent\r\nsermon denounced universal suffrage, saying, “Only property owners should\r\nvote and all others should be disfranchised.” Numerous other instances\r\ncould be cited which tend to show a growing tendency to consider the real\r\nestate owner as the only person who pays taxes.\r\n\r\nNow the great majority of our people have probably not looked upon these\r\nsigns of the times with any apprehension as yet; but “great oaks from\r\nlittle acorns grow,” and this increasing disregard for the rights of men,\r\nas men, this creating of class distinctions with a tax-bill as a line\r\nof demarcation, on the theory that one small class pays all the taxes\r\nand is, therefore, entitled to rights and privileges that are denied to\r\nothers, is dangerous and contrary to all principles of Democracy.\r\n\r\nOwing to the inherent defects of human nature, no doubt there will always\r\nbe those among us who will expect and demand more than they are entitled\r\nto, but the average American is satisfied with a square deal. When\r\ndeprived of what he considers his just rights, however, he is, like most\r\nother people, inclined to become indifferent to the rights of others.\r\nSooner or later he helps to swell the large army of the discontented; and\r\nhistory teaches that discontent is not only the mother of progress, but\r\nthe mother of trouble. “On the contentment of the poor rests the safety\r\nof the rich.”\r\n\r\nIt is not intended to discuss in this article the justice or injustice\r\nof any particular tax, but simply to consider the question of taxes—how\r\nthey are paid and who pays them—in the hope that we may thereby the more\r\nintelligently render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first the tax on real estate, one of the most important\r\nillustrations of the so-called “direct” taxation which Mill has defined\r\nas “that which is demanded from the very person who, it is intended or\r\ndesired, should pay it.” Now it is, of course, true that this tax is\r\nlevied against the property and the tax-bill is rendered in the name of\r\nthe nominal owner, who is, naturally, expected to pay it; but whence\r\ncomes the money with which he discharges this debt against his property?\r\nIf the premises are rented or leased, are not the taxes, insurance, cost\r\nof repairs, interest on investment, etc., all added to the rental which\r\nis asked of and paid by the tenant? There are leases drawn today which\r\ncontain a clause providing “that any increase in the taxes shall be\r\nadded to the rental.” And yet, during the late struggle in Philadelphia\r\nover the attempted lease of the gas works to a private corporation for\r\nseventy-five years, a gentleman appeared before the committee of councils\r\non behalf, as he said, of the taxpayers _and_ rent-payers.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of the mortgage bill through the 1905 session of\r\nthe New York Legislature, a member of the committee appointed by the\r\nreal-estate owners to oppose the measure said: “The result, should the\r\nbill pass, will be for the real-estate owners to raise the rents. It is\r\nthe public who will have to bear the burden, not the real-estate owners.”\r\nSo we appear to have very relevant testimony to the effect that the man\r\nwho receives the tax-bill, the man “on whom the tax is levied and who\r\nis expected to pay it” really acts as an agent, collecting the tax from\r\nhis tenant and passing it on to the authorities. Is the tenant then a\r\n_taxpayer_ or a _citizen_? As more than eighty per cent. of the people\r\nof the United States occupy rented houses, the sooner this question is\r\nsatisfactorily answered and each of us understands his own individual\r\nresponsibility, the better for all concerned.\r\n\r\nWould not the rent-payer hesitate to cast his ballot for corrupt\r\nmunicipal government—with its accompanying reckless and dishonest\r\nexpenditures of the public money—would he not hesitate to strike or riot,\r\nif he knew that the expenses (the teamsters’ strike in Chicago, in 1905,\r\nis said to have cost the city $100,000 a month for special policemen) and\r\nlosses would eventually have to be paid by increased taxes _added to his\r\nrent_?\r\n\r\nThe United States Steel Company is said to have done much to eliminate\r\nstrikes at its different plants by selling a portion of the capital stock\r\nof the company to its employes. Every man who owns even one share now\r\nfeels that he is a part of the organization, that its interests are his\r\ninterests, its losses his losses; and he is not inclined to do anything\r\nthat will injuriously affect himself. When property owners understand and\r\nadmit it, and rent-payers realize that they are a part of the municipal\r\ncorporation, of the state and of the republic, that the public interests\r\nare their interests, the public losses their losses, that we must all\r\nrise or fall together, a great deal will have been accomplished toward\r\nthe creation of better feeling and a consequent improvement in existing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith says of taxation that “the subjects of every state ought to\r\ncontribute toward the support of the Government as nearly as possible in\r\nproportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the\r\nrevenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the states.”\r\n\r\nMontesquieu defined taxation as “that portion of a person’s property\r\nwhich one contributes to the state in return for protection in the\r\nenjoyment of the balance.”\r\n\r\nBoth these eminent authorities look upon the payment of taxes as a duty\r\nwhich the citizen owes to the state in return for something which he\r\nreceives from the state; but neither says in just what manner that duty\r\nmust be performed, and there are undoubtedly numerous ways in which the\r\nobligation of the citizen may be discharged.\r\n\r\nA very important phase of the tax question to be considered here (owing\r\nto its being the source of almost the entire income of the United States\r\nGovernment) is what is known as “indirect” taxation, or the tax on\r\ncommodities, processes, etc. This is more easily collected than a direct\r\ntax, because the consumer hardly realizes that he is being taxed when\r\npaying for articles which he may use his own discretion about purchasing;\r\nbut it bears most heavily upon the poor, as only articles in general use\r\nwill yield the necessary revenue.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the tariff on imports, for the fiscal year ending 1905,\r\nproduced more than $260,000,000. This enormous amount was, of course,\r\npaid at the custom house by the importer of the goods, but it was then\r\nadded to the cost of the goods and finally paid by the consumer. This tax\r\nis great or small, depending entirely upon the necessities or desires of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nThe higher the social and economic development of a people, the greater\r\nwill be the burden of this tariff tax; as what were once considered\r\nluxuries eventually become necessaries of life, and a larger proportion\r\nof income is consequently expended for food, wearing apparel, household\r\ngoods, etc. Under such circumstances, a man who is in receipt of a\r\nfair-sized income (even though possessing little or no taxable property),\r\nif he buys freely for the wants of himself and his family, may\r\ncontribute more toward the support of the Government than his wealthy\r\nlandlord, who buys sparingly, swears off his personal taxes, and collects\r\nhis real estate taxes from his tenants.\r\n\r\nThe internal revenue tax on spirits, fermented liquors and tobacco\r\nproduced in 1905 about $230,000,000, which, while also paid primarily by\r\nthe manufacturer or distiller, is then added to the cost of production\r\nand included in the selling price, which is paid, of course, by the\r\nconsumer. Not only the man who smokes or drinks, but everyone who uses\r\nspirits in the manufactures or arts, in patent medicines or drugstore\r\nprescriptions (many of which contain large quantities of liquor), is\r\ncontributing a share of this tax. Oleomargarine produced during the same\r\nperiod over $600,000, and playing cards about $425,000.\r\n\r\nAnother very important source of income, levied in times of emergency, as\r\nduring the war with Spain, is the stamp tax, which produces millions of\r\ndollars. The man with a small bank account pays as much for a stamp when\r\nissuing a check for one dollar, as does the man who issues a check for\r\n$100,000 or more; and each pays the same when purchasing an article of\r\nmanufacture which is sold under a stamp.\r\n\r\nAgain, we should not overlook such items as license fees, financial,\r\nmercantile and franchise taxes, which, while levied by the city, state or\r\nnational governments upon some particular person, firm or corporation,\r\nare really added to the cost of production or operation and ultimately\r\npaid by the general public. For instance, during the political campaign\r\nof 1904 in New Jersey, when equal taxation of railroad property was the\r\nburning issue, the Republican candidate for governor, in a speech at\r\nTrenton, stated: “No matter how high the tax on railroad property is\r\nmade, the people who pay the freight rates and passenger fares will, in\r\nthe end, pay it.” As a railroad director, he undoubtedly knew whereof he\r\nspoke. Like the salesman’s expense account—which included an overcoat,\r\nalthough it didn’t show—the freight and passenger rates also include the\r\nfranchise taxes, which tend to increase the cost of everything we eat,\r\neverything we wear, every article of use or adornment in the home, every\r\nportion of the material required in building the house, which ultimately\r\nhas its effect on the rent the tenant must pay. In the light of these\r\nfacts it would seem that, instead of there being question as to “who pays\r\nthe taxes,” the problem is to discover the man who does not pay taxes in\r\nsome form.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are thousands of Americans who do not own one dollar’s\r\nworth of real estate, and many of them very few household goods, but who\r\nhave a birthright in this free land by reason of descent from the heroes\r\nwho pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor for the\r\nliberties we now enjoy; who fought and bled and died for the principle\r\nof equal rights, no taxation without representation, and who established\r\nupon this continent a “government of the people, by the people, for the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nAnd the men of ’61! Have they not as much right to a voice and vote in\r\nthe affairs of the nation as those who remained at home and laid the\r\nfoundations of a fortune during that critical period? Had the soldier\r\nremained at home, perhaps he too might now be a heavy taxpayer, or\r\ntax-dodger. But he answered the nation’s call in the hour of need, he\r\nsacrificed his opportunities and offered his life upon the altar of\r\nhis country. And, if he escaped with his life, he returned home, after\r\nyears of privation, suffering and hardship, probably ruined in health or\r\ncrippled for life, compelled to make a new start. Has he not discharged\r\nhis obligation to his country?\r\n\r\nWho are the men who would rob an American of his birthright, who insist\r\nthat none but property owners should vote or hold office while all\r\nothers—the payers of rents, of the tariff, of the internal revenue, of\r\nfranchise and stamp taxes, etc.—should be disfranchised? Can they show a\r\nbetter title than the men, or their descendants, who do the work in time\r\nof peace and the fighting in time of war, but who may not have been able\r\nto secure any real property—honestly or otherwise?\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States provides that no man shall be\r\ndeprived of his right to vote on account of race, color or previous\r\ncondition of servitude. What right have we to attempt to deprive any man\r\nof that privilege because he does not own property and pay “direct” taxes?\r\n\r\nMettius Curtius said that “Rome’s best wealth was her patriotism.”\r\nYet that patriotism was deadened and destroyed by privilege and class\r\ndistinction, and Rome fell. Patriotism is unquestionably the best wealth\r\nof any nation; but it cannot be aroused or fostered in a republic by\r\ndividing the people into classes, the rulers and the ruled, on the basis\r\nof ownership of property.\r\n\r\n    Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,\r\n    Where wealth accumulates and men decay.\r\n\r\nThe success, progress and safety of this republic rests upon the\r\ncontentment of the _whole_ people, and that contentment depends upon\r\njustice and fair dealing. And every citizen, “unless he goes naked,\r\neats grass, and lives in a hole in the ground,” is a taxpayer to a\r\ngreater or less extent, according to the benefits he derives. He has\r\nthe same interests in the national welfare; the same responsibilities;\r\nis entitled to equal rights and privileges before the law; and when we\r\nhave fully realized the fact we will have established a higher standard\r\nof citizenship, we will each have more respect for ourselves and for one\r\nanother, and a deeper, truer love and higher regard for our country and\r\nits institutions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Their Joke on the President_\r\n\r\n    _Davenport, in N.

Belford,\r\nWidners, Ark., I would suggest that our poor, ignorant, down-trodden\r\nfarmers in the South get posted. There certainly is no reason for any\r\ngrown up man of the present generation not being able to read, and almost\r\nevery daily and weekly newspaper would put the most ignorant backwoodsman\r\nin possession of the facts which Mr. Belford states the farmers are\r\nignorant of.\r\n\r\nI believe I have never seen a letter from this state, but West Virginia\r\nhasn’t waked up yet.

Jones, Parlier, Cal._\r\n\r\nTOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE is one of the greatest educators of the age, stands\r\nprominent in its class, is fearless, bold and decisive, is just what\r\nthe people want. Every Populist should read it and give it the widest\r\ncirculation possible.\r\n\r\nWatson’s editorials are great and to the point. The Letters from the\r\nPeople are very interesting. Would be pleased to hear from our workers\r\nthroughout the United States every month through the columns of TOM\r\nWATSON’S MAGAZINE. In regard to the work in California, we are preparing\r\nour petition for a place on the ballot, and will have a People’s Party\r\nticket in this State this coming election. Our slogan is: “The middle\r\nof the road now and forever!” We take no part in any other party in\r\nexistence, or coming into existence. Let us profit by past experience.\r\nThe people here, regardless of party, are ready to accept our\r\nprinciples. You may hear something drop in California in 1908. We have a\r\npress ready to join us at once. Let us get busy at once. Brothers, the\r\nfields are white for harvest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _G. S.

To judge from observation and\r\nthe star-chamber methods of that bureau one would conclude that it is\r\nrun primarily as a factor in politics, and that the only criterion\r\nfor the grade and tenure of a pension is the whim or discretion of\r\nan irresponsible official. Evidently the system is rotten and needs\r\noverhauling or revolutionizing. From the nature of the service it is\r\ndoubtless true that irregularities are inherent therein, but certainly\r\nthere is room for improvement.\r\n\r\nConventionality, a parent of aristocracy, is responsible for the\r\nmisfortune of Midshipman Meriweather; herein we see one of the evils of\r\nmilitarism; the discipline they recommend so highly is the discipline of\r\nan underling, and this is mainly why they desire it.\r\n\r\nHurrah for Hearst!\r\n\r\nYou give Henry George, Jr., a severe prod in the current number. The\r\nsingle tax is sprung by the plutocrats when they wish to confuse and\r\ndemoralize the reform forces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Nelson D. Stilwell, Yonkers, N. Y._\r\n\r\nThe non-appearance of the February number of your magazine caused me\r\ngenuine concern. I stand by you, every inch, in what you advocate and\r\nteach, and wish the circle of your readers might be extended many fold. I\r\nfirst had my attention called to the present evil condition of things by\r\nreading Lloyd’s “Wealth vs. Commonwealth,” and that but paved the way for\r\nfurther reading and investigation until my present condition of freedom\r\nfrom the bondage of ignorance has been attained.\r\n\r\nI have observed the trend of things for ten years last past and confess\r\nthat instead of improvement and reform, I see a steady progress towards\r\nfurther enslavement. What will be the end of it all? I am beginning to\r\ndoubt the maintenance of society and law and order if the entrenched\r\nforces attempt to maintain their control. God forbid that our country\r\nshould be baptized again with blood. But upon the heads of these “fools\r\nand blind” men be it, who cannot see the handwriting on the wall.\r\n\r\nYour articles on finance and money interest me and absorb all my\r\nattention and edify me very much. Your Magazine has a purpose back of it,\r\nand no one will give a more ready acquiescence than the writer.\r\n\r\nTo be a reformer is to align oneself with the noblemen of bygone days\r\nwhose hearts throbbed for the people. No greater example could be found\r\nthan Christ, whose kingdom is called “the times of Reformation.”\r\n\r\nPermit me to bid you God-speed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Horace C. Keefe, Wallula, Kan._\r\n\r\nI have somewhere said “this is the decade of the three Toms”—Tom Watson,\r\nTom Johnson, and Tom Lawson. They are each or all likely to leave lasting\r\nfootprints on the century, and I’m anxious that my Tom’s shall not be the\r\nleast. I say “my” because Tom Watson stands for all that the country—if\r\nnot the world—must come to, to have peace and answer the daily Christian\r\npleadings—that “Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven”; to be His\r\nwill it must embody all that the doctrine of brotherly love contemplates;\r\nthat is ideal, that is Populism. The other Toms stand for that part of\r\nthe whole they contemplate or are willing to concede from a more or\r\nless selfish standpoint. Your Magazine is startlingly convincing in its\r\narguments and facts—but, my dear fellow, it lacks that dignity that a\r\nPresidential candidate for a great principle should command. I know your\r\nexcuse will be that your appeal to the masses must be in such style—DON’T\r\nDO IT.\r\n\r\nIt is the aggressive intelligent few that shapes the destinies of\r\ncountries, and that will be so with ours; if the reverse were true, why\r\ndoes not the labor class have 50 or more, the farmers 100 or more, the\r\nsocialists a like number of members in Congress? Such a result would show\r\nintelligence and a hope that something would result. Cut out such queries\r\nas—Why the negro maids? Deductions and conclusions are debatable but not\r\nstyle. The writer is one of the martyrs for the cause and has been your\r\nardent admirer and well wisher. There is no question as to the ultimate\r\noutcome—though you and I may not be permitted to enter in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _W. E. Arrant, Alto, Tex._\r\n\r\nI read and will say that your Magazine is interesting and entertaining\r\nin many respects, and I admire your ability and style in showing up the\r\nevilness and corruption of this age, which no doubt is doing good in the\r\nway of educating the readers thereof on the main cause of the present\r\neconomical and industrial conditions that now confronts the whole people\r\nand oppresses the poor that labor and toil that they may share a small\r\nportion of their labor: while the rich revel in riches and the poor live\r\nin poverty.\r\n\r\nI have been a student for several years, studying the economic\r\nconditions, the causes and effects of present conditions. The more I read\r\nand learn of the causes and effects, the more I wonder how and why the\r\nmasses of the people have been so completely deceived so long.\r\n\r\nI have been a Populist for several years. Was discouraged and disgusted\r\nwith the fusion act in 1896, and since that time I began to read and\r\nstudy the Socialist doctrine to find out what they had to offer as a\r\nremedy for the whole people. Through this search for knowledge I found\r\nthat the Populist Party was only a reform measure dealing with the\r\neffects and only a national movement, while the Socialist Party is\r\ninternational, and goes to the root of the cause of the unjust system of\r\nexploitation, and means the emancipation and freedom of the whole human\r\nfamily—a plan and system by which one can not rob another by a plan of\r\nlegalized system of robbery. It means a system to be established upon\r\nearth by which one can live for all and all for one. It means that we\r\nshall establish a righteous system by which one nation shall not have its\r\nhands at another’s throat for pelf. It means a system by which it will be\r\npossible for all Christians to live a pure Christian life and practice\r\nthe Golden Rule in fact and truth.\r\n\r\nI realize the error of having more than one party representing the\r\ninterest and prosperity of the whole laboring and working people;\r\ntherefore, judging between the two, the Populist and the Socialist,\r\nhave cast my lot with the Socialists, and expect to make the fight for\r\njustice and emancipation for wage slavery in the Socialist Party.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your position and hope that you will accomplish much good\r\nwith your valuable Magazine in the way of educating the people. I fail to\r\nsee how you can ever expect to help to finally free the laboring people\r\nfrom economic bondage of slavery, without joining the Socialist Party.\r\nYou have asked the people to give their ideas as to what they think about\r\nthe existing conditions. I have given my views as I see them. I can\r\nrealize no permanent hopes for relief outside of the Socialist and the\r\nco-operative commonwealth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Harry Partington, City._\r\n\r\nI took the publication since the first number and today I have in the\r\nhouse only the December copy, as I want to get everybody to read them\r\nthat will and thereby have persuaded several to buy them, and you can\r\ndepend on me to continue to do so, and will try and get others to do so.\r\nI look at it that I am in the city and can get it at the news-dealers\r\nwith more certainty than as a yearly subscriber.\r\n\r\nWhat I think of TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE can never be told. I would like\r\nit semi-monthly, but I know I shall have to wait possibly some time\r\nbefore that comes. Dear sir, believe me, I am a very sincere believer\r\nand practicer of his doctrine and have been since the Democratic party\r\nundertook to carry the 16 to 1 doctrine under the auspices of W. J. B. of\r\nNebraska. Sorry Billy failed then and 1904.\r\n\r\nHurrah for W. R. Hearst, but the money power is too strong yet. But\r\nhammer at them and teach us to be steadfast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _David Meiselas, Brooklyn, N.

In reality\r\nI can hardly think to write all the praise the editorials are worth. I\r\nenjoy them as I would some classic by Shakespeare, or some scientific\r\nwork by Darwin. The more I read them, the more I like them. They are\r\ndigestible; and talk about brain food—it is the best.\r\n\r\nYes, Thomas E. Watson should be well considered as a champion for the\r\ncause of the people. Either he is a second Hearst or Hearst is a second\r\nWatson. They are so much alike in their fights for the people you can\r\nhardly tell which is which.\r\n\r\nOver here in New York we are having a grand time, viz:\r\n\r\nMurphy telling things about McClellan and vice versa. The big insurance\r\ngrafters howling for more. Mr. Ivins telling things about the “reform\r\ngrafter,” Mr. District Attorney, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln said we should have a “government of the people, by the\r\npeople and for the people.” I must say we are living up to it, in New\r\nYork—nit. We are having “a government of McCarren, by McClellan and for\r\nMurphy.” Great government, is it not?\r\n\r\nIf this is not the age of wonder, I don’t know what. But, Mr. Watson,\r\nkeep up your steady work; don’t forget the Hon. Platt and Depew, the\r\nformer our Chinese advocate and president of the largest express company;\r\nthe latter the champion lobbyist of them all. Don’t forget our generous\r\nSenator Knox (with his generous rate bill). There are many more whom you\r\nshould prey upon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _G. White, Enloe, Tex._\r\n\r\nYes “I will help”; it is one of the very, very few papers and magazines\r\nthat I can heartily indorse from the old Liberty Bell to the last sheet\r\nof its reading matter; the gags and brakes that are applied to other\r\neditors, or a great majority, at least, disqualify them as editors.\r\n\r\nThe things that we most need to know are suppressed and the reading\r\npublic are kept in the background on the most vital questions of the day.\r\nThere is a mighty storm gathering in this once glorious republic; its\r\nmuttering thunders can be distinctly heard. The glaring, forked tongues\r\nof wrath can be plainly seen over the tops of the distant hills that\r\nhedge in our eighty million people.\r\n\r\nThe old ship on which we have sailed thus far is out of repair; the pilot\r\nasleep, or cares nothing for the safety of his passengers; the captain\r\nhas bought most of the crew; the breakers are just ahead.\r\n\r\nI know not how my fellow-countrymen may feel over the affair, but for\r\nyour humble Texas farmer it’s a sad picture. The light that once burned\r\nso bright not only lit up North America from Alalch Mountain to the\r\nRockies, but crossed both oceans and gave to the world an object lesson\r\nof what a free people could do.\r\n\r\nThe same light guided Prescott at Bunker Hill. It was the never-setting\r\nstar at Valley Forge that led Washington to the gate of glory at\r\nYorktown. Is it true that the territory bequeathed to us (“and it was\r\npaid in blood”) is to be betrayed into the hands of the enemy for the\r\nsmall pittance of thirty pieces of silver? Is the money-bag of America\r\nto rule or ruin? Or will those who think and yet have a chance to act\r\ndemand a settlement? TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE is one that is asking for a\r\nsettlement.

I can\r\nsee the place for enlarging, but not improving in the subject matter,\r\nexcept by enlarging and perhaps improving the material, etc. It is as\r\ngood as human agency can make it. I only wish it could be read by every\r\nman, woman, boy and girl in the land. It is such an educator as we need,\r\nand it is being read by a great number.\r\n\r\nI was at our county cotton-grower’s meeting last Saturday and was\r\ndelighted to find so many reading your splendid Magazine. I secured a\r\nsubscriber and have promise of several more which I will forward in a day\r\nor two. I have seen your letter to the _Atlanta Journal_ in which there\r\nis enough exposure of Clark Howell’s perfidy, etc., to consign him to the\r\ngarbage heap.\r\n\r\nIf you think it worth while in the Educational Department of the next\r\nnumber of your Magazine, tell us what effect bucket shops and trade\r\nexchanges have on the price of such produce as are dealt in.\r\n\r\nWishing you and your Magazine all the good that can come to a mortal and\r\na great publication, I remain your devoted friend and admirer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _S.

J. B. one time and I got such a fall I fear I\r\nwill never live to get over it. I am getting old. I am one of Robert E.\r\nLee’s old web-foot boys and stacked my old Enfield rifle at Appomattox\r\nCourt House on the 9th of April, 1865. It looks like a miracle to see the\r\nfingers pushing a pen that pulled the trigger 40 years ago, and yet when\r\nI think of the blood that was shed for this great nation’s freedom and to\r\nsee it being stolen away from us by those money knaves it makes me feel\r\nlike I am just 16 years old. I have nine boys, all Populists. Oh, how I\r\nwant us to live to get at least one more vote for that grand and noble\r\nboy, Thomas E. Watson, for our next President. Don’t you all feel me\r\nrejoicing over New York’s election, but I fear they will not let Hearst\r\nhave his seat as mayor of New York. I have just read Watson’s answer to\r\nHoke Smith’s letter. It is a grand reply.\r\n\r\nYou can count on me when the last roll is called. I’ll be there. Yours\r\nfor reform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _W.

Yes, I am a Populist. I am a rampant Socialist\r\nand I think that most of my old comrades have followed my example and I\r\ncan see no reason why all Populists should not do the same. You know,\r\nmy brother, that the Socialists are growing as no other party ever grew\r\nand they are bound to become a dominant factor in politics in the near\r\nfuture. It is evolution. Reforms do not go backward. The Populists have\r\ndone a grand work, but Socialism is inevitable and I would rejoice to\r\nsee all old Populists get aboard the band wagon. You are doing a noble\r\nwork and to show you that I appreciate it I am going to send you a dollar\r\nfor the magazine and 50 cents for that fountain pen, although I can\r\nilly afford it, as I am 65 years old and dependent on my labor for the\r\nsupport of my family.\r\n\r\nDon’t Teddy, the Trust-buster, make you tired?

Logsden, Moline, Ill._\r\n\r\nI have read with great interest the editorial, “Tolstoi and the Land,”\r\nin the October number of TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE, and while I cannot agree\r\nwith you in the position you take upon the land question, I accredit you\r\nwith sincerity and honesty of purpose. In common with many others of us,\r\nyou are giving of your time, energy and substance, to bring remedial\r\njustice and economic truth to human society.\r\n\r\nBeing fair-minded and in earnest pursuit of economic truth and equity,\r\nyou will, I am sure, accept honest criticisms of your opinions.\r\n\r\nIn the outset you propound three questions, which are as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Is it true that the real grievance of the masses is that the\r\n    land has been taken away from them?”\r\n\r\n    “Will no reform bring them relief until the land has been given\r\n    back to them?”\r\n\r\n    “Will universal happiness be the result of putting an end to\r\n    private ownership of land?”\r\n\r\nTo negate these questions you call upon history to bear witness:\r\n\r\n    “As a guide to our footsteps the past must always be to some\r\n    extent our light, our guide.”\r\n\r\nWith this I am heartily in accord. It has been rightly said:\r\n\r\n    “History keeps the grass green upon the graves of former\r\n    civilizations, and stands as a beacon light to future ones. It\r\n    is the ever-living Janus, peering both into the past and into\r\n    the future.”\r\n\r\nBut history does not prove, as you assert, that civilization exists as a\r\nresult of private ownership of land. These are your words:\r\n\r\nIn passing upon this and statements appearing in subsequent paragraphs, I\r\nthink I shall have fully answered your three previous questions. When it\r\n“became a matter of _self-interest_ for some _individual_ to improve the\r\nland” was it because of his ownership or of his _security of possession_?\r\nWhen you admit that “as long as each individual felt that his parcel of\r\nland might go out of his possession at the next regular division there\r\nwas no incentive to improvement,” you have admitted the latter. “Not\r\nuntil the individual became assured that the _benefit of his labor_ would\r\naccrue to himself did the waste become a farm and the hovel a house.”\r\nWhat was his assurance—private ownership or security of possession? That\r\nit was not private ownership is proven by the tenant system in vogue\r\nin every civilized country in the world. Obviously it is not private\r\nownership that impelled the landless tenant to go upon land owned by\r\nothers, clear away the forest and “make the land a farm.” Then what is\r\nhis assurance? Security of possession—the knowledge that he will be left\r\nunmolested to enjoy the “product of his labor.” This tenant enjoys his\r\nsecurity of possession because of the _tribute_ he has been compelled to\r\npay to the owner to leave him unmolested in his possession and enjoyment.\r\nCould he not be as secure in his possession if the land were owned and\r\nthe exaction made by all the people?\r\n\r\nTherefore, “if the history of the world shows anything at all, it shows\r\n_this_,” that civilization has developed and progress has gone forward,\r\nnot by reason of private ownership of land, but in spite of it.\r\n\r\n    “If, what is manifestly impossible,” says Mr. George, “a fair\r\n    distribution of land were made among the whole population,\r\n    giving each his equal share, and laws enacted which would\r\n    impose a barrier to the tendency to concentration by forbidding\r\n    the holding by any one of more than a fixed amount, what would\r\n    become of the increase of population?”\r\n\r\nYour assertion that there would be no improvement under such a condition\r\nas you mention is self-evident. But this, instead of being an argument\r\nagainst the Henry George philosophy, is, in fact, an argument in its\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. George _does_ propose I shall endeavor to make clear in\r\nsubsequent paragraphs when I touch upon your hypothesis regarding the\r\nprimitive tribesmen.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to this, however, I desire to direct your attention to\r\nyour observation that “the right of each citizen to hold as his own began\r\nwith the laborer who claimed the product of his labor.” The convincing\r\npower of this statement is lacking, because you have failed to prove\r\nto us that without private ownership of land man can not “claim the\r\nproducts of his labor.” As a matter of fact, you can not furnish such\r\nproof because it is manifestly untrue. Before the savage, wandering in\r\nthe primeval forest, ever dreamed of laying claim to any parcel of the\r\nsoil as his own, did he not so lay claim to the fish and game he took?\r\nDid he not so lay claim to the fruits and berries he gathered? Did not\r\nthe tribesman who followed his flocks and herds over the plains so lay\r\nclaim to them as the product of his labor? Without ever a thought of\r\nthe private ownership of the soil, he had produced them as truly as\r\nthe stockman of today produces the cattle he sends to market, and he\r\nvaliantly disputed the right of any person to any share of them. Most\r\ntruly he who labors is entitled to labor’s product, but to say that in\r\norder to claim such product it is necessary to privately own land is to\r\nfly into the face of obvious fact. How many of the wage earners of today\r\nare land owners? How much is added to the wages of those few who are,\r\nby reason of this fact? You yourself raised the point that it is not\r\nnecessary to own land in order to fleece the public, laborer, land-owner\r\nand all out of their earnings. If this be true how do you harmonize it\r\nwith your former claim that it was private ownership of land that first\r\nmade it possible for the laborer to claim and retain the product of his\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nI come now to the case of the “score of tribesmen” of whom you speak.\r\nWhile the score were fishing, hunting, drinking or gambling, the one\r\ncleared the wild land, fenced out the rest and claimed it as _his land_.\r\nBut, in fact, did this make it his land? By virtue of what did it become\r\nhis land? You doubtless had this question in mind when you attempted to\r\nanswer it in the following:\r\n\r\n    “Having put his labor into the land, having changed it from a\r\n    waste into a farm, it was the most natural thing in the world\r\n    that he should claim it as his own. Why shouldn’t he? _He_ made\r\n    it a farm.”\r\n\r\nWhat was his ultimate purpose in putting his labor into the farm? Was it\r\nnot the products which his labor, applied to the land, would bring forth?\r\nYou say “he made it a farm.” He found it a farm awaiting his efforts.\r\nYou will agree that he was entitled only to the result of his own labor.\r\nIn fact, this is the truth for which you are contending. What were the\r\nresults of his labor, the farm or the products? Manifestly the latter.\r\nThese he enjoyed. Upon what possible ground, then, could he go still\r\nfurther and claim also the soil as belonging to himself and his heirs\r\nforever?\r\n\r\nMoreover, you will concede that before this tribesman determined to\r\nabandon the spear and the rod and become a farmer, this piece of ground\r\ncould have been taken by any of the other twenty men; in other words it\r\nwas common. It must be further conceded that in casting about to find\r\na suitable location for his farm, he chose the site which offered the\r\nbest natural advantages relative to fuel, water, fertility of soil, and\r\nproximity to the tribal bartering place. At this point let us carry your\r\nillustration still further and assume that all or part of the other\r\ntwenty tribesmen decided to become farmers also.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as their forerunner, they look about for the best\r\nlocation, and the one offering the best advantages. But it is taken, and\r\nthe others must take second, third or fourth place, according to who gets\r\nlocated first. But these men have equal rights. Why should some of them\r\nenjoy the exclusive ownership and possession of those sites which give\r\nthem natural advantages over the others? Manifestly, they should not. But\r\nhow can they equalize these advantages? Just to the extent that farmer\r\nnumber one holds advantage over farmer number twenty-one—just to that\r\nextent should number one compensate the little community as a whole for\r\nthe privilege which he enjoys. And so with all the others. A community\r\nis forming, with its _natural_ demand for revenue for _common purposes_.\r\nHere is the _natural revenue_. Here lies the fundamental principle which\r\npolitical economists call the Law of Rent. Here reposes the very essence\r\nof the law of compensation. Here also is found the basis principle of\r\neconomic justice, which, traced to its last analysis, as civilization\r\nadvances, is capable of developing the highest expression of human\r\nsociety. Here is the answer to your question,\r\n\r\n    “Will universal happiness be the result of putting an end to\r\n    private ownership of land?”\r\n\r\nIt was not “just that the twenty idle tribesmen should take away from the\r\none industrious tribesman that which his labor had created.” Neither was\r\nit just that he should rob the other twenty when they came to exercise\r\ntheir equal right to the use of the land, as he manifestly would if he\r\nwere left to the exclusive use of the soil, or the best portion thereof,\r\nwithout compensating those he has excluded.\r\n\r\nLet him retain possession of the farm and his products under these\r\nconditions, and you have, not private ownership of land, but common\r\nownership.\r\n\r\nAnother point that you have obviously overlooked, and one that goes to\r\nthe heart of the social problem, is the element of land monopoly. Your\r\ntribesman was not satisfied with selecting the best land, and fencing\r\nso much thereof as he could till by his own exertion, but he fenced in\r\nvast areas that he could not use, and also claimed that as “his own.”\r\nBy so doing he not only enjoyed the fruits of his own labor, but forced\r\nthe other twenty to share their products with him as a tribute for using\r\nthat part of “his land” which he himself could not, or did not, care to\r\nuse. You may say that they had equal opportunities with him to get first\r\nchoice. Even if this were granted, it makes no difference in principle.\r\nThe fact still remains that he has the power to wring unwilling tribute\r\nfrom them. Only one could have the best, and though his contemporaries\r\nmay have been justly punished for their lack of foresight—which I do not\r\nadmit—there is yet another side to the question. What is the status of\r\nfuture generations in relation to this proposition? Are they guilty of\r\nsleeping upon their rights when all the land has been taken before they\r\nwere born, or are they born into conditions which they have had no voice\r\nin making?\r\n\r\nIf your lonely tribesman, for whose welfare you manifest such\r\nsolicitation, had been content with the amount of land he could utilize\r\nto good advantage, had he been willing to contribute his just share to\r\nthe common expense, and had he been sufficiently just to recognize and\r\nrespect the equal rights of his compeers, the common would yet have\r\nremained after all had been supplied. What was true of the primitive\r\nstate is true today in our highly organized society. Shifting conditions\r\nmake no changes in universal principles.\r\n\r\n“Society” (did not) “as a matter of self-preservation admit the principle\r\nof private ownership of land.” It admitted it because it did not know a\r\nbetter plan—because it did not know the Laws of Rent and of Compensation.\r\n\r\nYou deny that “great estates were the ruin of Italy.” “Before a few could\r\nbuy up all the land there must have been some great cause at work, some\r\nadvantage which the few held at the expense of the many.” “What was that\r\nadvantage?” you ask. No better answer can be given to this query than\r\nto refer you back to your own illustration of the farmer tribesman. Did\r\nhe buy the land? You say he “fenced it in and claimed it as his own.”\r\nIn like manner did all land pass into private control, each individual\r\nclaiming far more than he could use. After all the land of Italy had been\r\n“claimed” and enclosed, or that of any given community thereof, the power\r\nthat these land _claimers_ held over subsequent comers is obvious. The\r\nonly asset of the individual without material wealth is his labor, which\r\nis only one—the active—factor in production. Under circumstances such as\r\nthe foregoing, he is debarred from the passive factor—land—and can apply\r\nhis labor to it only by paying tribute to those who have _claimed_ it.\r\n\r\nIn the circle of the human family, those endowed with keen, unerring\r\nforesight are comparatively few. It cannot be gainsaid that those few,\r\nknowing that land is fixed in quantity—which cannot be expanded as\r\npopulation increases, and as demand for it increases—saw in the early\r\nperiods, as they see today, what a powerful advantage they could wield\r\nover their fellows by “fencing in” all the available land—by fencing out,\r\nnot only the cattle, as you put it, but also their fellow-men. Is it\r\nnot plain that this was the source of the power of which you complain?\r\nWas it not this that furnished the advantage you name? Can you not see\r\nthe stream of unearned tribute wrung from the hands of honest labor\r\nconstantly flowing into the coffers of these land owners? And seeing it,\r\ncan you then maintain that great estates were not the ruin of Italy?\r\n\r\nWhat made the “ruling class of Rome, that had concentrated into their\r\nown hands all the tremendous powers of the State?” What gave them the\r\npower to “fix the taxes” and enact the “infernal laws” which you rightly\r\ncontend ought to have been repealed? “Ah!” you say,“they _controlled\r\nthe money_.” By what power did they come to control the money? Was it\r\nby a power inherent within themselves, or was it not the power which\r\nthey derived from the corner which they held upon the _natural revenue_\r\nwhich they diverted from the public treasury into their own coffers, thus\r\nmaking it necessary to provide for the common expense by unjust taxes\r\nupon the products of labor?\r\n\r\n“They controlled the money.” But what is money? Is it the means or the\r\nend? Is it not merely a labor-saving invention to facilitate trade? Is it\r\nnot money only by common consent? Is it not merely a commodity converted\r\nfor convenience into a medium of exchange? You make the point that by\r\ncontrolling the money, they controlled commodities. But if they had not\r\ncontrolled the land, which is the source of all commodities—even the\r\nmoney itself—how could they have controlled the money?\r\n\r\nCan you not see that men divorced from the toil and permitted to produce\r\nonly on the terms of some other person are forced into the labor market,\r\nto vie with each other in a competition that grows keener and more\r\nvicious as a population increases?\r\n\r\nYou say that “the power to fix taxes is the power to confiscate.” The\r\nvery opposite is true. The power to confiscate is the power to tax.\r\nGive that power to one class and what more does it want? Let that class\r\nconfiscate land values, which you agree are naturally common property,\r\nand you give it the power to rob its victim, not merely to the “limit\r\nof their capacity to pay,” but to literal starvation, if they choose\r\nto carry the principle of private ownership of land to its logical\r\nconclusion. For certainly to recognize the right to private property in\r\nland is to recognize the owner’s right to do with _his land_ what he\r\npleases. To recognize this is to recognize the land-owner’s right to deny\r\nto the landless either the use of _his land_, or any of its products,\r\non any terms whatsoever. Thus, in carrying the principle of private\r\nownership of land to its logical conclusion, and recognizing it as a just\r\nprinciple, is to sanction literal murder. Can a system that has this for\r\nits ultimate, be other than a vicious system, even though it may never\r\nbe carried to that extent? It is by means of this vicious system that\r\nhuman sufferings are augmented by a thousand fold and the sum of human\r\nhappiness is correspondingly diminished.\r\n\r\nDo not the foregoing facts prove to you that your statement that “_usury_\r\nis the vulture that has gorged itself upon the vitals of nations since\r\nthe dawn of time,” is economically untrue? Is it not clear that usury is\r\nonly an effect of a deeper-seated cause inherent in land monopoly?\r\n\r\nAs proof that the universal condition of inequality is _not_ inherent\r\nin land monopoly, you say that the Rothschilds and other “kings of high\r\nfinance” do not “buy up vast domains that they may be served by a lot of\r\ntenants.” But when touching upon this phase of the question, you should\r\nalways bear in mind that all land is not farm land. The power of the\r\ncoal barons to exploit does not arise so much from the fact that they\r\nown large tracts of land, as from the fact that it bears large deposits\r\nof coal. Nor does their power to exploit affect merely the miners of\r\ncoal. Coal is a public necessity, and the ownership by these barons of a\r\ncomparatively small area of land places them in a position to place—by\r\nreason of unreasonable prices—a tax upon every user of coal.\r\n\r\nWhat is the basis of the railroad’s power for unrestrained exploitation?\r\nUnquestionably it arises from its exclusive franchises, inherent in its\r\nrights of way.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Pierpont Morgan and others of his class do not derive their\r\nunearned revenues from their power to tax. But whence this taxing\r\npower which affects every user of their several products?—Monopoly\r\nof franchises, monopoly of mineral resources, such as mines,\r\nquarries, etc.? What is the source of the Standard Oil monopoly?—Its\r\nownership of oil land or enough thereof to force independent owners\r\nto sell on the company’s terms, and its consequent power to force\r\nrailroad discriminations in its favor? Where did the beef trust and\r\nother industrial corporations derive their monopoly power? Railroad\r\nrebates—“the big pistol”—railroads with their monopoly franchises. And\r\nthe railroad monopoly and these other breeds will be extinct in an\r\ninstant. End land monopoly and make railroad franchises common property\r\nand the railroad monopoly will be at an end. Had not the Amalgamated\r\nCopper Co. controlled the majority of the copper-bearing lands of the\r\nworld, “The Story of Amalgamated” would never have been told.\r\n\r\nReferring again to the railroads, was it not largely the great land\r\ngrants donated to them by our Government that were the beginning of\r\ntheir power? These grants operated in two ways to the advantage of the\r\nrailroads. First, they greatly increased the wealth of the railroads,\r\nand, second, they diminished the power of the people by diminishing the\r\narea of land open to settlement.\r\n\r\n“Land is plentiful and it is cheap. The country is dotted with abandoned\r\nfarms that can be had _almost_ for the asking.” You say “almost for the\r\nasking.” This implies that he who takes these farms must pay something\r\nto him who has “abandoned” them. Why _almost_? Why not take them, as in\r\nthe case of the primitive tribesman, without asking? You state that they\r\nhave been abandoned because the owner could not make a decent living upon\r\nthem. Then why make the condition of the next owner more hopeless by\r\nlevying tribute against him for the use of a worthless farm?\r\n\r\nMake land common property, safe-guard the interests of all by assuring to\r\neach land-holder perpetual use, providing he pay his equitable share into\r\nthe common treasury—which in each case would be the increment of value.\r\nThen “_abolish all other forms of taxation_.” This will secure every one\r\nin the enjoyment of his labor’s product, will abolish monopoly and the\r\nindividual or corporate taking power, vicious tariffs, and all. This is\r\nall you have demanded.\r\n\r\nYour demand is a just one, but—as I trust you may be brought to see—your\r\nremedy is superficial and cannot be made effective. You must dig in\r\ndeeper soil, else your laudable efforts are vain. The abrogation of\r\noffensive legislative enactments and the enactment of other statutes\r\ndealing with effects will avail nothing. Nothing save the rooting out of\r\nthe mother of evils can possibly accomplish the end for which you are so\r\ncourageously and manfully striving.\r\n\r\nYour work is a noble one, and its power for good is measured only by the\r\nnumber of people whom you can reach. I admonish you to give the land\r\nquestion thorough and painstaking investigation. I trust you will bear\r\nwith me for what may seem excessive frankness. But you are not looking\r\nfor bouquets, but simple, unembossed truth. When I say to you that in my\r\nopinion you have not familiarized yourself with the philosophy you are\r\nattempting to refute, you will accept this criticism in the broad view of\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\nI have gone into greater detail in my comments upon your editorial than\r\nI expected to go in the outset, but it has seemed advisable, in order to\r\nget a clear view of all the points raised by you. However, I trust I have\r\nnot gone beyond the limit of the space that may be available.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A VETERAN REFORMER HITS THE TARIFF HARD\r\n\r\n    E. S. Gilbert is close to ninety years old but uncommonly\r\n    well preserved, having been interested in every Presidential\r\n    campaign since he was a boy of sixteen, and has acquired a\r\n    vast fund of political knowledge, of which he still has a firm\r\n    grasp. He has seen and remembers nearly every President from\r\n    Andy Jackson down—nineteen of them—and talks interestingly.\r\n    He says as he sees things now the political situation is\r\n    just as it was in the early fifties. Then two minor parties\r\n    were dying, and the leading party—the Democratic—was\r\n    undergoing disintegration. Today, as he sees it, Democracy and\r\n    Populism are dying, and the Republican party is undergoing\r\n    disintegration. The Republican Party sprang up in the fifties,\r\n    and he looks for a new, strong party to come out of the present\r\n    chaos in a few years. Following is a thoughtful article, from\r\n    Mr. Gilbert’s pen, which recently appeared in the _Lincoln\r\n    Independent_:\r\n\r\nEditor Independent: Here are a few figures for men who think.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1901 there was manufactured in the United States thirteen\r\nbillions of dollars’ worth of goods. Authority, Secretary Shaw.\r\n\r\nThe average rate of duties upon imported merchandise is 52 per cent.\r\nAuthority, Walter Wellman.\r\n\r\nNow, fifty-two per cent of thirteen billions of dollars is\r\n$6,770,000,000, which the present tariff of duties authorizes the\r\nmanufacturers to collect of the American people each year, if they can.\r\nIt actually enables them to collect a large portion of it—but not all.\r\nThe probabilities are they collect about two-thirds. They collect nothing\r\nfor goods exported.\r\n\r\nThere is honest competition on some classes of goods, such as flour and\r\nthe cheaper cotton fabrics, and perhaps some others, that prevents them\r\nfrom collecting it of the people. So, in order to be fair, we will cut\r\nthis sum in halves.\r\n\r\nWe then have the sum of $3,385,000,000, which is considerably less\r\nthan is probably collected. In order not only to be fair, but to be\r\nabsolutely safe, we will cut off the $385,000,000, and we have the sum\r\nof three billions of dollars—three thousand millions—collected by the\r\nmanufacturers and paid by the people as the result of the Dingley tariff\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nBear in mind, that this is over and above what is collected in duties\r\nfor the support of government. Bear in mind, this money is paid to the\r\nmanufacturers, the capitalist and not to the laborers. Bear in mind that\r\nif this three billions of dollars were divided among the employees of the\r\nmanufacturers, it would give to them something less than six millions of\r\nlaborers a little over $500 apiece. Bear in mind, that this would pay the\r\nentire labor bill of all the manufacturers of the United States.\r\n\r\nThen ask yourselves: Is this state of things the result of the\r\nintelligence or genius of the people? Or is it the result of\r\nmisinformation or stultification?\r\n\r\n                                                            E. S.

It is just what I expected our brave\r\nand noble Tom to get up. Yes, the Magazine is all right. The language\r\nis beautiful, forcible and courteous. I was a subscriber from the first\r\nissue and have sent in my renewal for this year. I have more confidence\r\nin Tom Watson than in any man who has tried to right the wrongs of the\r\npeople.

I think it the best magazine on earth\r\nand the _Missouri World_ the best paper and the most patient publishers\r\non earth. I could not have the patience to publish a paper and send it\r\nout among so many prejudiced block-headed farmers and laborers and get\r\nso little return for my labor. I live in the mountains of Arkansas and I\r\nhave been lashing with my tongue and knocking at these old Mossbacks with\r\nT. E. WATSON MAGAZINES and the _Missouri World_ for one or two years.\r\nSome of them won’t read a reform paper when it is given to them, but I\r\ngive T. E. WATSON’S MAGAZINE and the _Missouri World_ to them all the\r\nsame. On some of them the moss I see is loosening. I am going to try to\r\norganize a club in our township shortly. I am for government ownership of\r\nall the railroads, coal mines, oil fields and all manufactures that take\r\na company to run and government money, and no one man to own more than\r\none hundred and sixty acres of land and not that unless he lives on and\r\ncultivates the same. I will fight for all this and more as long as I live\r\nand have a dollar that my family can get along without.\r\n\r\nI am nearly sixty-four years old and have eight sons, all of whom will\r\nvote the Populist ticket and all be old enough in 1908 to vote, and will\r\nvote the Populist ticket.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Stephen Lewis, Martin’s Ferry, O._\r\n\r\nYour article in the January issue of your Magazine in regard to the\r\nhigh-handed methods of the U.

Pittsburg harbors more scabs\r\nthan any other city in the country, regardless of size. The man who made\r\nthe _Steal_ trust possible operated his mills at Homestead with scabs\r\nat the sacrifice of human life and forced a lower scale of wages upon\r\nthe men with the state militia.

Yet\r\nI cast the vote with as great pride and satisfaction as if I had known\r\nyou would be elected. I know how to sympathize with a defeated candidate\r\nas I myself ran on the Populist ticket for Representative against the\r\nnoted Zuba King—the wealthiest man in De Soto County and one connected\r\nwith one or more of the best banks of the country, and got beaten, of\r\ncourse, but I was not whipped but beaten by the money crowd and I believe\r\nas strongly in the principles of the Populist Party as I ever did.

Scott Samuel, Pawhuska, Okla._\r\n\r\nThinking that TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE might like to hear from a locality\r\nwhere politics “rules the court, the camp, the grove,” I relate this\r\nlittle incident. A few weeks ago, when the town sites of the Osage\r\nreservation were to be opened for sale and an auctioneer appointed to\r\nsell the lots, the news was published that a certain man, Amos Ewing,\r\nhad received the appointment of auctioneer. Now, the reputation of this\r\nman, Ewing, is a stench in the nostrils of every honest man in Oklahoma.\r\nFrom petty defalcations to embezzlement of trust funds, which he was\r\nforced to disgorge, comes the reputation of the versatile and oleaginous\r\nAmos. And so, when it was known that our great “square deal” bear hunter\r\nhad through his secretary named Amos for this promotion of trust and\r\nemolument, it was not long before the mails were loaded with protests\r\nfrom different localities in Oklahoma where the seductive Amos had\r\nexercised his peculiar grafts. Did it do any good? Alas for the square\r\ndeal! When the sale of lots commenced at Pawhuska this creature, Ewing\r\nwas in the position that should have been filled by some one at least not\r\na self-convicted grafter, and _he’s there yet_, and all the protests,\r\ncharges, etc., filed against him are as though they never happened. How’s\r\nthat for the “square deal”?\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, permit me to compliment TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE for its\r\nfearless _exposé_ of moral rottenness in high places. Hoping the good\r\nwork will go on, I desire to share in the glory of the time when its\r\nprinciples shall prevail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Malcolm B.

Surely, if we could get the voters of the\r\nnation to read it, we would have reform, for if any reasonable person\r\nreads it he can’t help but endorse those principles. I have been loaning\r\nthose magazines I received to my neighbors, and they all acknowledge that\r\nthe book tells the truth. I think I can get up a club in the near future,\r\nfor those that read them promise me they will subscribe for it.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I don’t need any literature on the subject, for I have\r\nbeen in the front ranks of the movement ever since 1872. I was a Peter\r\nCooper man and have marched along in that line ever since. Never voted\r\nfor anything else. When I cannot vote the Populist ticket, I don’t vote\r\nat all. There were a few of us that started the movement here in Cass\r\nCounty, Indiana, and we worked hard and spent a good deal of money. We\r\nhad some of our best speakers here to help us.

W.\r\nWilliams of Vincennes, Ind., and a number of other good speakers, and\r\nthe result of our work was that we cast over 900 votes for the Populist\r\ncounty ticket. We felt very much encouraged, but when the next campaign\r\ncame—well, you know what happened to our Party.\r\n\r\nWe are right and all we can do is to keep on fighting. I am in favor of\r\nstaying in the fight until the last ditch is taken.\r\n\r\nI will close by wishing you great success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Knox, Bennett, Neb._\r\n\r\nI appreciate reading your Magazine. I also appreciate your manly and\r\ncourageous way of putting the truth before your readers. My only hope is\r\nthat I would like to have the pleasure of knowing that the writings of as\r\nstrong a reasoner and clear thinker could enter every home of the common\r\nherd so that reason could displace prejudice or party insanity. We all\r\nregret the disconnection of that able defender of the common people, Mr.\r\nT. H. Tibbles, from the editorial columns of the _Nebraska Independent_.\r\nWe hope for his health and his early return to Nebraska, to continue the\r\nbattle for us common people. In conclusion I hope for Mr. Charles Q. De\r\nFrance’s health and happiness. May his labors be a power for good and\r\nlight to the people. I also hope Thomas E. Watson’s health and life may\r\nbe spared for many years in the good cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _H. L. Fagin, Kansas City, Mo._\r\n\r\nIs it not good to feel that the present wave of civic, economic and\r\nindustrial righteousness seems practically certain to sweep every thing\r\nbefore it? There is a quiet, studious earnestness and determination\r\neverywhere existent, that portends certain and tremendous results. The\r\nbest part of it is that the masses have largely been educated to the\r\npoint where they no longer expect to accomplish everything in a day, but\r\nrather realize that to get even a large share of what they insistently\r\ndemand they must begin in the primaries and conduct a continuous campaign.\r\n\r\nYou are doing a great work and you have your reward and will have it.\r\nEvery honest and ardent spirit everywhere communes with and strengthens\r\nevery other such. No more honest, open, fearless man than you is on earth\r\ntoday. That might be better expressed, but the meaning is there—I will\r\nlet it pass.\r\n\r\nThe universal spirit of righteousness encompasses and permeates you—you\r\nare surely a part of the divinest essence. Being a man, you must like to\r\nknow that other men appreciate and approve—and to the utmost. And that\r\nthey do in an ever expanding circle. The days of sophistry, of deception,\r\nof class and special privileges, of municipal, state, and national\r\ncorruption are rapidly passing. The people are becoming wise. They know\r\ntheir friends. They know who is true, despite the tremendous efforts\r\nof a press, largely subsidized to mislead and deceive. But there are\r\nnewspapers and newspapers, just as there are magazines and magazines.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you to keep on straight ahead. You couldn’t stop if you\r\nwanted to. Tell the truth just as you are doing, and as much of it as\r\nyou have space for, in allopathic doses. I cannot agree with all your\r\nconclusions, nor will any thoughtful student; but in most I do most\r\nheartily concur, and I do know that all your influence is for good.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _John McFord, Sheridan, N.

Political\r\ndemocracy without industrial democracy is futile and amounts to nothing.\r\nI had the pleasure of voting for you in ’92, and it is a matter of\r\nprofound regret to me that you cannot see your way clear to step forward\r\ninto the Socialist Party, where all true middle-of-the-roader Populists\r\nlogically belong.

Having practiced medicine for a number of years, I have\r\nsometimes volunteered my diagnosis of the disease troubling some of our\r\ngreat (?) men and I flatter myself that an observance of that particular\r\ncase has proven the correctness of my examination at a distance. For\r\ninstance, I think the main trouble with our great Senate is constipation\r\nof the brain, which invariably forbids the entertainment of honest\r\nthought. Now I hope that some one with sufficient “sand” in his gizzard\r\nwill see that every member of the present Congress and Cabinet receives a\r\ncopy of your very valuable Magazine.

Bott, Grant, Pa._\r\n\r\nTo a constant and appreciative reader of TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE (purchased\r\nmonthly at the Union News Co.’s stands) it does seem strange that so\r\ngreat and good a man as “Tom” should, under the stimulus of praise and\r\nsuccess or the twittering of a pert maid, really become ashamed of his\r\nfamiliar cognomen and his old clothes.\r\n\r\nFor two days I have been searching, here and there, high and low, for\r\n_Tom_ WATSON’S MAGAZINE: always explaining that “_Tom_” has gone into\r\n“innocuous desuetude” and “_Watson_” has stript himself of his old\r\nclothes and donned _full regulation uniform_, but all to no effect.\r\n\r\nAm hoping the new clothes won’t make _Mister_ Watson too vain, and that\r\nat least his relations, Populist friends and host of well wishers will\r\nnot fail to recognize him in his docked designation and fine regimentals.\r\n\r\nI wish to add that it was the “Tom” that appealed to me, above all things\r\nelse, when the news agent showed me No. 2 of Vol. I. and asked me if I\r\nhad seen TOM WATSON’S. I replied that I had not, but that “Tom” had the\r\ntrue flavor and I’d take a dose.\r\n\r\nThere are, I am sorry to say, Watsons big and Watsons little; Watsons\r\nwise and Watsons foolish; Watsons mediocre galore, but only one “_Tom_”\r\nWatson, and he seems to be, God forbid, going to the bad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Robert L. Cooper, Savannah, Ga._\r\n\r\nI have been, previous to the last year, what may be termed a “Tom Watson\r\nhater.” Like a lot of other “pig-heads,” I have heard the other side all\r\nthe time, declining to read or look upon with reason anything you wrote\r\nor said. I was prevailed upon to read your “Napoleon.” I followed it up\r\nwith “France” and “Jefferson,” together with a number of your speeches,\r\nletters and magazines. I have arrived at the conclusion that of the very\r\nfew sincere men of the day, WATSON STANDS IN THE FRONT RANK.\r\n\r\nYou have my unbounded admiration and very best wishes for the\r\nsplendid fight you are making for improvement of conditions in our\r\ncountry—especially our beloved state, Georgia. I may add that there are a\r\ngreat many other young men in this community who are of the same opinion.\r\n\r\nThat your books are being read is attested by the frazzled-out copies in\r\nour public library, and the difficulty one has in securing the use of\r\nthem even for the short time allowed for the use of a popular book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Aaron McDonald, Galveston, Ind._\r\n\r\nI received a copy of the old guard news letter some time back, and was\r\nnot in shape to respond at that time, and when I got in shape to, I took\r\nsick and was not able; but now as I am able and in shape I will send one\r\ndollar to help pay expenses of organizing. It seems that through this\r\npart of the country Populists are dead. There are lots that are sick on\r\naccount of the rascality of the officers of the old parties, but speak\r\nto them about Populists and you can seldom get a grunt out of them.\r\nIt may be a calm before the storm. Hope it is, for I think there are\r\nIndependents enough in this neighborhood to cut things short when they do\r\nget at it. The hardest pull seems to be in giving up the old name. They\r\nseem to think that reform must come through their party. I have asked\r\nseveral how they expect to get reform when Wall Street owns the Cabinet\r\nand Senate. That is like putting the devil in the pulpit to preach the\r\ngospel.\r\n\r\nHoping you will meet success.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _H. B.

Everything is being quiet with us—politics\r\nas well as everything else. We had at one time 500 Populist voters in\r\nthis Hickory Co., about one-fourth of the voting strength of the county.\r\nAs we haven’t any organization in the county, I haven’t much idea what\r\nour strength is at this time, but there are quite a number of true blues\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nYour Magazine is all right.

Think there are no\r\nwords nor figures to enumerate or define the good effect it is having\r\non the one big National party made up of the new parties, Democrat and\r\nRepublican. There are but two National parties now—the Watson and the\r\nSwollen-tails. Good news gone to Canada and the nations of the globe.\r\n\r\nDear Watson, you are doing more good than if in office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _H. E.

This nation is too\r\nwealthy to be ruled by patriots. Wall Street is the government. You can’t\r\ndo anything with Wall Street. The masses have no principle above whiskey\r\nand tobacco, and the churches are in the hands of priestcraft.

Your editorials certainly have the right tone. Your article on\r\nthe situation in Georgia gives us Northerners new light on the subject.\r\nWhile we do not have the negro problem to contend with here in Nebraska,\r\nwe nevertheless have the railroad question to fight over from year to\r\nyear. We must pay tribute to Harriman and Hill, and other Wall Street\r\nkings, besides countless two-by-four politicians who apparently have no\r\nother aim in life than to serve the railroads and betray the people.

Why? Because he is honest, brave, fearless and\r\naggressive. Because he is standing for the rights of the great mass of\r\npeople at large, leading them onward and upward from a Government of the\r\nprivileged few to a Government of the unprivileged many.\r\n\r\nFor the last fifty years our Government has been leading more and more\r\ntoward anarchy.\r\n\r\nTom Watson, may you live long to voice the principles of Jeffersonian\r\nDemocracy!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _J.

The sooner they learn that value does not\r\nexist in substance but in the mind, the better. This is the first and\r\nmost important fact to be learned by the student of monetary science, and\r\nwhen once understood all the relative facts are easy. Take a shot at it,\r\nTom.

There\r\nis not a single fundamental principle contended for by our patriotic\r\ndemocratic-republican forefathers contained in either the democratic or\r\nrepublican party platforms, but both parties are thoroughly Hamiltonized\r\nand irretrievably committed to the aristocratic British Banking and\r\nBonding System which financiers know to be absolutely incompatible with\r\nthe perpetuity of democratic institutions. All of the enemies of our\r\nfree institutions are in one or the other of these parties and their\r\nbosses are engaged in making dupes of the common voters. The interests\r\nof the capitalists are the same whether North or South, and as they have\r\ncomplete control of both the old parties the people have no reasonable\r\nhope of relief from oppression from either. Direct legislation is\r\nessentially democratic and is what the enemies of our free institutions\r\nmost fear. Its triumph will be the triumph of human liberty over\r\nplutocratic despotism. It will restore the Government into the hands of\r\nour people, from whom it has been wrested by the boodlers and grafters,\r\nprompted by conscienceless greed and avarice.

We need you in our struggle for\r\nprogress. You should be preserved for our work in the coming crisis that\r\nI believe will soon take place in the world, especially in this country.\r\n\r\nThis article on the Chinese question I send you contains my innermost\r\nconvictions on that problem and I believe should be listened to before\r\nwe create another problem almost impossible to solve. I do not want to\r\nimpose upon your good nature, but if you find it possible to publish in\r\nyour Magazine, would you kindly do so?\r\n\r\nIf not, then kindly send it back to me.\r\n\r\nMy mind is for what is right. I would like to work for the betterment and\r\nright adjustment of all conditions in need of improvement.\r\n\r\nThere are, to my mind, many reasons why Chinamen should be restricted\r\nfrom coming to the United States. The Chinese are not eligible to\r\ncitizenship. It is not good policy to encourage immigrants to come\r\nhere in great numbers that cannot become citizens. Every man (and let\r\nus hope every woman, in the near future) should bear his portion of\r\nresponsibility to the government. Chinamen do not seem to grasp the\r\nidea of freedom as do the people of Anglo-Saxon and Latin origin, nor\r\ndo they appreciate our rights and privileges for which we struggled\r\nfor centuries. Chinamen would, perhaps could, not use these rights\r\nintelligently nor enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nThey bring to us peculiar oriental vices from which we are yet free, but\r\nthey would contaminate us and undermine our lives.\r\n\r\nEconomically and socially they are impossible; economically, because\r\nthey would undersell the American workman and destroy our standard of\r\nliving; socially, because they lack the necessary elements to make a\r\ncongenial race. It is not true, to my mind, that a race is superior\r\nbecause it can undersell another any more than a herd of rats is superior\r\nover man or tiger and lions over man because they can overcome man by\r\nnumbers and ferocity. The Chinese themselves protected and preserved\r\ntheir civilization from invaders by building that huge wall around it\r\nthousands of years ago. It was Chin, it is said, the great reformer,\r\nas he was called, that did it and the great land today bears his name.\r\nThe Huns invaded Germany and robbed the unprotected peasants. The fact\r\nthat the Germans could protect themselves from endless invasions through\r\nfortifications and armed resistance showed the superiority of the Germans\r\nover the Huns.\r\n\r\nI believe I am a friend of humanity and that is the reason I believe in\r\nthe restriction of the Chinamen (our brothers) from coming here. One of\r\nthe reasons (and I think it is the greatest of all) should be sufficient,\r\nthat is that they are in great danger of being massacred through the\r\neconomic struggles and competition and the inevitable crash is sure to\r\ncome. We had already symptoms of such massacres in the West. The killing\r\nof the Jews in Russia will look mild in comparison. Chinamen coming here\r\nin great numbers would result in greater disasters than we can imagine.\r\nWe would create another race problem. Have we not enough with our negro\r\nproblem? There is an excuse for people coming here whose homelands are\r\noverpopulated and who can easily and naturally assimilate. China has vast\r\nunoccupied lands with unopened resources and its population, great as it\r\nis, is not actually compelled to seek foreign territory. The Chinamen\r\nshould pioneer their own great land. Let them stay at home and open their\r\nunworked national wealth. We cannot blame the ignorant peasants for\r\ncoming here. They do not know the possibilities of their own country and\r\nif they did it would do them no good. It is the so-called intelligent,\r\nprogressive Chinese that are to blame. The people of China are hampered\r\nand restricted by their own ancient customs fatal to themselves. Chinamen\r\nare coming to the United States to reap the benefit of civilization of\r\nanother race with which they have little in common. It does not seem that\r\nthe Chinese come here to become actual settlers, and such immigrants are\r\nnot beneficial to the land in its present state of development.\r\n\r\nMay the time be not far distant when all can go where they wish without\r\nany barrier or restriction. When that time comes we must free first\r\nourselves and within our own countries. We must not endanger another land\r\nwith our own shortcomings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Joel B.

This, the most heartless of all, took\r\npossession of this District, composed of about twenty-two counties, and\r\nlaid it off in territories and appointed an agent to buy the tobacco (the\r\nonly money crop) at his own price. No one was allowed in his territory,\r\nand consequently there was no opposition or competition. They took the\r\ntobacco at two dollars less than the cost of production. The condition\r\nbecame pitiable and laborers who were unable to support their families\r\nleft the country and went to the cities, railroads and mines. The people\r\nbecame angered, and on the 24th of September, 1904, organized “The Dark\r\nTobacco Protective Association.” This association controlled 75% of the\r\ntobacco, and in six months raised the price to double the former price.\r\nNow tobacco is selling for more than twice its price under the Trust\r\nrule. We appealed to the law, but had we waited for the law to protect\r\nus we would have starved. We went after the thieves red-hot and for more\r\nthan a year hell would have been a good cooling place for them.

Listen to this tale of woe.\r\n\r\nAlaska cost the United States seven million five hundred thousand\r\ndollars in the year 1867. Since then Alaska has paid into the treasury\r\nthe sum of one hundred and fifty million. Note the interest on the\r\npurchase. Still we have no means of representation. There are today in\r\nthe District of Alaska 60,000 population who stand in the same place that\r\nour forefathers stood when the tea-party took place. It is a shame that\r\nin this land of the free we are denied ANY means of representation. There\r\nis a mistaken idea that Alaska has a territorial form of government. It\r\nhas no voice from the people whatever. We are peoned. And why? BECAUSE\r\nALASKA AFFORDS ONE OF THE CHOICEST TREES IN THE ORCHARD OF GRAFT. And\r\nits political plums are distributed among the carpetbag grafters who\r\nenforce their presence upon the pioneers who are fostering and fathering\r\nthe country. There is not an elective office in the District. Our mining\r\nlaws are obnoxious and afford the greatest chance for official graft. Did\r\nyou ever stop to consider what a great country Alaska is, and how it is\r\ncontrolled? If I may, without taking too much of your valuable time, I\r\nwill call your attention to the following facts.\r\n\r\nAlaska is one-third as large as the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is not an iceberg, but affords future homes for millions.\r\n\r\nAlaska is in the same latitude as England, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nAlaska has the greatest fisheries on earth. These fisheries are\r\ncontrolled by the beef trust. GRAFT!\r\n\r\nAlaska has great beds of finest anthracite coal, now being gobbled up by\r\nthe Pennsylvania coal barons. GRAFT!\r\n\r\nAlaska is covered by fine forests now being taken up by means of\r\nsoldiers’ fractional script. GRAFT!\r\n\r\nAlaska has the largest stamp mill on earth. The mine has produced over\r\n$22,000,000 in gold, more than three times the cost of the District. This\r\nmine is not timbered and there is an average of one man killed a day by\r\ncaving. GRAFT!\r\n\r\nAlaska has the only fur-seal islands in the world. These islands are\r\nleased to a big corporation. GRAFT!\r\n\r\nAlaska has a navigable river twenty-eight hundred miles in length, a\r\nreservation at the mouth controls the harbor and permits are issued for\r\nwarehouses to two big corporations only, so Alaskans again have to stand\r\nfor GRAFT!\r\n\r\nI could go on giving cases of graft for a month, but time is limited. An\r\narticle by a well informed writer in Appleton’s _Booklovers’ Magazine_,\r\nentitled “The Looting of Alaska,” is well worth reading.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _S. C. Le Baron, Smiley, Tex._\r\n\r\nThree numbers of your Magazine received, for which I am truly thankful\r\ninasmuch as it stands for the principles which have been my political\r\nplatform ever since the Greenback party was organised. It is only\r\nfinancial inability that kept me from becoming a subscriber at the start,\r\nfor I felt very certain it would be a powerful educator, and the copies\r\nat hand prove my hopes fully realized. If it could be gotten into the\r\nhands of those who feel the need of a change in conditions but still\r\ncan’t be made to understand the cause of these conditions, it would\r\nindeed be a powerful factor in the reform movement. The copies received\r\nare out doing missionary work; there is enough strong and conclusive\r\nargument in any one of them to set an unprejudiced mind to thinking\r\nseriously whether these things are so. I have been in this movement over\r\nthirty years, and having passed my eighty-first birthday, feel that I\r\nam not destined to work much longer, but when I see the circumstances\r\nwhich inevitably tend to an enthrallment of the masses, I feel like doing\r\nmy best to avert the coming disaster. My hope lies in the integrity of\r\nan intelligent citizenship and it is through outspoken literature that\r\nintelligence can be acquired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _E. J. Whelan, Tipton, Mich._\r\n\r\nI like the way you write and the way you put it, but I am discouraged.\r\nIt doesn’t seem as though the rank and file will ever see the point.\r\nThe most of them will agree with me about the condition of the country,\r\nbut when they come to vote, they vote the same old ticket. That is the\r\nway they do. Some one gets hold of them before election and they vote\r\nit straight. Only a short time ago a friend of mine said to me that he\r\nthought we as a Government were getting right where Russia is, and it\r\nwould take the same internal revolution to get rid of the monopolies\r\nand trusts that are holding us down. Now I will venture anything that\r\nthat same man will vote with the old G. O. P. and vote a straight ticket\r\ntoo. Now it makes me sick, but I think if they can stand it, I can, and\r\nhave made up my mind to let the whole thing go to the devil. It looks as\r\nthough the men with Hon. before their names were thieves. It is called\r\n“graft” now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _F. A. Jeter, Alto, Tex._\r\n\r\nI am on your side, never have been on any other way and I know that if\r\nthe laboring people do not get some relief, and that soon, we are gone.\r\nYour Magazine has done good here. Has changed hot-headed Democrats to\r\nPopulists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _A. C. Shuford, Newton, N. C._\r\n\r\nIn a letter some time back you stated that you believed the “Money\r\nQuestion” to be infinitely more important than any other before the\r\nAmerican people. You are undoubtedly correct in the view you take of the\r\nmatter. People take the same superstitious view of money that they do\r\nof religion, and how to reach the reason of the average man through all\r\nthis thick covering of superstition is quite a problem. I have thought\r\nover this problem for years and am not much nearer the solutions of it\r\nnow than when I first began. I have practiced caution in my contact with\r\nmen, and to look back for twenty years I can see quite a change has taken\r\nplace in my own neighborhood as well as elsewhere. I have been a great\r\nadmirer of Jefferson and have read everything he has written which I\r\ncould get my hands upon. His boldness in attacking the church is a marvel\r\nto me. Here is the power which enslaves the minds of the people and keeps\r\nthem from using their thinking machines. The result of such methods is\r\nthat the average man is afraid to think for himself. No step of progress\r\ncan be made until this vast machine is shattered, and yet care must be\r\nused in doing so, because man must have some foundation upon which to\r\nstand. Do not misunderstand me, please. I am a believer in Christian\r\nprinciples as I understand them.\r\n\r\nThe money power and other monopolies are allowed to maintain their grip\r\nthrough the church largely. How best to expose and open this organisation\r\nto attack is a problem I wish you or some other man would solve. The\r\naverage politician knows well how to play upon this feeling which the\r\nChurch creates and as long as the organisation is allowed to continue its\r\nprocess of enslaving the minds of our children, just so long will the\r\ncrop of “Grafters” be an abundant one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Sallie T. Parrish, Adel, Ga._\r\n\r\nI believe your Magazine is more eagerly awaited than any other\r\npublication extant, and I think the people read what you write first. I\r\nam sure I do. You are the only writer who has ever made politics more\r\nfascinating to me than romance.\r\n\r\nI used to read your paper when I was a child almost as ardently as I read\r\nthe Magazine now. Some of the editorials appealed to me so strongly that\r\nI preserved them in my scrap book, not because I understood them then,\r\nbut because I felt intuitively that there was something sublime in them.\r\n\r\nNot long since I showed one of those selections—The Highest Office—to\r\na young man—a Democrat and a teacher in the same school that I was. He\r\nfinished reading it just as the bell rang for the morning session. The\r\nmoment the opening exercises were over he sprang upon the rostrum, shook\r\nhis black hair out of his face and exclaimed: “Children, I have found a\r\ngem! Let me read it to you.”\r\n\r\nYour Magazine is being read by many honest Democrats who a few years ago\r\nthought the Democratic party was all it claimed to be and that you were\r\nwrong. Now they frankly endorse your principles and praise your courage,\r\nhonesty and brilliant intellect.\r\n\r\nI must thank you for a clearer knowledge of political questions, public\r\naffairs and economic conditions than I ever would have had had it not\r\nbeen for you.\r\n\r\nYour “Bethany” I consider one of the treasures of my modest collection\r\nof books. Not long ago one of those reasonable, broad-minded, intelligent\r\nDemocrats was telling me how much he liked your Magazine. He said he\r\nread everything in it—“Pole Baker” and all the rest—that he didn’t think\r\nyou had ever written an uninteresting sentence in your life and that he\r\nthought you the purest, most upright man in public life today.\r\n\r\nI asked him if he had read “Bethany.” He had not, but when I told him\r\nabout it he was anxious to do so. I sent him mine. He is a man near sixty\r\nand he read it with all the intensity and abandon that a sentimental girl\r\nof sixteen would devour one of Laura Jean Libbey’s novels. He and I were\r\nalternate day watchers at the bedside of a convalescent patient—one very\r\ndear to us both—but I had it all to myself that day until late in the\r\nafternoon, when the blessed trained nurse decided to forego a part of her\r\nnap and relieve me awhile.\r\n\r\nI think you have done and are doing the world more good than any other\r\nman in it, and I hope that you may be granted many years of life and\r\nstrength to champion the cause of humanity and labor for justice, truth\r\nand equity, and I know that some time your noble life will be rewarded.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you have added the department of “Books” to your Magazine.\r\nI don’t think it could be improved now, unless you were to add an amateur\r\nor young writer’s department.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. B. C. Rude, Lyons, N. Y._\r\n\r\nI am getting TOM WATSON’S MAGAZINE from the news-stand and like it very\r\nmuch. It is refreshing to see one man who _dares_ say what he believes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Halley Halleck._\r\n\r\nI have read every issue of your Magazine up to and including December\r\npublication. It is certainly the greatest publication of the kind in\r\nexistence. As an educator it has no equal. It expresses more opinions and\r\nviews and in the most fearless manner of any paper in the world. Long may\r\nit live and reach all parts of the globe!\r\n\r\nThe question which you are so ably advocating is taking root and\r\nspreading and arousing public opinion so as to bring the monarchical\r\nmoney-kings to justice. May God speed the time when they will be handled\r\nas other criminals, to wear the stripes, balls and chains!\r\n\r\nThat local state government is no exception I got from that\r\nex-representative of the Legislature, the King Lobbyist, Hamp McWhorter.\r\nHe has an office in the Equitable building, and any senator he thinks he\r\ncan use he simply ’phones one of his henchmen at the Capitol, telling him\r\nto send such and such a senator to his office, where he gets in his dirty\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn another instance, when a member a few years ago introduced a\r\nresolution to have the Governor appoint a committee to investigate the\r\nmerging of railroads, the vice-president of the Southern Railroad was\r\nsoon in a seat beside him, making inquiries as to what would satisfy him.\r\nWell, the member was appointed local attorney at a salary of five hundred\r\nper annum for a number of years. The motion was quickly withdrawn and if\r\nthis individual ever represented the road in a case I never heard of it.\r\nHowever, he drew the salary and rode on a free pass.\r\n\r\nThis lobbyist is for suing. He commences with his free pass on probable\r\ncandidates. As I remember, at a station a man who was a country merchant,\r\nfarmer and mill owner presented a pass to the agent and asked if it was\r\nvalid. The agent informed him it was genuine. Sure enough, he was a\r\ncandidate and elected as senator the next race.\r\n\r\nDon’t you think the Texas law should be applied, which is that the guilty\r\nparty is taken out and given a good thrashing the first time and for the\r\nsecond offence double the dose?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _W.

I like your practice of publishing short, pointed articles,\r\nand your cartoons are of the best. Your educational and news summary\r\ndepartments seem to me to be especially valuable. I shall take it into my\r\npulpit Sunday evening, and read from your editorial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _D. C. Pryor, Uvalde, Tex._\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy I saw a carpenter place side by side three pieces of\r\nlumber which he was pleased to call “dimension timber.” These pieces were\r\nsomething like forty feet long and were two inches wide and eight inches\r\ndeep. He took iron spikes and nailed the three pieces together until\r\nthey looked to be all in one piece. He told me it was “a girder” for the\r\n“warehouse” he was constructing. I wanted to know why he did not use a\r\nsolid piece of timber of the same measure. He answered by saying that the\r\nthree pieces united together with the stronger part of the one fitting\r\nopposite the weaker part of the others would give the girder a greater\r\nstrength in the power of resisting the immense weight that would have to\r\nbe borne than if the girder had been made of just one piece of lumber.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing incident I wish to draw a pen picture\r\nof a scene which is passing before my vision: At Washington, within\r\nthe shadow of the Capitol, standing side by side facing the west upon\r\nthe steps of that magnificent structure, are three of the greatest\r\nmen of renown the world has ever known. In the centre of the group\r\nstands the “Immortal Lincoln,” to the right of Mr. Lincoln stands the\r\n“Irreproachable Jefferson,” and to the left stands the “Irrepressible\r\nWatson”—whose mind is the very incarnation of Jeffersonian principles.\r\nAbove this scene on either side, hanging toward the centre at half mast,\r\nare our national colors, beneath which is a life size portrait of “The\r\nFather of Our Country.” Above the portrait in raised letters I read\r\n“Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.”\r\n\r\nNow I wish to impress upon those who may care to read this article and\r\nwho are tired of living under the present system of “graft and greed,”\r\nand to those of us who have always believed in party lines and are more\r\nor less prejudiced in favor of our political tendencies, that there can\r\nbe no reformation ever made in either of the old parties that exist at\r\nthe present time. I therefore believe we should endeavor to secure the\r\nvery best “dimension timber” that can be had out of the now scattered\r\nranks of the Republican, Democratic and Populist parties, and with the\r\nnails of iron and bands of steel bring them together and make of them\r\na girder for our country that the gods of ancient Greece could not\r\nknock asunder! And why not at an early date advertise this new party\r\nand organize party clubs throughout the land and let the watchword be\r\n“Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”?\r\n\r\nI would suggest that we name this “new party” Demo-Re-Polican or so word\r\nthe name that each member from an old party may not feel that he had lost\r\nall of his former identity. I have not the least hope of electing as the\r\nchief magistrate of the nation a Southern man for years to come, and it\r\nis useless to put one at the head of the ticket to be slaughtered just to\r\nmake a Roman holiday. But Mr. Watson can be our leader, and when we win\r\n“There will be glory enough for us all.”\r\n\r\n                                                          “CONCKALOCHIE.”\r\n\r\n(This is an Indian word for encampment, or a bringing together of the\r\ntribes for the exchange of commodities.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Edwin Hyde Nutt, Dresden, N.

We can hardly hope to find an abler, more courageous\r\nand more earnest champion of the people than he. Personally, Mr. Watson,\r\nas I have measured you, mentally and morally, by your speeches and\r\nwritings, I like you, just as I do many a good Democrat and Populist,\r\nwithout agreeing with them politically. The fact is that the late\r\nelections have given us a great lesson in free thought and free action—in\r\nplacing principle and patriotism above party allegiance.

Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: Will you kindly answer the following questions in\r\n    your _Educational Department_?\r\n\r\n    (1) What is the difference between Single Tax and Populism?\r\n\r\n    (2) Is it true that Grover Cleveland is to receive $12,000 per\r\n    year from the “Big Three,” and, if so, why?\r\n\r\n    (3) Why was not the Prudential Company investigated? Their\r\n    premiums are about the same as the others. In talking with\r\n    their agents I find them the same as agents of the “Big Three.”\r\n\r\n    (4) Is Paul Morton treating the policy holders justly when he\r\n    _takes_ $80,000 per year as his salary?\r\n\r\n    Your Magazine is a God-send to the people at large and I trust\r\n    it will be read by men and women throughout the country.\r\n    Thanking you in advance, I am.\r\n\r\n                            Very truly,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) Single Tax puts all the burden of supporting the Government on one\r\nform of wealth, viz.: the value of land.\r\n\r\nPopulism equalizes taxation, and would compel each owner of property to\r\npay in proportion to his wealth.\r\n\r\nThe Single Taxer would put all the load on land, leaving money, stocks,\r\nbonds and personal property of every sort untaxed.\r\n\r\nPopulists cannot see any justice in taking the value out of the land of\r\nthe farmer, while twelve billion dollars of railroad stocks and bonds go\r\nuntaxed.\r\n\r\nCarnegie holds about three hundred million dollars in the bonds of the\r\nSteel Trust. Those bonds are as good as gold. They pay Mr. Carnegie a\r\nregal income. Why should my land have the value taxed out of it and\r\nCarnegie’s bonds go free? There is no justice in this scheme. It does not\r\nmeasure up to the Populist dogma of “Equal rights to all.”\r\n\r\n(2) Yes. To cloak insurance rascality with his respected name. The\r\nrobbers who run those insurance companies simply bought the use of Mr.\r\nCleveland’s name. He consents to play the humble but useful part of decoy\r\nduck for $1,000 per month.\r\n\r\nGen. Robert E. Lee, just after the Civil War, was offered $50,000 per\r\nyear by one of these very companies. He refused to sell the use of his\r\nname. He was a poor man, and went to teaching school for a living.\r\nIn this quiet, modest, but noble way “the greatest soldier that the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race ever produced” (see Theodore Roosevelt’s “Life of\r\nThomas H. Benton”) was supporting his family at the time of his death.\r\nMr. Cleveland is not a poor man. His income is $5,000 per year, over and\r\nabove what silly magazines pay him for occasional articles which are\r\nvalueless. Therefore Mr. Cleveland need not have sold his name to the\r\nlife insurance rascals. But the $12,000 tempted him, and he sold out.\r\n\r\n(3) Dryden’s Prudential was investigated and very rotten it was shown to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n(4) No. He is simply stealing the money. Calling it “salary” does not\r\nkeep it from being loot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                             CHICAGO, Feb. 7, 1906.\r\n\r\n    _Hon. Thomas E. Watson, Thomson, Ga._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: Will you please give me the information as set forth\r\n    in the following questions?\r\n\r\n    (1) How many years must an alien live in this country before he\r\n    can take out his final papers?\r\n\r\n    (2) Can an alien, on declaring his intentions to become an\r\n    American citizen, exercise the voting franchise before getting\r\n    final papers?\r\n\r\n    (3) I have been nine years in this country and never bothered\r\n    about taking out my papers as a citizen. If I were to declare\r\n    my intentions of becoming a citizen now, how long would it be\r\n    before I could exercise the vote franchise?\r\n\r\n    Thanking you in anticipation of an early answer, I remain,\r\n\r\n                        Yours respectfully,\r\n\r\n                                                               ⸺ ⸺.\r\n\r\nANSWER\r\n\r\n(1) The conditions under and the manner in which an alien may be admitted\r\nto become a citizen of the United States are prescribed by sections 2\r\nand 165 to 174 of the revised Statutes of the United States. The alien\r\nmay, immediately upon landing in this country, declare upon oath before\r\na Circuit or District Court of the United States, or a District or a\r\nSupreme Court of the Territories, or a Court of Record of any of the\r\nstates having common law jurisdiction and a seal and clerk, that it his\r\nbona fide intention to become a citizen of the United States. He cannot\r\ntake out his final papers until after he has resided at least five years\r\ncontinuously within the United States, and within the State or Territory\r\nwhere such Court is at the time held, one year at least. He cannot take\r\nout his final papers until the lapse of two years after declaring his\r\nintention. Accordingly, if the alien should immediately declare his\r\nintention upon landing, it would be necessary for him to wait until the\r\nexpiration of five years before taking out his final papers. However,\r\nif he had resided three years in the United States before declaring his\r\nintention, then he could secure his final papers at the end of two years.\r\n\r\n(2) The right to vote comes from the state. Naturalization is a Federal\r\nright. In nearly one half of the states of the Union an alien who\r\nhas declared his intention has the right to vote equally with fully\r\nnaturalized or native born citizens. In the other half, only citizens\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n(3) In your case, living in the State of Illinois, it would be necessary\r\nfor you to declare your intentions and take out your final papers\r\ninasmuch as only citizens of the United States can vote in that state.\r\n\r\nIn Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri,\r\nNebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin, an alien who\r\nhas declared intention is permitted to vote. In some of these states\r\nadditional qualifications are added. For example, in Indiana he must\r\nhave resided one year in the United States, not necessarily in Indiana.\r\nIn Michigan he must have declared his intention two years and six months\r\nprior to November 8, 1904; otherwise he is barred from voting. In\r\nMissouri, if he has declared intention not less than one year, or more\r\nthan five, before election. And so on. In Nebraska, if he has declared\r\nhis intention thirty days before election, provided he has resided within\r\nthe state six months. And so on, several of the other states having\r\nsimilar qualifications. In the states not mentioned the requirements\r\nare that voter must be a citizen by nativity or naturalization. In some\r\nof the states there is a provision that the citizen shall have paid a\r\nregistration fee of $1, as in Delaware. That he shall have paid taxes\r\nwithin two years, if twenty-two years old, or more, as in Pennsylvania.\r\nIf he can read and write, as in Massachusetts. If he can read or\r\nunderstand the Constitution, as in Mississippi. If he has paid all his\r\ntaxes since 1877, as in Georgia. If he is an Indian, with several tribe\r\nrelations, as in South Dakota.\r\n\r\nAs was said before, naturalization is a Federal right. The laws relating\r\nto it apply to the whole Union alike, and provide that no alien may be\r\nnaturalized until after five years’ residence. Even this doesn’t give him\r\nthe right to vote unless the state confers the privilege upon him. On the\r\nother hand, the right to vote comes from the state, but the state could\r\nnot confer this right upon an alien who had not declared intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _HOME_\r\n\r\n_BY Mrs. Louise H. Miller._]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\nThe Home Department welcomes suggestions, recipes, useful hints, brief\r\narticles, short accounts of what women have done in their homes and home\r\ntowns, and brief, _true_ stories of “Heroism at Home.” We are all working\r\ntogether and we want to put into our Department anything that will make\r\nthe housewife’s life brighter and more useful. We, all of us, are the\r\neditors of “Home”; let us make it as good as we can.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery month there will be a _prize of a year’s free subscription\r\nto WATSON’S MAGAZINE_, sent to any address desired, _for the best\r\ncontribution_. There will also be, every month, a _prize of another such\r\nfree subscription for the best true story of “Heroism at Home.”_ These\r\ntwo prizes will not be given to the same person.\r\n\r\nThe names of those contributing recipes and suggestions will be printed\r\nwith what they send in, unless they request to have their names omitted.\r\nThe names of those contributing stories of “Heroism at Home” will _not_\r\nbe printed unless in exceptional cases. The reason for not printing\r\nthe names in this case is that the stories are true and the characters\r\nin them are real people who might be sensitive about having their most\r\nprivate affairs set forth in type with their right names appearing in\r\nit. If we published the names and addresses of the person who sends in\r\nthe story about them it would be almost the same as publishing their own\r\nnames. In each number there will be a note saying that such and such a\r\nstory receives the prize, but no names will be given. The names in the\r\nstory will be left blank or fictitious names will be supplied. Under the\r\nhead of “Heroism at Home” are further particulars.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to worry about “not knowing how to write.” What our\r\nDepartment wants is the _facts_. If any corrections are really needed,\r\nthey can easily be made. We aren’t trying to be “authors”—we’re just\r\nwomen trying to help one another.\r\n\r\nThe Editors of the Magazine tell me that it will simplify matters very\r\nmuch if we make a few simple rules for sending in contributions. Let us\r\nsee how the following will work out:\r\n\r\n1. _Make all contributions short and to the point._\r\n\r\nWe have only a few pages altogether; there are a lot of us to contribute\r\nand there are many things to talk about.\r\n\r\n2. _Address everything carefully and in full to Mrs. Louise H. Miller,\r\nWATSON’S MAGAZINE, 121 West 42d Street, New York City._\r\n\r\n3. _Write on one side of the paper only._\r\n\r\n4. _No letters or manuscripts will be returned._\r\n\r\nMake a copy of everything you send if you want to keep it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=May Number.=—A continuation of this month’s subject for discussion.\r\n\r\n=June Number.=—Our common ornamental flowers, wild and cultivated.\r\n\r\n=July Number.=—What women can do toward improving and beautifying their\r\nhome cities, towns, or country districts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Department this month is something like! The Other Editors have taken\r\nhold! I knew that I should have to write most of it for the first two\r\nmonths, until time enough had passed for contributions to come in from\r\nthe rest of you. Now the suggestions, recipes, articles, and stories of\r\n“Heroism at Home” have begun to come from all over the country and our\r\nDepartment begins to take on its permanent form. Every month from now on\r\nought to be a big improvement over all that went before.\r\n\r\nThe letters received have made me very happy, for they contain many\r\nwords of praise and good wishes for the Department and prove that the\r\nwriters are ready and willing to help edit it and that they _can_. Don’t\r\nmisunderstand me. The words of praise are not for _my_ work in the\r\nDepartment, but for the Department itself—for the plan of having us all\r\nwork together for our common good. It is a good plan and, now that you\r\nare actually at work with me, I know we are going to work that good plan\r\nout and work it out _well_!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some of the letters did not reach me in time for\r\npublication in this number. They will not be lost to the Department on\r\nthat account, however. Also, the final date set for letters on Why Women\r\nShould be Interested in Politics came so soon after the day when the\r\nMarch issue was mailed out that there was hardly time for many to reach\r\nus. The Magazine was very late last month. The Editors couldn’t help it,\r\nand they are trying hard to get this April number out promptly on time.\r\nAfter this we will not set any particular date for letters to be in, but\r\nif, for instance, you want to say something in the May number, send it to\r\nme as soon as you can after getting this issue.\r\n\r\nAfter talking with the Editors and thinking it over by myself I can\r\nsee that it will not always be best to publish every letter as soon as\r\nit comes in. For example, an excellent letter has been sent to us from\r\nNebraska telling how the women of a certain town have organized and done\r\na great deal for the beauty, comfort and usefulness of their little city.\r\nIt came in response to something I had said in the Department. Now this\r\nletter is just the kind of thing we want, but it seems to me better not\r\nto use it in this issue which is devoted chiefly to woman’s interest in\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING YOUR COMMUNITY BETTER\r\n\r\nDon’t you think it would be better to devote a whole number later on to\r\nthe subject of what women can do for their native towns or districts?\r\nThey have organized in a great many places and there are several national\r\nsocieties devoted to civic improvement. The members either do things\r\nthemselves, or use their influence to secure good local laws to bring\r\nthese things about. It is surprising how much they accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe field is a large one and covers many things—beautifying public\r\nsquares and streets, making front and back yards attractive, improving\r\nthe schools and school-yards, securing parks for the people, making\r\nbetter the towns’ sanitary conditions, establishing dinner-clubs for\r\nfactory girls, pushing the right kind of legislation for the community,\r\nplanting trees, flowers and grass, establishing traveling or stationary\r\nlibraries, starting church or public lecture courses, public baths,\r\nhospitals, suppression of smoke and other nuisances such as overhead\r\ntelephone wires and ugly advertising boards—oh, there is no end to\r\nwhat can be done! Of course, no two communities need just the same\r\nimprovements and town and country have different problems, but wherever\r\nyou live you will find something that can be made better. And we women\r\ncan do it! “A revolutionizing power as to all that changes the ‘order of\r\none day’ lies in feminine hands, through the use of what is distinctly\r\nhers,” says that wise woman who, under the name of “C,” writes those\r\nsplendid articles called “Home Thoughts” for the New York _Post_.\r\n\r\nAll this isn’t a matter of theory. These things _have been done_ in\r\nmany places. And why shouldn’t woman be able to bring about public\r\nimprovements? More than half the population of the United States are\r\nwomen. In many places we can vote. Everywhere we wield a great influence\r\nover those that do vote. And surely we have brains enough.\r\n\r\nTo my mind, local women’s clubs organized for some such purpose as this\r\nare a good deal more worth while than women’s clubs organized merely for\r\nself-improvement. Work for the improvement of others—that is the best\r\nway to improve yourself. Be a citizen as well as an individual. Women’s\r\nliterary and current events clubs are good institutions when they don’t\r\ntry to do foolish things or make us neglect our home duties, but these\r\nsame clubs might do the world, and the members, too, greater good if they\r\nwould also turn their attention to helping the whole community to better\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nBut to return to that Nebraska letter. I suggest that we keep it till\r\nour July number and devote that whole issue to the question of women and\r\ncivic improvement. I hope that every one of you who has done any work\r\nof that kind, or seen it done, will write to the Department and tell us\r\nabout it. Remember that the July number comes out June 25 and that the\r\nletters should reach me about three weeks before that time. Write now.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLOWERS FOR JUNE NUMBER_\r\n\r\nJune is a month of flowers, how will it do to devote the June number to\r\nthem? That is a very big subject, so we’d better narrow it down a little.\r\nSuppose we consider only the ornamental flowers common to our gardens,\r\nwoods and fields. Let us all contribute something as to the care and\r\nraising and nature of them.\r\n\r\nWe will not “study botany,” as they do in school and college, but,\r\nbesides collecting information on planting, watering, repotting etc., we\r\ncan get a very good bird’s eye view if what flowers _are_. Nearly all of\r\nus have probably raised flowers or seen them raised, but there are enough\r\ninteresting facts about them to fill a hundred numbers of our Department.\r\nLet us try to collect as many interesting facts as possible so that we\r\ncan have a broader knowledge when we see them or work with them in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWe will not include the plants or trees that bear our common fruits and\r\nvegetables. This is a subject by itself and perhaps we can take it up in\r\nsome later number.\r\n\r\nThough we are going to confine ourselves to our common flowers and\r\nplants let us get a general idea of where they belong in the vegetable\r\nkingdom—in regard to ferns, mosses, mushrooms, sea-weeds, lichens, etc.\r\n\r\nFor instance, which of these is the nearest relative to the asparagus—the\r\noak, the fern, the lily, the mushroom or the rose? The question isn’t\r\nimportant to us in itself, but a very little effort will enable us to\r\nunderstand the general arrangements of the plants so that it will be an\r\nadded pleasure all our lives.\r\n\r\nWhat _is_ a plant? What is it composed of? What does it eat? Drink?\r\nBreathe? What are the leaves for? The roots? The flowers? Why do plants\r\ndiffer so among themselves? Why does one grow from a bulb, another from\r\nfine roots? Why is the seed of a maple put in that peculiar little case\r\nyou crunch under foot on the pavement?\r\n\r\nOh, there are lots of “whys”! The nice part of it is that it is all very\r\nsimple, after all. We can find out a great deal with very little trouble.\r\nThere are plenty of easy books on the subject, nowadays, and a good many\r\npeople who know about plants. Many of you know all these things, and\r\nmore, without asking.\r\n\r\nThe things suggested in the last paragraph _are_ important to us if we\r\nare raising flowers. If you raise flowers you are a flower-nurse and a\r\nflower-doctor. How can a nurse or doctor do much for a patient unless she\r\nknows what the patient eats, drinks and breathes, and what the various\r\nmembers and organs of the patient are for?\r\n\r\nWhere did our flowers originally come from? Are they all native to\r\nAmerica? If not, how did they get here? Were they always as they are now?\r\n\r\nHow do plants reproduce their kind? Do all plants have seeds? Do seeds\r\nalways grow into plants just like the one on which they grew? If so,\r\nhave all the many varieties existed from the first? If not, how can you\r\nget another plant like the parent? Do you know what Luther Burbank, the\r\n“California Wizard,” is doing? Has a seed one parent or two? Where is it,\r\nor where are they? It’s easy to ask questions, isn’t it?\r\n\r\nYes, and it’s surprisingly easy to answer them, if you try. An\r\nencyclopedia will help you, if you consult it. So will an unabridged\r\ndictionary, though it doesn’t say much and is often very technical. Of\r\ncourse a botany will and there are many “popular” books now that give\r\nyou much interesting information. Don’t make a lesson out of it. You may\r\nbe able to answer some or all of the above questions without help of any\r\nkind. If not, take a few minutes some time soon and browse around among\r\nsome of those books and pick up anything that strikes your fancy. If\r\nthere are no books handy, ask your friends. It is as good as a game of\r\n“Authors” any day! If your friends don’t know, you are very lucky. Then\r\nyou can do a little observing and thinking on your own hook. That is a\r\nhundred times better than being told or taught.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that can be made more deadly dry and tedious than\r\n“botany”: there are few things that can be made more delightful and\r\ninteresting than a commonsense study of flowers!\r\n\r\nHave flowers played a part in history? What was the “War of the Roses?”\r\nWhat is the fleur-de-lis, the emblem of France and used so much in\r\ndecoration and jewelry? Do you remember the story of Narcissus in Greek\r\nmythology? What other flowers have figured in history? Do you remember,\r\nin our February number, what royal family had the broom flower as their\r\nbadge? What is the national flower of Scotland? Of Ireland? Of our\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nDo we Americans use much taste in making bouquets? What is your idea of a\r\nreally beautiful and artistic bouquet? Do you know the Japanese idea of a\r\nbouquet?\r\n\r\nIs it healthful to have many plants around you? How do plants keep the\r\nwater fresh in an aquarium?\r\n\r\nTell us your best remedies for insects that injure plants? What plants\r\nare best for the house in winter? In summer? Do you know how to make good\r\nwindow-boxes? Tell us anything you know about plants and their care.\r\n\r\nWould your town or district be pleasanter and better to live in if more\r\nflowers and trees were growing in it? What are parks worth to a large\r\ncity? But there. I am running into our subject for July!\r\n\r\nAre you supposed to answer all those questions? Bless you, no! No one\r\n_has_ to do anything in our Department. We get work enough in our daily\r\nlives—our Department is to afford us a change and relief from everyday\r\nwork. It isn’t any the less play because we can profit by it and learn\r\nthings from it. And perhaps it will teach us how to turn some of our\r\ndaily work into an interesting kind of game (if we haven’t learned how to\r\ndo that already) and yet do it better than we did before. The questions\r\nare merely to suggest things for our June number. Pick out a few that\r\ninterest you and find out something about them or tell us what you know\r\nalready. Mercy, no! You don’t _have_ to! But you’re likely to find a\r\nlittle of it amusing and pleasant and to add a bit more interest to your\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIf we only know how, and try, we can make our lives _so_ much more\r\npleasant for ourselves and those about us! It is very easy. And it\r\ndoesn’t take much time or brains or money or anything else, except\r\n“gumption” enough to try.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For May, June and July_\r\n\r\nSo for May we will continue our discussion of woman’s interest in\r\npolitics; in June, our common, ornamental flowers, wild and cultivated;\r\nin July, what women can do toward improving and beautifying their native\r\ntown or district.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Suggest Future Subjects_\r\n\r\nI have asked the printer to put the above announcement at the beginning\r\nof our Department for the sake of convenience. I believe it will be a\r\ngood plan to announce our monthly subjects three numbers ahead all the\r\ntime, so that we can have plenty of time to think them over in advance,\r\nmake suggestions and send in information.\r\n\r\nNow, what shall we have for the August number? If there is something you\r\nare interested in or want to talk about or hear others talk about, send\r\nit in to the Department. Do this not only for August but for all the\r\nfollowing numbers. I chose the subject for the first few months in order\r\nto get our plan started. Now I have had more than my share of “chooses”\r\nand all the others are for you to select. It may be that I can arrange\r\nto have a special prize offered each month for the best monthly topic\r\nsuggested. I’ll try.\r\n\r\n\r\n_WHY SHOULD WOMEN BE INTERESTED IN POLITICS?_\r\n\r\nThere is one answer that is sufficient in itself—Because her daily bread\r\ndepends upon politics!\r\n\r\nIs there any particular reason why she should go about her daily work\r\nlike a mole and pay no attention to the things that make her life hard or\r\nmake it easy? Doesn’t she suffer from unjust laws and bad conditions and\r\nprofit by just laws and good conditions as much as her husband does, or\r\nher father, son, or brother?\r\n\r\nSomeone objects that politics is for the man to take care of; housework\r\nis woman’s sphere. That isn’t quite a fair statement of the case. The\r\nman’s part in the care of the family is his business: the woman’s is her\r\nhousework. Politics is a third question. Why should the man alone have\r\nthis to see to? A good many objections will be offered to this, too, _but\r\nall these objections will boil down to just one thing_—because he _does_!\r\nAnd that isn’t any reason at all. If you were asked why little children\r\nshould work in factories and kill their health and youth, would you\r\nconsider “Because they do!” a sufficient or sensible reason?\r\n\r\nThe men say that when women discuss anything they never get anywhere\r\nbecause they fail to _define_ the terms they use, and may all be talking\r\nabout different things under the same name. I think men make this mistake\r\nabout as much as we do, but let’s be on the safe side this time and\r\ndefine just what we mean by “politics.”\r\n\r\nPolitics in our country have become so disreputable that we are likely to\r\nfeel that having anything to do with them is bad taste or even degrading.\r\nIt is natural to feel that way, but is it silly, nevertheless. It is\r\nbad taste, or even degrading, to have anything to do with a notorious\r\ncriminal, but _not if you are making him better_ instead of letting him\r\nmake you worse! This is particularly true when it is partly _your fault\r\nthat he became a criminal_!\r\n\r\nNow as to the definition of politics. The Standard Dictionary gives this:\r\n\r\n    1. The branch of civics that treats of the principles of civil\r\n    government and the conduct of state affairs; the administration\r\n    of public affairs in the interest of the peace, prosperity,\r\n    and safety of the state; statecraft; political science: in a\r\n    wide sense embracing the _science_ of _government_ and _civil\r\n    polity_.\r\n\r\n    2. Political affairs in a party sense; the administration of\r\n    public affairs or the conduct of political matters so as to\r\n    carry elections and secure public offices; party intrigues;\r\n    political wire-pulling; trickery.\r\n\r\n    3. A man’s political sentiments, party preference, or\r\n    connection.\r\n\r\nThe word, then, has three shades of meaning. The third one we need not\r\nbother with, since it merely means any man’s opinion on the things given\r\nunder Number 1 and Number 2.\r\n\r\nNow let’s contrast Number 1 and Number 2. There are some large words\r\nthere, but if we take it a piece at a time we shall at least see that\r\nthere is a tremendous difference between the two shades of meaning.\r\n\r\nIn Number 1 politics means the fair and unprejudiced study of how a\r\nnation should be governed, but in Number 2 politics means _How much can\r\nyou get out of it regardless of the general welfare_!\r\n\r\nIn Number 1 the object is the “peace, prosperity and safety of the\r\nstate,” but in Number 2 the object is to “carry elections and secure\r\npublic offices”—“party intrigues; political wire-pulling; trickery.”\r\n\r\nIt is Number 1 we are considering primarily. True, if our daily bread\r\ndepends on politics, we are also interested in “how much we can get out\r\nof it,” but we mean by this how much we can get justly and honestly—our\r\nequal share _along with everyone else_. “Equal rights to all, special\r\nprivileges to none.”\r\n\r\nNo, no! I’m not advocating the People’s Party principles just because\r\nI quote one of their watchwords. That motto is not theirs alone, but\r\nthat of every honest citizen, no matter to what party he belongs. It is\r\nmerely an expression of the principles set forth in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Whatever I may believe personally, it is no part of my\r\nbusiness to plead the cause of any political party in our Department. We\r\nhave nothing to do with parties. Our object is to consider how our nation\r\nis governed and how it _should_ be governed—national, state, county,\r\ntownship and city governments, under whatever names these divisions may\r\nbe called in different places.\r\n\r\nWe are primarily concerned with definition Number 1. We want to know how\r\nour nation should be governed. After that we will consider Number 2, and\r\nsee how it _is_ governed.\r\n\r\nNow, considering the awful amount of writing and talking there is about\r\npolitics, the infinite number of questions there are to decide, and the\r\nunending difference of opinion on these questions, we can see at the\r\noutset that we can’t decide it all in two numbers of our Department. Nor\r\nin a hundred. We are not going to try to. All we want is an intelligent\r\nidea of the general situation and of our duty in the matter.\r\n\r\nWhat is government at bottom? In the beginning there was no government\r\nor organization of any kind, not even the family organization. Each man\r\nor woman lived his or her own life separate from all others. The first\r\norganization came about when a man and woman decided to live together\r\nand raise children. They soon found that when they had a child to take\r\ncare of they could not go on independently of each other as they had\r\nbefore. They had two things to do—to care for the baby and keep it safe\r\nevery minute from wild beasts and other people, and to secure food for\r\nthemselves and their child. If they both went hunting for food there was\r\nno one to watch the baby; if they both watched the baby, there was no\r\nway of getting food. They saw that they had to have some _arrangement_.\r\nThey had to _divide_ the labor. So the woman tended the baby and the man\r\nwent hunting for all three. Each of them gave up a little of the former\r\nindependence and received a new thing in _return_—help from another\r\nperson. Thus the “family” began. It was the first step towards _society_\r\nand government. They gave up part of their freedom _in return for help_\r\nfrom others.\r\n\r\nPeople lived by hunting animals and gathering fruits and berries at\r\nfirst. If a man laid by any food for his family, another man was likely\r\nto take it away while he was away hunting. He found it pretty hard to\r\nhave to do anything himself and he at odds with other men. Pretty soon\r\nit dawned on him that it would pay to make some “arrangement” with\r\nthose other men. He wouldn’t rob them, if they didn’t rob him. Later he\r\narranged with a few of them to keep their families close together so that\r\nsome of the men could protect them while the other men hunted for all.\r\nIn some such way began the “town.” Each of them gave up a part of his\r\nfreedom _in return_ for help from others.\r\n\r\nWhen many towns had sprung up these towns began to see they could to\r\nadvantage make “arrangements” among themselves (just as individual men\r\nhad done) for protection and other purposes. Thus the “state” or country\r\ncame into existence. Each town gave up part of its “independence” _in\r\nreturn_ for help from other towns.\r\n\r\nThus “society” was formed and grew more and more complex. Of course,\r\nI have only sketched the process in a very general way, but the idea\r\nis there. The one point we have to consider is that no one of these\r\narrangements or institutions—the family, town and state—would be possible\r\n_unless_ every member gave up part of his original freedom _in return_\r\nfor help from others. A _bargain_ has to be made. For instance, the\r\ndifferent men and their families each made a bargain with the whole\r\nnumber to give up part of their freedom, time and energy to the band. _In\r\nreturn_ each was to receive his share of the freedom, time and energy the\r\nothers had given to the band or town. Each man made a _bargain_ with the\r\ntown. He owed the town something: the town owed him something.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of government, and that is the arrangement at the\r\nbottom of any government to this day. Every government (town, county,\r\nstate or national) is just a bargain between the various individuals and\r\nall of them taken together. Each owes something to all: all owe something\r\nto each.\r\n\r\nThe point is, in each case, is this bargain a _fair_ one? Does the\r\nindividual give up more than he receives in _return_?\r\n\r\nIn olden times the average individual did give up far more than he got\r\nin return. Often he didn’t get much besides protection against some\r\nother government. Yet for this he frequently had to give up _nearly all_\r\nhis freedom, time and energy. A few individuals gained control of the\r\ngovernment and, though they might not contribute as much as the others,\r\ntook most of what the others gave for the use of the whole number,\r\ncalling themselves kings, or dukes or emperors. The mass of the people\r\nforgot that originally the “government” meant _all_ the people. They came\r\nto consider the few who had gained control of the government as _the\r\ngovernment itself_. That is, they let themselves be cheated out of their\r\nshare in it.\r\n\r\nOur Declaration of Independence was one of the things that resulted when,\r\nafter centuries of misrule and suffering, the mass of the people began\r\nto wake up to the fact that they had been cheated all that time under a\r\nbargain which had originally been fair. They had been giving more than\r\nthey got in return.\r\n\r\nIn an absolutely fair government every individual would receive just as\r\nmuch as he gave and give just as much as he received. A modern government\r\nis so vast and so complex that it would be hard to measure each man’s\r\nshare exactly, but the nearer any government comes to that, the better\r\nand fairer it is. England, for example, comes nearer to that ideal than\r\ndoes Russia; Russia nearer than Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble in Russia is that the mass of the people have to give\r\nmore than they receive. A comparative few have gained possession of\r\nthe government and each takes a very, very large share of what _all_\r\ncontribute, leaving almost no share at all for the majority.\r\n\r\nOf course it is almost impossible to trace out just what each Russian\r\npeasant gives up to the government, and what he receives in return.\r\nWithout a government of some kind he could not produce or hold anything\r\nexcept by force against his fellows—land, goods, money, family, all would\r\nbe _totally_ insecure. As it is, he does get _some_ security in these\r\nrespects. In return he gives practically _all_ his freedom, time and\r\nenergy. On the other hand, a Grand Duke may give up to his country hardly\r\nany freedom, time and energy, and yet be rolling in wealth. Something is\r\nwrong. It is not a fair bargain. It is not a good government.\r\n\r\nHow about _our_ government? Is it a fair bargain?\r\n\r\nModern civilization is very complex. No two men can really give just the\r\nsame amount to the common country, since all men differ in ability. But\r\nthe country asks only certain things from its individuals. To be fair\r\nthe point is to _ask the same from all_. The country gives only certain\r\nthings to its individuals: the point is to _give the same to all_. Our\r\ncountry doesn’t demand military service in time of peace, as do many\r\nother countries. And, in _return_, it doesn’t give us a tremendous\r\nstanding army. If it _did_ demand military service, to be fair it would\r\nhave to make the demand equally of _all_ able to bear arms. If it _did_\r\ngive us a big standing army, to be fair it would have to use this army to\r\nprotect us _all_ equally.\r\n\r\nIf our country taxes certain goods, it must tax them everywhere—not for\r\none man and not for the next. If there is a tax of one cent on every bale\r\nof a certain commodity, each man should pay one cent for every bale he\r\nowns. If there is a tax of one cent on every dollar, each man should pay\r\none cent for every dollar he owns.\r\n\r\nIs this the case in the United States?\r\n\r\nIf the Government gives certain privileges to a few men, it should give\r\nthe same to all. Is this always done in our country?\r\n\r\nOf course all may not always want a certain privilege. It is open to all,\r\nbut only a few use it. Is this all that is required of the Government?\r\nOr, since the Government has nevertheless given some of the general fund\r\nto only a few, should these few make some adequate _return_ for what\r\nthey have used from the common property? Is this always done in our\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nAsk yourself similar questions about every case that comes up. What I\r\nhave said doesn’t pretend to “explain politics,” but it ought to give\r\neveryone a test or basis to refer everything back to. Ask yourself\r\nwhether any law or custom is a _fair bargain_. You can tell well enough\r\nwhen you deal with the grocer or the milkman whether you are getting a\r\nfair bargain. Try to in these other matters.\r\n\r\nBut to come back to why women should take an interest in politics. One\r\nreason has been suggested—that her daily bread is affected by them.\r\nAnother has been hinted at—that it is partly your fault that politics as\r\npracticed in this country are corrupt (definition No. 2). Since we are to\r\ndevote the next number of our Department to this same question, we will\r\ndo little now in this issue except suggest reasons and ask questions. I’m\r\nnot going to do all the expressing of opinion just because I happen to\r\nhave the chance all to myself this month. By next month I hope there will\r\nbe letters and opinions from a great many of you.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of our country women can vote and it is likely that some\r\nday they will do so everywhere. When the country or state gives her\r\nthe right to vote does that put her under any obligation to do or give\r\nanything in return for this privilege?\r\n\r\nWho gives women (or men) the right to vote—the city, state or country?\r\n\r\nIs it fair to give it to some women and not to all? Is it fair to give it\r\nto men and not to women?\r\n\r\nWould politics be purer if women took more interest in them? If women\r\nvoted?\r\n\r\nIn those places where women cannot vote what can they do towards securing\r\ngood government? Can they do anything through their husbands, brothers\r\nand fathers? Through their neighbors? Through their own children? Can\r\nthey do anything through the church? The schools? Last year, when\r\nPhiladelphia threw off boss-rule, what was the method that succeeded in\r\nmaking the corrupt politicians surrender after all other methods had\r\nfailed?\r\n\r\nCan you tell the Department of any instance where the women have brought\r\nabout, or helped to bring about, reforms in town, country, state or\r\nnational government even when they were not allowed to vote?\r\n\r\nDo you remember the saying that “the hand that rocks the cradle rules the\r\nworld”? How much truth is there in it?\r\n\r\nIf you had a really intelligent idea of politics as they should be and as\r\nthey are, would it bring you into closer touch with the men-folks of your\r\nfamily? Would it broaden your horizon? Would it interfere with household\r\nduties? Would it make you a better citizen? Could you accomplish real\r\ngood by having this knowledge?\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way of acquiring an intelligent idea of the subject,\r\nit you haven’t one already? Take the opinion of those around you? Read\r\nweighty and technical books and articles? Read first a very simple book\r\non civics—on the organization of our Government? Would it be a good plan\r\nto read your boy’s school text-book on this subject?\r\n\r\nCan some one point out a few articles in the numbers of this Magazine\r\nwhich make their point very clear and are easy enough for anyone to\r\nunderstand? Send the Department the names of a few that appealed to you,\r\nso that some more of us can venture on them. Similar articles in other\r\nmagazines which the average woman can grasp without a previous extensive\r\nknowledge of politics or political economy? Books?\r\n\r\nCan you decide a question until you have heard both sides of it?\r\n\r\nIs it safe to believe all you read, or does it pay to consider when you\r\nread it, who wrote it, what personal or party reason he may have had for\r\nwriting it?\r\n\r\nConsider your local newspaper. Do you know the difference between the\r\n“set” matter and the “plate” matter and the “ready-print” matter in its\r\npages? Why is this difference _very_ important in deciding as to the\r\nvalue of an article in that paper? Who writes set matter? Has he “any\r\nfish to fry” when he writes? Who writes plate and ready-print matter?\r\nHas he any fish to fry? With a little care you can tell these three\r\nkinds of printed matter apart in your local paper. (Ready-print matter\r\nis used only in some country weeklies and dailies and some other small\r\nlocal papers. It can be “spotted” by noticing what pages of the paper\r\nalways have it. Unfold the paper and lay it flat on the floor. If it is\r\nready-print and has few pages enough to make only one sheet, all of the\r\npages on one side will be ready-print. There won’t be any local articles\r\nor items in the print. Both ready-print and plate are in different type\r\nfrom set matter.) If a corrupt man or corrupt men wrote the ready-print\r\nand plate could they wield a vast influence? More than by writing the set\r\nmatter? It is well worth thinking about.\r\n\r\nAre there many magazines or papers that are not controlled by political\r\nor business interests? How much can you believe in a publication\r\ncontrolled in that way?\r\n\r\nThe voters of the country are divided into several political parties.\r\nWould it be better or worse if there were no regular parties and every\r\nvoter voted independently?\r\n\r\nWhat is a real democracy? Is the United States a real democracy now? Why?\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by direct legislation—the initiative, referendum, recall\r\nand imperative mandate? Big words, but they stand for things worth\r\nknowing about and having an opinion on. And they are easy enough to\r\nunderstand. Would these things tend toward real democracy? Have they been\r\ntried in actual practice? If so, have they proved a success? Why? What\r\neffect would they have on the whole party system?\r\n\r\nThere, I think that is enough questions for one person to ask. Someone is\r\nlikely to ask me a question in return—_How_ do politics affect our daily\r\nbread? Well, there are several hundred answers to that. Let’s each of us\r\nsuggest for the May number one or more ways that politics (according to\r\nboth definition No. 1 and definition No. 2) affect our daily living.\r\n\r\nWe are not going to try to become experts in politics, but we do want to\r\nhave an intelligent general idea of them. It is our _duty_. In our May\r\nnumber I hope to have many opinions from women all over the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _THE INTEREST OF EVERYDAY THINGS._]\r\n\r\nWe had a glimpse last month at some of the interesting things concerned\r\nin bread and bread-making. The house is full of things we have known so\r\nlong that we scarcely think of them except as parts of the daily routine,\r\nbut which, if we turn our attention to them, prove veritable mines of\r\ninformation, history, travel and even romance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sponges_\r\n\r\nA sponge is the skeleton of a very, very, tiny animal, or rather of a\r\ncolony of thousands of such animals that live under water. When the\r\nlittle animals die they leave behind them this network of elastic fibers\r\nthat they have built up. For a long time it was thought that sponges\r\nwere plants, and even now scientists know really very little about\r\nthese little animals. You have noticed how many kinds of sponges there\r\nare. These different varieties are caused partly by differences in\r\ntemperature and chemical composition of the water and partly by the fact\r\nthat there are more than one species or variety of the animal itself.\r\nThere is no need to enumerate all the kinds of sponges from the fine,\r\nsoft ones used in surgical operations to the big, coarse ones used for\r\nwashing carriages. Nearly all the sponges inhabit salt water and the\r\nbest ones come from the Mediterranean, particularly the Levant or that\r\neastern part of the Mediterranean bounded by Syria, Asia Minor and the\r\nHoly Land and Egypt. Others are found in the waters around Florida and\r\nin those near Australia. The sponges are secured by means of native\r\ndivers. In some places these men work all day long from sunrise to sunset\r\nthrough six months of the year, resting during the winter. The work\r\nis, of course, very hard and few of them reach old age. Often they are\r\ntreated with inhuman cruelty by their employers and many are killed by\r\nsharks. Particularly in Florida there have been attempts made to raise\r\nsponges artificially, but though it is easy to secure the spawn of the\r\ntiny animals and succeed in getting them to attach their little colonies\r\nto stones, coral or other objects under water, the sponges never reach\r\nany considerable size and are commercially useless. They have also tried\r\nto propagate them by cuttings or slips, but here arises the difficulty\r\nof making the cuttings attach themselves to other objects, which is\r\nnecessary to their development. And the little animals themselves, they\r\ngo right on very quietly drinking in water and getting all they need\r\nfrom it—air, food and drink—whether they are off the coast of Europe,\r\nAsia, Africa, America or Australia or in a little glass aquarium being\r\nlooked at through a microscope by a dried-up old man with spectacles and\r\nside-whiskers. And we use the sponges.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maize_\r\n\r\nThe right name of what we call corn or Indian corn is maize. The word is\r\nderived from the Spanish word _maiz_, which comes from the native Haitian\r\nword _mahiz_. Corn in Europe means what we call wheat. Maize, or corn,\r\nlike all our grains, belongs to the big Grass Family and is a native of\r\nAmerica. Most of our other grains come from Europe and Asia, just as we\r\nourselves did. It probably came from the table-lands of Mexico and Peru\r\nand has always been the chief food of the Indians. It was introduced into\r\nAsia, southern Europe and northern Africa and spread quickly and widely\r\nfor a while. However, the climate was not hot enough for it in Europe and\r\nit is not raised there very much now. The English generally consider it\r\nfit only for animals and rather turn up their noses at us for eating it\r\nourselves. The only time I ever saw any offered to an Englishman he was\r\nvery polite about it but managed to avoid eating even a single mouthful\r\nfrom the nice, tender ears. Other nations are horrified at seeing\r\notherwise well-bred Americans pick up a roasting-ear and gnaw it off\r\nthe cob, and it must be confessed that it does look pretty bad unless a\r\nperson is careful to hold it with only one hand and bite it off daintily.\r\nMany Americans who travel in Europe miss it terribly and one woman\r\nconfessed to me that her chief reason for coming home was just to get\r\nsome real American corn once more. I understand, though, that the English\r\nlook on our popcorn very differently. It is said that two New England\r\nspinsters introduced it over there a number of years ago and their little\r\nstand rapidly became so popular that they amassed a very considerable\r\nfortune and lived happily ever afterwards. We use sweet corn not only on\r\nthe cob, for fritters, puddings and so on, as corn-meal and for stock,\r\nbut extract from it whisky, starch and glucose sugar. Besides sweet corn\r\nand popcorn the common kinds are flint and dent. Sweet corn gets its name\r\nfrom the large quantities of sugar in it. Popcorn pops because it has\r\na great deal of oil and this oil explodes when sufficiently hot. Corn\r\nvaries in color from white to black, but most of it is yellow or white.\r\nLike wheat, Government experts and other scientists in this country,\r\nCanada and elsewhere have been experimenting with corn for years and by\r\ncross-breeding and selection (about which processes I hope the Department\r\nwill receive some interesting contributions for our June number) they\r\nhave vastly improved the old varieties and produced many new ones.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child I remember being much impressed on being told that\r\nyou never, _never_ could find an ear of corn with an odd number of\r\nrows in it. Maybe you can, but I never have been able to, and, as that\r\nadvertisement says, “there is a reason.”\r\n\r\nCan someone tell us for our June Department? You may have heard the story\r\nof the Southern planter before the War who offered to give freedom to\r\nany slave who could find an ear of corn with an uneven number of rows.\r\nNone of them could, though it is easy to believe they hunted a good deal,\r\nuntil finally another white man showed one of the slaves how he could cut\r\na row out of an ear when it was very young so as to leave no mark when he\r\npresented it and demanded his freedom. The master kept his word and the\r\nslave went free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _VARIOUS HINTS._]\r\n\r\nIt was almost equally hard to award the prize for the best general\r\nsuggestion or recipe sent in. After some careful deliberation, it seemed\r\nthat, all things considered, the free subscription this month should go\r\nto Alicia E. Storm, of Plessis, N. Y., though we hesitated, especially\r\nbetween this and Mrs. Richardson. A little later I hope to be able to\r\nsend a little souvenir to _everyone_ who sends in a contribution and\r\ndoesn’t get a regular prize. In case this plan carries out, as I think\r\nit will, of course all who have contributed before that time will be\r\nremembered. And always there is the gratitude of those who benefit from\r\nyour suggestion, and my own sincere thanks and your consciousness of\r\nhaving helped other women in their daily trials and perplexities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Home Talk._\r\n\r\nWe have no kitchen cabinet, and we keep a small table set for three in\r\nour kitchen, which is not large. The cooking stove, sink, and cupboards\r\ntaking most of the room. I needed a small table to use for work and\r\nmixing table. There was a space behind the stove. I bethought me of the\r\ncrate in which my sewing machine came. It is just the thing. The table\r\nis just about the right height, and the shelf below is as convenient as\r\nthe top. I find that on baking day it helps very much to get everything\r\none needs before commencing work. I use an earthen mixing bowl. After the\r\nbread and biscuits, I make pies, as the lard is then cold. Then I make\r\nmy cakes and afterward doughnuts. It is a saving of time and fuel if one\r\ncan bake a variety at once, as in cold weather victuals keep longer than\r\nin summer. A convenience for storing pies can be made by having several\r\nshelves sawed out large enough to hold your tins. One can use laths (four\r\nof them) for uprights, fastening them well at the four corners of the\r\nbottom shelf; then fasten the others about three inches apart. This gives\r\nmore space, and keeps pies from being mussed.\r\n\r\nDid you ever experience the difference between two neighborly calls? Mrs.\r\nA. relates the latest bit of gossip, making up in insinuations what she\r\nlacks in fact. She talks about her dressmaker, criticizes the appearance\r\nand dress of her friends, and gives you an uncomfortable feeling—thinking\r\nperhaps you will be the subject of unpleasant remarks. Mrs. B. is fresh\r\nand cheery. She asks about your plants, and tells of the growth of her\r\nown—of every new bud. She tells of the cunning things her baby has said,\r\nof the nest her canary is building, of the new book she is reading. She\r\ntells, perhaps, of some ludicrous mistake she has made in her cooking,\r\nlaughing at the same. This woman may not be intellectual in the highest\r\nsense, but she is charming. Her call will have made you happy all the\r\nday. We leave the effect of our presence—sometimes for long. So should we\r\nact that no sting of uneasiness be left in the hearts of those with whom\r\nwe come in contact.—_Alicia E. Storm, Plessis, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Valuable Pointers_\r\n\r\nEvery work is easy and pleasant if you go at it as you go to a picnic. In\r\nhouse cleaning I fix one room at the time. It takes a week, but I have\r\nthe most of each day and I do my work better, as I don’t have to hurry.\r\nNo confusion in the regular routine of work; one thorough sweeping and\r\ndusting is enough for one day. If the tablecloth is clean enough for the\r\nhome folks, it is all right for company. Don’t try to cook a variety of\r\ndishes each day. You won’t hold out so well, and one or two will do as\r\nwell, and change them every day. Sheets, towels and some other things\r\ncan be used all right without ironing. If you smoothed all the wrinkles\r\nout of all the rough clothes, you might have the wrinkles in your face.\r\nI read and rest some every day. Prepare two dinners on Saturday, and go\r\nto church and Sunday-school. I do have some trouble and everyone does,\r\nbut I am always thankful, and my life-work is a delight to me. Let us try\r\nto do all things to the glory and honor of God. Although in the country,\r\nwe have one of the best “teachers.” Our children attend, cold or hot,\r\nregularly. They are taught the Sunday-school lesson at school Friday\r\nafternoon.—_Mrs. E. A. Richardson, Thomaston, Ga._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Make Sure of Milk Churning in Cold Weather_\r\n\r\nMany persons who churn in winter have trouble because butter will not\r\ncome if chilled, and are obliged to throw the milk away, or feed it to\r\nthe stock. If they will steam, not boil, the milk after milking, they can\r\nallow it to freeze solid and it will churn all right if thawed and warmed\r\nproperly. This recipe has been worth many dollars to me, and hope it will\r\nhelp other women housekeepers.—_Mrs. D. L. Burrows, Gibson, Ga._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Polish Nickel on Stoves_\r\n\r\nUse stove polish. It is the very best thing. Rub a light coating over it\r\nand polish with polishing cloth or brush. The cloth or brush is generally\r\nsufficient. Only give an occasional coat of polish.—_Mrs. D. L. Burrows,\r\nGibson, Ga._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Clean Iron Kettles_\r\n\r\nBoil skim-milk in it and then wash with good soap-suds. Use six quarts\r\nfor an eight-quart kettle, and boil and simmer for twenty-four hours.\r\nThis will also prevent future trouble.—_Mrs. E. R. Putney, Kansas City,\r\nMo._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Remove Large Stones From Fields_\r\n\r\nMake the stone very hot on one side only; pour water on it to make it\r\ncrack, and help it along with a heavy hammer. Another way, in the winter,\r\nis to bore a hole pretty well into the stone, fill with water and plug it\r\nfirmly shut. The force of the water as it freezes will crack the stone.\r\nStill another way is to make a hole in the direction of the veins or\r\ncleavage of the stone, put in a cleft cylinder of iron, then drive an\r\niron wedge between the two halves of the cylinder. _L. L. Deweese, Piqua,\r\nO._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shoe-Soles_\r\n\r\nMelt together tallow and common resin, two parts of first to one of\r\nsecond. Apply hot—as much as the sole will absorb. Neat’s-foot oil is\r\ngood also. These remedies keep the leather soft, prevent its cracking,\r\nand make it waterproof.—_Mrs. N. O. Baker, Jersey City, N. J._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Clean Wall Paper_\r\n\r\nTake off the dust with a soft cloth. With a little flour and water make a\r\nlump of stiff dough and rub the wall gently downward, taking the length\r\nof the arm each stroke, and in this way go round the whole room. As\r\nthe dough becomes dirty, cut the soiled parts off. In the second round\r\ncommence the stroke a little above where the last one ended, and be\r\nvery careful not to cross the paper or to go up again. Ordinary papers\r\ncleaned in this way will look fresh and bright, and almost as good as\r\nnew. Some papers, however, and these the most expensive ones, will not\r\nclean nicely. In order to ascertain whether a paper will clean nicely, it\r\nis best to try it in some obscure corner. Fill up any broken places in\r\nthe wall with a mixture of plaster of Paris and silver sand, made into\r\na paste with a little water, then cover the place with a piece of paper\r\nlike the rest, if it can be had.—_Mrs. B. C. Benton, Denver, Col._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Clean a Chimney_\r\n\r\nPlace a piece of zinc on the live coals in the stove. The vapor thus\r\nproduced will carry off the soot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_For a Cut_\r\n\r\nSift powdered resin on the wound, wrap with a soft, clean cloth, and wet\r\noccasionally with water.—_Miss Anna Paisley, New Orleans._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Cleanse Sponges_\r\n\r\nWash in a solution of a teaspoonful of ammonia to two quarts of water,\r\nand afterwards in a solution of one part of muriatic acid to twenty-five\r\nof water. Sponges should be thoroughly rinsed, aired, and dried after\r\nevery using. Unless they are kept very clean it is not well to use them.\r\nA piece of rough towel or tablecloth hemmed at the edges is much better.\r\nAnother way to clean sponges is to steep them in buttermilk for some\r\nhours, then squeeze out and wash in cold water. Lemon juice is also good.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _HEROISM AT HOME._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A PRIZE FOR THE BEST TRUE STORY_\r\n\r\nEvery month the Department will publish a little story of heroism _in the\r\nhome_—not any one act of heroism, but the tale of how someone _lived_\r\nheroically, _lived_ self-sacrifice _in everyday life_. It must be _true_\r\nand must be about somebody you know or have known or know definitely\r\nabout. _It must not have over 500 words._ The shorter, the better.\r\n_Whoever sends in the best story each month will not only have it printed\r\nbut will receive a year’s free subscription to WATSON’S MAGAZINE sent to\r\nany name you choose. Tell your story simply and plainly._\r\n\r\n_Please state whether the names and places mentioned in your story are\r\nreal or fictitious._ The Department does not print real names in these\r\nstories. Please do not send in stories about someone rescuing another\r\nfrom drowning or anything like that—we don’t want stories of single acts\r\nof heroism but of lives bravely and unselfishly lived out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stories of “Heroism at Home” have begun to come in. We can not\r\nprint all of them in this number, but there will be a place for the\r\nothers later on. Only one told of a single heroic incident. It was a\r\nbrave, unselfish act, but that isn’t what we are going to use under this\r\nhead—not things done suddenly, perhaps on impulse or by instinct, but the\r\nkind of heroism that lasts day after day. This one story, too, was told\r\nin verse and though it was good I fear we had better confine ourselves to\r\nsimple prose. I hope the writer will send us another good true story in\r\nprose and of heroic _living_.\r\n\r\nThe prize this month is awarded to “Her Career.” It was very hard to\r\ndecide among several stories that told of some very beautiful and useful\r\nlives, so I got others to help me. I imagine it is never going to be\r\neasy to decide which is the very best of the stories each month. How the\r\nstories are told is not considered at all, but the heroic lives described\r\nare very hard to weigh against one another. But I will do the best I can.\r\n\r\n\r\n_HER CAREER_\r\n\r\nNo, she never wrote a book, nor went as a missionary to Japan, nor won\r\na degree in college. She never even taught school, nor belonged to a\r\nwoman’s club.\r\n\r\nBut she has been the inspiration of her family and has radiated blessings\r\non all she knew.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago she was a dark-haired, dark-eyed bride of eighteen.\r\nThey were poor, but they had health and strength and bright dreams of\r\nthe future. They built a small log house on the land they had bought on\r\ncredit and began to improve it. Their days were filled with hopeful work\r\nand their nights brought rest and refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nBut soon a shadow fell across the sunlight that streamed on her pathway.\r\nHer husband began to drink. He was soon a helpless victim of the fiery\r\nappetite and could not go where liquor was without getting drunk.\r\n\r\nShe was refined and regretted to the very depths of her soul her\r\nhusband’s weakness. Sometimes she was righteously indignant, but\r\nshe never upbraided him with moral lectures in which she posed as a\r\nmistreated angel, though she often talked it over with him after the\r\n“spree” was over.\r\n\r\nChildren came. The “sprees” became more frequent and things looked more\r\ngloomy, but she worked tirelessly and trusted everlastingly.\r\n\r\nAt last the county voted liquor out. This did some good; the temptation\r\nwas farther away. But even then he would make several trips a year to\r\nthe nearest liquor town and always with the same result. If a neighbor\r\nwere going to town at the same time she would ask him to look after her\r\nhusband. And when the erring man staggered home she would put him to bed\r\nand cook him something to eat—not always ham and eggs and delicacies, but\r\nthe best she had. She never slipped anything in his coffee to cure him\r\nsecretly.\r\n\r\nAnd she has almost won. He is not proof against them yet, but the\r\n“sprees” are few and far between.\r\n\r\nSix children call her mother—two womanly daughters well married, another\r\na lovable and accomplished young woman, a handsome son, with his mother’s\r\nwonderfully calm eyes, who detests liquor, and two young girls at school.\r\n\r\nA neat white house with green blinds has taken the place of the log\r\nstructure. She is a model housekeeper and has always done all her\r\nwork—cooking, sewing, washing, ironing, scrubbing, milking, churning,\r\nsweeping, poultry-raising and one thousand and one other things. Besides\r\nthis she has tied up sore toes and cut fingers, poulticed boils, applied\r\nhot salt to all manner of aches and pains; doctored mumps, whooping-cough\r\nand la grippe; and successfully nursed measles, pneumonia and fever.\r\n\r\nHer face has lost some of its freshness and her hair is turning gray, but\r\nshe is still the blessed counselor of her family and she still finds\r\ntime to visit and make herself a true, cheerful friend and neighbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_HER SACRIFICE_\r\n\r\nMiss ⸺ lives in ⸺, Ohio. She was born on a farm where she lived with her\r\nfather and mother and two brothers and one sister. The father became\r\nsurety for a friend who failed, and it took the father’s farm to pay the\r\ndebt. The family therefore left the farm, and moved to the county-seat,\r\nin the suburbs, and in a small house and two lots began life anew. He\r\nrode the country buying stock for other men, kept cows and peddled milk\r\nin the town, kept forty hens and sold eggs, cultivated the lots in garden\r\nproduce, and kept the family together. One fortunate result of leaving\r\nthe farm, the children were put into the city schools. Miss ⸺ graduated\r\nin the high school, and obtained a certificate to teach. The two brothers\r\nmarried and left the city. Then finally the sister married and left. Miss\r\n⸺, at the age of 26, was left to care for her parents in their declining\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nShe obtained a position as teacher in the city schools and devoted her\r\nwages to the care of the home, and looked after her parents when out\r\nof school hours. There came offers of honorable marriage, for she was\r\nstrong, healthy, comely and attractive. She could not consider them.\r\nHer parents could not do without her. They were declining in strength\r\nand looked to her for the care of the household. She taught on, and\r\nwith her wages kept them in comfort. Two years ago the good old mother,\r\nweary of life, departed for the better land. Two years longer the old\r\nfather lived, kept the house during the day while the daughter was in\r\nthe schoolroom and awaited the sound of her footsteps in the evening\r\nreturning from the school. In January he lay on the bed stricken with\r\na fatal sickness, though unknown to him or her, and while they talked\r\ntogether as she bent over him he ceased to breathe, and she was left\r\nalone in the world, unmarried, without a home, and the prime of her good\r\nlife spent in assiduous care of her parents—at the age of forty years!\r\nAll hope of a home and family of her own sacrificed to her sense of duty\r\nto her father and mother! What is to be her reward? Many another has made\r\na like sacrifice, but how is she to recoup the loss of the fourteen years\r\nspent in their service—the loss of her own home and family and children\r\nand all the sweet consolations of the state of motherhood? Was it not\r\na heroic life? How few would have met it! Only those who know of her\r\nself-sacrifice will know how to honor her. Her fidelity, so unobtrusive,\r\nwill be little noted by the world. But how grand and noble the sacrifice\r\nshe has made!\r\n\r\n\r\n_QUIET COURAGE_\r\n\r\nElizabeth Stanton was born about sixty-five years ago in a beautiful\r\nSouthern town. She was the youngest daughter of Judge James Stanton, one\r\nof the ablest jurists of the state.\r\n\r\nFew young ladies had superior advantages to Elizabeth, and fewer still\r\npossessed her amiable disposition and strong character. Being beautiful,\r\naccomplished and wealthy, it is no wonder she married the only son of a\r\nmillionaire. A few years after their marriage her husband erected the\r\nfinest residence in the state. Although built forty years ago it stands\r\nproudly today without an equal in the state.\r\n\r\nElizabeth had everything that heart could wish save one—her husband\r\nwas dissipated and grew more so as years came on. But no ear save the\r\nMaster’s ever heard her complain and she was always cheerful.\r\n\r\nA few years after the Civil War her husband died, leaving his palatial\r\nhome mortgaged and his vast estate squandered. Elizabeth was left with\r\nthree children and a small amount of money. She gave up her magnificent\r\nhome and wealth without a murmur and returned to her old home. In a\r\nfew years she married again, a man of fine personality, a scholar and\r\ntypical Southern gentleman, one born to wealth and knowing little how to\r\nacquire it. His fortune was like that of most Southern people after the\r\nCivil War. They remained in their native home till their small fortune\r\nwas nearly gone. Then they removed to Florida and lived on a homestead,\r\nin a tent with a dirt floor for two years. Elizabeth had never before\r\nlived without servants, never cooked a meal or laundered a handkerchief.\r\nNow she did all her own work, even to the washing, and taught a country\r\nschool several months of each year. She found time to visit and elevate\r\nthe poor, rough people around her, and never by word did she let them\r\nknow she was not of their class. She was greatly admired and beloved by\r\nall who knew her. During these years of hardship she was just as bright\r\nand cheerful and apparently as content as when she trod the marble floors\r\nof her former mansion. She smilingly remarked to me once that she was\r\nglad they had been chastened. It had made her a better woman and was the\r\nmeans of her husband’s conversion. As fortune always favors the brave,\r\nshe did not always live in poverty. In a few years they had a fine orange\r\ngrove bearing, and her husband was elected to a high office.\r\n\r\nI have never known a more heroic life of any woman. When clouds have\r\nhovered over me I have thought of this brave, beautiful character and it\r\nhas been my inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _RECIPES, OLD AND NEW._]\r\n\r\nFrom a collection of recipes that dates back almost to “War-Time” we\r\nshall give a few every month.

Watson._]\r\n\r\nNote: _Reviews are by Mr. Watson unless otherwise signed._\r\n\r\n\r\n    =On the Field of Glory.= By Henryk Sienkiewicz. Little, Brown &\r\n    Co., Boston.\r\n\r\nAfter the reader has finished reading this book he disapproves of the\r\ntitle. He has been taken into ancient Poland, where the winter snows\r\nlie deep, where the wolves of the forest come with the night to make\r\ndanger for the traveler. He has been shown how the upper class lived in\r\nthe time of the Soldier-King, John Sobieski. He follows the thread of\r\na passionate and tender and happily ended love-story. He laughs with\r\nand at the four brothers, the huge, rude, boisterous, but brave and\r\ngood-hearted foresters. He feels impressed by the genius of the author\r\nduring the whole time, for he knows that this strange Polish world, with\r\nits unfamiliar men and women, is a creation born of the mental processes\r\nof a great literary artist.\r\n\r\nIt is not an historical novel in the sense that “Quo Vadis” was. There is\r\nno field of glory at all. John Sobieski does not appear before us as Nero\r\nwas made to do in the book just named.\r\n\r\nThe John Sobieski of this novel might be any other King. So far as we are\r\ntold about his appearance, manners, dress, personal peculiarities, he\r\nmight have been Rudolph of Hapsburg or Henry of Valois.\r\n\r\nThere are no battles, no sieges, no heroic advance or retreat. As the\r\nbook closes, the Polish army has set out from Cracow to Vienna; and\r\nthat’s as near as we approach the field of glory.\r\n\r\nWith the heroine the reader never gets in full sympathy. She drives away\r\nthe man who has always loved her and whom she loves _without knowing it_.\r\n\r\nShe then consents to wed her hideous, lecherous, old guardian. More\r\nindignant than the bride, the spirits of the Unseen World resent this\r\nunnatural union, and they prevent it by claiming the groom while the\r\nmarriage feast is being eaten.\r\n\r\nWith the hero the reader is on good terms from first to last, for his is\r\na fine character finely drawn.\r\n\r\nWhen the guardian and intended husband is dead, and the rejected lover\r\nis far away, the hero is subjected to trial and temptation, beset by\r\ndangers, marked for destruction by a lustful brute, neglected and hated\r\nby family connections. It is then that human interest of the deepest kind\r\ncentres in the poor orphan girl _Panna Anulka_, whom we had condemned\r\non account of her readiness to marry old _Pan Gideon_. We follow her\r\nfortunes then with painful attention and we rejoice when she is saved.\r\n\r\nWhile “On the Field of Glory” is not, perhaps, so great a book as “Quo\r\nVadis,” its atmosphere is purer, its store of love more tender and its\r\nportrayal of ancient manners and character apparently quite as faithful.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The Strange Story of the Quillmores.= By A. L. Chatterton.\r\n    Stitt Publishing Company, New York.\r\n\r\nTo write a novel which shall hold the reader with a strong and constant\r\ngrip, and yet give him no love-story, is a feat not done by everyone that\r\ntries it. Mr. Chatterton tells no story of love, but I have not read many\r\nbooks that interested me more than “The Strange Story of the Quillmores.”\r\nMr. Chatterton’s pictures of life are true to life: his men are the men\r\nwho wear breeches—not impossible abstractions who say or do things which\r\nno human beings ever said or did. And his women are as real as his men.\r\n\r\n_Uncle I’_ and his store, where the neighbors buy all sorts of things,\r\nfrom ham to coffins, and where a group of loafers and tattlers is\r\ngenerally on hand, are as well known to the reader as if he had been\r\nthere. _Uncle I’_ must be a character taken from life. He is full of\r\nquiet humor, homely wisdom, sound common sense, manly courage and loyalty.\r\n\r\nOld-fashioned _Uncle I’_, keeping his old-fashioned carry-all store,\r\nswapping stories and repartee with his old-fashioned neighbors,\r\nstruggling heroically with his old-fashioned telephone, and with it all,\r\nliving up to the best standards of honesty and usefulness—yes, _Uncle I’_\r\nis a complete artistic success.\r\n\r\nSo is _Doctor Gus_. True, he reminds the reader, in a general way, of Ian\r\nMaclaren’s Scotch country doctor, but _Doctor Gus_ is American, and he is\r\nstamped with sufficient individuality to make him a very live man to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nWhat could be better than the old German woman, _Mother Treegood_? The\r\nchapter in which _Mother Treegood_ comes to visit Uncle I’s wife, who is\r\nbroken with grief on account of her dying daughter, is one that is worthy\r\nof Dickens. It has the heart-throb of human sorrow, human sympathy, human\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nI don’t know of anything more touching, in its simple unpretentious way,\r\nthan the story of how _Mother Treegood’s_ boys, the twins, ran away from\r\nhome, and how one of them was drowned in the Ohio River, and was sent\r\nhome for burial.\r\n\r\n“My pretty boy was to our house brought, aber no one could him know—he\r\nwas in the wasser—de water—so long—_oh das Kalte, Kalte Wasser!_ so many,\r\nmany days. I took more of the fever—und go out of my head—und so I never\r\nmy Liebling seen again.”\r\n\r\nThe cry that was heard in Ramah, “_Oh, that cold, cold water!_”\r\n\r\nThen, later on, there came a little box of tin-iron, “mit a hole cut in\r\nthe on-top side.” But let _Mother Treegood_ tell it in her own way:\r\n\r\n“One day there came by the express company a little bundle. When it\r\nwas opened—it was an oyster can—a box of tin-iron, mit a hole cut in\r\nthe on-top side. The letter was from de other boy—und it say—that his\r\nbrudder, who vas ver-drownded, did begin his business life in a hotel\r\nin Cincinnetty, as a bellboy, und he safe his money und put it in the\r\noyster can. Und in dat oyster box was the shin-plasters, the five\r\ncentses, und de ten centses—yoost as he take them in for noospapers and\r\nshoe-blacking—und it was yoost enough, ach mein lieber Gott!—yoost enough\r\nto pay for his grave at Brookfill.”\r\n\r\nSurely this is very effective. It probably happened just that way. To\r\nknow that it could, and perhaps _did_, is just the right impression for\r\nthe author of a novel to make on the reader.\r\n\r\nAnother splendid episode is that wherein a “run on the bank” begins,\r\nas the funeral of Colonel Quillmore is in progress. The chapters which\r\nrelate the tragedy, the fire in the Colonel’s laboratory, the wild ride\r\nof _Father Lessing_ and _Uncle I’_; the dramatic climax where _Mrs.\r\nQuillmore_ lashes herself into raving madness; the funeral procession\r\nwhose mourners get caught up in the growing excitement of the “run on the\r\nbank,” and leave the hearse to fly to the bank for their money; the nerve\r\nand resource of _Doc. Gus_ in saving the bank, and in saving the cashier\r\nfrom the would-be lynchers—are chapters which bear convincing testimony\r\nto the power and creativeness of the author.\r\n\r\nThe book is so finely conceived and written that one is tempted to scold\r\nthe author for a few glaring faults which are well-nigh inexcusable.\r\n\r\nWhy paint _L’Oiseau_ so black when he was to be white-washed at the end?\r\nThere was no need to have him behave so brutally to the boy, _Lanny\r\nQuillmore_. It was a blunder to make him insult the boy, incur the\r\nhatred of the boy, assault the boy, and drive the boy from his own home.\r\nThe lad is allowed to think and believe that _L’Oiseau_ is on terms of\r\ncriminal intimacy with _Mrs. Quillmore, Lanny’s_ mother. There was no\r\nnecessity for this. If _L’Oiseau_ was brother-in-law to _Mrs. Quillmore_,\r\nand was prompted by paternal interest in paying her such suspicious\r\nattention, and in being out in the woods with her at unseasonable hours\r\nin the night, why permit the lady’s son to torture himself under a\r\nmisapprehension?\r\n\r\nWhat earthly reason was there for keeping from her only son a knowledge\r\nof the fact that _L’Oiseau_ was her brother-in-law, and that her abnormal\r\nphysical and mental condition required these unusual and suspicious\r\nattentions from him?\r\n\r\nAgain, _L’Oiseau_ was rambling about at night with _Mrs. Quillmore_ when\r\nshe lost consciousness, fell by the wayside, was found by the priest, and\r\nsuccored by _Doc. Gus_.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of her escort, _L’Oiseau_?\r\n\r\nHe had mysteriously disappeared, and _Doc. Gus_ had a right to put the\r\nworst construction upon his conduct. _Father Lessing_ knew the truth; why\r\ndid _Father Lessing_ allow _Doc. Gus_ to remain in ignorance?\r\n\r\nBut the most serious blunder in the plot relates to the climax—the fire\r\nin _Colonel Quillmore’s_ laboratory.\r\n\r\n_Doc. Gus_ sees the shadow of two men thrown upon the window shade. Only\r\none of these men is accounted for, and the reader is left not only in\r\ndoubt as to what happened, but in hopeless confusion. He cannot adopt any\r\ntheory which will explain _all the facts_.\r\n\r\nNow, _that_ is against the rules. Let the plot be ever so complicated,\r\nthe mystery ever so deep, the author _must_ either clear it up himself,\r\nor furnish the reader with the clue. Wilkie Collins, in spite of his\r\nbewildering tangles, unravels everything before he quits. In “Edwin\r\nDrood,” the book which Dickens was writing when death interrupted the\r\nstory, the author had constructed one of his most involved and difficult\r\nplots. Before he had furnished the key to the riddle, he died. Yet\r\nEdgar Allan Poe was able to tell, with unerring certainty, just how the\r\nstory was meant to end. By a keen analysis of the facts which Dickens\r\nhad already related, and by a course of reasoning that left no room for\r\ndoubt, Poe demonstrated that _Jasper_, the guardian and devoted friend\r\nof _Edwin Drood_, had murdered him; that jealousy was the motive; that\r\nthe body of the victim was hidden in the new tomb which the inflated ass,\r\n_Sapsea_, had recently built for the deceased _Mrs. Sapsea_; and that the\r\ncorpse was located by old _Durdles_, the drunken workman whose skill with\r\nhis hammer was so great that he could, by tapping, tapping, tapping on\r\nthe outside or a wall, tell whether a foreign substance, such as a human\r\nbody, was inclosed within.\r\n\r\nPoe’s own matchless story, “The Gold Bug,” illustrates the rule which\r\nMr. Chatterton broke. There are all sorts of mystifications to start\r\nwith, but they are cleared up at the end.\r\n\r\nEven in Frank Stockton’s famous “The Lady or the Tiger,” the rule is\r\nkept. The reader is left in a dilemma, but he can clear up everything by\r\nchoosing one horn or the other. If he says that it is the lady who is\r\nbehind the door which is about to be opened, no mystery remains. If he\r\nsays that it is the tiger which is behind the door, nothing is left of\r\nthe puzzle.\r\n\r\nBut in the Quillmore story there is no possible explanation _which will\r\ndispose of the facts_. If _Colonel Quillmore_ died in the laboratory,\r\nand _L’Oiseau_ did _not_ kill him, who did? What about the _two_ men\r\nquarreling in there at the time of the tragedy? What becomes of that\r\nother man? And how could _Quillmore’s_ son meet him again in Paris? With\r\nthe exception of _L’Oiseau_, no one had _the motive_ to kill _Colonel\r\nQuillmore_; and the author made a point of showing that other people were\r\nafraid to go near the laboratory.\r\n\r\nBut if the _Colonel_ did _not_ die in the laboratory, how did his false\r\nteeth get into the mouth of the dead man when _Doc. Gus_ dragged him out\r\nof the flames? How did the _Colonel’s Masonic ring_ get on the dead man’s\r\nfinger? How did the _Colonel_ make his escape without being seen, and,\r\n_who was it that he quarreled with and killed before he fled_? Nobody\r\nappears to have been missing from the neighborhood. Usually when somebody\r\nis killed, somebody is missed.\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Chatterton refrained from putting another man in the laboratory,\r\nhad he left the _Colonel_ dead in the flames, identified by his Masonic\r\nring, had he left the reader to suppose that the sudden death of the\r\n_Colonel_ and the sudden blaze which broke out in the building resulted\r\nfrom some dangerous chemical experiment, such as the _Colonel_ delighted\r\nin—the story would have lost not a grain of interest and would have\r\nescaped a flagrant violation of the rules of literary construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The Game and the Candle.= By Frances Davidge. D. Appleton &\r\n    Co., New York.\r\n\r\nFrances Davidge set herself too difficult a task when she attempted to\r\nmake the characters in her novel. “The Game and the Candle,” speak in\r\nepigrams on every other page. The consequence is that the story, with\r\nits really brilliant beginning, develops into a commonplace love-story,\r\nand is only saved from absolute banality by its unforeseen and dramatic\r\nending. In the field of literature which attempts to picture New York\r\nsociety the story will not find an enduring place, but it serves its\r\npurpose very well. The novelists are numberless who have sought to\r\nsatirize our men and women of wealth and leisure; but few have given us\r\nany books that have lived longer than their allotted span of one brief\r\nseason. The big society novel has not yet been written. Miss Davidge\r\nevidently knows a great deal of the foibles, the follies and the manners\r\nof the people of whom she writes, and her career is worth watching. At\r\npresent she seems a bit immature and prolix, but there is no doubt as\r\nto her ability to write amazingly clever dialogue and to tell a story\r\nlogically and well. Some of her characters are greatly overdrawn. One\r\nwishes that there were less of _Gussie Regan_, the hair-dresser; and\r\n_Emily Blair_, lovable as she is, could never have existed. Altogether,\r\nhowever, the story is pleasing and will find, doubtless, a large and\r\nappreciative audience.\r\n\r\n                                                               H. C. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The Carlyles.= By Mrs. Burton Harrison. D. Appleton & Co., New\r\n    York.\r\n\r\nIn “The Carlyles” Mrs. Burton Harrison relinquishes the modern field\r\nwhich she has occupied for so long and with such marked success, and goes\r\nback to Civil War times for the scenes of her story. The Reconstruction\r\nperiod has been covered by innumerable writers. Indeed, it has been so\r\nfrequently used by novelists and proven so fruitful a field, that one is\r\napt to be overcome at the courage of an author who selects it now as the\r\nbackground for a tale; but Mrs. Harrison brings a certain freshness and\r\ncharm to a subject that, it would seem, could inspire none. The opening\r\nchapter, which describes the impoverished condition of the _Carlyles_,\r\nbrought on by the ravages of war, reveals the author at her best, and\r\nshows her intimate knowledge of life in Richmond in the ’60’s. The\r\nsplendid fortitude of old _Mr. Carlyle_ in the face of his calamity and\r\nfinancial ruin, and the pride of the aristocratic Southerner are depicted\r\nwith faultless art.\r\n\r\nThe story itself is the old one of a girl who is unable to choose between\r\ntwo lovers, one of whom, of course, is a Yankee soldier and the other\r\na Southerner fighting as a lieutenant-colonel under Lee. The usual\r\ncomplications occur. _Lancelot Carlyle_, a cousin and lover of _Mona_,\r\nthe heroine, is imprisoned at Fort Delaware, and of the long period of\r\nhis confinement Mrs. Harrison writes graphically, describing minutely the\r\nterrible ordeal of prison life. Fine as this portion of the novel is,\r\nhowever, it is in the chapters dealing with quiet domestic scenes that\r\nMrs. Harrison writes with most force and distinction. The incident of the\r\nChristmas dinner-party, with the unheralded return of _Lancelot_ and the\r\nsudden death of old _Alexius Carlyle_, is handled with consummate skill.\r\nThe author has written no finer passage in any of her previous novels,\r\nnor one more certain to move her readers to tears.\r\n\r\n                                                                 H. C. T.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =The House of Mirth.= By Edith Wharton. Charles Scribner’s Sons.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly no novel during the past season has elicited more favorable\r\ncriticism and more numerous letters from constant readers than “The\r\nHouse of Mirth.” The book had a certain artificial success from the\r\nstart, because the impression went abroad that here at last was a book\r\nabout Society, meaning the smallest number of the narrowest brains in\r\nany community from Kankakee to New York. On this very account there are\r\na few millions of people in the United States who would not care to read\r\nit; but in view of the fact that some of the most serious critics have\r\nhailed “The House of Mirth” as a great American novel—only the bookseller\r\nnow speaks of _the_ American novel—a good many of the few millions, being\r\npersons of means and intelligence, would be tempted to indulge themselves\r\nin the rare luxury of such a boon. We cannot profess to treat the book as\r\na true picture of American Society; because while we know how to wear the\r\nclothes and order the things to eat and drink, when we have the money,\r\nwe have never, in our best-dressed and best-fed moments, been able to\r\nconvince ourselves that we are anything but hopelessly middle class. Yet\r\nwe are happy—sometimes; and we are bound to marvel at some of the things\r\nthe society people in “The House of Mirth” do. For the most part they act\r\nlike those people in New York who are loosely described as Fifth-avenue\r\nbohemians, which means they are people of much money, thoroughly informed\r\nabout the decorative issues of life, with nothing to do but bore\r\nthemselves and with a taste and intelligence that, in literature or the\r\ntheatre, never craves anything more exciting than a musical show or a\r\nthird-class novel, written by a man in Chicago, about lords and ladies\r\nof some corner lost and forgotten in Continental Europe. Our marvel that\r\nthese society people should seem so underbred is only an exhibition of\r\nour unfamiliarity with a certain social stratum. We would have no right\r\nto make record of it, if it were not for the fact that so many people, of\r\nthe better class themselves, have written letters of protest to divers\r\npublications, protesting against the impression that “The House of Mirth”\r\nis a story accurately representing New York society. We quote one letter\r\nfrom the _New York Times Saturday Review_:\r\n\r\n    “I am not a literary man, much less a literary critic, but\r\n    I look forward each week to the appearance of _The New York\r\n    Times Book Review_ with renewed interest and read the various\r\n    criticisms of your readers as to the merits of “The House of\r\n    Mirth,” which in almost every instance meets their approval as\r\n    a literary production of unusual merit. The writer, however, an\r\n    octogenarian, born and bred in New York City, member of one of\r\n    its oldest families and presumably familiar with its society,\r\n    can but look upon “The House of Mirth” as a gross libel upon\r\n    that society, and as an insult to a class as pure, as refined,\r\n    and as intellectual as may be found the world over....\r\n\r\n    “That such a condition as is therein described does exist in\r\n    the lower strata of New York society, which may be termed\r\n    swelldom, composed largely of “newrich” who swarm from other\r\n    parts of the country to exploit their newly acquired wealth in\r\n    showy equipages, wondrous wardrobes, and loud manners to the\r\n    disgust of refined people, cannot be denied; but why a lady\r\n    who has the entrée into the best society should elect to open\r\n    the sewers of its lowest strata and allow its fœtid airs to\r\n    escape through the medium of her pen is beyond the ken of your\r\n    contributor.”\r\n\r\n                                                           T. R. W.\r\n\r\nFor our part, we prefer to depend upon the octogenarian who has just\r\nspoken, and who asserts his membership in one of the oldest families in\r\nNew York, for an opinion upon the accuracy of “The House of Mirth” as a\r\nSociety novel. As a novel pure and simple it seems to us to be radically\r\ndefective in imaginative power, slow and cumbrous in construction, and\r\nwholly ineffective to impose an illusion. We say this with regret because\r\nwe have read a good many of the author’s short stories from the time\r\nthe first volume of them was issued; and the impression conveyed by her\r\nwork in the short story field, as contrasted by the impression of this\r\nnovel, makes clearer to us than ever the conviction that to write a short\r\nstory a short-story writer is required, and to write a novel a novelist,\r\nand they have always been two persons from Mr. Kipling down and across.\r\nThe author’s style is clear, sharp, refined, as before; but the gross\r\ndefect of “The House of Mirth” is that the characters are pushed here and\r\nthere by the author like so many wooden soldiers on a cardboard field\r\nof battle. They have no more volition than marionettes. In fact they\r\nare merely described names except in the instances of the three chief\r\ncharacters. One could have borne with the waxlike fibre of the attendant\r\npersons if the figure of _Lily Bart_, the heroine, would stand the gaze\r\nof the naked eye during even half the book. _Lily_ is described by the\r\nauthor as possessing a fine sense of diplomacy in intercourse with the\r\npeople of her set, yet her whole register of action from the first page\r\nreveals her as moving through the comedy without prudence, yet without\r\nconscience, with maneuver, yet without skill; with an under-appeal to\r\nthe reader’s sympathy, yet exasperating the reader until in the moment\r\nof tragedy he feels that the heroine deserved all she got and ought to\r\nhave got it sooner. But, when one gets away from the book, one feels that\r\nthe fault is not the fault of the character, but of the author who has\r\npaltered by trying to make literary academics and psychology square with\r\nlife itself and a good story.\r\n\r\nThe minor irritations of the book are the absolutely fictional flavor of\r\nthe names of most of the characters, the use of English or Continental\r\nidiom, and the mummery of the illustrations. Among the English\r\nphrases which the author so much affects is the word _charwoman_ for\r\n_scrubwoman_. It may be that Society calls a scrubwoman a charwoman, but\r\nwe would like to see any society man or woman do it to the lady’s face.\r\n\r\nIt is announced that Clyde Fitch is to dramatize “The House of Mirth” for\r\nproduction next fall and that he will adhere to the construction of the\r\nstory as much as possible. The book is worthy of Mr. Fitch’s lofty talent.\r\n\r\n                                                                    R. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Letters and Addresses.= By Abraham Lincoln. Unit Book\r\n    Publishing Company.\r\n\r\nEven if there were a man, at this day of awakening in the United States,\r\nwho could honestly say he had no interest in politics, providing he had\r\nany intelligence at all and ambition to think, he could not pass over\r\nsuch a book as “Lincoln’s Letters and Addresses” for the simple reason\r\nthat on account of the style alone, the reading of them is a solace and\r\na refreshment that endures. Of course, most of us are familiar with the\r\naddresses and the letters that have been so widely quoted, repeated, and\r\nlearned by heart in school, that they are become as household words;\r\nbut in such a book as this, containing infinite riches in little room,\r\none secures not only the loftiest kind of pleasure but also a strangely\r\nintimate and attractive vision and understanding of the gaunt, unshapely\r\nfigure whose genius towers higher as the years are added to the history\r\nof our country.\r\n\r\n                                                                    R. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Contrite Hearts.= By Herman Bernstein. A. Wessels Company, New\r\n    York.\r\n\r\nSome books are interesting because of their content alone; some only on\r\naccount of the personality of their author: some for the reason that both\r\nthe author and the content of his book are humanly valuable. Of the third\r\ndistinction is “Contrite Hearts,” a story of Jewish life in Russia and\r\nthe United States, by a writer who on occasion before has shown that he\r\ncan use an alien language with simplicity and force. He has shown before\r\nalso that he can present a picture of the people of his race without bias\r\nand with a due understanding of their defects and qualities. The Jew in\r\nAmerica as presented in melodrama is a creation almost wholly of the\r\nromance spirit of the theatre. It is not to be denied that the prevalence\r\nof the very poor Jews in the lowest ranks of traffickers among men has\r\nprovided an obvious type. In sharp contrast to this is the growing\r\ndominance of the Jew in the very highest ranks of commerce. Between the\r\ntwo must of necessity exist the Jew of the middle class; and all these\r\nvarieties of the race have expanded to their utmost in the United States\r\nrather than in any other country. From a purely artistic standpoint,\r\ntherefore, there is nothing more evident than that the field of Jewish\r\nmanners and customs is wide and rich ground for the novelist. The\r\ntransmutation in one generation of a peasant in Russia, with no rights\r\nbeyond those of a street mongrel, to a man in the most advanced as well\r\nas the most vigorous civilization of the day, is material too obvious to\r\nbe overlooked by the most casual scribe.\r\n\r\nMr. Bernstein, while not a writer of dramatic quality has that quieter\r\nand more sincere gift native to Russians, whether Jew or Gentile, of\r\npresenting life as an actuality against the artificial background of the\r\nprinted page. Many who are called novelists among ourselves, and who have\r\nnever talked or written any language but English, could learn a good deal\r\nof simplicity from this foreign-born author. Of course, one runs across\r\nthe traces of his birth in certain peculiarities that even constant\r\npractice cannot wear out. These blemishes, however, are never vulgar as\r\nare the strainful phases of an indigenous author who uses his language as\r\na race-track tout spreads himself with the flashy colors and fabrics that\r\nthe clothier and the haberdasher of his station provide. It is rather\r\ninteresting to hear what one of the characters in “Contrite Hearts” has\r\nto say of this country.\r\n\r\n“Here in America it is different. All are equal. Everyone is free.\r\nAnd all roads to success are open to the able, the enterprising, the\r\npersevering. There is no difference here between Jew and Gentile.\r\nPeople flock hither from all lands, and within a few years the Jew, the\r\nFrenchman, the German, the Irishman, the Italian—all are proud that they\r\nhave become American. You ask me about the Jews, about Jewish affairs,\r\nabout Jewish institutions—well, we have various kinds of Jews here.\r\nOrthodox Jews—these are the plain Jews like ourselves. Reform Jews—Jews\r\nwho imitate the ways of the Christian. There are also Jews here who try\r\nto be both Orthodox and reform at the same time—that is, neither this nor\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nIs this all true?\r\n\r\n                                                                    R. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Politics in New Zealand.= By Prof. Frank Parsons. Edited by\r\n    Dr. C. F. Taylor. Dr. C. F. Taylor, Publisher, Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the Equity Series published quarterly by Dr. Taylor, and\r\ncontains the chief portions of the political parts of a book entitled,\r\n“The Story of New Zealand,” by Prof. Frank Parsons and Dr. Taylor. The\r\nlatter is a large, heavy book selling at $3.00, and is doubtless the most\r\ncomplete history of New Zealand and exposition of present conditions\r\nthere ever published. It is a beautifully illustrated volume containing\r\n860 pages, and includes history, description, the native people (the\r\nMaoris) and their treatment by the whites, the splendid resources of the\r\ncountry, and, more than all, a full and interesting account of the rise\r\nand development of the remarkable institutions and government of New\r\nZealand which are attracting the attention of all the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Taylor well says in his explanatory note in “Politics in New\r\nZealand,” the size and cost of the “Story of New Zealand” prevent it from\r\nreaching the masses of our people, and the political facts, particularly\r\nof that progressive country should reach the mind and thought of our\r\nvoters. “It is,” he says, “with a view of placing these political facts\r\nwithin the easy reach of the masses of our people, that I have selected\r\nthe most important of these facts from the large book and arranged\r\nthem as you see them in this unpretentious pamphlet.” “Politics in New\r\nZealand” is now being used in combination with subscriptions to WATSON’S\r\nMAGAZINE. (See advertising pages.)\r\n\r\nThe great value of “Politics in New Zealand” lies in the fact that it\r\ngives the workings of many Populistic ideas put into actual practice. In\r\nthis country the People’s Party has been obliged to theorize and resort\r\nto an appeal to the reasoning faculties of the people. It has been unable\r\nto point out many illustrations of the actual working of its theories,\r\nexcept by reference to foreign countries. For example, to sustain its\r\ncontention for public ownership of railroads, it has been obliged to use\r\nthe lines in Germany and other monarchies as illustrations. The United\r\nStates is such a vast domain as compared with countries in Continental\r\nEurope, that considerable discrimination is necessary in order to draw\r\na fair conclusion. Besides, the European countries are so old that the\r\nhabits of the people are a great factor not to be lightly dismissed. In\r\nusing New Zealand, however, as our object lesson, the conditions are\r\nmore, nearly parallel. It is true that country is much smaller than\r\nthe United States, but in point of age and habits of the people, there\r\nis much similarity. Accordingly, New Zealand is without doubt the best\r\nobject lesson in the world for proving the soundness of Populistic\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\nThose who have either bought or sold real estate in the older portions\r\nof the United States, understand the difficulties and uncertainties\r\nsurrounding land titles under the system which is in vogue generally. As\r\nProf. Parsons points out, it is often necessary to search through many\r\nbig volumes of deeds and mortgages, and carefully construe the provisions\r\nof various wills and conveyances in order to follow the title to its\r\nsource, and form an opinion as to its validity. And even then the opinion\r\nof the most accomplished expert may prove fallacious, and the purchaser\r\nmay lose his land through some defect of title. As early as 1860 the\r\nNew Zealanders passed an act to remedy this condition of things by\r\nestablishing what is known as the Torrens system of title registration.\r\nThe owner of land may give the registrar his deeds and the claims of all\r\npersons interested, and the registrar investigates the title once for\r\nall. He accepts it if he finds it valid, and registers the applicant as\r\nproprietor, giving him a certificate to that effect. The certificate\r\ngives an indefeasible title in fee, subject only to such incumbrances and\r\ncharges as may be entered on the register. An independent purchaser has\r\nonly to consult the register to learn at once who is the owner of the\r\nland, and what burdens, if any, rest upon it. He is not obliged to trace\r\nthe title back to the Government Patent. This system is now in force in\r\nsome places in the United States, but its adoption is generally opposed\r\nby those who profit by examining titles—that is to say, the lawyers.\r\n\r\nThere were some telegraph lines constructed under the provincial\r\ngovernments of New Zealand prior to 1865, but nothing was done in a\r\nnational way until that year. Then the General Assembly authorized the\r\nGovernor to establish electric telegraphs and appoint a commissioner\r\nto manage them. Existing lines and offices were to be purchased, new\r\nlines built, and a national system developed. The commissioner made\r\nthe regulations, fixed the rates, and employed operators to transmit\r\nall messages presented. Afterward the telegraphs became a part of the\r\npostal system. This naturally led to government ownership and operation\r\nof the telephone when the latter means of transmitting intelligence was\r\nintroduced. It is also a part of the postal system, and as Prof. Parsons\r\npoints out, “The Government is ‘hello-girl’ as well as postmaster,\r\ntelegraph operator and banker.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone secured the establishment of postal savings banks in\r\nEngland in 1861. New Zealand adopted the idea in 1865, and since that\r\ntime nearly every country in the civilized world, except the United\r\nStates, has followed England’s example. The object of the New Zealand\r\nPost Office Savings Bank Act (1865) was stated to be: “To give additional\r\nfacilities for the deposits of small savings at interest, and with the\r\nsecurity of the Government behind it.” Practically all the money order\r\noffices in New Zealand (470 a few years ago) were open under the Postal\r\nBanking Law for the transaction of savings bank business, while there\r\nwere but five private savings banks in the Islands. In New Zealand there\r\nis a place of bank deposit for each 1,800 people. In the United States\r\nthere is one for each 7,650 people. The total deposits in all sorts\r\nof banks is $110 per head of population in the United States, $125 in\r\nGreat Britain, and $140 in New Zealand. Comment seems to be unnecessary.\r\nThe postal banks will not receive less than a shilling at a time, but\r\nprinted forms are furnished on which stamps may be pasted, one or more\r\nat a time, until the total amounts to a shilling or more, when the slip\r\ncan be deposited as cash to the amount of the stamps pasted on it. The\r\ngreat advantage of postal banking, and in fact all government banking, is\r\nits safety. No postal bank in any country has ever closed its door for\r\nliquidation, or experienced a run on its funds.\r\n\r\nIn view of our insurance scandals and the recent investigation, the\r\nchapter on Government Insurance is especially interesting at this time.\r\nIn 1870 New Zealand adopted the Australian ballot and a public works\r\npolicy, together with a Government Life Insurance Department. As the\r\nauthor points out, “The philosophy of this new departure was very simple.\r\nThe purpose of insurance is the diffusion of loss. Instead of allowing\r\na loss to fall with crushing weight on one individual, or family, it is\r\nspread out over a large number of stockholders or premium payers. If\r\nit is a good thing to distribute loss over a few thousand people who\r\nhold stock in a given company or pay premiums to it, it is still better\r\nto distribute the loss over the whole community. It is also wise to\r\neliminate the expenses and profits of insurance so far as may be, and put\r\nthe guarantee of the Government behind it, so that it may reach as many\r\npeople and afford as much security as possible.”\r\n\r\nThe insurance department was popular from the very start. The latest\r\nreport when this book was written (1901) showed in force 42,570 policies\r\ncovering $51,000,000 of insurance, or practically half the total business\r\nof the Colony. The Government office had beaten the private companies in\r\nfair competition, for there was no attempt to exclude private insurance\r\ncompanies. It had, in 1901, a much larger business than any of the\r\ncompanies, and almost as much as all the companies put together. This\r\nrefers, of course, to the ordinary life insurance business, for there\r\nwere 21,000 policies in industrial societies, which were not included\r\nin the regular life insurance statement. Two of our companies mixed up\r\nin the recent scandal, the Equitable Life and the New York Life, had,\r\nin 1901, been in the Colony 15 and 13 years respectively. The Equitable\r\nhad 717 policies in force and the New York Life 139, as against 42,570\r\nGovernment policies.\r\n\r\nThe people of New Zealand prefer the Government insurance because of\r\nits safety—it has the guarantee of the Government behind it. It is in\r\nno danger of vanishing through insolvency, as ordinary insurance does\r\nnow and then. Because of its cheapness, the rates being lower than\r\nany ordinary private companies; and because of its freedom from all\r\noppressive conditions. The only conditions are that the premiums must be\r\npaid, and the assured must not commit suicide within six months after\r\nthe insurance is taken out. As Professor Parsons says, “The policy is\r\nworld-wide. The assured may go where he will, do what he likes—get\r\nhimself shot in battle, smoke cigarettes, drink ice-water and eat plum\r\npudding, or commit suicide under the ordinary forms after six months,\r\nand the money will still be paid to his relatives.” Instead of wasting\r\nvaluable time and gray matter on devising schemes to prevent scoundrels\r\nfrom looting private insurance companies, why not devote a little\r\nthought to inaugurating a system of government insurance?\r\n\r\nAn unique institution in New Zealand is the Public Trust office,\r\nestablished in 1872. Its purpose is to serve as executor, administrator,\r\ntrustee, agent, or attorney, in the settlement and management of the\r\nproperty of decedents, or others, who for any reason are unable or\r\nunwilling to care for it themselves; to insure honest administration and\r\nsafe investment; to provide for a wise discretion that may avoid the\r\ndifficulties and losses incident to a strict fulfilment of wills and\r\ntrusts imperfectly drawn; and to give advice and draw up papers, wills,\r\ndeeds, and other instruments for the people in all parts of the Colony.\r\n\r\n“In the earlier years,” says the author, “nominations for representatives\r\nwere made and seconded vocally at an assembly of the voters of the\r\ndistrict. But since the Act of September (1890) representatives are\r\nnominated by petition in writing, signed by two or more voters of the\r\ndistrict, transmitted with the candidates’ assent and a $50 deposit\r\nto the returning officer, who immediately publishes the names of the\r\ncandidates. Each candidate must be nominated on a separate paper which\r\nmust be transmitted to the returning officer at least seven days before\r\nthe polling day. If the nominee doesn’t get one tenth as many votes as\r\nthe lowest successful candidate, the $50 deposit is forfeited to the\r\npublic treasury. This shuts out frivolous nominations. The nominations\r\nare usually made some time before the voting day, and the candidates go\r\nabout the district and meet and address the electors in all parts of it.\r\nNo candidate would stand any chance of election who failed to give the\r\npeople he wished to represent an opportunity to get acquainted with him\r\nand ask him questions about his attitude on issues likely to come before\r\nthe next Parliament. Seamen, sheep-shearers and commercial travelers are\r\npermitted to vote by mail. Such person gets a ballot paper filled up\r\nby the Postmaster with the names of the candidates in the applicant’s\r\ndistrict, and the postal voter then marks the ballot and mails it.”\r\n\r\nAnother Populistic economic theory put in practice in New Zealand is the\r\nLand and Income Assessment Act which abolishes the personal property tax\r\nand establishes graduated taxation on land values and incomes. The avowed\r\nobjects of the law are to tax “according to ability to pay,” “to free\r\nthe small man,” and, “to burst up monopolies”; and its cardinal features\r\nare the exemption of improvements and of small people and the special\r\npressure put on the big monopolies and corporations and on absentees.\r\n\r\nAll improvements are exempt. All buildings, fencings, draining, crops,\r\netc.—all value that has been added by labor, all live stock also and\r\npersonal property; only the unimproved value of the land is taxed.\r\nMortgages are deducted also in estimating the land taxes as they are\r\ntaxed to the lender. There is a small-estate exemption of $2,500, where\r\nthe net value of the estate doesn’t exceed $7,500. So that if a farmer\r\nhas no more than $2,500 of land value left after deducting improvements\r\nand mortgage liabilities from the value of his real property, he pays no\r\nland tax.\r\n\r\nBesides the three exemptions mentioned, there is another conditional\r\nexemption. If an old or infirm person owns land or mortgages returning\r\nless than $1,000 a year, and can show that he is not able to supplement\r\nhis income, and that the payment of the tax would be a hardship, the\r\ncommissioner may remit the tax. Here the custom is quite the other way.\r\nThe millionaire swears off his tax. Out of 110,000 land owners, in New\r\nZealand, only 16,000 pay tax.\r\n\r\nThe graded tax begins when the unimproved value reaches $25,000. It rises\r\nfrom ¼ of a cent on the pound of $25,000 to 16⁄4ths, or 4 cents, a pound\r\non a million dollars, or more, of unimproved value. This graduated tax is\r\nin addition to the ordinary level-rate land tax levied each year, which\r\nis 2 cents on the pound. Absentee owners of large estates have still\r\nanother tax to pay. If the owner of an estate large enough to come under\r\nthe graded tax has been out of the country a year, this graded tax is\r\nincreased 20%.\r\n\r\nThe income tax applies to net income from employment, and net profits\r\nfrom business. There is an absolute exemption of $1,500, except in the\r\ncase of absentees, and companies whether absentees or not, and a further\r\nadditional exemption up to $250 a year for life insurance premiums, if\r\nthe citizen wishes to spend his money that way. All income derived from\r\nland or from mortgages, so far as they represent realty, is outside this\r\ntax, which affects only income from employment or business. The farmer,\r\nwho derives all his income from land, pays no income tax. The same may be\r\nsaid of a lawyer, doctor, teacher, artisan, or any other person who makes\r\nno more than $1,500 a year. The total number of income-tax payers is only\r\nabout 5,600.\r\n\r\nUnited States Consul Connolly, reporting to our Government in 1894 and\r\n1897, has considerable to say regarding taxation in New Zealand. He says\r\nthat country excels in the matter of taxation. That in a very short time\r\nthe system of taxation had been revolutionized and the incidence almost\r\nentirely changed, not only without disturbing to any appreciable extent\r\nexisting interests, but with the most beneficial results. He says the\r\nincome tax was most fiercely denounced as inquisitorial, destructive of\r\nthe first principles of frugality and thrift—in fact all the forms of\r\nevil lurked in the shadows of the words “income tax,” and a united effort\r\nwas made to resist this “iniquitous tax,” but all to no purpose. And that\r\nin 1897, after six years of experience, the more liberal and fair-minded\r\nof those who opposed the income tax frankly admitted that it is a fair\r\nand unembarrassing tax. “In New Zealand the land and income tax is now\r\npopular; it is accepted in lieu of the property tax; it is a success.”\r\n\r\nIn the United States the Government is paternalistic toward banks,\r\nrailroads and manufacturing interests. It loans its credit to the\r\nnational bankers at most advantageous terms, but has persistently refused\r\nto favor other classes in a similar way. In New Zealand, however, in\r\n1894, there was established a Government loan office which lends public\r\nfunds to farmers, laborers, business men, etc. at low interest, and on\r\neasy terms. The security taken is on freehold, or leasehold, interest\r\nclear of incumbrances and free of any breach of conditions. The loans are\r\non first mortgage of land and improvements. No loan is to be less than\r\n$125, or more than $15,000, and the sum of the advances to any one person\r\nmust not exceed $15,000. There are two kinds of advances, fixed loans\r\nand installment loans. The first may be for any period not exceeding ten\r\nyears, and the principal is due at the end of that term. The second is\r\nfor 36½ years, and part of the principal is to be paid each half year.\r\nInterest in both cases is at 4½%, if paid within fourteen days of the\r\ntime it is due (5% if payment is not prompt); and in the case of an\r\ninstalment loan, 1% more is to be paid for the reduction of the principal.\r\n\r\nPassing over the chapters devoted to the labor department, the state\r\nfarm, the factory laws, the shop acts, the 8-hour day, industrial\r\narbitration and co-operation, all of which are of intense interest,\r\nbut of such a nature as to preclude brief statement, we come to the\r\nGovernment ownership and operation of the railways. The year 1894 Prof.\r\nParsons calls “the glory year of land resumption. Government loans to\r\nfarmers, nationalization of credit, labor legislation and judicialization\r\nof strikes and lock-outs.” It was in this year that another important\r\nmove was made through a vital change in the national railway policy. In\r\n1887 a commission system was inaugurated, under which the roads were\r\nput in the hands of commissioners appointed by the Governor, with the\r\nassent of Parliament. This did not prove satisfactory to New Zealand. The\r\ncommissioners managed the roads with a view to making a good financial\r\nreport. They were looking for profit. In the Parliamentary debates it\r\nwas charged that rates were so high that firewood went to waste in the\r\nforest, and potatoes rotted in the fields, while the people in the\r\ncities were cold and hungry in the years of depression; that goods were\r\nfrequently hauled more cheaply by wagon than by rail; that while rates\r\nwere reduced somewhat now and then, it was done by reducing wages; that\r\nthe pay of the men was cut while the salaries of high-priced officials\r\nwere increased, and so on. This is a striking parallel to conditions in\r\nthe United States today.\r\n\r\nProf. Parsons admits that the commissioners were honest, but they\r\nwere simply railroad men, running the roads to make money for the\r\ntreasury. Finally public indignation became intense. The air was full\r\nof complaints, and in 1893 the abolition of the commission was made an\r\nissue in the campaign, and the people, by an overwhelming majority,\r\nelected representatives pledged to put the roads under direct control of\r\nthe Minister of Railways and the Parliament, and to bring the railroads\r\nwithin speaking distance of the people.\r\n\r\nThe result of this change is that the roads are no longer run primarily\r\nfor profit, but for service; and the men are treated with the\r\nconsideration due to partners in the business. It is announced that the\r\ndefinite policy of the Government shall be that all profits above the 3%\r\nneeded for interest on the railway debt shall be returned to the people\r\nin lower rates and better accommodations. This is in striking contrast to\r\nthe facts brought out in the letter of Engineer William D. Marks to Hon.\r\nWharton Barker, recently printed as a public document at the instance of\r\nSenator Tillman of South Carolina, in which it is shown that the people\r\nof the United States are today paying interest on a fictitious railway\r\ncapitalization of something like $7,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the Minister of Railways announced a reduction of 20% on ordinary\r\nfarm products and 40% on butter and cheese, etc. These concessions, Prof.\r\nParsons declares, amount to one seventh of the receipts—equivalent to\r\na reduction of $150,000,000 on the yearly freight rates in the United\r\nStates. That alone would be a yearly saving of almost $2 a head for\r\nthe people of the United States. In 1900 Mr. Ward, the new Minister of\r\nRailways, announced a general lowering of passenger fares as the first\r\nfruits of his administration. “The announcement was received with cheers\r\nby the audience—stockholders in the road.” Care is taken in New Zealand\r\nthat small men shall not be put at a disadvantage. The State roads carry\r\n400 pounds at the same rate as the ton rate, or the train-load rate, and\r\none bale of wool goes the same rate as a thousand. No such thing is known\r\nin New Zealand as the lowering of rates to a shipper because of the great\r\nsize of his shipments. All the rates are made by the management openly.\r\nThere are no secret modifications of the tariff. There may be a variation\r\non scheduled rates to equalize a long haul, or enable a distant mine or\r\nfactory to reach the market in condition to compete with nearer rivals,\r\nbut the total charge is never lower than the rate that is given to others\r\nfor the same service.\r\n\r\nThe State roads are used to advance the cause of education. Children in\r\nthe primary grades are carried free to school. Other children pay $2.50\r\nto $5, according to age, for a three-months season ticket up to sixty\r\nmiles. This gives them a possible 120 miles a day for 3 to 6 cents in\r\nround numbers, or 20 to 40 miles for a cent. A child who goes in and out\r\nsix miles each day rides 12 miles for 3 cents.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in the limits of this article to more than touch upon\r\nmany of the other advances made in New Zealand. The Referendum is now\r\nused to a considerable extent in local affairs, and its use is being\r\nextended. Old age pensions are in force, being a much better method than\r\nmaintaining poor houses. Immigration is carefully guarded. The State is\r\nnow opening coal mines and engaging in the business of furnishing fuel to\r\nthe people. Many other innovations of this character are being considered\r\nand put in operation from time to time.\r\n\r\nProf. Parsons summarizes his study of New Zealand in some sharp contrasts\r\nand conclusions, from which we quote in part:\r\n\r\n“The United States is in form a Republic, but ... an aristocracy of\r\nindustrial power. New Zealand is in form an Imperial Province, but in\r\nfact it is substantially a Republic. The will of the great body of the\r\ncommon people is in actual control of the Government.\r\n\r\n“In America, farmers organize for agricultural needs, and the working-men\r\norganize for labor purposes, but they do not join forces to take control\r\nof the Government in their common interest, as is the case in New\r\nZealand. Not only have our farmers and workers failed to get together,\r\nbut neither group has learned to use the ballot for its interest in any\r\nsystematic way. The farmers divide at the polls and organized labor\r\ndivides at the polls. In New Zealand the small farmers are practically\r\nsolid at the ballot box, and organized labor is solid at the ballot, and\r\nthe two solids are welded together into one irresistible solid.”\r\n\r\n                                                                 C. Q. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =BACK HOME. By Eugene Wood. S. S. McClure Co., New York.=\r\n\r\nIt isn’t often that an author writes a real review of his own book. Well,\r\nmaybe he does, too, but it seldom happens that he writes it as a preface\r\nto the book itself, very seldom that it is an interesting one, very, very\r\nseldom that it tells you what to expect to find in the book, and very,\r\nvery, _very_ seldom that he isn’t too much wrapped up in his own private\r\nidea of his story to write a fair one from our point of view. However,\r\nEugene Wood, being unconventional and other pleasing things, has done all\r\nthis in the preface to his “Back Home.” When you have read the preface,\r\nyou are glad you did, instead of feeling sorry you wasted time on it and\r\nfearful lest a book by the same author of that preface will be something\r\nof a bore. After Mr. Wood’s preface you know Mr. Wood and about what to\r\nexpect in Mr. Wood’s book. You like one, and you know you are going to\r\nlike the other.\r\n\r\nIt would be the easiest thing in the world for the reviewer to sit down\r\nand write reams of “copy” on “Back Home” and the good things therein, but\r\nit is much more to the point for him who reads to listen to Mr. Wood\r\nhimself. If you are human instead of petrified, you will enjoy both the\r\npreface and the book. Both reach for the heart-strings, and the terms—the\r\nterm is good.\r\n\r\nHere is the larger part of the preface:\r\n\r\n“Gentle Reader:—Let me make you acquainted with my book, ‘Back Home.’\r\n(Your right hand, Book, your right hand, Pity’s sake: How many times have\r\nI got to tell you that? Chest up and forward, shoulders back and down,\r\nand turn your toes out more.)\r\n\r\n“Here’s a book. It is long? No. Is it exciting? No. Any lost diamonds\r\nin it? Nup. Mysterious murders? No. Whopping big fortune, now teetering\r\nthis way, and now teetering that, tipping over on the Hero at the last\r\nand smothering him in an avalanche of fifty-dollar bills? No. Does She\r\nget Him? Isn’t even that. No ‘heart interest’ at all. What’s the use of\r\nputting out good money to make such a book; to have a cover-design for\r\nit; to get a man like A. B. Frost to draw illustrations for it, when he\r\ncosts so like the mischief, when there’s nothing in the book to make a\r\nman sit up till ‘way past bedtime’? Why print it at all?\r\n\r\n“You may search me. I suppose it’s all right, but if it was my money,\r\nI’ll bet I could make a better investment of it. If worst came to worst,\r\nI could do like the fellow in the story who went to the gambling-house\r\nand found it closed up, so he shoved the money under the door and went\r\naway. He’d done his part.\r\n\r\n“And yet, on the other hand, I can see how some sort of a case can be\r\nmade out for this book of mine. I suppose I am wrong—I generally am in\r\nregard to everything—but it seems to me that quite a large part of the\r\npopulation of this country must be grown-up people. If I am right in\r\nthis connection, this large part of the population is being unjustly\r\ndiscriminated against. I believe in doing a reasonable amount for the aid\r\nand comfort of the young things that are just beginning to turn their\r\nhair up under, or who rub a stealthy forefinger over their upper lips\r\nto feel the pleasant rasp, but I don’t believe in their monopolizing\r\neverything. I don’t think it’s fair. All the books printed—except, of\r\ncourse, those containing valuable information; we don’t buy those books,\r\nbut go to the public library for them—all the books printed are concerned\r\nwith the problem of How She got Him, and He can get Her.\r\n\r\n“Well, now. It was either yesterday morning or the day before that you\r\nlooked in the glass and beheld there The First Gray Hair. You smiled a\r\nsmile that was not all pure pleasure, a smile that petered out into a\r\nsigh, but nevertheless a smile, I will contend. What do you think about\r\nit? You’re still on earth, aren’t you? You’ll last the month out, anyhow,\r\nwon’t you? Not at all ready to be laid on the shelf? What do you think\r\nof the relative importance of Love, Courtship, and Marriage? One or two\r\nother things in life just about as interesting, aren’t there? Take\r\ngetting a living, for instance. That’s worthy of one’s attention, to a\r\ncertain extent. When our young ones ask us: “Pop, what did you say to Mom\r\nwhen you courted her?” they feel provoked at us for taking it so lightly\r\nand so frivolously. It vexes them for us to reply: “Law, child! I don’t\r\nremember. Why, I says to her: ‘Will you have me?’ and she says: ‘Why,\r\nyes, and jump at the chance.’” What difference does it make what we said\r\nor whether we said anything at all? Why should we charge our memories\r\nwith the recollections of those few foolish months of mere instinctive\r\nsex-attraction when all that really counts came after, the years wherein\r\nlow passion bloomed into lofty Love, the dear companionship in joy and\r\nsorrow, and in that which is more, far more than either joy or sorrow,\r\n“the daily round, the common task?” All that is wonderful to think of in\r\nour courtship is the marvel, for which we should never cease to thank the\r\nAlmighty God, that with so little judgment at our disposal we should have\r\nchosen so wisely.\r\n\r\n“If you, Gentle Reader, found your first gray hair day before yesterday\r\nmorning, if you can remember, ’way back ten or fifteen years ago—er—er—or\r\nmore, come with me. Let us go ‘Back Home.’ Here’s your transportation,\r\nall made out to you, and in your hand. It is no use my reminding you\r\nthat no railroad goes to the old place. It isn’t there any more, even\r\nin outward seeming. Cummins’s woods, where you had your robbers’ cave,\r\nis all cleared off and cut up into building lots. The cool and echoing\r\ncovered bridge, plastered with notices of dead and forgotten Strawberry\r\nFestivals and Public Vendues, has long ago been torn down, to be replaced\r\nby a smart, red iron bridge. The Volunteer Firemen’s Engine-house, whose\r\nbrick wall used to flutter with the gay rags of circus-bills, is gone\r\nas if it never were at all. Where the Union School-house was is all\r\ntorn up now. They are putting up a new magnificent structure, with all\r\nthe modern improvements, exposed plumbing, and spankless discipline.\r\nThe quiet, leafy streets echo to the hissing snarl of trolley cars, and\r\nthe power-house is right by the Old Swimming-hole above the dam. The\r\nmeeting-house, where we attended Sabbath-school, and marveled at the\r\nGreek temple frescoed on the wall behind the pulpit, is now a church\r\nwith a big organ, and stained-glass windows, and folding opera-chairs on\r\na slanting floor. There isn’t any “Amen Corner,” any more, and in these\r\ncalm and well-ordered times nobody ever gets “shouting happy”.\r\n\r\n“But even when “the loved spots that our infancy knew” are physically the\r\nsame, a change has come upon them more saddening than words can tell.\r\nThey have shrunken and grown shabbier. They are not nearly so spacious\r\nand so splendid as once they were.\r\n\r\n“Some one comes up to you and calls you by your name. His voice echoes in\r\nthe chambers of your memory. You hold his hand in yours and try to peer\r\nthrough the false-face he has on, the mask of a beard or spectacles, or a\r\nchanged expression of the countenance. He says he is So-and-so. Why, he\r\nused to sit with you in Miss Crutcher’s room, don’t you remember? There\r\nwas a time when you and he walked together, your arms upon each other’s\r\nshoulders. But this is some other than he. The boy you knew had freckles,\r\nand could spit between his teeth, ever and ever so far.\r\n\r\n“They don’t have the same things to eat they used to have, or, if they\r\ndo, it all tastes different. Do you remember the old well, with the\r\nwindlass and chain fastened to the rope just above the bucket, the chain\r\nthat used to cluck-cluck when the dripping bucket came within reach to be\r\nswung upon the well-curb? How cold the water used to be, right out of the\r\nnorth-west corner of the well! It made the roof of your mouth ache when\r\nyou drank. Everybody said it was such splendid water. It isn’t so very\r\ncold these days, and I think it has a sort of funny taste to it.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Gentle Reader, this is not really ‘Back Home’ we gaze upon when we\r\ngo there by train. It is a last year’s birds’ nest The nest is there;\r\nthe birds are flown, the birds of youth, and noisy health, and ravenous\r\nappetite, and inexperience. You cannot go ‘Back Home’ by train, but here\r\nis the magic wishing-carpet, and here is your transportation in your hand\r\nall made out to you. You and I will make the journey together. Let us in\r\nheart and mind thither ascend.\r\n\r\n“I went to the Old Red School-house with you. Don’t you remember me? I\r\nwas learning to swim when you could go clear across the river without\r\nonce ‘letting down.’ I saw you at the County Fair, and bought a slab of\r\nice-cream candy just before you did, I was in the infant-class in Sabbath\r\nSchool when you spoke in the dialogue at the monthly concert. Look again.\r\nDon’t you remember me? I used to stub my toe so; you ought to recollect\r\nme by that. I know plenty of people that you know. I may not always get\r\ntheir names just right, but then it’s been a good while ago. You’ll\r\nrecognize them, though; you’ll know them in a minute.”\r\n\r\n                                                                 A. S.

McCall for the recovery of the amount.\r\n\r\n    Senator La Follette, of Wisconsin, introduces a bill in the\r\n    Senate making it an offense for any Government officer,\r\n    official or employee to accept a railroad pass or franking\r\n    privilege over telegraph lines.\r\n\r\n    By a vote of 346 to 7 the House of Representatives passes\r\n    the Hepburn railroad rate regulation bill just as it came\r\n    from the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and\r\n    declared by Chairman Hepburn to be exactly in accordance with\r\n    recommendations of President Roosevelt on the subject.\r\n\r\n    The House of Representatives passes the General Pension bill\r\n    for the year ending June 30, 1907. The bill appropriates\r\n    $140,245,000. Congressman Gardner, of Michigan, declares\r\n    that when the last pensioner on account of the Civil War has\r\n    disappeared from the rolls, $12,000,000,000 will have been\r\n    expended.\r\n\r\nFebruary 9.—The Illinois coal operators decide to refuse the demands of\r\nthe United Mine Workers for an increase in wages.\r\n\r\n    The Pennsylvania House of Representatives passes a resolution\r\n    directing the attorney general of that state to ascertain\r\n    whether any railroad companies in Pennsylvania are engaged in\r\n    the mining of coal, and if so, to proceed against them.\r\n\r\n    By reducing the rate of railroad fares to two cents a mile, it\r\n    is estimated that the people of Ohio will be saved $4,000,000\r\n    a year, or a sum equal to almost all the taxes paid for the\r\n    support of the state government.\r\n\r\n    The Senate Committee takes under consideration the Hepburn\r\n    railroad rate bill.\r\n\r\n    The taking of testimony against Senator Reed Smoot, the Mormon,\r\n    ends. Senator Smoot’s counsel will introduce testimony in his\r\n    defense.\r\n\r\n    The House of Representatives passes 429 pension bills. The\r\n    Judiciary Committee of the House begins an investigation to\r\n    ascertain whether or not Congress has the power for Federal\r\n    control of insurance.\r\n\r\n    Secretary Taft appears before the Senate Committee on the\r\n    Philippines and says the United States will probably suffer no\r\n    reduction in tariff income under the Philippine tariff bill\r\n    passed by the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n    Secretary Root proposes to reorganize the State Department and\r\n    put it on a business basis.\r\n\r\n    Charles E. Magoon, governor of the Panama Canal Zone, appears\r\n    before the Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals. He declares\r\n    the sanitary conditions good, the Supreme Court of Panama\r\n    capable and impartial, and advises the coinage of silver money\r\n    for use on the Isthmus.\r\n\r\n    The differences between President Dolan, of the United Mine\r\n    Workers of the Pittsburg district, and the delegates to the\r\n    convention are taken to the courts.\r\n\r\nFebruary 11.—Samuel Glasgow, manager of a milling company of\r\nSpokane, Washington, claims to have received Chinese papers from his\r\nrepresentative in China, claiming that a recent speech of William J.\r\nBryan to Chinese merchants had been used to stir up renewed antipathy to\r\nAmerican goods.\r\n\r\n    John Mitchell, President of the United Mine Workers, reaches\r\n    New York City to confer with the mine operators on the new\r\n    scale of wages demanded by the miners.\r\n\r\n    President Baer, of the Reading Railroad, states that the\r\n    Pennsylvania Legislature has not the power to interfere with\r\n    the vested rights of coal-carrying railroads.\r\n\r\nFebruary 12.—The Senate passes the resolution introduced by Senator\r\nTillman which directs the Interstate Commission to investigate the\r\nalleged discrimination by railroad companies in the matter of the\r\ntransportation of coal and other commodities; as to whether the railroad\r\ncompanies own stock in coal companies or in other commodities carried\r\nby them; whether any of the railroad officers are interested in such\r\ncommodities; whether there is any monopolizing combination or trust in\r\nwhich the railroads are interested, and whether any of the railroad\r\ncompanies control the output of coal or fix its price. The Commission\r\nalso is directed to investigate the system of car distribution, and\r\nwhether there is discrimination against shippers either in the matter of\r\nthe distribution of cars or otherwise.\r\n\r\n    Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, makes a speech in the Senate\r\n    favoring a revision by the courts of all rates made by the\r\n    Commission. This would practically kill the effectiveness of\r\n    the Hepburn bill.\r\n\r\n    The Pennsylvania House of Representatives adopt a resolution\r\n    that the Attorney General be instructed to inquire into the\r\n    allegations that the Pennsylvania Railroad, the New York\r\n    Central and the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburg Railroad\r\n    companies, and their leased lines, are directly or indirectly\r\n    engaged in the mining of bituminous coal, and if it be found\r\n    that they are engaged in this business that he proceed against\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    Leaders of the United Mine Workers reach New York to hold a\r\n    conference with their President, John Mitchell.\r\n\r\nFebruary 13.—F. Augustus Heinze, defeated in the courts, sells his\r\nMontana copper mines to the trust, ending the great Montana copper war.\r\n\r\n    John Mitchell and the wage-scale committee of the Mine Workers\r\n    are working on the schedule of demands which will be presented\r\n    to the mine operators.\r\n\r\n    The committee to which Thomas W. Lawson has turned over all his\r\n    proxies of the Mutual and New York Life Insurance Companies\r\n    agree to employ counsel to aid them in their efforts to oust\r\n    the new managements of the two companies. Five members of\r\n    Lawson’s committee are governors of various states.\r\n\r\n    Attorney General Hadley, of Missouri, who is conducting the\r\n    State’s case against the Standard Oil Co., goes to Iowa\r\n    and gets testimony from former officers of the Standard’s\r\n    subsidiary companies. He states that he has made out his case\r\n    against the Standard.\r\n\r\n    George W. Beavers, of New York, former Chief of the Division of\r\n    Salaries and Allowances of the Post Office Department, pleads\r\n    guilty to a charge of conspiracy, and is sentenced to two years\r\n    imprisonment. Machen and others have already been convicted and\r\n    are serving sentences.\r\n\r\n    The Bituminous Coal Trade League, of Pennsylvania, sends\r\n    Congressman Gillespie, of Texas, a petition stating that\r\n    Senators Elkins, of West Virginia, and Gorman, of Maryland\r\n    have caused violations of the anti-trust laws. Former Senator\r\n    H. G. Davis, of West Virginia, father-in-law to Senator\r\n    Elkins, cousin to Gorman, and Vice Presidential nominee of the\r\n    Democratic party in 1904, is also accused of being a party to\r\n    these violations.\r\n\r\nFebruary 14.—The “housecleaning” committee of the New York Life Insurance\r\nCo. submits a report to the trustees of the company, showing that\r\n$148,702.50 has been illegally contributed to campaign funds in the last\r\nthree elections. The committee recommends that suits for the recovery of\r\nthe same be brought against John A. McCall and all other officers who had\r\nanything to do with making the contributions.\r\n\r\n    John G. Brady, Governor of Alaska, resigns.\r\n\r\n    The House of Representatives passes the appropriation bill for\r\n    fortifications. The total amount appropriated is $4,383,993,\r\n    $600,000 of this to be spent in fortifying the Philippines and\r\n    Hawaii.\r\n\r\n    The Senate passes the ship subsidy bill. If the bill becomes\r\n    a law it is estimated that $26,000,000, will be taken from\r\n    the United States Treasury and paid out in bounties to vessel\r\n    owners during the next ten years.\r\n\r\n    The resolution of Representative Sulzer, of New York, calling\r\n    for an inquiry regarding the sale of the old New York Custom\r\n    House to the National City Bank, of New York, passes the House\r\n    by a unanimous vote.\r\n\r\nFebruary 15.—John Mitchell presents the demands of the miners to the mine\r\nowners. Committees are appointed to represent both sides.\r\n\r\n    Congressman Longworth procures a license to marry Miss Alice\r\n    Roosevelt. The President attends Mr. Longworth’s bachelor\r\n    dinner.\r\n\r\n    James W. Alexander is again stricken with paralysis and is in a\r\n    sanitarium at Deerfield, Mass.\r\n\r\n    Officers of the beef packers again testify that Commissioner\r\n    Garfield promised that no evidence they gave would be used\r\n    against them. The testimony brought out these facts: First,\r\n    Commissioner Garfield apparently took the word of Armour &\r\n    Co.’s general superintendent that the Armour Car Company,\r\n    which has been declared the tap root of the Beef Trust, was\r\n    not owned by Armour & Co., and had nothing to do with the\r\n    fresh meat industry, and made no further attempt to get\r\n    information concerning the private car line monopoly. Second,\r\n    Swift & Co. gave information reluctantly to the Commissioner\r\n    of Corporations, and only after consulting counsel. At this\r\n    conference attorneys for the other packers in the trust\r\n    were present. The secretary of Swift & Co. contributed the\r\n    information that he sought this advice of counsel because he\r\n    “wanted it.”\r\n\r\nFebruary 16.—James W. Alexander, former President of the Equitable Life\r\nInsurance Co., is operated on. The physicians refuse to tell the nature\r\nof the operation, but give hopes of Alexander’s recovery.\r\n\r\n    Reports from Memphis, Tenn., state that more than fifty per\r\n    cent of the Southern peach crop has been killed and the other\r\n    fifty per cent is commercially worthless.\r\n\r\n    State Senator James Minton, of New Jersey, invites Thomas W.\r\n    Lawson, Ida Tarbell and Attorney-General Hadley, of Missouri,\r\n    to attend a public hearing on his resolution calling on\r\n    Attorney-General McCarter, of New Jersey, to bring proceedings\r\n    to annul the charter of the Standard Oil Company.\r\n\r\n    Stuyvesant Fish, a member of the “housecleaning” committee of\r\n    the Mutual Life Insurance Co., resigns because Standard Oil\r\n    interests obstruct a thorough investigation of the company’s\r\n    affairs.\r\n\r\n    On account of the illness of Senator Tillman, the Senate\r\n    postpones the vote on the railroad rate bill until February 23.\r\n\r\nFebruary 17.—Miss Alice Roosevelt, the daughter of the President, is\r\nmarried, in the White House, to Congressman Nicholas Longworth, of\r\nCincinnati.\r\n\r\n    Justice Rufus W. Peckham, of the United States Supreme Court,\r\n    advises the “housecleaning” committee of the Mutual Life\r\n    Insurance Co. to bring action against Richard A. McCurdy,\r\n    ex-president of the company, before he leaves this country.\r\n\r\n    Fire destroys $1,000,000 worth of wheat at Duluth, Minnesota.\r\n\r\n    President Peabody, of the Mutual Life Insurance Co., refuses to\r\n    give his consent for an investigation of the company’s board of\r\n    trustees by the “housecleaning” committee.\r\n\r\nFebruary 18.—John A. McCall, late president of the New York Life\r\nInsurance Co., dies at Lakewood, N. J. His death was hastened by the\r\nrecent insurance scandals. The New York _World_ sums up the result of the\r\ninsurance investigation as follows:\r\n\r\n    John A. McCall, dead, fortune shattered; J. W. Alexander,\r\n    mental and physical wreck; James H. Hyde, self-expatriated in\r\n    Paris; Robert A. McCurdy, preparing to follow Hyde; Robert H.\r\n    McCurdy, preparing to follow his father; Judge Andy Hamilton,\r\n    on the Riviera; Thomas D. Jordan, in seclusion; Andrew Fields,\r\n    in seclusion; Louis Thebaud, going to Paris; W. H. McIntyre, in\r\n    seclusion; George W. Perkins, reputation smirched; Chauncey M.\r\n    Depew, damaged in reputation.\r\n\r\n    John B. Stetson, the millionaire hat manufacturer of\r\n    Philadelphia, dies at Gillen, Florida.\r\n\r\n    John Mitchell and his associates, representing the anthracite\r\n    miners, complete their demands to the coal operators. They will\r\n    be presented in a day or two.\r\n\r\n    President Roosevelt prepares to have the frauds in connection\r\n    with the Indian affairs in Indian Territory investigated.\r\n\r\nFebruary 19.—Eight suits are begun by the Mutual Life Insurance Co.\r\nagainst the McCurdys, Louis A. Thebaud, son-in-law of Richard A. McCurdy,\r\nand C. H. Raymond & Co., for restitution of moneys of the company\r\nillegally spent. This includes campaign contributions, illegal salaries,\r\nrebates and illegal commissions.\r\n\r\n    President Roosevelt recommends to Congress a lock canal of\r\n    eighty-five foot level across the Isthmus of Panama. The lock\r\n    canal was also favored by the Canal Commission and Secretary\r\n    Taft. A majority of the Board of Consulting Engineers favored a\r\n    sea level canal.\r\n\r\n    The United States Supreme Court decides that it is illegal for\r\n    railroads to sell commodities which they transport as common\r\n    carriers. The decision of the Court bears directly on railroads\r\n    that own or operate coal mines.\r\n\r\n    Congressman E. Spencer Blackburn, of North Carolina, is accused\r\n    of accepting a fee for using his influence to obtain action\r\n    by an executive department. The offense is similar to the one\r\n    committed by Senator Burton.\r\n\r\n    The trial of the beef packers continues at Chicago. E. Dana\r\n    Durand, chief assistant to Commissioner Garfield, testifies\r\n    that the Department of Commerce turned over certain data\r\n    obtained from the packers to the Department of Justice.\r\n\r\n    Sixteen miners are killed by an explosion at Maitland, Colorado.\r\n\r\n    A sub-committee of the House Committee on Interstate and\r\n    Foreign Commerce takes action on the Tillman, Gillespie and\r\n    Campbell resolution to authorize the Interstate Commerce\r\n    Committee to investigate the connection between railroads and\r\n    coal and oil companies. All three of the resolutions will be\r\n    embodied in one and sent back to the House for passage.\r\n\r\n    The Interstate Commerce Commission orders an investigation\r\n    of the rates and practices of the railroad carriers engaged\r\n    in transporting oil from Kansas and Indian Territory to\r\n    interstate destinations.\r\n\r\n    Representative Campbell introduces a joint resolution to\r\n    authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to immediately\r\n    investigate and report to Congress from time to time whether\r\n    any interstate commerce carriers own or control any oil or\r\n    other products which they ship as common carriers; whether the\r\n    officers of such carriers charged with the distribution of\r\n    cars and furnishing facilities for transportation are directly\r\n    or indirectly owners of companies interested in oil products;\r\n    whether a combination in restraint of trade exists between the\r\n    carriers and the shippers of oil products, and whether the\r\n    officers of oil companies are officers, agents or members of\r\n    the directory of any common carrier.\r\n\r\n    Congressman Mann, of Illinois, introduces a bill to make\r\n    insurance business interstate commerce.\r\n\r\n    Senator Tillman introduces a bill in the Senate to prohibit\r\n    corporations from making money contributions in connection with\r\n    political elections.\r\n\r\nFebruary 20.—The McCurdys prepare to fight the suits brought against them\r\nby the Mutual Life Insurance Co. for the restitution of money illegally\r\ntaken from the company. The McCurdys and Raymond & Co. also charge that\r\nother officials and trustees of the Mutual received rebates on their own\r\npolicies.\r\n\r\n    Opinions of prominent lawyers show that the Supreme Court’s\r\n    decision against railroads owning commodities which they haul\r\n    as common carriers will prevent railroads from operating if\r\n    not from owning coal mines. Most of the big coal mines in\r\n    the country are either owned, controlled or operated by the\r\n    railroads.\r\n\r\n    Commissioner of Corporations James R. Garfield testifies in the\r\n    case of the Government against the beef packers now being tried\r\n    at Chicago. He denies that he promised the packers immunity\r\n    from prosecution or that all information given him would be\r\n    regarded as confidential.\r\n\r\n    Pittsburg, Pa., follows the example of other cities and throws\r\n    off the yoke of boss rule. George W. Guthrie, a Democrat\r\n    supported by the independent factions, defeats Alexander M.\r\n    Jenkinson, the Republican candidate of the Frick-Mellon-Cassatt\r\n    combination.\r\n\r\n    The House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce\r\n    recommends a favorable report to the House on the bill for an\r\n    investigation by the Interstate Commerce Commission of the\r\n    relations between railroads and coal and oil companies. This is\r\n    the resolution introduced in the Senate by Senator Tillman,\r\n    with a few modifications of the Gillespie and Campbell\r\n    resolutions substituted.\r\n\r\nFebruary 21.—President Roosevelt announces that he will not try to\r\ninfluence the Senate Committee’s action on the Hepburn railroad rate\r\nbill, but intimates that he will veto any bill that does not meet his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n    John Mitchell declares there will be a coal strike in the\r\n    bituminous coal fields.\r\n\r\n    The Senate passes a pure food bill by a vote of 63 to 4.\r\n    The bill makes it a crime to ship from one state to another\r\n    any article of food, drugs, medicines or liquors which is\r\n    adulterated or misbranded, or which contains any poisonous or\r\n    deleterious substances.\r\n\r\n    General Grosvenor, of Ohio, is defeated for re-nomination to\r\n    Congress. Gen. Grosvenor has been in Congress twenty years.\r\n\r\n    The House of Representatives takes up the army appropriation\r\n    bill. Chairman Hull, of Iowa, urges the need of preparing for\r\n    an emergency, as there is fear of trouble with China.\r\n\r\n    John A. McCall is buried in New York City. McCall left no money\r\n    and the suits for recovery of money illegally paid Hamilton\r\n    will be dropped.\r\n\r\n    Because of his stand for an honest investigation of the Mutual\r\n    Life Insurance Co., the trustees who fear exposure plan to oust\r\n    Stuyvesant Fish from the presidency of the Illinois Central\r\n    Railroad.\r\n\r\nFebruary 22.—John Mitchell, president of the United Mine Workers, has\r\nanother conference with several mine operators on a new scale of wages to\r\nbe paid after April 1.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Minor Morris, who was forcibly ejected from the White\r\n    House some time ago, issues a statement in which she denounces\r\n    the President for her treatment.\r\n\r\n    Senator Knox, of Pennsylvania, introduces a railroad rate\r\n    regulation bill giving the courts the right to review any\r\n    order or action of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It is\r\n    the intention of the railroad senators to add the court review\r\n    clause of the Knox bill to the Hepburn bill.\r\n\r\n    In the report to the New York Legislature the Armstrong,\r\n    or Insurance Investigating, Committee, makes the following\r\n    recommendations.\r\n\r\n    Not only should stock corporations be permitted to give\r\n    policy-holders the right to vote, but an opportunity should be\r\n    afforded for conversion into purely mutual companies.\r\n\r\n    The law as to investments in securities should be amended so as\r\n    to provide: That no investment in the stock of any corporation\r\n    shall be permitted, except in public stocks of municipal\r\n    corporations.\r\n\r\n    The statute should forbid all syndical participations,\r\n    transactions for purchase and sale on joint account, and the\r\n    making of any agreement providing that the company shall\r\n    withhold from sale for any time or subject to the discretion of\r\n    others any securities which it may own or acquire.\r\n\r\n    No officer or director should be pecuniarily interested in any\r\n    purchase, sale or loan made by the corporation.\r\n\r\n    Contributions by insurance corporations for political purposes\r\n    should be strictly forbidden.... Any officer, director\r\n    or agent, making, authorizing or consenting to any such\r\n    contribution should be guilty of a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\n    The company should be compelled to set forth in its annual\r\n    statement to the Superintendent of Insurance all sums so\r\n    disbursed (for lobbying), giving the names of the payees, the\r\n    amounts paid and the specific purpose of the payment.\r\n\r\n    Limit the amount of new business; prohibit bonuses, prizes\r\n    and awards; limit renewal commissions to four years and to,\r\n    say, 10 per cent. of the first year’s premiums; prohibit loans\r\n    and advances to agents; limit total expenses to the total\r\n    “loadings” upon the premiums.\r\n\r\n    The companies should be required annually to file with the\r\n    Superintendent of Insurance a gain and loss exhibit for the\r\n    year in a prescribed form, showing the amount available for\r\n    distribution, the amount of dividends declared and the method\r\n    of calculation by which they have been determined.\r\n\r\n    Section 56 should be repealed and the matter should be left\r\n    subject to the general provisions of the Code of Civil\r\n    Procedure relating to actions against corporations.\r\n\r\n    In addition to requiring approval of the Superintendent of\r\n    other than certain standard forms, provision should be made\r\n    for the standardization of the new types of policies.... The\r\n    issue of other policies than those thus provided for should be\r\n    prohibited.\r\n\r\n    The committee recommends publicity of names and addresses\r\n    of policy-holders and the giving them the right to verify\r\n    statements and prosecute for falsity. The committee recommends\r\n    requiring statements in elaborate detail covering all\r\n    transactions, and favors giving the Superintendent of Insurance\r\n    power to examine under oath.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23.—Stuyvesant Fish resigns as a trustee from the Mutual Life\r\nInsurance Co. and will head a committee of policy-holders to fight the\r\npresent management.\r\n\r\n    Insurance men plan to fight the new laws recommended by the\r\n    Armstrong Committee before the New York Legislature, and, if\r\n    unsuccessful there, to carry the matter before the courts.\r\n\r\n    The Hepburn railroad rate regulation bill is reported by the\r\n    Senate committee without any amendments. Through trickery of\r\n    Senator Aldrich, the bill will be presented to the Senate by\r\n    Senator Tillman as a Democratic measure.\r\n\r\n    The House of Representatives passes a resolution ordering an\r\n    investigation of the relations between coal and oil carrying\r\n    railroads and coal and oil companies.\r\n\r\n    Commissioner Garfield again testifies in the trial of the beef\r\n    packers at Chicago. He admits that the Department of Commerce\r\n    and Labor furnished the Department of Justice with evidence.\r\n\r\n    Johann Hoch, the noted bigamist, is hanged at Chicago.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24.—The House Committee on Immigration unanimously agrees on a\r\nbill to amend the immigration laws. The new bill will make naturalization\r\nuniform throughout the United States, and confines the issuance of\r\ncitizenship papers to United States Circuit and District Courts, and\r\nto the highest court of original jurisdiction of each state. The bill\r\nfurther provides that an alien must be able to read, write and speak\r\nEnglish before he can become a citizen.\r\n\r\n    Since Senator Aldrich’s trick of having Senator Tillman, of\r\n    South Carolina, report the Hepburn railroad rate bill, which\r\n    makes it a Democratic measure, Washington despatches state\r\n    that the long standing feud between the President and Senator\r\n    Tillman will end.\r\n\r\nFebruary 25.—C. Augustus Seton, who is under arrest in New York City,\r\nconfesses to forging $4,300,000 worth of Norfolk and Western Railroad\r\nstock certificates.\r\n\r\n    Coal mine operators give out statements saying there will be a\r\n    strike, as they will refuse to grant the miners’ requests. T.\r\n    L. Lewis, vice-president of the United Mine Workers, declares\r\n    there will be no strike and that the operators will grant the\r\n    requests of the miners.\r\n\r\n    Harry Orchard, who assassinated the late Governor Steunenberg,\r\n    of Idaho, confesses to taking part in 26 murders.\r\n\r\n    Ex-Speaker David B. Henderson dies at Dubuque, Iowa. Mr.\r\n    Henderson served two terms as speaker, succeeding the late\r\n    Thomas B. Reed. He was elected in 1883 and served continuously\r\n    until the end of the Fifty-seventh Congress.\r\n\r\nFebruary 26.—The Missouri Supreme Court hands down a decision which\r\nit is believed will influence the Supreme Court of New York to order\r\nH. H. Rogers to answer the questions asked him in the Standard Oil\r\ninvestigation. At the time Attorney-General Hadley, of Missouri, was\r\ntaking depositions in the case in New York City, Rogers was put on the\r\nwitness stand. He refused to answer certain questions and expressed\r\nhis contempt for Missouri Courts. Mr. Hadley went before Justice\r\nGildersleeve, of the New York Supreme Court, and asked for an order\r\nforcing Rogers to answer or be held in contempt of court. The order was\r\nrefused on the grounds that the questions involved had never been passed\r\nupon by the Missouri courts. Now comes the Missouri court with a strong\r\ndecision which covers every point at issue.\r\n\r\n    President Roosevelt intervenes to prevent the threatened coal\r\n    strike.\r\n\r\n    In accordance with a decision handed down by the Supreme Court\r\n    of Texas, the Pacific, the United States, the American and\r\n    Wells-Fargo Express Companies, and fifty of the principal\r\n    railroads of the state, will have to pay $5,225,000 in\r\n    penalties for violating the anti-trust law. The court holds\r\n    that when a railroad company enters into an agreement with\r\n    an express company which excludes other companies from doing\r\n    a business on its lines, it restrains trade and stifles\r\n    competition, which is prohibited by the anti-trust law.\r\n\r\n    The supposed shrewd trick of Senator Aldrich in having Senator\r\n    Tillman report the Hepburn railroad rate bill now has the\r\n    Republican Senators embarrassed. The Senate seems to be in\r\n    favor of the bill and the Republicans dare not let it pass as a\r\n    Democratic measure. Realizing that something must be done, they\r\n    appeal to Senator Spooner to draft a rate bill that will suit\r\n    all factions of the Republicans and be put through the Senate\r\n    as a party measure.\r\n\r\n    William Nelson Cromwell, the New York lawyer who unloaded the\r\n    Panama Canal property on the United States, and who has since\r\n    acted as counsel to the President and Secretary Taft on Panama\r\n    matters, appears before the Senate committee. He denies that he\r\n    was the cause of ex-Chief Engineer Wallace’s resigning. When\r\n    questioned as to his dealings with Secretary Taft he refused to\r\n    answer.\r\n\r\nFebruary 27.—Steel Trust officials and George Gould order the bituminous\r\ncoal mine operators to make peace with the miners and prevent a strike.\r\n\r\n    The Insurance Commissioners of Kentucky, Minnesota, Wisconsin,\r\n    Tennessee and Nebraska ask the New York Insurance Department to\r\n    co-operate with them in making an investigation of the Mutual\r\n    Life Insurance Co.\r\n\r\n    William Nelson Cromwell again appears before the Senate\r\n    Committee on Interoceanic Canals. He continues to refuse to\r\n    answer questions as to his dealings with Secretary Taft and the\r\n    amount of his fees. Senator Morgan, of Alabama, produced a\r\n    copy of Cromwell’s contract with the French company, or Panama\r\n    Canal Co., which gave Cromwell the power to organize companies,\r\n    issue stock, bonds, etc., and finance any and all sorts of\r\n    organizations to further the idea of selling the canal to the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\nFebruary 28.—It is reported from Pittsburg that the United States Steel\r\nCorporation, through President W. Ellis Corey, has demanded of the\r\nPittsburg Coal Company, with which it has a twenty-five-year contract\r\nfor coal, the minimum for each year being set at 8,000,000 tons, that\r\nthere be no strike in the Pittsburg district. At the same time the Gould\r\ninterests, so heavy in the West and Southwest, have ordered peace. As a\r\nresult there will be no strike of the bituminous miners, who will receive\r\na satisfactory advance.\r\n\r\n    It is reported from Springfield, Ohio, that local militia,\r\n    called out to check a race riot caused by the shooting of M.\r\n    M. Davis, a brakeman, by a negro, has been unable to stop the\r\n    riot. An appeal has been made to the Governor to send more\r\n    troops. Early this morning houses were burning in the negro\r\n    quarter, and the authorities are powerless.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday the President signed the Urgent Deficiency Bill,\r\n    which contains an appropriation of $118,000 for New York State\r\n    to pay its claim for money to equip Government troops during\r\n    the War of 1812.\r\n\r\n    Five hundred delegates of the Independence League, guests of\r\n    William R. Hearst, appeared yesterday at Albany to plead before\r\n    the Governor and the Legislature for the passage of measures in\r\n    which the league is interested.\r\n\r\n    The Commissioners of Insurance in the states of Kentucky,\r\n    Minnesota, Wisconsin, Tennessee and Nebraska have requested the\r\n    Insurance Department of New York State to co-operate with them\r\n    in an investigation of the Mutual Life Insurance Company.\r\n\r\n    It is reported from Little Rock, Ark., that Thomas E. Jordan,\r\n    former Controller of the Equitable Life Insurance Company, and\r\n    who could not be located during the Armstrong Investigation, is\r\n    stopping with his wife at Hot Springs, Ark.\r\n\r\n    The debate in the Senate on the railroad rate question opens\r\n    today with a speech by Senator Foraker, of Ohio.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday, before the Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals,\r\n    Senator Morgan, of Alabama, in his examination of William\r\n    Nelson Cromwell, produced an agreement between the Panama Canal\r\n    Commission and William Nelson Cromwell, showing that for a\r\n    large compensation the Panama Canal Company contracted to pay\r\n    William Nelson Cromwell a large compensation to Americanize\r\n    the Panama project. Mr. Cromwell said the enterprise proposed\r\n    in the document was abortive and died long ago. Senator Morgan\r\n    tried to learn from Mr. Cromwell how much he had received in\r\n    fees from the old or new Panama Company and by persistent\r\n    questioning deduced the fact that the total payments to Mr.\r\n    Cromwell did not exceed $200,000, extending over a term of\r\n    years, and giving to him from $10,000 to $15,000 a year. Mr.\r\n    Cromwell declined to say what service he had performed for\r\n    these sums, admitting only that his clients were satisfied. The\r\n    inquiry will be continued.\r\n\r\n    At a dinner yesterday at Washington the Republican members\r\n    of Congress from New York proposed as the next nominee of\r\n    the Republican Party for Governor of New York State, Charles\r\n    E. Hughes, the inquisitor of the Armstrong Investigation\r\n    Committee. The platform indicated was based on general reform\r\n    and municipal ownership.\r\n\r\n    The Inter-State Commerce Commission at Washington yesterday\r\n    announced its decision in the cases of the Fred G. Clark\r\n    Company against the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway\r\n    Company and the Waverley Oil Works against the Pennsylvania\r\n    Company and others. In these cases the New York, New Haven and\r\n    Hartford Railroad Company was the principal defendant. The\r\n    commission holds that the combination rates on petroleum and\r\n    its product from Cleveland and Pittsburg to points reached\r\n    by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad result in\r\n    unreasonable and unjust rates, and that the refusal of the\r\n    railroad company to consent to participate in through rates\r\n    is unjust and the situation is such as to favor greatly the\r\n    Standard Oil. In its final conclusion the commission holds\r\n    that the act to regulate commerce does not authorize it to\r\n    compel the establishment of joint rates or the conditions\r\n    of interchange in case the connecting carriers fail to\r\n    agree in respect thereto; and it therefore concludes that\r\n    notwithstanding that the combination rates are unjust and the\r\n    general shipping situation is such as to work a practical\r\n    monopoly in favor of the Standard Oil Company, the Commission\r\n    is without authority to grant relief in these cases and the\r\n    petitions are therefore dismissed.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday at Washington the House Committee of Agriculture\r\n    decided by a vote of 8 to 7 not to recommend any appropriation\r\n    to buy seeds for free distribution by the Department of\r\n    Agriculture.\r\n\r\n    Special counsel for the State of Missouri will make application\r\n    before the New York courts to compel Henry H. Rogers to answer\r\n    questions in the inquiry the State of Missouri has been making\r\n    into Standard Oil methods.\r\n\r\n    In the United States Circuit Court at Chicago yesterday, Judge\r\n    Landis gave a decision that the Interstate Commerce Committee\r\n    has the power to compel witnesses to answer questions in\r\n    the hearing of Street’s Western Stable Car Line before the\r\n    commission.\r\n\r\n    At Oklahoma City, Okla., yesterday, the assistant\r\n    attorney-general began to take testimony in the ouster case\r\n    against the Standard and other oil companies. A wholesale oil\r\n    dealer testified that he had been instructed to get samples of\r\n    oil shipped if he had to steal them; and also that there had\r\n    never been any competition between the Standard Oil and the\r\n    Waters-Pierce Company in Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n    At Albany yesterday, Senator Saxe’s bill to impose a tax on\r\n    personal property wherever found, a measure designed to wipe\r\n    out tax dodging by rich New Yorkers who establish their legal\r\n    residence elsewhere, was passed in the Senate and goes to the\r\n    Governor.\r\n\r\n    At Aiken, S. C., yesterday, Professor S. P. Langley, Secretary\r\n    of the Smithsonian Institution, died of paralysis.\r\n\r\nMarch 1.—Senator Foraker in the Senate yesterday made a speech, lasting\r\nthree hours, in which he attacked the Hepburn railroad rate bill.\r\n\r\n    For several hours last evening the city of Springfield, Ohio,\r\n    was in the hands of a mob which burned two houses and partly\r\n    destroyed a dozen others. All of these houses were inhabited by\r\n    negroes. Hundreds of negroes have fled from the city.\r\n\r\n    The annual report of the Pennsylvania Railroad shows a net\r\n    income for the year 1905 of more than $38,000,000, an increase\r\n    of about $10,000,000 as compared with 1904. The operating\r\n    expenses were reduced and traffic increased.\r\n\r\n    At the annual meeting of the Equitable Life Assurance Society\r\n    yesterday the directors were informed that counsel of the\r\n    society were definitely engaged in working out a plan of\r\n    mutualization.\r\n\r\n    Richard A. McCurdy, former president of the Mutual Life\r\n    Insurance Company sails for Europe today for an indefinite stay\r\n    abroad.\r\n\r\n    William Nelson Cromwell reappeared yesterday before the Senate\r\n    Committee of Interoceanic Canals and admitted that he drew the\r\n    monetary agreement entered into between the Republic of Panama\r\n    and Secretary of War Taft. This agreement caused criticism\r\n    in the Senate recently because in fact it was a treaty made\r\n    without consulting that body.\r\n\r\n    At Washington the Foreign Relations Committee finished its\r\n    work on the Santo Domingo treaty and reported it to the Senate.\r\n    The Republicans voted solidly for the report and the Democrats\r\n    against it.\r\n\r\n    The Independence League of New York State has decided to\r\n    perfect an organization in every assembly district in the\r\n    State of New York. In William R. Hearst’s address at Albany\r\n    he said: “The fundamental idea of the Independence League is\r\n    independence of boss control, of corporate control and of any\r\n    party subject to boss rule and corporation control.”\r\n\r\n    Yesterday the Senate in executive session ratified the treaty\r\n    between the United States and Japan relating to copyrights of\r\n    works of literature and art.\r\n\r\nMarch 2.—It is reported from Washington that the President has been\r\nconferring with Senators, Representatives, members of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission and members of his Cabinet on the question of the\r\nHepburn railroad rate bill, and he is willing to accept three or four\r\namendments of the bill if they will strengthen it for trial before the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n    At Springfield, Ohio, the state militia charged the mob and\r\n    dispersed it. The members of the Commercial Club of that city\r\n    met to take action for the enforcement of the law, and said in\r\n    speeches that the present conditions were due to politicians\r\n    catering to negroes and low whites, and lax police and court\r\n    methods.\r\n\r\n    John F. Wallace, formerly chief engineer of the Panama Canal\r\n    Commission, becomes an employee of the George Westinghouse\r\n    Company at a salary of $50,000 per year. Mr. Wallace is to\r\n    assist in building electric railways paralleling steam railways\r\n    in many parts of the country.\r\n\r\n    It is reported from Washington that our Government takes a very\r\n    serious and gloomy view of the situation at Algeciras, and\r\n    would not be surprised to see the Moroccan conference end in a\r\n    rupture.\r\n\r\n    The existence of a Mutual Life policy-holders’ movement of\r\n    world-wide scope, at the head of which will undoubtedly be\r\n    Stuyvesant Fish, became known yesterday through the exchange\r\n    of telegrams between Lord Northcliffe, formerly Sir Alfred\r\n    Harmsworth, and Mr. Fish. Lord Northcliffe is chairman of the\r\n    British protection committee of the Mutual Life policy holders.\r\n\r\nMarch 3.—John R. Walsh, president of the Chicago National Bank, which\r\nfailed December 18, 1905, was arrested yesterday on a Federal warrant\r\ncharging him with violation of the national banking laws in making false\r\nreports to the Controller of Currency and with conversion to his own use\r\nof bank funds amounting to $3,000,000. He was released after giving a\r\nbond of $50,000.\r\n\r\n    At Meridian, Miss., a tornado swept through the business centre\r\n    of the town, destroying $5,000,000 of property and about\r\n    thirteen lives.\r\n\r\n    Springfield, Ohio, is quiet after two nights of rioting and\r\n    incendiary fires. The state militia is still on duty.\r\n\r\n    At Chicago, executives of all the Eastern railways in session\r\n    failed to settle the differential rate controversy. On account\r\n    of the attitude of the Erie Railroad it seems impossible to\r\n    avert a rate war. Every line except the Erie voted for the\r\n    arbitration of the question.\r\n\r\n    The Senate Committee of the Philippines voted to smother the\r\n    Philippine tariff bill yesterday. It is said that efforts will\r\n    be made to have the measure reconsidered or called before the\r\n    Senate.\r\n\r\n    Commissioner of Public Works, J. M. Patterson, of Chicago,\r\n    yesterday gave his resignation to Mayor Dunne. Mr. Patterson\r\n    says he has become a convert to Socialism.\r\n\r\nMarch 4.—A delegation representing practically all life insurance\r\ncompanies doing business in the United States will go to Albany on\r\nMarch 9, the day set for the hearing of the bills that the insurance\r\ninvestigation has presented, to state the case of the companies before\r\nthe Legislature.\r\n\r\n    Ex-Governor James Stephen Hogg died yesterday at Houston, Tex.\r\n    at the age of 55.\r\n\r\nMarch 5.—It is reported that on the evening before his death the late\r\nEx-Governor Hogg said: “I want no monument of stone, but let my children\r\nplant at the head of my grave a pecan tree, and at the foot a walnut\r\ntree, and when these trees shall bear, let the pecans and walnuts be\r\ngiven out among the plain people of Texas that they may plant them and\r\nmake Texas a land of trees.”\r\n\r\n    At St. Augustine, Fla., yesterday, Lieutenant-General John M.\r\n    Schofield, retired, died of cerebral hemorrhage at the age of\r\n    75.\r\n\r\nMarch 6.—In the House of Representatives at Washington, John Sharp\r\nWilliams attacked the President and the Attorney-General and introduced\r\na resolution, which was passed by the House, inquiring whether the\r\nDepartment of Justice had instituted criminal prosecutions against any\r\nof the individuals or corporations adjudged by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States in the Northern Securities case to have violated the\r\nanti-trust laws.\r\n\r\n    The Enterprise Transportation Company, carrying freight between\r\n    New York and Fall River, Mass., appeared before the Interstate\r\n    Commerce Commission in New York City, complaining that the\r\n    trunk lines out of New York refused to make through freight\r\n    rate arrangements with the Enterprise Transportation Company.\r\n    Lawyers representing nearly all the big railroads were present.\r\n\r\nMarch 7.—Andrew Hamilton, who was legislative agent for the New York\r\nLife Insurance Company at Albany, returned yesterday to New York. On the\r\nsteamship he was registered as “H. A. Milton.”\r\n\r\n    The suit of the State of Kansas against the Standard Oil\r\n    Company was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Kansas on March\r\n    5th. This ends, so far as present litigation is concerned, the\r\n    movement begun a year ago by Kansas against the Standard Oil\r\n    Company and re-establishes that corporation in the position it\r\n    held previous to the effort made to exclude it from the state.\r\n\r\n    Yesterday District-Attorney Jerome of New York City appeared\r\n    before the grand jury and asked that indictments be found\r\n    against the despoilers of the life insurance companies.\r\n\r\n    In the 20th annual report of the Boston Chamber of Commerce,\r\n    published yesterday, it is pointed out that Boston has become\r\n    re-established as the second port of the country.\r\n\r\nMarch 8.—W. H. Moore, Municipal Ownership candidate for Mayor of Seattle,\r\nwas elected on a platform pledged to municipal ownership of public\r\nutilities.\r\n\r\n    All over the Dominion of Canada the banks are collecting\r\n    American silver money and shipping it to Montreal, whence it\r\n    is shipped to Washington and changed for gold. The removal of\r\n    American silver from Canada will be a good thing for the banks\r\n    and profitable for the government. The banks will be paid of ⅜\r\n    of one per cent for collecting it and the government will bear\r\n    all transportation charges. It is estimated that the government\r\n    will clear at least one-half of a million dollars.\r\n\r\n    It is reported that Andrew Hamilton, the legislative agent for\r\n    the New York Life Insurance Company, who has just returned\r\n    from Paris, consulted with District-Attorney Jerome before his\r\n    return to find out just what his chances were with the law.\r\n\r\n    It has been learned that the National City Bank and the Hanover\r\n    Bank were the only two New York Banks who received yesterday\r\n    their allotment of a special deposit of $10,000,000 of\r\n    government funds which Secretary Shaw last week announced. The\r\n    news has caused much talk and criticism in banking circles.\r\n\r\n    In a special message to the Senate and the House the President\r\n    said that the action of both houses in passing the resolution\r\n    directing the Interstate Commerce Commission to investigate the\r\n    subject of railroad rate discriminations and monopolies in\r\n    coal and oil was hasty, ill-considered and ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Foreign News_\r\n\r\nFebruary 9.—Mutiny is said to continue in the Russian Black Sea fleet.\r\nAdmiral Chouknin is wounded by a woman at Sevastopol.

Wu Ting Fang, former\r\nMinister to the United States, says China is passing through a crisis. He\r\njustifies the boycott of American goods. All missionaries are advised by\r\nAssistant Secretary of State Bacon to move to places where they can be\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n    Despatches from Algeciras state that the fear of war over\r\n    Germany’s rejection of France’s proposals on the Moroccan\r\n    question is growing less.\r\n\r\n    Bills providing for general suffrage are introduced in the\r\n    Lower House of the Austrian Parliament.\r\n\r\n    Reports from St. Petersburg state that Count Witte has not\r\n    resigned.\r\n\r\n    A revolt against the Turkish Government is reported to be\r\n    spreading in Yemen, Turkish Arabia.\r\n\r\nFebruary 24.—W. K. Vanderbilt, Jr., is attacked by a mob near Pisa,\r\nItaly, after his automobile runs down and injures a boy.\r\n\r\n    Active preparations are being made at Manila for any trouble\r\n    with China.\r\n\r\n    Director General Ivanoff, of the Vistula Railroad, is\r\n    assassinated at Warsaw, Russia.\r\n\r\n    The Spanish Government distributes money in the famine stricken\r\n    provinces to relieve the sufferings of the people and prevent\r\n    disorders.\r\n\r\n    The German Foreign Office states that there is little danger\r\n    of war between Germany and France over the Moroccan question.\r\n    French despatches say about the same.\r\n\r\nFebruary 25.—More riots occur at Warsaw and Odessa, Russia. Six persons\r\nare killed and 15 wounded.\r\n\r\n    The customs war between Austria and Servia ends. Servia agrees\r\n    to Austria’s demands.\r\n\r\n    Secretary Root says the United States has no right to interfere\r\n    with conditions in the Congo Free State, Africa.\r\n\r\n    President Castro, of Venezuela, declares he will clear his\r\n    country of all foreigners, break up the Monroe Doctrine and\r\n    humble France.\r\n\r\n    Canada will appoint a commission to investigate life insurance\r\n    business in Canada.\r\n\r\n    Two packages of dynamite are found at a gate of the Forbidden\r\n    City, Peking, China.\r\n\r\nFebruary 26.—Despatches from Shanghai, China, tell of the murder of\r\nmissionaries at Nan-Chang. Six Jesuits and two members of an English\r\nfamily are reported murdered. The remaining foreigners escaped to\r\nKiu-Kiang in boats. Several missions at Nan-Chang and Kiang-se were\r\ndestroyed, among them the American.\r\n\r\nFebruary 27.—The Americans who escaped the Nan-Chang, China, massacre are\r\nreported safe at Kiu-Kiang.\r\n\r\n    Cossacks knout several prisoners to death at Odessa, Russia.\r\n\r\n    Ex-Premier Balfour is elected to the British Parliament from\r\n    London.\r\n\r\n    Duchess Sophie Charlotte, of Oldenburg, and Prince Eitel\r\n    Frederick, second son of the Emperor of Germany, are married at\r\n    Berlin. The Emperor also celebrates his silver wedding.\r\n\r\n    France asks the Czar of Russia to use his influence to get\r\n    Germany to agree to France’s terms on the Moroccan question.\r\n\r\n    Premier Witte reopens negotiations to determine the extent of a\r\n    proposed agreement with England.\r\n\r\n    Japanese officers assume control of the Imperial War College\r\n    and the Trade and Commercial Schools at Canton, China. The\r\n    United States English and French war vessels sail for different\r\n    Chinese ports to protect foreigners.\r\n\r\nFebruary 28.—Duchess Sophia Charlotte Oldenburg, the daughter of the\r\nGrand Duke of Oldenburg and Prince Eitel Frederick, the second son of the\r\nEmperor of Germany, were married yesterday in the chapel of the palace at\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\n    President Caceres, of Santo Domingo, in a message to his\r\n    Congress, recommends the revision of the Constitution, of the\r\n    import and export duties, the improvement of the ports and\r\n    public roads, the enactment of laws benefiting agriculture, the\r\n    free administration of justice and other improvements becoming\r\n    a civilized nation. He recommends to Congress also the study\r\n    of the treaty now before the United States Senate and declares\r\n    that it is necessary to the welfare of his republic.\r\n\r\n    The leading papers of St. Petersburg evince no satisfaction\r\n    over the announcement of the date of the meeting of the Duma.\r\n    It is said that the Duma will be prorogued almost immediately\r\n    until autumn.\r\n\r\n    Premier Witte has become an advocate of an Anglo-Russian\r\n    understanding and it is reported that negotiations are about\r\n    to be opened in London to determine the extent of a proposed\r\n    agreement. If they are successful the new grouping of the\r\n    Powers will check Germany’s ambition.\r\n\r\n    It is reported from St. Petersburg that Russia is using all her\r\n    influence at Berlin to prevent a rupture between France and\r\n    Germany.\r\n\r\n    The French officials at the Moroccan Conference at Algeciras\r\n    do not look favorably upon the Berlin report that Germany will\r\n    make concessions if France will also yield something. The\r\n    French say that they have made concessions to which Germany has\r\n    not responded.\r\n\r\n    It is reported from Manila that Japanese officers have\r\n    assumed control of the imperial war college and the trade and\r\n    commercial schools at Canton, China.\r\n\r\n    The battleship _Ohio_, flagship of the American fleet at the\r\n    Asiatic station, has sailed for Hong Kong, where it will dock\r\n    and make repairs, so as to be ready for possible emergencies.\r\n\r\n    A telegram from Odessa states that in the village of Ivanislaw,\r\n    in the Province of Kherson, 50 Cossacks and 70 gunners appeared\r\n    a few days ago under orders from a police official and knouted\r\n    13 peasants. One of these peasants went mad and others are\r\n    dying. A schoolmaster became insane after witnessing the scene.\r\n    The sole offense chargeable against the villagers was their\r\n    re-election of communal representatives which was in conformity\r\n    with the ukase of Dec. 24 last.\r\n\r\nMarch 1.—The reactionary policy of Interior Minister Durnovo received a\r\nsetback yesterday when the action of the St. Petersburg police in closing\r\nthe central bureau of the Constitutional Democracy was disowned by the\r\nGovernment. Permission was given for the reopening of the bureau.\r\n\r\n    A dispatch from St. Petersburg says that the financial\r\n    embarrassments of Russia are increased by the necessity of\r\n    paying Japan for the maintenance of Russian prisoners.\r\n\r\n    The new general tariff and conventional tariffs between Russia\r\n    and Germany, France, and Austria-Hungary go into effect today.\r\n\r\nMarch 2.—It is reported from Shanghai that the Chinese Government has\r\ndecided to instruct its ministers abroad to assure the Powers that there\r\nis no cause for uneasiness in the present situation in China and that\r\nthere are no signs of an anti-foreign movement.\r\n\r\nMarch 3.—As the result of a series of special councils composed of forty\r\nhigh dignitaries presided over by the Czar, the main guarantees of\r\nliberty have been granted to the Russian people and a manifesto is to be\r\ncoded and incorporated in the laws of the empire.\r\n\r\nMarch 4.—A terrific cyclone swept over the Society and Cook’s Islands\r\nin the Pacific Ocean on February 7 and 8. It is said 10,000 persons\r\nperished. The damage to property is estimated at a million dollars.\r\n\r\nMarch 5.—At Tokio a bill was introduced in the Diet providing for the\r\nnationalization of the railways, and authorizing the government to compel\r\ncompanies to sell out to it at a price based on the cost of building plus\r\ntwenty times the average profits for the last three years.\r\n\r\nMarch 6.—It is reported that the Germans have refused any concessions at\r\nthe Moroccan conference at Algeciras. Russia proposed that France and\r\nSpain control the policing of Morocco. France was willing to accept the\r\nproposition, which was indorsed by Spain, Portugal and England. Herr von\r\nRadowitz, chief German delegate, opposed the proposal.\r\n\r\n    The editor of a Barcelona (Spain) daily paper was sentenced to\r\n    eight years’ imprisonment for printing an insulting dispatch\r\n    concerning King Alfonso.\r\n\r\nMarch 7.—An imperial manifesto has been published setting forth the\r\ndecisions of the imperial council with regard to the execution of the\r\nCzar’s manifesto of last October. The manifesto reveals the purpose of\r\nthe government to keep a firm check on the Duma. The imperial veto is\r\nabsolute. The Czar controls the upper house; and the ministers have power\r\nto legislate when the parliament is not sitting.\r\n\r\n    The Rouvier Ministry of France is defeated in the Chamber\r\n    of Deputies by a combination against the Anti-Clericals and\r\n    immediately resigns.\r\n\r\nMarch 8.—Reported from Berlin, intense indignation and mortification are\r\nshown at Russia’s action in throwing off her reserve and standing by\r\nFrance in the proposition that the control of the police of Morocco shall\r\nbe entrusted to France and Spain. It is said that no more concessions can\r\nbe obtained and that Germany must now show her hand and back down; that\r\nVon Radowitz, representing Germany at Morocco, will be sacrificed. There\r\nis also talk of Von Buelow’s resignation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Along The Firing Line_\r\n\r\n_BY The Circulation Manager_]\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary was our best month for subscriptions at the time I wrote for the\r\nMarch number, but I guessed that February would be better still—and I\r\nguessed correctly. Although January had 27 business days, as against 22\r\nin February (Lincoln’s and Washington’s birthdays cut in on the little,\r\nshort month), yet we received nearly fifty-one per cent more renewals\r\nand new subscriptions in the latter month. And if we may judge the March\r\nbusiness by the first three days (I write this March 4), the stormy\r\nmonth will bring more subscriptions than January and February combined.\r\nIt may possibly be a case of “coming in like a lion and going out like\r\na lamb”—but I do not think so. Our subscribers, agents, and clubbing\r\nnewspapers are showing a much greater interest than formerly—and as the\r\nlist grows our field of opportunity broadens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne would naturally suppose that every subscription received would\r\nnarrow our field—but it doesn’t. On the contrary. I can imagine a state\r\nof affairs—a list so large—that every subscriber secured would make it\r\nharder to get another, for we can’t expect every man, woman and child to\r\ntake any one publication. But no magazine ever reached that dizzy height.\r\nPractically every subscriber we get is a missionary who brings in at\r\nleast one convert within the year, and many of them send in dozens of\r\nnew subscriptions. I need hardly use space in saying that we thoroughly\r\nappreciate these kindnesses and endeavor to show our appreciation by\r\nmaking WATSON’S MAGAZINE better and better each month. That’s a foregone\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTemporarily, however, we are embarrassed by the great influx of\r\nsubscriptions, and for a little while we ask the kind indulgence of our\r\nfriends. Everything shall be taken care of, but for a few weeks there may\r\nbe some delays. It takes time to train new subscription clerks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur one weakness heretofore has been lack of proper organization to keep\r\nin touch with and look after the interests of the news-dealers. This has\r\nbeen remedied by placing a thoroughly competent man in charge of the\r\nnews-dealer circulation. A complete roster of the news-dealers is being\r\nmade and every effort will be put forth to increase news-stand sales.\r\nThe tens of thousands of booksellers and news-dealers throughout the\r\nUnited States, supplied by the American News Company and its branches,\r\nconstitute an army of distribution which has taken many years and an\r\nimmense sum of money to raise and equip. We want to make use of that army\r\nto the best advantage of our patrons, the dealers and ourselves. Probably\r\nmore than one-half of the reading public buys regularly of news-dealers,\r\nand a much larger percentage buys occasionally. Wherever our friends\r\nprefer to buy of the dealer, we earnestly wish them to do so; and if at\r\nany time there is any difficulty in securing Watson’s at the news stands,\r\nwrite us about it. We are now equipped to take care of all complaints of\r\nthis character promptly.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, an immense reading public receiving mail on R. F.\r\nD. routes—yet it is only thirteen years ago that Mr. Watson, after a\r\nhard fight, secured a small appropriation in Congress to be used in\r\nexperiments with rural free delivery of mail—real “rural” delivery, not\r\nthe kind Mr. Wanamaker had tried in the small towns previously. But even\r\nafter Mr. Watson got the appropriation, Cleveland’s Postmaster-General\r\nrefused to use it. “Scandalous use of the people’s money,” he doubtless\r\nargued, “and, besides, it might develop into something which would hurt\r\nthe express companies.” To Mr. Watson is due the credit for securing\r\nthe first appropriation for rural free delivery. He is the father. But\r\nwe must give the devil his due—the Republican Party built up the system\r\nMr. Watson originated. Well, that party never was afraid to spend the\r\npeople’s money.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, these R. F. D. patrons get mail at their respective doors every\r\nweekday. They need not, and do not, go often to the nearest village or\r\ntown. Hence, they cannot so well depend upon news-dealers for WATSON’S.\r\nThey are best served by subscribing and having Uncle Sam’s mail-carrier\r\nbring it to the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe news-stand buyer pays thirty cents a year more for WATSON’S than does\r\nhis rural brother—but he invests a much smaller amount each time, so the\r\ntwo sacrifices (but it isn’t exactly correct to call buying WATSON’S\r\na “sacrifice”) are about equal. This calls to mind a suggestion, that\r\nhas been made several times, to allow taxes to be paid in instalments.\r\nCold-blooded figures say that it is exactly the same whether one pays a\r\n$24 tax in one payment, or in four of $6 each, or in 12 of $2 each; but\r\nactual experience says, No; there is a difference.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFunny, isn’t it, how the Republican Party denounces some proposition as\r\na Populistic vagary—and then turns ’round and does the very thing it\r\nhas denounced! In 1896 we were told that the people would have none\r\nof silver—those “fifty-cent dollars”; yet between 1897 and 1903 the\r\nRepublican Party coined more silver than in any other seven years of the\r\ncountry’s history. Not “free coinage,” of course, but that Sherman silver\r\nwhich was stacked up in vaults, and which no one wanted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPublic ownership was denounced as “confiscation,” anarchy, socialism,\r\npaternalism, and so on. But Teddy and Uncle Sam went into the railroad\r\nbusiness down in Panama, and only recently that fat boy, Taft, bought\r\n300 acres of coal lands at Batan, Philippine Islands, for $50,000,\r\nmoney voted by Congress for the purpose, and it is given out flatly\r\nthat “it is the intention of the Government not to relinquish title to\r\nthe mines.” They will be leased to competitive bidders. The Secretary\r\nof War is drawing a bill to provide for this leasing, and says, oh, ye\r\ngods, listen: That the Government will regulate the price of coal in the\r\nPhilippines!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDidn’t we hear something about the impossibility of doing such a stunt\r\nas “regulating prices” away back in 1896 and later? Couldn’t regulate\r\nthe price of silver by letting it into the mints at $1.39 plus an ounce.\r\nOh, no! Seems to me we ought to have an “International agreement” on\r\nthe price of coal. Otherwise, what’s to prevent those disreputable\r\n“furriners” from dumping their pauper-mined coal into the Philippines,\r\nand carrying away every ounce of our gold?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWho said the People’s Party is dead? Out in Coal City, Ill., the\r\nPopulists recently nominated the following village ticket:\r\n\r\n    The People’s Party met in Borella’s Hall and made the following\r\n    nominations: For trustees, two years, John McNamara, Peter\r\n    Bono, and Axtel Anderson. For village clerk, Edward Fulton. For\r\n    police magistrate, Frank Francis. For library directors, James\r\n    Leish and Walter Palmer.\r\n\r\nSome call it the decadence of party spirit, but others believe it a\r\nrecovery from partisan insanity—this independent attitude of men who\r\nformerly wore a party collar with meekness, if not with actual pride. A\r\nyear or more ago Dr. Engelhard, of Rising City, Neb., expressed it in the\r\npicturesque language of the West, thus: “I am now a political maverick.”\r\nAt a recent dinner of the Wisconsin Society of New York, Representative\r\nHenry C. Adams, of the Badger State, pleading for the “insurgents”\r\nwho are in rebellion, not “against good government but against bad\r\ngovernment,” graphically described the political situation of today as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    “Party feeling has run to the lowest ebb ever known in\r\n    American politics. It is hard work to tell a Democrat from\r\n    a Republican. The South is swinging toward protection. New\r\n    England is flirting with free trade. Pittsburg goes Democratic.\r\n    New York City barely escapes the rule of a Socialist.\r\n    Missouri sends Republicans to Congress. Folk is cheered by\r\n    Republicans. La Follette is voted for by Democrats. The House\r\n    of Representatives votes almost unanimously for the President’s\r\n    rate bill, and a Republican committee gives it in charge of a\r\n    Senator from South Carolina to report to the Senate.”\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Edgerton’s excellent article on “Farmers’ Organizations” (February\r\nnumber) he failed to mention a very strong one in the grain belt—the\r\nAmerican Society of Equity, with headquarters at Indianapolis. It claims\r\na membership of over 200,000 farmers, and its president, J. A. Everitt,\r\nasserts that its members will hold their wheat for $1.00 and other\r\ncereals correspondingly—and that they expect to win. Let’s hope they may.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut let’s think a little. That won’t cut down railroad dividends, or\r\nmake kerosene and rent any cheaper; and it _will_ make bread higher. So\r\nsuppose the Farmers’ Union, down South, pushes cotton up to 15 cents;\r\nand the American Society of Equity pushes wheat up to a dollar; and the\r\n“Big 6” here wins its fight for an 8-hour day at 9 hours’ pay—won’t all\r\nthese wealth-producers, after matters get readjusted, be about where they\r\nwere before? I’m not throwing cold water on the efforts of any of these\r\norganizations, for I glory in their fighting proclivities—but I can’t see\r\nany permanent advantage accruing to any of them so long as the railroads\r\nand the banks are armed with letters of marque and reprisal, and legally\r\nempowered to rob every actual producer and every consumer. Each of these\r\norganizations carefully avoids politics. Is that wise? Possibly; but I\r\ncan’t see it that way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“How shall I remit for subscriptions?” ask a number of agents. Well, most\r\nanything that will bring the money will do, but we have this preference:\r\nA United States Post Office Money Order, made out to TOM WATSON’S\r\nMAGAZINE. That will give us your name on the order, making it easy to\r\ntrace errors—and our bank charges no exchange for handling. But we never\r\nrefuse cheques, drafts, express orders, currency, or postage stamps, if\r\nsent us in good condition.\r\n\r\n“But,” I hear a chorus of voices saying, “we thought you’d changed the\r\nname, and just now you said ‘Tom Watson’s Magazine.’” Just so, I did.\r\nThat is the name of the corporation which publishes WATSON’S MAGAZINE.\r\nThe corporation known as Tom Watson’s Magazine has not changed its name.\r\nIt has five offices: President, vice-president, secretary, treasurer and\r\ncashier.
