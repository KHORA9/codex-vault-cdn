The recent accession of the important state of North Carolina to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States (of which official information has\r\nbeen received), the rising credit and respectability of our country, the\r\ngeneral and increasing good will toward the government of the Union, and\r\nthe concord, peace, and plenty with which we are blessed are circumstances\r\nauspicious in an eminent degree to our national prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn resuming your consultations for the general good you can not but derive\r\nencouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last session\r\nhave been as satisfactory to your constituents as the novelty and\r\ndifficulty of the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their\r\nexpectations and to secure the blessings which a gracious Providence has\r\nplaced within our reach will in the course of the present important session\r\ncall for the cool and deliberate exertion of your patriotism, firmness, and\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nAmong the many interesting objects which will engage your attention that of\r\nproviding for the common defense will merit particular regard. To be\r\nprepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.\r\n\r\nA free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a\r\nuniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest\r\nrequire that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them\r\nindependent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies.\r\n\r\nThe proper establishment of the troops which may be deemed indispensable\r\nwill be entitled to mature consideration. In the arrangements which may be\r\nmade respecting it it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable\r\nsupport of the officers and soldiers with a due regard to economy.\r\n\r\nThere was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to\r\ncertain hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the inhabitants of\r\nour southern and western frontiers from their depredations, but you will\r\nperceive from the information contained in the papers which I shall direct\r\nto be laid before you (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth\r\nof Virginia) that we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those\r\nparts of the Union, and, if necessary, to punish aggressors.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the United States require that our intercourse with other\r\nnations should be facilitated by such provisions as will enable me to\r\nfulfill my duty in that respect in the manner which circumstances may\r\nrender most conducive to the public good, and to this end that the\r\ncompensation to be made to the persons who may be employed should,\r\naccording to the nature of their appointments, be defined by law, and a\r\ncompetent fund designated for defraying the expenses incident to the\r\nconduct of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nVarious considerations also render it expedient that the terms on which\r\nforeigners may be admitted to the rights of citizens should be speedily\r\nascertained by a uniform rule of naturalization.\r\n\r\nUniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is\r\nan object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures by all proper\r\nmeans will not, I trust, need recommendation; but I can not forbear\r\nintimating to you the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well\r\nto the introduction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to the\r\nexertions of skill and genius in producing them at home, and of\r\nfacilitating the intercourse between the distant parts of our country by a\r\ndue attention to the post-office and post-roads.\r\n\r\nNor am I less persuaded that you will agree with me in opinion that there\r\nis nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of\r\nscience and literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of\r\npublic happiness. In one in which the measures of government receive their\r\nimpressions so immediately from the sense of the community as in ours it is\r\nproportionably essential.\r\n\r\nTo the security of a free constitution it contributes in various ways--by\r\nconvincing those who are intrusted with the public administration that\r\nevery valuable end of government is best answered by the enlightened\r\nconfidence of the people, and by teaching the people themselves to know and\r\nto value their own rights; to discern and provide against invasions of\r\nthem; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary exercise of\r\nlawful authority; between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their\r\nconvenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society;\r\nto discriminate the spirit of liberty from that of\r\nlicentiousness--cherishing the first, avoiding the last--and uniting a\r\nspeedy but temperate vigilance against encroachments, with an inviolable\r\nrespect to the laws.\r\n\r\nWhether this desirable object will be best promoted by affording aids to\r\nseminaries of learning already established, by the institution of a\r\nnational university, or by any other expedients will be well worthy of a\r\nplace in the deliberations of the legislature.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI saw with peculiar pleasure at the close of the last session the\r\nresolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion that an adequate\r\nprovision for the support of the public credit is a matter of high\r\nimportance to the national honor and prosperity. In this sentiment I\r\nentirely concur; and to a perfect confidence in your best endeavors to\r\ndevise such a provision as will be truly with the end I add an equal\r\nreliance on the cheerful cooperation of the other branch of the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to specify inducements to a measure in which the\r\ncharacter and interests of the United States are so obviously so deeply\r\nconcerned, and which has received so explicit a sanction from your\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI have directed the proper officers to lay before you, respectively, such\r\npapers and estimates as regard the affairs particularly recommended to your\r\nconsideration, and necessary to convey to you that information of the state\r\nof the Union which it is my duty to afford.\r\n\r\nThe welfare of our country is the great object to which our cares and\r\nefforts ought to be directed, and I shall derive great satisfaction from a\r\ncooperation with you in the pleasing though arduous task of insuring to our\r\nfellow citizens the blessings which they have a right to expect from a\r\nfree, efficient, and equal government.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge Washington\r\nDecember 8, 1790\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my\r\ncongratulations on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish\r\nour public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our\r\ncountry with plenty and with the means of a flourishing commerce.\r\n\r\nThe progress of public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of\r\nAmerican stock abroad as well as at home, and the revenues allotted for\r\nthis and other national purposes have been productive beyond the\r\ncalculations by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the\r\nmore pleasing, as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources,\r\nbut as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability\r\nand credit, and, let me add, as it bears an honorable testimony to the\r\npatriotism and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our citizens.\r\nThe punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been\r\nexemplary.\r\n\r\nIn conformity to the powers vested in me by acts of the last session, a\r\nloan of 3,000,000 florins, toward which some provisional measures had\r\npreviously taken place, has been completed in Holland. As well the celerity\r\nwith which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the\r\nmore than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe)\r\ngive a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may\r\nproceed with advantage and success. The Secretary of the Treasury has my\r\ndirections to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for\r\nmore precise information.\r\n\r\nSince your last sessions I have received communications by which it appears\r\nthat the district of Kentucky, at present a part of Virginia, has concurred\r\nin certain propositions contained in a law of that State, in consequence of\r\nwhich the district is to become a distinct member of the Union, in case the\r\nrequisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is\r\nnow made. I shall cause the papers on this very transaction to be laid\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nThe liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found\r\nto do great honor to both the parties, and the sentiments of warm\r\nattachment to the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow\r\ncitizens of Kentucky can not fail to add an affectionate concern for their\r\nparticular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will\r\ndecide on the case submitted to you.\r\n\r\nIt has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been\r\nmade on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the\r\nnorthwest side of the Ohio. These, with some of the tribes dwelling on and\r\nnear the Wabash, have of late been particularly active in their\r\ndepredations, and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and\r\naided by such parts of the neighboring tribes as could be seduced to join\r\nin their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and\r\nplunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane invitations and\r\novertures made on the part of the United States, renewed their violences\r\nwith fresh alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a number of valuable\r\ncitizens have thus been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances\r\npeculiarly shocking, whilst others have been carried into a deplorable\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nThese aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the\r\nWestern settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the\r\nGovernment of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than\r\nit is disposed to respect their rights and reward their attachments. As\r\nthis object could not be effected by defensive measures, it became\r\nnecessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out\r\nthe militia for the protection of the frontiers, and I have accordingly\r\nauthorized an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are\r\ncombined with such drafts of militia as were deemed sufficient. The event\r\nof the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary of War is directed to\r\nlay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded, as\r\nwell as an estimate of the expense with which it will be attended.\r\n\r\nThe disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical posture of\r\nthe great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us the more thankful for\r\nthe general peace and security enjoyed by the United States, reminds us at\r\nthe same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve\r\nthese blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency\r\nof a war, and even of preparations for a war, among the nations most\r\nconcerned in active commerce with this country to abridge the means, and\r\nthereby at least enhance the price, of transporting its valuable\r\nproductions to their markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections\r\nhow far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against\r\nembarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to our own\r\nnavigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent on\r\nforeign bottoms, which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to\r\nboth of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our\r\nown produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nYour attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our\r\ntrade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in\r\nrendering the present state of it distressful to us that you will not think\r\nany deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.\r\n\r\nThe laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary\r\nsystem have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You\r\nwill consider in your wisdom whether improvements in that system may yet be\r\nmade, and particularly whether an uniform process of execution on sentences\r\nissuing from the Federal courts be not desirable through all the States.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and sea men, has called for\r\nthe appointment of consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to\r\nregulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which\r\nare permitted them, either by express convention or by a friendly\r\nindulgence, in the places of their residence. The consular convention, too,\r\nwith His Most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of\r\nthe national authority to his consuls established here. Some legislative\r\nprovision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the militia, of a mint, of standards of weights and\r\nmeasures, of the post office and post roads are subjects which I presume\r\nyou will resume of course, and which are abundantly urged by their own\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to\r\nwhich they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions\r\nwill be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands\r\nnow pledged. Allow me, moreover, to hope that it will be a favorite policy\r\nwith you, not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt\r\nfunded, but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will\r\npermit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have\r\nmade of the Western land explains your dispositions on this subject, and I\r\nam persuaded that the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute,\r\nalong with the other means, to the actual reduction of the public debt the\r\nmore salutary will the measure be to every public interest, as well as the\r\nmore satisfactory to our constituents.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the various and weighty business of the present session I\r\nindulge the fullest persuasion that your consultation will be equally\r\nmarked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever\r\nbelongs to my duty you shall have all the cooperation which an undiminished\r\nzeal for its welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both, and our\r\nbest reward, if, by a successful administration of our respective trusts,\r\nwe can make the established Government more and more instrumental in\r\npromoting the good of our fellow citizens, and more and more the object of\r\ntheir attachment and confidence.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge Washington\r\nOctober 25, 1791\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\n\"In vain may we expect peace with the Indians on our frontiers so long as a\r\nlawless set of unprincipled wretches can violate the rights of hospitality,\r\nor infringe the most solemn treaties, without receiving the punishment they\r\nso justly merit.\"\r\n\r\nI meet you upon the present occasion with the feelings which are naturally\r\ninspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situations of our common\r\ncountry, and by a persuasion equally strong that the labors of the session\r\nwhich has just commenced will, under the guidance of a spirit no less\r\nprudent than patriotic, issue in measures conducive to the stability and\r\nincrease of national prosperity.\r\n\r\nNumerous as are the providential blessings which demand our grateful\r\nacknowledgments, the abundance with which another year has again rewarded\r\nthe industry of the husbandman is too important to escape recollection.\r\n\r\nYour own observations in your respective situations will have satisfied you\r\nof the progressive state of agriculture, manufactures, commerce, and\r\nnavigation. In tracing their causes you will have remarked with particular\r\npleasure the happy effects of that revival of confidence, public as well as\r\nprivate, to which the Constitution and laws of the United States have so\r\neminently contributed; and you will have observed with no less interest new\r\nand decisive proofs of the increasing reputation and credit of the nation.\r\nBut you nevertheless can not fail to derive satisfaction from the\r\nconfirmation of these circumstances which will be disclosed in the several\r\nofficial communications that will be made to you in the course of your\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\nThe rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States, which completed\r\nthe sum allowed to be subscribed in a single day, is among the striking and\r\npleasing evidences which present themselves, not only of confidence in the\r\nGovernment, but of resource in the community.\r\n\r\nIn the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution\r\nof the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws and\r\nresolutions of the last session.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important of these is the defense and security of the\r\nwestern frontiers. To accomplish it on the most humane principles was a\r\nprimary wish.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, at the same time the treaties have been provisionally\r\nconcluded and other proper means used to attach the wavering and to confirm\r\nin their friendship the well-disposed tribes of Indians, effectual measures\r\nhave been adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible that a\r\npacification was desired upon terms of moderation and justice.\r\n\r\nThose measures having proved unsuccessful, it became necessary to convince\r\nthe refractory of the power of the United States to punish their\r\ndepredations. Offensive operations have therefore been directed, to be\r\nconducted, however, as consistently as possible with the dictates of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nSome of these have been crowned with full success and others are yet\r\ndepending. The expeditions which have been completed were carried on under\r\nthe authority and at the expense of the United States by the militia of\r\nKentucky, whose enterprise, intrepidity, and good conduct are entitled of\r\npeculiar commendation.\r\n\r\nOvertures of peace are still continued to the deluded tribes, and\r\nconsiderable numbers of individuals belonging to them have lately renounced\r\nall further opposition, removed from their former situations, and placed\r\nthemselves under the immediate protection of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion in future may cease\r\nand that an intimate intercourse may succeed, calculated to advance the\r\nhappiness of the Indians and to attach them firmly to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn order to this it seems necessary--That they should experience the\r\nbenefits of an impartial dispensation of justice. That the mode of\r\nalienating their lands, the main source of discontent and war, should be so\r\ndefined and regulated as to obviate imposition and as far as may be\r\npracticable controversy concerning the reality and extent of the\r\nalienations which are made. That commerce with them should be promoted\r\nunder regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment toward them,\r\nand that such rational experiments should be made for imparting to them the\r\nblessings of civilization as may from time to time suit their condition.\r\nThat the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ the\r\nmeans to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their\r\nimmediate interests with the preservation of peace. And that efficacious\r\nprovision should be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those\r\nwho, by violating their rights, shall infringe the treaties and endanger\r\nthe peace of the Union. A system corresponding with the mild principles of\r\nreligion and philanthropy toward an unenlightened race of men, whose\r\nhappiness materially depends on the conduct of the United States, would be\r\nas honorable to the national character as conformable to the dictates of\r\nsound policy.\r\n\r\nThe powers specially vested in me by the act laying certain duties on\r\ndistilled spirits, which respect the subdivisions of the districts into\r\nsurveys, the appointment of officers, and the assignment of compensations,\r\nhave likewise been carried into effect. In a manner in which both materials\r\nand experience were wanting to guide the calculation it will be readily\r\nconceived that there must have been difficulty in such an adjustment of the\r\nrates of compensation as would conciliate a reasonable competency with a\r\nproper regard to the limits prescribed by the law. It is hoped that the\r\ncircumspection which has been used will be found in the result to have\r\nsecured the last of the two objects; but it is probable that with a view\r\nto the first in some instances a revision of the provision will be found\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nThe impressions with which this law has been received by the community have\r\nbeen upon the whole such as were to be expected among enlightened and\r\nwell-disposed citizens from the propriety and necessity of the measure. The\r\nnovelty, however, of the tax in a considerable part of the United States\r\nand a misconception of some of its provisions have given occasion in\r\nparticular places to some degree of discontent; but it is satisfactory to\r\nknow that this disposition yields to proper explanations and more just\r\napprehensions of the true nature of the law, and I entertain a full\r\nconfidence that it will in all give way to motives which arise out of a\r\njust sense of duty and a virtuous regard to the public welfare.\r\n\r\nIf there are any circumstances in the law which consistently with its main\r\ndesign may be so varied as to remove any well-intentioned objections that\r\nmay happen to exist, it will consist with a wise moderation to make the\r\nproper variations. It is desirable on all occasions to unite with a steady\r\nand firm adherence to constitutional and necessary acts of Government the\r\nfullest evidence of a disposition as far as may be practicable to consult\r\nthe wishes of every part of the community and to lay the foundations of the\r\npublic administration in the affections of the people.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the authority contained in the several acts on that subject, a\r\ndistrict of 10 miles square for the permanent seat of the Government of the\r\nUnited States has been fixed and announced by proclamation, which district\r\nwill comprehend lands on both sides of the river Potomac and the towns of\r\nAlexandria and Georgetown. A city has also been laid out agreeably to a\r\nplan which will be placed before Congress, and as there is a prospect,\r\nfavored by the rate of sales which have already taken place, of ample funds\r\nfor carrying on the necessary public buildings, there is every expectation\r\nof their due progress.\r\n\r\nThe completion of the census of the inhabitants, for which provision was\r\nmade by law, has been duly notified (excepting one instance in which the\r\nreturn has been informal, and another in which it has been omitted or\r\nmiscarried), and the returns of the officers who were charged with this\r\nduty, which will be laid before you, will give you the pleasing assurance\r\nthat the present population of the United States borders on 4,000,000\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIt is proper also to inform you that a further loan of 2,500,000 florins\r\nhas been completed in Holland, the terms of which are similar to those of\r\nthe one last announced, except as to a small reduction of charges. Another,\r\non like terms, for 6,000,000 florins, had been set on foot under\r\ncircumstances that assured an immediate completion.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate:\r\n\r\nTwo treaties which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees and\r\nSix Nations of Indians will be laid before you for your consideration and\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust you must\r\nanticipate with pleasure that many of the difficulties necessarily incident\r\nto the first arrangements of a new government for an extensive country have\r\nbeen happily surmounted by the zealous and judicious exertions of your\r\npredecessors in cooperation with the other branch of the Legislature. The\r\nimportant objects which remain to be accomplished will, I am persuaded, be\r\nconducted upon principles equally comprehensive and equally well calculated\r\nof the advancement of the general weal.\r\n\r\nThe time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the\r\nact making provision for the debt of the United States having expired,\r\nstatements from the proper department will as soon as possible apprise you\r\nof the exact result. Enough, however, is known already to afford an\r\nassurance that the views of that act have been substantially fulfilled. The\r\nsubscription in the domestic debt of the United States has embraced by far\r\nthe greatest proportion of that debt, affording at the same time proof of\r\nthe general satisfaction of the public creditors with the system which has\r\nbeen proposed to their acceptance and of the spirit of accommodation to the\r\nconvenience of the Government with which they are actuated. The\r\nsubscriptions in the debts of the respective States as far as the\r\nprovisions of the law have permitted may be said to be yet more general.\r\nThe part of the debt of the United States which remains unsubscribed will\r\nnaturally engage your further deliberations.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you that the\r\nrevenues which have been established promise to be adequate to their\r\nobjects, and may be permitted, if no unforeseen exigency occurs, to\r\nsupersede for the present the necessity of any new burthens upon our\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nAn object which will claim your early attention is a provision for the\r\ncurrent service of the ensuing year, together with such ascertained demands\r\nupon the Treasury as require to be immediately discharged, and such\r\ncasualties as may have arisen in the execution of the public business, for\r\nwhich no specific appropriation may have yet been made; of all which a\r\nproper estimate will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI shall content myself with a general reference to former communications\r\nfor several objects upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto\r\npostponed any definitive resolution. Their importance will recall them to\r\nyour attention, and I trust that the progress already made in the most\r\narduous arrangements of the Government will afford you leisure to resume\r\nthem to advantage.\r\n\r\nThese are, however, some of them of which I can not forbear a more\r\nparticular mention. These are the militia, the post office and post roads,\r\nthe mint, weights and measures, a provision for the sale of the vacant\r\nlands of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first is certainly an object of primary importance whether viewed in\r\nreference to the national security to the satisfaction of the community or\r\nto the preservation of order. In connection with this the establishment of\r\ncompetent magazines and arsenals and the fortification of such places as\r\nare peculiarly important and vulnerable naturally present themselves to\r\nconsideration. The safety of the United States under divine protection\r\nought to rest on the basis of systematic and solid arrangements, exposed as\r\nlittle as possible to the hazards of fortuitous circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the post office and post roads on a plan sufficiently\r\nliberal and comprehensive, as they respect the expedition, safety, and\r\nfacility of communication, is increased by their instrumentality in\r\ndiffusing a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the Government, which,\r\nwhile it contributes to the security of the people, serves also to guard\r\nthem against the effects of misrepresentation and misconception. The\r\nestablishment of additional cross posts, especially to some of the\r\nimportant points in the Western and Northern parts of the Union, can not\r\nfail to be of material utility.\r\n\r\nThe disorders in the existing currency, and especially the scarcity of\r\nsmall change, a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes,\r\nstrongly recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution\r\nalready entered into concerning the establishment of a mint. Measures have\r\nbeen taken pursuant to that resolution for procuring some of the most\r\nnecessary artists, together with the requisite apparatus.\r\n\r\nAn uniformity in the weights and measures of the country is among the\r\nimportant objects submitted to you by the Constitution, and if it can be\r\nderived from a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less\r\nhonorable to the public councils than conducive to the public convenience.\r\n\r\nA provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is\r\nparticularly urged, among other reasons, by the important considerations\r\nthat they are pledged as a fund for reimbursing the public debt; that if\r\ntimely and judiciously applied they may save the necessity of burthening\r\nour citizens with new taxes for the extinguishment of the principal; and\r\nthat being free to discharge the principal but in a limited proportion, no\r\nopportunity ought to be lost for availing the public of its right.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge Washington\r\nNovember 6, 1792\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIt is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the\r\npresent occasion that, in felicitating you on a continuance of the national\r\nprosperity generally, I am not able to add to it information that the\r\nIndian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our\r\nNorthwestern frontier have terminated.\r\n\r\nYou will, I am persuaded, learn with no less concern than I communicate it\r\nthat reiterated endeavors toward effecting a pacification have hitherto\r\nissued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the\r\npart of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to\r\nprocure tranquillity to the frontier, to stop the further effusion of\r\nblood, to arrest the progress of expense, to forward the prevalent wish of\r\nthe nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels\r\nto accomplish these desirable purposes; in making which efforts I consulted\r\nless my own anticipations of the event, or the scruples which some\r\nconsiderations were calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the object\r\nattainable, or if not attainable, to ascertain unequivocally that such is\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nA detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences,\r\nwhich will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of\r\nsuccess thus far, will, I trust, evince that means as proper and as\r\nefficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of\r\nsome of them, indeed, is still depending, but a favorable one, though not\r\nto be despaired of, is not promised by anything that has yet happened.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens\r\nhave fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction\r\ncommonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance\r\ninsufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace. It will, I\r\npresume, be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an\r\nexercise of liberality toward the families of the deceased.\r\n\r\nIt must add to your concern to be informed that, besides the continuation\r\nof hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threatening\r\nsymptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.\r\n\r\nA part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamaugas, inhabiting five\r\nvillages on the Tennessee River, have long been in the practice of\r\ncommitting depredations on the neighboring settlements.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the treaty of Holston, made with the Cherokee Nation in\r\nJuly, 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations; but the\r\nevent has not answered this hope. The Chickamaugas, aided by some banditti\r\nof another tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton and\r\nunprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that\r\nquarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be\r\nlaid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been strictly\r\nenjoined and observed.\r\n\r\nIt is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on\r\nthe part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a\r\npretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made\r\n(pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the\r\nalternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of\r\npacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised\r\nhave been recruited, though the number is still incomplete, and pains have\r\nbeen taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind\r\nof service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated\r\nby the measures which were pursuing toward a pacific termination of the\r\nwar) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement\r\nfrom the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised, and\r\nsome other points which have been suggested, will afford more precise\r\ninformation as a guide to the legislative consultations, and among other\r\nthings will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to\r\nthe recruiting service may not be advisable.\r\n\r\nIn looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be\r\nfound inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that\r\nthe product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the\r\nnecessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the\r\nensuing year. This, however, will be better ascertained in the course of\r\nthe session, and it is proper to add that the information alluded to\r\nproceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of\r\nhostility.\r\n\r\nI can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending\r\nto your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving\r\nenergy to the laws throughout our interior frontier and for restraining the\r\ncommission of outrages upon the Indians, without which all pacific plans\r\nmust prove nugatory. To enable, by competent rewards, the employment of\r\nqualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also\r\ncontribute to the preservation of peace and good neighborhood. If in\r\naddition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for\r\npromoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade\r\nwith them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations\r\ncalculated to protect them from imposition and extortion, its influence in\r\ncementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.\r\n\r\nThe prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated. This would be still\r\nmore the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue\r\nto embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the\r\nUnited States. These impediments have lessened and are lessening in local\r\nextent, and, as applied to the community at large, the contentment with the\r\nlaw appears to be progressive.\r\n\r\nBut symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in\r\ncertain quarters, I judged a special interposition on my part proper and\r\nadvisable, and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning\r\nagainst all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object\r\nor tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question, and announcing\r\nthat all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for\r\nbringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.\r\n\r\nMeasures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders, and\r\nCongress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits\r\nwhich may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just\r\nauthority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon\r\nthe full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon\r\nthe zealous support of all good citizens.\r\n\r\nI can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the\r\nsubject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court, which will be laid before you, points out some\r\nof the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution\r\nof the laws considerations arise out of the structure of the system which\r\nin some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject,\r\nprovisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the\r\ncourts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses\r\nagainst the Constitution and laws of the Union and of the punishment for\r\nsuch offenses will, it is presumed, be found worthy of particular\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nObservations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It\r\nwould be wise, however, by timely provisions to guard against those acts of\r\nour own citizens which might tend to disturb it, and to put ourselves in a\r\ncondition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may\r\nsometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to\r\nyour consideration the means of preventing those aggressions by our\r\ncitizens on the territory of other nations, and other infractions of the\r\nlaw of nations, which, furnishing just subject of complaint, might endanger\r\nour peace with them; and, in general, the maintenance of a friendly\r\nintercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the\r\nexpiration of the law for that purpose, which takes place, if not renewed,\r\nat the close of the present session.\r\n\r\nIn execution of the authority given by the Legislature measures have been\r\ntaken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of\r\nour mint. Others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the\r\nrequisite buildings, and these are now putting into proper condition for\r\nthe purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in\r\nthe coinage of half dimes, the want of small coins in circulation calling\r\nthe first attention to them.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of\r\nour national coinage, as being essential to their due operation and to\r\norder in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be resumed and completed.\r\n\r\nIt is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the\r\npost office operate, in experiment, against the transmission of news papers\r\nto distant parts of the country. Should this, upon due inquiry, be found to\r\nbe the fact, a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the\r\ncirculation of political intelligence and information will, I doubt not,\r\nlead to the application of a remedy.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of a constitution for the State of Kentucky has been notified\r\nto me. The Legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises\r\nfrom an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to\r\nwhich it relates and conducive to the general order.\r\n\r\nIt is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the\r\nsubject, and in further execution of the acts severally making provision\r\nfor the public debt and for the reduction thereof, three new loans have\r\nbeen effected, each for 3,000,000 florins--one at Antwerp, at the annual\r\ninterest of 4.5%, with an allowance of 4% in lieu of all charges, in the\r\nother 2 at Amsterdam, at the annual interest of 4%, with an allowance of\r\n5.5% in one case and of 5% in the other in lieu of all charges. The rates\r\nof these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are\r\nconfirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied,\r\nthe payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers, according to the\r\nprovision made during the last session, has been embraced.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now\r\nsufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effectual\r\narrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt,\r\naccording to the right which has been reserved to the Government. No\r\nmeasure can be more desirable, whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic\r\nimportance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation.\r\n\r\nProvision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has\r\nbeen made of the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the eleventh\r\nsection of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public\r\nstipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAppropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such\r\nextraordinaries as may require provision will demand, and I doubt not will\r\nengage, your early attention.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects,\r\nnot particularized in my present, as have been suggested in my former\r\ncommunications to you.\r\n\r\nVarious temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these,\r\nthat which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will\r\nmerit particular notice.\r\n\r\nThe results of your common deliberations hitherto will, I trust, be\r\nproductive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents, such as, by\r\nconciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage, will tend to strengthen\r\nand confirm their attachment to that Constitution of Government upon which,\r\nunder Divine Providence, materially depend their union, their safety, and\r\ntheir happiness.\r\n\r\nStill further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing\r\nwhich can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of\r\nharmony, combined with a due regard to stability, in the public councils.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge Washington\r\nDecember 3, 1793\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the term for which I have been again called into\r\noffice no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to my fellow citizens at\r\nlarge the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony\r\nof public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for\r\nall those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been\r\nhonored by my country, on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish\r\nfor that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have\r\ntorn me. But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated\r\naccording to its real motives, and that the people, and the authorities\r\nderived from them, would support exertions having nothing personal for\r\ntheir object, I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the\r\nExecutive power; and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of\r\nnations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United\r\nStates have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that\r\nour intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for\r\npeace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by\r\nbelligerent nations. It seemed, therefore, to be my duty to admonish our\r\ncitizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to\r\nany of the parties, and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal\r\nstate of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities\r\nbelonging to our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which\r\nwill be laid before you was issued.\r\n\r\nIn this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I resolved to adopt\r\ngeneral rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the\r\nprivileges of the United States. These were reduced into a system, which\r\nwill be communicated to you. Although I have not thought of myself at\r\nliberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of\r\ncommerce with France to be brought into our ports, I have not refused to\r\ncause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our\r\nterritory, or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within\r\nthe limits of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve, or enforce this\r\nplan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the\r\nlegal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States to many\r\ncases which, though dependent on principles already recognized, demand some\r\nfurther provisions.\r\n\r\nWhere individuals shall, within the United States, array themselves in\r\nhostility against any of the powers at war, or enter upon military\r\nexpeditions or enterprises within the jurisdiction of the United States, or\r\nusurp and exercise judicial authority within the United States, or where\r\nthe penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been\r\nindistinctly marked, or are inadequate--these offenses can not receive too\r\nearly and close an attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies.\r\n\r\nWhatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well administered by the\r\njudiciary, who possess a long-established course of investigation,\r\neffectual process, and officers in the habit of executing it.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, under particular\r\ncircumstances, their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace,\r\nand even of a citizen of the United States, although seized under a false\r\ncolor of being hostile property, and have denied their power to liberate\r\ncertain captures within the protection of our territory, it would seem\r\nproper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the Executive\r\nis to be the resort in either of the two last-mentioned cases, it is hoped\r\nthat he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts\r\nwhen for his own information he shall request it.\r\n\r\nI can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our\r\nduties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the\r\nnecessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of\r\nexacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United\r\nStates ought not to indulge a persuasion that, contrary to the order of\r\nhuman events, they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to\r\narms with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank\r\ndue to the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not\r\nabsolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid\r\ninsult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of\r\nthe most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known\r\nthat we are at all times ready for war. The documents which will be\r\npresented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores\r\nnow in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even to these\r\nsupplies can not with prudence be neglected, as it would leave nothing to\r\nthe uncertainty of procuring warlike apparatus in the moment of public\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nNor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the censure or\r\njealousy of the warmest friends of republican government. They are\r\nincapable of abuse in the hands of the militia, who ought to possess a\r\npride in being the depository of the force of the Republic, and may be\r\ntrained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the\r\nUnited States. But it is an inquiry which can not be too solemnly pursued,\r\nwhether the act \"more effectually to provide for the national defense by\r\nestablishing an uniform militia throughout the United States\" has organized\r\nthem so as to produce their full effect; whether your own experience in the\r\nseveral States has not detected some imperfections in the scheme, and\r\nwhether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to\r\nafford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art\r\nwhich can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone.\r\n\r\nThe connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely\r\ninteresting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the\r\nknowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmed that\r\nevery reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension\r\nwith the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the\r\ncommissioners evince a moderation and equity proceeding from a sincere love\r\nof peace, and a liberality having no restriction but the essential\r\ninterests and dignity of the United States. The attempt, however, of an\r\namicable negotiation having been frustrated, the troops have marched to act\r\noffensively. Although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of\r\nmilitary preparation, it is doubtful how far the advance of the season,\r\nbefore good faith justified active movements, may retard them during the\r\nremainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to\r\nthis important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the\r\nnumber of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia,\r\nor additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits.\r\n\r\nAn anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with the\r\nCreeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with\r\nclothing, and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess\r\nof Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter, prosecutions have\r\nbeen instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers which\r\nwill be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in\r\nregard to both those tribes, and it is with Congress to pronounce what\r\nshall be done.\r\n\r\nAfter they shall have provided for the present emergency, it will merit\r\ntheir most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages permanent\r\nby creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice on\r\nthe violators of peace, the establishment of commerce with the Indian\r\nnations in behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their\r\nattachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion,\r\nwith constant and plentiful supplies, with a ready market for the\r\ncommodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they give in payment\r\nand receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless\r\nthey be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United\r\nStates to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the\r\nopinion of Congress, they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by\r\nany means yet in the hands of the Executive.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe commissioners charged with the settlement of accounts between the\r\nUnited States and individual States concluded their important function\r\nwithin the time limited by law, and the balances struck in their report,\r\nwhich will be laid before Congress, have been placed on the books of the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of June last an installment of 1,000,000 florins became\r\npayable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted by\r\na prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an\r\ninterest of 5% for the term of ten years, and the expenses of this\r\noperation were a commission of 3%.\r\n\r\nThe first installment of the loan of $2,000,000 from the Bank of the United\r\nStates has been paid, as was directed by law. For the second it is\r\nnecessary that provision be made.\r\n\r\nNo pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemption and\r\ndischarge of the public debt. On none can delay be more injurious or an\r\neconomy of time more valuable.\r\n\r\nThe productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal\r\nthe anticipations which were formed of it, but it is not expected to prove\r\ncommensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some auxiliary\r\nprovisions will therefore, it is presumed, be requisite, and it is hoped\r\nthat these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of\r\nour citizens, who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of\r\nencountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a\r\nfuture accumulation of burthens.\r\n\r\nBut here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the\r\ntransportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the\r\nGovernment of the United States as the affections of the people, guided by\r\nan enlightened policy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more\r\nthan a faithful representation of public proceedings, diffused without\r\nrestraint throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the\r\nensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made\r\nduring the recess will be presented to Congress.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide range to your\r\ndeliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common\r\ncountry. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task.\r\nWithout an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the Government may be\r\nhazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its\r\ndignity may be lost. But as the legislative proceedings of the United\r\nStates will never, I trust, be reproached for the want of temper or of\r\ncandor, so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my\r\nstrenuous and warmest cooperation.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge Washington\r\nNovember 19, 1794\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nWhen we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven by which the\r\nAmerican people became a nation; when we survey the general prosperity of\r\nour country, and look forward to the riches, power, and happiness to which\r\nit seems destined, with the deepest regret do I announce to you that during\r\nyour recess some of the citizens of the United States have been found\r\ncapable of insurrection. It is due, however, to the character of our\r\nGovernment and to its stability, which can not be shaken by the enemies of\r\norder, freely to unfold the course of this event.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of the year 1790 it was expedient to exercise the\r\nlegislative power granted by the Constitution of the United States \"to lay\r\nand collect excises\". In a majority of the States scarcely an objection was\r\nheard to this mode of taxation. In some, indeed, alarms were at first\r\nconceived, until they were banished by reason and patriotism. In the four\r\nwestern counties of Pennsylvania a prejudice, fostered and imbittered by\r\nthe artifice of men who labored for an ascendency over the will of others\r\nby the guidance of their passions, produced symptoms of riot and violence.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Congress did not hesitate to examine the complaints\r\nwhich were presented, and to relieve them as far as justice dictated or\r\ngeneral convenience would permit. But the impression which this moderation\r\nmade on the discontented did not correspond with what it deserved. The arts\r\nof delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designing\r\nindividuals. The very forbearance to press prosecutions was misinterpreted\r\ninto a fear of urging the execution of the laws, and associations of men\r\nbegan to denounce threats against the officers employed. From a belief that\r\nby a more formal concert their operation might be defeated, certain\r\nself-created societies assumed the tone of condemnation. Hence, while the\r\ngreater part of Pennsylvania itself were conforming themselves to the acts\r\nof excise, a few counties were resolved to frustrate them. It is now\r\nperceived that every expectation from the tenderness which had been\r\nhitherto pursued was unavailing, and that further delay could only create\r\nan opinion of impotency or irresolution in the Government. Legal process\r\nwas therefore delivered to the marshal against the rioters and delinquent\r\ndistillers.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was he understood to be engaged in this duty than the vengeance\r\nof armed men was aimed at his person and the person and property of the\r\ninspector of the revenue. They fired upon the marshal, arrested him, and\r\ndetained him for some time as a prisoner. He was obliged, by the jeopardy\r\nof his life, to renounce the service of other process on the west side of\r\nthe Allegheny Mountain, and a deputation was afterwards sent to him to\r\ndemand a surrender of that which he had served. A numerous body repeatedly\r\nattacked the house of the inspector, seized his papers of office, and\r\nfinally destroyed by fire his buildings and whatsoever they contained. Both\r\nof these officers, from a just regard to their safety, fled to the seat of\r\nGovernment, it being avowed that the motives to such outrages were to\r\ncompel the resignation of the inspector, to withstand by force of arms the\r\nauthority of the United States, and thereby to extort a repeal of the laws\r\nof excise and an alteration in the conduct of Government.\r\n\r\nUpon testimony of these facts an associate justice of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States notified to me that \"in the counties of Washington and\r\nAllegheny, in Pennsylvania, laws of the United States were opposed, and the\r\nexecution thereof obstructed, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed\r\nby the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in\r\nthe marshal of that district\".\r\n\r\nOn this call, momentous in the extreme, I sought and weighted what might\r\nbest subdue the crisis. On the one hand the judiciary was pronounced to be\r\nstripped of its capacity to enforce the laws; crimes which reached the very\r\nexistence of social order were perpetrated without control; the friends of\r\nGovernment were insulted, abused, and overawed into silence or an apparent\r\nacquiescence; and to yield to the treasonable fury of so small a portion of\r\nthe United States would be to violate the fundamental principle of our\r\nConstitution, which enjoins that the will of the majority shall prevail. On\r\nthe other, to array citizen against citizen, to publish the dishonor of\r\nsuch excesses, to encounter the expense and other embarrassments of so\r\ndistant an expedition, were steps too delicate, too closely interwoven with\r\nmany affecting considerations, to be lightly adopted.\r\n\r\nI postponed, therefore, the summoning of the militia immediately into the\r\nfield, but I required them to be held in readiness, that if my anxious\r\nendeavors to reclaim the deluded and to convince the malignant of their\r\ndanger should be fruitless, military force might be prepared to act before\r\nthe season should be too far advanced.\r\n\r\nMy proclamation of the 7th of August last was accordingly issued, and\r\naccompanied by the appointment of commissioners, who were charged to\r\nrepair to the scene of insurrection. They were authorized to confer\r\nwith any bodies of men or individuals. They were instructed to be\r\ncandid and explicit in stating the sensations which had been excited in the\r\nExecutive, and his earnest wish to avoid a resort to coercion; to\r\nrepresent, however, that, without submission, coercion must be the resort;\r\nbut to invite them, at the same time, to return to the demeanor of faithful\r\ncitizens, by such accommodations as lay within the sphere of Executive\r\npower. Pardon, too, was tendered to them by the Government of the United\r\nStates and that of Pennsylvania, upon no other condition than a\r\nsatisfactory assurance of obedience to the laws.\r\n\r\nAlthough the report of the commissioners marks their firmness and\r\nabilities, and must unite all virtuous men, by shewing that the means of\r\nconciliation have been exhausted, all of those who had committed or abetted\r\nthe tumults did not subscribe the mild form which was proposed as the\r\natonement, and the indications of a peaceable temper were neither\r\nsufficiently general nor conclusive to recommend or warrant the further\r\nsuspension of the march of the militia.\r\n\r\nThus the painful alternative could not be discarded. I ordered the militia\r\nto march, after once more admonishing the insurgents in my proclamation of\r\nthe 25th of September last.\r\n\r\nIt was a task too difficult to ascertain with precision the lowest degree\r\nof force competent to the quelling of the insurrection. From a respect,\r\nindeed, to economy and the ease of my fellow citizens belonging to the\r\nmilitia, it would have gratified me to accomplish such an estimate. My very\r\nreluctance to ascribe too much importance to the opposition, had its extent\r\nbeen accurately seen, would have been a decided inducement to the smallest\r\nefficient numbers. In this uncertainty, therefore, I put into motion fifteen\r\nthousand men, as being an army which, according to all human calculation,\r\nwould be prompt and adequate in every view, and might, perhaps, by rendering\r\nresistance desperate, prevent the effusion of blood. Quotas had been\r\nassigned to the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia,\r\nthe governor of Pennsylvania having declared on this occasion an opinion\r\nwhich justified a requisition to the other States.\r\n\r\nAs commander in chief of the militia when called into the actual service of\r\nthe United States, I have visited the places of general rendezvous to\r\nobtain more exact information and to direct a plan for ulterior movements.\r\nHad there been room for a persuasion that the laws were secure from\r\nobstruction; that the civil magistrate was able to bring to justice such of\r\nthe most culpable as have not embraced the proffered terms of amnesty, and\r\nmay be deemed fit objects of example; that the friends to peace and good\r\ngovernment were not in need of that aid and countenance which they ought\r\nalways to receive, and, I trust, ever will receive, against the vicious and\r\nturbulent, I should have caught with avidity the opportunity of restoring\r\nthe militia to their families and homes. But succeeding intelligence has\r\ntended to manifest the necessity of what has been done, it being now\r\nconfessed by those who were not inclined to exaggerate the ill conduct of\r\nthe insurgents that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a\r\nparticular law, but that a spirit inimical to all order has actuated many\r\nof the offenders. If the state of things had afforded reason for the\r\ncontinuance of my presence with the army, it would not have been\r\nwithholden. But every appearance assuring such an issue as will redound to\r\nthe reputation and strength of the United States, I have judged it most\r\nproper to resume my duties at the seat of Government, leaving the chief\r\ncommand with the governor of Virginia.\r\n\r\nStill, however, as it is probable that in a commotion like the present,\r\nwhatsoever may be the pretense, the purposes of mischief and revenge may\r\nnot be laid aside, the stationing of a small force for a certain period in\r\nthe four western counties of Pennsylvania will be indispensable, whether we\r\ncontemplate the situation of those who are connected with the execution of\r\nthe laws or of others who may have exposed themselves by an honorable\r\nattachment to them. Thirty days from the commencement of this session being\r\nthe legal limitation of the employment of the militia, Congress can not be\r\ntoo early occupied with this subject.\r\n\r\nAmong the discussions which may arise from this aspect of our affairs, and\r\nfrom the documents which will be submitted to Congress, it will not escape\r\ntheir observation that not only the inspector of the revenue, but other\r\nofficers of the United States in Pennsylvania have, from their fidelity in\r\nthe discharge of their functions, sustained material injuries to their\r\nproperty. The obligation and policy of indemnifying them are strong and\r\nobvious. It may also merit attention whether policy will not enlarge this\r\nprovision to the retribution of other citizens who, though not under the\r\nties of office, may have suffered damage by their generous exertions for\r\nupholding the Constitution and the laws. The amount, even if all the\r\ninjured were included, would not be great, and on future emergencies the\r\nGovernment would be amply repaid by the influence of an example that he who\r\nincurs a loss in its defense shall find a recompense in its liberality.\r\n\r\nWhile there is cause to lament that occurrences of this nature should have\r\ndisgraced the name or interrupted the tranquillity of any part of our\r\ncommunity, or should have diverted to a new application any portion of the\r\npublic resources, there are not wanting real and substantial consolations\r\nfor the misfortune. It has demonstrated that our prosperity rests on solid\r\nfoundations, by furnishing an additional proof that my fellow citizens\r\nunderstand the true principles of government and liberty; that they feel\r\ntheir inseparable union; that notwithstanding all the devices which have\r\nbeen used to sway them from their interest and duty, they are not as ready\r\nto maintain the authority of the laws against licentious invasions as they\r\nwere to defend their rights against usurpation. It has been a spectacle\r\ndisplaying to the highest advantage of republican government to behold the\r\nmost and the least wealthy of our citizens standing in the same ranks as\r\nprivate soldiers, preeminently distinguished by being the army of the\r\nConstitution--undeterred by a march of 300 miles over rugged mountains, by\r\napproach of an inclement season, or by any other discouragement. Nor ought\r\nI to omit to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic cooperation which I\r\nhave experienced from the chief magistrates of the States to which my\r\nrequisitions have been addressed.\r\n\r\nTo every description of citizens, let praise be given, but let them\r\npersevere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious depository of\r\nAmerican happiness, the Constitution of the United States. Let them cherish\r\nit, too, for the sake of those who, from every clime, are daily seeking a\r\ndwelling in our land. And when in the calm moments of reflection they shall\r\nhave retraced the origin and progress of the insurrection, let them\r\ndetermine whether it has not been fomented by combinations of men who,\r\ncareless of consequences and disregarding the unerring truth that those who\r\nrouse can not always appease a civil convulsion, have disseminated, from an\r\nignorance or perversion of facts, suspicions, jealousies, and accusations\r\nof the whole Government.\r\n\r\nHaving thus fulfilled the engagement which I took when I entered into\r\noffice, \"to the best of my ability to preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States\", on you, gentlemen, and the people by\r\nwhom you are deputed, I rely for support.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement to which the possibility of a similar contingency will\r\nnaturally draw your attention it ought not to be forgotten that the militia\r\nlaws have exhibited such striking defects as could not have been supplied\r\nby the zeal of our citizens. Besides the extraordinary expense and waste,\r\nwhich are not the least of the defects, every appeal to those laws is\r\nattended with a doubt on its success.\r\n\r\nThe devising and establishing of a well regulated militia would be a\r\ngenuine source of legislative honor and a perfect title to public\r\ngratitude. I therefore entertain a hope that the present session will not\r\npass without carrying to its full energy the power of organizing, arming,\r\nand disciplining the militia, and thus providing, in the language of the\r\nConstitution, for calling them forth to execute the laws of the Union,\r\nsuppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\r\n\r\nAs auxiliary to the state of our defense, to which Congress can never too\r\nfrequently recur, they will not omit to inquire whether the fortifications\r\nwhich have been already licensed by law be commensurate with our\r\nexigencies.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence from the army under the command of General Wayne is a\r\nhappy presage to our military operations against the hostile Indians north\r\nof the Ohio. From the advices which have been forwarded, the advance which\r\nhe has made must have damped the ardor of the savages and weakened their\r\nobstinacy in waging war against the United States. And yet, even at this\r\nlate hour, when our power to punish them can not be questioned, we shall\r\nnot be unwilling to cement a lasting peace upon terms of candor, equity,\r\nand good neighborhood.\r\n\r\nToward none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendship been spared.\r\nThe Creeks in particular are covered from encroachment by the imposition of\r\nthe General Government and that of Georgia. From a desire also to remove\r\nthe discontents of the Six Nations, a settlement mediated at Presque Isle,\r\non Lake Erie, has been suspended, and an agent is now endeavoring to\r\nrectify any misconception into which they may have fallen. But I can not\r\nrefrain from again pressing upon your deliberations the plan which I\r\nrecommended at the last session for the improvement of harmony with all the\r\nIndians within our limits by the fixing and conducting of trading houses\r\nupon the principles then expressed.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe time which has elapsed since the commencement of our fiscal measures\r\nhas developed our pecuniary resources so as to open the way for a definite\r\nplan for the redemption of the public debt. It is believed that the result\r\nis such as to encourage Congress to consummate this work without delay.\r\nNothing can more promote the permanent welfare of the nation and nothing\r\nwould be more grateful to our constituents. Indeed, whatsoever is\r\nunfinished of our system of public credit can not be benefited by\r\nprocrastination; and as far as may be practicable we ought to place that\r\ncredit on grounds which can not be disturbed, and to prevent that\r\nprogressive accumulation of debt which must ultimately endanger all\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the necessary appropriations, including the expenditures\r\ninto which we have been driven by the insurrection, will be submitted to\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe Mint of the United States has entered upon the coinage of the precious\r\nmetals, and considerable sums of defective coins and bullion have been\r\nlodged with the Director by individuals. There is a pleasing prospect that\r\nthe institution will at no remote day realize the expectation which was\r\noriginally formed of its utility.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent communications certain circumstances of our intercourse with\r\nforeign nations will be transmitted to Congress. However, it may not be\r\nunseasonable to announce that my policy in our foreign transactions has\r\nbeen to cultivate peace with all the world; to observe the treaties with\r\npure and absolute faith; to check every deviation from the line of\r\nimpartiality; to explain what may have been misapprehended and correct what\r\nmay have been injurious to any nation, and having thus acquired the right,\r\nto lose no time in acquiring the ability to insist upon justice being done\r\nto ourselves.\r\n\r\nLet us unite, therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of Nations to\r\nspread his holy protection over these United States; to turn the\r\nmachinations of the wicked to the confirming of our Constitution; to enable\r\nus at all times to root out internal sedition and put invasion to flight;\r\nto perpetuate to our country that prosperity which his goodness has already\r\nconferred, and to verify the anticipations of this Government being a\r\nsafeguard of human rights.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge Washington\r\nDecember 8, 1795\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI trust I do not deceive myself when I indulge the persuasion that I have\r\nnever met you at any period when more than at the present the situation of\r\nour public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual congratulation, and\r\nfor inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all\r\nGood for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the long, expensive, and distressing war in which we\r\nhave been engaged with certain Indians northwest of the Ohio is placed in\r\nthe option of the United States by a treaty which the commander of our army\r\nhas concluded provisionally with the hostile tribes in that region.\r\n\r\nIn the adjustment of the terms the satisfaction of the Indians was deemed\r\nworthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of the United States as\r\nthe necessary basis of durable tranquillity. The object, it is believed,\r\nhas been fully attained. The articles agreed upon will immediately be laid\r\nbefore the Senate for their consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the Southern tribes had\r\nannoyed our frontiers, have lately confirmed their preexisting treaties\r\nwith us, and were giving evidence of a sincere disposition to carry them\r\ninto effect by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had taken.\r\nBut we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has been once\r\nmore clouded by wanton murders, which some citizens of Georgia are\r\nrepresented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks,\r\nwhich have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger, which\r\nwill be productive of further expense, and may occasion more effusion of\r\nblood. Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences\r\nof such outrages, and with the hope of their succeeding at least to avert\r\ngeneral hostility.\r\n\r\nA letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our\r\ntreaty made with his father, the late Emperor, and consequently the\r\ncontinuance of peace with that power. With peculiar satisfaction I add that\r\ninformation has been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers\r\nimporting that the terms of the treaty with the Dey and Regency of that\r\ncountry had been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the expectation\r\nof a speedy peace and the restoration of our unfortunate fellow citizens\r\nfrom a grievous captivity.\r\n\r\nThe latest advices from our envoy at the Court of Madrid give, moreover,\r\nthe pleasing information that he had assurances of a speedy and\r\nsatisfactory conclusion of his negotiation. While the event depending upon\r\nunadjusted particulars can not be regarded as ascertained, it is agreeable\r\nto cherish the expectation of an issue which, securing amicably very\r\nessential interests of the United States, will at the same time lay the\r\nfoundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship we have\r\nuniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate.\r\n\r\nThough not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives,\r\nyou, gentlemen, are all apprised that a treaty of amity, commerce, and\r\nnavigation has been negotiated with Great Britain, and that the Senate have\r\nadvised and consented to its ratification upon a condition which excepts\r\npart of one article. Agreeably thereto, and to the best judgment I was able\r\nto form of the public interest after full and mature deliberation, I have\r\nadded my sanction. The result on the part of His Britannic Majesty is\r\nunknown. When received, the subject will without delay be placed before\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThis interesting summary of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers\r\nbetween whom and the United States controversies have subsisted, and with\r\nregard also to those of our Indian neighbors with whom we have been in a\r\nstate of enmity or misunderstanding, opens a wide field for consoling and\r\ngratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every side the\r\nextinguishment of all the causes of external discord which have heretofore\r\nmenaced our tranquillity, on terms compatible with our national rights and\r\nhonor, shall be the happy result, how firm and how precious a foundation\r\nwill have been laid for accelerating, maturing, and establishing the\r\nprosperity of our country.\r\n\r\nContemplating the internal situation as well as the external relations of\r\nthe United States, we discover equal cause for contentment and\r\nsatisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe, with their American\r\ndependencies, have been involved in a contest unusually bloody, exhausting,\r\nand calamitous, in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by\r\ndomestic convulsion and insurrection; in which many of the arts most useful\r\nto society have been exposed to discouragement and decay; in which scarcity\r\nof subsistence has imbittered other sufferings; while even the\r\nanticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and repose are alloyed\r\nby the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens, which press upon all the\r\ndepartments of industry and threaten to clog the future springs of\r\ngovernment, our favored country, happy in a striking contrast, has enjoyed\r\ntranquillity--a tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintained at\r\nthe expense of no duty. Faithful to ourselves, we have violated no\r\nobligation to others.\r\n\r\nOur agriculture, commerce, and manufactures prosper beyond former example,\r\nthe molestations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which, however,\r\nvery pointed remonstrances have been made) being overbalanced by the\r\naggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position. Our population\r\nadvances with a celerity which, exceeding the most sanguine calculations,\r\nproportionally augments our strength and resources, and guarantees our\r\nfuture security.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the Union displays indications of rapid and various\r\nimprovement; and with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived, with\r\nresources fully adequate to our present exigencies, with governments\r\nfounded on the genuine principles of rational liberty, and with mild and\r\nwholesome laws, is it too much to say that our country exhibits a spectacle\r\nof national happiness never surpassed, if ever before equaled?\r\n\r\nPlaced in a situation every way so auspicious, motives of commanding force\r\nimpel us, with sincere acknowledgment to Heaven and pure love to our\r\ncountry, to unite our efforts to preserve, prolong, and improve our immense\r\nadvantages. To cooperate with you in this desirable work is a fervent and\r\nfavorite wish of my heart.\r\n\r\nIt is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare that the\r\npart of our country which was lately the scene of disorder and insurrection\r\nnow enjoys the blessings of quiet and order. The misled have abandoned\r\ntheir errors, and pay the respect to our Constitution and laws which is due\r\nfrom good citizens to the public authorities of the society. These\r\ncircumstances have induced me to pardon generally the offenders here\r\nreferred to, and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to\r\ncapital punishment. For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to\r\nexercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am\r\nvested, yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than\r\nit is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government\r\nevery degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice,\r\ndignity, and safety may permit.\r\n\r\nGentlemen: Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course\r\nof the session, a review of our military establishment is not the least\r\nimportant. It is called for by the events which have changed, and may be\r\nexpected still further to change, the relative situation of our frontiers.\r\nIn this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the considerations\r\nthat the questions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet\r\nfinally adjusted, that the war in Europe is not yet terminated, and that\r\nour Western posts, when recovered, will demand provision for garrisoning\r\nand securing them. A statement of our present military force will be laid\r\nbefore you by the Department of War.\r\n\r\nWith the review of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of\r\nthe militia. It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan\r\nfurther experience may have unfolded. The subject is of so much moment in\r\nmy estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the consideration of\r\nit may be renewed until the greatest attainable perfection shall be\r\naccomplished. Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the\r\nobject, while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\nWhile we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our Western\r\nborders so well authorizes, it is necessary that we should not lose sight\r\nof an important truth which continually receives new confirmations, namely,\r\nthat the provisions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the\r\nIndians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants\r\nare insufficient. It is demonstrated that these violences can now be\r\nperpetrated with impunity, and it can need no argument to prove that unless\r\nthe murdering of Indians can be restrained by bringing the murderers to\r\ncondign punishment, all the exertions of the Government to prevent\r\ndestructive retaliations by the Indians will prove fruitless and all our\r\npresent agreeable prospects illusory. The frequent destruction of innocent\r\nwomen and children, who are chiefly the victims of retaliation, must\r\ncontinue to shock humanity, and an enormous expense to drain the Treasury\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nTo enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is indispensable\r\nthat there shall be competent means of rendering justice to them. If these\r\nmeans can be devised by the wisdom of Congress, and especially if there can\r\nbe added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians\r\non reasonable terms (a measure the mention of which I the more readily\r\nrepeat, as in all the conferences with them they urge it with solicitude),\r\nI should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our\r\ntranquillity permanent. I add with pleasure that the probability even of\r\ntheir civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been\r\nthus far made under the auspices of Government. The accomplishment of this\r\nwork, if practicable, will reflect undecaying luster on our national\r\ncharacter and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds\r\ncan know.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe state of our revenue, with the sums which have been borrowed and\r\nreimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress, will be submitted from\r\nthe proper Department, together with an estimate of the appropriations\r\nnecessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nWhether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the\r\nredemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination.\r\nCongress have demonstrated their sense to be, and it were superfluous to\r\nrepeat mine, that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable\r\nextinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest of our\r\ncountry as with the general sense of our constituents.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nThe statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will shew\r\nthe situation of that institution and the necessity of some further\r\nlegislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely into\r\neffect, and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe progress in providing materials for the frigates and in building them,\r\nthe state of the fortifications of our harbors, the measures which have\r\nbeen pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals and for replenishing\r\nour magazines with military stores, and the steps which have been taken\r\ntoward the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians will\r\nlikewise be presented for the information of Congress.\r\n\r\nTemperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the\r\ncourse of the session and mutual forbearance where there is a difference of\r\nopinion are too obvious and necessary for the peace, happiness, and welfare\r\nof our country to need any recommendation of mine.\r\n\r\nGO. WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge Washington\r\nDecember 7, 1796\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nIn recurring to the internal situation of our country since I had last the\r\npleasure to address you, I find ample reason for a renewed expression of\r\nthat gratitude to the Ruler of the Universe which a continued series of\r\nprosperity has so often and so justly called forth.\r\n\r\nThe acts of the last session which required special arrangements have been\r\nas far as circumstances would admit carried into operation.\r\n\r\nMeasures calculated to insure a continuance of the friendship of the\r\nIndians and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier\r\nhave been digested and adopted. In the framing of these care has been taken\r\nto guard on the one hand our advanced settlements from the predatory\r\nincursions of those unruly individuals who can not be restrained by their\r\ntribes, and on the other hand to protect the rights secured to the Indians\r\nby treaty--to draw them nearer to the civilized state and inspire them\r\nwith correct conceptions of the power as well as justice of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the deputies from the Creek Nation at Colerain, in the State\r\nof Georgia, which had for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of\r\ntheir land by that State, broke up without its being accomplished, the\r\nnation having previous to their departure instructed them against making\r\nany sale. The occasion, however, has been improved to confirm by a new\r\ntreaty with the Creeks their preexisting engagements with the United\r\nStates, and to obtain their consent to the establishment of trading houses\r\nand military posts within their boundary, by means of which their\r\nfriendship and the general peace may be more effectually secured.\r\n\r\nThe period during the late session at which the appropriation was passed\r\nfor carrying into effect the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation\r\nbetween the United States and His Brittanic Majesty necessarily\r\nprocrastinated the reception of the posts stipulated to be delivered beyond\r\nthe date assigned for that event. As soon, however, as the Governor-General\r\nof Canada could be addressed with propriety on the subject, arrangements\r\nwere cordially and promptly concluded for their evacuation, and the United\r\nStates took possession of the principal of them, comprehending Oswego,\r\nNiagara, Detroit, Michilimackinac, and Fort Miami, where such repairs and\r\nadditions have been ordered to be made as appeared indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great\r\nBritain to determine which is the river St. Croix mentioned in the treaty\r\nof peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson, esq., of New York,\r\nfor the 3rd commissioner. The whole met at St. Andrew's, in Passamaquoddy\r\nBay, in the beginning of October, and directed surveys to be made of the\r\nrivers in dispute; but deeming it impracticable to have these surveys\r\ncompleted before the next year, they adjourned to meet at Boston in August,\r\n1797, for the final decision of the question.\r\n\r\nOther commissioners appointed on the part of the United States, agreeably\r\nto the 7th article of the treaty with Great Britain, relative to captures\r\nand condemnation of vessels and other property, met the commissioners of\r\nHis Britannic Majesty in London in August last, when John Trumbull, esq.,\r\nwas chosen by lot for the 5th commissioner. In October following the board\r\nwere to proceed to business. As yet there has been no communication of\r\ncommissioners on the part of Great Britain to unite with those who have\r\nbeen appointed on the part of the United States for carrying into effect\r\nthe 6th article of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Spain required that the commissioners for running the\r\nboundary line between the territory of the United States and His Catholic\r\nMajesty's provinces of East and West Florida should meet at the Natchez\r\nbefore the expiration of 6 months after the exchange of the ratifications,\r\nwhich was effected at Aranjuez on the 25th day of April; and the\r\ntroops of His Catholic Majesty occupying any posts within the limits of\r\nthe United States were within the same time period to be withdrawn. The\r\ncommissioner of the United States therefore commenced his journey for the\r\nNatchez in September, and troops were ordered to occupy the posts from\r\nwhich the Spanish garrisons should be withdrawn. Information has been\r\nrecently received of the appointment of a commissioner on the part of His\r\nCatholic Majesty for running the boundary line, but none of any appointment\r\nfor the adjustment of the claims of our citizens whose vessels were\r\ncaptured by the armed vessels of Spain.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act of Congress passed in the last session for the\r\nprotection and relief of American sea-men, agents were appointed, one to\r\nreside in Great Britain and the other in the West Indies. The effects of\r\nthe agency in the West Indies are not yet fully ascertained, but those\r\nwhich have been communicated afford grounds to believe the measure will be\r\nbeneficial. The agent destined to reside in Great Britain declining to\r\naccept the appointment, the business has consequently devolved on the\r\nminister of the United States in London, and will command his attention\r\nuntil a new agent shall be appointed.\r\n\r\nAfter many delays and disappointments arising out of the European war, the\r\nfinal arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and\r\nRegency of Algiers will in all present appearance be crowned with success,\r\nbut under great, though inevitable, disadvantages in the pecuniary\r\ntransactions occasioned by that war, which will render further provision\r\nnecessary. The actual liberation of all our citizens who were prisoners in\r\nAlgiers, while it gratifies every feeling of heart, is itself an earnest of\r\na satisfactory termination of the whole negotiation. Measures are in\r\noperation for effecting treaties with the Regencies of Tunis and Tripoli.\r\n\r\nTo an active external commerce the protection of a naval force is\r\nindispensable. This is manifest with regard to wars in which a State is\r\nitself a party. But besides this, it is in our own experience that the most\r\nsincere neutrality is not a sufficient guard against the depredations of\r\nnations at war. To secure respect to a neutral flag requires a naval force\r\norganized and ready to vindicate it from insult or aggression. This may\r\neven prevent the necessity of going to war by discouraging belligerent\r\npowers from committing such violations of the rights of the neutral party\r\nas may, first or last, leave no other option. From the best information I\r\nhave been able to obtain it would seem as if our trade to the Mediterranean\r\nwithout a protecting force will always be insecure and our citizens exposed\r\nto the calamities from which numbers of them have but just been relieved.\r\n\r\nThese considerations invite the United States to look to the means, and to\r\nset about the gradual creation of a navy. The increasing progress of their\r\nnavigation promises them at no distant period the requisite supply of\r\nsea-men, and their means in other respects favor the undertaking. It is an\r\nencouragement, likewise, that their particular situation will give weight\r\nand influence to a moderate naval force in their hands. Will it not, then,\r\nbe advisable to begin without delay to provide and lay up the materials for\r\nthe building and equipping of ships of war, and to proceed in the work by\r\ndegrees, in proportion as our resources shall render it practicable without\r\ninconvenience, so that a future war of Europe may not find our commerce in\r\nthe same unprotected state in which it was found by the present?\r\n\r\nCongress have repeatedly, and not without success, directed their attention\r\nto the encouragement of manufactures. The object is of too much consequence\r\nnot to insure a continuance of their efforts in every way which shall\r\nappear eligible. As a general rule, manufactures on public account are\r\ninexpedient; but where the state of things in a country leaves little hope\r\nthat certain branches of manufacture will for a great length of time\r\nobtain, when these are of a nature essential to the furnishing and\r\nequipping of the public force in time of war, are not establishments for\r\nprocuring them on public account to the extent of the ordinary demand for\r\nthe public service recommended by strong considerations of national policy\r\nas an exception to the general rule?\r\n\r\nOught our country to remain in such cases dependent on foreign supply,\r\nprecarious because liable to be interrupted? If the necessary article\r\nshould in this mode cost more in time of peace, will not the security and\r\nindependence thence arising form an ample compensation?\r\n\r\nEstablishments of this sort, commensurate only with the calls of the public\r\nservice in time of peace, will in time of war easily be extended in\r\nproportion to the exigencies of the Government, and may even perhaps be\r\nmade to yield a surplus for the supply of our citizens at large, so as to\r\nmitigate the privations from the interruption of their trade. If adopted,\r\nthe plan ought to exclude all those branches which are already, or likely\r\nsoon to be, established in the country, in order that there may be no danger\r\nof interference with pursuits of individual industry.\r\n\r\nIt will not be doubted that with reference either to individual or national\r\nwelfare agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as nations\r\nadvance in population and other circumstances of maturity this truth\r\nbecomes more apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and\r\nmore an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting it grow up,\r\nsupported by the public purse; and to what object can it be dedicated with\r\ngreater propriety?\r\n\r\nAmong the means which have been employed to this end none have been\r\nattended with greater success than the establishment of boards (composed of\r\nproper characters) charged with collecting and diffusing information, and\r\nenabled by premiums and small pecuniary aids to encourage and assist a\r\nspirit of discovery and improvement. This species of establishment\r\ncontributes doubly to the increase of improvement by stimulating to\r\nenterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a common center the results\r\neverywhere of individual skill and observation, and spreading them thence\r\nover the whole nation. Experience accordingly has shewn that they are very\r\ncheap instruments of immense national benefits.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore proposed to the consideration of Congress the expediency\r\nof establishing a national university and also a military academy. The\r\ndesirableness of both these institutions has so constantly increased with\r\nevery new view I have taken of the subject that I can not omit the\r\nopportunity of once for all recalling your attention to them.\r\n\r\nThe assembly to which I address myself is too enlightened not to be fully\r\nsensible how much a flourishing state of the arts and sciences contributes\r\nto national prosperity and reputation.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that our country, much to its honor, contains many seminaries of\r\nlearning highly repeatable and useful; but the funds upon which they rest\r\nare too narrow to command the ablest professors in the different\r\ndepartments of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplated, though\r\nthey would be excellent auxiliaries.\r\n\r\nAmongst the motives to such an institution, the assimilation of the\r\nprinciples, opinions, and manners of our country-men by the common\r\neducation of a portion of our youth from every quarter well deserves\r\nattention. The more homogenous our citizens can be made in these\r\nparticulars the greater will be our prospect of permanent union; and a\r\nprimary object of such a national institution should be the education of\r\nour youth in the science of government. In a republic what species of\r\nknowledge can be equally important and what duty more pressing on its\r\nlegislature than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those who are\r\nto be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?\r\n\r\nThe institution of a military academy is also recommended by cogent\r\nreasons. However pacific the general policy of a nation may be, it ought\r\nnever to be without an adequate stock of military knowledge for\r\nemergencies. The first would impair the energy of its character, and both\r\nwould hazard its safety or expose it to greater evils when war could not be\r\navoided; besides that, war might often not depend upon its own choice. In\r\nproportion as the observance of pacific maxims might exempt a nation from\r\nthe necessity of practicing the rules of the military art ought to be its\r\ncare in preserving and transmitting, by proper establishments, the\r\nknowledge of that art.\r\n\r\nWhatever argument may be drawn from particular examples superficially\r\nviewed, a thorough examination of the subject will evince that the art of\r\nwar is at once comprehensive and complicated, that it demands much previous\r\nstudy, and that the possession of it in its most improved and perfect state\r\nis always of great moment to the security of a nation. This, therefore,\r\nought to be a serious care of every government, and for this purpose an\r\nacademy where a regular course of instruction is given is an obvious\r\nexpedient which different nations have successfully employed.\r\n\r\nThe compensation to the officers of the United States in various instances,\r\nand in none more than in respect to the most important stations, appear to\r\ncall for legislative revision. The consequences of a defective provision\r\nare of serious import to the Government. If private wealth is to supply the\r\ndefect of public retribution, it will greatly contract the sphere within\r\nwhich the selection of character for office is to be made, and will\r\nproportionally diminish the probability of a choice of men able as well as\r\nupright. Besides that, it should be repugnant to the vital principles of\r\nour Government virtually to exclude from public trusts talents and virtue\r\nunless accompanied by wealth.\r\n\r\nWhile in our external relations some serious inconveniences and\r\nembarrassments have been overcome and others lessened, it is with much pain\r\nand deep regret I mention that circumstances of a very unwelcome nature\r\nhave lately occurred. Our trade has suffered and is suffering extensive\r\ninjuries in the West Indies from the cruisers and agents of the French\r\nRepublic, and communications have been received from its minister here\r\nwhich indicate the danger of a further disturbance of our commerce by its\r\nauthority, and which are in other respects far from agreeable.\r\n\r\nIt has been my constant, sincere, and earnest wish, in conformity with that\r\nof our nation, to maintain cordial harmony and a perfectly friendly\r\nunderstanding with that Republic. This wish remains unabated, and I shall\r\npersevere in the endeavor to fulfill it to the utmost extent of what shall\r\nbe consistent with a just and indispensable regard to the rights and honor\r\nof our country; nor will I easily cease to cherish the expectation that a\r\nspirit of justice, candor, and friendship on the part of the Republic will\r\neventually insure success.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing this course, however, I can not forget what is due to the\r\ncharacter of our Government and nation, or to a full and entire confidence\r\nin the good sense, patriotism, self-respect, and fortitude of my\r\ncountry-men.\r\n\r\nI reserve for a special message a more particular communication on this\r\ninteresting subject.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nI have directed an estimate of the appropriations necessary for the service\r\nof the ensuing year to be submitted from the proper Department, with a view\r\nof the public receipts and expenditures to the latest period to which an\r\naccount can be prepared.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction I am able to inform you that the revenues of the\r\nUnited States continue in a state of progressive improvement.\r\n\r\nA reenforcement of the existing provisions for discharging our public debt\r\nwas mentioned in my address at the opening of the last session. Some\r\npreliminary steps were taken toward it, the maturing of which will no doubt\r\nengage your zealous attention during the present. I will only add that it\r\nwill afford me a heart-felt satisfaction to concur in such further measures\r\nas will ascertain to our country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of\r\nthe debt. Posterity may have cause to regret if from any motive intervals\r\nof tranquillity are left unimproved for accelerating this valuable end.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nMy solicitude to see the militia of the United States placed on an\r\nefficient establishment has been so often and so ardently expressed that I\r\nshall but barely recall the subject to your view on the present occasion,\r\nat the same time that I shall submit to your inquiry whether our harbors\r\nare yet sufficiently secured.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which I now stand for the last time, in the midst of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people of the United States, naturally recalls the\r\nperiod when the administration of the present form of government commenced,\r\nand I can not omit the occasion to congratulate you and my country on the\r\nsuccess of the experiment, nor to repeat my fervent supplications to the\r\nSupreme Ruler of the Universe and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations that His\r\nprovidential care may still be extended to the United States, that the\r\nvirtue and happiness of the people may be preserved, and that the\r\nGovernment which they have instituted for the protection of their liberties\r\nmay be perpetual.\r\n\r\nGO.
