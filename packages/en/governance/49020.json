BRANCH’S ALLIGATOR.\r\n\r\nVolume I.—No. 5.] SATURDAY, MAY 22, 1858. [Price 2 Cents.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by\r\n\r\n                          STEPHEN H. BRANCH,\r\n\r\n In the Clerk’s Office of the District Court of the United States for\r\n                  the Southern District of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife of Stephen H Branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nvery silly, as ointment will soon cure it.” He said: “I knew a man\r\nwho applied ointment five years, and his itch got worse every year.”\r\nThis was a bomb that quickened my pulsation. I then said: “Perhaps\r\nyou have got the salt rheum, and I advise you to consult Dr. Plympton\r\nimmediately.” He said: “I’ll go now, and I want you to go with me.”\r\nAs Plympton was the Superintendent of my itch, I did not know what\r\nresponse to make. But as he might be absent, or if at home, determined\r\nto remain without while Terry went in, I at length said: “Well, I will\r\ngo with you,” and over we went to the Doctor’s, who, to my great joy,\r\nwas not in. I then told Terry that I must go to my room, and get my\r\nlessons, but that he mast remain until Dr. Plympton returned, and he\r\nsaid he would. Terry rushed into my room in about an hour, a shade\r\npaler than a ghost, and exclaimed:—“Branch! the Doctor says that I\r\nmust have caught the itch from you, as it is precisely like yours.” If\r\na cannon ball had entered the window, it could not have thrilled my\r\nframe like the disclosures of Plympton, which I regarded as safe with\r\nhim as myself. But the old cat was out, and I had to face her sharp\r\nclaws. So I told poor Terry the whole story, and that if he had not\r\nlocked the door, and forced me to sleep with him, he would not have\r\ncaught the itch. He mildly chided me for not disclosing that I had the\r\nitch, as, if I had, he certainly would have unlocked the door with much\r\npleasure, and let me out. But he forgave me, and asked me to room with\r\nhim, so that we could apply the itch ointment together, before the same\r\nfire, and talk the matter over, and compare symptoms, and sympathize\r\nwith each other, and eat and sleep together with impunity, and read\r\ndistinguished itch authors, and go to Dr. Plympton’s together, until we\r\ngot cured. I told Terry that if we did all that, we would so thoroughly\r\ninocculate each other with the itch, that all the doctors of the globe\r\ncould not wrench it from our blood, and that we would transmit the\r\nitch to our posterity for ten thousand years, and then it would not\r\nbe entirely out of the system. Terry looked amazed, and said he felt\r\nfaint, and called for gin and water, and stared like an\r\n\r\n  Egyptian Daddy,\r\n  Or Tiemann Granny,\r\n  Or Peter Mummy,\r\n  Or Edward Sonny,\r\n  Some five thousand years old,\r\n  Whose wills were never sold,\r\n  Nor their offices for gold,\r\n  As we oft have been told;\r\n  Who loved their constituents\r\n  Far better than stimulants,\r\n  Or their sons and brothers,\r\n  And a good many others.\r\n  O, fiddle-de-dee,\r\n  Ye Coopers three,\r\n  You’ll not cheat me,\r\n  No, sirs-ree,\r\n  While I’m free,\r\n  As you’ll see![pointing-hand symbol]\r\n\r\nAnd Terry said he hoped I would excuse him, as he felt nervous, and\r\nwould like to go to bed, and I bade him good night, and went to see\r\nPlympton, and assured him that if he told the students I had the itch,\r\nit would mortify my feelings, and spread, and terrify all Cambridge,\r\nand I might be mobbed, and he most solemnly vowed that he would make no\r\nfurther disclosures. And I returned to the College, and saturated my\r\nbody with ointment, and retired, and sweat, and scratched all night,\r\nand did not close my weary eyes until the Cambridge rooster crowed.\r\n\r\n (To be continued to our last loan.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet the Firemen Stand to their Guns!\r\n\r\n _And Never Surrender their Glorious Volunteer System to the Corrupt\r\n Politicians, and with it their Widows’ and Orphans’ Fund._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wrote and published the following document in the _New York\r\nHerald_ one year before we opened our batteries against George W.\r\nMatsell’s alienage. But it is more appropriate now than in 1854, as\r\nthe enthusiastic champions of a Paid Fire Department are inclosing\r\nand about to overwhelm the adversaries of that fatal system, like the\r\nallied armies the great Napoleon at Waterloo. Although we had written\r\nthe Annual and Special Fire Reports of Alfred Carson in 1851, ‘2, and\r\n‘3, yet we wrote and published this document without his consultation,\r\nas he was in _Troy_, New York, when it appeared in the _Herald_;\r\nbut when he read it in the cars between Albany and New York, he was\r\ndelighted with it, as he informed us on his arrival in this city. The\r\nFiremen will perceive that it was written soon after the destruction\r\nof Jenning’s Clothing Store in Broadway, and the loss of human life;\r\nand that we hurl back the ungenerous charges of almost the universal\r\npress of New York, that the firemen were a gang of thieves, because\r\nsome cheap and scorched and wet clothing was placed over the chilly and\r\nmangled and dying firemen by their weeping comrades on that mournful\r\noccasion, and found on their dead bodies in the City Hospital.\r\n\r\nBut read, Firemen, read, and unite to a man against all who would\r\ndestroy the _Volunteer Fire System of New York_, which is the best\r\never devised since the forests and Indians yielded to civilization and\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the New York Herald of May 14, 1854._\r\n\r\nFIREMEN OF NEW YORK:—The columns of almost every public journal are\r\nclosed against you. The hand of almost every editor is uplifted to\r\nstrike you down. The scurvy politicians, to a man, are against you,\r\nand the insurance corporations are spending their money freely to\r\ndistract and subvert your organization, for the first time since the\r\nIndians transmitted their fire department to the pale faces. And why\r\nthis unhallowed alliance of the press, politicians, and insurance\r\ncorporations, for your demolition? I will tell you. The press would\r\nblot out Alfred Carson, because he dared attack them, and silence\r\ntheir base libels on his good name; the corrupt politicians would bury\r\nyourselves and Carson in one common ruin, because you have driven\r\ntheir Aldermanic cronies back to their dreary abodes of reflection\r\nand remorse, and the biting neglect of meritorious citizens; and the\r\ninsurance companies have secretly united to destroy you, because you\r\nand your predecessors have been so kind and true to them and their\r\nancestors for one or two centuries. Ingratitude is of rare occurrence\r\namong honorable men, but from soulless corporations it is to be\r\nexpected, although they are composed of creatures who profess to have\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nA paid fire department is the ostensible cry of the press; but your\r\nchastisement is their leading motive, because you have clung like\r\nbrothers to your Chief, against their maledictions. Their first object\r\nis to render you obnoxious with the people. And how would they effect\r\nthis? Not by honorable means, but by branding you indiscriminately\r\nas thieves, even while some of you are imploring, in the name of a\r\nhumane God, to be extricated from burning ruins, and when the thrilling\r\ncries of your deceased comrades could be heard in their editorial\r\nclosets; and, when extricated, (some dead, and others apparently in\r\ntheir last gasp,) these editors send you, editorially, to the hospital\r\nor to Greenwood, as a gang of worthless thieves. They thus degrade\r\nand lacerate the bleeding hearts of your distracted kindred; and, to\r\nmake sure of their victims, living and dead, they devise a hellish\r\nplot to entrap your noble Chief Engineer to testify against your\r\ndeparted companions, whose testimony before the Coroner’s Jury, was\r\nmost shamefully perverted by almost every press in the city. And these\r\neditors do all this to operate on the people, and in favor of a paid\r\nfire department.\r\n\r\nFiremen, you do not merit this degradation and this cruel persecution\r\nfrom the press, (the safety of whose costly establishments you watch\r\nwith such sleepless vigilance,) simply because you have conscientiously\r\ntestified your undeviating devotion to your Chief, who has shared\r\nyour perils for so many years, while those who would degrade and\r\ndestroy you, are sweetly reposing on feather beds, and making glorious\r\ndividends from your gratuitous and perilous labors.\r\n\r\nThe editors prate about the thievish propensities of firemen, as though\r\nthere were no thieves among the editors; but these editors must be a\r\nmost infernal set of scamps from their glowing accounts of each other.\r\nAnd the editors prognosticate no more thefts if the firemen are only\r\npaid good fat salaries, and are called brigadiers, or brigade firemen.\r\nThese brigadiers must come direct from Heaven, if there be not, here\r\nand there, a devil among them. Louis Napoleon elected himself Emperor\r\nthrough his fire brigades, and other similar organizations; and\r\nMatsell, backed by a large portion of the press and the politicians,\r\nmay have some mischievous game in view, for he is in his shirt sleeves\r\nfor a fire brigade.—Brigadier Matsell! How that would sound! And a\r\nBrigadier of two Departments, viz.: the fire and the police. O, there’s\r\nmuch in that. Did not Matsell once attempt to wear a white fireman’s\r\ncap? and did not Anderson make him take it off? And did not Matsell\r\norder a general alarm at the fire in Forsyth street the other day? Oh,\r\nfiremen, why will you repose on a volcano?\r\n\r\nMuch is said by the press of the independence of the police, under\r\nits present organization. But does not Matsell report the trembling\r\npolicemen for misdemeanor to the Mayor, Recorder, and City Judge, whose\r\naction is final in their removal? This power, in the hands of Matsell,\r\nis a lash, and enables him, in connection with his captains and\r\nlieutenants, to control the city. How easy for a police captain, under\r\ninstructions from Matsell, to silence the clamors of their political\r\nopponents at the polls, and to incarcerate, (in the Tombs or station\r\nhouses, until the election is over, and the votes are “satisfactorily”\r\ncounted,) under the pretext of disturbance, all those who dared oppose\r\nMatsell’s candidates, and the candidates of Matsell’s friends among the\r\npress and the politicians. And if we had another powerful political\r\norganization, in the form of a paid fire department, or Napoleonic Fire\r\nBrigade, that would harmonize in its action with the police department,\r\nand with the leading politicians, and with the press, and with the\r\ninsurance and other corporations, what would become of the right of\r\npractical suffrage in the city of New York? It would exist only in name.\r\n\r\nWith power equally distributed among the nations of Europe, there would\r\nbe no cause for war. Nicholas thinks he can resist all Europe in arms:\r\nhence the present war. What mainly preserves the union of the States\r\nis the equality of representation of States in the American Senate,\r\nthrough which the reserved rights of the States are chiefly protected.\r\nAnd what will preserve the city of New York from conflagration, and\r\nbest protect the ballot-box, and promote the best interests of the\r\ncity, will be for the press to be far less grasping in its desires\r\nfor universal power, through its advocation of, and its subsequent\r\nintimate connection with, the leading officers of dangerous political\r\norganizations, which must ultimately result in their absorption of the\r\nright of suffrage, and perhaps in the destruction of the city itself.\r\nLet the press and the public organizations studiously move in their\r\nrespective spheres, like the States and the General Government,—a\r\nserious collision, or too friendly intimacy, being equally fatal to\r\nboth, and to all concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Press has power enough, and quite as much as the people can safely\r\nallow them. The public corporations have more power than is consistent\r\nwith the public safety, and the purity and exercise of the elective\r\nfranchise. But I repeat, that with a police department, and paid fire\r\ndepartment, and other public corporations, and the press, all united in\r\na specified object, God have mercy on the city of New York. Farewell,\r\nthen, to the right of suffrage in this city. The paid firemen and\r\nthe paid policemen, openly or tacitly sustained by the press, would\r\nutterly block up and control the passages leading to the ballot-boxes,\r\npermitting (as many of the police do now) only those to vote who could\r\ngive the countersign. This fearful consolidation of power in the first\r\nAmerican city might lead to the most deplorable results to the whole\r\ncountry. We have not existed eighty years as a Republic, which is a\r\nvery brief period in the silent and trackless footsteps of centuries.\r\nThe American eagle might fall to-morrow from his projecting cliff,\r\nnever to rise. Rome ruled, and finally destroyed the Roman Empire. So\r\nwith Athens and Alexandria, and other ancient cities. Paris, through\r\npolitical organizations, rules France. These associations, controlled\r\nby a bold, reckless, and accomplished leader, can make France a\r\nrepublic to-day, and a despotism to-morrow. London, through her public\r\ncorporations, which were gradually stolen from the people, controls the\r\nBritish empire, on whose vast possessions the sun never sets. And why\r\nshould not New York, with similar organizations, and controlled by a\r\ncrafty, irresponsible, unscrupulous, and unbridled press, ultimately\r\nreduce the Whole country to despotism and degrading vassalage? Some of\r\nour leading and most honorable statesmen will tell you that the city\r\nof New York controls the national conventions of either party, and\r\nthe national politics, through half a dozen bloated political scamps,\r\nlocated in this city and Albany.\r\n\r\nFiremen of New York, and other citizens, are you prepared to incur\r\nthese perils? If not, arise and resist the superhuman efforts to\r\ndisgrace and destroy you! Grasp and hold with giant strength the\r\nlittle you have left of the right of suffrage;—cling, with undying\r\nfirmness and affection, to your noble organization; resist the attempts\r\nto saddle this tax-ridden city with an additional tax of nearly one\r\nmillion of dollars, for the support of a paid fire department, and\r\navert the possible contingency that some mushroom scoundrel may, at\r\nno remote day, haughtily dispense the curses of monarchy or unlimited\r\ndespotism on the ruins of your country!\r\n\r\nA paid fire department, composed of a limited number of hired\r\nmercenaries, could not protect this city so effectually as a voluntary\r\nsystem. It could be done in the cities of Europe, where the habitations\r\nare composed of bricks, granite, marble, and other substances\r\nimpervious to fire, but not in New York, where almost every edifice is\r\na pile of shavings, or combustible matter. Moreover, hired civilians\r\nare the same as hired soldiers. Both work for pay, and not for public\r\nutility and renown. But the volunteer firemen of New York are as\r\nzealous and courageous as the soldiers of the Revolution, while paid\r\nfiremen would evince the slothfulness and cowardice of the British in\r\nthat memorable contest. Any man contending for liberty, and his wife\r\nand children, can easily rend to fragments three cowardly mercenary\r\ncombatants, and a volunteer fireman of New York, panting for deeds of\r\nvalor, and the love and respect of his fellow men, can effect more than\r\nhalf a dozen paid lazzaroni, who go to their perilous task as slaves go\r\nto the field.\r\n\r\nFor years the press of New York has disgusted and insulted the\r\nfiremen, by striving to make the people believe that the police were\r\nmore efficient at fires than the firemen; and most of these puffs are\r\nwritten at Matsell’s and the Captains’ offices. We now begin to see the\r\nmotive of this, which was two-fold. First, to make the police system\r\npopular with the people—and it has required an immense deal of puffing\r\nto make it even tolerable with the people. And, secondly, to prepare\r\nthe people for another police organization in the form of a paid fire\r\ndepartment. We shall not recur to the past, but will recur to the\r\nfuture files of the press, and we will venture the prediction that, ere\r\nmany days, it will be publicly announced that poor Matsell has either\r\nbroken his thigh at a fire, or had his coat burned entirely from his\r\nback, or that he has saved the lives of seventy-five policemen, by\r\nordering them down stairs just as the fatal crash was about to come;\r\nor, fancying himself Chief Engineer, he has actually struck a general\r\nalarm, as in Forsyth street. Or it may be announced that Captains\r\nBrennan, Leonard, or some other daring policemen, have quenched a\r\ntolerably large conflagration before the firemen arrived; and that, at\r\nthe same terrific fire, they saved the lives of several men, women, and\r\nchildren, at the imminent risk of losing their own valuable lives.\r\n\r\nThis base stuff, and these monstrous lies, which daily fill the\r\ncolumns of the Press, concocted by the Police Department as early and\r\nvaluable news, may have rendered the Police Department a little more\r\ntolerable with the people, but, at the same time, it has created a\r\nbreach and a deadly hatred between the policemen and the firemen that\r\nwill not be effaced while the present race of editors shall exist.\r\nAnd if they would atone for the mischief they have thus created, and\r\nwould have more friendly relations subsist between the Police and Fire\r\nDepartments, the sooner they stop such disgusting nonsense the better\r\nfor them, and for the city at large.\r\n\r\n  STEPHEN H. BRANCH.\r\n\r\nMay 14, 1854.\r\n\r\nAnd now, firemen, be vigilant, or you are lost. You are surrounded by\r\nspies and internal foes, who talk in favor of the Volunteer System, and\r\nyet in ambush are toiling unceasingly against it. The Fire Department\r\nswarms with these hypocrites, who are mostly politicians, and employed\r\nto stab your Volunteer System by the chief robbers of the politicians,\r\nwho desire to strangle the rights of the people, and rob and oppress\r\nthem with taxation, through two such overshadowing political\r\norganizations as the Fire and Police Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen H. Branch’s Alligator.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, SATURDAY, MAY 22, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMENTATIONS OF A GRAHAMITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the advent of Homœopathy a physician said: “There, Branch, take one\r\ndrop every hour, and if you feel a twitch in the arms, or fingers, or\r\ntoes, describe your electric thrills as accurately as possible, and\r\nlet me see your notes when we meet again.” The anticipated twitches\r\nin the far extremities alarmed us, lest our heart might get a slight\r\ntwitch, and we be very suddenly twitched into the grim abode of\r\nwithered skeletons. We were eating Graham bread at this time with\r\nHorace Greeley, in Barclay street, and averaged about eight loaves a\r\nday between us, exclusive of the mush and stewed apples. An allopathic\r\nphysician had assured us that all our fat was gone, save a small chunk\r\nnear the spleen, and Horace warned us to take no medicine, but to duck\r\nour carcase every day, which would soon bring to the surface all the\r\nindiscretions of early years, as he had long averaged two baths a day,\r\nwhich produced two hundred boils, of which only twenty-eight remained.\r\nSo, on a winter’s morning, about five o’clock, we entered a little\r\nEgyptian mummy canvas perpendicular box, (before the introduction of\r\nthe blessed Croton,) and hooked the canvas pine-frame door, and pulled\r\nthe string, and down came the icy water. In our thrilling despair and\r\nunconsciousness, we grasped the string, like a drowning man a straw,\r\nand jerked and re-jerked it, until we broke the entire upper cistern\r\narrangements, when down came ten hogsheads of rain water on our poor\r\nhead, and washed away the mummy box, and us with it. After a Jonah\r\nscuffle, we crawled out of the box, and opened the bath-room door,\r\nand screamed fire, and murder, and sea-weed, and ran down stairs,\r\nwith ten hogsheads of water at our heels. We ran into the kitchen,\r\nwhere the servants slept, who sprang from their beds, and ran into the\r\nstreet, and yelled, and aroused the neighbors,—and hens cackled, and\r\ncats mewed, and dogs barked, in all directions. We seized a tub and\r\ndashed up stairs against the overwhelming torrent, and found about\r\nforty lean Grahamites, up to their knees in water, and poor MacDonald\r\nClarke and Horace Greeley among them, bailing for their lives, in their\r\nnocturnal mantles. Chairs, and books, and umbrellas, were floating on\r\nthe bosom of the waters, and the scene resembled the devastation of\r\nNoah’s deluge, or the encampment of California miners, at the rise\r\nand desolation of the Sacramento and her tributary streams. The walls\r\nwere soon re-plastered, and new carpets laid, and chaos and saturation\r\ndeparted. We partially recovered from the bathing concussion, but were\r\nslowly wasting, and approaching the Spirit land, when we consulted\r\nan allopathic physician, (who was an old friend of ours,) who told\r\nus that Graham bread and mush had diminished and nearly paralyzed\r\nour kidneys, and that we must drink gin or die. We told him that our\r\nFather was President of the Rhode Island State Temperance Society, and\r\nthat we belonged to three Teetotal Societies, and was President of\r\none, and Recording Secretary of another, and that we could not drink\r\ngin, although we might possibly go ginger pop, without violating the\r\nConstitution of either Society. The Doctor then said: “Well, Branch,\r\ngive me both hands, and let me also embrace you most fervently, and\r\neven kiss you, as you will probably die in about three days, and I\r\nshall never see you again, until I come to your funeral. Good by, my\r\ngood fellow, and may God bless you in the other world.” “Good Lord,\r\nDoctor, don’t go—but bring on your gin, and I’ll drink a gallon to\r\nbegin with, and more if you say so. I’m not prepared to die, and dam\r\nthe Temperance Societies, where life and death and decayed kidneys\r\nare involved.” He then went to the Astor House, and got a quart of\r\nthe purest gin, and told us to drink freely of it, which we did, and\r\nsoon felt so happy that we arose from our bed, and went to Mitchell’s\r\nOlympic Theatre, where the sweet Mary Taylor was placarded for the\r\nChild of the Regiment, and Mitchell for Jem Bags. The gin had now got\r\nthe better of us, and we talked, and laughed, and hissed the actors,\r\nuntil Mitchell approached the foot-lights, and made an inflammatory\r\nspeech against us, when a deafening shout arose: “Put him out! put him\r\nout!” and out we went, in a mighty hurry, over the heads of ladies and\r\ngentlemen. On reaching the outer door, a policeman saw us, whom we had\r\nlearned to read and write, who accompanied us to the Graham House, and\r\nleft us at the street door. We staggered up stairs, and got into the\r\nbed room of two nervous old maids, who were rigid Grahamites, and as\r\nthin as shads, who screamed so frightfully, that we got out as soon as\r\npossible, lest they would scratch our eyes out, and tear us to bleeding\r\ntatters. We then got into the bed room of Horace Greeley, who poked\r\nout his bald head from his straw pillow and scanty Graham bed-clothes,\r\nand exclaimed: “Who’s there?” “Thou pale and ghastly shadow! what\r\ndost thou in my bed? How dare you enter the sacred precincts of my\r\ndomestic castle?” “Yon dam drunken vagabond! you are a liar, if you\r\nsay I’m in your bed. This is my room, and my couch, and if you don’t\r\nleave, I’ll throw my boot at your bewildered skull.—Hence! thou\r\nmiserable sot! Away!” We then approached him, and sat on the side of\r\nhis narrow cot, and stroked his chin, when he gave us a tremendous\r\nblow, in the face, and made our nose bleed copiously. He then arose,\r\nand perceiving who we were, expressed the deepest sorrow, and bathed\r\nour nostrils, and led us to our room in the attic, and undressed us,\r\nand put us to bed, and tucked in the blankets, and after a scathing\r\nlecture against intemperance, he left us with a fond good night. We\r\nsent for our gin physician, who said that whoever cured us, must cure\r\nour nerves, and he could not do it. This we regarded as our final\r\nknell, and we began to read the Bible and hymn book, and prepare for\r\ndeath. But a homœopathic physician was strongly recommended, whom we\r\nconsulted, who gave us phosphorus and aconitum, which revived us like\r\ngalvanic batteries, and he then told us to exchange Graham bread and\r\nmush for beef-soup and tenderloin, and we recovered rapidly. We were\r\nteaching a lad, whose dear little sister had the dysentery, with two\r\nallopathic butchers in attendance, who, after bleeding, and leeching,\r\nand blistering, and suffusing her system with mercury, recommended\r\nbrandy as a last resort. The little angel had her last fit, as was\r\nsupposed, and as her father was exhausted and bed-ridden with grief and\r\na burning fever, we went for a coffin towards midnight, and entered\r\na store where there was a lamp in its expiring rays, and rang the\r\nbell, when in the drear and narrow perspective, we beheld the lank\r\nand greedy grave-digger in his shirt and pants, and black nightcap,\r\napproaching us, in about the measured pace of “Hamlet’s Ghost.”—He\r\nhad a dark lantern, and seemed a hideous spectre emerging from the\r\nregions of the dead. We were extremely nervous, and awfully dyspeptic,\r\nand unusually depressed from the protracted storm, and could endure\r\nhis fearful aspect no longer, and when within five paces of our\r\ntrembling person, we darted from the coffin store, and ran as though\r\nthe evil Nicholas was after us. The sexton suspected us for a thief,\r\nand chased us several blocks, but we flew like a whirlwind, and the\r\ndevil himself could not have caught us. On reaching the abode of the\r\nsuffering innocent, we found that she had emerged from the last fit,\r\nand off we scampered for the homœopathic physician who had saved our\r\nlife with phosphorus, and aconitum, and beef soup, and tenderloin.\r\nWe aroused him from his couch, and we were by the side of the little\r\ninvalid in twenty minutes, when the Doctor removed a tooth, (her jaws\r\nbeing apparently closed in death,) and deposited about four drops of\r\nmedicine in her mouth, which was continued during the night, and at\r\ntwelve, meridian, she ate egg and potato combined, with milk, and\r\nin five days she rollicked all over the house. While conducting the\r\nMatsell Investigation, we wrote a Disquisition on Worms, and Mrs.\r\nDoughty, (the amiable wife of Mr. Doughty, who was long connected with\r\nthe New York Street Department, and whose lovely daughter married a\r\nmember of the great Banking House of Prime, Ward, & King,) called on\r\nthe noble and supremely beautiful Mrs. Alderman John H. Briggs, and\r\nsaid: “I reside near Newark, New Jersey. My husband’s name is Samuel\r\nS. Doughty, (who was Street Commissioner of the City of New York in\r\n1844 and ‘45,) and is very wealthy, and has erected a mansion that will\r\ncompare with any in New Jersey. We have spacious grounds, and gardens,\r\nand orchards, and horses, and carriages, and all that can render us\r\nhappy in the evening of our days, and yet we are very miserable. A dark\r\ncloud hovers over our magnificent abode, that we fear will soon belch\r\nthe elements of destruction, and overwhelm us all in one common ruin.\r\nI have a sweet, and intellectual, and generous-hearted daughter, whose\r\nrare conversational powers, and vocal and instrumental music, cheered\r\nus in other days, who has been chained to a couch of illness more than\r\ntwo years. So disconsolate is her heart, that she will not permit her\r\nrosy and curly children to enter her apartment, nor a solitary mortal,\r\nsave myself and husband. Her stomach rejects every species of food, and\r\nshe has the piles most awfully, and several other diseases. Doctors\r\nParker and Mott, and other eminent Americans, and two distinguished\r\nEuropean physicians, have crossed the Atlantic, and toiled long and\r\nhard for her restoration. Now, my dear Mrs. Briggs, please listen\r\nvery attentively to what I am about to disclose. A week since, I\r\ndiscovered a long article on Worms in the _New York Daily Times_,\r\nsigned by Stephen H. Branch, and read it to my daughter, to elicit,\r\nif possible, a smile from her sad face. But I had scarcely closed it,\r\nere she partially arose in her bed, and fixed her excited eyes upon\r\nme, and most terribly alarmed me, as she had not arisen in her bed for\r\nmonths, without assistance, and I said: ‘Why, my dear child, did you\r\narise without my aid, and why, dear Caroline, do you stare so at your\r\nmother?’ She waved her hand, and faintly cried: ‘Go on, dear mother,\r\ngo on, and let me again hear the delightful music of those words. I\r\nam saved, mother, I am saved, and Stephen H. Branch is my deliverer.\r\nRead, mother, read, and gladden the heart of poor Caroline.’ And I\r\nread it again, and she alternately wept and laughed until I closed\r\nit, and then she softly laid her head upon her pillow, and crossed\r\nher arms on her excited and swelling bosom, and breathed a prayer to\r\nGod for the preservation of Mr. Branch, until she could behold him.\r\nHer words were perfect inspiration, and I cried until my eyes were\r\nhighly inflamed, and until I almost fell upon the floor, and I dared\r\nnot cry more, and I had to leave her and call my husband, who came and\r\nrelieved me. She had not slept without laudanum for months, but in ten\r\nminutes after I closed Mr. Branch’s article on Worms, she passed into\r\na gentle and natural slumber, and did not awake until the following\r\nday at meridian. And her repose imparted a rainbow glow to her icy\r\ncheeks, and exchanged roses for lilies. And she beckoned me to her\r\nbedside, and softly said: ‘Mother: I want you to visit Mr. Branch, as I\r\nbelieve I have got worms, and I am sure, from his glowing and truthful\r\nDissertation on this novel theme, that he fully understands my case,\r\nwhich the most eminent physicians have failed to fathom.’ I smiled,\r\nand assured her that it would be useless. But for several days she has\r\nafforded me no peace, such have been her importunities for me to see\r\nMr. Branch. And as I conceived it very dangerous to oppose her will, in\r\nher critical condition, I have come, and I desire you to exert all your\r\ninfluence to induce Mr. Branch to accompany me to my residence in the\r\nsuburbs of Newark, and see my beloved child, who will salute him like\r\na brother and deliverer, and who is nearly distracted to behold him.”\r\nMrs. Briggs sent for us, and we personally responded on the following\r\nday, when we told her that we were chasing Matsell night and day, and\r\ncould not spare the time to visit Newark invalids; nor did we desire\r\nto, as we were not a practical physician, and if we assumed the awful\r\nresponsibility of treating chronic piles and worms, if a patient died\r\nwhile under our care, we might be arrested for murder, and be tried\r\nby a jury packed by Dick Connolly, as County Clerk, and be condemned\r\nand hung. So, in comes Mrs. Doughty again, and again, and through her\r\ntears, and those thrilling and irresistible apostrophes of a devoted\r\nmother, she touches the magic cord in the heart of Mrs. Briggs, who\r\nresolved to get me to Newark, if possible. So, she comes at me like\r\nGeneral Putnam’s or Samson’s wives, and demands me to visit Newark to\r\ngratify the invalid’s curiosity to see me, as a matter of humanity, and\r\nsaid that if I did not go, the daughter might die in a fit, and I would\r\nbe responsible to God and man, and to woman also, for she, herself,\r\nwould forever hold me responsible for the premature demise of the pale\r\ndivinity of Newark. So, we proposed to go, if her husband, Alderman\r\nJohn H. Briggs, would accompany us. We then winked to Jack, and he\r\nhesitated, which pleased us well, and we peremptorily declined to go.\r\nBut Mrs. Briggs then flew at Jack with a fork and pepper box, and Jack\r\nyielded like a docile lamb, and we also had to go, or perhaps receive\r\nthe perforation of a fork, or a gill of pepper in our eyes, or listen\r\nto a tongue that might have blistered our conscience. So we saw our\r\nextraordinary physician, who had ejected eleven worms from our belly,\r\n(one of which was tied in a square knot,) and over we went to Jersey\r\nCity, where Mr. Doughty, and the most beautiful horses and carriage,\r\nwith driver and postilion, anxiously awaited our arrival, and on we\r\ngo to the suburbs of Newark, crossing a stream in a ferry boat, that\r\nstrongly reminded us of the immortal river Styx. We reach Mr. Doughty’s\r\nelegant residence, and drove through the meandering paths, and cull\r\npretty flowers, and luscious peaches, and enjoy a rural dinner, and\r\nare escorted by Mrs. Doughty into the presence of her daughter, who\r\nextends her skeleton fingers, and archly lays them in ours, whose icy\r\ncoldness thrills the fibres of our bowels. She strives to smile, and\r\ncasts tender glances, and looks down into our soul, for a deliverer.\r\nOur eyes reflect the fondest hope, and as she beheld this cheerful\r\nword, on the surface of our vision, she sweetly smiles, and presses our\r\npalm with tenderness and love. And then she breathes patient words of\r\nher afflictions, and touching soliloquies, and sings plaintive verses,\r\nand eclipses the sad Ophelia, when moaning for Hamlet, or scattering\r\nwithered flowers, or on the rosy margin of the glassy brook, where\r\nshe meets a watery grave. In her lucid intervals, we describe her\r\nsymptoms and emotions with such minuteness, that we quickly win her\r\nconfidence, and she is ready to show us her piles and half a dozen\r\nother diseases, including worms, and she directs her mother to remove\r\nthe bed clothes, and let us behold her scabs and frightful probes\r\nand lacerations, and inhuman mutilations, by the leading physicians\r\nof Europe and America. But we very emphatically direct Mrs. Doughty\r\nto replace the sheets, and quilts, and blankets, as we were not a\r\nphysician, and had no license, and as the authorities of New Jersey\r\n(which were rather severe when they caught a foreign barbarian in\r\ntheir dominions) might cage us, if they learned that we were examining\r\nfemale patients without a Jersey permit. But we assured both mother and\r\ndaughter, that the gentleman below, in company with Alderman Briggs,\r\nwas the very physician who drove eleven worms from our stomach, and\r\nthat he could critically examine her diseases, as he was a licensed\r\nphysician. So, although the invalid abjured her own lovely children,\r\nand her dear kindred, and doctors, and all save her father and mother,\r\nyet she had such confidence in us, that she permitted our physician\r\nto enter her chamber, where he critically examined her person, and\r\nimmediately assured her that he could not only save, but cure her in\r\nsix weeks. She spooned at this thrilling intelligence, and did not\r\nrecover her consciousness for two hours, when ourself, and the Doctor,\r\nand Alderman Briggs, returned to New York. Two months afterwards, we\r\ncalled on the Doctor, who informed us that he had just returned from a\r\nvery large party in Lafayette Place, where he had passed the evening\r\nvery pleasantly with Mr. and Mrs. Doughty and their lovely daughter,\r\nwho was entirely restored to health, and who played the great piano\r\nmusic of Thalberg and Lizt for him, and sang nearly equal to Alboni,\r\nand that he had the pleasure of a waltz in her graceful and bewitching\r\nembraces, who darted through the parlor in a dance, like an eagle\r\nthrough the air, and that the father, and mother, and daughter, warmly\r\ninquired for Mr. Branch, whom they regarded as the saviour of their\r\nearthly happiness. And thus closes the lamentations and humanities of\r\na ghastly Grahamite, whose narrative on Worms restored a marble statue\r\nto vitality, and her parents, and children, and kindred and friends,\r\nto the divinest hilarity and joy. And for miles around the residence\r\nof the Doughtys, invalids have been rescued from early graves by this\r\nsupernatural physician, who recently was compelled to conceal himself\r\nfrom the regiments of skeletons who applied for his magic skill and\r\nmedicines, which is the only reason why we do not disclose his mighty\r\nname, lest his patients waste him to the mournful realms of Greenwood,\r\nwhere his slender frame will soon repose forever.\r\n\r\n A MELANCHOLY POSTSCRIPT!—We called last evening to read these\r\n lamentations to the Doctor of Mrs. Doughty’s daughter, and we learned\r\n that he was reposing in the dark and silent caverns of the globe.\r\n O, the rats and mice and pigmies and shadows and phantoms of life’s\r\n funny and tearful and mysterious fandango. We open our eyes in the\r\n sweet twilight of the morning, and behold the gorgeous panorama of\r\n the Universe, and form the warmest attachments, and go to our rest\r\n at sunset, never to awake! Peace to the soul and ashes of Dr. David\r\n Perry, who is the lamented Physician of our narrative, who was the\r\n student of Dr. Cheesman, and preserved the life of ourself and brother\r\n and other kindred and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor American Youth to Read, and for Thieves and Traitors to Ponder.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Declaration of Independence in his right hand, John Adams, on\r\nthe Fourth of July, 1776, rose and said:\r\n\r\n“Mr. President:—Read this Declaration at the head of the Army; every\r\nsword will be drawn from its scabbard, and the solemn vow uttered to\r\nmaintain it or perish on the bed of honor. Publish it from the pulpit:\r\nreligion will approve of it, and the love of religious liberty will\r\ncling around it, resolved to stand with it or fall with it. Send it\r\nto the public halls—proclaim it there—let them hear it who heard\r\nthe first roar of the enemy’s cannon—let them see it who saw their\r\nsons and their brothers fall on the field of Bunker’s Hill, and in\r\nthe streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very walls will cry out\r\nin its support. Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs; but I\r\ncan see—see clearly through this day’s business. You and I may not\r\nlive to the time when this Declaration shall be made good,—we may\r\ndie—die colonists—die slaves—die, it may be, ignominiously and on\r\nthe scaffold.—Be it so—be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven\r\nthat my country shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim\r\nshall be ready at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that\r\nhour may. But while I do live, let me have a country, or at least the\r\nhope of a country, and that a free country. Through the thick gloom\r\nof the present I see the brightness of the future, as the sun in\r\nHeaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are\r\nin our graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with\r\nthanksgivings, with bonfires and illuminations. On its annual return\r\nthey will shed tears, copious, gushing tears—not of subjection and\r\nslavery—not of agony and distress—but of gratitude, of consolation,\r\nand of joy. And I leave off as I began—that live or die—survive or\r\nperish—I am for the Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and by the\r\nblessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment—Independence now, and\r\nIndependence forever!”\r\n\r\n\r\nReflections at the grave of CHARLES A.
